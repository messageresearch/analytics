[27:10] you and those of you that'll watch the
[27:12] service as well about the two services
[27:14] this weekend 10:00 and 3:00 um if you'll
[27:19] put forth an effort to be here I know
[27:21] that the holy spirit will meet you here
[27:24] and uh I'm having these services for a
[27:27] reason it's worked out out because I've
[27:29] been uh under the weather and just you
[27:32] keep me in your prayers we had a little
[27:34] little struggle with a sinus infection I
[27:36] don't have covid again but I've been to
[27:39] the doctor and had to deal with some
[27:40] things with my sinuses and things and
[27:43] they went and put me on blood pressure
[27:44] medicine so yeah I'm a little too young
[27:46] for that you uh you pray for me I'm
[27:49] going to lose some weight we're going to
[27:50] get over that we're going to defeat that
[27:52] devil but but um uh anyway you hold me
[27:56] to that too but uh I you know we're
[28:00] having these services for a reason and
[28:01] that's to benefit all of you and me too
[28:05] you I need it but when you have a
[28:07] special speaker come in it it means
[28:09] something and so if you can be here
[28:11] Sunday morning and and those of you that
[28:13] are watching Sunday afternoon it'd be
[28:15] such a blessing to me as your pastor and
[28:17] also to the church and and just be a a
[28:21] blessing to to others as well but we
[28:23] need things from God we need healing we
[28:26] need to be closer to him and so we know
[28:28] that if we'll put forth the effort he'll
[28:29] meet us here he promised he would and
[28:32] and so we thank God for that today and
[28:34] brother Aaron is a a powerful preacher
[28:36] and I know he'll be a blessing a
[28:38] blessing to you let's stand together as

[36:35] everything there is a season and a time
[36:37] to every purpose that God would have
[36:39] under heaven and we know that tonight
[36:42] he's in control of of everything you

[37:07] away it can't sustain
[37:11] itself
[37:12] forever but it's got to come to a time
[37:16] at just as it there was a time that it
[37:17] was come into existence and and God
[37:21] formed the Earth but it's got to die
[37:23] this this world as we know it this

[38:24] manifest he'll make he'll make that

[38:37] for I know the thoughts that I think
[38:39] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[38:41] peace and not of evil to give you
[38:43] expected and so God God knows the
[38:46] beginning and he knows the end and he
[38:48] the thoughts that he has towards you and
[38:50] I are are not of trouble and confusion
[38:53] but of peace to give us an expected end
[38:56] to to what his word has said amen he's

[39:13] and I hallelujah
[39:15] amen and just that thought that just the
[39:19] thought of seasons and the the
[39:21] unchanging God and we just went through
[39:23] a beautiful time of of fall and I
[39:26] certainly enjoy this time amen but it
[39:29] seemed like it just passed by so quick
[39:32] and the leaves just fell off the trees
[39:34] and and I noticed and Allison pointed it
[39:36] out to me just two or three weeks ago we
[39:39] we had a tree in our yard that had lost
[39:42] all of its leaves but just one and that
[39:45] tree just just to think of it just just
[39:47] to think of the seasons and how that
[39:49] everything nature reveals God and it
[39:52] reveals the things of life and
[39:54] everything testifies of Jesus Christ
[39:56] everything if if you begin to really
[39:58] look at at every scripture everything
[40:01] testifies of
[40:02] him but to but to look at that tree just
[40:05] struggling to hang on just for a little
[40:08] bit just just that little bit of life it
[40:10] was struggling just to hang on but now
[40:12] we see that this season the fall that we
[40:15] enjoy it's almost come and gone and now
[40:18] everything's in in a dead state or going
[40:21] to that place and the life is going back
[40:23] to the roots and everything everything
[40:25] testifying of God testifying of of the
[40:29] resurrection and I certainly love I love
[40:32] the fall time because I like a deer hunt
[40:34] I I just love being out in the woods and
[40:36] being able to enjoy those
[40:38] things but there's something about the
[40:41] springtime there's something about that
[40:43] new life that comes forth and how it
[40:45] testifies of the Resurrection am mean
[40:48] there there's just something amen about
[40:51] that and God just through everything is
[40:53] revealed in seasons in the seasons and
[40:56] the natural seasons and we would look at
[40:58] it that God even in the seasons of Our
[41:01] Lives that God has revealed amen through
[41:04] through the times of life through the
[41:05] times of growth amen through the times
[41:08] of of of of Amen going into the winter
[41:10] time and we all have seasons that we go
[41:14] through but just to think that God is
[41:17] revealed in the seasons of
[41:19] life and we know that changes will come
[41:22] throughout our time here upon Earth amen
[41:25] many changes will come
[41:27] nothing will ever just stay the same
[41:30] though we would like it to be that way
[41:33] and to stay that way and me changes
[41:35] constantly come changes constantly
[41:39] happen amen it'll be that way as long as
[41:42] we're here on Earth amen things will
[41:46] change but God I I I just take
[41:49] encouragement from this that God has
[41:51] said in his word that I am God and I
[41:53] change not so there will be Seasons
[41:56] there will be seasons where things
[41:58] change and things come and things go but
[42:00] God himself Remains the Same and he
[42:03] changes
[42:04] not aren't you thankful for that tonight
[42:07] his word remains true no matter how long
[42:10] time goes on or or what changes take
[42:12] place and in his own time he makes his
[42:15] own purpose come to pass Amen in his own
[42:19] time amen a amen and no l no no matter
[42:22] how long it would take God's word
[42:24] remains true amen God's word will never
[42:27] change it will never falter amen but it
[42:29] means what it says and it says what it
[42:33] means through all the changes his word
[42:36] Remains the Same his word remains
[42:39] true things change people come and go
[42:43] amen but no matter what comes and go our
[42:46] God Remains the Same through the ups and
[42:48] downs through the hills and Through The
[42:50] Valleys through the seasons and changes
[42:53] of life amen through the good times and
[42:55] the bad through the sickness and the
[42:57] trials and the discouragements of Life
[43:00] whatever present condition or or season
[43:02] of life you're in here tonight God
[43:05] remains God Amen through it all through
[43:08] it all God remains God he remains
[43:10] faithful and true aren't you thankful
[43:13] for
[43:14] that Lord help me to keep my
[43:20] voice so we see that that God remains
[43:24] God that there's seasons and things
[43:26] change but he Remains the
[43:29] Same so if that describes him and his
[43:33] character let me be like that may my
[43:37] character be just like his
[43:40] is that's good for the Bible says as he
[43:43] is so are we as he was in This World In
[43:46] His walks so are
[43:48] we Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed
[43:51] to this world but be ye transformed by
[43:54] the renewing of your mind that you may
[43:56] prove what what is that good and
[43:58] acceptable and perfect will of God that
[44:01] word conform means to Fashion oneself
[44:03] according
[44:04] to to conform oneself one's mind and
[44:08] character to to another's
[44:10] pattern fashion oneself to shape one
[44:14] thing like another describes what is
[44:16] transitory changeable and
[44:19] unstable so we don't want to conform as
[44:22] the scripture says to this world be not
[44:25] conformed to the fast
[44:27] to what someone else thinks to what this
[44:30] church does and if they decide to go off
[44:32] on a certain path away from the world
[44:35] don't conform yourself to that is that
[44:38] right Amen to another's pattern to what
[44:41] somebody else and we we sometimes a lot
[44:43] of times we we we worry so much about
[44:45] what other people think amen but we
[44:47] ought to worry about what God thinks
[44:49] about what God's word has said about us
[44:52] amen and fashion oursel towards that
[44:57] be not conformed to this world don't
[44:59] find yourself in a place where you're
[45:01] you're changeable where you're
[45:03] unstable be but be ye transformed not
[45:07] conformed but transformed by the
[45:09] renewing of your
[45:13] mind and we as the bride have a
[45:15] responsibility to stay with the word in
[45:19] a time when everyone else is conforming
[45:21] to this world Amen I believe we have a
[45:24] responsibility to stay with the spirit
[45:26] of God Amen to hold the standard of the
[45:29] word to hold the standard in the morals
[45:31] and our convictions of the word of God
[45:34] and the things that we've been taught
[45:35] amen amen to hold the standard as Sons
[45:38] and Daughters of God Amen because the
[45:42] spirit in the church brother says in the
[45:45] spirit and the prophet and the bride are
[45:47] all saying the same thing amen we've got
[45:50] to stay true to that we have a
[45:52] responsibility not to get away from the
[45:54] word but to stay with the word come
[45:58] on and then we've got a responsibility
[46:01] we've got a
[46:02] calling we've got to not only be like
[46:05] the word but we have to become the
[46:09] word many people will will reflect
[46:12] certain parts and they can fulfill
[46:14] certain parts and and they can can seem
[46:17] to seem to walk so far with it but the
[46:20] goal is not just to be like the word but
[46:22] to become the word for Jesus was the
[46:25] word he was the the word made flesh what
[46:28] what had been spoken amen what had been
[46:31] portrayed and it's it's okay to go along
[46:34] with that for a while and no doubt we're
[46:36] all going along with it but we've got to
[46:38] become the word just as Jesus was the
[46:41] word must become flesh and you and
[46:43] I amen not just to be like the word not
[46:47] to be like a Christian but to be a
[46:49] Christian to be like Christ to become
[46:53] the word to become
[46:55] him because
[46:57] the bride is just as he
[46:59] is amen I don't want to be conformed to
[47:02] this world or its ways or someone else's
[47:04] image or way of thinking amen because
[47:07] the time that we live in that which is
[47:10] right has become wrong and that which is
[47:13] wrong has become right you've got to be
[47:16] able to to think for yourself amen You'
[47:19] got to have something Amen to attain to
[47:22] amen or you you you'll just walk in this
[47:24] life and just just accept what somebody
[47:26] body else says but you got to get it for
[47:28] yourself you've got to catch a vision of
[47:31] what the word has said and and conform
[47:34] your life transform your life your life
[47:36] to be formed to
[47:39] that amen I don't want to be conformed
[47:41] to this hor but I want to be con I want
[47:43] to be formed to Christ the word word to
[47:45] be shaped into His Image Amen to be
[47:49] transformed into whatever the word says
[47:51] I can be because someone and and I want
[47:54] I want you to preach with me tonight

[48:00] sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen come
[48:03] on somebody amen someone is going to
[48:05] live in Victory amen someone's going to
[48:08] live above the things of this world Amen
[48:10] someone is going to be changed in the
[48:12] moment in the twinkling of an eye and me
[48:15] someone is going to be what the word
[48:17] says they can
[48:21] be amen and friends I believe tonight
[48:23] what God has shown us is the truth
[48:26] hallelujah amen what God has shown us is
[48:29] the truth of the hour amen God isn't
[48:31] going to take it back because things get
[48:33] difficult or because things get hard

[48:38] what we've received someone scoffs at it
[48:41] amen there's not another message to come
[48:43] amen what we have received is the truth
[48:45] and we've got to believe it we've got to
[48:47] accept it we've got to give our entire
[48:50] lives to it and rest in what he has said
[48:54] for our day amen hallelujah
[48:57] amen do you believe that
[48:59] tonight amen God Amen Jesus said will I
[49:03] find faith when I return amen he's
[49:05] looking for someone that will take him
[49:07] at his word amen someone that's willing
[49:10] to stay with the word regardless of how
[49:13] bad things get of how hard and difficult
[49:16] things get Amen in a time when things
[49:19] are changing
[49:20] constantly amen changing all the time
[49:24] it'll go this direction for a little bit
[49:26] and then it'll go back that direction
[49:27] for a little bit things are constantly
[49:31] changing everything but God Remains the
[49:33] Same God remains faithful and true
[49:37] tonight he's looking for someone that'll
[49:39] take a stand in the end time someone
[49:41] that'll take a stand of Faith am me
[49:44] someone that'll stand there and be
[49:47] unchangeable amen someone that'll stand
[49:49] there and be
[49:50] unmovable unshakeable amen with faith
[49:53] unwavering amen and you think of the of
[49:55] the three Hebrew children amen walking
[49:58] into that into that fire amen they were
[50:00] unchangeable amen they were unmovable
[50:02] they were unshakable they were certain
[50:05] of God that he would meet them in the
[50:07] fire amen and I'm certain tonight amen
[50:09] that no matter what we go through amen

[50:13] or or so on that God will be with us
[50:16] that God will meet us in the fire amen
[50:19] no matter what Le de see could throw our
[50:21] way that God will meet us every step of
[50:23] the
[50:24] way amen let us walk with a faith
[50:28] unwavering
[50:32] Amen brother random says here and God
[50:35] sets a time and has a purpose for
[50:38] everything that he does there is nothing
[50:41] happens just accidentally to those who
[50:43] love the Lord and are called according
[50:44] to his calling see we are predestinated
[50:47] and everything works just right for that
[50:49] because he cannot lie and he said that
[50:51] was so that everything has its time its
[50:54] season and it has its way and God is
[50:57] behind every move and sometimes you
[50:59] think everything is going wrong it's up
[51:02] to us he said those things are put Upon
[51:04] Us trials and wonderings it's testings
[51:06] to see how we will react on an
[51:11] action don't you love that 1 Peter 1 16
[51:15] and 7 wherein ye greatly Rejoice though
[51:18] now for a season if need be ye are in
[51:20] heaviness through manifold temptations

[51:25] more precious than of God told that
[51:28] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[51:30] might be found under the praise and
[51:32] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[51:35] Jesus Christ so everything that we go
[51:38] through all the unexpected things of
[51:41] life amen amen is for a reason amen it's
[51:46] for a reason the trial of your faith
[51:48] amen that God might get Glory from our
[51:51] lives and then that God might receive
[51:53] all the glory and all the praise and all
[51:56] the honor Wonder amen at is
[51:59] appearing we certainly live in a trying
[52:02] time a time when the whole earth is
[52:05] being
[52:06] tried amen it's like a trying time over
[52:09] the the entire
[52:11] Earth and it seems like when one trial
[52:13] ends there's another one not far down
[52:16] the
[52:17] road and you know whether you're a
[52:19] Christian or a sinner you'll have
[52:21] hardships in this life but I'd rather go
[52:24] through it the trials of life with God's
[52:28] help and believing his word amen I'd
[52:31] rather go through it that way than
[52:32] trying to navigate everything on my own

[53:03] that he'll see us through
[53:07] amen
[53:08] amen if I had to depend upon myself amen
[53:12] I'd be in a bad spot if we all had to
[53:14] depend upon oursel we'd be in a bad way
[53:17] amen but we've got someone we can lean
[53:19] upon amen we've got someone greater than
[53:22] ourselves and Sons and Daughters of God
[53:24] brother BR said God we were designed to
[53:27] depend upon God Amen not to try to
[53:29] figure out ourselves or try to try to

[55:39] there you love the Lord
[55:42] tonight amen we all go through things we
[55:45] all get
[55:47] overwhelmed Peter said the trial is more
[55:49] precious than gold and God God wants to
[55:52] see our our reaction to every action God
[55:56] God wants to see what we will
[55:58] do he wants to see your reaction when
[56:00] you're pressed amen when you're
[56:03] squeezed anden he wants a man he wants
[56:06] someone that'll put him first someone
[56:09] that'll that'll put his trust in him
[56:11] that he'll lead you and that he'll guide
[56:12] you he wants someone amen that'll put
[56:15] God first
[56:18] amen amen for this world is going to
[56:21] pass away and the riches and the things
[56:22] of this life will perish everything that
[56:25] you could ever attain in this life won't
[56:28] mean nothing it won't mean nothing
[56:30] because one day it's going to be ashes
[56:32] one day it's going to be no more and in
[56:35] this life that we live the troubles that
[56:36] we have the things that we try to attain
[56:38] one day it's going to be no
[56:41] more and brother Brenham says here he
[56:44] says many times the troubles strike our
[56:47] home he says it's blessings and
[56:51] disguisable you're sick just because
[56:53] you're not right with God that doesn't
[56:55] mean that job was was right with God and
[56:57] he was sick but it's God testing you
[56:59] putting you to a test to see what you'll
[57:01] do maybe he let the doctor say that for
[57:04] a purpose to see what you do we're
[57:06] nearing the coming of the Lord God's
[57:08] coming for a church he never asked the
[57:10] question will I have a church will I
[57:12] have righteousness but here was the
[57:15] question Jesus asked will I find faith
[57:17] when I come God putting you to a test
[57:20] and try your
[57:21] faith 1 Peter 4:12 said beloved think it
[57:25] not Str strange concerning the fiery
[57:27] trial which is to try you as though some
[57:30] strange thing that happened to
[57:34] you amen and we all Wonder take a breath
[57:39] here we all wonder you know why am I
[57:42] going through this we all had those
[57:44] thoughts as humans why why am I going
[57:47] through this am mean and Peter said
[57:49] think it not strange concerning this
[57:52] fiery trial as some strange thing that
[57:55] happened to you
[57:56] we all as humans we question that amen
[57:59] though though we're filled with the Holy
[58:01] Ghost not that it's really a doubt but
[58:04] we question why why am I going through
[58:06] this why why why is it lingering this
[58:09] long why am I dealing with this for so
[58:12] long and it it seems to linger and
[58:13] linger but God God is trying to get a
[58:16] reaction from you and I because that
[58:19] fiery trial is for our good
[58:22] amen to everything there's a season a
[58:25] time and a purpose purpose you know what
[58:27] some it seems that some people deal with
[58:29] sickness a lot more than others and some
[58:32] some don't ever hardly get sick but they
[58:34] go they go through things they still go
[58:36] through things as much and they they
[58:39] deal with trouble and afflictions of
[58:41] this life but it's to bring us to a
[58:44] place where God can make himself more
[58:46] real to us than he was before the trial
[58:49] Come Peter said thinking not strange
[58:52] When Trials come upon you fiery trials
[58:54] it's better to you than gold it's done
[58:57] to prove you all that Refiner's Fire
[59:00] that it'll come out 100% all the draw
[59:03] smelted out all the unbelief see God's
[59:06] got a purpose an experience then that
[59:09] you know what the Hebrew children could
[59:11] testify after they went through the fire
[59:13] that God is a savior from the fire and
[59:16] they knew it amen it's to bring you out
[59:19] amen as you go through the fiery trial
[59:20] is to bring you out for better on the
[59:23] other side it's to help you it's to
[59:26] bring you along that you can be more
[59:27] certain amen that you can look back and
[59:30] you can see what you've been through you
[59:32] can look back and you can testify what
[59:34] you've been through and know and you can
[59:36] be certain that God is a savior that God
[59:39] is an on time
[59:42] God
[59:43] amen amen they could look back and they
[59:46] knew it amen life isn't supposed to be
[59:51] easy we all have
[59:53] hardships but it's what you do with what
[59:55] life life has dealt you and it's
[59:57] completely up to you it's completely up
[1:00:00] to you and I of what is thrown our way
[1:00:03] and how we deal with
[1:00:05] it we don't choose I read this today we
[1:00:08] don't choose to be victims but we can
[1:00:11] choose not to be one so a lot of times
[1:00:14] you can't help things that come your way
[1:00:17] but you can choose you can make the
[1:00:18] choice to not be a victim even though
[1:00:21] you were a victim you can choose you can
[1:00:24] make the decision to not to continue to
[1:00:26] be that way to have that
[1:00:29] mindset we can't control what what Life
[1:00:32] deals us sometimes you can't but you
[1:00:35] can't let it control you you can let it
[1:00:39] control you or you can take that flaw or
[1:00:41] that weakness that we all have in some
[1:00:43] form because of humanity and let God get
[1:00:46] the glory from your life and when we'
[1:00:48] got to give it to God anden we've got to
[1:00:51] yield ourselves to
[1:00:54] him I thought this was good I heard this
[1:00:58] in a sermon a few weeks back speaking to
[1:01:01] Fanny
[1:01:02] Crosby Fanny Crosby was blind but she
[1:01:05] wrote some of the greatest Christian
[1:01:07] songs near The Cross Blessed Assurance I
[1:01:11] shall know
[1:01:13] him blind Fanny
[1:01:16] Crosby but she came to a point in her
[1:01:19] life when she said if I had a choice I
[1:01:22] would still choose to remain blind for
[1:01:24] when I die the first face I will ever
[1:01:27] see will be the face of my blessed
[1:01:29] savior so it's it's what you it's what
[1:01:32] you do with it it's what you do with the
[1:01:35] flaw or the weakness that you had no
[1:01:37] control over on Amen you can let it
[1:01:40] control you or you can control it amen
[1:01:43] you can let God get the glory from it or
[1:01:45] you can let it beat you down your entire
[1:01:47] life am mean you can give it to God and
[1:01:49] let God Amen what he's really trying to
[1:01:51] do amen is glorify himself
[1:01:55] and everything God wants the glory
[1:02:00] amen amen much Affliction many are the
[1:02:04] afflictions of the righteous the Bible
[1:02:05] says but the Lord deliver them out of
[1:02:07] them all Hallelujah you believe that
[1:02:10] tonight amen we all we all go through
[1:02:12] sickness we all go through Affliction
[1:02:15] amen but the Bible says that bless the
[1:02:17] Lord oh my soul and all that is within
[1:02:19] me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh
[1:02:22] my soul and forget not all of his
[1:02:23] benefits who forgiveth all iniquities
[1:02:26] and health all thy diseases who
[1:02:28] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[1:02:31] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[1:02:32] Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth
[1:02:35] with goodness so that thy youth is
[1:02:37] renewed like the eagles the Lord
[1:02:40] executeth righteous and send judgment
[1:02:43] for all that are
[1:02:44] pressed amen he's still the Healer
[1:02:47] tonight amen he's still the deliverer
[1:02:49] from Affliction amen he still Our
[1:02:52] Redeemer here tonight Lord amen
[1:02:57] amen do you love the Lord I don't know
[1:02:59] when I started
[1:03:01] preaching I try not to hold y'all too
[1:03:03] much longer my voice is fading fastly
[1:03:07] quickly I don't think fastly is a word
[1:03:09] is it quickly quickly is a
[1:03:12] word you love the Lord
[1:03:15] tonight I tried to get brother Allan to
[1:03:17] preach and ask brother Ben if he was
[1:03:20] preaching I couldn't trick none of them
[1:03:21] into thinking that they were preaching
[1:03:27] Romans 8:28 and we know that all things
[1:03:30] I love this this these verses here and
[1:03:33] we know that all things work together
[1:03:34] for good to them that love God to them
[1:03:36] who are called according to his purpose
[1:03:39] for whom he did for know he did
[1:03:42] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:03:44] image of his son that he might be the
[1:03:47] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:03:49] whom he did
[1:03:50] predestinate then he also called and
[1:03:52] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:03:54] and whom he justified they me also
[1:03:57] glorified I love that I love that and I
[1:04:02] read this quote I think maybe the last
[1:04:03] time I preached but it still just sticks
[1:04:06] out to me just bear with me as I read
[1:04:09] this because I think it's very very we
[1:04:13] can apply it very much to to where we
[1:04:14] are right now brother renom says here I
[1:04:18] would be a discouraged man this morning
[1:04:20] if I didn't believe in the election and
[1:04:23] calling of God if I thought that this
[1:04:25] world world was left to the outcome of
[1:04:27] it by the power of man and by the wisdom
[1:04:30] of man and by the big fours and the UN
[1:04:32] and whoever never even mention God's
[1:04:34] name I'd be a discouraged person but I'm
[1:04:37] not looking for that outcome I look down
[1:04:40] in the pages of this old book here where
[1:04:42] God wrote it out and everything will
[1:04:44] come just exactly the way he said it and
[1:04:46] that's all so the only thing for me to
[1:04:49] do is not line up with them but line up
[1:04:51] with Calvary line up with God line up
[1:04:53] with his word stay in his word
[1:04:56] and no matter how much it looks like
[1:04:57] it's going to be that way it's going to
[1:05:00] be the way God intends it to be it can't
[1:05:03] be nothing else for him being infinite
[1:05:05] know the end from the beginning and he
[1:05:07] makes everything come to his Praises
[1:05:10] that's right Hallelujah all things have
[1:05:12] to work together everything will shape
[1:05:14] right up to its place M if that wouldn't
[1:05:17] make the courage in a Christian nothing
[1:05:19] can go wrong after all it's not our
[1:05:21] battle it's his it's not our wisdom it's
[1:05:24] his the only one thing that we had to do
[1:05:26] is put our faith and trust there and set
[1:05:29] still and see the glory of God and see
[1:05:32] how it moves around to its place every
[1:05:34] every will moving it may be scattered
[1:05:36] from side to side but it'll move right
[1:05:38] into its place when God speaks the word
[1:05:41] aren't you thankful tonight that you
[1:05:43] know what you know to see what you have
[1:05:46] what you've seen and the understanding
[1:05:48] that you have in the end time am me we
[1:05:51] know that this nation has rejected God
[1:05:54] we know that the politics of this world
[1:05:56] are
[1:05:58] corrupt amen that we know that it's
[1:06:00] controlled by Satan amen but I say
[1:06:03] tonight as brother B said our our
[1:06:05] outcome isn't controlled by that amen
[1:06:07] our outcome isn't controlled by by the
[1:06:10] politics of this nation amen but I know
[1:06:12] one tonight that's got it all in control

[1:06:17] times amen I know a man that can turn on
[1:06:19] the light amen and he can make the
[1:06:21] Rapture take place he said for in a time
[1:06:24] of trouble he'll hide in his Pavilion in
[1:06:26] the secret of his Tabernacle He Shall
[1:06:28] Set me upon a rock the only thing for us
[1:06:32] to do is to line up with Calvary amen
[1:06:34] die out to myself amen die out to my own
[1:06:37] thinking and let him come in and live in
[1:06:39] me let him come in amen not my wisdom
[1:06:42] but his not my understanding but his

[1:07:51] amen that means he's taking that
[1:07:52] responsibility upon himself he's left it
