[41:22] be strong and of a good courage For unto
[41:25] this people shalt thou divide for
[41:27] inheritance to land which I swear unto
[41:29] their fathers to give them and verse
[41:31] 7even it's one of my favorites only be
[41:33] thou strong and very courageous that
[41:35] thou mayest observe to do according to
[41:37] all the law which Moses my servant
[41:40] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[41:41] right hand or to the left that thou
[41:43] mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest
[41:46] you may be you may be seated tonight may
[41:48] the Lord add His blessings to the word
[41:51] and we have a journey to freedom but on
[41:53] this journey see if I can see these boys
[41:55] over here on this journey to Freedom
[41:57] there's going to be a fight can you say
[41:59] Amen there I don't believe there's I
[42:00] don't believe you can ever get to your
[42:02] goal uh without fighting for it and the
[42:04] reason is because we are fighting uh we
[42:07] are fighting an enemy a common enemy a
[42:09] common enemy that we all know well and
[42:11] if we look in the scriptures we'll see
[42:12] that we're not the only generation that
[42:14] has fought this same battle uh we I I
[42:17] tell you if you go back all the way to
[42:18] Moses's day you'll find that they had to
[42:20] fight for every inch of ground that they
[42:22] possessed can you say Amen everything
[42:24] that they needed on that Journey on
[42:26] their Journey to the promise on their
[42:27] journey to Freedom there would be a
[42:29] battle after battle there would be enemy
[42:31] after enemy every everything would come
[42:34] against them and when I believe on our
[42:36] way to the message of the hour and to
[42:38] full Revelation in this day you will
[42:40] fight with with everything you've got to
[42:43] attain what God has for you today the
[42:45] devil doesn't want you to be in this
[42:47] message the devil doesn't want you to
[42:48] know what a prophet taught in this day
[42:50] the devil does not want you to be happy
[42:52] in church can you say Amen the devil
[42:54] doesn't want you to know what a prophet
[42:57] said is truth he doesn't want you to
[43:00] follow after a Moses he doesn't want you
[43:02] to follow after a man named William
[43:04] Brandon why because they are Vindicated
[43:06] prophets and the devil hates the word
[43:09] and the devil hates the word of God and
[43:11] he hates the messenger that would bring
[43:12] it but if you go all the way back to
[43:14] where Moses is going into Egypt remember
[43:16] he could go down there and he could show
[43:17] the signs he could show the signs that
[43:19] God had told him he could you know he
[43:21] could call for the frogs and he could
[43:22] call for the fleas and he could call for
[43:24] all these things and yet the unbelievers
[43:27] could sit there and never one time would
[43:29] they come around and say well you know
[43:30] what that's a man of God no because an
[43:32] unbeliever is just an unbeliever can you
[43:34] say am man an unbeliever will never
[43:36] believe but listen there was a group of
[43:38] people sitting over there in the mud
[43:40] pits well come on somebody there's a
[43:42] group of people sitting over there that
[43:44] didn't look like much they didn't they
[43:46] didn't live in the palace and they
[43:47] didn't they didn't have the fancy
[43:48] chariots and maybe they didn't have the
[43:50] most money in the land but they were the
[43:52] people chosen to follow the message of
[43:54] the hour can you say amen God had
[43:56] already called these people for such a
[43:58] time as this and he had raised up a man
[44:01] on the back side of the desert and he
[44:02] knew his people needed delivered I tell
[44:04] you there was a message of Deliverance
[44:06] that came down that day and I believe
[44:08] today for you young people there is a
[44:09] message of Deliverance here if you could
[44:11] just reach out and grab a hold of it
[44:13] today why because God has sent a message
[44:16] in the season that it needed to come in
[44:18] to call out a young people that if you
[44:20] didn't have this message there would be
[44:22] no overcoming Leota you had to have
[44:24] something Supernatural in this day
[44:27] in order to come out all the older
[44:29] people can say Amen too you would have
[44:30] been just another Baptist or just
[44:32] another Methodist or just another
[44:34] Pentecostal but God has sent you a
[44:36] messenger and he said come out of Egypt
[44:39] come out of her my people and you you
[44:41] don't have to be partakers of those
[44:42] plagues can you say Amen we're not here
[44:45] to partake of what the world has well I
[44:47] I I tell you I feel like preaching to
[44:49] you for a minute we are we are more than
[44:51] able to take the land but we got to get
[44:53] out of Egypt first and I'll tell you on
[44:55] the way out of Egypt oh Supernatural you
[44:57] see Supernatural and you see the blood
[44:59] being applied and the token is applied
[45:01] and you think well this is going to be
[45:02] easy going this is going to be good
[45:04] because we're follow I'm with him we're
[45:06] following him and and and nothing can
[45:08] stop us well I tell you what well here's
[45:10] the problem the devil's still going to
[45:11] find you and he's still going to try to
[45:13] get you and so on your journey out of
[45:15] Egypt the devil don't even want to get
[45:17] you don't even want you to get out of
[45:18] Egypt but then when you get down to the
[45:20] to the Red Sea and and you you start to
[45:22] fear well well what about that good camp
[45:24] meeting I just come out of and and all
[45:26] those good feelings I just had well what
[45:28] happened to those well it they all left
[45:30] when Pharaoh's Army started showing up
[45:32] yeah they all left why because they're I
[45:35] than for the amen sign amen they you
[45:37] know listen they felt good when Moses
[45:40] brought them out they felt pretty good
[45:41] when when my kids are are you know
[45:43] they're they're saved under the blood
[45:45] they're under the token oh we got faith
[45:46] now but what about when Pharaoh's Army
[45:48] shows up what about when the devil
[45:50] fights you on Monday morning can you
[45:52] still remember there was a prophet that
[45:53] came with a message to pull you out of
[45:55] your condition well can you say man God
[45:58] sent a message and it was listen if he
[46:00] brought you out of Egypt he'll take you
[46:02] all the way to the promised land he's
[46:05] not going to leave you on this journey
[46:07] but he promised you a way of Escape oh
[46:10] but when Pharaoh's Army shows up and
[46:12] they they they show up and and the next
[46:13] thing you know well listen there they
[46:16] are and and can you imagine the scared
[46:18] looks on everybody's faces can you
[46:20] imagine everybody there is scared
[46:22] everybody there is like well well we
[46:24] just come out here to die in the
[46:25] wilderness and they told Moses we should
[46:26] have stayed there and Moses Steed the
[46:29] people and he stretched forth that rod
[46:31] and it had already been turned into a
[46:33] snake before but some of them people had
[46:34] forgot what God had already done for him
[46:36] I wonder if our young people have
[46:38] forgotten what God did for you just a
[46:39] few more short months ago hey well come
[46:42] on somebody that God has delivered you
[46:45] from demons God has delivered you from
[46:47] things that were in your life God has
[46:49] filled you with the Holy Ghost don't let
[46:51] the devil tell you I just want to go
[46:53] back like I
[46:55] was there's no tur it back now you've
[46:58] already come too far you already you've
[47:00] already come out of Egypt but you
[47:01] fighting another devil well come on
[47:03] somebody just because you had a good
[47:05] experience one time don't doubt the
[47:07] experience but remember remember the
[47:09] devil is going to show up again and
[47:11] again and you're I tell you what it's
[47:13] not just a Revival from one meeting to
[47:15] the next but I will say this it's good
[47:17] to have those experiences not just one
[47:19] time in your life but it a there's
[47:21] nothing wrong with having another
[47:22] experience when the Lord moves on the
[47:24] scene and you start seeing well I tell
[47:26] you what you can see a a Milky
[47:28] presentence sometimes over the
[47:29] congregation during a meeting because
[47:30] why the faith is high that's the time to
[47:32] step into the water that's the time to
[47:34] grab hold why well come on somebody it's
[47:37] not fanaticism to go down and get
[47:39] another experience at an altar that's
[47:41] not doubting what you got the first time
[47:43] I believe you got the Holy Ghost but you
[47:45] need a refilling tonight what you need
[47:47] tonight is to go back to where you got
[47:49] the the filling in the first place if it
[47:51] was in an altar if it was in a prayer
[47:53] closet wherever it was I say tonight you
[47:56] need to get back in tune with God again
[47:59] oh young people listen it ain't good
[48:00] enough to say well I had it I had it no
[48:02] hold on to what you got hold on to that
[48:05] and fight for it oh when you start
[48:07] feeling the atmosphere getting cold
[48:08] around you oh don't say well well I I I
[48:11] thought I had it no no no you still got
[48:13] the same thing you had at camp but you
[48:15] need to let that Revival be Reviving you
[48:17] again let that Revival start back up in
[48:19] you again and I'll tell you what the way
[48:21] to do it is quit looking at the doubters
[48:24] quit looking at the Red Sea and remember
[48:26] I'm with him I'm with a Vindicated
[48:28] Prophet I'm with a message that can well
[48:30] come on somebody I'm still in this thing
[48:32] to win it I'm in it to go all the way to
[48:35] the promised land I didn't come this far
[48:38] just to be lost in the desert I didn't
[48:39] come this far just to be just to be
[48:41] killed by Pharaoh's Army but I've come
[48:43] this far because I know that I know that
[48:46] the message of the hour is true and I
[48:48] know that I'm following a Vindicated
[48:51] Prophet the same Pillar of Fire that was
[48:53] there is the same Pillar of Fire that is
[48:55] leading the church today can you say
[48:57] Amen we don't have any reason to fear we
[48:59] don't have to worry about Pharaoh's Army
[49:01] I tell you when that army of demons
[49:03] comes against you God will raise up a
[49:05] standard and I believe God has raised up
[49:07] a standard in this hour well somebody
[49:09] ought to say Amen somebody ought to say
[49:11] this is my inheritance and I've comeing
[49:14] I I tell you what I'm not going to stay
[49:15] in Egypt I'm not satisfied with Egypt
[49:18] I'm not satisfied with just the journey
[49:20] but I know what's at the end of the
[49:22] journey and I will keep pressing on gy
[49:26] to God brother Rand would say it like
[49:28] this he said look I'll give it to you
[49:29] the land's over there but before you get
[49:31] there you got to fight can you say Amen
[49:33] before you get there you got to fight
[49:35] that's what's the matter with people
[49:36] today they're afraid to stand and fight
[49:38] what we need is I must fight if I should
[49:40] Reign increase my courage Lord he said
[49:42] must I be carried home to heaven on a
[49:44] flower bed of ease While others fought
[49:46] to win the prize he said no sir I must
[49:48] fight if I must reain he said oh we're
[49:50] so wishy-washy boneless and helpless
[49:52] spineless as worms Oh come on somebody
[49:54] that's what a prophet said why because
[49:56] we so easily want to give up when
[49:58] there's a CH in our way we so easily
[50:00] want to give up when it looks like we've
[50:02] got a little backsliding in our lives
[50:03] well the thing to do is not give up when
[50:05] you backslide but come back to God when
[50:07] you
[50:08] backslide well I got cold I don't I tell
[50:11] you what that that that emot that
[50:12] feeling left me I'm not against emotion
[50:15] I believe in EM I believe every
[50:16] Christian in here should have some
[50:17] emotion because if that religion is not
[50:19] causing emotion brother R said bury it
[50:22] well can you say amen that's what we
[50:24] need we need to know that there is a
[50:26] living God Among Us and we need to feel
[50:28] him because I think that's the time when
[50:30] he comes down and he starts he lets you
[50:32] know that he loves you I tell you what
[50:33] when you feel that belt going across
[50:35] your backside you know your parents love
[50:39] you right I can't get an name out of no
[50:42] none of them I tell you what but that
[50:44] you know that your parents love you when
[50:45] you do that and sometimes when you can
[50:47] feel God coming down in a meeting
[50:50] sometimes it ain't always pretty maybe
[50:52] it's in a corrective way but if you can
[50:53] just take what he's got for you then
[50:55] what he's trying to do is say listen I
[50:57] know what you've come out of I know
[50:59] where you've been but this is where you
[51:01] need to go I I'm not trying to be mean
[51:03] and I'm trying to wake you up a little
[51:04] bit I'm trying to find something to say
[51:05] but listen I tell you what some of you
[51:08] young people you're going to fight
[51:09] battles some of these young ones don't
[51:10] even know yet some of you teenagers have
[51:12] experienced it you know how the devil
[51:14] can get a hold of you you know how the
[51:15] devil can make you doubt your experience
[51:17] you know how the devil can tell you well
[51:19] I I thought I had the Holy Ghost but I
[51:20] don't have it yes you do quit giving ear
[51:23] to the devil quit letting the devil tell
[51:25] you who you are and start looking to the
[51:27] promise of
[51:29] God if you're on the journey with the
[51:31] messenger of the hour I say stay on the
[51:33] journey there there might be a time when
[51:34] you need water don't worry the water
[51:36] will come there might be a time when you
[51:38] need bread and you need something to eat
[51:40] there'll be something come from Heaven
[51:41] that'll feed your soul well come on
[51:43] somebody well just when they thought
[51:45] they're going to starve half to death
[51:46] here we are in the middle of a desert
[51:48] and God would send down His blessings
[51:50] and sending something to eat oh listen
[51:52] to me church God is not going to leave
[51:54] you alone but he has sent his comforter
[51:57] to give you the Holy Ghost and so you
[51:59] could be called out of Egypt but you
[52:01] didn't you didn't come out just to stay
[52:02] out but you come out so that you can go
[52:05] into
[52:06] something there's a coming out but
[52:09] there's a going in and going in today
[52:12] what is going to lead us in now if
[52:14] you'll notice Moses stayed on one side
[52:17] but on the other side Joshua took him
[52:19] over now brother Brandon would say and
[52:21] you young people listen to this your
[52:22] Holy Ghost today is the Joshua today is
[52:26] the holy ghost so we may not have a
[52:28] physical Joshua among us but the Holy
[52:30] Ghost uses men and the Holy Ghost uses
[52:33] leadership in your lives because the
[52:35] Joshua is the Holy Ghost so when Moses
[52:39] had to leave the scene well come on
[52:40] somebody I'm G preach to you for a
[52:41] minute when when the prophet had to
[52:43] leave the scene when the prophet may not
[52:45] have went over but yet he left the Holy
[52:47] Ghost so that listen brother brandom's
[52:49] not going to be here to tell you
[52:50] everything to do brother bram's not
[52:52] going to be here to tell you how to
[52:53] dress and how to live and how to act but
[52:55] there is a Holy Ghost GH that you can
[52:57] get a hold of and that Holy Ghost will
[52:59] lead you into the promises of God the
[53:02] Holy Ghost will take you where you need
[53:04] to go I'll tell you I about lost my
[53:05] voice but I'm going to preach anyway God
[53:07] has given you the Holy Ghost don't let
[53:09] the devil tell you you don't have it you
[53:13] know when the devil's telling you you
[53:14] don't have it that's a good sign you got
[53:16] it because every time he opens his mouth
[53:19] he's lying to you so you say well I had
[53:22] it but but but but but no no that's the
[53:23] devil talking to you because anytime
[53:26] there is doubt comes in your mind about
[53:28] something like that I'm telling you
[53:29] that's the devil speaking now God will
[53:31] deal with your heart but not in that way
[53:35] God's not going to be like well maybe
[53:36] that no listen that's not how God works
[53:38] with you God will draw you unto him God
[53:41] will draw you to the Holy Ghost God will
[53:43] draw you to an altar but the devil will
[53:45] make you sit in that seat in doubt right
[53:48] see God won't let you sit there in doubt
[53:50] God will draw you right back to him but
[53:52] the devil will cause you to sit there
[53:55] and doubt time after Ser service after
[53:57] service meeting after meeting well I I I
[54:00] just can't get it yes you can I don't
[54:02] care what you've done I don't care how
[54:04] bad you've been I don't care how low
[54:06] down you fell God knows your need and
[54:10] he's here to supply that need
[54:12] tonight I say in these meetings you
[54:14] ought to come to these services and if
[54:15] God should slay you in the spirit I say
[54:17] let him slay you in the spirit let's
[54:19] quit sitting in the seat of the scornful
[54:21] you know a prophet one time would sit in
[54:22] the seat of the scornful and in the seat
[54:24] of the scornful he would laugh and make
[54:26] fun of the people that were dancing in
[54:28] the aisles but one time he said he said
[54:30] he's sitting there thinking what that's
[54:32] crazy bunch and he said next thing you
[54:33] know the Holy Spirit got a him I I got a
[54:36] hold of him and next thing you know he
[54:37] was dancing in the aisles so be careful
[54:38] if you start laughing at people that are
[54:40] dancing I'm going to tell you this when
[54:42] Miriam and them got across the Red Sea
[54:44] when they got to the other side they got
[54:46] so happy that they had defeated some
[54:48] Giants and they had defeated Pharaoh's
[54:50] Army listen to me Church she couldn't
[54:52] help but play that tambourine and do a
[54:55] little bit of happy dance why because
[54:57] God had brought him through something
[54:59] and God today if he delivers you from
[55:01] something you can't help but praise him
[55:04] you can't help the shout a little
[55:06] bit how can I tell you what you hold
[55:08] your peace and the rocks are going to
[55:09] cry out but I say there's some young
[55:11] people today I challenge you don't let
[55:13] the rocks cry in your place I said don't
[55:15] let them have to cry out let us be the
[55:18] ones who praise God because he is worthy
[55:21] of Our Praise thank you Lord Brother BR
[55:23] talks about old buddy Robinson he said
[55:25] he got down in the corn field and said
[55:27] Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[55:28] when you come back to earth you're going
[55:30] to find a pile of bones laying here why
[55:32] because he got serious with God he
[55:34] wasn't just playing Church no more but
[55:36] he knew that I've got to have the Holy
[55:38] Ghost because that's what's going to
[55:39] take you into the land of
[55:42] promise brother Bram said but look at
[55:43] here what will my church say what will
[55:45] my pastor say what will this say what
[55:47] will my mama say what will this say it
[55:49] don't matter well come on somebody it
[55:51] don't matter what they say it don't
[55:54] matter what your friends say it don't
[55:56] matter matter what why because they're
[55:57] not the ones that have the final say but
[56:00] God has the final say can you say
[56:04] amen he said he said God said utterly
[56:06] destroy that thing amen he said what we
[56:08] need today he said you're baby and
[56:10] around with a whole lot of things you
[56:11] ought to be destroying well you young
[56:12] people better say Amen to that your baby
[56:14] and those demons that are trying to take
[56:16] you out I say it's time to let those
[56:18] demons go I say let them go because you
[56:20] can't take them in with you to the
[56:22] promised land we're going on a journey
[56:25] but we've got to get rid of some things
[56:27] and we've got to fight some devils and
[56:29] it's you're never going to get there if
[56:30] you give up you'll die in the wilderness
[56:33] but there's a group of people oh I hope
[56:35] you hear me now there's a group of young
[56:37] people that are already ready to fight
[56:39] why because they've been equipped with
[56:41] the armor they've been equipped with the
[56:42] sword of the word they know who they are
[56:45] you are more than conquerors young

[57:08] those those giants in the land he knew

[57:42] cycles and curses here tonight I don't

[57:48] you for such a time as this because
[57:50] you're not afraid of the Giants you're

[57:54] you know in that land there may be
[57:55] Giants there may be fighting there may
[57:57] be all kinds of things that'll come
[57:59] against you but in that land is blessing

[58:44] like boys the devil don't care what they
[58:46] do but he cares about you and he don't
[58:49] want you to make it into the land
[58:51] because he knows he can't be defeated
[58:54] but he don't wants you to be winners
[58:55] either either the devil knows I'll never
[58:58] achieve this I I I'll never make the

[59:04] make it but let me tell you something
[59:06] young people every time you fight that
[59:08] devil you've got to go back at him with
[59:10] the word and say it is written it is
[59:13] written brother Brandon would say it
[59:15] like this he said Jesus could have
[59:17] defeated Satan and cast him down but he
[59:19] actually gave us a blueprint for the
[59:21] weakest of
[59:24] Christians can you say Amen he said he
[59:26] gave us something for the weakest of
[59:27] Christians because Jesus could have just
[59:29] cast Satan down but he said it is
[59:31] written because he wanted to show you
[59:33] that's all you have to say is it is
[59:36] written all you have to say is I'm not
[59:39] going to fall for that trap of the devil
[59:41] again all you have to say well come on
[59:43] somebody I tell you what if there's a
[59:45] boy that's not in church and you young
[59:46] girls are trying to go after him I say
[59:48] stay away from him because it is written
[59:51] don't yoke yourself up with unbelievers
[59:53] well come on somebody you young boys
[59:55] don't don't be looking after these
[59:56] Hollywood girls don't be looking after

[1:00:03] listen it's it's pleasure for a season
[1:00:05] and the end of end thereof is death it's
[1:00:08] nothing but to take you right out of the
[1:00:09] land but let me tell you something get
[1:00:12] so in tune with God that you're not

[1:00:43] 10 minutes
[1:00:45] left let me tell you something you get
[1:00:47] in these meetings and these pretty girls
[1:00:48] show up and they always dress better at
[1:00:50] meetings than they do at their home
[1:00:51] church just so you
[1:00:54] know because they dress up cuz they know
[1:00:56] there's going to be all these little
[1:00:58] boys and and boys do too they'll you
[1:01:00] know they'll dress to the nine for a
[1:01:02] meeting and the regular Services you
[1:01:03] know they're mismatched I know my I know
[1:01:06] my tie don't wear don't match my suit
[1:01:07] but uh it ain't meetings yet so I'll
[1:01:11] match them up for the meetings listen
[1:01:12] but it's the way it's nature it's nature
[1:01:16] but do you know the most important thing
[1:01:17] you can get out of this meeting is not a
[1:01:18] girlfriend or a boyfriend the most
[1:01:20] important thing you can get is my
[1:01:21] relationship with God right because you
[1:01:23] get that one right and God will take
[1:01:25] care of the rest
[1:01:26] you don't have to worry about who you're
[1:01:27] going to marry if you get this right
[1:01:29] let's get this right first and God will
[1:01:31] send you the right one when you're ready
[1:01:33] for the right one well come on somebody
[1:01:35] just because you're 17 18 19 years old
[1:01:38] doesn't mean you have to have a
[1:01:39] boyfriend it doesn't mean you have well
[1:01:41] come on somebody I'll just meddle a
[1:01:42] little bit brother Ben can get mad at me
[1:01:44] later listen we've let peer pressure
[1:01:46] interfere with the way we are in church
[1:01:49] because we think if so and so's got this
[1:01:52] then I need well come on somebody we
[1:01:54] need to let go the p pressure and say
[1:01:57] Lord what do you want for me what are
[1:01:59] what is your plan for my
[1:02:01] life because his plans will actually
[1:02:04] work out right in the end but if you go
[1:02:06] your own way and you don't consult god
[1:02:08] well come on somebody if you fail to
[1:02:10] consult God then God's not going to let
[1:02:12] you make it over into the promised land
[1:02:14] even his Prophet gets down there so far
[1:02:17] and he had to do things on his own he
[1:02:18] stood in the gap for the people and had
[1:02:20] to make decisions and he and he couldn't
[1:02:22] even go over because why well come on
[1:02:24] somebody I know that's hard to swall we
[1:02:26] say well Moses couldn't make it over but
[1:02:27] he had to intercede for the people and
[1:02:29] and he got out of the will of God he
[1:02:30] smoked the rock instead of speaking to
[1:02:32] the rock well that's just that's what
[1:02:34] happened that's what the Bible says but
[1:02:36] there is a generation who will just
[1:02:38] follow the message they're not going to
[1:02:39] look at the mistakes they're not going
[1:02:41] to look back and say well Moses couldn't
[1:02:43] make it are we well come on somebody
[1:02:45] it's not Moses they were following they
[1:02:47] were following a supernatural light and
[1:02:49] that light would lead them all the way
[1:02:52] from Egypt all the way to the promised
[1:02:54] land and it didn't stop there just
[1:02:56] because they crossed over there's going
[1:02:58] to be another people in today there's
[1:03:00] another people of the book there's
[1:03:01] another people that's called a Joshua
[1:03:03] generation why do we call them that
[1:03:05] because it's a holy ghost filled young
[1:03:06] people it's a holy ghost filled group
[1:03:08] and you have that Joshua on the inside
[1:03:10] of you that the Giants don't scare you
[1:03:13] oh come on somebody nothing scares you I
[1:03:16] I tell you what I was reading a quote to
[1:03:17] the brothers in the back there did you
[1:03:19] know did did you know that cancer is not
[1:03:21] any harder actually nervousness is
[1:03:24] harder to overcome than answer and what
[1:03:27] do you think the devil has attacked our
[1:03:29] young people with he's attacked their
[1:03:31] nerves he wants to get them in such a
[1:03:34] condition that they can't even get right
[1:03:36] for go with God in a church they can't
[1:03:38] even think of how to come to come to God
[1:03:40] in a service he wants to attack your
[1:03:42] nerves because listen that's the way the
[1:03:44] devil Works he wants to get on he wants
[1:03:47] to get on your last nerve he wants to
[1:03:50] grab a hold of you at your weakest point
[1:03:52] and he wants to keep you from your
[1:03:54] blessings
[1:03:56] that's right I'm just preaching to you
[1:03:58] no idea where I'm going or where I'm at
[1:04:01] but listen God has got a young people
[1:04:04] that are going to have to quit playing
[1:04:05] around and quit well come on somebody
[1:04:07] quit just getting an emotion here and an
[1:04:09] emotion there hold on to that experience
[1:04:12] hold fast to that which is good and
[1:04:14] don't you let up for no devil that's
[1:04:16] trying to tell you that what you got
[1:04:18] ain't that because what I saw well I'll
[1:04:21] tell you what what I witnessed in a
[1:04:22] young people's meeting over there in
[1:04:23] Oklahoma was some young people getting
[1:04:25] filled with the Holy Holy Ghost it was
[1:04:26] no emotion oh you can laugh at it you
[1:04:28] can make fun of it but I saw some young
[1:04:30] people who it it changed their lives but
[1:04:32] the devil's trying to attack him again
[1:04:34] I'm just preaching to you the devil's
[1:04:36] trying to come after again and trying to
[1:04:38] cool them off because the devil don't
[1:04:39] like you worshiping God the devil don't

[1:04:54] some meetings anyway and we're going to
[1:04:56] back the preacher when the preacher
[1:04:57] preaches and we're going to sing with
[1:04:59] all of our voices well come on somebody
[1:05:02] I say it's time we quit playing church
[1:05:04] and start letting God have the have the
[1:05:06] final say of what's good and what's bad

[1:07:19] worship I don't care how you worship but
[1:07:22] I guarantee you I'll guarantee you when
[1:07:24] you sit there and you criticize other
[1:07:26] worshippers that's not worship that's
[1:07:29] right I know not everybody worships the
[1:07:31] same but worship however you worship
[1:07:33] with all you got right it ain't all
[1:07:36] screaming it ain't all running it ain't
[1:07:38] all speaking in tongues but worship God
[1:07:41] in the way that's called
[1:07:45] crazy well they don't call nobody crazy
[1:07:48] for sitting there like a bump on a
[1:07:51] pickle so that ain't the way to worship
[1:07:54] god well bless bless my heart I may not
[1:07:57] make it to the
[1:08:01] meetings I'm going to read a quote for
[1:08:03] you is that all right all great people
[1:08:05] great men every individual has a time
[1:08:07] where there's a decision
[1:08:08] time you got to say yes or no you young
[1:08:12] people this is important to you you got
[1:08:14] to say yes or
[1:08:15] no that may be there may be many in here
[1:08:18] tonight you got to say I will take
[1:08:20] Christ for my healer or I
[1:08:22] won't now that's listen you say Well
[1:08:25] that's for healing no that's for
[1:08:27] anything right you're going to take him
[1:08:29] at his word or you're not going
[1:08:31] to well can you say amen that's right I
[1:08:33] will take Christ or I won't he said
[1:08:35] think of it now the time of the promise
[1:08:37] Drew nigh and God Called Moses by a
[1:08:38] pillar of fire in the burning bush then
[1:08:40] God commissioned him and he said I will
[1:08:42] send the angel before thee to keep thee
[1:08:44] in the way to bring thee in the place
[1:08:46] which has been prepared which he's
[1:08:47] giving to them there's a place that's
[1:08:50] been prepared for
[1:08:51] you listen we're looking back too much
[1:08:54] we're looking at what was in Egypt quit
[1:08:56] looking at your problems and look at the
[1:08:59] promise Lord brother says like this he
[1:09:02] said I'll give you Palestine it's yours
[1:09:03] it's all fenced in with these hivites
[1:09:05] jebusites perizzites amorites it's all
[1:09:07] fenced in but I've give it to you oh
[1:09:09] come on somebody I don't care what kind
[1:09:10] of demons are over there looking at you
[1:09:12] in the face I've give you this land of
[1:09:14] promise I've let you have some freedom
[1:09:15] in church why because he knew you needed
[1:09:18] it in a time like this when do you
[1:09:20] realize what we're fighting in the age
[1:09:21] of Leota we're not fighting
[1:09:24] emotion we're fighing a cold formal
[1:09:27] indifferent lukewarm
[1:09:30] Church a lukewarm church maybe they're
[1:09:32] not cold he said I rather have a cold or
[1:09:33] hot listen he's fighting that Spirit
[1:09:35] he's not fighting a church on fire God's
[1:09:37] not fighting God didn't come out
[1:09:39] rebuking the church on fire he never
[1:09:41] rebuked the Church of Pentecost but he
[1:09:43] rebuked him for getting cold on
[1:09:46] him you say why would you preach such a
[1:09:48] way because that's what the Bible says I
[1:09:51] know Jesus sat down and taught them but
[1:09:53] I'll guarantee you them people were
[1:09:54] blessed that's right the Believers were
[1:09:57] the Believers were we never got we don't
[1:10:00] have any account what the congregation
[1:10:01] did they might have run the
[1:10:04] aisles use your imagination there I
[1:10:08] don't know I don't know where the aisles
[1:10:09] would have been in that situation but
[1:10:11] but listen we don't know what they did
[1:10:12] but I'm going to tell you this the word
[1:10:14] will move the believer the word will
[1:10:17] move the church listen the word will not
[1:10:19] move the unbeliever they'll sit there
[1:10:21] and look at you like you're crazy but
[1:10:23] this word ignites some something in the
[1:10:25] heart of the believer you can't stay
[1:10:28] quiet right there's nothing listen I'm
[1:10:32] almost out of time I give myself not
[1:10:34] enough time so anyway he said it's your
[1:10:36] possession it's all bound down with
[1:10:38] amorites and Canaanites and everything
[1:10:40] listen when you come to God is when the
[1:10:42] battle
[1:10:44] begins it was easy on the other side
[1:10:47] because it was just them and their own
[1:10:49] you know problems but then they get over
[1:10:52] there to the land where all the
[1:10:53] blessings are it's filled with giants
[1:10:57] that could destroy him that's right so
[1:11:00] when you young people actually get an
[1:11:02] experience with God is when the real
[1:11:04] fight began you say oh I want to I want
[1:11:06] to go back like I was three or four
[1:11:08] months ago no you don't because if if
[1:11:10] the devil wasn't fighting you then then
[1:11:12] he already had you but now that he's
[1:11:15] fighting you oh come on somebody I know
[1:11:17] our young people go through some things
[1:11:19] I talk to them I know what's going on
[1:11:20] with them I'm going to tell you
[1:11:21] something the devil's fighting you the
[1:11:23] devil don't want you to have victory in
[1:11:24] church no more the devil never
[1:11:27] you when you sat there quiet the devil
[1:11:28] never you when you didn't want to
[1:11:30] sing in church the devil never
[1:11:32] you when you wouldn't raise your hands
[1:11:33] brother trip the devil never fought you
[1:11:35] in that condition but now that you have
[1:11:37] found out that I can be free the devil's
[1:11:39] going to fight you with everything he's
[1:11:42] got and don't give in it's worth the
[1:11:45] fight the land is worth it this land is
[1:11:49] worth it young people everything that we
[1:11:51] have need of the blessings of God it's
[1:11:53] worth the fight
[1:11:56] it's worth it everything we have need of
[1:11:59] listen if you've got an addiction it's
[1:12:02] worth the fight to get over that he's
[1:12:04] given you the ability to fight it that
[1:12:06] may look too big for you to overcome but
[1:12:08] it's not too big nothing is impossible
[1:12:11] with you all that might have got you but
[1:12:13] brother brandham said he said I know
[1:12:15] that they say nothing is impossible with
[1:12:17] God he said but nothing is impossible
[1:12:19] with you either if you believe it that's
[1:12:21] a quote go look it up nothing is
[1:12:24] impossible with you young people because
[1:12:26] God has given you the ability to possess
[1:12:31] the land I tell you what if all you can
[1:12:33] do is start praying 10 more minutes a
[1:12:35] day take whatever you can get because
[1:12:37] every inch you possess is an inheritance
[1:12:40] for you everything you possess is an
[1:12:42] overcoming well come on somebody you'll
[1:12:44] never possess it going backwards you'll
[1:12:46] never possess it Running Scared you're
[1:12:48] never going to possess this land if
[1:12:50] you're running and you're scared to
[1:12:52] death of the devil the devil is nothing
[1:12:54] but a
[1:12:55] love those giants in the land were just
[1:12:58] scarecrows because when they went over
[1:13:01] there they realized the same God that
[1:13:03] brought me out of Egypt the same God
[1:13:06] that drowned Pharaoh's Army the same God
[1:13:08] that would provide water from a rock oh
[1:13:11] come on somebody the same God that was a
[1:13:13] rock in the weary of hand God that same
[1:13:16] God could take us over there to a walled
[1:13:19] City and let us March around it
[1:13:21] according to the word of God and every
[1:13:23] demon is going to fall down why because
[1:13:26] God said
[1:13:27] so we're letting the devil have his way
[1:13:30] we're letting the devil have all kinds
[1:13:31] of timeing in our minds and we're
[1:13:33] letting the devil have all kinds of time
[1:13:35] in the church service but I say let the
[1:13:38] devil go back where he come from and
[1:13:40] focus on the promise again and realize
[1:13:44] God said take the land and I'm going to
[1:13:46] take the land I don't care if there's a
[1:13:48] demon I got to fight I don't care well
[1:13:51] come on somebody I don't care what you
[1:13:53] got to fight God has giving you that
[1:13:55] land go possess it if God said you can
[1:13:58] have the Holy Ghost young ladies you can
[1:14:00] possess the Holy Ghost don't you wait on
[1:14:03] let's listen you don't have to wait till
[1:14:05] a meeting you can do it tonight if the
[1:14:06] Bible said to be baptized and you shall
[1:14:08] receive it I say the first step is get
[1:14:10] down to the business with God and repent
[1:14:12] of your sins and be baptized in the name
[1:14:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you
[1:14:17] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:19] and if you've been baptized don't you
[1:14:21] doubt that promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:23] because in this land this land of
[1:14:25] promise that Holy Ghost is yours in this
[1:14:27] land of promise everything you need is
[1:14:30] yours you say well I'm sick healing is
[1:14:32] yours I I don't have no joy no more joy
[1:14:34] is yours I tell you what I don't love
[1:14:36] church no more the love of God can come
[1:14:38] back in you why because it's yours you
[1:14:41] are in the land of promise can I tell
[1:14:44] you what it is the message of the hour
[1:14:47] this message is where all the promises
[1:14:51] lay everything you have need of is in
[1:14:54] this message
[1:14:55] for such a time as this it's spiritual
[1:14:58] food in It season oh yeah it's spiritual
[1:15:01] food for you young people see the devil
[1:15:03] don't want you to listen to tapes
[1:15:04] anymore you know why that's right
[1:15:06] because he don't want you to feed on the
[1:15:08] word stored up for today you know why he
[1:15:10] don't want you to come and listen to
[1:15:10] your pastor or why he come and listen to
[1:15:13] some little nit with
[1:15:15] preacher you know why he don't want you
[1:15:17] to because he knows that if you realize
[1:15:20] who you are if you can just recognize
[1:15:23] your freedom one time then he'll realize
[1:15:26] that that cord that he tied you with was
[1:15:28] cut the whole time and that he had no
[1:15:30] control over you and if you ever
[1:15:32] recognize that he knows he's losing his
[1:15:34] hold on you I tell you what young people
[1:15:36] you need to realize tonight he has no
[1:15:38] hold on you it's just a false Mirage
[1:15:41] that he's got some kind of a shelter
[1:15:42] over you and some kind of a Dark Cloud
[1:15:44] over you I say look up and say Lord
[1:15:47] deliver me from this evil he is more
[1:15:49] than willing to give you a refilling of
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost tonight I say there's
[1:15:53] somebody I don't let these meetings come
[1:15:55] and go without getting your blessing
[1:15:57] don't let these meetings come and go and
[1:15:59] you sit back there and say well they
[1:16:01] were good meetings there were some good
[1:16:02] preaching and you know what there was
[1:16:03] some good PE there was people got saved
[1:16:05] oh but what about me do I need another
[1:16:07] walk with God I say for everybody in
[1:16:09] this building tonight you need to think
[1:16:10] about it am I really where I need to be
[1:16:13] on this journey to the promised land am
[1:16:15] I really letting go of the things I need
[1:16:17] to let go of bitterness is not crossing
[1:16:20] over right hate will never cross over
[1:16:24] your opinion I against the word will
[1:16:26] never cross
[1:16:28] over come on you got a promise wrapped
[1:16:32] in
[1:16:33] opinion you might as well throw that
[1:16:35] baby out with the bath water because
[1:16:38] listen your opinion is not going to take
[1:16:41] you to the promised land but we have a
[1:16:43] Vindicated message we have a message
[1:16:46] that come oh come on somebody we have a
[1:16:48] messenger Vindicated with the same
[1:16:50] pillar fire that led Moses down to Egypt
[1:16:53] and led the people out
[1:16:56] you realize what we've got when your
[1:16:58] friends tell you why can't you just be
[1:16:59] Baptist why can't you just do this do
[1:17:00] you realize we're not following just
[1:17:02] another another move this is the move of
[1:17:04] the hour this this is the time that you
[1:17:07] realize this is the fashion move yeah
[1:17:10] come on this is it come on this this is
[1:17:13] this is hip this is what we're supposed

[1:19:21] Devil with the word of God oh I tell you
[1:19:24] what when you start feeling like the
[1:19:26] devil's got you brother JT I tell you
[1:19:28] what it's a good time to sit there and
[1:19:30] press play that's for my friends that
[1:19:32] think I'm think I'm
[1:19:34] crazy there's nothing wrong we've made a
[1:19:37] dirty word out of this right we we'
[1:19:40] we've said you can't have preachers but
[1:19:41] you can still press play you can still
[1:19:43] hear a Vindicated Prophet we are blessed
[1:19:46] when we were overseas and they had they
[1:19:48] had three messages in that language we
[1:19:50] realized how blessed we were we have it
[1:19:53] at our fingertips when that Devil's in
[1:19:55] that room with you and he's telling you
[1:19:56] you're not good enough and he tries to
[1:19:58] get into that mind and make you do
[1:19:59] something you know just ain't right go
[1:20:01] ahead and turn on a tape the devil hates
[1:20:04] being where God's presence is and I'll
[1:20:06] tell you what you can create an
[1:20:08] atmosphere when you listen to the
[1:20:09] message of the hour you can create an
[1:20:11] atmosphere when you get in your prayer
[1:20:13] closet and say you know what Lord here I
[1:20:15] am again and I tell you what he never
[1:20:17] gets tired of hearing from you I would
[1:20:19] say this he hasn't heard from us enough
[1:20:21] lately God wants to hear from his
[1:20:24] children God wants to hear when you're
[1:20:26] down God wants to hear when you're
[1:20:28] having a problem God wants to know you
[1:20:30] you need help God wants to know that why
[1:20:33] because you've let the devil have the
[1:20:35] time and you sit there and discuss deals
[1:20:37] with the devil and you forget you can go
[1:20:39] to God and he can solve every
[1:20:43] problem my time's up and I told him I
[1:20:46] wouldn't my time's over up
[1:20:48] actually can I read one more
[1:20:51] quote all right y all be okay you'll be
[1:20:55] okay you'll be okay now we're looking
[1:20:57] for somewhere there's no death no sorrow
[1:20:59] no heartaches no old age that land is
[1:21:01] somewhere and will never be able to
[1:21:03] achieve it by guns and fighting and so
[1:21:05] forth with a natural carnal weapon but
[1:21:07] there is a land that we can go to and
[1:21:09] it's a battle to get there when God gave
[1:21:12] Israel Palestine and when he was in
[1:21:13] Egypt they had to fight for every inch
[1:21:15] of it and he told Joshua and Joshua 1 he
[1:21:17] said wherever The Souls of your foot
[1:21:18] Treads upon that I have given you so
[1:21:21] Footprints means possession just keep
[1:21:23] walking walking pressing on and every
[1:21:25] time you make a step into the kingdom of
[1:21:27] God that's yours and all things are
[1:21:29] possible that's given and all things are
[1:21:31] given that's possible but it's a battle
[1:21:33] young people but it's a battle God has
[1:21:35] given you this land if you had a
[1:21:37] blessing at camp hold on to that
[1:21:39] blessing that was a possession that you
[1:21:41] needed but there's another blessing
[1:21:43] coming and grab a hold of every one of
[1:21:45] them there's listen God's not going to
[1:21:47] run out of blessings to give you I say
[1:21:49] take everything that God's got because
[1:21:51] his power is unlimited his word is here
[1:21:55] to give you to give you strength for the
[1:21:57] journey and his spirit is here to lead
[1:21:59] you and guide you into all truth I say
[1:22:01] what we need today is to quit looking at
[1:22:03] all the Fanatics and looking at all the
[1:22:04] crazy stuff around us and quit looking
[1:22:06] for all the faults in the message and
[1:22:08] the people you say well that one's not
[1:22:09] living it and that one's not living it
[1:22:10] and this one can't preach his way out of
[1:22:12] a wet paper bag and this one ain't no
[1:22:13] good I'm G to tell you right now what we
[1:22:15] need is to quit looking at the hum
[1:22:17] Humanity around us and start looking at
[1:22:20] the promises that are in the land that
[1:22:22] we're living in I say let's keep give
[1:22:24] God the praise he deserves I say let's
[1:22:26] give God thanks for bringing us into the
[1:22:28] land that we've I'll tell you what the

[1:22:31] all around you but God has set you aside
[1:22:34] and called you out of the mud pits so
[1:22:37] that you could enjoy the inheritance
[1:22:38] that you're in let us stand if few
[1:22:40] musicians would come I told you I'd stay

[1:22:46] to read this as they come he said now

[1:28:16] blessings love and praise him a little
[1:28:19] more today and a whole lot more tomorrow
[1:28:25] oh
[1:28:27] hallelujah oh isn't God
[1:28:30] good amen I just want to tell you a
[1:28:33] couple things in regards to the meetings
[1:28:35] and then we'll let you go I'm just
[1:28:37] really looking forward to it this year
[1:28:39] and it seems like every year we learn a
[1:28:40] little bit more what we're doing and and
[1:28:42] it gets a little easier but uh there's
[1:28:45] several jobs that uh brother Joel's got
[1:28:47] a book somewhere that got everybody's
[1:28:50] name in it with something to do you know
[1:28:51] but uh but if you don't have anything to
[1:28:54] do and you say well I I feel like I
[1:28:55] should help in some way then ask brother
[1:28:57] Joel or sister Virginia and they'll they
[1:28:59] they'll find something for you uh get
[1:29:01] put on a cleaning crew or something
[1:29:03] we're trying to even it out more where
[1:29:04] we don't have certain people just stuck
[1:29:06] over in the fellowship hall our weekend
[1:29:08] and and uh but you be praying for our
[1:29:10] deacons and our our workers and people
[1:29:13] that just it's just a it's a lot it's a
[1:29:15] lot for them to do but we want to keep
[1:29:17] doing it if we can do it I believe we
[1:29:19] should do it because it's such a
[1:29:21] blessing to us the meetings have been
[1:29:23] such a blessing so we want to do that we
[1:29:25] want to remember to take all your stuff
[1:29:27] with you everything everything that's
[1:29:29] yours if you think it might belong to
[1:29:31] you take it so uh so that way we can we
[1:29:35] can clear out the sanctuary they'll have
[1:29:37] to we've already moved the chairs what
[1:29:39] the vacuum and things and when we come
[1:29:41] in we're going to see people and we're
[1:29:43] going to see everybody that comes in so
[1:29:44] if you get her early and it's empty
[1:29:46] there will still be a brother here to
[1:29:48] seat you the reason we're doing that is
[1:29:50] because uh it helps us for Safety and
[1:29:53] Security but ALS also it helps we can
[1:29:56] put certain people certain places we got
[1:29:57] certain seats reserved and things like
[1:30:00] that CU we fill up around here usually
[1:30:01] during the meetings and we got a a small
[1:30:03] building but I'd rather have a small
[1:30:05] building full than a big building empty
[1:30:07] so so we thank God for everybody that
[1:30:09] comes many several folks coming from out
[1:30:12] of town and I guess more than we had
[1:30:14] last year from out of town at least so
[1:30:15] if we get our locals to show up we're
[1:30:17] going to have church so we're looking
[1:30:20] forward to that so much and and could we
[1:30:23] do this could we pray for one another
[1:30:24] this week as a church we need to be
[1:30:27] United one of the best things you can do
[1:30:29] is pray for somebody I I know there's
[1:30:31] people are going through things here and
[1:30:33] here we are coming to the meetings we're
[1:30:34] focused on that but you got you're
[1:30:36] fighting a battle sister Gloria fighting
[1:30:38] a battle right now and with things going
[1:30:40] on and uh different ones of you I know
[1:30:42] you're fighting a battle you pray for
[1:30:43] one another pray for one another pray
[1:30:46] for me if you don't got nobody else to
[1:30:47] pray for pray for our deacons pray for
[1:30:49] our our workers here in the church and
[1:30:52] brother Joel and brother Allen and the
[1:30:53] different ones will be helping I believe

[1:30:57] do that and say I'm I'm just going to
