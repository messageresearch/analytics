[35:46] [Music]
[35:55] we're going to pray in just a moment but
[35:58] i got a praise report
[36:02] back in the office that couple that we
[36:04] prayed for
[36:06] some time ago when i was at my grandma's
[36:08] funeral and the church prayed
[36:10] for them at the point of death and her
[36:12] organs were shutting down
[36:14] and she was having a baby i understand
[36:16] she delivered that baby yesterday
[36:19] and they're healthy thank the lord
[36:21] [Applause]
[36:24] amen he's still a miracle working god
[36:29] and we're believing for a miracle for
[36:31] this situation with this young man that
[36:33] fell or the limb fell on his head
[36:36] a child i can't imagine that being my
[36:38] child but
[36:40] there's power in prayer and we're going
[36:43] to pray but
[36:44] i want you to think about it and maybe
[36:46] wednesday night we'll approach the
[36:47] subject but
[36:48] the church was praying one time because
[36:51] peter and james had been put in prison
[36:52] and
[36:53] they killed james and peter was sitting
[36:55] there in prison and the church went to
[36:56] prayer brother glenn and when they did
[36:58] all of a sudden things began to happen
[37:02] and an angel went down and let peter out
[37:03] of prison that's what the bible says
[37:06] an angel let him out of prison
[37:09] because the church prayed and he
[37:12] actually showed up at the prayer meeting
[37:15] you still believe god does those things
[37:17] i believe he does
[37:19] if he's god and he ever did it once he
[37:21] can do it again
[37:22] now you may have a need on your life
[37:24] today and whatever it is if you just
[37:26] lift that to the lord and
[37:28] lord i i have this need or i know about
[37:30] this need i
[37:31] i need you to move in my life today i
[37:34] believe as we pray together that
[37:36] that need will be met today heavenly
[37:38] father
[37:39] lord jesus i pray that you would come
[37:42] and
[37:42] and meet every need today the scripture
[37:45] says that the effectual fervent prayer
[37:47] of a righteous man availeth much
[37:50] lord we're not righteous by what we do
[37:52] or what we can say
[37:54] we're righteous because you have
[37:55] declared that we are righteous if we
[37:57] believe
[37:58] on your word trust your grace we're so
[38:01] grateful for that today
[38:03] lord i pray that every every person
[38:06] every situation lord every need would be
[38:09] met
[38:10] lord if it's healing of the body if it's
[38:11] healing of the mind if it's
[38:13] the healing of a family oh god would you
[38:16] just meet that need this morning
[38:19] lord maybe as your word is being
[38:20] preached today healing can begin to take
[38:23] place things can begin to happen
[38:25] lord and while we're together together
[38:27] like they were in the book of acts
[38:29] the place was shaken lord by the power
[38:31] of god
[38:32] may it be so here this morning lord
[38:36] and we can say like peter did he has
[38:39] forgiven me he's delivered me he brought
[38:41] me out of prison
[38:43] walk right up to the prayer meeting
[38:44] maybe so today we believe you're still
[38:46] doing these things today
[38:47] and we thank you for what you have done
[38:49] and what you'll continue to do

[40:16] him there on so they put their their
[40:19] garments their outer their coats and
[40:21] they laid them all
[40:21] over on the the donkey they set him
[40:24] there on at a very great multitude
[40:26] spread their garments in the way
[40:28] others cut down branches from the trees
[40:30] and strawed them in the way
[40:32] and the multitudes that went before and
[40:34] that followed cried
[40:35] saying hosanna to the son of david
[40:38] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[40:40] the lord
[40:41] hosanna in the highest and when he was
[40:44] coming to jerusalem all the city was
[40:46] moved
[40:48] saying who is this
[40:51] who is this that's what i'd like to take
[40:53] for a title this morning
[40:54] who is this i pray the lord would add
[40:57] his blessing to the word you may be
[40:58] seated
[41:05] jerusalem was always crowded on holy
[41:07] days
[41:08] and the jews had many holy days there
[41:10] was pentecost and
[41:12] and there was the feast of tabernacles
[41:14] and the feast of atonement
[41:16] there were many holy days that the jews
[41:19] had but passover was special
[41:22] passover was a remembrance of the
[41:24] deliverance
[41:25] that they had had from egypt
[41:29] and the jews taught their children and
[41:31] still do today that
[41:32] they should remember passover as if
[41:36] that they were the ones who were
[41:37] delivered
[41:39] and i think we can take that a step
[41:41] further because
[41:42] we were the ones who were delivered we
[41:46] are the ones who were delivered from
[41:48] spiritual bondage but
[41:50] they taught them that that they were
[41:52] they should remember it that way and so
[41:54] it was always a great time and
[41:55] the people would all come together
[41:57] historians tell us as many as one
[41:59] million people
[42:01] came in the city of jerusalem a city
[42:03] about the size maybe of jonesboro in
[42:05] that time and
[42:06] and a million people come to that city
[42:08] for the passover feast
[42:11] it was a memorial of what god had done
[42:13] and so i can imagine the
[42:15] the parents brought their little little
[42:17] girls up and made special dresses
[42:19] and and they brought their little
[42:20] children kind of like we would for
[42:22] easter and
[42:23] bring them around one another and and
[42:26] they would bring them up and and prepare
[42:27] everything just right and make sure that
[42:29] the meal was just right and everything
[42:31] was done just right
[42:33] because it was a special time and
[42:34] there's something about a special time
[42:37] like we're going to have on easter with
[42:39] a with a meeting and a special speaker
[42:42] we have coming up there's something
[42:43] about that that builds anticipation
[42:46] and so they always expected something to
[42:48] happen
[42:50] perhaps passover would be the time that
[42:52] the messiah would make an appearance
[42:55] and they needed to deliver they needed
[42:58] somebody who would
[42:59] who would stand in there against rome
[43:01] and somebody would deliver them
[43:04] what they didn't realize that god was
[43:06] not sending a political
[43:08] deliverance but he was sending a
[43:10] deliverance from sin
[43:13] amen and what we need today is not a
[43:15] political deliverance so the world
[43:17] is looking for that but what we need is
[43:20] a deliverance from sin
[43:22] what this world needs is a deliverance
[43:24] from sin because if you get
[43:26] delivered from sin if you if you get out
[43:29] from under the bondage of
[43:31] of the old man of the old and carnal
[43:33] nature you'll find that
[43:35] the the ballrooms begin to dry up and
[43:38] and the dance halls begin to close and
[43:40] the and the
[43:41] the drugs begin to not be a problem why
[43:44] people get delivered from sin
[43:47] we don't have a a problem with all those
[43:50] things we have a sin
[43:51] problem but the world will never
[43:54] we'll never accept that but we know a
[43:57] deliverance
[43:59] we know a deliverance there's a there's
[44:01] a god that we know and you say brother
[44:03] ben can you say that with insurance yes
[44:05] i can
[44:07] i can say that with assurance because i
[44:09] know it's happened to me
[44:11] the holy ghost is not something we talk
[44:13] about as happening in the scripture
[44:15] but the holy ghost is something with the
[44:17] same that happened to me
[44:19] the old psalm said i i was there when it
[44:22] happened so i guess i ought to know
[44:26] but it wasn't just an experience you
[44:28] understand
[44:29] but it's a change in my life and it's a
[44:32] change in your life and when it happens
[44:33] then
[44:34] you can look back and say i'm not who i
[44:36] used to be
[44:37] i've changed i've been delivered from
[44:40] these things that held me down
[44:42] i've been delivered from all these
[44:44] things that i'm not i've not come into
[44:46] bondage
[44:47] see religion brings you into bondage
[44:50] right and it comes when you say well if
[44:52] i come to church i'll obey this and this
[44:54] and this
[44:55] religion brings you into bondage but
[44:57] christ came to deliver you from bondage
[45:01] amen no i'm not amating myself but amen
[45:05] means so be it
[45:09] now something was about to happen
[45:12] and they didn't know exactly what it was
[45:15] but there was an
[45:16] air of expectation in the city
[45:20] kind of like it is now people know
[45:24] that there's something going on
[45:27] and it affects the mood of the world
[45:28] everybody you talk to
[45:30] everybody knows but eric there's
[45:31] something is going on
[45:33] people realize that but they don't know
[45:35] what
[45:37] right so something is happening
[45:40] something's happening today
[45:41] that was a junction time in history they
[45:43] didn't know it
[45:44] but the most important events in history
[45:46] were about to take place that week
[45:50] and we're approaching a junction like
[45:51] that too
[45:53] we're approaching the rapture of the
[45:54] church we don't know what day or hour
[45:57] that'll take place but we can see
[45:59] the signs all around us we can see the
[46:01] things happening in the world
[46:02] and we see the the trouble the earth is
[46:04] going through and and as we see those
[46:06] things the scripture teaches us that
[46:08] when you begin to see these things
[46:10] coming on the earth jesus said look
[46:13] amen he didn't say get in despair fall
[46:16] into depression begin to worry
[46:18] but he said look up amen because you're
[46:20] delivering stronghold nigh
[46:22] amen hallelujah
[46:25] so there was an expectation but people
[46:27] didn't know for what
[46:29] were the romans going to come in and
[46:30] destroy them
[46:32] maybe there was a messiah out there
[46:34] somewhere
[46:35] and there was whispers maybe around they
[46:38] communicated with one another like
[46:39] people do today and they talked
[46:40] they had heard of a prophet in galilee a
[46:43] man who had healed the sick and raised
[46:45] the dead
[46:46] the story began to come in as we'll see
[46:48] later of lazarus and how that he was
[46:50] raised from the dead
[46:51] that was something that hadn't happened
[46:54] many years
[46:55] it's been many years since a prophet had
[46:57] come that had that kind of a power and
[46:59] ability
[47:00] to raise the dead and so there was a
[47:02] buzz there was an anticipation
[47:05] prophecy was about to become history
[47:09] and it caused an attraction on a
[47:11] mountain if we could say it that way as
[47:13] they come to the mount of olives
[47:15] it was stirring and the bible tells us
[47:17] that the entire
[47:18] city was moved and that word moved is
[47:22] and the original is stirred shaken like
[47:25] by an earthquake
[47:28] even jerusalem frozen with religious
[47:31] formalism
[47:32] and socially undemonstrative was stirred
[47:36] with enthusiasm as by a mighty wind
[47:41] or an earthquake
[47:45] stirred the heat was being turned up huh
[47:52] it gets kind of warm kind of warm in
[47:53] here this morning it gets kind of warm
[47:54] sometimes people begin to stir
[47:58] people begin to move brother branham
[48:01] tells the story about
[48:02] when he was little about having an old
[48:04] uh a turtle and he said they couldn't
[48:06] get that turtle to move for nothing but
[48:07] then they built a fire under him
[48:10] and the turtle moved that's kind of
[48:12] cruel to the poor turtle but you
[48:14] understand that
[48:15] it'll there's there's something that'll
[48:16] make you move and the city felt
[48:19] that anticipation that heat that that
[48:22] like we're feeling today
[48:24] something's about to take place
[48:27] what was it god was fulfilling his word
[48:31] amen and this was not done in a corner
[48:34] as paul tells agrippa later
[48:35] this thing was not done in a corner it
[48:37] wasn't done in such a way where no one
[48:39] knew
[48:40] people knew but they still didn't
[48:42] understand
[48:44] so they said who is this he said
[48:48] he must be some said he must be a crazy
[48:51] person
[48:52] he must be some said he was a devil
[48:54] beelzebub
[48:57] and so there was all kinds of different
[48:58] reactions but there were some
[49:01] who believed you see god was fulfilling
[49:04] his word that's why the city was stirred
[49:07] and the people went to the religious
[49:09] hierarchy of that day which would have
[49:10] been the pharisees of the sadducees
[49:12] which were like different denominations
[49:14] there among the jews they went to the
[49:16] jewish people that day
[49:17] and they come to him and they said who
[49:19] is this
[49:21] and see the jewish leaders had to give
[49:24] an account for it
[49:26] there's got to be a reason why it
[49:27] happened
[49:29] if god sent a supernatural force into
[49:32] the world there's got to be a reason why
[49:33] it's there
[49:35] and the jewish leaders tried to give an
[49:37] account for it but they couldn't
[49:40] they couldn't account for it it didn't
[49:41] fit their program
[49:43] it didn't fit what they believed so they
[49:46] had to say he was the devil
[49:49] but the people said who is this they
[49:52] didn't understand that prophecy was
[49:54] being fulfilled
[49:55] the prophecy of zechariah 9 9 when it
[49:57] says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion
[49:59] shout
[50:00] o daughter of jerusalem behold your king
[50:02] cometh unto thee
[50:04] your king cometh unto thee he is just
[50:06] and having salvation lowly
[50:08] riding upon an ash and upon a cult the
[50:09] full of an ass it was exactly the
[50:11] prophecy
[50:12] that would be fulfilled right but you've
[50:15] got to believe when god does something
[50:18] or it doesn't do you any good right if
[50:20] god actually fulfills the prophecy in
[50:22] front of you
[50:23] you've got to be willing to say that was
[50:25] god
[50:26] because if you don't you'll you'll never
[50:28] be able to accept it and so
[50:30] when god does something in front of us
[50:32] we have to be able to say
[50:33] that's god and i want us to look at
[50:36] prophecy being fulfilled because
[50:38] prophecy did not stop being fulfilled 2
[50:40] 000 years ago
[50:42] right there's prophecies yet to be
[50:44] fulfilled and many things that have been
[50:45] fulfilled in our day
[50:47] i want to look at at the jews first
[50:49] there's a great example of prophecy
[50:51] being fulfilled
[50:52] and then we'll look at some prophecy
[50:53] being fulfilled in our day before we
[50:55] move on
[50:56] into our subject this morning now the
[50:59] jews
[51:00] is a great example and one specific
[51:02] prophecy because there's very
[51:04] very many prophecies about the jews
[51:07] returned to israel which we've seen in
[51:10] the last hundred years
[51:13] we've seen that all of you have
[51:15] witnessed in your lifetime
[51:17] prophecy being fulfilled
[51:20] and a few of you are old enough to
[51:22] remember when
[51:24] palestine wasn't a state
[51:29] i'm not going to point you out but a few
[51:30] of you are
[51:33] i see some raising their hands back
[51:35] there but see
[51:37] you can remember when israel wasn't a
[51:40] state when they didn't have a flag
[51:42] but now there's a flag flying there why
[51:45] of all the groups of people in the world
[51:47] if you look at the
[51:49] significance of the jewish people as
[51:51] compared to their numbers they don't
[51:52] match up
[51:54] why because it's god's chosen people
[51:57] right and we understand that today
[51:59] we're in the time of grace to the
[52:01] gentiles i'm sorry glad for that
[52:04] so glad for that but the bible teaches
[52:05] us romans chapter 11. if you want to
[52:07] write that down or go look at it
[52:09] romans chapter 11 teaches us that the
[52:11] the
[52:12] the scripture tells us that the gospel
[52:15] goes back to the jews
[52:16] that there will be a time when they will
[52:19] be saved as a nation now
[52:20] but isaiah 27 12 speaks of a specific
[52:22] prophecy it says
[52:24] it shall come to pass in that day that
[52:25] the lord shall beat off from the channel
[52:27] of the river
[52:28] and what he's saying there the lord
[52:29] shall beat off he's talking about a man
[52:31] would take a
[52:32] a stalk of wheat and take a stick
[52:35] and beat it right and the wheat seed
[52:38] would fall out
[52:40] right and so he said the lord should
[52:42] beat off from the channel of the river
[52:43] into the stream of egypt
[52:44] so he'll actually he'll actually beat it
[52:47] off it'll
[52:48] it'll have to fall to the ground and
[52:51] that's that persecution that would
[52:52] always come to the jews outside of their
[52:54] homeland
[52:56] and so he said from the river into the
[52:58] stream of egypt and you should be
[53:00] gathered
[53:00] one by one or you children of israel
[53:04] the next verse it shall come to pass in
[53:06] that day that the great trumpet shall be
[53:07] blown
[53:08] and they shall come which were ready to
[53:10] perish in the land notice of assyria
[53:12] and the outcast in the land of egypt
[53:15] that said there will be a trumpet blow
[53:18] and then those that will come which were
[53:20] ready to perish in the land of assyria
[53:22] now that's modern-day iraq and turkey
[53:26] and the outcast in the land of egypt we
[53:29] know what egypt is today
[53:31] and shall worship the lord in the holy
[53:34] mount
[53:35] at jerusalem
[53:38] now in 1948
[53:44] there were about 75 000 jews
[53:48] in egypt after the establishment of the
[53:52] state of israel the egyptian government
[53:54] began to pressure the jewish community
[53:56] detaining expelling or
[53:58] expropriating the property of thousands
[54:02] and by the time of the six day war in
[54:03] 1967
[54:05] egyptian jews had fanned out over the
[54:06] world
[54:08] but you know how many there are in egypt
[54:10] today how many jews there are in egypt
[54:13] today
[54:14] ten
[54:18] ten jews in the entire nation of israel
[54:21] go back to that scripture
[54:23] or entire nation of egypt i'm sorry go
[54:25] back to that isaiah 27 if you can
[54:28] 13. what did he say
[54:31] those that were ready to perish in the
[54:33] land of assyria
[54:34] the outcasts in the land of egypt shall
[54:36] worship the lord
[54:38] in the holy mount of jerusalem we've
[54:40] seen prophecy fulfilled
[54:43] literally in our day
[54:46] it said assyria as well let's go back to
[54:48] that picture if you will
[54:49] that's ancient that's iraq now
[54:52] and and especially the area of kurdistan
[54:54] if you see that and
[54:56] and there's very few jews left there but
[54:58] in iraq particularly which is most of
[55:00] ancient assyria
[55:02] today there are less than 10.
[55:06] jews in 1948 there were a hundred and
[55:10] fifty thousand
[55:14] you think about that what would make
[55:16] that happen
[55:18] he said well it was political forces it
[55:20] was all these things
[55:22] but there's a almost 3 000 year old
[55:25] prophecy
[55:28] that said it would happen you understand
[55:32] and it's come to pass and so it gives us
[55:34] confidence we know god keeps his word
[55:37] and if god keeps his word to the jews
[55:39] how much more will he keep his word
[55:40] to his bride to his people to his church
[55:45] god keeps his word and and so let's look
[55:48] at god keeping his word and we know
[55:50] there's
[55:50] many prophecies of the end time and you
[55:52] can go into daniel you can go to daniel
[55:54] chapter 12 verse 4.
[55:56] when you go to matthew 17 11 you can go
[55:59] to malachi 4 5 and 6 you go to luke 17
[56:02] 30. but i want to look at revelations
[56:04] chapter 10
[56:06] and verse one and these are prophecies
[56:08] of the end times so at the end of the
[56:10] gentile dispensation
[56:11] the bible tells us that there would come
[56:13] something
[56:14] that would uh that would reveal the
[56:16] mysteries there would come an
[56:18] understanding of the word of god at the
[56:20] end time and
[56:21] and that would come and as promised and
[56:24] even if you go back in the old
[56:25] commentaries and stuff they understood
[56:26] that it was promised to come
[56:28] that there would come an understanding
[56:29] and yet the denominational world today
[56:32] is as fractured as it's ever been good
[56:34] people you understand good people
[56:37] and so it's not the people at all but
[56:38] the world the world leaders religious
[56:40] leaders are as fractured
[56:42] as they've ever been so it's much like
[56:43] they were on that day
[56:45] on this day which is palm sunday all
[56:47] those years ago
[56:48] when they said who is this
[56:51] right and they have they don't know what
[56:53] what to what to look at and what
[56:54] prophecy is
[56:55] to be fulfilled in this hour because
[56:56] there's many prophecies there was a
[56:58] prophecy that told noah to go build a
[56:59] boat
[57:01] right but if we go and do that today you
[57:03] know we don't have a promise of rain
[57:05] that prophecy has been fulfilled
[57:07] what did he say i won't destroy the
[57:08] earth with water again
[57:10] but i'm coming to destroy the earth with
[57:12] fire so there's got to be something that
[57:14] god tells
[57:15] us for our generation and we know the
[57:18] main thing is to be
[57:19] to be saved to be filled with the holy
[57:22] ghost you understand
[57:24] because if you're filled with the holy
[57:25] spirit and we'll get into that but he'll
[57:27] lead you and guide you into all truth
[57:30] right he'll show you what prophecy is
[57:31] being fulfilled in your day but let's
[57:33] look at this one
[57:34] because i believe this was fulfilled in
[57:35] our day revelation 10 and 1
[57:37] i saw another mighty angel come down
[57:39] from the heaven clothed with a cloud and
[57:41] a rainbow was upon his head
[57:42] notice he was clothed with a cloud a
[57:45] rainbow was upon his head his face was
[57:46] as it were the sun his feet as pillars
[57:48] of fire
[57:49] he had in his hand a little book open he
[57:51] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[57:53] left foot on the earth
[57:54] and he cried with a loud voice as when a
[57:56] lion roars
[57:58] when he had cried seven thunders uttered
[57:59] their voices
[58:01] when the seven thunders had uttered
[58:02] their voices i was about to write
[58:04] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[58:06] unto me seal up those things which the
[58:07] seven thunders uttered
[58:09] write them not this is a theme in
[58:10] scripture go back to daniel chapter 12
[58:12] and verse four and you'll find the same
[58:14] thing
[58:14] where he said there will come a time
[58:15] this will be understood but not now
[58:19] right so he hears these seven thunders
[58:20] he said seal up those things
[58:23] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[58:26] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[58:27] hand to heaven
[58:28] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[58:30] ever who created heaven and the things
[58:32] that therein are
[58:33] and the earth and the things that
[58:34] therein are and the sea and the things
[58:36] which are therein
[58:37] that there should be time no longer and
[58:40] if you go back in the originals no more
[58:42] delay
[58:44] no more delay this is it
[58:48] they didn't realize it but this was it
[58:50] for them this was the end of the jewish
[58:53] as jesus wrote in it was the end of that
[58:55] jewish dispensation in the beginning
[58:57] of the gentile dispensation they didn't
[59:00] know it but this was it
[59:02] oh god if we could just recognize today
[59:04] people don't know it but this is it
[59:08] we're right there and you say well
[59:10] brother ben i i can't see that but just
[59:12] ask god to reveal it to you and then if
[59:13] you can't see it then that's that's
[59:15] between you and god i
[59:16] don't de-christianize you for that but
[59:18] this is what god has revealed to my
[59:20] heart
[59:21] i believe that in the end time that
[59:23] something has taken place and we're
[59:24] right at the end
[59:26] i'll say this if you can't see it you go
[59:28] be just as good a christian as you can
[59:29] be
[59:31] right and i say that to all of us and no
[59:33] matter you you may acknowledge the
[59:35] mysteries to be revealed and not be a
[59:36] real christian then you got a problem
[59:39] right you'd be a good christian that's
[59:41] the first thing but then we believe
[59:43] these things now
[59:44] now look he said and he swear that these
[59:47] things
[59:47] that there should be time no longer
[59:49] these things would take place
[59:51] verse seven but in the days of the voice
[59:53] of the seventh angel
[59:55] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[59:58] of god should be finished
[1:00:00] as he has declared to his servants
[1:00:03] the prophets the mystery of god will be
[1:00:06] finished there come a time
[1:00:08] when the truth of it will be known amen
[1:00:12] and so i brought a picture of this
[1:00:14] because i believe this was a fulfillment
[1:00:16] in our day if we go back i say our day
[1:00:18] before i was born but if you go back
[1:00:20] to 1963 this was in life magazine in
[1:00:23] 1963 a picture of a cloud
[1:00:27] and it happened on sunset mountain in
[1:00:29] arizona around the time that brother
[1:00:31] branham
[1:00:32] was there and and he received the
[1:00:35] inspiration
[1:00:36] for preaching the seven seals and so
[1:00:39] he's there
[1:00:40] on the mountain around that time and
[1:00:43] then something is shown in the heavens
[1:00:45] and there's a
[1:00:46] there's a cloud now if you look at it in
[1:00:49] the next picture
[1:00:51] he looked at that he said oh that's nice
[1:00:52] but he didn't realize what it was
[1:00:55] who is this but something turn it to the
[1:00:58] right
[1:00:59] look at that it's christ
[1:01:03] and i think you'd probably get that if i
[1:01:05] didn't tell you and if you look at the
[1:01:07] picture we have of hoffman's head of
[1:01:09] christ
[1:01:10] it's christ it looks just like him
[1:01:13] and we know that that's an artist's
[1:01:14] conception but there if you look at the
[1:01:17] profile of it it looks just like christ
[1:01:19] and you say well it's just a cloud but
[1:01:21] see you've got to see what what's god
[1:01:23] doing there's many things that could
[1:01:25] happen
[1:01:25] may not signify anything many strange
[1:01:28] things happen in the world
[1:01:30] but if you see something happening like
[1:01:31] that and god
[1:01:33] bring a message out at the same time
[1:01:36] then you have to begin to
[1:01:37] question who is this what's happening on
[1:01:40] mount sunset
[1:01:42] god confirming his word and we'll move
[1:01:45] on in just a moment but i want to get
[1:01:47] this he said that's what all this noise
[1:01:48] is about
[1:01:49] notice it's god fulfilling his promised
[1:01:51] word again of revelation 10 1-7
[1:01:54] and in the days of the sounding of the
[1:01:55] seventh angels message the mystery of
[1:01:57] god should be finished
[1:01:58] the hidden mystery of revelation 10 1-7
[1:02:00] the last message to the last church age
[1:02:02] i feel like i'm echoing just a little
[1:02:04] bit on the sound maybe
[1:02:06] i'm just too loud i feel good
[1:02:10] i you know and lately i have i you know
[1:02:14] i don't want to call myself fat because
[1:02:16] i but
[1:02:17] my kids call me fat so i guess melody
[1:02:19] especially
[1:02:21] but she don't even remember when i was
[1:02:23] skinny
[1:02:26] i feel good i've been out walking and
[1:02:28] and and doing things getting
[1:02:29] and losing weight and not eating as much
[1:02:31] and that that always helps so i feel
[1:02:33] good
[1:02:34] and so i tend to yell at you a little
[1:02:35] bit more and i'm sorry about that
[1:02:39] but i believe we we serve a god that's
[1:02:40] worth shouting about
[1:02:44] amen but look he said
[1:02:48] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:02:49] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[1:02:51] god should be finished
[1:02:52] the hidden mystery and he said in luke
[1:02:54] 17 30 when the son of man shall be
[1:02:56] revealed
[1:02:57] and the god of heaven promised the
[1:02:59] evening time would have evening lights
[1:03:02] three years ago this mystery was a
[1:03:03] prophecy this brother random in 1965
[1:03:05] because he had prophesied that it would
[1:03:07] happen in 1962
[1:03:09] and a sermon called what time is it sir
[1:03:11] he said but now it's history it's past
[1:03:13] the promise is fulfilled what time is it
[1:03:15] sir what's this attraction
[1:03:17] god fulfilling his word
[1:03:20] now let's go back to that day
[1:03:23] there were three groups of people that
[1:03:25] saw jesus come in
[1:03:28] writing fulfilling the scripture
[1:03:31] three groups of people the first group
[1:03:33] was the smallest group
[1:03:36] and they were the real believers they
[1:03:38] believed
[1:03:39] that this was the fulfillment of
[1:03:41] scripture maybe if they didn't even
[1:03:42] fully understand it when they saw it
[1:03:45] later they knew and that's something we
[1:03:47] have to remember is people
[1:03:49] you're not going to understand
[1:03:50] everything right away
[1:03:52] right there's some things i don't
[1:03:53] understand today
[1:03:55] but you pray and ask god to lead you to
[1:03:58] that because the word is always right
[1:04:01] because christ the authority that he
[1:04:04] left us is
[1:04:05] the word of god and and that is god in
[1:04:08] in book form if we could say it that way
[1:04:10] and so the word of god is always right
[1:04:12] we always take everything back to the
[1:04:13] word but we believe that the word has
[1:04:16] been fulfilled there's some that believe
[1:04:19] now you say well it's strange it'll be a
[1:04:22] small amount of people
[1:04:24] what always has been in fact jesus told
[1:04:27] his disciples
[1:04:29] who were only at the end 12
[1:04:32] and all of them ran away
[1:04:37] but at the end jesus told his disciples
[1:04:39] in luke chapter 12
[1:04:40] and verse 32 he said fear not little
[1:04:43] flock
[1:04:45] doesn't that give you courage and
[1:04:47] encouragement today
[1:04:49] fear not little flock for it is your
[1:04:52] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:04:53] kingdom
[1:04:55] not everybody can see it not everybody
[1:04:56] can understand but little flock
[1:04:58] fear not amen amen and
[1:05:02] and you find a place in scripture and i
[1:05:03] don't have the scripture this morning
[1:05:05] but it's
[1:05:06] jesus said jesus rejoiced in his spirit
[1:05:08] and he said father i thank you
[1:05:10] that you've hid these things from the
[1:05:11] eyes of the wives and the prudent
[1:05:13] the people who should have understood it
[1:05:15] and revealed it to babies
[1:05:18] amen amen see if you really want to know
[1:05:22] something from god you have to become
[1:05:23] dependent on him
[1:05:26] that's what a baby is a baby's dependent
[1:05:28] on god he's dependent on god that's the
[1:05:30] way abraham became became in the old
[1:05:32] testament
[1:05:32] he said i am i am el shaddai i'm the
[1:05:35] breasted one is what he was telling him
[1:05:37] you're
[1:05:38] abraham you're like a little baby you
[1:05:40] may be 80 years old but to me you're
[1:05:41] like a little baby
[1:05:42] he says depend on me i won't show you
[1:05:46] everything at once but if you'll depend
[1:05:47] on me
[1:05:48] i'll lead you through life i'll guide
[1:05:50] you if you'll depend on me
[1:05:52] but if you lean on your own
[1:05:53] understanding the scripture says you'll
[1:05:55] be like a heath in the desert you won't
[1:05:56] know where to go what to do you'll blow
[1:05:58] every which direction but if you depend
[1:06:00] on god you'll be like a tree planted by
[1:06:03] the rivers of water
[1:06:04] there'll be fruit come out of your life
[1:06:08] luke 6 26 whoa unto you when all men
[1:06:12] shall speak well of you
[1:06:14] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:06:15] prophets you say well if this was true
[1:06:18] that jesus was the one who was coming
[1:06:20] then men would speak well of him the
[1:06:22] pharisees would understand no it would
[1:06:25] be exactly the opposite
[1:06:27] because the ones they spoke well of and
[1:06:31] jesus he takes a turn of phrase there
[1:06:32] and says
[1:06:33] so did their fathers to the false
[1:06:35] prophets
[1:06:37] they spoke well of the false prophets
[1:06:40] they still do today that was the
[1:06:43] smallest group they believed him
[1:06:45] jesus preached in the synagogue at
[1:06:47] capernaum and remember his sermon
[1:06:48] was about eat my flesh and drink my
[1:06:50] blood
[1:06:51] that was a mystery that was a step too
[1:06:53] far for jews
[1:06:55] right because it was against jewish
[1:06:57] tradition and law
[1:06:59] but they didn't understand it in a
[1:07:01] spiritual sense jesus said something
[1:07:03] would seem to conflict with the law
[1:07:06] and so they he said eat my flesh and
[1:07:08] drink my blood and they were troubled by
[1:07:10] that i said
[1:07:10] who can understand this and he said if
[1:07:13] you don't like
[1:07:14] that he said what what what will happen
[1:07:16] when you see the son of man
[1:07:17] standing up from where he came
[1:07:21] well that just threw him and he and the
[1:07:23] scripture says that
[1:07:24] from that time john 6 66 from that time
[1:07:27] many of his disciples went back and
[1:07:29] walked no more with him
[1:07:31] most went back and then said jesus
[1:07:35] unto the twelve because remember he had
[1:07:36] seventy who had ordained his ministry
[1:07:40] and they all went back with the 12
[1:07:43] and then said jesus unto the twelve will
[1:07:45] you also go away
[1:07:47] and then simon peter answered him and
[1:07:48] said lord to whom shall we go
[1:07:52] i love his i love his honesty
[1:07:56] i got nothing to go back to
[1:08:01] if i didn't believe this everybody got
[1:08:02] something they say is right
[1:08:04] but i got to believe something right
[1:08:08] and you're the only one who i've ever
[1:08:09] found that has the words of eternal life
[1:08:13] i get into that word and it tells me it
[1:08:14] tells me things about my family
[1:08:16] it helps me when i'm sick and in need
[1:08:18] and in trouble and there's a word for
[1:08:20] that god
[1:08:21] provided his word to us he said you
[1:08:22] alone have the words of eternal life
[1:08:26] lord you're the only one i can trust he
[1:08:28] says
[1:08:29] and we believe and are sure that thou
[1:08:32] art that christ
[1:08:34] the son of the living god
[1:08:37] look what was the attitude of this group
[1:08:39] as they saw him
[1:08:40] imagine with me that they here they can
[1:08:43] see
[1:08:44] there's a moving there's a rumbling
[1:08:46] coming and the true believer is standing
[1:08:48] there
[1:08:48] waiting on him as he comes down the
[1:08:51] mountain
[1:08:53] listen luke 19 37 tells some more of the
[1:08:56] story we read in matthew here it is in
[1:08:58] luke
[1:08:58] it said when he was come nigh even now
[1:09:01] at the descent of the mount of olives
[1:09:02] he's coming down
[1:09:04] the whole multitude of the disciples
[1:09:06] began to rejoice
[1:09:07] who did the disciples did
[1:09:11] amen why because
[1:09:14] they realized or there was something in
[1:09:16] them that responded to prophecy being
[1:09:18] fulfilled
[1:09:19] even if they didn't know it mentally
[1:09:22] because the scripture tells us that
[1:09:24] later on they realized this is what
[1:09:25] happened
[1:09:27] right and so the whole multitude began
[1:09:29] to rejoice and praise god with a loud
[1:09:31] voice for all the mighty works that they
[1:09:33] had seen saying blessed be the king
[1:09:35] that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:09:36] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[1:09:39] but remember what the prophecy said not
[1:09:41] only was he fulfilling scripture
[1:09:44] but they were fulfilling scripture
[1:09:48] why because it says rejoice because your
[1:09:51] king comes to you
[1:09:54] rejoice because your king comes to you
[1:09:56] so by rejoicing they were fulfilling
[1:09:59] the scripture just like he was right and
[1:10:02] so that that had to take place now
[1:10:04] they were fulfilling the word the
[1:10:06] prophecy said rejoice they rejoice
[1:10:08] and so psalm 74 tells us let all those
[1:10:11] that seek thee i'm one that seeks the
[1:10:13] lord
[1:10:14] let all those who seek thee rejoice and
[1:10:16] be glad in thee
[1:10:17] let such as love thy salvation say
[1:10:20] continually
[1:10:21] let god be magnified
[1:10:24] see and that would not be strange to the
[1:10:27] early church
[1:10:28] they would understand i'm gonna take
[1:10:31] this off again
[1:10:32] they would understand what
[1:10:36] he was talking about because they did it
[1:10:39] amen but today if someone rejoiced
[1:10:42] in church everybody look around and see
[1:10:46] who it was so they could get rid of them
[1:10:49] that's a fanatic but let all those that
[1:10:52] seek thee
[1:10:53] rejoice and be glad in thee let such as
[1:10:57] love thy salvation
[1:10:58] amen those those that love thy salvation
[1:11:02] say continually let god be magnified
[1:11:05] amen jonah was in the belly of
[1:11:09] a fish one time now you talk you say
[1:11:11] brother ben you don't understand my
[1:11:13] circumstances you don't know where i'm
[1:11:14] coming from
[1:11:15] jonah's in the belly of a fish
[1:11:18] that's some circumstances right there
[1:11:22] you talk about a trial getting swallowed
[1:11:25] by a fish because of your own
[1:11:27] stubbornness that's a trial to go
[1:11:28] through right there
[1:11:32] and jonah's going through that hard time
[1:11:34] in his life he says well the only thing
[1:11:35] i know to do is go to church
[1:11:39] i don't understand it i don't know why
[1:11:41] i'm everywhere i look
[1:11:42] well's belly everywhere i look i'm in
[1:11:44] the stomach of a fish
[1:11:48] i'm looking around everywhere i look
[1:11:49] there's wells belly i don't understand
[1:11:50] what's going on
[1:11:51] all i can do is go to church so he said
[1:11:54] okay
[1:11:55] by faith i'm going to turn my myself
[1:11:57] towards the temple
[1:11:59] and then he began to pray and as he
[1:12:01] prayed he said this he said
[1:12:03] in in jonah 2 8 he said they that
[1:12:05] observed lying vanities
[1:12:07] forsake their own mercy
[1:12:10] the whale's belly was a lying vanity the
[1:12:13] symptoms that he was going through the
[1:12:15] the circumstances that was around him
[1:12:17] was all lying vanity we look out today
[1:12:19] and see coronavirus we look out and we
[1:12:21] see all the problems that are in the
[1:12:22] world today
[1:12:23] all the the hate and the and the fear
[1:12:25] and the people have for one another and
[1:12:27] the racial violence and all the things
[1:12:28] that are going on
[1:12:29] but that's not us what can we do in a
[1:12:32] situation like that what can we do
[1:12:34] in a time when families involved in and
[1:12:35] people are involved in it
[1:12:37] be all around us people are stirred up
[1:12:39] in every kind of a way
[1:12:40] and we look at that and everywhere we
[1:12:41] see we see symptoms of a culture that's
[1:12:43] gone bad
[1:12:45] what do we see what are we gonna do he
[1:12:47] said but i will sacrifice unto thee with
[1:12:50] the voice of thanksgiving
[1:12:54] it's a sacrifice because i'm in a
[1:12:55] whale's belly it's a sacrifice
[1:12:58] because i'm going through some hard
[1:12:59] times life hasn't been easy
[1:13:01] i've been i know some of you have been
[1:13:02] through it i know some of you have
[1:13:04] struggled in your life but it's not been
[1:13:05] easy but
[1:13:06] it's because it's not been easy that
[1:13:08] it's a sacrifice
[1:13:12] i will sacrifice unto me with the voice
[1:13:14] of thanksgiving
[1:13:15] i will pay that i have vowed salvation
[1:13:18] is of the lord
[1:13:20] amen and the lord's spaking to the fish
[1:13:25] sometimes he's just waiting on you to
[1:13:26] rejoice in the middle of your
[1:13:27] circumstances
[1:13:29] and the lord speaking to the fish and it
[1:13:31] vomited out jonah on the dry land
[1:13:34] he said brother ben them thinks you talk
[1:13:35] about a hard to believe well this is
[1:13:37] hard to believe
[1:13:39] unless you're a believer
[1:13:42] right you have to believe something when
[1:13:46] you cross a bridge you've got to have
[1:13:47] the faith to believe it's going to hold
[1:13:49] and you don't even know who built it
[1:13:53] i cross this bridge down here by not far
[1:13:56] from the church
[1:13:57] the one that goes across the river you
[1:13:59] know if you cross that old bridge i
[1:14:01] think they're redoing it now
[1:14:02] i crossed that bridge of my truck one
[1:14:04] day i didn't realize what kind of bridge
[1:14:06] that was
[1:14:07] and that thing's 100 years old and it
[1:14:10] moves when you go across it
[1:14:12] and the concrete's broke and the water's
[1:14:14] rushing and i crossed that when the
[1:14:16] water was up and i said man
[1:14:18] i'm not crossing that thing again i
[1:14:20] drove the whole nine mile ridge to get
[1:14:22] out
[1:14:26] they're going to replace that bridge but
[1:14:28] you know we cross a bridge we don't even
[1:14:30] think about it
[1:14:31] most of the time we don't know who built
[1:14:33] it how close it is
[1:14:35] you don't go and find the bridge
[1:14:36] inspections what is that faith
[1:14:39] you got enough confidence in the works
[1:14:41] of man that you're willing to cross the
[1:14:42] bridge
[1:14:44] oh god oh if we could just have enough
[1:14:47] confidence in the works of god
[1:14:49] a god who created the heavens and the
[1:14:50] earth that he'll lead me to the right
[1:14:52] place
[1:14:53] that he'll bring my family out of
[1:14:54] bondage he'll bring me out
[1:14:56] if i can trust him he'll give me the
[1:14:58] desire of my heart
[1:15:02] hallelujah i tell you what church you
[1:15:05] just we're just about ready to break
[1:15:07] through i can tell
[1:15:08] we're just about ready to break through
[1:15:10] there's something about to take place
[1:15:13] amen if you want to see the word
[1:15:15] fulfilled in your day
[1:15:16] get ready to rejoice
[1:15:19] amen amen
[1:15:22] remember the story of the ten lepers in
[1:15:24] luke chapter 17 and verse 14
[1:15:26] it says the lepers come to him remember
[1:15:28] asking to be healed
[1:15:29] when he saw them he said unto them go
[1:15:31] show yourselves unto the priests
[1:15:32] and it came to pass that as they went
[1:15:34] they were cleansed and one of them when
[1:15:36] he saw that he was healed turned back
[1:15:38] and with a loud voice glorified god and
[1:15:41] fell down on his face at his feet
[1:15:43] giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
[1:15:48] look probably the rest of them were jews
[1:15:50] the other nine
[1:15:52] but this one was a samaritan amen
[1:15:55] didn't even have the right religion for
[1:15:57] that day
[1:16:00] amen no wonder he said god would call
[1:16:02] these stones
[1:16:03] to raise up children to abraham that's
[1:16:06] what john told the pharisees
[1:16:10] god he'll bring these stones here's
[1:16:12] where people had no background at all
[1:16:14] had nothing a leper that had no
[1:16:15] background in the right religion at all
[1:16:17] he was taught wrong he was taught a
[1:16:19] different religion and but he fell down
[1:16:21] at the feet of jesus and jesus answered
[1:16:23] he said were there not
[1:16:24] ten cleansed where are the nine
[1:16:29] where are the nine they are not found
[1:16:32] that return to give glory to god
[1:16:34] save this stranger the samaritan
[1:16:37] he said unto him rise
[1:16:40] go thy way thy faith hath made thee
[1:16:43] whole
[1:16:45] you know what's interesting about that
[1:16:47] is that the other lepers
[1:16:48] could say that they obeyed the words of
[1:16:52] jesus better
[1:16:55] think about this for a moment the other
[1:16:58] lepers could say
[1:16:59] we obey the words of jesus we went to
[1:17:01] the priest
[1:17:02] jesus said go to the priest
[1:17:06] but this one amen
[1:17:10] recognized that thanksgiving always
[1:17:13] comes first
[1:17:16] amen worship always comes first
[1:17:23] people today try to live legalistically
[1:17:25] by the letter everything just right but
[1:17:26] they don't recognize
[1:17:30] that what comes first is your attitude
[1:17:33] towards
[1:17:34] christ
[1:17:37] you try to make everything right we want
[1:17:39] everything to be right
[1:17:41] but the one came back he didn't go down
[1:17:44] to the priest
[1:17:44] what did he get amen he said arise go
[1:17:48] thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:17:50] and what that means is has saved thee
[1:17:55] he made thee whole it is actually done
[1:17:58] more
[1:17:58] than deliver you from leprosy the other
[1:18:00] nine were delivered from leprosy
[1:18:03] every one of them went to the priests
[1:18:04] and shown that we were hallelujah praise
[1:18:06] god
[1:18:06] we did what the what jesus required but
[1:18:08] the one
[1:18:10] came back and returned thanks and he was
[1:18:13] saved because of it
[1:18:18] the higher obedience was to give thanks
[1:18:21] that's why in obedience
[1:18:25] sometimes obedience he saul thought
[1:18:27] obedience was sacrificing
[1:18:29] animals he said no i'd rather have
[1:18:32] obedience
[1:18:33] i'd rather just have simple obedience
[1:18:35] and the highest obedience
[1:18:37] is when you get a blessing give thanks
[1:18:44] i think
[1:18:47] brother branham talks about a hog eating
[1:18:48] apples
[1:18:50] my mom mentioned this to me yesterday
[1:18:52] and i've been studying on this but
[1:18:54] you know we get bad about getting in a
[1:18:57] rush i do it i love to eat and
[1:19:00] you set a plate of food down in front of
[1:19:02] me and we were in africa a couple years
[1:19:04] ago and
[1:19:05] i'm sitting there in togo we only ate
[1:19:06] usually once a day and we'd snack a
[1:19:08] little bit
[1:19:09] in the morning for breakfast and we'd
[1:19:10] eat one meal about two o'clock in the
[1:19:12] afternoon because you had to preach that
[1:19:14] night
[1:19:14] you probably wouldn't get back to the
[1:19:15] motel so we kept a few crackers and
[1:19:17] things in the motel
[1:19:18] but it really agreed with me i like that
[1:19:20] that lifestyle because
[1:19:22] it kept you from overeating and things
[1:19:23] like that but every night we were going
[1:19:25] out and preaching and
[1:19:26] coming back and we got in the hotel and
[1:19:28] they set this fish they had to fish and
[1:19:30] i probably showed you the pictures they
[1:19:31] had the fish with the eyes on it and
[1:19:33] the head on it but you wanted the fish
[1:19:35] with a head on it because you knew that
[1:19:36] it was fresh you knew that
[1:19:38] that it was a fish for one they had what
[1:19:41] they call
[1:19:42] meat meat markets but you never know
[1:19:45] what kind of meat
[1:19:47] right so they told us don't buy anything
[1:19:49] at the meat market
[1:19:50] because it might be monkey it might be
[1:19:52] baboon it might be might be
[1:19:54] beef but probably not it might be pork
[1:19:57] you know it might be anything
[1:19:58] and they just hung it outside and you'd
[1:20:01] eat it
[1:20:02] and and but here there was a fish and
[1:20:04] they set that fish down in front of me
[1:20:07] and man i wanted to eat and two or three
[1:20:09] different times
[1:20:10] i started eating and the brothers the
[1:20:14] older ministers that were there with me
[1:20:15] looked at me and said well ben did you
[1:20:17] forget something
[1:20:19] i forgot to pray here i am
[1:20:23] going across the the the
[1:20:26] the oceans to teach people how to be
[1:20:28] obedient
[1:20:29] love god with all their heart and all
[1:20:31] these things and encourage the brethren
[1:20:33] and to see souls saved and
[1:20:34] i forgot to pray over my food and and
[1:20:37] what do we do when we pray over our food
[1:20:38] it's not that it's some magic thing when
[1:20:40] i was a kid i thought that if you didn't
[1:20:41] pray over your food
[1:20:42] lightning would strike you i had that
[1:20:45] image in my head i really thought that
[1:20:46] that would take place
[1:20:48] and it's not actually the case because
[1:20:50] i've forgotten a few times and
[1:20:52] so i know that's not actually the case
[1:20:53] but but what happens is you're honoring
[1:20:56] god
[1:20:57] you're about to have a meal that god
[1:20:59] provided he said well i went out there
[1:21:01] and
[1:21:02] it's like the old story of a farmer
[1:21:03] excuse me for getting away from my notes
[1:21:05] but
[1:21:05] the old story of the farmer worked on
[1:21:07] his 40 acres you know and
[1:21:08] and here it was all grown up and
[1:21:10] overgrown with brush and things he got
[1:21:12] it all cleared off and started producing
[1:21:14] crops on it and
[1:21:15] the preacher come by one day he said he
[1:21:17] said brother john he said look at these
[1:21:20] this wonderful uh place that you have
[1:21:22] the lord's been
[1:21:23] really good to you and he said kept
[1:21:25] telling him oh the lord's blessed you
[1:21:27] and
[1:21:27] and farmer john he just kind of had
[1:21:30] enough of it after a while he said you
[1:21:31] know
[1:21:32] he said you should have seen it when the
[1:21:33] lord had it to himself
[1:21:39] but it's the lord the bible says it
[1:21:41] gives you your strength to work
[1:21:45] eric you said you're planting a garden
[1:21:46] that's the lord that gives you the
[1:21:47] strength to do that
[1:21:48] provide for your family if you're gonna
[1:21:50] if you're gonna whatever it is that you
[1:21:52] do
[1:21:52] and it makes you grateful when you
[1:21:54] realize some people aren't able to do
[1:21:55] that
[1:21:57] but they forgot and brother brown talked
[1:21:59] about somebody i forgot to pray and
[1:22:01] they teased me about that but i was so
[1:22:03] hungry but
[1:22:05] and that's not a good excuse but it is
[1:22:06] my excuse
[1:22:08] i have one too but if you
[1:22:11] pray over your food you return thanks
[1:22:14] brother branham said when you don't do
[1:22:15] that it's like a hog
[1:22:16] at the bottom of an apple tree and the
[1:22:19] apples just keep falling and hitting him
[1:22:21] on the head
[1:22:22] and he's just scorching himself with
[1:22:23] apples and never looks up to see where
[1:22:25] they come from
[1:22:30] oh church we ought to give thanks today
[1:22:33] at easter time we give thanks because he
[1:22:36] rose from the grave
[1:22:42] now there's many that are not genuine
[1:22:43] what about those that are not genuine i
[1:22:45] may not get through all this today but
[1:22:46] we'll go as far as we can
[1:22:50] brother branham says there's been a lot
[1:22:51] of make-believe and put on and the
[1:22:52] reason i'm quoting him here is because
[1:22:55] that was happening in his time you know
[1:22:57] pentecostalism has had a lot of
[1:22:58] fanaticism around it
[1:23:01] and he said there's a lot of make
[1:23:02] believe and put on there was all around
[1:23:04] him
[1:23:05] because every time somebody come with a
[1:23:06] real gift from god for healing or
[1:23:08] something like that there'd be a hundred
[1:23:09] go
[1:23:10] that just wanted money and those are
[1:23:13] still out there today
[1:23:15] you know they want money because every
[1:23:17] 10 seconds there's a thing on the tv
[1:23:19] screen
[1:23:20] telling you to give right
[1:23:24] and and it's not the christian way to
[1:23:26] operate whether you're a message
[1:23:27] believer or not
[1:23:28] if we can't provide what we need to have
[1:23:30] church close to church
[1:23:33] as long as there's if there's not the
[1:23:36] money to keep the lights on and close
[1:23:37] the church you don't beg the people
[1:23:40] because if the people aren't giving in a
[1:23:42] free will way it doesn't
[1:23:44] be good to come anyway so it's got to be
[1:23:47] something that comes from your heart
[1:23:49] and and but they begged for money
[1:23:51] because their their heart wasn't it was
[1:23:53] charlatans so we would say uh hirelings
[1:23:56] is what the scripture calls it
[1:23:57] someone who just does it for the money
[1:23:58] or for some other reason for fame
[1:24:00] there's been a lot of make belief and
[1:24:01] put on you expect that god said it would
[1:24:03] come
[1:24:03] but what's it trying to do if there's a
[1:24:05] bogus dollar it's got to be made off a
[1:24:06] real one
[1:24:08] right you never seen a bogus dollar you
[1:24:10] know somebody you don't try to take
[1:24:11] monopoly money up there and pay for
[1:24:14] something huh if you did they'd laugh at
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:17] but what do they take they take a dollar
[1:24:19] that looks like a real dollar
[1:24:22] and take it up there and try to pass it
[1:24:24] off as a real dollar
[1:24:25] but what that means is there's a real
[1:24:28] dollar
[1:24:30] right they wouldn't try to pass it off
[1:24:31] you know we we have some antiques and
[1:24:34] things and
[1:24:35] old toys i collect old toys and old
[1:24:37] pottery and different things and
[1:24:39] and if you look at those things they
[1:24:40] don't fake the cheap stuff
[1:24:43] they fake the expensive stuff they find
[1:24:46] the most expensive piece and they fake
[1:24:48] that
[1:24:49] because there's a real genuine it's
[1:24:51] worth something
[1:24:54] they're trying to impersonate it there's
[1:24:55] a real genuine somebody he said you've
[1:24:57] seen people claim to have the holy
[1:24:58] spirit live in adultery and drink and
[1:25:00] everything else they haven't got it
[1:25:02] they're trying to impersonate it but
[1:25:03] there's a real genuine somebody that's
[1:25:04] got it
[1:25:05] got the holy spirit and god confirms his
[1:25:07] words with signs following
[1:25:09] now watch now here he comes riding into
[1:25:11] the city
[1:25:12] just exactly what the word said he would
[1:25:14] do
[1:25:16] you believe that today riding on a
[1:25:19] little donkey coming into the city
[1:25:21] here was the real thing and those
[1:25:25] who are not looking at the creed not
[1:25:28] looking at the temple
[1:25:30] not looking at all these other things
[1:25:32] not looking at the priests what they had
[1:25:34] to say
[1:25:34] those that believed him they were
[1:25:38] standing there
[1:25:39] with a palm in their hands a palm branch
[1:25:45] in expectation hallelujah
[1:25:49] they didn't wait on it the emotion to
[1:25:52] pass and then go grab a palm branch
[1:25:54] but the ones who really believed him
[1:25:57] were standing there
[1:25:58] waiting with palms in their hands
[1:26:01] because that's the only way they had
[1:26:01] been able to lay them in front of him
[1:26:04] they went and got palm branches
[1:26:07] not because of the emotion of the moment
[1:26:09] but because they believed
[1:26:13] now the palm branch is a symbol of
[1:26:14] victory
[1:26:16] triumph peace and eternal life in the
[1:26:19] ancient world
[1:26:20] jericho was known as the city of palm
[1:26:22] trees that's where joshua's great
[1:26:24] victory was
[1:26:25] the walls came down at jericho
[1:26:28] and in john 12 17 it tells us of a great
[1:26:32] victory
[1:26:34] and this this it tells us what had
[1:26:36] happened and this is
[1:26:37] the the uh the scripture in john
[1:26:41] that parallels with the ones we read in
[1:26:42] matthew and luke
[1:26:44] it says the people therefore that was
[1:26:45] with him when he called lazarus out of
[1:26:47] his grave and raised him from the dead
[1:26:49] bear record
[1:26:50] for this cause the people also met him
[1:26:53] why did they have a palm branch in their
[1:26:55] hands
[1:26:56] because victory had taken place
[1:27:00] amen victory had taken place
[1:27:03] now they they met him for that they had
[1:27:06] heard that he had done this miracle
[1:27:08] solomon carved palm trees into the walls
[1:27:11] of the temple
[1:27:12] ezekiel sees him in the vision of the
[1:27:13] future temple
[1:27:15] i can imagine if you can imagine what it
[1:27:16] would have been like in that day
[1:27:18] why did they like palm trees well palm
[1:27:20] was a giver of life
[1:27:23] if you were a weary desert traveler
[1:27:27] and you went on for miles all you saw
[1:27:30] was desert
[1:27:31] desert desert i've always people told me
[1:27:34] the beauty of the desert
[1:27:35] well it's only beautiful if there's some
[1:27:36] plants that somehow survive in it
[1:27:40] right because otherwise it's it's pretty
[1:27:42] harsh
[1:27:44] and so in in those deserts you're saying
[1:27:47] sand sand everywhere look rocks and sand
[1:27:50] and the traveler gets so weary that he's
[1:27:53] just about to give
[1:27:54] in just about to give up
[1:27:57] that was the condition of the world in
[1:27:58] that day
[1:28:00] they'd grown so weary they were just
[1:28:02] about to give in
[1:28:03] the the judaism had split into multiple
[1:28:06] denominations sects of
[1:28:08] people that would that were little
[1:28:10] groups of people that were split off
[1:28:11] from one another
[1:28:12] everybody was fighting and fussing and
[1:28:14] romans had come down and brought them
[1:28:16] into bondage
[1:28:16] they were they needed something they
[1:28:18] needed a victory
[1:28:19] they needed a deliverance amen they
[1:28:23] thought it would be a political
[1:28:24] deliverance but it wasn't
[1:28:26] but they met him because they heard here
[1:28:27] was one
[1:28:29] amen here's a palm tree and that weary
[1:28:31] traveler
[1:28:32] looks and he goes in the distance he can
[1:28:34] see there's a tree
[1:28:35] there's a palm tree just over maybe as
[1:28:37] he looks over the horizon he sees the
[1:28:39] top of the tree
[1:28:41] and when he sees it amen
[1:28:45] he knows he'll be okay
[1:28:49] hallelujah amen
[1:28:52] god hasn't done these miracles all
[1:28:54] through this 400 years we've been
[1:28:56] without a prophet here come a man named
[1:28:57] john but he didn't do any miracles
[1:28:59] but it made it stand out
[1:29:02] you understand it made it stand out when
[1:29:04] christ come
[1:29:05] here come the miracles following him
[1:29:07] signs fallen and why
[1:29:08] it made it stand out to the people
[1:29:12] there's a tree i see the tops of it
[1:29:15] in the distance so i grabbed palm
[1:29:18] branches
[1:29:20] my wife and i had an experience like
[1:29:22] that the other day
[1:29:24] we were at a place called dogwood canyon
[1:29:28] if you've ever been there they have a
[1:29:29] tram that takes you back through there
[1:29:31] now my wife would recommend the tram
[1:29:35] it's about three i think 3.2 miles back
[1:29:38] in there now
[1:29:40] myself i'm a walking kind of guy
[1:29:45] and believe it or not i like to walk
[1:29:49] and i had my family with me and i'm
[1:29:52] cheap
[1:29:54] not because i don't have the money but
[1:29:55] just because i'm cheap
[1:29:57] and the tram ride was forty dollars i
[1:30:00] think for adults
[1:30:01] so it's pretty expensive so for all of
[1:30:03] us to be pretty pretty high and i said
[1:30:05] we can walk that
[1:30:07] we can do that and so the kids they
[1:30:10] found a scavenger hunt that they could
[1:30:12] do while they were out there so they
[1:30:13] were looking for little clues
[1:30:14] so we had to go a certain distance
[1:30:16] before we turn back in order for them to
[1:30:18] get that
[1:30:19] but it kept them from dragging behind
[1:30:21] because they had somewhere
[1:30:22] they had to go and so we said we can do
[1:30:24] this we get down there we walk
[1:30:26] in and at some point going in you
[1:30:28] realize you got to retrace your steps
[1:30:32] all the way back out right and you reach
[1:30:35] that point of no return where you're
[1:30:37] asking the kids are you sure you want to
[1:30:38] get this i
[1:30:39] i they said they'd get a prize they gave
[1:30:41] them a little badge i bought them a
[1:30:43] prize man
[1:30:46] but they wanted to go on and so they
[1:30:48] finally make it and there's a 260 year
[1:30:50] old sycamore tree at the end of
[1:30:51] or close to the end of it we had to go
[1:30:53] at least that far about three miles in
[1:30:56] to get down there and then we had to
[1:30:57] walk the three miles out
[1:30:59] well that walkout was a lot harder than
[1:31:00] the walk-in
[1:31:03] and we'd seen a a a bottled water
[1:31:05] machine they had like a coat machine
[1:31:07] that had bottled water in it on the way
[1:31:08] up there
[1:31:09] so we thought okay we'll stop on the way
[1:31:11] back and get some water we didn't carry
[1:31:12] any water with us
[1:31:13] we get back man and we're just pushing
[1:31:15] it to that bottled water machine man
[1:31:17] it's going to be so good and all i had
[1:31:19] was dollar bills in my pocket i thought
[1:31:20] but i got dollar bills it takes dollar
[1:31:22] bills
[1:31:22] guess what it did you all know what it
[1:31:24] did
[1:31:25] it didn't take dollar bills put them in
[1:31:28] there and they'd come out put them in
[1:31:30] there and they'd come out
[1:31:32] well we might as well give up and we
[1:31:35] were talking about he was like well they
[1:31:36] can't leave us in here
[1:31:39] right it closes at 5. so they can't just
[1:31:42] leave us back here
[1:31:44] and and here we are being being taken
[1:31:47] and all these people going on trams bias
[1:31:49] you know just sitting there waving
[1:31:50] laughing at us you know
[1:31:54] they can't they gotta pick us up they
[1:31:56] can't leave us back here
[1:31:58] so we were kind of getting discouraged
[1:32:00] but in the distance when we left there's
[1:32:02] a restaurant there has outdoor patio and
[1:32:03] has some red umbrellas on top of it
[1:32:06] and we've gotten when we got to the
[1:32:08] water machine to where we could see
[1:32:10] the umbrellas
[1:32:15] you talk about an exciting time
[1:32:19] i said kids were almost out of the woods
[1:32:24] i could see the tops of the umbrellas
[1:32:28] oh church i knew it wasn't very far
[1:32:31] if i could see it throw them trees and
[1:32:33] things and all that valley if i could
[1:32:35] see it i knew i could reach it
[1:32:37] why did they have palm branches in their
[1:32:39] hands because they could see
[1:32:42] that god was about to do something they
[1:32:44] could see the top of the palm tree
[1:32:46] they could see the top of that eternal
[1:32:48] life they could see the top of that
[1:32:49] resurrection they could see it there
[1:32:51] would be many more trials before they
[1:32:53] get there
[1:32:53] it'd be a long road they'd be tired and
[1:32:55] weary there would be a dark
[1:32:57] three days and three nights there would
[1:32:58] be a dark crucifixion there would be a
[1:33:00] horrible time
[1:33:01] when when christ was laying there in the
[1:33:03] grave and they thought all was lost and
[1:33:05] his
[1:33:05] soul even went and preached to the
[1:33:07] preachers to the souls in hell
[1:33:08] but during that time during those
[1:33:11] moments they had seen the top of the
[1:33:13] tree
[1:33:14] and so they could know that god was
[1:33:16] still going to do something
[1:33:18] oh church if you just recognize what god
[1:33:20] has done for us in our day by fulfilling
[1:33:22] his word
[1:33:23] we've seen the top of the palm tree
[1:33:25] we've seen a manifestation of the
[1:33:27] resurrection
[1:33:28] we've seen god do what he said that he
[1:33:30] would do and so it gives us courage
[1:33:32] in this last mile of the road in this
[1:33:34] last little bit that we have to walk
[1:33:36] when it gets so weary we get so down we
[1:33:38] get depressed sometimes we get weary
[1:33:40] but we've got to realize we can see the
[1:33:42] top of it
[1:33:44] we see the tip of the iceberg we know
[1:33:46] the rest of us got to be there somewhere
[1:33:48] there will come a moment when we will
[1:33:51] not all sleep but we'll all be changed
[1:33:52] in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:33:54] eye and we'll be
[1:33:58] known as we know hallelujah
[1:34:04] they held palm branches in their hands
[1:34:06] and they cried out hosanna
[1:34:09] oh santa brother brown said they were
[1:34:13] just waiting
[1:34:14] on the first move could we have that
[1:34:17] kind of
[1:34:17] expectation we got meetings coming up
[1:34:20] we have services when we come in here on
[1:34:22] sundays and on wednesdays
[1:34:24] can we wait like that just waiting on
[1:34:26] the first move
[1:34:27] and when they saw him start to come over
[1:34:29] the hill they saw the people begin to
[1:34:31] stir
[1:34:32] and the crowds begin together waiting on
[1:34:34] the first move
[1:34:35] they began to lay their palm branches
[1:34:36] down and cry out hosea
[1:34:40] waiting on the first move you never
[1:34:41] heard them say who's this coming
[1:34:43] oh no they knew who he was coming they
[1:34:46] knew who was coming
[1:34:48] they know what the word says there were
[1:34:50] also those who hated him and i'm gonna
[1:34:51] have to skip past some of this because
[1:34:53] we're out of time
[1:34:54] the real believer has always been hated
[1:34:56] john 15 and 18 if the world hates you
[1:34:58] you know that it hated me before it
[1:35:00] hated you
[1:35:05] brother branham tells us that they hated
[1:35:07] him because they were jealous of him and
[1:35:08] he takes that from joseph
[1:35:09] in the bible you understand joseph his
[1:35:11] brothers were jealous of him the bible
[1:35:12] says they hated him
[1:35:13] and then he began to tell them dreams
[1:35:15] and things they hated him the more
[1:35:19] and i'm skipping past i'm sorry to you
[1:35:21] following me on the
[1:35:22] things but i'm skipping through this but
[1:35:25] what was their attitude
[1:35:26] the ones that hated him when they heard
[1:35:29] this noise hosanna to the king
[1:35:31] i was handed to the king that comes in
[1:35:33] the name of the lord hosanna jose and
[1:35:34] all the screaming
[1:35:36] the priests ran out to see what this
[1:35:37] religious commotion was about
[1:35:39] and the people said who's this what were
[1:35:42] they for
[1:35:42] what were they there for friends a
[1:35:44] religious feast
[1:35:46] they were there to have church and
[1:35:47] didn't recognize when
[1:35:49] prophecy was being fulfilled the very
[1:35:52] god that had them to ordain this feast
[1:35:54] told them
[1:35:55] that he'd be there just like that and
[1:35:56] they cried who is it
[1:35:58] time hasn't changed people are designed
[1:36:00] the same as they was then
[1:36:02] luke 19 39 some of the pharisees from
[1:36:04] among the multitudes said unto him
[1:36:05] master rebuked thy disciples
[1:36:08] he answered and said to them i tell you
[1:36:09] that if if these should hold their peace
[1:36:12] the stones would immediately cry out
[1:36:15] i like that
[1:36:18] today the scientific theory of the
[1:36:20] modern so-called religious groups has
[1:36:21] tried to prove
[1:36:22] that this blessed thing that we have
[1:36:24] called the holy spirit is only emotion
[1:36:26] see it just don't stand up according to
[1:36:28] their scientific theory i would like to
[1:36:30] ask them this
[1:36:31] what makes them change now you
[1:36:34] understand what makes them change he's
[1:36:35] talking about the people who have the
[1:36:36] emotion
[1:36:37] now some don't but the real believer
[1:36:39] what makes them change
[1:36:41] what makes the drunkards stop drinking
[1:36:43] what makes the prostitute cease our evil
[1:36:45] life
[1:36:46] what makes the cancer and the diseases
[1:36:48] depart from the people and the deaf dumb
[1:36:50] and blind
[1:36:50] and the dead to raise up explain that is
[1:36:52] it emotion it has emotion with it
[1:36:54] certainly
[1:36:56] anything that's alive has a motion
[1:36:57] anything that doesn't have emotion is
[1:36:58] dead
[1:36:59] he said excuse the expression but i
[1:37:01] think we ought to bury some of our
[1:37:02] emotionless religion then because it's
[1:37:03] dead
[1:37:04] there's no emotion to it any religion
[1:37:07] that has not emotions should be buried
[1:37:08] because it is emotional
[1:37:10] jesus when he entered the city the
[1:37:11] children all of them all of his friends
[1:37:13] crying hosanna him that cometh in the
[1:37:14] name of the lord
[1:37:15] and those religionists of that they
[1:37:17] couldn't stand it it was too emotional
[1:37:19] he said if they hold their peace the
[1:37:20] rocks will immediately cry out
[1:37:22] see something must cry out because life
[1:37:25] was there
[1:37:27] you could see the palm tree life
[1:37:32] the third group as we're closing in just
[1:37:36] a moment those
[1:37:37] the third group was those who didn't
[1:37:39] know what to do
[1:37:43] they don't understand it he said there's
[1:37:46] something wrong with those people
[1:37:47] they're mad what what school did he come
[1:37:49] from
[1:37:51] huh they didn't understand see jesus
[1:37:53] never had any formal training
[1:37:56] never went to a college or was certified
[1:37:58] by a board of
[1:38:00] at a denomination what denomination does
[1:38:03] he belong to is he pharisees sadducee
[1:38:05] herodian that was another one of the
[1:38:06] groups in that day
[1:38:08] what is he he didn't belong to any of
[1:38:10] them
[1:38:11] he belonged to god because he was the
[1:38:14] son of god
[1:38:15] the holy spirit's not limited to any
[1:38:17] denomination it's of god
[1:38:20] listen it's for whosoever will let him
[1:38:23] come and partake of the spirit of life
[1:38:25] freely
[1:38:26] it isn't limited to any of us it's just
[1:38:29] something that's
[1:38:30] happened to us what's it doing in
[1:38:33] preparation for the resurrection
[1:38:35] preparation for the coming of the lord
[1:38:37] listen what james says to those of you
[1:38:38] maybe who don't know what to do
[1:38:41] with the stir that's going on with the
[1:38:43] the feeling that you have there's
[1:38:45] something happening but you don't know
[1:38:47] what it is maybe there wouldn't be
[1:38:48] anyone here that way this morning maybe
[1:38:50] there is
[1:38:51] i've been that way before you don't
[1:38:54] really know what to do with it
[1:38:56] james 1 5 if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:38:58] him ask of god
[1:39:00] and give it to all men liberally and
[1:39:01] abradeth not and it shall be given him
[1:39:04] that's simple enough isn't it you want
[1:39:06] to know ask god to show you
[1:39:10] he says but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:39:13] wavering for you that wavereth is like
[1:39:14] see if you don't believe you can get
[1:39:15] this wisdom
[1:39:16] he that wavereth is like a wave of the
[1:39:17] sea driven with the wind and tossed
[1:39:20] he said for let not that man think he
[1:39:22] shall receive anything of the lord a
[1:39:23] double-minded man
[1:39:25] is unstable in all his ways you can't
[1:39:28] just say well lord if you want to you
[1:39:29] can show me no you have to
[1:39:32] you have to want it and you have to
[1:39:33] believe you can get it
[1:39:35] right and james has the prescription for
[1:39:39] this double-minded man in james 4 8 he
[1:39:41] said draw nigh to god
[1:39:42] you know why we're here this morning
[1:39:44] draw an eye to god
[1:39:46] and he will draw night to you cleanse
[1:39:49] your hands you sinners
[1:39:50] purify your hearts you double-minded he
[1:39:52] said brother man i don't know what to do
[1:39:53] come to church
[1:39:56] pray read your bible look at the look at
[1:39:58] the things of god just just begin to do
[1:40:00] the things that are right
[1:40:02] you know you can't but god will honor
[1:40:04] that what did jesus tell him when he
[1:40:06] raised lazarus from the dead
[1:40:07] he said roll away the stone there was
[1:40:09] something they could do they couldn't
[1:40:10] resurrect the dead
[1:40:12] but they could roll away the stone hey
[1:40:14] man on our own we can't do anything
[1:40:16] but we can just prepare the way for him
[1:40:19] to begin to work in our lives
[1:40:22] live the best godly life you can if you
[1:40:24] don't understand
[1:40:26] come to church live for god go to church
[1:40:29] you don't have to go to this church but
[1:40:30] go to church
[1:40:32] seek god with all of your heart
[1:40:37] why not purify your hearts
[1:40:40] draw nigh to god he will draw nigh to
[1:40:42] you
[1:40:44] cleanse your hands you sinners purify
[1:40:45] your hearts you double mind if you're
[1:40:46] double minded here's a prescription
[1:40:48] purify your heart in other words make
[1:40:50] sure your motives are right
[1:40:55] who is this musicians come
[1:40:58] this is god manifesting his word among
[1:41:01] his people
[1:41:04] i would ask us to think this morning if
[1:41:06] there's those three groups still today
[1:41:08] if god manifests his word what group do
[1:41:09] we fall in are we those that believe
[1:41:11] those that hate it those that hated him
[1:41:14] or are we those that don't know
[1:41:18] but see we can know by the spirit of god
[1:41:19] john 16 and 13 says
[1:41:21] when he the spirit of truth has come he
[1:41:23] will guide you into all truth
[1:41:24] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:41:26] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:41:27] speak and he will show you things to
[1:41:29] come
[1:41:29] he said brother ben i don't know how to
[1:41:30] receive that to be guided to be led into
[1:41:33] all truth well the bible tells us that
[1:41:34] too how do i receive the holy ghost acts
[1:41:36] 2
[1:41:37] 37 now when he heard this when they
[1:41:38] heard this they were pricked in their
[1:41:40] heart
[1:41:40] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[1:41:42] the apostles men and brethren what shall
[1:41:44] we do they didn't know
[1:41:46] and peter said unto them repent turn
[1:41:49] from your wicked ways
[1:41:51] repent if you're what you're doing is
[1:41:54] wrong
[1:41:54] first stop doing what you know is wrong
[1:41:58] turn away from it turn away from it
[1:42:02] if you it's been you you know it's wrong
[1:42:04] and many times even in this
[1:42:05] you don't even have to look in the
[1:42:06] scripture you know in your heart that
[1:42:08] it's wrong
[1:42:09] repent turn away from it and be baptized
[1:42:12] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:42:14] christ
[1:42:15] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:42:18] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:42:22] how can you be led into all truth unless
[1:42:23] you're willing to repent and receive the
[1:42:25] holy ghost
[1:42:28] he said brother ben i've tried but if
[1:42:30] you come god's provided away and you
[1:42:31] come according to his word
[1:42:33] he will give you the holy ghost
[1:42:36] the problem is never with the word the
[1:42:38] problems with us because many times we
[1:42:39] come with reservations
[1:42:41] and say okay i'll go and be baptized but
[1:42:43] don't be baptized until you're willing
[1:42:44] to repent
[1:42:46] when you're willing to repent then come
[1:42:48] to christ
[1:42:49] and throw yourself on him i'm willing
[1:42:52] i'm not just going to give this a chance
[1:42:53] if it don't work
[1:42:54] no i'm going to let this be my life let
[1:42:56] this be who i am
[1:42:58] and let god work in my life you shall
[1:43:01] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[1:43:02] the promise is unto you
[1:43:04] you say well that was just for them that
[1:43:05] there on that day peter's just preaching
[1:43:06] to them no
[1:43:07] that's not what he said he said the
[1:43:08] promise is unto you your children
[1:43:11] and to all that are far off i'm afar off
[1:43:15] from the city of jerusalem but i fit in
[1:43:16] this scripture the promise is unto you
[1:43:19] your children
[1:43:20] i'm so glad for that all that are far
[1:43:22] off
[1:43:23] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:43:25] call
[1:43:27] even jesus said they can't come to me
[1:43:29] unless i draw on them
[1:43:31] but don't you feel the holy spirit
[1:43:32] drawing you today
[1:43:34] don't you see that he's rearranged your
[1:43:36] life and ordered your life in such a way
[1:43:37] that you could come to the word
[1:43:41] let's power heads together if you could
[1:43:43] play something
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:50] i know it's just a simple subject today
[1:43:52] on palm sunday
[1:43:55] we talked about the things that happened
[1:43:56] on this day all those years ago
[1:44:00] the people don't change and god doesn't
[1:44:03] change the scripture tells us hebrews 13
[1:44:05] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:44:08] and forever
[1:44:11] if you haven't repented of your sins or
[1:44:13] been baptized in the name of jesus
[1:44:15] christ for the remission of sins
[1:44:18] i invite you to do that today i invite
[1:44:21] you to repent now you say how long does
[1:44:23] that take you have to repent to you no
[1:44:24] you were bent to god
[1:44:26] you turned to god it's not just saying
[1:44:27] i'm sorry but saying lord i'll follow
[1:44:29] you
[1:44:31] i believe that you come and you died for
[1:44:32] my sins and i'm going to follow you from
[1:44:34] here wherever that takes me i'm going to
[1:44:35] follow you
[1:44:39] for those of you who do believe this is
[1:44:40] a time of worship
[1:44:43] it's a time of worship we should never
[1:44:46] let a moment pass by when we see god
[1:44:49] fulfilling his word
[1:44:50] it's a time of worship i shouldn't have
[1:44:52] to work that up brother allen or brother
[1:44:54] joel or whoever is up here
[1:44:56] brother david whoever is up here leading
[1:44:58] the singing that we shouldn't have to
[1:44:59] work that up
[1:45:00] you don't get excited because somebody
[1:45:02] lets you do this that or the other you
[1:45:03] get excited because
[1:45:05] he's here fulfilling his word and so we
[1:45:09] worship god for that reason
[1:45:11] heavenly father i pray that there would
[1:45:13] be those this morning that
[1:45:16] have given their lives to you lord we
[1:45:19] realize we're preaching not just to
[1:45:20] mature christians but even to little
[1:45:22] children
[1:45:23] old enough to understand right from
[1:45:25] wrong they're old enough to give their
