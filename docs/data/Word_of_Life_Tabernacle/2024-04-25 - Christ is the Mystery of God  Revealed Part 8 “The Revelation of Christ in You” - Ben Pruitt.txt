meet every need we ask in Jesus name amen amen going to read from Matthew 16 Matthew 1613 through 18 we continue to uh speak on Christ as the mystery of God revealed Matthew 1613 my goodness I was listening before church and we playing a portion of the tape and and uh I just wanted to keep listening to that for a while my goodness and I was so thankful also for the song service hasn't God been good to us and we just feel the presence of the Lord here with us and I'm so thankful for that and and to know that he's here than anything is possible and everything we have need of we should just be a happy people tonight and blessed and uh thinking about that song living on the Hallelujah side that's where we're at if they could write that maybe a hundred years ago when that song was written I they could write that then what about today we could say the Amen to that in our age we're living on the Hallelujah side amen are you glad to be in church tonight hey man good to good to be here with you Matthew 16:13 Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am now that's what's important what do we have to say and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah or son of Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you glad for that promise tonight amen let's uh you can have your seats I got a little bit of a ringing in the speakers last time we looked at this subject we found out that God uh foreshadowed what he would do in Christ in the prophets and and the Bible tells us that in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one he said God who at sunry times or at different times in in diverse manners in different ways at different times spoke in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so not in at different times and different manners but through one person his son whom Heth appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person the express image so he makes a difference they were images they were they were types they were Shadows but he was the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now what the part of the sermon that we're getting to and it's so wonderful he's talking about Christ in you and and what that means and what it means that that when you say you have the Holy Ghost do you know what that means in this age that we're living in we're saying you have the token you you have the literal Life of Christ dwelling on the inside of you what does that that mean for you as an individual it means that you have the one who all the prophets typed in you so what you have in you is greater even than what the prophets had or what they typed because they were they were wonderful men Noah and Jacob and and Jonah and all those men but they were types of something and you have the reality living in you but so many times the reason why you don't recognize that why I don't recognize it is for the same reason why they didn't recognize him because of the Flesh and so they didn't necessarily know what was going on but they they played out their part anyway and we'll play out our part now brother brand said all those things typed him just in type but yet the mystery was hit that men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something so when David said uh they pierced my hands and my feet he didn't know who he was talking about he thought he was talking about himself but yet that was actually speaking of Christ he said they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great Revelation he said but expressed himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah and on down through he said we could take each one of those prophets bring their lives out and show it express Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full in full waiting to make it known in the last last days as he promised that's Daniel 12:9 seal up the book to the time of the end making it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it now look he said because the Bible is written in Mysteries Jesus thanked the father for it he said see that was root in Mysteries you can find that in Luke 10:21 we've read it many times he said I thank you that you've hid it from the wise and prudent revealed it to babes he said now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming yes he's and and remember everything else was revealed except for the moment of his coming but yet even that we're sealed away into the mystery of going brother BR calls it the mystery of going the mystery of the Rapture so we can't miss it even though we don't know it we're part of it yeah does that make sense we don't know what hour it's coming but we can't miss it because we're part of it we'll get to that a little bit more and just just a moment so he didn't give his mystery in full he said so is all the Mysteries so God waited for this last day he said after it's already been completed and he reveals and shows what he's done om my never gave his mystery in full so it's got to be completed first this is why brother brandom can't preach couldn't preach the Rapture message until the very end of his ministry when last few days of brother Bam's life is when he preached the Rapture message why because he was going to clear to us that that the shout of 1 Thessalonians 4 was a message right the shout was the message he couldn't say that before the message came the message had to come and then he told us what it was so it was the shout of first Thessalonians 4 being the message was revealed and so he had to wait until the last hours of his life because that was God unfolding himself and revealing what he was doing during that time brother B talked about the seven seals is just like this comparing the Seven Seals he said now when God used Martin Luther for the coming out for that first church or that church age and when he used johon Wesley and he gradually brought them out was revealing in them that church age so he revealed the Lutheran age in Luther's life and in the life of those who followed him he revealed the Wesleyan age in Wesley's life and in the life of the followers what's he going to do today he revealed Oh my he revealed the he reveals the bride age in the bride right so he used John Wesley and he was revealing in them that church age he said when it goes back to the Bible now and find out he said but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing that he spoke of and showed those seven Thunders he said Life Magazine look in Life Magazine pack that Circle of a cloud and light there that they could not understand and don't know it yet he said but here telling go there and wait for these Mysteries to could be revealed months before it happened it happened exactly the way he said it would do the significance of the cloud is what happened while brother Brandon was there and what is that what is that it was he he preached a message said is this the sign of the end sir is what what is revelation 10 was this text is revelation 10 is everybody with me so far tonight we're going to go through some little deep Waters then we're going to get to some application tonight but is this the sign of the ERS is what it's Revelation 10 the sign of the end yes it was God answered that that it was so he said it's the opening of the word is that is this the sign of the end is it's that the revelation of the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained in the seals is it a mighty Angel saying time will be no more and we can look back at that and say yes it was he talks about the angel in the picture he said coming down with his wings back his head sing sideways he said there it is in the picture just exactly months before happened told here that he's going to bring the body of Believers together to reveal take up them lost ends he said here come Luther through he only preached justification just pounded away in that age he didn't know what that let me let me stop there he didn't know what the age was right he had no clue that he was the sixth Church age messenger or the fifth the fifth Church age messenger he had no clue Right Wesley at no point did Wesley know that he was a church age messenger that's right he just did it he he just oh my church you just realized tonight that what what a blessing it is that we know who we are and we'll also perform and manifest who we are but they didn't know who they were he didn't know what the age was here come Wesley through and he pounded his age through he said a lot of outfalls come from it other churches raising up he said then here come Pentecost pounding away they organized went right back into death again so we'll get to it in a few minutes right back into death don't watch that right back into death because we're going to come back to death later in the sermon and so he talks about they went back into death what was death organization he said and then comes the revelation of the mystery to reveal what it's all been about he talked about the little doctrines that were left off of the preceding three messages one of the criticisms of this message is that they say brother brandom plagiarized brother brandom uh actually uh took other men's thoughts and put them all together together well that's exactly what he was supposed to do right to tie up the Loose Ends it's exactly it's it's it's not a criticism really it's a commendation of what he was supposed to do then come back in the last days and pick up all those Mysteries and clearly explain it and reveal it why it's the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed and he said do you get it and they said amen probably some of them said amen that didn't get it right but he said if you fail come back to the this tape again he said I don't know how much longer I'll be with you remember this is the truth thus sayith the truth it's the truth look how he qualifies it's the truth it's the scripture and 2 Timothy 3:16 tells us all scripture is God breathed God inspired now watch every message Doctrine has a scriptural Foundation it has to or it's not right so it has to have a scriptural Foundation so we know that if you if you say well I believe brother bandam taught this but it doesn't have a scriptural Foundation then you must misunderstand it in some way because if it's a teaching in a message I've never found and I challenge you you won't find a teaching in the message that doesn't have a scriptural Foundation it may be updated and give light for our day but it Bel but its foundation is in the scripture look and if you I say well if I I say well I don't understand how it's scriptural then I need to put it aside until I do understand it because there's something wrong with my understanding because he was a word Prophet now just because something is difficult to understand doesn't make it wrong right right are youall with me tonight just because something's difficult to understand doesn't make it wrong just because something impacts your life in a negative way or you think it's negative doesn't make it wrong right just because the word uh affects me in a negative way doesn't make it wrong we've got to be careful that we accept the word for what it is right and then apply it the way it's meant to be applied and not try to say well he must not Adit that because that that bothers me well there's lots of things about the word that bother me but I just want to live it I just want to become it Lord let me let me let me manifest it instead of reject it so I need to I need to just because it's difficult to understand doesn't make it wrong just me I can't understand it right you don't understand how well most of you probably don't understand how the bank banking system works right but Allen's throwing up his hands I mean I don't understand how it works I just know you put money in there and they keep it for you and you get it out you know and I don't know how all that works but I don't have to know how it works I just put the money in there just because it's difficult for me to understand doesn't make it wrong are you with me now right so that's what Peter said about Paul in his Epistles speaking in them of these things he said in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest or they they struggle with it as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction so we don't want to wrestle with it we just want to accept it and believe it what we want to wrestle through is our own flesh trying to to deny that it's the truth right so Jesus spoke things that were difficult to understand for the disciples he said eat my I Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and they and they looked at the law and said well there's no way that's not even legal right and he never explained it to him he just said it and then when he got done saying it they all begin to leave and he looks at the disciples he said will you go too are you also going to go and Simon Peter answered him something great he said Lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life and I want to say tonight that Christ still has the words of eternal life this message is not from Jeffersonville it's not brother brandham and and about just about him this message is Christ this message come from heaven and so we believe it's Christ speaking he alone has the words of life but the brandom said like the seven Mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals had done been broken every age had come down there they left a lot of scattering and God not willing that it should be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines they started and brought it on out and revealed the whole thing the same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of Christ how he was God's three-fold purpose for the church he said Oh my he said letting him out and he said to reveal reveal Webster says is to make known and especially in Divine truth that Revelation means Revelation it is Christ's way of making himself known to his church the word uh Revelation is is an unveiling that's what that word means it's an unveiling he said ' now we're we're going to say now brother brandom you're just saying this he said ' now we won't just say this what's he going to do he's going to take it back to scripture he takes it back to Matthew 16 that we read earlier Matthew 161 13-17 and he said I'll quote it he said when Jesus come from Mount Transfiguration he says who does man say that I the son of man am some says oh they think you're Elijah some says you one of the prophets Jeremiah but that wasn't what he asked he said who do you think that I am he said now there is the church that he's talking to what does man think that I am today he's a philosopher the social religion he was a good man I believe his teaching is right it's a subject to be lived by I think it'd make us all better if we did we to have our churches or or so forth he said that's Santa Claus like a Santa Claus story it's just a story he said it's not expressions of some church that we should Express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit he said and how do you know he said now you say I might know I was losing my mind he said maybe a man that loses his mind does that he said but if you have the mind of Christ Christ expresses himself through you it shows that it's him and not that you've lost your mind he said some people under illusions of things goes out and becomes insane so he's going to the BR is going to lay out something that's very practical and very needed especially for those of us that are more emotional in our approach now watch he said it's he said he said some people comes out goes out and becomes insane he said well he said we know that's wrong that's the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before it gets here always bogus see we don't order our lives by impression by sensation by illusion or by emotion we order our steps by the word don't you want to be like David when he said order my steps by Your Word oh Lord that we don't lead Our Lives by all these other things the Holy Ghost leads us to the word brother Bron said a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking he said not come up blindly like that now watch how you approach God if you want healing if you need healing if you come in a prayer line if you come to be prayed for here at the front of the church you don't come up without your senses right you don't come up and say well I'm just going to leave my mind blank well anything could come in right you don't work yourself up into a frenzy right that's not how you come to God you come to God claiming the promises of God lord you said I could be healed you said I could be saved you said I could I could be delivered you said my family would be saved so you remind God of his promises and you say Lord you said if I called for the Elders of the church and they anointed me with oil I could be healed I would be healed so you remind God of his promise he's the one that made the promise and you come to God in your right mind he said with your right senses you come up with your right senses and Christ takes you over and expresses himself you don't have to clear out your mind to do that he just takes you over because you're you're coming in your right mind according to the word he said and now to the world now to the world you're an insane person he said now if you're insane you're actually insane there's nothing the devil can't take you and complete control he said he'll make you do everything contrary to the word I I know and I I've said this many times but a lot of things have been blamed on God but that's not God he gets to blame for a lot of things he doesn't do but if it's not according to the word it's not God doing it right but when Christ takes you over he said that's what I want tonight he'll Express that word right through you because it's him he is the word see and then you can see the expression of Christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you yes he said how beautiful how beautiful now watch he said who do you say I am who do you say I am he's asking the church say 12 the millions of that day he asked 12 the millions in the days of Noah he asked eight he said as it was in the days of Noah so will be the coming of the son of man where eight Souls were saved he's asking us tonight who do you you say that I am what do you say about the message of the hour every one of us has to answer that question well I go to church I go to Word of Life Tabernacle brother Ben is my pastor that that may be true but it's not enough right we've got to answer the question what do we say who do we say he is do we say that he's able do we say he's sufficient do we say the message is right right do we say that the word says whatever the word says is true what do we say about about him yes amen is he the Christ or is it just another just another religion is this message Christ or is it just another teaching now look he said I don't now I don't say there's going to be eight saved now he said don't get that all wrong how many people have gotten that wrong I never said that he said I don't know how many is going to be saved and you know what that means we don't know how many is going to be saved I don't know how many's going to be saved in that last moment toture that little group he said it'll be small group I'll tell you that there Traders the gate narrow us the way but few there will be that find it when the Great Ransom body through all ages comes up that's going to be a great Throne there Revelation 7 expresses a great number which no man could number through all the ages has come up and has walked in the light of the Bible as far as it was revealed to them listen it's not how much light you have that makes you the bride right cuz Luther was Bride for his day Wesley was Bride for his day they didn't have the light that we have it's not how much light you have have it's how much you walk in right it's how much you walk in how you walk in the light you do have that's what that's what tells us that's what that's how you know that you're the bride because you you you respond to the light he said now we know that Wesley had more light than Luther did we know Pentecost outshine Wesley certainly it does because it just gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets and so forth till it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in Christ and now the Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and God is the husband of the church the church is his bride now Peter when he called he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said now watch blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah he said Son of Jonah see blessed art thou for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from some school but my father Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you notice what he said Upon This Rock I want you to I want us to catch this because I'm going to slow down we're going to quit reading we're just going to we're going to dwell on this for a minute okay he said Upon This Rock that's Peter the predestined seat of God that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom Upon This Rock of Revelation he just said that's Peter but now he says Upon This Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is and that's what brother B always taught that was the rock it wasn't Peter it wasn't Christ right but he was the rock of Revelation he said he is the full manifested God Upon This Rock not of Father Son and Holy Ghost and him being the second person Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never shake it down never Prevail against it I'll build my church Upon This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ now you might be a question in your mind why did brother bandam say that that's Peter the predestinated seat of God well Peter literally means a little Stone Little Rock right and that's why the Protestants most of or the Catholics rather believe that Peter was the rock the church was built on but you that you build a church on a man that's what you get right you get all that that man is and all of his mistakes this message isn't built on a man it's built on Christ and it has to you're whatever you believe has to be built on the Scripture it has to be built on the word the revealed word of the hour he said Upon This Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is he's the full manifested God but he calls Peter a rock now again Matthew 16:18 I say also unto thee that thou art Peter the word there is Petros Petros A Little Rock and Upon This Rock a different word Patra which means a big rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it two words for rock Peter's Little Rock Petra is large Rock I'm going to build my church he says on the revelation of who I am but what's he telling Peter by naming him Peter he's saying you're a chip off the old block right you've heard that expression what is he saying that's what his name literally means a chip off of a larger Rock and he said the Revelation is the larger your rock and you're the chip off of it what that means is that you're a part of the Revelation yeah right and that's why you can't leave that's why you can't quit that's why the devil's done his worst and you can't give up why because you're part of the Revelation you you've been called a part of a part of him said Peter you're a little rock but the Revelation is the big rock I'm going to build my church on that revelation of who I am you're a part of that Revelation I want you to watch now brother brandom this is just continuing just two more paragraphs here one more paragraph about about this same subject in Christ is Mystery of God revealed brother brand said look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ now watch Christ in you makes you someone say me huh makes you I wish we could realize what we are and who we are but see there's a problem you're looking at what you've done right you're looking at what you've done but we're not talking about what you've done we're talking about who you are right because there's three parts to you on the outside you got a flesh that's always going to fail always has failed brother Ben I'm so shocked that I failed in my flesh well that's what it does you just need more of Christ to come in and overwhelm that and overcome that and take over that flesh it's no shock when the flesh fails the flesh that's what the flesh does even Paul the Apostle cried out oh Wretched Man that I am but it's hard to see what he is when you're looking at what you are are but you got to look be able to look Beyond this you got to be able to look beyond the man in the mirror to be able to see there's Christ yeah you realize you have to be able to look Beyond me to be able to see that there's a preacher preaching the word you got to be able to look beyond your wife to be able to see there's a woman of God a child of God a daughter of God you got to be able to look beyond your husband to see there's a Son of God you got to be able to look beyond the flesh to see your brothers and sisters as children of God because they will make mistakes they will do things that are wrong absolutely they will but I'm so glad for the grace of God that even in my worst moments brother Harvey that word always called to me that word always grabbed a hold of my heart even in my worst moments for he he grabbed a hold of me made me who I am and if there's a pull in your heart don't you give up and begin to look at what you were look at who he is Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing that's what God wants to do he said that's what God is trying to do make you the complete revelation of who he is in the world today his hidden purpose revealed in you and me the purpose he spoke about in Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations now is made manifest to his Saints whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery in you which this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory yes right amen I love that what else did he tell Peter he said he said you are Peter you're a chip off the old block Peter needed that didn't he he's about to go through some things he's about to deny Christ he's about to say I message you nothing to it what it would be like today don't give up on your kids CU they say there's nothing to the message because they may be like Peter they just need the Holy Ghost Peter just needed to be converted right and and Jesus said not when not if but when you're converted strengthen your brethren so the devil wants to have you he said he'd like to sift you like wheat but I prayed for you yeah all right amen I love that he prayed for us too he said those that will hear by their word and when when they're converted when you're converted he said strengthen your brethren but look what did he tell him he said you're Peter you're chip off the old block and and Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against it well I get to thinking about that and what is the gates of hell now brother Brandon told us over and over again he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail he said it showed us that the gates of hell would be against it but it wouldn't be able to stop it and he talked about the Gates of Hell be an organization you remember earlier in this he said every time it organized it died yeah right death was there when Whenever there was an organization and and so he said the gates of hell would not Prevail he said organization would not be able to stop the bride right trouble would not be able to stop the bride whatever is released out of the entrances of hell would not be able to stop the bride but I got to thinking about that and I realized that the Gates of Hell quite literally is death now think about it for a minute it's death that's the gate or the entrance to hell it's death and and it shows us now that now if you have a gate of something it's either holding you in right from getting out somewhere or it's keeping you back from entering in right and but what it means is if you come against the gate it means the person behind the gate the person operating the gate is on defense think about that for a minute he said the gates of hell would not Prevail against you what it means is the bride the church is going to be on offense not on defense and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you when you come against it because there's something in you that's coming against hell that's coming against death and when what this Revelation means to us church here at the end time and I'm closing in just a moment but what it means to us is that death itself yes sir will not be able to hold us oh my sir we know he conquer death in his body but one day he's going to conquer death in our bodies right yes sir well that's the truth whether by Rapture or Resurrection he's going to conquer death in our bodies now I'm not going out on a limb here if you go back and I don't have time to teach it all tonight but if you go back you'll find brother brandom had a vision of a Mamba you remember that I preached about it here before he said it was a black snake it meant he said it was from Africa he say the the darkest snake that there ever was the the worst snake that there ever was and it meant death yeah it meant death and and in being that this Mamba which which is the most the deadliest snake I saw the other day I was looking through snake bite victims because we saw Copperhead at Mom's house so I was uh I was letting her know all had died of copperhead bites you know and cuz that's my job to do as a son saw this little baby copperhead at Mom's house so and we never did find it it crawled up under there somewhere but you know I was looking at copperhead bites and there was a person in the US killed by a Mamba how in the world does that happen well cuz he was handling it he he play was playing with it so you know he had to possess it and play with it if it's if it's in Africa leave it in Africa and let it do what it does over there but don't bring it over here but we got bad enough trouble with the Copperheads and things like that but brother brandom taught us that that Mamba was death right and when he spoke to it he gave him power to bind it and to unbind it what did he tell Peter I give you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven power to bind and to unbind and what did what did Brother brand say about the Mamba death he said I give you power to bind it and he bound it he said it crystallized turned like to Glass he said just so you know you have it I give you power to unbind it he Unbound it and it come back a snake again and then he bound it again and so what what was it he was showing him that death would be defeated by the message of the hour oh my now brother B taught us that the devil does have a power he said that that power is death yeah and after death the devil can do no more he's finished at death right yeah do you realize what it means when the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you if death cannot Prevail against you nothing else can Prevail against you when he killed that Mamba you realize what happened he said it made an and sign in the air he said it meant that and everything under it was defeated oh Church death and everything under it was defeated oh what that ought to mean to us is Christians today death and everything under death so think about whatever problem you're facing everything under death has been defeated listen Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:26 The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what is he saying this is how death is going to be destroyed at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory I I love to go back and see when Paul references an Old Testament scripture I love to go back and see it Isaiah 258 is the saying that he's referencing he said he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth for the Lord has spoken him death will be defeated in these mortal bodies then won't lust be defeated huh won't won't ungodliness be defeated in these mortal bodies you say Well it it hasn't yet it will be you just keep feeding on the word you keep getting closer to God it'll be defeated sickness will be defeated everything under death is defeated because the rebuke of his people will be taken off the Earth Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing of what God is trying to do oh what a wonderful promise that is it's the musicians would come I'm done this evening oh isn't He Lovely tonight I I I just love fellowshipping around his word it gives me great comfort knowing I still love the word amen still love the word and then that word has been effective it's not just that I love it but then it becomes effective in my life it's great comfort no matter what what you're going through that word will speak and death will be defeated and everything under it is defeated in death Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads together and think of what you've done for us Lord on a Wednesday night sometimes we we kind of lay back and wait and see what's going to happen but Lord I I know that you've spoken tonight and cuz Lord what I read was your word Lord you said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against the people of God and your Prophet told us that the gates would be against it but they would not Prevail over it death will not Prevail over the people of God denomination will not Prevail which is death organization will not Prevail against the people of God at the end time a comfort that gives us Lord in knowing that you have all things in your hand Lord I I pray that you'd come and you just speak directly to our hearts today I pray you would encourage Lord I I realize Lord as a pastor if you could just get people to look away from their own flesh if you could just get people to to Look to You Lord and to realize the promise of the hour Lord then things would be different Lord we believe that there's a people that are doing that today I pray God that you'd move in their lives I I pray you'd take everything out from under us Lord Lord if if everything under death has been defeated then Lord I pray that every every evil spirit would be bound in our life every every sickness every disease every every mental anxiety Lord every strain of the devil or may it be bound it's under death and death has been defeated by your by your Victory on Calvary Lord and when you come in the fullness of a body Lord in that day you defeated death now you're coming in the fullness of the body of your bride Lord and death has been defeated again Lord we're so thankful for that Lord I pray that you'd help us to understand and to know and to believe Lord who you are and who we are and this day that we live in that in you Lord that we become the mystery or the revelation of all of all of it I pray You' Grant it now ask in Jesus name amen oh can't you see oh I I'm so happy hallelujah
