[25:39] if you're expecting something tonight
[25:42] from the Lord that he'll answer that
[25:43] need. Do you believe that? Amen. He
[25:45] absolutely said the prophet of God tells
[25:47] us you get what you expect. And so I say
[25:51] that a lot. But you know, I I believe
[25:52] every one of us, we need to just make
[25:54] sure we come with expectations every
[25:56] time we come inside those doors because
[25:57] I believe we're in for a [music]
[25:58] blessing and we're in for a good time.
[26:00] Amen. So as a pastor comes, let's just
[26:02] sing this with all of our hearts. Want
[26:04] [singing]
[26:05] to care. all your troubles
[26:10] like no other [singing]
[26:13] can do.
[26:17] And he'll [singing] come down
[26:20] from [music] the sky,
[26:23] brush the tears
[26:25] [music and singing] from your eyes.
[26:28] You're his child
[26:30] and [singing and music]
[26:31] he cares
[26:33] for you.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have someone
[26:41] to care.
[26:44] [music] Oh, someone [singing]
[26:46] to share all your troubles [music]
[26:51] like no other [singing]
[26:54] can do.
[26:58] He'll [singing] come down from the sky.
[27:04] Brush the tears
[27:06] from your eyes. You're his child
[27:11] and he cares
[27:14] for [singing and music] you.
[27:16] One more time. Oh, we have someone
[27:22] to care.
[27:24] We have someone
[27:28] in all our troubles
[27:33] like no other
[27:35] can do.
[27:37] Aren't you glad he's there? [music]
[27:39] Oh, he'll come down [singing]
[27:42] from the sky,
[27:45] brush the tears [singing] from your
[27:48] eyes.
[27:50] You're [music] his child
[27:53] and he cares [singing]
[27:55] for you.
[27:59] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[28:00] of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so
[28:03] grateful that you are that [music]
[28:04] someone who cares,
[28:06] someone who shares all of our burdens.
[28:08] And Father, we know we can lay it over
[28:11] on you and you can take it. Lord, when
[28:14] we're so sick that we can't heal
[28:16] ourselves, doctors can't do anything.
[28:18] That you said, "I am the God who heals
[28:20] all your diseases." And maybe we're so
[28:23] weary that we can't put one foot in
[28:25] front of another, but you're the God who
[28:27] said that through you we could do all
[28:30] things. And so, we're trusting you today
[28:32] and believing you. We put our burdens
[28:34] over on you, knowing that you care for
[28:37] us. I pray that you would move tonight,
[28:40] Lord, speak directly to your people. I I
[28:43] I'm insufficient in myself to be able to
[28:45] speak tonight,
[28:47] but I know that you can and you will.
[28:49] And I pray that you'd do that. Move me
[28:52] out of the way. Speak to your people. We
[28:54] pray in [music] Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[28:58] God bless you. Turn with me to
[29:00] Revelation chapter 2. Revelation chapter
[29:03] 2 and verse 14.
[29:06] We're going to get back to Ephesians at
[29:07] some point, but I just while we had a
[29:09] little opportunity in the meantime, I
[29:12] want to deal with something today just a
[29:15] little bit different.
[29:17] Revelation 2:14
[29:21] says, "But I have a few things against
[29:23] thee, because thou hast there them that
[29:26] hold the doctrine of Balum." This is
[29:29] from the Pergamus church age who taught
[29:32] bailac to cast a stumbling block before
[29:35] the children of Israel to eat things
[29:37] sacrificed to idols and to commit
[29:40] fornication. Pray the Lord would add his
[29:43] blessing to the word. You may be seated.
[29:44] I want to speak to you tonight on the
[29:46] new pope. Kind of give you an update on
[29:48] that and uh also on uh the Nyian
[29:53] council, another Nyian council. I don't
[29:57] often respond to items in the news. As
[29:59] you know, I'm not very political, but uh
[30:02] you may have noticed over the last
[30:04] couple weeks that the new pope from the
[30:05] United States has been very active in
[30:07] the press.
[30:09] And I want to look at some things in the
[30:11] light of the scriptures and the message
[30:12] of the hour. I'm glad we have a message,
[30:16] &gt;&gt; right? I'm glad that God sent a prophet.
[30:18] I want to say that at the very beginning
[30:20] because we can understand things that
[30:23] are going on right now in a way that the
[30:25] denominational world can't. And that's
[30:27] not because they're they're bad people
[30:29] or they're evil or something like that,
[30:30] but it's just because we've heard a
[30:32] message and we heard a voice that said,
[30:34] "Come out of her, my people." And be not
[30:37] partaker of her plagues. And so, we sure
[30:40] want to acknowledge that. And and he
[30:43] told us to watch certain things. And we
[30:46] know that when we uh here a while back I
[30:49] had and I talked about it when the new
[30:50] pope was elected. They said there was no
[30:52] way a pope from the US would be elected
[30:54] and yet he was. And I believe it was a
[30:57] fulfillment of what a prophet had to
[30:59] say. And and you said, "Brother Ben, how
[31:01] can you say that's the fulfillment?"
[31:02] Because brother Brandham said there
[31:04] would be a pope from the US. And then we
[31:07] have one. We don't know that he'll be
[31:08] the one that'll become the incarnate
[31:10] antichrist. But we do know that time is
[31:13] coming. We're coming to a maturity when
[31:16] all all the things that have been spoken
[31:18] are going to come to pass at some point.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand that. I want
[31:22] our young people to understand that. I
[31:24] think we take for granted that people
[31:25] know what we're talking about when we
[31:27] talk about these things. But we need to
[31:29] understand it. And we need to be able to
[31:31] say, "Lord, come quickly."
[31:33] &gt;&gt; We need to know what time we live in. We
[31:35] live in a time when it's not time to
[31:37] play church. It's not time to just uh
[31:40] sit around and and wait on something to
[31:42] happen. And things are happening, not
[31:44] just out there in the world in the news
[31:46] in the Catholic Church or something like
[31:47] that, but right here among the bride,
[31:50] things are happening and we're getting
[31:51] closer and closer to the end of time.
[31:54] How many believe that?
[31:56] &gt;&gt; So, if there ever was a time to be on
[31:57] fire for God, now's the time.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time to live for the
[32:01] Lord with all of your heart and and all
[32:03] of your passion and everything that
[32:05] you've got, now's the time to do that.
[32:07] It's not the time to back up. It's the
[32:09] time to press on. Amen. the coming of
[32:11] the Lord. So,
[32:14] Brother Brandham talks about uh in the
[32:16] 1950s and 1960s and uh talks about
[32:19] communism and and everybody in that time
[32:22] if you went back and just took a survey
[32:24] of sermons during that time,
[32:28] you would find that uh there was a topic
[32:30] of most evangelical sermons and it was
[32:33] communism and everybody was afraid. Some
[32:35] of you lived through that time and and
[32:38] everybody was afraid of Russia.
[32:39] Everybody was afraid of communism.
[32:42] But in 1962, brother Brandham said this.
[32:44] He said, "Don't watch iron curtains."
[32:47] Right? The iron curtain was the
[32:49] separation between the east and the
[32:50] west. That was the uh Russian uh the
[32:54] communist government of Russia. He said,
[32:56] "Don't watch iron curtains and bamboo
[32:59] curtains." That's China. He said, "But
[33:01] watch the purple curtain. The purple
[33:03] curtain is Rome." He said, "That's the
[33:05] one that's going to get you." He said,
[33:06] "Don't you never worry about that." He
[33:09] said, "You just mark that down and say,
[33:11] "Brother Brandham said it and put it in
[33:13] your Bible and see if it's right."
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Right. This was uh 25 years, 30 years
[33:22] probably before communism broke apart
[33:25] and communist Russia was opened back up
[33:27] and everybody thought they were going to
[33:29] destroy the world. And they do have a
[33:30] place and Russia has a place, but maybe
[33:34] not what they thought it would be. But
[33:36] brother Brandham said this. He said,
[33:38] "Communism is nothing but a tool in
[33:40] God's hand." He said, playing right up.
[33:42] Why? It won't amount to nothing. He
[33:44] said, "That's exactly right. Don't fear
[33:47] about that. That's something that'd
[33:49] throw you off of the track of looking."
[33:51] He said, "But Bible readers and men who
[33:53] love God." How many love God tonight? He
[33:56] said, "Stay with what the Bible said."
[33:58] So, the Bible tells us about Rome. The
[34:01] purple curtain is Rome. She's the woman
[34:03] who sat on a scarlet-c colorored beast
[34:04] in Revelation 17. And you can go look at
[34:08] that and and and see that that that's
[34:10] Rome, a city on seven hills. Now, the
[34:13] first news item that come up uh this
[34:16] week uh was a news item that uh a
[34:20] headline that said that the pope
[34:22] declared that Mary was not a
[34:24] co-redeemer.
[34:26] And we could all say amen to that. Like
[34:29] we've known that for a long time. But it
[34:32] was very interesting that the pope would
[34:34] declare that Mary was not a co-redeemer
[34:37] because people in the Catholic Church
[34:39] have been pushing to give her that title
[34:41] for some time now because there's a cult
[34:43] of Mary within the Catholic Church and
[34:46] and and they do worship Mary. They'll
[34:48] tell you that they don't, but they
[34:50] actually do. It's only been a few months
[34:53] since the pope actually
[34:56] uh actually declared like six months
[34:59] before he declared that Mary was not a
[35:01] co-redeemer. He declared that the people
[35:03] should show more devotion to Mary. More
[35:06] devotion to Mary. So I think I have that
[35:08] as well. Yeah. Let us renew our devotion
[35:10] to Mary. And he actually venerated the
[35:14] icon of Mary. But I'm going to back up
[35:16] just a little bit. I've got some
[35:17] articles if you want to read them later.
[35:19] I I'll give them to you. whoever comes
[35:21] first, but you can look it up online.
[35:24] But uh they talk about Mary and how
[35:26] she's not the uh co-redeemer uh with
[35:30] Jesus. And yet they say things like this
[35:32] in that article that this one cardinal
[35:35] when he was looking at Mary's face, he
[35:37] said he saw the sorrow on Mary's face,
[35:39] he's looking at a statue. He said
[35:41] because of the death of her son, at the
[35:43] same time her obvious strength, he said
[35:45] was so beautiful. It was understandable
[35:47] why people would want to say everything
[35:48] and more about Mary. Do you see the
[35:51] spirit of idolatry? It just they they
[35:54] just love her so much. They wouldn't
[35:55] want to say anything bad about her, but
[35:57] it's a spirit of idolatry that caused
[35:59] them to actually worship her. [snorts]
[36:02] So the uh uh the new document says that
[36:05] the titles used for Mary should speak of
[36:06] her motherly care for all people and her
[36:09] place as the perfect disciple of Jesus.
[36:12] but must not create any doubt that
[36:14] Catholics believe Jesus is the redeemer
[36:15] of the world and the bestower of grace.
[36:17] So they're coming closer to a Protestant
[36:19] understanding
[36:21] of Mary than what they were. They're
[36:24] coming closer to that and yet they still
[36:26] worship Mary. Let us renew our devotion
[36:28] to Mary. They say the pope stressed the
[36:31] importance of having a relationship with
[36:34] the mother of God. Do you realize how uh
[36:37] how idolatrous that is?
[36:40] &gt;&gt; How pagan that is? Right? We don't
[36:43] commune with the dead.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Right? I love my dad, but I don't have a
[36:47] relationship with him anymore. He's gone
[36:48] on,
[36:49] &gt;&gt; right? We do not commune with the dead.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; So, we can't have a relationship with
[36:54] the mother of God. She was not the
[36:56] mother of God. We know because God
[36:58] created both the blood cell and the egg.
[37:00] He said, "This is a wonderful moment to
[37:02] renew our devotion to Mary." He said in
[37:05] the image of Salis Papuli Romani which
[37:08] is the image of Mary there in Rome who
[37:10] has accompanied the people of Rome
[37:11] through so many of their trials. He said
[37:14] let us ask God through the intercession
[37:15] of his mother to bless all the families
[37:18] loved ones and help us journey together
[37:19] in the church united as one family. Boy,
[37:21] it sounds good doesn't it?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; But but we realize how pagan that is,
[37:27] &gt;&gt; right? It's pagan. It's idolatry. And
[37:29] yet they're publicly moving closer to
[37:32] the Protestant position on Mary. Now,
[37:35] what does the Bible say about that? It
[37:38] says about the Antichrist, says this
[37:39] more than one place, but let's take
[37:40] Daniel 11:21. It says, "In his estate
[37:43] shall stand up a vile person to whom
[37:46] they shall not give the honor of the
[37:48] kingdom, but he shall come in
[37:49] peaceibly." Someone say, "Peaceably." I
[37:52] want to make sure you all stay awake
[37:53] tonight. And obtain the kingdom by what?
[37:56] Flatteries.
[37:57] Flatteries. So flatteries literally in
[38:01] the original means slickness. Slickness.
[38:04] He comes in with slickness. He obtains
[38:06] the kingdom by flatteries. What has it
[38:07] done? Brother Brandon says in
[38:09] cunningness, as he said, he comes in
[38:11] like flatteries. He said, and what has
[38:13] he done? He's bringing the Protestant
[38:15] ecumenical council of the world
[38:18] churches. Remember the the uh Catholic
[38:21] Church was the uh is is the mo the
[38:24] harlot that sits on uh the Roman beast
[38:28] and controls the world through that. And
[38:31] then we find that the there was another
[38:34] beast that raised up which was the
[38:36] United States right out of the earth.
[38:38] And then there was uh uh there there was
[38:41] a uh world council of churches which was
[38:44] the image to the beast. They made an
[38:46] image to the beast. It wasn't the beast,
[38:47] but it was like the beast. Brother
[38:49] Brandham said that was the world council
[38:50] of churches. He said the spirit of
[38:53] antichrist upon both of them,
[38:56] &gt;&gt; right? Both of them. Brother Stewart
[38:57] showed me a quote before church tonight
[38:59] where he said that the Protestants and
[39:01] the Catholics would actually fight
[39:03] against Jesus and the resurrected saints
[39:06] at the battle of Armageddon. I tell you
[39:08] what, church, where it's not going to be
[39:10] say, "Well, uh, you know, I'm bored
[39:12] right now. I don't have much to do."
[39:13] Well, there's some things you're going
[39:14] to be doing, right? We're going to a
[39:17] wedding supper. We're going to be I
[39:18] don't know how all that'll will turn
[39:20] out, but I know we're going to fight in
[39:21] the battle of Armageddon. There those
[39:23] things are real. They're going to
[39:24] happen. And you got to believe those
[39:26] things. There's a real rapture. There's
[39:28] a real body change. There's a real Jesus
[39:31] coming back. And we we need to grab a
[39:33] hold of that and look to those things
[39:35] because we know that this world is not
[39:37] what we see as real is not really what's
[39:39] real. But the reality of it is what the
[39:42] word says. We know what our future is,
[39:44] what our home's going to be. Your future
[39:46] is not the present condition of your
[39:48] body. But your future is a future home.
[39:51] You need to grab a hold of that. Listen,
[39:53] people can get so discouraged today
[39:55] because they can't see. But Moses, what
[39:57] did he do? He looked beyond the toil of
[39:58] the people, looked at the future, and
[40:00] said, "I know what they're going to be.
[40:02] I know that they're God's people. I know
[40:04] that they belong to God." And so, we
[40:07] have to be able to look at ourselves the
[40:08] same way. Are you with me so far? Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; So he said he comes in in cunningness.
[40:16] He said and the spirit of antichrist
[40:18] upon both of them bringing them to the
[40:21] slaughter. That's the battle of
[40:22] Armageddon. And and and and yet he
[40:25] speaks of another slaughter as well.
[40:26] This is from feast of the trumpets. He
[40:28] said just like they did the other in the
[40:30] hour to call the bride. Now the other
[40:32] he's speaking of there is Hiller and
[40:34] Ikeman and the Jews, right? That the
[40:37] Holocaust. So there was a slaughter of
[40:40] the people during the holy he said in
[40:42] this world council of churches bringing
[40:44] them to the slaughter. He said just like
[40:46] they did the other in the hour to call
[40:48] the bride. So the spirit on the pope and
[40:51] on the ecumenical council and the church
[40:54] is the same spirit
[40:56] &gt;&gt; that is on that was on Hitler.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Right? He don't look much like Hitler,
[41:02] does he?
[41:03] &gt;&gt; But that's how Satan does things.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Right? the Pope. The same spirit that's
[41:07] on the Pope is the same spirit that was
[41:09] on Hitler. The same spirit that was on
[41:11] Stalin, the same spirit that was on
[41:12] Ikeman. All of those, it was loosed in
[41:15] the natural realm and now it's been
[41:17] loosed in the ecclesiastical realm. He
[41:20] said, and he said, just in the hour to
[41:23] call the bride,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; right? So that's when it would be loose.
[41:26] He said, how loosed in the
[41:27] ecclesiastical church spirit? Loosed
[41:30] upon what? Not upon the denominations,
[41:32] upon the bride. He said, but here you'll
[41:34] get it. the bride will not go through
[41:36] that time. So when it's loosed in a
[41:38] natural way, we won't be here.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Right? A lot of people think, well,
[41:45] we're going to get killed. We're going
[41:46] to the church doors are going to shut be
[41:48] shut. And brother said they would be. He
[41:49] said, but before they can shut the
[41:51] church doors, we'll go up.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Before they can shut it, we'll
[41:55] go. I'm so thankful for that. So
[41:57] thankful. He gives us an opportunity to
[41:59] hear the gospel and to preach the
[42:00] gospel. We should take advantage of
[42:02] that. One day it's GOING TO BE CLOSED
[42:04] and that day will be gone.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Uh they've proven they can do it. They
[42:09] proved that during co
[42:10] &gt;&gt; they can close the church doors, but we
[42:12] won't close our doors.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Right. We're going home.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If we if they close the
[42:20] doors of this church, we're still going
[42:21] to have church one way or another.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; I've made up my mind as a pastor. I I
[42:26] don't want to ever live through another
[42:27] time where we can't have church.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Let's have church. It's too important to
[42:31] us. It's too precious to us. You say,
[42:33] "Brother Ben, there's not a whole lot of
[42:34] people on a Wednesday night." But do you
[42:36] realize what could happen in this
[42:37] environment when the saints of God are
[42:39] gathered together? We're in heavenly
[42:41] places in Christ. I've seen sinners
[42:43] come. I've seen people restored. I've
[42:45] seen marriages restored and children
[42:47] come to God AND PEOPLE CHANGE. WHAT IS
[42:49] IT? Because the saints of God are coming
[42:51] together, worshiping together. Let's
[42:54] keep doing that as long as we can.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so what's happening now is
[43:01] not repentance.
[43:03] Did you know that the Catholic Church is
[43:05] not repenting of what they believed,
[43:08] &gt;&gt; it's flatteries.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; And and because the Bible says
[43:12] Revelation 2:21, I gave her space to
[43:14] repent
[43:15] &gt;&gt; of her fornication and she repented not.
[43:18] So she she refused to repent a long time
[43:21] ago.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this and it
[43:24] directly relates to this situation. He
[43:26] said, 'Now don't be confused and start
[43:28] thinking that the church of Rome has
[43:31] repented of her slaughter of the saints
[43:33] because she is attempting to unite with
[43:35] the Protestants by making her creeds.
[43:39] Is the message perfect or not?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; See, she's attempting to unite with the
[43:44] Protestants by making her creeds line up
[43:47] with Protestant creeds.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Is that not what we saw this week?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Right? Is that not what he said? that
[43:54] well we're going to declare Mary's not a
[43:56] co- redeemer. Well, the Protestants ate
[43:58] that up.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Well, the Catholics are just like us
[44:01] now. They put their faith in Christ.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; What are they doing? Attempting to unite
[44:05] with the Protestants by making her
[44:06] creeds to line up with Protestant
[44:08] creeds.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "But not once has she ever
[44:12] apologized and said she was wrong for
[44:13] her mass murders. And she won't either.
[44:16] No matter how mellow and sweet she
[44:18] appears at this particular time, she
[44:21] will yet rise up to kill. For murder
[44:24] lies in her evil and unrepentant heart.
[44:27] So there will come a day when they'll
[44:28] kill people physically just like they
[44:30] did during the dark ages. Right? That's
[44:33] coming. And thank God we'll be gone when
[44:35] that time comes. Yes.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; The second news item that I saw was the
[44:42] Pope visiting Nya.
[44:45] And so he he visited the spot at the 17
[44:50] 1700th anniversary
[44:52] of the Nyian council. He actually visits
[44:55] the very spot of Nika.
[44:59] And this is interesting because they
[45:03] they didn't find the church that they h
[45:05] held the council of Nika in until 2014.
[45:10] So they've only known about this for
[45:12] about 11 years. And in the last few
[45:15] years, there's been a drought. And
[45:17] what's happened is the waters have
[45:19] receded. So when they found it, they
[45:20] found it by scanning a lake. And over
[45:23] the last few years, the waters have
[45:25] receded until now, you can actually walk
[45:28] in that in that church where the Council
[45:31] of Nika was held.
[45:33] I believe it there's something happening
[45:36] right now,
[45:37] &gt;&gt; right? You've got an American pope, the
[45:40] 1700th anniversary of Nika, he's going
[45:43] back to the spot for the first time. It
[45:45] wasn't even possible for them to go back
[45:47] to Nika until now. Now, be honest with
[45:51] me tonight. All right, I want you to
[45:52] raise your hands. If you know the
[45:54] significance of Nya and the Nyian
[45:58] council to what we believe, raise your
[45:59] hand.
[46:01] I'm not going to make you explain it.
[46:04] So, so we need to explain it a little
[46:06] bit so that the rest of you understand.
[46:08] I think most of you know or at least you
[46:10] know kind of what it is. But the reason
[46:13] that Nika is significant is because it
[46:16] was the first worldwide council
[46:20] and it made significant changes. So
[46:22] before that the Christians were
[46:23] scattered all over the face of the
[46:25] earth. So this is about 300 years after
[46:28] the death of Jesus
[46:30] and they they pull in all the Christians
[46:33] all the the heads of the churches which
[46:36] had come to be called bishops because
[46:38] what happened is a spirit of nickelism.
[46:41] Nicolatanism means to conquer the ley.
[46:44] And so what nickelanism is is when uh
[46:47] one bishop sets themselves up over
[46:48] another bishop, right? Or a bishop over
[46:51] a deacon, a over a preacher, over a
[46:53] pastor. You know, they have levels of it
[46:55] and a hierarchy. And so uh they [snorts]
[46:59] called all these men in these
[47:00] hierarchies to come together from from
[47:02] the whole earth. It was the very first
[47:04] what they call ecumenical. Echimemenical
[47:06] means worldwide council. And so the word
[47:10] ecumenical has come to mean a worldwide
[47:12] gathering of believers of Christians
[47:14] because and this was the very first time
[47:17] that it was called. The council was
[47:19] called by Emperor Constantine. And
[47:21] you've heard of Emperor Constantine. He
[47:22] was the first so-called Christian
[47:24] emperor. But at this time he wasn't even
[47:26] a Christian. He was still a pagan
[47:28] offering pagan sacrifices. And he was
[47:31] running the church council because
[47:33] that's the way people defer to power.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Right. And and brother Brandham typed
[47:38] that in some place he said it'd be like
[47:40] having the mayor come to your church and
[47:41] then you start not preaching what you
[47:43] used to preach [snorts]
[47:44] &gt;&gt; right [laughter]
[47:46] &gt;&gt; because somebody important has come to
[47:47] the church. So now the Constantine came
[47:52] and presided over it and he called them
[47:54] all together. And his his interest in it
[47:57] was to stop them from fighting because a
[47:59] great schism had broke out in the church
[48:02] over who God was, right? And how to
[48:04] baptize because Christians had always
[48:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:09] Christ just like we do today. And even
[48:12] the the history will tell you that
[48:14] there's no no one in the Bible was
[48:16] baptized in the titles of the father,
[48:18] son, and holy ghost. Baptized in the
[48:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm I'm
[48:21] explaining this in a way even our kids,
[48:23] I hope, will get it. So before that
[48:25] time, baptism was correct mostly. And
[48:28] yet there had been a spirit come in a
[48:30] false doctrine that taught the people to
[48:32] baptize differently. And Constantine
[48:34] comes in to settle the argument being a
[48:37] pagan. And of course, he settles it in a
[48:40] pagan way, right? for father, son, and
[48:42] holy ghost. And so they called them all
[48:45] together. Uh brother Brandham said it
[48:47] like this. He said they didn't believe
[48:48] in three gods in the beginning of the
[48:50] church. He said you can't find that sort
[48:52] of belief amongst the apostles. It was
[48:53] after the apostolic age that this theory
[48:56] came in and really become an issue and a
[48:58] cardinal doctrine of the nian council.
[49:00] So the simple way to understand the nian
[49:02] council is that's where people started
[49:04] baptizing wrong. So if any of your
[49:07] friends ask you why do you baptize in
[49:08] the name of Jesus name the Lord Jesus
[49:10] Christ it's because that's the way the
[49:12] church did it right the early church did
[49:15] it that's the way they did it in the
[49:16] Bible it's what the Bible says but now
[49:18] they start baptizing differently and
[49:20] they formed a trinity doctrine which is
[49:23] three persons
[49:25] right in a godhead and so uh I don't
[49:29] know how to explain this to the kids uh
[49:32] but maybe some of you older people will
[49:34] help too so the trinitarian Ians believe
[49:36] that. Stand up, Jason. Wyatt, stand up.
[49:39] Uh, Peter, stand up. I need three of you
[49:41] to stand up. Um, you stand up for me.
[49:44] Yeah, there we go. So, I got three of
[49:46] them. That's good. They're spread out.
[49:48] So, so Peter be the father.
[49:51] She's a little bit older, got a beard,
[49:55] right? And then, so you're not Peter.
[49:57] You're a different person. You got a
[49:58] different name, right? So, uh, so this
[50:01] would be the the son and this is the
[50:03] Holy Ghost. I've heard a trinitarian
[50:05] explain it this way. He said, "The
[50:06] father and the son get together and talk
[50:08] about what to do on the earth." And they
[50:11] hashed that out and he said, "The Holy
[50:13] Ghost is the divine eavesdropper,
[50:16] right? That that eavesdrops on these
[50:18] other two people's conversations,
[50:21] &gt;&gt; right? So that and they believe that all
[50:23] all these three people are of one
[50:25] substance. That's the trinity doctrine.
[50:28] But it's three distinct separate
[50:30] persons. I knew people in the western
[50:32] church that believe they could tell
[50:34] which person they were praying to
[50:37] at which time. But we believe the Lord,
[50:39] the Bible says the Lord thy God is how
[50:41] many?
[50:43] &gt;&gt; One God,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; right? So if if pe if Peter was the
[50:47] father and he's God, and this is the son
[50:49] and he's God, and this is the Holy
[50:50] Spirit, and he's God, and they're three
[50:52] different persons, you have three gods,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; But if but if you sit down and you sit
[50:59] down and he's he's one, right? But what
[51:02] it is is the father is the son, right?
[51:05] I'm a father and I'm a son. Peter's not
[51:07] yet, but
[51:09] Peter's just a son, but I'm a father and
[51:13] I'm a son,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; right? And I have a spirit in me,
[51:17] &gt;&gt; right? And and what it is, it's God
[51:19] manifesting himself in three different
[51:21] ways.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; It's all God all the time. It's always
[51:25] the father,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; right? And he is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Right. And so when he come to the earth,
[51:31] he just made himself a body.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Right. And come down and lived among us
[51:36] because he God is a spirit. You could be
[51:38] seated. God is a spirit. He don't he
[51:40] don't need uh he no man has seen him at
[51:43] any time, but he made himself a body. We
[51:45] talked about that Sunday. He
[51:46] condescended himself. He stepped down
[51:49] into our world. I'm so glad that he did.
[51:51] Yeah.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; So, we don't believe in three different
[51:53] persons.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Right? We believe in one person, God.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. He
[52:02] can manifest himself however he wants
[52:04] to.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Right? He can pour himself. All of God
[52:07] was poured into Christ.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; All that Christ was was poured into the
[52:12] church. So, where does he live now? See,
[52:14] these three people can't live in you,
[52:16] but God lives in you.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; So, a trinitarian will tell you, "Well,
[52:19] the Holy Ghost is in your heart. The
[52:20] Holy Spirit's in your heart, but that's
[52:21] only part of God.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; But we believe that God lives in your
[52:25] heart. And he is the Lord Jesus. He is
[52:27] the Holy Ghost. He is the father.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's a little bit simplistic.
[52:33] And some of you can correct, brother
[52:34] Stewart. You can correct that later. But
[52:37] but that's basically what it is. So
[52:40] that's where they chose three. And why
[52:42] would they choose three over one?
[52:43] Because they were pagan.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Right. They they had never been
[52:47] converted.
[52:49] right to believe in one God. And it's
[52:51] actually the first thing I I believe
[52:54] that a believer as a believer is the
[52:56] very first thing that you learn, the
[52:57] very first revelation that you
[52:59] understand. The Lord your God is one
[53:01] God,
[53:02] &gt;&gt; right? He's just one. And and that's why
[53:04] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:07] Christ. We baptize in the name of the
[53:10] father and the son and the holy ghost.
[53:12] Those are titles. I'm a father. I'm a
[53:15] son. I have a spirit. But I am Benjamin
[53:19] Puit. That's my name. The Lord Jesus
[53:21] Christ is his name. I'm so glad that the
[53:25] angel called his name Jesus. And said it
[53:27] was Emmanuel. Said that Jesus was
[53:30] Emanuel. Emanuel means God with us.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Right? So that that's who he is. All
[53:36] right. Everybody understand that?
[53:38] &gt;&gt; So Nika is where that changed.
[53:42] That's where it changed the teaching on
[53:43] it.
[53:45] So brother Brandon said it was after the
[53:47] apostolic ages theory came in really
[53:48] become an issue in a cardinal doctrine
[53:50] of the nian council. The doctrine of
[53:52] godhead caused a two-way split at na.
[53:54] From that split there come two extremes.
[53:55] One went into pol pol polytheism. Did I
[53:58] say that right? Believing in three gods
[54:01] and the other went into unitarianism.
[54:03] But the revelation through John by the
[54:05] spirit to the churches was I am the lord
[54:08] Jesus Christ and I am all of it. You
[54:10] want to see the godhead? Read revelation
[54:12] chapter one. He said, "I'm the alpha and
[54:14] the omega. I'm the first and the last,
[54:16] the beginning and the end,
[54:18] &gt;&gt; right? He's all of it."
[54:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "There isn't any other god."
[54:21] And he put his seal on this revelation.
[54:24] So na is where it was decided that the
[54:27] main issue for the church was a
[54:28] trinitarian baptism. And those who were
[54:30] baptized differently would be
[54:32] excommunicated from the church. So they
[54:34] and they would still recite the Nyian
[54:36] creed and at every mass they still do
[54:39] that and and they still baptize in
[54:41] titles. It's a very big deal to the
[54:43] Catholic Church and it's a very big deal
[54:46] to the mainline Protestant church,
[54:48] right? They they all can agree on that.
[54:51] That's their ground of fellowship. But
[54:55] we don't fellowship under a trinity
[54:57] doctrine because it's a creed, not not
[54:59] the word of God. We fellowship on the
[55:02] fullness of the atonement, which is the
[55:04] revealed word of the hour. So you say,
[55:06] "Brother Ben, how do I know I can
[55:07] fellowship with someone?" What do they
[55:08] believe? The revealed word of the hour.
[55:11] That's where we fellowship. That's what
[55:13] our fellowship comes around. Amen. So,
[55:16] uh, this happened, this nine council
[55:18] happened during the Pergamus church age.
[55:20] If you look at that, I don't know if you
[55:21] can read it, but that's the one actually
[55:23] from the church age book. Brother
[55:24] Brandham, uh, drew or had drawn where it
[55:27] says Pergamum right there under Martin.
[55:30] Martin was the St. Martin was the, uh,
[55:33] messenger to that age. It started in
[55:35] 312. Nice council was in 3:25.
[55:39] So it happened during that age and
[55:41] that's where we read our text Revelation
[55:42] 2:14. He said, 'I have a few things
[55:44] against thee because thou hast there are
[55:46] them that hold the doctrine of Balum who
[55:48] taught Bailac to cast a stumbling block
[55:50] before the children of Israel to eat
[55:52] things sacrificed to idols and to commit
[55:54] fornication. So it's the doctrine of
[55:56] Balum. What was the doctrine of Balum?
[55:58] You get that in Numbers chapter 25. I'm
[56:00] going to speed up to save time, but you
[56:02] get that in Numbers 25. Read verses 1
[56:04] through3 when you get home. And it talks
[56:06] about how Israel joined himself to Bel
[56:09] Peior. So remember, Balam went down to
[56:13] curse the children of Israel and he
[56:15] couldn't do it
[56:16] &gt;&gt; because he was a real He was a he was a
[56:18] he was a real prophet,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; but he was false. He He wasn't
[56:22] converted. He He had a real gift to be a
[56:25] prophet,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; but he was a false prophet because he
[56:28] was false at the bottom. Type that to
[56:30] anointing once at the end time, but he
[56:32] was a real prophet. So he couldn't curse
[56:34] Israel. They took him up, showed him
[56:36] every bad thing Israel ever did. Aren't
[56:38] you glad that's the way God looks at
[56:40] you?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Man, he the devil COULD SHOW HIM
[56:42] EVERYTHING that you did wrong. And God
[56:44] says, "I can't see nothing bad in them."
[56:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what Balam said. And actually
[56:50] gave some great prophecies. In fact, uh
[56:53] that's how we know that Moab was an
[56:55] organization. Did you know that? And
[56:58] Israel was not. And an organization and
[57:01] a believer cannot walk together. Numbers
[57:03] 23:9. And Balam's prophecy, he said,
[57:05] "For from the top of the rocks I see
[57:08] him, and from the hills I behold him.
[57:10] Lo, the people shall dwell alone and
[57:12] shall not be reckoned among the
[57:14] nations." Other words, they weren't a
[57:16] nation with a king and an economy. They
[57:18] were a called out people of God.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; We're called out people of God,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; right? We don't have a headquarters
[57:25] somewhere telling us when to have
[57:26] church,
[57:28] &gt;&gt; right? We're called out people of God.
[57:30] And what that what what that is is
[57:32] denominationalism. It is. And there's
[57:35] nothing else I can say about it. It's a
[57:37] spirit. Maybe good people, but a spirit
[57:39] of denominationalism
[57:40] because that's the doctrine of Balum.
[57:42] Well, we're all the same and and so
[57:44] let's just join ourselves. But we cannot
[57:46] join ourselves with any word but his
[57:49] word.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Our unity comes first with the
[57:53] word. And that causes us to be in unity
[57:55] with one another. When you see a church
[57:57] that don't fellowship with nobody,
[57:58] they're the only ones that are right. is
[58:00] because they haven't come in unity with
[58:01] the word.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:03] &gt;&gt; If you come in unity with the word,
[58:04] you'll fellowship with your brother and
[58:06] sister
[58:06] &gt;&gt; and have a little have a little uh uh
[58:09] grace for them. Maybe they have a little
[58:10] bit different idea than you do, but you
[58:12] fellowship around the revealed word of
[58:13] the hour.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, it church, it's a shame when
[58:18] people in a local area can't fellowship
[58:20] together with people they believe
[58:21] exactly alike.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; It's a shame,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; right? That's That's not a You say,
[58:28] "Well, we don't fellowship with nobody."
[58:30] That is not a compliment.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; It's an embarrassment.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for being a little bit hard
[58:38] on that, but it's true. Like, we got to
[58:40] fellowship with people, but we
[58:42] fellowship not for the sake of unity
[58:44] alone. We fellowship around the word.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Right? If I can't preach the message, we
[58:48] don't have no fellowship with you.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Right. But if I can preach the message
[58:51] and you can preach, we may have a little
[58:53] bit different idea of it, but we have a
[58:54] ground of fellowship. Right?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Something we can fellowship around.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; So true Christians cannot join
[59:01] themselves to idolatry and spiritual
[59:04] fornication.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Constantine uh in this in this part. So
[59:09] if you look at Constantine, he plays the
[59:11] part of King Bailac in the story of
[59:12] Balum. Constantine bringing them up to
[59:15] the feast. Brother Ram called it the
[59:17] Nyian feast. He brings them up to the
[59:20] feast and calls them up and that was the
[59:22] Nyian council. So Constantine invited
[59:24] the nominal Christian brother said first
[59:26] Christian church of Rome. There were two
[59:28] churches of Rome. The second Christian
[59:30] church of Rome split off the first
[59:32] because the first became idolattors. The
[59:34] first Christian church of Rome he said
[59:36] Constantine invited them to help him get
[59:38] the Christians behind him as they were a
[59:40] very large body. The outcome was that I
[59:42] see council of 325 there. The Christians
[59:45] both true and nominal came together at
[59:47] the invitation of Constantine. So the
[59:49] true ones came too. Brother Brandon said
[59:51] the true Christians had no business
[59:52] going up to the meeting, right? No
[59:55] business going up to that meeting. Why?
[59:57] There was people there they couldn't
[59:58] fellowship with. THEY HOW CAN TWO WALK
[1:00:00] TOGETHER unless they be agreed? They
[1:00:02] were not believing the revealed word.
[1:00:04] They were already worshiping idols,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; right? [snorts]
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Setting them up in churches.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; But he said the real believers, he said,
[1:00:12] knew they were out of place and left.
[1:00:13] But to those who remain, Constantine
[1:00:15] gave the state's treasury along with
[1:00:17] political and physical force. The people
[1:00:20] were introduced to idol worship and
[1:00:21] spiritism. Statues with names of saints
[1:00:24] were placed in the buildings. People
[1:00:26] were taught to commune with the dead or
[1:00:28] pray to saints which is nothing more or
[1:00:30] less than spiritism.
[1:00:32] For the food that man truly needs, even
[1:00:34] the word of God, they were given creeds
[1:00:36] and dogmas and rituals which were also
[1:00:38] enforced by the state. And above all,
[1:00:40] they were given three gods with the
[1:00:42] triple compound name of the one true
[1:00:44] God. water baptism in the name of the
[1:00:46] Lord Jesus Christ gave way to the pagan
[1:00:48] baptism of three titles. But brother
[1:00:50] Brandham re reinforces the idea that
[1:00:53] real believers ought not to have gone
[1:00:54] there. He said but watch this doctrine
[1:00:57] of Balum. He said it's the deliberate
[1:00:59] maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the
[1:01:01] people to them by leading the people
[1:01:03] deliberately into the sin of unbelief.
[1:01:07] He talked about the nickelan doctrine
[1:01:08] that being the corruption of clergy. He
[1:01:10] said, "Balamism is a subjection of the
[1:01:12] people to their system of creed and
[1:01:14] worship in order to hold them." I I'm
[1:01:16] moving fast now, but I want us to get to
[1:01:19] something here at the end before we go.
[1:01:21] I won't hold you long tonight. But he he
[1:01:24] said it was decreed and dogmas formed
[1:01:26] into church tenants. It was the doctrine
[1:01:28] of the Roman Catholic Church. So, they
[1:01:29] didn't just bring them up for a
[1:01:30] fellowship meeting and let them go home.
[1:01:32] They brought them up for a fellowship
[1:01:33] meeting and then said, "You know, we all
[1:01:35] need to say the same thing."
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Right? And so when they come to the
[1:01:40] meeting, then they were forced to say
[1:01:42] the same thing or be excommunicated.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And many of them did not. Not everybody
[1:01:46] who came to the meeting signed up, but
[1:01:48] they were hunted down, excommunicated,
[1:01:51] and and exiled. And later on, they would
[1:01:53] even kill them because they didn't do
[1:01:55] it. And there were actual fist fights.
[1:01:57] Did you know that? Fist fights. Santa
[1:02:00] Claus got in a fist fight. St. Nicholas,
[1:02:03] who was a Catholic saint, got a
[1:02:07] this is history supposedly got in a got
[1:02:10] in a fist fight with somebody at the
[1:02:11] Nian Council over the doctrine of the
[1:02:14] Trinity. He was pro- Trinity, by the
[1:02:16] way.
[1:02:19] And uh Santa Claus is not an elf that
[1:02:20] rides around. Am I hurting anybody? I
[1:02:22] don't want to hurt your
[1:02:25] Hope you don't teach your kids that.
[1:02:27] But uh you know Santa Claus is not an
[1:02:30] elf that rides around and goes all over
[1:02:31] the world stuff like that. It St.
[1:02:33] Nicholas was a real person and but he
[1:02:36] was a Catholic. He was he was on the
[1:02:37] wrong side of history if you read it. He
[1:02:41] he actually got in a fist fight with
[1:02:42] somebody about it. I don't know who won.
[1:02:45] He had lots of extra padding.
[1:02:48] He could take a few hits. It's a joke.
[1:02:56] Sister Sandra got it.
[1:02:59] So, Brother Brandham said that he said
[1:03:02] they were not given the true food, the
[1:03:04] word. Oh, how we should thank God for
[1:03:06] hearing the word,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; for the hearing of the word. Be able to
[1:03:09] go to church and hear the word. Be able
[1:03:10] to turn on a tape and hear the word. We
[1:03:12] ought to thank God for that. Be able to
[1:03:14] read our Bibles and see and have the
[1:03:15] word of God. They didn't even have that.
[1:03:17] Later on in the dark ages, they even
[1:03:19] took their Bibles away from them.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; We've got the ability to read it. I I
[1:03:22] say let's get back into it. Let's read
[1:03:24] it again.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Let's find out what's in it.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; So he said Babylonian paganism was
[1:03:30] wrapped up in Christian terminology.
[1:03:33] People still do that.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And that very same spirit and doctrine
[1:03:37] is right amongst all someone say all
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Protestants and it's called
[1:03:41] denomination.
[1:03:43] Nickelanism is organization humanizing
[1:03:46] the leadership of the church thereby
[1:03:48] deposing the spirit. Balumism is
[1:03:52] denominationalism which takes the church
[1:03:54] manual instead of the Bible. And right
[1:03:57] to this hour, many of God's people are
[1:03:59] caught in the snare of
[1:04:00] denominationalism. And God is crying to
[1:04:02] them, "Come out of her, my people, THAT
[1:04:04] YOU BE NOT PARTAKERS of her sins, that
[1:04:06] you receive not of her plagues."
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; We're living in a time, there was a time
[1:04:11] God winked in ignorance. But brother
[1:04:12] Bram said, "Ignorance will not be a
[1:04:13] defense to those caught in that system."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Right? at the end for the clergy to
[1:04:18] organize themselves with one rank over
[1:04:20] another until they're finally headed up
[1:04:21] by a president. Listen to this is a
[1:04:25] manifestation of the Antichrist spirit.
[1:04:28] Let me put that in plain language. If
[1:04:29] there's a pastor somewhere that could
[1:04:32] tell me what to do or kick me out
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; if I didn't do it out of fellowship,
[1:04:38] then that is a Antichrist spirit.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; That makes it very plain. But if there's
[1:04:46] any leadership above the local church,
[1:04:49] it's not scriptural.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's an antichrist spirit. And even the
[1:04:53] local church as pastor, I serve the
[1:04:55] people, right? You could vote me out at
[1:04:58] any point in time. Don't get any ideas,
[1:05:00] but
[1:05:02] but you could absolutely could. Right?
[1:05:05] If the people decided not I wasn't to be
[1:05:07] the pastor anymore, I wouldn't be the
[1:05:09] pastor anymore. I I exist at the
[1:05:11] pleasure of the people and I serve the
[1:05:13] people, but I got to serve the word
[1:05:14] first. I believe that's why you would
[1:05:16] want me to be a pastor because I got to
[1:05:18] serve the word first. So, we don't cater
[1:05:20] to people, but we do serve people.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; But if you see someone with rank over
[1:05:25] another, one rank, so this this person
[1:05:28] is a pastor, but they're a pastor with
[1:05:30] more authority. That shouldn't be.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Right. It's a manifestation of an
[1:05:35] antichrist spirit regardless of how
[1:05:37] wonderful and necessary it may seem.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It is. You say, "Well, it works." It It
[1:05:45] does. Denomination works. Some of those
[1:05:47] that have left the message say, "Well,
[1:05:48] the message is a a mess sometimes
[1:05:50] because of denomination." I thank God
[1:05:52] that we're not a denomination. I thank
[1:05:54] God that I can preach the WORD AND I
[1:05:56] DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT
[1:05:58] I'm going to preach on Sunday. I don't
[1:05:59] HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE TELL me where
[1:06:01] I can go to church or what I can do or
[1:06:03] or what time to have church or or what
[1:06:05] time not to have church. I I don't have
[1:06:07] anybody telling me that. And and it's up
[1:06:10] to us as A CHURCH TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT
[1:06:12] TO DO. AND we need to stay with the
[1:06:14] word.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; And that means THAT NO MATTER WHAT OTHER
[1:06:16] CHURCHES in the MESSAGE DO, LET'S STAY
[1:06:18] WITH THE WORD.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; LET'S SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID, let's
[1:06:21] believe the message of the hour.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; No matter what anybody else does.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; But thank God when we can have
[1:06:27] fellowship, right? That's wonderful. But
[1:06:30] but our church is not governed by any
[1:06:32] other church. And it's it's the Holy
[1:06:34] Spirit is to be the leader of the
[1:06:36] church. Is that right?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; We all we all have to submit to the Holy
[1:06:40] Spirit and leading the church and who he
[1:06:43] places in in in position in the church.
[1:06:47] Brother Bram said it's nothing but human
[1:06:48] reasoning taking the place of the word.
[1:06:50] And any person who's in the organized
[1:06:51] denomination is right in the midst of an
[1:06:52] antichrist system. He said, "Let me say
[1:06:55] this, make it very plain. I'm not
[1:06:56] against the people. I'm against the
[1:06:58] system.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; That doctrine of balamism led the church
[1:07:02] into a dark age.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He said when any religious people
[1:07:06] embrace both nickelanism and balamism
[1:07:08] and has the political, financial, and
[1:07:10] physical power to back it up, there's
[1:07:12] only one direction they can go. Do you
[1:07:13] see? Look, go look at the dark ages.
[1:07:16] Study that and see what they became.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're at?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; It's looked innocent for a while, but
[1:07:22] we're right back there again.
[1:07:25] another na,
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; right? That's what they're trying to do.
[1:07:30] And that's the way they come in the
[1:07:31] first time.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; They come in with flatteries and they
[1:07:34] said, "We're all one. Let's all get
[1:07:36] along. Let's have a feast. Let's have a
[1:07:37] counsel." And they weren't. That's
[1:07:40] exactly what they're doing right now.
[1:07:43] And brother, it's a Jezebel doctrine as
[1:07:44] well. You find that in in Revelation 2
[1:07:47] and three. But chapter 2 and chapter 3,
[1:07:50] it was now the church with the assured
[1:07:52] voice. He said that took over. So before
[1:07:54] they were scattered, but now they spoke
[1:07:56] with one voice. There's power in unity,
[1:07:59] right? There's power in unity in the
[1:08:00] local church. But they had power in a
[1:08:02] unity under a false word, under a dogma
[1:08:05] and a decree. So they they spoke with
[1:08:08] one voice and wow with power they drank
[1:08:10] the blood of the martyrs until the true
[1:08:11] Christians were all but exterminated and
[1:08:13] there was hardly any word left and
[1:08:15] little manifestation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:17] I love this. But the true vine struggled
[1:08:20] and survived.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's the story OF MY LIFE.
[1:08:23] STRUGGLE AND SURVIVE. YOU MIGHT BE
[1:08:25] FACING a dark TIME RIGHT NOW. YOU MIGHT
[1:08:27] HAVE EVERYTHING AGAINST YOU. But but
[1:08:30] Christianity was illegal at ONE POINT.
[1:08:32] WE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE BIBLES. We
[1:08:33] couldn't do that. BUT THE TRUE VINE
[1:08:35] STRUGGLED AND SURVIVED IN THE DARKEST
[1:08:37] PART OF THE DARK AGES. SOMEBODY MADE IT.
[1:08:40] I BELIEVE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO MAKE IT
[1:08:41] OUT OF LEODYSIA. Might as well be us.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; The true vine struggled and survived.
[1:08:46] Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BE FACING THE WORST MOMENT OF
[1:08:49] YOUR LIFE, BUT THE TRUE VINE STRUGGLES
[1:08:51] and survives.
[1:08:53] Oh, I think of those in the hospital
[1:08:54] tonight and those not able to be here.
[1:08:56] THOSE THAT ARE SICK. YOU MIGHT BE SICK,
[1:08:58] BUT THE TRUE VINE struggles and
[1:09:00] survives.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to this current
[1:09:05] push for another ecumenical council?
[1:09:07] Well, brother Brandham told us
[1:09:10] he said this ecumenical move will end up
[1:09:14] with Rome at the head.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision
[1:09:17] it that way.
[1:09:19] This is so because in Revelation 17:3-6,
[1:09:22] it states that the mystery
[1:09:24] Babylon, is seated on the beast. She's
[1:09:25] controlling the last or fourth empire.
[1:09:28] That's is that's Daniel's vision.
[1:09:31] Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the of the uh
[1:09:34] four gentile kingdoms. He said the
[1:09:37] fourth empire, the Roman church is doing
[1:09:38] that with the world church system under
[1:09:40] her. Rome will be controlling this image
[1:09:43] church system will be obedient to Rome
[1:09:44] because Rome controls the gold of the
[1:09:46] world. [snorts] He said, "Thus all the
[1:09:48] people have to belong to the world
[1:09:49] church system or be at the mercy of the
[1:09:51] elements for they cannot buy or sell."
[1:09:53] This is where it's headed to cannot buy
[1:09:56] or sell without the mark of the beast in
[1:09:57] the hand or head. This mark in the head
[1:09:59] means they will have to take the
[1:10:00] doctrine of the world church system. So,
[1:10:02] I know a lot of people say, "Well, the
[1:10:03] mark's going to be a chip. It's going to
[1:10:04] be this or that." Brother Brandham told
[1:10:06] us what it was going to be. He said it's
[1:10:08] the what it is. He said they take the
[1:10:11] doctrine of the world church system,
[1:10:12] which is trinitarianism, etc., and the
[1:10:15] mark in the hand which means to do the
[1:10:16] will of the world church with this great
[1:10:18] power the church systems will persecute
[1:10:20] the true bride
[1:10:22] listen what they'll do during the
[1:10:24] persecution this image will try to keep
[1:10:26] the bride from preaching and teaching
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; the image will the protestants will
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; right people think the Catholics have to
[1:10:36] take over brother Random said in 1960
[1:10:38] said they already have
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; he said they already have he said this
[1:10:43] image will try to keep the bride from
[1:10:44] preaching and teaching. Her ministers
[1:10:46] will be forbidden to give comfort and
[1:10:48] truth to the people who need it. You see
[1:10:50] why we we we strike at that spirit that
[1:10:52] would do that because we we we we are
[1:10:55] commanded by the word to preach the
[1:10:57] gospel.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Commanded to do it.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; And it's the image of the beast that'll
[1:11:01] try to keep the bride from preaching and
[1:11:03] teaching.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; But he said, "But before the antichrist
[1:11:06] in person before, that's the part I
[1:11:08] like. before takes over this complete
[1:11:11] world system of churches. The true
[1:11:13] church will be taken away from this
[1:11:15] world to be with the Lord. THAT'S MY
[1:11:17] FUTURE. I'M NOT looking to be shut up.
[1:11:20] I'm looking to go up.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The true church will be taken away
[1:11:23] from this world to be with the Lord. God
[1:11:25] will catch away his bride for the great
[1:11:27] marriage supper of the lamb. Aren't you
[1:11:29] looking forward to it?
[1:11:31] Notice brother Brand said, "Lucifer
[1:11:33] comes in cunning like he did then and by
[1:11:34] temptations and false promises of power
[1:11:37] apart from the word of God. He did the
[1:11:39] same at Na Rome. He's doing the same
[1:11:41] today. He's doing the same today at the
[1:11:44] World Council of Ecumenical Churches." I
[1:11:46] read to you, I didn't bring the uh the
[1:11:49] article tonight to save time, but I read
[1:11:51] to you back a few months ago how the
[1:11:53] World Council was gathering again this
[1:11:55] year to honor Nika. And they actually
[1:11:58] said, "Let's all unite together." and
[1:12:00] they get together and I I actually I
[1:12:02] think I did print them. They're probably
[1:12:03] laying on the printer back here, but I
[1:12:05] well I put part of it on there. The
[1:12:07] global ecumenical gathering in Egypt,
[1:12:09] advanced hopes for visible church unity.
[1:12:11] When we talked about what's going to
[1:12:12] happen this year, it happened. They
[1:12:14] gathered in Egypt and that's the council
[1:12:17] of bishops of the United Methodist
[1:12:18] Church. I found the Anglican church and
[1:12:20] different ones, all the mainline
[1:12:22] churches, even Pentecostal churches that
[1:12:24] came together in ecumenical. was the
[1:12:27] most significant gathering of the World
[1:12:29] Council of Churches since 1960.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Which is what brother Brandon was
[1:12:35] talking about. He saw the beginning of
[1:12:36] it. I believe we're seeing the end of
[1:12:38] it.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "Let's all unite
[1:12:42] together." The Pope says, "I want all my
[1:12:44] ecumenical brethren out there to unite
[1:12:46] with me. We're one." That's right. In
[1:12:48] organizations, you are one. But that has
[1:12:50] nothing to do with the bride of Christ.
[1:12:52] Not a thing, brother. You'll never wash
[1:12:54] her in anything like that. Oh, it's
[1:12:56] going home time, church. It's harvest
[1:12:58] time. I know some people say, "Well,
[1:13:00] that's boring preaching. It don't mean
[1:13:01] anything." It ought to mean something to
[1:13:02] the bride because we're not a part of
[1:13:04] that world system. WE'VE BEEN CALLED OUT
[1:13:06] OF THAT. IT OUGHT TO BRING A
[1:13:07] THANKFULNESS TO OUR heart
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; to know where we're at, what time it is.
[1:13:12] Amen. What hour it is, it's harvest
[1:13:14] time. The seeds that have been sown,
[1:13:16] Brother said, denominational seeds were
[1:13:18] sown. An ecumenical seed was sown in the
[1:13:21] 60s and it's coming to maturity.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he told us he said IF THOSE
[1:13:26] SEEDS ARE COMING TO MATURITY THEN THE
[1:13:28] BRIDE SEED HAS GOT TO COME TO MATURITY
[1:13:30] AS WELL. THE WORD HAS GOT TO COME TO
[1:13:32] maturity at the same time.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; The wheat and the tears he said was from
[1:13:36] the first age until now grown side by
[1:13:38] side are harvested. What na this is
[1:13:42] powerful set out to accomplish
[1:13:45] has finally come to pass. That's where
[1:13:48] they're headed to.
[1:13:50] With all the might of organization, the
[1:13:52] false church turns away from any vestage
[1:13:54] of truth and with political might
[1:13:56] reinforces herself with state backing
[1:13:59] and sets out to eradicate forever the
[1:14:01] true believer. But just when she is
[1:14:04] about to accomplish her cowardly plot,
[1:14:07] oh my, the wheat is gathered into the
[1:14:10] garner.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; I've had people ask me, "Aren't you
[1:14:13] afraid to be on the internet, be open
[1:14:15] like you are?" Well, they got your
[1:14:16] number anyway.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; They know where we're at,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; but
[1:14:24] they know where we're at. But look, but
[1:14:25] look at it like this. Like they're I'll
[1:14:28] be glad to give them my address
[1:14:31] because when they come looking for me to
[1:14:32] do this, when their cowardly plot comes
[1:14:35] into effect, I ain't going to be here.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; If I'm here, we got bigger problems,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; right? But I thank God. I believe I'm
[1:14:44] part of the bride that's going home.
[1:14:45] Aren't you glad to be part OF THE BRIDE?
[1:14:47] SO, THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE THING. It's a
[1:14:49] positive thing. WE DON'T PREACH FEAR AND
[1:14:52] AND JUDGMENT, ALL THESE THINGS. SAY,
[1:14:53] "WELL, you oh, you better be scared cuz
[1:14:56] the end times ARE COMING." NO, WE OUGHT
[1:14:57] TO BE REJOICE. HE SAID, "LIFT UP YOUR
[1:14:59] HEADS. LOOK UP. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD FOR
[1:15:01] YOUR redemption drawth nigh."
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] See the Bible says, "Thou hast kept the
[1:15:07] word of thy because thou has kept the
[1:15:08] word of thy patience, I also will keep
[1:15:11] thee from the hour of temptation,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; which shall come upon all the world to
[1:15:14] try them that dwell upon the earth."
[1:15:16] Brother said, "This temptation is
[1:15:18] exactly like the temptation in Eden."
[1:15:20] Exactly.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me for just about five
[1:15:24] minutes, but before we close,
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; this temptation is exactly like the
[1:15:28] temptation in Eden. What was the
[1:15:30] temptation in Eden? Surely,
[1:15:33] surely God doesn't care. Surely you
[1:15:35] won't die
[1:15:37] if you cross the word.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Exactly like that.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; It'll be a very inviting proposition
[1:15:44] held up in direct opposition to God's
[1:15:46] commanded word. And yet from the
[1:15:48] standpoint of human reasoning, oh
[1:15:51] church,
[1:15:53] young people, do you realize that if you
[1:15:55] reason with the word of God, that
[1:15:57] reasoning will seem to be right?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll seem like, WELL, IT JUST
[1:16:02] MAKES SENSE. Brother Brandon was just
[1:16:03] oldfashioned.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; The message is just oldfashioned. He
[1:16:07] just lived in another. It just makes
[1:16:09] sense for us to be different than he
[1:16:10] was. And and and to have a different
[1:16:12] opinion about this or a different
[1:16:13] opinion about that or or our pastor may
[1:16:15] he's just an old fogy. But we got to
[1:16:17] this we better be careful how we reason
[1:16:19] with the word
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; because he said it'll from the
[1:16:22] standpoint of human reasoning, IT'LL BE
[1:16:24] SO VERY RIGHT.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH. IT WILL MAKE SENSE.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; So enlightening and lifegiving as to
[1:16:30] fool the world.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; That's why you got so-called message
[1:16:34] churches that cut their hair and wear
[1:16:35] pants.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; One right now that I know of, the people
[1:16:39] they say, "Well, there's nothing wrong
[1:16:40] with earrings." Just Brother Brandham's
[1:16:41] opinion. So the women are wearing
[1:16:43] earrings,
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; cutting their hair.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; So-called message church.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The pastor won't read quotes in the
[1:16:52] pulpit because it might offend somebody.
[1:16:55] Oh church, the temptation, the hour of
[1:16:59] temptation.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to look for some uh you
[1:17:03] know, economic hardship to come. It may
[1:17:07] come. I don't doubt that it will. But
[1:17:10] I'll say this, right now is the hardest
[1:17:11] time that's ever been because it's the
[1:17:13] most deceptive time.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; If the economy crashed, we wouldn't have
[1:17:19] no trouble keeping people in church.
[1:17:24] The biggest reason why people don't come
[1:17:26] to church more I didn't mean it's
[1:17:28] Wednesday night. I'm not I'm not
[1:17:29] scolding you. But you know why the
[1:17:31] biggest reason why people don't come to
[1:17:32] church is they have too much money.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about those that are
[1:17:37] sick or whatever, but it's the truth.
[1:17:39] How do you know that? Well, because I've
[1:17:40] been to Africa. I've been to the
[1:17:41] Philippines and been places where they
[1:17:44] didn't have any money and they go to
[1:17:46] church all the time because they got
[1:17:48] nothing better to do. I'm that way too,
[1:17:50] right? I'm including myself in that. We
[1:17:52] live in Leodosia. We got to live here.
[1:17:54] There's nothing wrong with with living
[1:17:56] and and enjoying your money if you have
[1:17:57] it, but make sure you do the necessary
[1:18:00] things.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Because this is the hour of temptation.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; You y'all forgive me tonight. I don't
[1:18:08] mean to to scold you.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I always hate a preacher that preaches
[1:18:13] on church attendance on Wednesday night.
[1:18:18] [snorts]
[1:18:20] To believe the devil's lie, Brother
[1:18:21] Brhamstead said, is to serve Satan.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Even though you may want to call him
[1:18:28] Jehovah, but the elect will not be
[1:18:30] deceived.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. It's a terrible
[1:18:34] age. It's a deceptive age. BUT THE ELECT
[1:18:36] WILL NOT BE DECEIVED. Brother Brandon
[1:18:38] said, "I'd be a very a very discouraged
[1:18:40] man if it wasn't for predestination."
[1:18:42] Yeah.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Furthermore, the elect will
[1:18:45] not only be kept, but as this move
[1:18:48] becomes the image erected to the beast,
[1:18:50] the saints will be gone
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; in the rapture."
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of temptation. 200
[1:18:56] million demons trying to say the message
[1:18:58] doesn't matter.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you say that, brother Ben?
[1:19:02] Well, it's because of this quote in the
[1:19:03] feast of the trumpets. Brother Brandham
[1:19:04] said, "Now she's loosed."
[1:19:06] talking about those 200 million demons
[1:19:08] that are loosed to call all these little
[1:19:11] loose ends.
[1:19:14] Oh well, don't make any difference
[1:19:15] anyhow.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The loose ends. Remember what that was?
[1:19:18] If you go to Revelation 10:7 said in the
[1:19:21] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; is everybody awake?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; I'm closing. The days of the voice of
[1:19:27] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[1:19:28] to sound, all the mysteries of God will
[1:19:29] be finished.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; That word finished means all the loose
[1:19:32] ends will be tied up.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:36] all the loose ends will be tied up.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; She's loosed.
[1:19:42] You realize what that is? 200 million
[1:19:44] demons is more than one per person for
[1:19:45] message people.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. They're
[1:19:52] loosed. Brother Bren said they're not
[1:19:54] loose on the church,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; not loosed on the world. They're loose
[1:19:57] on the bride.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Right? to call all those little loose
[1:20:01] ends. Oh well, don't make any
[1:20:02] difference.
[1:20:07] Don't make any difference. We better
[1:20:08] watch before we say that.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You realize you're fighting a spiritual
[1:20:12] battle.
[1:20:14] Our children are fighting a spiritual
[1:20:16] battle. Our teens are fighting a
[1:20:17] spiritual battle. Our married couples
[1:20:18] are fighting a spiritual battle. Our
[1:20:21] older saints are fighting a spiritual
[1:20:22] battle.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I I I see this a lot, especially with
[1:20:25] our young people. And it seems like that
[1:20:28] we're trying to fight spiritual battles
[1:20:29] in a natural way.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And we're just trying to we're just
[1:20:34] trying to bluff our way through it or or
[1:20:35] or say, "Well, I got this spirit of
[1:20:38] discouragement on me." Well, it's
[1:20:39] probably one of them demons.
[1:20:41] my wife, bless her heart, um, sorry,
[1:20:44] Britney,
[1:20:47] we were uh we were in the house today, I
[1:20:49] think, and the dogs got to fussing over
[1:20:52] food and and our little dog, he just
[1:20:54] comes after the bigger dog, and then the
[1:20:55] bigger dog could kill him, you know, so
[1:20:57] we had to pull him apart. But little dog
[1:20:59] can't do nothing, but he comes after the
[1:21:01] big dog and and because he don't know
[1:21:02] he's little and he he come after him and
[1:21:04] Britney drags that dog away and she
[1:21:06] spanks him real good, the little dog.
[1:21:08] And she says, she says, "You stop that."
[1:21:10] She said, "That's a demon."
[1:21:14] It may have been. I guess there were
[1:21:16] demons in the pigs.
[1:21:20] But I wonder how many times devils,
[1:21:24] you know, sit on our shoulder, tell us
[1:21:26] we're not good enough, we're not going
[1:21:27] to make it.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Tell you young people to take your own
[1:21:29] lives.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; You've been driving drive driving down
[1:21:34] the road one day and you you say, "How
[1:21:36] do you know this, Brother Ben?" I've
[1:21:37] dealt with that.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Drive down the road and you say, "I
[1:21:40] might as well just drive off. Nobody
[1:21:41] cares anyway." It's one of them devils.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Get to a place where you think, "Well, I
[1:21:49] might as well not go to church. Nobody
[1:21:50] cares if I go to church. Doesn't
[1:21:52] matter."
[1:21:54] You're going to fight that battle.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; How How do you fight it? How do you
[1:21:58] fight that? You're You're not as strong
[1:22:00] as the enemy,
[1:22:02] but with him, you you're more than
[1:22:03] enough.
[1:22:06] But see, Ephesians 6 tells us how to
[1:22:08] fight it. Finally, my brethren, be
[1:22:10] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:22:11] his might. Put on the whole armor of God
[1:22:14] that you may be able to stand against
[1:22:16] the ws. That's the deception.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Word ws is deception, the ws of the
[1:22:21] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:22:23] and blood, but against principalities,
[1:22:26] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:22:27] the darkness of this world, against
[1:22:29] spiritual wickedness in high places. We
[1:22:30] we get to going through stuff and we
[1:22:32] want to blame somebody for it. But it
[1:22:34] may not be the pastor's fault. It may
[1:22:35] not be the church's FAULT. IT MAY NOT BE
[1:22:37] OUR husband or our wife's fault. It may
[1:22:39] just be spiritual wickedness in high
[1:22:42] places.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, how do we combat that? BUT
[1:22:46] BEN, TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE ARMOR of
[1:22:48] God that you may be able to withstand in
[1:22:50] the evil day. and having done all to
[1:22:52] stand. He goes on to say, "Stand
[1:22:54] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:22:56] with truth and having having that shield
[1:22:58] of faith and the sword of the spirit,
[1:22:59] which is the word OF GOD." WHEN'S THE
[1:23:01] LAST TIME YOU PICKED UP THE SWORD of the
[1:23:03] spirit and fought A BATTLE WITH IT?
[1:23:04] WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HELD UP THAT
[1:23:06] FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD AND SAID, "I
[1:23:07] WILL NOT BE MOVED. I AM GOING TO MAKE
[1:23:09] IT. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. I'M MORE THAN
[1:23:12] ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT OUT OF THIS
[1:23:13] senior age." Yes, sir.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT THAT BATTLE. THIS
[1:23:17] IS THE HOUR of temptation.
[1:23:21] He said he'll keep us. He'll keep us in
[1:23:23] the hour of [snorts] temptation and he
[1:23:25] will keep us from the tribulation.
[1:23:28] What is your shield? Faith in the word.
[1:23:30] Read your Bible and pray.
[1:23:33] Those instructions come to us.
[1:23:36] If there ever been an age when we needed
[1:23:37] to run to him,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; it's this day.
[1:23:43] Young people, run to him.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Run to him.
[1:23:47] Don't be afraid to confess your faults
[1:23:50] one to another and pray one for another.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Run to him. Run to the house of God.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He's our shelter. He's our peace. Run.
[1:23:59] Run to the word of God. Our elders, run
[1:24:02] to the word of God. The doctor can have
[1:24:04] their say, but run to the word of God.
[1:24:06] It says, "I'm the Lord thy God that
[1:24:07] heals all thy diseases."
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Run to the word of God. Run to the word
[1:24:13] of God. says, "Call for the elders of
[1:24:14] the church and a prayer of faith shall
[1:24:16] save the sick."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Run to the word of God.
[1:24:22] What's your shield? Faith in the word,
[1:24:25] read your Bible and pray. Musicians, go
[1:24:27] ahead and come.
[1:24:30] Listen to the message. There was an hour
[1:24:31] to know what's coming. You want to know
[1:24:33] what's coming? You look at the papers,
[1:24:36] see this stuff coming? I just read to
[1:24:37] you.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon told us it would come.
[1:24:41] And here we see it directly happening
[1:24:43] just like he said it would happen. Them
[1:24:46] trying to bring their doctrine down to
[1:24:48] match Protestant doctrine. Standing
[1:24:51] there at the council of Nika and they
[1:24:52] recited the Nyian creed together which
[1:24:56] states the doctrine of the trinity
[1:24:58] together the Greek church the eastern
[1:25:00] church and the western church coming
[1:25:01] together for the first time in history.
[1:25:04] It just happened this week.
[1:25:08] Where we at church?
[1:25:10] It's time to pick up that sword, pick up
[1:25:12] that shield. It's time for family to
[1:25:14] start praying together again.
[1:25:16] It's time for people to start searching
[1:25:18] their hearts. And I want to be right. I
[1:25:22] I don't want to be left out. I don't
[1:25:24] want to be in that denominational group.
[1:25:25] I want to be right.
[1:25:27] We want to love everybody. But we cannot
[1:25:29] afford to give up on the word we've been
[1:25:32] given. Cannot afford to change what the
[1:25:35] prophet said. I don't care who says it.
[1:25:38] We can't afford to change what a prophet
[1:25:40] taught us this hour because it's exactly
[1:25:42] the truth. We're predestined, brother
[1:25:44] Bram said, to this great glorious stand.
[1:25:46] He said, "There will be a bride that
[1:25:48] will not fall." Well, I believe I'm a
[1:25:50] member of that bride, brother Stewart.
[1:25:51] That's why there's something in me,
[1:25:52] SOMETHING IN YOU THAT HUNGERS for the
[1:25:54] word of God. WE WANT TO KNOW these
[1:25:55] things. We want to HEAR IT. WE WE want
[1:25:57] to be told where we're at and and what
[1:25:59] to do about it. WE WE WE HUNGER FOR THE
[1:26:01] WORD BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE.
[1:26:04] Oh my. Oh, I pray there's a hunger
[1:26:07] inside of you. Maybe the world has
[1:26:09] dealed that with every head b every head
[1:26:11] bowed and every eyes eye closed. Maybe
[1:26:14] the world has dulled that hunger
[1:26:18] for the word. But I believe it's still
[1:26:21] there. I I believe if you just take a
[1:26:23] moment and talk to him, he'll he'll talk
[1:26:26] to you and he'll say, "You're my child
[1:26:28] and
[1:26:31] it's time to get right. It's time to
[1:26:33] stop playing church. I don't know how
[1:26:35] this turned into an evangelistic
[1:26:37] thought, but I believe it's time.
[1:26:42] Run to him.
[1:26:44] Just strikes in my heart tonight. Lord,
[1:26:46] help me. Help me, Lord. Run to you,
[1:26:51] Lord. Father, there's still time,
[1:26:55] heavenly father.
[1:26:57] Lord, as we're thinking on these things
[1:26:59] and Lord, as we let the word soak in now
[1:27:02] and we begin to water it with our
[1:27:03] praise, I I pray, God, that you'd help
[1:27:06] us to run, Lord, the race with patience
[1:27:09] that you'd set before us, help us to
[1:27:10] hold up that shield of faith, Lord, to
[1:27:13] fight spiritual battles with spiritual
[1:27:15] things, comparing scriptural things with
[1:27:17] scriptural. I pray you'd help us, Lord,
[1:27:20] not to reason in our own minds, but to
[1:27:22] believe the word of God, to accept it
[1:27:24] for our lives. Lord, whatever you have
[1:27:26] for us, I pray that we would be that way
[1:27:28] and do that. And Lord, we don't want to
[1:27:30] be so odd just to be odd. But Lord, if
[1:27:33] the word makes us odd, Lord, we'll be
[1:27:35] we'll be an oddball to the world. We'll
[1:27:38] be different. I pray you'd grant it,
[1:27:40] Lord. Pray you'd keep us balanced. Keep
[1:27:43] us on the straight and narrow. Keep us
[1:27:46] ready planting our potatoes, building
[1:27:48] our church, doing the things we need to
[1:27:50] do, Lord.
[1:27:52] But we believe your coming is very
[1:27:53] close. I pray you'd grant us it today.
[1:27:56] We thank you for all that you've done. I
[1:27:58] pray the word would just sink down into
[1:28:00] every heart,
[1:28:02] Lord, that there'd be such a hunger for
[1:28:04] your word that we wouldn't have to
[1:28:07] wouldn't have to call people together.
[1:28:08] They just want to come together and
[1:28:10] fellowship around it and talk about it
[1:28:12] and call one another on the phones. It
[1:28:14] wasn't what in the word wonderful and
[1:28:16] what I just read, what I just heard. And
[1:28:18] I pray it be so, Lord. Let it be in our
[1:28:20] hearts, oh God. is the Bible says that
[1:28:23] the word of Christ dwell in you richly
[1:28:25] and all wisdom singing psalms, hymns,
[1:28:28] and spiritual songs may be so Lord. May
[1:28:30] it be the song of our heart, the song on
[1:28:32] our lips. I pray you'd grant it now. We
[1:28:34] thank you, Lord, as we worship you,
[1:28:36] Lord. If there's anything in us that's
[1:28:38] not right, cleanse us, oh God. Cleanse
[1:28:40] me. Forgive me, Lord. Help me, oh God. I
[1:28:43] humble myself today and Lord, forgive me
[1:28:45] if I've done anything that's wrong. I
[1:28:47] pray, Lord, that there'd be a mighty
[1:28:49] outpouring of your spirit. or maybe
[1:28:51] there'd be something that I should have
[1:28:53] done, I didn't do. I pray you'd forgive
[1:28:55] me, Lord, and show me. I'll do it. Pray
[1:28:57] you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you for
[1:29:00] your word. Thank you for the conviction
[1:29:01] that I feel here in this place. For your
[1:29:03] spirit that we feel. I pray that it
[1:29:05] would never leave us, Lord. May we never
[1:29:07] go back to dead, dry, cold, formal
[1:29:09] churches. That's what Na came and
[1:29:11] brought. Lord, may we have this presence
[1:29:13] of God right here with us. I pray you'd
[1:29:15] grant it. We thank you for it. In Jesus'
[1:29:18] name we ask. Amen. Thank you, Lord
[1:29:22] Jesus.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't we just stand and
[1:29:25] worship him tonight? I believe he's
[1:29:27] here.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just lift it up to
[1:29:30] him. You're welcome to come to the altar
[1:29:32] and pray. Glad to pray with you.
