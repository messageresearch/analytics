I didn't pray about it I was just like let's just go home you know and about the next four quotes was on headaches and migraines and then uh the prayer line brother Branham deals I think two ladies with headaches and you know and then Jen's headache immediately left her and so you know you come so close to the finish line and a lot of times you want to give up and just walk away and and then God step saying amen so I believe tonight he can he can do the same thing for us tonight so let's just let's just enter in put everything else aside and you know maybe it's not your healing but but maybe

amen just looking forward to what God has in store for us you have a need this evening and I believe God's more than able to meet that need amen will let brother Joel come he'll lead this and just turn it over to brother Ben thank you there's nothing like a presence nothing like the presence nothing like the presence of the Lord oh there's nothing like the presence nothing like the presence there's nothing like the presence of the Lord well I am free zes I am here in his presence oh I'm forgiven and I'm not the same well I'm changed forever can we stand and sing it with all our hearts

Heavenly Father we believe that we are changed in your presence Lord you taught us through your Prophet that we don't leave the same way that we came in Lord and we're going to claim the positive side of that tonight and believe that we'll leave with our healing with our Lord whatever we have need of whatever problem that existed when we came in these doors or that it'll all be solved by the time that we leave or will understand more about you we'll love you that much more Lord I prayed granted tonight Lord I pray for those that are sick not able to be here I just ask you to go down where they're at may this same presence oh feel here tonight go into their room Lord and healed him and change them oh God we thank you for all that you've done thank you for visiting us already tonight Lord we pray that you move me out of the way and speak through your word pray and we ask it in Jesus name [Music] let's love the presence of the Lord just helps you to put aside all the all the worry of the weak and all the things that have gone on and just just basking his presence so wonderful that he meets us on a Wednesday night First Corinthians chapter 12 and verses 28-31 First Corinthians 12 28-31 I'm going to skip ahead a little bit and then we'll go back to tongues and interpretation next week the Lord willing tonight I want to talk about helps and governments helps and governments gifts that are in the body maybe not the same type of gift as tongues and prophecy and those things but it's still a gift that's in the body we'll talk about it tonight First Corinthians 12 28 God has set some in the church first apostles and when Paul says first secondarily third least talking about the order of importance to the body now that's the order of the importance of the gift not the order of importance of the person and we need to make sure that we don't judge ourselves or value ourselves by our gifts because a person could have a gift from God and go to hell with it and have a great gift but we're not valued by our gift we don't want to do that because God could use you one time and never use you again and then you'd always try to be used in that way and and your time is over but but I say God ever use me today let me be a benefit to the body of Christ today in any way that I can so so he says first Apostle secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing to all speak with tongues to all interpret it he said but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated good to have brother Jonah Malachi with us tonight God bless you guys thank you for coming out Joel's pro-growth he told me in the church so if you do it one way or another so that's uh that's how you do it right there and get all them kids grown up and lined up while you're on the front and we'll have a good church full isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen I trust you just I just feel relaxed tonight and I believe the Lord is going to help us not a wonderful testimony last Wednesday but Al and I I last week I don't ever do this I'm always ready on Tuesday but last week on Wednesday I changed the middle part of that sermon and added in all that about headaches and I thought what in the world am I doing I questioned myself about that but it was just the Lord and thank the Lord for that and God can speak to the word is a discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart amen we believe that tonight so I trust this will be a blessing to you tonight in some way Paul is list these two gifts helps and governments and they're not mentioned in verses 8 through 10 which is where we've been reading from in the nine spiritual gifts but they are mentioned before tongues and interpretation in uh in in this part and I think most people in a local church identify with one of these gifts helps and governments I think this is probably something that we could all have in on in some level or in some way uh working in our lives if you're a Christian now Paul's idea of the church is very different from a modern Church a modern church is pretty much I don't want to be too critical tonight but it's become a stage show where you go and and everybody watches people or uh has become a production I don't think that Christianity ought to be a production it's a it's a body it's not a business it's a body I told you the story before about a a man that was taking some ministerial students through a church and that janitor was there cleaning up and and he asked him he said did you have a good service this morning he said yeah he said we processed a thousand units and it kind of took him back he said what in the world is he talking about well they had a thousand people come to the doors and to the church staff they'd become units that become their their trade was in people and that's how they made their money and made their living but that's not what we do this is uh this is a a service this is a this is a body we are a body and you know it's different than a business you know cutting a cancer out of a person's body is much more delicate than uh cutting dead weight in a business firing somebody because whenever you remove a part of the body that part dies you realize that you cannot live apart from the body right so whenever you you remove apart from the body then that part dies and and you realize the body then is affected in some way even cancer if you cut out a cancer it leaves a scar tissue surgery even the best surgery and the most well done it done with care it leaves Scar Tissue it leaves a a trauma in the body and so you always you know if you went to the doctor Brother David and you say well there's something wrong with my head he said well let's just cut it off you say well I believe I'll find a different doctor a doctor I got I got my hands hurt I want you to patch it up well we'll just cut it off that's not how you deal with a body because the body part is Irreplaceable on some level it's it's it's Irreplaceable and you are irreplaceable tonight in the body of Christ but you don't get to choose which part of that body you are do you ever think about that your hand didn't wake up one day and realize hey and think and say well I'm a hand I'm going to be a hand go be a hand and you can't do that your foot didn't decide one day well I'm a foot I'm gonna go be a foot I'll be a I think I'll be a good foot no it was made to be afoot it was created with the proper ability to do that and that's the way the body is so if we go back to verse 12 in First Corinthians 12 12 Paul talks about the body he said for as the body is one someone say one the body is one it's not many bodies it's one body yeah he said and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we'd be Bond or free we have been all made to drink into one Spirit aren't you glad of that tonight so so he's he's emphasizing this we're one but we're different right so First Corinthians 12 14 for the body is not one member but many he talks about the different parts there and then in verse 18 He said but now has God set to members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him as it has pleased him so he made the eye and I he made the ear and ear and he made it with certain characteristics to be able to do the job that it was made for you would think it was kind of odd if your thumb decided to be the eye and it was and God didn't make a thumb with the ability to see right and your eye can't decide to be your thumb they cannot take each other's place they belong where they're at hey man we need to we need to recognize that God gifted us and many times you look at your natural many times we undervalue we're looking for great spiritual things and we undervalue the way God made us he made us to be a help to one another he made us to be an encouragement to one another he made us to and we're looking for some great spiritual thing to do and maybe the thing we ought to be doing is right beside us or stop doing right because sometimes that helps the body see him he made the ionai made the ear and ear and Paul says if they were all one member where were the body they were all the same there's no body he said but now are they many members but one body and then I cannot say it to the hand I have no need of thee nor again to the head to the feet I have no need of you name much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble or more are necessary I think of our elderly people and and some of the folks that are not able to be here maybe on a Wednesday night but they they're here with us in spirit or maybe they're trying attempting to watch on the on the internet and and for them those members of the body which you maybe you don't think about them all the time but they're necessary they're necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant comeliness he said you said you say brother Brandon I'm the least in the church I'm just a little bitty fellow how many ever felt like that he said but remember when he ascended on high you raised with him you're in the body he said and you're with Christ right now how many believe that tonight seated in Heavenly places if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you oh if we could ever get a realization of that tonight if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet you may not do anything in the church you may not have any role visible role in the church but you're part of the body so you're a conqueror you're an overcomer with every other part of the body so your gift is just your place in the body if we could say it that way if you have an eye gift he's not going to place you on the bottom of the foot be hard for you to see and so we want to keep that in mind as we go along now helps the word helps the Greek word antolinsis refers to assisting people in need but it also gives the idea of calling upon God in a time of turmoil so that he can act in the situation with his full power and force so it's the idea of someone who assists jumps in and helps with whatever needs done especially someone who assists in prayer and brother Branham says it's about that he said remember your prayers for me he said that means you're my colleague you're my buddy you're my helper you may never traveled with him or done anything like that but but he said when you prayed for me you're my colleague you're my buddy you're my helper and together we are helpers in the Lord and we find in the scripture a great example of that as Aaron and hers they were as they were standing there with with Moses and Moses realized during the battle as they were fighting that as long as he kept his hands raised that the battle would go for Israel and when he put his hands down then the battle would go the other way and it shows us The Importance of Being in our position but Moses it's the visible part of that and he's the one with the office that has to keep his hands raised so he could say it like this in a local church the pastor has to be in his position right keep his hands raised and got to preach and and there's things that the pastor has to do he's got to be a part of the body and it's a very public position but for Aaron and her had to be there as well and there's nothing in the scripture that said Moses asked them but they must have noticed that the battle was going better when he had his hands up so what do they do they go get a rock and put it under it let him sit on it and then one got on one side and one God on the other and held his hands up says Moses hands were heavy and our hands get heavy sometimes sometimes the pastor's hands get heavy sometimes the Deacon's hands get heavy sometimes the singers the musicians their hands get heavy and it's our job to get up beside them and lift them up one on one side and the other on the other side his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun they just stepped in and did what needed to be done that helps right they say for every one soldier that saw combat in Iraq or Afghanistan there were eight soldiers behind the scenes never saw battle but holding their hands up without them many many more men would have been lost an Army's strength is determined not just by how many soldiers it can put in combat but how many people it has to put behind them to supply them to help them to supply Logistics to supply information and the army of God is the same way listen we're in an army we're fighting the battle and I'll be honest with you I want the general to be the very best city can be I want the soldiers to be the very best they can be I don't you know I've always thought especially in an ancient battle when you fought in lines I wouldn't want to be one of the first ones well Danny I I don't want to be I have no desire to be on the front lines in a Civil War battle or a revolutionary war Battle them guys are nuts volunteer for the front lines right you want to be one of the guys in the back because the worms the front lines gonna get shot up but somebody's got to do it there's got to be somebody with that kind of personality that kind of gift that kind of ability but it also takes somebody behind them to push them forward and they say I'm kind of getting ahead of myself but they say that the uh the Greeks the soldiers for the Greeks they would uh go into Phalanx I think is what it's called to maybe mispronouncing that but they would actually and I've talked about it before they would actually held a a shield in their left hand and a spear in their right hand and the The Shield would cover half of their body and half of their neighbors and they would actually put them they would put like a brother beside a brother people from the same town they'd put them together because they wanted them to fight for each other and so there was a saying among the the mothers when they would send the Spartan soldiers out to war and they would they would say they would say come back either with your Shield or on it with your Shield or on it because if you come back alive without your Shield it means somebody else died yeah because you weren't in your position right right oh God if we could just understand that today let me be in my position come back with my shield or on it I might die in battle but I died fighting for the my brother fighting for the Lord I might get hurt but I've died doing what I was supposed to be doing yeah and we're in a battle we want everybody in a battle to know what they're doing and be the very best at what they do Brother Bear I'm talking about brother Neville he said he certainly goes under a lot of Labor and strains and things you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as he's bringing the word he said brother Bennett do we not hold you up enough I say that you do you I'm not talking about myself but just in general I'll say this standing here behind the pulpit is a is a fearful thing and what we need to hold one another up many times it's just responding to the word I appreciate some of you I know when you're missing because because that response isn't there I'm so glad you respond to the word saying amen is helping and some people have a gift for that some of y'all have a gift for it don't use it very much the most underutilized gift in the churches so the gift of saying amen but it is a gift to respond to the word God gives you the ability to do that and you know you can sit there and never respond and it would help you but it doesn't help me none right doesn't help the whatever preacher is up here brother Andrew brother Joel or brother or brother Alan brother Stewart or any of the brothers it doesn't help them at all to be standing behind the pulpit and and you sit there with your arms folded yet you would receive but I'll say this some of you even by your faces you let me know you're on the right Trail and and let me know that and I appreciate that but but saying amen every once in a while I wouldn't hurt and brother Brandon talked about that he said I was preaching here not long ago and this little woman just screaming and shouting on top of her voice he said there was a man that's a son he's going to teach her in a Baptist Church in Jeffersonville he said Billy I was enjoying your service till that woman got to screaming and crying he said how in the world can you preach when people are hollering like that I said I can't preach unless they do holler like that he said I don't know where I'm standing don't know how they're receiving it right so at least not right so I know how you're receiving it or maybe smile he said I used to have an old dog I used to hunt with he said we call him Fritz he would take anything tree anything in the world but a skunk he just wouldn't go into him he'd dream in a brush pile and he'd keep going around and around the brush pile barking he said the only thing I had to do to get him to go in and get that skunk would just raise up the brush pile and Pat him and say sick him boy sick him boy he'd go in and get the skunk you know sometimes we just need some sympathy amens and some of y'all are sympathy a manners I won't call your names but when I get in trouble up here you you start backing me I appreciate that a sicken boy go get him amen he said brother he said every time I hear amen it's sicken boy and the biggest skunk I know of is the devil let's get him up a bush right now go get it that's right seek Him boy good you realize if we come with such faith I was I'm marveled at how watching just a clip of the video raised everyone's Faith last Sunday night or last Wednesday night rather I just marveled at that I thought what if we come in with that kind of a faith into every service believing that God could do anything believing that the power of God was still alive today I believe we can do that because he is the same yesterday today and forever he is still the same God he's the same Jehovah Jireh and you can take a preacher it's not much of a preacher and I know this by experience you can take a preacher that can't hardly preach his way out of a wet paper bag but you take a a church that's on fire and filled up with faith and watch that preacher start to preach makes a difference sometimes just helping someone we're fixing to have meetings you realize sometimes some of you people I know in a church this size if you have meetings and there's twice as many people here as what goes to church here and then you start thinking well all I'm going to do is work and then I know that's true for some of us especially you ladies you're you're working and we try to take as much off of you as we can by buying food and things but but you're working you're helping your cleaning and then those that assist the deacons the deacons themselves and and and those of us who get uh motels for people and and houses for people and our meetings are coming up there's going to be a lot to do and we're going to talk about that that's where we really need a gift of helps it's in times like that but you know we're not just doing that for us although it is for us primarily but we're doing it it's a love gift to our our community and and to the people around us maybe not everybody can have a meeting like that we have the facilities to do that then we should do that we should do what we're able because we're only here for so long we only have so many times we're able to gather together like that let's give it all that we've got and try to be here and do what we can but I got thinking about this some of you helped in the prayer line last year and and maybe we'll have one this year if the Lord allows us to but helping the prayer line sometimes could cause you to be healed do you know that but Perry green told the story of how he was helping in a prayer line as a 16 year old boy and Billy Paul become friends with Billy Paul and Billy Paul lady helping the prayer line and so he because of that he got a prayer card and brother Branham hey it wasn't really that sick but he had a bowel trouble and brother Branham before he even got up to the front he called him out and and he told him what was wrong with him and everything and he was healed from that time on and told him he was called to preach so he benefited just by being involved and there's another case brother Brown says that he was talking to someone who didn't speak English which like we talked about last Wednesday night if you want to prove the prophet wasn't reading people's prayer cards here's a person who didn't have a prayer card and didn't speak English so they weren't telling him what was wrong with them they weren't writing it down yeah and brother Brown discerned that and had someone help him and do that and then he says this he said that man that was trying to help that other man there sir you did God a favor you helped I want to be somebody who helps he said you helped you was trying he said yes trying to tell you he said you don't have to come stand right there he said you speak English he said you have a prayer card he said you don't have it all right if you'll believe with all your heart that hernia will leave you you can go home and be well he was a helper yeah just wanted to be a help oh my we're brothers fighting in a battle I'll say uh when we go into battle when we go into a meeting when we have church just on a regular basis when there's sickness in the church when there's trouble when things are stirred up and I just read this week or brother random said if you if you run away from the church and say well I'll just stay away for a while when there's trouble he said I question your experience but but then now we live in a time when there's always going to be something going on but we're fighting a battle it's a spiritual warfare I say come back with your Shield or come back on it give it all you've got that helps there's also governments governments is the word first the Greek word is the word for steering or piloting governing it's anybody in charge of anything in the church and there's more of those than what you think somebody's in charge of making sure the floor gets swept all right somebody's in charge of making sure the diapers and get out of the nursery somebody's in charge of playing the piano somebody's in charge of playing the instrument somebody is in charge of Sunday School right and a lot of times that gets unheralded it's not just the pastor it's a pastor trying to do everything believe me I've done it and some of the folks from Brownsville will remember and I'm sure they'll get a chuckle out of this but I there's been times I led singing and preached and there's times brother JT did everything but what I was doing and and we know what that's like we've been there and you you didn't have I didn't have any Deacons and and we we had one or two trustees and three trustees and that's what we had and and we just tried to work through that I think God we've got Administration we got people to help so you do with what you have to do with when you don't have it but I think God that we do have it now audio and video worker she said well that's not a Ministry what about to the people that aren't here tonight it's Administration and it don't always work sometimes our it's another internet doesn't work but we try to do our best to back it up and try to make sure that we get at least a copy because it could be something that would help somebody not because I'm important or I've got something to say but we believe God as a church God honors us when we come together and speaks to us no matter who's in the pulpit and I don't have time tonight to go through every duty of every office that's not my purpose but but I want to address this question tonight because I think it'll help you because we're a growing church and and and and things that are changing and have changed over time and things necessarily change just because people get older now right brother Danny you just over time you just can't do what you used to do and some of y'all know that and and so you change you get more wisdom and and so we we value our elders in that way but but how do I know what office I should be in and that's really important for those of you that are younger because it may be years but you need to think about these things ahead of time and and you need to prepare yourself keep your life right so that you could do something in the church if the time came because it's not just all about well I'm predestinated that's I believe you are I believe you'll make it you're going to make it but you want to be a benefit to somebody I mean and most of you are because we're still small enough that it takes most of us just to make it right especially on a Wednesday night but Paul said covet the best gifts and I think when he says the best gift he's saying that the most beneficial to the body the gifts most beneficial to the body yet again you can't choose where you go in the body and I would say the first thing that you need to ask yourself if you want to know what office you should be in is this okay tonight what needs to be done there's first thing I mean we only need so many preachers in a service right we only need so many song leaders only need so many but are people not getting seated maybe the church needs an usher does the carpet need clean maybe the church needs a janitor other bunch of kids running around there's probably plenty of opportunities there for people to help brother Brandon makes a statement he said it used to be when I was here he said he said I was the pastor I was the song leader boy I know what he feels like every preacher ought to go through this at some point in their life by the way he said I was the pastor I was the song leader I took up the offerings I paid the debts I Was the janitor I was the carpenter I never was that one although I did remodel our uh I forgot about that I did remodel our foyer one time it was very small and the work was done very badly but I got I did it myself so I'm warning you I think it's going done I I can't lay carpet and he said I Was the janitor I was the carpenter I just cleaned the ashes out of the stove and done whatever come along to be done he said then worked at the Public Service Company on the side 17 years of that we think of you know and this I'll encourage those of you who are waiting on your ministry or waiting on you know you think well all this time I've struggled and and I'm not getting out I'm not getting the preacher I'm not getting the recognition even in the local church that I should get but brother Branham labor for 17 years with that gift in a church where he had to do everything and he said I don't encourage us our breakthrough is coming be patient look he said when I pastored here I had to be a pastor Deacon trustee everything else at once see he said but I had to do it he said now you don't have to do it that way because you got men to carry this out I think that's where we're at now you know so what needs to be done I think the second thing you want to ask yourself is what can you do and then be honest with yourself about that because we're not real good judges about what we can do well ourselves but you know how you find out and ask somebody right so as the church grows it becomes more even more than what can I do what can I do well because there's people who can do things but what can I do well so the Bible says we have gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us our gifts differ even even preachers differ among themselves some pastors have more of a gift than other pastors and it don't make the other Pastor not called of God right some some preachers have more of a gift than other preachers some preachers are better evangelists than others I can go out and preach a meeting but I'm not the Evangelist Andrew Glover is I can I can slip into that role but I can't do what he does or brother Daryl Ward or somebody like that but the jewel Forney as he used to go and do that those men were real are real evangelists and I can't feel those shoes so our gifts differ but even among evangelist gifts differ and so he said according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith so there's a certain amount of faith that you have to be able to prophesy and and you have to learn that you have to learn what your limits are learn what your boundaries are and you know not all the puzzle pieces are the same you may be an edge piece but you might be a middle piece but if you're an edge piece don't try to force yourself into the middle of the picture but if you're a middle piece don't try to force yourself to the edge right you belong in the middle and but God needs all of them there is nothing more disappointing than buying a puzzle and getting it done and there's a piece missing huh and it's the same way with the church we need each other don't we I need your Shield you need my shield Hallelujah so it becomes oh what can I do well now the brand talked about this he said to little brother here he said the song leader brother Cobble many others here God has given you Talent maybe you say well brother Brown he hasn't given me nothing I know sometimes we feel that way he said you don't know maybe see you may just go try something maybe you've never went out and testified to somebody try that yes he said everybody can't do that maybe you can't he said something else that you could do there's something you can do that you can put it to God you know there's some people maybe could never have the courage to go witness like maybe somebody else could but they can make money and and they pay their tithes and their offerings maybe God allowed you to have that gift for a reason all right but if you can testify maybe you should try that there's something you can do you can put it to God he said well now the thing you have to do is do what the brother's singing his song yield he said I love this he said the man who could whistle and impersonate all the birds that I ever heard he said well then that man yielded himself to it now there's a strange gift but brother Branham attributed that to God now I don't necessarily think that gift would need to be up in front all the time because there's only so much edification you can get from somebody being able to whistle like a bird right but it was given to the man for a reason at some point there's somebody that he could that was edified by that and so the man just yielded himself to it give it to it and so he said the man who could sing he yielded himself he give in to it he said now for these things here of the gospel and the manifestation of Visions I just yield myself and give in to it and that's what does it see it's not me it's him and it's something that you can't help the man can't help he was born to whistle like birds right and that's not hard to see and you get we get way up in the clouds about it oh I don't understand what my gift is brother Ben and I preach all this about gifts and and there's a purpose behind it and there's different purposes behind it but but when it comes to this part it's like we want to know what gift do I have and how should I be operating well it becomes evident in our life just be patient wait on your ministry and it becomes evident what you should be doing or what you shouldn't be doing so you if you're born to whistle like birds bless your heart there's got to be a place for you but I'll say this I don't have to find a place for you the gift will make room for itself somebody will appreciate that I I was edified you know some of you all like to talk and that can be you know a double-edged sword but Joel likes to talk brother Joe likes to talk but Logan likes to talk I mean to call you guys out but you know but Logan was talking to me the other night and and uh and and I got a sermon out of that I actually preached a sermon out of something he told me and y'all he may not have even recognized him I preached a sermon out of something but Logan told me and that but it just it just sparked me because God uses all kinds to do that but the Joe's done that before Joel's never done that but some of y'all are inspired so you know you're born a certain way to do a certain thing not only encourage us tonight the man that sang he said was the same way to see Visions he says just as common to me as it is to them that to do that he said you see what I mean now it's all together it's for one edification of the glory of Jesus Christ the son of God and brother Branham has asked this question he said how does one know their rightful position on the body of Christ so that's a good question how do you rightfully know he said what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play I like the way he puts that what part of Christ do I play now for instance I'd say like this brother to give you the best answer I know your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit but listen not everything that's revealed to you by what you think is the holy spirit is the Holy Spirit so now he's going to tell you how you know it was the Holy Spirit he said if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you're doing and if he blesses it then that's him yeah like someone said to me not long ago said the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach that sounds harsh don't it but you'll find a place to preach a preacher will find a Pulpit a place to preach the gift will make room for itself said he said I really think it's so he said Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and then deceive them that's just what he wants to do he says in the whole world points their finger right there because that person crashed and burned down the road he said somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation some some has a gift of Divine Healing sometimes these things like sometimes they're mistaken in those things see and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have so it's very tricky he said so always do this Brethren whenever you feel you're supposed to do a thing first find out if it's scriptural for you to do it if it's in the scripture so say a woman felt called to preach that call runs in my family more strong on the women's side than it is on the men's but that don't mean they're called to do it may feel that auction they might have ability but it's not scriptural right right so and don't mean that they don't they may be smarter than us and then more able and every not be able to preach better than us but it does it's not scriptural so it's got to be scriptural that's just an example another example would be a person who's unqualified disqualified for some reason still has a caller or or has a call but he's disqualified himself it's not scriptural he said now he said just wrote not just wrote in one place but I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it your position he said say if you'd be an evangelist Pastor teacher Prophet whatever that God might have called you to be or if you have the gift of tongues the gift of interpretation gift of any kind of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and the four spiritual offices of the church any position first see if God called he said then usually the way I watch it for myself he said this is me he said I watch the nature of that person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing see if they're professing to be able to sing like a bird or to whistle like a bird right make a bird whistle you you'd expect them to be able to do that right he said God will work with his creature the way he's made him he said if you see him real flighty and going on he said the Lord called me for such and such to be a pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty person that's why he made me solid see you ever notice how many pastors are fat sorry it's not because we don't work it's just because we're solid he said God called me to be a teacher he said watch him see how he interprets the word see he gets it all mixed up and everything he said and you can tell man's not a teacher right he said but then the thing to do your position is usually known oh this is I've we've taught on these things before but listen it's not rocket science your position is usually known whether you can do it or not brother Brown tells the story building the Tabernacle and and all of that and listen to what he says I love the humility of a prophet he said my calling was an evangelist he said laying right here at this Cornerstone if we could burst in there tonight you'll see a fly leaf off of my Bible where he told me to be an evangelist remember do the work of an evangelist he said and I wasn't a successful pastor never would be because I haven't got the patience because it takes a lot of patience he said I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a pastor therefore if I tried to Pastor I would be just be as far out as a pastor who's trying to be an evangelist he said see what I mean you can see the way the Lord calls you what your position is in the body my hand will never be my feet it wasn't meant to be my feet my eyeballs will never be on the bottom of my foot right it's just not going to be there and so over time and again I think God allows us sometimes because we're small and we're still not a big church big group but we've got to thank God for those of you step up to the plate but God allows us to see you know maybe we we pick up and do everything for a while there comes a time we don't have to do that and God allows somebody else to do that I thank God for that get out there on the front lines I want to retire one of these days you've heard a pastor say that that's my that's my thought now anyway we'll see what it is when I'm retirement age I want to retire one of these days I want to go down on that cabin on the Little Red River the last couple days we went down there for our anniversary we we I preached Sunday and I preach Wednesday but in between we went down there and and uh it's been a couple days on the river and we were in a one-room cabin I'll tell you what I could live like that go out every morning at five o'clock while the fish are biting and catch a few fish come back up go back in the evening and fish I could live the rest of my life like that not be bothered and and I'll be honest with you and I think I think I could do that anyway I want to retire some someday somebody needs to preach and get good at it somebody needs to learn how to take care of a church somebody needs to learn how you you understand so we're always training the Next Generation we need deacons we need trustees we need we need the pastors we we need piano players we we need to keep invest in the Next Generation and be patient with them because we won't always be here if the Lord tarries and if he doesn't we we've not wasted any time by investing in people's lives because it shows them that you care about them you can see what the way the Lord calls you what your position is in the body and then I would say are you still with me I'll just be a few more minutes what's your motive why do you want to do whatever and and I hope we really examine ourselves in that way why I want to and you feel that call and that's not a bad thing he said covet the best gifts but why why do I want to but the brand talks about a door of selfishness that we all have all of us have it we just have to let Christ come in and clean it out he said sometimes that gets into preachers he said you know sure I'll be a minister if everybody passing on the back says you're a good fellow so if everybody patted me on the back and said I was a good fellow I'd get to the altar just as quick as I could I know there'd be something wrong because the Bible says woe unto you and all men speak well of you he said the world knows its own the world will hate you but God will love you and then I would add to that what's your motive what's your objective so you're trying to achieve something is it personal or is it for the body is your objective to be looked at or to be seen or to be heard or because I would my feelings would be heard if I didn't do this or or if I did do it maybe my feelings would be hurt but what do you want to achieve there's got to be a goal what what is your goal in doing it and brother Brandon says this he said you might achieve to say I won't stop till I become a preacher I won't stop till I become a deacon I won't stop till I become a church member he said them things are all all right honorable but listen here brother don't you stop short of Jesus Christ or you haven't got an eternal achievement what's your motive what's your objective it's got to be Christ people's motive and objective is Christ we can put up with a lot if that's the real motive and objective but we need to examine ourselves I can't do that for you you have to do that he said your pastor your work of a pastor will soon fade away your work work as a deacon will soon go I know that's hard but it's true you spend all your life some of these Brothers Spend decades in a work of a deacon and then they're gone for a few years now you barely remember but it made a difference made a difference even on the people who don't remember your name the people that you met that you they don't remember who you are right all right brother Harvey I never thought that God would put us together but I remember brother Harvey when I was a young man not much older than these young men and I remember brother Harvey being at the door of the church and greeting us like he does you now and it made a difference in my life little things makes a difference stand at your post to duty you're doing something and God God knows he sees it you'll be rewarded for it makes a difference you're always the same you're always there and men like brother Danny and I called him out because they're Elders among us but all of you that that have been here Brother David White stood here with us all these years and different ones brother Harold stood all them years and and the elders that are here brother Bill sister Karen just having you around is such a blessing just to have you here you it means something for you to be in the house of God when you don't feel good and and things aren't going right but you're you're a shining Beacon to those of us of a younger generation who are a little softer you come up hard you come through some rough things you've been through some things and yet all your work as a deacon will soon go your church membership will be long dismissed from the minds of the people just a little while to come but if you've achieved Jesus Christ you've got eternal life and you can never die aren't you glad for that today if he called you to do a thing like a man said he said well I believe I can make more money if I was a preacher you'll never make a preacher God has to call you to be a preacher how can a preacher preach us the Lord of sin is that right he said it's all in God everything moves right back into God he said everything right back to him he sets the program we just fall in line and carry it out I'll say this last how do you represent the body of Christ to the world you want to have an office how do you represent the body of Christ to your community is your life worthy of the Gospel if not do us all a favor and seek a closer walk with God so he can use you because you need to be used but you young people especially you need to watch your life and as you get older you'll make mistakes you'll have trouble and the church will forgive you for that we we're just glad to have you here we'll forgive you but you want to make sure you keep your life right don't don't make those unalterable mistakes that'll make it where you can't ever be a deacon can't ever be a trustee can't ever work for God nobody trusts you don't do that live for God if you make a mistake come right back to God make it right make sure there's no arrogance in your heart no pride in your heart you're not doing what you're doing I'd rather quit everything and sit down and have one Speck of arrogance in my life because it'll ruin me and all the only thing I'll do is bring a black eye on the message and I'll bring a black eye on God's people Lord if I'm doing it for myself Set Me Down I wonder if we could have that attitude tonight see the little things matter we want to be in service for the king we want to be like the one that his lord said in him well done good and faithful servant that has been Faithful over a few things I'll make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord the little things matter our attitudes matter everything about what we do matters to the person beside us matters to the persons hiding behind our Shield Mark 9 41 says for whosoever to give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward and I'll say this if they will be rewarded what about you who have served God's people unselfishly for years there will be people in heaven because they gave you a cup of cold water I think some of those people but Joel we grew up around some of them Old Farmers and stuff just were nice to us the people who gave allowed the owner financing for my mom and dad to buy a home and raise us kids in a little home that it was out there in the country it means something to give a cup of cold water I'm a reader because that that lady she opened up her home to me as a young man at five years old started buying me books she had a library she was an educated woman but had given up her education and everything to live with a farmer and be a farm wife I remember she invited me into her library and I got to go in there and read those books and I've always read and I'm a reader thought oh part of my life to her doing that there will be a reward for that but if she will be rewarded think about it for a minute what about those of you who have done nothing but serve the body of Christ it's worth it whatever that service is find my place what am I best at what am I not good at let me figure that out what are my best at let me be that strong that strength to the church that I can be great is your reward closing with this musicians go ahead and come he said covet earnestly the best gifts and yet yet we've talked a lot about gifts we talk about tongues interpretation and we'll have some questions if you have questions be sure to let me know I've gotten a couple if you have questions about the gifts or anything for that matter but especially about the gifts as we're wrapping this this series up we've talked a lot about gifts but Paul says I'm going to show you a more excellent way than seeking gifts he said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love that word that translated charity in the King James version It's Love and in the original is agape I'm not the love of God and become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol brother Brandon said there's a lot of speaking in tongues a sounding brass and tinkling symbols a lot of so-called gifts that don't mean anything he says this he said friends the whole world is dying for love so that's one of the great things that we leave out of our Pentecostal blessing too much of it is love that mixes it together the mortar that makes gifts listen to me the mortar that makes gifts and all the things of God operate perfectly is love one for the other I love you so much that I don't want you to be hindered by me stepping out of my place understand I don't want to imitate a prophet because I'm not a prophet and for me the imitate a prophet is to step out of my place and I love you too much to do that we need to have that loved one for another that's the mortar that mixes it all together let me stay in my place because I love you too much to subject you to me being out of my place he said that makes gifts and all the things of God operate perfectly love one for the other would you bow your heads with me he said by this she'll know that they're my disciples the world will know that you are my disciples who said you had loved one for the other it was very different tonight but it's just what I had on my heart I trust that she'll you'll gain something from maybe you didn't learn anything tonight maybe you were reminded Lord help me to have love that's that's the thing that makes my preaching worthwhile makes my service to the church in whatever capacity that I'm called to do it in worthwhile is love otherwise it doesn't do any good or it'd help me to have that mortar help me to care about everybody just my family not just certain people fit my description I've noticed some of you lately reaching out to people beyond your circle I appreciate that mean something means something get out of your comfort zone a little bit find somebody in the church that's not your family to sit with and spend some time with it means something get out of your comfort zone and love the people of God they'll love you back it'll be worth it amen Heavenly Father Lord you you've called these people here on a Wednesday night for a reason I pray Lord that I got out of the way enough to just say something that would help them Lord and now we thank you once again for your presence we just want you to be first in our lives we want the best for the church Lord whatever that is we we want it Lord we we don't want to get caught up in our own personality and our arrogance or Pride or or conceit Lord may we be caught up in you our main achievement oh God is not being a pastor or Deacon or a trustee or any other part of the body but Lord our main achievement is to be Lord you to achieve you to have eternal life Lord and I think of the Widow ladies that are here the Widow women Lord sisters in the church that Lord they don't do anything much in the church maybe they can't even sing or they don't they don't often often need to let their voice even be heard but Lord they have a place it means something for them to be in their Pew tonight and or wherever they're at Lord that they're able Lord I know some that weren't able to come that want to be here or it strengthens me so much when I come out and see them still at their place or after the things that they've been through Lord I Thank you for them I thank you for young people Lord that are finding their way I thank you for for elders Lord that that have stayed the course which is much harder than what people realize who stuck it out oh God I pray you'd help me to be one of those if you Terry Lord one day when I lay my shield down oh God until that time let me let me fight for my brother let me fight for my sister oh God Lord I want I want the very I want the very best warriors to stand for me let them stand in front of me I don't care I don't have to be the one that gets all the approval I don't have to be the person that gets the most views the sermon against the most views on YouTube or on Facebook oh God or may we not think that way the one who has to make a church but oh God may we think like this Lord help let me be a help to my brother I want the very best out in front of me I want the very best of Angels the very best pastors oh God the very best that we can get I don't want to ever become jealous Lord or get to a place where I just don't I just want the people to hear me but oh God would you help me today help me to while I'm here oh God I'm in this body help me to be a soldier help me to fight Lord help me to be a help to Lord if you call

these people I pray you'd move in their lives Lord help us to recognize our temporary situation of life just a vapor it appears for a while and then it blows it goes away help us it's not worth it to fight feuds and war with one another to talk bad about one another oh God help us today from the least to the greatest Lord Purge our lives so God help us or before Isaiah could serve you when you come in your presence he said I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among the people of unclean lips oh God may you purge our lips tonight May the angel take the coal of fire off the altar Purge our
