[33:03] way of uplifted hand you see their need
[33:06] you see lord the the reason behind it
[33:10] father even to defy the law of gravity
[33:12] to raise a hand
[33:13] it must be some purpose lord father you
[33:16] know what it is
[33:17] big or little lord doesn't matter to you

[33:20] able lord to take care of every

[33:31] lord to overcome this this coveted
[33:34] the satan has fought us so much on this
[33:37] area but lord
[33:38] we believe that you're still god and if

[33:41] fighting lord then we know that you're
[33:42] about to do something and
[33:44] so we thank you for that lord and for
[33:47] each one father that is in need i think

[33:57] lord and give them strength father
[33:59] knowing where she is
[34:01] lord that she believed lord and it was a
[34:04] she had that the spirit which was a down
[34:06] payment of the resurrection

[34:23] life
[34:24] life to us we pray in jesus name
[34:28] amen amen it's good to
[34:31] know the presence of the lord is with us
[34:33] this morning turn with me
[34:35] to hebrews chapter 11 and verses 5 and
[34:37] 6.
[34:38] and then we'll also read from job
[34:40] chapter 32 and verse 8.
[34:42] that's hebrews 11 verses 5 and 6 and job
[34:46] 32-8 i don't
[34:50] remember the funeral
[34:53] coming up on tuesday and then we'll have
[34:56] our
[34:57] regular service on wednesday night so
[34:59] thankful to be able to still gather
[35:00] together and
[35:02] we believe that's given the devil a
[35:04] black eye
[35:06] my father would have been 68 years old
[35:10] today if he had lived he's been gone for
[35:12] about 10 years
[35:13] but he took us to church and i'm
[35:15] thankful for that
[35:17] my mother's here today and and my
[35:19] brother and family
[35:20] i uh i'm thankful for that you know you
[35:23] can do a lot of things wrong
[35:25] but if you take your children to church
[35:27] and get them around god's people
[35:30] get them exposed to the word and to the
[35:31] message of the hour that's saying
[35:33] something
[35:34] you've done something of eternal value
[35:36] in their lives so
[35:37] thank you for that if you brought your
[35:39] children today i'm a testimony of what
[35:41] god can do and how god can change your
[35:44] life hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5
[35:46] says by faith enoch was translated
[35:49] that he should not see death and was not
[35:52] found
[35:53] because god had translated him for
[35:56] before his translation
[35:58] he had this testimony that he pleased
[36:01] god don't you want that to be your
[36:04] testimony
[36:05] well here's how you have that testimony
[36:07] said but without faith it is impossible
[36:09] to please him verse 6 without faith it
[36:13] is impossible
[36:14] to please him for he that cometh to god
[36:17] must believe that he
[36:19] is and that he is the rewarder of them
[36:21] that diligently seek him
[36:23] and then job and 32-8
[36:26] it says but there is a spirit in man
[36:30] and the inspiration of the almighty
[36:33] giveth them understanding
[36:35] i'd like to speak on inspiration for the
[36:37] rapture i pray lord would add his
[36:38] blessing to the word you may be seated
[36:40] this morning
[36:45] many of you are familiar with i didn't
[36:47] bring any of the quotes but many of you
[36:48] are familiar with the phrase
[36:50] if you don't have faith for a headache
[36:53] how can you have rapturing faith or
[36:54] something
[36:55] to that extent that brother branham
[36:56] would say
[36:58] we don't have faith for a headache how
[36:59] can we have rapturing faith
[37:01] i've always taken that as an indictment
[37:03] of faith and i misunderstood it
[37:06] because it's not an indictment of the
[37:08] faith that we have
[37:09] brother branham is challenging
[37:11] challenging us to acknowledge that we do
[37:13] have the faith
[37:14] for a headache that faith has to be
[37:17] inspired
[37:18] it's got to be stimulated something
[37:20] there's got to be something happen
[37:22] to make that faith awaken in our lives
[37:24] and make it real
[37:26] and and so brother branham would tie
[37:28] that he talked about
[37:30] healing and said that healing is an
[37:32] earnest or a down payment
[37:34] on the resurrection if you get uh
[37:37] if you get healed as we talked about
[37:39] wednesday night you'll get sick again
[37:41] but it's a down payment it's showing us
[37:43] something it's god telling us look
[37:46] i've healed you i'm going to change your
[37:47] body
[37:49] i've healed you i'm going to give you a
[37:52] new body
[37:52] and so it's a down payment on the
[37:54] resurrection now
[37:56] uh the inspiration is is what comes to
[37:59] us that
[38:00] enables our faith to be put into actual
[38:03] uh work and action in our lives and so
[38:06] that we've got to have there's got to be
[38:08] an
[38:08] inspiration and there's got to be a
[38:10] revelation and brother branham
[38:12] said that faith is a revelation that it
[38:14] actually has to become real to us
[38:16] in a way and i believe that god does
[38:19] this for us at the right time and
[38:21] and so i don't want us to be sitting
[38:24] here and thinking well
[38:25] if i could do more if i could if i could
[38:27] live better if i could go to church more
[38:29] if i could do these things then
[38:31] maybe i i could be ready when a rapture
[38:33] comes then i'd catch it no
[38:36] it's something that when the time comes
[38:38] just like when you really needed healing
[38:40] healing come to you and whatever you
[38:43] needed in your life
[38:44] suddenly you caught the inspiration for
[38:46] that and and it came and so in god's
[38:49] time
[38:49] inspiration for the rapture just drops
[38:52] down
[38:53] and that's the moment when the bride
[38:55] catches it
[38:56] and we'll be ready at that time how will
[38:58] we be ready because god's already
[39:00] provided a way
[39:01] for us to be ready through the message
[39:03] of the hour and
[39:05] and the work of the holy spirit in our
[39:06] lives now inspiration is actually a word
[39:10] that if you go back into the origins of
[39:12] it it's a
[39:13] word that means to breathe or to blow
[39:15] into
[39:17] and so it means to breathe and
[39:20] it means also to influence to move or to
[39:22] guide
[39:23] through divine or supernatural agency or
[39:26] power
[39:27] so inspiration now has a
[39:30] inspiration as a term just means to uh
[39:33] to breathe in
[39:34] but actually uh in the
[39:38] the figurative meaning preceded the
[39:40] literal meaning which is not common in
[39:41] words but the figurative meaning
[39:44] was to move under divine or supernatural
[39:47] agency or power so it means to breathe
[39:51] or blow upon
[39:52] and then to breathe in or to infuse
[39:56] life by breathing and the scripture says
[39:59] in second timothy 3 16 that all
[40:01] scripture
[40:02] is given by inspiration of god and
[40:05] actually that greek word is
[40:06] is expiration god breathed literally the
[40:10] it's inspired of god it's the greek word
[40:13] theo nustos which is god breathed and
[40:16] now we look at the time that we live in
[40:19] and
[40:20] these are difficult times
[40:23] these are difficult times but in the
[40:25] scriptures they they come across
[40:26] difficult times and they had to face
[40:30] mountains and they had to face the devil
[40:32] and they had to deal with sickness and
[40:34] they had to deal with all these things
[40:35] but
[40:35] why were they able to deal with it
[40:37] because god breathed
[40:39] inspiration so that the word that was
[40:42] given could
[40:43] fit the hour that they lived in
[40:46] oh i hope you hear me today now and so
[40:49] when that when they needed it
[40:50] at an hour when everything was dark and
[40:52] all was lost when they needed it
[40:54] that word circled the earth until the
[40:55] time come and then it was inspired to
[40:58] the hearts of a believer
[41:00] and it become reality in their lives now
[41:05] when what inspiration does for us is it
[41:07] causes us to continue to pursue a goal
[41:10] through hardship
[41:14] and so you've got to have some
[41:16] inspiration
[41:17] if you're going to make it through life
[41:19] just just in the natural you've got to
[41:21] be inspired to something
[41:24] maybe your children inspire you maybe
[41:26] your your family your wife
[41:28] maybe something you've read maybe a
[41:30] father maybe a mother
[41:31] something had to inspire you to do what
[41:33] you're doing today
[41:35] it could be something good it could be
[41:36] something bad it could be
[41:38] just something that made you what you
[41:40] are today something's got to inspire you
[41:42] if you're going to act in a way that
[41:45] would make you pursue a goal
[41:46] through hardship brother branham tells
[41:49] us in the message returning jubilee he
[41:51] said it goes to show
[41:52] what faith can do he said i think if a
[41:55] person
[41:56] ever is sure in their heart and has
[41:58] something that faith can anchor on
[42:01] he said they should never cease
[42:04] amen he said no matter how many times
[42:07] they're defeated
[42:09] they should continue on
[42:12] amen and brother branham when he's
[42:14] telling that he's telling a story of
[42:16] walt disney
[42:17] he talks about how that walt disney was
[42:19] a in a garage and he'd been
[42:22] sent his drawings to people and they've
[42:24] been rejected time and time again
[42:26] and he's sitting in a rat infested
[42:28] garage and he's watching as the mice
[42:30] play in the garage and all of a sudden
[42:33] something hit
[42:34] something inspired him as he watched a
[42:37] particular mouse as it as it played
[42:39] there in the garage
[42:40] and when that inspired him something
[42:43] happened that he created
[42:44] a multi-million dollar empire actually
[42:46] multi-billion dollar
[42:47] empire and so brother branham picks up
[42:49] on that story he said if a man can do
[42:51] that by the natural
[42:52] he said what about a man that's been
[42:54] pulsated by the holy spirit
[42:57] and that's another word that brother
[42:58] brown uses for inspiration or
[43:00] stimulation is
[43:01] pulsation pulsation is something inside
[43:04] of you that
[43:05] that pulses something that that causes
[43:07] you to do more than what you thought you
[43:09] could do
[43:10] he said that's been pulsated by the holy
[43:12] spirit that believes
[43:13] that god wants his achievements to be
[43:15] brought to people
[43:17] and will stay with the scripture
[43:20] amen now how we are inspired depends on
[43:25] the potentials that we have
[43:28] you see many men had seen mice play on
[43:31] the floor
[43:33] didn't do nothing for them other than
[43:35] inspire them to go out and buy a mouse
[43:37] trap
[43:39] right that's what it would do for me it
[43:42] wouldn't inspire me to draw a drawing
[43:44] and
[43:44] and make a billion dollar empire out of
[43:46] it i'd buy a mousetrap
[43:50] right and so you look at different men
[43:52] that have been inspired in that
[43:54] way and isaac newton was inspired when
[43:55] an apple fell
[43:58] and apple fell and and i don't know if
[44:01] it hit him on the head as the story goes
[44:03] but he saw that he thought
[44:05] gravity and i saw an apple fell and all
[44:08] i wanted to do was eat the apple
[44:11] right and so you you could maybe you
[44:14] you've not been inspired as others were
[44:17] and because it's just not in everybody
[44:19] to be inspired in that way
[44:22] with me now it already had to be in them
[44:25] even though walt disney didn't have the
[44:26] multi-billion dollar company but the
[44:28] the the potentials of that company
[44:32] the potentials of mickey mouse was
[44:35] already inside of him well you've got
[44:38] something inside of you that's much
[44:39] greater than mickey mouse
[44:41] much greater than anything this world
[44:43] could be inspired to
[44:44] but there's something inside of you that
[44:46] that can be inspired hope you're with me
[44:50] now
[44:51] there's something inside of the believer
[44:53] that can be inspired to live in a
[44:55] perfect place
[44:57] there's something inside of the believer
[44:59] that can be inspired to heaven
[45:02] the world wouldn't even even be happy
[45:04] there
[45:05] you know people wouldn't even be they
[45:07] talk about going to heaven but they
[45:08] really
[45:09] wouldn't even understand or wouldn't be
[45:10] content to be there but there's
[45:12] something inside
[45:13] of the seed of god that's inspirable if
[45:16] that's the word that's
[45:17] able to be inspired into what god wants
[45:20] them to be
[45:22] so there's something inside of you
[45:23] that's able to live
[45:25] i hope you're hearing me this morning
[45:27] something inside of the believer is able
[45:29] to live in the land
[45:30] that's why our sister and i've heard i
[45:32] didn't know her but i've heard
[45:33] that passed away i've heard so many good
[45:35] things about her life and how she lived
[45:37] why
[45:37] she was inspired how to live in a better
[45:40] place
[45:42] are you with me now she was inspired
[45:44] here and it shows in your life here
[45:46] how you're inspired for over there i
[45:49] don't fit here i'm a pilgrim and a
[45:50] stranger
[45:51] why did abraham wander the earth like he
[45:53] did why did he go back and forth and
[45:55] never was content and had no continuing
[45:57] city on this earth why
[45:58] did he live that way because he was
[46:00] inspired for a city that was not made
[46:03] with hands
[46:06] now not many people today
[46:10] recognize the name of edward everett
[46:14] edward everett was a great speaker a
[46:16] great politician and also a preacher
[46:19] he was a great man he was called to
[46:22] speak
[46:23] at gettysburg on november 19 1863
[46:27] because of he was a great orator
[46:29] he spoke for over two hours had his
[46:32] thoughts
[46:33] carefully if you read it it's hard to
[46:35] read but if you read it
[46:37] it has his thoughts carefully prepared
[46:39] and every line just laid out just
[46:41] perfectly
[46:43] but a man named abraham lincoln was
[46:45] president
[46:47] and they asked him to come and just
[46:48] speak for a moment
[46:50] and on the way there he scribbles it
[46:52] down on a napkin in the train
[46:54] what he's going to say he spoke for
[46:57] three minutes
[46:59] edward everett spoke over three hours mr
[47:02] everett had carefully prepared his
[47:03] speech lincoln wrote his on the back of
[47:05] a napkin
[47:06] which one survived
[47:09] all right and but that ought to be a
[47:11] lesson to some of us preachers
[47:17] but abraham lincoln spoke for three
[47:19] minutes but what it was it was inspired
[47:23] it was inspired to that moment and to
[47:25] deal with that situation
[47:28] are you with me now but joel may have
[47:31] been agreeing too much there
[47:36] so now brother branham talks about in
[47:39] the message whatever he says to you do
[47:41] it
[47:41] he says now on the platform he said when
[47:43] the holy spirit's speaking
[47:45] he said he's speaking through mortal
[47:47] lips
[47:49] now he he don't stop there but he says
[47:51] he always does
[47:54] he always does he said i believe these
[47:57] are ministers behind me he said and
[47:58] brethren
[47:59] you never preached a sermon in your life
[48:01] the holy spirit preached through you a
[48:04] sermon said that's right see we don't
[48:07] preach
[48:08] the holy spirit does the speaking he
[48:10] said oh we might write out something and
[48:12] read it
[48:13] but that isn't preaching now watch he
[48:15] said preaching was is when inspiration
[48:17] comes
[48:18] and it's preached by inspiration and the
[48:20] holy spirit gives the unction
[48:23] now he says now we can read something
[48:26] and it just doesn't matter
[48:28] when the holy spirit gets a hold of it
[48:31] so it's not wrong to read it he's not
[48:32] saying it's wrong to have notes or read
[48:34] something because brother branham did
[48:36] that
[48:36] he said it's not it's not that you're
[48:39] reading it but he said when the holy
[48:40] spirit gets a hold of what you're
[48:41] reading
[48:42] takes it out to the people then
[48:43] something takes hold
[48:45] he said and that's the holy spirit he
[48:47] said that's not your pastor preaching
[48:49] that's the holy spirit preaching in your
[48:51] pastor out to you
[48:53] giving the message
[48:57] well here's the sermon we talked about
[48:58] this morning brother david
[49:00] and the unchangeable god working in an
[49:02] unexpectable way
[49:04] brother brown says well now he has no
[49:06] hands on earth but mine and yours
[49:09] his voice on earth is ours our voice is
[49:13] given to him
[49:14] he said that's why we preached the
[49:16] gospel he said we believe it's not
[49:18] us we're inspired to preach those things
[49:22] the holy spirit is speaking through us
[49:26] so a word spoken by inspiration can do
[49:29] more
[49:30] than a thousand words spoken by
[49:33] knowledge
[49:34] right just by what we know and so he
[49:36] said we're inspired to preach those
[49:38] things now
[49:39] he said we don't believe it's we can do
[49:41] that he said certainly not
[49:43] he said i know i couldn't he said we
[49:45] know that it's the inspiration
[49:47] of the holy spirit
[49:50] and if you're going to speak that way
[49:52] something has to be inspired and it's
[49:54] your faith
[49:55] that's inspired to speak again as we
[49:58] talked about wednesday night there's got
[49:59] to be
[50:00] an inspiration that comes and brother
[50:02] branham dealt with that and maybe we'll
[50:04] get into it in some other sermon but
[50:05] brother branham dealt with how
[50:07] the people ask him a question and i've
[50:09] always wanted to meet the person who
[50:11] wrote this question to brother branham
[50:12] because
[50:14] you know they they were looking for a
[50:15] shortcut is what it sounds like
[50:18] because they said brother branham if if
[50:20] you could speak the word and speak the
[50:21] squirrels all these things he said
[50:23] couldn't you just speak us a new body
[50:26] and brother adam said yes basically is
[50:28] what he said
[50:29] but then he went on and said you have to
[50:31] you have to only do what you're told
[50:34] right you can't do it i'm paraphrasing
[50:36] but you can't do it unless you're told
[50:37] to do it
[50:39] and he explains it in very much detail
[50:41] so that's not what it was
[50:42] see you've got to speak
[50:45] are you with me now and i believe with
[50:48] all my heart that it won't be
[50:50] it won't be any man or any prophet
[50:53] speaking
[50:54] that'll put you in a rapture it'll be
[50:57] you
[50:57] speaking the message of the prophet or
[51:01] the message of god
[51:03] are you with me now it has to be and you
[51:06] go and look at what brother branham
[51:07] taught and how he taught it in
[51:08] the unveiling of god and perfect faith
[51:10] and all those things it's you that
[51:11] speaks
[51:13] right and then when you speak it puts
[51:15] you in the place
[51:17] he's putting it back on you as we read
[51:18] wednesday night he said the third poll
[51:20] he said puts it back on the people
[51:23] right now now
[51:26] brother branham says in
[51:29] he said hear him in 1956 he said that's
[51:32] the way it is this afternoon
[51:33] and he had just he just told the story
[51:35] excuse me for
[51:36] for breaking things up but my mind is is
[51:39] whirling this morning i'm
[51:40] i'm praying that god will just somehow
[51:42] take these pieces
[51:43] and put them together in a way that we
[51:45] can understand but
[51:47] brother branham said that's the way it
[51:48] is this afternoon and he was talking
[51:50] about how jesus
[51:52] talked to his disciples and said who do
[51:54] you say that i am
[51:55] he said who do men say that i am he then
[51:56] he said who do you say that i am
[51:58] and peter said thou art the christ why
[52:01] he was inspired to that
[52:04] to speak that and and here you hear him
[52:06] by the brahman said that's the way it is
[52:07] this afternoon
[52:08] if our nature becomes converted from the
[52:10] things of the world to the nature of the
[52:12] holy spirit
[52:13] god will take his stand i love that
[52:17] and he will abide on us amen
[52:20] if our nature becomes converted from the
[52:23] things of the world to the nature of the
[52:24] holy spirit
[52:25] god will take his stand and he will
[52:28] abide on us listen
[52:30] inspired believers taking in the
[52:33] inspired word
[52:35] those two together bring the results
[52:38] it brings the word to life then what can
[52:41] we have this morning
[52:43] what are our limitations what what can
[52:45] we have happen here among us this
[52:46] morning
[52:47] when inspired believers come and take in
[52:50] the inspired word
[52:52] brother brown said that's two
[52:53] omnipotents meat
[52:55] amen inspired believers taking in the
[52:58] inspired word what can happen
[52:59] he said the inspiration that's in your
[53:01] heart puts the word to living
[53:04] amen the inspiration in your heart puts
[53:07] the word to living because
[53:08] he said you could take a grain of corn
[53:10] lay it on a desk no matter how well it's
[53:11] polished it might be 14 carats it'll
[53:13] never produce any more corn
[53:15] he said no matter how pretty the desk is
[53:17] how genuine the gold is
[53:18] it's laying on he said how real
[53:20] germatized the corn is
[53:22] the corns got to fall in the rich
[53:24] fertile dirt to bring forth results
[53:27] once they gotta fall in inspired dirt
[53:32] are you with me now he said when the
[53:34] word of god
[53:35] amen is put into the fertile grounds
[53:40] of the inspired believer what does it
[53:43] produce
[53:44] it produces just exactly what god said
[53:47] it would do
[53:49] amen don't you see those two
[53:52] inspirations have to me that's why we
[53:53] have to stay only with the word we can't
[53:56] take a man's word for it
[53:57] can't take our somebody else's word for
[53:59] it a preacher's word for it we've got to
[54:00] stay with the word
[54:02] because the word of god is in an
[54:03] omnipotent and then
[54:05] we are an omnipotent when you put those
[54:07] two things together it's the word
[54:08] meaning the word the inspired word
[54:10] meaning the inspired word
[54:12] when the word of god is put in the
[54:13] fertile grounds of the inspired believer
[54:15] it produces just exactly what god said
[54:17] it would do because it can't
[54:18] fail you believe that today
[54:22] it can't fail it's god's eternal word
[54:24] got to awaken the people
[54:26] i love this got to bring us to something
[54:28] when the word is received
[54:31] when the word is received now take that
[54:33] back to healing which we talked about
[54:35] wednesday night if you're healed
[54:38] then you had to receive your healing not
[54:41] just believe on with the mind but
[54:42] receive it
[54:44] amen receive your healing you got to be
[54:48] inspired to it and so
[54:50] now he said you've got to receive it
[54:53] when the word is received it brings us
[54:55] to something it's got to
[54:58] he said and that's the inspiration and
[55:00] man is in no condition outside of
[55:03] repentance he's no condition
[55:05] to receive the word until first he's
[55:07] been inspired
[55:11] that's why you can't just educate
[55:13] someone into the message
[55:15] he's got to be inspired to it if he's
[55:18] not inspired to it it doesn't do any
[55:20] good and i could sit there and argue and
[55:22] counsel and work with him work with him
[55:23] work with him but it's got to be
[55:24] inspired
[55:26] there's got to be something that makes
[55:27] it real it says i believe this is true
[55:30] and what was that was the way hattie
[55:32] wright was she stood there and she said
[55:34] it's nothing but the truth what was it
[55:35] the word that was coming through a
[55:37] prophet she
[55:38] was inspired to that word when she was
[55:41] the word did what it promised what it
[55:43] said it would do
[55:45] amen could i put it this way the word
[55:48] did what she
[55:49] said it would do.
[55:53] amen because that was the promise of the
[55:55] word that you and your family could be
[55:57] saved
[55:57] and so the word did and that's where
[56:00] brother brown says you got to make your
[56:02] decision like joshua made his son stand
[56:04] still you got to make your decision the
[56:06] word
[56:06] did what she said it would do
[56:09] amen hallelujah
[56:13] now he said
[56:17] feeling good this morning you just thank
[56:19] you thank you for
[56:20] for praying now
[56:23] brother branham talks about peter said
[56:25] look at peter down there they said who
[56:26] do men say
[56:27] i the son of man am some say you're john
[56:29] the baptist others said they are elias
[56:30] some said you're the prophet jeremiah
[56:32] and others say you're the prophet that
[56:34] was to come
[56:35] jesus answered and said who do you say
[56:36] that i am see salvation is not based
[56:38] upon what someone else thinks
[56:40] it's what you think of him divine
[56:43] healing isn't based on what the critic
[56:44] says
[56:45] or what the church says it's based on
[56:48] your perfect faith
[56:50] in the inspired word of god and how
[56:53] you're inspired
[56:54] to believe that
[56:58] let me read that part again it's based
[57:00] on your perfect faith in the inspired
[57:02] word of god
[57:03] and how you're inspired to believe that
[57:07] he said that's what brings the results
[57:09] is your inspiration
[57:12] by the word he said what does it do for
[57:15] you
[57:16] he said who does men say as the son of
[57:17] man i am he said some jeremiah son of
[57:19] the prophet said but who do you say that
[57:21] i
[57:21] am he said oh sometimes this cost a
[57:24] price to really say it
[57:26] sometimes it causes separations in homes
[57:30] sometimes it causes separations in
[57:32] churches
[57:33] sometimes it causes separation in lodges
[57:35] in all walks of life
[57:37] sometimes between husband and wife he
[57:39] said to really speak
[57:40] out who do you say that i am
[57:44] amen he said but i like peter
[57:47] he said he has a lot of mistakes like i
[57:49] have
[57:51] amen he said but this one time
[57:55] hallelujah don't you realize he said
[57:57] well i've made too many mistakes i can't
[57:58] go in a rapture
[57:59] but this one time this one time he was
[58:02] really inspired
[58:04] yes he stood up quickly and said the
[58:06] hour to christ the son of the living god
[58:08] oh my what a statement thou art the
[58:10] christ
[58:11] hallelujah paul was so inspired by an
[58:14] angel one time that spoke to him and
[58:16] said he would appear before caesar
[58:18] that he could whistle during a storm he
[58:21] could lay there sleeping
[58:23] while the storm was raging and when the
[58:26] boat broke apart
[58:27] he said not one of not one person will
[58:29] be lost
[58:30] and he gets it he gets to an island and
[58:33] he's gathering wood
[58:34] he puts it on the fire and snake bites
[58:36] him he just shakes it off
[58:38] why because he was inspired to the word
[58:40] of god
[58:41] said you'll appear before caesar he
[58:43] believed that he was inspired to him
[58:46] luther was inspired by the revelation of
[58:50] justification
[58:52] he was inspired by the the understanding
[58:54] of
[58:55] what this meant the gesture lived by
[58:57] faith
[58:58] he was so inspired he went to the church
[59:00] door and he nailed
[59:01] 95 thesis to the door at wittenberg and
[59:05] wesley was so inspired
[59:07] all by the revelation of sanctification
[59:09] that he preached in the fields
[59:11] and england shook for the gospel
[59:15] they said that the revival was so great
[59:17] that that when
[59:18] when wesleyanism would come through a
[59:20] town when when the revival would come
[59:22] through
[59:22] that there would be no bars left no pubs
[59:25] there would be there would be no drugs
[59:27] it would just
[59:27] the whole town would be converted why
[59:30] because a man was inspired that god's
[59:32] word was true
[59:33] that you could live for god
[59:38] see it took inspiration to to the word
[59:40] for that hour
[59:42] you know and you could be inspired to
[59:44] that today we are inspired to that word
[59:46] today
[59:47] but we have more we're inspired to the
[59:49] word for our day
[59:51] are you with me now but during that time
[59:54] when the inspiration struck at the time
[59:56] that it was supposed to come
[59:57] it shook england now the end time bride
[1:00:00] is inspired
[1:00:02] what are we inspired by now
[1:00:06] i you could take from the message of the
[1:00:09] hour and we could see
[1:00:11] that there's something that's got to
[1:00:12] happen so we can have
[1:00:14] rapturing faith and and i don't even
[1:00:17] like the way i put that but
[1:00:19] you understand we have faith
[1:00:24] right it has to be inspired
[1:00:27] and so if you say oh i don't have any
[1:00:29] faith but jesus said if you had the
[1:00:31] faith of a grain of a mustard seed
[1:00:33] right and and so how much faith does it
[1:00:36] take
[1:00:37] to change your body well
[1:00:40] it takes the faith god's faith the faith
[1:00:42] that's in you
[1:00:44] right and you have that faith but you're
[1:00:47] not inspired to it yet you say how could
[1:00:49] you say that but then well
[1:00:50] we're not changed right
[1:00:54] but yet the inspiration has come to us
[1:00:58] and there's something come to us
[1:01:00] that's bringing us to that place because
[1:01:03] the rapture is not just an event
[1:01:06] but it's something that's going on
[1:01:09] there's a work going on among the bride
[1:01:12] that's bringing you to that place
[1:01:16] and what's happening is actually you're
[1:01:18] being inspired
[1:01:19] to the word for your day now
[1:01:23] what in particular would inspire you to
[1:01:25] that word brother branham says that
[1:01:27] speaking of in this in is this the sign
[1:01:29] of the answer he speaks of
[1:01:31] the angels of the church age angels he
[1:01:32] said the other angels was messengers men
[1:01:34] of the earth
[1:01:35] but this angel is speaking of the angel
[1:01:37] in revelation 10 1.
[1:01:39] these said to the angel church of
[1:01:40] laodicea to the angel of the church of
[1:01:42] ephesus messengers of the earth see men
[1:01:44] messengers prophets so forth to the
[1:01:46] church but this one didn't come from the
[1:01:48] earth he come down from heaven
[1:01:50] because the mystery is all finished and
[1:01:52] when the mystery is finished the angel
[1:01:54] said time shall be no more
[1:01:55] and seven thunders throw their voices
[1:01:57] out
[1:01:59] and he says this he said what if it is
[1:02:00] something to let us know
[1:02:02] how to enter into the rapturing
[1:02:05] he said is it will we run leap over
[1:02:08] walls
[1:02:09] well that takes something for me to do
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:13] will it run will we run leap over walls
[1:02:15] there is there something fixing to
[1:02:17] happen
[1:02:18] he said in these old marred vile bodies
[1:02:20] are going to be changed
[1:02:21] oh i believe it he said can i live to
[1:02:25] see it o lord is it so close that i'll
[1:02:27] see it
[1:02:28] he said is this the generation he's
[1:02:30] asking these questions
[1:02:32] sirs he said my brethren what time is it
[1:02:35] where are we at and on down on that
[1:02:39] sermon he says and i don't know
[1:02:41] i don't know slurs i'm only honest with
[1:02:42] you as my brothers i don't know
[1:02:44] is it time is the mystery all finished
[1:02:47] it's the sounding all over he said is
[1:02:49] that really them seven thunders
[1:02:51] fixing to utter out something that the
[1:02:54] little group that has gathered together
[1:02:56] will receive a rapturing faith to go in
[1:02:59] the rapture when he comes he said for
[1:03:00] will be changed
[1:03:02] as quick as those angels come in a
[1:03:04] moment in a twinkling of an
[1:03:05] eye shall be caught up together with
[1:03:07] those that had sleep or had slept to
[1:03:09] meet the lord in the air
[1:03:12] now brother branham so he speaks of this
[1:03:15] could it be
[1:03:16] that it'll be those seven thunders
[1:03:18] that'll bring that about
[1:03:19] and in the first seal again he says at
[1:03:22] the end of the pentecostal age we're
[1:03:23] supposed to receive according to the
[1:03:25] word as god help me tonight to show you
[1:03:27] through here that we are to see receive
[1:03:29] a messenger that will take all those
[1:03:30] loose ends out there and reveal
[1:03:32] the whole secret of god for the
[1:03:33] rapturing of the church he said then
[1:03:36] there is coming forth seven mysterious
[1:03:37] thunders that's not even written at all
[1:03:39] now keep in mind what he says later and
[1:03:41] we'll read it about how that it was
[1:03:43] there but it wasn't revealed
[1:03:45] he said that's right he said i believe
[1:03:46] that through those seven thunders will
[1:03:48] be revealed
[1:03:49] he said in the last days in order to get
[1:03:51] the bride together for rapturing faith
[1:03:54] because what we got right now we
[1:03:56] wouldn't be able to do it
[1:04:00] and they had faith for healing but
[1:04:01] that's just a down payment on what's
[1:04:03] coming
[1:04:05] right now so there had to be something
[1:04:07] coming brother reynolds ministry that
[1:04:09] would come to that and
[1:04:10] if you go back and refer back to what we
[1:04:12] preached on
[1:04:13] wednesday night how brother branham kept
[1:04:15] talking about the third poll and how it
[1:04:16] was coming and what it was
[1:04:18] and how that the spoken word was a sign
[1:04:20] of that and what's coming
[1:04:22] he said and brother brown says there is
[1:04:25] something
[1:04:26] he said we've got to step farther and
[1:04:28] this is in the first seal
[1:04:30] he said we can't have enough faith for
[1:04:32] divine healing hardly
[1:04:34] we've got to have enough faith to be
[1:04:35] changed
[1:04:37] in a moment and be swept out of this
[1:04:38] earth and we'll find that
[1:04:40] after a while i love this the lord
[1:04:42] willing to find where it's written
[1:04:45] he said it's seven thunders that weren't
[1:04:47] even written at all and he said well
[1:04:48] fine where it's written
[1:04:51] amen amen and and don't get nervous on
[1:04:55] me i'm not about to preach that the
[1:04:56] thunders or the virtues so
[1:05:00] i'm i'm gonna stay right with the
[1:05:02] message this morning
[1:05:04] we'll be all right if we do that right
[1:05:07] you know what brother branham talked
[1:05:08] about how that he
[1:05:10] a man went to hire a mule driver or a
[1:05:12] driver to drive him around
[1:05:14] up a mountain he said he went to higher
[1:05:16] one he said oh yeah he said i'm the best
[1:05:17] driver there is i can get
[1:05:18] so close to the edge that i can just i
[1:05:21] just
[1:05:22] ride right along the edge all the way up
[1:05:23] he said i don't want him
[1:05:25] he finally found an old man that said
[1:05:27] i'm not very good he said but i stay
[1:05:28] just as close as i can to the wall to
[1:05:30] the mountain
[1:05:32] that's what we want didn't it stay just
[1:05:34] as close as i can to the message of the
[1:05:36] hour because that's what's going to take
[1:05:37] us home
[1:05:39] now now he says
[1:05:42] he says uh in the first seal again he
[1:05:44] said but when he started to write these
[1:05:45] other seven thunders
[1:05:47] he said don't write it he'd been
[1:05:48] commissioned to write everything he's
[1:05:49] seen
[1:05:50] but when those seven thunders over in
[1:05:52] revelation 10 uttered he said don't
[1:05:54] write them at all
[1:05:55] he said they're mysteries we don't know
[1:05:57] what they are yet but my opinion they'll
[1:05:59] be revealed right away
[1:06:01] he said and when it does it'll give
[1:06:02] faith for that rapturing grace
[1:06:05] remember what we talked about wednesday
[1:06:06] night that rapturing grace
[1:06:08] has to be there for rapturing faith
[1:06:12] you can't do it on your own you can't
[1:06:14] produce rapturing faith by yourself
[1:06:17] it's got to be rapturing grace by the
[1:06:19] way so those astronauts are wrapped in
[1:06:20] rapturing grace
[1:06:22] for rapturing faith and so he said for
[1:06:24] that church to move out he said this
[1:06:26] and and so we find that that's true and
[1:06:28] brother brown talked about how that'll
[1:06:29] do that now
[1:06:31] so we could establish in the seven
[1:06:33] thunders at least what brother brown
[1:06:35] said that they would bring
[1:06:36] about rapturing faith
[1:06:40] and so then we would ask what are the
[1:06:43] seven thunders and i know
[1:06:44] some of you many of you maybe all of you
[1:06:46] know this but
[1:06:48] we've got to know where we stand and be
[1:06:49] reminded
[1:06:51] of where we're at because the devil will
[1:06:53] shake you with current conditions
[1:06:56] right the devil will use you know time
[1:06:59] is the enemy
[1:07:00] of faith i've always preached that time
[1:07:02] is the enemy of faith
[1:07:03] and that's why as time goes on as the
[1:07:05] delay continues
[1:07:07] people jesus talked about how that they
[1:07:09] begin to smite one another and all these
[1:07:11] things begin to happen because of time
[1:07:14] time you begin to think well it's not
[1:07:15] going to happen but abraham held on he
[1:07:17] was the father of faith
[1:07:19] because he held on to the promise all
[1:07:21] the way through
[1:07:22] until he saw it fulfilled and so time
[1:07:24] being the enemy of faith you begin to
[1:07:26] think well what's going to happen
[1:07:27] and people have come up with all kinds
[1:07:28] of ideas well they said well brother
[1:07:31] branham has to come back and
[1:07:32] preach those seven thunders to put us in
[1:07:34] a rapturing condition
[1:07:36] but there's no scripture for that and if
[1:07:39] that was the case then
[1:07:41] what about what we're about to read
[1:07:43] where brother brown said that he already
[1:07:44] did it
[1:07:46] right and so that wouldn't make any
[1:07:47] sense it wouldn't fit with the word and
[1:07:49] so
[1:07:50] then someone might say and well-meaning
[1:07:52] people might say well
[1:07:54] uh you know you have to the thunders you
[1:07:55] have to realize that they're the virtues
[1:07:57] but brother
[1:07:57] didn't ever say that right that's a
[1:08:00] problem
[1:08:02] it's a problem for us to preach what
[1:08:03] brother branham never said
[1:08:05] but if he actually told us what it was
[1:08:08] then we believe it and it's not to try
[1:08:12] to make something out of it that it's
[1:08:13] not but to believe what's there
[1:08:15] and the challenge i think of our day is
[1:08:17] to to place ourselves
[1:08:19] and stand steady brother branham talked
[1:08:22] about and there's a great quote you can
[1:08:23] go find it but around talked about how
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:25] stabilizers have been put on the ship
[1:08:28] this is a time when
[1:08:29] when it looks like nothing's going on
[1:08:31] but god's doing something
[1:08:34] something great now so brother branham
[1:08:37] if you'll go if you want to understand
[1:08:39] the thunders
[1:08:41] and you want to understand how that fits
[1:08:42] with the seals
[1:08:44] you go to a sermon called christ is the
[1:08:46] mystery of god revealed
[1:08:48] brother branham talks about it and he
[1:08:50] says god's great mystery of how it's a
[1:08:52] secret
[1:08:53] he said he kept it a secret nobody knows
[1:08:55] nothing about it he said even the angels
[1:08:57] didn't understand it he didn't reveal it
[1:08:59] he said that's the reason under our
[1:09:00] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[1:09:02] was open there was silence
[1:09:04] jesus when he was on earth they want to
[1:09:06] know when he would come he said even the
[1:09:07] son of
[1:09:08] man son himself don't know when he's
[1:09:10] when it's going to happen
[1:09:11] see god has this all to himself it's a
[1:09:13] secret he said that's the reason there
[1:09:15] was silence in heaven for a space of a
[1:09:16] half hour
[1:09:17] seven thunders under their voices since
[1:09:19] john was even forbidden to write it
[1:09:22] see the coming of the lord he said
[1:09:24] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[1:09:25] of how he will come and when he will
[1:09:27] come
[1:09:27] he said it's a good thing that he
[1:09:28] doesn't but iran talked about how part
[1:09:30] of that seven steal was revealed
[1:09:31] he said and then there was a part that
[1:09:33] was still a mystery now
[1:09:35] there will be a part that remains a
[1:09:36] mystery no one's ever going to know the
[1:09:38] day in the hour
[1:09:40] right but there had to be part that we
[1:09:41] understood
[1:09:43] because our faith had to be inspired to
[1:09:45] it
[1:09:47] there had to be something that made us
[1:09:49] understand more than what the
[1:09:50] what the world understands what the
[1:09:52] nominal church understands
[1:09:54] there had to be something that come in
[1:09:55] and made us understand
[1:09:57] he's coming and that be more than just a
[1:10:01] well he's coming one day but it'd be a
[1:10:03] reality he's coming because i know
[1:10:06] i've seen the seventh of the messenger
[1:10:08] come i've seen that the seals open the
[1:10:10] thunders
[1:10:10] have uttered their voices these things
[1:10:12] have happened and so i know
[1:10:14] he's not just coming but we're living
[1:10:16] right here
[1:10:18] and it's that understanding that it that
[1:10:22] actually
[1:10:22] ignites our faith that inspires our
[1:10:25] faith
[1:10:25] to a body change are you with me now but
[1:10:28] not just a mental understanding but a
[1:10:30] revelation of it
[1:10:32] amen i don't think we've really caught a
[1:10:35] revelation because when we get
[1:10:37] fully to that revelation of it
[1:10:40] our bodies will be changed
[1:10:44] amen now look
[1:10:47] brother branham says it's one thing he
[1:10:50] hasn't revealed yet how he will come
[1:10:51] when he will come it's a good thing he
[1:10:52] doesn't he said he is
[1:10:53] out but look this next quote this
[1:10:55] follows it exactly
[1:10:57] that was paragraph 106 this is 107. he
[1:11:00] said he doesn't know
[1:11:02] he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:11:03] type that's in the bible
[1:11:07] so he said god has this all to himself
[1:11:10] but he says he showed or revealed in
[1:11:11] every
[1:11:12] type that's in the bible therefore the
[1:11:14] entire bible is the revelation
[1:11:16] of god's mystery in christ the entire
[1:11:19] bible is an expression
[1:11:21] of one goal that god had
[1:11:24] amen one purpose he wanted to achieve
[1:11:28] in the entire bible now what do we say
[1:11:30] about inspiration you're inspired to
[1:11:32] reach a goal in spite of hardship
[1:11:35] why because of the revelation that you
[1:11:37] have walt disney had a revelation
[1:11:39] he had that inspiration hey this mickey
[1:11:41] mouse there's something to it
[1:11:43] i see a business i see being able to
[1:11:46] support my family i see something and he
[1:11:47] didn't even understand maybe
[1:11:49] all that it was but he was inspired to
[1:11:51] it oh church don't you realize you've
[1:11:53] got to be inspired to the message of the
[1:11:55] hour
[1:11:57] and people draw inspiration from all
[1:11:58] kinds of things there's people who draw
[1:12:00] inspiration by how loud you preach
[1:12:02] but pentecost has that there's people
[1:12:05] who draw inspiration from
[1:12:07] from how much jumping and dancing and
[1:12:08] shouting and i i like i'm i'll be honest
[1:12:11] i'm inspired by that too
[1:12:13] but i love to see that but the
[1:12:15] inspiration for the rapture comes from
[1:12:17] somewhere else
[1:12:19] it doesn't come from anything pentecost
[1:12:21] had because his brother brown said
[1:12:23] pentecost could not
[1:12:24] could not copy this
[1:12:28] there's got to be something greater than
[1:12:30] what they had it's got to be something
[1:12:31] greater than even what we've had
[1:12:34] but it's got to be an inspiration to the
[1:12:36] word of god
[1:12:37] for our hour amen are you with me now
[1:12:42] so you can say brother do you believe
[1:12:43] something greater is coming yes i do
[1:12:44] it's the rapture
[1:12:45] the culmination of that it's the
[1:12:48] finalization of the change of our bodies
[1:12:50] that's what's coming that's what we're
[1:12:52] reaching to
[1:12:54] but it comes by inspiration by
[1:12:57] revelation
[1:12:58] of the word of god now
[1:13:01] he says all the acts of the believers in
[1:13:04] the bible has been in time
[1:13:06] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:13:09] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:13:11] it
[1:13:12] and shows it he said and god's help will
[1:13:14] see it right here this morning what the
[1:13:16] lord
[1:13:16] has had in his mind all along and has
[1:13:19] expressed it
[1:13:21] he talked about that threefold purpose
[1:13:23] of god now
[1:13:25] in the unveiling of god i know i'm
[1:13:26] reading a lot this morning but i pray
[1:13:28] the holy spirit as the prophet said
[1:13:29] would inspire these words to you
[1:13:32] he said everyone has always come to me
[1:13:34] and said brother branham
[1:13:35] them seven thunders that the voice
[1:13:37] thundered he said write it not but close
[1:13:38] it up
[1:13:39] he said that'll be seven thunders that
[1:13:40] will be revealed in the last days see
[1:13:42] seven thunders that'll tell us
[1:13:43] he said now don't that sound real good
[1:13:46] but watch what you're talking about when
[1:13:47] you say that
[1:13:49] he said see that you write it not he
[1:13:51] said these seven thunders uttered their
[1:13:53] voices see and
[1:13:54] he said don't write that but it's to be
[1:13:56] sealed up in the book until the last
[1:13:58] days
[1:14:00] he said now someone many has been saying
[1:14:01] to me and theologians said brother
[1:14:03] branham
[1:14:03] he said with the lord god with your
[1:14:05] experience that the lord has given you
[1:14:07] for his people
[1:14:08] humbly saying this said you would be
[1:14:10] eligible to write a bible yourself your
[1:14:12] word
[1:14:13] if god is manifested i said that might
[1:14:15] be true
[1:14:16] see he was trying to catch me i said but
[1:14:19] you see i couldn't do that
[1:14:21] he said why couldn't you you have all
[1:14:22] the qualifications
[1:14:24] i said but you look one word cannot be
[1:14:26] added or taken away
[1:14:29] right now you ladies know if you're go
[1:14:32] if you mix up a recipe and there's
[1:14:34] something in it there are ingredients
[1:14:36] you can leave
[1:14:37] out or change swap out right
[1:14:40] but there are essential ingredients
[1:14:43] that have to remain in the recipe and if
[1:14:46] they're not there the cake don't rise or
[1:14:48] it don't taste right you've got to have
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:53] there's essential ingredients for making
[1:14:56] it happen
[1:14:57] if you like to eat pancakes you need
[1:14:59] flour
[1:15:01] right and now i see where they make
[1:15:03] these low-carb pancakes i've been
[1:15:05] looking at those i'm afraid to try it
[1:15:07] because flour is kind of an essential
[1:15:09] ingredient
[1:15:12] right to a pancake
[1:15:15] right and and just like sausage is an
[1:15:18] essential ingredient to gravy
[1:15:21] now you may not agree with that but it
[1:15:23] is amen
[1:15:28] now so that's essentials there's things
[1:15:31] that maybe don't matter
[1:15:33] and brother branham talked about that he
[1:15:34] would come on a white horse or a white
[1:15:36] cloud and things like that there are
[1:15:37] things that don't matter
[1:15:38] but what the word says is essential
[1:15:42] and if those ingredients aren't there
[1:15:44] you can't you can't have a rapture
[1:15:47] right and so now brother branham says he
[1:15:49] talks about it he said
[1:15:51] you he said one word can be added or
[1:15:53] taken away he said well then the seven
[1:15:54] thunders you see
[1:15:55] wouldn't them seven thunders blasting
[1:15:57] out won't that be a revelation be given
[1:15:58] to some man
[1:16:00] i said no sir it would be adding
[1:16:01] something to it or taking something from
[1:16:02] it
[1:16:03] it's all revealed in there and the seven
[1:16:05] seals opened up the revelation
[1:16:07] of what that was amen
[1:16:11] he said that's what it was see it's
[1:16:13] still in the word you see you can't get
[1:16:15] out of that word
[1:16:16] it won't leave the word and god's spirit
[1:16:18] will never leave that word
[1:16:20] it'll stay right with the word he said
[1:16:23] blinding some and open the eyes of
[1:16:24] others shall always do that
[1:16:27] so again in the feast of the trumpets
[1:16:30] brother brown said he said
[1:16:31] that this and that day when he'd seen
[1:16:32] him come down and eat up the little book
[1:16:34] and he said he put one foot on land and
[1:16:35] one on the sea
[1:16:36] or by him that lives forever and ever
[1:16:38] the time shall be no more
[1:16:40] he did seven thunders under their voices
[1:16:42] when the seven thunders under their
[1:16:44] voices dawn said he was about to write
[1:16:45] he said don't write it
[1:16:46] he said and he sealed it he said now
[1:16:48] someone said well that's seven seals
[1:16:50] brother brandon that will be revealed in
[1:16:51] the last days some great mystery of how
[1:16:52] we get closer to god
[1:16:55] now look no sir it can't be
[1:17:00] it won't be the mystery of how we get
[1:17:02] closer to god won't be revealed
[1:17:04] by something outside the scriptures
[1:17:07] he says whoever whosoever shall take one
[1:17:10] word from this bible or add one word to
[1:17:11] it this part will be taken
[1:17:13] the book of life what it what it is is a
[1:17:15] revelation on what has been missed back
[1:17:17] there
[1:17:18] it's already wrote here it's in here
[1:17:20] it's to reveal what already has been
[1:17:22] written
[1:17:23] because you can't add one thing to it or
[1:17:26] take one word
[1:17:27] from it
[1:17:31] brother man was asked a question
[1:17:33] directly have the seven thunders which
[1:17:34] equals seven mysteries already been
[1:17:35] revealed were they revealed in the seven
[1:17:37] seals
[1:17:37] he said but are yet not known to us as
[1:17:39] the thunders yet so they said well maybe
[1:17:41] maybe it's just not known to us because
[1:17:42] people couldn't see it
[1:17:44] and brother ram said no they were
[1:17:45] revealed in the seven seals
[1:17:47] that's what the thunders was about the
[1:17:50] seven thunders
[1:17:50] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[1:17:52] that had uttered their voices no one
[1:17:53] could make out what it was
[1:17:54] john knew what it was but he was
[1:17:56] forbidden to write it he said but the
[1:17:57] seventh angel in the days of his
[1:17:59] sounding the seven mysteries of the
[1:18:00] seven thunders will be revealed
[1:18:02] and the seventh angel is the messenger
[1:18:03] of the seventh church age
[1:18:05] so the the mystery in it you look at it
[1:18:08] and think what do we know now that we
[1:18:09] didn't know before the seals were open
[1:18:12] we know what the mystery was right it
[1:18:14] was a white horse it was a red horse it
[1:18:16] was a black horse
[1:18:17] we didn't know what it meant what do we
[1:18:20] know now that we didn't know what would
[1:18:21] be sealed up and then revealed at the
[1:18:22] end
[1:18:23] what would those seven thunders say we
[1:18:25] know what we didn't know which is the
[1:18:26] mystery of it
[1:18:28] amen now he says
[1:18:32] in the church age book again i'll read
[1:18:35] this he said now this messenger of
[1:18:37] malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to
[1:18:38] do two things one
[1:18:40] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:18:42] hearts of the children to the fathers 2
[1:18:44] he will reveal the mysteries of the 7
[1:18:45] thunders in revelation 10
[1:18:47] which are the revelations contained in
[1:18:49] the seven seals
[1:18:51] now listen what he says it will be these
[1:18:53] divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:18:55] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:18:58] children
[1:18:59] to the pentecostal fathers
[1:19:03] so this
[1:19:07] i can't explain to you i can't
[1:19:08] overemphasize to you enough
[1:19:11] that when we don't feed on the word how
[1:19:13] can we ever come to this
[1:19:15] but we have to feed on that revealed
[1:19:17] word
[1:19:18] right because that's what's been given
[1:19:20] us in this hour and people say well you
[1:19:22] should preach this you should preach
[1:19:24] that
[1:19:24] but this is the word that's been
[1:19:25] revealed
[1:19:27] and so as you know you go on a baptist
[1:19:29] church you expect to hear baptist
[1:19:31] doctrine you go on a pentecostal church
[1:19:33] you expect
[1:19:33] your pentecostal doctrine but in a
[1:19:34] message church what do you hear
[1:19:37] well you should hear the message
[1:19:40] right the message and we shouldn't shy
[1:19:42] away from any of it
[1:19:44] if we don't understand it don't don't
[1:19:45] preach what you don't understand
[1:19:47] but there's so much we do understand
[1:19:49] there's so much that brother branham
[1:19:51] actually made clear
[1:19:52] amen now
[1:19:55] this is history and we've been over that
[1:19:58] brother man
[1:19:59] says that when he spoke is this sign of
[1:20:02] the answer he said was a prophecy
[1:20:04] he said and now this he said now it's
[1:20:07] history
[1:20:09] now it's history so you could
[1:20:12] you know if it's these divinely revealed
[1:20:14] truths
[1:20:16] that bring about the rapture why are we
[1:20:17] still here
[1:20:21] that's an honest question why are we
[1:20:22] still here
[1:20:24] well it has to be inspired to us
[1:20:29] and now i want us to look at enoch
[1:20:31] because enoch was our
[1:20:32] type and go to hebrews 11 5 again
[1:20:36] and you'll find that enoch was
[1:20:39] translated
[1:20:40] i love that word translated taken from
[1:20:43] one dimension to the other
[1:20:45] he was translated that he should not see
[1:20:48] death
[1:20:50] and was not found because god had
[1:20:53] translated him
[1:20:56] for before his translation he had this
[1:20:58] testimony
[1:20:59] that he pleased god in genesis 5 24 it
[1:21:02] tells us that enoch
[1:21:03] walked with god and he was not
[1:21:07] for god took him enoch walked
[1:21:10] now there was a time when he not just
[1:21:12] lived
[1:21:14] and then there'd come a time he knocked
[1:21:15] walk with god
[1:21:17] right and during that walk something
[1:21:20] happened
[1:21:21] during that time that brought him to
[1:21:24] a place where he could be raptured
[1:21:27] right what inspired enoch
[1:21:31] to walk with god so closely
[1:21:35] that one day he's just going about his
[1:21:37] everyday life
[1:21:39] and i believe that's how the rapture
[1:21:40] will happen by the way
[1:21:42] i think there's so much in the scripture
[1:21:43] to prove that
[1:21:45] that two will be grinding at the meal
[1:21:47] want to be taken to the other left
[1:21:49] two will be working in the field want to
[1:21:50] be taken the other left two will be in
[1:21:52] the bed want to be taken to the other
[1:21:53] left
[1:21:53] all around the world at the same time
[1:21:56] people will be changed want to be taken
[1:21:59] want to be left and
[1:22:00] and there will be there will be
[1:22:02] something that will take place
[1:22:04] that these people will be inspired to
[1:22:06] something during everyday life
[1:22:09] but see it it's not so much something
[1:22:11] and what people are looking for it said
[1:22:12] well all of a sudden i have such
[1:22:14] faith but see god's building that faith
[1:22:16] in you now
[1:22:18] and brother brahma i didn't bring the
[1:22:19] quote but brother branham talked about i
[1:22:21] think i read it here before
[1:22:22] he said how do you know that god has not
[1:22:24] already commanded
[1:22:26] someone he said an angel to come by your
[1:22:29] way and heal you
[1:22:32] how do you know that it's not already
[1:22:33] been commanded he said in today or
[1:22:36] tomorrow
[1:22:38] or at the next healing service whatever
[1:22:39] it was god's already commanded it to
[1:22:41] happen
[1:22:42] and he took that from where the ravens
[1:22:44] sped elijah and said god commanded the
[1:22:46] ravens to feed him
[1:22:47] god had already commanded it before
[1:22:49] elijah ever got to the brook
[1:22:51] before the widow before elijah ever got
[1:22:53] to the widow woman god had already
[1:22:54] commanded the widow and she didn't even
[1:22:56] know it
[1:22:58] she never even heard the message of
[1:23:00] elijah yet but she'd already been
[1:23:02] commanded
[1:23:03] to feed him
[1:23:06] and so enoch was just walking with god
[1:23:09] and then he was not because god took him
[1:23:12] but during this process in this time
[1:23:14] something happened something had to
[1:23:16] happen to change him from
[1:23:19] what he wants to rapture material
[1:23:25] now look in jude chapter 1 there's only
[1:23:27] one one
[1:23:28] chapter there jude 14 14.
[1:23:32] we find that enoch prophesied
[1:23:36] he had a message he understood something
[1:23:41] i hope you're with me today enoch
[1:23:44] understood something
[1:23:47] he didn't just you know and we take that
[1:23:48] enoch walk with god in a very literal
[1:23:50] sense so they say well
[1:23:51] you know walk with god he didn't lie he
[1:23:53] didn't steal
[1:23:54] he was perfect before god brother brown
[1:23:56] said those things he said that you know
[1:23:58] walked in such a way he never displeased
[1:23:59] god so that's part of it
[1:24:02] but look there has to be something that
[1:24:05] inspires beyond
[1:24:07] just a good life
[1:24:10] and it's one thing and and i believe
[1:24:12] that we it's essential you've heard me
[1:24:14] preach enough by now to know
[1:24:16] we have to have holiness among us we've
[1:24:19] got to live right
[1:24:21] we must live right but just living right
[1:24:24] it's not going to put you in a rapture
[1:24:27] because many people have lived right
[1:24:28] they didn't go but there's something
[1:24:30] special that happens to these at the end
[1:24:32] time
[1:24:33] and what was it to you know enoch the
[1:24:34] seventh from adam adam prophesied of
[1:24:36] these saying behold
[1:24:37] the lord cometh with ten thousand of his
[1:24:40] saints
[1:24:42] what revelation did enoch have what was
[1:24:44] his message
[1:24:46] amen the coming of the lord what was
[1:24:49] that what was the seventh seal it's the
[1:24:51] coming of the lord
[1:24:52] so you could say it this way enoch
[1:24:54] preached the seventh seal
[1:24:57] huh and under that inspiration
[1:25:00] i hope you're with me now he was the
[1:25:03] seventh from adam
[1:25:04] amed he said behold the lord cometh with
[1:25:07] ten thousand mistakes to execute
[1:25:08] judgment upon all
[1:25:09] to convince all that are ungodly among
[1:25:11] them of all their ungodly deeds which
[1:25:13] they have ungodly committed
[1:25:15] of all their hard speeches which ungodly
[1:25:17] sinners have spoken against him
[1:25:19] so now the first coming of christ
[1:25:23] and john wesley says this and i really
[1:25:25] love this statement he said the first
[1:25:26] coming of christ was revealed to adam
[1:25:28] but the second coming to enoch
[1:25:33] wesley could see this even living in
[1:25:34] that sixth age but he said the first
[1:25:36] coming
[1:25:37] was revealed to adam the second to enoch
[1:25:39] he said in the seventh from adam
[1:25:41] foretold the things which will conclude
[1:25:43] the seventh age of the world
[1:25:47] amen brother branham says it this way
[1:25:50] let's look you don't type the bride
[1:25:53] enough no one went over through the
[1:25:54] bride
[1:25:55] he went over through the tribulation
[1:25:56] period and suffered and become a drunk
[1:25:57] and died
[1:25:58] but you know walked before god for 500
[1:26:02] years
[1:26:04] and had a testimony he pleased god
[1:26:08] with rapturing faith
[1:26:11] amen how can you please god in this hour
[1:26:14] i hope you're with me now it's
[1:26:15] impossible to please god without faith
[1:26:18] how do you please god he pleased god
[1:26:20] with rapturing faith
[1:26:24] and i prayed so many times lord i want
[1:26:26] to please you with my life
[1:26:28] i want to please you with my life i want
[1:26:29] to please you with my conduct
[1:26:31] i want to please you with my finances i
[1:26:32] want to please you with the things that
[1:26:34] i do want to please you and my family i
[1:26:36] want to please you at the church
[1:26:37] we pray prayed that way i want to please
[1:26:40] you lord
[1:26:40] i want to please you in all the little
[1:26:42] things that i do that's my desires to
[1:26:44] please
[1:26:44] god if it wasn't i wouldn't be here but
[1:26:47] enoch pleased god with rapturing faith
[1:26:52] so my prayers become as as we mature as
[1:26:54] we come to this place and
[1:26:56] in the message of the hour our prayer
[1:26:58] has to become lord help me please you
[1:27:00] with rapturing faith not just to please
[1:27:04] god by living right not just to please
[1:27:05] god by doing all these other things
[1:27:06] but to please god with rapturing faith
[1:27:08] what is that as we said
[1:27:10] how can you have rapturing faith by
[1:27:11] rapturing grace
[1:27:13] and what is it it's in the atonement
[1:27:16] amen
[1:27:16] it's in the atonement brotherhood said
[1:27:18] you have to have a revelation to receive
[1:27:20] your healing
[1:27:20] you have to have a revelation that jesus
[1:27:22] what jesus did on the cross was for you
[1:27:25] that's how you're healed that's how
[1:27:26] you're saved and how are you raptured
[1:27:30] amen by faith that the rapture is for
[1:27:33] you
[1:27:35] how because of the atonement
[1:27:41] you realize that our age if we can say
[1:27:43] it that way
[1:27:44] i don't know when it'll happen but
[1:27:46] something happens in our time
[1:27:48] that will cause us to please god with
[1:27:50] rapturing faith
[1:27:53] then the hardships don't trouble us the
[1:27:56] worries don't trouble us
[1:27:58] people falling away on every side don't
[1:28:00] trouble the bride
[1:28:01] it doesn't get to the bride why because
[1:28:03] we know that we
[1:28:04] we're going to please god there's a
[1:28:07] people that are going to be on the earth
[1:28:09] legendary that'll please god with
[1:28:10] rapturing faith
[1:28:14] amen we're going to please god with
[1:28:16] rapturing faith
[1:28:17] then what do we do now we pray for
[1:28:19] healing because we believe that god who
[1:28:21] will
[1:28:22] provide rapturing faith who is provided
[1:28:24] that will provide the faith for healing
[1:28:26] it's under the same atonement
[1:28:28] these things have been provided for us
[1:28:30] so we could say that healing if healing
[1:28:31] is under the atonement
[1:28:32] and healing is a is a down payment on
[1:28:35] the resurrection then what is the
[1:28:36] resurrection under
[1:28:38] the atonement
[1:28:44] i'm so grateful for that that all i can
[1:28:48] do is just
[1:28:48] trust his grace and feed on the word
[1:28:54] and that takes some of the worry out of
[1:28:56] it because you know i could preach in
[1:28:58] such a way
[1:28:59] that would keep everybody in church and
[1:29:01] on the edge of their seats
[1:29:03] and maybe maybe i could preach in such a
[1:29:05] way that it would control your lives in
[1:29:07] some way that
[1:29:08] while i'm keeping you from going to the
[1:29:10] dances and
[1:29:12] i'm keeping you from going to the to the
[1:29:14] bars
[1:29:16] keeping you from wearing shorts and all
[1:29:18] these things that the world does i could
[1:29:20] preach in such a way to do that
[1:29:22] just by constantly reminding you and
[1:29:25] then enforcing that
[1:29:27] and making you feel bad about it that's
[1:29:30] not gonna put you in a rapture
[1:29:35] can i can i be honest with you and i'm
[1:29:37] closing in just a moment
[1:29:39] i've always wanted a place where we
[1:29:42] could just worship god
[1:29:45] and please god and feed on the word
[1:29:48] without without all this all these
[1:29:50] politics
[1:29:51] whether somebody goes to my church or
[1:29:53] somebody else's our church or someone
[1:29:55] else's church it doesn't matter
[1:29:57] we want to please god i've always wanted
[1:30:00] a place where we could come
[1:30:01] and we could just sit under the presence
[1:30:03] of god where we could have as we talked
[1:30:04] about the logos the word
[1:30:06] and the spirit together that we could
[1:30:07] come together and we could feel the
[1:30:08] moving of the spirit where the sick
[1:30:10] could be healed and the
[1:30:11] and those that are in the world that are
[1:30:13] lost could be saved
[1:30:16] i believe we're really close to that
[1:30:18] place today i believe we're really close
[1:30:20] why because god is wanting to bring
[1:30:23] about that rapturing faith
[1:30:28] amen listen
[1:30:31] he said he pleased god with rapturing
[1:30:33] faith and just started walking right out
[1:30:36] and went up through the skies how does
[1:30:37] he walk he walks in faith
[1:30:39] here comes coronavirus the lord's coming
[1:30:43] that's still his message
[1:30:48] here comes politics the lord's coming
[1:30:51] he walks with god he doesn't get wrapped
[1:30:53] up he doesn't get walk with the
[1:30:55] republicans of the democrats he walks
[1:30:57] with god
[1:30:59] the lord's coming here comes a doctrine
[1:31:00] here and a doctrine there the lord's
[1:31:02] coming
[1:31:03] he gets hurt because he's human of
[1:31:05] course he gets hurt
[1:31:07] but the lord's coming
[1:31:10] with ten thousand of his saints
[1:31:14] enoch walked before god he kept his
[1:31:16] testimony
[1:31:17] he walked before god he stayed in the
[1:31:19] message of the hour and every step that
[1:31:20] he took he pleased god
[1:31:22] because he walked by faith he just
[1:31:24] started walking right out went up to the
[1:31:26] skies
[1:31:26] and went home without even tasting death
[1:31:29] never died
[1:31:30] at all hebrews 11 6 but without faith it
[1:31:35] is impossible to please him
[1:31:37] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:31:38] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:31:41] them
[1:31:42] that diligently seek him now enoch
[1:31:45] reflected the word that he was inspired
[1:31:46] to and became that word
[1:31:47] brother branham said enoch was the
[1:31:49] living word of god of his age
[1:31:51] he was a prophet he said a prophet is
[1:31:53] god's reflector
[1:31:55] he said how many knows that the
[1:31:56] reflector doesn't reflect itself
[1:31:58] the reflector isn't a reflection there
[1:32:00] has to be something strike the reflector
[1:32:01] to make it reflect he said so a prophet
[1:32:04] is the chosen vessel of god
[1:32:06] that cannot reflect nothing at all but
[1:32:08] he's in direct line with that reflection
[1:32:11] god to reflect the image of christ the
[1:32:13] word
[1:32:14] sees that nothing else can do it you are
[1:32:16] a reflector
[1:32:18] he said that's the reason the prophet
[1:32:19] had to eat the book that's the reason he
[1:32:21] had to eat the scroll
[1:32:23] he had to reflect that word for that age
[1:32:26] amen so brother branham ties this in
[1:32:29] where a prophet would eat the book
[1:32:31] to enoch being a reflector of the word
[1:32:35] he said that's how you reflect the word
[1:32:37] is by eating the book amen
[1:32:41] he said notice enoch god's perfect
[1:32:43] reflector in type
[1:32:44] when god was through with him he just
[1:32:47] translated him
[1:32:48] took him up the mechanics that he had
[1:32:51] reflected
[1:32:52] become listen how will this happen
[1:32:55] remember i preached to you that the word
[1:32:56] and the spirit
[1:32:57] cannot be separated they cannot be
[1:33:00] separated don't let somebody tell you
[1:33:02] well
[1:33:02] it's all word or it's all it's it's
[1:33:04] together it's the same thing the logos
[1:33:06] was the spirit of god that moved on the
[1:33:07] face of the waters
[1:33:09] the word in the spirit is the same he
[1:33:11] said so the mechanics that he had
[1:33:13] reflected
[1:33:13] become dynamics amen
[1:33:18] the mechanics that he had reflected
[1:33:19] become dynamics with the spirit
[1:33:21] and took him up that's what we're
[1:33:24] waiting on today
[1:33:25] that's what we're here for today the
[1:33:27] mechanics that he had reflected
[1:33:28] become dynamics that's how you can
[1:33:30] receive your healing the mechanics that
[1:33:32] you reflected the mechanics when you
[1:33:33] begin to reflect that word back to god
[1:33:35] and say by his stripes i am healed all
[1:33:37] of a sudden the mechanics that you
[1:33:38] reflect
[1:33:39] become dynamics with the spirit and you
[1:33:41] receive your healing
[1:33:44] amen one day the rapture will be the
[1:33:47] same way
[1:33:48] revelations 10 i knew the voice which i
[1:33:50] heard from heaven speaking to me again
[1:33:51] and said go
[1:33:52] take the little book which is open the
[1:33:54] hand of the angel which stands upon the
[1:33:56] sea and upon the earth
[1:33:57] i went unto the angels and said to him
[1:33:59] give me the little book he said to me
[1:34:00] take it eat it up
[1:34:01] it shall make that belly bitter but it
[1:34:02] shall be in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:34:04] i took the little book out of the
[1:34:06] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[1:34:07] my mouth sweetest honey
[1:34:09] as soon as i had eaten it my belly was
[1:34:10] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:34:12] prophesy again
[1:34:13] before many peoples and nations and
[1:34:15] tongues and kings
[1:34:18] how did he get inspiration by eating the
[1:34:20] book
[1:34:22] how could he be inspired to prophesy
[1:34:24] again by eating the book the same way
[1:34:26] enoch did
[1:34:27] the same way john did amen how do you
[1:34:29] get inspiration for the rapture
[1:34:31] the same way that they did after the
[1:34:33] seven thunders have been revealed and
[1:34:35] they have
[1:34:36] i believe i can say that with full
[1:34:38] assurance that it had been revealed
[1:34:41] after they have been revealed eat the
[1:34:44] book
[1:34:47] hey bad
[1:34:50] listen what brother branham says and i'm
[1:34:51] closing musicians could come he said the
[1:34:53] first thing
[1:34:54] comes forth this is message calling the
[1:34:56] bride together
[1:34:58] the next thing is the resurrection of
[1:35:00] the sleeping bride he said the ones died
[1:35:02] back in the other ages are caught
[1:35:04] together
[1:35:04] he said in the trumpet the feasts and
[1:35:06] the heavens in the sky he said why
[1:35:08] that's the thing that takes place
[1:35:09] friends watch he said we're right there
[1:35:13] ready now the first thing was the
[1:35:17] message going to bride together
[1:35:19] the next was the resurrection of the
[1:35:20] sleeping bride and they're caught
[1:35:22] together in the trump and the feasts in
[1:35:23] the skies but we're right there ready
[1:35:25] now
[1:35:26] ready for what to be caught up he said
[1:35:29] the only thing
[1:35:30] the only thing the church coming out has
[1:35:33] got to lay before the sun
[1:35:36] to ripen
[1:35:39] sister sims reached her rightness
[1:35:43] she was done she went on
[1:35:46] others have said among you've reached
[1:35:48] their level of maturity
[1:35:49] they went up but we which are alive and
[1:35:54] remain
[1:35:56] we won't hinder those that are asleep
[1:35:58] but we'll be caught up together with
[1:36:00] them
[1:36:00] the dead in christ will rise first and
[1:36:02] we which are alive and remain will be
[1:36:04] caught up together with them to meet our
[1:36:05] lord in the air
[1:36:07] so he said comfort one another with
[1:36:09] these words
[1:36:11] amen brother brad said we're right there
[1:36:14] ready now
[1:36:15] the only thing the church coming out has
[1:36:16] got to lay before the sun to ripen the
[1:36:18] great combine will come by after a while
[1:36:20] the wheat will be burned the stalks but
[1:36:21] the grain will be gathered into its
[1:36:23] garner
[1:36:25] before service i had that song in my
[1:36:28] heart wins the faith if we could play
[1:36:29] that again and
[1:36:31] brother david saying this morning set
[1:36:35] your wings to the winds of faith
[1:36:39] i didn't know if we knew it well enough
[1:36:40] to sing it but you know
[1:36:44] the most striking lyric in this song is
[1:36:49] the power that makes it rises already
[1:36:52] in the skies
[1:36:56] it's already there it just takes
[1:36:58] inspiration
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:01] what did he say the spirit and the bride
[1:37:03] say come hey man
[1:37:06] both the bridegroom and the bride are
[1:37:08] saying come
[1:37:10] amen that's the inspiration that the
[1:37:13] bride has to have to speak
[1:37:15] and go home it's already there
[1:37:18] we're just waiting on the inspiration to
[1:37:21] reach that level
[1:37:23] say well what do i do in the meantime
[1:37:25] you lay before the sun
[1:37:27] eat the word become that word
[1:37:30] become that word let all the greenness
[1:37:32] get out of you maybe once you would have
[1:37:33] reacted in a certain way
[1:37:35] there was a time when we could react a
[1:37:37] certain way and get all offended over
[1:37:38] certain things not no more
[1:37:41] we don't have time for that we don't
[1:37:43] have time to pray play church politics
[1:37:46] there's too much going on in the world
[1:37:48] to fight and fuss with one another
[1:37:51] to fight and fuss with other churches
[1:37:52] there's too much going on
[1:37:56] to let little things get in the way
[1:37:59] satan will come in your mind make you
[1:38:01] think well it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:38:02] matter those demons have euphrates river
[1:38:04] it doesn't matter if i just do this it
[1:38:06] doesn't matter
[1:38:07] it's not worth it's not worth the
[1:38:09] greenness it's not worth it
[1:38:11] you've got to stay in the presence of
[1:38:13] the sun
[1:38:15] it's not worth it he'll make you think
[1:38:16] you love this or you love that or you
[1:38:18] love the other or he'll make you think
[1:38:19] you you'd be better off somewhere else
[1:38:21] you get discouraged you think well
[1:38:23] nobody cares about me nobody loves me
[1:38:24] but remember it's not worth it
[1:38:28] stay in his presence don't let
[1:38:30] coronavirus don't let anything else get
[1:38:32] you out
[1:38:33] from eating that word becoming that word
[1:38:36] because when you become the word to
[1:38:37] omnipotence mean when the inspired word
[1:38:40] of the rapture
[1:38:40] meets the inspired word in your heart
[1:38:42] we'll go home
