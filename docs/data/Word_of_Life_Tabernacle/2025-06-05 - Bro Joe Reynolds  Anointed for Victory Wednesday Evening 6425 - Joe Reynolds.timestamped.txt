[35:33] being here on a Wednesday night. I uh
[35:35] been just a little bit under the
[35:36] weather. In fact, I preached Sunday and
[35:40] I shouldn't have. I kind of kind of
[35:42] broke myself a little bit on a Sunday
[35:44] and been paying for it. But I've been to
[35:46] the doctor and they got me all fixed up.
[35:48] But I want to apologize for something. I
[35:51] made a couple of announcements Sunday
[35:52] morning. I butchered two different names
[35:55] and y'all know who you are. I apologize
[35:58] for that. I won't try to to restate the
[36:01] names tonight because just not been
[36:04] feeling good and and trying to do that,
[36:07] but I trust uh that somehow that the
[36:11] Lord managed to get through what was on
[36:13] my heart Sunday anyway despite the
[36:15] weakness of my body. But I sure do
[36:17] appreciate your the church and your
[36:19] patience. We went to the funeral for
[36:22] with for the Danny's sister uh Tuesday
[36:24] and I started coughing, had to leave and
[36:26] I felt really bad about that as well.
[36:28] But God knows those things that one
[36:30] thing I want to be is here for you all
[36:32] and and uh we want to do that all the
[36:35] time. But sometimes in my zeal I push
[36:38] myself a little bit too much and then
[36:40] then I have to pull back. But uh y'all
[36:42] pray for me that I'll have more wisdom
[36:44] in the future in that in that way. Amen.
[36:46] I ask brother Joe Reynolds to come.
[36:48] Brother Joe's been such a good friend. I
[36:51] uh over the years, Brother Joe's always
[36:54] kept in touch with me for years going
[36:56] back before I was a pastor and he's
[36:59] always texted me and called me and I
[37:01] appreciate that as a friend. And he's
[37:03] always done that. And so we had talked
[37:05] here recently and I thought, well, I
[37:07] want to have brother Joe over to preach.
[37:09] And so not being able to preach tonight,
[37:11] I thought it'd be a good opportunity to
[37:12] have him. And I'm going to back the word
[37:14] tonight and just say, Lord, you've got
[37:17] something for me tonight. Amen. God
[37:20] bless you. As brother Joe comes, let's
[37:22] let's just sing that again. This is your
[37:23] house. Father, come and dwell. Brother
[37:26] Joel, if you could help me now. This is
[37:28] your house. Thank you, Lord. Father,
[37:32] come and dwell.

[37:44] prayer where the lost and the
[37:48] lonely bring their burdens and their
[37:52] cares. This is your
[37:56] house. This is your
[38:00] house. Come and dwell. Sing it again.
[38:05] Oh, this is your house.

[39:00] he uh he has been a friend to me as
[39:02] well. and always look forward to coming
[39:05] and spending some time, not only
[39:07] ministering, but coming and joining our
[39:09] legs of fire together. And God's good to
[39:11] us. No matter what we go through in
[39:13] time, God's still good to us. Amen. He's
[39:16] an everpresent help in a time of
[39:19] trouble. Do you love the Lord tonight?
[39:21] Amen. If you got your Bibles, while
[39:24] you're
[39:27] standing, we invite you to
[39:31] Hebrews chapter
[39:37] 6 verse 13.
[39:49] Hebrews chapter
[39:52] 6:13 says, "For when God made a promise
[39:55] through Abraham, because he could swear
[39:57] by no greater, he swore by himself,
[40:01] saying, Surely, blessing, I will bless
[40:03] thee. Multiply and I'll multiply thee."
[40:06] And so, after he had patiently endured,
[40:09] he obtained the promise. For men
[40:11] verilely swore by a greater an oath, for
[40:14] the confirmation is to them a end of all
[40:18] strife,
[40:20] wherein God will more abundantly show
[40:22] unto the heirs of his promise and
[40:25] nobility of his counsel, he confirmed it
[40:28] by an oath, that by two immutable
[40:30] things, it's which it was impossible God
[40:32] to lie, we might have a strong
[40:35] consolation, who have fled for refuge to
[40:37] lay a hold upon a hope that is set
[40:39] before us. Can you say praise the Lord?
[40:43] Which hope we have as a anchor of the
[40:45] soul both sure and steadfast and which
[40:49] entered into within the veil whether the
[40:52] forerunner is for us to enter even Jesus
[40:54] made an high priest forever after the
[40:57] order of
[40:59] Melchazdc. Amen. Can we just bow our
[41:01] hearts one more time tonight? Lord
[41:03] Jesus. Lord, we thank you, Lord, for
[41:05] this time that you've given us, Lord, to
[41:07] come and worship you tonight in spirit
[41:10] and in truth. Father, Lord, we pray,
[41:13] Lord, that you'll come in a special way
[41:15] tonight. Anoint us aresh, Lord. Anoint
[41:18] our hearts, Lord. Anoint our spirits,
[41:20] Lord God. Lord, I know you'll come down
[41:23] in a special way and inhabit our praise
[41:26] tonight. Lord, take these words, Lord,
[41:29] tonight, the thoughts, Lord God, and
[41:31] drop it to the hearts of your believers
[41:33] tonight, Lord. I believe this is a
[41:35] predestinated moment of time, Lord, that
[41:38] you've given us on this side of glory
[41:39] that we can worship tonight, Lord. I
[41:42] pray, Lord, we wouldn't take it for
[41:43] granted, Lord God, that we would just,
[41:45] Lord, just pull with all of our hearts,
[41:48] Lord, for more of you, Lord. Lord, we
[41:51] commit this service into your hands
[41:53] tonight, Lord, to have your way. We ask
[41:55] in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen.
[41:58] Can you you can have your seats tonight.
[42:01] Is everyone happy tonight? It's always
[42:04] good to be in the house of the Lord,
[42:06] isn't it? God's surely faithful. Amen. I
[42:09] heard brother Donnie Reagan say u I
[42:12] believe it was brother Donnie or brother
[42:13] Tim one of our meetings recently and u
[42:16] he was saying you know we don't come to
[42:17] get entertained. We come to entertain
[42:19] the Lord. And and I hope that's what you
[42:21] come to do tonight is entertain the
[42:23] Lord. And Amen. And I know he's worthy
[42:25] of all of our praise and he's worthy of
[42:28] all everything that we can give him
[42:30] tonight. I'm going to take this jacket
[42:32] off. It's already warm.
[42:34] Can't hardly fight with it anyhow, can
[42:36] we, brother Ben? Hallelujah. Well, we'd
[42:39] like to take a thought tonight. We've
[42:40] been ministering at home some on
[42:42] anointed for victory and uh been looking
[42:46] at things for the last couple days since
[42:48] brother Ben invited us to come. But we
[42:51] like to take for a text tonight under
[42:53] the same sworn
[42:55] promise. We realize tonight that God
[42:59] found you worthy. And I and I I wouldn't
[43:02] take that for granted tonight. I mean,
[43:04] men can give it up on you. Churches
[43:06] could give it up can give up on you.
[43:09] Amen. But God found you worthy. And
[43:12] there's nothing can ever erase that.
[43:15] Amen. Nothing in time could ever happen
[43:18] to cause you to lose it. Amen. You can't
[43:21] lose your sunship. If you're a son,
[43:24] you're always a son. Amen. You cannot
[43:26] lose your inheritance.
[43:29] Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for that
[43:30] tonight?
[43:32] Let's look at Exodus chapter 23 for a
[43:35] moment. Verse
[43:37] 30. It says, "By little and little, I'll
[43:41] dry them out before thee."
[43:44] In other words, I know it may look
[43:46] impossible, but I'm going to make a way
[43:48] through it. How many serves a God like
[43:50] that until thou be increased or made
[43:55] greater? Increase just simply, you've
[43:58] been made greater. It's not a question.
[44:01] In other words, I give you the land.
[44:03] It's yours. You're anointed for such a
[44:05] time as this. So, in other words,
[44:08] somebody's going to be anointed.
[44:10] Somebody's going to be increased. And
[44:12] somebody's going to take the land. Amen.
[44:15] It goes on, if you'll be increased and
[44:17] inherit the land, and I will set thy
[44:20] bounds for the Red Sea and to the sea of
[44:22] Philistines from the desert unto the
[44:25] river. For I will deliver the habitants
[44:27] of the land into your hands, and thou
[44:30] shalt drive them out before thee
[44:33] regardless of circumstances. Look, he
[44:36] told Abraham, "Thy seed shall possess
[44:39] the gates of his enemy." And brother
[44:42] Brown told us that that that's God's
[44:45] sworn promise. And he told us it's just
[44:48] like for you and I, we take on Abraham's
[44:51] seed and we're an heir with him. Can you
[44:54] say amen? He said, "Under the same sworn
[44:59] promise." So church, what that should do
[45:01] to a believer tonight as he told
[45:04] Abraham, "Look to the north and south
[45:06] and east and west." He said, "It's all
[45:09] yours." Amen. Regardless of
[45:11] circumstances, Amen. Abraham was growing
[45:14] well stricken in age. His sweetheart,
[45:17] Amen, wasn't getting no younger either.
[45:20] Amen. Time was taking a toll on their
[45:22] bodies. Amen. But brother Joel, nothing
[45:24] could change the fact, Amen. that God
[45:27] gave him a promise and God is a keeper
[45:30] of his promise. Amen. Abraham no matter
[45:33] what happened, he brought forth a son.
[45:36] Amen. He even Amen. He he tried to go in
[45:39] on his own ability, you know, and he
[45:41] produced a Hagar and he he he produced
[45:44] rather a wild man and
[45:47] a but God wasn't done with him yet. And
[45:50] I thank God that we serve a God like
[45:53] that tonight. Amen. Even though in our
[45:55] mistakes, even in our failures, even our
[45:58] our wrongdoings, even in our
[46:00] shortcomings, God ain't done with us.
[46:03] Amen. Ain't you thankful for that?
[46:05] People can give up on you. Churches can
[46:07] give on you. People can give up on you.
[46:10] Oh, but God rich in mercy can never give
[46:13] up on you.
[46:15] Regardless of circumstances, thy seed
[46:18] shall possess the gates of his enemy.
[46:22] Can you say amen? Deuteronomy 11:22
[46:26] says, "For it shall diligently keep all
[46:28] the commandments which I have commanded
[46:30] you to do of them, to love the God to
[46:34] love the Lord your God, to walk in all
[46:36] of his ways, and to cleave unto him,
[46:40] then you then will the Lord drive out
[46:43] all the nations from before you, and you
[46:46] shall possess greater nations that and
[46:48] mightier than yourselves, every place."
[46:52] Can you define that for me tonight?
[46:54] Every place, every place. Can you say it
[46:57] with me tonight? Where on the souls of
[47:01] of your feet shall tread shall be yours.
[47:05] From the wilderness of Lebanon, the
[47:07] river, the river Euphrates, even unto
[47:09] the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
[47:12] Listen now. He says, "There shall no man
[47:14] be able to stand before you. For the
[47:17] Lord your God shall lay the fear of you,
[47:20] and the dread of you upon the land that
[47:22] you shall tread upon, and he has said it
[47:24] unto you. He shall possess the gates of
[47:29] his enemy. Brother Brown said, just take
[47:32] it. He shall possess the gates of his
[47:35] enemy. In the church of the living God
[47:38] this morning lays the power to heal all
[47:41] sickness. Can you say amen? Can we say
[47:44] that tonight? In this tabernacle tonight
[47:47] lays the power to heal all sickness.
[47:50] He said it lays the in the church of
[47:53] living God lays power to overcome all
[47:56] temptation.
[47:58] In the possession of the church of the
[48:00] living God this morning lays the power
[48:03] to change sin and throw it away.
[48:07] Amen. He shall possess the gates of his
[48:11] enemy. And you're anointed for such a
[48:15] time as this. He says that's the way it
[48:18] is today. Everywhere the souls your feet
[48:22] sets is possession. He said just keep
[48:26] walking. Footprints means possession.
[48:29] Just take it. Look right north, south,
[48:33] east, and west of his promises is yours.
[48:39] Footprints means possession. It means
[48:42] authority. It means you have the rights.
[48:45] You're greater than this. You will be
[48:48] increased. You're greater. You're going
[48:50] to inherit the land. Amen. So he said
[48:54] footprints is possessions and possession
[48:58] is ownership.
[49:00] Come on. It's authority. You're an heir
[49:04] to all
[49:05] things. Not just one thing. All things.
[49:09] Everything is under your feet. Even
[49:13] death is under your feet. The grave is
[49:16] under your feet. Hell is under your
[49:18] feet. Sin is under your feet. Everything
[49:21] is under your feet tonight, church.
[49:24] Under the same sworn promises. Amen.
[49:27] Everything is under your feet if you're
[49:30] a believer. if you're buried in Christ
[49:33] Jesus. And brother Brown would say it
[49:34] like this. Well, we I'm I'm a nobody.
[49:38] I'm the least one. He says, "See, that's
[49:41] still the souls of his feet." He said,
[49:44] "But remember, he triumphant with you.
[49:47] He triumphant over every bit of it. Even
[49:51] you are the souls of his feet. Every
[49:54] sickness, every devil, every power,
[49:58] every death itself is under your feet.
[50:01] It's under you tonight, church.
[50:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Even if you're the
[50:08] weakest one among us, amen. If you're a
[50:10] believer tonight, amen. You got the
[50:13] weapon the hell can't handle tonight.
[50:15] You're made out of stuff that just can't
[50:17] be bluffed. Amen. So, it meant
[50:20] something.
[50:21] This wasn't just a statement that he was
[50:23] inserting in the Bible. Amen. He said,
[50:26] "Everywhere the your feet
[50:29] where you take possession of, it's going
[50:31] to be your land. I'm going to drive them
[50:34] out. I'm going to put fear before you."
[50:37] Amen. But I'm going to equip you. I'm
[50:39] going to empower you. I'm going to cause
[50:42] you to be increased greater than your
[50:45] opposition or your giants.
[50:48] It meant something.
[50:50] It meant something to take possession.
[50:54] It meant something to take a step of
[50:57] faith. It meant something to walk in
[50:59] your inheritance. It meant something.
[51:02] Amen. To take a step of faith in the
[51:04] message of the hour. Amen. It shows
[51:07] ownership. It shows that you're above
[51:09] it. You're greater than it is.
[51:13] Hallelujah. You say, "Brother Joe, my my
[51:16] situation's bad." Amen. You're greater
[51:18] than it is. Come on. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:22] David, Amen. through his anointing was
[51:24] greater than the Goliath. Amen. Shamgar
[51:28] was greater than his opposition. Amen.
[51:30] The three children was greater. Amen.
[51:33] Than the fire.
[51:36] Hallelujah. They was anointed to possess
[51:38] the fire. There was a day and age that
[51:42] they was living in.
[51:44] Hallelujah.
[51:46] We can remember a time in the Bible
[51:49] where Jesus sent his disciples
[51:51] away and they was out in the ship and
[51:55] they felt all alone. Didn't feel like
[51:58] there was no help. They didn't feel like
[52:00] there was no way of escape, brother
[52:02] Dave. They just simply thought it was
[52:03] their end. But in the darkest time of
[52:07] his life, are you feeling me tonight?
[52:09] Amen. in the darkest hour of your life.
[52:13] He said the very waves, brother Bam said
[52:16] the waves. Satan got into the waves.
[52:20] Amen. And they begin to torment the very
[52:22] waves that was trying to destroy them.
[52:27] Hallelujah. So, Brother Danny, we find
[52:29] Jesus came walking on the very thing
[52:33] that was trying to destroy them. That's
[52:36] my God tonight. Amen. And it was telling
[52:39] the disciples, "I'm greater than your
[52:42] trouble." Oh, I say the same God here
[52:45] tonight. He's bigger than our problems.
[52:48] He's bigger than our situations.
[52:52] It was showing ownership.
[52:55] It is showing the authority that God had
[52:59] over their storm.
[53:03] And he invited Peter Peter to walk on
[53:06] it.
[53:07] That's right. Come on.
[53:11] Walk on your battle. Walk on top of your
[53:14] storm.
[53:16] He saw Jesus, but it wasn't just good
[53:18] enough. Is somebody with me tonight?
[53:21] Amen. Jesus is wanting you, Amen, to
[53:24] take a step of faith. Amen. Cuz
[53:27] footsteps is possessions. You're
[53:29] anointed for victory tonight.
[53:33] That's good.
[53:35] Amen.
[53:39] and allow that storm become your
[53:41] foottool.
[53:45] The ancient of days, that's how two
[53:47] nations went to battle. The defeated
[53:50] king, they would bring the defeated king
[53:52] of that country in defeat before the
[53:55] reigning king.
[53:56] the reigning king would take his feet
[53:58] and put it on the backs of the defeated
[54:01] king to tell everybody out there, amen,
[54:04] that we have won the battle. The battle
[54:07] is over and the victory has been won.
[54:11] Amen. It showed victory. It showed
[54:14] ownership. It showed authority. Thank
[54:17] you, Lord. Hallelujah. It was a sign of
[54:20] victory.
[54:24] Not only was it a military victory, but
[54:27] it was complete, absolute, complete
[54:30] control over their adversary.
[54:33] Hallelujah. That's right. Footsteps is
[54:38] possession. You're going to inherit the
[54:41] land. You're going to be increased and
[54:45] you're going to inherit the land.
[54:48] Hallelujah. You're going to be greater
[54:50] than your Jericho. You're going to be
[54:52] greater than Eglon. You're going to be
[54:54] greater than those five kings. You're
[54:56] going to be greater than Jordan.
[55:00] Hallelujah. As you come to it, because
[55:02] brother would make a statement, amen,
[55:05] nothing could stand in the way of a
[55:07] believer going to meet the promises of
[55:10] God.
[55:12] He told us, but but you'll have an
[55:14] uncction from the Holy One.
[55:17] You'll have some dynamite down inside of
[55:20] your soul. When the soul is the spirit's
[55:23] ready to quit and the flesh is ready to
[55:25] give up, there is something that is
[55:27] inside of you sealed to the day of your
[55:31] redemption. Yes, sir. Amen. It's an
[55:34] uncction. It's anointed to blow up
[55:38] everything that's unlike him.
[55:41] It's to make it light up.
[55:44] Brother say you take two pieces and you
[55:46] take a dynamo. Amen. You turn you you
[55:50] begin to turn together as one unit. He
[55:53] said it'll make light. It'll make light.
[55:56] It'll make power. It'll make healing. He
[56:00] said when a believer and God gets
[56:02] turning together, it generates the power
[56:05] of his
[56:06] resurrection. Oh, the it's the power of
[56:09] this revival. Greater is he that is in
[56:13] you than the he that's in the world. Are
[56:16] you with me tonight? The flesh may get
[56:19] down and weak and weary and the spirit
[56:21] wounded, but down inside of a believer's
[56:25] heart is a power that generates the
[56:28] resurrection out of the past, out of
[56:31] your feelings, out of your darkness, out
[56:33] of your graves. Hey, but we're serving a
[56:36] God of resurrection. A God of
[56:38] restoration.
[56:40] [Music]
[56:42] Amen. And a beauty of brother Joey said,
[56:45] "I'll never leave you."
[56:49] I'm going to be with you. I'm going to
[56:51] follow you. I'm going to pursue after
[56:53] you. You may be ready to give up, but
[56:56] God's going to follow you. He's not
[56:59] going to leave you alone.
[57:02] How many's thankful for that? Brother
[57:03] Ram said, "I would have let go a long
[57:05] time ago, but it wasn't me holding him.
[57:07] It was him holding me." I say the anchor
[57:10] is sure, steadfast.
[57:14] Hallelujah.
[57:15] Listen to this. In the light of that, he
[57:17] says, "And your own glorified body is
[57:20] standing near you right now in Christ
[57:24] Jesus to give you a strength like a
[57:27] charge going into a battery. This flesh
[57:30] body
[57:32] battered ups and downs, good days, bad
[57:35] days. Hallelujah. this battery gets gets
[57:39] weak. It gets weary. It gets sick.
[57:45] But in the light of all of that, church,
[57:48] there's brother Brown would make a
[57:50] statement, your glorified body standing
[57:52] right near you right now in Christ Jesus
[57:56] to give you a charge like a charge going
[57:59] into a battery. Amen. What is he saying?
[58:02] Your body's going to get weak, but the
[58:05] greater is within you. Amen. And when
[58:08] you're ready to give up, he's going to
[58:11] come walking on the very storm that try
[58:14] to destroy you. Thank you, Lord.
[58:17] Hallelujah. Cuz that's the way my God
[58:19] is. Amen. This body gets weak. Amen.
[58:23] There's a there's somebody on the inside
[58:26] of you. There's anointing on the inside
[58:29] of you. Amen.
[58:31] begins to electrify.
[58:35] It's already kicked hell out. It's
[58:38] already kicked the devil out.
[58:42] And no matter what happens, Sister
[58:44] Carla, around us,
[58:47] that supernatural strength is with you
[58:50] wherever you go. You can be in the back
[58:54] parts of Africa somewhere. You can be
[58:57] like Congress upshaw. A I believe it was
[59:00] or no it was uh uh who was it overseas
[59:04] that fell
[59:05] stricken and brother
[59:08] Bossworth. Amen. And I knew I'd have a
[59:12] little fog there. It might be You might
[59:13] have left it up here,
[59:16] brother. There goes my bad names
[59:18] tonight.
[59:21] But he was so mindful of him that before
[59:24] he sent the telegram
[59:28] to brother Brandham. Brother Brandham
[59:30] already had a vision. Amen. And already
[59:34] said a prayer for him. Amen. And brother
[59:36] Brandham said the age of the Lord beat
[59:38] the telegram back to him. I say God's in
[59:42] our has been in our past. He's working
[59:45] in our future. He's living in our
[59:48] present. He's Jesus Christ the same
[59:51] yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:54] He said it's like a charge going into a
[59:57] battery.
[59:59] The Holy Spirit is in
[1:00:02] you. It's to charge your body, to give
[1:00:06] you a new strength, to heal you from
[1:00:09] your sickness that you got to make you
[1:00:12] well. I say you can't escape the
[1:00:15] blessing tonight.
[1:00:17] Now the stabilizers he said he's talking
[1:00:19] about within you. There's a great power
[1:00:22] of this revival that is within you is
[1:00:25] greater than we are.
[1:00:28] Amen. How many's got the revival within
[1:00:31] you? Can you be like the the the
[1:00:35] policeman said, "Where is the Welsh
[1:00:36] revival?" He said, "You're standing in
[1:00:38] his presence.
[1:00:40] I am the Welsh revival." Doesn't matter
[1:00:43] what you're going through. Amen. You are
[1:00:46] what you are by the grace of God
[1:00:47] tonight.
[1:00:49] He says, "Now the state layer has been
[1:00:51] put in in on the ship." He said, "These
[1:00:54] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:00:56] us." But we know, how many knows with
[1:00:59] me? But we know just beyond the wave
[1:01:01] yonder. We're nearing the shore. When
[1:01:04] the waves get greater, it's only an
[1:01:06] indication. We just got a few more days
[1:01:08] of labor.
[1:01:10] Hallelujah. We're nearing the shore.
[1:01:12] Just stay stable.
[1:01:17] Just stay. Can we have some stable
[1:01:19] Christians? Is that why the pastors uh
[1:01:22] uh that's your desire tonight? Just to
[1:01:25] have stable sons and daughters of God.
[1:01:28] When the storm is a raging, they're
[1:01:30] still there. When the hot and heavy,
[1:01:33] Satan's on the trail. Amen. They're
[1:01:35] still in the house of God lifting their
[1:01:37] hands, stomping their feet, placing a
[1:01:40] devil where he belongs, fighting with
[1:01:42] our brother. Not against our brother,
[1:01:44] but with our brother.
[1:01:47] It's a stabilizer. Just stay stable.
[1:01:50] Just stay in the word. Just stay with
[1:01:53] God. No matter how you feel. Can I have
[1:01:57] an amen there? No matter how you feel,
[1:02:00] what anyone else has to say about it.
[1:02:04] He says, just stay stable when you see
[1:02:08] all these great big old clouds around us
[1:02:11] and the storms are coming and the atomic
[1:02:14] bombs, everything else they're taking
[1:02:17] talking about. But our
[1:02:19] stabilizer, our stabilizer right
[1:02:21] straight in the word of God. God said it
[1:02:24] would be here. He said, "We'll crest
[1:02:27] every one of them."
[1:02:29] He said, "Yeah, we'll go right over the
[1:02:31] top of them." Yes, indeed. They can't
[1:02:34] sink us. They can't sink us. Amen. No
[1:02:38] matter, brother Harvey, no matter what
[1:02:39] you're going through tonight, it can't
[1:02:41] sink you. Amen. Satan can't destroy you.
[1:02:48] Hallelujah. We may get knocked down, but
[1:02:51] we're going to get stand right back
[1:02:53] up. Yes, sir. Why? Because down inside
[1:02:56] of you is a stabilizer.
[1:02:59] No matter how hard the wind blows, you
[1:03:02] just get right back up, young kids. No
[1:03:04] matter what hell tries to throw your
[1:03:06] way, you still stand right back up. Do
[1:03:09] you see them tonight? Look around you.
[1:03:11] The hounds of hell has been following
[1:03:13] you. Brother B said, when you receive
[1:03:15] the Holy Ghost, every gun of hell is
[1:03:17] pointing at you. Hell is on your trail
[1:03:21] tonight.
[1:03:23] But here you are on a Wednesday night.
[1:03:25] Here you are on a Wednesday night. Satan
[1:03:28] thought he had you. But here you are
[1:03:30] praising your king,
[1:03:32] shouting for joy, singing the songs of
[1:03:35] Zion.
[1:03:37] Oh, Satan throwed his hardest punch at
[1:03:39] you maybe this week. He's tried to hit
[1:03:41] you with financial problems. He tried to
[1:03:43] hit you with sickness. He's tried to hit
[1:03:46] you with depression.
[1:03:47] Oh, but when it comes around to it,
[1:03:50] amen, early in the morning, you rise up
[1:03:52] and begin to read your Bible. You begin
[1:03:55] to meditate on the Lord. Amen. You show
[1:03:57] up on a Wednesday night. Amen. What it
[1:03:59] is that we're serving our God. Amen.
[1:04:02] We're serving the King of Kings and the
[1:04:05] Lord of Lords. Amen. We fall short many
[1:04:08] times. Hey, let me tell you something.
[1:04:10] If you're a believer, Satan's going to
[1:04:12] punch at you, brother. Said it like
[1:04:14] this. He'll knock at your He'll He'll
[1:04:17] knock at your door, h at your window.
[1:04:19] Amen. He'll try to do everything he he
[1:04:22] can to discourage you.
[1:04:25] But the beauty of it, every time you get
[1:04:28] knocked down, brother said it can't sink
[1:04:30] your ship.
[1:04:34] Reminds me when we was a kid, we get
[1:04:37] these blow
[1:04:39] up boxing
[1:04:45] You always blow it up and and have a
[1:04:48] character on it. We'll take off. Brother
[1:04:49] David, you remember those? Amen. I don't
[1:04:52] even know if they have one today, but
[1:04:53] they had a stabilizer in it. Brother
[1:04:55] Herald, you can take off hard as you
[1:04:57] want. Go punch that punching bag. Amen.
[1:05:00] And it'll go and hit the ground, it'll
[1:05:02] stand right back
[1:05:04] up. No matter how hard you begin to
[1:05:06] punch you. Amen. Listen, brothers and
[1:05:09] sisters. how hard hell tries to punch
[1:05:12] you and try. You don't need to praise
[1:05:14] God. You don't need to shout for joy. I
[1:05:17] say let's positionally place that devil
[1:05:19] here tonight. Amen. You're going to
[1:05:21] stand right back up.
[1:05:23] Hallelujah. Because it's not you, it's
[1:05:26] him. He's greater than your problems.
[1:05:29] He's greater than your storm. He's
[1:05:31] bigger than your waves.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah. And no matter how hard you
[1:05:36] get hit,
[1:05:39] oh hallelujah tonight. Amen. No matter
[1:05:43] how hard you get hit, you stand right
[1:05:46] back up.
[1:05:48] Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:50] Wonderful.
[1:05:53] Peter said, "Oh, if that be you,
[1:05:55] Lord, bid me to come walking on my
[1:05:59] giant. Oh, can we be that? Can we be him
[1:06:02] tonight, Lord? If that be you speaking
[1:06:05] to me tonight. Oh, bid me to come. Let
[1:06:09] me walk on my giant. Yes, sir. I say you
[1:06:12] can walk on him tonight.
[1:06:15] We could have a Jericho march around our
[1:06:17] battle tonight. I say God's bigger than
[1:06:20] our situation.
[1:06:23] No matter how hard you get hit,
[1:06:26] Brother Brown said, "Yes, indeed. They
[1:06:28] can't sink us."
[1:06:30] Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] Ezekiel
[1:06:36] 37 familiar
[1:06:38] scripture says, "The hand of the Lord
[1:06:40] was upon me and carried me out in the
[1:06:42] spirit of the Lord and set me down in
[1:06:44] the midst of a valley which was full of
[1:06:47] bones. And he called me to pass about
[1:06:49] around. And behold, there were very many
[1:06:52] in the open valley. Lo, they were very
[1:06:55] dry. It was dry. No hope.
[1:07:00] didn't look like, brother David didn't
[1:07:01] look like there could be no revival.
[1:07:06] Maybe it looked like Lazarus when he was
[1:07:08] laid in a tomb. Looked like there was
[1:07:10] grave clothes wrapped around him. Looked
[1:07:12] like there was no hope inside. And he
[1:07:16] said unto me, "Son of man, can these
[1:07:18] bones live?" And I answered, "Oh Lord
[1:07:22] God, thou knowest?"
[1:07:25] He may be four days late,
[1:07:28] but he's always right on time.
[1:07:31] You can't escape the blessing tonight.
[1:07:37] Where when Jesus came, he took a
[1:07:40] situation under control. And he said,
[1:07:44] Lazarus,
[1:07:45] thank you, Lord. Come
[1:07:48] forth. Lazarus couldn't escape the
[1:07:50] blessing.
[1:07:52] Come on. The world may have given up on
[1:07:54] you. Church family might have gave up on
[1:07:56] you. But God is a God of restoration.
[1:08:00] He's a God of restoring back.
[1:08:05] And again, he said unto me, prophesy
[1:08:07] upon these bones. And I say unto him,
[1:08:10] all you dry bones, hear the word of the
[1:08:12] Lord.
[1:08:14] You may seem hopeless. You may seem dry,
[1:08:16] but hear the word of the Lord. Thus
[1:08:20] sayith the Lord God unto these bones.
[1:08:23] Behold, I will cause breath to enter
[1:08:25] into you, and you shall live. You shall
[1:08:28] be quickened. You should be made alive.
[1:08:32] And I will lay senus upon you and will
[1:08:35] bring up flesh upon you and cover you up
[1:08:37] with skin and put breath in you and you
[1:08:40] shall live and you shall know that I am
[1:08:43] the
[1:08:44] Lord. I will give you the ability to
[1:08:46] become what you once was. So I
[1:08:49] prophesied as I commanded and I
[1:08:52] prophesied and there was a noise and
[1:08:54] behold shaken and bones came together
[1:08:58] bone to his bone. There was some noise
[1:09:01] of praise. There was some noise of
[1:09:05] worship. And when behold I lay senus and
[1:09:09] flesh came upon them and skin covered
[1:09:12] them above but there was no breath in
[1:09:14] them. All this Asia we're living in, no
[1:09:17] doubt, blindness, nakedness, driedness.
[1:09:20] But in the midst of all this dryness,
[1:09:23] can these bones live
[1:09:25] again? Then he said unto me, prophesy
[1:09:28] unto the wind. Prophesy, son of man. Say
[1:09:32] to the wind, thus sayith the Lord God,
[1:09:34] come from the four winds, O breath,
[1:09:36] breathe upon these slain, that they may
[1:09:38] live. So I prophesied and commanded me
[1:09:41] and breath came into them and they lived
[1:09:43] and they stood upon their feet as an
[1:09:46] exceeding great army. Oh, they couldn't
[1:09:48] escape it. Then he said unto me, son of
[1:09:50] man, these bones are the whole house of
[1:09:53] Israel. Behold, they say, our bones are
[1:09:56] dried and our hope is lost and were cut
[1:10:00] off from our parts. Therefore prophesy
[1:10:03] and say to them, thus saith the Lord,
[1:10:07] behold, oh my people, I will open up
[1:10:12] your graves, and I'll cause you to come
[1:10:15] up out of your graves, cuz I'm the God
[1:10:17] of resurrection. I'll bring you into the
[1:10:21] land of Israel, and you shall know that
[1:10:25] I am the Lord when I open your graves.
[1:10:27] Can you say amen to that? Amen. How many
[1:10:30] have has God opened up your
[1:10:33] graves? Oh my people I brought you up
[1:10:36] out of your graves and shall put my
[1:10:38] spirit in you and you shall live and I
[1:10:42] shall place in you in your own land.
[1:10:45] Then you shall know that I the Lord have
[1:10:47] spoken and performed it sayeth the Lord.
[1:10:50] Hear you, oh dry bones. Come on, the
[1:10:55] word of the Lord. skin come come upon
[1:10:59] them. Brother Bram says and they stood
[1:11:01] up as a mighty army and begin to march
[1:11:06] towards Zion. Glory to God. He said
[1:11:10] that's him. That's him. He says there's
[1:11:13] the victory. That's exactly what has
[1:11:16] happened today. Can these bones live
[1:11:21] again? Born in an age of lukewarmness.
[1:11:25] born in the age uh uh uh uh of deception
[1:11:29] and broken homes,
[1:11:34] insanity,
[1:11:35] this world has fallen apart.
[1:11:39] But in the in the age of so much
[1:11:41] darkness,
[1:11:44] can these bones live again?
[1:11:50] Brother said, he said, "Son of man,
[1:11:55] Can these boats live again? And he says,
[1:11:59] "That's
[1:12:00] him. That's him. That's his
[1:12:04] victory." The condensing of God. Amen.
[1:12:09] God has worked himself down into
[1:12:13] humanity
[1:12:14] again. Oh, church of a living God. We
[1:12:18] might have been birthed in the age of
[1:12:20] lukewarmness. Amen. But we got we got
[1:12:23] something down inside of our hearts
[1:12:26] called the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:28] Amen. That's energizing our bodies,
[1:12:31] energizing our spirit.
[1:12:35] When I don't even feel like praising
[1:12:36] him, I'm going to go ahead and lift my
[1:12:37] hands up a little bit tonight.
[1:12:41] Hey, I got a tennis elbow and this arm.
[1:12:44] Don't want to work too good, but I still
[1:12:45] want to praise the Lord tonight. Amen.
[1:12:47] Cuz God is good. I say, "Can these bones
[1:12:52] live again?" I say, "Look around you
[1:12:53] tonight. Look around you tonight. How
[1:12:56] many believers do we have tonight? Look
[1:12:58] around tonight, church. These bones are
[1:13:01] living in such a great darkness and
[1:13:04] deceit that in the evening time there is
[1:13:07] going to be light." I say tonight,
[1:13:10] church, there's going to be believers
[1:13:13] that's on fire for this message and
[1:13:16] going to take God at his word in the
[1:13:19] midst of all all odds.
[1:13:23] They're going to walk and positionally
[1:13:26] place those waves under their feet.
[1:13:36] Brother Herald, I believe the bride was
[1:13:41] prethreaded before the foundation of the
[1:13:43] world.
[1:13:46] If the world threaded you, the world
[1:13:48] could pull you. You was pulled by the
[1:13:51] world for a season. Why? that germ seed
[1:13:54] that God had in you when you came to
[1:13:56] this world. Amen. Was living down inside
[1:13:59] of your heart. Amen. There dormant for
[1:14:02] so many years, Sister Stephanie. But one
[1:14:04] day, God, rich in mercy, came looking
[1:14:08] for you. You didn't go looking for him.
[1:14:11] He came looking and seeking to save you.
[1:14:14] That which was lost.
[1:14:18] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:21] You was
[1:14:22] predestinated. You was prethreaded
[1:14:25] before the foundation of the world under
[1:14:29] that same sworn promise.
[1:14:33] If the son shall make you free, you're
[1:14:38] free indeed.
[1:14:41] Hallelujah.
[1:14:43] Just a few just a week or so ago, two
[1:14:45] weeks ago, there was a convict that
[1:14:48] escaped out of Calico Rock. I'm sure you
[1:14:50] heard about it here. It's been all over
[1:14:51] the news. And but you know
[1:14:54] what? He he over time he made him some
[1:14:57] garment that looked like the police
[1:14:59] officer. And brother Ben, he snuck his
[1:15:02] way out and they didn't quite notice it.
[1:15:05] He got away. Oh, but church, it wasn't
[1:15:08] 30 minutes later. He was beginning to
[1:15:11] broadcast all over this nation. Amen. He
[1:15:14] He might be outside of the prison bars,
[1:15:18] but he's only escaping.
[1:15:21] The fear is still following everywhere
[1:15:24] he goes. Amen. He's still looking over
[1:15:26] his shoulder. He's trying to change his
[1:15:28] name. He's trying to change his
[1:15:30] appearance.
[1:15:32] And no matter what, Amen. The time can
[1:15:37] catch up with him if he don't take his
[1:15:38] life. Amen. But he will always live
[1:15:42] under the bondage.
[1:15:45] because he's escaping.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. Amen. When they was down in
[1:15:51] Egypt, they was under the prison bars.
[1:15:54] If they would escape, Amen. They would
[1:15:57] go out and they had every right to bring
[1:15:59] him back. And that's the way Arkansas
[1:16:02] State Police has every right to seek
[1:16:05] him, search for him, and bring him back
[1:16:08] to justice
[1:16:11] because he's escaping.
[1:16:13] Come on. Oh, but church, when Moses went
[1:16:18] down with a mighty hand as a one-man
[1:16:21] invasion, Amen. He brought the children,
[1:16:24] I could preach it there for a little
[1:16:25] while. Amen. But when they brought them
[1:16:27] out of the Egypt,
[1:16:30] Hallelujah. And they begin to walk
[1:16:32] toward their promised land and no doubt
[1:16:35] these words was echoing in their their
[1:16:37] their hearts and their mind. I'm going
[1:16:40] to be increased. I'm going to be
[1:16:42] increased. We're going to inherit the
[1:16:44] land. This is what been promised. This
[1:16:47] was a sworn promise from Almighty God.
[1:16:50] And we're living under that sworn
[1:16:53] promise. Yes, sir. And God be to bring
[1:16:57] them out with a mighty hand. And the
[1:16:59] enemy begin to come in like a flood. Oh,
[1:17:03] but God was watching over an
[1:17:05] inheritance. Amen. He came and stayed
[1:17:07] the hand of the Egyptians all night
[1:17:10] long.
[1:17:11] And here come the wind of Yahweh out of
[1:17:14] the heavens and departed the sea. And
[1:17:17] the children of God walked across on dry
[1:17:20] ground. Oh my. Amen. As the Holy Gh as
[1:17:24] the Holy Spirit would stay in the the
[1:17:26] hand of the enemy.
[1:17:29] The pill of fire and the cloud was
[1:17:31] holding back the enemy. Yeah.
[1:17:35] But as the last one entered the other
[1:17:38] side, God released them and let them.
[1:17:42] But that see, Amen. That divided sea
[1:17:45] wasn't for the enemy.
[1:17:48] It wasn't their way of escape. God had a
[1:17:52] plan. God had a plan. Oh my. Just when
[1:17:56] the enemy got right where God wanted
[1:17:58] him, he released that power
[1:18:02] and Moses and Marram looked back
[1:18:06] and one grabbed a tambourine. Another
[1:18:08] begin to sing a new song. Amen. They
[1:18:11] begin to rejoice. They begin to dance.
[1:18:13] They begin to scream. Why? Because their
[1:18:15] enemy was dead. There was no longer
[1:18:19] escape.
[1:18:21] Who the son has made free is free
[1:18:24] indeed. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. I
[1:18:29] say this evening, you're not an escapee,
[1:18:31] church. You're free indeed.
[1:18:37] He who the son has made free is free
[1:18:40] indeed.
[1:18:44] No more bondage. He says, "Amen. No
[1:18:48] bondage.
[1:18:49] Free in the liberty where Christ has
[1:18:52] made you free."
[1:18:54] He said, "That's right. Go ahead, knock
[1:18:57] that little height out and that little
[1:18:59] Jebusite. Take that little Canaanite and
[1:19:02] just kick him away."
[1:19:04] Why? Because you're not an escapee of
[1:19:06] Lady Oia.
[1:19:08] Lady Oil has no hold on you any longer.
[1:19:12] You was prethreaded before the
[1:19:14] foundation of the world. A prophet said,
[1:19:17] "You have turned heavily. Thank you,
[1:19:20] Lord. You already turned in that
[1:19:23] direction.
[1:19:24] And if Jesus tells you to come, I say
[1:19:27] you're going to make it tonight.
[1:19:30] Hallelujah.
[1:19:33] My not escape you and you're free
[1:19:35] indeed.
[1:19:37] You're free indeed tonight. If that wave
[1:19:40] has been kicking you around, brother
[1:19:42] simply says, "You're not escaping." And
[1:19:44] let's let's just kick that escape
[1:19:47] mentality out of our lives. You're not
[1:19:50] an escapee. You're not barely getting by
[1:19:53] later. No, no, no, no, no. Amen. I'm
[1:19:56] telling you, everything that you have
[1:19:58] need of, even the rapture is already
[1:20:01] within you.
[1:20:04] Thank you, Lord. I say as Paul made it
[1:20:06] to Rome, you're going to make it home.
[1:20:09] Shipwreck didn't stop Paul. Snake bait
[1:20:11] didn't stop Paul. And I say that these
[1:20:14] trials that so easily besets us is not
[1:20:16] going to stop us either.
[1:20:20] Hallelujah.
[1:20:23] Cuz we're the battle is already over.
[1:20:28] The victory is already been won.
[1:20:33] Jane, it's one. It's over.
[1:20:37] You know, in a football game, if you're
[1:20:39] familiar with
[1:20:40] football, there comes a time in a ball
[1:20:43] ball game
[1:20:45] that the the team that is fixing to lose
[1:20:49] had exhausted all of its options. The
[1:20:53] day they're out of
[1:20:55] timeouts, they have no way to stop the
[1:20:58] clock. Yet, there's still a minute and a
[1:21:00] half on the on the clock. They're still
[1:21:01] in time,
[1:21:03] but the quarterback can get into a place
[1:21:05] called victory formation. And they c
[1:21:08] they they the lineman surround the
[1:21:10] quarterback and he can take the ball and
[1:21:13] he can and take a knee and the crowd is
[1:21:17] is shouting. The team is rejoicing.
[1:21:20] There's still time on the clock. There's
[1:21:23] still time left. But the enemy has
[1:21:25] exhausted all of its options. Come on.
[1:21:30] I say 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ
[1:21:35] stripped hell of all of its options. He
[1:21:39] defeated death. He took the stinger that
[1:21:42] his greatest weapon was death. And Jesus
[1:21:46] body tore the the the stinger of death
[1:21:50] and he pulled it into his bosom and he
[1:21:54] went to hell and he knocked on prison's
[1:21:57] door
[1:21:59] and says, "Give me those keys. You torn
[1:22:02] me and my children long enough." And he
[1:22:05] began to conquer Satan's trinity.
[1:22:09] That's right.
[1:22:12] It's vindicating their victory.
[1:22:15] We're here in time, church. We could
[1:22:18] still rejoice.
[1:22:20] We could still shout. We could still
[1:22:22] scream.
[1:22:25] It's not just an emotion. We're just
[1:22:27] excited cuz we got a revelation and the
[1:22:31] gates of hell cannot prevail against it.
[1:22:33] Amen. What revelation did the message
[1:22:35] bring us? I came from God and I'm going
[1:22:39] back to God.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah. It's a promise. Satan tries
[1:22:44] to attack your sickness, diseases, and
[1:22:47] your past, and your failures.
[1:22:49] Come on.
[1:22:51] It becomes your diagnosis.
[1:22:56] Satan tries to diagnose you with
[1:22:58] depression, autism.
[1:23:02] He tries to tag you with all this.
[1:23:03] Listen, brother Brown said that blind
[1:23:05] little German girl
[1:23:08] said, "Oh, sweetheart, I came all the
[1:23:10] way from the United States to pray. Can
[1:23:12] I do I have a little bit of time?" Well,
[1:23:15] Joel said, "All right, bud." He took an
[1:23:17] hour and 10 or 15 at our church. He
[1:23:19] said, "I could have that
[1:23:22] tonight." I said, "Yes, sweetheart. I
[1:23:25] came all the way from the United States
[1:23:27] to pray for you." She put her arm and
[1:23:29] wrapped her little arms around me. Laid
[1:23:31] her little head over on my shoulder.
[1:23:33] Just the assurance, child simplicity,
[1:23:36] that God of heaven was going to move
[1:23:38] somehow. And a few moments she opened
[1:23:41] her little eyes. She said, "Is that what
[1:23:43] you call them things, lights?" Her
[1:23:45] mother jumped and screaming, ran out of
[1:23:47] her shoes, run to the platform. She
[1:23:49] said, "Darling," she said, "Mother, are
[1:23:51] you you're so beautiful. Why?" He said,
[1:23:54] "Calvary prepared." Yeah. Oh,
[1:23:57] hallelujah. Made preparation for her
[1:24:00] healing of her eyes 2,000 years ago. She
[1:24:05] was diagnosed with blindness, but her
[1:24:07] diagnosis wasn't her verdict.
[1:24:11] Hallelujah. There was a blind man in the
[1:24:13] Bible. A was blind from his youth.
[1:24:18] Amen. He was diagnosed. He didn't have
[1:24:20] no
[1:24:21] eyeballs, but God rich in mercy. Jesus
[1:24:25] sped on the ground and touched some
[1:24:27] mudcakes and plated it on his eyes and
[1:24:29] go told him to wash.
[1:24:32] Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] His diagnosis that he would never see
[1:24:37] again.
[1:24:41] But Jesus said, "Go
[1:24:44] wash." And when he washed the mud out of
[1:24:47] his eyes,
[1:24:51] the mud would burn from his eyes.
[1:24:55] For the first
[1:24:58] time, this man had eyesight
[1:25:02] and they came looking for they was the
[1:25:04] hell was so disturbed. I say, "Let's
[1:25:06] disturb hell tonight." Hell was so
[1:25:11] disturbed and they came searching. They
[1:25:14] talked to his family, talked to the
[1:25:15] church. They finally came to
[1:25:17] him said, "I don't know what y'all's
[1:25:20] complaining about. I don't know what my
[1:25:21] mom and dad's talking about. I don't
[1:25:24] know what the religious world is saying
[1:25:25] about this. All I know this one thing I
[1:25:28] know. I once was blind, but now I see.
[1:25:34] Yes, sir. Hell might have told you that
[1:25:36] you'd always had that problem, but
[1:25:39] that's only hell's diagnosis. Amen. His
[1:25:42] verdict is his word. And he said, I'm
[1:25:45] the Lord God that health all thy
[1:25:47] diseases. Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:51] Hallelujah. Our diagnos our
[1:25:55] diagnosis was we're not worthy.
[1:25:59] No way we could be saved.
[1:26:02] But this message of the king screamed
[1:26:05] it's not so from the beginning. Your
[1:26:08] verdict is you never done it in the
[1:26:11] first place.
[1:26:13] Hallelujah.
[1:26:16] Hey, I was diagnosed with problems with
[1:26:18] my right ear.
[1:26:20] I had to go to specialist because they
[1:26:22] had a surgery when I was a young boy and
[1:26:24] had to go twice a a year to get it get
[1:26:27] it worked on. And you know, I was
[1:26:30] sitting in our our 10 revival, brother
[1:26:32] Ben back in the back last fall and
[1:26:35] Jonathan Martin was preaching, brother
[1:26:36] Jonathan was preaching and at the end,
[1:26:38] boy, the Lord was really dealing with my
[1:26:40] heart and and I was like, you know, this
[1:26:44] is my time.
[1:26:47] And it was running through my mind at
[1:26:48] that time, brother Ben. I was having to
[1:26:50] go often. I was had to go several times.
[1:26:52] I had to go and get my get get it get it
[1:26:55] worked on because it was it was dropping
[1:26:57] down uh uh uh in between my eard drum
[1:27:00] and it was causing havoc. I couldn't
[1:27:09] sleep. But I can remember David Solid
[1:27:11] placing his hands over my ears and
[1:27:14] brother Jonathan begin to pray and
[1:27:16] something begin to
[1:27:18] move. My diagnosis said I'd always have
[1:27:21] that problem.
[1:27:23] But his verdict
[1:27:25] says I'm not finished with you. The king
[1:27:28] still has one more move tonight. I'm
[1:27:31] here to tell you I'm a witness. Amen.
[1:27:34] That that hasn't bothered me. Satan
[1:27:36] tried to raise his head one time. I
[1:27:38] said, "Boo devil.
[1:27:41] Hallelujah. I say he's the same
[1:27:43] yesterday, today, and forever. If he
[1:27:45] done it for a blind man, if he did it
[1:27:48] for a blind girl, if he did it for a
[1:27:50] hillbilly from Arkansas, he could do it
[1:27:52] for you tonight.
[1:27:55] I don't care what hell has tagged for
[1:27:58] you. I don't care what the doctor has
[1:28:00] diagnosed you with.
[1:28:03] It is not. It is not the final word.
[1:28:08] It's not the final say tonight.
[1:28:12] Hallelujah.
[1:28:14] It's not the final say.
[1:28:21] Cuz we're
[1:28:23] fighting in
[1:28:25] time behind the greatest
[1:28:29] lineman echoing in our heart. The battle
[1:28:32] is already over. We're already in
[1:28:35] victory formation. Right in the midst of
[1:28:38] Satan's Eden. Oh, if I don't want to
[1:28:41] make you shout tonight, I don't know
[1:28:42] what will. Right in the midst of Satan's
[1:28:45] Eden, there is a bride that's fighting
[1:28:48] behind. Still in time, but behind the
[1:28:52] victory formation of Calvary.
[1:28:56] Faith is the victory that overcomes the
[1:29:00] world. To conquer means to beat down.
[1:29:06] Come on. Beat down is a physical beaten
[1:29:09] or
[1:29:09] assault. It's a savage beatd down. It's
[1:29:13] a decisive
[1:29:16] defeat. Praise the Lord. Jesus took
[1:29:21] advantage of
[1:29:22] hell. It was a decisive
[1:29:25] defeat. But now he's saying you have a
[1:29:28] right. Amen. To conquer means to beat
[1:29:31] down. A savage beatdown. Decisive
[1:29:34] defeat.
[1:29:36] And it says to conquer is to override,
[1:29:39] to ride over and prevail over,
[1:29:43] annull, to declare or make legally
[1:29:46] legally invalid or void, to reduce to
[1:29:51] nothing, to make
[1:29:53] ineffective, neutralize the actions of.
[1:29:58] Oh, hallelujah. G. He says handcuff
[1:30:02] means to to restraint take away one's
[1:30:06] ability to
[1:30:08] perform. To throw into
[1:30:11] prison just mean it means the primary
[1:30:14] meaning is to restrict restrict
[1:30:16] somebody's freedom. Oh, I'm preaching to
[1:30:19] you tonight. Amen. Beat down is a
[1:30:21] decisive defeat. Amen. Override is to
[1:30:25] make him ineffective in your life.
[1:30:27] Neutralize the actions of hell. Amen. To
[1:30:30] take away the ability to perform in your
[1:30:32] life. Amen. To restrict hell's freedom.
[1:30:38] That's right. It means that sin that
[1:30:41] once ruled you, you rule it now. To rule
[1:30:45] over means to exert control or dominance
[1:30:49] over something. To have authority over.
[1:30:52] To exercise absolutely authority. To to
[1:30:56] to over someone or something. to serve
[1:30:59] as their boss.
[1:31:02] I say let's take a footprint on him
[1:31:04] tonight.
[1:31:06] Amen. Let's take a footprint tonight.
[1:31:08] Let's beat him down. Let's override his
[1:31:11] hell. Let's override those those bluffs.
[1:31:15] Override those feelings. Override them
[1:31:18] mind games. Override them funny feelings
[1:31:22] against your brother or sister. Handcuff
[1:31:24] that devil that's trying to destroy you
[1:31:27] and your family. So what? How can I
[1:31:30] handcuff hell? I tell you how he do it.
[1:31:32] Take God's word. Say boo devil.
[1:31:35] If he don't move, take the authority of
[1:31:38] God's word. You've got a badge.
[1:31:42] Badge of authority. A better handcuff
[1:31:45] that guy. Throw him in prison. Restrict
[1:31:48] his freedom in your vehicle.
[1:31:52] I don't want hell to feel comfortable
[1:31:54] around me. I want to restrict his
[1:31:56] freedom. I want to talk so much about
[1:31:58] Jesus. Hell don't feel welcome around
[1:32:00] me. I want to live so much in his
[1:32:02] presence. I want to be lost in his
[1:32:05] presence, found in his likeness. Thank
[1:32:08] you, Lord.
[1:32:11] He says to conquer means beat down,
[1:32:13] override, thrown into prison, handcuff
[1:32:15] that sin that once ru, you rule over.
[1:32:17] Now you're its boss. Oh yeah.
[1:32:23] that you have absolutely authority
[1:32:27] over. Oh, there's nothing to fight
[1:32:29] about. The fight is over. The whistle
[1:32:33] has blown. Brother Brown said, "The flag
[1:32:35] has rose. And in the midst of every sin,
[1:32:38] pal, every mist of every sick room is
[1:32:41] the old rugged cross planted by the
[1:32:44] blood of Jesus Christ."
[1:32:46] Oh yeah. Hallelujah. Amen. planted by
[1:32:49] the blood of Jesus Christ, a mighty
[1:32:52] conqueror. Only thing we have to do is
[1:32:55] believe and look and live. If you get
[1:32:58] discouraged tonight, amen, look at the
[1:33:00] old rugged cross and the blood of Jesus
[1:33:03] Christ. Amen. It's making a statement.
[1:33:06] We're not defeated. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:33:09] When that great battle was going down,
[1:33:11] Amen. There in the Old Testament, Moses
[1:33:14] was on the hillside. remember they could
[1:33:16] look back at his hands long as his hands
[1:33:18] was lifted high. Amen. It didn't matter
[1:33:20] what was going down on the valley.
[1:33:22] Didn't matter what you was going
[1:33:24] through. Didn't matter how you felt.
[1:33:26] Amen. You didn't judge the battle on
[1:33:28] what you was going through. You judged
[1:33:30] the battle of what Moses hands was
[1:33:33] doing. If his hands was down, you was
[1:33:35] losing. If his hands was up, you was
[1:33:37] winning. Amen. He didn't allow the
[1:33:40] things around him to deter how they was
[1:33:43] fighting the battle. Come on. Come on,
[1:33:46] somebody. Amen. And brother Brown said
[1:33:48] they nailed Jesus hands on an old rugged
[1:33:52] cross. Don't matter where you're at.
[1:33:54] Amen. All you got to do is look and
[1:33:56] live.
[1:33:59] Sister Carla, doesn't matter what's
[1:34:01] going on out here in the
[1:34:02] valley, Sister Jack, it doesn't matter
[1:34:05] what kind of battles are raging in your
[1:34:07] life. Come on. When you're ready to give
[1:34:10] up, Sister Stephanie, all you got to do
[1:34:12] is look back to Calvary. Come on. Amen.
[1:34:16] We don't judge how we're winning by what
[1:34:18] we're going through. We judge by what's
[1:34:20] already been done. We're working and
[1:34:23] living under victory formation.
[1:34:28] Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] Only thing we have to do is believe and
[1:34:33] look and
[1:34:34] live. He said it means that you have
[1:34:39] overcome it.
[1:34:42] Same quote. Beat down, override,
[1:34:45] handcuff, throwing to prison, sin that
[1:34:47] roll on you, you rule it now. And he
[1:34:49] said it means that you have overcome it.
[1:34:54] You have whipped it. You are greater.
[1:34:58] You've been increased. You're greater
[1:35:01] than it is
[1:35:04] because the strength of God that's in
[1:35:06] you is greater than any affliction that
[1:35:08] can come upon you. Nothing can overtake
[1:35:12] you.
[1:35:16] You're not an escapee. You're free. If
[1:35:19] you are, he says that any man I'm
[1:35:20] hurrying. If any
[1:35:23] man anywhere ever feels the burden of
[1:35:26] his sin, we have a lamb. It's a lamb
[1:35:29] that takes away the sin of the world. He
[1:35:32] says, "Till the blood that was shed on
[1:35:35] Calvary has been applied in your heart."
[1:35:38] Then he says, "The burden is gone. My
[1:35:42] burdens rolled away." Then you are free.
[1:35:48] He He says, "He who the Son makes free
[1:35:52] is free indeed." Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] It doesn't matter what you're going
[1:35:59] through. Hey, listen. We go through some
[1:36:01] great trials in our life. And we we're
[1:36:04] humans. If you can get that that bottle
[1:36:06] back there, Brother B. Amen. We're
[1:36:08] humans. We go through battles. We go
[1:36:11] through
[1:36:11] trials. We go through grief. We go
[1:36:14] through hard times, brother David. And
[1:36:16] we might have to carry that
[1:36:18] burden. Brother Brown carry that stomach
[1:36:20] problem for a long time. You can stand
[1:36:21] up, brother Ben. Everybody. Ain't he a
[1:36:24] handsome fella?
[1:36:26] He's a good pastor, isn't he?
[1:36:28] He's a good brother, too. If you'll hold
[1:36:31] that out, Brother Ben, just with your
[1:36:32] fingers. No, don't try to cheat. Hold it
[1:36:35] straight out now. I know you've been
[1:36:36] sick and weakling, but grab a talk. Let
[1:36:39] me help him out a little
[1:36:41] bit. We're just h here to have a good
[1:36:43] time anyhow. Just hold that right there.
[1:36:46] Don't move. Amen. It it it's it's
[1:36:50] sometimes the things that we suffer in
[1:36:52] this life can get hard and get heavy and
[1:36:56] we can feel start feeling the pressure
[1:36:58] of life and before you know
[1:37:01] it before you know it I know it's hard
[1:37:04] to take your eyes off of but brother Ben
[1:37:07] when he first grabbed a hold of
[1:37:09] it oh I got
[1:37:12] this I'm a big fella I can handle this
[1:37:16] I'm strong I can handle this. I'm big
[1:37:18] enough. I can handle
[1:37:21] this. Now he's turning red. He can't
[1:37:24] even praise God now. Amen. He ain't
[1:37:26] thinking about Jesus. He ain't thinking
[1:37:28] about church. He's not think he's
[1:37:30] thinking about the burden. It's getting
[1:37:32] heavy. The very burden that he could
[1:37:34] handle is now becoming so much. It's
[1:37:37] drained his victory. It's drained his
[1:37:39] praise. It's drained his clapping his
[1:37:41] hands. It's drain It's sapped everything
[1:37:43] out of his life. He's come to the church
[1:37:46] with a burden, but all Jesus said, "Let
[1:37:48] me take hold of it. Let me help you out.
[1:37:51] You don't have to let go of it." Oh,
[1:37:53] don't that feel good? Oh, it feels good,
[1:37:55] don't you? You can't have my drink.
[1:38:01] Come on. That's all he's asking. Church,
[1:38:03] so many times. Amen. Though they say,
[1:38:05] "Well, I ain't talking about your
[1:38:07] sunship. I ain't talking about you being
[1:38:09] sealed. I'm not talking about you not.
[1:38:12] I'm talking about you being human.
[1:38:14] and fighting battles, human battles,
[1:38:18] human sufferings. That's right.
[1:38:22] He told Paul in that dream, he said,
[1:38:23] "Listen, Amen. Go to the top and cut
[1:38:26] that tree down." Remember, Brother Bam
[1:38:28] telling about that Paul Ritter or
[1:38:29] whatever his name was. Another brain
[1:38:31] fog.
[1:38:34] Amen. He told him, "Go up there. Cut it
[1:38:36] down." And when he did, he's like, "Oh,
[1:38:38] I can't do this. The burden is so heavy.
[1:38:41] The burden's so heavy.
[1:38:45] And then he heard his boss. I could
[1:38:47] preach this, but I know, brother Joel,
[1:38:48] time. My time 110's running. Amen. It
[1:38:52] got it got so hard. And then he heard
[1:38:55] that sweet small voice. That still small
[1:38:57] voice that said, "Paul, quit struggling
[1:39:01] it.
[1:39:02] I know the bottle's getting heavy. It's
[1:39:05] getting so heavy. I know. Listen, before
[1:39:08] I told you to go up there, I had a
[1:39:10] predestinated stream of grace.
[1:39:13] All you got to do is roll that burden
[1:39:16] upon my grace.
[1:39:20] And what did he tell him to do? Jump on
[1:39:22] top of it. Put that burden under your
[1:39:25] feet. Show ownership.
[1:39:28] Show
[1:39:29] authority. Let it become your foottool,
[1:39:32] Paul.
[1:39:34] And what he say, I'm riding on it. I'm
[1:39:37] riding on it. I'm riding on it.
[1:39:40] It took the burden away. He was still on
[1:39:43] top of it, it was still there.
[1:39:48] But when I grabbed a hold of it and
[1:39:49] began to when God puts his hand to it,
[1:39:52] you're free. Free indeed.
[1:39:56] He said, "Then the burden is gone. The
[1:39:58] son makes you free. Free indeed."
[1:40:03] Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] We got an inheritance. Can you say amen?
[1:40:09] I'll finish with this tonight. And our
[1:40:11] inheritance belongs to us. The bad thing
[1:40:14] we get to preach and just get
[1:40:15] comfortable and things start coming and
[1:40:17] then we got to quit.
[1:40:21] And our inheritance belongs to us. Can
[1:40:23] you say amen?
[1:40:25] Inheritance by predestination. I thought
[1:40:28] this was one I I preached several
[1:40:30] services on this one quote at home. They
[1:40:32] had to be somebody to leave me
[1:40:34] inheritance. And he said, "Why you say
[1:40:36] Jesus left your inheritance?" Brother
[1:40:39] said, "I beg your pardon. Jesus never
[1:40:41] left your
[1:40:42] inheritance. He only came down and paid
[1:40:45] for your inheritance.
[1:40:47] He brought it to you. Brought you to
[1:40:50] your inheritance."
[1:40:52] But listen to this. Said, "Brother B
[1:40:53] said, but your name was put on the
[1:40:57] Lamb's book of life before the
[1:40:59] foundation of the world.
[1:41:03] God gave your
[1:41:05] inheritance. Your inheritance was first.
[1:41:09] God sent Jesus. He said to make the
[1:41:13] inheritance real to you.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. And nothing in time could
[1:41:27] ever time skipping things. Nothing in
[1:41:29] time could
[1:41:31] ever take that away from you.
[1:41:36] At the 50th year, amen. You remember the
[1:41:39] the year of Jubilee, that 50th year.
[1:41:42] Amen. When the trumpet blow, the priest
[1:41:44] blowed the trumpet, it meant something
[1:41:47] to those slaves that that was under
[1:41:49] bondage. Amen. Brother Brown said they
[1:41:51] could drop the hole. They can drop the
[1:41:53] shovel. They can look in the
[1:41:55] taskmaster's face and says, "You can't
[1:41:57] hit me one more time." And they've been
[1:41:59] people that may that has taken over
[1:42:01] their land, but the scripture said the
[1:42:04] land cannot be sold forever. Amen.
[1:42:06] Meaning, Amen. They that Satan could
[1:42:09] only hold it for a season. Amen. The the
[1:42:12] sons of Anch took Caleb's land, but that
[1:42:16] land was their days on that land was
[1:42:19] numbered.
[1:42:22] They cannot keep the land forever.
[1:42:28] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm telling you,
[1:42:30] church, Satan has robbed us for a
[1:42:32] season, but Satan's days are numbered.
[1:42:36] He cannot keep the land forever.
[1:42:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Because you did not
[1:42:44] receive your inheritance in time. You
[1:42:47] received your inheritance in the
[1:42:49] eternities.
[1:42:52] Amen. That God gave it to you first. And
[1:42:55] no matter what hell tries to do on this
[1:42:58] in time can never rob you, what God had
[1:43:02] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:43:06] world.
[1:43:08] Hallelujah. Oh, don't you love him?
[1:43:11] That's gu. No matter what happened in
[1:43:14] time can never erase what happened in
[1:43:16] the first place.
[1:43:20] What a revelation.
[1:43:22] Under that same sworn promise. I came
[1:43:26] from God and I'm going back to God. Oh
[1:43:30] church, I say you're a value tonight.
[1:43:33] The debt is settled. Everything against
[1:43:36] you has been struck off.
[1:43:39] Brother man said, "I act silly, but I'm
[1:43:41] feeling pretty good." How many can
[1:43:43] rejoice around that? There's an abstract
[1:43:45] deed. Do you realize what that means? Do
[1:43:47] you realize what that means, brother?
[1:43:50] There's nothing can take it from you.
[1:43:54] It's been tra I'm closing. It's been
[1:43:56] traced all the way back, brother Ben.
[1:43:58] It's been traced all the way back. where
[1:44:01] too they've been traced back from the
[1:44:04] foundation of the world.
[1:44:08] By fornowledge he predestinated you.
[1:44:12] Hallelujah. Amen. He knew the trials. He
[1:44:15] knew every wave that you would go
[1:44:17] through.
[1:44:19] Oh, but he knew the power of his
[1:44:21] resurrection, the power of his blood.
[1:44:26] Come on. You're a value tonight. You're
[1:44:29] a value. No matter what hell tries to
[1:44:31] say, hell tries everything he can do,
[1:44:34] brother Daniel, devalue who you are, but
[1:44:37] he can't.
[1:44:41] I can take this. I do have some money in
[1:44:43] here. I can take this $100
[1:44:46] bill. I say, "Brother Ben, you want this
[1:44:48] $100?" Absolutely. Oh, man. Look at
[1:44:50] that. He didn't hesitate, did he? Even
[1:44:53] though I worked hard for that. He said,
[1:44:55] 'Y yeah, I'll take that $100 bill and I
[1:44:58] can take it and I can wad it up.
[1:45:02] You still want that $100 bill?
[1:45:04] Absolutely. I can take it and I can
[1:45:06] stomp on
[1:45:07] it. Say, Brother Ben, you still want
[1:45:10] that $100 bill? Why do you still want
[1:45:12] that $100 bill?
[1:45:14] $100?
[1:45:16] I stomped on it. I could put it in dirt.
[1:45:19] Dirt didn't see. There's a seal on here.
[1:45:21] There's a verification code right here.
[1:45:24] And you could trace it, brother B. Hey,
[1:45:26] he said he traced it all the way back.
[1:45:30] Amen. To a pot of gold somewhere.
[1:45:33] And this, he said, this is all backed
[1:45:35] up. I say tonight, Amen. Don't listen to
[1:45:39] the devil's lies. He's beat you up over
[1:45:41] your past. He's beat you over things
[1:45:43] that's happened in your journey. Oh, but
[1:45:46] you're of value tonight, church. You've
[1:45:48] been weded up. You've been trampled
[1:45:50] under feet. Amen. But you got a code
[1:45:53] down inside of you. A validation code
[1:45:56] that goes all the way not just to
[1:45:58] Calvary, but before the foundation. I
[1:46:01] wish I had the voice tonight to preach
[1:46:02] it. All the way back to Calvary.
[1:46:07] Thank you, Lord. And identifies your
[1:46:09] value and can be traced all the way back
[1:46:13] to where it is all backed up. Brother
[1:46:15] Bram said, Brother Herald, he said, "The
[1:46:17] bride oh will come forth and there is
[1:46:20] all pre-planned by God and it's all
[1:46:23] backed up from the beginning."
[1:46:27] Hallelujah. God knew what he was done.
[1:46:29] He gave your inheritance first. Hell
[1:46:32] can't rob you of it.
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. You can't lose your
[1:46:37] inheritance.
[1:46:39] You cannot lo You're free indeed. You're
[1:46:42] not bound. You're free.
[1:46:44] Amen. You're not lost or found. You're
[1:46:47] not forgiven. You're justified as though
[1:46:49] you've never done it in the first place.
[1:46:54] I say you're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:57] And the blessing will come. The
[1:47:00] blessing's going to come. God cares for
[1:47:02] you no matter what you're going through.
[1:47:05] Even before you needed a blessing, God
[1:47:08] was preparing you one.
[1:47:15] I might have told this story here
[1:47:16] before, but I'll tell it
[1:47:18] again. There was a lady one time,
[1:47:20] Brother Ben, closing with
[1:47:22] this. Yeah, she's laughing about it.
[1:47:24] They're like, "Yeah, right. Them
[1:47:25] preachers
[1:47:27] lie." There was a lady, this elder lady,
[1:47:30] she she was down. She a she didn't have
[1:47:32] no more money. She was out of food.
[1:47:36] She went to pray
[1:47:39] and she got on her knees while she was
[1:47:42] praying. She heard some noise
[1:47:44] outside. She went out and looked,
[1:47:46] Brother Harvey. She looked out the
[1:47:49] window. She seen 21
[1:47:52] chickens coming down the hill down the
[1:47:55] road.
[1:47:57] went into her barn, stayed there a few
[1:48:00] moments, and she watched those little
[1:48:01] chickens come right back out and go
[1:48:03] right back up that road and back home.
[1:48:06] And she said, "Honey, you ain't going to
[1:48:08] believe what I seen." I was
[1:48:10] praying. He said, "Let's go out there
[1:48:12] and see what happened." They went out
[1:48:14] there and there was 21 eggs in her barn.
[1:48:19] And she said, "A good neighbor." She
[1:48:20] said, "Man, I felt so bad." She said, "I
[1:48:22] went up to the neighbor and I told the
[1:48:24] neighbor, I said, "You ain't going to
[1:48:26] believe this, but your chickens," when
[1:48:28] she said that, that lady said, "You know
[1:48:30] what? I hate those chickens. Those
[1:48:32] chickens don't never lay nothing for me.
[1:48:35] They don't never do nothing. They're
[1:48:36] lazy. They've never laid no eggs at all
[1:48:38] for us. I don't know why we bought
[1:48:46] them. She didn't have to buy them.
[1:48:49] She didn't have to worry about them. She
[1:48:52] didn't have to feed them.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Though those folks
[1:48:58] didn't know why they went out and bought
[1:48:59] 21 chickens, but God was preparing a
[1:49:02] blessing before they even needed a
[1:49:04] blessing. Hallelujah. That's my God
[1:49:07] tonight. I tell you, I was out at I was
[1:49:09] on a North Fork River one time. Amen.
[1:49:12] And I was floating down. We ran out of
[1:49:14] gas, believe it or not. Me and David
[1:49:17] Gates. and you know and and man we it
[1:49:19] was swift brother Dan you've been up
[1:49:21] there we was way down there below way
[1:49:23] down there and I thought man
[1:49:28] the fog starting to it's getting dark
[1:49:30] starting to the sun was setting I'm
[1:49:32] talking good
[1:49:33] lord you know what we going to do I gota
[1:49:37] I mean I do everything for brother David
[1:49:39] I don't know how I'm going to get him
[1:49:40] back up this
[1:49:42] river but you know what brother Harvey
[1:49:44] about that time there came a boat
[1:49:47] floating down. Thought you ever fished
[1:49:50] up there most most about the evening
[1:49:51] time? You don't hardly see anybody. But
[1:49:53] there was a guy, one guy in a boat
[1:49:55] floating
[1:49:56] down and didn't know why, but he put a
[1:49:58] five gallon extra tank of gas in his
[1:50:01] boat.
[1:50:04] Before I needed a blessing, before I
[1:50:05] knew I needed a blessing, God says, "Go
[1:50:08] ahead. Put this gas. You ain't going to
[1:50:10] need it, David. Go ahead. There's
[1:50:11] somebody down the river." Amen. That's
[1:50:13] going to need this tank of gas.
[1:50:16] Amen. Amen. This woman didn't have to
[1:50:18] buy it. She didn't have to go out and
[1:50:20] protect him. She didn't have to defend
[1:50:21] for him. All she had to do is go in and
[1:50:24] collect the blessing. I say that's the
[1:50:26] way it is tonight, church. God has gave
[1:50:29] us the blessings. All we had to do as
[1:50:31] believers is collect the blessing. Give
[1:50:34] me more. Give me more. Healing is my
[1:50:36] possession. Amen. Salvation is my
[1:50:39] possession. The Holy Ghost is my
[1:50:41] possession.
[1:50:43] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Regardless
[1:50:45] of the
[1:50:46] circumstances, we are anointed for
[1:50:49] victory. Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:54] Thank you, Lord. God who's rich in
[1:51:01] mercy. God who's rich in mercy.
[1:51:09] sworn promise under living under the
[1:51:13] same sworn
[1:51:15] promise. We're going to live victorious.
[1:51:18] Thank you, Lord. There's going to be
[1:51:20] somebody going to walk right out of this
[1:51:22] dimension into another. Somebody's going
[1:51:25] to translate. Somebody's going to be
[1:51:27] changed in a moment of a twinkling of an
[1:51:29] eye. Somebody's going to live above sin.
[1:51:31] Somebody's going to beat him down.
[1:51:33] Somebody's going to handcuff. Somebody's
[1:51:35] going to override.
[1:51:38] Amen. It don't have to be for the church
[1:51:39] down the road. Amen. It could be for you
[1:51:42] tonight. Amen. I can say tell you
[1:51:45] tonight, God has got chickens laying
[1:51:47] eggs for you tonight.
[1:51:50] Exactly what you have need of. Amen. God
[1:51:53] has already been working in the future.
[1:51:56] All you've got to do is make
[1:51:59] footsteps toward your blessing. God's
[1:52:02] going to make this trial of blessing. Do
[1:52:04] you love the Lord tonight? Do you love
[1:52:06] him? Can you stand to your feet? the
[1:52:07] musicians will come. God's good to us,
[1:52:10] isn't he? It's good living and fighting
[1:52:14] behind victory
[1:52:15] formation.
[1:52:18] Hallelujah. God's
[1:52:21] good. Hell is out of
[1:52:24] options. What a
[1:52:27] vday. Brother said, "He's my victory and
[1:52:30] I'm his evidence."
[1:52:33] Oh, devil's howling about this. The
[1:52:36] manifested truth of the promise of the
[1:52:38] word is in her
[1:52:40] alone. They don't have the
[1:52:43] answer.
[1:52:45] Hallelujah. He said, "We come from the
[1:52:48] last days with a glorious gospel showing
[1:52:50] his victory. We are proof of his
[1:52:53] victory." He's my victory and I'm his
[1:52:57] evidence. I'm an evidence of his
[1:53:00] victory.
[1:53:04] Satan cannot possess the land
[1:53:08] forever. He's a
[1:53:10] squatter. His days are
[1:53:14] numbered. His days are numbered. Brother
[1:53:17] Robert, his days are
[1:53:21] numbered. He's only a squatter. He's
[1:53:23] only a bluff. He has no rights. His days
[1:53:26] are numbered. For a son and daughter of
[1:53:28] God, take their position. Say,
[1:53:31] "Satan, you diagnosed me with this, but
[1:53:34] it's not my verdict tonight. My verdict.
[1:53:38] God's put 21 eggs in my
[1:53:41] barn." Hallelujah. He's an everpresent
[1:53:44] help in a time of
[1:53:46] trouble. If you've been carrying a heavy
[1:53:48] burden
[1:53:49] tonight, I challenge you to commit it to
[1:53:53] the
[1:53:55] Lord. Can we just bow our hearts tonight
[1:53:57] just for a moment?
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:04] Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] Hallelujah. If you've been carrying a
[1:54:08] heavy burden
[1:54:10] tonight, I challenge you
[1:54:17] tonight. Jesus has been you to come,
[1:54:20] Peter. He's telling you, you can walk on
[1:54:22] the water
[1:54:24] tonight. You can put that diagnosis
[1:54:27] under your feet.
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:31] Jesus came walking on the
[1:54:34] water. Those waves may look big. They
[1:54:37] waves may look dangerous, but Jesus came
[1:54:41] to calm the raging battles in your life
[1:54:45] and become your burden barrier, your
[1:54:47] heavy load
[1:54:49] sharer. God bless your
[1:54:51] hands, Lord Jesus. We pray tonight, Lord
[1:54:54] God, that we can let go enough to allow
[1:54:56] you, Lord, become our burden barrier.
[1:54:59] Lord, we don't want to escape the
[1:55:00] burden. We want to be free. Free indeed
[1:55:03] tonight. Well, Lord, the Satan has
[1:55:05] diagnosed us with these problems. The
[1:55:08] giants has been in our land, but the
[1:55:10] giants can't hold the land forever.
[1:55:13] Amen. We as believers when we take God
[1:55:16] at his word and recognize who we are and
[1:55:20] we have the rights the abstract title
[1:55:23] deed Lord we got a right to walk on top
[1:55:26] of our ways Lord we got got a right to
[1:55:29] rise above it
[1:55:33] all Lord I pray Lord God that they can
[1:55:35] draw strength from this little these
[1:55:37] little words of encouragement tonight
[1:55:39] Father on a Wednesday night Lord I Pray,
[1:55:43] Lord God. Lord, if that burden's been
[1:55:46] draining their victory, if the burden
[1:55:48] been taking their joy, if burden's been
[1:55:50] taking their shout, the burden's been
[1:55:52] taking their their voice, their amens,
[1:55:55] their praise the Lord's, their
[1:55:58] walk, their smile, their joy, their
[1:56:01] happiness. Lord, I pray in the name of
[1:56:04] the Lord Jesus Christ tonight,
[1:56:07] Lord, Lord, they would allow you to come
[1:56:11] down and put your hands upon that
[1:56:14] burden and let it become light. Let them
[1:56:17] become free, free indeed.
[1:56:21] Oh Lord, they can re restore their joy,
[1:56:25] restore their praise, restore their
[1:56:28] dance, rejoice, restore their happiness,
[1:56:32] Lord. Restore their amens, restore their
[1:56:35] praise the Lords. Lord, I pray that
[1:56:38] you'll anoint no anoint them aresh
[1:56:40] tonight as we pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:56:44] name.
[1:56:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:53] And he said that sin that ruled
[1:56:56] you, you rule it now. You're its
[1:57:00] boss. You're its
[1:57:02] boss. And brother said, "You know what?
[1:57:05] I didn't know what I was going to do
[1:57:07] with those walls. I didn't have a
[1:57:09] strength to let those people in that
[1:57:11] insane institution free." Oh, but he
[1:57:14] said all of a sudden he heard that
[1:57:15] voice. He said, "Brother Herald," he
[1:57:17] just said, "You speak, oh house of hell,
[1:57:22] give away in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:25] Christ." And the walls begin to tremble
[1:57:28] below them. Oh church, I believe that's
[1:57:31] the same way with you tonight. Oh house
[1:57:34] of
[1:57:35] hell, you have no more liberty on my
[1:57:38] land. You can't hold the land forever.
[1:57:45] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Go ahead,
[1:57:46] brother. It's already done. Oh, you're
[1:57:51] in victory formation tonight.
[1:57:54] Oh, it's already done.

[1:58:27] smile to your face tonight. I've already
[1:58:29] made it. Oh, you believe it. We're still
[1:58:32] in time. Hallelujah. But we're in
[1:58:34] victory formation. I've already made it.
