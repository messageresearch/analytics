morning I I pray that we gathered this morning with our hope in him our hope to hear from him not to hear from me I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if somebody told you I was the best preacher in Louisiana you've been misinformed but our hope is not in me our our hope is in him and if he comes and he anoints and he speaks then we'll be blessed then we'll be changed then we can worship Him in Heavenly places cuz that's what makes makes it Heavenly is his presence when he comes and he speaks I know I don't have anything I can say that would bless you or help you but if he comes that makes all the difference in the world amen amen we're just so grateful and thankful for the opportunity to be here I'm blessed to have my wife with me my two sons Jude and Jackson on the way here it was getting dark and Jackson says to me he's my 5-year-old he says I thought you were going to preach tonight dad and I said no no no we're we're preaching tomorrow and my wife says yeah we're having two Services tomorrow he said of course at home we only have one service on Sunday he said what I hate that I came on this trip I said oh boy well at least maybe my other son and my wife will support me those kind of things happened you know when my daughter was younger one of the first times I ever went out I was getting ready to go to the church and my my notes wouldn't download to my iPad and I was I was panicking I really was and I was pan pin and I was my wife could tell I was getting a little bit tense and the minister texted me cuz I wasn't at the church yet and it was like 22 service time and he said I did mean 10:00 a.m. and my wife says Aaron I'm I'm praying for you and my daughter says I'm praying too dad that it won't be a flop so I have a very supportive uh group of children I say all that but I'm thankful to have them with me I'm I'm very happy to be here let's go to the Lord now as we begin to turn our attention to him and let's talk to him Heavenly Father Lord we've gathered here this morning as we said Lord with no hope in ourselves Lord not look into anything Lord God that we could possibly say because Lord our words cannot help your people our words Lord God Alone there'd be thoughts of a man Lord God would not benefit this group of people any Lord but your anointing is what breaks the chains lord it's your anointing that comes and speaks to the hearts of your people Lord I believe now that I'm standing in front of a portion Lord God of the people that you bought and paid for with your very blood Lord and and I I recognize the responsibility of that Lord and the weight of that and I pray that you would shut my mouth Lord to not say anything Lord that wouldn't please you Lord I I pray that you would lead and you would guide me and that you would have the preeminence and Lord that you would anoint my tongue to speak freely that which you once spoke to these people this morning Lord Lord because if you don't show up it's a meaningless Gathering of people but Lord if you come Lord lives are changed when you come shackles are broken when you come the sick are healed and Lord we're inviting you Lord not not inviting you hoping but we invite you knowing that you will be here Lord your word promised it your Prophet taught us that you keep all your appointments we thank you for that now as we begin to look to your word I ask that you'll just bless it Lord that you will bless the people that have made the effort to come out today Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you would open your Bibles with me today today we're going to turn to 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 24 9 and verse 24 and it says there we're going to read one verse there and then we're going to go to Second Timothy 4 it says there know ye not that they which run a race in a race run all but one receiveth the priz so run that you may obtain notice one receiveth the prize there's one that he's called out in this day there's one that he's elected there's one bride body of Jesus Christ that's going to receive the prize 2 Timothy 4:7 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them thank you Lord Jesus unto all them that love his appearing I pray the Lord will add His blessings to the word you may be seated this morning I'd like to read a quote here from Brother Bram from how can I overcome in 1963 it says then Dayan raised Dayan rather raised up and so did core and they tried tried to say this man is trying to make himself above all the rest of us he's more holy than the rest of us after God had thoroughly Vindicated the man they said we're we're just a start a we'll start a group of people we'll make this that or the other we'll make our organizations will do and they died and perished but those men had that word of the Lord and they stayed with it and they went over not he that starts he that that finishes many start the race but there's one finishing it there'll be many churches start many groups of people but there'll be one group that finish that's the Overcomers Hallelujah that's the Overcomers and I want to speak to you today on a on a simple thought anointed to finish anointed to finish and and Paul teaches us there in the scripture who it is that gets a reward we we recognize that we're in a battle and the and the scriptures would compare this battle or give us the analogy of it as being a race and Paul tells us that not everybody that runs in this race is going to get a reward not everybody who participates is going to get a reward see the Christian walk isn't like our society today where every single person gets a participation trophy everybody gets something just for signing up um it doesn't matter if you fail it doesn't matter if you fall short it doesn't matter if you win the game here's your trophy and that's what our society has become today and that concept has bled right on over into religious circles it doesn't matter if you're overcoming it doesn't matter if you're defeating the devil you can fall to sin here you can have a little bit of sin in your life there you can do this and then you'll die and the preacher will give you your participation trophy well another Angel went home to be with the Lord today he went to be to get his reward today and we know that in fact this isn't true Paul says if you want to reward you must win if you want to reward you you have to overcome you're not just going to get one because you started the race he said not everybody who runs is going to get a prize listen Paul wouldn't be very popular today Paul said you got to win Paul said there's winners and there's losers and if you don't win you're not going to get your reward if you don't win you're not going to get granted eternal life he says you have to re win you want a reward then win Revelation 3:21 says to him that overcometh overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and and sat down with my father and his throne you have to overcome Hallelujah all right he's exhorting the people in his day he's telling them you got to run you can't quit you got to run it doesn't matter that you started many have started but you today you must run don't stop persevere because this is not about participating come on a halfway ATT attempt a halfway effort is never going to get you a prize look in war two sides fight and at the end of the war the the the country that loses does not get a participation trophy right to the victor goes the spoils to the one that won the battle to the one who came out Victorious they are the ones that will be rewarded and I believe with all my heart I'm looking at those Overcomers today I'm looking at a portion of people that won't quit I'm looking at a portion of people that will not give up because you've been anointed to finish you've been given what you have need of to keep walking in the dark times to keep fighting when all seems lost because you've been anointed for the hour that you live in today we're fighting in the greatest battle ever fought it's a battle for the souls of men it's a battle for your soul it's a battle for your home but not only are we in the greatest battle the last battle but you you've been entrusted with the most difficult part of that battle the closing the last mile The Last Stand the finish and in order to win and in order to overcome you're going to have to be completely 100% sold out because in the in in the midst of this battle it's going to be so difficult and it already is difficult sometimes we've heard hard times are coming hard times are coming and they're coming but they're also here right hard times are amongst us but in the midst of it if you're not completely sold out you will quit if you're not completely sold out you will give in and even if you don't give in and turn and go back as it were you won't run with the perseverance that's needed and therefore you will be overtaken in order to get the reward of the Kinsman today you must be so sold out like we saw with Ruth Ruth came to a new land Ruth left everything behind and when she got there it wasn't just all Rosy it wasn't easy like she had hoped many times we make a change and we think when we get there it's just going to be perfect or we turn a corner and we're going through a trial we turn a corner and we go it's finally over and you looking there's more of this in front of me is there is behind me I must have turned the wrong Corner let me let me look somewhere else but in that moment you got a buckle up in that moment you can't quit she realized it's not easy here I could go back to Moab I could go back to my father's house but she said I'd rather glean right here I'd rather struggle right here I'd rather get my all right here than to ever go back to where I came from than to ever go back to who I was because she sold out and in selling out it got the attention of the Kinsman it got his attention she he said it's been told me all that you've done You' sold out you left it all behind and in a moment she went from gleaning she went from struggling and the next day she owned the field that she was gleaning in the day before when you're sold out that's when you get the reward when you're sold out that's when you get the blessing you're looking for there's no way we can fulfill all that must be done here at the end unless we're sold out and if you haven't sold out you're not going to make it that's not to condemn you that's not to say that's telling you if you hadn't sold out there's time get it done if you hadn't sold out let's get sold out if you hadn't sold out today's the day don't wait another minute but even though hard times are com coming as we said and hard times are here you can have confidence that none of this is a surprise to him none of this has caught him off guard the evil in this day didn't catch him unaware he's not up there going oh my goodness well Satan really caught me with all this I you know I didn't expect it to get that he knew exactly what was coming and he knew exactly what it would take to be Victorious and in that knowing he provided you with exactly what you would need to overcome in this evil day he's provided all we have need of to persevere all the way to the end because God knew you couldn't do this on your own he understood man would fall he already saw what man would do with temptation on their own you see it all down through the Old Testament that even though there was sacrifices made without the nature of that sacrifice being able to come back on a human being they could not live Victorious over sin he knew that which is why he sent back his holy spirit so that that could indwell in us and we we can walk above sin we can overcome sin we can be victorious because we must be victorious in order to get the reward it's not him that runs it's him that is Victorious and you must have that Holy Spirit today in order to be that he knew how difficult this race would be and that's why he's anointed a people a last day people with a Last Day message anointed to run the last leg of the race anointed to finish the last part of the battle we find that that word finish or finished or the phrase to finish has many different meanings one of them can be like I am finished it can mean I I just can't go on I'm finished brother Ben I just can't go on that's not us that's not the definition we're looking for this morning let's move on down I finished can mean completed whether good or bad well I finished it well this also isn't what we're looking for this morning finished can mean done for I'm I'm so finished I'm done for I I'm doomed I'm consumed that's not applicable to us today it can mean to accomplish or to fulfill to bring to a close or to complete and maybe we'll deal with some of these meanings more later but another meaning for the phrase to finish means to close out strong to be a finisher you're someone who will close out strong look we want to finish this race just as strong as we started this race you remember how it was when you got saved and there was a fervency and there was a Zeal and you were running and you were never going to look back but over time struggles and life and things begin to wear you down that's how that's just life but in the midst of that you can't begin to stop you have to recognize I'm called for a purpose I'm chosen for a purpose and I want to finish this just as strong as I started this and the Lord's looking at it the same way he wants his church that started in the book of Acts to finish just as strong over here at the end as where they started he said I he knows how he started his church a friend used to say God started his church the way he wanted it and now he wants his church the way he started it all right we got to get to the point where it's another book of Acts where we're walking around and we're not afraid to face Devils we're not afraid to face sickness we know that when the hands are laid on the sick they shall recover we got to finish the race as strong as they started the race you did run well what hindereth there's been a message that came to turn your heart back to the faith of the fathers what hindereth get a hold of the faith and run today run with everything you have and finish strong we're right here you can see the Finish Line it's not time to slow down we want to be finishers if you'll forgive a few Sports analogies I'm a football coach by trade I teach school and coach football and in the World of Sports certain people certain teams are known as finishers they just seem to have that little something special that little something extra that other it may not even be a talent thing they just have that little something extra that pushes them in the closing moments of races in the closing moments of games or whatever the competition may be when everyone else tenses up when everyone else draws back from that moment of pressure uh when others begin to waver this is when they Shine the brightest this is when they perform the best this is the moment they were made for as it were they know how to finish and and I don't believe that we got down here to the very end of time and God put people here on this Earth that weren't able to finish what he started I believe he's got a the very people handpicked hand selected that he wants here for the moment that is upon us to finish the job to to to win the race as it were to overcome he didn't he didn't come all the way down here and not have confidence in you and the devil wants to come and tell you you're no good and you're a nobody and you're this and you're going to fail I'd like to remind him this morning that God Almighty has confidence in me brother Brandon would say that trial you're going through and the struggle you're going through you're in it because God handpicked you and knew you would overcome it he said God has confidence in you and I'm here to tell you this morning our God has confidence that you will finish the race and you will finish strong and you will finish Victorious and he has a crown awaiting you because of it he has absolute confidence in us because he provided us with the anointing that we need to finish the job not just across the Finish Line church that this bride's not just going to go in barely making it we're not just going to crawl across the finish line and oh we did it and and the Lord stand there going I just didn't know I was hoping I was rooting for you wooo that was close no sir this is going to be a Victorious bride an overcoming bride a bride without spot or wrinkle a bride that can look and say I never did it in the first place his blood cleansed me his blood changed me his blood gave me the power that I needed to overcome in this evil day you're not just going to barely make it you are Overcomers You Are Victorious People you have been hand picked for this time and so many times we recognize the evil around us and brother brand said we talk so much about the evil in the world and all the time we don't recognize how strong the church is getting we talk about how strong the world is listen it's true that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil has reached its height but there's another tree there's a bride tree and it has also reached its height and it's in full power it's in full Glory it has the full anointing it has all the attributes of her of her groom and she's here in full power and she is every bit of match for that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and everything that would come off of it and all the evil in the world you're more than a match quit cing down to it quit bowing down to it you are more than a match you are more than a match you're the one that's bone of his bone you're the one that's flesh of his flesh you're the one that's the final voice to the final age I'm talking to you it's you this morning it's not another age there's not another age coming you can't say they'll finish it you're called to finish you're called to take this across the Finish Line it's you you are a finisher you are a closer so many times we look I'm just a little I'm just I'm just you have been called for this day the closing or the Finish is always the most difficult and the teams that have the ability to finish strong are are teams that realize that you don't win or lose in the first quarter they're they realize and understand that things get more difficult as the game progresses Stakes get higher pressure becomes greater every single mistake you make is magnified greater everything's looked at through a magnifying glass and this sounds just like the day that we're living in right now there has never been an age with so much pressure we know brother Bram spoke on it often and he would call it a neurotic age he says it's just simply a neurotic age that we're living in I it's the time that we're living in pressure we're living in an erotic age nervous tension everybody's racing here going there going nowhere it's just to that kind of age and I know this church would be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it the Tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure as the end of anything near as you find that there's always going to be more and more pressure second Timothy 3 And1 says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come perilous here means dangerous perilous here means hard to bear oh my you look around at the world today brother Ben if we didn't have Jesus it would be more than hard to bear I don't understand how people keep their sanity well well most of them don't so that explains it but what I'm saying is I'd be right there with them I'm no better than them but because we have Jesus because we have this anointed because we've been given an end time message that places us under the safety of his wings that puts us in the Cliff of the rock that tells us in the time of trouble he's going to hide us away it gives us the fortitude and the strength that we need to go on through this time of pressure and to finish the race listen there's no hope today outside of Christ there's no hope outside of Christ I'm telling you if I didn't have Jesus it would tear me apart what are my kids what kind of world are we leaving our kids what kind of country are we leaving our kids there's no hope here there's no hope in your retirement there's no hope in your 401k there's no hope in anything but in the Lord Jesus Christ and I say today run into him run into him with everything you got he's not only hope he is your savior he's your deliverer he's your healer he's your everything he will provide everything you have need of in the closing of time perilous times brother brand said men's hearts are failing for fear perplexed of time distress between the Nations the Earth's getting so nervous till it's bursting from earthquakes everywhere Jesus said it would be that way there'll be earthquakes in diverse places what's the matter the Earth knows she's doomed she's nervous the world's nervous thankfully the quote doesn't stop right there come on but the church is rising in the gospel tucked away with security he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out let me reiterate what I said to you earlier if you're not all the way in yet he's not going to cast you out come on in he's telling you the door's still open I don't know when it'll close but I'm telling you today he's still calling right now he's still calling you got children out there don't give up hope now persevere pray for them hold on to the promise he gave the promise I didn't the door's still open Grace is still open Mercy is still here get in the ark while the door's open all you got to do is look around and you'll realize it's obvious we're at the end you know for years I have a lot of denominational friends that I work with good Christian people with all they know and for years the talk or the concept of the end time wasn't even something they would talk about they would say stuff like oh who knows when he's coming it could be thousand years it could be this and I'd be like no I believe he's coming soon I believe we're in there and that didn't correlate with them but we've gotten to the point where it's gotten so bad so wicked so evil that even my Baptist friends and my Methodist friends are going it's something's happening it's the end of time something's happening he's coming soon and I'm telling you if the foolish virgins are starting to look around for oil where are we brother Ben if they're starting to look around and realize the bridegroom's coming where are we this morning it's time to check up it's time to make your call in an election sure it's time to make sure your lamps are trimmed and bright cuz he's at the door he's at the door right now it's in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed it may be tomorrow it may be a few months from now it may be a few years from now it matters not we're at the door we're at the place where it's making the final sweep calling those in get in get your loved ones in and prepare to go home it's almost over we're at the finish line and you are the finishers the final voice to the final age the last ones running on this canvas of time there'll be no more to come behind us this is it we're there never has there been so much pressure on people of Faith regardless of denomination to the point that they're not wanting to let people people in the Supreme Court cuz they're Catholic and I'm thinking how bad have we gotten when the voice of morality in our country is the Catholic Church where are we on when the when the conservatives that everybody listen to your Shan hannes and Rush Lim balls and all those PE they're Catholics the Supreme Court is packed full of all Catholics and a Jew the Catholic church is in control of our country even now and yet we've got to a place where it's so evil that even those types of people that have any morals whatsoever even a little bit come under attack even a little bit of morality that they come under attack and and many truths from the Bible are now held up as hate speech things you're not listen the reason that is is truth sounds like hate to those who hate truth I know it's a cliche saying but it's the truth truth sounds like hate to those who hate truth and the reason they hate it so much is it EXP ches the lives they live they hate it so much because it brings condemnation to them it amazes me how many times if my wife and I come around people that normally are very talkative or very kind to me and suddenly my wife walks in the room there's a t totally different atmosphere a totally different feeling and there's this stand offness towards her many times not all the time but I tell her I said that that lady she's normally very friendly that guy he's normally very and what it is is there's something there there's a feeling they see that testimony and they know I had a guy tell me the other day he said he said I think I seen some people from your church coming in the restaurant while I was sitting there he said I could tell all the ladies came in and they was dressed like and he paused and he looked down and he said dress like ladies are supposed to dress they know they know but at the root of it all the evil of the a and everything that's come against us and all the persecution all the hatreds towards towards Christianity as a whole at the root of it all is Satan's desire to destroy the bride of Christ at the root of all because listen all the other organizations all the other doctrines of man he's got those in his hand he already controls those and yet the bride is the only place where fresh Revelation still flows and Revelation is what exposes The Works of the Devil Revelation is what gives you the power of overcoming he hates Revelation and so he's after you you have to understand that why am I under attack why are all these things happening well because he's after you and look I hate to give the devil any credit I really do but he's really good at what he does he's good he's studied man for thousands of years he knows you better than you know you many times we're sitting there going I'm strong I can handle that and the devil's over they going no he can't and I know if he keeps flirting with it and he keeps messing with it he's going to fall in temp into temptation he's going to give into that thing he knows you better than you know you he's good at what he does that's why you got to flee from the very appearance of evil that's why you got to get into Jesus Christ more than ever before he's pouring out all the evil he has with one Target in mind you he's after you but I'm here to tell you he's not going to get you because I've read the back of the book I know how the story ends he is not when my enemies Came Upon me they stumbled and they fell they're not going to overtake you they're not going to be victorious you are victorious you're the finishers you're going to get the reward if it's already written I've already read [Music] it Prophet says because man or woman that's ever been in the back of the desert alone like Moses was and the revelation of God be made manifest to him through the Holy Ghost there's nothing can shake him he's just as sound and solid as he can be Satan hates Revelation he don't like it he don't like it at all it upsets his plans because it EXP ches his plans listen he's battled for thousands of years and let me tell you why he hates you because he's tried everything he's burned him at the steak he's put him in the lon's den he's brought it down and created an Eden and he loves his Eden but he hates you because in the midst of his Eden there is a woman in the midst of his Eden there is a bride without spot without wrinkle she won't defile herself she won't give in and he hate you to the point that one day he's going to look at you like Pharaoh said he said get out take take your children take your health take your sanity and get out of my Eden we're going to live such an overcoming life where Satan himself is sick of looking up waking up in the morning looking out the window and going she's still here she hasn't caved she hasn't fallen and I'd like to tell him tonight we're not going to because we are anointed to finish baseball teams have something called a closer they come in at the very end when the pressure is the greatest to close out the game no matter the situation no matter if the bases are loaded and everything looks bad come on in and that guy don't look around and go him you want him oh me okay most of the time if you've ever seen a baseball game those guys come running out of the Dugout full speed they're excited oh he called me in the game he wants me to come finish this out I'm the guy look he's calling you this morning come on in come on in the game quit looking around going who who you want he's talking to you he wants you in the game he wants you to finish the race he wants you to give the devil a black eye he wants you to be victorious over this he's calling your name this morning come on in you say that's not that's not me brother Aaron I'm not a closer I'm I'm not a finisher I get nervous I get shook up things bother me I'm not ready for that pressure you're more ready than you know every message you've ever heard every song you've ever sang Come on every prayer you've ever prayed you've been training for this moment I got to give I got to give credit where that came from many of y'all have heard the testimony of sister atanta buts and when she got her diagnosis of cancer her family didn't no just her and her husband she said Gather the family together so she gathers them together and she sits down in the midst of them and it wasn't a pity party it wasn't a woe as me she had just just been diagnosed with stage four Hotchkins Lymphoma and she looked at her family and she said it's our turn she said other people have had their turn now it's our turn she said every service we've ever been in every message we've ever heard every song we've ever sang has been leading us and preparing us for this moment I heard that and I'm like it made me feel so little I'm like can can you imagine sitting there telling your kids I'm not worried about this this is what we're built for this is what we're made for this is what we've been trained it's easy to go I'm praying for you brother I'm praying for you brother but what about when it's your turn what about when you've been called into the game what about when he says now it's your turn to overcome this you must remember I am called and I am Chosen and I've been called for a Time such as this to overcome this enemy we always say every devil in hell is going to be called conquered who's going to do it who's going to Conquer Cancer if somebody don't face cancer who's going to conquer depression if somebody don't face depression but when you face it you will win you will overcome because you've been training and you're more ready than you even know and Satan doesn't want you to know you know that the thing that one quote it's very familiar brother Bram says that if she comes to the true revelation of the true church and who she is and what she stands for but the beginning of that quote is it says Satan knows he knows that if you get that Revelation see he already knows and he wants to keep you from knowing so he piles this trial on you and he Pils this on you make bricks without straw don't let them recognize they're more and mightier than we make them do this change the tient make them work harder make them work late make them do this bring stress bring trials bring this and don't let them know cuz if they recognize who she is if they know who they are then the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against them so he knows and he wants to keep you from knowing all the things that he does is to keep you from recognizing who you are well I'm not that I'm not that listen David didn't think he could kill a line until he had to kill a Lon yeah come on David had never was known as a bear killer until he had to kill a bear he was ready and didn't even know it he didn't know he could kill Goliath till he got got tired of hearing Goliath's calls and bows and had to walk out on that field you may not know you can defeat cancer till you're face with it you may not know you can overcome anxiety till you're faced with it but you're more ready than what you realize because you've been anointed for the moment David was anointed for the moment you don't often know what kind of Faith you have till you have to put your faith in action and when you're faced with an obstacle God is always going to give the anointing that you need to not only to face that enemy but to destroy that enemy prophet of God says and father today we stand here by your grace and it's not because that we're a special people but it's because just like the day of the lion or the ox or the man it's Eagle time it's the anointing of the hour it's the time that we're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead the things that he said that he would do just before the evening lights went out that for this right here it works for me awesome it's the anointing of the hour in other words it's not the same anointing that Luther had it's not the same anointing that Wesley had it's a special anointing for this hour you say I don't always feel anointed sign me up in that club too I think we're all in that club I don't always feel anointed listen it wasn't like David went out there to kill Goliath with anointing or like dripping off his locks and running down his face and I'm anointed it had happened a long time before that but he had faith in the anointing that had been given him he wasn't walking out there with anointing oil dripping down into his sandals you're not always going to feel the anointing but a prophet had brought him a message and a prophet had told him you're going to be king and a prophet had told him you're going to sit on the throne and he trusted in the message that the prophet had given him listen you've been anointed under a message and told you're going to rule and Reign David was anointed and told that he was going to rule and Reign he trusted his anointing and so therefore he took down his Goliath today you got to trust in the anointing in the message that's been given you he's already seen you going up when others went down I'm going to trust in that so anything between here and there is not consequential to me I know I'm going to defeat it I know I'm going to over com it those things don't matter cuz I've already been told and seen in a vision hallu hallu you know Saul didn't have that same kind of Faith I've always thought you know they were under the same Covenant they had all been called to destroy Philistines I believe that any man in that Army could have walked out into that Valley and he would have been Victorious now the anointing gave that he had received was special and because of that anointing he had the faith he needed to go but any one of those men that would walked out there as a as a seat of Abraham as a circumcised seat of Abraham and stood against an uncircumcised Philistine would have overcame and would have been Victorious but they didn't have the courage to go what gave David the courage to go he had been anointed so we got to quit chiring in our tense we got to quit hiding back there like Saul we got to quit looking for somebody else to do it you were anointed you were anointed and somebody's got to answer the call today he's standing there still in Joy he's walking in your Valley saying I've taken your joy I'm taking your children I'm taking your Victory somebody's going to get tired of it somebody's going to have HT enough and somebody's going to walk into the valley somebody's going to walk down there and fight I never forget when I found out brother Ron Spencer had cancer I texted him just a few words of encouragement and let him know I was praying for him and a few things and he wrote back a very simple phrase but it was so powerful to me he said Goliath has shown up now we fight Church Goliath has showed up in your life Goliath has showing up around churches all over the message he's showing up in your homes it's time we fight it's time you come out your tent and say I'm coming into the valley to claim what's mine listen he was walking back and forth on Israelite land on land that had been given them by God promises given them by God and they stood and they watched it but brother Bram said one day there was a different set of ears in the camp there was a new set of ears in the camp and I pray today there's ears today that won't listen to it that won't tolerate it that won't stand back and let Goliath take what's theirs go into the valley this morning you're anointed for it Lord You're anointed for itall we must finish you know the anointing is a subject that could be ministered on over and over and over again You' never cover the vastness from many different angles and I know this is a very narrow definition but for the sake of today the anointing is the power and Leadership of the Holy Spirit given for a specific purpose the anointing is the power and Leadership of the Holy Spirit given for a specific purpose the anointing we speak of it in general terms but it's not a general thing it's very specific for your need and for the moment we Face many different things we have many different task and so there are many different types of anointings there's anointings to preach uh there's anointings to pray for the sick and cast out devils devils there's anointings to prophesy brother Brown many times would speak about the different anointings he would say things like this I've been preaching and then well usually the manager does the preaching and then I just come out under the anointing and I can stand longer quicker faster but this is a different anointing one is preaching the word and the other is working a gift Same Spirit two different manifestations he would say now if the Lord willing Wednesday night I'm going to try to come to the pull pit without speaking just come let brother Bale Bale or someone else to speak so we can just well I like for you to see the difference in the meeting see it's preaching is one anointing there's a prophetic gift something altogether different Same Spirit but different anointing so I say all that to let you understand that the anointing you're under in this age is a special different anointing it's just not some general anointing that was poured out through the seven Church ages we read in the Bible that there's the lion anointing there's an ox anointing There's the Man anointing and the eagle anointing see God is not just some kind of a general God like some people make him out to be that just is watching from above going well I'll give some goodness here and a little bit of this here and that denominational thinking of of what Christian what God is like but he's very concerned about your life and he gives very specific things for you for you to overcome he prepares exactly what it is needed for each person for each age for each day all the way down for each moment and and when God has sent you he has equipped you for the exact task that he knows that you're going to face so back to what we said yes it's a time of stress yes it's a time of great pressure and yet that's why we're under an eagle anointing because when the the pressure is down you can spread those wings when it's trying to hold you down you can rise up above all that pressure Eagles can fly in places that other birds can't Eagles can see things that other birds can't Eagles can rise above the storms when other birds are knocked down by those storms and church today I'm telling you operate in the anointing that you have been given you've been given it so spread your wings this morning quit being pushed down the devil's not going to quit pushing you down but you got to start flapping the wings they'll work they'll operate they'll do what they were intended to do and that's to raise you up above all these Earthly pressures and things look the church is seen in the Book of Revelation as a cage of every unclean and hateful bird but let me tell you what it didn't see there it didn't see Eagles there it didn't see Eagles there because they weren't trapped on the ground they weren't sitting ducks they were flying in the heavens but bathed in Revelation bathed in an anointing an anointing that is going to allow them to overcome this day Hallelujah because they're soaring in a different anointing brother Bram says his little eaglets those that are born of him and I made this little illustration many times on that how the eagle gets her little ones ready to fly and takes them up in the air and turns them loose and if a trow a crow tried to get up there every feather would fall out of him he's not pressurized to it see he couldn't stand the pressure but the Eagle's the only Bird born with that kind of a Feather that can go so high till a Halk couldn't come around him and he's got eyes and the higher you go the further you can see and what good would it do him to get up there if he didn't have eyes to see way away he couldn't see back where he come from and that's the only way that's the way with a Christian some of the people maybe got a buzzard disposition well we're not going to go down that road you it's amazing how you can come out and preach on Jesus and Judas and a lot of people come out going he called me Judas see they have a buzzard disposition they're looking at it through the eyes of the accuser instead of looking at it through the eyes of what the word says about them and that's all your disposition is is how you look at things start looking at everything through this word right here quit looking at yourself through the eyes and and through the filter of what the accuser says about you because he's not going to tell you anything good he's not going to tell you you know what brother men I think you're right I think you are going to make it he's never going to say that to you till the day you Rapture I tell you I don't Rapture morning I believe he's going to be sitting there Whispering saying you're sry Sor you're not going to make it you're not going to all sudden I'm going to go and he's going go he made it that's when he might say he made it is the day I disappear right in front of his very face because he's not going to leave you alone that's why you've been granted this anointing some people have a buzzard disposition eating the things of the world and the vultures and try to fly up there with an eagle he blows up there's too much pressure you got to be made for it so you are anointed and made for the pressure of the end time you were created and placed here for this time specifically for such a time as this and what I really want you to see today is that in reality you have nothing to fear because you've already made it you've already been seen making it every single thing in the Arsenal of God is at your disposal he didn't send you into battle and go my goodness here you know what I take this no he gave you everything but you got to put it on you got to put on the whole armor of God you got to take the weapons at your disposal you got to use the word you have nothing to fear because the word of God the weapon you've been given will defeat the Devil any place anytime anywhere under any circumstances so whatever circumstances you find yourself in today that is covered in the word any little bitty word lots of stuff fits in there whatever you're facing is covered in the word any any place anywhere anytime any circumstances take your weapon cut his head off walk in Victory and continue towards the Finish Line that's what you're called and anointed to do today Hallelujah don't allow Satan to distract you and get your eyes and focus on the negative things of the age as far as I'm concerned I don't care what your source is it's all fake news it's not my future it's not my calling it's not what I've been put here to do it doesn't concern me this age and all it's evil and everything that's going on it's not part of my purpose I'm not saying that not to be aware of what's going on those things many times are landmarks in the word of God that show you where you're at but it's not to become your focus it's not to become your diet because if those things become your focus it actually will bring you under a different anointing those things have an anointing that go with them it's an anointing of fear it's an anointing of anxiety it's an anointing of worry and and how things how bad things are and how are my kids ever going to make it how are my kids going to overcome and instead of looking at this you begin to look at how the things around you you begin to look at the waves what those things are are the waves that made Peter take his eyes off of Jesus those things are the waves just keep your eyes on Jesus just keep walking just take another step I'm in the middle of a trial don't stop in the trial take another step keep walking because pretty soon you're going to be hand in hand with the Lord Jesus Christ and then what does that trial matter then what does that fear matter it's over with it's silence it's finished we've been anointed by the pillar of fire returned to the church once again for what purpose for the finishing up of all things brother brandham says then there will come a message oh Hallelujah we know that that same Pillar of Fire that led Israel we know that the same Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by that Pillar of Fire that had him anointed is accompanying the church today science has proved it we don't need that God's proved it we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit The Headstone coming under that's brought the church into a place where the ministry is exactly like it was when Jesus left left exactly he says oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all the theologies failed to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant after the doors to the Gentiles is closed oh God will anoint a church then he who's filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous still he who's holy let him be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taking place not only then he's doing it now you need to recognize right now he's a living God right now he's in this building right now he's come to deliver you and set you free and give you what you have need of in your life right now this moment don't put off till tomorrow don't look back to yesterday he's here now you Lord the pillar of fire has never anointed somebody for defeat when you've been anointed by the pillar of fire you're anointed to overcome every unclean and foul Spirit you're anointed to overcome every depression and every Spirit of the age you're anointed to overcome everything that the devil can throw look we can't even name them all 200 thousand thousand I mean I can't tell you what they're all named but I know they fit in any I know they fit in all and I know you've been given an anointing to overcome any and all that the devil can throw at you in this last day you have been anointed to close out the to to close out the ages brother brandom said the train is in the blocks they'll get hat and left but the Train's in the blocks it's time to get on board it's time to sell out 100% I'm going look just a second back in Revelation 10:7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished see this message that called your name is a finishing message it's a message to finish with it's what placed you in this last day it's what brought you the fin fining anointing that you need and that means that it gives you the power to destroy or overcome anything between you and the Finish Line anything that stands between you and what you've been called to do God has already given you the power to overcome that any Affliction any power of Hell any doubt any fear any circumstances that's between here and there quit worrying about it and quit building it up look I understand it's human nature to see something we don't look at things and go yes woohoo look at this sickness could wait for this one no no I'm not I'm not asking to be that that's not what I'm saying I'm saying don't see it and coward down don't see it and buckle don't see it and begin to weep look you read the first chapter of job and it's absolutely astounding to me there's a key there to overcoming in your trials because it it's a messenger comes and all your ox and sheep are dead and burned and servants killed another one came camels are dead this is everything one after another after another then they came and said your children are dead and it says job fell on his face and worshiped he didn't fall in his face and say woe is me why me he didn't put on a sad face and walk around for six months so everybody would know he was depressed and say brother are you okay no the key to overcoming in the trial is he fell on his face and he worshiped he said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord so what I'm saying is when that trial comes and it's coming you may already be in it but look at it and say I may not can do this on my own but I've been anointed for this I've been called for this and I will overcome this I'm going to praise him in my storm I'm going to bless his name in my storm I'm going to give him my everything in the midst of the storm because I will conquer this you know Billy Sundy had also been a great baseball player and he's quoted as saying stopping at third base adds no more to the score than striking out stopping at third base adds no more to the score than striking out it doesn't matter how well you start if you fail to finish Paul said I finished henceforth a crown awaits me look we know we're at the end time and thinking about it as a track and the way they run around the track we've rounded the last curve as it were we're on the final straightaway and this is the time believe it or not in those moments that we're most likely to lose our Focus our natural human Tendencies is often to compromise our level of Excellence as time passes by we let down our guard we become Things become common to us as it were we become comfortable our calling becomes common we start to take things for granted research shows that on heavy industry projects and Military campaigns there is generally an increase in accidents and incidents towards the end this has put down to human factors such as is a loss of focus loss of leadership and a compromise a compromised team approach as distractions and sometimes disillusionment begins to creep in listen this is no time to be disillusioned this is no time to lose your focus it's no time to be distracted this is a time more than ever to be feeding on the word of God it's a time more than ever to turn your eyes away from the waves turn your eyes away from the distractions to get your family together have prayer time it's a time more than ever to have a family altar it's a Time more than ever when you come to the house of God to enter in and to worship and to praise and to give God your everything you know we say all the time that that where two or three are gathered he's there with us and I wonder sometimes truly in the depths of your soul do you believe that he's in this building right now walking up and down the aisles of this congregation because sometimes I look at people and I say if you believe it if that's how you're going to react when the literal Corporal body of the Lord Jesus is walking past you I doubt you believe it right now because we'll sit there and go amazing and you're telling me you believe the Lord Jesus is next to you you believe he's in this building I think sometimes we just take things it becomes common look I'm guilty I'm not trying to point fing I'm saying that our Humanity gets in the way of the reality that the Lord Jesus Christ is in this place that he's with you that he'll leave here with you he'll be with you on Monday he'll be with you on Tuesday and not only on Wednesday and Sunday should you praise him but your life should praise him your life should worship Him life should cry out thank you Lord Jesus for the grace in my life thank you Lord Jesus for all that you've done for me and for my family but especially when we gather together and have the opportunity let your voices ring out with all you have let your songs be from the depths of your soul let your worship come from a place of recognizing I know what I was I know what I am I know what he's done for me if he saved you you can worship if he's delivered you you can worship Hallelujah quit sitting there Bound by the weight of chains are already broken let those hands go up and praise almighty God and thank him for what he's done for you Lord let your focus get back on him he's not looking at what you can do he sees what he can do through youall and many times we're limiting him because we're saying I can't do that he's saying I know I get it he saying I want you to yield to me and let me show you what I can do with you many times we're asking Lord how can I do this Lord why me Joshua 1:9 have I not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest Isaiah 41 and10 fear not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen Thee I will help Thee I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteous see God is not expecting you to do this on your own God's not dropping you here and saying good luck he said I'm going to do it I'm going to be with you I'm going to go before you I'm going to drive out the enemy I'm going to do it I'm going to do it and it's time that we just allow him to do it it's time that we just rest in the promise it's time that we just put it all in his hands say Lord I'm casting all my C on you I know you love me Lord here take this I can't handle it he says I know Child come on I'll Lead You Through the Fire I'll take you through the trial and as long as he's in front of me I'll follow him anywhere we'll go through hell but I'll come out Victorious because he has never lost a battle brother Bram said I've never seen him go into a battle once and he didn't come out packing the victory so this morning Lord I got battles I need Victory so I'm putting them on your shoulders I'm walking with you this morning you got to give it all to him though he's not expecting you to do it all on your own but he's provided every step of the way he's dropping handfuls on purpose he's giving you what it is you need but many times we think oh well only the ministers are anointed well only the singers get anointed and and you know what anointing should come on a minister anointing should come on a singer who sings in church those things are true ano should come on the musicians and church those are sting certain anointings given for the task that they are to accomplish but a Believer a Believer lives under the anointing of God they are LED of God they are strengthened of God they overcome daily by God they live under the Holy Spirit anointing of the age that they live in every believer should be walking under an anointing it's not just for preachers deacons singers so those people they have a specific anointing but you're anointed you're anointed for the task you're going to face on Monday morning you're anointed for the task you're going to face on Tuesday and the task on Thursday it's easy to feel the anointing in church but what do you do next Tuesday when you're hitting the face on all right you got to trust in that anointing and lean on it lean not to that own understanding recognize I was made for this I am anointed in this and knowing this allows us to stand firm in the face of Satan it allows many times we don't feel strong enough to do it but you need to stand Toe to Toe look him in the face that you have no right to me you have no right to me every right you ever had was broke at Calvary your back was broke at Calvary you were stripped of everything you ever had at Calvary you have no right to me and then furthermore I'm anointed it's actually a p a principle of Deliverance and it's a principle of Divine Healing the word of God tells the enemy to touch not mine anointed listen that's not talking about just preachers you are the anointed of God you're the anointed in this age and the word tells him take your hands off the Bride of Jesus Christ take your hands off my people you have no right to touch them touch not my anointed there's a word that tells Satan to take his hands off it's for you well I need a quote for that got one come on and may we buckle up the armor of God just a little tighter tonight go forward in battle tomorrow where right and wrong is engaged may we not fear as we go but know that the Morning Star is shining over us and if God be for us who shall be against us for who shall touch the anointed of the Lord may that be the consolation of every believer Grant it Lord who here's a Believer who here is a Believer then you can look at the Devil this morning and say back off I'm the anointed of the Lord and you have no rights to my home my family my children my health you have no right to any of it because I've been anointed for a purpose you must recognize what you've been called for recognizing what you've been called for gives you courage in the battle it gives you faith knowing that you're where God placed you you never want to get neck deep in the middle of battle and wonder am I out of the will of God that's not a fun place to be many of us have found our place ourselves there before but when you seek his will constantly you seek his favor constantly and when you recognize when you come to a battle when you come to the Red Sea you realize because I'm following the will of God he brought me here so if he brought me to this place he's going to take me through this place because I know I'm in his favor I know I'm in his will and I know I've been called for this very moment so it's important to recognize your calling so you don't come up against a giant and go I took a wrong turn no but your command this morning is to go forward Onward Christian Soldier slay the enemy slay the giant because you're called to it recognize your calling know what you're here for brother Brown said you know you have need of it you know if you're going to take these children over to that Promised Land that's exactly you're pinned up here in a corner there ain't nothing else you can do so there's a need what are you crying to me about what are you looking at me for what are you calling on me about haven't I proved it to the people hasn't he proved himself to us hasn't he healed Our Sick saved our lost delivered the bound he's proved it to us haven't I proved it to you haven't I called it isn't it scriptural didn't I promise to take this people and go to that land didn't I call you and tell you I would do it didn't I call and say I had sent you to do it that it wasn't you it's me and I'd go down and I'd be with your lips and whatever you said I'd vindicate and prove it haven't I done it listen Church he's never failed us he's done everything he said he would do will you say well I'm waiting on God to speak to me directly you might wait a long time I'm not saying he won't but many times that's a cop out for people that don't want to move well until God speaks lip to ear to me that don't just happen every Tuesday and you got to overcome tomorrow you you got to overcome Tuesday and Wednesday you got to be ready to move you say I'm just waiting for God to speak to me directly I need a vision I need thus sayith the Lord Brother brandom said he was anointed for the job and he was still waiting for thus sayith the Lord God must have got enough of it and said Don't Cry Anymore speak I sent you oh God what this church ought to be doing this morning with God's perfect Vindication with the pillar of fire and the signs and the Wonders everything just like it was before the days of Sodom he said he would return it back and he's telling you this morning haven't I called you for the job haven't I anointed you for the job why cry onto me this morning speak what you have need of I believe therefore I speak if you believe speak it this morning speak that your children are coming back speak that your healing is yours speak that the devil is defeated those things were given you but who's going to fight for them you arej I can't always be there to fight for your children you got to fight for it you got to fight for it and put it in the hands of God and trust in him and don't look at circumstances you talk about circumstances you know I thought about it one time the circumstances that the parents of the thief yeah and we think they're too far gone do you know what a reunion that must have been that day they thought he died a sinner he died a thief he went straight to hell but there was a time where there was a reunion went on and they said how did this happen how because there was a promise because there was a word because there was a story of a prodical that came home it didn't say he came home this time this time or this time it said they're coming home it said that th and thy house will be there so hold to that hold to that it doesn't matter what you see they never saw their son saved but he was there they never saw him delivered but he made it because he had an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ Lord hold on to every promise those things are given for you and in this last age they're just as good as they've ever been he said it Lord he told you to speak the word he said the works that I do shall you do also you Lord we've been anointed in this last day to tear Satan's King Kingdom down and we're not finished there's work for us to do and yet we know exactly what it is we know what we have to do we know what we're called for we're not finished yet but Satan's about to be yeah his end is just before us brother brandham said Joshua was anointed to take the land for for God and for his people the day was short he needed more time for the job that he was anointed and commissioned to do he needed more light the sun was going down he didn't fall on his knees and say Lord God what shall I do what shall I do he spoke he had a need he said Son stand still he didn't cry to nothing he commanded son stand still I've got a need of this I'm the servant of the Lord anointed for this job Samson anointed raised up ordained of God given a gift of power was ordained to destroy the nation of the Philistines ordained born on the Earth anointed of God to destroy the Philistines and one day they caught him out in the field without his sword without a spear and a thousand of those armored Philistines run up himm at one time did he get down and say oh Lord I Need A Vision oh Lord what must I do direct me now what should I do he knowed what he had need he found nothing but an old Jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines amen he never cried to God he used his anointed gift he's anointed for the work and there's nothing can harm you know not one thing look you may be in the midst of the field this morning and you may be surrounded and you can't find anything but if you can just reach down and pick up one promise of God just one promise I am the Lord thy God that heals all my diseas you can go to whooping Devils whooping Philistines you can whoop yourself a path clear out of there to every single one of them destroyed look they're laying right here just reach down and pick one up I'm surrounded this morning just pick one up all it takes is one it'll defeat every devil in hell this morning but you got to reach down and pick it up I think the devil ought to know today that we're anointed for a specific work anointed to do the works of my father anointed to finish the works of him that sent me and I will finish I've been seen Victorious over sin I've been seen ascending and a Rapture then like I've already said anything between here and there doesn't matter I've already been seen doing it look Paul had that Revelation Paul received that Revelation in Acts 23 he's told you're going to go preach in Rome so once he was told that shipwreck didn't matter come on shipwreck didn't matter famine didn't matter snake bite didn't matter he knew what he was called and anointed to do none of those things mattered because he was told you're going to preach in Rome you've been told by Vindicated Prophet messenger that you're going in a Rapture you've been told there was a vision that saw you going up when others went down you've been told that you will overcome that you will sit on the throne so none of this other stuff matters you are called to defeat Shake It Off in the fire this morning Shake It Off in the fire stay with the ship just stay with the ship he said if they'll just stay with the ship all will be saved stay with the ship this morning there's a lot jumping here and jumping there stay with the ship don't go overboard don't go overboard this message will see you through you've been seen in a vision you've been anointed for the moment this stuff doesn't matter shake it off this morning in the fire I'm surrounded this morning that just means more Devils got to die there's 10,000 against that just means the body counts about to get heavy that's nothing to fear this morning you're anointed to finish every single trial you face look you may not even be aware of it yet there may be sickness in your future you're anointed to defeat it you're anointed to overcome that there's fear in your life you're anointed to cast it out there's anxiety you're anointed to rise over it there's depression you're anointed to defeat it those things weren't given to defeat you they were given so you could defeat them so this morning lay those things aside cast them down and run the race we're on the last lap this morning he said brother Aaron I've been running for a long time I've been running for years years I've been fighting a good fight but I'm getting tired and some of the battles that some of you face I can't even comprehend we get tired we get worn down we get scarred I just need a moment I need to stop for a minute Catch My Breath look we all get worn down and maybe I'm not near as worn down as you are but you can't stop for a minute you can't stop even for a second you can't stop to catch your breath you must not stop let me tell you why we're not the only ones on the track we're not the only ones running this morning the hounds of Hell have been released on the same track and they're running too and they're coming too and they're running hard and they're on your Trail you can't stop even for a minute to catch your breath stopping this morning church is not an option stopping is not an option just keep going just take another step it's hard I know take another step it's hard I'm in the middle of the worst try to just take another step just keep walking I think about our Lord looking up at Calvary knowing what he was going to go through but he would just take another step he'd take another he knew what was coming but for you he took another step I'm telling you this morning that anointing has come back on you he was the great finisher he said it is finished and now you have that same anointing bone of his bone bride of his bride called here placed here to finish take another step this morning take another step Don't Stop in this you can't stop but I can't go on you can people who people who play sports and run and do those those things they know there's a phenomenon known as a second win scientifically a second win they would say the definition is a phenomenon in distance running such as marathons whereby an athlete who is out of breath too tired to continue suddenly finds the strength oh Lord Jesus suddenly finds the strength to press on at top performance for a longer period of time listen it didn't say he finds the strength to struggle on he finds the strength to continue at top performance just as good as he was at the beginning just as strong as he was at the beginning suddenly there's a second wind that begins to come down listen there's one filling but there's many refilling when you need a second win when you're struggling just ask for it he'll give it and then you'll be going to tend you on at top performance just like you did at the very beginning just when you begin to wear down there's a special anointing for you a time of refreshing that comes from the Lord a second win a refilling a recharging than you oh church let the wind of the Holy Spirit just blow through this place and give you the refreshing you need the recharge you need the second win you need because there's more to go there's more race to run but you're not getting a break there's nobody taking your place you got to do it you got to do it so Lord send a second win send me a refreshing send your Holy Spirit this morning thank you Lord you who are tired you who are weary you who are worn down in the battle you can press on you can fight another day thank you Lord oh my Lord the enemy closing in from every side you're surrounded he sees you struggling he sees your struggles that's why he comes at you hardest when you're struggling he sees the struggle and he begins to close in like wolves circling for a kill he sees you struggling along and he says oh I got her she's slowing down she's going to stop I got her oh look at him I got him his faith is weak he's struggling oh I got her she's gave up hope anxiety is starting to take hold he's getting closer and closer and he's creeping in but all of a sudden there comes a sound from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty Wind and that enemy is getting closer and closer and he hears that sound he says I've heard that before I've heard that sound before I know what that sound is and in a moment just like that he will scatter back when the power of the Holy Spirit comes and renews you and refreshes you because one day you're barely moving but you're moving and the next minute you're running in strength and in a perfect stride and overcome it because you caught a second win you caught a refreshing and he's here today to pour one out for you if you need it and we all need it Lord I'm asking for it today pour out a second win pour out a refreshing pour out a refilling I need you today lord the devil seems to be closing in but I won't stop I'm taking another step I'm going forward and I know I'm going to overcome I've been called for it I've been anointed for it for this time and this moment H anointed to finish you Lord I'm bringing this down to a close now many have started brother Ben somebody's going to finish on that day there's not going to be one person remembered or or commend commended for how they started how'd you finish how'd you finish it's going to get harder at the end it always does I'm not here with Doom and Gloom but it's not going to get easier there's rough Seas ahead there's rough Seas ahead brother brandom said when the disciples was in that boat the devil was on every wave telling him he was going to destroy but in the midst of that Jesus came walking say it's going to get more difficult the waves are going to get higher but he's walking on the water this morning Satan knows that this is the very end he knows that his time is short and so he's sending everything he's got all he has we've reached the End of Time the end of the race as it were and the last lap is the hardest but forgive me once again I'm also a track coach the last laps the hardest but it's the most exciting of the whole race the last event of the track meet is the relay the mile relay where you run and then you pass the Baton then you run you pass the Baton that race is exciting but it's the last lap of that race that brings the excitement you know why because everybody puts their best Runners last the best Runners are on the TR did you know you're the best he has you are the best best he has that's why he put you here that's why he placed you here but you're running against the best Satan has don't stop don't slow down you're the best God's got that's why you've been called to be the anchor leg I can see it's amazing you see them around that final curve and those people have been sitting there for two hours all a sudden start standing up the grand stands begin to start standing up and suddenly there's thousands of people standing and it's a close race people are cheering they're cheering the cloud of witnesses is on their feet this morning church you've come around the final curve you're on the last straightaway as it were now you've run a strong race you've run a strong race but the other Runners are doing all they can trying to catch you and every time you seem weak in your lap something else has come upon you and giv you strength to go again a special anointing gave you strength to press on there you are I see you coming around the final curve come around the curve headed for the Finish Line every one of them's risen to their feet and I can hear their cheers press on WE without you are not made perfect keep running defeat that devil overcome that cancer Cast Away that depression run run the other Runners are behind you keep running you're anointed for this go go run and they're on their feet and they're cheering and they're screaming run run run and you're running with everything you have and a second anointing is going to come upon you and you're in full stride you're running the best you've ever ran you're finishing stronger than you even started you're running you're running and it all begins to fade from View and all I see is the Finish Line all I see is Jesus all I see is Jesus and his arms are open and I'm running straight to him this morning I'm running with all I got and you're running with all you got and you've been anointed to fit it the job huj so let's run this morning lay aside everything and run we're at the end we're at the Finish Hallelujah we've caught another wind thank you Lord we've caught the second wind another outpouring of the Holy Spirit oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus father we love you this morning God Lord how we love you and how we thank you for that anointing Lord that you've poured out in our lives Lord where would we be without you lord we're here in the closing moments of time and the world's gone insane the world's losing their mind but we've been anointed oh Lord when the enemies come upon us you've had hid Us in the Clift of the rock you've caused them to stumble and fall and you've given us strength to run Lord may we not grow weary let us Mount up with wings this morning Lord as an eagle Lord pressures at an all-time high Lord but there's a people called and ordained and made to deal with the pressure Lord we thank you Lord we love you Lord I ask you that anybody here Lord

and it allows you not to only go through this age but to overcome this age not to just crawl in but to run in stronger than even when you started look not everybody can close out an age but you can not everybody can be the finisher you've been handed the Baton you were seen you you were seen taking it over there in Revelation 10 he handed it to you it's in your hands and there's nobody for you
