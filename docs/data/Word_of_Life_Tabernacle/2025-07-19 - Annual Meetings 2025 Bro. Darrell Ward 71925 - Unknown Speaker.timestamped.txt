[35:33] believe he can do it?
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Josh is going to take
[35:35] these needs to the Lord this evening.
[35:41] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful Lord to be
[35:44] gathered together once again. And Lord,
[35:46] what a privilege and honor it is to be
[35:48] able to come. You said, Lord, for us to
[35:50] come to the throne of mercy, Lord. Lord,
[35:54] that we could come and bring our
[35:55] petitions and our needs. And Lord, we're
[35:58] approaching you as our father. And Lord,
[36:00] we know, God, that Lord, that you said
[36:03] if we'd ask, Lord, that you'd give it to
[36:05] us. And if we would knock that you would
[36:07] open it up. And so, Lord, we're coming
[36:09] and we're asking and we're knocking. And
[36:12] Lord, we're believing, Lord. We just
[36:14] pray that tonight that every need would
[36:16] be supplied, that the sick would be
[36:17] healed, Lord. That every life would be
[36:20] touched. I pray, God, that maybe there's
[36:22] some here tonight that's oppressed.
[36:24] Lord, I pray that they would be
[36:25] delivered. And Lord, maybe there's some
[36:27] with hard questions. But God, I think
[36:29] about how at one time, Lord, there was a
[36:31] queen that heard of the wisdom of
[36:33] Solomon and she traveled from a great a
[36:36] far distance. And Lord, when she come,
[36:38] she come with hard questions, Lord. But
[36:41] her testimony was that the half had not
[36:43] been told. And I believe that are
[36:45] greater than Solomon is here tonight.
[36:47] Lord, there might be hard questions. But
[36:49] Lord, I believe that the half has not
[36:51] been told of the things that you can do.
[36:53] Lord, you can do exceeding abundantly
[36:55] above all that we can ask or think. And
[36:58] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that you've
[37:00] given us that revelation, God, to know,
[37:02] Lord, in this day that you are in fact
[37:05] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[37:07] Lord, you sent a message, Lord. It it it
[37:10] brought you out of history. The God of
[37:12] the Bible has been made real. And Lord,
[37:14] our faith has been ignited to believe
[37:17] for the impossible. And we thank you for
[37:19] these things. Have your way in this
[37:21] service now. Anoint the man of God.
[37:23] Speak through his lips. I pray, oh God,
[37:25] that your word would be in his mouth as
[37:28] a flame of fire. And I pray, God, that
[37:30] you'd make every heart in this build
[37:32] building kindling tonight. and Lord that
[37:34] it would just ignite our hearts and we
[37:37] would leave here burning blazes Lord
[37:39] with a testimony burning in our lives in
[37:41] our hearts. Grant it Lord we ask and we
[37:44] ask it in the precious name of Jesus
[37:46] Christ. Amen.

[37:54] I come into his presence
[37:59] I humble myself.

[57:09] got on my mind is flying.
[57:12] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[57:18] kind.
[57:20] Yeah. While others think of dying, all
[57:25] I've got on my mind is life. I repeat,
[57:30] that's the nature of the eagle kind.

[1:03:39] If you stand to your feet,
[1:03:46] I
[1:03:50] wonder if we could sing this and then
[1:03:51] Brother Colby will sing a song to bring
[1:03:53] Brother Daryl out on. I want to just
[1:03:55] sing this one here first. And I want to
[1:03:58] say this. We're under great expectation
[1:04:00] for tonight.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I walked in the building
[1:04:04] a little bit ago and uh right before the
[1:04:06] service and and prophet was standing
[1:04:08] there in the prayer line on deep calls
[1:04:10] to the deep and I could see the people
[1:04:12] when he said stand to your feet
[1:04:13] everywhere. I saw the people standing
[1:04:15] with their hands in the air and just
[1:04:17] responded. I thought you know what
[1:04:19] there's expectation in the building
[1:04:20] tonight
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; and you'll get what you expect. That's
[1:04:23] right. You believe that? How many needs
[1:04:25] a miracle tonight?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I believe every one of us needs
[1:04:28] something in our lives.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight is that night.
[1:04:31] Brother Daryl's going to speak for us
[1:04:32] tonight. He's no stranger to us. But we
[1:04:34] love Brother Daryl. We we appreciate the
[1:04:36] ministry that God has given to him.
[1:04:38] Won't take but a second, but I'll tell
[1:04:39] you real quick, two two and a half years
[1:04:42] ago in Pony, Oklahoma, Brother Daryl was
[1:04:45] standing there. Brother Jonathan Martin
[1:04:46] had preached and Brother Daryl was
[1:04:48] standing there in the front praying for
[1:04:51] people. And my wife come forward. She
[1:04:52] had been diagnosed with alpha gal and
[1:04:55] she'd break out just ever just all the
[1:04:58] time and she was on steroids and things
[1:05:00] like that. And she walked down to the
[1:05:02] front that night and I told brother
[1:05:04] Daryl what she needed and he said with
[1:05:06] her faith he said he said it's already
[1:05:08] done. He said don't even worry about it.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; She left that building and never even
[1:05:12] had a symptom after that night.
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:19] He never lost the battle and he never
[1:05:21] will.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we've heard it this
[1:05:25] weekend. If we can surrender,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; then anything is possible here tonight.
[1:05:29] We're going to sing this song and then
[1:05:31] brother Kobe will sing a song to bring
[1:05:32] Brother Daryl out on. So I I just wanted
[1:05:35] to sing this song tonight with all of
[1:05:36] our hearts. I wonder if we could just
[1:05:37] surrender for a moment of worship. Sing,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; I surrender.

[1:06:39] of surrender now?

[1:07:17] All you surrender now. Oh, I
[1:07:22] surrender.
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:27] Lord,
[1:07:29] I surrender my life.
[1:07:35] and I give it all.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated for just a
[1:07:39] moment before brother Daryl comes. God
[1:07:41] bless you.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Sing this now. Oh, he is he.
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Healing
[1:07:58] is he.

[1:08:54] toward the heavens.
[1:08:58] I lift my eyes where my help comes from.

[1:10:43] I trust in you.
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:52] Hallelujah.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Do you trust him?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He never really asked us to understand.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes while we go through a trial or
[1:11:04] while we have a difficulty,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; but he said, "Can you trust me?"
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I worked in surgery. I
[1:11:17] assisted surgeons and did been on
[1:11:20] thousands of operations. And
[1:11:24] there's a man came in. He's a Baptist
[1:11:27] preacher
[1:11:29] and he had through a blood clot
[1:11:32] killed 90% of his bow. A large percent
[1:11:35] of his bow was killed.
[1:11:39] When he came into the operating room,
[1:11:41] his bowels had been dead for 4 days.
[1:11:44] And when they opened him up, we could
[1:11:47] hardly stay in the room.
[1:11:51] And the doctor I was working with, I was
[1:11:52] standing across from him and he made
[1:11:55] this statement. He said, "This is a dead
[1:11:58] man.
[1:12:00] There's no way he can live. He doesn't
[1:12:02] have enough bow left to live." And I was
[1:12:06] standing there. I never spoke out loud,
[1:12:08] but in my heart, I said, "That's true,
[1:12:11] Lord.
[1:12:12] I I don't see how the man can live
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; and all at once
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; this warm feeling come over me and I
[1:12:24] begin to cry just turned my head away. I
[1:12:26] didn't want him to see the tears and a
[1:12:28] voice spoke to my heart.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And said, "Is there anything too hard
[1:12:33] for God?"
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And I said, "No, Lord. There's nothing
[1:12:38] too hard for you."
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can do anything.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; That man lived.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; For many years after that, he lived.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And I saw him in the cafeteria of the
[1:12:53] hospital about a year later. And I sat
[1:12:54] down in front of him and I said I me I
[1:12:57] called his name. And it startled him
[1:12:59] that I knew his name. And I said, "I
[1:13:01] know you don't know me, but I was on
[1:13:03] your operation." And I shared with him
[1:13:06] what I just shared with you. me and
[1:13:08] he'll both sit there had wept.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; In a public hospital
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; because we serve a God
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; that there's nothing too hard for him.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this building
[1:13:21] tonight that my God cannot take care of.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:27] forever. Do you love him?
[1:13:30] I bring you greetings from my pastor,
[1:13:32] brother Donnie Reagan and my
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; family at home and the church family and
[1:13:37] we just greet you and he wanted to make
[1:13:39] sure I tell you hello and I told him I
[1:13:41] would. And I want to quickly we'll go
[1:13:44] straight to the word, but I want to
[1:13:46] thank all the sisters and the brothers
[1:13:47] and all that was done to provide food
[1:13:49] for us. And
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the brothers that
[1:13:53] sweated so much out there parking the
[1:13:54] cars and
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; the deacons and the tr all that was done
[1:13:58] and
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; that lovely place you gave us to stay
[1:14:02] and just all that you've done for us.
[1:14:04] From the bone of my heart, I thank you
[1:14:06] for that. Hallelujah.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; I greet you this evening in the
[1:14:12] wonderful name of Jesus Christ because
[1:14:14] there is no greater name than the name
[1:14:16] of Jesus.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And there is power in the name of Jesus.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; What wonderful messages we have heard
[1:14:25] this weekend.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; After I heard these brothers preach, I
[1:14:31] thought about trying to get my job back
[1:14:33] in surgery. I thought, "Oh my, I just
[1:14:36] feel so small to stand here with these
[1:14:39] great men of God." But I appreciate
[1:14:41] Brother Ben allowing us. And
[1:14:45] may the Lord richly bless you. Be our
[1:14:46] prayer. And I pray that there'll be many
[1:14:49] testimonies come from tonight.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's one thing I know my God
[1:14:54] cannot do.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; He cannot fail.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, turn with us to
[1:15:00] the book of Mark. We want to read from
[1:15:01] Mark chapter 10.
[1:15:04] starting at verse 46 and certainly
[1:15:07] enjoyed the song service and thank you
[1:15:09] brother Kobe for singing that song. I
[1:15:11] just it just speaks to my heart and
[1:15:15] want to read from Mark chapter 10
[1:15:16] starting at verse 46. I know it's hot in
[1:15:18] here and so we'll be just as real quick
[1:15:21] and try not to keep you long at all and
[1:15:24] we'll go right into the prayer line.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] Thank you. Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. They came to
[1:15:35] Jericho.
[1:15:36] And as he went out of Jericho with the
[1:15:38] disciples, a great number of people,
[1:15:40] blind Barnameus, the son of Tmus,
[1:15:43] sat by the highway side begging.
[1:15:47] And when he had heard that it was Jesus
[1:15:48] of Nazareth, he began to cry out and
[1:15:50] say, "Jesus,
[1:15:52] thou son of David,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; have mercy on me."
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And many charged him that he should hold
[1:15:59] his peace.
[1:16:01] So he apologized and stayed quiet.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he cried the more a
[1:16:07] great deal.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[1:16:17] stood still.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen now.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And he commanded him to be called. And
[1:16:24] they called the blind man, saying unto
[1:16:26] him, "Be of good comfort. Rise.
[1:16:29] He calleth thee.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And he casting away his garment, rose,
[1:16:34] and came to Jesus.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:16:39] What wil thou that I should do unto
[1:16:42] thee?
[1:16:44] And the blind man said unto him, Lord,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; that I might receive my sight.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way. Thy
[1:16:54] faith hath made thee whole.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately he received his
[1:16:59] sight
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; and followed Jesus in the way.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't have no trouble seeing
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; what direction Jesus went.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; What a blessing it is tonight to know
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; that the same Jesus
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; who gave Barnameus his eyesight back
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; is the same Jesus
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; who gave my daughter Jessica
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; her eyesight back.
[1:17:29] And that same Jesus is in this house
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you for just a few
[1:17:38] minutes on step out to your promise.
[1:17:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:17:47] we love you, Lord.
[1:17:50] Thank you for all you've done for us.
[1:17:54] And we ask, oh God, that you would move
[1:17:56] tonight upon every heart and upon every
[1:17:59] home.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may they come forth from these
[1:18:04] meetings great testimonies.
[1:18:07] For you are our God,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; and you gave the promise, I am the Lord
[1:18:12] that healeth all thy diseases.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we commit this congregation and
[1:18:18] oursel into your hands
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; for your glory. Receive honor to
[1:18:23] yourself. we pray. Thank you Lord once
[1:18:26] again for loving us for we ask these
[1:18:29] things in Jesus name. And the bride says
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So we title this to step out to your
[1:18:42] promise.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Now notice I didn't say a promise.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; I said your promise. Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Because you see, it's a personal
[1:18:52] revelation.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; For the Bible said, "The promise is unto
[1:18:56] you."
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to your children, even as far
[1:19:00] off, as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:19:03] call.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Benham, several times
[1:19:05] he used this illustration
[1:19:08] of a box of rattlesnakes. Yes, sir.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What if someone came up in
[1:19:13] the morning to your door, an express
[1:19:14] agent, you know, or FedEx or Prime or
[1:19:17] whatever it would be today, and they
[1:19:19] would say that they had a box of
[1:19:21] rattlesnakes."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And it had your name on them.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Here you are.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; They're yours."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You see the rattlesnakes.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You hear the rattlesnakes.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You know that the rattlesnakes are there
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; just like you know your symptoms. Yeah,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Or there.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If you receive
[1:19:44] them,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; they're yours."
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to take them.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I don't want them."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And he can say, "But your name is on
[1:19:54] them."
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But you can say, "I don't want them. I
[1:19:56] won't have them.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And he'll do everything he can to make
[1:20:01] you take them."
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And in one sense, they're yours.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And in another sense, they're not.
[1:20:09] And
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; you know, you about to see all your
[1:20:11] symptoms
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; and the devil said, "Here it is. Here's
[1:20:14] your cancer. Here's your arthritis.
[1:20:16] Here's your heart trouble. Here's your
[1:20:17] mental trouble. Here's your marital
[1:20:19] trouble. Here's your condition.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Here you go.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; But it's really not yours until you sign
[1:20:28] for them.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; But if you refuse to sign for them, oh,
[1:20:33] I like this. He has to take them back.
[1:20:37] It has to go back to the one that's
[1:20:39] trying to give it to you.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; He can stand there and argue
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; as much as he wants to argue, but until
[1:20:48] you take them and sign for them, they
[1:20:51] belong to the express company, until you
[1:20:54] sign for the rattlesnakes.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Don't sign for
[1:20:59] nothing the devil brings."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "I refuse to have it."
[1:21:05] That's right. take it back.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with it.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; If you won't testify that you've got it,
[1:21:15] when you testify, you still have your
[1:21:17] sickness. The devil keeps it with you.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; As long as you have your problem, it's
[1:21:25] your problem. As long as you have your
[1:21:27] symptom, it's your symptom.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; As long as you say, "Well, I'm no good
[1:21:32] and nobody care." That's all you'll ever
[1:21:34] have. Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; If you receive them, they're yours, but
[1:21:38] you don't have to take them.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I don't want them." Well,
[1:21:43] your name's on it. I do not want that
[1:21:46] box of rattlesnakes.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; But if you sign for them
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; and receive them,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; they're yours. Come on.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And so I got to thinking,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; if that's true for a box of
[1:21:59] rattlesnakes,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; would it not be true
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; if a man of God,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; a son of God,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; a messenger from heaven,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; brother,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; was to come and offer you a box,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; and in this box is healing. In this box
[1:22:17] is joy. In this box is peace. In this
[1:22:20] box is a revival. It's deliverance. It's
[1:22:23] redemption. Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's yours. It's got your name on it.
[1:22:27] It's for you.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; But if you don't accept it and believe
[1:22:35] it, it goes back to the one who said it.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; But if you accept it and believe it and
[1:22:41] confess it,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; you can have everything that's in the
[1:22:46] box.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God can only bless you as
[1:22:53] you confess
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; that he's done it for you.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he's the high priest of
[1:22:59] our confession.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our confession.
[1:23:04] He can only do for you.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; As we accept it, believe it
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; and confess it.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; The ABCs of your healing.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Accept it,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; believe it.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Confess it.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:22] Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I found this quote so astounding.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let me give you a little
[1:23:27] instruction that I might say to the
[1:23:29] sick." Yeah.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Before you come here to be prayed for.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "You might have angels
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; to lay hands on you.
[1:23:40] Do you think about a prayer line
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; where angels of God come down dressed in
[1:23:46] white
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; and would stand there and you would come
[1:23:50] through the prayer line and angels of
[1:23:52] God would lay their hands on you. What a
[1:23:55] prayer line that would be.
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:58] But I want you to understand, no prayer
[1:24:00] line can heal you.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; And angels might lay hands on you.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said it will never do
[1:24:10] you any good.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; It'll not do one thing for you
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; unless first you believe it, accept it,
[1:24:18] and confess it.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Think about that. An angel of God wants
[1:24:22] to lay hands on you. But if you don't
[1:24:25] receive what God has already done for
[1:24:27] you,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; it'll do you
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; no good.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; For he's the high priest of our
[1:24:36] confession. Then what are we confessing?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; We need to confess what we've heard this
[1:24:42] weekend. I am a son of God. I was in
[1:24:44] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:24:47] world. I am put here to manifest his
[1:24:49] word.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to confess it first
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; before he can witness it before God.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; For he's the high priest there to make
[1:24:59] intercession upon our confession
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; of what he has done for us.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; The ABCs of your healing, the ABCs of
[1:25:06] your deliverance, the ABCs of any
[1:25:09] blessing
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; that the word of God has for you
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; is accept it,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; believe it, and confess it. And I say to
[1:25:18] you, if we can do that tonight, if you
[1:25:21] can accept it, believe it, and confess
[1:25:23] it, I tell you, in the name of the Lord,
[1:25:25] we will see miracles, we will see giants
[1:25:28] fall, we will see revival.
[1:25:32] The the prophet of God said, the angel
[1:25:34] of the Lord told him, if you can get the
[1:25:36] people to believe, nothing will stand in
[1:25:39] your way, not even cancer.
[1:25:42] It's not a what you feel. It's not a
[1:25:44] goosebump. It's not a sensation. It's by
[1:25:47] faith.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your emotions will lie to
[1:25:54] you. Sensations will lie to you.
[1:25:56] Symptoms will lie to you. But God's word
[1:25:58] will never lie.
[1:26:01] [Applause]
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Our story opens this evening
[1:26:12] on blind Barnameus.
[1:26:15] And he had been blind
[1:26:17] for many years.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He wasn't born that way.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; But something had happened
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; to cause him
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; to go blind.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And after all the years of blindness,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; he had took on the name
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; of blind
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Barameus
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; the beggar. And everyone around him
[1:26:42] just gave up on the ideal that he would
[1:26:44] ever see again.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And they never thought of him of any
[1:26:49] other way
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; than blind Barnameus were
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; crippled John.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And he made his living at the gate
[1:27:01] begging for coins.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And it must have been a cold October
[1:27:07] morning. The prophet said
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; blind Barnameus was getting to the gate
[1:27:11] late
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; because you see you had to get there
[1:27:15] early to get a good place
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; because when the businessmen and
[1:27:18] tourists come into the city they would
[1:27:20] throw him coins and that's how he made
[1:27:23] his living.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; So you had to get there early to get a
[1:27:27] good place. But this morning he got
[1:27:30] there late.
[1:27:34] was he had dreamed all night.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; that he could see
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and all the businessmen had done go into
[1:27:44] the city and the few tourist was done
[1:27:46] gone. So what could he do? He wouldn't
[1:27:49] get a coin.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And he listened and he could hear no one
[1:27:55] coming into the city.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; The morning wasn't looking good.
[1:28:03] The day had gotten off to a bad start.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; But little did he know
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; that this would be the last day he would
[1:28:12] ever have to beg for a coin
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; because of blindness. For this day was
[1:28:18] the day of his deliverance.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And you may have woke up this morning
[1:28:22] depressed. You may have woke up sick
[1:28:24] with a bad doctor's report.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Things may not have looked good for you.
[1:28:31] The morning might have started off so
[1:28:33] bad, but I'm here to tell you that today
[1:28:36] is the last day you have to deal with
[1:28:38] that fear, with that sickness, with that
[1:28:40] habit. For this day is the day of your
[1:28:43] deliverance.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; So, blind Barnameus took his place
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; beside the gate and he fell around till
[1:28:56] he felt a big stone
[1:28:59] and he sat down.
[1:29:04] He thought, you know,
[1:29:07] this is the very stone that I'm sitting
[1:29:09] on right now. This is the very stone
[1:29:11] that the power of God shook off the top
[1:29:13] of the wall of Jericho
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; when he broke the wall down.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; I'm sitting on a rock that come off the
[1:29:21] wall that God broke that wall down.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm sitting right here
[1:29:27] where God manifested his great power.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Daryl, I wish I
[1:29:33] could have been there. I wish I could
[1:29:35] sit there where that great miracle took
[1:29:37] place."
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; that the very place you're sitting
[1:29:42] tonight, we have seen that same God
[1:29:44] manifest himself in healing, in
[1:29:47] deliverance, in salvation.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wish you was there
[1:29:53] because you're here.
[1:29:58] Oh yes.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Setting in the warm sunshine,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; warming himself from the gold cold
[1:30:08] morning.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And he begin to think of what he was
[1:30:11] dreaming about the night before.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful dream it was.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I could see
[1:30:21] this dream. It was It was so real.
[1:30:25] What made me dream that?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I haven't thought about seeing for
[1:30:30] years.
[1:30:32] I just wonder, is there a possibility
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; that I could see again?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And maybe you're sitting here tonight
[1:30:41] wondering, is there a possibility
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that I won't need a cane anymore? Is it
[1:30:46] a possibility
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; that arthritis will leave me?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That my joints won't be stiff? that my
[1:30:53] marriage will come back together.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, every believer in here,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; you need to take the word impossible out
[1:31:03] of your vocabulary.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Impossible should never be a word that a
[1:31:10] believer utters. For the Bible said,
[1:31:12] "All things are possible."
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; To who? To him that believes.
[1:31:21] We should never say impossible. We
[1:31:24] should never say no hope. We should
[1:31:25] never say it's too bad.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; We should never say the doctor said.
[1:31:29] Come on, somebody.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You see, the dream changed his thinking
[1:31:37] of forever
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; being blind
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; to the possibility
[1:31:42] of seeing.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; The dream done that.
[1:31:47] And if thinking on a dream could do
[1:31:49] that,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; what can thinking on a promise from the
[1:31:53] word of God do?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Knowing that the word cannot fail.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; For the Bible said, "Finally, brother,
[1:32:00] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[1:32:02] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[1:32:04] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:32:06] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:32:07] things are of a good report, if there be
[1:32:09] any virtue, if there be any praise,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; think on these things.
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:20] Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; So we find blind Barnameus sitting on
[1:32:25] the rock off the walls of Jericho
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; warming himself in the sun
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; trying to get a few pennies
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; and he was all alone
[1:32:40] and
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; he got to thinking about his life.
[1:32:45] You know, sometimes it's good to slow
[1:32:46] down
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and just remember
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; remember where God brought you from.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Remember all the blessings God gave you.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Remember the time you saw
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; the coming of Elijah
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; and the message of the hour.
[1:33:04] Then
[1:33:06] he got to thinking and he said, "You
[1:33:08] know, I I used to come here with my lamb
[1:33:13] and I I had these turtle doves that
[1:33:15] would do tricks and they would help me
[1:33:17] get the attention of the people to help
[1:33:19] me get a few coins.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I remember that."
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; What happened
[1:33:27] to those doves?
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I remember my wife got sick
[1:33:37] and the doctor didn't know what to do
[1:33:38] and
[1:33:40] I went behind the house to pray to God
[1:33:44] and I said, "Lord,
[1:33:47] my wife's real sick
[1:33:51] and I don't know what to do
[1:33:55] and I need her. Lord,
[1:33:58] she cooks for me. She washes my clothes.
[1:34:01] She puts my fork and my plate always in
[1:34:03] the same place so I can find them.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; I need her so much.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Don't take her from me, Lord.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; If you'll let my dear precious wife get
[1:34:15] well, I promise you I'll take these two
[1:34:18] turtle doves and offer them to you for a
[1:34:21] sacrifice.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, don't make a promise to
[1:34:24] God
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; unless you intend to keep it.
[1:34:30] and his wife
[1:34:32] got well
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; and he kept his promise.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It wasn't long after that
[1:34:40] that his daughter took sick
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; with a fever.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I remember slipping out behind
[1:34:50] the house and lifting up my my blinded
[1:34:54] eyes and I said, Lord,
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; oh my My little girl's dying. Oh, God.
[1:35:02] Friends, I don't want that like I've
[1:35:04] been to her.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; My little girl's dying. Lord,
[1:35:11] don't take her from me.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I need her, Lord.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; I I see the world through her eyes.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; She tells me what the flower looks like
[1:35:22] that I'm smelling.
[1:35:24] And she tells me all the formation that
[1:35:26] the clouds make. He sees all kinds of
[1:35:29] animals in the clouds.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; She brings me such joy.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Don't take her from me, Lord.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have nothing left but my lamb.
[1:35:41] But if you let my baby live, I promise
[1:35:44] you
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; I'll take my lamb and give it to you for
[1:35:48] a sacrifice upon the altar.
[1:35:51] And as the story goes, his daughter got
[1:35:54] well and on his road to church to offer
[1:35:57] the sacrifice, he met the priest and he
[1:35:59] said, "Where goest thou, blind
[1:36:01] Barnameus?"
[1:36:04] He said, "Priest, I go to the temple to
[1:36:06] give the Lord my lamb for a sacrifice."
[1:36:08] And he said, "Barameus, thou can't you
[1:36:10] can't do that.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; You can't give this lamb. This this lamb
[1:36:14] is your seeing eye animal. It helps you
[1:36:16] get around. You need that lamb to help
[1:36:19] you see
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; here. I'll give you some money. Go and
[1:36:23] buy a lamb and offer it to God
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; because this lamb is your eyes.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Barameus said, "But I never promised God
[1:36:32] a lamb.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I promised God this lamb."
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And if I obey my promise to Jehovah, he
[1:36:39] will provide a lamb for my eyes.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And he thought, "What made me say that?
[1:36:50] What made me, you know, sometimes under
[1:36:52] inspiration, we'll say things we don't
[1:36:54] even really realize we're saying.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; What made me say that?
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; You see, God's always made a preparation
[1:37:01] for healing in all ages, at all time,
[1:37:04] for he is the healer.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And thinking on these ways of the
[1:37:08] provided lamb sitting there,
[1:37:11] he began to hear a noise.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; What's going on? Someone said, "It's
[1:37:17] Jesus of Nazareth." Hallelujah.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. He's come.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something be to pulsate in
[1:37:30] his heart. And when blind Barnameus
[1:37:32] heard that the lamb, the provided way,
[1:37:34] the lamb of God, he be to cry out,
[1:37:36] "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:37:40] me." And someone said, "Hey, we don't
[1:37:42] act like that around here.
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:46] We just kind of nod our head, you know.
[1:37:47] If we agree, just
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; we don't want none of that screaming
[1:37:54] around here. Just if you agree, just nod
[1:37:56] your head.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; They said, "Hold your peace."
[1:38:03] But the Bible said he cried out louder.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And let me say, "Do not let the devil
[1:38:10] dampen your faith. If you need something
[1:38:13] for God, cry out for it.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; He cried louder. That was his lamb. That
[1:38:20] was his lamb. If he could get his
[1:38:22] attention,
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; his blindness would be over.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; But you see, it wasn't his voice.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That stopped Jesus.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, preer.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It was not his voice. It was his faith.
[1:38:41] And if his faith can stop Jesus, your
[1:38:44] faith can stop him tonight.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Think of it. The faith of an
[1:38:51] insufficient beggar.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; A blind man set him by the gate begging
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; stop the son of God.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; On his way to Calvary.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Yes sir.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; If his faith done that
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; what would your faith do today?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It'll bring him down from heaven
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; here to any individual.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he'd come all the way
[1:39:21] from glory to make one person well.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; For the sake of one.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Who's that one?"
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:39] That's how much he loves you.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Jesus stood still and
[1:39:48] they said he stopped. He's calling for
[1:39:50] you. Now blind Barnameus is left with
[1:39:53] this decision.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; The same decision that every one of you
[1:39:58] is facing this evening.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He is left with this decision. either
[1:40:04] sit still on this rock
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; or get up and step out
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; to Jesus.
[1:40:12] Now remember the prophet said he was 150
[1:40:15] yards away from Jesus
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; and he's totally blind,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; raggedy and poor.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus said, "Come here."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was talking to his
[1:40:26] sister said, "Now the devil, he's seen
[1:40:29] you just ready to receive it."
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll put a little damper
[1:40:34] on her." Brother Br makes a little sound
[1:40:36] to illustrate a fan. I'll fan her a
[1:40:38] little bit, you know, kind of cool her
[1:40:39] down a little bit. Come on.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; But oh my
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; oh my. When the devil tries to dampen
[1:40:45] you down, that's when you rise up and
[1:40:48] claim your Godgiven rights.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; If Satan is telling you you can't get
[1:40:54] well, your problem is too bad. You ought
[1:40:56] to know he's lying to you.
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Why would you believe that over what God
[1:41:02] said? God. Hallelujah. God said, "I am
[1:41:05] the Lord thy God who heals all thy
[1:41:08] deceas.
[1:41:14] Hallelujah.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan uses reasoning.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; He uses reasoning against faith.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; How's he coming
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; immediately? Reason would say, "Sit
[1:41:27] still."
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Well, the master the master, he's he's
[1:41:33] asked you to do something that you
[1:41:34] simply can't do.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; How you know where to find him? You're
[1:41:39] blind. All this people, all this crowd,
[1:41:41] all this noise. How you going to find
[1:41:43] him?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; After all, you're
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; blind.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; How you going to find him? Reason says
[1:41:54] you can't find him. There's all kinds of
[1:41:56] obstacles in your way.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; There's people in your way.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; You're totally blind.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Just sit still.
[1:42:07] Don't embarrass yourself.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Just sit
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; still.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; But you see, oh God,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; as brother Andrew preached the first
[1:42:21] night, it was his moment.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It was his time of opportunity. It was
[1:42:26] his moment with Jesus. He had an
[1:42:28] audience with the master.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And he could not let that opportunity
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; pass by. Come on.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You see, if he would have sat there,
[1:42:39] this would have been a different story
[1:42:41] all together.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; And if you just sat there,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; it'll be a different story.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; All together.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; But if you step out to your promise,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; you see when that little boy had his
[1:42:57] lunch that Jesus wanted to feed the
[1:42:59] multitude, as long as he kept that
[1:43:00] lunch, it was his.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Is that not true? But when he gave it to
[1:43:05] Jesus, look what Jesus could do with it.
[1:43:08] As long as you keep your problem, that's
[1:43:09] your problem. As long as you keep that
[1:43:11] symptom, that's your symptom. But if you
[1:43:13] can get up and step out and give it to
[1:43:16] Jesus, just look what he's able to do
[1:43:18] with it.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Will it work?" I tell you, I
[1:43:25] tell you from the depths of my heart, it
[1:43:28] will work.
[1:43:31] when Jessica was struck by that train
[1:43:33] and two of my family was killed and the
[1:43:36] doctors gave us no hope that she would
[1:43:37] even live. And I stood there at the
[1:43:39] window of that hospital room that day
[1:43:41] and I said, "Father, Jessica's hurt more
[1:43:43] than I could do anything about. There's
[1:43:45] nothing I could do to help my baby.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; All my medical knowledge, all the
[1:43:53] surgeries I'd been in, there was nothing
[1:43:55] I could do to help Jessica."
[1:43:59] And
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; so I said to him, I said, "Father, I
[1:44:02] give her to you."
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I place her in your hands.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; If you take her life, I'll love her as
[1:44:12] much. I love you as much as I ever loved
[1:44:14] you. I'll preach as hard as I ever
[1:44:15] preach. But if you'll let my baby live,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'll try my best to tell the world what
[1:44:21] you did for her. And by God's grace, I
[1:44:24] have kept that promise to the best of my
[1:44:26] ability.
[1:44:36] And several years later, I run into
[1:44:38] brother Louie. He had a Little Debbie
[1:44:40] cake route. He's one about killed every
[1:44:42] one of us up home little Debbie cakes.
[1:44:44] But and he said, "Come out to the truck.
[1:44:46] I got some cakes for the kids." And I
[1:44:48] went out there and he was listening to a
[1:44:49] tape and brother said something like
[1:44:51] this. I don't remember it verbatim, but
[1:44:52] it was something like this. He was
[1:44:53] talking about Yoseed and and and Amram.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, "When Yoseph and
[1:44:58] Amram gave Moses to God,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; God gave Moses back to them.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And while I was standing there, this
[1:45:05] feeling just come over me. I've never
[1:45:07] heard an audible voice in my life, but
[1:45:08] you know how it is. Something just
[1:45:09] speaks to your heart."
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; And something spoke to my heart. I
[1:45:13] believe it was him. And he said,
[1:45:14] "Because you gave me Jessica."
[1:45:23] Because you gave me Jessica,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; I gave Jessica back to you.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You got a wayward child. You got a
[1:45:35] wayward son. You got a wayward daughter.
[1:45:37] You got a wayward husband, a wayward
[1:45:38] wife. You know what I do if I was you?
[1:45:40] I'd give them to Jesus. And if you give
[1:45:42] them to Jesus, just see what my Lord is
[1:45:46] able to do.
[1:45:52] He could not let that opportunity pass
[1:45:54] him by.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Like the woman with the blood shield,
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; she saw he was passing by. Her window of
[1:46:01] opportunity was closing.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; She couldn't get over the crowd
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; or through the crowd.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; She didn't quit.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; She went under the crowd.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; But what was she dealing with?
[1:46:16] hindrances,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; barriers,
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said, "If you ever come
[1:46:24] to Christ, you're going to have to press
[1:46:26] your way to him
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be all kinds of
[1:46:30] people trying to hold
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; you back."
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's those that's closest
[1:46:36] to us
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; that'll try to discourage us.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's true, friends.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; That's true. I appreciate every phone
[1:46:46] call I ever got. But when Jessica was
[1:46:48] blind and people would call and they'd
[1:46:50] say, "Is she seeing?" I'd say, "Not
[1:46:52] yet."
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Well, brother D, bless God, it'll be a
[1:46:55] greater miracle tomorrow. I know it. I'm
[1:46:57] believing it.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Well, after a week went by, two weeks,
[1:47:00] three weeks, a month, a month and a
[1:47:01] half, two months. Ring, is she seeing?
[1:47:05] No, not yet.
[1:47:08] Well, brother Daryl, we're praying,
[1:47:10] brother.
[1:47:12] And I told my wife, I said, "I don't
[1:47:14] even want to answer the phone anymore
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; because all I hear is, "Well, brother
[1:47:19] Daryl,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; hindrances,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; barriers." Sometimes the people closest
[1:47:24] to us
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; will try to slow us down.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Satan loves barriers. He loves
[1:47:31] hindrances.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Anything to keep you away from getting
[1:47:35] to Jesus.
[1:47:39] You know what a horse race when they
[1:47:40] back those horses in and they close that
[1:47:42] gate at a horse race horse track. You
[1:47:45] know what that gate's called? It's
[1:47:46] called a barrier.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; But you know what that barrier means? It
[1:47:51] means there's a victory lane just ahead.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Daryl, I've got this
[1:47:56] hindrance. I You know what that tells
[1:47:58] me? You got a miracle on the way. You
[1:48:00] got a victory on the way. Come on,
[1:48:01] somebody. Do not let the barrier hinder
[1:48:03] you. Press beyond the barrier.
[1:48:12] You thought all hell to get here
[1:48:14] tonight,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; but maybe you're here
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; for your greatest miracle.
[1:48:19] [Applause]
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Turn your faith to the one who can
[1:48:25] change the situation
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; like that.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; She never touched his back. She never
[1:48:35] touched his arm. She got down and
[1:48:37] crawled through the legs of the people
[1:48:38] and touched the hymn of his garbage
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; and immediately her blemish issue
[1:48:45] stopped. 12 years of bleeding stopped
[1:48:50] instantly.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; So blind Barname I'm hurry. I know it's
[1:48:56] hot. It's hot up here. So blind
[1:48:58] Barnameus stepped out of reason. He
[1:49:00] stepped out of all the reasons of why he
[1:49:03] should not get up off that rock he was
[1:49:05] sitting on.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; You're blind. It's 150 yards away. Can
[1:49:09] you trust those people to get you to
[1:49:11] Jesus?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; All the noise, all the crowd. You don't
[1:49:16] even know exactly where he's standing.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And every one of those was valid reasons
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; why he should just sit still.
[1:49:28] You see, reasoning will have you sit
[1:49:30] still.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; But faith, oh God,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; faith goes into action. This is my day.
[1:49:38] This is my time. This is my opportunity.
[1:49:41] I cannot miss my opportunity.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And blind Barnameus gets up and goes to
[1:49:48] Jesus by faith. Why? Cuz Jesus said
[1:49:51] come. And if Jesus says come,
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; The way's already been provided to get
[1:49:56] there.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And if he's calling for you tonight, the
[1:50:02] way has already been provided for you.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Just step out to your promise.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight is faith to
[1:50:12] take action.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to say, "I believe." The
[1:50:15] devil believes.
[1:50:21] It's not enough to say, "I believe it."
[1:50:22] You must act on it.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; You must accept it, believe it.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And confess it.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; How do we Noah believe? How do we know
[1:50:30] Noah believed God?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; How do we know that? When God told him,
[1:50:33] "It's going to rain. Build a boat, it's
[1:50:35] going to rain." How do we know that Noah
[1:50:37] believed what God said? It had never
[1:50:39] rained before. God watered the earth
[1:50:41] from from the deep, from the springs.
[1:50:43] There had never been a cloud in the sky.
[1:50:45] How do we know that Noah believed God
[1:50:47] against what the eyes said was
[1:50:49] impossible?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; How do we know he believed God?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Because he took action and he built the
[1:50:56] ark
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; before the rain ever fell.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You talk about eyesight. He saw rain
[1:51:04] coming
[1:51:05] 120 years away.
[1:51:09] [Applause]
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:14] How do we know Joshua believed those
[1:51:16] walls would fall down? They was 46 foot
[1:51:18] high, 80 foot thick. He built the walls
[1:51:21] when he was in Egypt. He knew what went
[1:51:23] in them. He knew how tight they were,
[1:51:24] how thick they were. He knew they run
[1:51:26] chariot races around the top of them.
[1:51:28] People had their houses built on top of
[1:51:29] them. You know, like Rahab.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And there he stood and God said, "I want
[1:51:36] you to march around the wall, blow a
[1:51:38] trumpet, let out a shout, and the walls
[1:51:40] are going to come down.
[1:51:49] Really?
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Do I need some dynamite
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; backho?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Bulldozer.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; No, just march.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Bow a trumpet,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; shout
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; and the walls are going to come down.
[1:52:11] Now, how do we know Joshua believed
[1:52:12] that? Against every bit of his
[1:52:14] intellect, against every bit of his
[1:52:16] knowledge of walls that he learned in
[1:52:18] Egypt.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Because they marched around the walls,
[1:52:21] shouting the victory before the walls
[1:52:23] ever came down. Lord, I believe. Lord, I
[1:52:26] believe. I believe what you say to me.
[1:52:29] You're my healer. You're my deliverer.
[1:52:31] You're the keeper of my flame. Come on,
[1:52:32] somebody. Has our God ever failed us?
[1:52:34] Has God ever told us something that did
[1:52:37] not come to pass? I say we can trust our
[1:52:39] God.
[1:52:44] Faith jumps. It leaps into action.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight,
[1:52:54] if you can believe, if you can believe
[1:52:56] what I'm telling you tonight, you can
[1:52:58] right now start shouting the victory
[1:53:00] before you ever come through the prayer
[1:53:01] line.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:53:08] Give your faith a chance.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Turn it loose.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Unbridle it.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Let it work.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; You've got it all bound down with
[1:53:17] tradition.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Has to be a certain way or a certain
[1:53:20] preacher or I have to say a certain
[1:53:22] thing.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. That's simply not true.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Re said, "Turn it loose.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Cut it loose. Let God have his way with
[1:53:37] you.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You know, we sing that song, let go and
[1:53:40] let God have his wonderful way.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; And then we won't let him.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; We try to dictate how the service goes.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I'll just stay with preaching on healing
[1:53:56] for a little bit. But
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; but you see, somebody's word is right.
[1:54:03] That's right.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; It's either what you're looking at with
[1:54:06] your eyes
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; or what God said.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; But don't look at it with the eyes of
[1:54:11] your head. Satan chose the eyes of your
[1:54:13] head, but God chose the eyes of your
[1:54:15] heart.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; And we see those things that we do not
[1:54:19] see with our earthly eyes. The eyes of
[1:54:21] our heart declares it. Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; God's word is true. I believe all of it.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in what doctors
[1:54:32] saying. And I've got nothing against
[1:54:34] doctors. I went to one before I came
[1:54:36] down here. I worked with doctors. I have
[1:54:37] nothing against them.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you doctors can be 100%
[1:54:42] correct.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And they can be 100% wrong.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; And you know what? You still have to pay
[1:54:49] them.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in their doctor
[1:55:00] and I got nothing against them. honest.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; But you've got to realize that every
[1:55:06] class of 100 doctors, somebody graduated
[1:55:08] last.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And it might just be your doctor.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, the only reason he is a
[1:55:20] doctor is because his daddy was dean of
[1:55:23] the medical school
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; and he got his degree because his daddy
[1:55:27] was dean maybe an autopin. I don't know.
[1:55:29] He doesn't.
[1:55:31] Come on.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; But he become a doctor because his daddy
[1:55:35] was dean of the medical school.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Now ask me how I know that.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; So doctors can be right
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; and they can be wrong.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; But I declare to you tonight, God's word
[1:55:48] is never
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; wrong.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Let me hurry. Let me hurry.
[1:55:55] And the Bible said he casted away his
[1:55:58] garment, rose and came to Jesus. Now
[1:56:01] this garment has a plays an important
[1:56:03] part. And some scholars you I couldn't
[1:56:05] really find where it was proven or not
[1:56:06] but some say that this garment this coat
[1:56:08] that he wore was actually issued by the
[1:56:10] government to identify him as a beggar.
[1:56:12] So like a license or like a permit to
[1:56:14] beg outside the city. So they wore this
[1:56:17] coat showing that they had the authority
[1:56:19] or the right to beg for money.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know if that's true or not
[1:56:22] but it makes a good point nonetheless.
[1:56:23] Anyway, we do know that the cloak was
[1:56:26] significant.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Because you see, that's how he made his
[1:56:29] living.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And while he was yet blind, he rose up
[1:56:34] and cast it on the ground.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; And him leaving it on the ground
[1:56:39] indicates how much that he believed
[1:56:43] Jesus would restore his sight.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't need this anymore. I
[1:56:50] will not need this anymore."
[1:56:53] Why? Because Jesus is here. Jesus is
[1:56:57] here. He's in the house. He is in the
[1:57:00] house. Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Can you leave that depression
[1:57:10] robe? Can you leave that arthritis robe,
[1:57:13] that glaucoma robe, that sugar diabetes
[1:57:16] robe, that depression robe, that anxiety
[1:57:18] robe, that marriage ro? Can you leave
[1:57:21] that?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Can you cast it aside and leave it?
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; That I trouble
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; that stomach trouble,
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; that fear robe.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Leave it on the ground.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Step out towards your promise.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Cast off that condemnation robe.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; If we ask God to forgive him, he is to
[1:57:46] forgive us. He's just
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Is that not true?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; You say,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; you know, I've seen that thing with how
[1:57:57] long does it take the Lord to forgive
[1:57:59] you? As long as it takes you to ask.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; No, there's a sister. Can Can just a few
[1:58:06] more? Listen. There's a sister told me
[1:58:08] this herself. She said, "I was a young
[1:58:10] teenager. I was in Brother Bram's
[1:58:12] meeting down in Louisiana
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; and I've been smoking cigarettes. My
[1:58:16] mama didn't know. My daddy didn't know.
[1:58:17] The pastor didn't know.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; I'd sneak behind the barn and I'd smoke
[1:58:23] cigarettes.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was standing there in
[1:58:33] the prayer line and brother Benham,
[1:58:35] about three people in front of me told
[1:58:37] this man, you've got a habit in your
[1:58:39] life. It's cigarettes. They're in your
[1:58:41] pocket right now."
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; And the man said, "That's true." Yes.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was standing there and
[1:58:47] I thought, oh Lord, as soon as I stand
[1:58:49] before that man, he's going to tell my
[1:58:51] mama, my daddy, my pastor,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; he going to tell everybody I've been
[1:58:55] smoking cigarettes."
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And she said, I said, "Lord,
[1:59:00] forgive me for that."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Brother Daryl, when I
[1:59:04] stood before the prophet,
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; he never said a word about the
[1:59:09] cigarettes."
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because when she asked God
[1:59:14] to he took that and dropped it in the
[1:59:16] sea of forgetfulness.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you grateful for the
[1:59:26] grace of God?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered him and said unto him,
[1:59:38] "What do you want me to do for you?
[1:59:42] And I ask you tonight, what do you want
[1:59:44] Jesus to do for you?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you sick here tonight?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; How many has a problem? Well, just
[1:59:50] praise the Lord. Hardly anybody who's
[1:59:53] got a problem tonight.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; He's got trouble tonight. Don't raise
[1:59:57] your hand if you don't. I'm not asking
[1:59:58] you. I'm just trying to cuz I want you
[2:00:00] to understand. No matter how much you
[2:00:01] want to be healed tonight, no matter how
[2:00:03] much you want to be delivered tonight,
[2:00:04] no matter how much you want to be
[2:00:05] restored tonight,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; okay? The prophet of God said he wants
[2:00:09] to heal you a thousand times more
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; than you want to be healed.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; So if you're sitting here tonight said,
[2:00:15] "Oh God, I'm so tired of this arthritis.
[2:00:17] I'm so tired of this problem. I'm so
[2:00:19] tired of the sickness." God wants to do
[2:00:21] it for you a thousand times more than
[2:00:23] you want him to do it.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; When he calls for you, don't be afraid
[2:00:30] to step out. When he calls for you, he's
[2:00:33] got something for you.
[2:00:38] What do you want me to do?
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; He said, Lord, that I might receive my
[2:00:43] sight
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "Go thy way.
[2:00:50] Thy faith
[2:00:51] has made thee
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; whole."
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Notice Jesus never said, "My power."
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; He never said, "My power has made you
[2:01:00] whole."
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your faith."
[2:01:05] That's good.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; See, said Jesus didn't heal the sick to
[2:01:07] show his power. He healed the sick to
[2:01:10] fulfill scripture.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in St. John 14:12,
[2:01:16] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, works I
[2:01:18] do shall you do also, and greater works
[2:01:19] than these shall you do, because I go to
[2:01:21] the Father,
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; they shall lay hands on the sick
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; and they shall recover." That's right.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; He will fulfill that scripture in this
[2:01:30] day
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; because none of his word returns unto
[2:01:33] him
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; void.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And immediately his eyes come open
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; and blind Barnameus standing there as
[2:01:43] I'm coming to a close standing there
[2:01:46] looking at his hands.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:51] for the first time.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; in many years.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Man,
[2:02:00] they sure have changed since
[2:02:03] I was young.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; But they're mine."
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that that's that scar I got
[2:02:11] when I was about three years old there
[2:02:13] in the kitchen.
[2:02:15] That moment.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; That moment
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; that he saw for the first time.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; He just
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; And Jesus,
[2:02:29] I'll go with you.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; night of the accident,
[2:02:45] they took us back to the emergency room
[2:02:47] and me and my wife, her daddy and sister
[2:02:49] was killed.
[2:02:51] And we walked by this cubital and there
[2:02:53] was all this stuff everywhere and blood
[2:02:54] everywhere. And Cheryl said, "That's my
[2:02:58] daddy's blood."
[2:03:02] And we went to the next cubicle.
[2:03:05] There laid a little girl.
[2:03:08] She had leaves in her hair. She had a
[2:03:12] neck brace on. She's intubated. She's on
[2:03:15] life support.
[2:03:17] She had
[2:03:19] she had blood on her.
[2:03:30] And I said, "Friend of mine, I worked
[2:03:32] with him. He was taking care of her." I
[2:03:34] said, "Mark, how bad is it?" He said, he
[2:03:36] said, he said, "Please don't tell me
[2:03:38] this is your little girl." I said, "How
[2:03:40] bad is she, Mark?" He said, "I'm sorry.
[2:03:44] Your baby, she can't live. She just
[2:03:47] turned too bad. She got a severe severe
[2:03:52] brain injury."
[2:03:55] And they put us a little room and they
[2:03:57] put her in, "I see you. I'm coming to a
[2:04:00] closing
[2:04:03] and I was laying in that bed with my
[2:04:05] wife that night in this little room and
[2:04:06] Jessica's in the KICU kids intensive
[2:04:09] care unit.
[2:04:11] And Cheryl was crying. She said, "I've
[2:04:12] lost my daddy." She said, "I've lost my
[2:04:16] sister." And she said, "If Jessica
[2:04:17] dies," she said, "I'll just die. I can't
[2:04:20] live."
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And I knew she meant it, but Josh
[2:04:26] and I turned my face to the wall.
[2:04:28] Blessing God.
[2:04:30] What are you doing? You're taking
[2:04:33] everything away from me.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; I'm losing everything.
[2:04:44] And I saw God is my witness. It's like
[2:04:47] looking at at a video clip. I saw me and
[2:04:53] Cheryl and Jessica walk up onto the
[2:04:56] platform of Happy Valley, Jessica had on
[2:04:58] a new dress.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; And months later
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Right before we came home from the
[2:05:08] hospital, 67 days in the hospital, a
[2:05:12] sister from our church came down and
[2:05:14] brought Jessica a new dress. Oh,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; when we came home
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; and we walked out on that platform,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; you remember you was you came
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; that was me, that was Cheryl, and that
[2:05:31] was Jessica and the new dress.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Thank
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; because our God
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; cannot fail.
[2:05:51] Hallelujah.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't want my baby to be blind.
[2:06:06] I had a little cry room I'd go to just
[2:06:08] get away by myself and I'd lay my head
[2:06:10] against that wall and I'd cry out to God
[2:06:12] as Lord, I don't want my baby to be
[2:06:14] blind,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; but God rich in mercy
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; open us.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; The promise that Isaiah made
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; was true. For said, when he comes,
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; when he comes, the blind will receive
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; their sight. Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord Jesus can heal one
[2:06:36] person,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; he can heal all people.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And the only thing you have to know is
[2:06:41] this is to believe his presence is here.
[2:06:43] To believe that he's here to help.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; He's here to help you. And if you
[2:06:47] believe that and will receive that, that
[2:06:50] he can help you.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; And I trust you'll do that. Each one of
[2:06:52] you be reverent. Believe on him with all
[2:06:55] your heart. The master's coming. He
[2:06:56] calls for you. He's calling for you back
[2:06:58] to health. He's calling for you back to
[2:07:00] joy, back to peace.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to sign for it. Don't be
[2:07:05] afraid to accept it and believe it and
[2:07:08] confess it.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; You remember the bitter waters
[2:07:15] when they got to the bitter waters and
[2:07:17] they couldn't drink them and they were
[2:07:18] so upset. But the answer to the bitter
[2:07:21] water was there the whole time.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Even when they was in Egypt, that tree
[2:07:26] was growing there by that bitter water.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Is that not true? It was there the whole
[2:07:33] time.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Here a few years ago, every second week
[2:07:38] of February, I would go to Louisiana and
[2:07:40] preach.
[2:07:42] And so I'd get my ticket about November
[2:07:44] and I'll go ahead and get my seat.
[2:07:47] And so I go down to preach there in
[2:07:48] Louisiana down in Manny, Louisiana.
[2:07:51] Brother Jeremy Cosnerers, they brought
[2:07:52] me up to Alexandria to fly home. And I'm
[2:07:55] sitting on the plane in the seat that I
[2:07:56] picked out back in November. And a man
[2:07:58] sits down beside me. He said, 'You from
[2:08:00] around here? I said, 'n no sir.
[2:08:04] He said, 'Where you from?' I said, '
[2:08:06] Tennessee.' He said, ' Tennessee.' I
[2:08:08] said, 'Yes, sir.' He said, 'Well, what
[2:08:09] brings you down here? I said, I'm a
[2:08:11] preacher. Oh, you're a preacher? I said,
[2:08:14] yes, sir. He said, "Well, since you're a
[2:08:16] preacher, let me ask you something." I
[2:08:17] said, "Well, sir, I'm not the sharpest
[2:08:18] knife in the drawer, but if I can help
[2:08:20] you, I'd be glad to do it." He said, "My
[2:08:23] daughter was getting her kids ready to
[2:08:25] bring me to the airport." He said, "I
[2:08:26] was looking on the internet. I found
[2:08:28] something so unusual.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you about it. I said,
[2:08:32] "Sir, if I could help you, I'd be glad
[2:08:34] to do it." He said, "Have you ever heard
[2:08:36] of a man by the name of William
[2:08:38] Brandom?"
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, sir. His grandkids go
[2:08:43] to my church."
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; He never sat like you're sitting. He
[2:08:48] never stopped talking all the way to
[2:08:50] Atlanta, Georgia. This guy was fired up.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; And when we got off the plane, he shook
[2:08:55] hands and said, "God bless you." And I
[2:08:57] was walking around concourse D there in
[2:08:58] Atlanta going to another gate to go
[2:09:00] home. I got to thinking three months
[2:09:03] before that man ever knew he had a
[2:09:05] question,
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; God had the answer set beside you.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; And I say this as I close. Before you
[2:09:15] ever had a problem, before you ever had
[2:09:18] a fear, ever had a sickness, the answer
[2:09:21] was already here.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; He's already here. Amen.
[2:09:27] Do you believe me tonight? Do you love
[2:09:29] me tonight? Well, musicians, let's come
[2:09:31] to the instrument tonight. Oh, blessed
[2:09:33] be the name of the Lord God Almighty. He
[2:09:36] is my healer. He is my sustainer. He's
[2:09:39] my life. He's my joy. He's my beast.
[2:09:41] He's my everything.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you love him tonight?
[2:09:52] Amen.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Why would I worry? Oh yes.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; When giants come calling my name,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; my God is so much bigger and troubles I
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I hunger for power or
[2:10:21] riches or fame?
[2:10:24] Cuz
[2:10:27] my God is so much better than all of
[2:10:31] these things.
[2:10:35] So I won't be shen.
[2:10:37] [Applause]
[2:10:40] I won't be moved. Amen.
[2:10:45] My God is faithful.
[2:10:50] His promise is true.
[2:10:53] Hallelujah.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Tell him it's time to move
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:11:11] gater.
[2:11:17] My enemies scatter. They know the battle
[2:11:22] is done.
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is stronger. The victory
[2:11:32] already.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, he died for our ransom and rose up
[2:11:42] on the third day.
[2:11:48] My God is greater than
[2:11:52] hell and the grave.
[2:11:56] Hallelujah. So I won't be shen.
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:02] I won't be moved.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; My God is great.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord. His promise is true.
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain
[2:12:22] till it's time to move.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; My God is big,
[2:12:32] strong,
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; heavenly father. Lord, I'm so grateful
[2:12:40] tonight. That's not not just the words
[2:12:43] of a song. But it is the words of
[2:12:46] reality.
[2:12:48] No giant can stand before you. No
[2:12:50] sickness can stand before you. There is
[2:12:53] nothing too hard for you, God.
[2:12:56] I've seen you do, Lord.
[2:12:59] What they said was impossible.
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I was a young man, I
[2:13:04] preached. Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; That you opened the blinded eyes and you
[2:13:07] made the lame walk.
[2:13:10] I preached it with all my heart. I
[2:13:11] believed it with all my heart, but I
[2:13:13] never seen it.
[2:13:15] But now, Lord, I can stand before these
[2:13:17] people tonight and I can testify our God
[2:13:20] opens blinded eyes and he makes the lame
[2:13:23] walk because I see it every day of my
[2:13:25] life. When Jessica comes downstairs,
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; opens up the refrigerator.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Goes out and gets in the car.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; I see what the doctor said impossible.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. becomes possible with you.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray tonight in the name of
[2:13:44] Jesus.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I could, I'd heal every person
[2:13:48] in this building,
[2:13:52] but I can't. Lord, I'm just a man,
[2:13:57] but you're God.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; But me and our ministering brothers here
[2:14:01] tonight, we yield oursel to you. And may
[2:14:05] we be a conduit, Lord. May we be a
[2:14:08] channel that the Holy Spirit can flow
[2:14:10] through and confirm to these people.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; What you've already done for them.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; For your prophet said, if he stood right
[2:14:18] here in this suit that someone bought
[2:14:20] from me, he said he could not heal you
[2:14:23] because you're already healed.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, that bitter water was turned sweet
[2:14:27] by a tree that was growing by it.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; That tree had already been there. It
[2:14:31] provided everything. Oh, God. to turn
[2:14:34] that bitter water sweet was in that
[2:14:36] tree. Father, I'm so glad tonight
[2:14:38] there's another tree in the midst of us.
[2:14:40] It's Calvar's tree. And everything we
[2:14:43] have need of was provided on that tree.
[2:14:48] For that day at Calvary you gave us. You
[2:14:50] hung your heart on that tree. Thank you,
[2:14:54] Lord. And God, may there be many
[2:14:57] testimonies come forth tonight. Not just
[2:14:59] from this service, but from the
[2:15:00] meetings. Dear God, as we've already
[2:15:02] heard the things that you've done.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Bless your children tonight, Lord.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; We love you, Father.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; We believe, Lord.
[2:15:11] We believe, Lord.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can't do.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:21] Hallelujah. Do you love him tonight?
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:38] water he turned into wine.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; He opened the eyes of the blind.

[2:19:54] Are you ready to believe?
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Has your faith been increased? I want us
[2:19:58] to watch something for just a minute.
[2:19:59] And I Some of you can't sit down. So,
[2:20:02] uh, if you if you want to sit down, you
[2:20:04] can. But we've got a little video. I
[2:20:06] want you to watch a miraculous thing
[2:20:07] that happened here in the prayer line.
[2:20:09] Believe it'll build your faith. And as
[2:20:10] soon as we're done, uh, we're going to
[2:20:12] have the brothers come. You believe he
[2:20:14] still does miracles.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about miracles from
[2:20:17] many years ago. We're talking about
[2:20:18] miracles that have happened right here
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; in these meetings
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; and your miracles going to happen
[2:20:24] tonight.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it?
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and play that, brother Peter.
[2:20:29] God bless you.
[2:20:31] So, as I was writing this out to try and
[2:20:35] condense it all, it really just impacted
[2:20:37] me of how many things went into this
[2:20:41] testimony. Little things that if we told
[2:20:45] it all, it would take all day, but I
[2:20:47] tried to condense it as best I could.
[2:20:50] Um, our testimony really begins um when
[2:20:54] we got married in uh 2022. I had
[2:20:58] rheumatoid arthritis. Um, and due to the
[2:21:01] medications I was on, we couldn't have a
[2:21:04] baby because of the side effects, what
[2:21:06] would happen to the baby. Um, and that
[2:21:08] really that really grieved us and there
[2:21:11] was no way for me to get off the
[2:21:12] medication because of how severe the RA
[2:21:15] was. Well, Gabe started really praying
[2:21:18] and claiming that at the July meetings I
[2:21:21] would be healed of RA. And we went
[2:21:24] through the prayer line and God
[2:21:25] miraculously healed me. I never had to
[2:21:27] take another medication. No pain after
[2:21:31] that.
[2:21:33] [Music]
[2:21:36] Then in 2023, we were told that we would
[2:21:39] not be able to have a baby and if we
[2:21:41] wanted to try, it would take extensive
[2:21:44] um intervention from the medical field.
[2:21:48] That really broke our hearts. Well,
[2:21:50] again, it was in the spring when that we
[2:21:53] were told that. So that summer, we went
[2:21:55] through the prayer line again. We
[2:21:57] claimed our healing. We claimed our
[2:21:59] promise, baby. We picked out a name and
[2:22:02] we held on to faith that we would hold
[2:22:04] our child
[2:22:06] during the journey and the wait for that
[2:22:08] cuz it is a journey. We lost two. But we
[2:22:12] rejoiced that they even existed because
[2:22:15] their lives were a testimony.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Because we did get pregnant. We did have
[2:22:19] babies.
[2:22:22] During the journey of that time, there
[2:22:24] was so many things that God sent us. So
[2:22:27] many just pastors or preachers doing
[2:22:30] sermons or encouragement to help us
[2:22:32] through that time of struggle.
[2:22:36] We finally were pregnant with our Lizzy.
[2:22:40] During the pregnancy, we had a really
[2:22:41] hard time, both her and I. Satan really
[2:22:44] fought us, but God was faithful.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; And then she was born and we rejoiced
[2:22:50] thinking that it was over. She we had
[2:22:52] her in our arms. She was safe. But three
[2:22:55] days later, we were in the NICU.
[2:22:59] This was the hardest three days of the
[2:23:01] whole journey.
[2:23:03] There was a point where we were in the
[2:23:05] Ronald McDonald's home and Lizzie was
[2:23:08] down in her room and we were just
[2:23:10] praying and crying out to God,
[2:23:13] just pleading and kind of upset
[2:23:17] after everything. Here we were
[2:23:21] and the song came back to me and the
[2:23:24] story of Isaac and Abraham
[2:23:27] and Isaac had to lay his child on the
[2:23:30] altar to give it back to the Lord
[2:23:32] knowing that he could lose that child.
[2:23:36] He had to get to that point to where he
[2:23:38] was okay in a sense of I know you'll get
[2:23:41] me through somehow.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Gabe and I prayed and
[2:23:46] we just told the Lord, you know, you
[2:23:48] gave her to us and we rejoiced that we
[2:23:50] held our promise baby and if you take
[2:23:52] her, we don't know how, but we know
[2:23:55] it'll be okay.
[2:23:58] Little did we know in the room, Lizzy
[2:24:00] was having one of the hardest episodes
[2:24:02] she had had, and there was just this
[2:24:05] pressure to go down to her.
[2:24:08] and we rushed into her room and right
[2:24:10] behind us a nurse and a doctor had come
[2:24:12] in. But as soon as we stepped in the
[2:24:14] room, she stabilized and it was over.
[2:24:17] She didn't have another issue
[2:24:20] that we went to the ENT and he was like,
[2:24:24] "She might have it, she might not." But
[2:24:27] we just praise the Lord know that she
[2:24:29] was healed that night.
[2:24:34] Again,
[2:24:37] [Music]
[2:24:39] there was just so many little things
[2:24:41] that happened and if I went into it all,
[2:24:43] it would take all day. But we just want
[2:24:45] to thank the Lord for Elizabeth Joanne
[2:24:49] and her name means God's promise or his
[2:24:52] oath and God's grace and she is a true
[2:24:55] representation of that.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:25:03] cannot fail.
[2:25:05] Because that you have said this, because
[2:25:07] that you have witnessed that you believe
[2:25:09] it. I'm going to believe this with all
[2:25:12] my heart and say God Almighty makes you
[2:25:16] well
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; cuz I know it's a scripture. It's the
[2:25:19] truth. I believe that every person comes
[2:25:22] through the line will be made totally
[2:25:24] well.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Now, what do you do with it? You don't
[2:25:28] doubt it. You hold it right before you.
