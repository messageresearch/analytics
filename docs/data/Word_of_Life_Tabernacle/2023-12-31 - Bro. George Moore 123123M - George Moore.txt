Chapter uh just for a little reading this morning and First Kings the 19th Chapter y'all pray for us we were over in uh over brother Bose and Dyersburg last night and then drove over here this morning and then after service tonight we're uh uh or after service this morning we're leaving heading to Hot Springs and we'll be doing the uh watch Night Service in Hot Springs tonight so we got quite a little bit of driving to do and and uh just ask that the Lord give us strength and I believe that um I believe God God is with his children don't you believe that today amen uh First Kings the 19th Chapter and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword and Jezebel sent a message messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to bear Sheba which belongeth to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under the juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under the juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake baked on the coals and a Cru of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drank and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the Mount of God Saints I don't know what was in them cakes but whatever was in them cakes he went on the strength of those cakes 40 days and nights Matthew the 11th chapter and 28th verse we'll read uh just a couple portions of scripture here and then you can have your seats Matthew 11 and 28 says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest amen he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word this morning Lord we know that your word is spirit and truth it's the bread of life Lord and we receive it with Thanksgiving today and Lord we just pray this morning that you would be with us in this service that you would watch over us father that you would Minister to each need minister to each Heart Lord and bless your people this morning we pray for the hearing of the word of God and Lord I just ask you to watch over me and bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen and amen I'm going to go ahead and take my coat off because it really bothers Joel when I don't you can just have your seats there now I uh I had this little topic on my heart this morning of I will give you rest and uh Jesus Promised if we would come unto me come unto him with our Laden or heavy Laden he would give us rest is that right Saints and I'll tell you this I love God's people I love the children of God I love being around the children of God I the greatest people in all the world are in this message Saints and I I it's the cream of the crop it's the it's the best of the best that's in this message and and I go all over the place and I travel all every weekend flying somewhere and and going to some church somewhere and I run across the best people in all the world Barone that I've ever been around are in The Bride of Jesus Christ and I'll tell you some of them's in this church right here this morning it's just the best hearts in all the world is that what brother brandham said and and so we love to be around God's people and I see so much sincerity in the people of God and I see so much good in the people of God now look I know we got our I know we got our faults and I know we we make mistakes and I know people do things that's wrong and I I know I know we mess up we're humans but it's still the best people in all the world Saints and I know we don't we're not perfect people but man we're blessed people and and I'd rather be around this people than any people that I know and and this is where I want to be and this is the folks that I want to be associated with and I love God's people and I see so much good and I see people that'll do anything to try to help other people and I I see people that'll pray for other people and people that'll love other people and people that'll take care of other people and if you go through the fire one time with them you'll find out what the people are made out of and I see so much good and and I see these gifts in the bride they're unbelievable we're so talented and you have such musical talent and such such vocal talent and such and such you I mean we got powerful ministers and and we just got the best of the best in the bride of Jesus Christ and I'm so thankful and I'm so glad to be a part of that aren't you glad today Saints and and it's the best people in all the world but as good as we are every one of us get tired sometimes now has anybody in here ever been tired are you tired this morning I got one person yeah we all get tired Saints we all have when we're tired and and I I don't mean tired like like you worked all day and you're tired from working tired if you get tired like that you can sleep that off in a day or two that's right amen but I'm talking about the kind of tired where you say I don't want to think about nothing else tired that's right all right I I mean tired like I I've been pulled and I've been pulled and I've been pulled and I I don't want to mess with nothing else today I'm going to go home and go to bed and hope tomorrow's a better day yes I don't I mean tired like you've been to the gym too much I I mean tired like if if somebody ask me one more question I'm going to scream tired that's good I mean tired like some of you kid uh some of you mamas get when them kids won't shut up tired some of them some of them tired like if that kid smarts off to me one more time I'm gon choke him tired that kind of tired they're kind of tired like you Brothers get sometimes when you say I'm F to walk out of this job and quit and go find me something else to do I can't stand it no more tired on yes we all deal with it Saints if you go to church long enough you're going to deal with it in church too you going you're going you're going to deal with the frustration of you know what I'm just going to let them handle it they they act like they know everything to do anyways tired sir I'm done dealing with all of it tired I'm G to find me somewhere else to go tired I'm tired my mom used to tell me that when I was a kid she say look I'm tired now and what that meant was the beating was coming if I didn't go on somewhere but we sometimes we're just sick and tired of being sick and tired sometimes we all get tired and that's that's where Elijah was when we found him under that juniper tree and we found him we found him pulled away and and we found him up under that juniper tree and he was in such a condition saints that he just didn't know what to do and and he didn't know what was going on and brother brandham said that experience of the juniper tree he said there's many of us that find ourselves under that juniper tree and he says I get myself under there many times to a place that I don't know what to do he said you're flustrated all right now many Christians don't want to admit that and many people in The Bride don't want to admit that but when we don't know what to do Saints it gets frustrating sometimes now if it frustrated God's Prophet it'll frustrate me and you right see we don't always have everything all figured out and we don't always have everything all together sometimes we just don't know what to do Saints and he said frankly I'm under it right now wondering oh God what would you have me do have you ever been there Saints where you say oh God what do you want me to do what would you have me to do what's the purpose in all of this and it's frustrating to be there Saints and he says you know people under the juniper tree is like Elijah he said they like to sleep and he said I preached to more tired people than anybody in the world he said people is so tired they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions and the hospitals everywhere and he says they went in such a nervous condition till they don't know what they do believe he said they don't know what they do believe and if you think we're not there in the message today Saints you're fooling yourself there's so many people in the message today and they're sick and tired and they're tired but they don't know what they believe and he says they don't know what they do believe and they don't know what they want amen sometimes they stuff wrong and you don't even know how to fix it you don't know what would make it right you just know you don't like it that's amen I know I'm a husband and I know sometimes mama don't know what she wants oh you brothers are scared to give me an amen but that's the truth but I want you to notice this Saints it was when the anointing left Elijah that's what put him under that juniper tree it was when the anointing left him that he found himself under the the juniper tree see that's what we're facing Saints whenever you have a mount carel experience you're going to have a juniper tree coming right whenever whenever we we get out of a good meeting let's call it like this it's Monday after a good Sunday you're going to find yourself under the juniper tree sometimes it's when the anointing lead when you come to the house of the Lord and God blesses and and the Lord's moving on the scene for people and and people are delivered and people are being uh uh rejoicing in the spirit it it's it's it's wonderful it's the greatest thing I know but when you leave that atmosphere and you go back to all the problems you had before and you got to go back to work the next day and you and you got to go back to school the next day and and you got to get back to the regular Daily Grind then you find yourself tired and under the juniper tree and feeling sorry for yourself a little bit come on somebody see when you got a good Sunday watch out for Monday come on Amen brother Brown said usually after a great something watch for the enemy and he says and it was when Elijah's nerves was all upset and he was just about to break down anyhow that's when Jezebel acted up amen it's when you're weak it's when you're tired that the enemy attacks is that right and brother Brown said that's a trick of the devil and all Christians know that so if we all know that then why are we surprised when it happen Saints he said every man and woman that's ever witnessed a great experience in Christ knows how true that is do you know that's true Saints do you know if there's a great Sunday it's going to be a bad Monday coming do you know if you get something from the Lord the devil's going to be right there to try to make you take back what the Lord give you all right do you know you know if God heals you on Sunday you know you're going to feel terrible on Monday is that right you know if you get the victory over something on Sunday and you get delivered of something on Sunday then on Monday it's going to be right there nagging at you all right to try to make you doubt what the Lord did for you on Sunday amen he said every man or woman that's ever witnessed a great experience in Christ knows how true that is he said look at our Lord after his great Earthly coronation when he was baptized and God the Holy Spirit Come ascending Out of Heaven in the form of a dove and fill his Tabernacle he said immediately he was taken in the wilderness for 40 days and was tempted of the devil right now if that's that way for the lord it's going to be that way for you and I amen now let me let me stop right here and say this Jesus was tempted it's critical we understand this Saints Jesus was tempted of the devil he was tempted actually tempted like you and I are tempted see brother brandham said when you try to make when you try to chop Jesus's legs off and make him a little smaller God than God he said you're so wrong for that he said he was a man yes and he was tempted like your tempted and he was tried like your tried except he was without sin you see he knows what you're going through today and he knows what it feels like today and he's been tempted like you've been tempted he's been tried like your tribe but he overcame and because he overcame you'll overcome is that right Saints he was a man but he was a perfect man amen you were Redeemed by a Kinsman he says when you try to make him a Lesser God see it's a critical point that we got to understand it's it's not hard to imagine that God overcomes things like that but it's hard to understand that a man can overcome things like that amen and he knows how it feels he's a God today that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities that means mental or physical weakness he's a God that can be touched by that because he's been through it himself yes right it's good so we got to be ready for the devil after these meetings we got to be ready for the devil on Monday we got to be ready for the devil on Thursday morning we got to be ready for the devil after God delivers us of something we got to start looking because here he comes Amen brother Brown said any p P's wife knows to watch him on Monday if he's had a big day on Sunday he said you might as well just let him sleep it off a little bit that's right it's the best thing for him to do he said and he said that's what God let Elijah do was sleep it off and he goes to show that when God's doing something Satan is always present to block it or tear it down or do what he can to interrupt it yeah right see he said he was wore out his nerves were all on edge just like the people today he said we we need a juniper tree he said I preach to tired people nervous people pray for nervous people and it's nervous neurotic upset world right now that we're living in and everybody's just on edge Saints I feel it myself somebody cuts me off in traffic oh if I could get a host of them saints I left I left Tucson yesterday morning at 3:00 a.m. in the morning there was one car on the road and they cut me off and if this preacher could have got a hold of them it's a nervous age where are we going what we in such a hurry for what are we so upset about it's a pressure that's on the people that's right and it's at the people at Walmart and it's at the people at the drive-thru and it's on the people at work and it's on the people at school and it's on the people before they get to church yeah all right yes it's a pressure it's pressure in your home on Sunday morning yes and he said he said that's God's people is that way he said the world is that way and we all need a juniper tree a place to rest and he said and I trust that this convention will be a juniper tree so brother brandom talked about the church services that they were having as being a juniper tree to God's people yeah so when you say well I'm too tired to go to church really Saints you're too tired not to go right see it's you got to come here to get recharged you got to come here to get refreshing you got to come here to get your batteries charged back up to get your cup filled to get the oil in the lamp that's what we come here for Saints amen you're you're not too tired not to come to CH you're too tired to come to church you're too tired not to come when you're tired that's when you need to come amen so if we get something on Monday the devil's always going to try to take it back yeah and now I remember when I was baptized my wife's grandfather told me he said now look brother George uh you just got baptized he said the devil don't like what you just did and he's going to be after you because he used to have you but now he don't amen whenever we make a move for God the devil will be after us he will be he will be pursuing to see if he can make us take back what the what the Lord did for us now I want you to notice so we find that the anointing leaves us and that leaves us tired also not being sure brother brand said of the next steps makes us tired yeah if you're not sure what to do and you're worried about what's next it wears on you mentally and spiritually if you don't know what's next if you don't know what to do next it's hard Saints and it can make you tired and we need to know everything right now that's right we live in a fast food Society we they can't get the fries out hot enough that's right and we want to know everything right now and we want the answer right now and we want God to speak to us right now and we want our prayer answered right now and we want to know what to do right now but God don't always work that way does he amen so how do we know what the will of the Lord is is well brother Bram said that God's will was his word yeah all right amen but even if you know God's word it's still doesn't mean it's the will for your life you might know what the word says it's God's will to preach the gospel is that right but it may not be God's will for you to preach the gospel amen it's God's will to be a missionary but it may not be God's will for you to be a missionary it's God's will to operate the offices and the gifts but it may not be God's will for you so we have to seek God's will for our life okay so even though we know the word of the lord we still got to seek his will for us individually and now brother brand they asked him this they said how do you feel is the best way to find the will of the Lord on some important matters now they asked the prophet at how what how do you feel is the best way for me and you to know God's will now that's a good question isn't it y'all want to hear that answer he said I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer yeah all right it's good now people don't like that answer because that's hard praying over something is hard seeking God's will is hard staying quiet before the Lord and praying is hard Saints it's difficult for us to do sometimes and we want everything easy the flesh is soft and we want everything handed to us and we want the preacher to tell us what to do or we want the pastor to tell us what to do or we want our brother to tell us what to do or we want us but we but but it's got to be God telling us what to do amen you see people want to serve the Lord and they want to do great things many times until they realize the sacrifice that goes along with it that's right yes everybody wants to have more church functions until somebody's got to put one of them on that's we used to have church functions people show up and eat and leave and they say we ought to do this every week I bet you do think we ought to do it every week I don't want to do it no more I'm tired right see the flesh wants a quick answer the flesh but it takes long nights and it takes early mornings and it takes constant mental and emotional battles to find the will of the Lord right and he and we find it that doing something for the Lord is it takes men and real men and real women and people that's got some character to do something for the Lord because it gets hard it's not for this bunch of soft jellyfish that we got today it's for real men and women yes that's right now brother Brown said this he said said here's the way I do it I take it before the Lord and it's always been my strength he said I wait upon the Lord and see what he says and I just let myself remain neutral to it so we got to go to the Lord take it to the Lord and we have to allow oursel to remain neutral right yeah good now that's the hard part Saints amen if you ever tried brother Jeremy to pray for a new truck or something it's hard to remain neutral cuz you really want that truck or you really want that house or you really want that job is that right that's right and so when you pray it's hard to remain neutral but to remain neutral means you're happy no matter what the answer is and if the answer is no you're happy anyways because that's the that's the will of the Lord amen so he says I let myself remain neutral to it he said' I don't take either side and I say now heavenly father now now he he goes on he says this and so I would if I was in your place and didn't have visions from the Lord he said I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the direction to make right so he says you go to the Lord in prayer you remain neutral and you say Lord you show me the direction to make and he said then the way you feel led to do it then just wait a little bit so the prophet said you go to the Lord in prayer you remain neutral and you see which way you feel led and then you wait a little bit see many times if we feel led to do something we just go do it come on and we say well the Lord led me to do do this amen but there's another step to it isn't it see you feel well the Lord led me to do this yeah that's how we got into all some of the messes we got into is people saying the Lord let them to do something come on now is that right Saints and he said he said just wait a little bit and then wait a little while longer yeah let me read it again he said Lord you show me what's the decision to make and in the way you feel led to do it then just wait a little bit yeah then wait a little while longer and see which side you lean towards all right he says which way the spirit he says now you say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter but I want to know what you want to do about it now that's the approach that we have to take to find the will of the Lord in our lives and that's hard Saints yeah that's difficult for you and I to do but that's the way we have to do it is that what he said Saints so we ask the Lord we remain neutral we pray we see how we feel led then we wait and then we wait a little longer yes and then we see how we feel there right it's good how many of you do that yeah me neither Saints that's what we got to get to that's where we got to go see I I'm I'm used to making decisions just like this I've been in management all my life I'm I'm used to deciding move on move on here's here's what we're going to do now move to the next now move to the next now move to the next but that's not the way it works with God Saints we have to remain neutral we have we have to take our feelings and our emotions out of it and remain neutral and say Lord I'm bringing this to you and whatever you'd have me to do whatever your answer is I'll be satisfied with it I just want to know your will amen and then we wait and we see how we feel there and we wait and we see how we feel led and then we go all right now if we can learn to wait on the Lord Watch What Happens he said Isaiah said and I I love this in Isaiah 4028 he said hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Feth not neither is weary so God don't get tired Saints it's us that gets tired and God don't run out of power it's us that runs out of virtue yeah amen he said there's no searching of his understanding he said he giveth power to the faint and to them who have no might he increases strength see he doesn't give strength to the strong but he gives strength to the weak yeah thank the Lord for that he says even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utter fall see Saints young people we don't think they get tired but young people get tired too we don't think that anything wears on the young people but it wears on the young people too the stress that we Face they face also the trials that they that they got that's the trials we got it's the same devil that's against them as against you and I and the young people get tired also right and we need to consider the pressure that the young people are under just like the pressure that we're under we need to consider the fact that they make mistakes just like we make mistakes and we need to consider the fact that they need strength just like we need strength and they need to be here just like we need to be here and they need the Holy Ghost just like we do and they need to oh God they need it Saints amen I can't imagine trying to grow up in this world today all right it's multiple times more evil than it was when I was a kid all right you know when I was a kid we'd bust each other up a little bit and maybe we get a bloody nose and maybe break a bone or two something like that but today they'll pull out a gun and shoot you when I was a kid we got into all kinds of trouble but I always knew that I was a boy I didn't have to decide I never thought I was a dog or a cat I never asked nobody to call me a they or a them that's the world these young people growing up in it's total insanity Saints and that's the problems that they deal with and that's the problems that they fight there wasn't no internet when I was a kid there wasn't no social media when I was a kid I wasn't getting pressure to be like a certain thing from all the way across the country or world but these young people do and they get tired also but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they'll walk and not faint the Bible said see if we can wait on the Lord we can get stronger while we're waiting if we pray and we'll remain neutral and we'll seek God's will we'll get stronger in the waiting now you say well brother George that sounds so hard to get a clear-cut answer well you know sometimes it is hard sometimes it is a challenged but I'd rather be challenged and know the will of God than to go haphazardly and be out of his will amen now you say well how do I know if I'm getting it right or not how do I know if I'm making the right decision or not whether the prophet said you just do the best you can and all you can do is the best you can do Saints all you can do is try as best you can that's all you can do and God knows that's all you can do and he doesn't require something of us that we're not able to fulfill yeah right amen let me read this to you he said that's the way I do about meetings sometimes he said I feel kind of led to go this way or that way he said then I follow that way that's the way to do it because it's in prayer then you're doing the best you can Saints all we can do is the best we can all we can do is try to seek God's will all we can do is try to remain neutral all we can do is try to feel how we feel L that's the best we can do amen is that right Saints what else can we do now you say well brother George I'm scared to do anything then because I might make the wrong decision well that's just exactly what the devil wants you to do see if the devil can get you to do nothing he's real happy about that all right yeah you ever been scared to make a decision cuz you scared you're going to be wrong yes that's what the devil wants you to do never to make a decision never to do anything just let it continue to ride on out amen he loves it when we do nothing but here's a promise we got I'm going to read this to you I think it'll help you brother Brown sting questions and answers he said I believe this my friends as Paul was in the New Testament in the days gone by he was between two states which way he should go yeah now this is Paul and he said he started on the wrong road yeah and he got a Macedonian call and he says and I believe if you're making a decision for God and do it the best you can I believe God will correct you and see that you don't go wrong Oh Glory to God Saints we do the best we can and we have confidence that if we do the best we can do that if we happen to do the wrong thing God will correct it right now the Bible said all things work together for the good of those that love God and are called according to his purpose how can we lose with a promise like that Saints so so the anointing leaves us it makes us tired not being sure the next step makes us tired and then there's a mental tiredness that we battle and brother BR said this that our minds we understand Saints are going a thousand miles an hour and if you just think about everything that's went through your mind since you've been in this church service yeah that ain't got nothing to do with this church service that's right we're worried about the beans or we're worried about what's in the crock pot or we're worried about what we got to do at work tomorrow we're worried about what somebody's going to think or we're worried about all these different things it's all the devil trying to force these things to interrupt the service right and it doesn't seem to be enough time in the day to get everything uh done and I'll tell you that being caught between two opinions makes you tired yes it's the spirit of the age and we find brother Brown said it's a sin from Satan uh will make anything have a nervous prostration so it's the sin that's in the world that makes us nervous it makes a nervous prostration on us now if you want to look at that you'll find that there are things that are allowed today in the message that didn't used to be allowed but because sin has abounded because everything everything's gotten so wicked by comparison it doesn't look as bad anymore but if it was wrong when the prophet preached it it's wrong today so so it's just like my daughter Emma she's not here so I can talk about her my middle daughter Emma I used to go in and I'd get on to her about her bedroom I she was a teenager and I'd say hey your room is a mess and you need to get that room cleaned up and you need to you need to do a better job of keeping it cleaned up and she looked at me and say well at least I'm not on drugs you understand it's all relative right by comparison a dirty room or drugs right but Saints it doesn't matter what she's own drugs or not the room was still dirty is that right and whether the world's gotten Wicked whether the world has lost its mind it has no bearing on the fact that you and I have to maintain the standard of this message amen and it's a sin he said that causes a nervous prostration and that's the reason we got so many nervous breakdowns and the insane institutions filling up he said we got people running through a 30 mph Zone 90 M an hour squeezing all the tar and rubber off the tires turning the corners he said they're in a nervous neurotic State they don't know what to do and all the world is nervous upset they don't know where they're standing and they're joining one church and then they're joining another church and every little thing they're running here they're running there to and fro it's because Satan has begun to push out his poison breath he's begun to blow his Winds of strife breaking churches apart separating Brotherhood as he done it today Saints breaking churches apart and separating Brotherhood and making people think that they're a little better than somebody else that they belong to a better bracket that they belong to a better Church there's only one church and that's the Church of Jesus Christ see it's exhausting to be caught between two opinions it's exhaust it'll wear a person out when they're not sure what to believe yes sir amen there was a time that I was burned out from being caught between two different schools of thoughts right see I was raised up one kind of way in the message listening to tapes and I would preach but then all of a sudden they said well we don't need to preach no more we just need to listen to tapes but I said the tapes that I'm hearing tell me I need to preach and I was caught between two opinions and it's exhausting to be caught between two opinions it's exhausting to be caught between two doctrines but finally one day it dawned on me that I don't have to have nobody's permission to believe God's word I don't have to check with nobody to make sure it's all right I can read it for myself and say Amen to it and if you're caught in such a trap and you're caught between two opinions it'll wear you out but if you just take the blinders off and believe what he said you got freedom in that Saint I don't have to call no other Pastor I don't have to call no other evangelist to see if it's all right to believe what God said about it I don't have to see if it's sanctioned by another church or not I can just believe it the way he said it oh my yes I don't have to call headquarters to make sure it's all right for me to listen to it on I can just believe it the way it said it amen I can I can reach out and grab a tape and put it in and know that tape's going to be the word of God oh God get in trouble this morning it's exhausting to be caught between two opinions so the Lord revealed to me that I don't have to have nobody's approval to believe his word amen that's right you don't either that's right see the Bible said this is a or the message says it's an individual Affair that we receive these Revelations as an individual amen I'm so grateful for this church Saints I'm so grateful I I think your pastor does a better job than almost anybody I've ever seen of keeping it between the middle of the road not getting off too far to one side of the other I appre appreciate that Saints see there's freedom in the middle of the road he said it was in the middle of the road that the sound s gospel was preached he said it was in the middle of the road that the power of God was amen so when you find all these things going on in the church you find all these ideas coming across your mind while you're in the church think about what happens Saints if the service runs a little bit long you can feel that pressure start to come in see the only part of church order anybody's ever heard is 45 minutes and once it goes over that it starts a pressure builds up you can feel it and if you watch it Saints have you ever just carried around after everybody that's got a go can go and you just sit around in the church and you hear the music's playing and the people are worshiping and everybody that's got to go check the beans has gone and check the beans and everybody that's got to go to somewhere else has gone and gone somewhere else and it's just the folks that just want to be here that's right that's good and the and the music's playing and the people relax they exhale and then you'll find the spirit of God come into the church sometimes the best Services you ever have is after service because it's a pressure that builds up on the people is that right now battles and trials will make you tired when the anointing leaves you it makes you tired if you're caught between two opinions it'll make you tired if you're not sure what's next it'll make you tired and then sometimes we're tired from hard battles and hard trials yeah true and brother Brown said that one of the things that had hurt him all through his life was a nervous condition and he said he got worn down and he got tired and when he did he got real weary and he got to feeling like nobody cared about him and he said it happens to every one of us is that right Saints and he said when you get to feeling that way none of it is true right see there's never a time when don't nobody care about you that's right if the devil tries to tell you that just show him all the folks in this church this morning amen is that right Saints and God knows her struggles and he came in the form of a man and he knows what it's like to be tired and he was tired and he went to sleep on that boat that time remember but oh when he stood up Saints when he woke up the winds and the way obeyed him he he's a God that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and he said I will give you rest now Saints to you and I that's the Holy Ghost today and he said fear Hebrews 4:1 says let us therefore fear lest the promise being left of us of entering into his rest that any should come short of it and he said there remaineth therefore the rest a rest to the people of God for if he that has entered into this rest rest he has also ceased from his own works as God did for his now brother brandham talks about this scripture and he says if you've never received the Holy Ghost you've never entered into God's rest that's right right amen amen and he says you don't have to say oh I couldn't I I want to smoke I just couldn't do it I'm a Christian he says I really don't want to drink but I'm a Christian I just can't I I I don't want to drink but yet I like to he said if you lust after women if you do ungodly things you've never hit that rest period yet and he said you've never entered into that rest and when you enter into this rest you cease from your own worldly works like God did from his you're a part of God you rest eternally he said so the Holy Ghost is the rest to The Believer by taking all of this stuff that we're carrying and taking it off of our plates and putting it over on the shoulders of Jesus see instead of us carrying all of our burdens instead of us carrying all of our trials instead of us dealing with all of our Temptations we can we can take them off and hand them to Jesus is that right Saints so worldly desire can be laid upon him and complexes can be laid upon him and insecurity can be laid upon him and heartache can be laid upon him and stress can be laid on him and trials can be laid on him and anxiety can be laid on him and depression can be laid on and your family oh your children you can lay them on Jesus yes and when we lay them on him we don't have to carry them and we can rest this morning Saints but it's not a get out of jail free card we got to do it we got to let go we got to give up we got to give it to him we got to take these trials and say I can't do nothing with them no more but I'm going to give them to Jesus and I'm going to let him handle them I can't I can't do nothing about my health I can't make myself feel no better but I'm going to give it to Jesus and he can handle it yes I can't do nothing about what the doctor said I can't do nothing about my job I can't do nothing about work I can't do nothing about my home I can't do nothing about my marriage but I can give it to him amen and I can let him handle it see Elijah was fighting the greatest battle ever fought he was tired he was under the juniper tree he was dealing with some stuff in his head now this was a great man he just come up under the great anointing he called fire down from heaven a few days before he he just put to death 400 prophets of Baal and 450 prophets of the Groves he wanted tremendous victory for Israel and in a few days later he's he's he's laying under a juniper tree asking God to take his life right brother BR said he was running from the threat of a woman is that right because the anointed had left him and it was Monday and his mind was going crazy on It come on somebody and I want you to notice what Elijah was dealing with he was dealing deal with number one self-doubt he said I am no better than my father's are you kidding me a man like Elijah saying I'm no better than my fathers none of Elijah's fathers did anything near close to what Elijah did this was a man of God this was a man that God used is that right he was a great man and he here he is sitting under a juniper tree saying I'm no better than my fathers he said oh my goodness see that's that same old devil that's trying to tell you how you're going to turn out that's the same old devil you take the baddest worst person in your family and anytime something goes wrong the devil's going to tell you you're going to turn out just like them that's the same old devil Saints now well I want you to notice this the prophet said he said if you got an inbred weakness from some sickness that you inherited from your peoples back there in the generations he said each one of us is growing weaker and wiser he said the blood of Jesus Christ sir right atoned for that at Calvary it don't matter what your background is and it don't matter what your family did and it don't matter how people acted before you and it don't matter that your aunts got some kind of mental illness and none of that matters because Jesus Christ atoned for that at Calvary Saints all right that's what the blood of Jesus Christ did he said you you don't have to be judged you don't have to think yourself worthy you'll never be worthy I ain't trying to get good enough Saints yeah he said but Christ was worthy in your stead right oh God he said that price he paid it he said now try not trying to redeem something you can't redeem it cuz you ain't got the money to do it he said but God had the money and he sent Christ and settled the bill and redeemed you from your sickness and your sorrow and your worry and your sin and your backsliding he sent the money which was Christ Jesus and deposited it on Calvary on gatha's hill and tonight every one of you is free and you just believe it he said oh God yes sir that's a promise Saints it's not how good I am it's how good he was he paid the price that I couldn't pay I couldn't save myself so he had to save me the other thing he was dealing with was his selfworth he said Elijah said it'd be better off if I wasn't even here it'd be better off if I was never born it'd be better the world would be better without me come on somebody see if the devil can get you to think that and he can get you to think you're not worthy he's got you right there see that's why we got more young people that's damaging their bodies and they're cutting their s and they're they're putting all these piercings and stuff in and they're and they're desecrating their bodies because they've lost their selfworth that's that's why they get trapped people get trapped in abusive relationships because because they don't think they deserve any better that's why we got so much suicide that somebody would so lose their selfworth till they would try to take their own life that's why we got so much sexual deviance because people don't value themselves enough to keep themselves pure is that right Saints and if you believe though saints that you're worth something and you believe that you're worth a great deal and you believe that there's value in you that there's worth in you that God has a purpose for you that God has a plan for you that there's Redemption for you that your price has been paid that your debt has been settled that God has a reason for you being here all right yes sir then you tell that devil to go jump in the river because you're here to serve the Lord it's our selfworth Saints God don't make no mistakes right he didn't call you to this for no reason come on he didn't pull you out of the darkness to bring you here for no reason he didn't pick you up out of the mud and clean you up and give you the Holy Ghost for no reason oh he's got a plan for us Saints that's good but it's just because we don't look at it through God's eyes we're looking at it through our eyes and when you look at me through your eyes you see all kind of faults but we got to look at it through God's eyes amen no matter what you done brother BR said when God sees you've confessed your sins and God looks through the blood of the Lord Jesus he sees you Snow White all right yes that's what the prophet said he says no matter what you done he's looking through you through Christ's blood you're redeemed he said he said you can't do it yourself no matter how much you want to you can't do it it's a gift of God right and no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll give him everlasting life and raise him up in the last day now I love this he says and when God has borne you a new by the Holy Spirit he can only look upon you that's a perfect work because he did it himself yes oh my that's good you're God's workmanship it's by Sovereign Grace is that right I feel pretty poorly about myself sometimes but I'm not responsible for how I feel I'm responsible for what he said and he said that I'm covered under the blood he said that I'm redeemed he said that I'm a new creature he said that I'm a Child of God now think about this Saints if if a cow out here has a calf what species is that calf come on somebody this ain't hard it's a cow all right y'all little slow all right so if a horse has a cult what species is that cult it's a horse so if God has a son or daughter what species is that son or daughter how will that son or daughter act what will proceed out of their mouth what will they say what will they do they're here to represent God Amen oh my we all get to these places where we had to have some help and Elijah was to get to the point to where he had to have somebody take care of him he had to let go and let God take care of him yeah and we got to get in that same position of Letting Go to today we got to get in the same position of letting God handle it all right brother Brown said it's the same with us he said it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God he said then he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the spirit and anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours by letting go and letting God yes see we got to stop trying to do everything oursel as a musicians come this morning now when you enter into this rest you have to cease from your own worldly works is that right and he said we're insufficient ourselves he said then we're subjects to yield to God's spirit when we can't do it ourself we're subjects to yield to God's spirit and he says as as long as we think we can do it we can't do it he said but when you get to the place to where we know we can't do it then we yield oursel to God and he does it so then he said it's not us trying to do it he said if we try to do it we'll fail but we yield oursel to God and God can he said because there's only one thing that God can't do and that's fail and he said we have to master the the uh the thought of human ability we got to get a hold of the fact that we don't have the ability is that right Saints and if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it ourselves with our own intelligent he said he said we got to master that in such a way and get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that God can use us he says it's hard because we're always wanting to put our part in it but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong WR and God will never use that effort amen so I want to leave you this morning with three points well Jo just go ahead and sing something three points here there's many things in our life that make us [Music] tired the second point is Jesus has given us a rest to enter into and then lastly we have something to do today we have to enter into that rest he said come to me and I'll give you rest so how do we do that he said by letting go and letting God have it letting go of our ideas letting go of our trials letting go of our sins lay aside to wait and sin that so easily besets us letting go of our pride letting go of our stubbornness letting go of anything in us that's hindering us whatever is hindering our walk whatever's taking up his time whatever's whatever's causing us grief whatever is grieving our spirit we got to let go today we got to let go and let God have his way Saints I think we all know when we do something we're not supposed to I think we all know when we're spending too much time on our phones or we're spending too much time on the TV or we're spending too much time doing some kind of worldly entertainment I think we all know that but we got to let it go and see when we empty out then we're subjects to fill back up when we give those things over to God that leaves room for him to come in and he said you can't put this new wine in the old wine skin the wine skins got to be changed it's got to be a new wine skin that can stretch out with the good things of God he wants to be our savior but he also wants to be our Lord today he wants to have rulership over us amen as long as we're fighting our own battles he can't fight them for us do y'all believe that this morning let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus oh we're so grateful today Lord that you've been you became Kinsmen to us that you came down and met each trial that we face and you fought the battles that we fight and you were Victorious without sin and you redeemed us today and Lord Jesus we're thankful that we can be new creatures today we're thankful that we can take a new wine skin and fill up oh God God lord Jesus help us surrender today Lord whatever it is in our lives whatever is a hindrance to us oh God we give that over to you today whatever is causing us grief whatever where wherever we're getting in the way Lord may we get ourselves out of the way may we take our hands off of it and just give it to you today Lord Jesus and I pray oh God that you let us enter into that rest oh we got burdens and we got trials we got tests but Lord we want to be resting in them Lord we want to hand them to you Lord and and have confidence and faith that you're on the scene that you're doing according to your perfect will Lord God we just ask you to help us today take anything out of us Lord that's a hindrance to you fill us everyone with the Holy Holy Ghost Lord Jesus may it never be a one-time occurrence but Lord may this Holy Ghost be baptism after baptism after baptism may it be refilling after refilling may it be birth after birth after birth Lord may we always continue to grow may we continue to get better as the days go along and one day Lord we know we'll get so full of the goodness of God that gravity will lose its whole and will be taken on Lord and we look forward to that day Lord but until that time father we want to serve you with all of our heart all that's in US Lord and I just pray for this church Lord I pray for brother Ben today Lord I ask you to give him rest Lord in his body rest his family Lord Jesus strengthen them Father Lord bless the ministry here Lord as as he's away father bless the Saints here father bless the officers here Lord the musicians oh God I pray you just continue to bless this church as you have father and oh God we just commit it into your hands and we love you and we thank you and we we we lord we commit all of it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen oh God teach me Lord to that's your prayer

not be weary they shall walk and not F teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait Saints while we while we worship the Lord just want to extend this opportunity that if you're biting something this morning and you can't turn it loose that's what we got to do is turn it loose and it's hard to turn it loose for men it's hard because we want to fix everything but for the Sisters for the young people it's hard to turn these things loose many times there's things we know that's not doing us any good but we we can't turn them loose I know what that's like Saints I've been there myself many times but we got to master the thought of human ability we got to master the thought that we can fix it oursel and we got to hand it to the Lord this morning so while we worship the Lord this morning if you have a need like that and you like prayer I'll be willing to pray for all that all that I can I'll pray that God will help you move through that but we got to do it we got to let it go we got to turn it loose we got to give it up and we got to let go and let God today so as We Worship the Lord just think about those things and say Lord what is hindering me what is holding me back what what do I need to let go of so that I can move forward in the kingdom of God Saints we are looking for a rapture we are looking for a Time of going home and all these little things has got to go we got to get light
