[37:17] 10:5 and the angel which I saw stand
[37:20] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[37:22] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[37:24] that liveth forever and ever who created
[37:26] Heaven and the things that there in are
[37:28] and the earth and the things that there
[37:30] in are and the Sea and the things which
[37:32] are therein that there should be time no
[37:35] longer but in the days of the voice of
[37:37] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[37:40] sound the mystery of God should be
[37:43] finished as he hath declared to his
[37:47] servants the prophets pray the Lord
[37:49] would add his Blessing to the word you
[37:51] may be seated I want to continue talking
[37:53] to you about the seventh seal to tonight
[37:57] uh I I would say that all of us uh would
[38:00] uh say that we live at the time of the
[38:02] end I think I could have agreement on
[38:05] that tonight I think that the world can
[38:07] even see that you can see time speeding
[38:09] up I've even watched uh nominal
[38:12] preachers denominational preachers that
[38:14] will uh recognize the hour that we're
[38:17] living in recognize time has sped up and
[38:20] and we're right at the close of things
[38:22] if you look at the wars and rumors of
[38:24] War they just keep coming faster and
[38:26] faster if you look at earthquakes if you
[38:29] look at uh pandemics if you look at
[38:31] things that are happening all over the
[38:33] world it ought to we ought to be awake
[38:35] and and recognize where we're at I don't
[38:39] know if you if you know it but when you
[38:42] say that we live at the time of the end
[38:44] you're saying that we live at the
[38:46] opening of the book sealed with Seven
[38:50] Seals that we're living in the time if
[38:52] we could say it this way of the opening
[38:54] the breaking of the seventh seal because
[38:58] then the book is open and so brother
[39:00] Brandon puts it this way he said we must
[39:02] remember that this seventh seal is the
[39:05] end of time of all
[39:09] things the end of all things he said
[39:13] that's right the things written in the
[39:15] seven sealed book sealed up of the Plan
[39:18] of Redemption because this book is the
[39:21] Plan of Redemption this is how God is
[39:23] going to redeem his elect from the Earth
[39:26] both the Jews and Gentiles so the entire
[39:29] Plan of Redemption is written in the
[39:30] scripture and then it was sealed up with
[39:33] Seven Seals and now that sealed book has
[39:36] been open and so the seventh seal is the
[39:39] end that's it of all things and it's
[39:44] like you've been sitting through the
[39:45] movie and you've watched it to the end
[39:47] and and the the the the letters have
[39:50] shown on it the end the seventh seal the
[39:54] end oh I think we're living at that time
[39:56] time and I think it ought to do our
[39:58] hearts good if you know where you're
[40:00] going and and you know in whom you have
[40:02] believed and you know that that you're
[40:04] you're a Believer the message of the
[40:06] hour it ought to it ought to do
[40:07] something for you to think that we're
[40:09] living at the end but I'm ready for it
[40:12] to be the end we're living at the end of
[40:14] all things but I know where I'm going I
[40:17] know I know my family's going to be
[40:19] there I know I'm going to be there it
[40:22] ought to give us hope today and as we as
[40:24] we get into these things
[40:27] the brand said it's the end it every bit
[40:29] ends it's the end it's the end of the
[40:30] struggling world it's the end of
[40:32] struggling nature it's the end of
[40:36] everything yeah he said in there it's
[40:38] the end of the trumpets it's the end of
[40:40] the vials it's the end of the Earth it's
[40:42] even the end of time now brother random
[40:46] takes that from Revelation chapter 10
[40:48] and we're going to go there and deal
[40:50] with Revelation chapter 10 uh tonight uh
[40:53] uh for for a while and and kind of see
[40:56] where he took that from because he said
[40:57] it's the end of time you can't just say
[41:00] that uh it has to have been written in
[41:02] the scripture and it was Revelation
[41:04] chapter 10 we find that uh we we had a
[41:08] book that was sealed with Seven Seals
[41:10] and the lamb took the book in Revelation
[41:12] chapter five and open the seals in
[41:15] chapter 6 and chapter 8 but here is in
[41:19] in chapter 10 he said I saw another
[41:23] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[41:26] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[41:29] upon his head and his face was as it
[41:32] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[41:36] fire now this is
[41:38] Christ he he comes from heaven so he's
[41:42] not an Earthly messenger this is Christ
[41:46] and I'll say this to you tonight this
[41:47] message has to be more than just William
[41:50] brandom it's got to be Christ you you
[41:54] have to be able to see a mighty angel
[41:56] coming down in our day amen I'm so glad
[42:00] that I'm so glad that he introduced me
[42:02] to Jesus Christ I I want to get ahead of
[42:05] myself so badly in these things but
[42:07] we're just going to have to get a little
[42:08] bit into it tonight and been studying
[42:10] these things and I just it just
[42:12] overwhelms me with the the grace that
[42:14] he's shown Us in this hour and I just
[42:16] want to live up to it I I just want to
[42:18] be that bride that's one with the groom
[42:20] I I just want to represent him in the
[42:23] age that I live
[42:25] in he comes from Heaven he's wrapped
[42:29] with a cloud I know some of you when we
[42:31] start preaching on these things you're
[42:32] sitting there thinking there he goes
[42:35] again but it matters to you and I
[42:38] believe we can make it simple enough and
[42:41] in fact I think what happens many times
[42:43] we just make it complicated but if we
[42:45] just preach the word I think many times
[42:47] it's simple enough the Bible said a fool
[42:49] won't air there in I think it's simple
[42:51] enough we can all understand it even our
[42:53] children and young people can understand
[42:56] and so there's something here for you
[42:57] tonight just just get a hold of it feed
[43:00] on it feed on it let it not not my words
[43:03] but the words of a prophet the words of
[43:05] the scripture let's just feed on this
[43:07] teaching now tonight now he's wrapped
[43:10] with a cloud and and we know that when
[43:13] he comes at his third coming he comes
[43:15] with clouds in Revelation 1:7 remember
[43:18] there's three comings of Christ his
[43:19] first coming when he come to the Earth
[43:22] his second coming is a Rapture his third
[43:24] coming as when comes and sets his or
[43:27] steps on the Mount of Olives this is his
[43:30] third comings we know that because it
[43:31] says every eye shall see him he said but
[43:33] he cometh with
[43:35] clouds and and every eye shall see him
[43:37] now we know on Mount Transfiguration
[43:39] there was a cloud in Mark
[43:42] 9:2 after six days Jesus taketh with him
[43:45] Peter and James and John and leadth them
[43:47] up into a high mountain apart by
[43:49] themselves and he was transfigured
[43:51] before them we could say he was
[43:53] separating the bride from the
[43:55] church and he and he brought them up
[43:57] into Mount Transfiguration and when he
[44:00] leads them up into a high mountain he
[44:01] was transfigured oh my I
[44:05] trust I'm going to have to stop I'm
[44:07] gonna get in trouble tonight but this
[44:09] message has to transfigure Christ to
[44:13] us right it has to change our view of
[44:16] Jesus Christ we have to see him as deity
[44:20] we got to see him as present we got to
[44:22] see him as as being real as being the
[44:25] same yesterday today and forever it's
[44:27] this message that does that for
[44:29] us so his reignment become exceed
[44:32] shining exceeding white as snow so it's
[44:34] no Fuller on Earth can WIP them and
[44:37] there appeared unto them Elias with
[44:38] Moses and they were talking with Jesus
[44:41] and Peter being being Peter he had to
[44:43] say something and he said to Jesus
[44:45] Master it's good for us to be here and
[44:47] let us make three Tabernacles one for
[44:50] thee and one for Moses and one for Elias
[44:53] he said we might as well just set up a a
[44:55] little denomination
[44:56] he said for he wished not what to say
[44:58] for they were sore afraid and there was
[45:00] a cloud that overshadowed them and a
[45:04] voice come out of the cloud saying this
[45:08] is my beloved Son right hear him so the
[45:12] cloud identified the presence of the Sun
[45:16] the word in their midst now brother
[45:18] brandom speaking of his coming with
[45:20] clouds he said he's coming how is he
[45:22] coming with clouds what kind of cloud
[45:24] clouds of Glory he said' not one of
[45:27] these thunderheads a raincloud but
[45:28] Clouds Of Glory he saidou watch what
[45:31] kind of a cloud he was enshrouded in
[45:32] when Peter and them saw his vision on
[45:34] Mount Transfiguration a cloud
[45:36] overshadowed him his rment shine he was
[45:39] enshrouded with the cloud the power of
[45:41] God so he's descending in Revelation
[45:43] chapter 10 from Heaven clothed with
[45:47] Glory clothed with power clothed in a
[45:53] cloud wrapped in a cloud and a rainbow
[45:57] Covenant over his
[45:59] head brother Brandon said now here is
[46:01] the angel on
[46:03] Earth and another Angel Mighty messenger
[46:08] come down he said see this Angel was an
[46:11] Earthly Angel messenger we all know who
[46:13] that was he said But Here Comes one down
[46:16] from heaven a rainbow Covenant only
[46:19] Christ it could be I just love the way
[46:22] he summarizes that only Christ it could
[46:25] be now the great question of the message
[46:27] and and I know you've been taught these
[46:28] things and I believe that probably you
[46:30] agree with me on these things but if you
[46:32] don't you're welcome to study it for
[46:34] yourself but the question that we would
[46:37] ask in the message then is has this
[46:39] Angel descended or it's just a future
[46:42] event and so brother Brandon preaches he
[46:46] doesn't really deal with the mighty
[46:47] Angel until 1962 in in a message called
[46:51] is this the sign of the end sir on the
[46:53] last day of the year in 1962 brother
[46:56] brandham begins to identify his ministry
[46:59] with Revelation 10
[47:01] 1-7 Revelation 10
[47:04] 1-7 he sees the the the seventh angel
[47:07] there in verse 7 and he begins to
[47:09] identify things taking place or that
[47:11] will take place and and he begins by
[47:14] telling the story of what happened at
[47:15] the river in
[47:17] 1933 he said as John the Baptist was
[47:20] sent forth to forun the first coming of
[47:22] Christ you're sent forth with a message
[47:24] to forrun the second coming of Christ
[47:27] right so there had to be there was a
[47:29] purpose in him coming and it was to
[47:31] forun the second coming of Christ so he
[47:33] tells about a vision and he goes into we
[47:35] don't have time to go into it tonight
[47:37] but he goes through a series of six
[47:39] dreams and which pred him to go west Go
[47:44] West Young man go west he's he he's he's
[47:48] being forced out of his comfort zone in
[47:51] Jeffersonville and told to go west he
[47:54] said six straight dreams and then a
[47:56] vision kept it and of course we know the
[47:58] vision of of the uh them tearing up his
[48:01] his road and in front of his house and
[48:04] doing those things and so the vision
[48:06] capped off the dreams and then he said
[48:08] when these things come to pass turn
[48:11] Westward turn Westward go west now and I
[48:15] don't want to bore you tonight but we
[48:17] got to lay this in here before we go
[48:19] somewhere we had a vision of seven birds
[48:21] that formed a pyramid and flew Eastward
[48:25] and and he talked about that and and he
[48:27] talked about the little birds and then
[48:29] some that were a little larger and then
[48:30] angels He said and in the vision he said
[48:33] I was at Tucson Arizona he made it so
[48:36] purpose that he didn't want me to fail
[48:37] to see where it was at I was picking a
[48:39] sandur off of me from the desert and I
[48:42] said now I know this is a vision I know
[48:43] I'm at Tucson I know them little birds
[48:45] there represent something they're
[48:47] watching Eastward all of a sudden they
[48:48] took a notion to fly way they went
[48:51] Eastward and as soon as they left the
[48:52] constellation of larger Birds came and
[48:54] they look like does with sharp pointed
[48:56] Wings kind of a gray color a little
[48:58] lighter color than what these first
[49:00] little Messengers was and they were
[49:02] coming Eastward swiftly no sooner than
[49:04] they got out of my sight I turned again
[49:06] to look Westward and there it happened
[49:08] he said there was a blast that actually
[49:09] shook the whole earth a blast he said I
[49:11] thought it sounded like a sound barrier
[49:13] ever what you call in plaines across the
[49:15] sound he said just shook roared
[49:17] everything said it could have been a
[49:18] great clap of thunder and lightning he
[49:21] said but it shook the Earth and when it
[49:22] did I was still looking Westward and way
[49:25] off into it eternity I saw a
[49:26] constellation of something coming it
[49:29] looked like it might have been little
[49:30] dots there could have been no less than
[49:31] five not more than seven in the shape of
[49:33] a pyramid like these Messengers coming
[49:35] when it did the power of almighty God
[49:38] lifted me up to meet them now he he
[49:42] talked about how and we're get into that
[49:44] another time he talked about how these
[49:46] little birds and the larger Birds and
[49:48] the angels represented the first second
[49:50] and third poll of his ministry and and
[49:53] he thought maybe it was his death it was
[49:55] his time to go this great blast would
[49:57] take him off the Earth but the Lord
[49:58] showed him it was not his death he said
[50:01] but a new commission and he begins to
[50:03] tie it to Revelation 10 and he says this
[50:06] he said now s he said as I entitled this
[50:09] is this the sign of the end time where
[50:13] are we living I think we could ask that
[50:15] question tonight where are we living
[50:17] what time of day is it as the weary
[50:20] wrestler through the night raising and
[50:23] turning on the clock look to see what
[50:25] what it is turning up the light have you
[50:28] ever been Restless at night it seems
[50:31] like the last few years of my life I've
[50:33] got more and more Restless at night and
[50:36] I find myself weary even though I'm I'm
[50:40] I'm I'm resting but I'm weary and and
[50:42] many of you probably experiened that and
[50:44] you're looking to see what time it is
[50:46] because you know the day is breaking
[50:48] eventually and so he said that's what it
[50:50] was like preaching this sermon what what
[50:53] what time of day is it where are we at
[50:55] and so he he knows the day coming but he
[50:57] don't know exactly when but something
[50:59] was coming and he said my prayer is God
[51:02] let us turn on the
[51:04] light and we know that Revelation 10:7
[51:07] was the seventh angel messenger when he
[51:10] should begin to sound the seventh angel
[51:12] the mystery of God should be finished as
[51:14] he had declared to his servants the
[51:16] prophets he said now when he begins to
[51:18] sound the mystery will be finished he
[51:20] said then it's time for the seven seal
[51:21] voices of Revelation 10 to be revealed
[51:24] he said do you understand the
[51:25] congregation says amen he said when all
[51:28] the Mysteries someone say all all the
[51:31] mysteries of the book has been completed
[51:34] and the Bible said here that he would
[51:35] finish the Mysteries again he says and
[51:38] I'm skipping through this but you can go
[51:40] back and listen to the taper read it he
[51:42] said seven Thunders right in the
[51:43] Revelation here of Jesus Christ it's
[51:45] some mystery does not the Bible say this
[51:48] is the this is the revelation of Jesus
[51:50] Christ why there is some hidden Mystery
[51:52] then of it what is it the seven Thunders
[51:54] have it
[51:56] John was about to write and a voice came
[51:57] down from heaven and said don't write it
[51:59] but seal it seal it up put it on the
[52:01] back side of the book it's got to be
[52:03] revealed it's the Mysteries and so again
[52:06] he says time shall be no more he
[52:08] announces that time is
[52:10] over huh I wonder where we're living at
[52:14] church announces that time is over you
[52:17] know the how you view that depends on
[52:20] what you're looking
[52:22] for right time is over if if you're
[52:25] waiting on something to happen if you're
[52:27] waiting on something good when time is
[52:30] up that's a good thing if you're waiting
[52:33] on something bad to happen then when
[52:35] time is over you get nervous because you
[52:37] realize your time's running out you
[52:40] realize don't you realize that's the way
[52:41] we ought to be with anticipation we're
[52:43] not waiting on a squeeze we're not
[52:46] waiting on a we're not waiting on a on a
[52:48] a war we're not waiting on uh everything
[52:52] to blow up because we're going to be
[52:54] gone when that happens
[52:56] what are we looking for the change of
[52:57] our bodies where are we at we're just
[53:00] waiting on our change then then then
[53:03] what are we doing we're with
[53:04] anticipation we're saying time should be
[53:07] no more means that oh my it's over a and
[53:11] I know I'm getting close the Daybreak is
[53:13] coming right
[53:15] away now he said what happens could that
[53:18] be so now Brethren seriously think he
[53:20] said if it is then the pyramid is capped
[53:23] with the seven Thunders he goes through
[53:25] statue of a perfect man which by the way
[53:26] that's where uh Joe Coleman and them got
[53:29] the the Thunders Doctrine from uh that
[53:31] they went back and made that the virtues
[53:33] uh but brother Bram doesn't say the
[53:35] Thunders are the virtues he said it's
[53:36] like that he said it's like that the way
[53:39] he works for individual is the way he
[53:40] works in the church ages he said then if
[53:43] it that be so he's got seven Church ages
[53:45] he's had seven Mysteries that's been
[53:47] sounded away and they fought for it to
[53:49] bring back he said and now the headstone
[53:51] comes to cap off the church does the
[53:53] Thunders mean that my brother and sir
[53:55] is that where we're at now watch brother
[53:59] brandham talked about how that he said
[54:01] the church knows it's the truth the
[54:03] scientific world knows it's the truth
[54:06] and he talked about how that people that
[54:09] were sitting there and still living that
[54:12] were standing on the river when that
[54:13] voice spoke out and said as John was
[54:15] sent forth with the message of the first
[54:16] coming so is this the second message of
[54:18] the second coming and so there were
[54:20] people there that could have
[54:22] contradicted him but they
[54:23] didn't right right now he said if it's
[54:26] finished what did John do John was the
[54:29] one who said behold there's the Lamb of
[54:31] God that takes away the sin of the world
[54:33] that's him he said is the hour has it
[54:36] arrived my brother and I don't say it
[54:38] has I don't know but I'm asking you
[54:40] because brother brandom is not sure what
[54:42] exactly is going to happen but he's
[54:44] preaching prophetically he said I want
[54:46] you to think or will this be the time
[54:48] when will will it it will be again
[54:49] Behold the Lamb of God or the time of
[54:52] Malachi for to return the hearts of the
[54:54] children back to the the Faith of Our
[54:56] Fathers it's interesting that all of the
[54:58] things brother brandom mentions here is
[55:00] what happened at the opening of the
[55:02] seals and during the rest of his
[55:04] ministry that it was those divinely
[55:06] revealed mystery truths that literally
[55:08] turned the hearts of the children back
[55:09] to the hearts of the fathers and don't
[55:11] you realize that he doesn't even know
[55:12] what he's what he's saying he said could
[55:15] it be this could it be that could it be
[55:17] that and it was all of
[55:20] that amen I love the way God
[55:23] works and and we went through that
[55:25] recently the way a prophet God speaks to
[55:28] a prophet the prophet doesn't have to
[55:30] understand what he's saying for it to be
[55:33] thus sayith the Lord sir right it just
[55:36] has to be what God said whatever God
[55:38] said is thus sayith the Lord whatever
[55:40] God says is the absolute is that right
[55:43] it's just whatever God says now a and
[55:46] and so a prophet even though being human
[55:49] he could make mistakes but when when he
[55:51] spoke prophetically thus sayith the Lord
[55:54] that was God God speaking through a
[55:56] prophet and now he said when they see
[55:59] that Mighty blast sweep forth will it
[56:00] turn their hearts back to the father oh
[56:03] I believe today that our hearts have
[56:05] been turned back I think that's why
[56:06] you're here on a Wednesday night because
[56:08] you may have failed in your body you may
[56:10] have failed in your flesh you you might
[56:12] have this week you might have failed in
[56:13] some way but your heart's been turned
[56:15] back it wasn't your mind that got turned
[56:17] back because if you got talked into it
[56:19] you could get talked out of it but your
[56:21] heart got turned back we're living when
[56:24] that has already taken place brother JT
[56:27] good to see you back there buddy that
[56:29] that it's already taken place our hearts
[56:32] have been turned back to the father or
[56:35] was this the message already passed he
[56:36] said that should have done it I don't
[56:38] know he said this is the sign of the end
[56:40] time SS or is this the sign that is over
[56:44] he said it looks very scriptural to me I
[56:45] don't know was some angels there was a
[56:47] blast like a thunder That Shook the
[56:48] whole earth God knows I tell the truth
[56:51] just remember something is fixing to
[56:53] happen he said I don't know what it is
[56:55] but it could could it be this he said
[56:57] the reason I say this prepare yourselves
[57:00] let us pray pray how take our position
[57:02] in the army of his Believers prepare
[57:04] ourselves maybe later than we're
[57:07] thinking amen I it's easy to get caught
[57:10] up just in life it's easy to just get
[57:13] caught up and say well it's another
[57:14] Wednesday night it's another time to get
[57:15] together and and just have church but I
[57:18] think we need to recognize where we're
[57:19] at what day and hour that it is
[57:22] everything's coming to what it is every
[57:24] every seed that's been planted is coming
[57:26] to fruition in this age it's time for us
[57:28] to come to what we are amen oh my we've
[57:32] been preaching this for years this isn't
[57:34] the first time that someone's preached
[57:36] on the seven seal or the opening of the
[57:38] word as we know it this isn't the first
[57:40] time but we at some point we go we're
[57:42] not just preaching about it but we're
[57:44] manifesting it we're becoming what he
[57:48] said so he said it may be later than
[57:51] we're thinking now in February
[57:53] 1963 brother Brandon is hunting Havalina
[57:56] hogs in the Coronado Forest about 40
[57:59] miles Northeast of Tucson I've been out
[58:01] there it's it's really not much to look
[58:04] at you know God does things he hides
[58:07] himself in
[58:08] Simplicity reveals himself in the same
[58:11] think about it God's going to Signal the
[58:14] end of time and the change over from
[58:18] Mercy to judgment which thank God
[58:20] there's still Mercy he's still on The
[58:21] Mercy Seat aren't you glad for that but
[58:24] there's a change coming there's a change
[58:26] over the the approach to Mercy the
[58:28] things have begun to change and and we
[58:31] begin to see that he signaled that by a
[58:35] a prophet who was hunting
[58:38] hogs picking a burr off of
[58:41] his off of his pants
[58:45] leg you said wh why would why would that
[58:48] happen like that see we don't realize
[58:49] the seemingly inconsequential moments of
[58:52] our lives but there will come a time
[58:54] when it be the the last time you ever
[58:55] brushed your teeth there will come a
[58:57] time it'll be the last time you ever got
[58:59] up to go to work there will come a time
[59:01] be the last time it's one of these days
[59:04] brother Joe it's going to be the last
[59:05] time and you look in the mirror and you
[59:07] begin to see loved ones coming behind
[59:08] you brother BR said we would be raised
[59:10] with our own generation the people that
[59:12] we knew and so they'll come up because
[59:14] they knew you and they'll begin to walk
[59:16] right in there with you and begin to see
[59:18] you begin to see them and all of a
[59:19] sudden you look down what's this Sudden
[59:21] Change he said a sweep goes over us and
[59:23] all of a sudden man amen we're changed
[59:26] we're taken up in a moment in the
[59:27] twinkling of an eye wh what's going what
[59:30] what what does that what what will be
[59:32] the all this momentous event that that
[59:35] precedes that you say well maybe we'll
[59:36] be in church or brother Ben will be
[59:37] preaching or maybe we'll be in church
[59:39] and and somebody I like to hear preach
[59:41] will be preaching or maybe there'll be a
[59:43] maybe there'll be a situation where I'll
[59:45] have a warning no it won't be any
[59:47] warning at all it'll just happen one day
[59:50] you might be brushing your teeth you
[59:51] might be you might be getting up you
[59:53] might be going to bed you you might be
[59:55] you might be in bed
[59:56] sleeping but it's going to take
[1:00:02] place just inconsequential moments sir
[1:00:06] of Our Lives don't you think we ought to
[1:00:07] always be
[1:00:09] ready just it don't matter but it does
[1:00:15] matter it's a ridge really to on or
[1:00:18] sunset
[1:00:20] Mountain just another place in the
[1:00:22] desert but it's the fulfill F of
[1:00:25] Prophecy brother brandham doesn't know
[1:00:27] it
[1:00:28] yet and
[1:00:30] so when he tells the story he begins to
[1:00:34] realize all everything that happened and
[1:00:36] they show him you know the cloud picture
[1:00:39] that was taken in Life Magazine which
[1:00:40] was just a confirmation of what took
[1:00:43] place but they show him the cloud
[1:00:45] picture and the angel said turn it to
[1:00:46] the right and you see whose face it was
[1:00:48] I I I really don't care what they say
[1:00:51] made the
[1:00:52] cloud but who's for form was it in form
[1:00:56] did it take it's
[1:00:59] Christ it's
[1:01:01] Christ and I believe that Seven Angels
[1:01:06] were his
[1:01:08] beard were his wig as brother brand
[1:01:12] says but prophecy is being
[1:01:16] fulfilled chch how do you know prophecy
[1:01:19] is not being fulfilled right
[1:01:21] now we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:01:24] all be changed in a moment in a
[1:01:26] twinkling of an eye I wish I could put
[1:01:28] you right on the edge of it I don't want
[1:01:30] us to lose our Edge I don't want us to
[1:01:32] think that it's just going to be like
[1:01:33] this forever because one of these days
[1:01:35] you're you're just going to walk off of
[1:01:37] this Dimension into that other dimension
[1:01:39] one of these days it's just going to
[1:01:44] happen and if you're looking for well
[1:01:46] it'll be a great Revival in the church
[1:01:49] well there there's a great Revival right
[1:01:52] now you're living in the time of the the
[1:01:54] greatest Revival that's ever been the
[1:01:56] bride Revival there's been an Awakening
[1:01:58] of the Bride what are we waiting on
[1:02:01] right you just forget me tonight but
[1:02:02] this is my heart you know we always
[1:02:05] looking for something to come and always
[1:02:07] looking for the next big preacher to
[1:02:08] come along or or the next meeting or
[1:02:10] something to come and I believe in
[1:02:12] meetings I we'll have them as long as we
[1:02:14] can I want as many people to come as can
[1:02:16] come but that's not what signals the
[1:02:18] Rapture it may not come at a meeting it
[1:02:20] may just be everyday life we're not
[1:02:22] going to be in one place on the Earth
[1:02:24] we're not even all going to agree on
[1:02:26] every little thing when it comes time
[1:02:28] for the Rapture there's going to be
[1:02:30] people I thought about this the other
[1:02:31] day Brother David you know there's going
[1:02:33] to be people that uh that I don't like
[1:02:35] that are going to be
[1:02:37] there sir you ever think about that
[1:02:42] one Landon's thinking of some people he
[1:02:45] don't like right now I can
[1:02:49] tell you realize there's going to be
[1:02:51] people go in the Rapture that you don't
[1:02:53] get along with
[1:02:57] because the bride's not all made in your
[1:02:59] image it's made in his it's not made in
[1:03:02] my image it's made in his I'm so glad
[1:03:05] for that
[1:03:06] today
[1:03:09] amen so
[1:03:11] now in July of that year
[1:03:14] 1963 or or rather in July of
[1:03:17] 1965 he preaches he preaches now he's
[1:03:20] preached almost to the end of his life
[1:03:22] which he passed away in December I
[1:03:25] believe of of
[1:03:27] 1965 and he preaches a message titled
[1:03:31] what is the attraction on the
[1:03:34] mountain what is the attraction on the
[1:03:37] mountain that's a good
[1:03:40] question and he talks about the
[1:03:42] attraction on Mount olives when Jesus
[1:03:46] fulfills prophecy by riding the donkey
[1:03:49] down off the mountain and he said about
[1:03:52] 1% of the population recogniz ized it
[1:03:55] and and begin to Rejoice because of what
[1:03:57] they saw I think that's us today we
[1:04:00] recognize what's happened and rejoiced
[1:04:02] what we saw but he talks about that he
[1:04:06] talks about
[1:04:07] Noah and how Noah uh there was a
[1:04:10] pounding going on what's this pounding
[1:04:12] on the what's this attraction on the
[1:04:14] mountain he he talks about different
[1:04:16] attractions and he talks about John in
[1:04:19] the river and talks about how the uh the
[1:04:21] the prophecy or or the attraction ch
[1:04:24] change from the prophet to his prophecy
[1:04:26] he talks about all those things and he
[1:04:29] he he finally talks about uh the the the
[1:04:31] Mountaintop experience on Mount Sunset
[1:04:34] and he says I started he's telling the
[1:04:36] story he said I started up the mountain
[1:04:38] running as hard as I could up the other
[1:04:39] side and all of a sudden I thought
[1:04:41] somebody shot me remember this is
[1:04:42] exactly what he prophesied would
[1:04:45] happen and it was several months later
[1:04:47] that it actually happened he said I
[1:04:49] never heard such a blast it shook the
[1:04:51] whole country when it did standing
[1:04:53] before me with seven angels in a cluster
[1:04:55] I met brother Fred and them a little
[1:04:56] after and said what was it I said that
[1:04:58] was it look a lot of being spiritual
[1:05:01] just recognized what recognizing what
[1:05:03] God's
[1:05:04] doing right just being able to recognize
[1:05:07] what God's doing that's a lot of the
[1:05:08] difference in in being spiritually
[1:05:10] minded and carnally minded just
[1:05:12] recognize that was it so now he said
[1:05:16] what what was it that was it what are
[1:05:17] you going to do return home for thus
[1:05:19] sayith the Lord the seven Mysteries has
[1:05:21] been hid in the Bible all these years
[1:05:22] these denominations and everything
[1:05:24] God is going to open up these seven
[1:05:26] Mysteries to us in the Seven Seals he
[1:05:29] said there was that Circle coming up
[1:05:30] from the earth like a Mist forming when
[1:05:32] it did it went Plum up into the mountain
[1:05:35] begin to circle on Westward from the way
[1:05:37] it came science found it after a while
[1:05:39] 30 mil high and 25 miles across just
[1:05:42] exactly in the circle of the
[1:05:44] pyramid he said the other day standing
[1:05:46] there turn the picture to the right
[1:05:47] there is Jesus as he was in the seven
[1:05:49] Church ages the white wig on he said
[1:05:52] showing Supreme deity he's Alpha and
[1:05:53] Omega GA he's the first and the last
[1:05:55] he's the Supreme judge of all eternity
[1:05:58] standing there to confirm the message of
[1:06:00] this hour oh my I don't have to confirm
[1:06:04] it he confirmed it right and and so just
[1:06:07] let me believe it right and he said
[1:06:09] there should be light about the evening
[1:06:11] time what's it all about what was it
[1:06:14] again he says what's happened upon Mount
[1:06:16] Sunset God confirming his word there's a
[1:06:19] time that God speaks it there's a time
[1:06:22] when God confirms it
[1:06:24] this is the hour of of confirmation
[1:06:27] we're not living in the hour when God is
[1:06:30] is uh is speaking by a prophet anymore
[1:06:33] but what are we living in the hour of
[1:06:36] confirmation there was one to an age
[1:06:38] there was only one who had the the sign
[1:06:41] of the son of man there was only one who
[1:06:43] who could bring these things a prophet
[1:06:45] to the age but now we're living in the
[1:06:48] hour when we're being it's being
[1:06:50] fulfilled what he said and I'll say this
[1:06:53] what's greater than the prophecy or the
[1:06:55] Fulfillment well without the prophecy
[1:06:57] there couldn't be a fulfillment but
[1:06:58] without the F fulfillment the prophecy
[1:07:00] is no
[1:07:01] good oh my so without you without you
[1:07:05] nothing can be done now look it's what's
[1:07:08] all this noise about what's happened on
[1:07:09] Mount Mount Sunset God confirming his
[1:07:11] word that's what all this noise is about
[1:07:14] notice it's God fulfilling his promised
[1:07:16] word again Revelation 10 1 to 7 and in
[1:07:19] the days of the sounding of the seventh
[1:07:20] Angel's message the mystery of God
[1:07:22] should be finished
[1:07:24] the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7
[1:07:27] the last message to the last Church age
[1:07:29] fulfills exactly in this age the day
[1:07:32] when the son of man shall be revealed he
[1:07:34] said there shall arise false prophets
[1:07:36] and false Christ and show great signs
[1:07:38] and wonders in as much as it deceive the
[1:07:40] very elected possible the people still
[1:07:42] in doubt and as usual the church is just
[1:07:44] as
[1:07:45] puzzled he's talked about science being
[1:07:47] puzzled he said they're just as puzzled
[1:07:49] that Supernatural Halo hanging there
[1:07:51] yonder in the sky as it was when the
[1:07:53] Magi has come in folling a star saying
[1:07:55] where is he this born King of the Jews
[1:07:57] what was it God fulfilling his word
[1:08:00] there shall rise a star out of Jacob and
[1:08:02] the god of Heaven promised evening time
[1:08:05] would have he evening lights now I've
[1:08:07] read this to
[1:08:09] you
[1:08:11] often but but watch what's he saying God
[1:08:15] did what he promised to do sir yeah is
[1:08:18] this what it is Sir is this the sign of
[1:08:21] the end and it was emphatically answered
[1:08:24] yes sir this was the sign of the end
[1:08:28] three years ago this mystery was a
[1:08:31] prophecy sir what time is it sir but now
[1:08:36] it's history right it's
[1:08:40] past now the seventh seal is the end of
[1:08:42] all
[1:08:44] things think about it
[1:08:46] now what what is it it's ped the promise
[1:08:49] is
[1:08:50] fulfilled what time is it sir and what
[1:08:54] this attraction God fulfilling his word
[1:08:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:00] forever now the book was
[1:09:03] closed and now it is open the seven
[1:09:06] Thunders have been revealed the book
[1:09:08] that was sealed to Daniel and to John is
[1:09:11] now open when would it be at the time of
[1:09:13] the end seal it up to the time of the
[1:09:16] end now now let's look at verse two of
[1:09:19] Revelation chap 10 and I think we'll
[1:09:22] we'll take this very quickly and then
[1:09:23] we'll go
[1:09:24] but verse two it says he had in his hand
[1:09:26] a little book open now he never says
[1:09:31] books but a book and it's actually a
[1:09:34] scroll he has a scroll this is my scroll
[1:09:38] for our purposes tonight this is my
[1:09:41] scroll Melody this is this is my scroll
[1:09:42] tonight so this will be a scroll now a
[1:09:45] scroll is just a rolled up piece of
[1:09:47] paper right but it was a great invention
[1:09:50] because they could make a book what they
[1:09:52] would do is open it up and you could see
[1:09:54] what was on it now this was a scroll
[1:09:57] that was written on the outside and on
[1:09:59] the
[1:10:00] inside right you can't have one without
[1:10:02] the other it takes the written word and
[1:10:05] it takes Revelation takes the revealed
[1:10:07] word now you what you've got is a scroll
[1:10:10] and it's sealed right with Seven Seals
[1:10:13] I've got seven pieces of tape on my
[1:10:17] scroll right so what happens if I take
[1:10:21] one
[1:10:22] off broke a
[1:10:25] seal right now still got six on it now
[1:10:30] that scroll would have been a little
[1:10:31] different because you could pull back a
[1:10:32] part of it and see what that seal was
[1:10:36] but it's still clo a closed
[1:10:39] book right so we're going to take off
[1:10:41] another one see now it's got how many
[1:10:45] that is
[1:10:47] five right so I've taken two off I've
[1:10:51] got five left but the book isn't open
[1:10:55] yeah right I'm trying to just put this
[1:10:57] as simple as we can put it
[1:11:00] tonight took a little paper with
[1:11:02] it I took another one off we're going to
[1:11:06] have paper all over the floor too I took
[1:11:07] another one off oh now there's
[1:11:12] four know if we're going to get number
[1:11:14] five off or
[1:11:16] not
[1:11:19] five you didn't think you were going to
[1:11:21] the theater did
[1:11:22] you
[1:11:24] win me an Oscar right
[1:11:29] here that was hard to come off that's
[1:11:31] six that's tough man
[1:11:35] six but is it open or
[1:11:38] closed right so when we say this the
[1:11:41] seals have been open what are we saying
[1:11:43] the book is open right now now look at
[1:11:46] the mighty angel that comes down he has
[1:11:47] in his hand a little book open what that
[1:11:51] means is the seventh
[1:11:55] seal at this
[1:11:58] time has been opened that was a tough
[1:12:02] one right so he has in his hand oh I
[1:12:06] love this a book you can
[1:12:10] understand right one you can
[1:12:14] read this message is something you can
[1:12:17] understand right God did something
[1:12:20] opened up the book I'll say this the
[1:12:22] message it it has to be scriptural
[1:12:25] because the book in this instance the
[1:12:27] book is many things but the book is the
[1:12:30] Bible brother Bram says the Bible had to
[1:12:32] be open so now it's open what that means
[1:12:35] is you can understand it so now you
[1:12:38] understand how many things do you
[1:12:39] understand that you didn't understand
[1:12:40] before the
[1:12:42] message think about it some of you were
[1:12:43] raised in the message I was raised in
[1:12:45] the message but the message had to come
[1:12:47] to me so there's a lot of things I
[1:12:50] understand today that I didn't just
[1:12:52] automatically
[1:12:53] understand I understand the godhead I
[1:12:57] understand serpent seed I understand uh
[1:13:01] most of it anyway I understand now now
[1:13:03] all of us don't understand at the same
[1:13:05] level but it's open so we can understand
[1:13:09] it's open so I can preach if the book is
[1:13:12] still rolled up I got nothing to preach
[1:13:14] with Alan there's no there's nothing to
[1:13:16] preach because and we might as well just
[1:13:19] go back into a denominational church
[1:13:21] because there's a lot of things they do
[1:13:22] well
[1:13:24] right if we're not going to and you
[1:13:25] wonder why do I preach from quotes why
[1:13:27] do I why do I come
[1:13:29] from I know I read too much but but this
[1:13:32] is my this is the
[1:13:35] message we're not preaching a a
[1:13:37] Pentecostal message we're not preaching
[1:13:39] a a message of another day this is it
[1:13:42] the book is open I have something to
[1:13:46] say what is it what a prophet
[1:13:50] said because that was the revelation oh
[1:13:54] God the words of a prophet in this hour
[1:13:56] is the
[1:13:58] revelation of the opening of the
[1:14:01] word now watch now brother BR said not
[1:14:04] when he begins this ministry but not
[1:14:06] when he starts he said but when he
[1:14:07] begins his ministry right so there there
[1:14:10] was a time he had a progressive
[1:14:11] revelation he had to learn but we know
[1:14:14] that now the book is open we can go
[1:14:16] study it for ourselves we can feed on it
[1:14:19] for ourselves I challenge you every one
[1:14:21] of us can understand it just as good as
[1:14:23] a preacher can now you may not be able
[1:14:26] to rightly divide it but you have the
[1:14:27] benefit of hearing a preacher you you
[1:14:30] have the Ben oh my you have the benefit
[1:14:32] of hearing the five-fold ministry that
[1:14:34] can take the word and God's got them
[1:14:35] today but you also have the benefit of
[1:14:37] being able to check us out with the word
[1:14:40] find out if it's right or not take what
[1:14:42] I've said tonight study the message and
[1:14:45] see the book is either open or Clos it
[1:14:48] can't be
[1:14:49] both
[1:14:51] right so now it's open
[1:14:54] and he cried with a loud voice when a
[1:14:56] lion Roth when he cried seven Thunders
[1:14:58] uttered their voices when the seven
[1:15:00] Thunders had uttered their voes about to
[1:15:01] write Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[1:15:03] to me seal up right so it had to be
[1:15:05] unsealed seal up those things which the
[1:15:07] seven Thunders uttered write them not
[1:15:09] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[1:15:11] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:15:12] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[1:15:14] forever and ever who created heaven and
[1:15:16] the things that there in are and the
[1:15:17] earth and the things that there in are
[1:15:19] and the Sea and the things which are
[1:15:20] therein there should be time no longer
[1:15:24] and you might say brother Ben what are
[1:15:25] we doing
[1:15:27] here if you go look at that in any other
[1:15:30] version other than the King James
[1:15:31] version it literally says there's no
[1:15:33] more
[1:15:34] delay that's what the Greek word means
[1:15:36] time no longer there's no more delay we
[1:15:40] understand time no longer meaning when
[1:15:41] that happens and time's over that's not
[1:15:43] what he's saying there will be no more
[1:15:46] delay in the Fulfillment of the Divine
[1:15:50] Pro purposes respecting the church on
[1:15:51] the Earth oh my I want you to notice one
[1:15:55] more thing before we
[1:15:58] close you know one of the signs of the
[1:16:00] end is false Christ false anointed ones
[1:16:02] how many know
[1:16:03] that right how do we know
[1:16:06] that by the opening of the seals see but
[1:16:10] he didn't preach that in the opening of
[1:16:11] the seals now watch Matthew 24:24 said
[1:16:15] for there shall arise false Christ and
[1:16:18] false prophets and shall show great
[1:16:19] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:16:22] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:16:24] very elect why would the elect not be
[1:16:26] deceived you ever thought about that why
[1:16:28] why would the elect not be deceived
[1:16:30] because we have an open
[1:16:32] book if the book had not been open we
[1:16:35] could still be
[1:16:36] deceived but the book was open If the
[1:16:39] message is not complete then we have a
[1:16:42] problem because we're still subject to
[1:16:44] every wind of doctrine that comes along
[1:16:47] but if the message is complete and if a
[1:16:49] prophet did his job and if we're resting
[1:16:52] on the fact that he preached what Paul
[1:16:54] preached then I believe today that we
[1:16:56] know where we're at
[1:16:59] amen oh
[1:17:01] my why would the elect not be deceived
[1:17:04] now look with the r that Jesus tells you
[1:17:06] here now in Matthew 24 it would be a
[1:17:07] sign at the end time he said now if this
[1:17:11] sign is only to be known at the end time
[1:17:14] then it'll have to be after the opening
[1:17:16] of those
[1:17:16] seals see oh my it has to be after the
[1:17:20] book is open after the opening of the
[1:17:23] see it's a sign of the end that would be
[1:17:25] when those when these thing happens
[1:17:27] these things happens it'll be at the end
[1:17:30] time it'll be a sign now so the elected
[1:17:34] will not be confused in these
[1:17:38] things oh I I want so badly we would not
[1:17:41] be confused the elected in this hour do
[1:17:44] not have to be confused you say brother
[1:17:46] Ben there's a lot of confusion around
[1:17:48] the message well not everybody read the
[1:17:52] open book
[1:17:53] book not everybody's
[1:17:56] elect but the
[1:17:58] elect won't be confused in this
[1:18:02] hour I I believe we're living in the
[1:18:04] hour as musicians come and there's no
[1:18:06] more
[1:18:08] delay it's
[1:18:10] over in other words there's no more
[1:18:12] prophets to come there's no more there's
[1:18:16] no more Revelation in the sense of
[1:18:18] Revelation to be brought there's
[1:18:20] Revelation for us to
[1:18:21] receive everything we need is is here
[1:18:24] even for a Rapture what what am I
[1:18:27] supposed to do this I keep coming back
[1:18:29] to this but it's so simple at the end of
[1:18:30] the seventh seal brother brand says just
[1:18:32] go live a a Godly
[1:18:34] life plant your potatoes why why is he
[1:18:37] telling us that he said but brother Ben
[1:18:40] why why would you even tell us these
[1:18:41] things then he said the brother brandom
[1:18:43] tells us why he said the wise will
[1:18:45] understand and that understanding gives
[1:18:47] us the ability to not be deceived at the
[1:18:51] end time if the seven sealed book is not
[1:18:54] open we are not at the time of the end
[1:18:58] we can't even know the truth of false
[1:19:00] anointed ones at the end time how will
[1:19:03] we not be deceived I'm glad it's open
[1:19:06] I'm glad there's been more than just a a
[1:19:09] teaching but there's been an anointing
[1:19:10] released in our day that the mighty
[1:19:12] Angel has come down into our age and and
[1:19:15] we don't receive the Revelation and I'm
[1:19:17] getting ahead of myself but we don't get
[1:19:19] the Revelation from the hand of William
[1:19:21] Brandon we get it from the hand of the
[1:19:23] mighty Angel himself we receive it from
[1:19:26] the hand of Christ oh my I'm glad it's
[1:19:30] open don't you aren't you I'm glad
[1:19:32] there's no more delay this is the sign
[1:19:34] of the end sir oh my where do we live we
[1:19:38] should live every day just as close as
[1:19:41] we possibly can believe that today let's
[1:19:45] bow our heads
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] together
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:59] I was told one time
[1:20:02] that I had someone tell me said brother
[1:20:04] Ben I know why you smile While You
[1:20:06] Preach said because I met your
[1:20:08] congregation I thought what a compliment
[1:20:11] that is what a compliment they said
[1:20:14] they're such good people and care for
[1:20:15] people and things what are you doing
[1:20:17] you're manifesting the coming of the
[1:20:20] Lord to be an overcomer in this age
[1:20:23] means to be one who eats the word
[1:20:27] becomes the word manifests the word
[1:20:30] that's what I want to be I wanted to be
[1:20:32] more than just a Wednesday night bible
[1:20:34] study but I wanted to show in my life oh
[1:20:38] God let it show let me eat from it I
[1:20:43] want every day to be like today as I'm
[1:20:45] stud I was studying ahead and getting
[1:20:47] into some things that we'll be getting
[1:20:48] into in coming weeks and I just got
[1:20:50] almost beside myself but oh
[1:20:54] God you you've just given us so much to
[1:20:57] Feast
[1:20:59] on it's just so much to take
[1:21:03] in and I know sometimes it makes you
[1:21:05] feel like well I how could I possibly
[1:21:08] know these things and and still mess up
[1:21:11] like I do and
[1:21:15] still still get angry at people and not
[1:21:18] always have the right
[1:21:19] attitude but I say there's more for you
[1:21:22] today
[1:21:24] the power to live above sin is here it's
[1:21:27] been released in this age the ability to
[1:21:30] love God with all of your hearts been
[1:21:33] released yeah you live in a body of
[1:21:35] Flesh and you struggle absolutely till
[1:21:37] the moment you leave here but I I say
[1:21:40] for every one of us there's more for us
[1:21:44] there's a deeper walk there's there's
[1:21:46] somewhere we can grab something we can
[1:21:47] grab a hold of oh God let me love it

[1:21:55] message let me love it with all my heart
[1:21:57] with all my soul with all my with all my
[1:21:59] mind with all my strength brother BR
[1:22:00] said it's the flame of the hour let it
[1:22:02] be the flame of our
[1:22:04] hearts I pray that it would be so on a
[1:22:06] Wednesday night tonight that we could
[1:22:09] recognize more than just a prophet more
[1:22:11] than just a preacher more than a pastor
[1:22:14] more than a church we could recognize
[1:22:16] the message of the hour being a reality
[1:22:18] in our
[1:22:19] lives could we just do that tonight and
[1:22:22] just say Lord I I I want a deeper walk
[1:22:24] with you that's what I want I want My
[1:22:26] Worship to be more sincere what did he
[1:22:29] tell brother Brandon when he when he
[1:22:30] told him he showed him these things he
[1:22:32] he' come two-third of the way and he
[1:22:34] said there's over there is the land
[1:22:35] where all the promises lay he said and
[1:22:37] to to enter there to to to bind that
[1:22:41] demon of of death to bind that that
[1:22:43] snake that Mamba of death he said you
[1:22:45] got to be more sincere than what you are
[1:22:47] now I say oh God let me be more sincere
[1:22:50] than what I was when I came in let me
[1:22:53] walk forward let me press forward where
[1:22:56] I've been dilatory about things and let
[1:22:58] go of some things that I should have
[1:22:59] been grabbing a hold of let me grab a
[1:23:01] hold of them with all of my heart let
[1:23:03] may this message stir me again let it
[1:23:06] move me in a way that it hasn't maybe
[1:23:09] for
[1:23:10] years lost sight of of the depth of it
[1:23:13] I've lost the sight of where I was this
[1:23:15] is the time of the end Let Me Be Moved
[1:23:18] Lord oh God that's my prayer tonight
[1:23:21] Heavenly Father
[1:23:23] Lord I I ask you Lord to forgive me Lord
[1:23:27] and help me oh God we realize these
[1:23:29] things we at the time of the end Lord it
[1:23:31] alarms us when we see Israel going
[1:23:33] through what they're going through right
[1:23:34] now we see things going on all over the
[1:23:37] Earth we see men that don't know their
[1:23:38] men women don't know their women we see
[1:23:40] a prophet that prophesied it many years
[1:23:42] ago we see the situation of politics we
[1:23:46] we see the situation of the economy Lord
[1:23:48] we see the hour that we live in oh God
[1:23:50] help us not to be arrogant help us Lord
[1:23:52] not to be a people that just have a head
[1:23:54] knowledge of it but Lord may it become a
[1:23:56] reality in our lives oh God may your
[1:23:59] Holy Spirit just begin to move in our
[1:24:01] lives may you wake up each and everyone
[1:24:04] I realize Lord that just attending this
[1:24:06] church does not mean a person will go in
[1:24:08] the Rapture just coming and saying we're
[1:24:10] Christians or even we believe in a
[1:24:12] prophet will not get us there but Lord
[1:24:15] we want everyone to be there there must
[1:24:17] be a new birth in our life there must be
[1:24:19] a birth of the word there must be a
[1:24:21] change oh God let us possess that change
[1:24:24] let us possess that land today oh God
[1:24:26] starting with me Lord oh God forgive us
[1:24:30] where we failed you help us to rise in
[1:24:32] Faith Lord and in confidence of this
[1:24:34] message we can believe Lord that you're
[1:24:37] the same yesterday today and forever let
[1:24:39] us preach it oh God I know it's not
[1:24:41] popular today to preach these things but
[1:24:43] Lord I believe this is this is the bride
[1:24:46] food Lord may I may I preach it with all
[1:24:49] of my heart Lord may we receive it may
[1:24:51] we feed on it with all of our heart
[1:24:54] until that day that you come so thankful
[1:24:56] for that Lord we thank you for helping
[1:24:58] us in every moment of our life thank you

[1:25:03] moments like on a Wednesday night when
[1:25:05] we think well nothing's going to happen
[1:25:07] Lord in those moment sometimes the
[1:25:09] greatest experiences of our life takes
[1:25:12] place Lord maybe this is the moment the
[1:25:15] last time we'll ever sit in church
[1:25:17] before the coming of the Lord maybe
[1:25:20] maybe the prophet picked many birds off
[1:25:22] of his off of his clothes in between the
[1:25:26] time that you made the prophecy and in
[1:25:28] between that time and the time that it
[1:25:30] happened but one day was the last one
