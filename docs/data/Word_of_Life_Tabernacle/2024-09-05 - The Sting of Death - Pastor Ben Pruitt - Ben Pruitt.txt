amen let's turn to 1 Corinthians 15:51 it's a good song because we're going to talk about death tonight we're going to talk about the sting of death and how it was done away with by Christ and it's just been on my heart I know some of you'all have been through some things and lately and it just come on my heart for this time and this season we're going through I want to continue to pray for the Biven family sister Pat Grimes and also remember the sartans they're home tonight not able to be here but sister so he's doing better so be praying for them 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 51 says behold I show you a mystery and we say it's not a mystery anymore he showed it to us we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh oh death where is thy steem oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you uh let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be here tonight and I know there's many needs represented here in this place I pray that you'd meet those needs tonight I pray that you just move in our midst and speak through your word speak to our hearts Lord may we be completely caught up in your word Heavenly Father until the things of Earth would have less value to us Lord until Heavenly things would grow clearer all the time pray you grant it now we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated death is is not a comfortable subject for most folks I I know that for me it's not always a comfortable subject and it's one thing when you're dealing as a pastor with other people that that deal with that but then when you have to deal with yourself or with your family it's always different when it's close to home the Bible says we should weep with those who weep and I believe that's part of what we do as a church it's part of the function of a church I don't know how people who don't have a family a church family uh to help them in that way I don't know how they uh they handle it sometimes but I'm so glad that we do have one another and I think we should every do everything we can to help one another in that way to weep with those who weep to mourn with those who mourn yet we know that every one of us has to go some way or another uh either by death or by Rapture someone uh said it's not that I'm afraid to die I just don't want to be there when it happens and uh that's true most most of us that uh and in the world in general death is just something you don't talk about it's not something you uh you you mention it's not something you bring up yet we as Christians are not afraid of death we view death much differently than others do uh there was a man in in the early Christian world uh actually a Greek by the name of aides and he was trying to explain Christianity to a friend of his and and he said this about the Christians he said if any righteous man among the Christians passes from this world he said they rejoice and offer thanks to God and they accompany his body with songs and Thanksgiving as if he were setting out from one place to another nearby so it was very strange to the Pagan mind because they didn't comprehend that the Christians viewed death as a temporary state of the body a temporary state of the body and not the Eternal state of the soul in fact that's why he would always say uh that that the the body was sleeping now the Bible never teaches Soul sleeping it teaches that the body sleeps in the dust of the earth and the body will be raised up again and so Christians or the early Christians actually changed the language of burial that when they uh when they begin to place their dead in the catacombs in Rome they developed their own language in speaking about death and they referred to those catacombs as comeria which we would know as the word Cemetery today but if you saw the word comeria in in that time referring to a place where they would put the Dead it would actually mean a dormatory a dormatory and the the Greeks thought of the dormatory and the Romans thought of the dormatory is a temporary place that you stayed for one night a place where you slept and rose again in the morning and that's exactly what the Christians meant when they called it a comery a cemetery that it's a temporary place that the body is in amen for a short amount of we believe that today that the body is there for a temporary time and that body will be raised up again how God does that exactly we don't know we know he goes down a corruptible body but it's raised an Incorruptible body and we know then that we'll have a glorified body we know there's a theophany body waiting for us and we'll get to that but but yet we realize it's a temporary thing and so for a Christian uh they meant that you went to sleep so you might wake again and so a death you you just place they didn't put their dead they didn't burn their dead they put their dead in a in a dormatory because they believe they'd see them again uh another example is the word deposit or deposit us which was used if you see deposit us on a grave on a Christian grave meant that they had made a deposit in the earth and they believed that it was coming back again they made a deposit like a grain of wheat to be restored because Jesus said except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die how can it ever rise again and produce much fruit the truth is they just believe what God Said in his word right and that would do us a whole lot of good church if we could just believe what God says in the word if we could just say I'm hanging my soul that I don't always feel like it I I I you know when we mourn with those who mourn and we we feel the pain of that to a lesser extent than they do but but we feel a little bit of that and we mourn with them and if you've lost the love when it's a very it's a hard time and we're not taking away from that tonight but know that we believe that What God Says is right and and What God Says is eternal and whatever God said in the word about where we would be that's where we're going to be and we got to believe that we got to do more than just pay it lift service but if we believe it it changes even our language and the way we speak about death so they believe what God Said and and what God's thoughts are are written down for us it's good you know if you ever thought like that said well I wonder what God was thinking well we know what God was thinking we know God thoughts because he wrote them down right he wrote them down in the Bible and we know even what was in the back part of his mind because a prophet com in our day to tell us that so we know the thoughts of God we know what God thought about death we know that death is the penalty of sin in Genesis 21:17 he said the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die he also tells us the wages of sin is death we know that death was was postponed by an animal sacrifice it wasn't done away with but it was postponed that when Adam and his wife were leaving the garden God made coats of skins and and clothed them and so something had to die it was something that died in their place when he saw them leaving the garden there with those bloody skins slapping up against her leg brother B said the heart of God couldn't stand it and and so he he he made a promise that the woman's seed would crush the head of the serpent would oh my oh I believe that's still true I believe it took place on Calvary and so we know that that that was the sting of death was the law actually which made us guilty it told us and so the law to to Adam was don't eat that tree or that day you die he broke that law and that was the sting of death was the fact that that the law brought a guilt on the person that they would be then not just dead but they would be separated from God and so there was a guilt that was there and so in the our text Paul says the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law again in Romans 3:19 he said we know that what things soever the law saith it sayith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God in other words there can't be nobody standing there and say well I was wasn't guilty but they were every one of us was guilty I know this is Elementary tonight but we're trying to get somewhere and we want our thoughts to match God's thoughts when it comes to these things so you know here was something that would make us guilty and that was the sting of death and we know that when Jesus died on the cross he removed the sting of death he REM oh Church the Bible says what the law could not do this is my favorite verse I had it made and it hung on the wall in my office for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh he said that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit brother brandom said when the father said this is my beloved Son here you hear there's the Perfection everybody's looking for a perfect Church everybody's looking for a perfect person everybody's looking for a perfect Pastor a perfect song leader he said there's the Perfection when the father looked at his son and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and that was Perfection brother Allen that's that was as perfect as you could get right it was the perfect man he said there's the Perfection he said that's what the law could not do the law could not produce Perfection Perfection was only through Christ he said when he come and was made flesh and anchored the Stinger of death and pulled it out where you and I can walk in the face of it death can't bother us hallelujah it hasn't got any Stinger he said it can buzz and hum and threaten make a bluff but that's all it can do death has no more Stinger for every believer that's in Christ Jesus someone say every believer that's in Christ Jesus is perfected forever yes we could go into that time don't have time but you perfected in that body because you were in him that's what brother bam was telling us in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said you died with him you Rose with him and because you were in him you were perfected forever in him it doesn't mean that this body won't do things that are wrong and and many times this body is messed up and I'll say this as long as you're in this body you'll live with many of the choices you made yeah right and you can't get mad at people for for recognizing you made bad choices in your life but at the same time you got to realize that as far as God sees it if you're in Christ you did you never did it in the first place but that body still Bears the scars of it Bears the marks of it but yet in your soul you're completely completely redeemed as perfect as he's perfect that's the only way you can be saved right you you can't be half perfect and make it into heaven you can't be you can't be uh 3/4s perfect and make it into heaven you can only be saved in the body of Jesus Christ and by his death amen so that death that that bee brother said was the bee of death he said it was it was buzzing there at Calvary and when it sunk its stinger into Christ it it tried to pull it out when it did it left it in the body of Christ and so the sting of death or the guilt that comes from the law is gone in Christ death has no more Stinger for every believer that's in Christ Jesus is perfected forever someone say forever forever so we know then that his death took the sting out of out of death his death took the Sting from death and his resurrection defeated death right so death had a pretty bad week had a pretty bad weekend all right right because one day it Stinger was taken out and the next day death was completely defeated and we know that because John sees him as a conqueror on the aisle of patmas you remember when he looks around and he hears the voice and he turns to see who's talking to him and he sees one like the Son of God he's standing there with brass feet like brass eyes like fire Seven Stars in his hand and as he's standing there John fell down on his feet is dead he said when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying to me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead you talk about a victory he said I was in the grave and I come out again never to die again and we could say well didn't Lazarus defeat death well only through Christ he defeated death but he had to go back death still had a hold on his body listen if you get healed today death will still have a hold on your body at some point you'll get sick again you might get delivered today of some disease and catch another one before you leave the door and we believe in healing we believe in Divine Healing but oh how much better is when Christ defeated death itself because he never had to die again and you and I if our soul has been sealed oh church that ought to make us happy tonight if your soul has been sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to die again you can't die any more than God can die this body might sleep it might die but you can't die right right because death has been defeated and his resurrection is proof of that I am he that liveth and was dead behold I'm alive forever more and I have the keys of hell and of death brother BR said when Christ died for sin he knocked sickness in the head I like that while he was busy defeating death Hallelujah he knocked sickness in the head yes sir and everything that went with it even death itself what do you do with an old varment on the farm that you don't want no more you knock it in the head take that old snake and bruise his head crush his head amen oh I've done it many times where you put your heel on the snake's head and you crush its head you don't have to worry about it that old body might might jerk and move around for a while but he got no more ability to harm you amen Christ died for sin he not sickness in the head and everything that went with it even death itself we're not dead but we're alive he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die he conquer death hell the grave Paul said when he come to the Grave oh death where's thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he lives do you believe that today he lives and if he lives then everything is going to be okay it's going to be all right we may suffer for a while but he said after you suffered for a while he's going to glorify you yes sir he's going to make everything right see everything's going to be set right that's the hope of the Christian the hope of the Christian is not that everything gets right in this life come on Paul says if in this life only we we have hope we are of all men most miserable right because we don't we don't put any stock in this life and and how it goes we're looking to another life and and when our bodies are changed we know so death has been Sting's been taken out of it it's been defeated and when our bodies are changed death will be literally swallowed up word means drowned right in Victory right death will there'll be so much Victory you won't even be able to see death anymore Hallelujah death will be swallowed up drowned in Victory when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortal ity and shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory brother BR says don't you fear I'll fear no evil for thou art with me death is all swallowed up in Victory death can't do nothing one writer said the only thing that God had did to death he put it to a buggy and harnessed it and set it in the buggy shafts and the only thing death can do is pull a believer in the presence of his maker see that's how God thinks about it right and we think about it as Mortals when we lost friend we lost a loved one that's true but let's try to think about it the way God thinks about it and I think it would change even our our expectation and our language and everything else how should we view death as Christians we should know that there's hope in death and by hope I mean expectation there expectation because no matter how badly they hurt no matter how long it took no matter no matter how much they struggled which I think is maybe the worst part of of death is watching someone die I I do believe that no matter how much they struggled in this life look at Lazarus Lazarus never had nothing laid in the doorway and and ate the crumbs that fell from from the table of that they'd sweep off the roof they ate their meals Up on the Roof like we did in Egypt they ate their meals there and they swept it off and Lazarus lays in the doorway and and eats that and we would think that's not a very Victorious man but he went to the bosom of Abraham amen he defeated death and even though he'd never he'd never had anything in life it seemed like he was cursed and it seemed like he couldn't make any money in his body wouldn't allow him to uh to get anywhere in life but yet he had a house in heaven and and he had a body in heaven he had something waiting for him in Paradise at that time and the rich man had everything on this Earth but he turned down the offer of the leadership of Jesus Christ now say to you young people tonight you need to take up take him up on his offer take him up on it today don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till next week or next year or the next Youth Camp take him up on it today say Lord Jesus Lead Me Guide Me walk with me through life because you'll need a hand to hold you brother brandham taught us there was no one to hold the rich man when he went to hell he said but but the Lazarus was cradled in in the arms of angels when he went to heaven second Corinthians or or brother Psalms 26:15 says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints how could that be well we'll find out 2 Corinthians 5:1 we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens Paul says we know right we know we don't suppose we don't we don't uh we don't guess at it we know that it's true how could Paul know that he visited the heavens remember he visited the third we know that there's a body there we had somebody in this age a prophet who visited the sixth Dimension he he could come back and say I know there's a place beyond compare I know there's a place that is so beautiful I can't even describe it to you with words we know there's a if this Earthly house this this body is dissolved there's a building of God a body in the heavens for us that's what we call our theophany body 1 Thessalonians 4:13 he said but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep those who are in the dormatory the cemetery I would not oh my would not have you to be ignorant you know if you if you told somebody you know our language means something you tell somebody there in the cemetery it has a finality to it it doesn't it but that's not what the word even means it's not a permanent place it's a dormatory oh church that meant so much to me when I saw it I just thought God let me think about it like that it's just a dormatory we may place our loved ones there but they're coming out again and so he said there there's some that are asleep he said but that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout let me just stop there for a minute Rand taught us that shout was the message that's already happened how close are we to the end if that portion of it has already taken place where are we at church oh it's a dormatory we put our love R away but it's a dormatory it won't last for long amen he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first so before we receive our change the dead in Christ toise amen just like maybe your loved ones when they left many times our loved ones will see people they haven't seen in a long time what is that they're they're entering another dimension they're going into another dimension and I believe one day it'll happen in Reverse we won't be dying but suddenly we'll just begin to see right and when we begin to see him come in it'll be about that time where the r said all of a sudden a sweep will go over us amen what's this Sudden Change Hallelujah it'll be caught up he said in just a moment twinkling of an eye listen to what he says he said we which are alive and remain I want to be one That Remains Not Just alive but remains I want to remain in church I want to remain as a father as a husband as a pastor I want to remain in the truth I want to do what's right we which are alive and remain amen I trust that's all of us tonight shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words why am I preaching this tonight because we're taught to do this you say well it's simple it doesn't matter it does matter Comfort one another with the fact that it's just a dormatory comfort one another with the fact that we're going to see each other again Comfort one another with the fact that this is just a temporary condition that the sickness in your body is temporary everything you're going through is temporary yes sir Hallelujah you might be getting old you might be getting gray but remember that's a temporary condition your youth is coming back one of these days hallelujah amen makes me feel better and better the older I get Comfort one another with these words what about you begin to think about that and what comfort that does bring us to those who are Christians but what about those who are not serving the lord when they die I'm so glad we serve a merciful god you realize God removed lot from Sodom just because he was happened to be related to Abraham that's pretty much all he had going for him he had some measure of righteousness about him because it vexed his righteous soul but he didn't do anything about it he stayed right there in Sodom and even when he was called out the Bible says he lingered he lingered and so how many people today are lingering in Sodom he lingered and the men The Messengers that were sent to him laid upon his hand upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters listen what it says the Lord being merciful unto him I'm so glad for his Mercy tonight that even l a type of maybe the foolish virgin or the nominal church that God said If Abraham cares about him I'm going to get him out of Sodom glory to God so even those that we care about God said I'm going to make a way for them and so he said I'm going to be merciful to him because Abraham loves him because he's a kin to Abraham I'm going to be merciful oh Church you don't know what it means to be one of Abraham's seed he said all those that bless you I will bless all those that curse you I will curse he was one of Abraham's kin belonged to Abraham and so the Lord was merciful to him I've often wondered how did David obtain forgiveness after all he had done think about this what was the difference in David and Saul I I've never really encapsulated it this way but think about it like this what was the difference God did something different with David listen what he did second Samuel 7:14 he's telling Samuel what he's going to do with David he said he Saidi be his father and he shall be my son that's a different relationship than what he had with Saul he said if he commit iniquity I will chase him with the rod of men with the stripes of the children of men other words I'm going to correct him because God knew what he was going to do but my Mercy you think God's not merciful my Mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away from the what's the difference that's the difference yeah it's the mercy of God the mercy of God you see what not fair God has Mercy on whom he has Mercy whom he will he hardens and yet even Saul made it to Heaven it's what brother brandham taught us what the Bible teaches because when Samuel was called up remember when Saul calls up Samuel by the witch of indor what happens Samuel comes up he said tomorrow you'll be with me right you'll be in the same place that I'm at he was saved in the end you say that's too much grace brother Ben I can't handle that kind of Grace I can't help it our God is a merciful god and that may be too too merciful for you but I'll say this I needed that kind of Mercy I needed that I want that kind of Mercy for my family I want that kind of Mercy for the church no wonder David would instruct his singers to sing brother Joel when they begin to sing he instructed all of he said sing this the the mercy of the Lord endures forever David understood Mercy because he'd received Mercy he said his Mercy endures forever he instructed all of them to play his Mercy endures forever because he knew God was a merciful god he said this he said he's the Tower of salvation for his King and showeth his Mercy to his anointed to David and to his seed forever more when David sinned by numbering the people he fell on the mercies of God remember remember the uh the Ang or the Prophet come to him he said he said there's one of three things is going going to happen he said either the enemy is going to come in he said or some or uh there's going to be another situation take place he said or else he said a plague will come in he said well let it be the plague he said because I know God is merciful God is merciful and the Bible says that he killed so many thousands of them but God stayed the hand of the Angel why because he's a merciful god the Bible says Psalms 103 and8 the Lord is merciful and gracious soow to anger sir oh how we could learn from that sir and plenteous in Mercy right he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever see his his grace may be temporary to some people I believe his grace with his his elect is eternal but his grace may be temporary for some people but so is his anger he won't keep his anger forever and I don't know what people who believe in an eternal hell do with that verse that's right Heath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them sir that fear him if you go down to verse 15 he said as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passes over it and it's gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness notice unto children's children to such as keep his Covenant to those that remember Commandments to do them the brandom taught us that Noah saved his house the Bible says that Hebrews 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house he said by the which he condemned the world and become heir of the righteousness which is by faith they asked brother brandham that question they said brother brandham you said on one of the tapes that Noah saved his household does this mean a mother how many mothers we have here tonight a mother can have the same faith for for her household yes sir I just I just love this question cuz this mother caught something right she said does this mean a mother can have the same faith for her household does it mean every one of the family will be saved if we believe it she GNA put brother brandom to the test brother random answers very carefully if you go back and listen to it he answers it very carefully he said he said you said one on your on one of your tapes that Noah saved his household he said why because they believed they do have to believe he said that's it because they believed his message but now he answers there's two questions he said now he answerers the second question does this mean that a mother can have the same faith for her household yes sister he said I can see a little mother's heart crying for her people does this mean every one of the family will be saved if we believe it yes if they will accept it that's right but now look it's faith right it's Faith he said Remember the Philippian Jailer believe for both of you if you've got enough faith for your own salvation can't you have that same Faith that'll work upon your people that that'll work on your people he said what is Faith it's an unseen Force now look he said what is it it's a spirit now I think sometimes we think about faith as something you think brother brand tells us faith is a spirit faith is a spirit he said if if you uh he said it it's a spirit the Holy Spirit brings Faith it's an unseen Force brother brandom talks about how God worked in his own Ministry and he begins to talk about something strange he talks about how he said What mo what motivates the muscle in your arm and the muscles in my arm aren't very motivated actually because but that's because of the spirit of laziness right I'm just trying to make you laugh but but the muscles in your arm he said what motivates the muscle of your arm to move it's your spirit right that does that faith is a spirit so it what motivates the muscle of your arm is the faith so if you want something to move if you want something to happen you got to have faith for it all right and then Faith actually does something faith is not uh faith is not something that just sits there Faith does something Faith causes things to move and that's what he said Samson what was motivating there was a spirit in Samson that he could pick up the gate and carry it out there was a spirit in Samson a faith that he could take the Jawbone of a mule and kill a thousand Philistines brother BR said he looked around and said where's some more of you at Faith held that Jawbone together because it ought to disintegrated the first time he hit one of those bronze helmets but he held it together what was that Faith the spirit that was in s or in in Samson not by might or by power but by his Spirit sayith the Lord Brother R said therefore it is the Spirit of the Lord and when you've got the spirit of the Lord in you to believe for your own salvation place that upon your family Hallelujah say I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ I claim it now listen to me Church you don't quit having faith for your children after they're gone it don't mean you can change anything after they're gone but you don't quit having faith for them because you believe that something happened yeah that they would be there right no matter what it looked like Faith don't look at circumstances Faith looks at the word of God God you promised me my children and I believe somehow they made it yeah are you with me now and that doesn't give us any you say well uh well you know I just quit taking my kids to church because it doesn't really matter I'll just have faith for them you'd have a lot more confidence in what your Bel you'd have a lot stronger faith if you brought them to church on Wednesday night because Faith requires confidence what does James he said if you he said if you don't live it basically I'm paraphrasing but if you don't live it and you don't go to church nowhere and you don't have a pastor and you don't pay your tie you don't I'm paraphrasing but if you don't do that stuff the just the basic stuff that you're supposed to do it's hard to have any faith because your heart condemns you right but you want to have faith for your kids live the life live like God called us to live and when you live like God called you to live it'll produce a confidence in your God I know you changed me you can change them Lord I know I brought them to the house of God and I believe you're going to keep them in the house of God said well I made mistakes in that well start doing different today he said don't make a difference it does it does it might be your example today that brings grandkids who've never been to church with you but they see you're still in church might bring them back to church I've seen it happen they they know you're still there who they going to come back to if you quit are you with me now how they going to come back sister Stephanie if we quit if we give up how our children how our grandchildren what are they going to come to but R says the spirit of the Lord place that on your family say I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ I claim it God I don't know how you're going to make her do it and how you're going to make him do it but I believe it I believe it Lord help my unbelief claim it and Watch What Happens it'll do it again he said what must I do for my family use the same Faith you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart can you believe with all your heart tonight right if our heart condemns us he said God is greater than our heart even if you made mistakes God you just trust in the atonement of God it's a whole lot easier to have faith if you do what God says but then you have confidence in God now look he said commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart that they're going to be that you're going to be saved don't let it just come down on your natural thinking here Let It Drop way down on the inside all right that subconscious it never occurred to Samson that he couldn't win that fight are you hearing me Church it never occurred to him that he couldn't pick up those Gates it wasn't like he was trying to do something big he wasn't sitting there and say oh I got to build my faith up better go to church better read my Bible no it was subconscious faith when it need it done he stepped out and did it that's the kind of Faith you got to have for your children it's easy to have faith when they're all in church it's harder to have faith when they get out on their own and they're doing things that you'd have never dreamed they'd have done but that's when Faith takes hold that's when Faith grabs hold and brother R said Faith's got hair on his chest it's got big brwy muscles and Faith begins to speak and say I claim my family all right it's When Faith really has to has to have its muscles activated he said said he said don't let just come on your natural thing let it drop down that subconscious he said then they're yours God's give them to you when you've got it down here shouldn't even occur to us you know we get the the feeling like well you know maybe someday they'll probably go out I've told you before I can't even imagine that why because I believe they're going to make it I believe this is the generation that's going to make and these young people that sett from the front usually there's a lot more of them but I believe they're going to make it in spite of some of us come on church I told Brother Joel this week I said what happens in this church and I'm just preaching to you but what happens in this church I said the success if you could call it that in a church I said in our church is not going to be what so and so down the road does it's not going to be what another preacher does or what a pastor does or what an evangelist does or what some other church does it's going to be this generation of young people right are they going to make it I believe they're going to make it I believe they're going to make it why because somebody's got faith to believe it I want to be the first one to set that example I'm claiming these young people in the name of the Lord we got to claim our children come on you say well you know we just got to let them go out and do their thing and well let's just keep them in how about that let's let them preach without the scars all right let's let them sing without the without the bondage come on that thing that you fight through all the time because of the scars in your life let's raise a group of young people don't have to have that we might as well I believe it's possible I stand on the shoulders of the previous generation my mother and father who prayed and and my children stand on my shoulders and we want something better for them because we're getting closer and closer to the end time I don't believe one of them have to be lost God forbid that one would stray I believe they'll be back brother BR said you believe for your safety oh if you ever need a safet is today I just heard about another school shooting today that's not to make us scared but I I just hate having them out there in public school and it's not because of the so much the pull of the world although that's there but it was just a safety issue it just it got to me you know I'm thinking how there's nothing I can do about it but there's nothing you can do about it once they get old enough to get a job either could be workplace violence or anything else so I don't blame the schools it's just the culture that we live in it's just where we are but we got to believe for safety it's not just going on in the natural it's going on in the spiritual there's death everywhere there's there's spiritual death we see people falling away we see churches dying we see we see people with no spirit of God about them and no no ability to pray anymore no ability to call out to God and I say I want safety in this day of spiritual death I want to believe for my safety he said you believe for your safety and then apply the token for the whole family how can I do that claim it he said if it worked on you then you and the word becomes one he said amen see it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones like Rahab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and got them all in you realize she had no control over what any of them did they were grown people they weren't her children they weren't somebody she cared for they were grown people but they come in why she applied the token in her home yeah because she applied the token in her home her whole household was saved I believe we could do the same thing today I don't think it's so much brother ROM says sometimes we try to beat the devil out of a child I don't think it's so much in beating them although I do believe if you spare the rod you spil of the child so I believe in biblical discipline but it's not so much in beating them and and trying to make them do what we want them to do no it's apply that token ourselves let's make sure we're right ourselves let's make sure we're standing in the right place as a parent claim that child he said you apply it say Lord I'm going after my son going after my daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her oh I believe the spirit of the Lord is here tonight I apply my token the Holy Spirit apply my token you got to you got to have a confidence that it's there first and then apply it apply my token the Holy Spirit oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going to her now with your anointing upon me he'll do it you may not see it move all of a sudden but it'll move said but brother Ben I've had some that have passed away some relatives and friends and loved ones without coming to the lord well how do you know you see they don't have to come to an altar to come to the Lord I'm I'm telling you the truth tonight as far as I know it I've been I've been told that I preached too much grace I don't believe I do I don't believe I preach enough we've held on to our own we we've looked at our own works for too long that's why we're so up and down because our works will fail us his grace will never fail how do you know they didn't come to God why would you leave any different it doesn't take an hour to come to God it doesn't take a day just a breath just a breath c c can we can we just St in this for just a minute God's merciful see God interprets the heart right he interprets the heart and there's people who look ever so good but God interprets the heart and brother Brom talked about that with the little boy praying the alphabet he had never been taught how to pray you say well you worry about that say well I I didn't when I was younger I wasn't serving the lord and my children I didn't do everything right with my children and I look at them today well if that little little heart that heart of that child or that grown child can can actually want or desire God that's a blessing if there's something in their heart that wants God that desires God and here's a little boy in an alley praying and he don't know what to pray so what does he do he prays the alphabet he just says a b c d he goes all the way down the alphabet and and the pastor asked him said what are you doing he said I'm praying he said I don't know how to pray he said but I know I need to pray he said so I'm just praying I'm asking God to make sense of the words I'm asking God to put the letters together and make words with it I believe God accepted that a prophet taught that he did the only thing the thief on the cross ever did will say you don't deserve this and Lord remember me and nobody Hur him but Jesus I wonder sometimes if some of the people he robbed weren't in heaven he said he was a thief think about that I don't know if we can remember and when he gets into he didn't spend long in Paradise because it just you know got emptied all that time but but if you think about it and and here he comes he's like think I know you he like not me but it's a great story and someone has said this recently it's not original from me but he said here he's going around people are asking said how did you get in he said don't know when were you Justified don't know when were you Sanctified don't know when were you filled with the Holy Ghost don't know so what do you know said I just know the man on the middle cross said I could come right and he's the boss that's God's mercy see there's going to be people that that are going to be saved you all know this but I I want to reinforce this to us there's going to be people that are saved that don't know what they did to be saved there's going to be people who are given life who don't know what they did to be given life Matthew 25:31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as the shepherd divided the sheep from the goats he said as the sheep from the goats he shall set the sheep on his right hand or on his right hand with the goats on the left and then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world he said for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me and and all of us you know that that makes us feel good when we do good things and we ought to do good things but this isn't even us right because you don't get in that way you don't get in that way not if you you know better you know you have to have the grace of God and you know the message of the hour you've been taught that and so you don't get in just by being nice right you go you go in because your sins have been forgiven right but these go come in and they protest they said then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hunger fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink they don't even remember doing it when saw we the a stranger and took thee in her naked and clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me did you know while Paul was in a prison in Rome somebody and I don't know who it was somebody in the Roman bureaucracy decided that Paul could be under house arrest and still write letters and I'm glad that they did because we wouldn't have these wonderful Epistles that we have today the prison Epistles unless somebody allowed that it may have been some government bureaucrat that drank wine all of his life and and and did everything wrong all of his life don't think about that but there may be a soldier there or a man there who just let Paul write some letters all right yeah he did it to the least of these my brethren he said you did it unto me see brother brand said these aren't the bride the bride sits with him in judgment you find that in 1 Corinthians 62 the Saints will judge the world 63 that we will judge angels we sit with him Daniel 7:9 it says the Ancient of Days did sit and describes him 710 it says a fiery stream issued and came forth before him thousand thousands ministered unto him him that's us and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open now you're sitting here thinking well and I feel that sometimes you know we had a word prophit I know sometimes you sit there and think well you know brother Ben you're just taking brother Brown's word for that well that'd be good for me to do that but but you don't have to in this case think about it he was a word Prophet because he brought his Doctrine from the word from the Bible where in the Bible does it say you kids can write this down if you want to if you're if you're taking notes where in the Bible actually my daughter told me the other day she only takes notes when it's boring I don't know about that but where where in the Bible does it say that there's no judgment snap quiz no judgment for the for the believer there's a there's a scripture that says that it's John 5:24 you know that John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word that's understands in the original he that understands my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation underline that word condemnation or write it down but is passed from Death to life that word congregation or condemnation of the original is Crisis judgment legal case it refers to the process process event or the result of legal proceedings intended to evaluate punishment these are being evaluated whether they were good or bad whether they were good to people or not whether they but you will not be evaluated why you've passed from Death to life already brother B said that's past tense a word Prophet taught because of this verse we would not come into judgment go look it up if you want to I know there's people that believe that if you die while speeding you'll go to hell it's nonsense praise God I had a Pentecostal man tell me that one time if you died doing something wrong You' go to hell immediately what kind of God is that number one he's not strong enough to keep you and then and then he going to let you do wrong and then make you live in a flesh body and then the minute you do something wrong take you off the Earth that's not very not very good I've had that same attitude around the message had a lady tell us I've told you this before but she said what would you do if the Rapture happened while you were on that roller coaster well just a little closer be a missing Rider right I mean what do you mean what would we do we go because the case has been dismissed es still had a case they had a case to be adjudicated they had they they had to come before the Judgment those had a case but there there are those who have no case against him that's you and I he said who they I I trust you one of those today they were remembered these were remembered for their kindness to God's people brother upon what grounds to the enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact they've already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren he tells us that their names must have been in the book of life and not removed he said now because of their so they weren't just just anybody but they were in The Book of Life he said because some are never never there but these were he said now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved yes God's a merciful god and I'm saying this because when someone passes away many times and We Don't Preach them into Heaven We Don't Preach them into hell either because we don't know right he said because of their love of the people of God they're recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gel they stood for the children in a time of trouble oh my you realize that's what the thief on the cross did he stood for Jesus in a time of trouble he said you don't deserve this and Jesus said tomorrow you'll be with me see the Bible says he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you receive a prophet's reward receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water he said only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward I'm closing with this if you musicians want to go ahead and come brother BR said what about a brother that's made a mistake now I'm going to say this if he's made a mistake he's a brother he'll quickly repent to quickly repent he won't try to justify it he won't try to moralize it or say it was somebody else's fault to repent the brand said though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong he said well if we will take him to the throne of God H how can we do that because we get access to the throne because we've already passed from Death to life it gives us access to the throne of God to stand there shoulder toosh shoulder with our brother knowing he's a mortal I like this you know and I don't want us to think say well that means I can never disagree with anybody no we need to stay with the word yes and to do that sometimes you'll have to disagree with people it's just the way it is you need to protect protect your family you need to you need to help those that need help and you need to correct those that need correction sometimes that's love said if you see somebody going over the cliff you don't just you don't just sit back and wait on them to go over you you scream at them stop doing what you're doing yes but yet we recognize our brother is Immortal we take him to the throne of God maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him not his attitude towards us but our attitude towards him because our attitude towards him many times will dictate his attitude towards us when we come back from the Throne of God he said we'll realize that we're everyone guilty see we are judged here right that's what we're doing right here tonight we're at the Judgment seat of God so we don't have to be judged we're there realize we're everyone guilty we all need help one from the other and the best way to do is pray amen amen I trust that that'll help in some way I I don't know I don't I don't you don't just pick things to preach you just try to follow the mind of the Lord and I trust it'll be a blessing to you let's bow our [Music] heads heavenly father I'm so thankful that you called us oh God I I'm overwhelmed by the fact that you spoke to us we heard your voice and we ra able to see and understand the things in this hour yet we know there's many who won't but Lord we don't put them out we just believe that you will make a way Lord especially for those who passed on I Lord I just it just makes me want to do more for those who are here God help us today help us to to to let our children know that we love them Lord I I know they need correction sometimes but Lord if they don't know that we love them how could we ever correct them Lord you first had to show us you died for me before you ever issued one word of Correction I thank you for that Lord you loved me with Lord an overwhelming love and then you begin to guide me and Lead Me and correct me Lord and sometimes severely but I knew you loved me and I'm so thankful for that Lord help me to be that way Lord uh help us to love one another help us to show it we we stand at your throne Lord shoulder toosh shoulder with our brothers and sisters we ask you Lord to come and and just speak to every heart I Lord as a pastor many times though I preach Grace I have to deal Lord with the word and many times cut and hurt Lord I know that you're there to give the the the oil lord of the spirit to to go in and sooth the wound and I pray you would do that Lord I pray there would be no Lord I we we want to believe everybody's sincere and we realize there's insincere people out there that only want to do harm to the body of Christ but Lord we want to believe everyone sincere we want to help them with all that we can do everything we can do father Living Lord and then claim that person for you I pray you grant it Lord I pray Lord that youd help us to have the faith to claim our children and if there's something hindering our faith that Lord we we we're embarrassed by it or we're doing something we know better than to do it Lord help us to change that give us the courage Lord to to do what's right so we can have confidence and Faith for our children I pray you grant it Lord we love you and we thank you I pray for those who've lost loved ones and those who are in need Lord I Lord many that are in need of of healing I pray you'd reach down to them right now heal
