we're constantly only being Lord being by Satan just constant barrage of negativity and and sin and darkness oh God but Lord May there be a source of light and of Hope and of strength Lord it'll come from this service from this word or that you've given us in our hour maybe light to us it dispels all the Gloom oh God lord may we rejoice in your presence today we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you second Kings chapter 11 verses 1 through 3. Second Kings 11 1-3 so good to be here on a Sunday morning I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but to be with you people wherever you are that's where we want to be and because we're all children of God do you believe that this morning amen Second Kings 11 verse 1 and when a Thalia the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed Royal but jehoshiba the daughter of King joram sister of a Isaiah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's Sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bed Chamber from a Thalia so that he was not slain and he was with her hit in the house of the Lord six years and a Thalia did Reign Over the land I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I want to continue on our thought a home to come back to a home to come back to during a thalia's reign as Queen the child joash was constantly in danger because she had decided that any uh any child of the King was a threat to her and because she knew the potential that he had to overthrow her Reign and we don't realize it today I don't think we recognize it as much sometimes as the devil does that we have the potential to overthrow his Reign here in laodicea he set up a Satan's Eden he has set up a a government he set up a a way of of worship he set up a a culture that worships Satan how many know that today brother random preached the sermon Satan's Eden he said he set up an Eden to sin in and and he realizes that every son and daughter of God has the potential to break out and overcome and to actually overthrow his kingdom and so he's watching every time he knows the potential potential of it and so that's why Italian knowing the potential knowing the blood that ran through their veins knowing where they come from knowing who their their parents were they she tried her best to destroy them don't you realize Satan today he's after our homes he's after our children he's after you and I he's he's coming after you because he knows the potential that you have to be children of God to be Sons and Daughters of the king Satan knows the potential of these young men he knows the potential of these young ladies so what's he going to do he's going to do everything he can to keep them away from the Lord and how is he going to do that by the JT the the way that he the main way he can do that one of the ways that he can do that I should say is to keep him out of the house of God there's a culture today that that their children are not hid in the house of the Lord anymore but they're left to their own devices and I would say to you today that it's an antichrist spirit and I'm not calling any person Antichrist but it's the age we're all dealing with I want you to know what you're fighting today I'm not preaching at you but I want you to know what you're fighting there's a real devil out there that wants to try to take your children away wants to try to make them where they'll never become a youth group they'll never become why because they're they weren't hid in the house of the Lord but we have God he told us how to take care of our children he told us how to do those things and but Satan he wants to get in and get at them and and so we again as we begin talking about a home and what it should be and how it should be happy and how it should be nice and how we should keep it for our children that's what we ought to do but now when it comes to the house of the Lord what's he going to try to do first he's going to try to keep you from going and then if he tries to give you if he can't keep you from going he's going to try to make it just a form of godliness a form of worship a formal dead cold formal worship if he can't do that he'll try to make it some kind of fanaticism and get you off of the word if he can't do that he'll try to do everything that he can to keep your focus off the word while you're hearing while you're here he works on all of us don't it some of us are in church every time the doors are open and he still works against us to try to keep our minds out of the house of God keep our hearts from receiving why because he knows the potential I hope you're hearing me this morning he knows the potential of one service Satan knows that better than you do he knows the potential of one service notice that when Jesus left the earth when he ascended there was over 500 people yeah watched him ascend but Satan knowing the potential oh god of people that would be gathered together obeying God's instructions in an upper room knowing the potential of people in one Accord in one place don't undersell the house of God today let's not understand it let's not let's not just make it something oh we can do it or we might not be able to do it no saying knows the potential of that he knows what it oh God if we can just realize the potential that comes with every service this today might be your healing today might be your deliverance today might be the day that you receive something Eternal from God hey man you said well I could get that at home yes you could but this is God's provided way gathering together and they knew oh God Satan knew that he that they were about to receive something so he did everything he could and he managed to succeed with some of them because 500 saw him go up physically saw him ascend and only 120 went to church that day all right think about it this is not a minor thing it's life and death and I realized that you make it a law and that again it becomes a trap of the devil because then it becomes a force we don't force ourselves even it ought to be something we want to do it ought to be a desire in our heart to feed on the word you don't have to force Eagles to feed on the fresh kill of the word right you don't have to do that and so it should never be a force because when it's a force then it becomes a tradition and it's just a family tradition it's just something we do but we need we want to be hit in the house of God because we know the potential of our children you hear me today we know the potential of this church and you you may not see it but there's potential the Lord left us here for a reason we're here in 2022 for a reason we weren't just set here to be bumps on pickles and wait out to come no we're here for a reason we're in Hardy Arkansas for a reason but so God left you here puts you here for a reason sister Joanne he left you here for a reason God allows you to be here for a reason he put brother Joel here for a reason each one of you for a reason what did he he knows the potential God knows the potential the devil knows the potential do you realize the potential today he knows what this service could do now joash was hid in the house of God to keep a Thalia from destroying him it was life and death and the scripture tells us and I think I've always kind of misunderstood this scripture in Hebrews 10 25. because I've always taken this as being not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the man or something is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching I've always taken the last part of that as so much the more to we should get together more but that's not actually what he's saying if you read it and think about it he's actually saying not to have more services although that would be a good thing all right but but that's not what he's saying he's not saying don't have more services what's he saying so much the more exhort one another more right as you see the day approaching exhort one another to be in the house of the Lord more as you see the day approaching now why does he want you to exhort one another more because Paul being a prophet could see that as the end time Drew near there would be a great falling away and there would be a great lack of desire and there would be a great cooling off and there would be a great lukewarmness take over the world and so there would come a time at the end of the age when even good people would not would just somehow lose the joy of the Lord the Salvation that the joy of their salvation and they would they would go back they would draw back from the house of the Lord and he knew there would be so many false prophets and so many ravening wolves and so many false churches they hear me this morning that the devil would use that to keep the people use it as scarecrows to keep the people out of the house of God so he said when you get near the end time exhort one another more to be in the house of the Lord are you with me now something about these times makes it even more necessary for us to assemble together because athalia the queen who calls herself the Queen of Heaven ahab's daughter that lukewarm Church religion is in the land that's the ruler of the of the land that we're living in now he said well it's the president it's just one of that one no it's salute it's Italian it's that Spirit we're waiting on Sunday well someday Catholicism will take over it already has in ecumenicalism it already has the church has gone back to their mother even the Pentecostal the charismatic church has went back literally to Rome and make declared themselves one with Rome where are we at church we're living in a day when there's no fire anywhere there's no there's no joy anywhere there's no power anywhere there must there's only there's only life in one place and that's in the grain it's the hour we're living in it's life or death oh god oh as a father I want to hide my children in the house of the Lord don't you ask parents let's hide them in the house of the Lord let's stay in the house of the Lord and and I realize there's things many things that'll keep us out but we should exhort each other more as we see the day approaching something about these times makes it more necessary II Timothy three and one this snow also in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves boy we could stop for a while on that covet just posters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents I'm thankful Unholy Traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and that's uh he goes on to say they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof but today brother random says that he interprets that this way he said today we're getting so slothful the church is getting so worldly and so indifferent and their mind's so muddled up with television and we love Lucy and some of these old things and staying home right so that he's watching the desire of the people and brother Branham hits this over and over and over and over again on the message it's this one particular television show over and over again but it was emblematic of an age that was losing their desire to come to the house of the Lord and they had more of a desire to watch We Love Lucy which is a pretty terrible TV show I mean there's really not that much bad about it it's just terrible boy I like the fact he never mentioned the Andy Griffith Show but the truth is he's talking about loving those things more than you love God so there's something about this age are you hear me now Paul's telling us something about this age people are going to be loversed of pleasure more than lovers of God and he said so muddled up with television and staying home he said that shows where the people's hearts are and you can tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it love it's a pleasure more than lovers of God he said oh the greatest pleasure I know of oh God where do we find our pleasure today he said the greatest pleasure I know of is to pray until I can realize I'm in the presence of God and recognize it how long has it been since you prayed until you knew you were in the presence of God and you recognized it he said I think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit oh don't you want that to be your thrill this morning oh my heart just ignites sometimes when I come up here and I feel the presence of God and the people worshiping what is it that ought to be the thrill of the church it's the presence of the Holy Spirit more than any ball game more than any any workout more than any emotion but the thrill of the church is his presence being right here with us that ought to make our hearts happy ought to make us want to come to the house of God ought to make us rejoice when we're in the house of God it's a thrill of the church oh my sometimes it takes your breath away oh that you would come and be among us but it gets so common to us that's the thrill of the the ought to be the thrill of the church seeing the god that made the promise standing Among Us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give faith to make cripples walk blind sea death here dumb speak he said well I'll go to a meeting and then that'll happen no that ought to be the presence of God in the church brother Branham taught us to take our children to church I won't read everything just to but there's quotes for all of these things he taught us to take our children to church he taught us it's because I preached way too long last week so I'm trying I'm doing my best today but brother random taught us to take our children to church he taught us to sin to send your children to Sunday school right you've heard him say that he said you need to take them he taught that you can miss work but don't miss church so brother random taught that he said if you do have to miss work once in a while that won't hurt he said because work that's just your daily bread he said the Lord promised to provide that he said but you must really be sure to come to church and and again I believe that going to the house of God should be a The Thrill of the church it shouldn't be like going to the dentist right right and sometimes it's us preachers that make it like that you know and man we gotta go get a tooth pulled today and going to the house of God shouldn't be like that shouldn't shouldn't be like that I know there's things that we deal with and things that hurt us and sometimes I watch people something will happen and for years they're impacted in church because they there's there's a heaviness on them because they've had a loss or suffered in their life in some way or or they've been betrayed in some way and there's a heaviness there but we shouldn't come to the house of God like we're going to the dentist we shouldn't go like oh I'm going to get a tooth pulled today man uh you know when you go to the dentist you don't want to show up too early you got to hear them pull all the other people's teeth and and you try everything you can to get out of it and any little excuse you you can use you try to get out of going to the dentist but that's not the way Church ought to be to us brother bear said the holy spirit will bring forth a holy life he said and if the desire is in your heart if you have to force yourself constantly to try to press and do what's right the world is still hungering in you and there's something wrong he said the Holy Spirit and you will not hunger for the world it will hunger for God oh I'm telling you today church if you stop short maybe he's repented and you've been baptized and you believe but there's you stop short and there's something there you can tell there's still a hunger for the world you still you don't have that desire to be in the house of God it's time to check up there's more for you Now's the Time to come to an altar Now's the Time to to seek for God seek for him at home seek for him in the word why would you want to seek for him because you know there's something missing and I would say to those of us who've had the Holy Ghost and we believe but every once in a while we get a little bit cold and we get our Eagle Eye gets filmed over we get to a place where we don't feel safe no more and that's fine you're safe whether you feel saved or not right you're saved before the foundation of the world really God but God saved you before the fact one day you found out you were saved but now your Eagle Eye gets filled over and you begin to not want it filmed over you don't want to go to church anymore what do you do during that time go find The Rock and beat your head against the rock until the until all the old crusts and all the old junk of the world begins to fall off of you that's the time to go to church that's not the time to quit that's the time to be in the house of God can you say Amen this morning hey man I know some of you thought as I get older I'm gonna gonna gonna settle down a little bit but it ain't gonna happen not yet anyway now maybe if I get any fatter it might [Laughter] you can laugh it's all right what is the Holy Spirit what will it do it'll make you hunger for God what a dangerous thing if that hunger's not there Church you realize that if the dove flies to the Gable end of your souls brother Branham put it so poetically there's no difference in what this flesh wants then if he's not there at all see if he's lost his influence on you I hope you hear me this flesh is still capable of everything it's still capable of Deceit lies huh sexual sin don't you ever think that your flesh is not capable it's still capable even with the Holy Ghost but because that influence lifts off of your life we need to pray if there's not if there's no hunger for the house of God there's no hunger for the word of God no hunger to read our Bibles and to pray we need to get down to business with God we need to reach a place in our heart where we you know when you say brother Ben you shouldn't talk like that you shouldn't preach at us like that but but if I don't who's going to this is this is my this is my job God put me here for a reason not just to tickle people's ears but to tell you the truth if it's hard you have to force yourself constantly to go to church and we realize there's a flesh and a spirit and a soul and you realize that from your soul you want to serve God but the flesh you don't want to but you push your way through it you feel tired but you do it anyway but when you get to the point where you can't you hardly feel the influence of that Soul that's the time you need a prayer meeting you need to talk to God because the holy spirit in you will not hunger for the world it'll hunger for God he said if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open there's something wrong with that spirit it's trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the church door opens for fellowship and we can talk about everybody else all we want to and and talk about those who have taken the pastor out of the church and taken the church out of the church and and set people to where they're doing communion alone and everything like that we know that's false it's Antichrist in this sense that it's anti-word right it's against the word and not calling the people Antichrist but it's anti-word we know the word teaches against that we know better than that but don't you think the devil's going to try to get you too what did Nathalia do she tried to destroy all the seed Royal they're trying to destroy all the sons of God the spirit of the age is trying to come on you too and it's trying to keep you out of the house of God and the devil don't care why you're missing Church he just cares if you miss that opportunity there's a economic principle and I don't understand much about economics I know brother Allen could help me but there's an economic principle it's called I believe it's called opportunity lost and it's the idea that that when you do something if you spend your money on one thing maybe you could have spent your money on another investment and made more money the devil wants you to miss the opportunity of being in the house of God are you with me now yeah well I'm still a Christian yes you are but the devil wants you to miss that growth every year in the Old Testament when the when the Philistines would come in you remember against shamgar they would come in against shamgar every year and every year the Bible says that they came to destroy the increase of the land and the Bible tells us that during the days of shamgar the roads were empty because the people were so afraid of coming out on the open road oh God they were so afraid of walking on the highway walking on the open road so they hid themselves in their houses and every year they would plant a crop Faithfully they would do what they were supposed to do but every year the Philistines would come right back in and steal the increase the Philistines wanted them to work they wanted them to plant they were okay with them doing those things but they just took the increase don't you realize that's the way the devil wants to do in your life he wants to take away the increase but what happened to shamgar shamgar one day got fed up with it because he saw the condition of his children he saw the condition of his family he saw the condition of the church and he said I'm not going to stand for that I'm not going to let my family not get fed are you with me now I'm not going to let my family stay out of the house of God I'm not going to let my family you say well I may have to move brother Ben then move I might have to I may have to change some things change some things hide your children in the house of the Lord huh I'm not trying to control you today you do what you want to but at least I've preached the word are you with me now hide your children in the house of the Lord every time the door opens for Fellowship there's got to be something in your heart I know some of you can't come every service I realize that but every time you want to yeah yeah you want to there's something in your heart don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers he said if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to praying rather got tired of them coming every year and destroying the crops over and over and over again so what did he do he picked up the only Implement of war that he had he had an ox goad and the Bible says that the Philistines took all the swords out of the Land There wasn't even a sword Smith in the land but they had a they left him a file to sharpen the goads with so that year what Cham guard did is he sharpened that goad he got it so sharp he jumped out of the window in the power of God when that when those 600 Philistines come by his way he jumps out of the window grabs an ox goat and killed 600 Philistines at one time why was he able to do it because he got fed up with the current condition he said Lord today we're going to have church today we're going to go to the house of God today me and my family is going to serve the Lord we're tired of being leftovers for the devil tired of working every year and then the devil's stealing it away are you with me this morning I wish some of us would get tired of every year the devil steals away our joy steals away our peace steals the way everything that we've got it's time to jump out of the window and say devil you don't have a right to my life you don't have a right to my family I'm a son of God [Music] all right are you hearing me this morning brother random talks about the deer he said they got separated from the herd talks about young people talks about how they'll get married and separate from the church don't let that be you huh marry somebody in the house of God so proud of our youth for doing that and but where is somebody in the house of God or it won't separate you from the place of worship but then he goes on he said to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from believers people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can't and people come and tell me brother Brandon I believe every word that Prophet said do you believe that because you're going to be judged by that are you hearing me today he said you can't if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life now what's he telling you if you stay away from church in this hour as you see the day approaching if you stay away from church Italians in the land she's reigning over the land and she's looking for your children she's looking for you she wants to destroy she wants to kill she wants to take him out of the house of God put him out in some nominal church somewhere where there's just just a bunch of carrying on but she wants to keep them away from this word that can make their lives the way they ought to be she wants to take you the same way what's the answer for that hide me in the house of the Lord and there's a deeper revelation of that Beyond just going to church but sometimes we we can't see the forest for the trees we get so lost in the depth of it we can't see that that we we really need to be just be in church obey God but then there's beyond that there's a deeper Revelation in the seventh seal where he talks about being hid in the presence of God hid in the Tabernacle of the Lord in the secret of his Tabernacle what are we in this age we're hid Away by God we're hid like joash was hid away in the secrets of God hit away oh God let me be hid there even when I'm not in church even when I'm not around Believers let me be hid because there's trouble in the land let me be hidden The Secret of his coming oh God oh Hallelujah cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to a table I'll never eat I ain't gonna do it you got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another amen some people say that's changed we can watch online just watch it we got if every person that was watching some other church somewhere else from I'm not condemning the other church not condemning the person either it just says what it is we need to obey God if every person in this area that loved said they loved God and loved this message and watched church services from a thousand miles away would just go to a local church I don't even care which one this would be the strongest area in this message for for the message of the hour just go and put your shoulders to the wheel well there's Hypocrites there will you still go to Walmart you still go to the gas station you go to that old gas station sometimes and it's smelly you go to that gas station you know if you really if you really need a drink of water and you're traveling down the road you really need gas in your car you may go in the dirtiest filthiest old nasty gas station and you may go and have to pump your gas and walk isn't that terrible when you have to pump your gas and walk inside pay for it and we're all used to paying by credit card now and and I'll pass up gas stations sometimes because they don't have a way to pay outside but sometimes you got to go in even before you pump your gas and pay and it's dirty and it's filthy and it's nasty but if you're out of gas you got to get gas you don't care whether there's Hypocrites there or not you don't care what's going on you've been out of the house of God you need to get back in the place where the gasoline is back in the presence of God I'll just stay home and listen to a prophet can't get a better preacher than that but you can't fulfill the word and do that either you can't do what a prophet said I gotta quit apologizing and preach or I'm not gonna get through this we need one another more now brother Brandon said you said well that's changed this is what a prophet said we need one another more now than we ever did need each other that's right is now he said when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church find that one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them shouldn't that be our desire shouldn't that be the rule rather than the exception I've had people tell me and say brother Ben you go to the different meetings and fellowship why that's why how can you do that and I'll tell them that that's just what I do I did that before I was a pastor I want a fellowship with God's people why why would why would having this position keep me from fellowshipping with God's people hi and there's something if we're careful not careful we'll get off to ourselves and we begin to preach a gospel where I'm the only one that's right and no one else is and and pretty soon what you do is you tied to people so to you that if something happened to you that people would have nowhere to go right nobody to turn to cause you made everybody else false find one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them he said that's the way to be a real Christian and we want to be a real Christian today he said then we've got Fellowship protection people love you and pray for you that's notice brother Abraham says that's the success of my meetings it's because real godly people pray for me it gives you a boost doesn't it gives you a boost this morning we don't usually have prayer before we come out but this morning I felt like we needed to pray because this quote was in my mind I thought oh God we prayed before we come out before brother came out the first time we prayed and so but as we're praying you know people godly people are praying for you I value brother Stewart's prayer brother David's prayer brother Joel's prayer brother the Island's prayer brothers are usually sometimes back there with me I want them to be praying for me as I'm preaching brother said that's the success of my Ministry real godly people pray for me I know some of you pray for me I want to encourage you today keep doing it don't just pray for me pray for the church pray for each individual in the church pray for the other churches pray for the other pastors again if they come to your mind as you have time pray for each one why we need it success if we're going to have success in our ministry today as a five-fold Ministry we need those prayers real godly people praying for me keep doing that you're not useless if you're praying don't you never let the devil tell you that so I'm old I've gotten old and I'm off to myself and nobody really thinks about me anymore you're not useless if you're praying you may be all by yourself but God's with you and if you'll pray you're a child of God if you'll pray Heaven's will shake the Devils Tremble When one faint of God gets down on their knees do we believe that today he said brother Branham when he was in uh in Arizona it was in the desert he went out there not to start a church because he wanted to minister all the churches but in Tucson where he was none of them would have him and so his family got out of church but the brand was traveling and preaching still he preached in Phoenix during that time back in Jeffersonville but his family got out of church and if you want to see what happens when you get out of church brother Branham tells us what happened to him and to his family when they got out of church and so brother brand of mine I think it's comical sometimes because if you ask different people you get different stories about who brother Branham asked to go to Tucson but brother Branham is desperate to get a pastor in Tucson and it didn't seem like he was that picky because he asked three or four men to go to Tucson and start a church and the reason was because he felt the people getting cold this is what he says he said I know that each one of you like if you said if you feel like I do I'm so hungry and this is when Perry green starts the church there and Perry was was the most successful because he was independent he had the money wasn't dependent on the people he could just move there and start a church he could do that because he had the financial ability to do it but others started churches as well and there's multiple churches in Tucson today many churches but he started he had asked him to do that he said I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I wonder how many of us feel that way here's a prophet of God he's seen Supernatural things beyond our even comprehension but he gets out of church for a few months and he says I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I don't mean he was backside not going to church I mean he didn't have a home Church where they lived huh he said some experiences I've just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart can you look back in your memory now and see what it was like at that moment when you were first Saved when you first got in contact with God and that feeling that you had brother random goes back to that moment he said I want to feel that again oh that ought to be the desire of our heart today he said So Glorious to my heart when we come into a place we can sit and we see it among us that we are drying as we sit here in the desert I get them on my brother and they talk with me and I talk with them he said always in a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong he said I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit he said we're the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts so we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself he goes on later he said our young people just ride around from place to place from show to show drifting further and further away from God he said right now that's the truth he said I see it in my children I see myself getting to a place I see myself getting to a place he was a prophet of God but he said you've got to assemble ourselves together to worship God the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that much more come together there's only two people here you be one of them that's right oh my and if we come together and worship together than just something another about it Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst in the seventh year of a thalia's Reign things got so bad they got desperate for a Revival the thalia's sons had torn apart the house of God and maybe that some other time we'll get into that but everything was a mess they broke down the walls and took out all the the things that were made to serve God made them serve devils oh God and in Second Kings 11 4 there had been a priest a Godly Man had been watching over joash with his wife there in the temple and they decided that in the seventh year time had run out we're going to make this young man king so they brought him into the house of the Lord and made a covenant with them and and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord and showed them the King's son I don't know about you but I've read the message of the hour and I've heard the message of the hour and what was it doing to me it was showing me Christ he was showing me the King's son and he brought forth the King's son it didn't just show it to him but he brought him forth from where he'd been hidden oh this is good this morning not because I'm preaching it because the word was good he takes the book and opens it up and brings the King's son from where he'd been hidden and put the crown upon it and gave him the testimony which is the word gave him the book and they made him King and they all sit there like bumps on pickles and set back and oh we got a king again that's not what they did but when they made him King yes sir and glory to God they anointed him and they clapped their hands and they said God Save the King you know I I was it's hard to understand the British mind you know they have a king and queen still and I have a king now and did have a queen they loved their Queen and you look at that it's kind of hard for an American to understand that and but you look at that and and the some of them people and when King Charles I don't want to say what I think about King Charles but it isn't much and King Charles you know he's an older man now he's the most of his life and probably should just abdicate and give it to his son but anyway that's my thoughts on the British Monarchy in case you wanted to know but King Charles came to the throne and I watch when they invested him with as king and people were smitten their emotions were some of them were clapping and and and excited crying God saved the king don't make any sense to us but it's not our King don't you realize that many times when it comes the house of God what are we doing we're making him King we're making him King the world may not seem as king other nations may not understand it other churches may not understand it but we're making him King and when we set him up in his proper place of preeminence in the church what do we do we clap our hands we worship we praise God God Save the King he's still here he has preeminence today Glory and he brought forth the King's son and made him King we're not here just to have a meeting today we want to Crown Him King are you with me this morning and whenever you make him King there's a lot of noise brother Brown said isn't it strange where Jesus is there's always a lot of noise he said he entered the temple one day in Jerusalem when he did they broke down palms and screamed oh my there's those those great professors of societies and Priests and said make them hold their peace he said if they hold their piece of rocks will cry out immediately see something is going to cry when he's around Glory he said you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that he said but just wait till this Earth gets her baptism oh that rock so cry out the Earth will it will pass it'll be a great a great noise why something happened and the noise isn't God you understand that the noise is the response to his presence right noise can be there you can make noise and not have the presence of God but the noise is the response to his presence Second Kings 11 13. when the Thalia the queen of the h that old formal Church heard the noise of the garden of the people she came to the people into the Temple of the Lord oh my and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was what it was they elevated him they made him preeminent in the temple he stood by a pillar and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blue with trumpets and Italian winter clothes and cried treason treason brother Brandon said she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her treason let's look how second chronicles puts it second chronicles 23 12. now when Natalia heard the noise other people running oh my goodness we need to watch what Spirits were influenced by yeah yeah when Italian heard the noise of the people running and praising the king no one had to make them run you didn't have to work them up to run they ran because the King was back oh my if we could realize what age we live in and that the book is open and that the king is back in Residence there would be joy in our hearts amen and the people running and praising the king she came to the people and she looked and behold the king stood at this pillar at the entering end and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of music you say well you better be careful about having too many instruments David created instruments just to put there in the temple for times like this when the king would come and be anointed king amen and then Natalia he said also to the singers with instruments of music and such as taught to sing praise and then Nathalia rent her clothes and said treason why she didn't want a Revival in the house of God because the Revival could take away her Authority I want to spend the rest of my time on something specific here because I know in your mind you're going to think for the Ben can we even have a Revival are we even allowed to have Revival brother Branham in in the message he talks about things becoming common to the American people and if you've ever been overseas you know that and you've ever been even some parts of the country different than others it becomes common to us I wonder if that's the way it is in Hardy Arkansas burn over God help us to make him King today I heard a black preacher before I get into this I heard him preaching he did it was doing a good job not a message preacher but he was preaching in the Church of God in Christ and he he made this statement he said it's no he said he used to think it was a miracle when someone was at 400 a day drug habit come out off the streets he said but now I've realized as I got older that the real Miracle is that the children the Saints of the children got saved he said because they see all that the Saints do and God still reaches down and being in the house of God becomes common oh now I've preach about going to church but be when you're in church listen brother Branham said water on a on a dead log just makes it rotten it actually makes it worse because it's just constantly pouring on a dead log we need life we need life it's not just being in church but it's what we do in church what we receive while we're there and brother Brandon talked about the American people and he said the American Revival is over he said it ended about four years ago this is in 1961. it's over that was 1956 you know brother branham's teaching about that he said there's no more Revival in America we're only gleaning in the fields again in Jehovah Jireh he said the Revival is over we know that there's no more Revival Spirit Now watch how he connects this now he said two hours of service everybody is complaining well I ain't going to hear no complaints today two hours of service everybody's complaining what is it a lack of Revival you don't complain about Revival if you were part of it right and I'm not advocating long Services you know I'm not I I do my best not make it long but we're here for a reason let's get the job done while we're here we don't know how many opportunities we'll have to be here let's enter the presence of God yes let's push Beyond the Veil of the flesh yes and see where we're at he said the Revival is over we know that there's no more Revival Spirit two hours of service everybody's complaining in Revival it's day and night all the time never breaks the Revival is done we're just cleaning again he said the Revival is over and we hear not long ago he said while the Revival is burning and now it seems now watch he identifies another another attribute of Revival being over he said it seems it's kind of hard to get the church filled up the pastors tell me that it's hard nowadays Amen brother random and the people won't go to church I'm not preaching at you this morning I I again that's not what it's about I want to I want us to know what we're fighting they'd rather stay home and watch television or something the Love Has Gone out of their heart see God to a place there's no there's another sermon got to a place there's no confession another attribute of no Revival no love among the people it seems like it's dying daily church is cooling off everywhere you find the Revival is over and you find the cooling off and brother Branham goes on and talks about how anything without emotion is dead and the message perseverant and you ought to take it and bury it but he said now we are all in love with him I'm sure he said but there's a great cooling off amongst the people the Revival is over the fires is going out but watch what he says he said see it's time for something to happen yeah yeah and he goes on a quote I read the other night and he went on I didn't read that part but he went on to say when he said I just believe he said I'm just Quaker enough to believe and when the fire goes out he said you move on where did the fire go out in in the label to see an age the ones who rejected Christ he's outside the door knocking they're lukewarm they're they're miserable and blind and wretched and don't know it right that's where the Revival's gone from from the land of America it's gone I think about no more Revival I'm going to read you it part of this I've read it before but this kind of a widely abused quote sometimes we need to take some of these quotes and give them a rest because we've abused them so badly they need to go into foster care but the man said there can't be no organization left neither can can there be any further advancement than what's going right now for she'll burn before the day breaks again the Revival is over Across the Nation he didn't say there'd be no further advancement he said no further advancement except what's going on right now all right now watch he said there ain't going to be no more revivals Now watch how he qualifies it big sleeping revivals this nation never receive it but I'm not here as a nation today I didn't come to church I'm an American but I didn't come to church with an American Spirit as an American under the auspices of being an American that's not why I'm in church because many people have the right to go to church and don't they're Americans they have the right to stay home too right but that's not what makes me come to church I didn't come as an American I come as a child of God come as one who saw the message and moved on in the advancement now watch he said there ain't gonna the Revival's over he said Across the Nation there ain't going to be no more revivals big sweeping revivals this nation never receive it you might have an intellectual Gathering but I mean a spiritual Revival we've seen all of it he said I hope you're catching it I'm saying it in such a way I hope you get it he said it's over a fine Minister said a while ago said brother random if I could just have the joy of the Lord in my heart I said Son the Revival is over now we all want to identify with that Minister because it gives us an excuse to not have any Joy that's right yeah bless God I that's me okay never been who you preaching now I'm preaching My Flesh because you want to use every excuse you got right sure in the flesh well the Revival's over so if I want to be grumpy I can be grumpy the Revival is over he said Son the Revival is over but you don't know who that Minister was think about it somebody asking a question but we don't know his status we don't know if he'd moved on into the advancement or not just hang with me and and I do I will say this that it does affect us right we gotta fight and I think brother random is showing us too that that's the fight we're going to have to fight Satan's going to try to steal our joy but there's got to be somebody who's not identified with the mass of laodicea and the Blackness there's got to be somebody who's an overcomer of that said sign the Revival is over now the stabilizer has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave Yonder nearing the shore he said we're nearing the shores and stay stable stay in the word stay with God and if you take that and you type that back to the Inner Room in the outer room and in the Old Testament there in the Tabernacle there was an interview there was a holy of holies there was an outer Court there was a there was a court of the Gentiles as it was and so in the outermost Court they were dependent on the outside uh the outside rain and all of that on the innermost Court they were dependent on on man-made things but on the inside of the inside was the Shekinah Glory when you got on the inside your joy is not dependent anymore on what's going on on the outside it's not dependent on a church Revival it's not dependent on a national Revival but it's dependent on that fire being on the inside of the holy of holies right brother random preached that for years and people still use it as an excuse for dead churches yeah now watch what brother random says now and now again now these we'll read this quote in a moment I want you to understand the Revival is over for America but not for the bride if you believe the Revival is over for the bride you failed to see her Awakening that's what they did they failed to see The Awakening of the Bride we know the next national Revival is for the Jews I mean I understand that today but if you say the Revival is over for you are you sad as an excuse to not be on fire for God what are you saying I don't want to be in church the love is gone from my heart The Joy has gone from my life because those are the conditions of the Revival being over I want to stay at home and watch television instead of go to church I'll say this there's no Revival in your flesh and if you give into it you'll do exactly that right but it's that inner man that's got to drive things that's the man in the engine room let him drive things if he's not in power today if he's not the one driving things it's time you come to an altar it's time you search for God and I don't mean you can come up here if you want to you need to find a place to pray yeah oh God say the Revival is over brother now watch I'm gonna read you something's going to shock you because the prophet said this too he said they say the Revival is over it isn't over it's the same Prophet yes after 1956. 1959 they say the Revival is over it isn't over go forward oh my if you want Revival go forward he said it's time that Pentecost has played out it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ and go forward there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit will move on to somebody else and leave you standing and that's exactly what it did to those Pentecostal people the Revival moved on into the wheat the maturing of the wheat you all understand that now we now we're laying in the presence of the sun to ripen but that is our Revival oh God look he said you see they were looking for the wrong kind of Revival he said you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a Revival well I wish brother Ben would be in Revival I wish the church was in Revival he said that it that ain't the Revival for you I believe we can have church revivals I believe we can see the spirit of God move but that ain't the Revival for you the Revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for God there might not be another member of the church wanting that Revival but if it breaks out on you it'll break out in other places see the problem is we're looking for Revival in a building we're looking for Revival in a preacher we're looking for Revival in some a tape or a book we're looking for Revival in a piano or an organ but that's not where the Revival is that ain't the Revival for you but the Revival is in here hey man he said today the church ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth again he talked about that Welsh police officer he tipped off his hat and he talked about the one you remember the story of the Welsh Revival brother Branham loved that Revival because it was started spontaneously by the spirit of God it just proceeded the Pentecostal Revival and the wells police officer was standing there and the men from overseas come to find Revival and they come looking for him and they said where is the Welsh Revival they were looking for a building they were looking for a group of people he said he tipped his hat and said serves the Welch Revival is held in here in his heart oh that's it he was the Welch Revival he said oh God if we can only understand that we are the reflection of Jesus Christ his word made manifest do we understand that this morning he said sir it's in my heart what building is it in sir it's in my heart he was the Welsh Revival he said today the church ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth because I live you live also my life will be in you the works that I do you do also the church has got to get to that place too and he promised it would do it and right the rest of you weren't watching and it will that's me I see that in the word and I'm going to identify with that you can identify with dead layer to see all you want to you can identify with with a religion of of the world all you want to you can identify make it all something some kind of emotion or something but I want a Revival of the word I'm not going to have it a prophet said I would the Revival's in here that's why a preacher can still preach with urgency people can still respond with urgency we can still have prayer lines we can still have altar calls we can still even though the Revival is over out here we can still feel the presence of God move Among Us get in our feet get in our hands get in our worship how does it do that because we are the Revival Glory amen he was so filled amen I'm almost done he said the church he said because I live you live also the church has got to get to that plant place too and he promised it would do it and it will it has it's got to come that way he said he was so filled with the Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh Revival we ought to be so filled with Christ till we reflect him in the power of His word that slaughtered to us to this day brethren can you hear the Cry of a prophet of God today don't take it as my words God sent a prophet in this hour maybe it don't mean anything to you but he's quoting the word what did the Bible say exhort one another more as you see the day approaching be together assembled together go to the house of God worship because Italians in the land she's trying to keep you from doing it she's trying to destroy the seed Royal oh no watch he said Brethren don't be stooped in things of the world these cares they're not all bad things but these cares that take you away stay with the gospel watch every word don't go back to what some father said let's go right now what Jesus said was to take place in this day what did he say we would be the Revival yes sir we are supposed to be the light of this age manifesting the gospel Luther was his life Wesley with his light Pentecost was his life but we're farther up the road now we're coming into the bride that called out the elected said remember if you are you're just like that officer musicians go ahead and come said he had it in him oh God you're the bride you're not in a desert with no water struggling and just burning up and barely able to breathe but you're by The Fountains of Living Water you've got an Artesian well out of your belly flows rivers of Living Water the Bible says you're the pride you're his children but brother man I don't feel that way or maybe it's gotten common to us brother random told a story let's play something doesn't matter what it is brother Brandon told a story about an old sailor the old salt he called him he was a writer never seen the ocean and he so badly wanted to see it and he wrote about it he wanted to see the the crashing waves and the Beautiful sunrises and sunsets when to smell the the salt Breeze if you've never seen the ocean what a beautiful what an awesome thing it says he was walking along so excited about going to see the ocean he said in an Old Salt coming back off the ocean out of the boat met him on the way and he told him he said so where are you going why are you so excited about he said I'm going down to see the ocean I want to see the waves I want to feel it I I want to know I want to be immersed in it you know you can watch a webcam of the ocean but it's not like being there there is a physical presence of God that surrounds us and I want to preach about that tonight the Lord willing but it surrounds us when we're in the house of God when we're gathered together we're two or three are gathered in my name I am in the midst of there is a presence of God that comes here and you can you immerse yourself in it by being there and this old salt coming back from the ocean if this man was describing it to him he said well I spent my whole life there don't mean nothing to me Lebron called him an old salt because as he aged the wind and the and the and the light the sunlight that was so pleasant to the man who's going to visit for the first time it actually hardened him it lathered his face toughened his skin he couldn't feel the wind on it like it used to didn't mean nothing but the Bible said that's why America lost her Revival it become common to her can you think of that she didn't lose it because it wasn't available [Music] she didn't become dead and cold and formal because there was no Revival available she become dead and cold and formal because it was too available [Music] it was surrounder and God shook those gifts all around her a prophet of God Ministries going everywhere Healing The Sick raising the dead Pentecostal moves everywhere and it becomes so common to the people they didn't even they come to church and I said make me happy Show Me A Sign God instead of falling on her face and believing and being like the Gentile the man who's come to Jesus said I'm not even worthy that you step in my house but I believe by you at your word my daughter will be healed but instead of being like that they they were so used to having him around the Pharisees were so used to having Jesus there that they forgot to even welcome him and wash his feet oh God I pray that we would not be so used to going to church we would not be so used to singing the Psalms that when we sing about a redeemer it don't mean nothing to us when we cry out about an Old Rugged Cross it don't mean nothing to us we talk about the agony of Gethsemane and it doesn't mean anything to us we talk about an open book and a message of the hour and it doesn't through our hearts anymore why we're becoming old salt so God help us today God help us today it's not because the presence of God isn't here he's here promised he would be but are we willing to accept it put aside things for just a moment say Lord I welcome you being I want to be in Revival Lord I want to hide my children in the house of God I want to have a home that's right I want to have a church home that's right the only way that I can do that is by being in your presence Lord you can be here physically in church and not be in the presence of God because you so hardened to it God help us today I don't want to be like that to you I want to welcome him in don't you let's do that now let's stand together let's stand together and just worship him for a moment I want to welcome him man if you need to pray the altar is open this morning I felt the need in my own life to pray lately because I feel like that this is the end and as we get near the end we need to be more in prayer we need to be more that much more because we see the devil coming out trying to destroy the seed role what do they do it what is he doing trying to make men women and women men trying to destroy homes trying to destroy preachers trying to destroy why is he doing that because he knows the potential of you in
