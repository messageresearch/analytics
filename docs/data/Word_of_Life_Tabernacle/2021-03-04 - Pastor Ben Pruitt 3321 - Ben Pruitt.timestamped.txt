[40:21] amen do you love him tonight
[40:25] amen second corinthians chapter 11 and
[40:28] verse
[40:29] 1. ii corinthians 11 and 1 and then
[40:32] we'll read from ephesians
[40:34] 5 and verses 31 and 32 once again
[40:38] i want to continue on my thought of the
[40:41] mystery of marriage
[40:43] and i want to talk tonight about the
[40:44] first fall and i want you to think
[40:46] spiritually because every one of us are
[40:50] we believe we want to be at least the
[40:52] bride of christ
[40:54] and so there's a mystery here that we
[40:56] can know
[40:57] second corinthians chapter 11 and verse
[40:59] one would to god you could bear with me
[41:01] a little in my folly and indeed bear
[41:03] with me
[41:04] for i am jealous over you with godly
[41:06] jealousy
[41:08] for i have espoused you to one husband
[41:11] that i may present you as a chaste
[41:13] virgin
[41:14] to christ i just realized brother jt the
[41:18] other day how
[41:19] incredible this scripture is what he's
[41:22] saying is that
[41:23] it is possible for you and me to be
[41:26] presented
[41:27] as a chaste virgin to christ as though
[41:31] we had never done it in the first place
[41:34] amen what a wonderful thing
[41:38] and he says but i fear lest by any means
[41:41] as the serpent beguiled eve through his
[41:44] subtlety so your mind should be
[41:46] corrupted from the simplicity
[41:49] that is in christ for if he that cometh
[41:52] preacheth another jesus whom you have
[41:54] not
[41:54] we have not preached or if you receive
[41:56] another spirit which you have not
[41:58] received
[41:59] or another gospel which you have not
[42:01] accepted you might well
[42:04] bear with him and then ephesians chapter
[42:07] 5 and verse 31
[42:09] says for this cause shall a man leave
[42:11] his father and mother
[42:13] shall be joined unto his wife they too
[42:16] shall be one flesh
[42:18] this is a great mystery but i speak
[42:19] concerning christ
[42:21] and the church pray the lord with his
[42:24] blessing to the word you may be seated
[42:26] this evening it's good to have all of
[42:28] you here tonight
[42:34] the first spring was wonderful
[42:38] as we said last week it was a paradise
[42:41] it was eden
[42:42] which means pleasure everything was
[42:45] new and the couple was in love
[42:51] and spring is a wonderful time
[42:55] but beware the long days of summer
[42:59] because a dry summer leads to a fall
[43:04] ever since that fall it's been winter
[43:06] for mankind but there will be another
[43:10] spring
[43:12] don't you love spring it's that time of
[43:14] year when when life is renewed when
[43:16] everything's new and fresh and and
[43:18] wonderful and
[43:20] every one of us experienced that in our
[43:21] marriage i'm sure
[43:23] every one of you that is married have
[43:25] experienced that
[43:26] every one of us that have been birthed
[43:28] into christ that have been married to
[43:30] the word
[43:31] we also have experienced that we know
[43:34] what it's like for that newness and that
[43:36] freshness of the relationship
[43:39] even though that first honeymoon was one
[43:42] that they didn't have to leave
[43:44] and that first place that they were was
[43:46] perfect
[43:47] yet somehow it in in the time and we
[43:50] don't know how long that it was
[43:52] but somehow during that time it
[43:55] it led to a fall
[43:58] and they didn't see it coming but it
[44:00] came anyway how did that happen
[44:03] adam and eve had never had a fight never
[44:05] got mad
[44:06] wouldn't they never went to bed angry
[44:09] not speaking to one another for days
[44:11] they'd never done that
[44:13] they never fought over who did the
[44:15] dishes
[44:16] never got upset about one doing more
[44:19] work than the other one
[44:20] never had that problem at all it was
[44:23] perfect
[44:25] everything was just the way it should be
[44:29] there was no reason for them to be
[44:31] dissatisfied
[44:32] with what they had and i just want to
[44:36] stop here and say today there's no
[44:37] reason for us
[44:39] to be dissatisfied with what we have in
[44:42] christ
[44:43] there's no reason for us to be
[44:45] dissatisfied with the message of the
[44:47] hour
[44:47] there's no reason for us to be
[44:49] dissatisfied with what god's given us in
[44:52] this day
[44:52] to be dissatisfied with our with our
[44:55] brothers and sisters to be dissatisfied
[44:57] with the word of god there's no reason
[44:59] for that and yet many people are
[45:02] many people are looking for something
[45:04] else looking for another opportunity
[45:06] looking for another messenger looking
[45:07] for another time looking for something
[45:09] great to come
[45:10] but i'm here to tell you today we're
[45:12] living again
[45:14] in a place where we can be restored back
[45:16] and it's been restored in our soul
[45:18] and it's leading us to a place where
[45:21] there's another eden coming again
[45:24] we're going right back to that place as
[45:26] i said last week we're not going back to
[45:27] just to pentecost we're not just going
[45:29] back to that we're going back to eden
[45:31] again
[45:32] and to go back to eden again we have to
[45:35] have the message of the hour
[45:38] amen so that we can be presented as a
[45:41] chaste virgin to christ
[45:44] now there's no reason for us to be
[45:46] dissatisfied with that
[45:50] but somehow adam and eve got separated
[45:53] long enough
[45:55] for the serpent to come in
[45:58] the honeymoon was over
[46:02] how did that happen the serpent first of
[46:04] all was cunning
[46:06] the bible says now the serpent was more
[46:09] subtle than any beast of the field
[46:12] which the lord god had made
[46:15] this is why paul said you might bear
[46:17] with him
[46:18] you might bear with him because he's
[46:20] convincing
[46:22] because he's got something that sounds
[46:24] good
[46:26] i'm so i'm so grateful for the fact that
[46:29] this end time bride will not
[46:30] fall because you remember paul had to
[46:33] say that to a generation of people
[46:35] that seed had to fall into the ground
[46:37] and die
[46:39] right and i believe the warning applies
[46:41] to us as individuals today
[46:43] but this end time bride will not fall
[46:46] right because there's uh he's saying to
[46:49] them
[46:49] i fear that you would bear with him but
[46:52] now there's been something take place
[46:54] what's happened and i'm getting
[46:55] ahead of myself but if we've been sealed
[46:57] away
[46:58] brother madam called it the womb being
[47:00] sealed you can't receive seed from
[47:02] anywhere else
[47:04] right and that what does that make you
[47:06] do it makes you want to work for him
[47:08] that much more
[47:10] but you've been sealed away you can't be
[47:12] deceived in this hour
[47:14] why not it's a very practical thing why
[47:16] because the message of the hour has come
[47:18] and because that word it wasn't just
[47:20] words on a book or
[47:22] in a book or on a tape but it's
[47:23] something that come in your heart
[47:26] you met christ the word of the hour and
[47:28] it become your life
[47:30] and so you might be misled from time to
[47:32] time but you will never be deceived like
[47:34] eve was
[47:36] you can't be because that's not the age
[47:38] we live in
[47:40] but paul says you might bear with him
[47:42] because he's so cunning
[47:44] now brother branham said oh boy that
[47:47] guy's a smart man
[47:48] you might say that about someone that
[47:50] guy's a smart man not very many people
[47:52] say that about me but
[47:54] maybe brother joe or some of y'all
[47:55] somebody will say that's a smart man
[47:58] he said well that don't mean a thing
[48:00] sure ahab was a smart man
[48:03] belter chazar was a smart man he said
[48:06] satan was the most cunning
[48:08] and crude subtle he said
[48:12] none of you could withstand him
[48:15] none at all
[48:19] thank god for revelation today because
[48:22] by our natural
[48:23] intellect we would we would become just
[48:26] like the world
[48:28] we would be as deceived as the world is
[48:31] by our natural intellect he said well i
[48:34] know the message i know what a prophet
[48:35] said with your own
[48:36] intellect alone none of you could
[48:39] withstand him
[48:40] none at all amen
[48:44] because that's the kind of a of a
[48:45] deceiver that he is ezekiel 28 and 12
[48:48] tells us about satan and remember the
[48:50] serpent was anointed
[48:52] by satan to anoint eve with unbelief
[48:56] right and and so now we have satan
[48:59] indwelling the serpent
[49:01] he comes down and dwells the serpent and
[49:04] he anoints him
[49:05] to anoint eve with unbelief so that
[49:08] she'll believe
[49:09] what he has to say over the word of god
[49:13] so ezekiel 28 12 son of man take up a
[49:15] lamentation upon the king of tyrus
[49:17] remember
[49:17] the king of tyrus is a it's a type if
[49:21] you will or
[49:22] a figurehead that stands for the for
[49:25] satan
[49:26] for lucifer he said they're saying to
[49:28] him thus saith the lord god thou sealeth
[49:30] up to some
[49:31] full of wisdom perfect in beauty he said
[49:35] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[49:38] every precious stone was that covering
[49:40] he goes through all the stones
[49:42] and the workmanship of thy tabriz sun of
[49:44] thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
[49:46] day
[49:47] that thou was created thou art the
[49:50] anointed cherub that covereth and i have
[49:52] set thee so
[49:54] i was upon the holy mountain of god thou
[49:57] was
[49:57] walked up and down in the midst of the
[49:58] stones of fire
[50:00] you talk about somebody had experience
[50:02] he had it
[50:04] somebody that that had been there and
[50:06] done that he wasn't
[50:07] know johnny come lately he wasn't a
[50:09] novice
[50:10] it wasn't somebody just got flashed in
[50:12] the pan
[50:14] no he was somebody who knew what he was
[50:16] doing
[50:17] he was someone who was who was created
[50:20] as being in that special place that
[50:22] he could he could almost believe that he
[50:24] was god
[50:28] oh church don't you realize that with
[50:31] great power comes great responsibility
[50:34] and here he had he was anointed in this
[50:37] way he said thou art the anointed cherub
[50:39] that covereth and i have set thee so
[50:42] though it's upon the holy mountain of
[50:44] god thus walked up and down the midst of
[50:45] the stones of fire that was perfect in
[50:47] thy ways
[50:48] from the day that thou was created never
[50:50] made a mistake
[50:51] never did anything wrong until iniquity
[50:53] was found in thee
[50:57] you see he believed satan because he was
[51:00] believable
[51:02] he was credible what he said
[51:05] made sense but it wasn't the word
[51:10] right he made sense
[51:14] and many times we reject doctrines out
[51:17] of hand or things because they don't
[51:18] make any sense
[51:20] and we should because god makes sense
[51:23] right we should we should apply common
[51:26] sense
[51:26] brother branham puts it in a kind of a
[51:29] rather funny way once he says that
[51:30] people need to have their brains
[51:32] baptized
[51:33] and go look it up but but it's true you
[51:36] can apply
[51:36] common sense to these things but be
[51:38] careful with it it's got to stay with
[51:39] the word
[51:41] because satan's gospel also makes sense
[51:45] and we'll reject something that doesn't
[51:46] make any sense but satan's gospel makes
[51:49] sense
[51:50] if you sit around it long enough and
[51:52] listen to it long enough and hear it
[51:54] you begin to even think brother branham
[51:57] and i don't have the quote with me but
[51:58] brother branham talks about
[51:59] driving down the road and listening to
[52:01] the radio he said and listen to these
[52:03] people talk about how
[52:04] that there was no creation all these
[52:06] rocks and these things have been here
[52:07] for millions and millions of years
[52:08] brother branham talks about that doubt
[52:10] coming in his own mind
[52:12] while he's driving down the road hearing
[52:14] that why because satan's wisdom makes
[52:16] sense
[52:18] sure it does it makes sense it's
[52:20] something that he doesn't just come up
[52:22] with something it's something that's a
[52:24] makes real sense
[52:27] and he's credible he's somebody that
[52:30] is credible and he uses credible men
[52:33] great men
[52:34] but we've got to say with the word above
[52:36] everything else
[52:38] if it's not the word it's not the word
[52:40] regardless of how much sense it makes
[52:44] now the serpent came
[52:47] and he was credible he was
[52:50] he was believable and he preached the
[52:53] word
[52:56] right he didn't come and bring a book of
[52:58] mormon
[53:00] right he didn't come to even and present
[53:03] to her
[53:04] uh some kind of uh book of islam or
[53:07] a quran or something like that what did
[53:10] he bring
[53:10] the bible the word that they had for
[53:12] that day
[53:14] he commented and brought the word of
[53:16] that day to them and he began to explain
[53:18] to her
[53:19] why things weren't exactly like she
[53:22] thought they were
[53:24] so back to genesis 3 1 he said unto the
[53:27] woman
[53:28] yeah if god said you shall not eat every
[53:30] of every tree of the garden
[53:33] now watch as god said that yes god said
[53:37] that
[53:38] but god said more than that
[53:41] right now in the amplified version it
[53:44] says now the serpent was
[53:46] more crafty subtle skilled and deceit
[53:50] than any living creature in the field
[53:52] which the lord god had made
[53:55] and the serpent they've gotten princess
[53:57] satan said to the woman can it really be
[54:00] that god has said you shall not eat from
[54:03] any tree of the garden
[54:06] can it really be that god has said do
[54:09] you really think that god
[54:11] would say something like that
[54:15] so he's attacking her he's not saying
[54:18] it's not so
[54:19] but he's saying is this what god said
[54:22] how does that make sense
[54:24] he appeals to a reason now
[54:26] [Music]
[54:28] preaching the word but the random says
[54:29] this and satan's eating he said oh you
[54:31] say but wait a minute we preached the
[54:32] word
[54:33] he said look back here at my text
[54:35] tonight satan was the one that preached
[54:36] the word to eve
[54:37] first god has said
[54:42] now no he not only preached the word he
[54:45] misquoted the word
[54:47] right and and how did he misquote it by
[54:49] leaving some of it out
[54:52] right and and so brother branham says
[54:54] this he said remember in the beginning
[54:55] he said the one only fortified
[54:57] that god gave adam and eve was to stay
[54:59] behind his word
[55:00] he said he didn't just not to didn't
[55:02] tell her it wasn't so
[55:04] he just misquoted one little phase of it
[55:08] now look what god had told adam and eve
[55:10] in the beginning in genesis 2 16 the
[55:11] lord god commanded the man
[55:13] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[55:15] mayest freely eat
[55:17] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[55:18] and evil thou shalt not eat of it
[55:20] and the day that thou eatest of thou
[55:22] shalt surely die now watch how god
[55:24] begins this
[55:26] he declares the whole thing of every
[55:28] tree of the garden thou mayest freely
[55:29] eat
[55:31] in other words you can do everything
[55:32] else but don't touch that
[55:36] but he begins it with of every tree of
[55:37] the garden now made us freely eat
[55:39] he reminds them of their privileges
[55:42] and then tells them what not to do
[55:46] right that's what god does but satan
[55:49] only quotes the negative part
[55:52] right satan quotes the negative part and
[55:54] see he will never remind you of how good
[55:56] you have it
[55:58] and you can apply this to a marriage you
[56:00] can apply this to a church
[56:01] as we said his job is to make you
[56:03] dissatisfied
[56:04] he'll never remind you how good you have
[56:06] it he'll only point out the negative
[56:10] he did not give her the full quote and
[56:12] that's why it's so important that we
[56:14] believe all the word
[56:16] psalms 40 and 7 speaking of the messiah
[56:18] coming of christ it said
[56:20] then said i lo i come in the volume of
[56:22] the book it is written to me not just in
[56:24] part of it in the volume of it
[56:26] in the whole in the entirety of the book
[56:29] luke 24 25 then he said unto them o
[56:31] fools and soul of heart
[56:33] to believe how much all
[56:37] that the prophets have spoken and
[56:38] brother branham emphasizes that all
[56:41] to believe all you've got to believe all
[56:45] and so he says and paul
[56:49] takes credit for that in acts 20 26
[56:52] you know in his ministry he said
[56:53] wherefore i take you to record this day
[56:56] that i am pure from the blood of all men
[56:59] i have not shunned to declare unto you
[57:02] all the counsel of god
[57:05] there's nothing i held back because i
[57:07] might lose a taxpayer
[57:10] right because somebody might not like it
[57:13] i i declare it unto you all the counsel
[57:15] of god
[57:17] god help us today
[57:20] declared unto you all the council of god
[57:23] amen now the job of the ministry
[57:28] is to present the whole gospel now that
[57:30] gospel has to be rightly divided
[57:33] or rightly portioned and what that means
[57:35] is that
[57:36] we emphasize the importance or the
[57:39] application
[57:40] of the word for our day because there
[57:43] was a time when noah built an ark and
[57:45] that's still the word of god
[57:47] but today we live in a different day so
[57:49] we preach in the light of the hour we
[57:51] emphasize the importance of the gospel
[57:53] in our day
[57:54] that's rightly dividing the word rightly
[57:57] dividing it
[57:58] making it like a like a steward would
[58:01] give a portion to this one and a portion
[58:03] to that one and a portion to that one
[58:04] god gave a different portion to every
[58:06] age so in
[58:08] second timothy 2 14 he says if these
[58:10] saints put them in remembrance charging
[58:12] them before the lord
[58:14] that they strive not about words to no
[58:16] prophet
[58:18] now y'all just bear with me for a moment
[58:22] but we've got to be careful with this as
[58:24] message believers
[58:26] we're not careful we strive about words
[58:28] to no profit
[58:30] and the bible says the servant of god
[58:32] must not strive
[58:34] must not strive and so we
[58:37] you we strive about words
[58:41] and we've talked about that before there
[58:43] are some things that are essential
[58:44] there's some things that aren't right
[58:47] and those things that are non-essential
[58:50] that if you got it all figured out you
[58:52] wouldn't be any better off
[58:55] right than what you are today and what
[58:58] happens is you strive about those words
[59:00] and so he told he's speaking to timothy
[59:02] he said remind the preachers
[59:05] that they don't strive about the words
[59:06] to no prophet but to the subverting of
[59:08] the hearers in other words it
[59:09] takes them away from the gospel from the
[59:12] simplicity of the gospel
[59:15] and it becomes an over-reliance i don't
[59:17] want to
[59:18] sound like i'm mad at anybody when i say
[59:19] this because so i'll say it with a smile
[59:21] tonight and
[59:22] put on my joel osteen for a moment
[59:25] but
[59:29] we have that xm radio in our in our
[59:32] truck
[59:32] they had a trial free trial on there and
[59:35] and
[59:36] joel osteen has his own channel on there
[59:38] and you can just hear him smiling
[59:39] on the radio
[59:43] but he said don't strive about words to
[59:45] no prophet but to the subverting of
[59:46] hearers and
[59:47] it becomes an over reliance on dates
[59:51] and over reliance on uh you disagreeing
[59:54] with me over a certain date or a certain
[59:56] event or a certain
[59:58] word that brother branham said maybe
[1:00:00] something brother said that
[1:00:02] that to us is unexplainable
[1:00:05] and you attempt to explain it in such a
[1:00:07] way and create a doctrine out of it
[1:00:09] and when we don't know what it means
[1:00:11] because he didn't tell us what it meant
[1:00:15] but it's striving about words no prophet
[1:00:17] and it's the first people takes them
[1:00:18] away
[1:00:19] from the kingdom of god so he tells
[1:00:22] timothy study to show thyself approved
[1:00:24] unto god
[1:00:25] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[1:00:28] rightly dividing the word of truth he
[1:00:29] said but shun
[1:00:31] profane and vain babblings profane and
[1:00:34] vain babbling
[1:00:36] i love the king james version it's so so
[1:00:39] illustrative in in one word in one place
[1:00:42] he calls it paul calls it vain janglings
[1:00:47] vain babbling somebody just knocking a
[1:00:50] bell or
[1:00:51] or it's making noise but there's nothing
[1:00:53] coming out un-profane and vain babblings
[1:00:59] they will increase into more ungodliness
[1:01:05] if you get too far into yourself as a
[1:01:08] minister or as an individual in the
[1:01:09] message
[1:01:11] and believe it or not this applies to
[1:01:13] marriage too
[1:01:14] don't spend all your time on stuff that
[1:01:17] don't matter
[1:01:20] right and this is a trick that the enemy
[1:01:23] used
[1:01:24] to only present part of the word and
[1:01:26] then begin to expound on it with stuff
[1:01:28] that wasn't there
[1:01:30] right and and pretty soon he had eve in
[1:01:32] his in his grasp
[1:01:33] but beware of ministries
[1:01:38] because notice what satan did he only
[1:01:40] took the negative side
[1:01:43] beware ministries that only find fault
[1:01:45] with the message
[1:01:48] with the messenger or with the ministry
[1:01:53] or with the church you could say
[1:01:57] with what we have if all you can do is
[1:02:00] find fault
[1:02:02] that's what satan did that's what balaam
[1:02:05] does
[1:02:07] right if if my ministry is just finding
[1:02:10] fault with other ministries
[1:02:11] nobody gets fed the only thing that gets
[1:02:14] helped is my ego
[1:02:17] right i don't mean to be straight but we
[1:02:20] understand it
[1:02:21] there's many times we'll have preachers
[1:02:23] through all kinds of different preachers
[1:02:24] and i'm
[1:02:25] the ones that have come i'm so thankful
[1:02:26] god has allowed them to preach to us
[1:02:28] things that
[1:02:29] really mattered and good things but
[1:02:31] sometimes
[1:02:32] you'll hear different things as you go
[1:02:34] through life and you've heard many
[1:02:35] different things from different
[1:02:36] preachers but
[1:02:37] but remember that someone is always a
[1:02:40] complainer
[1:02:41] someone that's always finding bad things
[1:02:44] out in everybody
[1:02:45] there's plenty of bad to point out and
[1:02:47] sometimes you've got to point it out
[1:02:48] you've got to declare the whole gospel
[1:02:50] right but someone who only looks at the
[1:02:53] negative side
[1:02:55] and fails to see the promises of god
[1:02:58] will only increase ungodliness
[1:03:03] it won't help it just make it worse
[1:03:08] satan is a complainer the bible says
[1:03:10] he's the father of liars i believe he's
[1:03:12] also the father of complainers
[1:03:14] and complaints he's never happy in an
[1:03:18] eden in a church and i don't have a
[1:03:19] problem with that
[1:03:20] y'all are the least complaining people
[1:03:22] on the face of the earth
[1:03:24] and i appreciate that i probably
[1:03:27] complain more than you all but so i'm
[1:03:29] not preaching at you i'm just saying
[1:03:31] this is true satan is a complainer
[1:03:35] and he begins to complain to eve and
[1:03:38] pretty soon she probably began to
[1:03:39] complain too
[1:03:41] right isn't that what the mixed
[1:03:43] multitude did
[1:03:44] when they come out of egypt the mixed
[1:03:46] multitude of said fell to
[1:03:47] begin to desire the things they had in
[1:03:50] egypt and they began to complain
[1:03:51] and pretty soon the israelites began to
[1:03:54] complain too
[1:03:56] why because complaining spreads from one
[1:03:59] to the other
[1:03:59] and so satan began to complain the
[1:04:01] serpent was complaining
[1:04:03] he began to complain and pretty soon she
[1:04:05] found herself dissatisfied with what god
[1:04:07] had done
[1:04:09] see satan's never happy in an eden
[1:04:12] except his own
[1:04:14] he's not happy in a church that's
[1:04:15] governed by the word
[1:04:17] he's not happy in a marriage discovered
[1:04:19] by the word
[1:04:20] so he's gonna find a way to pick it
[1:04:24] apart and
[1:04:26] brittany's probably got her pitchfork
[1:04:29] out now but
[1:04:30] directed up here but we should not
[1:04:33] constantly find fault with one another
[1:04:36] especially in marriage
[1:04:40] because when you find fault with one
[1:04:42] another constantly you'll make
[1:04:44] a fall out of eden or a fall in eden
[1:04:50] among couples who stay together it's
[1:04:54] been proven by a survey that they did
[1:04:56] that five out of every 100 comments made
[1:04:58] about each other were put downs
[1:05:00] five out of a hundred i think i
[1:05:02] presented this to you before
[1:05:04] but just it'll bear repeating again
[1:05:08] brother adam i'm sorry every time you
[1:05:09] come to church i preach on
[1:05:11] marriage
[1:05:18] couples who would split later 10 out of
[1:05:20] every 100 comments
[1:05:22] were insults they don't seem like very
[1:05:24] much difference
[1:05:26] but if you it's double the number 5 out
[1:05:28] of 100 for couples
[1:05:29] who would stay together 10 out of 100
[1:05:32] and the thing is the gap magnifies
[1:05:35] as you go on the people who complain
[1:05:37] more complain even more
[1:05:39] as the marriage goes along and pretty
[1:05:43] soon
[1:05:44] couples heading downhill were flinging
[1:05:46] five times as many cruel comments
[1:05:49] as happy couples somehow in eden and
[1:05:53] don't ask me to explain how this
[1:05:55] happened
[1:05:56] because that was a pretty nice place
[1:05:59] you'd think that if you could take
[1:06:01] someone to paradise and
[1:06:03] and live there that that that would be a
[1:06:06] pretty good place to be and
[1:06:08] to make your marriage work but somehow
[1:06:11] in eden it didn't work
[1:06:14] somehow in eden married life grew dull
[1:06:20] and adam and eve grew far enough apart
[1:06:23] that eve stopped to listen to the
[1:06:25] serpent
[1:06:28] you see they had to be separated long
[1:06:30] enough because remember
[1:06:32] eve presented it to adam alone
[1:06:35] the serpent was with her alone
[1:06:39] as married people but this applies
[1:06:42] spiritually as well
[1:06:43] be wary of being separated
[1:06:47] married life was meant to be different
[1:06:49] from single life
[1:06:51] if you're going to continue with your
[1:06:52] single life after you get married
[1:06:55] there's a problem there
[1:06:58] some of you that have been married a
[1:06:59] long time don't you don't have anything
[1:07:01] left that you need to work on
[1:07:03] but you know that this is true that if
[1:07:06] you continue to live like you did when
[1:07:08] you were single you wouldn't be married
[1:07:10] still
[1:07:13] and somehow adam was gone i don't know
[1:07:15] why he was gone he probably had a good
[1:07:16] excuse for being gone
[1:07:18] after all he was a miniature god
[1:07:21] had a good job he could go out and speak
[1:07:25] to the trees and
[1:07:27] and talk to all of them and everything
[1:07:28] would be just fine
[1:07:30] but he wasn't there i'm not blaming him
[1:07:34] for it it's just somehow
[1:07:36] he wasn't there
[1:07:39] a man has to work to provide for his
[1:07:41] family but your job will never be as
[1:07:43] important as your family
[1:07:44] not even this job
[1:07:49] i have to remind myself of that
[1:07:50] sometimes because we do lay everything
[1:07:53] down for the gospel and i believe that
[1:07:55] but i've i had this in my notes and i
[1:07:58] took it out but i guess i do
[1:07:59] i was meant to say it because i'm
[1:08:00] reminded of it but i i've been reminded
[1:08:03] by elder ministers
[1:08:04] and every time i talk to an older pastor
[1:08:06] or or an older evangelist
[1:08:08] every time they give me the same piece
[1:08:10] of advice
[1:08:12] spend time with your family
[1:08:16] spend time with your family and someone
[1:08:18] will say it this way don't do what i did
[1:08:22] and i've been given that advice multiple
[1:08:24] times by elder ministers
[1:08:27] because it's a temptation that we have
[1:08:29] to do what feels like
[1:08:31] it's god's work
[1:08:34] and not be with our family
[1:08:38] even if you have to spend more time at
[1:08:39] work than you do with your family which
[1:08:41] sometimes you have to do your job is
[1:08:43] still not more important than your
[1:08:45] family
[1:08:49] moses to illustrate this we'll go back
[1:08:52] to the law
[1:08:53] a lot of things about the law that made
[1:08:55] sense
[1:08:57] this was common sense for that day and
[1:08:58] time they lived in
[1:09:00] moses deals with divorce in deuteronomy
[1:09:03] 24 he talks about a bill of divorcement
[1:09:04] and then he says this in verse
[1:09:06] 5 he said when a man has taken a new
[1:09:08] wife he shall not go out to war
[1:09:10] neither should he be charged with any
[1:09:12] business which sounds like he was free
[1:09:13] to do whatever he wanted
[1:09:16] but he but he said he should be free at
[1:09:18] home one year
[1:09:20] and he has something he's tasked with it
[1:09:23] doesn't mean he didn't work because he'd
[1:09:24] have to work to bring in the crops and
[1:09:26] whatever they normally did
[1:09:27] but he said he won't have any public
[1:09:28] business the first year
[1:09:31] because his job is going to be to cheer
[1:09:33] up his wife
[1:09:35] which he have taken
[1:09:39] do you know that was a biblical job
[1:09:40] requirement for a husband
[1:09:44] make your wife happy
[1:09:47] well i'm not getting any responses from
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:55] that's what it says he'll cheer up his
[1:09:57] life for one year and some of you all
[1:09:58] are saying thank god we're not under the
[1:10:00] law
[1:10:06] but there's a reason for that there's a
[1:10:07] very practical reason for that if he
[1:10:09] gets married and immediately goes out to
[1:10:10] war
[1:10:13] then his wife spends the first year
[1:10:16] all the time wondering where he's at
[1:10:18] they don't get to know one another they
[1:10:20] don't get to
[1:10:21] and we see that today so many people get
[1:10:23] married and then immediately
[1:10:24] begin to work each one their own 60 hour
[1:10:27] a week and sometimes it has to be done
[1:10:29] i'm not
[1:10:29] begrudging your work but i'm just saying
[1:10:31] if you can
[1:10:32] spend time together because it matters
[1:10:38] in making your wife happy
[1:10:42] wesley said that that business was any
[1:10:44] public office or employment which would
[1:10:46] cause an absence from or neglect of his
[1:10:48] wife
[1:10:49] one year that their affections may be
[1:10:51] firmly settled
[1:10:52] so there may be no occasions for the
[1:10:54] divorces last mentioned see
[1:10:56] honeymoons only last for a couple of
[1:10:57] weeks and you got to get down to the
[1:11:00] business of life but even in the
[1:11:01] business of life remember
[1:11:03] you got to learn to know one another to
[1:11:05] love one another
[1:11:07] and how to make each other happy
[1:11:10] the bible keeps reminding men to be
[1:11:12] happy with their wives
[1:11:14] i don't find a place where ever reminds
[1:11:16] women to be happy with their husbands
[1:11:19] but it keeps reminding men to be happy
[1:11:21] with their wives
[1:11:24] proverbs 5 18 let thy fountain be
[1:11:26] blessed and rejoice
[1:11:27] with the wife of thy youth rejoice
[1:11:31] in ecclesiastes 9 and 9 live joyfully
[1:11:34] with the wife whom thou loveth all the
[1:11:36] days of thy life of thy vanity
[1:11:38] when she had given the unto the son all
[1:11:40] the days of thy vanity for that is
[1:11:42] thy portion in this life and in thy
[1:11:43] labor which thou taketh under the sun
[1:11:47] in the new testament in first peter 3 7
[1:11:49] paul or peter puts it this way he said
[1:11:51] likewise your husbands
[1:11:53] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:11:56] i this illustration of that i heard
[1:11:58] brother branham talking today
[1:12:01] about walking with his wife while
[1:12:04] shopping
[1:12:05] and talking about how it wore his feet
[1:12:07] out
[1:12:08] and it was kind of a comical image to
[1:12:11] think about a prophet of god
[1:12:12] following his wife around while she's
[1:12:15] shopping because i
[1:12:16] identify with that
[1:12:19] i've been there and done that most of
[1:12:21] you probably have as well
[1:12:23] but here a prophet of god had to do that
[1:12:25] why to make his wife happy
[1:12:29] and the thing is if it works it won't be
[1:12:30] just one person trying to make the other
[1:12:32] happy because
[1:12:33] all that would bring his arrogance on
[1:12:36] one side but
[1:12:37] you both are trying to make each other
[1:12:39] happy but it's the men many times we
[1:12:41] forget to do it
[1:12:44] and that's why the bible keeps reminding
[1:12:47] us to do it he says well with them
[1:12:48] according to knowledge so brother
[1:12:50] branham
[1:12:51] following along letting his feet get
[1:12:54] wore out when he could have been home
[1:12:55] studying for us
[1:12:59] putting on an apron as we've heard many
[1:13:00] times and and doing those things was
[1:13:02] brother branham's
[1:13:04] brother branham dwelling with his wife
[1:13:06] according to knowledge
[1:13:08] right remember there was a time where
[1:13:10] the brandon was going to go west but he
[1:13:11] waited
[1:13:12] because his wife wasn't ready to go and
[1:13:16] and so there's things you've got to
[1:13:18] give grow with them according to
[1:13:20] knowledge giving honor to the wife is
[1:13:21] unto the weaker vessel
[1:13:23] as being heirs together of the grace of
[1:13:25] life
[1:13:26] that your prayers be not hindered
[1:13:27] because if you're not happy together
[1:13:29] your prayers will be hindered
[1:13:34] see marriage is not about me being happy
[1:13:36] it's about me making someone else happy
[1:13:42] and when you go into it this will make
[1:13:44] me happy you go into it for the wrong
[1:13:46] reasons and again this has a spiritual
[1:13:48] application so we're going to
[1:13:49] come around in just a moment but brother
[1:13:52] branham and christ has revealed in his
[1:13:53] own word says i see four or five of them
[1:13:55] young men young wives fine women he said
[1:13:58] i knew how them boys loved their wives
[1:13:59] so i said to them here is the way to
[1:14:01] test it
[1:14:02] here's the way to test how if you love
[1:14:04] your wife
[1:14:05] he said if your wife before you were
[1:14:07] married he said now you go back
[1:14:09] and say this married life you've just
[1:14:12] been dreaming you were married you
[1:14:13] really wasn't married
[1:14:15] but you dreamed you were and you woke up
[1:14:17] and you went and talked it over with
[1:14:18] your girlfriend and said you know
[1:14:20] i dreamed that we were married we had
[1:14:22] children we were living happy and
[1:14:24] waiting for the coming of the lord and
[1:14:26] everything
[1:14:27] and then this girl would say to you you
[1:14:28] know i love another man better than i
[1:14:30] love you
[1:14:33] i could be happier with the other man
[1:14:36] remember he said this is how you know if
[1:14:38] you really love that woman
[1:14:41] could you from your heart love her well
[1:14:43] enough to say
[1:14:44] god's blessings rest upon you my dear go
[1:14:46] with this other man.
[1:14:48] now he's not telling you to do that
[1:14:50] right he's given us an example an
[1:14:52] allegory
[1:14:54] if you weren't married and she said she
[1:14:56] would be happier with someone else
[1:14:59] could you say go with this other man now
[1:15:02] here's why he said now
[1:15:03] check that each of you men or your women
[1:15:05] see well if your love is correct you
[1:15:08] would do that
[1:15:10] listen for you are interested in her
[1:15:12] welfare
[1:15:14] you want to make her happy
[1:15:18] he said what he said you know you could
[1:15:19] have her you can live with her she's
[1:15:21] your wife she will be she'll marry you
[1:15:23] but she won't be happy
[1:15:26] she would be happier he said and then if
[1:15:28] you love her
[1:15:29] then you want her to be happy
[1:15:32] and brother madam takes that and you can
[1:15:34] go read the rest of the quote brother
[1:15:35] takes it in the spiritual realm
[1:15:37] and he says if god told me i couldn't go
[1:15:40] to heaven
[1:15:41] if that would make him happy
[1:15:45] i'd be willing to go to hell
[1:15:49] you see how non-self-centered that is in
[1:15:51] this culture of
[1:15:53] self-idolatry
[1:15:56] i was watching the other day of a a
[1:15:59] little thing where they walked through
[1:16:01] i've been walking on a treadmill
[1:16:02] i've been gaining weight ever since it's
[1:16:04] a meeting more but i'm walking on a
[1:16:06] treadmill every day
[1:16:08] and as i'm walking i'm looking at the
[1:16:10] pyramids of egypt and
[1:16:12] and this the guide walks you through and
[1:16:14] shows you the pyramids and he shows you
[1:16:16] all the things that
[1:16:16] they were constantly making images of
[1:16:18] themselves the pharaohs were
[1:16:21] you don't see any images of the common
[1:16:23] people the slaves of the
[1:16:24] of the builders or anything like that
[1:16:25] but the pharaohs images are all over
[1:16:27] egypt they've been there for five
[1:16:29] thousand years all over the place images
[1:16:32] of themselves
[1:16:34] the the selfies of the day and i got
[1:16:37] thing about that i thought we're all
[1:16:38] pharaohs today everyone has an ego to
[1:16:42] take care of
[1:16:44] and they post it on their social media
[1:16:46] their walls of their tombs
[1:16:49] they posted inscriptions and told how
[1:16:51] they defeated
[1:16:52] this certain king in assyria and the guy
[1:16:53] said it's a funny thing because
[1:16:56] actually in assyria there's an
[1:16:57] inscription that looks much the same
[1:16:59] about the same battle
[1:17:01] and it says they won
[1:17:05] so it's just like today you can't
[1:17:06] believe what you read on social media
[1:17:09] see it's all about that this idolatrous
[1:17:12] self-worship
[1:17:13] age it's all about me but god says i
[1:17:15] want it to be about
[1:17:17] about me you see god if you think about
[1:17:20] this
[1:17:20] god made it all about us so that we
[1:17:24] could make it all about him
[1:17:26] he condescended came down gave up his
[1:17:29] royal
[1:17:30] station wrapped himself in a body of
[1:17:31] flesh come down on a sneak in
[1:17:33] manger with the animals and he'd come
[1:17:35] down there so that he could make it all
[1:17:37] about me
[1:17:39] to make me happy pretty bad
[1:17:43] but he knew the ultimate goal the bible
[1:17:46] says he endured the cross despising the
[1:17:48] shame
[1:17:48] for the joy that was set before him
[1:17:50] because he knew if he would do that for
[1:17:52] me
[1:17:52] that i would turn back and i would love
[1:17:53] him
[1:17:55] because i was his child amen he said so
[1:17:58] if you love her you want her to be happy
[1:18:00] if you love god you want him to be happy
[1:18:05] every once in a while you run into
[1:18:06] someone that refuses to be happy
[1:18:10] what do you do about that
[1:18:14] paul tells us a brother sister's not
[1:18:16] under bondage in such cases he doesn't
[1:18:18] mean you get divorced and remarried
[1:18:20] but he's saying that if someone is just
[1:18:22] unhappy and leaves
[1:18:23] let him leave because god has called us
[1:18:26] to peace
[1:18:31] you can go read the whole quote and i've
[1:18:32] probably read it to you before if not i
[1:18:34] will at some point
[1:18:35] my brother random questions and answers
[1:18:37] number one he talks about a
[1:18:39] question from a man that whose wife
[1:18:41] wanted a divorce and he said now if she
[1:18:43] is one of god's elected she will come to
[1:18:45] him
[1:18:46] if she's not she's not worth worrying
[1:18:48] about
[1:18:49] he said then that sounds harsh doesn't
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:53] but it's the truth he said then if it
[1:18:56] does he said if you worry it's not worth
[1:18:58] worrying about he's not saying he
[1:18:59] shouldn't be concerned he shouldn't care
[1:19:01] but it's not worth worrying about he
[1:19:04] said if you worry it'll break your
[1:19:05] health down that's what satan wants to
[1:19:07] do
[1:19:08] he said he's working i know at you
[1:19:12] if we could just see where the enemy is
[1:19:13] trying to attack us on every level
[1:19:16] he said so you just commit the whole
[1:19:17] thing to god and go right on serving god
[1:19:19] just as happy as you can be live to make
[1:19:21] someone else happy
[1:19:22] but if that person that you live to make
[1:19:25] happy won't be happy
[1:19:26] you go be happy in christ
[1:19:33] genesis 3 2 let's go on the woman said
[1:19:35] to the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[1:19:37] of the trees of the garden so she
[1:19:38] recognizes he misquoted the word she
[1:19:41] should have walked away
[1:19:45] but she says we we may eat of the fruit
[1:19:47] of the trees of the garden
[1:19:49] so it wasn't a lack of knowledge that
[1:19:50] kept that made her fall
[1:19:53] she knew what god said but of the fruit
[1:19:56] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:19:57] garden
[1:19:58] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:20:00] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[1:20:02] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:20:04] shall not surely die
[1:20:07] and the way he puts that is surely god
[1:20:09] didn't mean that
[1:20:12] you shall not surely die
[1:20:16] can it be that god has said
[1:20:19] surely not
[1:20:22] but the brother says not surely that i
[1:20:24] see how he quoted it around
[1:20:26] he said oh we believe the days of
[1:20:28] miracles is fast
[1:20:29] now watch what brother adam takes it to
[1:20:31] the serpent that he comes down
[1:20:32] now in a spiritual realm he comes down
[1:20:34] and he tries to tell us oh we believe
[1:20:36] the days of miracles has passed
[1:20:38] and let me just just drop this in
[1:20:40] because i think it's important but
[1:20:42] we we don't believe in cessationism we
[1:20:44] don't believe
[1:20:45] that the days of miracles is past we
[1:20:48] don't believe the days of
[1:20:49] the fivefold ministry is past whatever
[1:20:52] you want to call the gifts of ephesians
[1:20:54] 4 11
[1:20:55] and we don't believe that the gifts of
[1:20:57] the spirit are past
[1:20:59] because if we believe any of that then
[1:21:00] we cannot believe that jesus christ is
[1:21:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:06] right so that's church of christ
[1:21:07] doctrine you hear that from message
[1:21:09] people they just
[1:21:10] they they're still in dwelt in that
[1:21:12] church of christ doctrine or whatever
[1:21:14] it is it comes from them it didn't come
[1:21:15] from god it didn't come from brother
[1:21:17] branham
[1:21:18] the bible doesn't say that brother brown
[1:21:20] doesn't say it anywhere
[1:21:22] so brother brown says oh we believe the
[1:21:23] days of miracles has passed see how he
[1:21:25] quoted it around
[1:21:26] we don't believe there's such a thing as
[1:21:27] people receiving the holy ghost
[1:21:29] like they did on pentecost he said oh
[1:21:32] anyway you're baptized it doesn't make
[1:21:33] any difference
[1:21:35] see the devil see his tactics say well
[1:21:38] why does it make a difference
[1:21:39] because god said it did he say well
[1:21:43] surely god won't care
[1:21:45] god does care and if you deliberately
[1:21:48] walk over his word he cares
[1:21:52] enough to keep his word so he cares
[1:21:56] aren't you glad he cares about his word
[1:21:58] you see if god
[1:22:00] could let someone go on something like
[1:22:02] that
[1:22:03] if there could be a jot or tittle pass
[1:22:05] away it would mean that the promises
[1:22:07] may not be true
[1:22:10] right if he could let one thing of the
[1:22:12] word pass away without being true
[1:22:14] then it would mean that the promises to
[1:22:16] us are also may not be true
[1:22:20] you realize the confidence we could have
[1:22:22] in him today
[1:22:23] that he keeps every word amen
[1:22:26] well i'm so glad that he does i can't
[1:22:28] keep it you can't keep it but he keeps
[1:22:30] it and i have to say amen to every word
[1:22:35] amen now
[1:22:38] he said oh anyway you're baptized it
[1:22:39] doesn't make any difference see the
[1:22:40] devil sees tactics well if the doctor
[1:22:42] told you you can't get well that settles
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:44] he said now not discrediting
[1:22:45] disbelieving the doctor the doctor is
[1:22:48] working on the line of scientific
[1:22:50] you hear so much today about fall the
[1:22:52] science listen what he's saying the
[1:22:54] doctor is working on the line of
[1:22:55] scientific
[1:22:56] and the doctor has done everything he
[1:22:58] can to save the person's life
[1:22:59] and it can't be saved because there's
[1:23:01] nothing else he knows to do
[1:23:04] he's at the end of his wits the man is
[1:23:06] honest he said but now
[1:23:08] the tree of knowledge is all right he
[1:23:10] said but when you go as far as it'll go
[1:23:13] then step off on the tree of life and
[1:23:15] just keep on going
[1:23:17] brother david you've experienced that
[1:23:18] you know what that's like to walk down
[1:23:20] the tree of knowledge they can do so
[1:23:21] much for you
[1:23:22] but you got to step on the tree of life
[1:23:25] everybody let god take care of the rest
[1:23:27] he can do it
[1:23:28] church you believe that tonight walk as
[1:23:31] far as you can on the tree of knowledge
[1:23:32] and just keep on going on the tree of
[1:23:34] life
[1:23:35] amen he said it'll just work so far
[1:23:40] amen verse 5 says for god does know that
[1:23:43] on the day you eat thereof then your
[1:23:44] eyes shall be open
[1:23:46] you shall be his gods knowing good and
[1:23:48] evil so he says god's hiding something
[1:23:50] from you he's keeping something back
[1:23:53] he hasn't given you everything he hasn't
[1:23:56] told you everything
[1:23:58] but he told them what they needed to
[1:24:00] know to remain in eden
[1:24:05] he said but if god hath known the day
[1:24:07] you eat though of your eyes will be open
[1:24:08] you should be as gods knowing good and
[1:24:10] evil
[1:24:10] what was he doing he was establishing
[1:24:14] himself
[1:24:15] know this is real important so prick
[1:24:17] your conscience for a moment before we
[1:24:18] close
[1:24:19] he was establishing himself
[1:24:22] as the one the only one who could tell
[1:24:25] her what god really meant
[1:24:28] by what he said he's the only one who
[1:24:31] can really tell her
[1:24:33] how many false doctrines have started
[1:24:35] the same way
[1:24:36] because a preacher said i'm the only one
[1:24:39] that can tell you
[1:24:40] there's two ways you can do that you can
[1:24:42] say i'm the only one that can tell you
[1:24:44] you can say everybody else is wrong
[1:24:49] if god is not telling me everything who
[1:24:52] am i going to turn to
[1:24:52] what was he doing he was establishing
[1:24:54] his own ministry
[1:24:56] above the word
[1:25:00] now watch that he was establishing his
[1:25:03] own knowledge in the heart of eve
[1:25:05] to make her want to have this knowledge
[1:25:07] that only he could give
[1:25:09] he said if you'll listen to me you'll be
[1:25:11] like gods they already were
[1:25:16] they already were but he said if you'll
[1:25:18] listen to me you'll be his gods
[1:25:21] now listen brother brown said then if
[1:25:24] eve lusted for knowledge it was sin
[1:25:27] he says when we lust for knowledge we
[1:25:29] want a phd lld it's sin to do so
[1:25:33] he said that's strong statements but
[1:25:34] that's the truth
[1:25:36] no matter how strong it is it's still
[1:25:38] the truth to lust for knowledge
[1:25:40] understanding now remember he's talking
[1:25:41] about the word of god he's not talking
[1:25:43] about learning how to
[1:25:44] how to stitch a a body together as a
[1:25:48] doctor or surgeon or something like that
[1:25:49] he's talking about when it comes to the
[1:25:50] word of god
[1:25:52] to us for knowledge understanding the
[1:25:54] thing of it is
[1:25:55] he said today he said we don't try to
[1:25:58] establish the word of god in the
[1:25:59] people's hearts
[1:26:01] we're trying to establish ourselves
[1:26:04] churches are trying to establish the
[1:26:07] doctrine of the church
[1:26:09] in a person's heart and that's why they
[1:26:12] get so mad when somebody goes to another
[1:26:14] church
[1:26:16] because he's rejected the establishment
[1:26:20] of that but a person doesn't have to go
[1:26:21] to my church
[1:26:23] to have christ established in his heart
[1:26:26] you understand so churches are trying to
[1:26:29] establish the doctrine of the church
[1:26:31] in a person's heart what does the
[1:26:32] catholic church do if you bring it in
[1:26:34] they're going to cost you they got
[1:26:35] ritual they got ceremony
[1:26:36] what is that for they'll even tell you
[1:26:38] the rosary beads all of that it's to
[1:26:39] establish the doctrine of the church and
[1:26:41] the people's heart
[1:26:43] all of these ceremonies all these images
[1:26:45] is to establish the doctrine of the
[1:26:47] church
[1:26:48] now watch he said we are commanded to
[1:26:51] establish
[1:26:52] the word of god
[1:26:56] amen i don't have to have anything else
[1:26:59] here
[1:27:00] to have church no image no pictures no
[1:27:03] piano
[1:27:04] no organ but i have to have the word
[1:27:08] you understand we could do without
[1:27:09] everything else but we
[1:27:11] must have the word
[1:27:15] we are commanded to establish the word
[1:27:17] of god paul said i didn't come to you
[1:27:19] with enticing words of man that your
[1:27:21] faith might rest up in the knowledge of
[1:27:22] man but i come to you in power
[1:27:24] in manifestations of the holy ghost that
[1:27:26] your faith might rest in god he said
[1:27:28] there you are
[1:27:28] what does it do this message didn't come
[1:27:30] as an intellectual theory
[1:27:32] it comes showing us that god was real
[1:27:34] that he was the same yesterday today and
[1:27:36] forever
[1:27:36] do we believe that tonight and he's the
[1:27:38] same on a wednesday night this year's on
[1:27:40] sunday morning
[1:27:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:42] forever in every moment of our
[1:27:44] life and every trial of our life he's
[1:27:46] still the same
[1:27:48] thank you lord amen he can
[1:27:52] we're going back to eden church aren't
[1:27:54] you looking forward to it
[1:27:56] i went through a little time today i was
[1:27:58] driving in my truck and my mind
[1:28:00] flashed back and when i was a 17 or 18
[1:28:02] year old preacher driving to preach
[1:28:04] somewhere
[1:28:05] and i got thinking about how much i
[1:28:06] enjoyed those days but i'd work as much
[1:28:08] as i had to because i wasn't married
[1:28:10] and then i'd go out and preach somewhere
[1:28:12] and i just enjoyed that so much
[1:28:14] and i got to spend so much time in
[1:28:16] prayer and in the word of god i got to
[1:28:17] thinking about that jt and thinking
[1:28:19] about how things have changed
[1:28:20] but i got to think about it i thought i
[1:28:21] still have the same feeling in my heart
[1:28:23] there's still something in my heart that
[1:28:25] burns for god a passion i may not be
[1:28:27] able to say it as quickly as i once did
[1:28:29] or as with as much fervor as i once did
[1:28:31] but i still got the same passion in my
[1:28:33] heart
[1:28:34] and for just a moment i felt like a
[1:28:35] young preacher again let me tell you
[1:28:37] there's a
[1:28:38] there's an end that we're going back to
[1:28:40] there's a place i can't recreate that
[1:28:42] again in my life
[1:28:43] but we have a promise that there's an
[1:28:45] eden there's a paradise that we're going
[1:28:47] back to hey man
[1:28:49] there's a place where there's nothing
[1:28:51] that can hurt or destroy
[1:28:53] no harm a place that will fit just
[1:28:56] exactly
[1:28:58] and be and manifest exactly what we
[1:29:00] should be
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:07] oh don't you love him tonight
[1:29:11] oh he's real church if we could just
[1:29:12] enter in and and
[1:29:14] realize that the goodness of god
[1:29:17] god begins to speak to us and talk to us
[1:29:20] from the word
[1:29:21] oh it means so much listen i said man
[1:29:25] mustn't establish yourself
[1:29:29] read that again man mustn't establish
[1:29:32] yourself
[1:29:34] we find it he said amongst let god do
[1:29:36] something for a person and send him out
[1:29:38] you find every man trying to impersonate
[1:29:40] it see they're trying to establish
[1:29:43] themselves every man says i did this
[1:29:46] me i mind my denomination
[1:29:49] me this establishing themselves he said
[1:29:52] what are we preaching about
[1:29:54] ourselves or the kingdom of god
[1:29:58] god help me today what are we preaching
[1:30:00] about
[1:30:02] i could stand up here and just just tell
[1:30:04] you stories about myself and sometimes i
[1:30:06] do you know you gotta open up a little
[1:30:08] bit to the people
[1:30:09] but the thing i want to establish is not
[1:30:11] what i did
[1:30:13] or what's happened in my ministry but
[1:30:15] it's christ the word
[1:30:19] what are we preaching about ourselves of
[1:30:21] the kingdom of god
[1:30:22] he said establish the word of god take
[1:30:25] out the unbelief and establish
[1:30:27] the kingdom of god in a man's heart and
[1:30:29] the kingdom of god cannot be established
[1:30:31] in a man's heart
[1:30:32] unless god made that man thus in other
[1:30:34] words you can't be an impersonation
[1:30:36] of christianity or an impersonation of
[1:30:37] some other preacher
[1:30:39] god made the man that thus he said and
[1:30:42] remember the deceitful part
[1:30:44] men think that it's right he said
[1:30:46] there's a way that seems right into a
[1:30:47] man every intellectual being
[1:30:49] seems right every intellectual being
[1:30:52] seems right
[1:30:54] he said i told you a few sundays ago
[1:30:56] when i stood by my dying baby
[1:30:58] and satan's standing there and said
[1:31:00] there's your daddy died in your arms the
[1:31:01] other
[1:31:02] night there's your wife laying down on
[1:31:04] the morgue here's your baby going
[1:31:06] and you ask him to answer you and he
[1:31:07] pulled a shade down over you
[1:31:10] he said yet he's a good god and you said
[1:31:11] he was a healer he said
[1:31:13] you who are standing for what she said
[1:31:15] was right you're wrong
[1:31:16] he said oh every reason every mental
[1:31:18] faculty had to agree
[1:31:20] that it was right and he was right that
[1:31:23] much
[1:31:27] he was right that much so was he right
[1:31:29] when he told eve your eyes will be open
[1:31:31] and you'll know right from wrong you'll
[1:31:33] be as gods that way knowing right from
[1:31:35] wrong
[1:31:35] because god didn't let them see
[1:31:36] themselves yet that they were naked
[1:31:38] so they knew they would know right from
[1:31:40] wrong and he was right
[1:31:42] but you see it was contrary to the word
[1:31:44] of god
[1:31:45] so does ministers and seminaries
[1:31:47] learning man-made theology it may seem
[1:31:49] right
[1:31:50] it may be a good understanding of the
[1:31:52] thing but it's wrong
[1:31:54] he said we don't have to understand it
[1:31:56] he didn't say we wouldn't understand it
[1:31:57] but we don't have to
[1:31:59] we believe it because god said it so and
[1:32:02] that settles it forever
[1:32:04] he said the whole thing very bad
[1:32:08] that's the way to believe it
[1:32:12] we can understand things about this
[1:32:14] message we thank god for the
[1:32:15] understanding we have but we believe it
[1:32:17] regardless
[1:32:18] of what we understand genesis 3 6 when
[1:32:22] the woman saw the tree was good for food
[1:32:24] that it was pleasant to the eyes that a
[1:32:26] tree to be desired
[1:32:28] make one wise she took her the fruit
[1:32:29] their oven did eat
[1:32:31] they've all slowed to her husband with
[1:32:32] her and he did eat one by one
[1:32:35] he knocked down every objection that she
[1:32:37] had
[1:32:38] mentally she stood there vulnerable
[1:32:42] to his advances why because she didn't
[1:32:45] stay behind the word
[1:32:49] and the eyes of them both were opened
[1:32:51] and they knew they were naked and they
[1:32:52] sewed fig leaves together and made
[1:32:54] themselves
[1:32:55] aprons and as brother branham like to
[1:32:57] say if an apple did that let's pass the
[1:33:00] apples again
[1:33:05] brother branham said compare this now
[1:33:06] how much alike that man and his wife
[1:33:08] both in god's eating
[1:33:09] that one stitch of clothes on them and
[1:33:10] knew it not why didn't they know it for
[1:33:13] they revealed to their senses of
[1:33:14] nakedness
[1:33:15] by the holy veil of the holy spirit they
[1:33:18] could look right at each other and they
[1:33:20] didn't know that they were naked they
[1:33:21] were veiled with the holy spirit of
[1:33:22] holiness
[1:33:23] they were veiled he said god's veil yet
[1:33:25] today
[1:33:26] can look and not lust now this is
[1:33:29] important
[1:33:30] he said they turn their head how do they
[1:33:33] look and not lust by turning their head
[1:33:36] i had someone tell me from a church
[1:33:38] around here actually one time
[1:33:40] counseled a man that i was dealing with
[1:33:41] who had a problem
[1:33:43] where he had such a a lust spirit on him
[1:33:45] he would go by
[1:33:47] the swimming pool during the day and sit
[1:33:48] there and watch
[1:33:50] been years ago another place another
[1:33:52] time no one that you know
[1:33:54] but someone around in this area had told
[1:33:56] him said well if you get the holy ghost
[1:33:57] you could look at that all day and it
[1:33:58] wouldn't bother you
[1:34:01] listen what he said god's veil today can
[1:34:03] look and not lost they turn their head
[1:34:06] that's how they look and not lust
[1:34:08] because if they look at that long enough
[1:34:10] they'll lust
[1:34:12] right but god's veil will make you turn
[1:34:13] your head
[1:34:15] it's a holy veil see god he said they
[1:34:17] were both one was man and the other one
[1:34:18] was woman
[1:34:19] they did not know they were naked
[1:34:20] because the holiness of god kept their
[1:34:22] eyes
[1:34:22] veiled notice he said god hid their
[1:34:24] conscience from sin
[1:34:26] by the holy fail listen
[1:34:30] my brother ties that to the new birth he
[1:34:32] said wish we had some time to lay on
[1:34:33] that a few minutes
[1:34:35] he said look here for he the worshiper
[1:34:37] once purged
[1:34:38] hebrews the worshiper once purged has no
[1:34:40] more conscience of sin
[1:34:43] sin has passed from him
[1:34:46] amen he said i heard brother neville say
[1:34:48] this morning
[1:34:50] someone might have been asking him why
[1:34:51] didn't i preach on the holy ghost
[1:34:54] why didn't i do this here it is the holy
[1:34:56] ghost is the action in you
[1:35:00] you can say it this way it's what makes
[1:35:02] you tick it's the maidspring
[1:35:06] it's what makes you tick it's the action
[1:35:08] in you
[1:35:10] amen the holy ghost is the action in you
[1:35:13] it's a
[1:35:14] life not an emotion not some sort of
[1:35:17] fleshly evidence
[1:35:19] but it's a person it is a person jesus
[1:35:23] christ
[1:35:24] the word of god established in your
[1:35:27] heart
[1:35:28] to quicken every word of this age
[1:35:32] hallelujah then if god
[1:35:35] said that they'll cast out devils
[1:35:37] they'll speak with new tongues they'll
[1:35:38] drink any deadly thing and won't harm
[1:35:40] them what does that do that's a word for
[1:35:42] this
[1:35:42] age right because that goes all the way
[1:35:44] to the end
[1:35:46] right that's a word for this age then
[1:35:48] we'll do that
[1:35:49] but we'll also fulfill every word for
[1:35:51] our age
[1:35:53] right not just not just that we'll
[1:35:55] fulfill every word for our age why
[1:35:57] because the spirit in us does that
[1:35:59] through us
[1:36:02] he said watch the holy ghost in action
[1:36:04] he said not so much
[1:36:06] in demonstrations but in action what it
[1:36:09] does
[1:36:09] according to the word
[1:36:13] amen amen it's a person
[1:36:16] that does according to the word
[1:36:19] musicians go ahead and come i'm going to
[1:36:20] stop here
[1:36:21] but notice the simplicity of the gospel
[1:36:23] what does it do
[1:36:25] it brings us back to eden again
[1:36:28] how does it do it by establishing the
[1:36:30] person of christ the word
[1:36:32] in the heart of the people
[1:36:37] it tears out every other image every
[1:36:39] other self-created idol
[1:36:42] if god's willing i'm going to talk about
[1:36:43] that sunday morning but every idol that
[1:36:46] man has created every idol you create
[1:36:48] remember man always created idols in his
[1:36:50] own image
[1:36:53] but here it can be torn down and every
[1:36:56] stronghold that everything that exalts
[1:36:58] itself against the knowledge of christ
[1:37:00] by the simplicity of the gospel is torn
[1:37:02] down is cast down
[1:37:04] every stronghold of the enemy every
[1:37:06] complex to bring us back to eden again
[1:37:09] by establishing the person of christ the
[1:37:11] word of the heart of the people
[1:37:13] you see this bride will not fall satan
[1:37:16] will not get to her
[1:37:17] to make her fall but christ the word has
[1:37:20] already come
[1:37:22] but you see the importance of the
[1:37:23] opening of the word it makes you sealed
[1:37:25] away you're not waiting on another
[1:37:26] prophet to come
[1:37:27] you're not waiting on something else to
[1:37:29] happen you've been sealed away
[1:37:31] hey man you can't fall like the other
[1:37:33] ages did why
[1:37:35] because there's something inside of you
