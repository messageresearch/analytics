Lord we believe you're gonna you're already here but Lord we believe you're going to do something special here tonight Lord we're not deserving of anything Lord we know that you said whatsoever things we would ask in prayer believing we would receive them and tonight Lord we believe that that you're going to come and give a special touch to us Lord You're Going to heal the sick and The Afflicted you're going to raise up those Lord that maybe would be backslidden in the back slim condition tonight Lord whatever the case is whatever it's not too hard for you Lord we thank you for it tonight we ask Lord you would just move among the people and give us Lord the ears to hear Lord help me to move out of the way Lord to speak something Lord that would be a value to the people tonight Lord oh God I pray you just come in a special way now we ask in Jesus name amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight it's good to see the half of you that were gone back now if we just get the ones that were here back we'd be all right and well it's good that's okay you can laugh it's all right I had to lighten the mood just a little bit hey man it's good to be in church I tell you what I think there's no better place to be on a Wednesday night than in the house of the Lord if you do have your Bibles just before you're seated let's turn over to John chapter 11. and verse 17. it's a very familiar story so I may skip a verse every now and again brother Robert and I'll try not to hold you too long tonight amen you love the Lord in John chapter 11 verse 17. then when Jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave four days talking about Lazarus here he said now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she had heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sits still in the house and we'll go down just a little bit farther and G and the level dude verse 23 Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever believeth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this I wonder if we could say Amen to that we're Believers here tonight aren't we amen you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word and just another portion of reading just before we go any farther here in the 32nd verse of the same chapter uh we'll go on down on that Story of Lazarus I think when you see this story here you'll understand where I'm going and you'll see that the power that God had was shown in Jesus here at the grave of Lazarus and when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died and when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him and they said unto him Lord come and see and Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto them Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead for four days and Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldst believe thou should see the glory of God Can We Believe here tonight I believe we can see the glory of God he said then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and he knew and I knew that thou Hearst me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead come forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go I want you to think about that for just a little bit now how many can we can type this in so many different ways but the way I would like to take it tonight is Jesus right here at the grave of Lazarus is showing us that he had a human element he could stand there at the grave of Lazarus and he could weep he could he could groan and he could moan he could be sad for his friend it was a good friend of Jesus Lazarus was and so he could stand there at the grave and as a human he could feel what we would feel in a time of death he could feel what it would be like to lose a close friend or to lose someone that uh that you would love and maybe maybe he knew all he had to know how this would feel in order to intercede for us but he went on and and I love it here because brother Brandon would actually tell a story about Lazarus and there was a woman that had come to him and the woman had told him that he couldn't be divine you remember the story she said brother Branham she was saying Jesus she said the only problem I have is you make too much out of Jesus and he said well I hope that's the only problem I've got and he said and she said well you make him Divine and he's not Divine brother Brandon said oh he's he was God or he was the greatest deceiver of the world ever had that's what brother Brandon said about him and so brother Brandon went on down through the story and this woman had said he wasn't Divine and she said she could prove it by by scripture and so she went down and she tried to do it she took him to the verse there that Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus and so that proved that Jesus was not Divine brother Branham said he may have been a man when he stood there at the grave of Lazarus and wept but he said when he pulled them little frail shoulders back he said that was nothing but God himself and I want to tell you tonight you may not see much in a person sitting next to you it may look just like frail flesh but if the spirit of God is in that person if they pull their shoulders back and they speak the word of God then all hell will tremble and all hell will shake at the name of Jesus when the believer utters the name tonight why because the same power that was in Jesus at the grave of Lazarus is the same power that's in you tonight and and what it is it's and we think of being powerful and and how great that would be but really it's an authority because it's something given to us by God it's not just a power that we would have ourselves but it is an authority that would that Jesus would have I'm kind of getting ahead of myself here so brother Brandon would say it like this he said Martha when she went to meet Jesus he said if there was anyone had a right to condemn it would have been Martha because she had sent for Jesus to come pray for her brother when he was in a serious condition dying and Jesus had left the church they had come out of the old dead movement that they were in brother Branham throws that in there and I like that he said it had followed the Lord Jesus believing him to be the anointed Messiah and then his very friend Lazarus that he come up with they had been excommunicated from their church and from their society and his friend that he came up with was laying sick at the point of death and the doctor could do him no good and she sent for Jesus and Jesus simply ignored her sending brother William said she had a right to be upset at that she had a right to be angry that Jesus didn't come and heal her brother because she knew he could remember she had faith and he went to another city and did the same thing there they sent him again sin again and he just ignored it and went on and after Lazarus was dead and had been buried for four days his face had already fell in by that time that hot country that nose falls in he said I'm told and probably his flesh had already fell in because after 72 hours corruption sets in the body and so we find out he was already dead and then after he was dead and it was all over then Here Comes Jesus slipping into the city so then they knowed that he was going to get criticized because perhaps he was already criticized but Martha had been very dilatory seemingly about fixing a place for Jesus to sleep and a place for him to eat and so forth and even asked Jesus one time to make her sister come help but down in her heart Faith struck he said while Mary sat still crying and doing nothing about it and give up Martha slips out of the house down through the city he said no doubt she met some of the streets said where is that Divine healer that you had around here what about Lazarus now she passed right on by them look at them unbelievers coming and trying to tempt her faith she goes right on down and he's he said watch how she was she run up to him she had right to it she had a right to upgrade him he said she had a right to tell him why didn't you come when I called for you that would have been a Pentecostal of today or a Baptist or Presbyterian or I would say a message believer today and they would change churches right quick see why didn't you come when we called you she had a right to semen right to seemingly but she didn't have a right to he said he said as I said last night you have no thought it's his thought see what he does thy will be done pray like this he is not an Aaron boy he is a God he said notice thy kingdom come thy will be done and when he got to him he approached him in the right way and she said give him his right title Lord not a braid him but Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died Oh my he said I can see him pulling his little tired body together he said if you would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you can you see the authority that Christ had because of the spirit of God that was in him he was the fullness of God God and the fullness of God dwelled in him and that gave him this Authority and and he would go on and he said she know God of creation was she note he was the anointed Messiah she approached him right upon her knees and said Lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God will give it to you or if we could only think even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you he said I am the resurrection in life no other man could ever say that I am the resurrection of life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever believeth and believeth in me shall never die brother Rand is quoting the scripture we read there and said yay Lord I believe that you're the son of God that was to come into the world he said where have you buried him and he goes on he said I was talking to the woman and I told you the story about the woman here and she said you brag too much on Jesus and and of course you know when she said that uh she said when he wept and he wasn't Divine because he wept and brother Brandon makes this statement and I kind of like it it's a little funny he said that's thinner than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that's starved to death he said because that won't hold up to the Bible he said look he goes down to the tomb he stood before the tomb and he straightened his little body and said Lazarus come forth he might have been a man crying but when he called that man out of the Grave oh I wonder today if we could just speak the word and watch Miracles take place if we could just maybe pull our shoulders back and pull ourselves together a little bit why cry he said but speak the word and it'll come to pass and he said he said he'd been dead four days his soul four days journey somewhere he said I don't know where he was at neither do you he said he called him back corruption knew it's Master the soul knew its creator he said a man had been dead stood on his feet and lived again after being dead four days that was more than a man that was God he said it was a man when he come down off the mountain that night and was hungry and he looked all over a fig tree to find something to eat he was a man when he was hungry but when he'd taken five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand he said that was more than a man he said he was a man when he was laying out in the back of the boat that night when ten thousand Devils of the sea swore they would drown him and that little old boat in the storm like a bottle stopped stop her out there somewhere floating up and down like that he said he was a man when he was asleep he was tired virtue had went out of him but when he put his foot up on the Braille of the boat and looked up and said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him that was more than a man that was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he said he was a man when he died on the cross crying for Mercy that's right but he said he was God on Easter morning aren't you thankful he said when he broke the seal was in the Tomb rose up and sent it on high said yes sir every ever living to make intercessions every man and woman that ever amounted to a hill of beans believe that that's what he said every man or woman would have to believe that he said yes sir he's the same yesterday and forever and brother Branham asked his congregation this he said believe us thou this and I wonder tonight could I ask you that tonight do you believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God and in him build the fullness of the godhead bodily and I believe tonight that that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is living in the bride body today and it will Quicken us for a Rapture one of these mornings I'll tell you what church I think it's time then we take the gloves off and just go at that devil once in a while tell him who we are we are the Unstoppable force in this world we are the very Body of Christ in this age there's nothing can hold us down when Rapture time comes nothing can keep us here when God calls our name remember the name has always been there he already saw you there he said I know you before the foundation of the world and I'm so thankful for tonight it don't matter what I've done here but God who is rich in Mercy looked down and he sent his son with the blood of Jesus Christ and he looked at him and he he made him die as a man so he could feel the pain and things that we have to feel he could be tempted like a man he could make him like a man and have a headache and have sickness and all these things but then when he died he could raise up and be totally gone and that same spirit that would raise him out of that tomb he said he would send back to the church and he would Quicken us that ought to make somebody shout tonight it's going to Quicken your mortal bodies one of these days nothing can hold us down what was it he said it was God in Christ what is it today Christ in you God in Christ Christ and you and today we can see he said every word of God is a written sworn Authority and that's the word I want to show you tonight is the authority that we have through Christ he said it is a written sworn Authority he said it's the absolute right of the believer to accept this as the infallible truth because it is God's word and he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away he said saith the Lord it must be fulfilled in its season and brother Branham goes on down and I want to ask this question do we have the same authority Jesus had do we have the same Authority he had then we can do the same Works he did and Romans 8 11 he said but it's a spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and if the spirit of Christ is in you you can speak and go forward you don't have to cry any longer you don't have to live in a backslidden condition you can speak to that devil and tell him to get out of your way you can speak to that symptom and it can leave you can speak to whatever the situation is and it will change because of what you said because of what you speak he said he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also he said there you are he said and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass remember this is a third pull hour than what you speak actually matters now because it's Christ in you remember what you say is the very spirit of God speaking you are as the very Oracle of God speaking remember it's not just the preacher it's not it's every one of you it doesn't matter retro position it doesn't matter who you are what your last name is what it is it's Christ in you that makes you all the same it doesn't matter now you may have a position you may have a gift you we've heard about the gifts and the callings and things in your life that's that's wonderful but when it comes to Salvation when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're all the same and he said but believe in your heart you can have what you've said he said glory to God it's my God revealing himself in humility amen God taking a humble Sinner and cleansing him by his blood dropping that confessed sin remember confess sin into that Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of God and putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said then if we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us when the type listen to this when Elijah dropped the robe for Elisha he got a double portion of it Jesus said the works that I do you shall do also and greater shall you do for I go unto my father he said what's wrong church he said you've called us a bills above of visions and things like that he said get off my back brother get down to the Cross get to the gospel he said we don't have to impersonate why would you take an impersonation why would you take some false conception of it when the skies are full of the genuine he said Pentecostal power that makes a man or woman or a son of God he said takes him back to the prayer presence of God he said there you are God revealing himself in humility he's not going to use the the big names maybe to confound the wise but he's going to use the simple people he's going to use somebody to maybe not know how to speak their words either just like me and he don't know how to put their words together and you don't know how to maybe speak as eloquently as some would but listen God can use anybody God can use anybody he wants to use and when he puts his spirit in you he didn't ask you if you knew your ABCs or you knew how to read and write but he asked you if you'd be willing to be a vessel that he could use for his glory and that's who God's going to use tonight he said it's the same Pentecostal power that makes a man or woman a daughter of God he said you've got to get away from your own thoughts you've got to let the mind that was in Christ be in you you've got to stay there till every sin of fear every sin of Doubt is gone from your heart he said if you're there and God doesn't take you and omit your sins and send you into the presence of God he said there is something wrong with your experience he said I don't care how many degrees of doctor you have or how big your church you've got he said what kind of a big will you belong to he said how many organizations whatever it is has nothing to do with it until your sins are confessed and in the blood of Jesus Christ he said you stand an adulterated a born-again son and daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it'll mind you he said God revealing himself in humility I love how he keeps going back to that God revealing himself in in humility in Simplicity God and hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same he said and he picks them up just kind of believed like that he said I think the father creator of heavens and earth thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent aren't you thankful for that tonight you don't have to be wise you don't have to have a degree to understand the scriptures to be one of God's own children he said and he goes on and that's in God hiding himself in Simplicity 1963 if you go listen to that it's just a wonderful uh brother Brandon goes over and over about how God is hiding himself in in human flesh and hiding himself behind the veil and so forth like that is something we need to understand today church that God can actually come down and be in a flesh body today and do the same works that he did while he was here on Earth he can still raise the dead like he did in Lazarus he can still go and speak to a mountain and move it out of the way if need be God is still God and he's never going to change The Authority we have is what the word says anything you say that is in the word is the saith the Lord can I say it like that everything that God has already said you can say that's thus saith the Lord now we don't throw thus saith the Lord around because that's not our place but if it's in the word you can say it's what the word says it's what God said it's what the Lord said and so the authority we have is to speak whatever the word promises and it will be so and so our Authority comes from the very Spirit of Christ think it's the same spirit so we have the same Authority the same Authority are you with me I see I pulled a bin and so it's not so much our power brother Branham says this but the authority and brother Braham tells a story he said uh for instance here comes a little policeman out there on the highway he's so little until his cat pulls his ears down and he won't weigh over about a hundred pounds and he said now how much power has he got to stop one of them cars he said some of them just three or four he said just as hard as they can pour down that Highway at 300 horsepower each he said and he couldn't even stop one horsepower he said and there these cars are but let that big bad shine and he said let him raise up that hand and he might not have the power but he's got Authority he said listen at the brake squeak when run sideways and everybody stop why because he's got Authority he said I don't have any power you don't have any power but we have got Authority he said the badge of Faith hanging on the word he said I believe it it's the truth that's what stops when you can be persistent he said little policeman stand up there and blow that little whistle and hold his hand up he said I'll tell you everything is going to stop because it's his authority so it's not just your power you could be powerless even and still have full authority over the devil you can still have full Authority because what it is what is it God has put a badge on you and said you're mine and you can speak to this mountain he gave you Authority when you joined the academy and he put you through all kinds of training and all kinds of different things that you had to go through to learn on the job and he gets you set in a position then he puts you in a uniform gives you your badge gives you a weapon gives you Shield or think about a church he gives you everything you have need of to defeat the Devil and then when he did that he the devil looked at you and thought you're nothing but what you were you're still the same old sinner that you was but remember now you've changed because what you were was a powerless human being but now you are a son of God with full Authority from God it is something that God has done for you it is just like that little policeman you may not look like much you may not weigh much you may not be able to stop traffic you may not be able to stop cancer from coming but you can absolutely cast that demon out from your body you say how can I do it it's got to be Christ that does it yes his Spirit dwelleth In You brother Branham goes on he talks about sister Hattie Wright many of you know this about sister hattian he said little sister quiet sister Hattie he called her sitting back there a little dust bonded on like the country women wear he said she'd put on a clean little dress to come over to help her mother cook me a dinner and she was sitting with her hand like this she said that's nothing but the truth she responded to something brother Branham said and she said the right thing he said here's my Bible and as a servant of God I say this I could hardly hear the last things she said her mother was trying to say something but I didn't get it just as she said that that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing the spirit of the Lord said to me tell her to ask what she will and you give it to her now remember she had to say something she had to speak this was the third poll In Action For the First Time by the way he said tell her to ask what she will and you'll give it to her he said I couldn't speak that room everybody felt strange he said I said sister Hattie she said yes brother Brandon I said thus saith the Lord speak anything you desire I don't care what it is if you want to know what God's give this ministry speak anything that you desire thus saith the Lord if you'll speak it it'll speak it behind you and you'll have it right there he said eight people standing there looking she said brother Branham what shall I say he said I said it's up to you and there said her crippled sister her old father she was poor she could have asked for money she could have asked for anything she wanted to I said ask anything that's in your heart anything that you want and thus saith the Lord I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it and she said the salvation of my two boys you know the story I said you have it in the name of the Lord and those two little modern teenage nickel Fritz boys brother random calls them that hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and began to scream the blessings of God there's your quote if you're against screaming this was a supernatural power they grabbed themselves then begin to scream the blessings of God the power of God brother Branham calls it in the room struck that place he said brother Banks fell into his plate he said I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes he said friend do you realize what that was he said I have never in all my life had felt such an anointing he said the first time it was ever performed on a human being it bypassed the aristocrats it bypassed everything else and went to a poor little widow woman living up on the hill there and God knowed what she'd asked for her two boys was gloriously saved that very minute it was spoken if she would have asked for ten thousand dollars it would have been given to her if she'd have asked for her sister's healing it would have been given to her anything she would have asked it would have been given to her think about it God knew what she would ask for now that was Sister Hattie and that was the first time brother Bram said it was used on a human in that way now what about now we have the same promise we had the same God the same spirit why do we sit here sometimes I wonder why do we have to sit back like like we're defeated when there's no reason for that because the same God that raised Lazarus from the dead came and showed himself alive in our generation and that same God did not leave with the prophet but he would come again and prove himself to us in The Bride of Jesus Christ remember it's not just brother Branham that had the gift of discernment now let's let me stop there but the discernment is that every one of you you can discern spirits now we don't use it in the way brother Branham did according to brother Branham he said that would be one time when you could turn your back and discern the thoughts of the people one time to to a generation one time to a people one time doing age sorry one time to an age that would only happen like that but you have the same God in you know brother Brahm said you can tell who has the Holy Ghost if you're around him if you're a Holy Ghost Field Christian you can tell those who have it so you do have a certain amount of discernment in you that's part of it but the same spirit that was in Christ if it's in you and if we could show that it was the same spirit that was in brother Branham we'll just say it like that the same Spirit was in Christ Same Spirit was in brother Branham why would it stop there when brother Brandon was very message we should show you that he would never leave until the very end so we have the same Authority that the prophet had because remember it wasn't him that spoke to Sister Hattie it was Sister Hattie this spoke he said whatever you say you say to this mountain you say to this demon of sickness you say that your family's gone look they're coming back whatever you say it's the voice of God in the bride in the last day he said you will be the final voice to the final age I wonder if we could really grasp that thought tonight it's not just back in the prophet yes it was in a prophet yes it was in a man named Jesus yes it was in maybe the apostles too but listen it's in you tonight the very same God it's in you the very same God he never changes and he never will but he's always been the same God I wonder if we could just realize that tonight and we could lay aside all of our doubts and our fears and our Demons of Oppression and depression and we could realize that the very same God that has brought us to this place today is going to carry us all the way to the end of time because he's never left you he's never going to leave you he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and this is not the end yet church it's close but it's not yet so he's still in you he's still with you he's still here today he's still here tonight I believe it do you I believe he's here he said and brother Brian goes on and he said now this is God's word this is the first always and any religious Doctrine he said that's not based upon the word of God through the entire word of God he said I'm afraid of it you can make the word say anything by twisting it around but it must be proven to be the truth and he said now it must be proven the truth and now he said I come if I come and told you I could heal you I'll be doing something contrary to the word for the word doesn't teach it that way he said I can't do something Jesus has already done he healed you when he died for you that scripture he was wounded for your transgressions by his stripes you were healed he said and Moses had the brass serpent lifted it up in the wilderness and so forth brother man goes on here he said the children had murmured against God and against Moses and serpents had bitten them so it healed their sick and forgave their sin and he said just as the brass serpent was lifted up so must the son of man be lifted up for the same cause he said there you are so what has he done he said I cannot do it no one else but now if you can appropriate your faith have faith to believe that he has did this it's for you individually you then the healing will be there it will not fail it will not fail the healing will be there if you believe it for you individually he said he said these pastors here throughout the country's wonderful men of God anointed of God they have just as much right to pray for the sick as I do or anyone else he said not only the pastor but every member of the church has a right to pray for the sick the gift of healing works in the church the entire church not only in the Pastor said confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much he said I believe him so I want you to see here tonight and I won't I won't hold you along but I want you to see really see that the authority that Christ had at the grave of Lazarus was the same thing brother Branham showed throughout his entire Ministry but we can't leave it there well we're doing the same thing in a dominational system did they would take so much of the word and leave off some of it and they would take a portion here and leave off some other but we have to take the entirety of the word and the full word in this day will give you full Authority for this hour and that's what we must come into in this day it's not just the emotion I believe that I believe the word of God will Quicken you I believe that God will cause an emotion in your life I do believe that but it's not about how you feel it's not about the emotion that you show it's not about how how much you dance or how much you shout although those things are good and I enjoy it but what it is it's the word of God being made manifest in your life it is a living epistle read of all men remember church I don't care if you feel really bad in the morning when you wake up you are still an heir of everything that God's got you still have every promise of God right there at your fingertips why because you are a son or a daughter of God and nothing can binds you nothing can hold you back I love it I'll tell you I believe if we could just really get on fire for God and and just look into the word and and you start to study it and you see the promises I believe the promises of God will just cause such a stir in your life that it will you can't help but get a little emotional about it sometimes it'll make tears run down your face when you think of what he did for you Calvary it'll make you shout a little bit when you realize that God himself came down on a human flesh and he got sick and he'd have a headache sometimes just so he would know how you feel just so he would know that one's got a headache it's nothing too little for God he would go to interceding for you and then he would send his Spirit to you and then the spirit in you you can look at somebody else you can look at your brother you can look at your sister and you can intercede for them why because it's the same spirit that Christ had it doesn't make me God it doesn't make you God but what it does it's the spirit of God that has been given to you in this day I believe that's what we need in the body tonight it'll take away all this dryness that comes upon us and backbiting and and all these things where you're trying to you're trying to trying to put out the spirit of God in the church and you're trying to to bring yourselves back to a maybe uh Lord help me here you're trying to take yourself back to something maybe in Pentecost but what we have now is the fullness of the word what we have now is everything you have need up for a Rapture that should make us the happiest people in the world because what they had at Pentecost was good but what they had at Pentecost wasn't material for a Rapture because Elijah had not yet come but now Elijah has come and proved that what Jesus did he could do and what he did the bride will do the same works remember when brother Brandon was taking a type there when Elijah went up and he left the mantle he said a double portion is on the bride I'll tell you what that's strong but that's good he and and brother Branham goes on down here and he said when any believer comes to God he becomes God's attribute of his word he is used to manifest the word that's promised for that day see that's right God rich and mercy has never left us without a testimony he is rich in Mercy he said he said now remember in Christ we are the Flesh of his flesh bone of his bone when God was wounded at Christ when when God wounded Christ at Calvary he was wounded for me and you we are the Flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone body of his body name of his name bride of him he said he said we are in him we are his Flesh and Bones the very Body of Christ we are the Flesh and Bone Body of Christ on Earth today we are the only literal Body of Christ that there is on this Earth and I do believe in a literal coming of Christ I do brother Bram said every believer believes that but what we have now brother Graham said he would send his body he would send his spirit in and make up a collective body made up of many members and we are part of that body I believe that I hope you do too I I know I am I'm by faith I am one of his I believe every one of us should have that testimony he said he would never leave the Earth without a testimony so if I'm the last one or if you're the last one we should all think that way if nobody else but me that I want to be that one but I don't believe that everybody else is not going to make it I don't believe God is that small I believe God is is big enough to to take care of us you know you think about those we think about the small minority group and we think well maybe it's only one or two here one or two out of the another it could be that way but you know even if he took everybody in here it'd be a small minority group little minority group so let's not limit the powers of God whatever you have need of you can ask God and he'll give it to you because whatever you speak it says the Oracles of God speaking Jesus would go or brother going down here and he said God has already raised us up potentially the quickening power that raises from the life of sin changed our being it has potentially raised up Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in the full maturity he said now remember we died and our own name was buried raised in his he said see we're no more of our own of which that great name of Jesus Christ he said the Bible said over here in Ephesians 1 21 both the families in Heaven and Earth is named after that name that's where God put his name that's the family's name in heaven that's the family's name on Earth and we're in Jesus Christ by spiritual baptism not by water but by Spirit we are baptized into one body which is Christ he said the worshiping place then being in there we are being on this ground it's like the abstract deed he said you say I bought a piece of ground and he said is it it isn't yours until you got an abstract but if you've got an abstract it shows that everything that was ever against that piece of ground has been stricken off of it hey man everything that was against you Christ took and made a clean slate for you he said and then when you become a Christian accept Christ as your savior God sends down the abstract and it shows that no matter what your father did no matter what your mother did what anybody else did aren't you thankful for that he said your Daddy might have been drunkards your mother prostitutes whatever it was every sin is stricken off when you receive the spirit of Christ hey man you've got an abstract title there's nothing can you put it he said nothing can put you off of it and he said everything that's on that ground belongs to you he said when you're in Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God belongs in the church he said it amen it's an abstract title deed of course we've been going through those on Wednesday nights with our pastor we know they must be in order but every gift can be in this excuse me in this body he said in Oh my he said think of it he said if this it's an abstract title deed if it's in you it's yours he said it belongs to you it quickens your mortal bodies he said Oh my he said when you are saved God gives you your faith your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith in that act that God has did in you to make you a son of God he said you quit your line you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because of your faith raises you up above it he said if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith you are saved and through Grace as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have he said because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth think about that in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth he said God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God there you are but it's your faith Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you if thou can'tst believe all things are possible he said verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you have said then what kind of people are we to be he said he said having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in us the smitten rock that never leaves the church he said I Am With You Always even to the end of the world the ever presence of the great gesture of Salvation and power that poured forth from Calvary and into the church the ever presence of the Living God the great flowing smitten rock that goes with us in our journey hey man I love that right there The Authority that was in Christ The Authority that was in Christ was in God put in Christ and he could raise the Dead but he made a simple statement that the works that I do you can do also and it came in a prophet and he showed you that Jesus was alive you know I feel like it ought to be easier for a message person to believe that Christ is alive than anybody else because we could actually see a man that God used do the same works that Jesus did so he proved it he proved what he said he didn't just come out and say well I can go out here and cast out devils and I can heal the sick but he proved it and he did it he showed you with the Messiah sign to get the attention of the people and he goes on but then when the third poll came it wasn't just in the prophet at that point he said then it's whatever you speak oh I love that whatever you said that's when the I believe this is the hour for the third poll to be manifesting the bride because he said it's here some people are still waiting for but Church you don't realize how blessed you are to know that it is here among you now Christ is alive right here tonight and anything that you want anything you need in your life can happen right now the sick that are laying in the hospital can be raised up right now tonight at the very sound of your voice at the very thing whatever you say sick can be raised and the dead can come up cripples can stand up out of their wheelchairs because it's not just a god of history but it is a god of now he said it's an ever-present gusher from the water of The Rock and I believe it's right here among us tonight church I don't think it's time to go back into denomination and say well I I think it's I think the message could have been wrong here I'll tell you what get out of the seat of the critics tonight move out of the seat of the skeptical tonight and just remember that whatever God said God did and whatever God said he would do today he's still doing today do you believe it tonight I believe God is here among us tonight to do something for you you say your family's backslid and gone well just go ahead and speak it tonight tonight can be the night that you say they're coming back I've said that about every time I preach recently but I believe there's somebody here needs to hear it somebody needs to hear it when your family looks like they're gone don't give up on them when it looks like that the sickness is about to overtake you I think of sister Fritz tonight she's laying there in the hospital with congestive heart failure I tell you God is still God and it doesn't matter what the doctor said God can still raise up the sick today not only can he but he will if you speak it and go forward speak to that mountain of sickness tonight speak to your family and say you're coming back oh you say well well brother Joel you don't know the situation you don't know how bad it's gotten in the home you don't know how bad the marriage is or you don't know I don't care how bad it is God already knew what position you would be in and he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you but he said I will be with you listen church when you realize how comforting that is that he's never left you brother Brandon said he's as close as your right arm musicians come my time is up he's as close as your right arm he's always there he's ever present to make intercession for you all you have to do speak all you have to do speak it's so simple speak to your situation tonight I wonder if there's somebody in here that's got something going on there's just a few of you here but if there's something in your life that that is bothering you and it's worrying you maybe there's depression or maybe there's sickness or something in your body I wonder if you could stand and and just just to make a statement to the devil tonight that nothing's going to keep me down because I'm going to speak to my mountain tonight I'm going to speak to my situation tonight I'm going to speak to that storm because when Jesus stood up and spoke peace be still the winds and the waves obeyed him and you can speak with the same Authority tonight I wonder if you could bow your heads with me as we stand if there's one here tonight that needs prayer the altar is open but I believe if you could just put your hand to him tonight and say Lord I believe that whatever I have need of is right here for me to take control of tonight I can take a hold of it every promise is here every promise in the book is yours it was given to you not just to not just to read out of a book as as something of a god of History but it's a god of now it's a God that can still move in these services tonight think about him tonight think about what he did for you think about where you were where he brought you to oh he's a great big wonderful God Can You Reach Out And Touch him tonight say Lord I have a need in my life and I'm speaking tonight with full Authority and faith that whatever I speak is going to come to pass this is your time tonight to speak just speak to the storm speak to the sickness speak to whatever you have need of tonight whatever you say can happen right now Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he goes by oh Reach Out and touch the Lord Can You Reach Out And Touch him as he goes by oh you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's Cry he's passing by this moment your needs to supply just Reach Out and touch the Lord as he goals can you sing it with faith now Reach Out touch the Lord oh can you do it now as he goes by or you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's Cry of his past by this moment [Music] to fly just Reach Out and touch the Lord as he goes by if they could play that softly for just a moment I wonder if we could just do something now as a church I wonder if you could put your hands over on someone husband wife brother sister got the order if he would just I wonder if we couldn't just intercede for one another tonight I wonder if you could just use your faith maybe there's someone that's got a little bit of a weakness in their faith maybe they just need something tonight maybe they just need an uplifting prayer of faith from one of God's children tonight and if you believe with all your hearts I believe this is the time when the sickness can be cast out from among you and I wonder if you would just pray in your own special way tonight this was on my heart when I come out to have us pray together and and I thought Lord if somebody could put your hands if you knew that somebody was putting their hands on you and that was just like Jesus himself laying hands on you how much Faith would it create in this church here tonight and it's just the same as if Christ himself was standing there with his hands on you because the spirit is in that person oh I wonder if we could reach out and tell him as we're praying for one another Lord I know you won't pass me by tonight Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever you've never failed me in my life I failed you Lord but you never left me alone you've always been there for me oh God I pray you just come upon these people tonight Lord if there's a sickness in their body Lord if there's a disease that's trying to take them over Lord oh God any Spirit of sickness or doubt or fear anything that would try to make them doubt the word of God lord may it just come in a special way Lord your spirit come in Lord and just move out the spirits of Darkness Lord among us tonight oh God may we be free to worship Lord may we be free Lord in the spirit of God tonight I pray Lord that it would just move across the building now Lord Lord refill every one with the Holy Ghost that would need it Lord oh God I pray would move upon the young people here tonight Lord may you just move in such a way that thorn everything all the cares of the world would just fall off of them now Lord Jesus Lord we're asking for Revival in each one of our Lives tonight Lord make us sweep before
