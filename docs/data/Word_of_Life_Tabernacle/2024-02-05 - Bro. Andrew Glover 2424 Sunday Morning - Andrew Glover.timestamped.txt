[1:04:39] the 22nd verse he that hath an ear let
[1:04:43] him hear what the spirit is saying unto
[1:04:46] the churches now I love how brother B
[1:04:48] said that he that has an ear he said
[1:04:50] that's the individual not the whole
[1:04:52] group the individual that's the bride
[1:04:55] coming out you see the church so he the

[1:05:36] now here I am standing just yielding
[1:05:38] myself and The Holy Spirits moving and
[1:05:41] this is what you call Heavenly places in
[1:05:44] Christ Jesus I I believe we've
[1:05:46] experienced that here this weekend amen
[1:05:48] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said
[1:05:51] but remember that Satan is always
[1:05:53] skeptic at the sons of God Amen Satan is
[1:05:57] always skeptic at the sons of God you
[1:05:59] know he always does that someone with a
[1:06:03] skeptic idea he said and when they do
[1:06:05] that he's just trying to interfere amen
[1:06:08] but this is where I want to draw my
[1:06:09] thought from but Christians always
[1:06:12] overcome amen Christians always overcome
[1:06:16] again how can I overcome brother B said
[1:06:18] remember amen that Christ has spoke of
[1:06:21] an elected people amen for for the last
[1:06:25] day amen not brother brandham spoke of
[1:06:27] them or Paul or anybody else but Christ
[1:06:30] himself has spoke of an elected people
[1:06:33] for the last day again how can I
[1:06:35] overcome paragraph 51 he said now we see
[1:06:38] the hours that we're in in this stage
[1:06:41] and we see what it is and the Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] is rebuking the AIDS that put him out
[1:06:46] but in all that did you notice still he
[1:06:48] said amen to him that overcometh now
[1:06:52] even in this worldly Wicked Church age
[1:06:55] amen he that overcometh now here's a
[1:06:58] prophet amen saying that leot ofan is a
[1:07:01] worldly age it's a wicked Church age
[1:07:03] amen but there's going to be some
[1:07:06] Overcomers amen that are going to come
[1:07:08] out of that age now he said we find here
[1:07:10] that God has always had Overcomers amen
[1:07:14] he's had Overcomers in every age there's
[1:07:17] always every time in every age there's
[1:07:20] been on the earth God has always had
[1:07:22] somebody he can put his hand on as a
[1:07:25] witness in the earth he's never been
[1:07:28] without a witness amen though sometimes
[1:07:31] it came down to just one amen but
[1:07:34] somebody overcame amen like the Saints
[1:07:37] of old amen now if there was Overcomers
[1:07:39] in the Old Testament amen there will be
[1:07:42] Overcomers in the New Testament if there
[1:07:44] were Overcomers in the first church age
[1:07:47] amen there will be Overcomers in the
[1:07:48] last Church age I I love the prayers of
[1:07:51] a prophet do you ever just sit down and
[1:07:52] listen to a tape amen and here brother
[1:07:54] brandom pray do you realize sometimes
[1:07:56] brother brand said more in a prayer on
[1:07:59] Amen than some preachers in that day
[1:08:01] said two hours amen amen and in this
[1:08:03] prayer he said I pray father that you'll
[1:08:06] let every one of us be Overcomers
[1:08:08] tonight amen I pray father you'll let
[1:08:11] every one of us be Overcomers tonight
[1:08:13] amen Overcomers of unbelief Overcomers
[1:08:17] of anything within ourself that we might
[1:08:20] overcome ourselves amen that Christ
[1:08:23] might live in us amen now I'll say it to
[1:08:25] you like this sometimes amen the
[1:08:27] greatest thing you're going to overcome
[1:08:30] is yourself you're going to overcome
[1:08:32] your ideas you're going to overcome your
[1:08:34] insecurities you got to overcome the way
[1:08:37] you think things ought to be amen you
[1:08:39] got to overcome the way somebody thought
[1:08:41] about you said about you looked at you
[1:08:43] Amen in order to be an overcomer amen
[1:08:46] you've got to overcome yourself in order
[1:08:49] that Christ who is already overcome amen
[1:08:52] might dwell in you and overcome through
[1:08:54] you now amen I love numbers 13:30 amen
[1:08:58] because it speaking of my type amen
[1:09:00] Joshua was a type of the end time leader
[1:09:03] amen but Caleb was a type of the people
[1:09:06] who followed Joshua and numbers 13:30
[1:09:09] the Bible said that Caleb stealed the
[1:09:11] people before Moses and he said let us
[1:09:13] go up at once amen and possess it amen
[1:09:17] for we might be able to overcome it amen
[1:09:20] there's a possibility amen we can
[1:09:22] overcome it amen know the Bible said for
[1:09:25] we are well able to overcome it amen I
[1:09:29] say this morning let Caleb's profession
[1:09:31] amen become our profession amen that we

[1:10:51] 50 years and the devil has tried to
[1:10:54] convince you amen that you're not an
[1:10:56] overcomer amen but can I say this after
[1:10:59] everything you've been through after
[1:11:01] everything you've seen after everything
[1:11:03] you've heard amen you're still believing
[1:11:06] that God has G you an inheritance in the
[1:11:08] Rapture and you are enduring every day
[1:11:12] and you are overcoming because his
[1:11:14] strength has become your strength amen

[1:11:22] and little by little by little you're
[1:11:25] overcoming and possessing the land amen
[1:11:28] I love what the Bible says in 1 John
[1:11:31] 2:13 amen he said I write unto you
[1:11:33] fathers amen because you have known him
[1:11:36] amen that is from the beginning amen
[1:11:39] somebody say the beginning he have known
[1:11:41] him that is from the beginning now watch
[1:11:43] what John says he says I Rite unto you
[1:11:46] young men amen because you have overcome
[1:11:50] amen the wicked one amen I ride unto you
[1:11:53] little children because you have known
[1:11:55] the father what I love about this
[1:11:57] brother Joel is he's not putting this in
[1:11:59] the future he's not putting this that
[1:12:02] someday you're going to meet the father
[1:12:04] and overcome someday amen you're going
[1:12:07] to have strength to overcome but he's
[1:12:09] saying the same thing amen that Jesus
[1:12:11] said in John 16 he said I have overcome
[1:12:15] and here John saying Amen to the ones
[1:12:18] I'm writing to amen you're not going to
[1:12:21] overcome you have already overcome then
[1:12:24] what you're doing is you are enduring as
[1:12:26] a good soldier amen and you're
[1:12:28] overcoming in the greatest battle that
[1:12:30] has ever been fought in verse 14 he said
[1:12:33] I have written unto you fathers because
[1:12:35] you have known him that is from the
[1:12:37] beginning I have written unto you young
[1:12:40] men amen because you are strong amen can
[1:12:43] I preach to you young men amen you are
[1:12:45] strong amen and here's where you're
[1:12:47] strength is coming from amen the word of
[1:12:50] God abideth in you and you have overcome
[1:12:54] the wicked
[1:12:55] one so the word that's abiding in you is
[1:12:59] anointing you to overcome the wicked one
[1:13:02] in the age you're living in I'll tell
[1:13:04] you what a prophet said he said faith is
[1:13:06] a conqueror he said faith is an
[1:13:09] overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it
[1:13:12] overcomes amen faith is the victory that
[1:13:15] overcomes the world he said what does it
[1:13:17] do what is Faith what is the Conqueror
[1:13:20] he said to conquer and victory is the
[1:13:22] same he said to conquer it means to beat
[1:13:26] down to override to handcuff and to
[1:13:29] throw into prison amen when you conquer
[1:13:32] something you beat it down you override
[1:13:35] it you handcuff it and you throw it into
[1:13:38] prison amen overcome means the sin that
[1:13:42] once ruled you amen you now rule it it
[1:13:46] means that you have overcome it you have
[1:13:48] whipped it and you are greater than it
[1:13:51] is oh Church of the Living God I think
[1:13:53] it's time to rise up amen as the Sons
[1:13:56] and Daughters of God I think it's time
[1:13:58] to beat the devil down I think it's time
[1:14:01] to override the devil I think it's time
[1:14:03] to handcuff the devil and I think it's
[1:14:06] time to put that devil in the prison
[1:14:08] amen that he put you
[1:14:10] in now you all know I'm telling the
[1:14:13] truth sometime or another you got to
[1:14:15] realize that you're greater than sin
[1:14:18] sometime or another you got to realize
[1:14:21] amen that you're greater than leosia
[1:14:23] sometime or another you got to realize
[1:14:25] amen that you are greater than the
[1:14:27] besetting sins you are greater than the
[1:14:30] habits you are greater than the
[1:14:31] Antichrist you are greater than the
[1:14:33] wickedness come on Church sometime or
[1:14:35] another you got to rise up and recognize
[1:14:38] Who You Are by the authority of the word
[1:14:41] of God that has come in this age and
[1:14:44] recognize the devil and overcome that
[1:14:48] devil I'll just tell you what the
[1:14:49] prophet said he said more people's
[1:14:51] worried about what you over or or or
[1:14:53] what to overcome he said now watch what
[1:14:56] are we to overcome that is the normal
[1:14:58] question here but what is the actual
[1:15:00] fault of the verse in Revelation three
[1:15:02] it is not so much what we are to
[1:15:04] overcome amen but how we are to overcome
[1:15:08] amen can we can we change those two
[1:15:10] words amen not so much what but
[1:15:13] how because what happens is we get so
[1:15:16] focused on what that we miss how to
[1:15:19] overcome what we're trying to overcome
[1:15:22] he said see now this is is The Logical
[1:15:24] for it doesn't matter what we are to
[1:15:26] overcome as long as we know how we can
[1:15:29] overcome in other words once you get it
[1:15:31] figured out of how to overcome something
[1:15:35] it don't matter what it is if you know
[1:15:37] how to overcome it you can overcome it
[1:15:39] anywhere anytime any place under any
[1:15:43] condition and Church of the Living God
[1:15:45] we have been well equipped by the
[1:15:47] message of the hour to overcome the
[1:15:50] devil anywhere any place anytime under
[1:15:54] any condition amen I say like a prophet
[1:15:56] said how can I overcome he said I chose
[1:16:00] this because I think it's a time that we
[1:16:02] should never let the spirit of Revival
[1:16:05] die amen we've got to keep in Revival
[1:16:08] amen constantly revived every day for
[1:16:11] Paul said I died daily that Christ amen
[1:16:16] could live amen and we must never let
[1:16:18] the spirit of Revival die within us
[1:16:22] another place said I begin to think of
[1:16:24] this text amen and overcome means to
[1:16:27] keep life in you when the life went out
[1:16:30] he said that's what brought the log in
[1:16:32] that condition now you all are familiar
[1:16:34] with that tape how I can overcome he
[1:16:36] talked about going down there and there
[1:16:38] was a log and he said brother Bill he
[1:16:40] said he stepped on that log he said when
[1:16:43] I stepped on it fell apart he said what
[1:16:45] happened was amen the log had fallen and
[1:16:48] it was in the water and he said there
[1:16:50] was no life in there he said so when I
[1:16:53] stepped on it it was in a Doty condition
[1:16:55] and it couldn't hold nothing amen I'm
[1:16:58] preaching to you amen cuz y'all know
[1:17:00] what it's like to get stepped on you
[1:17:02] know what it's like for people to step
[1:17:03] on you a and you all remember when
[1:17:06] people could step on you and it didn't
[1:17:08] keep you out of the house of God you
[1:17:09] remember when people could talk about
[1:17:11] you and it didn't quien your praise down
[1:17:13] you remember when they could spread lies
[1:17:15] on you and gossip about you and you
[1:17:17] still raised your hands you know why
[1:17:19] because in your soul you was in a
[1:17:21] Revival and the Revival was coming from
[1:17:24] the word and there was a spirit of
[1:17:26] Revival that was abiding with the word
[1:17:29] oh Church of the Living God I think it's
[1:17:31] time to get our Revival back I think
[1:17:33] it's time to get our Revival back on
[1:17:35] Monday it's time to get our Revival back
[1:17:38] on Tuesday we ain't just in Revival once
[1:17:40] a year we are in a word Revival and this
[1:17:44] revival is a fire of the word of God and
[1:17:47] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and it
[1:17:49] burns on good days it burns on bad days
[1:17:53] it burns on the mountain it burns in the
[1:17:55] valley it burns when we're sick it burns
[1:17:58] when we're well it burns when we're
[1:18:03] depressed feel good this morning I'm
[1:18:05] talking about a Revival that has come
[1:18:08] from the word now Overcomers here keep
[1:18:12] life in you are you with me if you're
[1:18:15] going to overcome you've got to keep
[1:18:18] life in you let me say this in Ro in
[1:18:20] Revelation three the Bible said to him
[1:18:23] that overcometh now brother BR says did
[1:18:24] you notice the arrangements of that see
[1:18:27] sat with me in my Throne not on my
[1:18:30] throne in my Throne that's in his domain
[1:18:37] see and now as Christ is the ruler the
[1:18:41] throne ruler at this time of the
[1:18:43] complete domain of God so will the
[1:18:46] church be with him the bride with him in
[1:18:50] his throne in the entire domain see not
[1:18:54] on my throne but in my Throne see where
[1:18:57] his domain reaches and a throne is over
[1:19:01] a domain and a domain reaches as far as
[1:19:04] its boundaries does and this is from
[1:19:08] eternity to Eternity now come on Church
[1:19:12] we're not talking about a temporary
[1:19:14] domain we're not talking about a
[1:19:16] temporary uh a throne position we're
[1:19:19] talking about brother Danny a domain
[1:19:21] that reaches from eternity unto eternity
[1:19:25] let me ask you this what did John say he
[1:19:27] said he that was in the beginning amen
[1:19:30] he said now right unto you children that
[1:19:32] you are strong amen because the word
[1:19:35] that was in the beginning is the same
[1:19:38] word that is restored in the end time
[1:19:41] and by the restoration of that word come
[1:19:43] a strengthen the church to withstand the
[1:19:46] greatest AG of deception listen church
[1:19:49] we are not going to be deceived I know
[1:19:52] Billy Graham said said the church is
[1:19:53] deceived but thank God for a prophet who
[1:19:56] corrected the error and said this bride
[1:19:58] can never be deceived because she's a
[1:20:01] part of God and to deceive this bride is
[1:20:04] to deceive
[1:20:06] God now I'm talking to you because you
[1:20:09] are a part of a Dominion the Bible said
[1:20:11] Romans 6:14 that sin shall not have
[1:20:14] dominion over you for ye are not under
[1:20:18] the law but you're under Grace I love
[1:20:20] what the prophet said he said our is the
[1:20:23] dominion over sin and it is enforced
[1:20:26] through the power that is in the spirit
[1:20:28] of Christ that indwells us every Kingdom
[1:20:32] on Earth is going to be Tor down but
[1:20:35] ours will remain now can I say this you
[1:20:39] are not just church members amen amen
[1:20:42] Amen brother brother brother Justin you
[1:20:44] got up this morning got ready for church
[1:20:46] amen you didn't go in the mirror and say
[1:20:48] come here Stephanie here's a king amen
[1:20:50] you're looking at a priest amen now come
[1:20:52] come on you know why amen because the
[1:20:54] way we see ourselves we don't see
[1:20:56] ourselves as kings we don't see
[1:20:58] ourselves as priests but if we could
[1:21:01] overcome ourselves then we could see
[1:21:03] ourselves the way the word sees us and
[1:21:06] the word said we have been made Kings
[1:21:08] and preached unto God now I know what
[1:21:11] the devil's done the devil has made that
[1:21:13] in the future but my Bible said that
[1:21:15] hath made us Kings and Priests unto God
[1:21:19] and his father to him be glory and
[1:21:21] Dominion forever and ever amen can I say
[1:21:24] this you are a king in the present you
[1:21:27] will also be a king in the future
[1:21:29] according to the prophet he said he hath
[1:21:32] made us that's a certain truth we need
[1:21:34] to emphasize is he hath made us
[1:21:37] salvation is of his doing salvation is
[1:21:39] of the lord it's all of Grace he
[1:21:42] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[1:21:44] for a purpose we are Kings and spiritual
[1:21:47] Kings now can I preach to you we are
[1:21:49] going to be Kings upon the Earth with
[1:21:51] him when he sits on his throne amen but
[1:21:54] now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign
[1:21:58] Over a spiritual Kingdom now come on the
[1:22:01] devil says that's in the future amen but
[1:22:03] here a prophet is saying it's not just
[1:22:05] in the future but there's some spiritual
[1:22:07] kings in the present that are reigning
[1:22:10] over a spiritual Kingdom according to
[1:22:12] Romans 5:17 by one man's offense amen
[1:22:16] death reigned by one man which by by one
[1:22:18] man much more they which receive amen an
[1:22:21] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:22:23] righteousness shall reign in his life by
[1:22:26] one Jesus Christ but watch Colossians
[1:22:28] 1:13 who hath delivered us from the
[1:22:32] power of darkness and have translated us
[1:22:35] into the kingdom which that word kingdom
[1:22:37] is a reign of his dear son oh brother
[1:22:42] sister right now we reign with Christ
[1:22:45] amen if you could if you could break
[1:22:47] beyond your feelings right now you would
[1:22:49] see that right now you reign with Christ
[1:22:52] all right having dominion over sin over
[1:22:56] the world over the Flesh and the devil
[1:22:59] and you are showing forth his praise and
[1:23:02] glory you are showing forth himself for
[1:23:05] it is Christ in us who is willing and
[1:23:08] doing of his good pleasure yes indeed
[1:23:11] even now we are seated in Heavenly
[1:23:14] places in Christ Jesus now let me say
[1:23:17] this some of you all amen you're looking
[1:23:19] for Dominion Amen to rule over the devil
[1:23:22] to rule over the Antichrist and to rule
[1:23:24] over the Earth amen and some of you
[1:23:26] can't even rule over your flesh in a
[1:23:28] Sunday morning service right now your
[1:23:30] flesh is whipping you your flesh has got
[1:23:32] you distracted your flesh has got you
[1:23:34] upset your flesh has got you frustrated
[1:23:37] H come on somebody it's Sunday morning
[1:23:40] and we might as well preach amen but I
[1:23:42] believe there's a bride amen that has
[1:23:44] the ability by the Deliverance of the
[1:23:47] power of God Amen to bring her flesh
[1:23:49] into subjection to the word and you can
[1:23:52] praise God in your flesh right here
[1:23:55] right now regardless of what you're
[1:23:57] going through amen can I preach a second
[1:24:00] amen I think we need to break Beyond
[1:24:01] something I think we need to break
[1:24:03] Beyond dead moments and meetings I think
[1:24:05] we need to break Beyond just just a
[1:24:07] little L you well can I preach brother
[1:24:10] Ben you know what I'm talking about amen

[1:24:14] you back the word of God you know how
[1:24:16] you open the Supernatural is you back
[1:24:18] the word of God you know how you open a
[1:24:20] man's gift is you back the word of God
[1:24:23] and when you begin to back the word of
[1:24:25] God God begins to come into battle and
[1:24:28] he begins to fight down the devil he
[1:24:30] begins to fight back against the spirits
[1:24:32] and he begins to bring an anointing into
[1:24:35] the building and the anointing is what
[1:24:37] destroys the Yoke and I say this morning
[1:24:40] we are in dominion over the flesh by the
[1:24:43] anointing of the Son of
[1:24:48] God y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:24:51] amen sometimes you got to you you got to

[1:25:04] feet I know what I'm talking about amen
[1:25:07] I'm going to go ahead and stand up am me
[1:25:09] whatever I got to do to let this flesh
[1:25:11] know he is not going to have dominion
[1:25:13] over me but I'm going to have dominion
[1:25:15] over him if I got to pray I'm going to
[1:25:18] pray if I got to shout I'm going to
[1:25:21] shout well and we got to be careful amen

[1:25:37] stinking rotten flesh we have got the
[1:25:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we have
[1:25:42] been given an authority to bring our
[1:25:45] flesh into subjection to the word and

[1:25:58] going to do the best thing I can do to
[1:26:00] this flesh I'm going to bring it into
[1:26:02] subjection to the word of power and
[1:26:05] authority and Lead it to a change I tell
[1:26:08] you why I'm saying these things is
[1:26:10] because you're air to more than what you
[1:26:12] think you're air
[1:26:14] to you are air to more than what you
[1:26:17] think you are air to according to a
[1:26:19] prophet he said the overcome
[1:26:22] is the heir of all things the Overcomer
[1:26:26] is the heir of all things he said you
[1:26:28] know people I don't see what's the
[1:26:29] matter with you as Christians that you
[1:26:31] don't walk around a little while amen
[1:26:33] and see what you own why don't you walk
[1:26:36] around a little while and see what you
[1:26:38] own come on now amen you got to walk
[1:26:41] around a little bit and see what you own
[1:26:43] you own more than depression as a matter

[1:27:33] Overcomer this is the age of the
[1:27:36] Overcomer prophet of God said in
[1:27:38] adoption part one he said Canaan does
[1:27:41] not represent the age of the Millennium
[1:27:43] it only represents the age of the
[1:27:45] Overcomer he said what is it it is the
[1:27:49] dispensation of overcoming because in
[1:27:52] can and they killed and they burned and

[1:28:06] have done they have taken these
[1:28:08] wonderful promises and they had put them
[1:28:10] so far in the future and said now if
[1:28:12] anybody's going to obtain them it's way
[1:28:14] off in the future but the prophet of God
[1:28:16] said amen we won't need Divine Healing
[1:28:19] in the Millennium he said we need Divine
[1:28:21] Healing now he said so why are we
[1:28:23] putting these things in the future when
[1:28:25] there's a people on the Earth that needs
[1:28:27] it now to possess these things can I say
[1:28:30] this amen many people are saying well

[1:28:34] and then I'm going to do some fighting
[1:28:36] amen can I say this there'll be no
[1:28:38] fighting in the Millennium if you're
[1:28:39] ever going to fight the devil church and
[1:28:42] living God now is the time to do it if
[1:28:44] you're ever going to fight the devil we
[1:28:46] need to fight him
[1:28:47] now come on well brother Andrew one day
[1:28:50] in the Millennium amen I'll fight for
[1:28:52] and get a breakthrough we won't need a
[1:28:53] breakthrough in the Millennium well one
[1:28:55] day brother Andrew over in the
[1:28:56] Millennium I I'll really break through
[1:28:58] this heaviness and I'll enjoy the
[1:28:59] blessings of God we won't need to break
[1:29:01] through the heaviness in the Millennium
[1:29:03] but right here right now this morning we
[1:29:06] need to break through the clouds of
[1:29:08] gloom and doom we need to break through
[1:29:10] the spirits of Oppression and depression
[1:29:13] and suppression we need to break through
[1:29:15] the clouds of down and step into the
[1:29:18] atmosphere where the Holy Ghost of God
[1:29:20] can come in the Church of God and can
[1:29:22] reveal the word of God as the authority
[1:29:25] of God in The Bride of God to overcome
[1:29:28] the enemy of God the
[1:29:31] devil Hallelujah now is the time to
[1:29:35] fight now is the time to win the battle
[1:29:37] and to overcome the things of the world
[1:29:39] there won't be no fight there the last
[1:29:42] prayer will be made there'll be no more
[1:29:44] prayer meetings there'll be no place for
[1:29:46] people to get saved there'll be no
[1:29:47] sickness to be healed it'll just be one
[1:29:50] great glorious thing see what could we
[1:29:52] as human beings this morning what could
[1:29:54] we promise what could we look at
[1:29:56] anything that would be any greater than
[1:29:58] looking to that promise of that
[1:30:02] time so the prophet of God is putting
[1:30:05] something in the future but Brother
[1:30:07] David is not the power to fight it's the
[1:30:10] Fulfillment of the promise of the word
[1:30:12] of the age you're living in now can I
[1:30:14] say this to you I believe that we're
[1:30:16] living in a special time I believe
[1:30:19] according to the message of the hour
[1:30:21] that we are living in adoption time now
[1:30:23] do you all know the Bible speaks of
[1:30:26] adoption the Bible speaks of spiritual
[1:30:29] adoption in Romans 8:14 the Bible said
[1:30:31] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:30:34] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[1:30:38] received amen the spirit of bondage
[1:30:40] again to fear but ye have received amen
[1:30:43] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB
[1:30:47] our father I love what the prophet says
[1:30:49] in God rich in Mercy I'm only saying
[1:30:51] this not to mix up Doctrine but to
[1:30:54] straighten it out that we might get away
[1:30:57] from this fear and scare you don't know
[1:31:00] who you are you're not going to be but
[1:31:03] now you are the sons of God see you
[1:31:06] always were the sons of God Amen can I
[1:31:09] can I take a five minute preach and
[1:31:11] break here and preach a second amen
[1:31:13] sometime or another you got to overcome
[1:31:15] the Battle of am I seat of God or
[1:31:18] not sometime or another you got to over
[1:31:21] come that devil because you got bigger
[1:31:24] battles to fight you got bigger cities
[1:31:26] to burn down you got bigger walls to
[1:31:28] tear down you got bigger Giants to slay
[1:31:32] sometime or another you got to come to a
[1:31:34] place of a revelation I'm a Son of God
[1:31:37] I'm a seat of God my name is in the
[1:31:39] Lamb's Book of Life amen I'm on my way
[1:31:42] to a Rapture I know who my daddy is I
[1:31:45] know where I come from and I know where
[1:31:47] I'm
[1:31:48] going I know what I'm talking about amen
[1:31:51] cuz if you don't ever settle that the
[1:31:52] devil will have you living in limbo when
[1:31:55] the things are going good you're a Son
[1:31:56] of God and when things are going bad
[1:31:58] you're not when you're well you're a Son
[1:32:00] of God and when you're sick you're not
[1:32:03] amen but if you ever come to a victory
[1:32:05] over the devil of confusion if you ever
[1:32:08] come to a place of authority then no
[1:32:10] matter what the devil says no matter
[1:32:12] what the devil throws at you you can
[1:32:14] stand up on the word of God and say I'm
[1:32:17] a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm a
[1:32:20] seed of God and there's nothing the
[1:32:22] devil can do to change who I
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:28] amall get away from the fear and scare
[1:32:31] get away from the spirit of bondage get
[1:32:33] away from the ideas of confusion and
[1:32:36] come underneath the spirit of adoption
[1:32:38] and start walking as an
[1:32:41] overcomer now you say but Andre I don't
[1:32:43] know well can I say this your sons of

[1:35:10] when you heard the first tape or read
[1:35:12] the first book or went to the first
[1:35:14] Youth Camp but the seed was put there
[1:35:17] from the beginning from before the
[1:35:20] foundation of the
[1:35:21] in other words that's why John could
[1:35:23] write and say young men the word of God
[1:35:26] abides which is the seat of God and in
[1:35:29] the end time when the Antichrist is
[1:35:31] revealed when the mark of the beast is
[1:35:33] revealed there will be somebody on the
[1:35:36] earth who will be fully equipped by the
[1:35:39] revelation of predestination from the
[1:35:42] forn knowledge of God that they will

[1:36:32] puppet yes sir now y'all know I'm
[1:36:34] talking about the seed of God right and
[1:36:36] that seed is in the heart it's not in
[1:36:38] the
[1:36:39] head in other words this adoption is not
[1:36:43] intellectual It's Supernatural oh yeah
[1:36:46] this adoption is something that is
[1:36:48] transcending the
[1:36:50] natural am brother B said we today are
[1:36:54] God's Spiritual
[1:36:55] Church oh yeah can we say
[1:36:58] Amen we today are God's spiritual church
[1:37:02] with a spiritual law that is written on
[1:37:05] the table of our hearts so where is this
[1:37:08] seed working at it's not working in your
[1:37:12] head it's working in your heart come on
[1:37:15] now brother said why can iist speak or
[1:37:17] rather leadership he said Moses went out
[1:37:20] there I love how he says brother Joe he
[1:37:22] said Moses went out there and he looked
[1:37:24] upon the Egyptians and he looked upon
[1:37:26] the Israelites and he seen their
[1:37:28] condition and sister Vicki I love what
[1:37:30] he says he says and the seed of God went
[1:37:33] to work in his
[1:37:35] heart the predestinated seed went to
[1:37:39] work in his heart he looked at the
[1:37:41] Egyptians he looked at the Israelites he
[1:37:43] seen all the bondage but the oh God but
[1:37:47] what he was seeing with his eye could
[1:37:49] not affect what he was believing with
[1:37:50] his Hearts because there was a seed in
[1:37:53] his heart that was greater than the
[1:37:55] temporal things he could see with his
[1:37:57] eye and brother BR brings that to the
[1:37:59] church and says we today are God's
[1:38:01] spiritual church with a written law on
[1:38:03] our hearts are you ready for this and we
[1:38:06] are LED in a spiritual form brother said
[1:38:09] the leadership of God is what he said
[1:38:11] it's follow the Vindicated word of God
[1:38:15] for the age the leadership of God is to
[1:38:19] follow what's been Vindicated don't get
[1:38:21] mad at me but your feelings hadn't been
[1:38:25] Vindicated your emotions hadn't been
[1:38:27] Vindicated your Sensations hadn't been
[1:38:30] Vindicated and I'm this close to it I
[1:38:32] might as well preach and neither are we
[1:38:34] following
[1:38:35] gifts come on I said neither are we
[1:38:38] following gifts because your gift has
[1:38:40] not been Vindicated it's not the sign of
[1:38:43] the Messiah we thank God for your gift
[1:38:45] amen but you will never subject this
[1:38:47] bride Amen to an impersonation of the
[1:38:50] sign of the Messiah and call it the
[1:38:52] bride's Revival as long as this old
[1:38:54] country boy has got breath in my body I
[1:38:57] will say what a prophet said he said
[1:38:59] there's one to an age and anything
[1:39:02] outside of the Vindicated side of the
[1:39:04] Messiah is a Janice and Chambers
[1:39:06] impersonation and their fly will be made
[1:39:09] manifest amen Old Church of the Living
[1:39:12] God I think it's time to remember that
[1:39:14] God sent a prophet in this
[1:39:17] generation and he was more than just
[1:39:19] some preacher he was more than just some
[1:39:21] teacher but the pillar of
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:25] fire I know what I'm talking about amen
[1:39:28] cuz you brother Ben can I take some
[1:39:30] Liberty because you put the open gifts
[1:39:32] on the floor and before long you're
[1:39:34] going to have demons leading the church
[1:39:36] instead of the Holy
[1:39:38] Ghost Brother David you know what I'm
[1:39:40] talking about amen amen open up the
[1:39:42] floor and let every gift come in and
[1:39:43] don't check it amen before
[1:39:46] long can I have some
[1:39:48] Liberty you know what happens don't you
[1:39:51] amen if somebody operates a gift and
[1:39:53] because somebody has put a fear over
[1:39:55] them of touch not my anointed amen they
[1:39:58] claim that's anointed and so nobody
[1:40:00] checks it because they don't want to be
[1:40:01] guilty of blaspheming Amen but can I ask
[1:40:04] you when did we get so chicken hearted
[1:40:06] that we can't even check things by the
[1:40:08] word of God
[1:40:10] anymore we used to check things by the
[1:40:13] message we used to give it the word test
[1:40:15] we used to say this is of God and this
[1:40:18] is not now come on Church am I tell you
[1:40:20] what happened
[1:40:21] amen is the people doing it change but
[1:40:23] the word didn't change and I don't care
[1:40:25] what their name is I don't care what
[1:40:27] their direction is if it's contrary to
[1:40:30] the headship of this body we ought to
[1:40:32] give it the word test and if it's found
[1:40:34] an error we ought to repent of the thing
[1:40:36] and move on for the glory of
[1:40:40] God I know what I'm talking about amen
[1:40:42] cuz you let guests come in and you don't
[1:40:43] check them by the word
[1:40:46] and I may get in trouble but I'm going
[1:40:49] to preach here for a second I was
[1:40:50] preaching one time and I you know how it
[1:40:52] is brother Carlton I kind of got into an
[1:40:53] area on the prophet of God teaching
[1:40:55] Church order you know and I said man I
[1:40:57] said thank God for a prophet who come
[1:40:59] and taught Church order I said he put
[1:41:01] the gifts in the back room he put the
[1:41:03] church in order I I could feel a little
[1:41:05] bit of tension you know come in the room

[1:41:17] brandom Tabernacle that ain't got
[1:41:19] nothing to do with the bride today I
[1:41:21] said if it was good enough for brandom
[1:41:22] Tabernacle it's good enough for every
[1:41:24] church that claims to believe the
[1:41:25] prophet that God raised up out of
[1:41:27] brandom
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:30] Tabernacle now I know where I'm at I'm
[1:41:33] I'm I'm I'm standing right with the
[1:41:34] message because what happens is is you
[1:41:36] get people saying things by impression
[1:41:39] and not by true leadership so they say
[1:41:41] oo I feel I see you're going to have a

[1:42:15] message amen get mad at me if you want
[1:42:17] to but be a man and stand with the
[1:42:21] message of the

[1:43:28] either it's God or it's a devil
[1:43:30] impersonating the Messiah side and it
[1:43:32] ought to be brought subject to the word
[1:43:34] and we ought to break the confusion over
[1:43:36] the minds of people and come back to the
[1:43:38] landmark of the church which is the
[1:43:40] message of the Hour come on young people
[1:43:42] I don't care what anybody feels over you
[1:43:44] anybody thinks over you don't you
[1:43:46] subject your life to a gift that's got a
[1:43:48] possibility to be an heir when you got a

[1:44:25] in tongues interpreted and they
[1:44:26] prophesied well brother brother brother
[1:44:28] Danny when they got done prophesying we
[1:44:30] had three interpretations of one
[1:44:32] prophecy three interpretations of one
[1:44:35] prophecy so what we done was we took the
[1:44:37] three interpretations and hung them up
[1:44:39] on the bulletin board and brother Harvey
[1:44:41] God is my witness the pastor got up the
[1:44:43] next service he said now the Lord has
[1:44:45] spoken to this church and he said
[1:44:46] there's been a prophecy and he said now
[1:44:48] the interpretations is on the billboard
[1:44:50] he said and whichever one comes to pass
[1:44:52] that's the direction of God for this
[1:44:55] church I'm sorry I'm not a hir and I'm a

[1:49:01] in the dream it takes a prophet to
[1:49:03] interpret it come on church amen either

[1:49:24] come hell or H water or let's walk off
[1:49:26] and take something
[1:49:31] else now you said brother you're getting
[1:49:34] pretty strong I am getting strong cuz
[1:49:35] it's
[1:49:36] confusion come on and the message of the
[1:49:39] hour is not confusion that's right right
[1:49:42] come on
[1:49:45] Amen come on that's good come on good
[1:49:49] the spirit is not confusion the spirit
[1:49:53] beareth record with our spirit that we
[1:49:55] are the children of God now can I say
[1:49:57] this to you can I have a few more
[1:49:59] minutes y'all still love me absolutely
[1:50:03] come on we are living in the season
[1:50:06] where the confusion has been
[1:50:08] broke and we're no longer under
[1:50:11] expectation of something to happen we're
[1:50:13] living in the season of manifestation
[1:50:16] right in other words what was an
[1:50:19] expectation a few years ago is now the
[1:50:24] manifestation on can I say this and you
[1:50:27] are that
[1:50:29] manifestation in other words we're not
[1:50:32] here every service building up your
[1:50:34] hopes there's something great coming
[1:50:36] or's something great going to happen oh
[1:50:37] just pray just fast no we're saying what
[1:50:41] has been spoken as expectation has now
[1:50:43] come to manifestation because we've come
[1:50:46] back under the headship of the body
[1:50:48] which has the ability to transform the
[1:50:51] expectation to manifestation in other
[1:50:54] words I I sat like this I was preaching
[1:50:55] down at Matt brother mats on Wednesday
[1:50:57] amen and while I was preaching I got in
[1:50:59] this area and brother it just it just
[1:51:00] struck me as clear as day that I'm
[1:51:02] literally preaching to manifestations
[1:51:05] because I remember a few years ago amen
[1:51:07] when brother Matt felt his heart to
[1:51:08] start the work there I went there and
[1:51:10] preached when it was a barn and I
[1:51:11] remember walking by bulletin board and
[1:51:14] talk about bulletin board I walked by a
[1:51:15] bulletin board and there was a bunch of
[1:51:17] names on there and brother Matt said
[1:51:18] those are babies that are that we're
[1:51:20] praying for for God to bring them back
[1:51:21] in the house of God and brother Samu
[1:51:23] while I was preaching Wednesday night it
[1:51:25] was his clear as day it broke before me
[1:51:27] that what I seen over there in on
[1:51:29] bulletin board is sitting before me in
[1:51:33] manifestation the ones they were praying
[1:51:35] for had moved from expectation into
[1:51:38] manifestation in other words we expected
[1:51:42] but now the manifestation is here
[1:51:44] they're back in the house of God well
[1:51:45] come on Word of Life amen some of you
[1:51:48] all amen years ago was expectations you
[1:51:51] and your family was expectation your
[1:51:53] confession amen but this morning you're
[1:51:56] not expectation you are here in
[1:52:02] manifestation sir don't get mad at me
[1:52:05] brother Caron years ago the bride was an
[1:52:08] expectation but today I can say by the
[1:52:11] voice of the seventh angel she is now in
[1:52:14] manifestation she has been revealed this
[1:52:18] is the days of the manifestation of the
[1:52:21] sons of God in the days of the
[1:52:23] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:52:26] the Mysteries that has been hid since
[1:52:28] the foundation of the world is to be
[1:52:31] made known this is the hour now that's
[1:52:34] why I say we're not going back to
[1:52:36] preaching gifts we're going to preach
[1:52:38] the reveal amen Mysteries of the word of
[1:52:41] God in the age we're living in I believe
[1:52:44] in the gifts I believe in Emotion I
[1:52:47] believe in shouting come on y'all been
[1:52:49] hearing me preach since I was a teenager
[1:52:51] you know I believe in those things but I
[1:52:53] believe where the power comes to whip
[1:52:55] the devil is by the preaching of the
[1:52:58] revelation of the word of God in the age
[1:53:01] that's been unveiled in and let that
[1:53:03] take the preeminence in the
[1:53:06] church now can I just go ahead and
[1:53:07] preach a minute
[1:53:09] I'm feeling good right now brother Bill
[1:53:11] Propet of God said this is the day when
[1:53:13] the sons of God are manifested he said
[1:53:15] do you know that men are sons of God
[1:53:18] they are amateur Gods remember my
[1:53:20] opening quote whenever the spirit of God
[1:53:22] moves the devil is skeptic of the sons
[1:53:24] of God but Christians always overcome he
[1:53:28] said the Bible said ye are gods in
[1:53:30] Genesis 2 they were Gods because they
[1:53:32] had full dominion over the Dominion of
[1:53:34] the world he give him dominion over all
[1:53:37] things amen but he lost his godship he
[1:53:40] lost his sunship he lost his domain and
[1:53:43] Satan took it over when Adam fell he
[1:53:47] lost his sunship he lost his godship
[1:53:49] ship he lost his domain and the devil
[1:53:52] took it over but brother Oh Glory but
[1:53:56] brother we are waiting for the
[1:53:58] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:54:00] will come back and will take it over
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:06] again all right testing one two we are
[1:54:09] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:54:11] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:54:14] it over again listen we are not taking
[1:54:18] something away from the Devil that
[1:54:20] belong to
[1:54:21] him he took it away from
[1:54:24] us I said he took it away from us so you
[1:54:28] feel bad to go take something back from
[1:54:30] the Devil he's a squatter he's a thief
[1:54:34] he's a robber it don't belong to him
[1:54:36] come on Mama I know the devil's got that

[1:55:31] religion has it ever dawned on you now
[1:55:34] I'm I'm just going to preach here for a
[1:55:35] second cuz we've got one
[1:55:37] service come
[1:55:40] on we can settle a lot of
[1:55:43] confusion come on brother Andrew I I
[1:55:46] don't know we sing We Sing new songs we
[1:55:49] don't sing them old songs well I I just
[1:55:53] I'll just say
[1:55:54] this I've been in meetings before and
[1:55:57] Brother David we've sung songs that
[1:55:58] Luther didn't even
[1:56:02] know you've been
[1:56:04] there we we we sung songs that Luther
[1:56:07] didn't even
[1:56:08] sing and there wasn't an ounce more of
[1:56:10] anointing come in the building than if
[1:56:12] we' have been singing our god is awesome
[1:56:14] that's right right there' have probably
[1:56:17] been more CU we would have known it
[1:56:18] actually
[1:56:21] so confusion comes in and then we get
[1:56:24] praise police oh
[1:56:26] God and so they say will you watch when
[1:56:29] they sing a certain song Everybody
[1:56:31] shouts at that certain
[1:56:33] song can I
[1:56:35] preach well has it ever crossed your
[1:56:38] mind that they might have a reality of
[1:56:40] that
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:42] [Applause]
[1:56:44] song has the thought ever crossed your
[1:56:47] mind that they might know that their God
[1:56:49] is is awesome Hallelujah has it ever
[1:56:51] crossed your mind that they might have
[1:56:53] been in the fiery furnace but they seen
[1:56:55] the awesome God come in the fiery
[1:56:57] furnace and deliver them has it ever
[1:56:59] crossed your mind that their God is a
[1:57:02] high God and he's a holy God you say
[1:57:04] brother Ander oh God I'm going preach a
[1:57:07] bus he say well I'm a little bit sick of

[1:57:11] like I know what God has done for me and
[1:57:13] everybody shouts well maybe he ain't
[1:57:15] done nothing for you so you ain't got
[1:57:17] nothing to shout about but when we at
[1:57:19] Judah I know where he brought me from I
[1:57:22] know what he saved me from I know what
[1:57:24] he done for me I know the hell that he

[1:57:29] dance because I'm taken back what the
[1:57:34] devil stole from me y'all know I'm
[1:57:37] telling the
[1:57:39] truth so then oh God I'm going to get in

[1:58:00] on can I preach brother Ben I sit one
[1:58:03] time there some guys talking about some
[1:58:04] songs and they said one song and I said
[1:58:06] yeah I really don't like that song they
[1:58:08] said you don't like that song I said
[1:58:10] well to be honest with you I really
[1:58:11] don't care for it they said seriously I
[1:58:13] said yeah they said we had never known
[1:58:15] that I said I know you wouldn't have
[1:58:18] because I don't hold a silent protest
[1:58:20] when you sing it that's right that's
[1:58:25] right I'm not an infant baby I'm a
[1:58:27] mature Son of God and I know that when
[1:58:29] we get done singing this we're going to
[1:58:31] sing another
[1:58:32] song so I'm not going to sit on the
[1:58:34] atmosphere and let everybody around me
[1:58:36] know I don't like this song I'm going to
[1:58:38] go ahead and sing it cuz I know there's
[1:58:39] another song coming well glory to God it
[1:58:42] feels good in the house of God on Sunday
[1:58:44] morning it's time to grow up and quit
[1:58:47] putting a quit putting a kink in the
[1:58:48] atmosphere here and let the Holy Ghost
[1:58:51] move something that song might bless you
[1:58:54] it may I don't know why I'm here but I'm
[1:58:55] here it may not bless me and what
[1:58:58] blesses me may not bless you but guess
[1:59:00] what in a few minutes the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:02] going to come in the building and he's
[1:59:03] going to bless us all so if he comes by
[1:59:06] How Great Thou Art or our god is awesome
[1:59:08] or I would not be denied or There Is
[1:59:10] Power in the Blood amen let's just lay
[1:59:12] aside our feelings and overcome
[1:59:14] ourselves and let the Holy Ghost come in
[1:59:17] the church in the power power of
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:22] authority because when he shows up he's
[1:59:25] going to bless us all Oh Brother Bruce
[1:59:27] when he shows up he's going to bless the
[1:59:29] old he's going to bless the young he's
[1:59:32] going to bless the babies he's going to
[1:59:33] bless the teenagers he's going to bless
[1:59:35] the preacher he's going to bless the
[1:59:37] musicians I say let's overcome
[1:59:44] ourselves now you say brother Andrew
[1:59:46] you're getting way out there am I though
[1:59:49] oh come on we got to overcome ourselves
[1:59:52] yes
[1:59:57] sir I hate to bust your bubble on Sunday
[1:59:59] morning oh my but it ain't all about
[2:00:06] us that's right it ain't about us that's
[2:00:11] right now you said brother anderw I wish
[2:00:14] the Holy Ghost was here he
[2:00:16] is yes the presence of the Holy spirit
[2:00:19] in this world he said instead of Jesus
[2:00:22] being here proves that Jesus was
[2:00:25] righteous and went to the father that's
[2:00:27] right he said he sent the comforter he
[2:00:29] was the comforter he came back in spirit
[2:00:31] upon the true church he is the faithful
[2:00:33] and true witness in the midst of the
[2:00:35] church now I know what people do right
[2:00:37] here they say well brother Andrew you're
[2:00:39] preaching about a Dominion so you're
[2:00:40] saying Corporal body so he's not here in
[2:00:42] any power let me say this I believe in
[2:00:45] the Corporal body of Jesus Christ that's
[2:00:48] right but brother said one day he's
[2:00:50] going to come back in flesh again he
[2:00:52] said he will prove who is the only wise
[2:00:54] potentate it is he Jesus Christ the lord
[2:00:57] of Glory now can I say this to you his
[2:01:00] Corporal body return that's the future
[2:01:02] yeah that's right but brother Joel what
[2:01:06] about the present tense right here
[2:01:12] now
[2:01:13] now if a voice can I can I preach here
[2:01:16] for a second if a voice of indication
[2:01:20] comes in the church it settles the
[2:01:24] confusion I've used this many times if
[2:01:26] there was no lights in this building and
[2:01:29] you walked in the building and brother
[2:01:30] Harvey you walked up the aisle and you
[2:01:32] got halfway up and you tripped over
[2:01:34] something and you kept on walking you
[2:01:36] went back out tripped over it again and
[2:01:38] you met brother Jeremy out in the in the
[2:01:40] forer and you said he said brother
[2:01:42] Harvey why' you trip over and you say
[2:01:44] well I think somebody got their chair
[2:01:45] out in the aisle too far so brother
[2:01:47] Jeremy walks down through here and he
[2:01:49] trips over and he said no that that that
[2:01:51] that feels different than a chair so he
[2:01:53] goes back out and brother Danny's
[2:01:54] walking in and he said brother Danny he
[2:01:56] said I tripped over something he said
[2:01:58] but then he said what do you think it is
[2:02:00] he said I'll just be honest with you we
[2:02:01] had that Bigfoot preacher from Tennessee
[2:02:03] or Virginia and I think one of his shoes
[2:02:04] is out there in the
[2:02:07] aisle okay so brother Danny walks in and
[2:02:10] he gets halfway up there and he he's
[2:02:12] walking through there and he said that's
[2:02:13] at Joel again he's been in here working
[2:02:15] and left a ladder in the
[2:02:16] floor so now we've got three different
[2:02:20] interpretations of one
[2:02:24] object three interpretations of one
[2:02:27] object so how are we going to settle it
[2:02:29] well somebody's got to turn on the light
[2:02:33] and when the light comes on the light is
[2:02:35] not going to change what is laying there
[2:02:38] it's going to reveal what is laying
[2:02:40] there and when the light strikes it it's
[2:02:42] going to reveal that somebody dropped a
[2:02:44] toy and the toys laying there so we had
[2:02:47] a shoe we had a ladder we had a chair
[2:02:50] but when the lot spoke the lot said it's
[2:02:53] a toy come on church we had this Bible
[2:02:57] for 2,000 years and people were tripping
[2:02:59] over this and tripping over that and
[2:03:01] somebody said what was it they said well
[2:03:03] it's three gods and somebody said what
[2:03:05] was it they said well there's no hell
[2:03:07] amen but then in the days of the son of
[2:03:09] man in the evening time it shall be
[2:03:12] light again when the light comes on it
[2:03:15] will reveal what is laying there and
[2:03:17] here's what a prophet said my Ministry
[2:03:20] is to declare him that he is
[2:03:24] here what's all these signs about he's
[2:03:27] here what's all this healing about he's
[2:03:29] here what's all this Revelation about
[2:03:32] he's here what's all this crying about
[2:03:34] he's here what's all these charts about
[2:03:36] he's here are you hearing me the Son of
[2:03:40] God is
[2:03:42] here now I'm going to say this to you if
[2:03:45] he's here he's got to be
[2:03:47] somewhere
[2:03:49] on the lamb was one creature the dove
[2:03:51] was another creature but when the Dove
[2:03:52] and the lamb United together God was
[2:03:54] manifested in the flesh that's right all
[2:03:57] right but now are you ready for this but
[2:04:01] now he's manifested in your flesh right
[2:04:06] thank you
[2:04:07] Lord that's right that's good in your
[2:04:10] flesh by being adopted
[2:04:14] Sons oh yes so adoption brings light on
[2:04:19] your
[2:04:22] sunship and shows through the baptism of
[2:04:25] the Holy Ghost you are joined hirs with
[2:04:27] the Lord Jesus Christ and the super oh
[2:04:30] God I'm running out of time the Super
[2:04:32] was the first man that God could come
[2:04:34] into all that God was he poured into
[2:04:36] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[2:04:39] into the church super sign God and man
[2:04:42] together was to be the Super sign of the
[2:04:45] last day I haven't left my subject now
[2:04:47] the Overcomers of this page are you
[2:04:49] ready for this when the entire Bible was
[2:04:52] to be fulfilled in the last day when the
[2:04:56] entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the
[2:05:00] last days would be when the sons of God
[2:05:03] would be revealed or manifested and the
[2:05:06] power of God would return to the church
[2:05:08] the authority of God would return to the
[2:05:11] church and the word of God would be
[2:05:14] restored to the church then we would
[2:05:17] step into adoption
[2:05:19] I'm closing on this point the prophet of
[2:05:21] God said look he said we were
[2:05:23] predestinated unto the adoption let me
[2:05:26] back up here and pull one verse from
[2:05:28] Galatians 4:3 even so when we were
[2:05:30] children we were in bondage under under
[2:05:35] the elements of the world but when the
[2:05:37] fullness of the time was come God sent
[2:05:39] forth his son made of a woman made under
[2:05:42] the law to redeem them that were under
[2:05:44] the law that we might receive the
[2:05:46] adoption of sons now can I say say what
[2:05:48] a prophet said your adoption is not your
[2:05:51] birth it's your placing that's right
[2:05:55] period is that okay what a prophet
[2:05:58] talk see now I'm going to close on this
[2:06:01] point right here so why would you say
[2:06:04] election can I say this to you because
[2:06:07] your election goes with your adoption
[2:06:09] that's right
[2:06:11] amen come on ready for this which
[2:06:14] positionally places you in your position
[2:06:18] yeah look at look at Romans 9:11 that
[2:06:21] the purpose of God according to election
[2:06:23] might stand Romans 11:28 but as touching
[2:06:26] the election they are beloved for the
[2:06:28] father's sakes 1 Thessalonians 1:4
[2:06:30] knowing Brethren beloved your election
[2:06:33] is of
[2:06:35] God can I give you second Peter 1:10
[2:06:38] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[2:06:39] diligence to make sure to make your
[2:06:41] calling and election what sure for if
[2:06:45] you do these things then one day you
[2:06:48] might fall but you might make
[2:06:50] it come on if you do these things
[2:06:53] Brother David ye shall never fall can I
[2:06:57] can I give you the Bible definition of
[2:06:59] election it is used of the act of God's
[2:07:01] Free Will by which before the foundation
[2:07:05] of the world he decreed His blessings to
[2:07:08] certain
[2:07:12] persons say it louder I'm one of them
[2:07:14] brother amen hallelujah the decree was
[2:07:17] made from choice
[2:07:19] by which he determined to bless certain
[2:07:21] persons through Christ by Grace oh yeah
[2:07:26] a thing or person that's chosen so in
[2:07:29] other words Brother David don't get mad
[2:07:31] at me but you weren't born and he look
[2:07:32] at you and say I can't use David uh
[2:07:35] maybe use Sean but I can use Ben and I
[2:07:38] don't know about Joel but I can sure use
[2:07:40] Miguel and maybe Judah eventually I
[2:07:43] don't
[2:07:45] know he did this before you was born
[2:07:48] yeah come on before you come in the
[2:07:51] world John wrote about you and said
[2:07:54] you'll be strong and you'll overcome the
[2:07:56] world Listen Church John was writing to
[2:07:59] the Overcomers of the last age you know
[2:08:01] why because they wouldn't just be
[2:08:03] overcoming one deed they would be
[2:08:05] overcoming the culmination of every
[2:08:07] rebuke of seven Church ages but the
[2:08:10] prophet of God said they would
[2:08:13] overcome come on by the word now look at
[2:08:17] this how many believes in predestin
[2:08:19] for ordination election if you believe
[2:08:21] the Bible you have to predestination
[2:08:24] looks back to for knowledge but for
[2:08:26] knowledge brother Allan looks to
[2:08:29] destination he said but God not making
[2:08:32] set it in order a little hole that you
[2:08:34] have to go through and can't go no other
[2:08:36] way but God in order to be God he know
[2:08:39] the end from the beginning so he could
[2:08:42] predicted and set things in order to
[2:08:45] happen now I'm going to talk to you
[2:08:47] about Moses here he said Look by God's
[2:08:49] wise Providence he revealed by spiritual
[2:08:52] Revelation that this was going to be his
[2:08:55] chosen vessel the prophet of God said so
[2:08:57] Moses mother wasn't scared of the king's
[2:09:00] Commandments for by faith she saw him
[2:09:03] with the children of Israel amen now
[2:09:05] what did she do she saw him placing them
[2:09:08] over in the promised land the prophet of
[2:09:11] God said God know everything would be
[2:09:13] placed can you give me first Peter 1:1
[2:09:16] the Bible says Peter an apostle of Jesus
[2:09:19] Christ verse two elect according to the
[2:09:22] forn knowledge of God the Father through
[2:09:25] sanctification of the spirit unto
[2:09:27] obedience and the sprinkling of the
[2:09:30] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[2:09:33] peace be multiplied look at this word
[2:09:35] forn knowledge it is the forethought
[2:09:38] amen it is a pre-arrangement so in other
[2:09:41] words when you showed up God did not
[2:09:43] make arrangements for you the
[2:09:45] arrangements was already made come on
[2:09:49] God calls Men by election by the four
[2:09:52] knowledge the prophet of God s God in
[2:09:54] order to be God no in the end from the
[2:09:56] beginning he had to know everything he
[2:09:58] had to know what the end was from the
[2:09:59] beginning or he wouldn't have been the
[2:10:01] almighty God can I say this to you amen
[2:10:04] we sing a song Amen of the goodness of
[2:10:07] God how many knows that song Amen Luther
[2:10:10] didn't sing it we sing it of the
[2:10:11] goodness of God are you hearing me can I
[2:10:14] say this to you amen the goodness of God
[2:10:17] is manifest Ed in the forn knowledge of
[2:10:20] God the goodness of God is manifested in
[2:10:23] the forn knowledge of God in other words
[2:10:26] the prophet said now in the calling of
[2:10:28] this time they're going out on this I
[2:10:30] was born of a very humble parent a very
[2:10:33] humble home I have no education at all
[2:10:36] when I made that remark a while ago
[2:10:37] about education I wasn't trying to take
[2:10:39] crutches from my ignorance but what I'm
[2:10:41] trying to say is that it doesn't take
[2:10:43] education to know God it takes a
[2:10:46] submissive heart to know God and I was
[2:10:48] raised poor I was raised in an
[2:10:50] irreligious family but from the very
[2:10:52] time I was born amen something happened
[2:10:55] it was not of my goodness not of my
[2:10:58] parents' goodness but by the for
[2:11:00] knowledge of
[2:11:01] God oh y'all get mad at me if you want
[2:11:03] to but brother Justin I guarantee it
[2:11:05] brother Brandon was here amen and made
[2:11:07] this statement and we sang that song you
[2:11:09] don't know like I know I guarantee you
[2:11:11] he' shout right with us he said he
[2:11:13] brought it I don't know why I don't know
[2:11:16] why he brought me he said but I get to
[2:11:18] show that he can choose what he wish to
[2:11:21] whether it come out of the Vatican City
[2:11:23] or off of a rubbish heap if God chooses
[2:11:25] to use your vessel in the last days
[2:11:28] there is nothing the devil can do to
[2:11:30] defeat the forn knowledge of God that's
[2:11:33] right are you ready for this I'm closing
[2:11:35] on this point right here you're going to
[2:11:37] fight to go to hell or you're going to
[2:11:39] fight to go to
[2:11:40] heaven you have been forn of God you
[2:11:43] have been predestinated of God you have

[2:24:48] impressing on my heart to read this to
[2:24:50] you very strongly the prophet of God
[2:24:53] said Jesus never come to the Earth and
[2:24:55] died in vain he never taken a chance to
[2:24:57] come to Earth he wouldn't have did that
[2:24:59] no God don't run his office in heaven
[2:25:01] like that Loosely he came to the Earth
[2:25:04] to die for a purpose and not just to see
[2:25:07] if somebody well God before the
[2:25:08] foundation of the world forsaw the whole
[2:25:10] thing do you believe that he foresaw it
[2:25:13] by forn knowledge he forew it therefore
[2:25:15] he knew there was going to be a church
[2:25:18] called out without spot or wrinkle and
[2:25:20] there had to be preparations made to
[2:25:22] save that church so he sent Jesus not
[2:25:25] just perhaps somebody might be saved but
[2:25:28] he knew who was going to do it than he'd
[2:25:31] have a people called out and you are
[2:25:36] they that's right he'd have a people
[2:25:39] that would believe in Divine Healing and
[2:25:41] would accept the strapes for their
[2:25:43] healing and you are they God knew it he
[2:25:46] knew KN there'd be unbelievers there was
[2:25:48] then he knew they would be he forew it
[2:25:50] so therefore he could forese it would be
[2:25:53] that way and he for knew there'd be
[2:25:55] somebody who'd believe it so he sent
[2:25:58] Jesus for those who believe it and here
[2:26:01] they are today gathered here at one spot
[2:26:04] to accept what God fornew would take
[2:26:07] place thank God made a preparation for
[2:26:11] those who would believe and you're a
[2:26:13] part of that preparation God fornew
[2:26:15] before the world a was formed there were
[2:26:17] be here that's the reason he could
[2:26:18] foretell it he fornew it he made a
