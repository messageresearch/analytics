[49:00] this morning uh Brother Bruce looks like
[49:02] you got someone there with you God bless
[49:05] uh you this morning good to have you
[49:06] each one of you that are here it's
[49:08] always good to see you in the house of
[49:10] the Lord I've got a little bit of a
[49:12] allergies acting up as I'm sure a lot of
[49:14] you are as well so just bear with me
[49:17] this morning if you will we'll try to
[49:19] get through it uh Luke 11:21 says when a
[49:23] strong man armed keepeth his Palace his
[49:26] goods are in
[49:28] peace but when a stronger than he shall
[49:32] come upon him and overcome him he taketh
[49:35] from him all his armor where in he
[49:38] trusted and divided his spoils and then
[49:42] James chap 1 and verse
[49:46] 2 says my
[49:48] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[49:51] into diverse
[49:53] Temptations as different kinds of
[49:56] Temptation
[49:57] patience knowing this that the trying of
[50:00] your faith worketh patience but let
[50:04] patience have her perfect work or her
[50:07] full work that you may be perfect or
[50:11] mature and entire wanting or lacking
[50:15] nothing is that where we want to be this
[50:17] morning what we want to be God bless you
[50:20] as you have your
[50:23] seats we found out a couple weeks ago
[50:26] that the stronger man was Christ he is
[50:31] the one who could cast out the devil
[50:34] because he is the stronger man he is the
[50:37] one uh who has the ability to uh
[50:41] overcome the enemy and we can't do it in
[50:44] ourselves but he is the stronger man I'm
[50:46] getting feedback I think on this I can
[50:48] hear some feedback it may be in my ear
[50:51] we found out that uh he is the strong
[50:54] man the devil uh and we know that even
[50:56] or or or Christ is the is the the devil
[50:59] is the strong man Christ is the stronger
[51:01] one who can cast out the devil and that
[51:04] means that uh he's greater than anything
[51:06] that you face and we know that uh the
[51:10] devil doesn't cast out himself even
[51:12] Judas though he cast out Devils but he
[51:15] did it by the power of God he did it in
[51:17] the name of Jesus and so Jesus makes
[51:21] this argument to the Pharisees he said
[51:23] if I by Beelzebub cast out devils he
[51:26] said by whom do your sons cast them out
[51:29] he said therefore shall they be your
[51:31] judges but if I with the Finger of God
[51:34] cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of
[51:36] God has come upon you so when you see a
[51:40] supernatural working of the Holy Ghost
[51:43] to cast out the evil one out of your
[51:45] midst then you know that God is working
[51:49] there that the that the kingdom of God
[51:52] is come unto you and so whenever uh
[51:55] whenever that happens whenever the
[51:57] strong whenever we have strength in our
[51:58] life to cast out those things that are
[52:01] wrong we know that it was God that did
[52:03] that but Bill it wasn't us it's God that
[52:05] did that what enables you to be here
[52:07] today what caused you to leave the life
[52:10] of sin and the things that you did and
[52:12] the things that you were and and
[52:14] everything that that you were in your
[52:16] life what caused you to be different
[52:18] today it's because the stronger man came
[52:21] in and he came in cast out the devil and
[52:24] all of his works I'm so grateful for
[52:26] that today because it's all by Grace
[52:28] there's no works at all in it but it's
[52:30] by the grace of almighty
[52:32] God so he says uh he he said if I cast
[52:36] out Devils by the word of God the Finger
[52:38] of God which he was the word of God who
[52:41] does your denominational Children cast
[52:43] them out by God and God Alone can cast
[52:46] out a devil for the strong man has to be
[52:49] stronger than the one in the house and
[52:52] we know that the strong man we saw that
[52:54] the strong man was in US
[52:57] right he that is in you in 1 John 4:4 he
[53:00] tells us he said ye are of God ye are of
[53:04] God it means you proceed from God you're
[53:07] a part of God right you come from his
[53:10] thoughts you are God's children you are
[53:14] of God little children and have overcome
[53:17] them because greater is he that is in
[53:21] you how many believe that this morning
[53:23] do you really believe that greater is he
[53:25] that is in in you and he that is in the
[53:28] world so greater is he than any trial or
[53:32] any circumstance or any uh any devil
[53:35] that I might face in my life you are of
[53:37] God you are his sons and his daughters
[53:40] you are the house of the stronger man
[53:44] The House of the one who can do all
[53:47] things there's nothing impossible to you
[53:49] do we really believe that today there is
[53:51] absolutely nothing no matter what it
[53:53] might be addiction or or or some kind of
[53:57] a of an evil spirit anxiety struggles of
[54:00] Life there is nothing that is too
[54:02] difficult for you because the stronger
[54:04] man is inside of you and he overcomes
[54:07] for you do we believe that today yes now
[54:11] the Bible says for as many as are led by
[54:14] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[54:17] God oh my and he said for you have not
[54:21] received the spirit of a a bondage again
[54:24] to fear so in other words you don't
[54:25] think like slaves but you have received
[54:29] the spirit of adoption you perceive
[54:32] yourself as a son or daughter of God
[54:35] you've got to move from a slave
[54:37] mentality to an adoption mentality uh
[54:41] where you know I have been saved I've
[54:43] been delivered I know that God is my
[54:45] father I know that if I ask him he'll
[54:48] give me what I desire so he said we have
[54:52] removed ourselves we've not received the
[54:54] spirit of bondage to fear but we
[54:56] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[54:58] we cry Abba which is just father father
[55:03] so the spirit of adoption the stronger
[55:05] Man cast out the spirit of fear in 1
[55:09] John 4:18 there is no fear someone say
[55:12] no
[55:13] fear there is no fear in love but
[55:18] perfect love casteth out fear so the
[55:24] perfect love is the stronger man yeah
[55:28] right that is the stronger man that cast
[55:31] out fear because fear hath torment he's
[55:34] not talking about Godly fear which is
[55:36] respect but he's talking about that
[55:38] thing that makes you scared and makes
[55:40] you believe you can't live the word you
[55:42] can't do what God says you can't be a
[55:44] Christian right the fear that says I'll
[55:47] never make it the fear that says I'll
[55:48] never be good enough the fear that says
[55:50] I've done too much in my past and I I
[55:52] I've I've burnt too many bridges I'll
[55:54] never be able to make it back that fear
[55:56] that's in your mind that may maybe I
[55:57] won't make a Rapture maybe things won't
[55:59] be okay for me what is that fear that
[56:01] fear has torment but the perfect love
[56:05] casts that out because you believe God's
[56:07] going to take care of you when you're in
[56:09] love with God when you love God when
[56:11] that love of God is in you you believe
[56:13] that he'll take care of you so there is
[56:17] no fear in love perfect love cast out
[56:22] fear right perfect love is divine love
[56:27] which is Christ the word in his fullness
[56:32] I want us to think through this this
[56:33] morning because it's important that we
[56:36] understand uh what we're talking about
[56:39] you realize that when you're born again
[56:42] you're not immediately everything you're
[56:44] going to be in God right you're born as
[56:47] a baby right right and so sometimes we
[56:50] get frustrated with ourselves because we
[56:51] think well you know I'm not where I want
[56:53] to be but are you farther along than you
[56:56] used to be can you look back at where
[56:59] you came from and see that God's done
[57:02] something in your life if you can see
[57:04] that you know God's working in your life
[57:07] so don't deny what's already happened
[57:09] but reach out and say Lord I want more I
[57:12] I want more of the Holy Ghost I want
[57:13] more godliness I want more Holiness I
[57:16] want more of God in my life I want more
[57:17] of the word in my life I don't want to
[57:19] deny what's already done in my life but
[57:21] I want more of you so we grow up in
[57:25] Christ so we have this Divine love
[57:28] inside of us by the New Birth by being
[57:31] born again which he said repent be
[57:32] baptized every one of you in the name of
[57:34] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[57:36] gift of the Holy Ghost we know that the
[57:37] gift of the Holy Ghost is Christ himself
[57:39] the literal life of Jesus Christ which
[57:41] is the new birth so when it looks like
[57:45] everything has gone wrong because you're
[57:48] going to face trials in life even as a
[57:50] Christan Christianity is not a ticket
[57:53] it's not a golden ticket to Wily Wonka's
[57:55] chocolate factory
[57:57] right it's not going to get you in then
[57:59] you get everything you want but even the
[58:01] Chocolate Factory didn't turn out to be
[58:03] everything they thought it would be but
[58:05] but it's not a golden ticket it's not
[58:07] just going to set you on a flowery bed
[58:09] of East but there's going to be trouble
[58:11] there's going to be trials there's going
[58:13] to be situation cuz you're human we live
[58:15] in a fallen world we live in a world of
[58:18] briers and thorns and thistles we live
[58:20] in that world but we come to that world
[58:22] to be tested and when it looks like
[58:24] everything has gone wrong
[58:26] God is giving you a trial oh
[58:30] Church Gabe it's so good to see you and
[58:32] Millie and the baby here this morning
[58:35] God's done so much for you all when God
[58:37] gave you a trial he would he had
[58:40] confidence in you that you'd be able to
[58:42] take it are you hearing me today some of
[58:44] y'all know what I'm talking about you
[58:46] went through what you went through and
[58:47] you were able to make it through because
[58:49] God had confidence in
[58:51] you he got confidence in you he don't
[58:54] have to baby you around
[58:56] he he's you you're not a hotbed plant a
[58:59] hybrid you're a real Christian so God is
[59:03] giving you a test to see what you'll do
[59:06] about it remember when he went and found
[59:08] job job was not the worst Christian you
[59:11] say well I'm going through this trial
[59:13] because I'm the worst Christian there is
[59:15] that's not why job went through the
[59:17] trial he went through he was actually
[59:19] the best
[59:21] Christian the best believer the one who
[59:24] did things the best the one who was
[59:26] blessed the most and he and he went to
[59:29] job Satan went to before God and God
[59:32] said have you considered job for a trial
[59:36] have you considered putting job through
[59:38] some things why had confidence that he
[59:40] would stand the test he does trials do
[59:42] not come to you because you're the worst
[59:44] Christian or because you've done
[59:45] something wrong but because you're one
[59:47] of God's
[59:48] best right he has confidence in you he
[59:51] don't have to baby you around Wonder
[59:54] Peter said these fiery trials why
[59:56] counted a joy it's more precious to you
[59:59] than
[1:00:00] gold you know I'd like to have some gold
[1:00:04] they don't know whether there's any
[1:00:04] golden Fort knock or not but there's
[1:00:07] there's gold I'd like to have some of
[1:00:08] that if there is but he said trials are
[1:00:11] more precious to
[1:00:12] you than gold so James 1:2 which is
[1:00:16] where I want to go this morning says my
[1:00:19] brethren count it all
[1:00:22] joy when you fall into diverse or many
[1:00:26] kinds of
[1:00:28] Temptations count it that word count is
[1:00:31] a word that means regard
[1:00:34] consider lead it it actually is
[1:00:37] translated in the King James version
[1:00:39] sometimes as governor in fact in Matthew
[1:00:41] 2:6 where he says Thou Bethlehem the in
[1:00:44] the land of Judah are not art not the
[1:00:46] least among the princes of
[1:00:47] Judah for out of thee shall come a
[1:00:50] governor a governor what is that that is
[1:00:54] a a leader and so he's
[1:00:57] regarded as a leader he is a leader a
[1:01:00] governor a controller that shall rule My
[1:01:03] People Israel so the idea in the
[1:01:05] scripture that Jame the way James is
[1:01:08] using it he said my brethren govern your
[1:01:12] thoughts in this manner lead your
[1:01:16] thoughts with this count it
[1:01:20] Joy
[1:01:22] right it's like your thoughts are are or
[1:01:26] a herd of of
[1:01:28] cattle and he said you need to Corral
[1:01:30] them with this lead them with this or
[1:01:34] maybe with some of us more like a herd
[1:01:36] of
[1:01:38] cats right it's very hard to catch up
[1:01:41] with them and so you got thoughts
[1:01:43] running this way and that way and that
[1:01:45] way and one tells you this and one tells
[1:01:47] you that we had goats when I was a kid
[1:01:49] and and uh we had uh we had a difficult
[1:01:53] time catching up with our goats
[1:01:54] sometimes I remember one particular
[1:01:57] night that the goats got out and and and
[1:02:00] and we were trying to catch them but you
[1:02:01] know some of the younger kids were
[1:02:02] actually scaring them away they didn't
[1:02:04] want the goats to get caught and because
[1:02:07] it was fun to them but we're running all
[1:02:09] over the farm trying to catch the goats
[1:02:10] I remember we had Pigs and the pigs got
[1:02:12] out and and we trying to catch the pigs
[1:02:15] as well it's very difficult sometimes
[1:02:17] that's the way it feels I need to go to
[1:02:19] church but I need to get control of my
[1:02:22] thoughts I I need to I need to I want to
[1:02:24] live for the Lord I want do the right
[1:02:26] thing but my thoughts are just going
[1:02:28] like this so he says when you're going
[1:02:31] through a trial count lead your thoughts
[1:02:36] with joy count it Joy control your
[1:02:41] thoughts and say I I consider this Joy
[1:02:46] because it's not going to feel like
[1:02:49] Joy
[1:02:51] right right see because Hebrews 12:11
[1:02:54] says now no chastening for the present
[1:02:58] seeth to be
[1:03:00] joyous right it's not going to feel like
[1:03:02] Joy so the idea is you control your
[1:03:05] thought have a different thought than
[1:03:07] what your senses tell you to have right
[1:03:12] your when you woke up this morning your
[1:03:13] senses might have told you oh my I
[1:03:16] forgot that it was time to change the
[1:03:19] clock to spring forward your senses
[1:03:22] might have put you in a bad attitude or
[1:03:24] a grumpy mood
[1:03:26] right your your your feelings maybe your
[1:03:28] body hurt maybe maybe you've you've been
[1:03:31] hurt in spirit in some way are you mad
[1:03:34] at your wife or mad at your husband or
[1:03:37] God forbid you know it should be that
[1:03:40] Christians you know sometimes get get
[1:03:42] sideways with people or you got
[1:03:44] something going on and and so it doesn't
[1:03:46] seem like what you're going through is
[1:03:50] joyful at all it doesn't seem like what
[1:03:53] you're going through are you hear me
[1:03:54] this morning doesn't seem like it'll
[1:03:56] help you at all do you don't see a way
[1:03:58] out you don't see a future you don't see
[1:04:00] even the next step but remember he's got
[1:04:03] a map that you don't have he he knows
[1:04:05] every part of your life he knows exactly
[1:04:08] what's coming next time and what's
[1:04:09] coming after that he knows what tomorrow
[1:04:11] holds and we don't know right so it
[1:04:14] don't seem to be joyous but Grievous
[1:04:16] nevertheless afterward someone say
[1:04:18] afterward afterward it yith the
[1:04:21] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:04:23] them which are exercised thereby it
[1:04:27] doesn't seem to be joyous but count it
[1:04:31] Joy right arrange your
[1:04:34] brain now he said well I I can't do that
[1:04:38] but that's why we got to be filled with
[1:04:39] the word right that's why we got to eat
[1:04:41] the word that's why we got to yield to
[1:04:44] the greater one because then he becomes
[1:04:47] the controller of our of our thoughts
[1:04:50] and even the the things that we would
[1:04:52] think and you can't help thoughts from
[1:04:54] coming through but that thought gets
[1:04:57] arrested and controlled by the stronger
[1:05:01] one so it doesn't seem to be Joy but
[1:05:04] counted Joy listen to the way this
[1:05:06] happened there such a marvelous example
[1:05:08] of it in Acts chapter 5 and verse 40
[1:05:11] that the disciples had joy in
[1:05:14] persecution it says to him they agreed
[1:05:16] and when they had called the apostles
[1:05:18] and beaten
[1:05:21] them they beat them and they didn't just
[1:05:24] take them and SP them the way we spank
[1:05:26] our children sometimes but they actually
[1:05:29] took them and beat them with a whip till
[1:05:32] they were
[1:05:33] bloody and Stripes were on their back
[1:05:37] they beat them they commanded that they
[1:05:39] should not speak in the name of
[1:05:42] Jesus and they let them
[1:05:44] go and they departed from the presence
[1:05:47] of the
[1:05:48] counsel
[1:05:50] rejoicing you talk about having your
[1:05:52] having your priorities right not
[1:05:55] rejoicing that they were let go but
[1:05:58] rejoicing that they were counted worthy
[1:06:01] to suffer shame for his
[1:06:04] name it's difficult to Rejoice right in
[1:06:07] the pain but the stronger one had come
[1:06:10] in in Acts chapter 2 and they were
[1:06:12] filled with the Holy Ghost and so they
[1:06:14] they acted in a mature way they they
[1:06:16] acted in a way that's you know what
[1:06:18] we're glad that were able to do this
[1:06:20] they remembered the words of Jesus from
[1:06:23] Luke chap 6 at verse 2 he said blessed
[1:06:26] are ye when men shall hate you and when
[1:06:29] they shall separate you from their
[1:06:31] company oh I think some of us have been
[1:06:33] through some things like this blessed
[1:06:36] are you when when they separate you from
[1:06:38] their company and shall reproach you and
[1:06:40] cast out your name is evil for the son
[1:06:43] of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day and
[1:06:49] leap for
[1:06:50] Joy right we like to jump When the
[1:06:53] Music's good and we like to jump when
[1:06:56] when the presence of God's there and
[1:06:57] people will jump and Shout right but he
[1:07:00] said the time to jump and leap for Joy
[1:07:03] is actually when you go through a trial
[1:07:06] Oh my he said when you when you are
[1:07:08] persecuted when people think the wrong
[1:07:10] things about you when they don't when
[1:07:12] they misunderstand you when they put you
[1:07:14] out from their company when they
[1:07:16] reproach you and cast your name as evil
[1:07:18] and call you Holy Rollers or call you a
[1:07:21] cult or something like that in that time
[1:07:23] rejoice in that day
[1:07:26] oh I hope you're hearing me today in
[1:07:28] that day when they say that when they
[1:07:30] say you can't do nothing right in that
[1:07:32] day when they say you'll never make it
[1:07:33] leap for Joy yeah why because your
[1:07:36] thoughts are ordered by the word for
[1:07:39] behold your reward is great in heaven
[1:07:41] for in the like manner did their fathers
[1:07:44] unto the prophets I don't say you'll
[1:07:46] feel like rejoicing right but your
[1:07:48] thoughts will be led and governed by the
[1:07:51] word dwelling in you by the baptism of
[1:07:53] the Holy Ghost so we count it all joy we
[1:07:56] count the difficulty joy we count the
[1:07:59] the hospital State Joy we count the
[1:08:01] persecution joy we count the trouble Joy
[1:08:05] are you with me now it don't mean you'll
[1:08:07] always be happy sometimes you won't be
[1:08:10] happy but you count it Joy right you
[1:08:13] choose to be joyful you choose to be
[1:08:15] happy you choose to enjoy the moment
[1:08:18] that you have instead of worrying about
[1:08:20] the time that you don't have right right
[1:08:23] why why spoil the present wor about a
[1:08:25] future you can't control
[1:08:27] anyway right you got no control over
[1:08:30] what tomorrow holds you might as well
[1:08:32] enjoy what God has done for you today
[1:08:34] and even though I might be in pain even
[1:08:36] though I've gone through a great trial
[1:08:37] yet I know that my God will take care of
[1:08:40] me I know he's the same yesterday today
[1:08:42] and forever I know in the in the end
[1:08:44] it'll work out for good why do I know it
[1:08:47] because his Spirit lives in me and
[1:08:48] governs my thoughts and because I have
[1:08:51] have grown into this place where I
[1:08:54] recognize right this is for my good
[1:08:57] right so the stronger man in US cast out
[1:09:02] depression anxiety worry
[1:09:05] fear right he's the word right how many
[1:09:09] believe that today Christ is the word
[1:09:10] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:09:12] with God the Word was God the word was
[1:09:14] made flesh and dwelt Among Us the the
[1:09:16] stronger Man cast out these things and
[1:09:19] so David said order my steps in thy word
[1:09:24] he said I want to do what your word says
[1:09:26] to I want to live what your word says
[1:09:28] live and that don't just mean that the
[1:09:30] way you dress or the way you act but are
[1:09:33] not smoking or drinking or something
[1:09:34] like that but it also means when you go
[1:09:36] through a trial to have a rejoicing in
[1:09:39] your heart a joy in your heart what is
[1:09:41] it because you're living by the
[1:09:43] word I'm not minimizing the trial we're
[1:09:47] not trying to say that you'll never that
[1:09:49] you'll never hurt right or that you
[1:09:51] won't cry or that sometimes you won't
[1:09:53] have to you won't have to rest or or or
[1:09:56] or just move away from it for a while
[1:09:58] cuz you your your your your body your
[1:10:00] mind can't handle it we're not saying
[1:10:02] that what we're saying is in the end
[1:10:04] you'll recognize this was good for me
[1:10:07] this is what God is doing in my
[1:10:10] life see either the stronger man will
[1:10:16] control your
[1:10:17] thoughts or the strong man the devil
[1:10:20] will regain a
[1:10:22] foothold in your mind he can't get to
[1:10:24] your soul that's been sealed away right
[1:10:27] once you are born again there's no going
[1:10:29] back you can't be lost but he can get to
[1:10:33] your mind and try to mes mess up your
[1:10:37] mind and govern your thoughts in your
[1:10:40] mind but we have to yield to the word
[1:10:42] now a a lack of control over our
[1:10:46] thoughts if that goes to an extreme form
[1:10:49] that's
[1:10:50] Insanity right that's people that are
[1:10:53] insane they just cannot control their
[1:10:55] thought thoughts and impulses they just
[1:10:57] have no
[1:10:58] Governor over that right and so whatever
[1:11:02] they feel they do or whatever they think
[1:11:04] they
[1:11:05] say but
[1:11:08] Christians are not just to be sane the
[1:11:12] gospel will not only make you sane but
[1:11:14] it'll actually it'll make you of a sound
[1:11:17] mind but it'll actually be more than
[1:11:18] that there'll be an inexplicable
[1:11:20] something inside of you that holds you
[1:11:24] in very difficult moments are you still
[1:11:26] with me this
[1:11:27] morning so the word is a is a government
[1:11:30] of the mind if you could think about it
[1:11:32] like that and so you get to tell or
[1:11:35] decide which thoughts stay in the mind
[1:11:40] and and so you get to a place in in
[1:11:43] Christ where yet you still suffer you
[1:11:46] still hurt you still struggle yeah but
[1:11:50] your circumstances do not control you
[1:11:54] you control control your
[1:11:57] circumstances right so it's not that
[1:12:00] well you know I'm in pain but I'm still
[1:12:03] going to do everything I can do and
[1:12:05] leave the rest to God right you may be
[1:12:08] getting older but you're still going to
[1:12:10] walk as much as you can't walk why you
[1:12:12] can't walk you're going to your
[1:12:14] footsteps find their way to the house of
[1:12:16] God why because well you say well I'm in
[1:12:18] pain I would have a right to say home
[1:12:20] yes you would but why do you come and I
[1:12:22] commend you for that you come because do
[1:12:25] not let your circumstances control you
[1:12:27] and us young Christians need to learn
[1:12:30] that that we do not let our
[1:12:32] circumstances control what we do when it
[1:12:35] comes to the house of God I'll still
[1:12:36] pray even if I'm going through the trial
[1:12:38] of my life I'll still cry out to God
[1:12:41] I'll still go to church even when it's
[1:12:43] tough to go even when it's difficult
[1:12:45] even when things are going wrong I'll
[1:12:47] still do what God says do I do not let
[1:12:50] my circumstances control me I control my
[1:12:53] circumstances
[1:12:55] that's good brother BR you know had a
[1:12:57] baby that
[1:12:58] died
[1:13:00] and her name was Sharon Rose and it's a
[1:13:04] tough thing to lose he lost his wife and
[1:13:06] his baby to TB tuberclosis
[1:13:10] and I thank God for that that's not as
[1:13:14] common as it used to be I do thank God
[1:13:16] for modern medicine in that way that
[1:13:18] that's not as common as it used to be
[1:13:21] because it was a terrible
[1:13:23] disease and
[1:13:26] he lost his wife and then his baby it
[1:13:29] must it was a very dark time in his life
[1:13:31] Satan tried to tell him that God didn't
[1:13:33] love him he said he was too late to tell
[1:13:34] him that God wasn't real because he'd
[1:13:36] seen too much but he tried to tell him
[1:13:38] God didn't love him he named that baby
[1:13:41] Sharon Rose I was listening to a to a
[1:13:43] sermon the other day brother brandom
[1:13:45] said and and he had been so
[1:13:49] broken by even telling his story he says
[1:13:52] this at the end of of his life story he
[1:13:54] said I love you dear Jesus you've broken
[1:13:57] my heart over and over but I love you
[1:14:00] for it that quotes always meant a lot to
[1:14:03] me because that's I'm controlling my
[1:14:06] thoughts I can't help but feel sad but
[1:14:09] I'm counting it Joy you broken my heart
[1:14:12] over and over but I love you for it so
[1:14:16] but I was listening to a sermon where
[1:14:17] brother Brandon was doing baby
[1:14:18] dedications and as the babies come up
[1:14:21] there was a little baby come up who was
[1:14:23] the same age and looked the same as his
[1:14:27] daughter had 20 years
[1:14:30] before and so they bring the little baby
[1:14:32] up and he said what's the baby's name I
[1:14:36] don't know if I could have handled this
[1:14:38] but they told him Sharon
[1:14:40] Rose Sharon Rose I I think I'd have just
[1:14:43] turned around and walked
[1:14:45] off because it's not they were they were
[1:14:47] trying to be they weren't trying to be
[1:14:49] mean or anything like that they were
[1:14:51] trying to honor that baby giving it the
[1:14:52] same name but brother to brother brand
[1:14:55] that had to hurt and he remarked he said
[1:14:57] she looks about the same age looks has
[1:15:00] the same color eyes looks like Sharon
[1:15:03] Rose I thought it must have been a very
[1:15:05] difficult situation to be in but you
[1:15:09] don't notice it on the tape he doesn't
[1:15:11] he takes a little extra time with that
[1:15:13] baby but he prays for that baby he said
[1:15:15] Lord may this child grow up he said
[1:15:19] though you chose to take Sharon and make
[1:15:22] her a rose in your garden he said may
[1:15:23] this child live
[1:15:25] though you chose to take mine that's a
[1:15:28] mature attitude towards a
[1:15:31] trial right not that if I suffer I want
[1:15:34] everybody else to suffer with me but
[1:15:37] though I've suffered though I've been
[1:15:39] through it though I've struggled in that
[1:15:41] way I don't want anybody else to suffer
[1:15:44] not even people who are insensitive or
[1:15:46] something else but I want the good for
[1:15:48] them why because I've come to the place
[1:15:50] where the my circumstances do not
[1:15:52] control the way I treat others right my
[1:15:56] Brokenness will not make me break others
[1:15:59] my pain will not me not make me cause
[1:16:01] others pain all right because what is it
[1:16:04] the stronger one is in the house and
[1:16:07] he's greater than he that is in the
[1:16:09] world yes sir Peter says it this way he
[1:16:12] said beloved think it not strange
[1:16:16] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:16:18] try you as though some strange thing
[1:16:21] happened unto you but rejoice in as much
[1:16:25] as you are partakers of Christ's
[1:16:27] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[1:16:30] revealed you may be glad also with
[1:16:33] exceeding Joy so he's tying the story of
[1:16:36] your trial to the story of the death
[1:16:38] burial and resurrection of Christ he's
[1:16:40] saying if you made it through your trial
[1:16:42] right right you you'll make it through
[1:16:44] the trial as Jesus died and and and was
[1:16:48] buried and and was there in the grave he
[1:16:50] was dead he was dead he was buried he
[1:16:52] was actually dead he was actually buried
[1:16:55] but he rose again on the third day and
[1:16:57] has he overcome you'll also overcome
[1:16:59] right as he made it through his trial
[1:17:02] you'll also make it through your trial
[1:17:05] right don't think it's strange as though
[1:17:07] some strange thing happened but Rejoice
[1:17:09] your partakers in his suffering that
[1:17:11] when his glory should be revealed you
[1:17:13] may be glad also with exceeding Joy the
[1:17:17] resurrection tells us that there is a
[1:17:19] future beyond the pain a future that we
[1:17:23] can't control but the word does Jesus
[1:17:26] went into the ground believing the
[1:17:28] scripture and said I will not suffer my
[1:17:30] Holy One to seek corruption and he
[1:17:32] raised again on the third day and you've
[1:17:34] got to go into your trial believing
[1:17:37] God's going to raise me up he's the one
[1:17:39] who heals all my diseases are you with
[1:17:41] me today Church he's the one who's going
[1:17:43] to bring me out
[1:17:46] right and we
[1:17:48] know that he has looked at every
[1:17:51] possible outcome I want you to think
[1:17:54] about this yeah
[1:17:56] you know how you try to do that when you
[1:17:58] go to make a major decision you you want
[1:18:01] to look at what could possibly
[1:18:03] happen right so you go over in your mind
[1:18:05] if I buy this
[1:18:08] boat right what are the things that
[1:18:12] could take
[1:18:14] place am I going to have to work more to
[1:18:17] pay for
[1:18:18] it is it within my budget you know if I
[1:18:22] have to fix it do I have time to go on
[1:18:24] the is my wife going to dislike the fact
[1:18:28] that I spend my time on the water
[1:18:31] because a lot of times things have
[1:18:32] unintended
[1:18:33] consequences right that's why every time
[1:18:36] they make a decision in Washington you
[1:18:38] know it has unintended
[1:18:40] consequences right you you fire the
[1:18:42] wrong person or you hire the wrong
[1:18:44] person or you write the wrong law and
[1:18:47] they think well this is good but in the
[1:18:49] end it turns out actually to be
[1:18:51] something that hurts the very thing they
[1:18:53] were trying to help why is that it's not
[1:18:56] necessarily because we are uh it's not
[1:18:59] necessarily because we are uh trying to
[1:19:02] do bad things it's normally because we
[1:19:04] just don't see it right we just can't
[1:19:07] see it but when God puts you through a
[1:19:09] trial he sees every possible outcome
[1:19:15] amen I hope you're hearing me and he
[1:19:18] knows which one is going to happen so
[1:19:22] it's not just that he sees it every
[1:19:24] everything that could happen he knows
[1:19:27] exactly what will happen right right
[1:19:30] because he's the omniscient God he knows
[1:19:32] all things so he looked at the trial so
[1:19:36] whatever that it was sickness or the
[1:19:38] loss of a loved one or whatever God saw
[1:19:42] that trial before you come to it and he
[1:19:45] said I'm going to put Landon through
[1:19:48] this but he said I know when he comes
[1:19:51] out the other end he's not hoping that
[1:19:54] you'll be okay he saw you
[1:19:59] okay I hope you're hear me this morning
[1:20:02] he's already
[1:20:04] knows he's not hoping said well I put
[1:20:07] him through a trial and I'll just wait
[1:20:08] and see what they do with it no he
[1:20:10] already knew that he was going to be the
[1:20:12] fourth man in the fire all right he
[1:20:14] already knew that he was going to be
[1:20:15] there with with the the Lions and the
[1:20:17] lion Den Lions he already knew that he
[1:20:20] wasn't supposing that maybe if things
[1:20:23] got too tough for them that he would
[1:20:25] come down that was already his plan it
[1:20:27] was already his plan to put joanah in
[1:20:29] the belly of a whale but then for him to
[1:20:31] come out and the ninevites believe
[1:20:33] because he come out of a whale's belly
[1:20:35] it was already his plan to type the
[1:20:37] death burial and resurrection of Christ
[1:20:38] in that it was already in God's mind so
[1:20:42] whatever trial you go through no matter
[1:20:44] how big it is no matter how small it is
[1:20:46] you see but you don't understand the
[1:20:47] things that happened in my life do we
[1:20:49] believe that God knows everything or not
[1:20:51] and do we believe that God cares about
[1:20:53] us or he don't and if if he does care
[1:20:55] about us if he does know all things then
[1:20:57] he said what what he say in Romans 8:28
[1:20:59] we know can we say that this morning we
[1:21:02] know that all things work together for
[1:21:05] good to them that love God to them who
[1:21:07] are the called according to his purpose
[1:21:09] why we know that he knows yeah good are
[1:21:13] you with me
[1:21:15] now and so therefore because we love him
[1:21:19] we trust him now this trial is not
[1:21:22] judgment it's for my Perfection job said
[1:21:26] though he slay me yet I'll trust him but
[1:21:30] I'll maintain my own ways before him in
[1:21:33] other words he said I'm not going to
[1:21:34] call myself a
[1:21:36] sinner right why he'd already made a
[1:21:39] sacrifice for his
[1:21:41] sins though he slay me I'll trust him
[1:21:43] but I'll maintain my own ways before him
[1:21:46] he also shall be my salvation for a
[1:21:51] hypocrite shall not come before him in
[1:21:53] other words I've not come hypocritically
[1:21:55] I've come and and trusted in the
[1:21:58] sacrifice that I've made as an antidote
[1:22:01] for my sins I know he is My Sacrifice I
[1:22:05] know my sins are under the blood
[1:22:07] therefore any thought that would be
[1:22:08] contrary to that is governed by his
[1:22:11] word and says this must be for my
[1:22:16] good so in order for our thoughts to be
[1:22:19] governed in this way the stronger man
[1:22:21] must be in the house right the the the
[1:22:24] strong man the devil has to be kicked
[1:22:25] out and the stronger man has got to live
[1:22:28] in the house in your heart and we must
[1:22:31] be mature enough to allow him to do what
[1:22:35] he sees as
[1:22:38] best
[1:22:40] so think about it like this a small
[1:22:43] child left alone will never make good
[1:22:49] choices an't that odd you just thought
[1:22:52] well I'll just leave my child in his
[1:22:54] room and he's going to clean
[1:22:56] it very seldom if he does he's probably
[1:23:00] been told to do it or look or he's
[1:23:01] trying to impress somebody right but I'm
[1:23:04] talking about a very small child one of
[1:23:06] the ways that you know maturity is when
[1:23:08] a child begins to make good
[1:23:10] choices for the sake of the for the sake
[1:23:13] of the good choices in other words begin
[1:23:15] to recognize if my room is clean things
[1:23:17] will be better for
[1:23:19] me right I won't get a
[1:23:22] whooping right mom won't be
[1:23:25] mad right if I do it so so you kids
[1:23:29] listen up now no small child ever said
[1:23:33] please let me eat my
[1:23:36] vegetables maybe some of them did I
[1:23:38] don't know most small
[1:23:40] children you know the ones that don't
[1:23:42] want sodas the ones who've never been
[1:23:43] exposed to it you
[1:23:45] know once they get a taste of sweet
[1:23:48] tea right they start wanting
[1:23:51] it and and they cry for it they'll do
[1:23:54] whatever it takes to get it yeah right
[1:23:57] because they believe that that that is
[1:24:01] the best thing that could possibly be
[1:24:04] when they get that Sugar Rush last night
[1:24:07] Joel was at my house and and his son
[1:24:09] decided he wanted
[1:24:11] coffee when did he go to sleep last
[1:24:15] night pretty early well maybe it has the
[1:24:17] opposite effect on
[1:24:19] it he he then he woke up he
[1:24:24] he decided he wanted coffee so they gave
[1:24:27] him a little bit of coffee and a whole
[1:24:28] lot of milk but but he's he's what two
[1:24:32] years old so he thinks that's the
[1:24:35] best right that's the best the sugar the
[1:24:39] caffeine I mean it is the best but
[1:24:41] beside
[1:24:42] that but it may not be healthy might not
[1:24:46] be the best thing for a
[1:24:48] 2-year-old right you put them in the
[1:24:51] house and just give them you just set a
[1:24:52] bucket of candy in the house they're
[1:24:54] going to eat eat it that's right right
[1:24:56] no child ever put themselves on a diet
[1:24:58] right you know just they're very young
[1:25:00] and and and and they usually don't need
[1:25:03] to because they run it
[1:25:04] off but children they'll never put on
[1:25:07] enough clothes when it's
[1:25:11] cold
[1:25:13] ever and they're at the bus stop and you
[1:25:15] know we used to be critical of people at
[1:25:17] the bus stop you know or the or the the
[1:25:19] line you know you get in the line at
[1:25:21] school and and you become critical of
[1:25:23] people because they're they're standing
[1:25:24] there and and uh uh you see kids with no
[1:25:27] coat on but they wore one to school they
[1:25:30] just don't still own
[1:25:32] it it's just like the fellowship hall
[1:25:34] over here it's how the lost and found
[1:25:35] gets filled up with
[1:25:37] stuff they wore one to church but
[1:25:39] there's no telling where it is now right
[1:25:42] you see that kid in shorts you know or
[1:25:44] little kid in shorts or something you
[1:25:45] think how in the world why did their
[1:25:46] parents they must have horrible
[1:25:48] parents but a lot of times just a kid
[1:25:51] decided what was best for them and and
[1:25:53] some parents just let them do whatever
[1:25:55] they think is best for them right but
[1:25:58] that's because they're
[1:26:00] children right they just don't know yet
[1:26:02] they're not mature enough to see right
[1:26:05] what is what the consequences of what
[1:26:08] they
[1:26:09] do I've told my kids if I have to tell
[1:26:11] you to clean your room you're probably
[1:26:13] not ready to be
[1:26:18] married
[1:26:20] right I'm just throwing that out there
[1:26:27] now why now the stronger man think about
[1:26:29] it like this he's the mature man yes
[1:26:33] right he's full
[1:26:34] grown now we brought up uh we brought up
[1:26:38] a couple of kids the other day we
[1:26:39] brought up trip is not really a kid but
[1:26:41] trip is full grown really and and then
[1:26:44] we've got we had Jason up here and we
[1:26:46] showed the difference between the two
[1:26:48] the stronger man the strong man Jas
[1:26:50] Jason might be strong but but trip was
[1:26:52] Stronger why is he stronger well what it
[1:26:55] might some of it might be jeans right
[1:26:56] just the way you're built but the
[1:26:58] biggest reason is he's
[1:27:01] older right and that's the biggest
[1:27:04] reason if you go pick a fight if you're
[1:27:06] 10 you go pick a fight with an 18y old
[1:27:08] you you might be in
[1:27:10] trouble right and you might be that
[1:27:13] mature someday but you're not
[1:27:16] now right the biggest difference is just
[1:27:18] maturity and so many times what we see
[1:27:20] in people's lives when they can't seem
[1:27:23] to make and just can't seem to come to
[1:27:25] church or they can't seem to do what
[1:27:27] they need to do and it's just a lack of
[1:27:30] maturity but don't give up on yourself
[1:27:32] there there's maturity for you but
[1:27:35] sometimes God has to put us through
[1:27:36] trials to to mature us to bring us up to
[1:27:39] build us up but the the way we ought to
[1:27:42] be built up is by the word yes that God
[1:27:44] would actually and the word would so
[1:27:46] become a part of our lives that we begin
[1:27:48] to be that stronger Christian so if I am
[1:27:52] the house of the stronger man
[1:27:55] and he lives in me why is it so
[1:27:58] difficult to count it all joy well it's
[1:28:00] because of maturity because he comes
[1:28:02] into us in a baby form but he grows in
[1:28:05] us as we yield ourselves to him a and
[1:28:09] that that that joy that you felt you
[1:28:11] remember what it was like to get saved
[1:28:13] you remember what that was like that was
[1:28:14] just a what what a wonderful feeling to
[1:28:16] all your sins are I see sister Fritz
[1:28:18] back the other hand up brother JT some
[1:28:20] of you Elders it was years ago but you
[1:28:22] remember what it was like the day you
[1:28:23] gave you you laid your sins on the Altar
[1:28:26] and that day when you gave it I remember
[1:28:27] what it was like yeah the day that I
[1:28:29] finally gave in and the Holy Ghost come
[1:28:32] down and baptize me I remember what it
[1:28:35] was like to be forgiven yes right for my
[1:28:37] life to change I I I know that feeling
[1:28:40] yeah but that feeling that you had that
[1:28:42] as great as it was is just in an infant
[1:28:46] form in your life do you realize that
[1:28:49] you are not born again a full born
[1:28:52] believer go listen to you must be born
[1:28:53] again but random tells us that you're
[1:28:55] not born again and immediately you're a
[1:28:57] full grown Christian but you're born of
[1:28:59] the spirit of God and then you grow into
[1:29:01] a full grown Christian yeah and you
[1:29:04] really you say well brother Ben when
[1:29:05] will I fully grow up when do I come to
[1:29:07] my full adoption at the change of the
[1:29:09] body right right but you do become
[1:29:12] mature enough that you're able to make
[1:29:15] it through things maybe used to you
[1:29:17] wouldn't have been able to make it
[1:29:18] through now again growing up is
[1:29:21] recognizing there consequences our
[1:29:22] Behavior brother Brandon says now he
[1:29:24] said to you people that wanted to renew
[1:29:25] the joy of your salvation how many would
[1:29:27] want more joy here today I think all of
[1:29:30] us could say that he said if you people
[1:29:32] want to renew the joy of your salvation
[1:29:34] he somewhere you've lost Joy think back
[1:29:36] what you did did you neglect prayer
[1:29:39] meeting neglect reading the Bible
[1:29:42] neglected praying at your home asking
[1:29:44] the blessing at the table you see that's
[1:29:45] a little thing but it's a little thing
[1:29:48] that mature people do right because they
[1:29:51] realize there's a blessing in it come on
[1:29:54] he said don't ever do that that's so
[1:29:55] Unbecoming to Christians no matter where
[1:29:56] you are bow your head and pray don't be
[1:29:59] ashamed of him pray anywhere amen he
[1:30:02] said if every where you left that Joy
[1:30:04] whatever weeded it out what little root
[1:30:06] of bitterness come in he said remember
[1:30:08] when a man is saved this much he said
[1:30:10] like a button so like the button you
[1:30:12] probably can't see that but like the
[1:30:13] button on your shirt right if you have a
[1:30:16] button on your shirt he said that's
[1:30:17] about how much that when you're saved he
[1:30:20] said that becomes eternal life in your
[1:30:22] heart that's God as you're able to push
[1:30:26] out all the roots of bitterness then God
[1:30:29] begins to spread in you then you become
[1:30:31] a Son of God man was made to be a god
[1:30:34] he's in the image of God he's given a a
[1:30:36] Dominion a domain over the Earth right
[1:30:39] he in in the beginning Genesis 1 126 he
[1:30:41] was given dominion over the over the
[1:30:44] Earth that he lived in he ruled over it
[1:30:46] he ruled over the an animal kingdom and
[1:30:48] all the other kingdoms he was an amateur
[1:30:50] God you could say because he was he was
[1:30:52] ruler over his Dominion what happened
[1:30:55] because he disbelieved God's word and
[1:30:57] sent him right back out to shift for
[1:30:58] himself he said but now God's trying to
[1:31:01] bring him back remember Satan's big lie
[1:31:05] to Eve what was it he told him he said
[1:31:09] he said You shall be as Gods yeah right
[1:31:13] he said you'll know good and evil but
[1:31:15] they already were yeah he was trying to
[1:31:18] sell them on a position that they
[1:31:20] already had oh he still does that today
[1:31:23] he still does that around the message
[1:31:24] trying to tell people well this is
[1:31:25] coming or that's coming or you need to
[1:31:27] wait on that he's trying to sell you
[1:31:28] something that you've already got yeah
[1:31:30] all right right he said when you when
[1:31:33] you have faith and accept him my brother
[1:31:34] just let that little light begin to grow
[1:31:36] out taking all the roots of doubt and
[1:31:37] bitterness yielding yourself to the
[1:31:39] spirit then you begin to be a Son of God
[1:31:41] a daughter of God begin to grow in the
[1:31:43] grace of God he said the Holy Spirit
[1:31:44] begins to build his kingdom within you
[1:31:47] but if you've grieve that Spirit
[1:31:48] somewhere how many know you can grieve
[1:31:50] the spirit of God right not to where
[1:31:53] he'll leave you for good but just where
[1:31:56] his influence is not in your life in the
[1:31:57] same way that's right he said then go
[1:32:00] right back and think in your mind what
[1:32:01] did I start doing neglecting Church did
[1:32:05] I start fussing with another
[1:32:06] denomination did I start picking on this
[1:32:09] one doing this to my neighbor if you did
[1:32:13] that's what sapped it
[1:32:14] out oh my go say God I'm sorry I'll go
[1:32:19] right back and make that thing right
[1:32:21] I'll go right and do it then the joy
[1:32:22] will come back to your salvation again
[1:32:24] he said the Holy Spirit just flew up on
[1:32:26] the rafter he's ready to fly right back
[1:32:28] down again anytime you want him to come
[1:32:31] back see we're we're not supposed to
[1:32:33] remain children just where we're
[1:32:34] constantly grieving the Holy
[1:32:36] Ghost but we're supposed to grow up yes
[1:32:40] Paul says everyone that uses milk is
[1:32:43] unskillful the word of righteous as you
[1:32:45] give a a baby a steak he won't know what
[1:32:48] to do with it only thing he can do is
[1:32:50] choke on
[1:32:51] it right he's a baby
[1:32:54] he said but strong meat belongeth to
[1:32:56] them that are of full age even those who
[1:33:00] by reason of use have their senses
[1:33:03] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:33:08] that's why God sends the ministry to us
[1:33:10] in Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostle
[1:33:12] and some prophets Apostles some prophets
[1:33:14] some evangelists some pastors and
[1:33:15] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:33:17] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:33:19] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:33:22] we all come in the unity of of the faith
[1:33:24] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:33:27] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:33:30] the stature of the fullness of Christ so
[1:33:34] he's saying till we come into this
[1:33:37] maturity that we henceforth be no more
[1:33:39] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:33:42] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:33:44] sight of men cunning craftiness whereby
[1:33:45] they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:33:47] speaking the truth and love may grow up
[1:33:49] someone say grow up
[1:33:51] GR I just had you say that so I can take
[1:33:53] a
[1:33:55] drink we'll be done here in just a
[1:33:57] minute but may grow up into him in All
[1:34:00] Things someone say all things which is
[1:34:03] the head even Christ from whom the whole
[1:34:05] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:34:07] by that which every joint Supply
[1:34:09] according to the effectual working in
[1:34:10] the measure of every part maketh
[1:34:13] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:34:15] of itself in love so brother random
[1:34:18] again teaches us that that white button
[1:34:21] like of eternal life starts in the heart
[1:34:24] and that's God that's just a way to put
[1:34:25] it right it's not literally a button
[1:34:27] it's the way to it's just a way to to
[1:34:29] make you understand he said that part is
[1:34:32] God when he's born again with the spirit
[1:34:33] of God God's spirit dwells in him now as
[1:34:36] he can let that Spirit grow and take out
[1:34:39] all the roots of bitterness and press
[1:34:41] God's way through him again he can
[1:34:43] become back this is phenomenal he can
[1:34:46] become back in the same condition that
[1:34:50] he was when he was in the garden yes of
[1:34:54] Eden yes see I believe you're a good
[1:34:56] church but we're not where we're
[1:34:57] supposed to be we won't be till we leave
[1:35:01] here right I believe you're good people
[1:35:03] I I try to be a good person I try to
[1:35:05] live for God I try believe I'm born
[1:35:07] again I believe I'm going to heaven but
[1:35:09] I'm not what I want to be there's room
[1:35:12] yet to grow right I got something left
[1:35:15] that God wants out of my life or I
[1:35:17] wouldn't be here so he said we can
[1:35:20] actually mature that that growth can
[1:35:22] happen in US until we come back in the
[1:35:25] same condition that man was in the
[1:35:28] garden of e of Eden so God raises the
[1:35:31] church up the same way we see how he
[1:35:33] raised them up from the Dark Ages
[1:35:34] through the Protestant Reformation and
[1:35:36] each age represented a different stage
[1:35:38] of maturity it's the the the if the corn
[1:35:41] of wheat falls into the ground and it
[1:35:42] begins to come up and it comes up a just
[1:35:45] a stalk and then it's a tossle and then
[1:35:47] it's a Shook and finally the grain but
[1:35:50] BR said now the Sun comes across and
[1:35:51] ripens the grain it cannot ripen it all
[1:35:54] it
[1:35:54] wants as it goes on maturing it
[1:35:57] constantly ripens someone say constantly
[1:36:00] constantly ripens until it comes to a
[1:36:02] full year so it is today with the church
[1:36:04] it started in its infancy back in the
[1:36:06] Dark Age where it was under the ground
[1:36:08] it's grown now into maturity the
[1:36:10] individual has to come up the same way
[1:36:12] church that's exactly where we're at
[1:36:14] we're to be restored Back to Eden man in
[1:36:17] full Authority full maturity he said
[1:36:20] that's impossible it's where he's taking
[1:36:22] us
[1:36:23] right and how how do you know because he
[1:36:25] did it when he was here and he was the
[1:36:28] man the firstborn among many Brethren
[1:36:31] and so we we are and we see that by the
[1:36:34] example of Jesus that we're not ruled by
[1:36:36] nature but we rule nature yeah right he
[1:36:41] stopped the storm peace be still so
[1:36:45] being a mature son or daughter of God is
[1:36:49] getting to the place where we're no
[1:36:51] longer tossed about we're no longer
[1:36:55] ruled by this
[1:36:57] nature but we rule this nature amen
[1:37:01] right it's growed up into maturity for
[1:37:05] the Bible says the I reckon the
[1:37:07] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:37:10] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:37:12] which will be revealed to us what's he
[1:37:13] saying I reckon I count I I I've
[1:37:16] marshaled my thoughts I've control them
[1:37:18] to believing that the sufferings are not
[1:37:20] worthy I I'm mature enough to County Joy
[1:37:23] Joy the Bible says for the earnest
[1:37:25] expectation of the creature wait is for
[1:37:27] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:37:31] brother brandom tells us this may choke
[1:37:32] you to death did you did you know men
[1:37:34] are the sons of God that are the sons of
[1:37:36] God are amateur gods and Jesus says that
[1:37:38] in John 10:34 he said it is not written
[1:37:40] is it not written in your law you are
[1:37:42] gods and we're not making oursel God but
[1:37:45] in the sense of you have control
[1:37:47] Dominion right over your environment
[1:37:49] over nature which God said in Genesis 2
[1:37:52] they were Gods cuz they were had domain
[1:37:54] over the Dominion of the world he give
[1:37:55] him dominion over all things he lost his
[1:37:58] godship lost his sunship lost his domain
[1:38:00] Satan took it over but brother we're
[1:38:02] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:38:04] sons of God who come back and taking it
[1:38:06] take it over again waiting for the
[1:38:08] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:38:11] up to the top when the full sons of God
[1:38:13] will be manifested when the power of God
[1:38:15] will walk out will take every Power that
[1:38:18] Satan's got away from him he said yes
[1:38:20] sir it belongs to him he made man of God
[1:38:22] a God in his and his domain goes from
[1:38:25] sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has
[1:38:27] the control of it so what am I saying
[1:38:28] everything in your life you you have the
[1:38:31] ability to speak to it and it'll
[1:38:34] actually move in God's timing right
[1:38:37] right it'll move in God's timing and
[1:38:41] then you just believe that it's for your
[1:38:44] good look he said when he when the winds
[1:38:47] blowed he said peace be still when the
[1:38:49] tree he said no man eat from thee he
[1:38:51] said verily I say unto you you that
[1:38:53] little Gods if you'll say to this
[1:38:55] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:38:56] your heart but believe that what you
[1:38:57] said will come to pass you can have what
[1:38:59] you said that's
[1:39:03] powerful go right back to Genesis to the
[1:39:05] original what is it now the world in
[1:39:07] nature is groan and crying everything's
[1:39:09] moving what for the manifestation of the
[1:39:11] sons of God when true Sons born Sons
[1:39:15] filled Sons speak and their word is
[1:39:19] backed see that's you become into
[1:39:22] adulthood you gain author Authority yeah
[1:39:25] right you back your word as as a as a
[1:39:27] parent you got to back your word right
[1:39:30] if you say something you you got to back
[1:39:32] it up your kids got to believe that you
[1:39:34] mean what you
[1:39:35] say and God does the same thing but he
[1:39:38] won't back the word of a
[1:39:40] baby right he doesn't back the word of a
[1:39:42] baby he backs the word of full born born
[1:39:45] Sons true Sons filled sons are you with
[1:39:49] me now we want to get to where the word
[1:39:51] backs us up right to be so mature that
[1:39:54] the word backs us up when we speak where
[1:39:57] we're not vulnerable to man's ideas
[1:39:59] we're not moved by dogmas and Creeds and
[1:40:01] spirits and emotions and and Sensations
[1:40:04] that come contrary to the word but we're
[1:40:06] true Sons born Sons filled Sons we're
[1:40:08] not babies anymore right right and
[1:40:11] that's what the message of the hour has
[1:40:13] brought us to that's the time that we're
[1:40:14] living in we're a mature bunch of people
[1:40:18] and I'm not just talking about your a
[1:40:19] your age I'm not calling you old but I
[1:40:21] believe all of us have a maturity
[1:40:22] because of the age that we live in
[1:40:24] beyond what people used to have because
[1:40:27] of the time so Paul is speaking to a
[1:40:30] Corinthian Church in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:40:33] who refused to grow up and if you go and
[1:40:37] you can read the whole thing later but
[1:40:39] Paul actually if you read 1 Corinthians
[1:40:42] 13 how many knows what that is that's
[1:40:43] the love chapter right so if you read 1
[1:40:46] Corinthians 13 Paul is describing the
[1:40:49] opposite of the behavior of somebody
[1:40:52] Jonah's age
[1:40:53] or I won't call your other
[1:40:58] children that's what he's doing read 1
[1:41:00] Corinthians 13 charity suffereth long
[1:41:04] babies don't do that right and is kind
[1:41:09] right babies are not
[1:41:10] longsuffering toddlers are not
[1:41:12] longsuffering
[1:41:14] right but mature adults can be by the
[1:41:18] maturity of the
[1:41:20] word charity envieth not
[1:41:23] huh but you better not take that toy
[1:41:25] away from that child or have someone
[1:41:27] else have a better one you ever been in
[1:41:29] Walmart picking out Christmas presents
[1:41:30] you better you better get them something
[1:41:33] similar right or something at least that
[1:41:34] costs as much why they Envy right but a
[1:41:38] mature Christian envieth not right right
[1:41:42] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:41:45] itself doesn't brag it's not puffed up
[1:41:49] right but but you find a child will say
[1:41:52] are we there yet
[1:41:54] five minutes later Are We There
[1:41:56] Yet 10 minutes later are we there yet
[1:42:00] they know they're not there they know
[1:42:01] they're not
[1:42:02] close but it's just
[1:42:05] immaturity a child will come to you and
[1:42:07] I I actually love this but they'll come
[1:42:09] to you say look what I did right you
[1:42:11] could be talking to a bunch of adults
[1:42:12] about something important and Bo but
[1:42:14] they got to show you they put that Lego
[1:42:16] set together and tell you what it is cuz
[1:42:19] you can't tell what it isless they tell
[1:42:22] you that play though that they put
[1:42:24] together they've got to do that why do
[1:42:26] they feel the need to do that they feel
[1:42:28] a need to be important it's part of
[1:42:31] growing up it's finding a child right
[1:42:34] but we want to be better than that are
[1:42:36] you with me now no are we there yet or
[1:42:39] look what I did Charity does not behave
[1:42:41] itself we know charity is agape love
[1:42:43] divine love does not behave itself
[1:42:47] unseemly the opposite of a child in
[1:42:51] church
[1:42:53] I'm not picking on your kids we we love
[1:42:55] the kids I'm so glad to hear them cry
[1:42:58] because I know we got children in the
[1:43:01] church but charity love does not behave
[1:43:03] itself unseemly if a 40-year old man
[1:43:05] acts like that you begin to think weird
[1:43:07] about him you
[1:43:08] know something going
[1:43:10] on charity seeketh not her
[1:43:13] own not selfish it's not easily
[1:43:19] provoked we can stop there for a while
[1:43:22] think no evil right all
[1:43:26] right not thin
[1:43:28] skinned I know a lot of preachers that
[1:43:30] need to grow
[1:43:31] up just leave that one
[1:43:35] there charity love rejoices not in
[1:43:38] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth yes
[1:43:43] they don't relish evil things happening
[1:43:45] to others beareth all things believeth
[1:43:48] all things hopeth all things endureth
[1:43:50] all things love never fails right I love
[1:43:54] that prophecies fail tongue Sil will
[1:43:57] cease and there will be knowledge will
[1:43:59] pass away but love never
[1:44:02] fails we know in part we prophesy in
[1:44:05] part but when that which is perfect what
[1:44:07] does that mean when the maturity comes
[1:44:10] then that which is in part should be
[1:44:11] done away when I was a child I spake as
[1:44:13] a child I understood as a child I
[1:44:15] thought as a child but when I become a
[1:44:17] man I put away childish things but now
[1:44:20] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[1:44:22] face to face now I know in part but then
[1:44:24] shall I know even as also I am known now
[1:44:27] abideth faith hope and charity these
[1:44:29] three but the greatest of these is
[1:44:30] Charity I want to show you I think I've
[1:44:32] got a a picture of that drawing I'm not
[1:44:35] sure if it's right here if it's later on
[1:44:39] yes look at the drawing that Brother
[1:44:41] brandom D Drew out about the church ages
[1:44:44] and how it typed the virtues in second
[1:44:46] Peter chapter 1 you can go and read and
[1:44:48] study that later I don't have time this
[1:44:50] morning but it's the stature of a
[1:44:52] perfect man or a sure man and and it he
[1:44:55] put it in a pyramid form with love at
[1:44:57] the top being the seventh virtue being
[1:45:00] the one at the top and that being Christ
[1:45:04] at the top and then the churches down
[1:45:07] below and so uh and and actually the the
[1:45:10] the Seven Virtues in the eighth is is
[1:45:12] love is divine love so uh Peter goes
[1:45:15] through those and tells us if these be
[1:45:17] in you and abound he said you'll you you
[1:45:19] you'll you'll never fall oh I want to be
[1:45:22] in that place where I never fall but
[1:45:24] what's at the top love why because
[1:45:28] Divine love is the most mature
[1:45:31] thing right that's why we want our
[1:45:33] children to be mature before they go
[1:45:36] into any
[1:45:37] relationships yes right because love has
[1:45:41] to be a mature thing because it won't
[1:45:44] always feel good it's a choice that you
[1:45:46] make are you with me now and the age
[1:45:50] this is what I'm trying to get to you
[1:45:51] the age has come into a mature
[1:45:53] right right to come to brotherly
[1:45:56] kindness and then what to be capped off
[1:45:58] by what by love yes to be capped off by
[1:46:01] love what is that it's Christ coming
[1:46:03] down and sealing oh my sealing the age
[1:46:07] with love yeah so so when that this is
[1:46:09] what maturity looks like brother Bron
[1:46:11] says when that which is perfect has come
[1:46:13] that which is impart shall be done away
[1:46:14] with so all these little things are
[1:46:16] jumping up and down like a kid again
[1:46:17] we're supposed to leap for Joy but when
[1:46:19] do we do it when we're going through a
[1:46:21] trial not just when the music is going
[1:46:24] right right he said Rejoice leave for
[1:46:26] Joy when you're going through when
[1:46:28] you're persecuted he said so all these
[1:46:30] little things that jumping up and down
[1:46:31] like a kid trying to talk in tongues and
[1:46:33] all these other things when that which
[1:46:34] is perfect and we do have today by God's
[1:46:37] s the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:46:39] with Divine
[1:46:40] Vindication then that which is in part
[1:46:42] is done away with when I was a child I
[1:46:45] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:46:46] but when I become a man I put away
[1:46:48] childish things this message does not do
[1:46:50] away oh my it does not do away with the
[1:46:53] gifts it only does away with with the
[1:46:57] immature gifts yeah it does not do away
[1:47:01] with gifts but it puts them in order by
[1:47:03] love yeah the stronger man has grown
[1:47:05] into full maturity and we have that kind
[1:47:08] of maturity with our faith we can move
[1:47:11] mountains but he said but Paul look how
[1:47:13] he ties that in the first part of that
[1:47:15] chapter he said though we have faith to
[1:47:17] move mountains and don't have love he
[1:47:19] said we have
[1:47:21] nothing right so moving mountains by
[1:47:24] itself isn't enough but the full
[1:47:25] maturity to count it all joy when your
[1:47:28] Mountain doesn't move as fast as you
[1:47:29] think it
[1:47:31] should
[1:47:33] right cloudy skies and storms of life
[1:47:37] are not signs of God's disapproval you
[1:47:40] hear me church as I
[1:47:41] close neither are bright skies and still
[1:47:44] water signs of his love we we need to
[1:47:47] mature past that
[1:47:49] yeah we need to get a maturity in US
[1:47:53] yeah where we can I don't say a maturity
[1:47:55] where we don't Rejoice but a maturity
[1:47:57] where we would we Rejoice no matter
[1:47:58] what's going on right good not to come
[1:48:01] to a a maturity where we would never
[1:48:03] worship but a maturity where we would
[1:48:05] worship no matter what we're going
[1:48:07] through God help me to be that mature
[1:48:09] today
[1:48:12] yes he said his approval is not based on
[1:48:15] the things that happened to us yeah his
[1:48:18] approval of any of us is only in the
[1:48:19] Beloved trip that's something that I've
[1:48:21] tried to show to my kids and I hope I
[1:48:23] can show to others and and and you and
[1:48:26] and and each one of you that are a part
[1:48:27] you know we go through terrible things
[1:48:29] in life and I want to show you that I
[1:48:31] love you because of you not because of
[1:48:33] what you do that's right does that make
[1:48:37] sense I love you because of who you are
[1:48:39] you're you're a child of
[1:48:41] God you're worthy of my attention not
[1:48:44] because I might disagree with something
[1:48:46] you
[1:48:47] do right but that's not what our
[1:48:49] relationship is based on yeah I love you
[1:48:52] you because you're one of gods and and
[1:48:54] even the world we love but we love the
[1:48:56] the children of God in a different way
[1:48:57] because we have kinship and a bond there
[1:49:01] right and so I love you because if
[1:49:04] you're part of this church I don't I'm
[1:49:06] not just saying this I don't love you
[1:49:08] because of what you do or don't do you
[1:49:11] say well if brother Ben knew the way I
[1:49:13] lived or what I had done or someone he
[1:49:15] wouldn't love me that no let's do away
[1:49:17] with that thinking it's immature
[1:49:19] thinking right we love Because of Who
[1:49:22] You Are
[1:49:23] and we'll get through the other stuff
[1:49:26] God don't love you because of what
[1:49:27] you've done or what you haven't done he
[1:49:29] don't love you because you go to church
[1:49:31] or because you don't he don't love you
[1:49:32] because you he don't love you because
[1:49:34] you succeed or or love you less when you
[1:49:36] fail you his love is in the election he
[1:49:40] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:49:42] world because if we believe well he
[1:49:45] loves me because he treats me well what
[1:49:47] happens when you go through a
[1:49:48] trial all
[1:49:50] right his approval of us is not
[1:49:55] subject my kids will be my kids no
[1:49:57] matter what they
[1:49:59] do my approval of my kids is not
[1:50:02] subject to to what I do what they do or
[1:50:07] what I do it's in the Beloved so you
[1:50:10] make it like this I've said this before
[1:50:12] you make it where I'm I'm so tied with
[1:50:14] them that I can't I can't afford to let
[1:50:16] them fail I just won't see it I'll pray
[1:50:20] I'll do whatever it takes to see them in
[1:50:22] the house of God because I they will
[1:50:24] they fall will they make mistakes
[1:50:26] absolutely but my approval is not based
[1:50:28] on on
[1:50:30] Works hope you see that I hope my kids
[1:50:32] understand that because as teenagers you
[1:50:34] start to make your own decisions you
[1:50:36] begin to
[1:50:38] fail and the failing is not cute
[1:50:41] anymore right it was cute when you were
[1:50:43] a kid but as you get older it's not cute
[1:50:45] no more but remember that you are not
[1:50:47] approved today because of what you do or
[1:50:49] what you haven't done but you're
[1:50:51] approved because you chosen by by God to
[1:50:54] believe what you
[1:50:57] believe God has made you what you are
[1:51:00] yes good and that's a freedom in that
[1:51:03] freedom from the bondage of servant
[1:51:05] servant where you begin to think of
[1:51:06] yourself as a son or a daughter of God
[1:51:10] his love is elective he had for us
[1:51:11] before the foundation of the world does
[1:51:13] he love us oh yes but how shall we know
[1:51:16] we shall know because he said so and
[1:51:19] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:51:21] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:51:23] Spirit placing us as sons and how shall
[1:51:26] I prove my love to him by believing what
[1:51:29] he said and by conducting myself with
[1:51:31] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[1:51:34] wisdom allows to come to pass musicians
[1:51:38] if You' go ahead and come out of time
[1:51:40] this
[1:51:43] morning Jesus when he was about to leave
[1:51:46] the earth begin to talk to his disciples
[1:51:49] about
[1:51:50] joy and he said this he said you're
[1:51:52] going to be sorrowful for a while he
[1:51:54] said cuz I'm leaving he said but the joy
[1:51:56] comes in the morning you
[1:51:58] know he said hither to have you ask
[1:52:00] nothing in my name he said I want you to
[1:52:06] ask and you shall
[1:52:08] receive that your joy could be complete
[1:52:13] full
[1:52:16] mature ask and you shall receive that
[1:52:20] your joy may be full and I think many
[1:52:22] times people people are afraid to ask
[1:52:24] because they're afraid they might not
[1:52:27] receive yes because many times we ask
[1:52:29] and we don't receive right
[1:52:32] away and so time becomes the enemy of
[1:52:35] faith and so we believe when we come to
[1:52:38] the Altar and have hands laid on us we
[1:52:40] believe right and then a few weeks later
[1:52:42] if maybe nobody comes to visit or we're
[1:52:45] we're in a difficult place in the Pain's
[1:52:46] still there we're still
[1:52:49] hurting it's hard to believe during that
[1:52:51] time yeah it's hard to continue you keep
[1:52:53] your faith up right and I think we
[1:52:56] should do everything we can to help
[1:52:57] people's faith in that way but maturity
[1:53:00] is coming to the place where I know it
[1:53:03] may look dark yeah but I'm going to ask
[1:53:05] anyway right because I believe he'll
[1:53:08] give it to me in his time in his way in
[1:53:12] his manner he'll give me what's best for
[1:53:15] me he'll either give it to me brother BR
[1:53:17] said he reached a place in his life
[1:53:19] where he would either go he said
[1:53:20] anything I asked for God will either
[1:53:22] give it to me or tell me why he couldn't
[1:53:25] oh I want to be in that place where I'm
[1:53:27] willing to listen to the nose where I'm
[1:53:30] willing not to be governed by sensation
[1:53:33] you know so many people do that they
[1:53:34] just governed by the the first thought
[1:53:37] that comes to their mind well I don't
[1:53:38] feel good about this or I don't feel
[1:53:39] good about that that's not what we ought
[1:53:41] to be governed by but by faith in the
[1:53:43] word he said he would keep me sir he
[1:53:47] said he would reward my labor of love he
[1:53:50] said he would give me peace that passes
[1:53:52] under understanding he said he would
[1:53:53] heal all my diseases he promised he
[1:53:56] would do it and so why do I believe it
[1:53:58] because he said so and if he's brought
[1:54:00] me this far if he changed my life if he
[1:54:02] brought me out of sin and darkness he
[1:54:04] can do more for me he can continue to
[1:54:07] work in my life would you bow your heads
[1:54:09] with me this morning if you've never
[1:54:12] been born again if you've never fully
[1:54:14] yielded yourself to the stronger man
[1:54:17] maybe you're still struggling with
[1:54:18] things in your life would you just raise
[1:54:20] your hand to him today i' like to pray
[1:54:22] pray for you God bless you God bless
[1:54:24] those hands never really yielded
[1:54:27] yourself like you should God bless that
[1:54:30] hand those hands oh I want the stronger
[1:54:33] man A lot of times we're looking for
[1:54:36] some some super strength and God said
[1:54:39] just let the stronger man order your
[1:54:41] thoughts count it Joy let him let him
[1:54:44] control your thoughts or
[1:54:46] thinking we can't control the
[1:54:48] circumstances of life that's in the
[1:54:50] Providence of God but we can control our
[1:54:52] thinking about
[1:54:55] it I believe we ought to pray earnestly
[1:54:57] several hands went up and I believe God
[1:54:59] today could be your day that you're just
[1:55:02] so Born Into the kingdom of God that you
[1:55:05] know and maybe you just need to mature
[1:55:07] maybe You' received the the spirit but
[1:55:10] you just need to grow
[1:55:11] up may today be that day when you wake
[1:55:14] up and realize I'm not a baby anymore
[1:55:17] but I'm going to stand for the word I'm
[1:55:18] going to do what God called me to do
[1:55:21] Heavenly Father
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus as we've preached Lord and
[1:55:26] I've tried the best of my ability which
[1:55:27] is not

[1:55:44] that raise their hand I pray God you do
[1:55:46] a mighty work in their life may the
[1:55:48] stronger man come in Lord and begin to
[1:55:50] take control of everything
[1:55:53] realizing Lord we're still human and
[1:55:55] there will still be things come by but
[1:55:57] yet the word will arrest us Lord make us
