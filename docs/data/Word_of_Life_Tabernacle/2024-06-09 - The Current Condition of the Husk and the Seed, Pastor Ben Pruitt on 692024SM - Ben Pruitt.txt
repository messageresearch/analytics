Matthew Chapter 13 Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 30 it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we've got rain on the outside and we want it to rain on the inside and uh the holy Spirit just to follow Among Us this morning as we get into the word Matthew 13:30 I want to continue to talk about the season that we're in and the crop and things that God is doing I want to uh title this today the current condition of the the husk and the seed current condition of the husk and the seed I think it'll let us know where we're at I'm so glad for the message of the hour that gives us understanding to know where we are and who we are in the age that we live in Matthew 13:30 let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather you together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn aren't you glad to be wheat today amen God bless you could be seated brother brandom uses the terms husk shuck and also tears which is a different type he uses that term to describe the same group of people and it's what the the group of people he's describing is the third stage of the wheat it's leot in church it was the Pentecostal move it was a move of God the life of God come up through uh justification come up through sanctification come through the restoration of the gifts and then come into its full strength the word itself back again and so uh we know that uh we don't reject justification aren't you glad for justification today aren't you glad he took your sins and put them under the the Sea of of his forgetfulness we we don't do away with that we believe in that we believe that he justifies freely and we still believe that he saves us from our sins but yet we have a more perfect understanding of what that is in this age even than Luther had even though he was the one who brought that message and we understand that because we've heard a message called invisible Union of the bride and bridegroom and he told us what that was so uh we we we know that we know sanctification we know what that is and aren't you glad for sanctification aren aren't you glad there's a power of God that can move you away from the things of the world and take out the desire of sin and make you to where you live a holy life and I'm so glad that Holiness is still the order of the day without Holiness the Bible says the no man shall see the Lord and so we we still believe in Holiness today uh we still believe in the restoration of the gifts we still believe and we want the gifts to be among us and we believe they are and and maybe it wouldn't operate in a way that would you you would see or or in a way that would be a a showy time type of thing but that it would operate among the church in the way that God would want to he's Sovereign in that in doing that and we want to let him do that in his own time but we believe in the restoration of the gifts we believe in joy we believe in shouting we we believe in speaking in tongues we believe in the Holy Ghost we believe in those things and yet we know that we've moved on from that age of the restoration of the gifts and we've come to a place where the full strength of the word is upon us the sun is out in its fullness it is it is exactly the place where we can now see him as he is and it has been declared to us in this agees brother Stewart preached Wednesday night it's been declared he's here he is here who is here Christ the word is here and if he is here anything is possible and we've been shown that the sign of the son of man has come and we've been shown that Christ is here and this age so we are not dead but we're living the all the other ages as the life passed through them and went on they died the the all up to the husk they died and the husk died but the seed is still alive it's the only thing that's alive is the seed now we know that the husk is looks the most like the seed as I said you know and the reverse is also true the seed looks the most like the husk of all of those things in fact at one point you couldn't even tell the difference between the two because the husk was actually Sheltering the wheat was actually protecting the wheat sending it around the world and all of those things but there'd come a time that uh the sun would come in such strength that the husk would begin to separate and it denominated and died and so we know that it would only be the husk not the not the stalk and not the the other parts of the wheat but only the husk would be that part or all you call it the tear the shuck that would what would be so close to the wheat to be deceptive Matthew 24:23 Jesus said then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or or there believe it not so he said for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect brother random always ties that to a Pentecostal age right because it was so much like the real but it wasn't the real so brother B says watch nature and I'm going to read quite a bit this morning and I'll try brother Robert to stay with my notes but we may skip around a little bit but he said brother Brown said watch nature nature is God God working in nature it's all he can he said but from the Pentecostal Revival he said as they think was the seed it wasn't he said now watch but something come forth just like the seed he said now watch what Jesus said in Matthew 24:24 the two Spirits at the last days would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible I'm so glad that if is there I'm so glad the elect can't be deceived but why can't we be deceived because of the message of the Hour come to make us where we were uh we were without deception now uh he he said now that stalking and because we have a seed on the inside that causes us to believe that message and not anything else now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed neither does the tsel look like a seed but notice not in Luther's day but in the last day the first thing he said there's wheat farmer sitting here the first thing comes forth on a wheat seed you almost think it was a seed what is it it's the husk it forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed so you couldn't even tell but from the naked eye which was which right you couldn't even look at it and see on the outside but the difference was on the inside of what it was so he said uh he said it forms a husk but the husk is not the seed no more than the tossel or the stalk was it's only a carrier of the life the corn of wheat he said St John 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat after the tossle after Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain of anything else the husk is more like the grain is coming more like the grain all the time the one that went into the ground and then when it comes forth the stalk it's got life in it but it isn't the grain it comes forth the tossel the pollen it still isn't the grain then it comes forth the husk and it's just in the shape of the wheat just exactly like the grain of wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just exactly in the same shape perfectly so in the same shape as the wheat but it's not the wheat we want to be the real thing don't we I believe we are the real thing but what makes us the real thing what's the difference it's the word right we can receive the word and the Pentecost age could not receive the word the difference is not in our manner of service or anything like that we might have a service just like a Pentecostal church but that's not what makes the difference what makes the difference is the word so now he said the Pentecost has come out just like the wheat wood each one comes out from the other coming out from the other he said but they're only a carrier they go to denomination yeah now watch The Gospel is going to come through Luther through Wesley into Pentecost at the last days it'll deceive the very elect if it's possible the elect he said oh Pentecostal Brethren can't you see the wheat in its first beginning is just like to see but when it begins to form like the seed but it's the husk get denominated exactly the same thing they did in Luther he talked about Revelation 17 he said if the church has notice here the life that was in the stalk tsel all now ends up in the seed yeah the life that come out of the original seed come up through different processes three different processes and then turns back till its original condition yes I know I'm doing a lot of reading but just hang with me for a minute he said notice here the life that was in the husk and the stalk and the tossel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so now the seed and and I want you to know it's manifest in time that's the time that we're living in we're not living in Prophecy time we're living in manifesting time we're not living in a time for another prophecy to be given of what's going to happen but we're living in a time when the prophecy has been given and we're living in the time where that prophecy is manifesting itself it's manifesting itself in the lives of these young people it's manifesting itself in the lives of in the life of Housewives it's manifesting itself in the Liv of of men and women who believe God's word and it's so simple that people look over it and they say well nothing's going on the church is just well it's not doing too good and it seemed like things are not going the way they should and it's so simple people just look right over the top of it but didn't he tell us that's exactly how it would be that the third pole would be so simple and it would be so hidden and it would be so that the people wouldn't see it it wouldn't be out here in a in a tent meeting somewhere where they got television cameras and everybody's watching and we're all watching it happen again no that age has passed we're living in a time when the change is taking place on the inside yes right are you with me now and the news media will never pick up on it you know you'll never get you'll never get a news story you how we look at the news headlines it'll never be a news story The Bride is coming to maturity right there were news stories from Brother brandom come on the Earth right yeah the former and the latter rain coming together that made the news yeah there won't be no news about the bride coming to maturity right and there's no headlines come on it it's hidden from the world but Jesus said I thank thee oh Father you've hid these things from the eyes of the wise and PR but revealed it to babes such as would learn so it won't be a headline somewhere it won't be a great man or a great ministry or even a group of men or a group of Ministries but it'll be people individuals who are becoming the word until finally they mature until the change of the body now oh my oh I trust that's you and I today every one of there's something happening inside of you if you could just believe that if you could just grab a hold of that and realize everything you have need of just feed on the word and there's something changing on the inside now you can't see a difference between the husk and the wheat now I was going to show you a picture of the husk and the wheat but I couldn't tell the difference between one or the other so you can't really tell the difference between the husk and the wheat but as the sun continues to shine its strength the wheat or the husk brother pulls away the husk pulls away now the wheat never pulls away there's a great lesson there uh you know there's a great lesson there we don't divide we don't form denominations form the groups and pull away from people we just preach the word right right and the husk pulls away yeah from the grain we just stay together get that much closer to each other but the husk pulls away and what happens is the reason it pulls away is because it cannot take the word in its fullness it's reached the full potential of what it is right it it it had a purpose yeah but brother B said once it pulls away and dies once it denominates it'll never serve God's purpose again but it did have a purpose but now it pulls away and when it pulls away it begins to reveal a little bit more the difference between the husk and the wheat now what are the differences that you see between the two and I I begin to think about this these are just some things that come to my mind as we begin to think now what happened to the husk the husk denominated right but the seed is free right now look the hus denominated they looks like they're all in the same Condition it's all in a dry condition yeah but the husk is in bondage that's all it will ever be is what it is right but the seed is free right to become the fullness of the original grain right right brother brother what happened to you Pentecost is a few years ago you come out of that messal denomination to make yourselves Pentecost what why did you want to go back in it again he said the husk had to come the grain wasn't here yet he said see notice that's just the way they did that was in their heart they had to do it it was in their heart to be denominational so they went back to denomination because they were only a husk but there's something in your heart for there's a cry for freedom in the heart of the Bride something that will not bow down to denominational ideas what is that that cry for freedom in the bride that me that you're born for something more more than the husk was yes sir so there's a cry for freedom in your heart he said there'll be brother said notice there will be no more carrier mother Church's denominations after this carrier Shu because after the Shu there's no more nothing left by then but just the grain is that right it's got to be the grain it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a spirit I love this come upon the bride to do the same things that he did y all right it's the reproducing again of the grain so it's not just to to be a church member it's not just to be a a good person but it's a reproducing again of the Life of Christ in your life whatever he did that's what we begin to do as a body that's what we do is what he did yes yes so we know that the word makes us free John 8:31 Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then You by disciples indeed you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free yes and what that tells us is that a lie brings us into bondage Satan's lie takes you into bondage but God's truth makes you free yes and they answered him and said we be Abraham's seed we never in bondage to any man th sayest th you should be made free Jesus answered them verily verily say unto you whosoever committeth sin as the servant of the slave of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abide hiest forever if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed what's happening at the Harvest time the sun is making the wheat free GL to God that's why the Shu had to dry up that's why the stalk had to dry up that's why denomination had to be the in the condition they are it wasn't because God just said well the I'm going to mess around with these people they're going to think they got and they don't know they had to be that way to show who you are yeah all right there had to be a contrast there had to be a different they had to fade away to show who the wheat is so the sun makes us free yes and and and we realize today that that means that we have freedom the more light we have the more light we have the more freedom we have right there's a uh I think it's the Washington Post which is ironic considering that they're basically a liberal newspaper but the Washington Post has a a slogan democracy dies in darkness democracy dies in darkness and it's true that Liberty I'm ringing just a little bit it's true that Liberty actually dies when there's no freedom of of truth right and it's true today you look around you you many times you don't know what to believe yeah you look on Facebook it might be true it might not be true that's how many of you have paused before reposting something because you realize you weren't 100% sure that it was actually true at all some of y'all didn't pause you just went ahead you know but you've done that like you brother JT we look at something we think that must be true but we don't know how can we prove it because the people that tell us to have an agenda right yeah I don't want to make you paranoid I don't want to make you all like Jeremy this morning but on but you know you you begin to get that way cuz you don't know what to believe who's telling me the truth I'll tell you the only place you'll find truth truth and that's in the word of God all right come on this will make you free why because it's true it's always been true it always will be true but but but the news media will never make you free it'll always it'll always bind you because you don't know what to believe and what not to believe and so democracy dies Freedom dies Liberty dies right right in the in the obscuring of truth but the same thing is true listen of the preaching of the Gospel listen when the nominations took Satan's lie the freedom died in the church but now here at the end time now that we have the full word the full son what happens de freedom is back again Liberty is back again I don't have somebody tell me what I can preach and what I can't preach Liberty is back in the house of God again you don't have somebody telling you how you got to worship Liberty is back in the house of God again are you with me now when there's no truth there's no freedom freedom doesn't bind us anytime someone tells you our light doesn't bind us anytime someone tells you well we have more light yet they're in bondage to some system that's not real that's not real truth it can't be because truth makes you free what are we free from free from bondage free from slavery brother said now the church is uniting itself to the body of Christ oh I hope you can preach with me for a minute this morning he said it's got itself free cut away from every little fed is that your testimony this morning it's got itself free cut away from every little fed getting itself ready getting together yeah we got freedom to Fellowship again we got freedom to love one another again we got freedom to treat one another in the right way again come on we're not scared of being deceived we know who we are amen there's no freedom in the shuck they pulled away and and were bound together but in the wheat there was Freedom oh my listen getting together Union among them oh love and a joy the Holy Spirit moving among them Oh my he said what a time oh my that's the time we live in what are we free from we're free from tribulation did you know that we're free from the tribulation period the r said the church will go through the tribulation yes sir but the bride is free from it she'll go in the Rapture in a moment in a twinkling of an eye she'll be caught up to meet her Lord in the air for the wedding supper she has nothing to go through any tribulation about her Lord has paid her price aren't you glad that you're free that today you're free from the tribulation period you're free from judgment yes right yeah true do we actually believe that yeah we are judged here we stand before God here so that when we get over there we don't stand before God at the white Throne judgment but we minister to him Daniel 7:10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered to him a prophet told us that was us we're the ones who minister to him we're like the wife to the husband ministering to him and brother brandom even made that that that's happening now that the bride is ministering to Christ by becoming the word he said thousands thousands ministered to him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set the books were open but we are not standing before him waiting to hear what he's got to say we are not waiting to hear whether we're going to be free or not whether we're going to be saved or not whether we're going to go to hell or not but we've already received a pro we've already got a token we've made it into the throne room oh I hope you're hearing me today we're free from judgment amen he came why because we've already been judged sin has been dealt with in our lives here and the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all someone say all all sin yes amen so glad of that now the B said he came in 10,000 time 10,000s came to him and judgment was set the books were open another book was open which The Book of Life they were judged thus who was this that come the bride which did not have to come to judgment she's free from judgment look the full son all right right has made us completely free yes now now the second thing that I thought of is the husk at the hour that we live in the the lake Harvest at the very end of the Harvest remember the type of Ruth the type of the the the seasons at the hour we live in the husk is looking for Revival but the seed is in Revival now we got to identify with one of those two things today yeah we're either looking for Revival or we're in Revival right right and so you it's hard sometimes for us to understand that but everything we have need of you say well I need a personal Revival you may I need it many times but it's already within me what it takes to have a personal Revival I don't have to call in a special speaker I don't have to even preach myself I don't even have to go to church for that and it frees us up you know what it does it frees the bride where we're not coming here looking for something as much although we do that we're actually coming here to worship God because we know the Revival's inside of us we're not having to pull it down we're not what what did Paul say he said what sayth the word he said he's not in another country or somewhere else he said but the word is n thee even in my mouth yeah right and so you're not looking for something far off somewhere but it's it's a Revival on the inside brother Bram said speaking of uh messiah's and Messiah X when he was preaching the world is again falling apart he said so what we hollering about a messiah what are we hollering Revival in our time back this that and the other what are they looking for to do it what more do you want what does the church want anyhow this is important it's important because our mindset towards the bride's Revival and our attitude towards it is going to determine what we get out of it yeah and I've told you before we're in the bride's Revival we just need to participate in it yes right each one of us personally just needs to participate in it but this is the bride's reval how can you say that well the same way you can say at the end of the year it's harvest time right that's the hour we're living in the latter rain's already come the everything's already taken place the rain is fell we're here and the bride is the only thing that is in Revival right yes so now what are you looking for he said what because if you're looking for something else to come then you won't recognize what you already have and you'll find yourself without Revival because you're looking for Revival does that make sense right not recognizing the Revival that's already come and whenever you find somebody who's always looking back to the past always looking back well back in my day back in I know it's harder for older people as you get older you begin to think well it was better back 20 years ago or 50 years ago I remember when I had my full strength and things like that but don't you realize today is the best day that you've ever lived all right because now we have an understanding of the word we never had before we've got we've got a moving of God that that that's going greater and greater and greater and yet people look at it and despise it right just like they despise the second temple yeah but they despise it because they didn't recognize the value of it oh church if we could just recognize what God's doing in our day but anytime you find somebody that's always looking back always well uh you know back in the day it was better we need to go back we need to go back well that's what the shut does right well we need to go back to where it was that's where T shut does right that's what Republicans are doing Democrats are doing they just want to go back to different eras but everybody wanted to go back and then you got a group they want to go well someday someday we'll we'll have it right someday brother Brandon will come back and everything will be okay or someday some preacher is going to come by and we'll be in Revival someday there'll be a move of God don't you realize what's happening they don't have a revelation of what God did because if you know what God did I'm not going by feeling I'm not telling you there's a Revival because I feel like Revival I'm not telling you that there's a Revival because I because I see it with my eyes I'm telling you because the word says it yes sir and if it's here for you we can participate in right you know what that does it takes away all the excuses oh yeah the shuck has an excuse for being a shuck that's what it was meant to be the tossel has an excuse for being a tossel the Methodist have an excuse for being a Methodist the Baptists have an excuse for being a Baptist but you and I have no excuse we must be the original word amen that's what God's called us to be sir amen now look said well that's difficult for me brother Ben you don't know my pastor what's been going on listen you either believe you're an eternal seed Gene of God or you don't and if God allowed all those things to happen in your life there must be some reason he had to bring you he had to he had to he had to lead you he had to let you go he had to bring you to the place where you're at right now for a specific reason because all things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to his purpose that we got to believe that we got to wrap our minds around that and begin to recognize God I'm just going to come in and believe the message of the hour I'm not going to sit out on the outside anymore I'm going to believe it right I'm going to grab a hold of it because there's no reason being miserable there there's no point in being miserable right right you might as well just come on in and participate all right like a person scared of the water you know there no point in being miserable I don't swim swim but I like the water but I don't swim but I'll tell you this ain't no point in being miserable I get in it and splash around anyway my and who knows if I get in the water and begin to love really love the water maybe I'll learn to swim you kids there's no point in sitting there waiting on somebody else to have all the fun you might as well get in while the water's troubled there's no point in watching everybody else get healed you get in while the water's troubled let let let that healing become your healing let that testimony become your testimony good so brother BR we've already got it now if he can say that I got to say what a prophet said because that is prophesying right that's that's me saying what God Said we've already got it God gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the Bible we see it everywhere Through the Bible anointed ones come on and made that word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the Messiah this is him the word oh my we're waiting on some anointed one to come brother BR said this is him glory to God this is him what needed to happen in our hour the book had to be open are you with me now it was already him but it had to be open so we could see who he was yes glory to God he was he had to be introduced to us right so that he said this is him the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word remains God Hebrews 138 the same yesterday today and forever he said we know that it's supposed to take place in this day we're wanting a messiah and God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day it's just waiting for somebody with faith how many got faith this morning there's a few of us here how many got faith this morning if you're born again if you're a child of God you got a measure of faith God give you faith and that just that same faith that you use when you got born again that same faith they'll take you in a Rapture one day because it's the season for it but look God gave us the Messiah his promised word it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again he said yes sir it's a real Messiah it's the word of God which Jesus said both Heaven and Earth will pass away my word shall never pass away but the church sits spiritually dead gone the hour has passed them you know there's and and I I don't like preaching against message people because I'm a message person right I I'm one of you but I'll say this there's people that sit in the message spiritually Dead Brother B said the church sits spiritually dead gone the hour is pasted them there's people sitting the message waiting on something to come spiritually dead yeah and being spiritually dead is not just uh just not shouting or not speaking in tongues because the Pentecostals do that and they're spiritually dead yeah yeah right but the hour is past him they're in a slump and hardly know what to do one running this way and one that way and hear every promise that God made in the Bible every one of them is laying there just as good as they ever was glory to God every promise just as good justification sanctification the restoration it's all just as good as it ever was it's the hour what makes the church like this he said we're in the age of the leoa when she has to come this way this is the hour for it yes this is a time of trouble how many recognize that today but we're in Revival the bible promises that Psalms 138:7 though I walk in the midst of trouble thou Wilt revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies that right hand shall save me Psalm 275 he said for in the time of trouble what was this brother Brown said this was a background or preview to the Rapture a background scripture for the Rapture for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises to the Lord why is why are we revived why do we sing why are we happy because we know we're hidden under the third pole under the opening of the word under the Rapture Revelation come on Church all right that that ought to make us run all over the building if we really understood what it was yeah and you realize how silly carnal interpretations of the word are yeah right how how could a tent a physical tent hide me it can barely hide me from the cold and the wind right good tornado Come Blow it away but this is something we're going to be hidden in that won't be blown away that the Winds of Doctrine can't change that the Winds of this world can't The Winds of politics I have no effect on it why it's the wheat we're hidden in his Garner we're hidden in on a rock hallelujah hallelujah Psalm 31:19 oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that fear thee which th wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men Thou shalt hide them if you ever felt like you wanted to hide come on Church you just look out at the world and the things that are going on you look at your job you look at everything else going on just want to find a place to hide David said oh hide me in the Rock of Ages there is a place to hide in this hour it's underneath this open book under this word thou shalt hide them listen in what in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues won't matter what anybody says about them they're in Revival anyway are you with me now no matter how much they talk I I'm in Revival anyway why I belong to God it's not subject to what the winds say and what the rain does it's subject only to that your kind of presence of God I'm hidden in the secret of his presence hallelujah we're in Revival now what did he say the move is on for the bride thus sayith the Lord thus saith the Lord oh my now what what else can we say and I'm just going to preach and if I if I don't get done today we'll we'll go on but we're doing good the husk continues to focus on gifts but the seed has the giver now remember the age was the restoration of the gifts and the Pentecostal Church brother R said they is it cow or cabbage cabbage down on Joel I'm waiting on you to correct me I I forgot brother B uses one of those terms and he said they they they they knuckled down say it that way on speaking in tongues right they said that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost what was it the Shu forming a denomination pulling away from the wheat yeah they continued to focus on restoration of gifts that's what we need but that's what we have yeah right we already have it we're not looking for it we want it to manifest itself as we manifest love joy and peace and all the other things we want the gifts to manifest right brother brand told us how to do that but but we don't focus on the gifts because it's not where the light is today it'd be just like if I come up here and just preached a a justif justification message every time now there's a time for that I got to preach that because these kids need to know that they're Justified right right you you all of you need to know that you need to be reminded of that but that's not all I preach right right it can't be all I preach because if my focus gets on that alone then what happens is I leave off the light of the hour right which is the rapture that's the age that we live in yeah so we've got to preach the full word and not leave those things off but we don't focus on those things and yet we have more than a gift we have the giver right are you with me now now that's why it was such a a deceptive age remember Pentecost because of the gifts because it looked like that must be the Pinnacle but it wasn't all the God wanted to give us but the P said now the trouble with people today he said we find them living in the glare of another age just like Jesus found when he come he found them living in the glare of the law and ignoring what what was to take place in his age he said you know what's the matter today what was the matter with the Lutheran well because they were living in the glare of the Lutheran age when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification they couldn't go because they were living in the glare of Luther's age what's H what happened to the Pentecostal is why Wesley was so organized until he was living in the glare of another age age it was in Wesley's age when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals you see and some of them were good people way we knew some of those people in the westan age they were good people but they they looked at speak in tongu said that's nonsense right and that was the age that's how God was moving was in the restoration of the gifts but they they couldn't move on with it right and so brother bom talked about how the Pharisees did the same thing Jesus told him said if You' have known Moses you'd have known me right right if you really knew the word if you really knew what you were talking about about you know that I was the next step amen I am the fullness right that's what he was now God he said God identifying interpreting his scripture for that age it's always Christ it's Christ in every age he's the same yesterday today and forever it's always been Christ he said now we find out that now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're past that now some of you lived in that right they're still trying to manifest gifts and interpret the Pentecostal age and they're successful in that but the word passed on by them and that's why they uh that's why brother Paul they could live any way they want to and have gifts that's yeah right but we want gifts but we want the giver we want to live right we want to we want to do right but see here they they can do that because they're the age passed them by right they're living in the glare of of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're plumbed past that we're living on up to the rapturing time for the coming of the end time but that's the way man does it's just to be that way now glare excuse me is a false light it's a false light now a false light brother brandom taught us that the greatest robbery that was ever done was done by a false light right right the armored truck robbery in England he said it was a false sight it was a glare that caused them to to stop and then it was a great robbery it was a great robbery done to the church because they could not move on because they were seeing something else yes and that's exactly what's going on in our day many people come to the message they see a prophet but they can't see the bride they see a prophet but they can't see a manifestation they may see gifts but they can't see the word and so what is it becomes the glare that actually prevents them from moving on so brother BR said Pharisees Sadducees herodians whatever it might be they got the world so gumed up like they did in all ages that they could not see the real light it put their eyes out they was used to walking in the glare listen next day it'll be this this is what someone does in the glare yeah next day it'll be this tomorrow it'll be this we'll join this and it'll be that we'll join that he said we find it's a false Mirage right it's always a promise what is a mirage a promise of something in the future that never materializes right you see SE old western you know the old guy and he's stumbling along and here's a mirage there's water oh oh I'm going to get that water and he gets there and he falls he stumbles and there it is there's no water so he sees another one he goes towards it pretty soon he dies of thirst because he doesn't have the water he's looking forward to what he think where he thinks the water is but it never materialized don't you realize church that's not where the bride lives we don't live in an age where we're looking forward looking forward look at what's next what's this going to be we're living in a time when the water is right here by what do you have need of today where what do you have need of in healing the water for healing is right by you listen to me this is important this morning you young couples you sometimes we when we're young we did it too all of us did it you fuss and you fight and you kind of settling things in your home don't you realize that the water that you need to make your home right is right in this message right the the word that you need the water that you need you just need the Holy Spirit to bathe you down and get in the presence of the message and realize who you are yes some of you looking for a husband looking for a wife yeah you realize that you realize that what you need is in the message right you're looking for a person to come and what you really need is the messag amen all right and then if you really get in this message you'll find out that that that what you have need of is there and then you can be ready to be married to a husband or a wife water's right by you don't reject it but believe believe it's there yeah Heen now look brother BR said Jesus Christ is just as real today to a human heart as he ever was all right if he ever solved a marriage problem he can do it today yes if he ever if he ever got somebody a job right provided for you he can do it today if he ever provided healing he can do it today right whatever it is that he had he can do it today where do we mess up church when we get away from him when we don't follow his leading when we begin to leave the word for sensation or something else that's when we that's when we mess up but the word's always right it's always going to be right yeah oh my not in our interpretation of it but just the word itself true brother brand said Jesus Christ is just as real today to a human heart as he ever was his power and his living presence is just as real today as it ever was listen you young people hear your parents talk about getting saved and how they come to God and how they come out of a life of sin don't you realize he's just as real this morning as he ever was you can be just as born again as they were you can want to serve God with all your heart just like they did you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like I did just like we did are you with me Church yes well some of us are anyway I'm wound up this morning but I I'm not going to over preach I promise I'll leave you all alone after a while I bit my tongue right there that's maturity brother Joel someday somay that's coming yes that's maturity now look do you love the Lord this morning he's just as real as he ever was Lo a little while in the world won't see me no more Cosmos the order of the world won't see no more no more yet you shall see me I'll be with you even even in you to the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also even greater than this should you do CU I go to my father yeah that great promise is all today yes so knowing this brother I'm teaches this over and over and over again that precludes any doctrine that would put him off to be a god of tomorrow all right yes right or a god of yesterday the world is as blind as they can be but there is a ye that shall see me yes and that's what we're trying to get today right he said what the Full Gospel mean is to express Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection and all the fullness of his promises that the Holy Ghost manifest these things and make them right that God has promised and listen he will do it oh that comforts me this morning knowing he will do it see that age focused on the gifts and not the giver but Paul tells us the more excellent way is love so there was a higher way way the Corinthian Church was approaching the gifts there higher way to approach that yet he told them to covet earnestly the best gifts but there's a more excellent way now brother brand said I'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ all right think about it for a minute yeah well got quiet I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might might sound hard in a Pentecostal group he said but I'd rather have it where there's gifts they'll fail where there's gifts that'll bring confusion where there's gifts that can be questioned where there is love it is perfect yes huh right brother brandom never told us before we went to the other place we had to have perfect gifts right because we'll never have perfect gifts we did say we had that perfect love right right he said that's right he said so work first with love yeah right begin there that brings fellowship and Fellowship brings gifts it's been used and abused but we think about Elijah and brother BR preaches those series of sermons when he's preaching about Elijah and that still Small Voice and where art thou Elijah and different sermons like that and it's been abused many times to say well we don't need emotion anymore we don't need and I'm here to to say we still need to feel the presence of God in our midst there's a reason why God sent the fire there's a reason why God sent the wind Thunder but the Lord himself wasn't in it he was listening for the voice of the sign there's always a voice to the sign Elijah waited through those things and then responds to the voice and brother BR said I just wonder if we haven't listened too much to rushing Mighty winds and Fire and Blood everything else and have failed to hear that still Small Voice wonder if he can still speak to us today maybe you're not caught up in gifts maybe you're caught up in the world yeah can he still talk yeah are you hearing me this morning can he still talk to you is there still a is there still do you still have the ability to speak to your heart are you so caught up in work so caught up in friends so caught up in Netflix and you can't see him you can't hear him so God help us today we so caught up doing good things we're real busy right now getting ready for meetings getting doing all these things but we don't want to get so busy that we forget to hear that still small voice brother Joe he's got to be able to speak to us he wants to speak to us through his word yeah are we are we listening today said I wonder if we've looked so much to gifts we can't see The Giver he said see we're so prone to go after the gift instead of the giver when you see signs and wonders take place don't notice the sign so much but look what's behind it it's that still Small Voice that speaks he said that's the reason we can't have revivals in America is because people go after gifts instead of The Giver yeah that's what's the matter with the world tonight oh we got it if you want great crowds and audiences you have to have a real classical Hollywood outfit with a lot of show American people want entertainment he said they don't want the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so therefore the radio and the television would give them more entertainment than the church can do and they stay home all right right now church I'm just preaching to you because I'm I live in this age too all right I'm affected by it too but we all carry these around and it's more entertaining than Church all right come on we we don't like to admit that but it's true but it depends on what you want right if you're looking for entertainment then you're going to spend more time in that than you will in the house of God you going to spend more time in that than you are in the word of God but if you're looking for the gospel of the Lord Jesus listen that you'll find it he's still the same as he ever was we just got to look past the wind and the fire look past all these things and seek and he still speak to us he man he said the radio and the television give them more entertainment than the church can do it and they stay home and I understand I'm not I'm knocking at you people that have to be at home Sometimes some of you Elders Astound me how much you're able to be in the house of God my hats off to you thank you for being here we love you we love you with all of our hearts that's all right thank you for being here I say to our young families thank you I I just astounded all the time how faithful people are to the house of God I'll say this there's a higher calling we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're not living in a Methodist we're called to something higher we're called to a rapture we don't want entertainment we want the word amen he said all that comes out is the elect of God you're here for a reason this morning all that comes out is the elect of God that's still hungering and thirsting and calling and crying for the real thing of God all that that would be me this morning that would identify me as the wheat and not the Chug that's good I want you to understand this morning as we I won't trry too much longer but any gift could be impersonated yeah and in fact and this made me think of this the husk is an impersonator the Pentecostal Church though it was God's church but it became an impersonator it went from a carrier to being an impersonator of the true seed yes even down to attempting to impersonate the sign of the son of man which we know was uh brother brandom's particular gift actually had two uh actually he called them signs remember Moses was given two signs he was given the sign of the he toss his rod down Aaron's rod down to become a snake remember and the second sign was the sign of leprosy cleansed right from his hand so he was given the two signs and brother BR says the third sign is spiritual death right so you need to believe the voice amen of the sign yeah so you don't die spiritually and and so any if if you would go in that day and you look around and and you'd see that you know Moses throwing his rod down that God gave him that sign right the god-given scriptural sign yeah right but then there were men named Janice and jambers who were impersonators right and they come along and threw down the same thing I want you to understand that those peculiar gifts were given to Moses alone yeah yeah right I I've never heard you know I'm sure there have been some who tried but I've never heard of someone grabbing that somebody's hand and knowing the disease in their by their hand brother brandham did that right now that's peculiar isn't it why would God do that because it was something identifying there's something different about his ministry yeah right and then the secrets of the hearts was even beyond that because what is it it's what Jesus did right he's doing it again it's the sign of the son of man right and it wasn't here so we just follow the sign but to tell us the word was here yeah the son of man Christ the word the word is the discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart so the word is here but if you saw say in Moses day some guy come along you you'd never seen Moses and but you had heard he had these these signs and somebody come along doing that and and and and throwing their rod down and become a serpent and you ask them are you Moses no no I'm not Moses well you must be an impersonator of Moses cuz it's one or the other right so any person using that gift of discernment or or the sign in the hand those two signs that brother brand was given it may be a man of God or wonderful person but it becomes an impersonation because we were given that for a reason BR said I don't see your pastor or anybody Bo have to weight off my shoulders CU I don't have that gift but he said I don't see your Pastor tell your pastor anybody would be taking the gift of discernment they don't have to do that that's not their calling that's not their calling to do that that's to be one in an age and so B the Bible tells us that Janice and jambus withstood Moses and so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith that's very strong but there were many Who come out you've all seen them you don't see as many today but you can go on YouTube and find what they call discernment or or a word of knowledge and you can you can find it on there and it's laughable to us but people are impressed by it right right because it's vague it's just it's just something out there somewhere but it doesn't have any real meaning and and it's not accurate but what is it it's something that that was meant to happen in this age what does it show us we're at the end time yeah there had to be if there was an impersonator it had to be a real oh my so they did the same thing brother talked about a little woman now this will blow your mind because you know sometimes you don't understand all that a pastor allows to go on in a church but sometimes you're trying to teach something by it and you don't always understand and people who uh you know there's rules in a church and there's order in a church but sometimes you let things go on maybe shouldn't go on just exactly but you're trying to show something or you're trying to work with people because people aren't machines right and and we all have to learn that people are not machines right and the truth is I can know something is right and true and yet if you come at me in the wrong way I could be offended by you telling me the truth right right because I'm human but yet we want we don't want to be like that do we we want to believe the word the truth of the word but we also want to present it in the right way brother brandham uh brother brandham had a woman come to the church one time he said come back there you remember he said she come back there and said the Lord give me the same gift and and when somebody said well we have the same gift as brother Brandon that's a problem and and I said well she said I wish I had a chance to prove it I said there's the platform imagine sitting through that service he said and You' seen what happened pure Mass psychology but when you see he said sister Snider coming up and told her she had arthritis he said that finished it I said that isn't what's wrong with the woman she fell and broke her hip and I said she she's not even standing there of course sister Snider didn't hear too well and what she had I believe was a growth in her stomach or something other wrong like that I said that's what it is sitting here talking to the Brethren about it the whole time he said but just to show that the church see this carnal comparison you see you what does that do it makes the real trumpet he said now when I was in Canada they picked up this fell went up there and said right in AB among a bunch of Norwegians he said the Lord tells me somebody in here crowd about 10 times his size he said somebody by the name of John maybe Johan's or Johan said right along in here I believe he said no said it's right along in here somewhere of course they took him out he said in a Norwegian country right there'd be a bunch of John's right and so he's showing the it's not accurate now we I saw that the other day somebody said they had discernment on YouTube and this guy goes up to a random person he says I see somebody in your life is is a a Aaron an Aaron the guy thought for a minute said oh I had a buddy in the fifth grade and he says well he needs encouragement right now and they said oh that's wonderful that's just so wonderful that's not what brother brandham did right he turned his back to the audience right come on and he spoke to those who didn't have prayer cards right and said your name is this is your address this is where you come from this is what's wrong with you what was that it was God manifesting himself right it wasn't just meant to show us what who A man was it was meant to show us the word was here come on yes amen yes and so brother Bram talks about that the Lord it tells me somebody's got back trouble I feel my back hurting anybody's been raised he said through the scripture knows that that's s chology and the Man actually turned out to be a a pervert was picked up in Canada for fraud but and I don't say that anyone would do that is that way but but the man was he wasn't even living it and so brother Brown said what is it doing is to give the trumpet an uncertain sound right just exactly the way it always is trying to do things like that to give an uncertain sound Satan's business to do that but he said but now don't ever vary from that word remember I charge you before God stay with that word don't you never vary from it he said if those things rise up among the people and things like that there's a genuine every time you got a false there's a bogus dollar shows there was a good dollar it was made off of oh it ought to make us go back and look and see what was it that a prophet actually did what was it that God did through him what is it the husk is an impersonator living in the glare but the wheat has the fullness of the word the Bible says their Folly will be made manifest unto all men they will proceed no further he said that but the Folly will be made manifest how is it made manifest when Jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said this is her yeah and away he goes with her that's right their Folly will be made known right see the husk is preparing for tribulation the seed is ready for Rapture I'm closing but I know we got some Preppers around now look that's fine that's honestly if you want to prep and fill up your house with things that's a good thing that's not a bad thing uh some of our young people maybe could learn from that and and we could prepare better I could maybe learn from that we could prepare for natural disaster but you're not preparing for a tribulation all yeah that's not going to happen I I'm sorry to to break that to you but it's not going to happen I don't know who would want to go anyway in a time when it's the world is just going to be turned upside down we're going in a Rapture yeah see the Bible says as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of the this world the son of man shall send forth his angels they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that in then which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth that's the tribulation period yeah then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the Kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear Let Him hear we don't go through that time yes again Malachi 4:1 what was Malachi 4 he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet look how that that that uh chapter starts for behold the day cometh that shall burn us enough and all the proud all the do wickedly shall be stubble the day that cometh shall burn up say the Lord of hosts it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and brother BR said it was healing campaigns he rise with what was it it was God coming in our age the former and the latter Reign so we'd be prepared to be the wheat and be caught out of this place one day we'd be laying in the presence of the son you shall go forth and grow up as Cales of the stall as musicians come what what condition are we in this this morning what condition are we in I want to make it now personal I know this has been very doctrinal but what condition are we in brother the brand said this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal ages passed Pentecost is gone this is Harvest Time the Harvest Time the grain water's done been poured out the grain's getting ripe he said well what brother Ben what can I do well he tells us what to do come into the grain my dear brother yes come into the gra brain said hear me believe me if you believe me to be a servant of God let's each in our own way bow our head in humility what does that the full wheat that's come through late in the presence of the sun it caused its head to bow in humility let's bow our head in humility and offer the prayer that we know that we should offer God take me as I am all right I wonder if we could do that this morning if we could bow our heads I I believe you're wheat this morning I believe that's why you're here if that wheat bows its head and it says Lord I want to be but the grain I I want to I want to become the fullness of that grain I want you to work in my life God Take Me As I Am renew me change me move me help me drop take all the greenness out of me Let The Waters from under the throne as we preach about just just just wash over me I don't want to be dead the world's dead I don't want to be dead I don't want to be caught up in some some impersonation of Christianity I want to be right I want to live for God let me do that Lord could you make that your prayer let your head bow like his like he said he said if you just bow your head in humility and just cry out to him Lord I want to come to the grain I want to come to the fullness of the word in my life I want to be all that you want me to be maybe there in some area in your life you can think this morning that you're just not maybe you you slipped in some way and you know what the teaching of the message is but you've just moved away from it why don't you come back to it today why don't you just why don't you just in humility say Lord make me the grain again let let my life manifest the grain let it manifest the word and not some man not some idea let it manifest the word in my life Heavenly Father Lord my head is bowed to Lord as we know that we are all in need Lord of a of a Zeal
