[24:07] alive and
[24:10] well. Oh, he's
[24:14] alive and well. He's living in
[24:19] me to
[24:22] tell the
[24:25] world that he is the same.
[24:30] [Music]
[24:32] Oh, he's the
[24:34] same
[24:36] [Music]

[26:15] again. I want to
[26:19] live the
[26:21] way he wants
[26:24] me to
[26:26] live. I want to
[26:30] give until there's just no more to give.

[26:40] love love till there's just
[26:45] no more love for I can

[29:49] KFC.
[29:51] Amen. Jesus is the
[29:55] sweetest name I know.
[30:00] [Music]
[30:04] And he's just the
[30:09] same as his lovely
[30:16] name. Oh, and that's the
[30:21] reason
[30:23] why I love him so.
[30:29] [Music]

[30:34] Jesus is the
[30:37] sweetest
[30:39] name I
[30:41] know. Sing it one more time.

[30:48] Jesus is the
[30:51] sweetest
[30:53] name I know.
[30:57] [Music]
[31:00] And he's just the
[31:06] same as
[31:09] his
[31:12] name. Oh, and that's the reason
[31:17] why I love him so.
[31:27] for
[31:28] Jesus is the
[31:32] sweetest
[31:34] name I
[31:36] know. Amen. As they continue to play
[31:39] that, I wonder if you have a need on
[31:40] your heart tonight. Amen. If you would
[31:42] just make it known by an uplifted
[31:44] hand. Amen. You believe he's here to
[31:46] meet our needs tonight. Heavenly Father,
[31:49] as we come before your throne this
[31:50] evening, I would just ask, Lord, you
[31:52] would move every thought out of the way,
[31:54] Lord, that would be unlike you. I pray,
[31:57] Lord, you would just move upon the
[31:58] people here tonight, Lord, may there
[32:00] just be a an atmosphere of worship here,
[32:03] Lord, to invite you to come by and speak
[32:06] to our needs. I ask, Lord, that whatever
[32:09] the situation would be behind every hand
[32:11] that was raised, every need, Lord, I
[32:13] pray you would just walk down the aisles
[32:14] tonight, Lord, and meet every need. we
[32:17] pray move upon this church Lord be in
[32:19] this service we ask be with every word
[32:22] that's spoken Lord everything that's
[32:23] done we pray be for your glory and for
[32:26] your honor in Jesus
[32:28] name
[32:29] amen how many's happy to be in church
[32:32] tonight amen on a on a nice Wednesday
[32:35] night it was beautiful day on the
[32:36] outside and we're just ready to worship
[32:38] on the inside so if you have your Bibles
[32:40] tonight we'll get right into the word 1
[32:43] Corinthians chapter 13 it's a very very
[32:46] familiar chapter I think to all of us
[32:49] but 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse
[32:56] one and we'll read the entirety of the
[32:59] chapter if that's okay with y'all
[33:03] man some of y'all are okay with
[33:06] it 1 Corinthians chapter 13 Amen though
[33:10] I speak with tongues with the tongues of
[33:12] men and of angels and have not charity I
[33:15] am become as a sounding brass or a
[33:16] tinkling symbol. And though I have the
[33:18] gift of prophecy and understand all
[33:21] mysteries and all knowledge, and though
[33:22] I have all faith so that I could move
[33:25] remove mountains and have not charity, I
[33:27] am nothing. And though I bestow all my
[33:29] goods to feed the poor, and have and
[33:31] though I give my body to be burned, and
[33:32] have not charity, it profitth me
[33:34] nothing. Charity suffereth long and is
[33:37] kind. Charityth charity envyth not.
[33:40] Charity vonneth not itself, is not
[33:42] puffed up, doth not behave itself
[33:44] unseemly. seeketh not her own, is not
[33:46] easily provoked, thinkketh no evil,
[33:48] rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoicth
[33:51] in the truth. Can you say amen? Amen.
[33:54] Beareth all things, believeth all
[33:55] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[33:58] things. Charity never faileth. But where
[34:01] there are be prophecies, they shall
[34:02] fail. Where there be tongues, they shall
[34:04] cease. Where there be knowledge, it
[34:05] shall vanish away. For we know in part,
[34:07] we prophesy in part. But when that which
[34:09] is perfect is come, then that which is
[34:12] in part shall be done away. When I was a
[34:14] child, I spake as a child, I understood
[34:16] as a child, I thought as a child. But
[34:18] when I became a man, I put away childish
[34:20] things. For now we see through a glass
[34:22] darkly, but then face to face. Now I
[34:26] know in part, but then shall I know even
[34:28] as also I am known, and now abideth
[34:32] faith, hope, charity, these three, but
[34:34] the greatest of these is charity. And
[34:37] you may be seated. May the Lord add his
[34:38] blessings to the word tonight. And we
[34:41] know that uh charity, the word there, if
[34:43] you go back to the original on that one,
[34:45] it's a goppel love. It is not a fileio
[34:48] love, but it's a it's a true it's a
[34:50] godly love. And uh can you say amen to
[34:52] that? If you know that tonight. And so
[34:54] we know it's it's it's a perfect love.
[34:56] It's more than just the love you have
[34:58] for your spouse. It's more than the love
[35:00] you have for your children because that
[35:02] can uh you you could say you can be in
[35:04] love one day and out of love the next.
[35:06] But in this love here, it's an eternal
[35:08] love. It's it's not just like that. You
[35:10] can't think you can't think of it as in
[35:12] those terms. Although that's a good
[35:14] love. That's it's good. You've got to
[35:15] you must love your husband or your wife
[35:17] or whatever the case may be. You've got
[35:19] to love your children and all those
[35:21] that's it's a good love. It's a very
[35:22] good love, but it's a jealous love. It's
[35:24] got it's got parts of it that is that is
[35:26] not correct. It's got things in that
[35:28] love that is not true to where real
[35:30] love, real godly love, it it it it
[35:34] doesn't it doesn't boast. It doesn't uh
[35:36] it doesn't covet and and it doesn't get
[35:39] its feelings hurt because there's no
[35:41] feelings there to get hurt because it's
[35:42] not based on feelings or emotions, but
[35:45] it's actually a godly love. Can you say
[35:48] amen? Amen. Because a natural love, you
[35:51] can get hurt by somebody that that they
[35:52] say, "I love you one minute and they can
[35:54] talk behind your back the next." And and
[35:56] they may really love you, but they but
[35:58] there's humanity involved. And so maybe
[36:01] they make a mistake and then you uh
[36:03] being the the other human in the
[36:05] equation, you could say, "Well, they
[36:06] didn't really love me." And you can
[36:08] question that love. But the love of God
[36:09] is eternal. Can you say amen? And the
[36:11] love of God, there is no questions
[36:13] whether he loved me or whether he didn't
[36:14] love me. I mean, he died for the lowest
[36:16] sinner in the building. And I believe
[36:19] with all my heart tonight that the love
[36:21] of God endures until the very end of
[36:24] time and and even into eternity. So uh
[36:27] you know it in Strong's concordance it
[36:29] says charity is love. It's an agopel
[36:32] love. It's an affection or benevolence.
[36:34] And he's it's a love feast dear and
[36:37] love. And he and it goes on like that.
[36:39] And so if you think of this tonight,
[36:41] don't think of the love that brother
[36:42] Brandon would actually say if you had a
[36:44] certain type of love, it would be uh you
[36:46] know a love for your wife. If a if a man
[36:48] tried to come in to your home or
[36:49] something, you'd shoot that man. You
[36:51] know, because you're protecting that's
[36:53] the kind of love you have for your
[36:54] family. But but this kind of love, if
[36:57] you have this kind of love in your
[36:58] heart, you'd pray for that person.
[37:00] That's hard to think of, but it's a
[37:02] godly love. It's it's it's more than a
[37:04] human thinking and love. So, Brother
[37:06] Brandon would say it like this, and I
[37:08] believe this is true. Yet today, if
[37:10] there is anything that the world is
[37:12] dying for today is love. Can the church
[37:14] say amen? He said, "In my travels, I
[37:17] find that that uh that that is the
[37:20] rejected stone that keeps the building
[37:22] from being fit together where the
[37:24] assemblies and the church of God and the
[37:25] Baptist and Methodists will shake hands
[37:27] and be brothers if they just had the
[37:28] love one for the another, one for
[37:31] another." That is the great need the
[37:32] world is dying for. And God is love. He
[37:35] said, "Now you find it in the church
[37:37] that what hindered the church has been
[37:39] the wrong conception of love." And he
[37:42] said, "Now there is two different types
[37:43] of love. That's real love. One of them,
[37:44] the Greek word is called agapo. That's
[37:46] God's love. And then a a perverted love
[37:48] from that is felio love, which means
[37:50] human love. And he said it comes from
[37:52] the word fellowship. The filelio love is
[37:54] what you have for your wife. And a man
[37:55] might flirt with her or insult her like
[37:57] we just said and and it would make you
[37:59] uh you know shoot the man or whatever.
[38:01] But he said agapo love would make you
[38:03] pray for his sinful soul. That's the
[38:05] difference between the two loves. God's
[38:07] love is the beginning of love. It's the
[38:10] foundation. It's the fountain of love.
[38:12] And the church today is lacking in that.
[38:14] I do think we have I do think, you know,
[38:16] we have we have love for our families
[38:18] and we have love for for for all those
[38:20] things. But what we really need more
[38:23] than ever is love for God and his word
[38:25] and and for one another because you you
[38:27] you can't you can't say you love God and
[38:30] hate your brother. Can you say amen?
[38:31] Amen. If you really love God and have
[38:33] the love of God in your heart, then then
[38:35] it really it makes you look past him and
[38:38] I believe the scripture says love covers
[38:40] a multitude of sin. Amen. So if you see
[38:42] somebody doing wrong instead of instead
[38:44] of be, you know, hating that person,
[38:46] love will make you go after that person
[38:48] in a in a loving way and and you know it
[38:51] it's different. It's different to to to
[38:53] say the if you speak the word, it could
[38:55] be true. Uh maybe whatever you say to a
[38:58] person can be a truth, but if it's said
[38:59] in anger, then it will have no effect on
[39:02] that person other than driving them
[39:04] farther from the church. But well, Lord,
[39:06] help me. I I say, you know, what we need
[39:08] tonight is the truth preached, but in
[39:10] love. And so it's it's right to preach
[39:13] the truth. It's right to say the truth,
[39:15] but make sure your motives are right,
[39:17] and make sure it's always done in love.
[39:20] Can you say amen? Amen. the pastor can
[39:22] stand here and preach to you and maybe
[39:24] preach hard things to you, but if you
[39:26] know the pastor loves you, it's easier
[39:27] to take it, isn't it? Amen. So, you want
[39:29] to you want to have confidence with the
[39:31] people and and you want the people to
[39:32] know you love them. And the only way to
[39:34] do that is not to just, you know, it's
[39:36] not to just show up and say you love
[39:38] people, but you need to mean what you
[39:39] say. And then you can really you can
[39:42] really express that love. And listen,
[39:44] love is not something you can just you
[39:46] can pretend to have. Eventually, people
[39:47] will know if you really love them or
[39:49] not. Amen. Can you say amen? And and and
[39:52] yet my love for you could fail and your
[39:55] love could me for me could fail because
[39:58] it's human love. But if we really have
[39:59] the love of God in our hearts, then it
[40:01] is more fellowship than just us getting
[40:04] together. But it's a real bond of
[40:05] brotherhood. Can you say amen? So
[40:08] brother Brandon would say it like this.
[40:09] He says he said that's what's lacking.
[40:11] If we only had that kind of love,
[40:12] there'd be a revival sweep this nation
[40:14] from coast to coast and from north to
[40:17] south. And the reason that we do not
[40:19] have that love, the main reason is the
[40:21] church is not progressing like it
[40:23] should. Now, I know that America has
[40:25] turned down the revival and America is
[40:27] not going to have a national revival.
[40:29] But I would say if our church needs
[40:31] revival, then we need love in the
[40:32] church. Can you say amen? Amen. So, we
[40:36] go on like this and brother Brandham
[40:37] said, "If you dwell in love, you dwell
[40:39] in God, for God is love. They that dwell
[40:41] in God dwell in love." See, and love has
[40:44] no hatred. Can you say amen? Love, we're
[40:46] talking about a godly love. Godly love
[40:48] is not jealous. Love is not puffed up.
[40:51] It does not behave it misbehave itself.
[40:53] Love is always gentle, sweet, forgiving,
[40:56] kind. No matter how bitter the others
[40:58] is, love remains itself. So matter no
[41:01] matter how bad your enemy hates you, no
[41:04] matter how bad they talk about you on
[41:06] Facebook or no matter how bad they're
[41:08] running you down in the community, if
[41:09] you've got godly love, it'll make you
[41:12] pray for the person instead of trying to
[41:14] get even with a person. Can you say
[41:16] amen? Brother Joel, why you preaching
[41:17] this tonight? Because this is something
[41:18] I've had to fight myself because growing
[41:21] up it was always get even.
[41:24] And we we shouldn't be that way. We
[41:26] shouldn't be that way. And many times,
[41:28] you know, you can say the truth and you
[41:29] got to be careful how you say it because
[41:31] if you're naturally a real real forceful
[41:33] person or you say something that maybe
[41:35] comes across wrong, you got to watch
[41:36] yourself and say, "Lord, I want the
[41:38] people to know that I care for them. I
[41:40] do really love the people." and you
[41:42] don't want to come across like you don't
[41:43] love them or the people are never going
[41:45] to listen to you. And so I want to tell
[41:46] you tonight that it's not about me, but
[41:48] we do need for each other. Amen. The
[41:51] love of God shed abroad in our hearts.
[41:52] Can you say amen? And so, Brother
[41:54] Brandon would go on like this. He said,
[41:55] "Love is the ultimate of grace." Love is
[41:58] God's ultimate for us after all other
[42:00] gifts and things has vanished. Amen. You
[42:02] You can have prophecy in the church. A
[42:05] and one person, Brother Brandham talked
[42:06] about the two men that spoke in tongues.
[42:08] He said one of them was a real Christian
[42:10] and the other one when that first
[42:11] meeting he went to and he said the other
[42:13] one was a real hypocrite. And so what
[42:15] you've got, you know what you you could
[42:16] have a gift fall on somebody. Amen. A
[42:18] man could stand here and preach the
[42:20] gospel and have no love in him. Amen.
[42:22] But you've got to have love to have an
[42:24] effect on the people. You've got to love
[42:26] one another in order to help somebody.
[42:29] Can the church say amen? He said in all
[42:31] the prophecies and the tongues are
[42:32] interpretations, all we've ever done or
[42:34] what more. When love comes in, it's the
[42:37] ultimate. It's above all because love,
[42:40] love never fails. All other fails. He
[42:42] said it's a it's the tiepost. It's the
[42:45] north star that keeps the the seaman
[42:48] level. He said the compass that guides
[42:49] us. And love is the ultimate. So I want
[42:52] to say tonight, I believe love is the
[42:54] main thing. And so the greatest of all
[42:57] the gifts, the greatest of everything
[42:59] you could seek after. Amen. He said, I
[43:01] would rather have a church that didn't
[43:03] know nothing about the gifts, but was so
[43:05] in love with each other. Can you say
[43:07] amen? Amen. You could get up and and you
[43:09] could shout and you could run and you
[43:11] could speak in tonesues. Amen. And and
[43:13] and God send it all to the church. We
[43:15] need it all. Amen. But the greatest you
[43:17] need is love because you can stand up
[43:19] and speak in tongues and treat your
[43:21] neighbor bad and you know better than
[43:22] the person that's never spoke in
[43:24] tongues. You can get up and preach a
[43:25] sermon, but if you're treating people
[43:27] like the devil, then you need to go back
[43:29] to the altar again. Preacher or no
[43:31] preacher. You've got to have love in
[43:33] your heart. And it's got to be a godly
[43:36] love. Can you say amen? Amen. All other
[43:39] things will fail. Brother Brandon would
[43:40] say it like this. Love, God's love, love
[43:42] is the most powerful thing that there is
[43:44] in the world. It conquers anything. He
[43:46] is love. He said by this you shall
[43:48] conquer. By love divine, loving one
[43:50] another, loving the con the loving the
[43:52] cause of God. Loving Christ, loving
[43:55] suffering humanity. That's how you
[43:57] conquer. You can't conquer by always
[43:59] just being quickteered. You can't always
[44:01] conquer a a devil by by by having a
[44:04] devil in you rise up and going after
[44:06] another devil. Satan can't cast out
[44:08] Satan. You try to you trying to cast out
[44:10] a spirit of hate by by hate. That ain't
[44:12] going to work. Come on, church. These
[44:14] are basic things here tonight. But
[44:16] you've got to have love. And what the
[44:18] church is waiting for to cap the entire
[44:21] age is love. And so I would say tonight,
[44:25] Amen. Brother Brandon would talk, excuse
[44:27] me, brother Brandon would uh would would
[44:28] quote this scripture. And I I went to
[44:30] Matthew 5:13 and and Jesus said, "You
[44:33] are the salt of the earth. But if the
[44:35] salt have lost its savor, wherewith
[44:37] shall it be salted? It is henceforth
[44:39] good for nothing but to be cast out and
[44:41] to be trodden underfoot of men." Amen.
[44:44] So you are the salt of the earth.
[44:47] Listen, you you can't find love anywhere
[44:50] outside of a Christian because they
[44:52] don't know what love is. Amen. Look at
[44:54] the perversion of love now and the
[44:56] Hollywood love and they'll say, "I've
[44:57] got we got love. We don't we don't like
[44:59] hate speeches from a from a certain
[45:01] party or a president. Amen. But they can
[45:03] be married four or five times and and
[45:05] running off on their wife and stuff. And
[45:07] they call that love. That's a perversion
[45:10] of true love because that what they what
[45:12] the world calls love. I want you to know
[45:14] tonight, it's not true love. Amen. The
[45:16] fairy tales you listen to and the movies
[45:19] you watch, that's not true love. But
[45:21] what you what you'll see is if you read
[45:22] your Bible, when a man went and died for
[45:25] you, that's true love. Because the man
[45:28] could have stood there and said, "It's
[45:30] more important that I live than you."
[45:31] But no, he laid down his life so that
[45:33] you could live. That's love. Brother
[45:36] Brandon would say it like this. You
[45:37] never cast out a devil by the wrong
[45:38] attitude. It takes love to do that. Can
[45:41] the church say amen? And love is the
[45:43] most powerful force that there is in the
[45:45] world. You just start loving somebody
[45:47] that dislikes you and watch how they
[45:48] start to react. Yeah. If you really love
[45:52] somebody, they can tell that you love
[45:54] them. And he goes on like this. Love is
[45:56] the most powerful force. He said, "Now,
[45:57] if you notice, a devil is always hate."
[46:02] So, if you if you find yourself hating
[46:04] all the time, that's one thing to hate
[46:05] sin because the Bible teaches us to do
[46:08] that. But you don't hate the sinner. If
[46:10] you find yourself hating people,
[46:13] anybody, sinner or saint, brother
[46:15] Brandham said, you'll find yourself in
[46:17] danger of hellfire. What can the church
[46:19] say? Amen. Because we don't hate people.
[46:21] You listen, you don't know who is and
[46:23] who isn't. Your best friend may not be a
[46:25] Christian, but the person on the corner
[46:27] of the street that's a drug addict might
[46:28] be the last one that needs to come in.
[46:30] Come on, church. We need more love.
[46:35] And love is not just something, like I
[46:37] say, it's not a perverted love. Because,
[46:39] you know, sometimes we come out of
[46:41] things and you hate where you came from.
[46:43] You hate your past and you hate it so
[46:44] much that you throw the baby out with
[46:46] the bathwater and you can't even go back
[46:48] there and remember there was some good
[46:49] things you learned in your childhood.
[46:51] There was some good things that were in
[46:52] your past, but you've got so much hate
[46:55] for what did happen that you can't see
[46:57] good no more. It It's like I I heard a
[46:59] person one time say they said, "Well, we
[47:01] used to be in a church that shouted and
[47:02] run." Amen. But the pastor was a
[47:04] hypocrite. And I got to thinking about
[47:06] that. Yes, that that that's very
[47:08] possible. Amen. There could be an
[47:09] anointed service and the man in the
[47:11] pulpit could be an absolute devil.
[47:14] And yet at the same time, that doesn't
[47:17] mean the anointing wasn't there. That
[47:19] doesn't mean that the word preached
[47:20] wasn't true. Amen. So you say, "Well,
[47:22] I'll never go to church because there's
[47:23] a hypocrite there." Be careful. You
[47:25] might never go back with yourself.
[47:29] Every one of us have fallen short. Every
[47:31] one of us have. Every one of us have
[47:33] done something wrong that we needed
[47:35] forgiveness for. The best Christian in
[47:38] here, Jesus had to die for you.
[47:41] The ultimate love had to be paid for
[47:43] your sins. So, Brother Brandon would go
[47:45] on like this. And I hope this is okay
[47:47] tonight. This has been on my heart for a
[47:48] while and I and and I thought, well, you
[47:50] know, it's too simple. But you know
[47:52] what? Sometimes we just need to love one
[47:54] another. Love will cover a multitude of
[47:56] sins. When you start seeing people pick
[47:58] at one another in the church, all they
[47:59] need is more love.
[48:02] When you start seeing people that that
[48:04] that are getting offended easily, all
[48:06] they need is more love. Because love
[48:07] will bring forgiveness. Love will bring
[48:10] Come on, church. Love will bring about a
[48:13] lot of things. And it'll bring faith to
[48:15] you. You say, "Well, I need healing."
[48:17] what you need. Listen, brother Brandon
[48:18] would say that God heals by love. That's
[48:21] right. Think about it. In order to have
[48:24] perfect faith, you got to have perfect
[48:25] love. Say, "Well, I wish I had more
[48:28] love." Well, we all wish we had more
[48:29] love. And we need more love. And and
[48:32] then, well, I wish I had more perfect
[48:33] faith. You can't have one without the
[48:35] other because Brother Brandham would say
[48:36] it like this. They're twins. You've got
[48:38] to have both of them in order for it to
[48:41] be perfect. So, you say, "Well, I have
[48:42] faith in this message." Well, if you
[48:44] have faith in this message and you love
[48:46] the message that God sent. Amen. So,
[48:48] you've got it starts with love. It's the
[48:50] beginning. It's the fountain of all is
[48:52] love. Can you say amen? I hope y'all are
[48:55] with me tonight so far. Amen. Brother
[48:57] Brand would say it like this. You
[48:58] remember that Jesus said his sermon when
[49:00] when he prayed in his prayer, he said,
[49:01] "Father, thou who art in heaven,
[49:03] hallowed be thy name." And he goes on
[49:04] down. He says, he says, "And you don't
[49:06] forgive from your heart, forgive every
[49:08] man his trespasses, neither does your
[49:09] heavenly father forgive your
[49:10] trespasses." Listen, he said, "You
[49:12] mustn't do that." You say, "Well, I want
[49:14] forgiveness and and I need grace and
[49:16] all." Well, you better remember,
[49:18] somebody had to love you or you couldn't
[49:20] be sitting here tonight.
[49:22] Somebody had to love me or I couldn't
[49:23] stand here tonight. Come on, church.
[49:26] Somebody had to love you in order to
[49:28] save you from the past that you were
[49:30] living. It all started with love.
[49:35] Brother Brandon would go on down. He
[49:36] said it. He said the first thing the
[49:37] Pentecost produced was brotherly love.
[49:39] He's talking about the Pentecostals at
[49:41] Acts. He said it tore down the middle
[49:42] wall of partitions and made a
[49:44] brotherhood. He said such a way that
[49:45] everything in common and the Bible says
[49:47] a brotherhood. Paul spoke of the
[49:48] brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of
[49:49] the Pentecostal church and then said in
[49:51] 1 Corinthians 13 that though I speak
[49:53] with tongues as men and angels and have
[49:55] not this love which brings the
[49:56] brotherhood, I am nothing. And though I
[49:59] have the knowledge to understand all the
[50:01] mysteries of God, I'm still nothing
[50:02] without love. The love of the brethren.
[50:04] Jesus said this will all men know that
[50:07] you're my disciples when you have love
[50:09] one for the other. He said Pentecost had
[50:11] that speaking of the Pentecost the
[50:13] meaning the first group of the apostles
[50:15] and disciples. And he said he he and
[50:17] listen now that the the scriptures he's
[50:19] referring to there is they were in one
[50:21] accord in one place. Now it took love
[50:23] for them to be in one accord. And and if
[50:26] we want the same experience we need to
[50:28] be in one accord. And it's going to take
[50:30] love to do that. Have you ever come into
[50:32] a service and you and you've had utter
[50:35] in your heart against somebody an
[50:37] indifference against somebody? Listen,
[50:38] if that's there, it'll hinder your
[50:40] experience in the service. So, we've got
[50:43] to love that person. Lay that aside.
[50:45] Come on, church. You say, "Are you
[50:47] pointing out somebody?" No. I'd say I'm
[50:49] the first person that needs to be
[50:50] pointed at. I've been guilty of walking
[50:52] in and and and thinking something about
[50:55] somebody and well, I don't know if
[50:56] they're really a Christian or I don't
[50:57] know what. Listen, it ain't up to me to
[50:59] judge people. It's up to me to love
[51:01] people. God will bring in those who are
[51:03] supposed to come in and those who don't
[51:05] will be here. But let me tell you
[51:07] something. God is love. And if we are in
[51:09] God, then we will love one another. Can
[51:13] the church say amen? Brother Brandon
[51:15] would go on like this. He quotes him. He
[51:16] said they had brotherly love. They
[51:18] wasn't greedy. They sold everything they
[51:19] had for the furthering of the church.
[51:20] They was so together till even when one
[51:23] had heard the other one died. They said,
[51:24] "Let us go die with him." Such a feeling
[51:27] now. And Paul said in Hebrews 13:1, "Let
[51:30] brotherly love continue." Amen. We don't
[51:33] want to backslide. Like um you think
[51:34] about the Ephesian church and and how
[51:36] they they did run well, but then they
[51:38] they backslid and and they were in a
[51:40] lukewarm condition. Listen, don't let
[51:42] that happen to us tonight, church. We
[51:44] want to keep going forward. And every
[51:46] step we take, we don't want to take two
[51:48] steps backwards and then say, "Well, I
[51:50] need more love in my life." I say if you
[51:52] need more love, there's more love for
[51:54] you to have tonight. Amen. I believe
[51:56] that what we need tonight is is not so
[51:59] much more head knowledge and and not so
[52:01] much more understanding of the
[52:02] mysteries, but we need to have love one
[52:05] for the other
[52:07] because you can know a lot and not have
[52:10] love and it won't do you no good.
[52:14] We we can understand the message. You
[52:15] can study the message. You can listen to
[52:17] the message, but if you don't have a
[52:18] love in your heart for the things of
[52:20] God, Amen, it's just a it's just a
[52:22] background noise. or uh you know you can
[52:24] come to church and well I'm checking my
[52:26] box today. Listen church, we're not
[52:28] doing that. We come because we love him
[52:30] and we love him because he first loved
[52:32] us. And if we know he loves us then then
[52:36] that that that creates a love back to
[52:38] him. You know even our worship it's a
[52:40] love it's returning a gift because the
[52:42] gift of love is in us. And so brother
[52:44] remember going like this he said let
[52:45] brotherly love continue. He was quoting
[52:47] Hebrews 13:11 and he said that was in
[52:49] the first church but something taken
[52:51] place and there was a fellow come in by
[52:53] the name of Palmerworm. He's talking
[52:55] about the restoration and then he said
[52:57] and and I will restore 1957 he said
[53:00] there was one named by Palmerworm and
[53:01] when he began to eat on that vine of
[53:03] brotherly love he cut the very sapline
[53:06] of it because it don't make any
[53:07] difference how smart we are how much we
[53:09] think we know or how much we want to be
[53:11] different from somebody else. As long as
[53:14] that brotherly feeling isn't among us,
[53:16] we are fighting a losing battle. Can the
[53:18] church say amen? That's right. He said,
[53:20] "We can't win. There's no way for us to
[53:22] win." So, if you want to win the battle
[53:24] tonight, you've got to have love.
[53:28] Can you say amen? So, I you know, and
[53:30] and understanding the kind of love we
[53:32] need is so important because listen,
[53:35] church, everything that we do, it it it
[53:38] matters. That's right. When you when you
[53:41] do something in the world, people see
[53:42] you. And of course, you know, as a
[53:44] human, you're going to make mistakes.
[53:46] And many times, somebody's going to
[53:48] accuse you and say, "Well, you don't
[53:49] have love." Or somebody's going to say,
[53:51] "Well, you you they're going to accuse
[53:52] you of a lot of things." And and and but
[53:55] you know, let's check up with God and
[53:57] make sure that we're treating everybody
[53:59] right because you may have a neighbor
[54:01] you can't stand, but you still have got
[54:04] to love them anyway.
[54:06] Well, can you say amen? Right now, I'm
[54:08] going to get to one here in a minute
[54:09] where brother Brandham says, "It's a
[54:10] devil to dislike somebody."
[54:14] I like that one because I've always
[54:15] wanted to be liked. And so, Brother
[54:18] Brandham would go like this. He said,
[54:19] "If that brotherly feeling isn't there,
[54:21] there's no way for us to win." Brother
[54:22] Brandham tells a story. You've all heard
[54:24] it, but for you young people, you've all
[54:25] heard the story of the killer bull. Have
[54:27] you heard the story of the killer bull?
[54:28] Some of you have. I'll tell I'll tell
[54:30] you just my version of it. Brother
[54:32] Brandon was going to pray uh for a sick
[54:35] person. I can't believe if it was a
[54:37] child or not, but he's going to pray for
[54:38] a sick person and he was a game warden
[54:40] and he was supposed to carry a gun with
[54:42] him. And this day he didn't have his
[54:44] gun, so he takes off through this
[54:46] pasture and he'd forgot that there was a
[54:48] bull that had killed a man and and so
[54:50] they sold him and they put him in this
[54:52] pasture down here, I guess, to just
[54:53] graze him out or whatever. And so,
[54:55] Brother Brandon cuts off down through
[54:56] this pasture and he gets about 200 yards
[54:59] in. He said there's no trees or nothing
[55:01] for about 200 yards, no fences. And he
[55:03] said, "That bull stands up out there in
[55:05] the bushes and starts coming towards
[55:06] him." And he said, "You know, there's no
[55:08] way to outrun him. He's going to he's
[55:09] going to catch me." And and I I put some
[55:11] of this in here. And he said he said it
[55:13] was a fine species of an animal, but the
[55:16] but he was just a killer bull. He had
[55:17] he'd dig his horns in the dirt and he'd
[55:19] come after you and and he was just a he
[55:20] was a bad bad animal, you know? So, and
[55:23] he'd have made a fine steak, but he was
[55:24] a bad animal. And so, man, y'all are
[55:28] hard tonight. But all all you
[55:31] vegetarians wouldn't
[55:32] laugh. He'd have made a fine steak with
[55:34] a side of
[55:36] salad. And so, Brother Brandham goes
[55:38] walking through this field and and that
[55:40] killer bull's there. And I like what he
[55:42] what he did. He said he said uh instead
[55:46] of started to run or scream, he said, "I
[55:48] loved that animal."
[55:50] He said, "I felt sorry." Because he
[55:52] said, "I disturbed that animal." Right.
[55:54] And he said, you know, that bull come
[55:55] running at him with his head down and
[55:57] his put his he said he got about 20
[55:59] yards from him and he said then he just
[56:01] started running and he dug them hooves
[56:02] in the in the dirt and he said he he
[56:05] said you know he said instead of being
[56:07] scared he said I felt love for the
[56:09] animal because he said after all this is
[56:11] where he lived and it was his place and
[56:13] and of course brother Brandham was that
[56:15] type of guy. you know, it seemed like he
[56:16] loved nature and and he he always said
[56:18] that was because of his, you know, his
[56:20] Indian uh background and things, but he
[56:23] said, "I am the servant of the Lord and
[56:24] I charge thee in the name of the Lord."
[56:26] Talking to the bull now. "I charge thee
[56:28] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[56:29] our creator, that you go over there and
[56:31] lay down." And he said, "Here come the
[56:32] bull coming right on me." So, but
[56:34] somehow, he said, I wasn't a bit more
[56:36] afraid than I am right here before
[56:38] lovely Christians. He got within about
[56:40] 10 feet of where I was standing. He
[56:42] said, 'I just stood there looking at
[56:43] him, not more afraid than I am. And he
[56:45] talks about a little lady sitting there
[56:46] more than this little meek-l looking
[56:48] lady sitting here. He said, and he run
[56:50] right to me, and when he got right up
[56:51] close to me, he just throwed his feet
[56:53] out and stopped and he looked this way,
[56:55] looked around so depleted, turned
[56:56] around, walked over and go laid down
[56:58] under the bush. What did it? He said,
[57:00] "The trouble of it is people are scared
[57:03] today." Now, you say, "Well, that's just
[57:04] a story." But brother Brandham actually
[57:07] uh refers back that there's scripture
[57:08] for that because in 1 John 4:18, there
[57:12] is no fear in love, but perfect love
[57:16] casteth out fear. Now, that that doesn't
[57:18] mean you go into a bear cave and you you
[57:21] you just stand there and stare down the
[57:22] bear. But what it is, if you find
[57:24] yourself in a situation,
[57:27] and I hope you hear me tonight, where
[57:29] you need a mountain moved, if you have
[57:31] love of the the love of God in your
[57:34] heart, you won't be fearful of it, but
[57:36] you'll have faith rise up and the
[57:38] mountain will move. So love creates a
[57:41] faith in you. And I hope this is okay
[57:42] tonight, but if you listen to the
[57:44] message, Perfect Faith, you'll find that
[57:46] brother Brandham actually ties these two
[57:47] together. And you can't have the faith
[57:49] that you need until you have love.
[57:52] Right. And so in in in 1 John 14 4:18 it
[57:56] said there is no fear in love but
[57:57] perfect love cast out fear because fear
[58:00] hath torment. He that fearth is not made
[58:02] perfect in love. And in verse 19 it says
[58:05] we love him because he first loved us.
[58:08] If a man say I love God and hateth his
[58:10] brother he is a liar. For he that loveth
[58:12] not his brother whom he hath seen. How
[58:13] can he love God whom he hath not seen?
[58:16] Amen. So perfect love will cast out the
[58:18] fear that is haunting you. Can you say
[58:21] amen tonight? Amen. You say, "Well, I'm
[58:23] sick and I'm scared." Amen. Love will
[58:26] cast out the fear of the sickness that's
[58:28] on you. Because if you love God, then
[58:31] you know that God is love and God will
[58:34] take care of his own. Can the church say
[58:36] amen? Amen. So, what we need tonight, if
[58:38] you need healing, it starts with love.
[58:41] If you need if if you need to get over
[58:42] that bitterness, it starts with love.
[58:44] Come on, church. If you need something
[58:46] for your children to be saved, listen,
[58:48] everybody wants their kids to come back.
[58:50] But you got to love them back. Come on,
[58:53] church. You You can't go after him and
[58:55] say, "You you know better than that. You
[58:56] you do this and you do that and and come
[58:58] at him with the law." Because if
[59:00] somebody would to come after you like
[59:01] that, you wouldn't be sitting here
[59:03] tonight. But it takes love. Come on,
[59:05] church. What we need tonight is more
[59:07] love among us. And the love of God will
[59:10] bring souls back to the house of God.
[59:14] It's human nature to want to go after
[59:16] them with force. It's human nature to
[59:18] want to go get our kids and bring them
[59:19] back or your kids and bring them back.
[59:21] I've got family, brothers and sisters. I
[59:23] I'd love to just go get them by the ear
[59:25] like, you know, it used to happen as a
[59:26] child myself and and just get them by
[59:28] the ear and drag them into church. But
[59:30] listen, it wouldn't do no good. But if
[59:32] you could love them back, then they
[59:34] might come back. And if you love them,
[59:36] you can say, "Lord, I'm giving them to
[59:37] you. I love you and you love me and
[59:40] every Come on, church. What we need is
[59:43] love. And you will see, amen, your loved
[59:45] ones coming back. Amen. But hate will
[59:47] never win nobody. Can you say amen?
[59:50] Amen. Disliking them and saying, "Well,
[59:52] you they know they're like the world."
[59:54] Most of the time, they know they're a
[59:55] sinner more than you know they're a
[59:56] sinner. They know more about themselves
[59:58] than you do. But what we need is to love
[1:00:00] them. You listen, you don't have to
[1:00:02] agree with them, but you do have to love
[1:00:04] them.
[1:00:07] And love will cover a multitude of sins.
[1:00:10] You say, "Well, I don't want to go join
[1:00:11] up with them." You don't have to join up
[1:00:13] with them. Live a good Christian life in
[1:00:15] front of them and watch them want to be
[1:00:17] like you. Because the truth is, it's not
[1:00:19] nearly as good out in the world as
[1:00:20] people make it make it look. People say,
[1:00:23] "Well, well, it's fun out here." Listen,
[1:00:25] listen. It ain't fun out there. They
[1:00:27] They've had a miserable life out there,
[1:00:29] man. But if you make your life and the
[1:00:31] message look miserable, then why do they
[1:00:32] want what you got?
[1:00:35] Come on, church. I hope this is okay.
[1:00:37] I'm not preaching at you. I'm preaching
[1:00:39] at me. If I look like I'm miserable
[1:00:40] sitting in church, then nobody wants
[1:00:42] what I got. Amen. But if the joy of the
[1:00:45] Lord is in you that comes from the love
[1:00:47] of God that is in you, then everybody's
[1:00:49] going to want what you got. Come on,
[1:00:51] church. This is what the world is dying
[1:00:54] for. A prophet said is more love. It's
[1:00:57] more godly love. A and we go on like
[1:01:00] this. And I know I'm running out of
[1:01:01] time, so I'll say it like this. Brother
[1:01:02] Ram said the church don't want that.
[1:01:04] They they want creed. He said we need
[1:01:06] love. The church is dying by creeds. It
[1:01:08] can only live by love because love is
[1:01:11] eternal life. Love overcomes all things.
[1:01:14] Love is the most powerful force there
[1:01:16] is. You say, "I need some force to go
[1:01:19] after my children." Love is the most
[1:01:21] powerful force there is. Amen. I need
[1:01:23] some love to go after. Come on, church.
[1:01:26] You ever seen love come into a church
[1:01:27] and and people were so in love with each
[1:01:29] other to where it it broke their hearts
[1:01:31] to to have to go home and not see each
[1:01:33] other for a week? Brother Brandham said
[1:01:35] that's the way it was at the Brandom
[1:01:36] Tabernacle at one point. Amen. And he
[1:01:38] said he wished he could see it that way
[1:01:40] again. I say tonight, I I I don't want
[1:01:42] to get to a place where where I could
[1:01:44] live or die or live without the people
[1:01:46] in the church. Amen. But I can't wait to
[1:01:47] see you walk through the doors and I
[1:01:49] can't wait to shake your hand and and
[1:01:51] come on church. What we need is more
[1:01:53] love and it will create a bond between
[1:01:56] us that nothing can separate. Can you
[1:01:59] say amen?
[1:02:00] It is the most powerful force there is.
[1:02:02] Brother Ray would go on. He said and
[1:02:04] he's talking about the greatest love
[1:02:05] story. He said when we were sinners,
[1:02:07] alienated without God in the world in
[1:02:08] that muck of mud. As I talked about this
[1:02:11] morning, God come to us. God sought you.
[1:02:14] You never sought God. No man can come to
[1:02:16] me except the father draws him first.
[1:02:18] And God came down in that muck that you
[1:02:20] were in and sought you out and brought
[1:02:22] you out. He said that ought to create a
[1:02:23] perfect love. Look what you was and look
[1:02:26] what you are.
[1:02:29] Think about where you've been and think
[1:02:30] about the only reason you are where you
[1:02:32] are is because of the love of God. Amen.
[1:02:34] Some of you have been backslid and you
[1:02:36] know what it's like out there to be back
[1:02:38] in the house of God and to be able to
[1:02:40] worship freely again without
[1:02:41] condemnation holding you back. Amen.
[1:02:43] Everybody in here needs to experience
[1:02:46] the love of God at least once. And if
[1:02:47] you've ever been, listen, if you've ever
[1:02:49] been in the presence of God and God has
[1:02:51] come down and spoke directly to your
[1:02:52] heart, then I want to tell you, you'll
[1:02:54] never be the same again. Amen. Love will
[1:02:57] come in there and change you, brother
[1:02:58] Paul. Amen. It'll make you different
[1:03:00] than you used to be. It'll make you act
[1:03:02] different, talk different. Listen, I
[1:03:04] know we're all still a work in progress.
[1:03:06] And that's why my love for you will look
[1:03:08] past your imperfections and your
[1:03:10] failures and your love for me will look
[1:03:13] past my imperfections and my failings
[1:03:15] because I fail God every day. Amen. But
[1:03:17] we get back up and we pray and we ask
[1:03:20] God to forgive us. And when we ask God
[1:03:22] to forgive us, that's because we love
[1:03:24] him and he returns his love. Amen. And
[1:03:27] and then there's a love for you. Amen.
[1:03:29] Come on, church. Amen. When somebody
[1:03:31] does you wrong, you don't go after them.
[1:03:32] Amen. with the law and things like that.
[1:03:34] Amen. But a Christian that loves you and
[1:03:37] you love them. Amen. You forgive them
[1:03:39] quickly and and you say, "Lord, they
[1:03:41] didn't mean that." Amen. It don't matter
[1:03:43] what you do to me. I want to love you
[1:03:45] anyway.
[1:03:46] Amen. You see what love is. Love covers
[1:03:50] all these things that that come up in
[1:03:51] the church. Even you just imagine
[1:03:53] something comes up and and somebody
[1:03:55] don't like somebody else. Listen, if
[1:03:56] real love is there, that thing will work
[1:03:58] itself out because two Christians are
[1:04:01] not going to stand there and fuss with
[1:04:02] one another for year on end and have a
[1:04:04] feud going and and I'm not talking about
[1:04:06] here in the church. But be careful that
[1:04:08] the devil will come in and try to cause
[1:04:10] that and try to break up unity in a
[1:04:12] church. Amen. We've been blessed with
[1:04:14] unity here in the church. But don't let
[1:04:15] the devil come in and make you think bad
[1:04:17] about somebody. Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:04:19] well, they're not living a good
[1:04:21] Christian life." Listen, if they're
[1:04:22] coming to the house of God, I say let
[1:04:24] them be Christians. If they're just a
[1:04:26] penny, let them be a penny. You say,
[1:04:28] "Well, I'm a silver dollar." Well, God
[1:04:29] bless you. But you still need to work on
[1:04:31] that about that that that attitude.
[1:04:33] Amen. You still need to work on that
[1:04:35] love because everybody has failed God at
[1:04:38] some point. We've got to love one
[1:04:40] another regardless of the failings and
[1:04:42] the imperfections.
[1:04:44] You say, "Well, I love everybody in this
[1:04:46] church and I don't love anybody in
[1:04:47] another message church." Listen, we're
[1:04:49] not This is not just the body of Christ
[1:04:50] in Hardy, Arkansas. There may be the
[1:04:52] body of Christ in another church or the
[1:04:54] body of Christ on down the road. Listen
[1:04:56] church, if you make it just us four and
[1:04:58] no more, then then you've missed it. We
[1:05:01] heard about it last Wednesday night
[1:05:02] about fellowship one with the other.
[1:05:04] Amen. If God is in your heart, you've
[1:05:05] got to fellowship because God is love.
[1:05:08] And and there's a there's an element of
[1:05:10] this love that is fellowship. I know
[1:05:12] that that that the filio love is the is
[1:05:14] the is is is the love for for a man and
[1:05:16] a woman and and all these things. But
[1:05:18] listen, even a godly love wants to
[1:05:20] fellowship. Amen. God is love. And God
[1:05:24] in the beginning wanted fellowship.
[1:05:28] Think about it. all the way back when
[1:05:30] everything was perfect and there was no
[1:05:31] sin and God wanted fellowship so
[1:05:34] fellowship so bad that he brought Adam
[1:05:36] and Eve on the earth and and then you
[1:05:38] know then we got sin and and then he has
[1:05:40] to actually send his only begotten son
[1:05:43] in order to save the people that he
[1:05:45] created from their sins. I mean that's
[1:05:47] real love, church. That's real love. He
[1:05:51] said he caught me. He said he caught me
[1:05:53] when I was nothing. I'm still nothing
[1:05:55] but I'm in his hand. He said, "He caught
[1:05:57] me and he loved me when I was unlovable.
[1:05:59] He loved you when you was unlovable, but
[1:06:01] he changed you." And he said, there's an
[1:06:03] old sister that said in her in her
[1:06:05] testimony, she said, "I'm not what I
[1:06:07] ought to be, and I'm not what I want to
[1:06:08] be, but I'm not what I used to be." We
[1:06:10] can all say that tonight. Amen. We're
[1:06:12] not. None of us are perfect yet. Only by
[1:06:14] the blood of Christ are we perfect.
[1:06:16] Amen. As long as I'm looking at I can
[1:06:18] look at brother Gabe and brother Gabe
[1:06:19] can look at me and and we can sit there
[1:06:21] and we can talk about all the
[1:06:22] imperfections that we've each got and
[1:06:24] and that ain't going to do nobody no
[1:06:26] good. I can you know I can I can live
[1:06:28] with I can go to Gab's house and sit
[1:06:29] there for a few days and and I can start
[1:06:31] picking at Gabe. He come to my house and
[1:06:33] start picking at me and probably never
[1:06:34] listen to me again. But you know what?
[1:06:36] The love of God in our hearts makes it
[1:06:38] to where we love one another regardless
[1:06:41] of if we fail at any time or another.
[1:06:44] Listen, he's going to fail. I'm going to
[1:06:46] fail. You're going to fail me. You're
[1:06:48] going to fail God. But God loved you
[1:06:50] anyway.
[1:06:52] Every time we think that we're too good
[1:06:54] to fail, be careful.
[1:06:57] Every time you think that you're better
[1:06:58] than somebody else, be real careful.
[1:07:02] Because just when you think that you're
[1:07:04] you've got more love than everybody
[1:07:05] else, be real careful
[1:07:09] because when you say, "Well, I've got so
[1:07:10] much love. I just wish that person would
[1:07:13] get over it and get over their
[1:07:14] attitude." Well, if you just love them,
[1:07:16] maybe they
[1:07:19] would. I want to go on down a little
[1:07:21] bit. I get off my notes and then I'll be
[1:07:23] all over the place. So, I'm just going
[1:07:24] to stay right here tonight. He loved you
[1:07:26] when you was unlovable. He said, "If
[1:07:29] God, when I was an alien from him, so
[1:07:32] loved me till he stooped down to get me
[1:07:33] and picked me up. That gives me
[1:07:35] confidence that he wants to use me. He's
[1:07:38] got a purpose in doing it. He's seen
[1:07:40] something in me. He's seen something in
[1:07:42] you. He had a reason to save you. Look
[1:07:45] at the people that's unsaved today. Look
[1:07:47] at the millions he could have took
[1:07:49] besides you, but he took you. No one can
[1:07:52] take your place. Think about that.
[1:07:56] Nobody can sit there, brother Bill,
[1:07:58] where you're sitting because God had
[1:08:00] ordained you to sit there tonight in
[1:08:02] that spot. And your footsteps in life,
[1:08:05] nobody else could have walked them like
[1:08:07] you did. Nobody. You can look back and
[1:08:10] say, "Well, I made mistakes." Yeah, he
[1:08:11] knew you would. And he he let you walk
[1:08:14] that road anyway.
[1:08:16] And and he had a purpose for doing it.
[1:08:19] And sometimes we lose focus on our
[1:08:21] purpose in life and we would do that. It
[1:08:23] makes us it makes us depressed or we get
[1:08:26] down or we think God doesn't love us
[1:08:27] anymore. But God lets you go through
[1:08:30] things to prove his love to you. Can the
[1:08:33] church say amen? Amen. that he he let
[1:08:35] Abraham get so far to where he almost
[1:08:38] took Abra Isaac's life just to prove
[1:08:42] that he still loved him just to prove he
[1:08:45] could still keep his word and and you
[1:08:47] think about Job you know Job was the
[1:08:49] most he was a righteous man a perfect
[1:08:51] man but God had to prove to him that he
[1:08:54] loved him can you say amen and so what
[1:08:57] we need tonight is to realize that when
[1:08:59] you go through a trial that doesn't mean
[1:09:00] that God doesn't love you but it means
[1:09:03] that God is letting having you go
[1:09:04] through that to prove his love to you.
[1:09:07] Sometimes we forget how much God loves
[1:09:09] us. But if you ever forget, I want you
[1:09:11] to think about the time that that you
[1:09:13] should have been on the cross, but he
[1:09:14] was there instead of you. I want you to
[1:09:16] think about the time when you failed God
[1:09:18] by telling a lie. And yet, you know that
[1:09:21] if you repented to God, it was as though
[1:09:23] you never did it in the first place.
[1:09:25] Come on, somebody. I want you to think
[1:09:26] about the time when you backslid on God.
[1:09:29] You got cold on God, and you couldn't
[1:09:31] come to church no more, but God brought
[1:09:33] you back. Why? Because he loved you in
[1:09:35] spite of your conditions of failing God.
[1:09:38] I want you to look back. Come on,
[1:09:39] somebody. Anybody with me tonight? I
[1:09:41] want you to think back to what you've
[1:09:43] done wrong to God and he loved you
[1:09:45] anyway. I want you to think of all the
[1:09:47] failings that you've had one time and
[1:09:49] say, "Look at what I've done, but look
[1:09:51] at what he did for me." Amen. It was
[1:09:53] grace by love that has brought me this
[1:09:56] far. And grace is going to lead you
[1:09:59] home. But it's all because somebody
[1:10:01] loved you. Amen. Somebody had to love
[1:10:05] you. Just think about it. You say, "Man,
[1:10:08] y'all are quiet tonight." But it's okay.
[1:10:10] Think about where you've been just one
[1:10:13] time and then try to think you're better
[1:10:14] than somebody else.
[1:10:18] I could do that right now and think if I
[1:10:21] think that way, I couldn't stand here
[1:10:22] before you. But I know that the blood
[1:10:25] still works. I know that he loved me
[1:10:27] enough, brother Justin. He took all my
[1:10:30] sins. was not part of my sins, but he
[1:10:32] loved me so much. He took every one of
[1:10:34] my sins and put him in the sea of
[1:10:36] forgetfulness, not to be remembered no
[1:10:38] more. Amen. You might remember him or or
[1:10:40] or my friends might remember him, but he
[1:10:42] don't even see them no more because of
[1:10:45] love.
[1:10:46] Is that okay? Tonight, Brother Random
[1:10:48] would go on like this. He said he's got
[1:10:50] a purpose in doing it. He said, "Look at
[1:10:51] the millions." But he took you. He He
[1:10:53] had a purpose. He said you're in God's
[1:10:56] economy. No one else could do it. That's
[1:10:58] his love to you. And brother Brandon
[1:11:00] would say this in in the message uh uh
[1:11:03] in this excuse me in the story or the
[1:11:05] vision uh beyond the curtain of time.
[1:11:08] Brother Neville actually was reading
[1:11:09] this part and I was listening to it and
[1:11:11] and you know brother Random tells us
[1:11:12] that nothing will enter there but
[1:11:13] perfect love. How many knows that? And
[1:11:16] so he says it like this. He said I am
[1:11:18] more convinced than ever in my life that
[1:11:21] it will take perfect love to enter that
[1:11:22] place. There was no jealousy, no
[1:11:25] tiredness, no sickness. I like that. No
[1:11:27] tiredness on a Wednesday night. No
[1:11:29] tiredness, no sickness, no old age, no
[1:11:32] death, only supreme beauty and joy.
[1:11:37] And he says, "Whatever you do, lay aside
[1:11:39] everything else until you get perfect
[1:11:41] love." I wonder if we could do that
[1:11:43] tonight, man. Lay aside every sin and
[1:11:46] every weight that would so easily beset
[1:11:48] you until you can get perfect love. Lay
[1:11:51] aside you you wanting to be something or
[1:11:53] you say, "Well, I want to be a
[1:11:54] preacher." Young people, I want to be a
[1:11:56] preacher. Amen. Get love first. Amen. I
[1:11:59] want to be a singer. I get love first. I
[1:12:01] want to be more active in the church.
[1:12:02] Amen. Get love first. Because if you
[1:12:04] love God, Amen. then you'll then then
[1:12:06] then the things will come natural to
[1:12:08] you. Amen. The desire will be there to
[1:12:10] serve. Amen. But you've got to have love
[1:12:12] first.
[1:12:14] Can you say amen? He said, "No." He
[1:12:16] said, "Whatever you do, lay aside
[1:12:17] everything else until you get perfect
[1:12:19] love. Get to where you can love
[1:12:20] everybody, even every enemy." Somebody
[1:12:23] say amen. He said, "No matter if the
[1:12:25] plane is rocking, the lightning is
[1:12:26] flashing, or the guns of the enemy are
[1:12:28] upon you, these things do not matter.
[1:12:30] Get perfect love." And the church said,
[1:12:34] "If you are not saved," he said, "accept
[1:12:35] Jesus Christ as your savior now. If
[1:12:37] you've not been baptized in water, be
[1:12:39] baptized now. If you have not received
[1:12:41] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, receive
[1:12:43] it now. Press on to that perfect love
[1:12:46] which will take you to that beautiful
[1:12:48] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[1:12:51] time." So what is it going to take?
[1:12:53] Perfect love.
[1:12:55] So brother Joel, what does it take to
[1:12:57] get perfect love? Accepting the gift
[1:12:59] that's already been given of
[1:13:01] love. How do I get love? You don't make
[1:13:04] love. You can't manufacture love. You
[1:13:06] can't wake up one morning and decide to
[1:13:08] have love.
[1:13:10] Love is something that you get when you
[1:13:12] are baptized and you're filled with the
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost and then love
[1:13:16] comes. But if you don't have that love,
[1:13:18] I would say this tonight. If you're
[1:13:21] lacking that
[1:13:22] thing, then I would seek love tonight.
[1:13:26] You know, you you you hear seeking the
[1:13:28] Holy Ghost and I believe that's that's
[1:13:29] where it starts. I believe you you you
[1:13:31] know, you you get saved and you accept
[1:13:34] the fact that God loved you and he died
[1:13:35] for you and but then you're baptized and
[1:13:38] you're filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:39] and at that point you can really mature
[1:13:42] into the Christian that has love. It's
[1:13:45] you can look at the pyramid that brother
[1:13:46] Brandham drew there and you can see that
[1:13:48] you could you could have all those
[1:13:50] things. Faith was right there as the
[1:13:52] foundation, but but right there on the
[1:13:54] capstone of it all was love. Brotherly
[1:13:57] kindness was right below it. Listen,
[1:13:58] we've got to have that to make it. If
[1:14:00] you think you're going to make it in
[1:14:01] with anything less than perfect love, I
[1:14:03] would say tonight, church, I would I I
[1:14:05] would say with all my heart, amen, get
[1:14:07] into this message and realize that it is
[1:14:09] going to take perfect love to get there
[1:14:12] because nothing else is going to work.
[1:14:14] Amen. Your money won't save you. The
[1:14:15] church won't save you. Your attendance
[1:14:17] to the church won't save you. Come on,
[1:14:19] somebody. You can say, "Well, I go to
[1:14:21] church three times a week." Attendance
[1:14:22] in the church is not going to save you.
[1:14:25] But love is going to take you to that
[1:14:27] place. Come on, church. I'm about to
[1:14:29] close, but I want I want to just say
[1:14:30] this to you now. Amen. If you could
[1:14:32] recognize how much he loves you, Amen.
[1:14:34] then you'll be able to love him in
[1:14:36] return. If you'll be able to recognize
[1:14:38] how much Sister Janie, every trial
[1:14:41] you've been through, he was there all
[1:14:42] the time and he loved you anyway. If you
[1:14:45] could ever get that in your mind that he
[1:14:47] never left me, he never let go of my
[1:14:49] hand. Amen. He never said he didn't love
[1:14:51] me. He never cast me away. But when the
[1:14:54] when the prodigal son was ready to come
[1:14:56] home, the father was waiting for him the
[1:14:58] whole time. Amen. He wasn't up there
[1:15:00] saying, "Well, if he comes back, he's
[1:15:02] going to have to work his way in." No
[1:15:04] love constrained him to watch for the
[1:15:06] one to come home. I want you to know
[1:15:08] tonight that God is waiting for you to
[1:15:10] lay aside every bitterness and every
[1:15:12] hateful feeling and every hateful thing
[1:15:15] in your mind. And are you still with me?
[1:15:17] Amen. God wants you to know that he
[1:15:19] loves you regardless of your past.
[1:15:23] Some of you, you know, I've heard your
[1:15:25] testimonies. I know how far you've been.
[1:15:26] I mean, God loved you then when you was
[1:15:28] the worst sinner. Amen. when you was the
[1:15:30] meanest man in in the city, as brother
[1:15:32] Brandon would preach, God loved you
[1:15:34] anyway. He still showed up to see you.
[1:15:37] Amen. But if he showed up to save you,
[1:15:39] then I think we it behooves us to show
[1:15:42] our love back to God and say, "Lord,
[1:15:44] thank you for saving a sinner like me.
[1:15:46] Thank you for taking the sins up my back
[1:15:49] and and going to Calvary for me. I can
[1:15:51] never praise him enough. I can never
[1:15:53] thank him enough." Are you still with
[1:15:55] me? I could never do anything, Amen. to
[1:15:58] to show him how much I love him in
[1:16:00] return. But I'm going to praise him
[1:16:02] because that may be all I can do. I'm
[1:16:04] going to show up and and say, "Lord, I
[1:16:06] I'm on your side here tonight. I'm going
[1:16:08] to do better. I'm I'm going to by your
[1:16:10] grace. I'm going to make it." That's all
[1:16:12] he wants from you. He wants you to come
[1:16:14] up with that last day. Amen. And be one
[1:16:16] of the ones that that he loved and he
[1:16:18] called, Amen. He wants you to be there
[1:16:21] more than anything else. And that's why
[1:16:23] he died for you. Amen. I wish the church
[1:16:25] would just know tonight. Amen. He loved
[1:16:27] you more than you could ever imagine
[1:16:29] that he loved you. He loves you more
[1:16:31] tonight. You say, "I don't feel it." It
[1:16:33] don't matter if you feel it. He loves
[1:16:35] you anyway. I wish I had a more more of
[1:16:37] an emotional No, it don't matter about
[1:16:39] your emotions because that's a that's a
[1:16:41] feelio love. But God's love loves you.
[1:16:43] No matter how you feel, no matter if you
[1:16:45] know he loves you or don't. Just know
[1:16:47] tonight by his word, he loves you. And
[1:16:50] if you could believe his word, then
[1:16:52] you'll know that all things have worked
[1:16:54] together for good in your life because
[1:16:56] he loves you. Amen. So I wonder tonight,
[1:16:59] church, and I am done. I want the
[1:17:00] musicians to go ahead and come. I want
[1:17:02] you to know tonight that God loved you
[1:17:04] before the foundation of the world when
[1:17:06] you were in the back parts of God's
[1:17:07] mind. And he knew every mistake you
[1:17:09] would make. He knew every thing you
[1:17:11] would do wrong. He knew every sin you
[1:17:13] would commit. Are you with me now? He
[1:17:15] knew every little every little
[1:17:16] backbiting you would do and every little
[1:17:19] time you would you would snarl or you
[1:17:21] would you would go against somebody and
[1:17:22] and you would have the wrong attitude.
[1:17:24] God loved you in spite of your
[1:17:27] shortcomings and he died for you even in
[1:17:30] that condition. So I would say tonight,
[1:17:32] is he worthy of our praise? Is he worthy
[1:17:35] of our love back to him? Amen. Is he
[1:17:37] worthy of everything we can give him?
[1:17:39] He's worthy because he loved us.
[1:17:44] Think about his love. Think about what
[1:17:46] he's done. And he will. Listen, church.
[1:17:51] You can't be the same person if you know
[1:17:53] how much he loves you.
[1:17:55] You can't look back at Calvary and be
[1:17:57] the same person.
[1:17:59] You can't look back and say, "Well, I'm
[1:18:01] just here by chance." Not if you ever
[1:18:03] look at the cross. Does the cross have
[1:18:06] any effect on us anymore? Have we gotten
[1:18:08] so revelated we can't see the cross?
[1:18:10] Because the cross is where it all began
[1:18:12] for me. And that's where it all began
[1:18:14] for you. Without the cross, there's
[1:18:16] nothing. Without the cross, come on,
[1:18:19] church. Without the cross, you wouldn't
[1:18:20] be here tonight. Without the cross,
[1:18:22] there was no beginning for you. Amen.
[1:18:24] And there would be no ending for you
[1:18:26] because none of us could live the law.
[1:18:28] But because he loved us, we can love him
[1:18:31] here tonight.
[1:18:33] And that's why he died was to show that
[1:18:36] he loved. You say, "Brother Joel, that's
[1:18:39] pretty simple. That's a whole scripture
[1:18:41] in the Bible right there you can take
[1:18:42] home. And if you could live that, buddy,
[1:18:45] you could be the best Christian in this
[1:18:48] church." Because that's what's lacking
[1:18:51] is
[1:18:52] love. Love. Say, "Brother Joel, who
[1:18:55] needs love here tonight?" Every one of
[1:18:56] us need more
[1:18:59] love. We haven't arrived yet at that
[1:19:01] place of perfection.
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:05] We're perfect under the blood. But but
[1:19:07] there's a place we got to get to where
[1:19:08] we can love our
[1:19:10] enemies. There's a place we've got to
[1:19:12] get to. You say, "Well, what if I still
[1:19:14] have hate?" Then it's time we start
[1:19:18] surrendering that to the Lord and say,
[1:19:19] "Lord, forgive me for the hate. Forgive
[1:19:22] me for the malice. Forgive me for the
[1:19:24] indifference. Don't let me
[1:19:26] boast. Don't let me envy and covet and
[1:19:29] have feelings against my brothers or
[1:19:30] sisters, but let me love them anyway."
[1:19:33] There's going to be a lot of people do
[1:19:34] you wrong, but you got to love them
[1:19:36] anyway. There's going to be people
[1:19:37] that's going to talk bad about you. But
[1:19:40] are you going to talk bad about them or
[1:19:42] you going to love
[1:19:45] them? That's where we got to get to.
[1:19:47] This was on my heart tonight because
[1:19:48] I've thought in the past something the
[1:19:50] devil's always fought me with is always
[1:19:52] trying to get even. And somebody talks
[1:19:54] about me, well, I'll tell you what, I
[1:19:56] I'm going to talk about you, too. But
[1:19:59] that's not godly love.
[1:20:01] Godly love is to pray for that
[1:20:05] person because you don't know who they
[1:20:07] are. And our pastor preached to us last
[1:20:10] week that bride don't persecute bride,
[1:20:12] but he said bride don't persecute.
[1:20:16] Period. Period. Elect don't persecute
[1:20:20] one another. So far be it for me to try
[1:20:23] to tell you who you are and who you're
[1:20:25] not. I want to say here tonight that we
[1:20:27] love we we've got love one for another.
[1:20:30] And when there's something between us we
[1:20:32] don't understand or if there's something
[1:20:33] between us that we we need to make right
[1:20:35] then we'll make it right. But at the end
[1:20:37] of the day we love one another as a
[1:20:39] brother and a sister. If you if you've
[1:20:41] ever had a sibling and you've ever
[1:20:44] fought and then somebody else tries to
[1:20:46] fight your family and you stand up for
[1:20:48] them. It's the way I feel
[1:20:50] sometimes. But we got to get past
[1:20:52] fighting with one another
[1:20:55] too because it don't do you any good. It
[1:20:58] don't do you no good to fight and fuss.
[1:21:01] Just think about all the time you spend
[1:21:02] fussing and feuding and
[1:21:04] Facebooking and you could be praying for
[1:21:08] a person. I wonder if we could do that
[1:21:10] tonight. I I hope this is okay. I don't
[1:21:12] want to overstep. I don't want you to
[1:21:14] think I'm preaching to you. I'm
[1:21:16] preaching to
[1:21:17] myself because if I've ever needed more
[1:21:20] love, it's now. And I don't just say
[1:21:22] those things just to say them. But it's
[1:21:24] true. when I get up here, it's not I
[1:21:25] don't think of a sermon, well, who can I
[1:21:27] go after in this sermon? No. No, it's
[1:21:29] something I need. And then I hope it's
[1:21:31] something you need because if we can
[1:21:32] grow together into that perfect love, I
[1:21:35] believe we're going to make it. I
[1:21:36] believe we got a home on the other side
[1:21:38] that's already been prepared for us. And
[1:21:40] I I do believe with all my heart, Sister
[1:21:42] Alice, we're going soon. But I believe
[1:21:45] we've got to have love one for the
[1:21:46] other. And it it'll make us forget our
[1:21:49] our differences. It'll make us forget,
[1:21:52] you know, it'll make us forget all the
[1:21:54] the little things.
[1:21:56] You know, you do something, you drive a
[1:21:58] different type of car or you you do
[1:22:00] something different, you got a different
[1:22:01] haircut than I
[1:22:04] do. Those little things don't matter so
[1:22:06] much when you have love one for the
[1:22:10] other. And what it does, it really
[1:22:12] creates something in your heart to
[1:22:14] where when you see somebody going
[1:22:16] astray, you don't lash out at them, but
[1:22:19] you start praying for them.
[1:22:21] You say, "Well, so and so in the church,
[1:22:22] they're backslid." Did you pray for
[1:22:25] them? Somebody got cold on God. We'll
[1:22:27] preach it. But did you pray for them?
[1:22:30] Amen. Because more than anything, more
[1:22:33] than the words I say to you over this
[1:22:34] pulpit is the love I have for you
[1:22:36] that'll do you
[1:22:38] good. Can you say amen?
[1:22:42] And he goes when when brother Brandham
[1:22:43] goes over there and he sees all the
[1:22:44] things on the other
[1:22:46] side. He said it was nothing but perfect
[1:22:49] love. You said, "Brother Joel, can we
[1:22:52] achieve that on this side?" I would say
[1:22:54] you're always going to have your sticky
[1:22:56] nature. And so you're going to fight
[1:22:57] that till the day you die.
[1:23:00] But I think if we could just every time
[1:23:02] that rises up in us, if we could just
[1:23:04] say, you know what, I was a sinner and
[1:23:07] I've just been saved by God's amazing
[1:23:11] grace. Just think about you being the
[1:23:13] sinner. Thinking about your brother and
[1:23:16] sister being bad. You say, "Well, I've
[1:23:17] been bad, too. And and if God saved me,
[1:23:20] he can save anybody. If God loved me, he
[1:23:23] can love anybody." Can the church say
[1:23:25] amen? Somebody in here has been a bad
[1:23:27] person and they've lived a bad life and
[1:23:29] they've backslid on God. But because he
[1:23:31] loved you, you're able to sit here
[1:23:33] tonight and worship freely because of
[1:23:38] love. It's the greatest force. It's the
[1:23:41] greatest of all these things in First
[1:23:43] Corinthians is love. And that's what we
[1:23:46] want to seek after here tonight. I
[1:23:48] wonder if we could stand to our feet.
[1:23:50] What if we could just sing this with all
[1:23:52] of our hearts? And if you need prayer
[1:23:53] tonight or if you just need to talk to
[1:23:55] God right where you're sitting, we'll
[1:23:57] take a few minutes to do that. Is it
[1:24:01] okay? Love on
[1:24:04] Cal tree. Oh, I love
[1:24:07] him.
[1:24:10] Oh,
[1:24:12] I love
[1:24:16] him.
[1:24:18] I love him.
[1:24:22] him
[1:24:24] because he
[1:24:27] first. Oh, if you believe that tonight,
[1:24:29] I wonder if you'd put a hand up to him
[1:24:31] and say, "Thank you for loving me,
[1:24:33] Lord." Oh,
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:36] and just
[1:24:39] my
[1:24:45] salvation. Long
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:49] cow
[1:24:52] green tree with all your hearts now. I
[1:24:56] love him. Oh, singing.
[1:25:01] I love
[1:25:04] him. Oh yes,
[1:25:07] I love
[1:25:09] him. He calls.
[1:25:14] He
[1:25:16] first loved
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:21] me and
[1:25:25] purchase
[1:25:28] my
[1:25:33] salvation on
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:41] Cal tree. I wonder if we could sing it
[1:25:43] like this. I love you,
[1:25:45] Jesus. Oh,
[1:25:49] I love you,
[1:25:53] Jesus.
[1:25:55] I love you, Jesus.
[1:26:00] Because you
[1:26:04] first love
[1:26:09] me and
[1:26:13] purchase
[1:26:16] my my
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:19] [Applause]
[1:26:21] salvation on Cal.
[1:26:28] breeze tree. You know that song, I love
[1:26:31] you for you are mine. I love you for you
[1:26:34] are
[1:26:35] divine. Go up
[1:26:38] one. I love
[1:26:40] you for
[1:26:42] you are mine.
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:48] Oh, I love
[1:26:51] you for you
[1:26:54] are
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:58] divine. Oh, I love
[1:27:02] you
[1:27:04] forever. It's true.
[1:27:10] You are
[1:27:12] Jesus and
[1:27:15] I love you with all your hearts now.
[1:27:20] Oh, I love
[1:27:23] you for
[1:27:25] you are mine. I love you for you are
[1:27:30] divine. Oh, I love
[1:27:33] you for you
[1:27:36] are divine.
[1:27:41] Oh yes, I love
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:47] forever is
[1:27:51] true. You are
[1:27:55] Jesus and
[1:27:57] I love you. Can we sing it one more
[1:28:00] time? Do you love him here tonight?
[1:28:02] Oh, I love
[1:28:05] you for you.
[1:28:08] are
[1:28:12] mine. Oh yes, I love
[1:28:15] you for you
[1:28:18] are
[1:28:20] divine. I love you forever. It's true.
[1:28:24] Oh, I love
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:29] forever. It's
[1:28:31] true. You are Jesus and I love you. You
[1:28:35] are
[1:28:37] Jesus and
[1:28:39] I love you. Do you love him here
[1:28:43] tonight? Amen. I wonder I hope there was
[1:28:47] something said that would help you.
[1:28:48] Amen. Just just remember he loved you
[1:28:51] and if he loved you then we ought to
[1:28:53] love him and we ought to love one
[1:28:55] another. Amen. I like the song. He
[1:28:57] looked beyond my faults and saw my
[1:29:00] needs. You know, if he could love us
[1:29:02] like that and if the love of God is in
[1:29:04] our hearts, then we've got to get to a
[1:29:07] place where we can look beyond everybody
[1:29:08] else's
[1:29:09] faults and see that they have a
[1:29:13] need. Maybe they do. Maybe they have
[1:29:15] fallen away from God. Or maybe somebody
[1:29:17] is maybe they really have a problem, but
[1:29:20] maybe nothing's going to help that but
[1:29:21] love. And I wonder just tonight if we
[1:29:24] could just lay aside everything in our
[1:29:26] hearts that would hinder us from perfect
[1:29:28] love and say, "Lord, create in me a
[1:29:31] clean heart full of love for my brother,
[1:29:35] for my sister, for the sinner, and for
[1:29:38] the
[1:29:39] saints. And let us just love like we've
[1:29:42] never loved before." Well, I'll sing
[1:29:43] this one one more time, and then I'll
[1:29:44] let brother Allen sing something he
[1:29:46] knows.
[1:29:47] Oh yes, I love
[1:29:51] you
[1:29:53] forever. It's
[1:29:57] true. You are
[1:30:01] Jesus and
[1:30:04] I love
[1:30:06] you. Oh yes, I love
[1:30:11] you. For
[1:30:14] you are mine. Is he yours tonight? Oh
[1:30:19] yes. I love
[1:30:22] you for you
[1:30:24] are you are
[1:30:28] divine. Oh yes. I love
[1:30:32] you
[1:30:35] forever. It's true.
[1:30:40] You are
[1:30:43] Jesus and
[1:30:45] I love you. If you love him, can you
[1:30:48] give him a hand clap of praise tonight?
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:57] Amen. Sing this just before we
[1:31:00] go.
[1:31:03] Consume me
[1:31:06] Lord of your spirit.
[1:31:10] Consume me
[1:31:12] Lord and make me more like
[1:31:17] you. Break me
[1:31:20] Lord and bless the broken pieces of my
[1:31:28] life. Let me be
[1:31:31] used more by you.
[1:31:37] Oh,
[1:31:38] consume me Lord with the fire of your
[1:31:45] spirit.
[1:31:47] Consume me Lord and make me more like
[1:31:53] you. Break me
[1:31:57] Lord and bless the broken pieces of my
[1:32:02] life.
[1:32:05] Let me be
[1:32:07] used
[1:32:09] more by once
[1:32:12] again. Oh,
[1:32:15] consume me Lord with the fire of your
[1:32:21] spirit.
[1:32:23] Consume me
[1:32:25] Lord and make me more like you.
[1:32:31] Break me
[1:32:33] Lord and bless the broken pieces of my
[1:32:40] life. Let me be
[1:32:43] used more by
[1:32:48] you. Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand
[1:32:50] clap of
[1:32:53] praise? I just appreciate that service
[1:32:56] this evening. Appreciate our brother.
[1:32:57] And let's sing that song. We'll sing
[1:32:59] this one time through. Then you're free
[1:33:00] to go. Same key of D. Thank you,
[1:33:03] Jesus. Amen. We got a lot to thank him
[1:33:05] for for the grace he's given us. Amen.
[1:33:10] Thank
[1:33:12] you,
[1:33:17] Jesus, for the grace that you
[1:33:21] have given
[1:33:24] us. And though I can repay from my
[1:33:30] heart, I would like to say that
[1:33:35] I thank one more time before we go.
[1:33:40] Oh,
[1:33:42] thank
[1:33:44] you
[1:33:48] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:33:53] have given
[1:33:56] us. And though I can repay from my
[1:34:02] heart, I would like to
[1:34:04] say that
[1:34:07] I thank you're free to go in the name of
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:10] Lord. Oh,
[1:34:13] thank
[1:34:15] you
[1:34:20] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:34:25] have given us.
[1:34:29] Though I can repay from my heart, I
[1:34:34] would like to say that
[1:34:38] I thank
[1:34:42] you. I just
