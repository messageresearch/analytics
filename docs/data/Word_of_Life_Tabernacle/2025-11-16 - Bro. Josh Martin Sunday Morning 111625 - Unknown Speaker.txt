Heat. Heat. At last I lay down. Yes, I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Sing the course again now. Oh, so I'll cherish the old rug and cross until my trophies at last I lay down. Oh, I will cling to the orug cross and exchange for a ground. Amen. How many is happy to be in church this morning? Amen. Good to see each and every one of you here. Looking forward to what the Lord has for us. Amen. Can we try that heart of worship? And when the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply come longing just to breathe something that's worth that will bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within. Through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.

And Lord, we just ask that we would hear from heaven this morning, Father. Lord, that we would hear you speaking to us, Lord. Lord, that you would anoint our ears to hear, our eyes to see. And Father, these requests, Lord, I'm sure there's more requests in the building, but these that were read, Lord, we know that you already knew about them before the foundation of the world. And Father, that you are capable of interceding at any moment. Lord, we know that by your stripes, we are healed. Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one here, Lord, upon these requests. Lord, you know the end from the beginning. You can see farther than we can, Lord. You know, we know that there's purpose in everything. There's purpose in every sickness and every temptation and every mind battle and everything we go through. Lord, you're there. Romans 8:28, Father. Lord, we believe that. And Lord, we just commit these to you and give it all to you. We ask that your blood would wash over it, Father, in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Because of who you are, I give you glory. Oh, because of who you are, I give you praise.

Did you tell me yes or no? I can't remember. Yes. Okay. Thank you. She was probably going to sing anyway, no matter what she told me, but Amen. We we appreciate the talent that God's placed among us. How many appreciates our singers here in the church? Give them a nice hand if you would. He left the splendor of heaven. knowing his destiny was the lonely hill of God there to lay down his life for me. And if that is a love, the ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. If that is a love in heaven, there's no feeling like this. is if that is love even in death. He remembered the thief hanging by his side. He spoke with love and compassion. Then you took him to Paris and if that is a love the ocean is dry. There's stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. That is our love in heaven. There's no feeling like this. If that is love, y'all sing it with me. If that is alone, the ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the spirit opens love. That is love in heaven. There's no feeling like this. That is love. There's no feeling like this. If that is enough, Amen. You believe that? This morning, Sister Anna is going to sing for us. Amen. Just worship the Lord as she sings now. There ain't no devil. Baby, turn around. There ain't no devil. Tell me God is dead. There ain't no devil. Take away my healing. There ain't no devil. Stop what God is starting. He saved me. Save me. Now I'm more than a road. He had mercy on my soul. More than a bar. He loved me when I was walking up there. There ain't no devil turn around. There ain't no devil. Tell me God is dead. There ain't no devil. Take away my healing. There ain't no devil. It's not what got us started. He reached down his hand for me. I was walking a barrel. He healed me of those chains. Walking a barrel. He delivered me. I've been set free. Walking up. There ain't no devil. It gets turn around. There ain't no devil. Tell me God is there ain't no devil. Take away my healing.

Ain't no devil take my victory. There ain't no devil. may return right now. Tell me God is there. It's going to keep my family on. There ain't nothing. learnable. It's not what got us started. Amen. If that don't light your fire, your wood's wet. Amen. Wasn't that good? Amen. Give the Lord another hand. He's worthy of it this morning. Let's stand together. Amen. Are you Are you ready for the word of the Lord this morning? Amen. I tell you what, uh we've heard about how he left the splendor of heaven and you know, he showed his love to us and I'll guarantee you there's no greater love than this. That one would lay down his life for his friends. Aren't you thankful that he did it? Nobody else died for me but Jesus. And so we're here to worship Jesus this morning. That's that's it's what it's all about. It's what it's all about. Amen. Aren't you thankful? The prophet stood and declared. He said he said, "I am here." He said, "My ministry is here to declare that he is here. And if he's here this morning, I don't care what sickness you've got on you. It can be it can be healed right here this morning." It was already healed, but it's time we claim our healing this morning. It's time we go ahead and just take our victory. You say, "Well, the walls hadn't fell down yet." Well, I'll tell you what. Just go ahead and march around them walls and start shouting anyway and just watch the walls start falling. I believe this morning we could just have a good time in the Lord. Amen. Just pull on the gift of God. Ain't going to hurt nobody to say amen. Going to hurt nobody to raise your hand and just I tell you what, a preacher, it's a hard it's a hard job to preach the message of the hour with people staring at you. But if you just pull on the gift of God, operate the gift, you know, you have to operate the gift in the pulpit. You can't leave a service and say, "Well, that preacher failed me today." No, it's all on you right now. If you operate that gift, watch the I know the brother's been in his study. I know the word's going to be preached. Let's pull on the gift of God. Amen. That brother Josh loves the message with all of his heart. Amen. His family means a lot to us here at the church. I know his dad, Brother Wendell, is is a real uh real blessing to us during our meetings. And and uh and we just love Brother Josh Martin. So, he's going to come and he's going to come and preach for us or sing whatever he wants to do. Amen. Let's just open our hearts to receive this morning and just pull on the gift. You going to do that this morning? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Let's sing this with all of our hearts as you come now. Holy me. Every day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials. And he's guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality cuz Jesus is holding me. Oh, I know something keeps holding me every day. My all my trust constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. And Jesus is holding me. One more time now. Oh, something keeps holding me. Overcome my tri guiding me constantly. Giving me victory. holding me. Amen. I trust that's your your confession this morning that something is holding me. And it's incredible the grace of God that it's a keeping power as brother Brandham would tell that the testimony of how when he lost his wife and his daughter and somebody would ask him, "Do you still what do you think about your God now?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "I think of him the same. He's still faithful. And the critic would say to him, "Oh, you kept your religion, huh?" He says, "No, my religion kept me." &gt;&gt; And it's incredible that the keeping power of God ain't just there when you're on the mountaintop, but it's when you're in the valley. In the times of decision, the grace of God is there. The time of discouragement, the time of victory, it don't matter what season you're in, the grace of God is still going to remain. And it's a keeping power over our lives. Are you thankful for that? out this morning. Amen. Well, it's good to be with y'all here today. I count it an honor and a privilege to be here. I I appreciate the invitation by brother Ben to to come and minister as it's been said before, but it's always uh uh an honor to come and minister when the pastor is there, but when he has confidence in you when you're when he's away to invite you to come, that's always a something a minister don't take for granted. So I pray something can be said this morning to to be a blessing. But first Peter 1 and1 and we'll read that down to the second verse. Then Galatians 3 and 28. I bring greetings from my my pastor brother Wenda Martin and the saints there new life outreach there in Pawne. They they send their greetings and we sure love the church here and and your pastor and and brother Joel and all of the the workers here. We we sure love and appreciate all of y'all. I know the the the meetings were a blessing back a few months ago. We was able to make it for a few of the services and I know it's a lot of work and effort goes into it, but it sure sure was a blessing to me personally. So I I appreciate all that y'all do. First Peter 1 and1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Punctus, Galatia, Capidosia, Asia and Bethneia elect according to the fornowledge of God the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. and Galatians 3 and and 28, the Bible would say, "There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female. For ye all are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you be Christ, then you're Abraham's seed and heir according to the promise." Are you thankful for that this morning? Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're thankful for this opportunity that we have to come into your house one more time, Lord. God, we're thankful for your presence that we feel among us, God. &gt;&gt; Lord, there's an atmosphere that's been created, Lord. We ask that you would just feel welcome here among us, Father. Lord, you know the needs and the desires of every one of the hearts that are that are sitting here, Lord. We're we're a needy people, Father, and only you can can change lives and situations, Lord. We ask that you would just have your way today. We give you the preeminence in this service. Father, we commit all of these things into your hands in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated here this this morning. I just have a a simple thought, but it would be on the lines of elected strangers. And and here uh the apostle Peter is addressing these words to the strangers that are scattered throughout these places. And whenever you look at the word stranger, it's always connected with the words pilgrim and and souljourner. And we can look in in the Bible, the children of Israel was always likened unto strangers or pilgrims. And you can look in the uh book of Leviticus 25 and 23. The land shall not be sold forever, for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and souljourers with me. In Hebrews 11:13, these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them and confessed they were strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. And and I believe that God has has called us to be a separated people. You know, I don't believe he's called us to fit in with the world. We're we're walking among the world, but we're but we're not to be a part of them. and and I think it's an incredible thing how that that God would call a people in the most wicked age that there's ever been for his name's sake and would set her apart and and brother Brandham would say but a little something you might look at here in this in the scripture those who sought this new city acted different they professed they were pilgrims and strangers but on the side of Cain they became fugitives and renegades but Christians were pilgrims and strangers A fugitive has no home. A renegade is a horrible person. But a pilgrim is something real from a real land in another nation trying to find his way home professing by his living that he has something that he's from another country. And I think it's a powerful how how brother Brandham is describing that that we have something different. A pilgrim is something real. So I believe a pilgrim is more than just a confession that that I don't belong here and I'm heading somewhere. But brother Brandham says he's professing by his living that he has something. So in other words, there's an ambition that a pilgrim has that is pushing him or or driving him to a destination that he has in mind. And and I believe that's what separates the serpent seed and the bride of Christ. And brother Brandham would even say that on the side of Cain, the serpent seed, the fugitives and renegades. And and he would get that from the from the book of Genesis when when God would come and ask Cain where where his brother was. And he would say, "My brother's keeper." He would say that the the void the blood cries out against him and and he would put a mark on Cain. It would say, "You're going to be a fugitive and a renegade." So that is the side of Cain. But you can look that the bride is not a fugitive or a renegade. They belong somewhere. Even though they might not belong here, there's a place that God has predestinated that we come from and we're going back to. And it's like Jesus would say, "I come from God and I'll go back to God." So I believe that's the CONFESSION OF THE BRIDE as well. We come from God AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. And I believe that that this message has given us an ambition. We we we might not know what tomorrow holds, but we know who holds tomorrow. We might not know when when the body change is going to take place or or the rapture is going to take us out of here, BUT WE KNOW IF GOD SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT. WE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND UNDERSTAND how things are going to happen, BUT THERE'S A FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD. IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT. AND AND THAT GIVES AN AMBITION TO GET INTO THE WORD of the Lord because if the word is FULL OF PROMISES, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE PROMISED ME. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY FUTURE IS. AND AND THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE ambition of the bride is there's A FUTURE THAT IS CONCRETED. There's a FUTURE THAT THAT GOD HAS ALREADY PLACED OUT THAT ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW THE VISION and act out what God has GIVEN US. AND THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE serpent seat. ALL THEY HAVE IS WHAT'S UPON THE EARTH and and their ambitions in the stock market. It's in it's in their money in in their their their houses and their cars AND AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE STRIVING FOR. And and I believe we need to make a living. WE WE NEED TO PROVIDE for our families. BUT BUT THAT'S NOT OUR AMBITION. BUT SERPENT SEED, THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE BECAUSE ONCE THEY GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE, THEY HAVE NOTHING LEFT. COULD you imagine living a life and believing there's no God? Could you imagine living a life and believing there's no THERE'S NO HEAVEN? WHAT WHAT ARE YOU STRIVING FOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FUTURE? BUT YOU CAN LOOK AT JEREMIAH 29 and 11. FOR I KNOW THE THOUGHTS THAT I think towards you, SAITH THE LORD, THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND NOT OF EVIL, TO GIVE YOU AN EXPECTED END. SO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE MUCH WE CAN OFFER HERE BUT WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT GOD HAS GIVEN us and it's AN EXPECTED END. HALLELUJAH. YOU SEE WE DON'T GO BY ANYTHING OR GO THROUGH ANYTHING BY ACCIDENT. BUT GOD HAS ALREADY SEEN IT AND HAS PROVIDED A WAY OUT of it. AND SO THAT'S WHY IF IF you lose a loved one maybe that goes by the way of the grave, YOU DON'T SORROW LIKE OTHERS WITHOUT HOPE SORROWS BECAUSE YOU HAVE an expectation. You can look at 1 Thessalonians 4:16. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel and the the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. WHEREFORE COMFORT ONE ANOTHER WITH THESE WORDS. AND SO IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THERE'S COMFORT IN THE AMBITION THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE SOMEBODY BY THE WAY OF the grave, 1 Thessalonians 4:13 would say, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, BRETHREN, CONCERNING THEM WHICH ARE ASLEEP." THEY'RE NOT DEAD. THEY'RE JUST RESTING. THAT YOU SORROW NOT EVEN AS OTHERS WHICH HAVE NO HOPE. SO WE SORROW, BUT WE DON'T SORROW LIKE THEM THAT HAVE NO HOPE. WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS PUSHING US AND KNOWING WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM ONCE AGAIN. AND AND THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE WORD OF the Lord. If if you have a teenager THAT IS MIGHT BE MIGHT BE REBELLIOUS, YOU CAN COMFORT YOURSELF IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. IF IF YOU'RE DISCOURAGED AND AND YOU CAN'T YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP, THERE'S A COMFORT IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. IT WOULD BE DAVID THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO COURAGE HIMSELF IN THE LORD BECAUSE THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT HIS FLESH WAS DISTRESSED AND HIS FAMILY WAS TAKEN AWAY. HIS WARRIORS THAT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WAS TAKEN AWAY. They they WOULD PICK UP STONES TO STONING. BUT YET THERE WAS A COMFORT ON THE INSIDE THAT WOULD COMFORT HIM IN THE TIME OF DISTRESS. AND AND I BELIEVE SOMETIMES OUR BACK may be against the wall, BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. YOU CAN TURN ON A TAPE OR OR COME TO CHURCH AND AND YOUR PASTOR AS HE BEGINS TO PREACH. THERE'S A COMFORT THAT COMES FROM THOSE WORDS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION. WE KNOW WE HAVE A AN AN END THAT we're working for. AND AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES US FROM THE SERPENT SEAT IS WE HAVE A DIRECTION. WE HAVE SOMETHING we're striving for. Because many times when you think OF A PILGRIM, YOU THINK OF somebody that is just roaming and and they got no direction. They have no no no no no no no no no no no no place they're trying to get to. But if you think about it, a pilgrim has more of A DIRECTION THAN THAT OF THE LOCALS BECAUSE ALL HE HAS IS THIS DIRECTION. HE HE HAS NO HOME. HE HE MIGHT NOT HAVE NO FAMILY. HE MIGHT NOT have a bank account. And the only THING HE HAS IS THE FUTURE THAT HE HAS in mind. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD HAVE A HOMELESS man that that would come and knock on his door and and would want want some food and brother Brandham would would bring him inside, give him a sandwich and ask him, "Where were you going?" He says, "Oh, nowhere." HE SAYS, "WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?" HE SAYS, "OH, NOWHERE." He says, "Wherever my hat is resting, that's the place I call home." And and he, Brother Brand, I'm going to ask the man, "How long have you been doing this?" He says, "For about 20 years." He says the man HAD NO AMBITIONS TO BETTER HIMSELF. And you can look at the children of Israel HOW THAT WHEN THEY GOT INTO the promised land that then they would say, "GIVE US A KING THAT WE CAN BE LIKE THE other ones." So it's easy when you GET SETTLED IN TO LOSE YOUR DRIVE. It's it's EASY WHEN THINGS ARE GOING GOOD that you lose your AMBITION AND THEN YOU want a king like the rest of the nations. BUT BUT LET ME SAY THIS. GOD HAS CALLED US NOT to fit in, BUT HE'S CALLED US TO BE A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. WE'RE A CHOSEN GENERATION THAT HAS BEEN SET APART AND BEEN GIVEN AN AMBITION. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE AN AMBITION IS WHAT DRIVES YOU. AND and brother Brown would would he would tell us that that when you're young, HE SAYS YOU SET YOUR AMBITIONS TO what you want to do. And he says, "You find it in your mind and and then it drops into your heart and then your ambitions drive you to it." AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE NATURAL. BUT THE same thing happens IN THE SUPERNATURAL. WE TAKE ON THE MIND OF CHRIST AND AND THEN THAT DRIVES US TO WHAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO DO. AND AND SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US TALKING about his wife, and he would and she said, "Well, then we're not Americans. What are we?" I said our kingdom is from above. And so we are free. We're born again. The kingdom of God is within you. See, act like up there. You're delegates from there. I said we're citizens here living in the flesh, but our spirits were pilgrims AND STRANGERS. WE'RE FOREIGN TO THE world now, even our own nation. for we have accepted the invitation when a KNOCK AT OUR HEART TO BE A TO BECOME A PART OF him his word AND SO THERE'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW HOW BROTHER BRANDHAM he he would explain how do we become a pilgrim and a stranger he says our flesh is citizens here here BUT OUR SPIRIT MAN IS CITIZENS OF ANOTHER country another PLACE AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY MANY TIMES. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BECOME a part of the kingdom of God? HE WOULD SAY BY ONE SPIRIT WE'RE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES us that we're walking in the earth, but we're not a part of the earth. And and THEN BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHEN IT KNOCKED OUT OUR HEART to become a part of him, his word. AND SO THAT AND WHAT WHAT I THINK IS IS AN INCREDIBLE THING THAT ACCEPTING THE INVITATION IS MORE THAN A SINNER'S PRAYER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD HAS THAT THE NOMINAL CHURCH MEMBERS IS THEY'RE GETTING MEMBERS ALL OF THE TIME AND IT'S JUST A SINNER'S PRAYER. COME COME RECITE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE BORN INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM IS TELLING US IT'S MORE THAN THAT. YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE WORD WHEN IT KNOCKS UPON YOUR HEART. AND ONLY THE ONES THAT HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE IS GOING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION. CUZ IT WAS JESUS THAT WOULD SAY, "THE PEOPLE DRAW NIGH UNTO ME with their mouth honorth me with their lips, BUT THEIR HEARTS IS FAR FROM ME." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH. RIGHT? Revelations 3, BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK. IF ANY MAN open the door, I WILL COME IN AND WILL S WITH HIM. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH. THE VOICE OF GOD, WHICH IS THE WORD, IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH TRYING TO get in. AND IF YOU LOOK AT REVELATIONS 3, THERE'S NO CLAIMING in that verse. I STAND AT THE DOOR. IF ANY man hear MY VOICE AND OPEN THE DOOR, THAT'S A WHOSOEVER WILL. It's and brother Brandon would tell us, GOD DOES NOT GIVE JUDGMENT WITHOUT FIRST GIVING WARNING. SO GOD HAS GOT TO GIVE THE CHURCH A CHANCE AT THE WORD IN ORDER FOR HIM TO BE A JUST GOD. BUT THERE'S NO HEART TO RECEIVE IT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. THE BRIDE OF CHRIST MIGHT BE A STRANGER, BUT THEY'RE ELECTED TO RECEIVE THE WORD WHEN IT KNOCKS UPON THEIR HEART. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING. IT'S NOT BY YOUR OWN ACCORD OR YOUR OWN MERITS. IT WAS A DEEP CALLING INTO THE DEEP. AND WHEN THE WORD WOULD CALL OUT YOUR NAME, THERE WOULD BE A HEART TO RECEIVE IT. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR THAT THIS MORNING? BUT WHEN MAYBE WHEN FAMILY MEMBERS TURNED AWAY OR OR CHURCH MEMBERS TURNED AWAY, PASTORS MAY HAVE DENOUNCED THE MESSAGE, YOU'RE STILL SITTING HERE WITH THE REVELATION, IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT WOULD CALL YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND SO CHRIST HAS GIVEN THE CHURCH A CHANCE. But brother Brandham would say church members want a denominational FILTER SO THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN DESIRE OR THEIR OWN AMBITION AND STILL be classified religious people. SO THEY WANT TO BE CALLED A CHRISTIAN BUT HAVE THEIR OWN AMBITION. BUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST SAYS IT'S THE WORD AND THE WORD ALONE. WHATEVER THE WORD SAYS THAT IS YAY AND AMEN. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US AND HE WOULD SAY IF you want to see the condition of the church he would say look at the women right he says the condition OF THE WOMEN DESCRIBES THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH and we're living in a w a women's world AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HE WOULD see these THINGS HE HE WOULD SAY THAT THAT WOMEN would rather have dogs and cats instead of birthing children he says because it'll deform their bodies and make their bodies ugly HE SAYS YOU CAN'T GO TO THE CLUBS WITH A WITH A NURSING CHILD. And so they would rather they would rather MOTHER A A DOG OR A CAT INSTEAD OF BRINGING FORTH LIFE. AND THEN HE WOULD SAY THE CHURCH IS doing the same thing. HE SAYS SHE'S INCRED SHE SHE'S IMPREGNATED WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE SHE'S bringing forth members all of the time. BUT SHE DOES NOT WANT THESE ACTS 238 SCREAMING, HOLLERING, BABBLING CHILDREN. BUT HE SAYS THAT'S THE ONLY KIND THAT THE CHURCH WILL BRING FORTH. SO THEY WANT TO BE LABELED A CHRISTIAN, BUT THEY WANT THEIR OWN AMBITIONS. THEY DON'T WANT TO ACT OUT THE WORD FOR THIS AGE. BUT THERE'S A TRUE CHURCH THAT IS THE TRUE BRIDE. THERE'S BEEN CHURCHES, CHURCHES, BRIDES, BRIDES. BUT THERE'S GOING TO COME ONE THAT IS GOING TO TAKE ON THE HEADSHIP OF THE WORD AND BE PRODUCING THE WORD IN THIS GENERATION. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON, HE'S DESCRIBING THE CHURCH AND and the and the and the women of the day. And then he says THIS HERE. NOTICE THIS CHARACTER WHEN YOU SEE WOMEN JUST GO ON the rampage just just doing anything they want to do. HE SAYS, "WATCH THE CHURCH IS DOING the same thing." HE SAYS, "NOTICE. BUT WATCH WHEN THE SPIRITUAL BRIDE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO HAVE A REVIVAL, WHEN SHE BEGINS TO COME BACK AND LINE HERSELF UP WITH THE WORD OF GOD. WATCH THEN AGAIN. YOU'VE SEEN HOW THE SCRIPTURES AT THAT TIME THERE BE A MESSAGE SWEEP OUT TO CATCH THE BRIDE, CATCH THE WOMAN ELECT. SO WHILE THE CHURCH IS BEING CONDITIONED BY REJECTING THE WORD OF THE LORD, THE BRIDE IS BEING CONDITIONED BY ACCEPTING IT. AND SO BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS IS THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH BUT NOT THE CONDITION OF THE BRIDE. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD PREACH A BRIDE AGE BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS CONDITIONED BY HAVING THE WORD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH. BUT THE BRIDE IS IN A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD BECAUSE SHE'S ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHEN NOT UPON THE WORD. KNOCK UPON YOUR HEART. JOHN 10:27 WOULD SAY THIS HERE. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I KNOW THEM AND THEY FOLLOW ME. AND SO THIS IS A SEPARATE THING THAN REVELATIONS 3. REVELATIONS 3 IS WHOSOEVER WILL I'M STANDING and knocking ON THE DOOR. BUT JOHN 10 SAYS MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE. THAT'S A CLAIMING OVER YOUR LIFE THAT IT'S NOT YOU MIGHT MISS IT OR OR YOU MIGHT ACCEPT IT, BUT THIS IS A CLAIMING THAT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED of God. the church goes through. That's the ones that says whosoever will let him come. BUT THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED OF GOD. AND SO JOHN 10, MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE. I BELIEVE THAT IS A CLAIMING OVER OUR LIVES. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S THREE THINGS in that verse that that really stood out to me. My sheep hear my voice and I know THEM AND THEY FOLLOW ME. SO THE VERY REASON THAT YOU HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE THE WORD IS BECAUSE YOU CAME FROM THE MIND OF GOD IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO WHEN THE WORD CAME ACROSS, CHRIST WASN'T I I HOPE THEY'RE going to accept it. I I HOPE THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE IT. BUT HE ALREADY KNEW YOU. MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE BECAUSE I KNOW THEM. SO THERE WAS AN ELECTED SEAT. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHENEVER THE 70 would leave Jesus and he would look at his disciples and would say, "Will you LEAVE ME ALSO?" I DON'T BELIEVE HE HAD A QUESTION THERE. I BELIEVE HE WAS QUESTIONING THEIR FAITH TO SEE WHERE THEY STOOD. HE KNEW WHAT PETER WAS SAYING. AND PETER WOULD SAY, "WHERE WOULD WE GO? FOR THOU HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE." HE WAS QUESTIONING HIS FAITH TO SEE WHERE HE STOOD. AND SOMETIMES OUR FAITH GETS QUESTIONED. BUT GOD DON'T HAVE A DOUBT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REFUSE IT. HE KNOWS YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU. HE PREDESTINATED YOU FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WHENEVER PETER WOULD SAY THOSE WORDS, WHERE WOULD WE GO? BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT IT WAS RIGHT RIGHT BEFORE THAT. Jesus is saying, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "PETER AND THE DISCIPLES DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT." HALLELUJAH. THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT. AND SINCE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, THEY DIDN'T TURN AWAY LIKE THE OTHERS, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THIS WAS THE WORD FOR THE HOUR. AND YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, BUT YET YOU BELIEVE IT. IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S AN ELECTED SEED ON THE INSIDE. WHERE WOULD I GO? FOR THOU HAST THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. WHERE WOULD I GO? THERE'S NO RAPTURE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE. THERE'S NO BODY CHANGE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE. AND THERE'S A SEED TO ACCEPT IT EVEN WHEN YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S ENCOURAGING AS A YOUNG PERSON BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, BUT YET THERE'S A HEART TO RECEIVE IT. THERE'S A HEART THAT SAYS, "AMEN. YES, I believe it." AND SO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SERPENT SEED DOES NOT HAVE. THEY DIDN'T COME FROM GOD AND THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK TO GOD. BUT YOU HAVE AND AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY HE'S an eagle. This is in the rising of the sun. He says he's an eagle to begin with. He recognizes the real EAGLE RECOGNIZES THE CALL OF GOD'S WORD. WHY? HE'S AN EAGLE. AN EAGLE TO AN EAGLE AND THE WORD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION. HE SAYS the word to the word. And so in other words, YOU'RE A PART OF GOD'S WORD. You're a predestinated SEED. AND WHEN THE WORD come across YOUR COME ACROSS YOUR PATH, IT WAS WORD RESPONDING UNTO WORD. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, "MY SHEEP hear my voice." And he would say, "They know my word. THEY SEE IT VINDICATED FOR THAT AGE." So in other words, when Jesus says, "My sheep will hear my voice." He's making a CLAIM THAT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VINDICATED WORD OR IT'S GOING TO HEAR MY MESSAGE. AND THERE'S MANY VOICES OUT THERE THAT CAN GET YOUR ATTENTION THAT WILL TRY TO CLAIM YOUR LIFE. BUT THERE'S ALREADY A CLAIM THAT IS ON YOUR LIFE THAT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE. NO MATTER THE OTHER VOICES, NO MATTER THE OTHER INFLUENCES, WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY ALMIGHTY GOD. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE JESUS WOULD WOULD WOULD SAY THAT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE a net, right? AND YOU THROW IT OUT INTO the ocean and and you're you're going after the fish, BUT YOU ATTRACT many things. And brother Brandham, HE HE WOULD SORT OF DRAMATIZE IT AND WOULD SAY WHEN YOU THROW OUT THE NET. He says there's water spiders get in there. HE SAYS THERE'S SERPENTS THAT GET IN THERE. AND HE SAYS THE FISH, THEY ALSO GET IN THERE. AND HE SAYS THAT THAT THE WATER SPIDER THAT IT STAYS in there for about 10 days, but then says I have to give up my pants. So it jumps out of the net. AND THEN THE SERPENT'S IN THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND SAYS, "I HAVE TO GIVE UP MY CLUBS." HE JUMPS OUT OF THE NET. HE SAYS, "THE NET HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT WAS ALREADY A WATER SPIDER BEFORE IT CAME INTO THE NET." SO, in other words, THE NET DID NOT MAKE A FISH A FISH. IT ATTRACTED EVERYTHING, BUT ONLY CLAIMED THE ONE IT WAS AFTER. AND THIS MESSAGE DID NOT MAKE YOU BRIDE. IT ATTRACTED MANY. REMEMBER THE THREE POOLS. THE FIRST PULL ATTRACTED SOME. THE SECOND ATTRACTED SOME. BUT THE THIRD PULL WAS ONLY AFTER THE RAINBOW TRAP. IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE ONE IT COME TO CLAIM. AND MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD THE MESSAGE AND LIKE THE SIGNS, like the wonders, LIKE THE ANOINTING, BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE THE WORD BECAUSE IT WASN'T AFTER THEM. IT WAS AFTER YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY MANY TURNED AWAY, BUT YOU'RE STILL SITTING HERE TODAY is because it come to claim your life. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THIS MESSAGE DID NOT MAKE YOU BRIDE. IT BROUGHT THE POTENTIALS THAT WAS ALREADY LAYING THERE. SO WE WOULD GO FROM POTENTIALLY BEING THE BRIDE TO MANIFESTING THE LIFE OF THE BRIDE. AND AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT the message has claimed our lives. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY IN MANY PLACES HE WOULD SAY, "FATHER, THEY are yours. THEY ARE TROPHIES of your word." He would say, "I claim them for you tonight, Jesus, as your PERSONAL TREASURE, AS GEMS in your crown." He would say in in one place, he says throughout the world, wherever this message may go, turn them loose. I CLAIM THEM. AND HE SAYS THIS IN MANY PLACES. AND HE WOULD SAY IN IN multiple places as well that the ones that are in here, I claim them. And the ones that will hear this message OR OR HEAR THIS TAPE, I claim them as well. SO IT IT TAKES AWAY WITH I WASN'T THERE, SO GOD AIN'T DEALING WITH ME. NO. IF YOU HAVE A HEART to receive the word, THERE'S A CLAIMING THAT IS TAKING PLACE. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD say in one place, HE SAYS, YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE WORD AND I claim them. AND HE SAYS, "AND SATAN CANNOT BE AROUND THEM no more. I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GOSPEL." SO IN OTHER WORDS, when God claims you, all of the CLAIMS THAT THE DEVIL HAS ON YOUR LIFE IS NOW BROKEN. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM JUST SAYING praying a prayer, I claim them. I claim them. I CLAIM THEM. BUT I believe it WAS A WORD OF AUTHORITY THAT WAS CLAIMING OUR LIVES AND AND WOULD CALL US MAYBE OUT OF A A DENOMINATIONAL SETTING, MAYBE BORN ON A CHURCH PEW, BUT WAS BOUND BY A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT. AND THAT RELIGIOUS SPIRIT WOULD HAVE A CLAIM ON YOUR LIFE. BUT ONCE THERE WAS A HEART TO RECEIVE, THEN YOU WOULD BE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER VOICE. AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN A BRIDE AGE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE'S A SEPARATION. THE BOOK OF THE BIBLE WOULD TELL us that in Exodus THAT THAT THAT WHENEVER THE DEATH ANGEL WAS COMING THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT, THE GOD WOULD SAY, "I WILL SEVER IN THAT DAY IN THE LAND of Egypt." He would S PUT A DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND THY PEOPLE. SO EVEN THOUGH THE CHILDREN of Israel WAS IN EGYPT, THEY WERE IN A PLACE CALLED GAN AND THEY WERE SET APART AND THERE WAS NO CLAIM THAT THE DEATH ANGEL HAD ON THEIR LIVES. AND WE MIGHT BE AND LAY ON A SEA, BUT WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED INTO A BRIDE AGE. I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE SAYING, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE NOT PARTAKERS OF HER SINS AND NOT OF HER PLAGUES." THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLAIMED BY ONE VOICE, BUT WHEN THE VOICE OF GOD CAME ACROSS YOUR PATH, IT WOULD SAY, "NO MORE CLAIMS FOR YOU, SATAN. YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A CLAIM ON HIM, BUT NOW I'M CLAIMING THEIR LIFE FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO BE A TROPHY OF GOD'S GRACE. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE IN THIS GENERATION. WHILE MARRIAGES ARE FALLING APART, YOU'RE A TROPHY OF WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAN DO. WHILE CHILDREN ARE OUT IN THE WORLD, YOUNG PEOPLE IS A TROPHY OF WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAN DO. HALLELUJAH. IT'S SHOWING THAT WHILE ALL OF THE WORLD MIGHT BE IN SMOKING AND DRINKING AND DRUGS AND PORNOGRAPHY, THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT IS A TROPHY OF WHAT GOD CAN DO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE GOD HAS A WITNESS UPON THE EARTH THAT IS SHINING THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? Because he HAS PUT A DIVISION between us and the world. There's a separation. And brother Brown say, "Didn't Jesus say in the last days, Matthew 24 and 24, these two that the the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated the elected ones if it was possible. Almost like the real thing. See, so in the last days now you see it's wheat time now. It's getting harvest time. This is not Luther's age. This is not Pentecostal age. He says THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. As Moses called a nation out of a nation, Christ today is calling a church out of a church. You see the same thing in type taking them to the glorious eternal promised land. And I believe THIS POSITION IS NOT SOMETHING TO COME, BUT I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER Brandon would say that when the death angel was coming through the land of Egypt, he says that the DEATH ANGEL COULD GO INTO ANYWHERE. It could go into the children of the ch the children of Israel's home. It could go into the palace. BUT HE SAYS THERE WAS ONE PLACE that it could not get into. And he says NOT A HOME BUT A PLACE. AND HE SAYS THAT'S WHERE the blood of the lamb was. AND HE SAYS SO IS IT TODAY. HE SAYS THERE'S ONE PLACE THAT THE DEATH ANGEL CAN'T GET INTO, and that's where the word of the LORD IS. IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T one location there IN EGYPT THAT ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD TO COME INTO. IT WASN'T ONE LOCATION, BUT IT WAS ONE PLACE. AND AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ALL IN THE SAME LOCATION. I LIVE IN OKLAHOMA. Y'ALL live in Missouri and Arkansas. Brother Josh IS IN ARIZONA. BUT YET WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME PLACE. WHAT IS THAT PLACE? IT'S A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. THERE'S BEEN A SEPARATION. WE'VE BEEN SEATED INTO HEAVENLY PLACES. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE WORD COMING AND CALLING THE ELECT, SAYING, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE A STRANGER. COME OUT OF HER AND BE AND BE PLACED INTO A A POSITION WITH ME AND ME ALONE." WELL, THERE'S MANY VOICES. YOU WILL ONLY HEAR MY VOICE. IT'S GOING TO BE MY LOVE SECRETS TO YOU. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOUR FUTURE IS. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW I CAN SAVE YOUR CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW I CAN KEEP YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN. IT'S A SECRET PLACE WITH YOU AND GOD ALONE. HALLELUJAH. THAT WHEN YOU MIGHT GET DISCOURAGED, YOU CAN SAY, "LORD, I NEED SOME ENCOURAGEMENT." MAYBE WHEN THINGS IS NOT GOING THE WAY YOU THINK IT SHOULD, YOU CAN SAY, "LORD, I I CAN'T DO IT, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE WALKING WITH ME. IT'S A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. AND THERE'S NO DEATH ANGEL THAT CAN GET INTO THERE." And we know what that death angel is. It's spiritual death. But yet, we're living in life because we've been separated for his name's sake. And so that the claim OF SPIRITUAL DEATH HAS BEEN BROKEN OFF of our lives. AND AND THE APOSTLE PAUL WOULD TELL US THAT the voice of the blood speaks better things than that of Abel because the the the voice of the BLOOD OF ABEL WOULD CRY OUT AGAINST CAIN, BUT THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST CRIES OUT for you. AND BECAUSE THE DEVIL WANTS TO TO MAKE THIS MESSAGE a voice of condemnation, a voice of dos and a voice of don'ts. BUT THIS MESSAGE IS NOT THE VOICE OF CONDEMNATION. THAT'S WHAT THE BLOOD OF ABEL WAS. IT WAS CONDEMNATION AGAINST CAIN. BUT THE BLOOD, the voice of THE BLOOD TODAY IS not a voice OF CONDEMNATION. BROTHER BRAND TELL US THE VOICE has the blood has a voice. AND THAT VOICE IS THE WORD of the Lord. AND SO WHAT IS THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD? IT IS THIS MESSAGE THAT IS NOT CONDEMNING YOU BUT IT'S BRINGING GRACE SAYING GRACE GRACE you can DO IT BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU WORTHY YOU CAN MAKE A RAPTURE IN YOUR OWN ABILITY BUT I'M GOING TO POUR OUT A GRACE THAT IS GOING TO SPEAK BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF LEODYSIA IT'S GOING TO SPEAK BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF LUKEWARMNESS AND AND LACKNESS AND FORMALISM THEY MIGHT HAVE VOICES AND CLAIMS BUT MY VOICE IS SPEAKING BETTER THINGS. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR THAT? THE VOICE OF THE RAPTURE IS SPEAKING BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF GRAVITY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN CLAIM OUR LIVES. AND YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR NO EVIL. HOW COME, BROTHER JOSH, I'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. I'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY ALMIGHTY GOD. SO THE VOICE OF THE blood speaks better things. AND IT'S A POWERFUL THING BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT MANY CLAIMS. Generational curses is a genuine CLAIM THAT CAN PASS FROM one generation to another. A TEMPER CAN PASS FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER. PORNOGRAPHY CAN PASS FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER. LYING CAN PASS from one generation to another. You remember whenever whenever Abraham would go to the land of Greer and would tell his wife, tell the king that YOU'RE MY SISTER. IF YOU LOOK, IT WAS THE next generation. It It was Isaac that would go into the land OF GREGER AND WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT ISRAEL. IT WAS A GENERATIONAL CURSE. BUT THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD, IT SPEAKS BETTER THINGS. MARITAL PROBLEMS CAN PASS FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER. CONDEMNATION CAN PASS. BUT YET, THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD IS CRYING FOR YOU, NOT AGAINST YOU, THAT YOU MIGHT BE IN A GENERATIONAL CURSE. BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A BRIDE UPON THE EARTH THAT CAN MAKE A STAND. MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE MAY HAVE ended in A DIVORCE, BUT THAT'S NOT MY FUTURE. MY BROTHER MAY HAVE WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD, BUT THAT'S NOT MY FUTURE. WHAT IS IT? THERE'S A CLAIM THAT IS SPEAKING BETTER THINGS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER VOICES. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR THAT THIS MORNING? That there is a claim over our lives that speaks better things than that of the enemy. And it's it's an incredible thing because THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US ABOUT about Rahab and how that her house was upon the walls of the city and how it WAS THAT CITY THAT WAS PRONOUNCED judgment upon him and those walls were going to come down and she should have been another statistic. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HER HER HOUSE WAS upon the walls of the city and here we're living IN THE MIDST OF LEGACY WHERE MARRIAGES are falling apart where where young people are backsliding and and this is happening that is happening AND WE SHOULD BE ANOTHER STATISTIC BUT WHAT WOULD SEPARATE THE RAHAB WAS WHEN SHE AND THE SPIES WOULD COME INTO THE LAND AND SHE WOULD START TO TALK WITH HIM and would say we heard how that your god split THE RED SEA WE HEARD WHAT your god God did to the kings. WE HEARD WHAT YOUR GOD DID. AND THEN SHE WOULD STOP AND WOULD SAY, "BUT GIVE ME A TRUE TOKEN THAT MY HOUSE COULD BE SAVED, THAT MY BRETHREN CAN BE SAVED, THAT MY SISTERS CAN BE SAVED, THAT MY THAT MY DAD CAN BE SAVED, THAT MY MOM COULD BE SAVED." IT WAS A TRUE TOKEN THAT WOULD SEPARATE HER. AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS SHE WOULD START TO CLAIM THINGS. SHE WASN'T JUST HAPPY WITH HERSELF HAVING A POWERFUL A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE WANTED HER WHOLE FAMILY HAVING A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE AND THAT SHOULD BE THE ATTITUDE OF EVERY PARENT IS LORD I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE SAVED BUT CLAIM MY CHILDREN HALLELUJAH AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE AUTHORITY OF THE BRIDE THAT YOU CAN CLAIM YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN PRAY AND PUT THE HEDGE OF PROTECTION AROUND THEM APPLY THE TOKEN BUT THE BRON WOULD SAY THAT HE WOULD SAY APPLY THE TOKEN AND PUT IT OVER YOUR PRAYERS. AND HE WOULD SAY, "CLAIM YOUR FAMILY." HE SAYS, "IF YOU'VE GOT AN UNSAVED CHILD," HE SAYS, "LAY THE TOKEN RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM AND SAY,"LORD GOD, I CLAIM THEM." STAY RIGHT THERE. IF YOU GOT A MOTHER OR a loved one that's lost, LAY THE TOKEN ON THEM AND SAY, "LORD GOD, I CLAIM THEM." WE'RE LIVING IN THE TIME WHERE WE'RE NOT BEGGARS, BUT WE ARE STANDING IN A PLACE OF MATURITY WHERE YOU CAN SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD. AND GOD BACKS THAT WORD UP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RAHAB SAYS, "NOT JUST ME, BUT I WANT MY FAMILY SAVED." &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE CLAIMED, BUT CLAIM my loved ones. And so, IT'S A CLAIMING POWER THAT SPEAKS BETTER THINGS than that of the enemy. And so, AND MY SHEEP always know my voice. and I know them. And the third part of that verse that I LOVE IS AND THEY FOLLOW ME. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S GOING TO BE ACTIONS BEHIND IT. IT'S MORE THAN a lip service, but it's something THAT IS GOING TO DRIVE YOU. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT IT. AND THAT'S THE HARDEST THING TO DO MANY TIMES IS ACCEPT WHAT GOD THINKS OF YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. ACCEPT THE WAY GOD THINKS OF SITUATIONS. You remember whenever Elijah was in the CAVE AND HE'S CRYING UNTO GOD AND HE WOULD SAY, "THEY'VE TORE DOWN YOUR ALTARS. THEY THEY KILLED ALL OF YOUR PROPHETS." AND WHAT WOULD GOD SAY? HE SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE STANDING. I'VE GOT 7,000 THAT HAVE NOT BOWED THEIR KNEE TO BAIL." AND MANY TIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT IT. OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. SOMETIMES YOU look at SITUATIONS AND SAY, "THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH IT." BUT YET GOD'S LOOKING AT HIM AND SAYS, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH IT? I'VE ALREADY MADE A WAY THROUGH IT." YOU REMEMBER IT WAS GIDEON THAT WHEN THE MESSAGE WOULD COME TO GIDEON AND WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR." IF YOU LOOK UP that word valor, it means wealthy. YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF WEALTH. AND AND WHAT WOULD GIDEON SAY TO THE ANGEL? HE SAYS, "MY FAMILY IS POOR AND I'M LEASHED IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE." HE WAS LOOKING AT HIMSELF DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD WAS LOOKING AT HIM. COME ON NOW. NOW, AND WE GOT TO GET OUR FOCUS IN LINE WITH THE word of the LORD AND SAY, "I ACCEPT IT. I CAN'T DO IT, BUT YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH ME. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. I CAN DO IT, BUT I'M believing you can do it." HALLELUJAH. MY SHEEP will hear my VOICE AND A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW. SO ONCE YOU BECOME A STRANGER TO THE WORLD, THEN the world becomes a stranger to you. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE word's a stranger to us because we're NOT A STRANGER TO THE WORLD. YOU SEE, YOU CAN'T BE A STRANGER TO BOTH. YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO BE A STRANGER to the world or a stranger to THE VOICE OF GOD. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A STRANGER TO THE TO THE WORD. I WANT TO KNOW THE WORD BECAUSE THE WORD ALREADY KNOWS ME. LET ME ACCEPT IT AND GET INTO IT. You know, you remember the story of the two walking to the road to Emmas. The Bible would tell us that that that they were discouraged. THEY WERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY THOUGHT CHRIST WAS the Messiah. Y'all remember the story AND HOW THAT THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT CHRIST HIMSELF would draw near unto them AND WOULD SAY, "WHAT COMM WHAT MANNER OF COMMUNICATIONS are these that ye are sad?" AND IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK HOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD, BUT yet they WERE SAD. &gt;&gt; OH MY. SOMETIMES CHURCH MEMBERS CAN GET THAT WAY. WE TALK ABOUT THE WORD. WE CAN QUOTE THE WORD. BUT YET WE'RE DISCOURAGED. WE'RE BEAT DOWN. YOU KNOW WHY? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YOURSELF IN THE BOOK YET. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT CHRIST WOULD REBUKE THEM. HE HE WOULD FIRST ASK THEM, "WHAT MAN WHAT MANNER OF communications are these THAT YE ARE SAD?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY TELL JESUS? THE VERY ONE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT COMES INTO THEIR MIDST. AND THEY WOULD SAY to him, "ARE YOU A STRANGER IN these parts?" HERE, THE ONE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT COME TO THEM. and yet he was a STRANGER TO HIM. OH, I DON'T WANT GOD TO COME AND TRYING TO ANSWER MY QUESTION AND YET HE'S A STRANGER TO ME. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS HE WOULD REBUKE THEM, OH FOOLS AND SLOW OF HEART TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SPOKEN OF ME. AND THE BIBLE WOULD SAY HE WOULD GO THROUGH THE BIBLE OR THE scrolls speaking of himself. And yet they would come about the evening time that he WAS GOING TO WALK BY THE HOUSE. AND WHAT WOULD THOSE TWO MEN DO? THEY WOULD STOP HIM AND WOULD SAY, "COME IN WITH US." Brother Brandham says right there THEY RECEIVED THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. THEY WOULD HE WOULD COME INTO THE HOUSE AND AS HE BROKE THE BREAD, THE BIBLE SAYS THEIR EYES CAME OPEN. AND WATCH HOW THEIR CONFESSION CHANGED. THEIR CONFESSION WENT FROM BEING DISCOURAGED, HOW THEY THOUGHT HE WAS THE WORD, HOW THEY THOUGHT HE was going to do it TO DID NOT OUR HEART BURN WITHIN US AS HE TALKED WITH US ALONG THE WAY. THEY WENT FROM TALKING ABOUT THE WORD TO THE WORD TALKING TO THEM BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED IT. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT CAN HAPPEN ON A SUNDAY MORNING. IT GO FROM A PREACHER JUST TALKING ABOUT IT TO THAT PREACHER SPEAKING A WORD THAT CAN SPEAK TO YOUR HEART BECAUSE YOU RECEIVED IT. AND IT CAN TAKE YOU FROM A GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE AND PLACE A FIRE ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR HEART THAT YOU CAN SAY, "GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD." I ONCE WAS DISCOURAGED, BUT NOW THERE'S A FIRE ON THE INSIDE OF MY HEART BECAUSE HE SPOKE TO ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEN THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US A FEW verses later THAT THESE TWO MEN WOULD GO BACK TO THE DISCIPLES AND WOULD TALK TO THEM about what Christ told them along the way. And the Bible says as they were talking about him, Christ appeared in the room and said, "Peace be unto you." AND I THOUGHT, OH MY, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH A BELIEVER. WHEN THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH GOD, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HIM AND THEN HE COMES IN THE MIDST OF YOUR SITUATION AND BRINGS A PEACE to him. HE CAN BRING A CALM TO THE SITUATION. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE THAT GOD STARTED TALKING TO them and they received it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then it was a claim over every situation they would go through. AND SO MY SHEEP WILL HEAR my voice. I know them and they follow me. You remember when brother Brandham was over in the Middle East and how that that there was a herd of sheep that was going through that going through the road and how they were at a four-way stop and it brother Brandham says the sheep are watching the shepherd and they WERE WALKING BUT THEN they would go into a through a market and brother Brandham would tell us their markets it's like our farmers market everything is on the outside and upon the pavement or upon their on their streets and brother Brandon would say to himself oh this is going to be crazy. HE SAYS ONCE THOSE SHEEP BEGIN TO SEE ALL OF THE FRUIT, ALL OF THE VEGETABLES, ALL OF THAT BREAD, HE SAYS THEY'RE not going to follow the shepherd no more. But he says AS HE WAS WATCHING, THOSE SHEEP never looked to the left or to the right, but they looked AT ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE SHEPHERD. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, I COULD HAVE STOPPED AND PREACHED A SERMON TO THOSE SHEEP RIGHT THEN. HE SAYS, "MY SHEEP WILL KNOW MY VOICE." AND SO THERE WAS MANY attractions out there that could have pulled their attention BUT YET THEY WERE FOLLOWING ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE SHEPHERD. AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT HE'S THE GOOD SHEPHERD. You remember brother Brown tell us that there's a difference between a between a herdsman and a shepherd. He says the HERDSMAN OR HIRELAND HE SAYS IS with the sheep during the day but at night time HE GOES INTO THE HOUSE. BUT HE SAYS A SHEPHERD is with the sheep during the day and AT NIGHT TIME HE BECOMES THE DOOR. HALLELUJAH. SO WE DON'T GOT A GOOD HERDSMAN OR A GOOD HIRELAND. WE GOT THE GOOD SHEPHERD THAT IS GOING TO BE WITH YOU IN THE GOOD TIMES. BUT ALSO IN THE BAD TIMES HE BECOMES THE DOOR. IT WAS JESUS THAT WOULD SAY I AM THE DOOR OF THE SHEEP AND NO MAN NO NOTHING CAN COME IN UNLESS THAT'S THROUGH ME. WHAT IS IT? HE'S NOT WITH YOU JUST IN THE GOOD TIMES, BUT IN THE BAD TIMES, THE ONLY WAY A TRIAL CAN GET TO YOU IS TO BE COMING THROUGH HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRAND, I'M GOING TELL US THAT GOD WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN JOB. It was Job THAT WOULD TELL SATAN, "HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB?" HE WAS STILL A GOOD SHEPHERD. EVEN WHEN JOB WAS ON THE ASH HEAP, HE WAS STILL A GOOD SHEPHERD. HE KNEW THAT JOB COULD LAST THE COURSE OF TIME. HE KNEW JOB MIGHT GO THROUGH HELL. HE MAY GO THROUGH MANY THINGS, BUT YET he was going TO STAND. AND SOMETIMES YOU GO through things and you don't feel like you can take another step. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT to lose your mind. You feel like your world HAS FALLEN APART. BUT YET, HE'S STILL THE GOOD SHEPHERD. CUZ BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE KNEW HOW MUCH HE COULD TRUST JOB. AND THEN HE STOPS AND HE SAYS, "AND HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE CAN TRUST YOU. HE'S STILL THE GOOD SHEPHERD. HE KNOWS YOU CAN MAKE IT. HE KNOWS YOU EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALL ALONE. IT WAS GOD THAT WAS SAID TO JOB, "WHERE WAS YOU, JOB, WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD, WHERE WAS YOU, JOB, WHEN THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY? YOU WAS IN MY MIND, AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOU FROM GOING BACK TO MY MIND." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS message is this message would show us our future. IT WOULD SHOW US THAT IT WOULD SHOW US HOW HOW THERE'S NOTHING PRESENT THAT CAN KEEP US DOWN. But it also took us back to the mind of God and would say you was in THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE HE WHEN HE WAS GOD ALONE, you was with HIM IN HIS THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S A COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT NO MATTER WHAT MY PRESENT condition is, I was already in THE MIND OF GOD AND HE KNOWS THE THOUGHTS THAT HE THINKS TOWARDS ME. HALLELUJAH. And so it's a it's an incredible thing what God has done for us in THIS GENERATION. IT'S ACCEPTING THE word of the Lord and following the word of the Lord. And and you can look at Moses. The Bible would say in Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. AND I THINK THAT'S POWERFUL BECAUSE IT WAS WHEN he had come of years or maturity that there would be a separation take place that he refused the identity of Pharaoh's DAUGHTER AND WOULD ACCEPT the identity of a stranger. And it's incredible because I believe THAT THE BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE as well. Well, we're not just some some some immature bride, but this word we've been ripening under. And brother Brandon would tell us that he was says tears already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who can turn the people from the word. But the wheat is the wheat also must mature and to her. NOT TO JUST ANYBODY BUT TO HER. GOD IS SENDING THE PROPHET MESSENGER WITH A VINDICATED MINISTRY THAT HE MIGHT BE ACCEPTED BY the elect. and they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride and the mighty works will be found in her. So I believe that THIS THAT THIS BRIDE HAS been maturing under the word of the hour and I believe she has come of age and you remember WHENEVER THE BIBLE WOULD tell us how how there was a blind man that Jesus would come and open his eyes. Y'all remember the story and that the Jews, the Bible says the Jews would go to his parents and would say, "Was this your son that was blind?" And they would say, "Yep, that's our son." Y'all remember that? And how that the Jews would ask the parents, "How did he receive HIS SIGHT? AND WHAT would the parents tell the Jews? ASK HIM. HE'S OF AGE. HE CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF. HE'S OF AGE. ASK HIM. HE SHALL SPEAK FOR HIMSELF." IN OTHER WORDS, HE WAS MATURE ENOUGH to speak FOR HIMSELF. AND THE BIBLE WOULD SAY that that the the that the Jews would come back to the man would would bring him to the synagogue and would say, "This man Jesus, HE'S A SINNER. HE'S THIS AND HE'S THAT." AND WHAT WOULD THE blind man say? HE WOULD SAY, "I HE'S A SINNER OR NO, I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE." THERE WAS AN AUTHORITY BEHIND HIM SPEAKING BECAUSE HE HAD EXPERIENCED IT. COME ON NOW. AND I BELIEVE THIS BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE WHERE SHE CAN SPEAK FOR HERSELF. SHE'S RECEIVED THE WORD. And brother Brandham says, "As you receive THE WORD, YOU BECOME THE WORD. YOU WILL BECOME THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL GENERATION UNDER HER MESSENGER." WHAT IS IT? YOU'VE BEEN MATURING UNDER RECEIVING THE WORD AND YOU'VE COME OF AGE. AND YOUR VOICE IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S VOICE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT JUST SOME PENTECOSTALS that are speaking for a car, speaking for this, SPEAKING FOR THAT. BUT WE'RE TAKING UP THE WORD OF THE LORD. YOU'RE JOHN. GO TAKE THE BOOK, EAT THE BOOK, PROPHESY AGAIN. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE PICKING UP THE WORD AS YOU'RE RECEIVING THE WORD. THAT WORD COMES ON YOUR LIPS &gt;&gt; AND YOU SPEAK THY WORD AND IT'S A CREATIVE WORD THAT CAN CHANGE SITUATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WORD CAN STILL BREAK THE THE BINDS OF OF PRODICAL SONS AND BRING THEM BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF THE LORD CAN STILL BREAK DEPRESSION OVER PEOPLE'S LIVES. HE CAN STILL BREAK ANXIETY OVER PEOPLE'S LIVES. IT'S a word THAT CAN CLAIM &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE WORD IS NOW ON your lips. I say YOU SPEAK THE WORD. &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK THE CREATIVE WORD AND AND IT'S AS GOOD as God speaking. And brother Brandham must tell us that it's as good as deity speaking when you speak the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT A PENTECOSTAL IDEA, A PROSPERITY GOSPEL THERE THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN SEPARATED from the Pentecostals. You brother Joel, I was told the other day that the that the bride ain't adopted yet because the Pentecostals haven't separated yet. I said, I I believe we're I'm adopted. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I'M I'M PLACED IN AUTHORITY. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT is the adoption? It's it's that you it's in your position. It's God placing you where you're a manifested son. He would say that the voice that the that God would bring his voice to the bride and he would say THAT THE BRIDE ACCEPTS IT. SHE DON'T REFUSE IT. SHE DON'T DOUBT IT. SHE ACCEPTS IT AND HE KNOW OR SHE KNOWS what he wants done with the word. See, THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS DONE with this word. We're not just running around speaking things, but under the inspiration of the word, we can take the word AND SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD AND HAVE A CONFIDENCE. Brother Brandon would say when you speak the word or when you pray, what's your motive and objective? Right? He says if you want healing, what are you going to do with your healing? You see, BUT THE BRIDE KNOWS WHAT GOD WANTS done with the word AND OUR AMBITION IS HIS AMBITION. Our motives is his motives. OR OBJECTIVES IS HIS OBJECTIVES AND GOD KNOWS THAT ONCE YOU RECEIVE the word we come in line with what HE WANTS DONE &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because brother Brandham he would tell us that he says there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church he says oh my what the anointed man now the ANOINTED PEOPLE OH MY TO BRING BACK THE ANOINTED ED BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM ANOINTED by what? Accepting what Eve TURNED DOWN. YOU SEE THE POWER OF ACCEPTING. WHEN YOU ACCEPT WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? EVE TURNED DOWN. Then there's a union &gt;&gt; that begins to take place. And brother Brandham would tell us this is the uniting time. He says what's the bride uniting herself up with the word which is the bridegroom. AND SO HERE WE ARE. WE'RE living in the uniting time where whether the World Council of Churches is uniting with the Roman Catholic Church, but yet the bride is uniting with something else, which is the word of the hour. And I believe that we're living in the time of adoption. Do you believe that this morning? That we're living in the hour of manifested son. We're living in the TIME WHERE WHERE GOD IS PLACING his loved ones or his children in their inheritance. That that that that you can speak the word. And and brother Brandham, HE WOULD TELL us that THAT WHENEVER THE SON was to be adopted and and placed, he says THAT SON WOULD BE ADOPTED into the same family that he is born into. That's why with the brand of Matelis that our adoption is not our new birth, right? We were placed where we're born into a family, but one spirit were baptized INTO ONE BODY, BUT THEN it's going to take something to place us into our inheritance. And brother Brown was saved. Then if that child was obedient, there's a set there then there's a set A CERTAIN DAY WHEN HE BECOMES of age. NOW THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH OUGHT TO BE OF age 40 years or BETTER ABOUT 50. SO IT SHOULD be of age. SO HE'S SAYING THAT THAT THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH THEY THEY'VE come up to the HOLY GHOST BUT HE SAYS THEY haven't come up to age yet where they can be placed. He was saying in one place that the Pentecostals did the same thing as the other churches. they would denominate. But then he says out of them GOD WOULD CALL HIS SONS THAT ARE STANDING FOR THE WORD. SO WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTALS, WE'RE THE BRIDE. WE'RE NOT STUMBLING AROUND IN a Pentecostal church age, but we've been placed into a bride age AND PLACED INTO OUR INHERITANCE WHERE YOU NAME IS AS GOOD AS PAPA GOD'S. AND THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US THAT WHENEVER THE SON WOULD BE ADOPTED, his name is as GOOD ON THAT CHECK AS PAPA IS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS. Your name is AS GOOD AS GOD'S HIMSELF. THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK THE WORD, YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS DONE WITH THE WORD AND YOU DO IT. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US YOU DO IT IN HIS NAME. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER Brandham would tell us that in the beginning God was alone. But he says, "But in Genesis 2, he was no longer the self-existent one, BUT NOW HE'S JEHOVAH." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT'S that mean? HE'S NOT SELF-EXISTENT no more, BUT NOW HE'S EXISTING WITH A FAMILY." HALLELUJAH. SO HE'S NOT GOD ALONE ANYMORE, BUT NOW HE'S GOD IN A FAMILY. HE'S GOD IN A YOUNG PERSON. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE COME TO DO. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. WHERE WHERE'S HE BEING REVEALED AT? THROUGH CHRIST. NOW IN THE BRIDE. NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN. WHAT is it? THIS MESSAGE COME TO PULL OUT THE POTENTIALS THAT WERE LAYING ON THE INSIDE THAT YOU WERE RELENTED FOR THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I PREDESTINATED THE BODY UPON THE EARTH and you ARE THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT THOUGHT THAT I HAD IN MY MIND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This message IS A POWERFUL MESSAGE. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN THIS GENERATION THAT WE CAN FEED UPON THE WORD, THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN? AND AS WE FEED ON THE WORD, WE START TO SEE OUREL IN A DIFFERENT WAY. You remember the boy that never seen himself before? Never seen a mirror before. Y'all remember that story? Brother Brandon MATTAIL HAD NEVER SEEN HIMSELF BEFORE. SO HE WOULD GO to his aunt's house, I believe, and he would see a mirror, right? AND HE WOULD WAVE. THE BOY WOULD WAVE. HE WOULD JUMP. THE BOY WOULD JUMP. AND HE WAS EXCITED CUZ THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY. BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THAT MIRROR, THE TOMB BECAME ONE. HALLELUJAH. AND A REVELATION STRUCK THAT BOY'S HEART. MAMA, THAT BOY IS ME. AND THAT'S THE REVELATION THAT THIS BRIDE IS GETTING. IT AIN'T YOU AND THE BRIDE. BUT THE CLOSER YOU GET INTO THIS WORD, YOU SAY, "MAMA, THAT IS ME." THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHEN YOUR PASTOR'S PREACHING AND YOU SAY, "AMEN." YOU'RE SAYING, "PREACHER, THAT'S ME." IT'S NOT THE BRIDE AND YOU. BUT YOU'RE SAYING, "I AM THE BRIDE." IT'S NOT A RAPTURING GENERATION AND YOU. TWO SEPARATE THINGS, BUT YOU ARE THE FULFILLMENT OF IT. SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES, FOR THEM TESTIFY OF WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE TWO HAVE BECOME ONE. HALLELUJAH. I and my father are one. And I believe the bride and the bridegroom have has come together and they become one. I believe you've become the word. Hallelujah. You believe that this morning that you have become the word. So, brother Brandon would say, here's the secret. The word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name. She has thus saith the Lord. And and SO WHAT'S SO SO significant about his name? Why why do we have to take on his name? And and I and I won't be much longer because brother Brown would teach us that your name characterizes who you are. Right? He would say that if your son is named Ricky or Elvis, what would he say? Change the name. because it characterizes who they are. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT JACOB WOULD BE CHANGED to Israel, Simon to Peter, and Saul to Paul. And what would brother Brandham tell us at the opening of the seals? He would say, "I'm not GOING TO CALL YOU CHURCH." RIGHT? BUT WHAT WOULD HE SAY? I'M GOING TO CALL YOU BRIDE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE not going to have the life of a church member, but now you're going to have the life OF CHRIST HIMSELF. Because that name becomes a characteristic. The Bible would tell us in the in in the book of Acts 15-14, Simeon hath declared how God the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name. And brother Brand tell us thus concerning this day that God is calling a people for his name. And and if you look at the word name in in the Strong's concordance, it means reputation, fame, or glory. So in other words, God's calling a people for his reputation, for his glory. Brother Brandon would tell us that that God will always have a witness upon the earth, right? That the that the that the David was a witness, that the the patriarchs were witnesses, but now God has a witness upon the earth for his name's sake. And so the reputation of the Lord, I don't believe, is just FLOATING AROUND, BUT WE'RE living out the life. WE'RE LIVING OUT THE GLORY. That's what the Bible would say. RISE AND SHINE FOR THY LIGHT HAS COME. THE GLORY OF THE LORD has risen UPON THEE AND SHALL BE SEEN UPON THEE. YOU REMEMBER HOW ZAKIUS THE BIBLE SAYS HE SOUGHT TO SEE WHO JESUS WAS. He sought to see Jesus who he was. So he didn't want to JUST SEE THE BODY OF JESUS. HE WANTED to see who Jesus was. HE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THAT REPUTATION. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT THAT JESUS would come to Zakius's house. Right? Y'all still with me this morning? how that the that Jesus comes to Zakius's HOUSE AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT JESUS would leave Zakius's HOUSE, BUT THE GLORY OF the Lord WOULD REMAIN BECAUSE SOMETHING WOULD CHANGE IN ZAKIUS'S LIFE. THE BIBLE WOULD TELL us that he would do all the people that he done wrong to, he would go and make it right. SO, THE BODY DIDN'T DO IT. THE GLORY OF THE LORD DONE IT. AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CORPORAL BODY OF JESUS CHRIST HERE TODAY, BUT HIS GLORY, HIS REPUTATION HAS COME UPON US. AND JUST LIKE ZAKIUS, WE'RE BEING CHANGED BY DAY BY DAY. WHEN WE GET UP IN the morning AND WE FEED UPON THE WORD, IT'S CHANGING US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S GOT TO BE CHANGES TAKE PLACE. You remember whenever Lazarus when Jesus would say Lazarus come forth, he had life in his body. HE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE. THE VOICE of the resurrection brought him to life. But he came out of the tomb and was still in grave clothes. So even THOUGH HE WAS ALIVE, HE HAD TO GIVE UP SOME THINGS. HALLELUJAH. And even though WE'RE ALIVE, WE STILL HAVE TO GIVE UP some things. AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD MAKE HIM GIVE UP those things? IT WAS THE SAME VOICE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SAY, "LAZARUS, COME FORTH WAS THAT SAME VOICE THAT WOULD COMMISSION A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY." JESUS WOULD SAY loose him and let him go. So Jesus wasn't loosening him, BUT HE WAS COMMISSIONING A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY TO LOOSEN HIM. AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME YOUR PASTOR IS GETTING up and preaches AND AND THESE OTHER MINISTERS GETS UP AND PREACHES. YOU ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT TO LIFE, BUT THAT VOICE, THAT WORD IS UNWRAPPING YOU FROM those grave clothes THAT WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKE HIM. GOD WANTS TO SEEK HIS REFLECTION. WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU, HE WANTS TO SEEK HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. BUT THE PREACHING OF THE WORD IS PERFECTING THE SAINTS. AND EVERY TIME GOD LOOKS AT YOU, HE SEES HIMSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORD, YOU SEE YOURSELF. WHAT IS IT? THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM HAS COME TOGETHER AND HAS UNITED. HALLELUJAH. The glory of the Lord has risen upon us. And it's at the proclaiming of THE NAME. WE'RE WE'RE taking on his name. And the Bible would tell us in Exodus 33:18 and he SAID,"I BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME thy glory." And he said, "I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I WILL BE GRACIOUS AND WILL SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW MERCY." IN OTHER WORDS, the grace of the Lord and the mercy of the Lord was going to be poured out at the proclaiming of that name. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would would tell us, he would bring it down to our day and would say, "What is the manifestation of the name of God?" What would he say? The word being interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So when HIS WORD WAS INTERPRETED, THAT WAS THE PROCLAIMING OF THE NAME OF THE LORD THAT YOU COULD HAVE GRACE AND MERCY IN THIS GENERATION. Cuz you remember whenever whenever the the the the death angel was coming through the kingdom of of the Egyptians, could you imagine being Pharaoh thinking, man, how am I how can I stop this from taking over all the firstborn? Could you imagine maybe he would he would start to think but yet there was something so simple among them that could save them but they had no revelation of it. Brother Brandham would tell us now the Bible would tell us too that that you would take the hishup dip it in the blood right Brandon would say THAT HISSUP WAS A COMMON WEED in Palestine. So while the death angel was going through the land of Egypt, THERE WAS SOMETHING COMMON THAT COULD KEEP THAT FROM THEM, but it was not the the the grace of THE LORD WAS NOT GIVEN TO THE EGYPTIANS. But yet over in GOAN BY THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS NAME, THERE WAS A GRACE THAT WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT CAN SEPARATE YOU FROM THE JUDGMENTS THAT IS COMING ON THE LAND. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US WHAT WHAT IS HIP? IT'S A TYPE OF YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHILE THE WORLD IS FALLING APART, MARRIAGES ARE FALLING APART, WHILE PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR MIND, THE GRACE of the Lord HAS BEEN POURED OUT UPON YOU AND HAS RESTORED A FAITH AND FAITH IN THE WORD OF THE LORD IS SAYING, "COME UP HIGHER." AND AS YOU'RE RECEIVING IT, IT'S SEPARATING YOU FROM THE PLAGUES that is coming UPON THE LAND. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? BY THE PROCLAIMING OF MY NAME, I WILL BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS. I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO WHOM I WILL be merciful. HALLELUJAH. IT'S only the elected that has seen it. But at the proclaiming of his name, the brand was saying and the name is in the word because he is the word. Amen. What is he then? The word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So at the proclaiming of his word or or the proclaiming of his name, I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. &gt;&gt; What is it? You may BE A STRANGER, BUT YOU'RE an elected stranger. &gt;&gt; Ain't that a powerful thing? But we can take on his name. &gt;&gt; It's incredible cuz brother Brown tell us that through the Old Testament, God had many titles. He was rose of Sharon, lily of the valley, THE BRIDE AND MORNING STAR. BUT WHEN CHRIST WOULD COME, he didn't say, "I'm the title of God." What would he say? I come in my father's name. So he came in the manifestation or the interpretation of the word. And with that name came authority. That's why the apostle Paul would say whatever you do in word or in deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ. I believe we've taken on the name. Brother Brandon would teach us now that Abraham and I'm trying to bring this to a close. Give me a few more minutes. Brother Brandham teach us that Abraham had four steps of his journey. Right? He would say that justification was whenever God would call him out. And he says sanctification was whenever the the confirming of the covenant. Y'all remember that where where Abraham would get the different animals and would separate them. He says that was the second phase of his journey and that was sanctification which was Wesley. And he says then El Shadi was the baptism of the Holy Ghost which he says was Pentecost. But he says but then his name was changed WHICH IS THE FOUR STEPS OF THE JOURNEY. HE SAYS HIS NAME WAS CHANGED from Abram to Abraham. AND WHAT WAS THAT? Brother Brham would tell us THAT IT WAS ELOHIM, RIGHT? ELOHIM, the last part of Elohim was coming to humanity. So it was a it WAS A COMING TOGETHER OF HUMANITY and Elohim, WHICH WOULD CHANGE HIS NAME, WHICH WOULD PUT him in a position to fulfill the promise. And brother Brown was saying THAT WAS HIS ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH. We He didn't just justify us in this generation. HE DIDN'T JUST SANCTIFY US. HE didn't just fill you with the Holy Ghost. But he gave you his name that YOU CAN BE ADOPTED INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD THAT YOU ARE IN POSITION for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're in position for the supernatural. You believe that this morning? Brother Brown would say this here. God took Abraham out and placed the adoption upon him and changed his name from Abram to Abraham. Abraham comes from the word of Elohim, God's own name. He's he's he's associated his name with God's name. God is Elohim. How many knows that the great Jehovah Elohim, THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE, THE SELF-EXISTENT ONE, he says, Elohim. &gt;&gt; And so when he changed his name, he didn't change it to make it sound better. He changed him so he can be conditioned to see the promised child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he didn't change your name just to make it sound better, but he changed it so you can be conditioned for the promised tri. So we're conditioned for a rapture. We're conditioned for a body change. We're conditioned for the greater works. The greater works wasn't WITH BROTHER BRANDON. YOU ARE THE GREATER WORKS. WE'RE CONDITIONED for it. And when we speak the word, it's God speaking through us. Let our musicians come this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for that? That God is speaking through a vessel. Once again, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham would say this here. Now your old book is gone with your old union. Now your name and your old, he says, has been transferred. Now you say, do you do you mean to tell me that my old book God put in the sea of his forgetfulness? He says, you stand perfectly before God. He says, now your name is, he says, now your name is now in the new book, not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. What the book redeems. Now, the old book of your natural union, he says, but but your new bride, he says, hallelujah, your new life is in the lamb's book of life. And he says this here, your marriage certificate. So, how do you know that your name has been changed when a union take place? Right? My wife ain't called Loretta Mass no more. It's Loretta Martin. Her name is my name. Right? So, how do you know that your name is God's name? He says, "This message is your marriage certificate. If you can accept it and receive it and act it out, my sheep know my voice. I know them and they follow me. This is your marriage certificate. I say don't be discouraged this morning. Don't listen to the lies that the devil tells you that you're a nobody. That you'll never amount to anything. Come on now. That you can never see the promises of God fulfilled. That's a lie. Look at THIS MESSAGE. IT'S YOUR MARRIAGE certificate that proves to THE DEVIL THAT HE HAS an end and you have a future. He's going to be burning in the lake of fire, but yet you're going to be reigning. It's going to be you that's going to march over the ashes of the wicked. I say don't get weary and welloing. But keep on fighting. Keep on walking. This ain't the time to give up and give in and say I can't do it no more. But God has given you his name. I say you're in a place of authority. Act like it. Hold your head up high and say, "Satan, greater is he that is in me. I ain't listening to your lies any longer. I AIN'T LISTENING TO IT no longer. But I want to get into the word for myself and see who I am. It's who I am. It's who YOU ARE. YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. YOU are the rapture. Brother Brand say that the rapture is within you now. THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE THE manifestation a manifested son and daughter of God. You believe that this morning? Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, how we love you this morning. We're thankful for your mercies and your grace. Lord, thank you for proclaiming your name, proclaiming your word over us and would claim our lives. Father, would give us an ambition, Lord. Give us a future, Lord. If there's some here that might be weary, I ask that you would strengthen them, Lord. If there's some here that might not see them themselves in in this word yet, Lord, give them eyes to see. Lord, put some eyes out on them that they may see. Lord, if there's some here that is weary in faith, Lord, strengthen that faith. Like the man that would come to Jesus and would say, "I believe, but help my unbelief." Lord, sometimes we just get weary, but Lord, where your spirit is, there's strength. Father, I ask that you would uplift the feeble hands. Lord, we love you and we're thankful for your mercies and your grace in Jesus name. Amen. I gra this this morning. I know that he took my place so that I through his love could take his beame so that I might become him by singing us this morning. I know that he became me so that I might become him by grace. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Aren't you glad that he he took my place so that I through his love could take his. I know that he became me so that I might become him. Oh, sing it one more time with all your hearts now. Oh, I know that he became me so that I might become him by grace. Yes, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Aren't you glad he did this? Oh, he he took my place so that I through his love could take his. I know that he became me. become him by grace. Amen. How many enjoyed the word of the Lord this morning? Go ahead and give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen. Brother Robert, would you pull up? Why didn't we recognize? Why didn't we recognize? Let's sing this together now. Amen. When he was walking and talking along with him, I love what brother Josh said. Amen. The word was, "Who are you? Who's this man?" And then when the word was spoke, I tell you what, just like that little eagle, thought it was an eagle. I thought it was a chicken the whole time. And then when the eagles went flew over the coupe and when it heard the voice of the eagle, amen, it knew then who it was. We're being placed by the message of the hour. Aren't you glad you know who you are now? Amen. You can say, "Well, I used to be." Well, you might have been in a chicken pin, but you always were a son or daughter of God. Aren't you thankful for today? Somebody give God some more praise here in the building this morning. Oh, why didn't we recognize the son of God was here today? Oh, and in our hearts over as he talked along the way. Oh, shouldn't we have no should we have known him? I wish that we had known him before the Lord had come and gone. The day be before yesterday they crucified my Lord, beat him un mercifully and nailed him to a tree. Oh, the sky grew dark and the earth began to fall. Oh yes, the people cried. Surely we've crucified the son of God. Oh, I dream we recognize the son of God was here today. Oh, and in our hearts burn as he talked along the way. Oh, shouldn't we have known? Shouldn't we have known here? I wish that we had known him before the Lord had come and gone. Today a friend and I walk down that road. We didn't know our Lord had arose. Oh, but then a man drew near and he spoke words so wise. He broke the bread and blessed it. He vanished and opened up our eyes. I like this part. It's for us here. Well, I'm so glad that I recognized the mighty God is here today. Oh, and does it our hearts? Oh, they burn as we talk along the way. Aren't you glad this morning? Well, I'm so glad I know him. Yes. I'm so glad I know him. Oh, I'm so glad I know him. For soon he'll come and be gone. Sing it again now. Well, I'm so glad that I recognized the mighty God is here today. And as our hearts burn as we talk along the way. Well, I'm so glad. How many knows he's here this morning? Well, oh, I'm so glad I know him. Oh, I'm so glad I know him. For soon he'll come and be gone. How many knows him to be real here this morning? And all I want to do is love him. Well, I'm so glad I was his love for me. For Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. Can you praise him now? Oh, so every day my heart is going to praise him. Oh, I know I'll ever be the same. And all I want to do is love him. Love is holy. Sing it one more time before we go. Now we're singing, "All I want to do is love him. I'm so glad I feel his love for me." And Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. Oh, so every day my heart is going to praise him. Oh, I know I'll never be the same. And all I want to do is love him. Love his holy name. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise. Amen. We're going to sing as we go. We shall be changed. We shall be changed. We're going to sing that. Amen. Don't you enjoy the word this morning. Didn't you enjoy that? And we sure love our brother Josh and we appreciate him for coming by. And Amen. looking forward to brother Josh C this evening. It's brother Josh prayer. Another brother Josh will be preaching for us this evening. Amen. Come under expectation. I believe the Lord will help us again. Amen. Just as you go now. Oh, we shall be changed. I know that we shall be changed. Oh, changed from this mortal to immortality in the twinkling of an eye. I know that we shall be changed. Oh yes, we shall be changed. Oh, changed from this mortal to immortality. Oh, in the twinkling of an eye, I know that we shall be changed. Heat. Heat. Heat.
