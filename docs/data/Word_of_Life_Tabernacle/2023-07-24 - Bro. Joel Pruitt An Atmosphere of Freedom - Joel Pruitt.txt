Christ oh we've been made foreign [Music] and we've been made notorious through the blood of Jesus Christ with our heads together how many has a need on their heart this evening I'd like to make it known by not put your hand we can just join together and pray together and just ask the Lord to enter in and move among us this evening heavenly father as we come together we want ourselves out of the way Lord we don't want anything that would hinder us to hinder your spirit from coming Among Us I ask that you would come now the Lord and just move upon the people move me out of the way so that I wouldn't say anything that would hurt anyone or be harmful to the people that are sitting here but Lord may I say something may you use me to say something that would would Bless the people of God or to be an encouragement to him Lord help them Lord not to see me but Lord look to the word of God tonight may we just all go away from here saying it was good to be in the house of the Lord I pray Lord that you would just come in such a way and your presence would move Among Us Lord that we wouldn't be Lord the same people that we came but Lord we could go away some Lord saying we were higher into your word and would come up higher into into your spirit Lord and maybe if there would be one here that needs a re-baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight I pray Lord this would be the service where we could just yield ourselves and and move on higher into you and Lord just Lord just be more than conquerors to this world that's trying to overtake us I pray we just move upon us now Lord help me to only say what you'd have me say I ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening man it's good to good to be here I I think I over ate a little bit and hey I was eating over there and I told told somebody I said The more I eat the shorter I'm going to preach and they said well hey go get another plate well I'll try not to hold you long but where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and we want to take our Liberty and just have church here tonight is that okay amen if you have your Bibles turn to Galatians chapter 5 and verse one we'll just read one verse and then you'll be able to be seated Galatians 5 and 1. Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage may the Lord add His blessings you may be seated I want to draw your attention there to stand fast in the Liberty where Christ hath made us free we're not free because we feel free we're free because we serve a God who has made us free we are under the blood which has made us free and we're thankful for that and now we live in an age that's good thank you buddy in this age Satan wants to keep us from the presence of God how many knows that he will do everything he can to keep you from the house of God he will do everything he can to keep you from the presence of God because he knows that if you ever get into the presence of God then something will take place now you may not immediately accept God and what he has for you but you'll never be able to forget the presence that you experienced and so he wants to bind us by something now remember Satan is always wanting to bind to the people but that is not what God wants us to do God has not given us a spirit of fear he doesn't bind us by fear God has not given us a a a a an authority by a man to stand up here and say well you've got to do this at a certain time and you can you can come and do this and you know the way you worship it's not under order by a man that would run the church but it is under order by God how God is running the church and God has given us the ability to have freedom in worship how many believes that tonight but Satan knows that if you're ever in the presence of God that you lose the fear and the chains that he is holding you by and so he wants to bind You by something and so what he's done is he has given us distractions today to bind the people he will give you a distraction maybe if it's Sports they're in the football season and if your favorite team loses and and they lose to a team that you really don't like Satan will come on the scene and he'll give you a bad attitude or or something that'll that'll make you feel bad you'll carry that over into church if you're not careful because really that has no has no authority over your life or it shouldn't but what we do is we give that that a spot in our life we give what we we give the devil a place to come in and make us miserable Christians but what we should do is lay that aside lay aside every weight that would so easily beset us but press forward into the liberty of Christ how many believes that tonight we don't need to be bound by the things of the world I'm not saying you shouldn't watch sports I'm not saying you shouldn't do whatever in in the world and go to amusement parks where I'm not saying all that what I'm saying is don't let those things bind you and keep you from experiencing the presence of God because I believe that when you're in his presence things can happen God can heal you in his presence there is salvation in his presence and I'm just crazy enough to believe that if I bring my children to church and let them sit in the presence of God then God can change their life just like he did mine because if you stay home you can't be as good of a Christian if you go out here and you run run around you go to you can go to Every rodeo in the country you can go to Every ball game in the country and those are good things but if you forsake the assembling of yourselves on the house of God God is not ever going to move on those young people's lives but if you'll bring them here where the presence of God is and the word is being and preach then something can take hold of them and they can grab a hold of that brother I think it's time that freedom has come back to the house of God how many believes that we don't need to be bound by by chains of bondage any longer we don't want to be bound by the by the world any longer but we need to be free through Christ who has made us free take your Liberty tonight and feel free because we have a freedom to worship when we come to this country our ancestors come to the come to this country our forefathers they come over here because they wanted freedom to worship and now for some reason we are cycling right back around to trying to be back in bondage with our worship again well I'll tell you if God has made you free and you are covered by the blood then nobody can shut you up from worshiping God in the way that's called crazy that's how we're going to worship you see well I don't like them people standing up and screaming and shouting in church well if you ever got free like they got free then you probably couldn't stop screaming yourself but brother what we need tonight is somebody who will just move out of the way and say you know what it don't matter what I like no more it don't matter what what the devil has tried to tell me I'm going to move myself out of the way my flesh is not going to hinder this service I'm going to sit back and say Lord let me act crazy just like the rest of them we don't need to be sitting in the seat of the scornful a friend of mine said he said if you're sitting in the seat of the scornful it's time to change seats I think that's what we ought to do we sit there and we condemn the people who are getting a little excited well brother I think once you ever realize what victory is to the believer you can't help but get excited I believe there's presence in the presence of God there's Freedom do you believe that's in hype brother Graham talks about being in the pawn shop how many knows the story he said he said if you watch the punch you put your watch in a pawn shop if I can talk that'd be great he said and if you paid on the pawn Bill and and and the man gave you receipt and and said here it's paid off he said you've got a right to go down and not pay for the watch again but you've got a right to go show the receipt and go take your watch now if you've already been baptized you've already received the Holy Ghost and you take that receipt and you come to the house of God devil look you can't steal my joy because the joy is mine you can't steal my family because I've already paid for it that's what we need to do tonight we don't need to be sitting over here saying well I don't have the money to go pay for my watch I don't have the money to get it out of the pawn shop no we've already got it because we paid for it wow it wasn't us but Christ paid for it and he and he went ahead and paid for every one of your watches while he was at it he went ahead and paid for your life he went ahead and paid for your life and he said you know what he said you walk right in and take it the blessings are yours everything you have need of is yours tonight we don't have to wait for it to come we don't have to pay for it again because it's already been paid it's already yours every promise is already yours because the blood's already covered and under the blood you can worship in the way that's called heresy under the blood you can worship God will accept that worship I don't care if it sounds crazy I don't care if it looks crazy if you're under the blood just worship God just worship brother Graham said the devil put us in the pawn shop back there from Adam's sin but Jesus came down and paid the pawn Bill and he wrote it out on the word he said I gotta write for it Satan get back I got a right for it how many can say that tonight I gotta write for my family I've got a right to go down there this may be a miserable age to live in but I've got a right to be happy in it I've got a right to overcome laodicea why because I've got a ticket and I'm going all the way I've got a ticket called the Holy Ghost and you can't stop me you can't shut me up because I know what it's like to set in a dead and cold church but I'm not going to go back there no more I'm going to sit here until the Lord comes and I want to preach to you saying take your Liberty in Christ because he has made you free we need less preachers trying to tell you how to sit down and shut up and more I'm telling you take your Liberty get your children in here and let them experience the atmosphere that you got born in we're freed by Christ the word and now remember brother Branham goes in and he talks about Washed by the Water of the word and he says that that is actually the Greek word means Toulouse when you're Washed by the word he said that Greek in the Greek he said that means to loose he said he loosed us we were tied to the Earth by our sin we couldn't see couldn't hear had no conception of Heaven Or Nothing But when the blood came down it cut the line and we got loosed so you're free tonight you're no more in bondage but you are free through Christ because the blood cut the line I'm thankful for that tonight Revelations 1 and verse 5 and you'll you'll see where it's in the Bible here and this is biblical stuff we're not just making this up we're saying well brother Branham said it and it's thus saith the Lord no we're actually taking a Bible principle and a prophet would come and shed light on it and then then I can preach it to you and you can receive it as so and the word will become so real to you that it will make you live the word Revelations 1 5 Jesus Christ was the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God we're no longer Sinners we're no longer just just children but we are Kings and Priests unto God I hope you hear me tonight I wish I had a little wish I hadn't ate so much brother Harvey maybe I preach a little bit and brother Branham talks about the washing of the word and when he uses that word to loose I want you to understand something that was for you the washing of the water of the world when it comes upon you when you're Washed by the word many times I wonder if we sit there and and we think well that was a little rough on us this morning or or he was getting after me he stepped on my toes but if you let the word wash you it will actually release you from those things it will make you free in Christ we were Earthbound creatures but now we are to soar like eagles because the blood has covered us there is no more condemnation to us because we're not walking after the Flesh and after the things of the Earth but we are walking after the spirit brother man tells the story about the old crow you still with me this afternoon he tells a story about the old crow and he said these other crows was flying over this field and and they looked down there and they saw Johnny Crow and he was tied up and uh he said come on Johnny Crow let's go south and Winter's coming and oh he got support he couldn't hardly walk he was tied up out there because the farmer had tied him to scare the other crows away well if you come down here you're going to get tied up I guess was his understanding or thinking and so this other guy come along brother Bram calls him the good man and the good man comes along and he cuts that cord to the crow and the crow was free but you know what the problem was he didn't recognize his freedom and so the crow just walked in that Circle and walked in that Circle there was nothing there holding him except for him thinking he was bound he had already been freed by the good man I hope you're hearing me tonight he had already been freed by the good man you've already been freed by the good man but you've got to take your Liberty or you'll forever walk around down there criticizing everybody saying well they're just too emotional they're kind of crazy they don't have no right to shout buddy if you can take your Liberty you'll see that you can soar in the skies with the rest of them you'll quit condemning them you'll quit criticizing it because you're free too but you got to recognize your Liberty you've got to recognize your freedom and I'll tell you how to do it you get in the presence of God were you free one time and you experience how to be free and once you've experienced Freedom you can't go back to the way you were I'm not talking about just emotionalism I'm talking about freedom because the word has come and made you free you're no longer bound by a denomination you're no longer bound by chains of sin you're no longer bound oh come on somebody you're no longer bound to the things of the world but what you are is you are free through the blood that has come and cut the cord and you're no longer stuck there walking in a circle well I'm going to do the same thing you're backslitting and then you're back in the church and you're backslitting and every week is the same old thing you're just going in circles but one day he come and cut the cord for you now is the time to recognize your freedom and take a hold of your wings and go flying into the heavenlies we don't have to walk around in circles in and out of church no more we don't have to go in on Sunday morning and get a pretty good feeling and go out on Monday and feel like we're backsliding no if you're free you'll have freedom all week long because we're not bound by sin that once held us and so when you see the other birds out there flying you can fly with them you just go out there and brother Ram talks about the eagle one time in the Cincinnati Zoo and you know he had he had a love for eagles and animals and so he went in that zoo and he saw that eagle all he said just been captured and he said it was the most pitiful side he'd ever seen and one time he said well it wasn't the most pitiful he said the most pitiful is seeing a son or daughter of God that are chained by sins but he said he went in there and he saw this he saw this Eagle in there and had been captured and he said that bird would try to get out hit his head against the bars and he'd try to flop his wings and he'd hit something over here and he said he was all bloody and running down his face he tried to experience freedom but he couldn't he was still in bondage but he said the only thing he'd do is find himself knocked backward again and he said as he laid there on that floor and his weary eyes soared the skies looked up to the skies that's where I belong why am I still down here he said what a pitiful sight he said made not to be on the earth here he's a Heavenly bird his whole makeup was to live in the blue way above the haunts and cares of the world but he said you see that bird laying there and he said he could never soar those Skies again if he stayed in that bondage he said but by the cunningness of man he had been caged for life I wonder how many of us find ourselves that way the cunningness of man has bound us to something that we don't want to be in but we don't know how to get out he said but brethren to walk out here on the streets of Chicago and these other great cities and find men who were born and shaped in the image of God to be Sons and Daughters of God and to find them caged by sin and habits and cares of this world he said it's a far more pitiful shape than the eagle is and I like this part man was not made to be bound man is a free man he who the son has made free is free indeed he doesn't have to be bound like that oh I hope you hear me tonight you don't have to be bound tonight you are an eagle take your Liberty and fly under the heavenlies you don't have to be bound he said oh it would take me hours to try to express the feeling in my heart and the different things that cage men and deny them of their privileges man's in the image of God and he doesn't have to be a bond slave to Satan he wasn't made to be a slave he was made to be a son all of that he wasn't made to be a slave you were not made to be a slave but you were made to be a Son of God and have the same rights that he had I think we live below our privileges too often we look at the other people getting a blessing and well that's good for them but you know we're we've had some cares of the world that are holding us back we got a cage and we don't see how to get out of it but brother if you just ever surrender your life and your cares to God he'll get you out of that cage and you can fly with the other birds you can look at that eagle and be like hey I can fly higher I'm seeing more Revelation than I've ever seen because if you ever look down from an airplane and you look at the ground you'll see that it's a very different view than walking down the road or driving down the road and you're looking around and you can see the trees and they're taller than you and you can see everything else it's bigger and and but when you get up in a plane you look down well that looks pretty small down there your care start to fade away when you get in the presence of God and you start to Fly Like an Eagle things look different when you get into Heavenly places things look different to a Believer than they did when you were stuck down here in laodicea in the world oh brother I hope you hear me tonight I know this is simple but I think too often we get tied down and we don't know how to worship like we should I'm not here to teach you how to do calisthenics and certain types of Praise but if you ever find your Liberty you can't lay down no longer and take what the devil tells you but you'll find yourself free in the house of God you'll find yourself when you hear the preachers say well I I you know we don't need to have an experience like they did at Acts 2 we just need to walk around shake hands talk to each other and then go home and call it a day brother that's nonsense what we need is the power of the Holy Ghost being preached in the churches again and let our young people have an opportunity at the experience that we've had I'm not taking my kids back to a dead 1970s Church excuse me but I want them to recognize a real genuine outpouring of the Holy Ghost in their lives I'm not satisfied with the way it was I want it to be better for my kids than the way I had it you can go back if you want to but I'm not going back why would you ever want to go back I heard a preacher say this and I'll steal it he said if you're looking in the rearview mirror he said that rear view mirror is very small he said but if you look at the windshield it's very big he said if you'll get your eyes on that win uh rear view mirror brother Bram talks about your wreck he said if you look you've got a bigger view he said there's it's bigger what's in head uh what's ahead of you than it was behind you that stuff in the rearview mirror becomes smaller and the front of you if you look through the windshield it gets bigger and bigger and better and better oh the promises of God are so great and they're so big and there's so many of them but what we've done is we've looked back well I think I want to take my kids back to that I want to take them back to the way we used to have church no sir I want to take them to the promises of God where all the blessings are I don't think we've got time to go back and play Church any longer you say well it was better in my day it was better in the 60s and the 70s well I'll tell you what I think this is the greatest age that you can live in because it takes a lot to overcome it takes a lot of grit to overcome this age but we have an atonement we have a comforter we have somebody who is already on our side he's never lost a battle he's never lost a war and he's not going to start now you say well I'm going to take my kids back there because it was quiet in church brother you all I'll tell you what you lose every one of them I'm setting that dead cold formal chicken pin all you want to I'll tell you what I'm ready to soar the Eagles I'll tell you what you say well it's noisy in here I don't care where Jesus is there is a lot of noise I know you say I'm on one side of the ditch Pastor told us this morning to stay right there in the middle yes sir but I don't think being in the middle of the road means you have to be quiet [Music] I think you can take your Liberty and be right in the middle of the road yes sir I don't I don't think you have to well I hope this is okay I'm not going I don't believe I I get it there's a side over here that if it's a bondage as well you've got to speak in tongues every service you got to scream and run every service or you didn't get nothing then you gotta side over here that if you move or raise your hand too often or Get Up and Scream Hallelujah when the preacher is making a good point they'll tell you shut up that's another ditch but why can't we just have freedom to worship that's the balance we need is freedom to worship the way God has called us to worship I ain't gonna make you get up and say anything and we ain't gonna make you sit down and shut up what we want you to do is come to the house of God and be free to move according to the spirit has moved you I know there's some of the elders that oh they'd love to get up and worship but while you're young and able why don't you take the Liberty once in a while to worship God I tell you what I think we're we get ourselves so carnal we start looking can I just talk to you for a minute can I preach at you for a minute we get carnal I get carnal sometimes and I get to thinking well if I get up you know somebody might have a bad thought about me I can't worship maybe they'd get mad you know we need to leave those things at the door forget about our everyday life just tell the Lord about it and just forget about it and come right in here and have a conscience between you and God and if the word is preached you can respond to it in the freedom and the Liberty wherewith you've been called because you have not been called to come into a denomination and worship the way we've taught you but you've been called To Worship the way you feel like worshiping when the spirit of the Lord moves upon you I tell you what when the spirit comes upon you you're going to move in the way God moves you it may not be like God moves me it may not be like God moves this sister or this brother this sister but what it's going to be is however you worship you can't help but worship it is presence because he wouldn't even be God if you didn't worship Him think about it he wouldn't be God brother Brahm said God is an object of worship if you didn't worship him he wouldn't be God so what you have to do in order for him to be God is worship him as God and if you recognize who he is and how great he is you can't help but worship God because I was once bound I was once down there on the ground and I heard a scream from an eagle become over and said come fly with me oh I've seen things that I've never seen before I've heard things that I've never heard before you know what I heard tapes all my life I heard him and I heard him and I heard him and I was a hearer and a here and here but one day I decided I'm going to go ahead and put the faith that I've heard on the tapes into action and you know what will happen you'll start seeing changes in your children you'll start seeing changes in your church oh come on somebody I come up here and I'll pick on you is that okay can I pick on you no oh I'm going to anyway because you're my kid we moved up here and it was just a few months after we got here it's okay Lord put it on his heart to be baptized why because he felt the presence of the Lord or the service one time you tell me the presence of God don't matter anymore you can get up here and preach the message all you want to but if the fire baptisms in the Holy Ghost ain't moving across the people you're doing something wrong if you're standing if you're standing here telling them this is what brother Branham said this is what brother Graham said this is what brother Branham said go home you never gave an opportunity for the spirit of the Lord to work on the people I'm not trying to condemn anybody what I'm trying to tell you is you don't have to sit down there no longer you've got to move into the heavenlies where all things are new where there's actually freedom to worship I don't want the bondage church let the churches that have bondage had bondage but I think right here at Word of Life Tabernacle we need to let it be Word of Life we need to let the Living Word move Among Us we need to let the word of God stir us up and make us something different we're not good enough just going in circles I'm not going back to what I was yesterday why because the word changed me today and I'm not going back the word will move you the water of the washing of the word will make you free because it is freedom it is to loose you and to set you free oh it's not legalism legalism's over here and you're living and you say well I gotta wear a dress and I got to grow my hair out and but you don't have the Holy Ghost making you do it that's legalism but if the holy spirit is in you you can't help but live for God you live Godly in Christ Jesus why because you're free to do exactly what God has wanted you to do see God moves upon a life and it makes you change it's not a force it's something in you that makes you change it makes you act different it makes your nature change oh come on somebody I know you're going to fight the flesh I know you're going to fight Satan's Eden I understand the age that we're living in is laodicea I understand those things but you are an overcomer and you are to come up higher than the world you are not to live like the world you go out here and you see them and they're dressed up and are dressed down or whatever you want to call it and they got their their blue hair and and they've got their short shorts on and you walk out they ain't got no clothes on and then they call somebody this dress decent with a nice skirt or nice dress on they call you crazy and if you look at them they are the very definition of crazy they're half naked walking on the street but see we don't serve under bondage we are the most free people on the face of the Earth I would say you as message Believers are the only free people on the face of the Earth because you're serving something we are serving a living God you're either serving a denomination or a Creed you're serving I don't care if you're Pentecostal and you shout every service if you're having to do that just to do it that's bondage I'm not saying you have to scream and holler I'm not saying you have to do anything but experience the presence of God one time and I I challenge you to sit still you say whatever service I don't feel like it well buddy we don't go by feelings and emotions around here we go by the word of the word of God and if the word can't move you you better get back in the word again get down to the altar again get you a refilling of the Holy Ghost and it don't matter who's preaching the word the word will move you in such a way that you can't sit there no longer because you say well I don't like that preacher I like this preacher he's my favorite and I'm going I'll stand up all service for him and that's good you know sometimes when you get a bunch of people together and you see how the spirit of the Lord just really moves and that's wonderful but brother don't let the word have none effect on you because it's coming from a different source if your pastor says it and not your favorite evangelist it's still the word of God can you say Amen if if a preacher that you may not like says it I'm talking about me I'm talking about you know some of these preachers that Ben has in no I'm just about Stewart he ain't here but the Ben said God could use a donkey one of the first times I ever preached that's what he said you know you didn't know that brother Jeff that's what he said you wasn't here for that yeah but God can use anybody what I'm saying is if if the word is coming from any Source if you're sitting there listening to a tape is it background noise or do those words really coming and set you free because you're free by the word Christ is the word he came down and he cut the cords remember when he went down I'm so far off my notes I don't know where I'm at but let me tell you this after he died brother Daryl made such a beautiful illustration and told the story like nobody else but after he died he goes down into hell and he said you could hear the chains breaking loose and you could hear the the the the the cuffs and things coming off the wrists and the he did that all down there in hell where he spent three days just setting the captive free releasing the bondage but you know he comes right into a service like this and he goes down and somebody's dealing with something and you say I'm bound to this Habit in the world I'm bound to this thing that's holding me you're bound to something but there's a man in here walking the aisles and he's here to set you free he's here to move you and take you out of that condition and you don't have to go back tomorrow that's the good part because who the son has set free is free indeed you don't go back tomorrow to the chains you're not free on a 72-hour pass or a 24-hour pass but you're free from here all the way to Glory or you'll never be bound again what we let behind us is our own minds and I I heard a brother speak this and it really struck my heart he said there's a war going on in here because God is telling you you've already been free and Satan is telling you constantly that you're bound it's what it is you're constantly bound to something and Satan will use something that's not even binding you but he'll try to make it mind you he'll give you a love for sports more than the love for God you may have been a holy ghost filled Christian and all of a sudden you realize hey I'd rather go watch a football game than go to church well what you've done is you've allowed him to tie you to something that is now bondage I'm not saying you're not a Christian what I'm saying is you're allowing Satan to do that because really if you could look the cord's already been broken you don't have to go back to that we're purposely going back to it but we've been freed all the time but we've never left the ground we've sat down there oh come on somebody y'all sitting in the back I'll come to you look this Crow was walking around he never knew he was free because he never soared into the sky to experience the presence of God and some of you have been free for 30 40 years but you've never experienced the presence of God because you've never taken your Liberty and danced a little bit you've never taken your Liberty and shouted a little bit because that's the way you'll know that you're free when God moves upon you and there's nothing holding you back anymore I say give it a try sometime you might be surprised how good it feels but see you're walking around you're not even tired he's already set you free I'm looking at the clock because I forgot to start my timer he's already set you free but you don't recognize your freedom so tonight I wonder get on way on down here brother where I'm talking about the slaves he was in Illinois there and he walked by a museum you've heard the story you know what I'm talking about he's walking down there and he sees these these men that were slaves looking in this window and he said I believe he says it something like this tears are running down their face and they're just standing there looking in this window and he walks over to him and he said he said excuse me gentlemen what's making you cry I'd ask you this what's making you act fanatical what's making what's making you act so crazy in church brother I'm going to ask him and he says at least I'm looking at that suit there that dresser I think he called it he said that's Abraham Lincoln's he said you see that blood on there he said I've still got the marks from the slave belt around me where I was in bondage but he said that blood on that man right there set me free you know if you ever recognize that you're going to act a little crazy sometimes because it don't matter how many times you fail down here and walk in that Circle if you ever experience the heavenlies one time you'll never forget it you never come back to where you were because God has so loved you that he gave an ultimate sacrifice for you so that you don't have to live in bondage any longer we should always try to experience the presence of God because he's always here to meet you brother Graham said if that would excite a slave man by taking a slave belt by Abraham Lincoln taking the slave bet what ought the blood of Christ do to a believer and they tell us not to be emotional about it they tell us not to cry they tell you not to scream out God has done so much for me I can't help but get happy about it I can't help but experience the Liberty that he gave me because it's not something I'm working up it's not something that I have to have to force my way into but I recognize what he did and so now I just take what he did for me and I take that love and I take all the I take that forgiveness that he gave me and now I can have forgiveness for somebody else I could have love for somebody else I could have Liberty to love one another we could have Liberty to love each other why because he loved us it's liberty we're freed we're no longer in bondage well you see I don't feel that way brother let's get on our knees one time and look to Calvary and if you could ever ever recognize what he did for you you'll be the most free man and woman in the world because you'll recognize he did it so you don't have to brother man talks about a hero he talks about man in Switzerland there he said was it Arnold Von Winkler I believe it was he said he said he got over there he said he said years ago in Switzerland there were some Germans that went up into the mountains and they didn't want war these were peaceful people they go up there and he said he said they go and he said they realized it was an oncoming Army and he said these men were trained and built like bricks every man fully covered by armor and he said here's a little Swiss to not knowing what to do and finally there was a young fellow stepped up by the name name of Arnold Von Winkler at our however you pronounced Satin he said man of Switzerland this day I'm going to give my life for my nation he said this morning over across the mountain I kissed my wife goodbye and my three little children for the last time I'll never see them again and he said I want you all to look after them but this day I must give my life for Switzerland they said Arnold what will you do he said you just follow me and fight with all you've got follow the one who gave it all and fight with all you've got he looked around until he found a very deepest spot of the Spears and he raised his arms toward heaven and he screamed to the top of his voice he said Make Way for Liberty and he started running and he said he screamed again Make Way for Liberty and as he rushed towards the army with his hands up and his open booze into the spears he said more than a hundred Spears reached for him and he grabbed them with his arms and throwed them into his bosom and there he died with those Spears in his bosom but he said the heroism routed the aliens and they went to pieces and the Swiss run in with their clubs and sticks and beat the Army out of the nation it took one man to go free for a whole nation to go free it took one man for the worst sinner in the city to go free there was a maniac in the Bible but there was a man come by his way and set him free there was the worst sinner in Hardy Arkansas but there's a man that came on the scene the presence of a man had come along and he set you free you don't have to die a sinner's death no longer because you have been made free brother Graham said there never was a hero like the Lord Jesus you believe that's a night one day when Adam's race stood in the corner backed up by the powers of the devil and all great units of spiritualism and all kinds of isms had Adams Race in the corner sickness diseases every enemy of the human race had Adam's race backed into the corner but he said there was one who spoke in heaven and said I'm going down to earth to get my life for Adam's race and he came to the Earth and he found where the deepest of the spears was death he said there he rushed and grabbed the Spear of death into his Precious Heart I hope you're hearing me he said his Precious Heart of Calvary he conquered death and when he went back up into Glory he sent down the baptism of the Holy Spirit to his subjects that's you and me and he said he sent down into his subjects and he said and he said take this and fight with all your strength he said oh Brethren what man tries to pick up something else let's take what Christ sent us and fight with everything that's in us we don't have to be trained men we don't have to be trained people we have to be willing people that's what we need don't take what they're trying to educate into you don't take some mental conception of the message but take what you got and go fight with every inch of ground you can God just wants some willing people I believe there's some willing worshipers in the building tonight I believe there's somebody who wants to find their freedom in the message of the hour we're not bound by the message we are free by the message we are not bound but we are loosed by the water of the washing of the word that's what we want brother bam talked about he said there was a blessing they were they was blessing God for the Holy Ghost which had never come yet but they believed that it was because they believed that it was because God was going to keep his promise and when they kept blessing God when they kept you said it hadn't come on me yet praise God anyway it's coming have you been baptized are you coming to the house of the Lord you're doing what you know to do keep praising God you say well if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can't Praise Him it's not what a prophet said he said they kept blessing God until that atmosphere just got right and then there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and filled all the house where they were setting all the atmosphere got right we don't need to shout in church the atmosphere for these children to be born again and serve God has got to be just right he said they kept blessing God and the atmosphere got just right he said oh couldn't we get an atmosphere here oh I hope you hear me now he gets personal here if you listen to it he said couldn't we get an atmosphere here that every crippled every blind every sick person everything that takes everything with all one Accord leave our fussing outside leave your back biting somewhere else come into the house of God in one Accord believing that somebody is going to be healed somebody may leave here and it'd be their last service but you need to come to the house of God and you are a creator of an atmosphere so if you don't need nothing from God at least you can do is come and create an atmosphere for somebody else do you care about the young people do you care about the other elderly people do you care about your spouse do you care about any oh come on somebody I think it's time we cared for somebody sitting next to us more than ourselves well I don't get a blessing out of services no more but if you bring an atmosphere then God can bless somebody else oh I feel good right now I think we'll preach for a minute I think it's time we quit taking our little isms and ideas and putting Christ on the outside I think it's time we come back and have an experience again you say well I got the Holy Ghost 30 years ago and I'm a pretty good Christian and a spirit American Sonia there's one baptism but there's many refillings and I think we forget that sometimes you young people say well I got the Holy Ghost already don't stop there take your freedom and your Liberty to get refilled and what we want to do you say well I've got the Holy Ghost okay then let's come here to the house of God and let's create an atmosphere where our children want to be in it you say well we got to get the music right for the young people yeah no what you need is the presence of God for the young people you don't have to have the biggest crowd for the young people you don't have to have more young people for the young people what you have to have for the young people is the spirit and the liberty of Christ where they can be set free I'll tell you what there's a lot of addictions for our youth today and it's time that we stop playing around with church and we say we come here oh well can I preach for a minute God has not given us a spirit to sit around and backed by one another and say well this these kids don't matter their party is going to grow up and they're going to have to learn on their own and you know what they did to sin and they can do the praying I get tired of that here hearing that kind of stuff you know why because somebody prayed for me Somebody Prayed For You somebody thought enough of you to keep the doors open to a church and to pray you through one time at the altar and if you haven't experienced you need to go to young people my heart goes out to him because I know what it's like to live a backslidden life I know what it's like to grow up in the message and you want something and you're sitting there and it's so dead and it's so cold that you can't go to the altar oh come on somebody I know my time's up give me five more minutes he'll give me five more minutes 5 10 15 there we go we have gotten into condition that we think well it's word only now we're just going to preach the word preach the word well what the problem is is you're not preaching the word in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost because if you do it will move people to the altar we don't have to beg them but if you'll ever move if you'll ever preach the real fire baptism of the Holy Ghost and you'll ever preach the word in a passionate way I don't think we have to have teachers all over the house I think we need preachers to preach it and conviction upon the hearts of the sinners but I sit in church and it was cold and formal but let me tell you something young people will have addictions if you don't watch out and if there's no atmosphere in the church I hope you hear me now then they're going to find an atmosphere somewhere that will move them they're going to run towards something they're going to go out oh I hope you hear me now they're they're going to run towards something they're going to go after things in the world because they're going to satisfy something but if you'll ever get them in the presence of God they will never be the same or they may run out but they know what to come back to because the world can't satisfy you like Jesus can the world can't satisfy you the world can give you a time of pleasure and then you'll realize oh I'm tied to this I can't get away from it and it's bondage but in the message of the hour there's freedom [Music] the church we don't need to bring bondage back to church we need to bring freedom back to the house of God said oh brother musicians go ahead and come my time is way up he said oh brother God send us an atmosphere that'll make it of one Accord in one place and let the power of God surge down through oh come on somebody let the power of God surge through the building we're gonna try to stop it around here if if the word is moving the people let the people move if the music's moving them they might get out of control but if the word is moving the people I dare you stop it because God if he's moving them let them get in an atmosphere where they can be changed we're not trying to just get a big church and and fill it up with a bunch of members we want people who have come in contact with the word of God and the presence of God has moved on their life in such a way that they can no longer stay down there in the Earthly things and they can no longer be tied to the things of the world but they can soar into the heavenlies and move up higher into the things of God why because we're not bound any longer but we're free I say we're free this evening I said we're free we don't have to worry oh come on somebody you don't have to worry about your pastor coming in here getting mad for you shouting a little bit because he believes in the freedom of the Holy Ghost if you get to dance in a little bit maybe we'll dance with you I'll tell you it's time for freedom to come back to the house of God I said we need to create an atmosphere of freedom in the house of God again he said that atmosphere gets right it opens up every clog think about it the atmosphere gets just right and it opens up every clog you know the spirits that try to come in and stop you from praising stop you from worshiping stop it from moving when the word's moving you it opens up every clog the law of God will move it moves back every clog I wonder if we could stand to our feet that last quote that I read you the brand preaches that in expectation 1954. what really struck me was oh brother [Music] God send us an atmosphere that'll make us a one Accord and I thought I want that to be my prayer if there's something in me that's stopping you from getting a blessing Lord take it out of me if there's something in me that is hindering my brother and sister from getting a blessing move it out of me so they can be blessed I want a blessing but I want them to be blessed more than me I want to see them on fire more than me so move it out of me I want this to be a church I believe her pastor will tell you we want this to be a church where the word is preached and the people have a freedom to respond to it and we want there to be a freedom in your life so you can be changed oh do you believe it are you free this evening oh how many is free can you put your hand up and say I'm free I'm not bound anymore I'm free oh you've traveled you went down a long lonely road but brother today you can say thank God I am free I wonder if we could sing with all of our hearts now thank God I am free free oh with all your hearts from this world are you free from sin this evening I've been a washed in the
