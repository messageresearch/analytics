[30:27] Lord when troubles common and trials
[30:32] Lord seems like rules our lives but Lord
[30:35] we can come aside for just a moment on a
[30:38] Wednesday night and hear your word and
[30:42] the trial seems less real the trouble
[30:44] seems less as we look at your word Lord
[30:48] and we know that your word is true Lord
[30:51] that the circumstances aren't true that
[30:53] the symptoms are lying vanities but your
[30:56] word is true Lord and I pray God that
[30:59] you'd make our your word real in all of
[31:01] our hearts for every person Lord that
[31:04] made a sacrifice to come on a Wednesday
[31:06] night order to watch this evening I pray
[31:09] that you just move in their lives and
[31:11] speak to them Lord individually to every
[31:14] person to my heart as well we pray
[31:17] Jesus name
[31:20] amen amen god bless you turn with me to
[31:24] revelations chapter five and verse eight
[31:26] get right into the word tonight and just
[31:30] trust that the Lord will do great things
[31:32] among us revelations chapter five and
[31:35] verse eight I love to preach on
[31:39] Wednesday nights because it's so good to
[31:42] see all of you here and I thought I
[31:44] don't love Sundays as well but it just
[31:46] seems like Wednesday night is just a
[31:48] special effort put forth by the people
[31:50] of God to be in the house of God and so
[31:53] I know you want to hear the word or you
[31:55] wouldn't be here and so we want to we
[31:57] want to get into the word tonight I want
[32:00] to speak to you on it just may seem like
[32:02] an odd title but I think you'll know
[32:04] soon where I'm going I want to speak to
[32:07] you on prayer and the open book prayer
[32:10] and the open book revelations 5:8 and
[32:12] when he had taken the book the four
[32:14] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[32:17] down before the lamb having every one of
[32:21] them harps and golden vials full of
[32:24] odours which are the prayers of saints
[32:28] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[32:31] worthy to take the book to open the
[32:34] seals thereof for that was slain and has
[32:36] two redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[32:39] of every kindred and tongue and people
[32:42] and nation and as made us unto our gods
[32:45] kings and priests we shall reign on the
[32:50] earth I pray the Lord would add his
[32:51] blessing to the word you may be seated
[32:53] this evening God's people have always
[32:59] believed in prayer and first Timothy 2:8
[33:04] Paul tells us he says I will therefore
[33:06] that men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[33:11] hands without wrath and doubting Martin
[33:15] Luther told us when he came he said I
[33:18] have so much to do I'm gonna spend the
[33:20] first three hours in prayer that's a
[33:23] good mindset he said I've got so much to
[33:26] do that I need to spend three hours in
[33:28] prayer to get it done John Wesley said
[33:31] that the neglect of prayer is a grand
[33:33] hindrance
[33:33] to holiness brother branham says this in
[33:38] in faith in 1956 he said prayer changes
[33:41] things for prayer changes death to life
[33:44] do we believe that tonight for air
[33:47] changes sickness to health hey men so if
[33:51] you're sick pray prayer changed your
[33:55] sickness to health changes sinners to
[33:57] Saints if you're a sinner you can pray
[34:01] it's prayer he said you may laugh too
[34:04] much you may shout too much you may eat
[34:06] too much I know that's true for me but
[34:10] you'll never pray too much it said that
[34:15] in Africa and I know there's probably
[34:17] some African brothers that will hear
[34:18] this they do my heart was won a couple
[34:23] of years ago around this time when we
[34:24] went there and they say early on in
[34:28] Africa that converts to Christianity
[34:31] were earnest and they were regular in
[34:33] prayer and each one would have a spot in
[34:37] the thicket in the jungle where they
[34:39] would go and pour out their heart to God
[34:42] over time there would be a path that
[34:44] would wear to the place where they pray
[34:47] each one had his own place and as a
[34:50] result if one of these believers began
[34:52] to neglect prayer grass would begin to
[34:56] grow over the path and their brethren
[35:01] would look at them and they would say
[35:02] brother
[35:03] they said the grass grows on your path
[35:07] you've not been praying like you used to
[35:12] and I would present to you tonight that
[35:16] when you see a backslidden heart there's
[35:18] almost always an absence of Prayer it's
[35:23] like a leading indicator you know they
[35:24] have leading indicators for the economy
[35:26] that that there's if you see this
[35:29] indicator you know the economy is about
[35:31] to go down or to go up but prayer is a
[35:35] leading indicator of backsliding and
[35:37] it's something that we don't see because
[35:40] we don't make long prayers in the house
[35:41] of God we come here to hear the word but
[35:45] we pray in our closet at home and
[35:47] what Jesus told us to do but so we don't
[35:50] see it but yet it's evident in our lives
[35:53] if we don't pray I know to myself I can
[35:58] tell when I'm not praying like I should
[36:01] I remember some years ago we asked some
[36:04] young people what they struggled with
[36:06] the most and we thought well maybe it
[36:08] would be drugs or you wouldn't think
[36:12] message people would struggle with that
[36:13] but some do you'd think maybe sexual sin
[36:15] or different things and some older young
[36:17] people we asked them and almost everyone
[36:20] said prayer just having the time and
[36:23] taking the time and the opportunity to
[36:25] pray and talk to God during the day was
[36:27] the thing that they struggle with the
[36:29] most you know what I think that's
[36:32] probably true of all of us if there's
[36:35] something that would convict my heart if
[36:37] somebody would come and preach on prayer
[36:39] it would probably convicted my heart
[36:41] more than anything else because I know
[36:42] no matter how much that time I spend in
[36:45] prayer I wish I spent more time I wish
[36:48] that I that had taken more time because
[36:51] none of the time that I spent in prayer
[36:53] was wasted and some of the time I spent
[36:56] talking I talked too much some other
[36:59] time by the John that I spent doing
[37:00] other things I did those things too much
[37:02] but I never spent too much time in
[37:04] prayer you can go back over the history
[37:08] of the church and the history of God's
[37:10] people you can find that the men of God
[37:12] were prayer warriors people who were
[37:15] mightily used by God were prayer
[37:17] warriors and I'm so grateful and this
[37:20] was sparked sister Fritz a little bit my
[37:22] conversation that we had as we talked
[37:24] about it and certain things that she
[37:26] told me that she had prayed about and
[37:27] God answered her prayer I said God he's
[37:30] still answers prayer and we say that as
[37:33] if maybe he doesn't answer prayers often
[37:35] but what I want to tell you today even
[37:37] though it seems like today people pray
[37:39] less than they ever have what I'd like
[37:42] to show you by the scripture and the
[37:44] message is that prayer is not only still
[37:46] relevant but it's more relevant today
[37:49] than it's ever been and I will tell you
[37:54] and I believe I can tell you this by the
[37:56] scripture by the message of the hour
[37:57] that this is the hour of answer
[38:00] prayers that were actually living in the
[38:04] hour when all prayers get answered now
[38:11] of all the people who pray in the
[38:14] scripture in history the Bible records
[38:17] perhaps more instances of Jesus himself
[38:21] praying than any of the older New
[38:24] Testament Saints he was a man of Prayer
[38:29] and you think about it when we think of
[38:31] Prayer we think well I need prayer
[38:32] because I'm not what I should be
[38:34] but Jesus was exactly what he should be
[38:36] he never sinned never backs it and
[38:40] thought or deed never did anything like
[38:43] that though he was tempted he never
[38:45] strayed and he constantly stayed in
[38:48] prayer and in a few instances of that in
[38:53] Luke chapter 6 and verse 12 and I'm kind
[38:55] of laying a foundation for where we want
[38:57] to go tonight and they'll take me awhile
[38:59] to get there but then it won't take long
[39:00] so you just hang with me Luke chapter 6
[39:04] and verse 12 it says it come to pass in
[39:05] those days that he went out in a
[39:07] mountain to pray and he continued all
[39:09] night in prayer to God
[39:13] now we don't make long prayers in public
[39:16] Jesus always went away from the crowd to
[39:18] pray but he did pray for a long time he
[39:24] prayed all night
[39:25] we're not commissioned as a church to do
[39:28] a whole night prayer meetings and to
[39:29] hold those that like they used to do and
[39:32] in some churches but brother Branham
[39:34] when if you'll watch him over the years
[39:36] he uses this against as an indictment
[39:39] almost of the Pentecostal people that
[39:42] they've gotten away from all-night
[39:44] prayer meetings he never told us to do
[39:47] that but he used it as an indictment of
[39:49] them that they'd gotten away from this
[39:52] and so and but the Branham uses it like
[39:56] an indicator like we said that he uses
[39:59] that and then a lack of attendance on
[40:01] Wednesday night when she talked about
[40:02] that used to be called prayer meeting
[40:04] night so now we have a regular service
[40:07] and then it would have been just a time
[40:09] for a lot of churches to be just a time
[40:11] of prayer and so they would come
[40:13] together and pray
[40:13] and the people quit attending on that
[40:15] night because they had better things to
[40:16] do brother branham uses that and here
[40:20] you him just as an example of it he said
[40:22] see they don't believe it he said
[40:23] they're getting away from it a by day
[40:25] falling farther and farther away he said
[40:29] you know that you don't have to think
[40:30] about it some of you old people and some
[40:33] of you tonight are old to some of us but
[40:36] age is relative you're only as old as
[40:39] you feel but he said some of you old
[40:40] people have been in this longer than I
[40:42] have
[40:42] he said look back a few years ago what
[40:45] it was all-night prayer meetings he said
[40:49] what do you do tonight let off on
[40:50] Wednesday night now again I'm not I'm
[40:52] not promoting that I'm not saying that's
[40:54] what we should do but he's using it as
[40:56] an indicator of how far they'd fallen he
[40:59] said what do you do tonight let off on a
[41:01] Wednesday night maybe about 6 o'clock or
[41:02] 7 o'clock maybe you don't even come to
[41:05] prayer meeting you want to go see some
[41:07] old filthy television thing or some
[41:09] woman married four or five times some
[41:11] man or some man married four or five
[41:13] times in and say you love God staying
[41:15] away from prayer meetings well that's
[41:17] just straight gospel preaching is then
[41:20] so and we find that jesus prayed all
[41:24] night
[41:24] and mark 1:35 it says in the morning
[41:27] rising up a great while before a day you
[41:31] went out and departed into a solitary
[41:33] place there pray mark 646 when he'd sent
[41:38] them the multitudes away he said we need
[41:40] sent him away he departed into a
[41:41] mountain to pray Luke 5 and 16 he would
[41:45] he withdrew himself into the wilderness
[41:47] and prayed why did he have to pray he
[41:52] prayed for others true but he also
[41:54] prayed for himself the Bible says that
[41:59] look at Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 7
[42:02] says who in the days of his flesh when
[42:04] he'd offered up prayers and
[42:06] supplications with strong crying and
[42:08] tears unto him that was able to save him
[42:11] from death who was he praying for he's
[42:14] praying for himself he was praying for
[42:18] himself but he said not my will but
[42:21] thine be done but he he was heard
[42:27] listen what it says under him that was
[42:28] able to save him from death and was
[42:30] heard in that he feared
[42:32] now that word feared is actually means
[42:35] reverenced or sincerity he was heard
[42:39] because he was sincere and he reverence
[42:41] gone even though he was gone it's prayer
[42:47] life so impressed his disciples that
[42:49] they said teach us to pray now when God
[42:53] sent us a profit on this end time he
[42:55] gave him a commission and he said to him
[42:58] this he said that if he could get the
[43:00] people to believe you and be sincere
[43:03] when you pray so it's not just prayer
[43:08] but sincere prayer be sincere when you
[43:12] pray nothing would stand in the way of
[43:15] the prayer you talked about giving a man
[43:19] faith if an angel come and told you if
[43:21] you be sincere nothing will stand in the
[43:25] way of the prayer and so earlier brother
[43:28] branham's ministry he would actually go
[43:30] in the prayer lines he would pray for
[43:31] that person that child whoever it was
[43:33] until they were well and everyone that
[43:37] passed by and he found out later wasn't
[43:38] the right thing to do because God
[43:40] allowed some of those people to be sick
[43:42] like that but God he's so believed in
[43:45] his commission that everyone that passed
[43:48] by I believe could be well why because
[43:51] God told him that if you'll be sincere
[43:53] when you pray nothing will stand in the
[43:55] way of the prayer and he says not even
[43:57] cancer because cancer was the incurable
[44:00] disease that people were afraid of I
[44:02] think people can say that today if we'll
[44:05] be sincere if we'll be sincere if we
[44:07] pray and ask God there's nothing that
[44:09] can stand in the way because we come
[44:14] under we're not a prophet we were
[44:15] commissioned as a prophet but we come
[44:17] under that anointing of H now brother
[44:21] Brandon sees a vision I'm kind of
[44:23] walking through this as I said to kind
[44:24] of background what we're going to say he
[44:27] sees a vision of a serpent striking his
[44:29] friend and the serpent is striking and
[44:33] he said just sin and paradox he said
[44:36] just then the serpent turned to me when
[44:38] I said that looked at me again and a
[44:40] voice came from
[44:40] me and said you've been given power to
[44:43] bind him the worst or any that some
[44:47] power is then you've been given power to
[44:50] bind him the worst irini and i said well
[44:52] god what must I do he said there's one
[44:55] thing you must do you must be more
[44:57] sincere see you must be more sincere now
[45:02] we know from reading the message that
[45:05] sincerity isn't everything I know from
[45:07] reading the scripture that's true Cain
[45:09] was sincere but he was sincerely wrong
[45:12] as what we call it but sincerity is a
[45:15] necessary ingredient and I've said it
[45:18] this way you can be sincere and be wrong
[45:20] but you can't be insincere and be right
[45:25] all right it's just like if I have a 100
[45:29] dollar bill in my pocket which I don't
[45:30] but if I had a hundred dollar bill in my
[45:32] pocket and I pulled it out if it looks
[45:35] like 100 dollar bill it could be a real
[45:37] hundred dollar bill could be a forgery
[45:39] it's one or the other but if I pull it
[45:43] out and it don't even look like 100 our
[45:44] bill we know it's not right sincerity
[45:49] could show up in a in in a wrong way but
[45:51] it could show up for the truth as well
[45:54] right now so he told that the angel told
[45:59] him you must be more sincere one thing
[46:02] you must do now I think I thought of
[46:05] this as I was studying today I thought
[46:08] of the woman in Memphis a little black
[46:10] mother she's standing there and in her
[46:13] sincerity she doesn't know anything she
[46:16] doesn't know anything like we know and
[46:18] she's standing a little woman in Memphis
[46:21] by herself and this this is something
[46:23] real that happened now you can believe
[46:25] it when it talks about Moses parting the
[46:27] Red Sea and those things that's
[46:28] wonderful we're talking about something
[46:30] God did in our hour and just a few years
[46:33] ago and God Hill does those things today
[46:36] it's not limited to brother Branham he's
[46:37] sealed he still works today but here we
[46:41] saw something that my prophet told that
[46:43] how that here was this woman standing
[46:45] there and she's the Lord revealed to her
[46:47] she was like the shoe to my woman but
[46:50] she said I found the shoe to my woman
[46:52] wearing is Elijah
[46:54] oh my and brother branham talked about
[46:57] how when he went in her house he said
[46:59] she was acquainted with prayer she knew
[47:01] who she was talking to she'd done that
[47:04] before he whisper down when someone is
[47:08] is a prayer a prayer when someone prays
[47:10] you know it because they've been there
[47:12] acquainted with that they're not
[47:13] uncomfortable with it they've talked to
[47:15] him before and here he said brother
[47:20] baron said that woman poor illiterate
[47:22] woman hardly knew where the next meal
[47:24] was coming from but her sincerity to the
[47:27] God that she loved could ground that
[47:29] plane hey Ben it could ground the plane
[47:34] that brother Branham was on hold that
[47:35] plane until the prayer of faith was
[47:37] prayed over her he said in that and over
[47:40] her boy he could take a man and move him
[47:42] so I couldn't go up in the plane the
[47:44] Spirit of God turning you around what
[47:46] did it the sincerity and prayer of that
[47:49] woman
[47:51] prayer still works
[47:56] now look but the man said or taught us
[48:00] that now their prayers that God doesn't
[48:03] answer right away we all know that
[48:07] there's prayer said that that seems like
[48:10] he never answers but he does answer our
[48:13] prayers but not always at the moment we
[48:17] ask him right some of you have prayed
[48:21] prayers that it took years to get an
[48:24] answer to but your witness today that
[48:27] you got this answer prayer could you
[48:31] stand on your knees and you you kept
[48:33] asking God and maybe at some point
[48:34] you've got an assurance in your heart
[48:36] and you believe that you held on to that
[48:37] and then when you believe that what
[48:40] happened God did it but maybe not right
[48:44] all at once now you might say well what
[48:48] happens to those prayers now when John
[48:51] is caught up in Revelation he sees a
[48:53] throne room in heaven and round about
[48:56] the throne were four and 20 seats in
[48:59] Revelation 4 or 4 he said and upon the
[49:02] seats I saw four and twenty elders
[49:03] sitting clothed in white raiment hat on
[49:07] their head
[49:08] crowns of gold now John gives us three
[49:11] clues to who they are
[49:12] he says the seats were Thrones he says
[49:16] have white raiment on they have crowns
[49:19] of gold
[49:20] no the Thrones are for over comers we
[49:24] find that Revelation chapter three and
[49:25] verse 21
[49:26] to him that overcometh well I grant to
[49:28] sit with me in my throne then we know
[49:30] that couldn't be an angel or the random
[49:33] TARDIS said it wasn't it couldn't be an
[49:34] angel because angels don't overcome
[49:36] anything right that's us
[49:41] Thrones also speak of judgment that
[49:44] there would be judgment given and we
[49:45] know that will even the Saints will even
[49:47] judge angels but you can pick that up in
[49:50] Revelations 20 and 4 when he talks about
[49:52] the he said I saw Thrones and judgment
[49:54] was given unto them and in Daniel 7 and
[49:56] 9 where it talks about the Ancient of
[49:58] Days and I won't read it to save time
[50:00] but you can go back and look at that and
[50:01] you find that in that time he says I
[50:04] beheld till the thrones were cast down
[50:05] or placed and when that happened then
[50:08] the Ancient of Days did sit but Daniel
[50:12] when he sees it but the remm says when
[50:13] he saw the Thrones that's a judgment
[50:14] they were empty he's seen Thrones cast
[50:18] down and this gives us another clues to
[50:20] who these 24 elders are he said he saw
[50:23] the thrones cast down come down from
[50:25] heaven the ancient of time came down
[50:27] from heaven but when John saw it the
[50:28] throne was already occupied by Jesus he
[50:31] said on the Thrones for the disciples
[50:32] and the patriarchs redeemed was already
[50:35] fulfilled oh my so they had Thrones they
[50:39] had white raiment which is a type as we
[50:41] know of righteousness the bride is
[50:43] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[50:46] and the souls under the altar even are
[50:51] given white robes those Jews that died
[50:54] under Hitler and I mean they were given
[50:55] white robes so we find white raiment
[50:59] they also had crowns of gold in
[51:01] Revelations
[51:02] 2:10 it talks about that and you can
[51:04] read that where it says be thou faithful
[51:06] unto death and I will give thee a crown
[51:08] of life
[51:10] 1st Peter 5 and 4 talks about when the
[51:13] chief Shepherd shall appear you shall
[51:15] receive a crown of glory you shall
[51:17] receive a crown of glory
[51:20] now we're getting down to where we
[51:22] understand who these people are that
[51:24] it's not just random angels or some kind
[51:28] of a beast or some kind of power that
[51:30] sits before the throne of God but these
[51:33] are ones with with Thrones with crowns
[51:36] white raiment Paul says in 2nd Timothy
[51:41] 4:8 his fourth third slayed up for me a
[51:43] crown of righteousness which the Lord at
[51:45] the righteous which the Lord the
[51:47] righteous judge shall give me at that
[51:49] day and not to me only but unto all them
[51:51] also that love disappearing
[51:53] hey man you should sing the old song I'm
[51:56] gonna have a crown I'm gonna have a
[52:00] crown when the trumpet sounds I'm not
[52:02] much of a singer but you've heard it I
[52:04] think it's an old black spirit so I'm
[52:05] gonna have a crown what is that why
[52:07] because that's what the scripture says
[52:09] there's laid up for me a crown there's
[52:14] already one waiting for me won't be any
[52:17] crowns without heads to put put them on
[52:21] so now there's crowns and there's
[52:24] Thrones and there's white raiment my
[52:27] brother Brown who says in Revelation
[52:28] chapter 4 number 2 and I would encourage
[52:30] you to go if you have any questions
[52:32] about this tonight because I'm going
[52:33] through it hurriedly to get a point
[52:34] across to you but you can go in and read
[52:37] in Revelation chapter 4 number 1 and 2
[52:40] and brother Brown talks about these
[52:41] things he says they were not angelic
[52:44] beings they were not heavenly beings
[52:47] they were redeemed men he said you can
[52:51] consider their dress you can consider
[52:54] their position you consider the songs
[52:56] and know that they were not angelic
[52:58] beings I could stop and preach on that
[53:00] for a while because the same thing is
[53:03] true of us when you look at the dress
[53:06] you look at the way at their position
[53:08] you look at the songs you look at
[53:10] everything about us were redeemed very
[53:13] bad so what the writer said you could
[53:16] look at what John saw and see these were
[53:17] redeemed means they were not angelic
[53:19] beings because they sang about
[53:21] Redemption amen now we know from the
[53:26] scripture 12 of these are identified in
[53:28] Matthew 19 to 28 when Jesus said verily
[53:30] I say unto you that you would you
[53:31] followed me in the regeneration when the
[53:33] Son of
[53:34] we'll sit in the throne of his glory you
[53:36] should also shall sit upon twelve
[53:37] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[53:40] now brother Branham again explains that
[53:44] in questions and answers he got a
[53:46] question on this in 1957 on questions
[53:48] and answers on Hebrews number three and
[53:51] he says now an elder is an overseer
[53:53] he said no notice there were twelve
[53:55] patriarchs and twelve apostles twelve
[53:59] patriarchs and twelve apostles twelve
[54:01] from the Old Testament twelve from the
[54:03] New Testament he said and they were
[54:05] standing twelve on one side and twelve
[54:08] on the other he said now we found out
[54:11] that these and this is from Revelation
[54:13] chapter four he said we found out again
[54:15] and number chapter four number three he
[54:17] preached three sermons I believe are
[54:19] four sermons on that he said then we
[54:21] found out that these were elders he said
[54:23] an elder has never applied to an angel
[54:24] or any being he said it is a redeemed
[54:27] human being elders he said because
[54:30] throws crowns and Dominion has never
[54:32] referred to two angels but the crowns
[54:34] and Thrones so forth pertain to human
[54:35] beings and these elders was crowned and
[54:37] clothed sitting on Thrones he said and
[54:40] we found them over other parts of the
[54:41] scripture that they were the Twelve
[54:42] Apostles and they were the twelve
[54:44] patriarchs 24 of them he said which
[54:48] means 24 12 apostles 12 patriarchs and
[54:51] when he says we found them over in other
[54:52] parts of the scripture those are the
[54:54] scriptures that I read to you is the
[54:55] ones brother branham lists in that
[54:57] message now brother Branham is asked ask
[55:02] another question about these and
[55:03] questions and answers on the seals and I
[55:06] love that the confidence that this gives
[55:08] me in the message of the hour because he
[55:12] gets the question wrong you've all heard
[55:16] it if you've listened to the tape but
[55:19] the band gets it wrong and the Holy
[55:21] Spirit correct see I love that because
[55:27] it gives us confidence because we know
[55:30] every word brother baron said it's not
[55:31] infallible we know that because he's a
[55:33] man if you make him infallible you make
[55:35] him God there's no other way around it
[55:37] but he's a man we know he's a man but we
[55:40] also know God protected the message of
[55:42] the hour hey Ben we know the angel was
[55:46] with him when he preached these men
[55:48] and so here he's answering the question
[55:51] and he says in Revelation verse five
[55:54] nine he said who were these found
[55:56] singing when the lamb takes the book and
[55:58] these are these the raptured Saints he
[55:59] says no he said no if you notice these
[56:02] are not the Saints he said he had never
[56:04] claimed his property yet this is not the
[56:07] Saints if you notice they're the elders
[56:09] and the beasts and they sing and brother
[56:12] Branham goes on to another explains a
[56:14] little bit he goes on to another
[56:15] question and he comes back to he said
[56:18] there's something wrong there's
[56:20] something wrong that's just all there is
[56:21] to it
[56:21] there's something that's happened it
[56:23] gives me courage as a preacher for the
[56:25] Helen but the Stuart it gives me courage
[56:26] because the thing well if I would say
[56:28] something that would be wrong the Holy
[56:30] Spirit could correct that he's big
[56:33] enough to do that when we still believe
[56:34] that tonight so now he said there's
[56:37] something wrong that's just all there is
[56:39] to it there's something has happened
[56:40] something went wrong somewhere he says
[56:42] everybody feeling all right he said
[56:44] there ain't no sicknesses or nothing and
[56:46] a brother in the congregation says read
[56:49] that ninth verse again in Revelation 5
[56:53] he said oh the question that I just
[56:56] answered now let's see said the right
[56:57] place and when he had open the book the
[56:59] four beasts of the four twenty elders
[57:00] fell down before the lamb now see some
[57:03] people think well you can never question
[57:04] anything that a prophet said but the
[57:07] Holy Spirit made him question right and
[57:11] now what he said he said now we need
[57:14] open the book the forward twenty elders
[57:15] and he reads it he said and they sang a
[57:17] new song that our worthy to take the
[57:18] book open the seals thereof that's as
[57:20] far as he read the first time he said
[57:23] here it is he said here it is I was
[57:25] wrong on that because they went on to
[57:27] say the how its redeemed us to God by
[57:29] that blood
[57:31] hey Ben so they couldn't be angelic
[57:34] beings couldn't be just throne room
[57:36] attendants right it had to stand for
[57:40] something had to stand for redeemed
[57:43] people the twelve patriarchs or twelve
[57:45] apostles and if brother Branham had said
[57:48] that then it would contradict what he
[57:49] had already taught on that you
[57:50] understand but he comes back and
[57:52] corrects it he says now he said now what
[57:55] do you think about that oh my said oh
[57:58] the presence of the Holy Ghost isn't
[57:59] here what is
[58:01] he said see I only read the first part
[58:03] of that verse now that's a dangerous
[58:05] thing to do to just read the first part
[58:07] of the verse that's where so many people
[58:09] get it wrong in there go to the message
[58:11] read the first part of a quote make a
[58:13] doctrine out of it you got to read the
[58:15] whole thing and when I preach you know I
[58:20] use a part of a quote I'll use a quote
[58:22] out of a quote I'll use a whole quote
[58:23] sometimes the whole paragraph but
[58:25] brother Branham didn't make the
[58:26] paragraphs we did that to try to make it
[58:28] readable you need to go back and listen
[58:31] to it or read it where you can
[58:32] understand it right Britta BAM didn't do
[58:35] the punctuation either you know we did
[58:38] that and I believe it's good it's the
[58:40] best that it could be but the Holy
[58:41] Spirit in you has to make you understand
[58:44] that thing or you never understand it
[58:46] and so he said only read the first part
[58:48] of the verse what the scripture says
[58:49] matters matters we've got to read all of
[58:54] it now our text in that vein as we look
[58:59] at the scripture mattering it matters it
[59:02] matters the word I'm doubting myself now
[59:06] it says in Revelations 5:8 since when he
[59:11] had taken the book the four beasts and
[59:12] the four and twenty elders fell down
[59:13] before the lamb having every one of them
[59:15] harps now this is a different detail
[59:18] that he adds remember they before they
[59:21] had they were on Thrones and white
[59:23] raiment had crowns on their head that
[59:25] told us who they were that told us who
[59:28] they were now this tells us what they do
[59:31] right they have harps this is the tools
[59:35] of their trade if we could put it that
[59:37] way golden vials full of odours which
[59:42] are the prayers of saints we look at
[59:43] odor as a bad thing it's a it's like
[59:45] perfumes or incense golden vials full of
[59:50] incense that word vial is actually more
[59:52] accurately bowls we'll get to that in a
[59:54] moment so the prayers of the saints I
[59:56] want you to notice first just as an
[59:57] aside that they had harps and that
[1:00:02] wouldn't be a harp like what we see
[1:00:03] today if you go to a big concert hall
[1:00:06] and you listen to a harpist harping or
[1:00:08] if that's what you call that
[1:00:11] harping with their harps I guess and I
[1:00:14] think that's in the scripture harping
[1:00:15] with their hearts but you know if you
[1:00:17] see them harping playing their heart
[1:00:19] that's not the kind of harp they would
[1:00:21] have what they had actually it's closer
[1:00:23] in the family musical family to a guitar
[1:00:25] well some people don't believe in
[1:00:27] guitars in church but but it's actually
[1:00:30] more close to that the kind of harps
[1:00:31] that they would have cuz they would play
[1:00:32] it with a pick it was like a lyre that
[1:00:35] would be played with a pick and would be
[1:00:36] played loudly we know that because what
[1:00:39] John sees is the temple instruments that
[1:00:41] David created he invented instruments
[1:00:43] for the worship in the temple who saw
[1:00:45] was 33 and - he said praise the Lord
[1:00:47] with the harp
[1:00:48] it's that same instrument praise the
[1:00:51] Lord with the harp sing unto him with
[1:00:52] the psaltery and an instrument of ten
[1:00:54] strings and we kind of make a play on
[1:00:57] words on that today and say you can clap
[1:00:58] if you can't do nothing else but they
[1:01:00] actually David invented an instrument
[1:01:02] with ten strings and so he said seeing
[1:01:06] to him a new song play skillfully with a
[1:01:09] loud noise I know you all like that you
[1:01:12] musicians play skillfully we like that
[1:01:17] too with a loud noise for the word of
[1:01:21] the Lord is right now watch why do you
[1:01:22] play why did they play because the word
[1:01:27] of the Lord is right all these works are
[1:01:30] done in truth we we don't rejoice and
[1:01:32] worship and play because of some some
[1:01:36] kind of a beat or something that we're
[1:01:37] getting into or some kind of thing but
[1:01:39] we're doing it because the word is true
[1:01:42] right so we rejoice that's why it's
[1:01:44] message people it's different for most
[1:01:46] denominations because our time of
[1:01:48] worship comes at the end of the service
[1:01:50] not so much at the beginning although
[1:01:51] it's a an atmosphere that we have to
[1:01:53] send but the David does a good job doing
[1:01:55] that but you have to set that atmosphere
[1:01:57] and then at the end then you can worship
[1:01:59] why you've heard the word you've been
[1:02:01] lost by the water of the word and what
[1:02:03] is that the word of the Lord is right
[1:02:04] you're acknowledging that the word of
[1:02:07] the Lord is right all this works are
[1:02:09] done in truth so they had harps and
[1:02:14] vials or bowls now the definition of
[1:02:18] that word is a broad shallow bowl a deep
[1:02:19] saucer would be kind of like a you've
[1:02:21] seen these offering plates that are
[1:02:24] wider than they
[1:02:25] our deep like a saucer a deep saucer or
[1:02:28] a wide bowl now they're containers they
[1:02:36] contain something there's something
[1:02:40] stored up now remember I told you that
[1:02:42] not all prayers get answered all at once
[1:02:45] right in these bowls John sees that they
[1:02:50] have the prayers of the Saints in these
[1:02:54] bowls now think spiritually now but this
[1:02:58] is what John sees to represent that he
[1:03:00] said this is the bowls that they have
[1:03:02] prayers that could not be answered at
[1:03:05] the time they were prayed but would be
[1:03:09] answered in his predestined time now
[1:03:15] many prayers have already been answered
[1:03:17] and I think we could we could shout all
[1:03:20] around the church if we could really
[1:03:21] begin to think of some things that God
[1:03:24] has done you look back in the scripture
[1:03:28] and you find out Hannah was praying one
[1:03:30] time in the temple crying out to God
[1:03:32] because of her adversary weeping she
[1:03:35] wept in the temple and her prayer was
[1:03:36] answered she had Samuel Moses one time
[1:03:41] prayed to God and he said god I want to
[1:03:42] see your glory and God showed him he
[1:03:46] said like the back part of a man but he
[1:03:47] showed him just because he he pray it
[1:03:51] was jay-bez so I love that character and
[1:03:53] the scripture just says a few words
[1:03:54] about him but he prayed to God and he
[1:03:56] said Lord enlarge my territory Lords my
[1:04:00] territory I want to I want to take all
[1:04:02] of my land I want to do everything that
[1:04:04] you've given me to do enlarge my
[1:04:06] territory in God the Bible says God
[1:04:08] granted him his request the prayer of
[1:04:12] David when he went for forgiveness God
[1:04:17] answered that prayer Oh see God still
[1:04:22] answers prayer but what I want to show
[1:04:26] you is that this is the time when all
[1:04:28] prayers get answered so not just the
[1:04:33] prayers that we have that were answered
[1:04:35] right away but the ones that have been
[1:04:36] stored up look
[1:04:39] the David when he wept for forgiveness
[1:04:42] Daniel he was in the lion's den after
[1:04:45] you--after he refused to obey the
[1:04:47] illegal order of the king not to pray he
[1:04:52] refused to obey it and when he did they
[1:04:54] threw him in the Lions pit and he prayed
[1:04:55] to God and an angel come a pillar of
[1:04:58] fire stood between him and the Lions the
[1:05:02] prayer of the persecuted church when the
[1:05:04] saints and ax4 gathered together and the
[1:05:06] house was shaken where they were had
[1:05:09] when I had an all-night prayer meeting
[1:05:11] that time at John Mark's house and as
[1:05:13] they had the prayer meeting the angel
[1:05:16] went down someone said that the angel
[1:05:18] fetched Peter out of the jail but prayer
[1:05:20] fetched the angel because they had an
[1:05:23] all-night prayer meeting down at the
[1:05:25] house and here come here come Peter
[1:05:27] stumbling up to the door said hey what
[1:05:30] was it an answer to prayer hey bad you
[1:05:35] don't think God could still do that
[1:05:36] today I know he can still do that today
[1:05:40] the prayer of Paul and Silas when they
[1:05:42] were in jail we talked about how they
[1:05:43] saying and it's amazing how they sing to
[1:05:46] God but the Bible says they prayed and
[1:05:48] they sang they read the prayer while
[1:05:52] they were in jail and God an earthquake
[1:05:54] shook the jail down I read a story of
[1:05:58] Robert Mueller the great the great
[1:06:01] preacher who had orphanages and he never
[1:06:04] had any money never had enough money to
[1:06:06] go around to feed the children and so
[1:06:09] one morning he had a relative of his
[1:06:12] visiting a young lady she was visiting
[1:06:15] him and and that morning they had no
[1:06:17] food at all to give the orphans and so
[1:06:20] Robert Mueller said took her by the hand
[1:06:22] he said let's go see what God will do
[1:06:25] he took her inside the the place they
[1:06:28] had all the tables set for all the
[1:06:30] orphans and no food and they sat down
[1:06:33] and Robert Mueller bowed his head and
[1:06:36] prayed to the Lord we give you thanks
[1:06:38] for the food we're about to receive you
[1:06:43] talk about faith we give you thanks for
[1:06:46] the food we're about to receive and when
[1:06:48] he did there come a knock on the door
[1:06:50] and a baker stood at the door
[1:06:52] said all night I couldn't sleep so I
[1:06:55] woke up at two o'clock in the morning
[1:06:56] and started baking bread for the
[1:06:58] children I couldn't think of anything
[1:06:59] else to do
[1:07:00] and so he'd come in and about the time
[1:07:03] the door had closed another knock come
[1:07:04] on the door and a milkman stood there
[1:07:07] and he said my my court broke down in
[1:07:09] front of the in front of the orphanage
[1:07:11] I'd like to give the orphans some milk
[1:07:14] God answers prayer I may have told you
[1:07:19] before but I remember a time when I was
[1:07:21] young and I didn't have no money I
[1:07:22] didn't know how to handle money and I
[1:07:24] was sixteen years old and I went to
[1:07:26] preach somewhere and I knew if the
[1:07:28] pastor gave me an offering if you give
[1:07:30] me a check I couldn't make it back home
[1:07:32] I was that poor I didn't have any money
[1:07:36] no credit cards no backup and all
[1:07:38] through that time I telling the brothers
[1:07:40] I never had to I never had to ask
[1:07:42] anybody for money
[1:07:44] God always blessed me and I'll never
[1:07:46] forget that there was a man just
[1:07:48] happened to show up at church
[1:07:49] I've seen him maybe five or six times in
[1:07:51] my life but he become my friend because
[1:07:54] of the things that happened I went and
[1:07:56] was able to pray with him before he
[1:07:57] passed away because he happened to be
[1:07:59] near where I lived at that time but a
[1:08:02] man showed up at church had never seen
[1:08:04] me before and he walked up to me as I'm
[1:08:07] leaving puts a hundred dollars in my
[1:08:08] pocket my front pocket which felt like a
[1:08:12] million dollars to me and I just went
[1:08:16] cuz I was just stupid enough to believe
[1:08:18] that God would do something for me oh my
[1:08:23] God has a way when there seems to be no
[1:08:25] way he still answers prayer
[1:08:27] he still responds to thanks they men
[1:08:32] there's prayers we could go back we can
[1:08:36] look at the prayers of saints church we
[1:08:38] don't understand how much that our
[1:08:41] church and us being here relies on the
[1:08:43] prayers of those who went on who prayed
[1:08:48] prayers in this church that that to keep
[1:08:50] a church here that there would be a
[1:08:52] place for the gospel to be preached and
[1:08:54] so we go through trials and tribulation
[1:08:56] you don't know that prayers may be
[1:08:58] prayed years ago and we're scored up
[1:09:00] until the moment that could they could
[1:09:01] be fulfilled and now all the sudden
[1:09:03] they're being fulfilled you can go back
[1:09:07] and think of saints that were prayer
[1:09:08] warrior says brother ruby you could go
[1:09:10] back and think of sister Browne
[1:09:11] different ones that are prayer warriors
[1:09:13] and and and stayed on their knees and
[1:09:15] you knew it and as they stayed on their
[1:09:17] knees the prayers of the saints were
[1:09:18] stored up and we're still benefiting
[1:09:20] from those prayers today we don't
[1:09:25] intercede with them now they're going on
[1:09:27] to their reward but while they were here
[1:09:29] they interceded for us oh my now but
[1:09:36] then there's been prayers that you've
[1:09:38] prayed and doesn't seem like there's
[1:09:41] been any answer and some of you talked
[1:09:44] to me about those things and and it
[1:09:47] seems like well there's just no no
[1:09:49] movement there's no answer but they're
[1:09:54] in the bowl understand they're in the
[1:09:57] bowl
[1:09:58] there's none lost whatever those bowls
[1:10:03] are they're big enough that they hold
[1:10:04] every prayer all the prayers of the
[1:10:07] Saints they're in the bowl now those
[1:10:15] prayers were stored up for a time for a
[1:10:18] time and the Bible tells us in Romans
[1:10:20] 8:22 that he said for we know that the
[1:10:22] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:10:24] in pain together until now he said not
[1:10:28] only they but ourselves also so not just
[1:10:30] sozin in the past not just the earth
[1:10:32] itself not just those people who live
[1:10:35] back there but ourselves who have the
[1:10:38] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:10:39] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:10:41] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:10:44] of our body see there's a prayer brother
[1:10:46] Ruby prayed that hasn't been answered
[1:10:48] yet that's a prayer for a resurrection
[1:10:52] right even though they have a body but
[1:10:54] there's a prayer for a resurrection
[1:10:56] there's a prayer to be gathered with
[1:10:58] loved ones a prayer for a rapture sister
[1:11:01] Brown prayed for that but a bride and
[1:11:02] prayed for that all these down do you
[1:11:04] can think about your own family and
[1:11:06] those that have went on and those that
[1:11:08] you knew were prayer warriors they
[1:11:09] prayed a prayer well a prayer
[1:11:11] has not happened yet maybe better but
[1:11:18] this is the hour when we can be
[1:11:21] confident excuse me when damage Sapulpa
[1:11:24] but this is the hour when we can be
[1:11:25] confident that our prayers will be
[1:11:27] answered now because here what did this
[1:11:36] what did it say go back to I don't have
[1:11:38] it right here but go back to Revelation
[1:11:40] chapter 5 what did he saying I keep
[1:11:43] reading and I kept reading it to myself
[1:11:45] today as we go back to revelations
[1:11:47] chapter 5 and verse 8 that when he had
[1:11:51] taken the book I just stopped there when
[1:11:57] did the elders fall down before the lamb
[1:12:00] and brother Branham tells us and we'll
[1:12:03] get to that in a moment that that's when
[1:12:04] the those prayers were poured out those
[1:12:08] bowls were empty and when did they fall
[1:12:12] down before the lamb they fell down when
[1:12:17] he had taken the book are you with me
[1:12:21] now he took the sealed book why he's
[1:12:25] going to open and he comes to take the
[1:12:27] book of brother Branham says he comes to
[1:12:29] claim his own hay bed now he comes forth
[1:12:34] in that he says in the breach to take
[1:12:36] his claims now
[1:12:37] oh my comes forth to take his claims now
[1:12:39] he had done the kinsman were he'd come
[1:12:41] down and become man and died he done the
[1:12:43] kids of an ork of redemption but it not
[1:12:46] his yet called for his claim now what I
[1:12:48] bear with me for just a moment I won't
[1:12:50] hold you much longer bear with me for
[1:12:52] just a moment hang with me because this
[1:12:54] I believe it's important if you just
[1:12:55] catch it that he's not yet it has yet
[1:12:59] called for his claim but now he comes on
[1:13:01] the scene to claim his rights hey Ben he
[1:13:06] said oh my for which he was famed for
[1:13:08] his becoming a kinsman to man to die in
[1:13:11] his place to redeem him but the elder
[1:13:14] was right when he saw it was a lion the
[1:13:16] other called him a lion because he had
[1:13:18] been a lamb and intercessor a bloody
[1:13:20] lamb but now I watched the picture that
[1:13:22] he's painting now he
[1:13:23] is coming forth as a lion they bet what
[1:13:30] time are we living in
[1:13:32] now well the Stewart he is coming forth
[1:13:35] as a lion his days of intercession is
[1:13:38] over when you see this what is it
[1:13:41] what is it all these things begin to
[1:13:43] take place angels fall down or rather
[1:13:46] the torch when the elders fall down at
[1:13:47] his feet and the four beasts fall down
[1:13:50] line because he's come to claim his
[1:13:52] rights and it's during that time when
[1:13:56] every prayer is answered I'm not trying
[1:13:59] to tell you something that's not there
[1:14:00] go back and lit and read and really
[1:14:02] study it out many prayers were answered
[1:14:06] in the days of his intercession but
[1:14:09] there were certain prayers and
[1:14:10] specifically those that said come Lord
[1:14:14] Jesus every bed they've been praying
[1:14:18] that ever since he left come Lord Jesus
[1:14:22] every saint that went down went down an
[1:14:24] expectation and prayer that that would
[1:14:26] happen and this is the time there were
[1:14:33] certain prayers that had to be stored up
[1:14:36] now the Bible says speaking of the Old
[1:14:38] Testament Saints these all died in faith
[1:14:40] not having received the promises but
[1:14:42] having seen them afar off were persuaded
[1:14:44] of them and embraced him and confessed
[1:14:46] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:14:47] the earth so you look at those four and
[1:14:49] twenty elders here were twelve who were
[1:14:52] represented by the twelve the twelve
[1:14:56] tribes of Israel and those twelve tribes
[1:14:59] were there and those twelve patriarchs
[1:15:01] were there they represent that that lost
[1:15:03] people that had already been gone and
[1:15:06] they went down believing that there
[1:15:09] would come a redeemer but they never saw
[1:15:12] it but they went down praying for it he
[1:15:17] told me prayer doesn't work and a
[1:15:19] redeemer came and so that's why he said
[1:15:23] that on one side Daniel sees him and he
[1:15:25] sees just the Ancient of Days sitting
[1:15:27] there and the Thrones were set but no
[1:15:28] one was in them but on this side here
[1:15:31] are the four and twenty elders with
[1:15:32] robes white raiment
[1:15:36] why a redeemer had come they couldn't
[1:15:40] have that there were deep Redemption
[1:15:42] here but we have it here they had to
[1:15:45] wait for it for him to come now look
[1:15:47] when all creation but the browser says
[1:15:50] was groaning no one knew what to do
[1:15:54] John was weeping here come the lamb
[1:15:57] walked over and this book was in the
[1:16:00] hands of the original owner because man
[1:16:02] had fell and lost it no man was able to
[1:16:05] take it anymore
[1:16:06] to redeem the earth no priest broke
[1:16:08] nothing as I said but the land come up
[1:16:10] no marry no say this for sake that the
[1:16:13] Lamb come up but he's saying took the
[1:16:15] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:16:16] said upon the throne see I will sit
[1:16:19] between you and the Lamb I don't mediate
[1:16:22] between you in the land you have a
[1:16:23] mediator you have a lamb I think
[1:16:29] sometimes we put people in between they
[1:16:30] need to get out of the way we need to
[1:16:32] place them out of the way
[1:16:33] they don't belong there pastor doesn't
[1:16:35] belong between you and the lamp a person
[1:16:38] not even a prophet belongs there only
[1:16:39] Christ
[1:16:40] it's the mediator between God and man
[1:16:42] but now look he said when they seen
[1:16:45] there was a redeemer all the souls under
[1:16:47] the altar altar when the angel from the
[1:16:49] elders when everything's seen it when
[1:16:50] this is done now watch when this is done
[1:16:53] and yet lays in the future tonight he's
[1:16:56] a mediator and I watched what he had
[1:16:58] said he's coming now
[1:17:00] tonight he's a mediator but he is coming
[1:17:03] to this he is coming to this watch and
[1:17:08] when he had taken the book the four
[1:17:09] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[1:17:11] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:17:14] one of them harps and golden vials full
[1:17:15] of odours which are the prayers of the
[1:17:16] saints he said that's those that's under
[1:17:19] the altar now but random is later it's
[1:17:23] revealed to him in the fifth seal that
[1:17:25] it's not the Jews under or it's not the
[1:17:27] one that are the altar in the fifth seal
[1:17:28] but it is those that have already gone
[1:17:30] on the ones that are the altar in the
[1:17:33] fifth seal is those Jews that were
[1:17:34] killed under hill or in Eichmann but he
[1:17:38] said that's so so it's under the altar
[1:17:40] that had prayed they'd been then I
[1:17:44] prayed you said my prayers don't matter
[1:17:46] here were those 24 owners that fell down
[1:17:49] before the lamb and they pray
[1:17:50] they had prayed long ago they they held
[1:17:54] the bowls of all the prayers of the
[1:17:55] Saints and they had prayed for now
[1:17:57] notice what they prayed for two things
[1:17:59] they pray for redemption and prayed for
[1:18:02] resurrection thank the Lord and the
[1:18:08] redemption had already been answered
[1:18:09] because he was already he is already a
[1:18:11] bloody lamb but now he's coming forward
[1:18:14] to take his Co make his claims and when
[1:18:16] he comes to make his claims what is he
[1:18:19] been he's not only coming for redemption
[1:18:22] but for resurrection this is the hour
[1:18:26] that we live in oh my and here these
[1:18:29] elders are pouring out their prayers
[1:18:31] because now he said we've got a
[1:18:33] representative amen they're pouring out
[1:18:38] their prayers because now thank the Lord
[1:18:41] we've got a representative we've got a
[1:18:43] kinsman in heaven that's come forth to
[1:18:46] make his claims
[1:18:47] oh my those hammers taken the book he's
[1:18:50] leaving mercy for judgment and during
[1:18:52] that time they poured out those prayers
[1:18:55] as he came as he took the boat and as he
[1:18:59] come forth to be changed from a lamb to
[1:19:01] a lion they poured out the prayers now
[1:19:08] the Jews under the fifth seal prayed
[1:19:10] remember they prayed they cried out to
[1:19:12] God well for for vengeance you go back
[1:19:18] and looking you go study this I'm not
[1:19:19] gonna preach all this because it's not
[1:19:20] mine did tonight but you go and study on
[1:19:22] the trumpets and these things and how
[1:19:24] that they prayed for those things that
[1:19:25] are coming they prayed for vengeance and
[1:19:28] that'll be there'll be a time when those
[1:19:30] prayers are answered because he said not
[1:19:33] not now it'd be a little while yet
[1:19:35] there'll be 144,000 come as well that
[1:19:39] have to die right there there some
[1:19:41] others coming but now these prayers will
[1:19:45] be answered so even the prayers of those
[1:19:46] who are given White Rose are answered if
[1:19:49] those prayers are answered of Jews who
[1:19:52] never never accepted Christ but died
[1:19:54] under Hitler indictment if that prayers
[1:19:58] answered for vengeance how much more is
[1:20:02] the prayer brother Dan evil redeemed
[1:20:04] a child of God but now this is the time
[1:20:12] for all prayers to be answered look it
[1:20:14] won't be very long and there won't be
[1:20:17] any prayer left prayed by a Christian to
[1:20:20] be answered there's coming a
[1:20:23] resurrection and a rapture
[1:20:25] that's that is our goal that's what
[1:20:28] we're coming to that's what we're even a
[1:20:29] part of its what's in us now we're
[1:20:32] coming to that place for the Stuart and
[1:20:34] so when we come to that place there's
[1:20:36] gonna be no prayer unfulfilled cuz
[1:20:41] little bowls will be poured out I thank
[1:20:44] God for His mercy thank God for His
[1:20:47] answer to prayer but now the prayers of
[1:20:51] the Jews are yet to come many things yet
[1:20:54] to come for the Jews but God is turning
[1:20:55] from the Gentile church before the bride
[1:20:57] our prayers will be answered now look he
[1:21:01] said well when does this happen well but
[1:21:03] the matter said what's happened on now
[1:21:04] sunset God confirming his word now you
[1:21:07] can either believe this or not but it's
[1:21:09] what a prophet of God told us he said
[1:21:11] that's what all this noise is about
[1:21:12] notice it's God fulfilling his promise
[1:21:15] word again of revelation 10 1 2 7 and in
[1:21:18] the days of the sounding of the seventh
[1:21:20] angels message the mystery of God should
[1:21:22] be finished what did he do but the
[1:21:28] revelation 10 1 2 7 one foot on the land
[1:21:30] one foot on the earth and one foot on
[1:21:32] the sea one foot on the earth and he
[1:21:33] said time will be no more he said
[1:21:35] there'll be no more today now think
[1:21:37] about that in a different way than you
[1:21:38] thought about it before there's no more
[1:21:40] delay to the answer of prayers baby bed
[1:21:46] this is the hour when where things are
[1:21:49] speeding up then what should we expect
[1:21:53] today we should expect God to keep his
[1:21:56] word if he if he kept his word for
[1:21:59] Robert Mueller if he kept his word for
[1:22:02] for Paul and Silas if he kept his word
[1:22:04] for in the book of Acts if he kept his
[1:22:07] word when Jesus himself prayed that not
[1:22:09] my will but thine be done
[1:22:10] if he kept his word to be answered
[1:22:11] prayer what about today when we're
[1:22:16] living at the very end
[1:22:17] when the fulfillment of these sayings is
[1:22:19] coming to pass listen brother branham
[1:22:22] said the hidden mystery of revelation
[1:22:24] ten one two seven the last message to
[1:22:26] the last Church ages fulfills exactly in
[1:22:29] this age the day when the Son of man
[1:22:31] shall be revealed and he goes on down
[1:22:35] you'll find there's a couple paragraphs
[1:22:36] in between this but in paragraph 152 if
[1:22:39] you go study it he said the God of
[1:22:41] heaven promised the evening time would
[1:22:43] have evening lights three years ago this
[1:22:46] mystery was a prophecy what time is it
[1:22:48] sir but now it's history what did he
[1:22:51] preaching what time is it sir
[1:22:53] an angel had come down revelation ten
[1:22:55] one two seven he said it was a mist it
[1:22:57] was a prophecy now it's history he said
[1:23:00] but now it's history it's past the
[1:23:02] promises fulfilled what time is it sir
[1:23:04] what's this attraction God fulfilling
[1:23:06] his word what's he doing he's answering
[1:23:09] prayer today yes he is no the angel
[1:23:17] swore and he goes on he said what's this
[1:23:21] attraction he says God fulfilling his
[1:23:24] word he's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:26] forever now as we said the angels where
[1:23:28] there would be no more delay this is the
[1:23:31] hour of answered prayers we prayed for a
[1:23:32] rapture we prayed for a change of body
[1:23:37] and there may be some here god forbid
[1:23:40] but there may be something would go by
[1:23:41] way of the grave and that prayer be
[1:23:44] stirred up in that bowl but this is the
[1:23:45] hour it happens during this time are you
[1:23:51] with me now God stores those prayers
[1:23:54] that happens during this time when the
[1:23:57] bride says come what bride is that not
[1:23:59] just the living right on the earth but
[1:24:01] the bride down to the history cries oh
[1:24:04] come quickly
[1:24:07] amen and it couldn't be revealed to them
[1:24:10] because they had to feel it like it was
[1:24:12] right there and they felt like he was
[1:24:13] coming with a JC right there and Paul
[1:24:15] said Paul felt like he was coming just
[1:24:16] around the corner but this was the end
[1:24:18] time it was but 2000 years later here we
[1:24:23] stand again and we look at it as the end
[1:24:25] times and it is but now we're not
[1:24:28] looking at it from the front but we've
[1:24:30] turned around
[1:24:31] we're looking not at prophecy expected
[1:24:33] but prophecy fulfilled just like brother
[1:24:37] Ram could turn around in in is this what
[1:24:40] is the attraction on the mountain he
[1:24:42] could turn around and look and see not
[1:24:44] just prophecy like he could when he
[1:24:46] preached the sermon what time is it sir
[1:24:48] wasn't a question anymore but he
[1:24:49] answered the question what time is it
[1:24:53] sir was a question but what is his
[1:24:55] attraction on the mountain he said it's
[1:24:56] fulfilled
[1:24:57] the prayers been answered the questions
[1:25:00] been answered
[1:25:01] God fulfilling his word so the bowls if
[1:25:06] you're going in Revelation 16 you'll
[1:25:09] find those bowls of judgment that are
[1:25:11] ready to be poured out vials of
[1:25:13] judgments and that's the prayer of those
[1:25:18] under the altar it's about to be
[1:25:19] answered also under the seven trumpets
[1:25:21] and that's not our gospel is not where
[1:25:23] we preach to the Jews but the prayers of
[1:25:26] the saints
[1:25:27] a lot of answer it under the trumpets or
[1:25:29] under the under the vials they're
[1:25:32] answered under the Seventh Seal don't
[1:25:37] read revelations 8:1 and then read I
[1:25:38] challenge you read revelation 8 1 and
[1:25:40] then read verses eight three through six
[1:25:43] what does it talk about answered prayers
[1:25:46] an angel with prayers and incense and
[1:25:51] the golden altar I'm not trying to make
[1:25:53] something out of it it's not but what is
[1:25:54] it this is the time if there ever was a
[1:25:58] time to pray and to believe that your
[1:26:01] prayers would be answered it's this day
[1:26:03] do we believe that tonight we have seen
[1:26:05] God fulfill his word the book has been
[1:26:07] open and in that hour in this hour as he
[1:26:10] makes his claims hey man how do you know
[1:26:13] he'd come to make his claims because he
[1:26:15] come and made his claim with me he come
[1:26:17] and made his claim with you you see your
[1:26:19] identity in the message of the hour as
[1:26:20] he makes his claims what happens it
[1:26:23] shows you the book has been open and in
[1:26:25] that hour those bowls are poured out
[1:26:31] read it again when he had taken the book
[1:26:34] when he had taken the book the four
[1:26:37] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[1:26:39] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:26:42] one of them harps and golden vials for
[1:26:45] voters which are the prayers of saints
[1:26:49] there is coming a day when the prayers
[1:26:53] of the Jews enter the altar will be
[1:26:54] poured out I'm living in the fulfillment
[1:26:57] of the Gentile age he's making his
[1:27:00] claims
[1:27:01] what is our prayer today our prayers
[1:27:04] come quickly and we're gonna see it
[1:27:07] answered you see what time you living in
[1:27:12] then anything is possible
[1:27:15] anything is possible what did but the
[1:27:17] Browns show had he right under the third
[1:27:19] pole that he or she had prayed maybe all
[1:27:23] all them boys life she'd prayed they'd
[1:27:25] be saved but under the identification of
[1:27:30] the spoken word in the third pole what
[1:27:32] her brother Brown said you can have them
[1:27:34] hey Ben you can have the desire of your
[1:27:38] heart
[1:27:38] listen there's things that we've been
[1:27:39] praying for for a long time but we're
[1:27:41] coming to the hour we're at the hour
[1:27:43] were in the hour when we can have them
[1:27:46] that if we've ever prayed we should pray
[1:27:49] more if we've ever believed it those
[1:27:51] Saints back there believed and then saw
[1:27:53] all the things that they saw how much
[1:27:55] more should we see today but the devil
[1:27:58] fights your prayer life he fights you he
[1:28:00] tries to make you cold he tries to make
[1:28:02] you where you have no time for prayer he
[1:28:04] tries to fill it up with everything else
[1:28:06] why because he wants to make sure
[1:28:08] because he knows the prayers were about
[1:28:10] to be answered he wants to keep you from
[1:28:12] praying to the Jaypee because he knows
[1:28:14] that his time is short prayers are about
[1:28:18] to be answered now is the time to let
[1:28:20] him make his claims and believe that my
[1:28:23] prayers will be answered
[1:28:24] very soon musicians come could we stand
[1:28:27] together see that wasn't too difficult
[1:28:35] you believe your prayers what we mean
[1:28:37] will be answered every one of them not
[1:28:42] one is lost are stored up and you could
[1:28:45] think maybe it's something simple in
[1:28:47] your own life but you've been praying
[1:28:48] about it and it's just stored up for a
[1:28:50] while it's there but it's stored up
[1:28:53] God's gonna answer it at the predestined
[1:28:56] time there's coming in answer
[1:28:58] to prayer what should we be praying for
[1:29:01] that as we get as we see what how are we
[1:29:04] live in what time it is we can look and
[1:29:06] we can see that in this hour we should
[1:29:09] be praying more and more Lord come
[1:29:11] quickly because that's ultimately the
[1:29:14] final prayer for the Gentile church to
[1:29:17] be answered come quickly Lord hey man do
[1:29:21] you believe he's gonna do it hey man bow
[1:29:24] your heads together with me I apologize
[1:29:27] if I've confused you I didn't mean to do
[1:29:29] that but you go back and study it go
[1:29:31] back and study and you'll find out that
[1:29:32] God will answer your prayer today what
[1:29:35] is it that you have in your heart maybe
[1:29:37] you're holding something that you've
[1:29:38] been praying about for a long time I
[1:29:40] pray tonight that you would take comfort
[1:29:42] in knowing that God answers prayer
[1:29:44] Heavenly Father we hold these things
[1:29:47] before you today we keep these things in
[1:29:51] in our hearts Lord but like Daniel he
[1:29:54] prayed for all those days and then you
[1:29:57] said Lord that you heard him on the
[1:29:59] first day Lord you heard us the very
[1:30:04] first time that we prayed for our
[1:30:05] children
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:07] very first time we pray we come to the
[1:30:13] message of the hour and all of a sudden
[1:30:14] we begin to pray and call out to God and
[1:30:16] we thought Lord come quickly getting
[1:30:20] tired of the bad news getting tired or
[1:30:26] dealing with the things I have to deal
[1:30:28] with every day lord I want you to come
[1:30:30] getting tired of fighting the devil lord
[1:30:32] it's time I feel like it's time we don't
[1:30:35] control that the prayer is the very
[1:30:38] first time that you prayed it is stored
[1:30:40] up this is the hour when the bowls are
[1:30:44] poured out the vials are poured out this
[1:30:47] is the hour when you can get what you
[1:30:48] ask for
[1:30:50] if we could just believe that but Satan
[1:30:53] would try to take you away from that and
[1:30:55] say well I I just my prayers are
[1:30:57] ineffective
[1:30:58] maybe you feel lesser than a previous
[1:31:00] generation because you don't pray as
[1:31:02] much and you don't maybe cry as much you
[1:31:05] don't shout as much but that's not what
[1:31:07] it's about a prayer like Moses is just
[1:31:11] said Lord show me your glory God showed
[1:31:14] it to him you say Lord give me my
[1:31:17] children Caleb said give me my Mountain
[1:31:21] hey Brett let it be a prayer that goes
[1:31:24] up to God and may you be like that that
[1:31:27] woman in Memphis when she said I believe
[1:31:30] Lord that I'm the shooter my woman if
[1:31:33] I'm the shooter my woman there's got to
[1:31:35] be an Elisha somewhere hey bet be
[1:31:38] sincere in your prayers Lord I believe
[1:31:41] you're gonna do what you promised you
[1:31:43] would do this is the end time when all
[1:31:46] of those prayers are stored up those
[1:31:48] prayers will be answered
[1:31:49] pray pray more you know when you don't
[1:31:54] pray enough every time every time you
[1:31:58] get the opportunity pray when we get the
[1:32:01] opportunity as a church we should pray
[1:32:03] every time we have a chance we should
[1:32:06] pray why because this is the hour when
[1:32:08] prayers are answered
[1:32:10] don't look back with bitterness and say
[1:32:12] well I I prayed for something years ago
[1:32:14] and it's never been never really
[1:32:16] happened like I thought it would store
[1:32:18] it up it's there maybe won't be answered
[1:32:21] in the way that you thought it would
[1:32:23] just like they prayed Paul prayed Lord
[1:32:26] come in my generation the prayer was
[1:32:29] stored up but it wasn't in his
[1:32:30] generation being ours I believe that he
[1:32:34] believed it would be in his we believe
[1:32:35] it will be in ours but now we're looking
[1:32:37] backward we're seeing the fulfillment of
[1:32:40] prophecy let that be your prayer tonight
[1:32:41] Lord come quickly Lord I've got family
[1:32:45] I've got friends that are in need lord I
[1:32:49] I see it I see the ones that are out of
[1:32:53] the Ark of safety Lord answer my prayer
[1:32:56] today I believe you're a prayer
[1:32:57] answering God if I'll speak it it'll
[1:33:00] happen Heavenly Father or we lift our
[1:33:03] prayers to you today all right it
[1:33:05] doesn't have to be a great thing doesn't
[1:33:07] have to be loud hearted something that's
[1:33:10] sincere from our heart something that
[1:33:14] comes from deep down within Lord our
[1:33:16] heart speaks something groaning inside
[1:33:19] of us we crawled Lord waiting we haven't
[1:33:22] seen a new body yet we haven't seen that
[1:33:25] so we pray where summers went by way of
[1:33:28] the grave there's some who come but Lord
[1:33:30] that the fullness of their prayers has
[1:33:32] not yet been meant because there will
[1:33:34] come a time when we're caught up
[1:33:35] together to meet them to meet you in the
[1:33:39] air Oh Lord I pray that you would answer
[1:33:42] every prayer tonight
[1:33:45] Lord if it's just a whispered for hair
[1:33:47] if it's tear rolling down a cheek if
[1:33:49] it's just a moment Lord do we spend
[1:33:52] maybe this morning just standing at the
[1:33:55] dishes or standing making breakfast the
[1:33:58] sister began to pray and as she began to
[1:34:00] pray a dear old energy field Lord Lord
[1:34:04] take care of my children today take care
[1:34:05] of my family or you can answer that
[1:34:07] prayer this is the hour of answered
[1:34:10] prayers help us to believe it Lord we
[1:34:12] thank you for it thank you for all that
[1:34:14] you do for us as a church we don't
[1:34:16] deserve it Lord
[1:34:17] we're unworthy Lord we can fall down
[1:34:21] like the four and twenty elders did we
[1:34:25] could fall down we could say worthy is
[1:34:28] the Lamb who was slain whose redeemed us
[1:34:31] by your blood who's made us to be kings
[1:34:34] and priests to reign on the earth we're
[1:34:37] so grateful heart we can fall down at
[1:34:40] your at your feet
[1:34:41] say you're worthy we're not worthy it's
[1:34:45] you're worthy answered our prayers thank
[1:34:49] you for it hard I pray that somehow or
[1:34:52] does it's giving me encouragement but
[1:34:53] I'm a poor vessel to the Lord to convey
[1:34:56] that on but I pray your Holy Spirit
[1:34:58] would go down to each heart father and
[1:35:01] that they would be encouraged and know
[1:35:03] you answered their prayer and if father
[1:35:06] we pray in Jesus name
[1:35:09] let's just worship him for a moment
[1:35:11] before we go thank you lord
[1:35:25] thank you lord
[1:35:32] me
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:41] Oh
