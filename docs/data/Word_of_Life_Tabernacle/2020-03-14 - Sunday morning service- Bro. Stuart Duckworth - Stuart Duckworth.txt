wasn't gonna say 22 i was going to say 40. and then i hope i look that good when i'm 40. you know appreciate our brother there and just uh just love him if we could let's just turn in the scriptures this morning to first timothy 2 and 5. first timothy two and five for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time amen let's just buy our hearts before him and just if you'd have a need to slip that up to him amen he's an on-time god he knows your heart he knows your desire he knows why you're here today and amen i believe that he can come on the scene let's just go to him lord we love you you know we just approach you lord and lord in worship and praise this morning lord and you're the all-sufficient god your lord your everything that we could ever have need of lord and we just approach you in that way and lord just ask that you would bless your word bless it to your people lord may i just yield myself to you lord and may the service just go exactly how you want it to go lord and lord we just all here is a collective body we just yield our lives to you lord and may you just anoint us all to be able to hear and to be able to receive from your word today we love you and thank you in jesus name we ask amen you can be seated this morning amen for there is one mediator between god and man jesus christ amen he's there before the father i believe this morning i mean he's there before the father as a mediator to bring up a restoration between god and man amen to bring a restoration of that relationship and fellowship that man had before the fall i mean he's there at the throne of mercy with his body and the blood amen as a sacrifice for you and i do you believe that this morning amen he's on the throne and then he's in control here today and then he's at that at that throne amen until every name that is in the lamb's book of life has been redeemed there there he will be as a mediator as an intercessor for you and i amen to to bring that relationship to god and man to his waiver children amen to for that relationship to be restored amen before the fall god would come down in the cool of the evening and and they would worship god and have perfect fellowship a minute god longs for our fellowship i mean that's why he created man amen so that he could have someone to fellowship with amen amen someone that would worship him as his children and i believe that the voice of the lord god is still crying amen to his way with children amen where art thou and then he's still there as mediator still upon the throne of man calling out him in the voice of the lord god and the prophet said he said in the church age book he said if i can accomplish one thing i will be satisfied amen to see a true see established a true spiritual relationship between god and man where people become new creations filled with the spirit amen and live according to his word amen that's what we've been called to in this day and hour amen not just to be a bunch of church goers or just to say that we believe the message amen but to live according to the word amen that god has provided us a message amen to restore us a messenger and a message to restore us back to the word amen that we can we can come to the new birth we can come aim unto the indwelling of the spirit of god amen something that would bring us amen past denominations pass man's idea back to the word back to what they had at pentecost amen whereas people can live according to his word where we can live victorious lives in this last days in laodicea amen so that was the desire of the prophet amen to see a true relationship amen established amen not he said not to for to ever think that i would want people to follow me or or come to my church or or that she would start a fellowship but i want he wanted to see that that relationship that true spiritual relationship established amen amen and he said hear his voice in this hour amen and yield completely to him that was the call of the messenger to hear the voice of the word to hear the voice of the spirit and to completely yield to him not to bring people to himself or to his church but to bring him to the word where the real change can take place amen amen to bring them to christ amen not just to get people to a church or an idea but to bring them to christ to a living god and there is one mediator as we read and we'll just look at at this word just for a moment and that word mediator is a person who attempts to make people involved in a conflict come to an agreement a go-between amenity is our goal between this morning he is our negotiator he is able to make a way amen and he stands between us and our troubles and and the things that come against us amen he's able to make a way this morning amen he's able as mediator amen if for a sinner someone that's lost someone that's wondering amen and the voice of the lord god would call to them he's there as a mediator to bring you into the fold even to bring you to god it also means that that word mediator means another word for that would be arbiter a person who settles a dispute who has ultimate authority in the matter amen he sits this morning as mediator he sits this morning as arbiter he's got all authority in every matter amen he's been given all authority and power in heaven and earth amen he is our absolute amen an absolute is perfect within itself amen amen it is unlimited in power that's who our lord is this morning amen he is perfect within himself and he is unlimited in what he can do amen and god can do anything this morning but he cannot fail and then he cannot lie amen god can do many things but he cannot do that and then he's there's mediator to intervene amen and that word is to come between as to as to prevent or alter a result or course of events and then he's able to change the situation amen he is able to make a difference and he himself makes the difference amen when he comes on the scene and he's able to change the situation amen because he is god because he is our mediator he is our intercessor the one amen that we can go to by prayer that we can talk to amen that we can interact with amen not just some dead person that's gone on amen as catholicism will portray amen some dead being a man but he's a living god amen he's someone that can hear your voice he can hear you when you speak amen amen and when you begin to speak that's when god amen our intercessor jesus christ can act on our behalf amen so the scripture says he gave himself for a ransom amen and that word ransom is what is given in exchange for another as a prize of his redemption and then he gave himself a ransom and then he purchased our redemption with his own life and then he gave him himself in exchange for me and then he took my place amen and he was able to pay that price of redemption i want to say this morning amen you're worth more than fourteen hundred dollars and then you're worth more than just some some what the world says about you amen but we are purchased amen with the blood of jesus and we are purchased with his own blood this morning amen he paid that price of redemption he cared enough about you and he gave his own life amen he has redeemed us from the hand of the enemy amen the devil got a hold of your life amen brother and said the devil puts you in the pawn shop amen but jesus paid the price to get you out amen don't go back in the pawnshop this morning and try to serve the devil and get caught up in the things of the world amen let's live for the one amen that gave us life amen they redeemed us from the hand of the enemy amen that was able to pay that price and get us out of the devil's spawn shop let's give our all to him amen because he's worthy amen worthy is the lamb of god that was slain amen so jesus paid the price amen and purchased you with his own blood and i believe that's who i'm speaking to this morning amen we are the purchased possession amen you've been purchased by the very blood of jesus amen satan had a plot amen for your life but jesus has plans for your life today amen we are not our own but we are his amen and he he has made a way for us to him by his blood god will only meet us the worshipers through his blood for that is god's provided way of fellowship amen back to the blood amen man amen when man failed he crossed he crossed that chasm where he fell out of that relationship with that fellowship with almighty god with the creator amen but god amen made a way through the blood he made a way amen to the through the lamb through the innocent one and then he's made a way for us this morning we can come to god we can approach god amen whatever you have need of amen you don't have to feel like you're not worthy none of us are worthy but he was worthy amen and we can approach his throne this morning amen through the blood of an innocent one the lamb of god amen and we must by faith identify ourselves with that sacrifice we must identify ourselves with the blood with jesus christ and when you do that he identifies his life in you amen and when you identify with him you become connected amen in his life becomes your own amen it becomes a part of you becomes who you are so we can approach god romans 5 and 1 says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god amen we've got access this morning amen we've been justified amen not by our own works but by the blood of jesus christ amen and we can come to god we can approach god amen we've been accepted in the beloved by his grace and now we can stand in his grace we can rejoice in the grace of god amen that we've been accepted that we can come to him that we can live for him so jesus the great high priest hebrews 4 and 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need amen there he stands the great mediator there he stands in his position amen there he us passed into the heavens on the throne of grace that we might obtain that we might have access to his mercy that we might have access to the grace of god amen that we might have access to help in a time of need amen and we're a needy people here this morning we've all got needs we've all got things in our life amen amen and we can come and we can obtain that which we have need of there he stands in his position there he is as our mediator as our intercessor amen our great high priest the lord jesus there he is in his position him left lifted up above the corruption of this world amen as victor as the captain of our salvation of our deliverance there he is in his position this morning emin and he wants us to come to him and he's there on the throne bidding us to come ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ amen so heavenly places we know these things are there they're common to us but the heavenly places that's a the believer's position in christ where the believer stands in christ amen and that's where the blessings are this morning amen if you need joy amen you can go then this morning because there's fullness of joy amen there's fullness of power amen it's eternal power it's eternal life amen amen that's where the blessings are for the children of god amen but we've got to lift ourselves up above this corruption the corruption of this life amen we've got to get caught up this morning and then we've got to get caught up in what he said and what he showed us amen and leave these old things behind leave this whole world behind leave your thoughts behind your conception of how how you think things should be amen let's get called up this morning let's get caught up in his word amen where we can receive joy or we can be filled with the spirit amen let's get caught up this morning amen we are not an earth-bound people amen but we've been caught up amen our people amen are people that have been quickened amen our lives have been changed by his power we've been made alive we've been made partakers of the heavenly calling amen and we have a faithful high priest this morning that has passed into the heavens and brother branham says here in the revelation of jesus christ we just want to go through these things for a little bit he said on earth he was the prophet in glory he's the priest coming he's the king oh i like that prophet faithful witness of the word priest with his own blood before god and king king of saints not king of the world now he's king of the of saints and we have earthly kings over them people but we have a king too in the kingdom and that's the reason that we act different amen so he comes as prophet priests and king he comes as son of man son of god and the coming son of david he said i am he that was which is and shall come amen he's everything that you could have needed of this morning and then he's come in jesus christ and he's expressed his attributes and he's expressed himself to his people so his prophet as brother branham said he was the faithful witness to the word and in the beginning the bible says was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us jesus christ becoming the word amen amen in that son of man ministry amen in that form there he reveals himself to his church he makes himself known to his church to his elect to those that can receive him he makes himself known amen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that god was he that he dwelt in in jesus the fullness of god dwelt in him and god expressing his attributes through his son it was god making himself man amen that he could reveal and express himself to his people in all that god was he expressed in christ god's attributes being revealed being expressed in the son of man in the word amen and the word is still expressing itself to you and i am in the revealing of the word it's the same jesus christ he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the same god amen it's the same god same yesterday today and forever so here comes the son of man amen his prophet and he comes as priest and as priest he took his own blood and went before the father that's where he is this morning there amen with his own blood with that body amen before god amen the lamb of god there with his blood atoning and interceding on our behalf see god required a sacrifice for our sins for us to be able to come to full redemption and when the blood of bulls and goats would only cover the one who brought it until god's own blood would be shed amen and i believe this morning that there's power in the blood amen i believe that that's where the life is this morning and then it's not in our man-made ideology and the things that we can come up with amen but there's a religion this morning amen there's a blood religion amen there's a holy ghost gospel and it'll change a person it'll make you act different it'll make you talk different it'll make you believe the word it'll make you come to the word it's the power of god i mean there's power in the blood this morning amen in the blood has a voice amen in the blood of jesus the bible says speaks of better things than that of abel amen this morning it speaks of resurrection it speaks of life amen it speaks of healing it speaks of joy this morning it speaks of power amen it speaks of life it speaks of greater things than the things of this earth the things of this life amen there's something greater amen in the blood has a voice this morning and it is his word the life is in the blood the holy ghost itself amen on calvary amen when that blood cell was broken in and it released the life of the blood in that blood that life is the holy ghost it's the literal life of jesus christ and by the shedding of the blood that has come back upon the believer do you believe that this morning amen i believe with all my heart there's power in the blood so there there the priest sits before the father there this morning on the throne with his own blood with his body with that sacrifice there he sits this morning amen as priest amen god's own blood brought forth a redeemer to bring a full remission of sin amen our blood so powerful that they could destroy see him and regenerate and make his children new creatures amen it's a bleach blood and it eliminates your sin and destroys the sin nature in man amen brother brown said the blood amen when you confess that amen that blood bleach when you confess that your sin actually goes back upon the accuser and then you don't have to walk with those things you don't have to worry about it amen but when you come and confess it amen it is put back on the accuser it's put back on the accuser of the brethren and we don't have to walk with that because it's put back on him it's it's his decay it's not yours to carry it's his to carry until the judgment amen that puts it back on the accuser until judgment day amen he's got his day coming amen so prophet priests and he comes also as king amen is the king of heaven he's the king of saints and we are his subjects that's why we act different that's why we talk different amen we are not of this world and remember we've been born of another kingdom amen and that kingdom reigns within our heart amen amen in our heart and our lives testify that there's a coming king amen that that king rules in my life that his word rules in my life amen that he has leadership that he has control amen in that king he brings a power amen he brings a victory in my life just as king david amen the coming king they knew that he was coming king and when they followed after david amen because david had the anointing amen and that's why we follow after the word of the lord in this hour and then because the anointing is there because it's what we had need of amen then we follow after that amen and that's where the victory lies this morning is following after his word and staying with jesus christ our david the son of david that's where the victory lies this morning the victory with our king amen and we are his subjects and then we've been called to act different amen to live different amen to hold the standard of the word amen we're called to something greater than just what this world has to offer we are of another kingdom do you believe that this morning imminently rules on the throne of our hearts and we have access to our kingdom so he rules in our hearts but we know he's the coming king that's why we follow after him amen is the coming king this morning amen and when the battle is over melchizedek the lord jesus our priest king is going to serve us communion amen and i want to say this morning that we're not to that place yet amen we're still in a battle and then we still got to go after lot we still got to go after our loved ones amen and go back and get them and man we've got to arm ourselves we got to take up arms we got to pursue after them and then when abraham returned from the slaughter of the kings their melchizedek met him and he served him red and white amen of communion and brother bill said that's a top when the battle is over here amen we'll meet him in the wedding supper our meals our melchizedek our lord jesus christ and we'll have communion with him amen when this world is going on in chaos when the tribulation set in will be tucked away safe in the arms of jesus he's the coming king amen so he's coming into power he's the coming king he's prophet priest and king so he come as man amen he came he came and god became man amen and god became man and he became me that i might become him by grace he became a partaker as the bible says in hebrews 2 and 14 it says for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them through fear of death who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for fairly he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham and wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and high priest in the things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure those them that are tempted amen so god became man and man he took not on him the nature of angels and man god didn't just come down and poof into a body and we know that god is able to do that but god came the same way jesus came the same way you did amen through a birth he came amen through a spoken word birth we know these things but he came amen he came as a baby he came as a child he came as a young adult he came as a man and meant to be partakers of this life of the life that you and i live amen so he himself came to be partaker of this same life the same life that we live this humanity this humanity brother brahman said in one spot he came and humiliated himself god became man so that he could know how you feel to know to know how how how it would be to go through the things of this life i mean he knows what it's like to be sick he knows what it's it's like to have trouble and nobody came it came amen and he was victorious he came that he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil he came that he might to overcome he came that he might destroy the devil himself the mighty conqueror he came and overcame for you and i amen to bring a deliverance so he laid down his life he gave his own life amen he became a partaker so that we we could be partakers of him this morning amen that's why he came that's why he came that we could be partakers of him amen that he could bridge the gap amen that he could bridge the gap amen and we could have someone amen a human sacrifice amen a human amen because the nature of an animal couldn't come back upon the believer those that made that sacrifice amen but when we had a kinsmen redeemer one like a swan that came and lived amen he came and had troubles he came and had sickness he came and had all these things that we go through amen and then he came and overcame and he gave us life amen and then that life can come back upon you and i am and we can become partakers a man of that divine nature amen we can become partakers of eternal life of eternal joy this morning amen he did that for you and i amen he was made like unto you and i that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and the things pertaining to god and to bring a reconciliation amen and he abides now as our great high priest amen he who has overcome he amen amen who conquered everything for you and i you believed that this morning ephesians 4 8. catch my breath here ephesians 4 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen so jesus overcame he he was a partaker of this life amen but he came as a man amen but he overcame and he ascended amen but what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth and he that descended as the same that also ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things amen so he was raised for our justification amen he conquered death he he the same one that ascended descended so he he overcame death hell and the grave and then he overcame everything and then he stands this morning as a mighty conqueror and brother brahm said he conquered both worlds of the scene and the unseen eminently led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men he ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things and then he ascended amen that he might feel all things i think that's beautiful that he might come amen and fill my life that he might come and fill your life and then he ascended amen but he didn't just stay there amen but he sent back the holy ghost i mean him to bring the power of god upon his people amen to anoint his church and and to set in his church gifts to represent him to the people amen so he came amen he came to anoint his people amen i believe this morning he's looking for someone that he can anoint he

amen we've got to stay with the word amen if you leave the word he'll leave you amen but if we'll say with the word amen if we'll welcome the word if we if we'll receive the word amen he'll come among us and in his presence his fullness amen and he's come amen in the fullness of the word of this hour and i believe his spirit is here in its fullness amen to pour itself out upon the church he's here he's here hey man he's here this morning amen do you believe that and brother branham says here in the mighty conqueror he said and if this bible said that he has risen from the dead that he is the same yesterday today and forever then he's got to be the same in resurrection got to be the same in power he's got to be the same in principle he's got to be the same in every way except a corporal body this body the corporal body of his of his is sitting at the right hand of almighty god and glory do you believe that he's sitting at the right hand of god almighty in glory making the intercession amen so he's the same yesterday today and forever amen brother brown said he's the same in resurrection he's got to be the same in resurrection amen i believe this morning that he's still able to raise the debt amen he's got the quickening power and then he's sent to quickening power and then he's able to take those that are dead and sins and trespasses and then he's able to make you alive unto jesus alive under god he's able to quicken your life by his spirit this morning and i believe i'm preaching to people that have been quickened amen our lives have been quickened to the word amen we're walking in the quickening power amen in one day one day amen that quickening power amen these old bodies will be changed they'll be quick quickened amen and our bodies will be changed and we'll have a body like his own glorious body it'll quicken these mortal bodies so this mortal will put on immortality this corruption will put on incorruption by that quickening power amen and i believe he's here this morning to make us alive amen to give us power and in that quickening power able to bring life to that which is dead amen and bring a full resurrection of life brother branham says he's the same in principle and his word is still true he still makes good on his word and god is obligated to his word amen god is obligated this morning he's the same in principle amen his works are the same and then he's still a healer you believe that this morning he's still a deliverer he's still a savior and how do we know that amen we don't we don't just talk about it we've experienced it we know about it we know that god's a healer we know amen amen the condition that we were in how bound we were amen we can all go back and we can look at the condition that where we're in amen but god come on the scene because he's the same yesterday today and forever and then he wanted to express himself to you and that he wanted to bring us power in your life amen to be your deliverer and to break those chains to break you from those bonds who's still a deliverer this morning amen his attitude is the same if you come on the basis of his word and approach god and in the correct way god's got to move on your behalf and then if he done it for somebody else amen in a certain way because they've done a certain thing amen god is obligated to you if you come the same way god is obligated to your word and he's still doing he's still obligated this morning and brother brown says he's got to be the same in every way that he was then so he's got to be the same now he's got to manifest himself in the same way and he will do what he promised to do it that's the promise that we have that the same yesterday today and forever that same jesus christ can manifest himself in our midst amen you believe that this morning amen so by his spirit so he's on the throne amen they're interceding on our behalf but he sent back the holy ghost he sent back not some diminished part of himself but he sent back his very life amen amen the holy spirit that he sent back is not something that has not diminished but it's the same quality it's the same power amen and it brings a continuation of the same life that he lived back in you and i amen so his spirit's among us he sent his spirit back among men in the church age book he said i am in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i'm in the midst of the church amen he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us in the patmos vision brother braham says here don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you are heir too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail amen we've been given power this morning church we've been getting given authority we didn't have nothing of our own but by a spirit amen by the power of god amen by the word we've been given that authority amen to speak his word to confess his word and he is obligated this morning to perform it so let us hold fast our profession as we read earlier for he is the high priest of our confession so your confession it's a profession and that word means whom we profess to be ours or what one presses professes amen so whom we profess our high priest who is passing the heavens intercedes upon our confession and our revelation of who he is and what he has done amen we believe his word you believe his word you accept his word and then you confess him and when you do that when you confess it then brother braham said then god can go to acting on your behalf but not until you confess it has to come forth from your lips and when you do that he goes to interceding on your behalf he begins to work for you and i am it's our profession it's our testimony amen we we live what we believe if you believe something and then if you believe something is yours you accept it you live it you believe it that's your testimony it becomes a part of who you are i mean it's what you say it's what you do it's what you live i mean it's a declaration your profession that's a declaration of what you believe and what do we believe this morning we believe his word amen because that's what we've been called to amen those are that's what we're heir to where those are our promises and that's what god has told us and we accepted it that it's for us but it's also a declaration of whom you believe and i believe this morning he's faithful and true and that he's a faithful high priest he's faithful to his people he's not some distant god amen but right now amen he's not an impersonal god but right now and then he's governing in the affairs of men he's governing in the affairs of our lives amen he's our creator he's our sustainer in this life amen amen so our profession it's a declaration in whom we believe amen and we've got to take a stand in this hour and you've got to take a stand on what you believe and whom you believe amen amen you've got to take a stand amen we've got to stand there as a people and then when you when you believe something when you believe for something and then you've got to stand there and be unmovable because satan's going to try to shake you off of it he's going to tell you that it's not yours that it's not for you that you're not good enough not good enough but we don't have to be good enough and remember we've just got to take a stand on his word i mean you've got to take a stand on what he said and be there and stand there among uh unmovable unshakable among the believers of the word amen believing in whom we have believed amen for we're living we're living in a shaking time an unstable time it's a time of uncertainty amen but i believe we have one that we can go to we can be certain of god this morning amen we can say like paul that i know and whom i have believed and then persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed to him is that the god you served this morning amen do you believe that this morning that he's able to keep whatever we commit to him whatever we go to him and then he's able to act on our behalf and when his works are finished everything that we have need of is in him in isaiah 53 and 4 says surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so it's a past tense thing it's already done amen he hath past has borne our griefs he hath carried your sorrows you don't have to carry them because he carried them for you amen we did a steam him stricken smitten of god he he was afflicted he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquity and the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he's a living god i mean he's a living god this morning it's not some ideology but it's something that i've experienced this morning it's something that we've all experienced and he's already done it for you and i we just got to go to him so he took all that upon himself and then he became a partaker of death to release us from the fear of death i mean he became a partaker of this life and he is our everything amen this morning he wants us to cast all of our cares upon him amen everything amen moses was commanded to strike the rock that it would bring forth water amen and we know what moses done that in his anger as the as the children of israel murmured and then he struck the rock again and and and he and he paid for that he wasn't allowed to go over in his anger he wasn't allowed to go over to the promised land and then because he broke the very top that god would portray in jesus christ amen and jesus christ was struck at calvary and then he was struck once he ain't got to come again amen but he's still that same god amen all you've got to do now amen the children of israel they didn't have to strike the rock twice amen but if they they could they were commanded to strike it once and from then on speak to the rock and then it would bring forth amen our jesus he was struck at calvary god's masterpiece amen the one that came for you and i and many bore my griefs he bore my sin in my iniquities amen and we can come to him this morning whatever you have need of amen and you can speak to the rock amen you can come and confess amen his word whatever you would have need of and we can speak to the rock this morning speak to our rock the lord jesus amen if you're thirsty this morning amen he's that cold drink of water if you need a refreshing from the presence of the lord he's all that you have need of this morning amen he just wants you to come and speak to him if you have need of joy this morning he just wants you to come and man he wants his children to be happy he don't want us to be sad he don't want us amen with our hands hanging down in our head hanging low amen but he wants us to be happy he wants us to raise our hands and man to be happy and man and be full of joy do you believe that amen we can come to him we don't have to walk in the moly grubs of this life amen we've got one that gave us all for us amen and we we ought to give our lives to him we ought to come to him with our everything because he's bidding us to come you stand this morning you love the lord amen i believe he's on the throne this morning i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i believe our god is sitting there unmovable unshakable amen he's there no matter what time would hold and man david said i put my time in his hands and because god holds the future he holds our very lives in his hands if what is committed to him he'll hold our future in his hands we can walk by faith we can live by faith no one who's in control no one who's on the throne and he's there this morning providing grace and mercy and help in a time of need he's sitting there with his blood at the right hand of the majesty on high he's sitting there at the right hand you think well does god have a right hand god is a spirit so that right hand is authority he's sitting there at the authority and then he's sitting there in authority and power waiting on his children to call him and then he's got the authority of everything in heaven and earth amen everything is subject to him and in his church and then it's subject to him everything that we have need of him and he can feel all in all amen he's the one that can fill all and all he can fill your life he can feel your need it can give you whatever you have need of amen if we are his people if we are his body we have that same power and that in the name of jesus christ every demon every sickness every spirit that would rise up against you amen is under your feet this morning amen you've got to put the word on your lips you've got to put his promises on your lips and i'll take it even a step further than that amen when you believe when you come on god's terms and you've come as provided way and when you confess that word amen amen we as a people we have the authority not from our within ourselves amen but from him we have the authority to then begin to rebuke the enemy rebuke the enemy rebuke that devil that would come against you amen because you've been given authority you've been given power and those things are under your feet this morning they are subject to you this morning you believe that whatsoever you loose on earth will be loose in heaven amen whatsoever you confess to god god will begin to loose that on the earth in heaven and act on your behalf amen he he's wanting us to come to him not just this morning but every day he wants us to come before his throne amen and ask him he wants you to ask
