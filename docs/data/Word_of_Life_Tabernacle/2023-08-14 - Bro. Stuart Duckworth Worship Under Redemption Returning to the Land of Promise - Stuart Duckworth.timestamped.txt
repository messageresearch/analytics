[42:00] the first chapter
[42:03] and
[42:06] got my new fancy iPad here I'm trying to
[42:08] figure out
[42:09] which angle I prefer better
[42:12] we'll figure it out as we go amen
[42:15] amen with this uh it's been a while
[42:17] since we preached and and I just been
[42:20] busy and probably certain things limited
[42:23] me from that but amen we're here this
[42:25] evening and we would just want to kind
[42:27] of continue that that line of thinking
[42:30] of worship under Redemption
[42:33] and just title it returning to the land
[42:36] of promise amen
[42:39] Ruth one now it came to pass in the days
[42:42] when the judges ruled that there was a
[42:44] famine in the lamb and a certain man of
[42:47] Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the
[42:50] country of Moab he and his wife and his
[42:52] two sons
[42:54] and the name of the man was a lemonade
[42:56] and the name of his wife Naomi in the
[42:58] name of his two sons melon and Chilean
[43:01] aphrodites of Bethlehem Judah
[43:04] and they came in the country of Moab and
[43:07] continued there
[43:09] and elimelech Naomi's husband died and
[43:13] she was left in her two sons
[43:15] and they took them wives of the women of
[43:17] Moab the name of the one was oppa and
[43:21] the name of the other Ruth and they
[43:23] dwelled there about 10 years
[43:26] and melon and Chilean died also both of
[43:30] them and the woman was left of her two
[43:31] sons and her husband
[43:33] and then she arose with her
[43:35] daughters-in-law that she might return
[43:37] from the country of mold before she had
[43:40] heard in the country of mobile how that
[43:41] the Lord had visited his people and
[43:44] giving them bread
[43:45] or of course she went forth out of the
[43:47] place where she was her and her two
[43:49] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[43:52] on the way to return unto the land of
[43:54] Judah amen just pray the Lord bless his
[43:57] word you can be seated here
[44:00] when the story starts out as is a
[44:03] lovable sweet woman Naomi
[44:07] and her name means Pleasant
[44:10] elimelech her husband which means
[44:13] worship
[44:14] a pleasant worship
[44:16] I mean that's that's what a true family
[44:18] that serves God really is
[44:21] it's a place of pleasant worship
[44:23] I mean a place where the blood and the
[44:26] protection of God is applied
[44:29] and we when we started preaching uh this
[44:32] thought we we kind of went from you know
[44:35] the thought that we're we're going back
[44:36] to what Adam and Eve lost we're being
[44:38] redeemed back to that
[44:40] back to that family the image of that
[44:43] family where where God would come down
[44:45] on the cool of the evening and there
[44:47] they would worship amen and that that's
[44:49] what God wanted he wanted a man he
[44:51] wanted to see that family and and we
[44:54] live in a time where the family has just
[44:56] been completely broke down completely
[44:58] destroyed amen but we as Christians amen
[45:01] we we're we're not to partake in that
[45:03] amen our families should be built up in
[45:05] the things of God is that right and I
[45:08] just I just think about you know just
[45:10] the the support group that we have just
[45:13] as as Christians and not just as
[45:15] Christians but message believers
[45:17] right we have we we have we know so many
[45:20] people
[45:21] you know we know people and in every
[45:23] almost every state in different
[45:24] countries we have just a huge support
[45:27] group and a lot of people
[45:29] don't have that
[45:30] amen but the the home should be a a
[45:33] pleasant place of of worship a place
[45:36] where am in the protection amen of God
[45:39] is amen where the token has been applied

[46:52] make us immune from troubles sickness or
[46:55] strike we're all gonna get sick and then
[46:57] we're going to deal with sadness and
[46:59] then with Gloom and and be weary at
[47:01] times and sometimes we cause that
[47:04] and sometimes it's just a trial to test
[47:06] your faith
[47:08] amen but we continue our thought that
[47:11] that we are under Redemption amen we're
[47:13] not just under a Doctrine we're not just
[47:16] under an idea or a denomination amen but
[47:18] we as Believers were living under amen

[47:35] by the power of God
[47:37] amen and there's power in Redemption
[47:40] Eminence power in the word and the
[47:42] things that we believe amen I think so
[47:45] many times we we Overlook and we we

[47:49] because we can't realize we can't really
[47:52] partake of the things that we have
[47:54] received amen but if we could just
[47:56] understand the power amen of the
[47:59] bleeding word of the power of redemption
[48:01] and the things that we we're trying to
[48:03] preach and that we're trying to portray
[48:05] if we could really partake of that
[48:07] amen the power they will bring in our
[48:10] lives

[48:25] under the opening of the word if we're
[48:27] waiting for something to happen amen we
[48:30] can't partake right now we're waiting
[48:32] but because the thing has been open to
[48:34] us maybe you don't quite understand it
[48:36] and you're you may we may never just

[48:48] this very moment and the age and the
[48:50] hour that you're walking and it's here

[51:04] family amen I just don't feel like I'll
[51:06] ever be strong enough or good enough to
[51:08] overcome it all amen but he takes all
[51:10] the wrong amen and we take on his
[51:13] righteousness we didn't have to be good
[51:15] enough amen but a lamb came forth amen
[51:18] one that was worthy amen and he showed
[51:20] himself alive it's after 2 000 years so

[51:41] every wrinkle every blemish amen and we
[51:44] take on his righteousness
[51:48] amen
[51:52] I mean the price has been paid by the
[51:55] one who who is worthy and he is Our
[51:57] Redeemer
[51:58] amen it has been paid by the one who has
[52:01] already overcame amen
[52:04] amen as we go on with this family elima
[52:07] Lake and his family they left the land
[52:09] of promise because of famine
[52:11] it was a time of drought a time of
[52:13] Hunger
[52:14] amen and brother Brian said a Jew's
[52:16] first mistake is when they leave the
[52:19] land of promise and the same for a
[52:22] Believer when when we get out of Christ
[52:23] that's when we get into trouble that's
[52:25] when bad things begin to happen right
[52:28] but stay in Christ that's what we're
[52:30] trying to as a preacher that's what
[52:32] you're trying to get the people to do
[52:33] that's what you're trying to do stay in
[52:35] Christ stay in the word make sure your
[52:37] experience matches the word amen
[52:40] stay in his promise for you stay in your
[52:42] land
[52:43] of what God has given you
[52:46] Abraham after he received the promise
[52:50] he had the Covenant of the Holy Ghost in
[52:53] type
[52:54] he had met Elohim God come down in flesh
[52:58] amen and met there with Abraham under
[53:00] the tree amen Abraham received the
[53:03] message
[53:04] amen he and Sarah received their body
[53:08] changing and returned back young so they
[53:11] could receive the promised son well here
[53:13] we are yet Abraham left the promised
[53:16] land of blessing and went to career
[53:18] right after that right after he had met
[53:21] Elohim there he left yeah
[53:24] what happened a little famine a little
[53:27] trouble caused him to doubt
[53:30] caused him to
[53:32] come on Sarah
[53:33] let's go we got to do something about
[53:35] this we gotta we got to try to do
[53:37] something about it ourselves
[53:39] you can imagine there
[53:42] being Sarah you know they're probably
[53:44] feeling pretty good about that time
[53:46] amen their strength had been renewed
[53:48] they'd been changed
[53:50] and they're a little doubt to come in a
[53:52] little little trouble and there they set
[53:54] out on a 300 mile Journey on the back of
[53:57] a camel Amen to leave where God had told
[54:00] him to stay
[54:02] amen but when he went down there he got
[54:04] into trouble
[54:05] hey man he went down there and he lied
[54:07] about Sarah being his wife and almost
[54:09] got a good man killed
[54:12] and brother Branham says here he says if
[54:15] jehovah-jari said the drought come on he
[54:18] left it anyhow he said God told you to
[54:20] do something you didn't do it you're
[54:21] back sliding so Abraham was backslid and
[54:24] any Jew left Palestine was back backslid
[54:27] that's their Promised Land amen so he
[54:30] left he he received the Holy Ghost in
[54:34] tithe yeah he'd met Elohim God and flesh
[54:37] God come down and met with Abraham amen
[54:41] and he gave him strength back in his
[54:43] body received the message and then he
[54:45] gave him that promise he confirmed that
[54:47] promise to him amen but at a little
[54:50] trouble and this just shows Humanity it
[54:52] shows him and we're the same way we're
[54:55] the same way sometimes a little trouble
[54:57] will cause you to doubt and cause you to
[54:59] backslid and cause you to try to go do
[55:01] it on your own but that's when we get
[55:03] into trouble
[55:04] we get out of the land
[55:07] but we've got to we've got to return
[55:09] back to the land amen we've got to come
[55:11] back to the land
[55:14] amen but even even in Abraham's
[55:18] backsliding it shows the elect
[55:20] not not that we would be better if
[55:22] somebody else would do the same thing
[55:23] but it shows the favor of God Amen even
[55:26] in his backslidings and wanderings God
[55:29] come down and would show him Grace I
[55:31] mean he was showing favor
[55:33] I mean he would he would bring
[55:35] restoration he would restore his wife
[55:37] back to him
[55:38] amen but
[55:40] but he had to repent
[55:42] he had to repent
[55:44] yeah he had to repent of his backside
[55:45] he's right
[55:48] sure right yeah we have that ability
[55:51] here as Believers to repent when we do
[55:54] things wrong
[55:55] amen
[55:56] and I asked this question what what do
[55:59] you do when you realize your backslid
[56:04] what do you what do you do come on
[56:07] really what what a lot of us do and what
[56:09] we've done through the years you just

[56:16] go days
[56:18] sometimes we go months sometimes you go
[56:20] years
[56:21] right
[56:22] what what do you do when you're backslid
[56:25] what do you do you start Right Where You
[56:28] Are
[56:28] don't let another minute go by oh yeah
[56:31] yeah you just stop where you're at and
[56:33] you ask God to forgive you and he is
[56:35] able and he is just to be able to do
[56:38] that do you believe that here this
[56:40] evening amen don't let it go on and on

[57:15] amen God forgive me if I've said
[57:17] something wasn't right amen amen stayed
[57:19] prayed up church and then stay in his
[57:22] presence amen if we get out of step with
[57:24] the word get back instead
[57:28] and Believers sometimes sometimes we
[57:30] test God
[57:32] we see how see how much we can get by
[57:34] with
[57:36] come on now
[57:38] I know that's that's hard and that's top
[57:42] you know we get to feeling good

[57:46] really good
[57:47] we'll get quiet on me
[57:50] things are going really good and you
[57:51] just and I'll just slip just a little
[57:53] bit
[57:55] you all know it's true
[57:57] that's right but that's human nature to
[58:00] be that way
[58:01] amen but but I don't want to live like
[58:03] that
[58:04] right hey man I want to be consistent I
[58:07] want to be a consistent believer I want
[58:09] to I want to stay prayed up I don't want
[58:11] to live in a bad Sun conditioning and I
[58:13] don't want to live amen where the Holy

[58:33] God and amen and God will let you do
[58:36] that but he'll he'll make it hard on you
[58:40] the message of Grace brother Brian says
[58:42] oh Abraham how Abraham tested God's
[58:44] patience told him Abraham stay in this
[58:46] land don't you go out of it but as soon
[58:48] as a famine come Abraham run and he says
[58:52] Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by
[58:54] grace and saved him and that's how he
[58:56] takes you by grace and how do we test
[58:58] his patience today we're up and tomorrow
[59:01] we're down one day we believe in the
[59:03] next day we're wandering today we're
[59:05] methodists tomorrow we're Baptists today
[59:07] we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow
[59:09] little tummy ache comes and we don't
[59:11] know whether we to believe it or not but
[59:13] yet in the midst of all that God wants
[59:15] us to stay put but he saves us anyhow
[59:18] and if it wasn't for the grace of God
[59:19] we'd all be gone sure God Saves by his
[59:23] grace even in Ephesians 2 8 for by Grace
[59:26] you are saved through faith not of
[59:29] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[59:32] Works lest any man should boast for we
[59:36] are his workmanship created in Christ
[59:38] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[59:41] before ordained that we should walk in I
[59:44] I love that scripture I probably call
[59:46] that scripture quite a bit amen but to
[59:48] think that that no man could boast amen
[59:51] the bad with you and I the bad has
[59:53] always outweighed the good we could
[59:56] never do good anything good enough to
[59:58] Merit his grace because his grace is an
[1:00:01] unmerited favor that he shows towards us
[1:00:04] by God's grace he holds us up in this
[1:00:07] hour by God's grace he saved me from a
[1:00:09] life of sin and by God's grace he'll
[1:00:12] take me in a Rapture amen God has a
[1:00:14] Grace provided amen for every step of
[1:00:17] the journey no matter how stubborn amen
[1:00:19] no matter how bad Sin we get sometimes a
[1:00:22] real believer they may get knocked down
[1:00:24] amen they they may stay down for a
[1:00:26] little bit but if you're a real believer
[1:00:27] you've got to get back up amen and walk
[1:00:30] in the grace of God Walk Amen in the
[1:00:33] workmanship amen that he has create
[1:00:35] created you into
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] the beds always outweigh the good
[1:00:44] no man can boast
[1:00:46] there wasn't one that was but one that
[1:00:48] was worthy amen
[1:00:51] amen and it's simply his grace and favor
[1:00:53] on our lives
[1:00:55] as his redeemed we were completely lost
[1:00:58] without him yeah yeah amen that's right
[1:01:01] amen but with him we're completely
[1:01:03] redeemed
[1:01:04] amen we're his workmanship created in
[1:01:07] Christ Jesus Under The Works of
[1:01:08] redemption amen is redemption bringing
[1:01:11] us back
[1:01:12] bringing us back Amen to what we were in
[1:01:14] his mind
[1:01:16] amen I believe this word
[1:01:19] it's not just taking us back to
[1:01:22] Azusa Street come on come on it's not
[1:01:24] just taking us back to Amen to what fell
[1:01:27] on the day of Pentecost remember we're
[1:01:29] going back to what Adam and Eve lost
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:35] we're going back to that
[1:01:37] amen and I think that I think I believe
[1:01:40] that we're we're even going back further
[1:01:42] than that we're going back to what we
[1:01:44] were in his mind yes I mean you can take
[1:01:47] Adam and Eve even they're at their best
[1:01:49] they were vulnerable
[1:01:52] remember we're going back even beyond
[1:01:54] that to where we're just we're the queen
[1:01:56] of God we're the Queen of Heaven and
[1:01:58] that's the position that we'll hold in
[1:01:59] the Millennium amen we won't just sit
[1:02:02] outside the city remember we will be in
[1:02:04] the city
[1:02:05] all right brother Brown he said this and
[1:02:07] it may may stump you it shouldn't
[1:02:10] confuse us but there will be those
[1:02:12] outside the city he said that we'll be
[1:02:14] doing what Adam and Eve did amen during
[1:02:16] the Garden of Eden they'll be dressing
[1:02:18] and chilling he said but they're
[1:02:19] redeemed and then the elect of bride
[1:02:21] will be inside the city as the queen
[1:02:25] amen we're going back Beyond even
[1:02:27] further than what we can see sometimes
[1:02:31] that's what Redemption is bringing us
[1:02:33] back to
[1:02:37] yeah
[1:02:39] Hallelujah
[1:02:41] well thank you Lord
[1:02:45] brother Ram says here in the kinsman
[1:02:46] redeemer he said Naomi because of a
[1:02:49] famine wandered out from the lands and
[1:02:51] went into Moab finding bread
[1:02:54] and so she left she left God's land she
[1:02:57] left the land that she had you know
[1:02:59] God's Promised Land There was a famine
[1:03:01] there yeah but there was bread in in
[1:03:03] this other land in the land of Moab
[1:03:05] he said she didn't have to do that
[1:03:07] because the rest of them stayed in Judea
[1:03:10] Bethlehem Bethlehem means the Bethel the
[1:03:12] house of God house of praise and they
[1:03:15] stay there
[1:03:16] but something you know a little trouble
[1:03:18] happened and this this family that
[1:03:20] caused him to leave
[1:03:23] and no matter how desperate or bad

[1:03:46] you're to stay in your land if you're to
[1:03:48] stay in your position no matter how bad

[1:03:52] because God is our sustainer God is our
[1:03:56] refuge if we'll just stay put

[1:04:32] ever need he would he would provide it
[1:04:34] there it was a land I mean it was a land
[1:04:36] of bread it was a land of worship
[1:04:39] hey man amen they got out of the land of
[1:04:42] worship they got out of the land of
[1:04:44] bread can you see what I'm saying here
[1:04:46] amen we've got to return church amen if
[1:04:49] we're out of Step we've got to return
[1:04:51] unto that land
[1:04:54] Amen in that land there was there was
[1:04:56] bread there was worship there was Joy
[1:04:59] amen there was Redemption
[1:05:01] it was the law of redemption
[1:05:05] amen oh if we're out of Step amen it's
[1:05:09] time to return amen
[1:05:14] brother Branham says here
[1:05:16] he goes on the kinsman redeemer he said
[1:05:18] now the mohabbats originated from an
[1:05:20] illegitimate child
[1:05:22] which was law to daughters and they had
[1:05:25] after the escape the fires of Sodom by
[1:05:27] the grace of God then the daughters got
[1:05:29] their father drunk and lived with him as
[1:05:31] wife and they brought forth a child and
[1:05:33] one of them was originated and brought
[1:05:35] in the nation of more supposedly to have
[1:05:38] been Christians he said but we're mixed
[1:05:40] in paganism and see leaving the promised
[1:05:43] land no matter how bad it was the
[1:05:45] sojourn in another land brought trouble
[1:05:49] so we could look at we could look at
[1:05:51] Moab as it was a land of bad decisions
[1:05:54] and you you go back to a lot and man in
[1:05:57] any time lot would make a decision that
[1:05:59] seemed to be the wrong decision
[1:06:01] Abraham said you go this way I'll go
[1:06:03] this way amen but lot chose the
[1:06:05] well-watered plains is that right he
[1:06:08] chose he chose wrong
[1:06:11] amen and and there he he got tied up
[1:06:14] amen with the politics of the city of
[1:06:17] the city that God would destroy God he
[1:06:19] got tied up with it
[1:06:21] another bad decision don't get caught up
[1:06:23] in politics don't become the mayor of
[1:06:26] the place that God's going to destroy
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:30] don't get tied up with those things
[1:06:32] don't get tied up with unbelief in the
[1:06:35] world right
[1:06:37] and there they went on and they made bad
[1:06:39] decisions his wife was she turned back
[1:06:42] and she was amen turned to a pillar of
[1:06:44] Saul another bad decision in that line
[1:06:47] of family there
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:50] and so they left there and amen another
[1:06:52] bad decision after a bad decision you
[1:06:55] understand what I'm saying
[1:06:57] there Amen in the land of bad decisions
[1:07:02] amen but if
[1:07:04] you see here this family
[1:07:06] amen predestination this is where
[1:07:08] predestination comes in if God ordains
[1:07:10] something to be it will be
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:13] amen there's a predestination and a
[1:07:16] foreknowledge and man there will
[1:07:19] take all the wrong as we said earlier
[1:07:21] all the bad decisions it will bring
[1:07:24] redemption in that Amen in God's purpose
[1:07:27] amen God's purpose it is predestination
[1:07:29] and it's foreknowledge his purpose for
[1:07:32] you and I am in the midst of all the
[1:07:34] everything that is wrong about us amen
[1:07:37] he has a Plan of Redemption and it is
[1:07:39] greater than our bad decisions amen out
[1:07:43] of that he will bring Redemption he will
[1:07:44] bring life from death
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:52] and who is this
[1:07:55] was good
[1:07:56] he says here that the the predestinated
[1:07:59] is the only ones that's considered in
[1:08:01] Redemption
[1:08:03] no one else only they're predestinated
[1:08:06] and he said people might be making like
[1:08:09] they are but the real Redemption is
[1:08:11] those that are predestinating because
[1:08:13] the very word redeemed means to bring
[1:08:15] back to redeem something is to to bring
[1:08:18] it bring it back to its original Place
[1:08:20] says hallelujah so it's only the
[1:08:23] predestinator that will be brought back
[1:08:25] because the others didn't come from
[1:08:27] there see bring back he said being
[1:08:30] Eternal with him at the beginning the
[1:08:32] eternal life that you had is thought of
[1:08:35] what she was only he wanted you he
[1:08:37] wanted me to stand in the Pulpit he said
[1:08:40] he said he wanted you to sit in the sea
[1:08:42] tonight he said then we aren't serving
[1:08:44] his eternal purpose and the one that
[1:08:47] left home only come to Earth to serve
[1:08:50] his purpose amen that's a lot to swallow
[1:08:54] there but only the predestinated or
[1:08:55] considered in Redemption amen amen the
[1:08:58] one that left home left the Heavenly he
[1:09:01] came to Earth to serve his purpose and
[1:09:04] when Jesus came amen amen it was God God
[1:09:07] becoming human God the amen humiliated
[1:09:10] himself amen he came and he was
[1:09:13] ridiculed and made fun of they called
[1:09:15] him illegitimate they called him the
[1:09:17] devil amen but he was the Prince of
[1:09:19] Peace he was the very Heart Of God
[1:09:21] expressed through Humanity he wasn't a
[1:09:24] lesser person but it was the same person
[1:09:26] it was what God was in the human form
[1:09:29] amen but amen not just as he come to El
[1:09:32] to Abraham in the in the form of Elohim
[1:09:34] but this one came to be born Amen to
[1:09:36] live and breathe and die man that he
[1:09:39] could redeem amen that we could come
[1:09:41] into the land of redemption that we
[1:09:43] could come amen from our mistakes and
[1:09:46] our bad decisions and then we could go
[1:09:47] to the land of redemption
[1:09:50] and be redeemed because we were in his
[1:09:52] mind amen because we were considered as
[1:09:55] a predestinated Amen to be redeemed yeah
[1:10:00] that's good he was a very Heart Of God
[1:10:02] he came and he overcame amen he overcame
[1:10:06] as a man not using his power because we
[1:10:09] heard this morning amen not not using
[1:10:12] his own power amen but he took the word
[1:10:14] and it's seasoned amen Satan would try
[1:10:17] to take him amen and use the word out of
[1:10:19] the Season yes it was the word amen but
[1:10:22] it was out of a season amen and he said
[1:10:24] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:10:26] alone amen but by every word that
[1:10:28] proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen
[1:10:30] we're not just isolated to a scripture
[1:10:32] amen but this broad amen she will be the
[1:10:35] fullness amen of the manifestation of
[1:10:38] the revelation of the hour amen we will
[1:10:40] take on Amen you may not see it now but
[1:10:43] we will take on the identity of this
[1:10:45] message just as Jesus fulfilled the Old
[1:10:48] Testament we will fulfill the New
[1:10:50] Testament and then when Jesus had
[1:10:52] overcame and he amen when he died and he
[1:10:54] rose again he said I come from God and I
[1:10:57] go back to God Amen and when this
[1:10:59] Earthly or this Earthly journey is over
[1:11:00] in man we
[1:11:02] come on screaming
[1:11:04] we bypass the Heavenly we bypass our
[1:11:08] Theo often his brother Brandon said amen
[1:11:10] when we come down to be tempted Amen to
[1:11:12] be tried Amen to prove who we were amen
[1:11:15] and when we overcome that Last Enemy
[1:11:17] when we overcome the last devil amen we
[1:11:20] came from God and we'll go back to God
[1:11:22] Amen in a Rapture Grace yeah
[1:11:26] oh thank you yes come on now I don't
[1:11:29] mean to yell at you
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] we come from God and we're going back to
[1:11:39] God despite our bad decisions yeah amen
[1:11:47] amen we all had a decision to make
[1:11:51] we all had to decide at some point
[1:11:54] yeah you you had to make a mental
[1:11:56] decision for yourself even though we're
[1:11:59] predestinated you had to make the choice
[1:12:01] that I'm going to serve God
[1:12:04] but I I can't do this on my own anymore
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:08] you tried you tried to you tried to amen
[1:12:11] shake the all the wrong that that was in
[1:12:14] your life
[1:12:15] we tried we tried we tried to do it our
[1:12:18] own but there come a time when we had to
[1:12:19] surrender right we couldn't do it our
[1:12:21] own we had to do a decision amen I'm
[1:12:25] dead I'm dead and sin and trespasses
[1:12:28] amen and I want that life amen I want
[1:12:30] the life of the Holy Ghost living in me
[1:12:32] amen I can't do it on my own I need him
[1:12:35] we had to make that decision that we we
[1:12:37] could no longer do it
[1:12:39] on our own
[1:12:43] Ruth one
[1:12:45] verse 8. Naomi said unto her two
[1:12:47] daughters in law go return each to her
[1:12:51] mother's house
[1:12:53] Lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[1:12:55] dealt with the dead and with me
[1:12:58] the Ruth and orpa they hadn't had they
[1:13:00] had to make a decision
[1:13:02] Naomi try she tried to persuade them to
[1:13:05] go back
[1:13:06] go back to their homes go back to their
[1:13:08] religion go back go back to their gods
[1:13:10] go back to where they came from
[1:13:12] later on said they lifted up their Voice
[1:13:14] verse 14 and wept again an orpha kissed
[1:13:17] her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto
[1:13:19] her you see the predestination there
[1:13:22] hey man she she come from paganism
[1:13:25] she come from bad decisions she knew
[1:13:28] nothing of of the law of redemption of
[1:13:30] of the bread and different things that
[1:13:32] was really there
[1:13:35] remember there was something in our
[1:13:36] heart she claimed unto Ruth
[1:13:40] going to Naomi I'm sorry
[1:13:42] she said behold our sister-in-law has
[1:13:44] gone back under her people in her under
[1:13:45] her Gods return Thou after her
[1:13:47] sister-in-law after Thy Thy
[1:13:49] sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me
[1:13:51] not to leave thee or to return from
[1:13:54] following after thee for whether thou
[1:13:56] goest thou will go and whether thou law
[1:13:57] just I will Lodge thy people shall be my
[1:14:00] people and thy God shall be my God Amen
[1:14:03] where you die that's where I die where
[1:14:05] you're where you're buried that's where
[1:14:06] I'll be buried
[1:14:08] I mean there was something different
[1:14:09] about Ruth right
[1:14:13] and brother Brown says here he says one
[1:14:15] of our darn laws orpa said she would
[1:14:16] return back to her country to her Gods
[1:14:18] to her church to her people and Naomi
[1:14:21] tried to get Ruth to go back but she
[1:14:22] said you your people are my people your
[1:14:25] God is my God Amen where you're buried
[1:14:27] I'll be buried I'll not turn back yeah
[1:14:30] I'll not turn back and that that was in
[1:14:33] her lineage as we said before if you
[1:14:35] look back that was in her lineage or her
[1:14:37] great great great grandmother turned
[1:14:39] back
[1:14:39] amen but there was something there was a
[1:14:41] predestination there there was something
[1:14:43] in root that was different
[1:14:45] there was something drawing her
[1:14:50] I'll not turn back
[1:14:52] and brother Brown said that's when a
[1:14:54] person has caught the vision don't make
[1:14:56] any difference what her people said
[1:14:57] you're going over there to become a holy
[1:14:59] Roder or something
[1:15:00] that didn't make any difference to Ruth
[1:15:02] because there was a purpose of God to be
[1:15:04] fulfilled and just as sure as you're
[1:15:06] hungering tonight for the Holy Spirit
[1:15:08] there's something in you pulling you
[1:15:10] that's a that's a purpose of God in your
[1:15:13] life that God has for you to be
[1:15:15] fulfilled just like it was with Ruth he
[1:15:18] said that's what God wants and man it's
[1:15:21] not that borderline halfway but an
[1:15:24] absolute I mean it's a full surrender to
[1:15:26] the kingdom of God
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:33] he goes on here he says notice Ruth was
[1:15:37] willing to forsake her Gods forsake her
[1:15:39] past life for sacred people forsake
[1:15:42] everything in return with Naomi no
[1:15:44] matter what the circumstance was she was
[1:15:46] willing to go on he said that's the way
[1:15:48] every man or woman that comes to Christ
[1:15:50] must first be willing regardless he said
[1:15:53] I never like to tell people you're going
[1:15:55] to prosper or be a rich man now or God's
[1:15:57] going to bless you you ain't gonna have
[1:15:59] no sickness I don't promise him that
[1:16:01] because God doesn't promise him that he
[1:16:04] said I say if you're really born again
[1:16:05] in your heart I don't care how rough the
[1:16:08] road gets you'll stand and hold on to
[1:16:11] God's unchanging hand no matter what
[1:16:13] lays before me if Jesus goes with me
[1:16:16] I'll go amen that's the determination of
[1:16:19] every believer that that's a faith amen
[1:16:22] that has to be in our heart no matter
[1:16:24] what happens I'm gonna go on with Jesus
[1:16:26] I'm gonna go on with the word amen no
[1:16:29] matter amen I may have fell down a
[1:16:31] thousand times I'm going to get back up
[1:16:33] I'm gonna go on
[1:16:35] hey man
[1:16:38] I'll wander down here pretty quick
[1:16:41] and then they come
[1:16:43] into a Time amen they were returning to
[1:16:47] the land
[1:16:49] and they were returning Amen in the time
[1:16:51] of harvest
[1:16:53] Amen in a time of plenty
[1:16:55] Amen to the land of praise and joy I
[1:16:59] mean they returned back him into the
[1:17:01] land of Redemption where there was one
[1:17:02] waiting amen that for all that was lost
[1:17:05] all that had been lost amen he had
[1:17:09] within him amen the ability to redeem
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:19] we have returned from to the word
[1:17:21] and when we have returned amen not to a
[1:17:23] denomination not to a system not to some
[1:17:26] big shot whoever amen not to a Doctrine
[1:17:30] remember we have returned to the one
[1:17:32] that can redeem our bodies that can
[1:17:34] change the same man from what we were to
[1:17:37] what we will be to bring us back to what
[1:17:39] we were in his mind
[1:17:40] oh yeah
