your Bibles with you tonight Exodus chapter 21 and verse one Exodus 21 and verse one it's good to see the Kings back with us I know y'all were out everybody's been dealing with some sickness and so we're just happy to have everybody back that's back tonight just remember those that are traveling back from the funeral and uh just continue to remember that family in prayer if you have your bi it's Exodus 21 and verse one we'll start with verse one and read through verse 6 now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall Go free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself and if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him Sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall PL ly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore him bore his ear through with an A and he shall serve him forever and one more scripture while you're standing Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one Ephesians 2 and one just one verse there and you hath he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins somebody say that's me amen you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and brother Brandon would say it like this just for a foundation here tonight he said on the seventh year there was a priest that sounded a trumpet and if a man had been a slave he said I don't care what his debts was he was free aren't you glad for that I don't care what his debts was he was free now that's a type of the Gospel trumpet he said you might have served the devil all these years in Chains with drink drinking smoking gambling and sin dirty things no matter what you've done but when you hear the gospel trumpet it's a sign that you can go free how many's heard the gospel trumpet here tonight it is a sign that you can go free and he said Faith cometh by hearing and he says hearing what the word the word of God now you've heard the Full Gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer and I'd like to just go off here for a second and say this the Full Gospel in this age is different than any other age you've been you've had age after age that would come and they could shed a light here and a light there and there would be a little bit of light here and they would walk in that light but then they would denominate and it would actually bind the people again to the light that they actually was open to so they would come out in justification and then they would be bound to that Doctrine and wouldn't go any farther justification sanctification it was all the same way we see the Pentecostals did it with the restoration of the gifts and they became bound to the very thing that was the light for their age because they would refused to go any farther than that so they would be found by denominating on on on a truth can you say Amen it was actually a truth but they would denominate on that and that would actually uh bind the people to their to their Doctrine it would be it would be a new doctrine it' be a new idea it would be something that though it would be true they would take the people right back to what they come out of by denominating them again can you say Amen so the Full Gospel is an open book The Full Gospel is the Mysteries contained in the book Revelations 10:7 it has been revealed and the full restoration of the word has been revealed to us can you say Amen to that tonight amen he said under this evening light message that we can receive Freedom amen it's it's a message that places us and we are sons and no longer slaves can you say amen and so how do we receive this message of Freedom it's not it's not by going back and denominating it's not going back to 1906 Pentecost it's not going back to what Luther had or what Wesley had but what it is it's walking in all the light that has been revealed to you in your day and hour so I can say tonight that I believe this message is the message of the hour I believe this is the evening time and we have heard the evening message and if we will walk in that and not go back to say well we're we're going to denominate on the tongues or we're we're going to we're going to just you know we're going to go back to the gifts or listen that's all restored in this message but we don't want to do what the the the churches have done before us and stop with just the tongues and stop with stop with just the gifts or stop with just a just a justification message but we want to continue on until the fullness of the opening of the word can you say amen and so this is an age of life this is an age of freedom because the word will bring life to a church well can somebody say Amen here tonight the the the the the word actually brings life now now it's not something I can get up here and we can preach and you can you can amen and we can just go home and say well it was a good service but what you need is let the word come into you and actually come into the places of your life that need to be straightened out and let the word do the correcting excuse me let the word word let let the word have its way in your life and watch the full word of God line a people up for a Rapture can you say Amen now brother Brandon would say it like this he said now he said if you just sit and say oh I listened to it but I didn't hear it he said all right then it ain't for you see it's for those who hear it all right now you can hear but you may not really hear it what can you say Amen tonight you may you may hear what a prophet said but if you really hear it then you'll go to action on what he said he said now it's for those who hear it if you can hear now watch he said he said prove this now watch real close and he goes on down to say this he said he said he said he said uh he said some people will say I love my master and that Master he would say is I like to go to the dances and and I ain't giving up my dances for nobody and I ain't giving up this or that or the other for nobody but you have to you have to be willing to lay down everything if you want to be set free in the seventh age well come on somebody we have to be willing to move on with the fullness of the word I tell you what I I don't want to give up nothing but I have to be willing to leave it all behind to follow Christ in this day because everything that is outside of the word can be bondage to you everything that you would put above Christ is bondage but he is the reason that we are able to claim our children he is the reason we're able to come to the house of God he is the reason that we can say I'm free he is the reason I can say I'm no longer a slave why because he set me free his word is coming this day and the word word has made me free and who the son is set free is free indeed you say well who is the son well we know in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and God became flesh so who the word has made free is free indeed what can you say am man tonight he said well he said I he said I tell you he said he said brother brandom I'm going to tell you do you mean you have to do this no you don't have to stop nothing you just come in it stops itself but you say well I wouldn't do that I don't have to do that I belong to church I'm as good as any else he said all right brother that's all right he said well if you want to keep on that way just go right ahead you've heard what the trumpet sounded and you heard the noted give and the Bible said he said look at that wouldn't that make me a text right now now brother brandom says I could go for the next hour on that I won't do that he says but if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound if your denominational idea if your opinion says something that the trumpet didn't say I say let's cast that down and walk on in the full revealed word that we have and brother say he said look at this he said if if the trumpet says Father Son and Holy Ghost that don't sound like the trumpet to me he said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for war he said and he said you may say well I love that devil that's making me do these things that's all right and he well can somebody say amen he said well he's he's talking about somebody saying they love the devil I say tonight I I say I'm going to step on that devil's head if I can and I'm going to cast that devil out with the power that God has given me here tonight but he said he said well they say you're just too narrow-minded up there and I think you're just to this and he said all right and he said then they say I love these things and I think we ought to have these big things like that and do this and we ought to do that and have Bunko in our church whatever that is and and things like that and we all have a good time and they're just as good as any other Bunch you got up there he said okay that's all right he said I I will not go out in this freedom of the spirit you talk about then his master the devil shall bring him to the judges can you say amen and shall also bring him to the door he said then what who is the door it's Jesus Christ he said said I set before you a door and when did that Mark of the Beast come in he said this is the age where the door was set the final marking of the Beast bring him to the door or to the post and he said that's to Calvary oh can you say man I love how a prophet can take this scripture and just and just open it to us why because you may just read it as a Bible story but when the opening of the word come he can come and show you where the scripture fits in in the time that he was preaching in there was some people sitting there that didn't realize that they were actually slaves to a den ational system but a prophet would come and show them hey hey this is the way out of here here is the post set before you choose you this day who you will serve and you either choose to serve God or you choose to follow the word of God well can you say amen and he said if you if you choose this master he said then then you'll serve him forever and he said what do you mean brother Brandon if you hear the gospel truth and you refuse to walk in it then God marks your ear where you'll never hear it no more you've crossed the line see some people say it's Mercy over no if you're still here hear in the gospel message and you're still receiving it and believing it and trying your best to live it it's not over for you because you still have an ear to hear what God is saying to you but if you ever turn the message down and you start saying well I I just don't want to hear that no more and I you go out from it listen you make a decision on whether you want to be free or whether you want to be a slave but I say there's some people here tonight that want to be free can you say Amen I'm not going to be a slave to this world or its system or its denomination but I'm going to walk where Freedom lets me walk listen Church you say this message binds you this message is the only thing that can set you free this is an age of binding it's a denominate this denominate that come to my group join my group no and I know that Spirit gets in the message but we are not to be partakers of that spirit in this age well we got well I'm just going to say it we got tape only over here and an anti-t tape over here and we've got this preacher over here fighting this preacher listen let's just quit our non sense and stay with the word of God and say what a prophet said and just feed on the word of God that's where Liberty comes from see when you start biting one another and backbiting and you start fighting the next thing you know that's when you realize you you start poking one another why because you've got dry in your experience it's time to come back to where the wells are running and where the rivers are running and where the water's flowing why that is the word it is being Washed by the Water of the word of the hour well come on somebody do you actually want to be free then I say the word is how you'll find your freedom tonight the word is what's going to make you free now this brother man would say like this he said now see the trumpet sounded and he can go free that's God's grace can somebody say praise the Lord for that it's it's it's God's grace it's the Year of Jubilee the completion the day of sin is over brother I tell every one of you serving sin oh listen now he said I tell every one of you serving sin Jesus died you don't have to serve sin no more can you say praise the Lord he said you don't have to serve sin no more you don't have to be bowed down to Creeds and denominations he who the son is made free is free indeed he said if you want to go free and be free in the sun Cut Loose from all the things and serve him can somebody say Amen tonight I think it's time we cut loose from everything that would hold us back every Fetter that would hold us down everything that would try to try to hurt us from our prayer life everything that would try to hurt us from the house of God everything that well come on somebody everything that would make us hate our brother or talk bad about our sister I say we need to let go of those things and let's start hearing the word of God again and start leving on one another again and quit trying to be like the world because that's nothing but bondage oh it looks good but the end thereof is destruction I'm not here trying to tell you what something you don't already know if I'm preaching the word then you probably already heard it before but I want to remind you that if you want your freedom if you want to no longer be a slave then get into the word of God and let the word of God set you free well can you say Amen brother brand said a universal belief uh the the the Catholic Church wanted a universal belief and they forced it to the People by punishment and then when Martin Luther come out seeing the spirit of God led him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized the church and image listen a man that come out of an organization he saw what an organiz an organization could do and then comes right out has a gospel truth and then he goes right back into an organization again now it sounds like he should have learned his lesson the first time but but but remember every Revival had to had to start and it had to die it had to begin and end it had to there had to be a Revival and there had to be death to follow it until this final age can you say amen and so brother B said like this he said he said there had to be a political power and he said he he said he lik it it unto a beast because it had to fulfill prophecy in Scripture and he said instead of letting the people walk as God gave the light they organized under discipline and they have to stay to that discipline now brother Brandon said God moved right out into the Methodist Church and the Methodist Church had a Revival that swept the world now I I when I was a kid we were around some of those old Wesley and Methodist people and I can tell you they were some good people those people believed what they were taught but they could not accept anything further than that they could not accept anything that this message had to offer they were still trinitarians many of them and they would still walk in a in an age that Wesley had taught them but they couldn't see no more light now I believe they were Christians but they were not of this evening Light Christian they were not of this evening light bride because what they were they were they were Bound To A system that told them this is as far as you can go and you got to stop you see they thought they were free from from the Luther's AG they thought they were free from justification only but they only went so far and they were bound again I hope you're still with me tonight because I I want to try to go somewhere here but listen that that's just an age of it's a ccle brother Gabe it's a cycle of of Revival and then death you could see the church on fire it was a Revival that swept the country but he said then it was death why because they organized and anytime you organize you will die and he said then he he said they made another image under the Beast a political power to bind the people of God to a Creed instead of being free to worship and walk in the light of their path they set back in that age and it just goes on and on and he said for the pergamus age but and the Philadelphian church he said that's another but you see regardless of how much they organized God moved right out in this church age anyhow well aren't you thankful for that tonight God moved on just the same see you can organize your religion you can organize your little group but you can't organize the word of God because God is going to open the light Open the Eyes of the people who are willing to walk in the light I don't care how much you organize it I don't care how much you try to take preachers out of the pulpit I don't care how much you try to say you've got a better way of having Church the way God God moves is the way the bride will move and she will stay right with thus sayith the lord well can you say amen and he said they just went right on he said they walk in the light that was shed on their path and they set them back again in that age and he goes on to talk some more he said he said then when w Wesley and Luther couldn't follow it because he didn't believe he was already organized back there and then John Wesley organized so tight they got to a place it was time for this church age now now this is the final Church age now now I know that within the age there would be a a an age within the age and brother Brandon would teach us that there would be a bride age but that would not but the final age is the layer to see an age so in this age is an age where the bride comes together and is called out but he he said like this he said we've been down through all these ages through here where it's neither light nor dark time but a cloudy gloomy day but right here as the light is shining just the same as it did there in the evening time can somebody say Amen it shall be light in this day there will be light again and in this day will will not organize in this day the Revival will not die in this day there will be somebody that will believe the full opening of the word listen church that no other Angels promised a full open book by a message of the hour but in this stage we have Revelations 10:7 to point to and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God will be finished and I believe we're part of the prophecy and we can believe what a prophet has said and the fullness has come in this day well I was wish somebody back me here tonight a little bit the better you pull the better I'm the quicker I'm going to get out of here I can promise you that and and so brother Brandon would say like this he said now what is this Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the Resurrection no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news of what he has raised from the dead has that become common to us because if it has I say we ought to not let the message become common to us but the good news is he has raised from the dead now it didn't stop there he said he raised from the dead and because I live you live also ye which were once dead in sin and trespasses God has quickened us together now listen we've moved on from the age to age experience but now we're in the fullness of time now we're in the fullness of the age where all things are coming to ahead all things are coming to into view as the Bible would tell us and he said God quickened Us Together by that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead and we are now sitting in Heavenly places with him no longer slaves but we're now Sons seated with the father well can you say amen he said he said communing with him talking with him what a joy to tell people that story that believes it to be the truth he said I'm wondering today what's happened are we really getting people to God or are we just getting them to a church listen Church uh my church ain't the only one going your church ain't the only one going I tell you what if we start denominating around our little church again we lose focus on what God is doing in this day this is not the only church I tell you what listen you say if it's just us and we start we don't want to fellowship with them because they're different listen what we've done is we've denominated oursel and we'll die right where we denominate ourselves but I'll say this open the floodgates and let us Fellowship a little bit because what we need is Brotherly Love in This Day what we need in this age is not to be picking on that church and then picking on us but I'm going to tell you right now I love them and they can love us we don't have to see eye to eye on every little thing but what I want to say is do you believe this message of the hour if they can agree on that I say you're my brother you're my sister I don't have to see everything cuz my opinion is not taking me in the Rapture Brother David your opinion is not going to take you in the Rapture but what's going to take you is the full revealed word in the heart of the believer and they will not turn to the right they will not turn to the left they're not bound to a Creed but they are free to walk in the fullness of the word for their age well can somebody say praise the lord well maybe it just excites me but the opening of the word excited me because it took me a long time in this message to realize that there is a full word there is a full restoration there is a full revealed truth that is on the earth now but I've just got to participate in it see the bride's Revival's been here the whole time ever since it began the bride's Revival came on the scene it'll never end and I tell you many of us weren't here when it started but the bride's Revival you are a part of it so we've got to participate in it I'm not willing to just sit in church and say well that was a good message or that was a good sermon I want to be free in the house of God I want to say with all that I've got in me say it don't matter what nobody says about how we worship it don't matter what anybody else would say who the son is set free is free indeed those who are free to worship those who are free to cast out Devils well come on somebody those who are free from complexes those who have been set free from from doubt and depression I tell you I've been there I've been I've had depression and I've fought doubt but I'm here today to tell you that when God sets you free when he comes on the scene there's nothing he can't do there's nothing too big sister Stephanie for my God why because he can take a broken person he can take a broken marriage he can take a broken husband or a broken wife or he can take a broken family and God is the god of restoration God is a God who can do the impossible God is still a God who heals cancer well why are the people dying with cancer well God's not you know what if it's your time I can't help that but God is still a God who heals cancer God is still a God who can come on the scene and he can I tell you what I've seen him do it I've seen him save and heal and deliver I've seen people young people come to into a meeting that were Bound by complexes and bound to pornography and bound to all kinds of filthy Devils I've seen them walk out of that building a different person oh it wasn't just an emotion but I've seen a move I've seen God do something and I watched their life and I tell you what I I think what we've done is we've let the devil take us right back to where our experience began and say but look what you did wrong I say forget those things that are in the past and press on towards the mark of the prize of the high calling I say let's have church a little bit and quit worrying about what somebody else thinks about how we have church well can you say amen I I say we can worship I'm free to Worship in the way that they call heresy I'm free to worship the way God wants me to worship I think we need to find our freedom again I know it's not all about shouting and running and jumping I know any church can do that but I want to tell you when you realize that the word has brought you this far and the word is going to take you in a Rapture the word is going to cause that body to change how can you sit there and not shout a little bit why because the word is still true and the word still has an effect and the word can still cause a woman that shouldn't have a child to have a child the word can still bring old people back in the house of God who look like they should have been dead the word can still bring young people back in this message listen we do not serve a dead God but we are serving a living God and this is an age where we have been set free you are a son of God you are a daughter of God in this age you are no longer a slave to fear you're no longer a slave to the things of the world I'm not well tell come on somebody we are no longer slaves you know the world would like to bind you to sports and the world would like to get you into a way where where you know what what the world would like to take you out but let me just go ahead and tell you something you are not a slave to this world you are not a Slave to the system because God has ordained you for a Time such as this to where you could break that generational curse well can you say Amen where you can say I don't have to be what my daddy was or what my mama was or what my great great grandparents were I I tell you what I don't have to go back and say well they were Sinners and you know they they were drug addicts and and they were they weren't Believers and they couldn't go to church no I'm here to break that cycle I'm here to say in this day is a time where I can be free from anything that the devil would try to hold me to well can the church say amen he said I'm wondering today it's what's happening are we really people getting people to God or are we just getting to the church that's a good question he says that's as far as we go he said that's good but it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to Christ from the church because we receive the quickening power he said we must receive the quickening power if we ever expect to be in the general Resurrection because it's the only only thing that will ever bring us from the dead well can you say amen he said for if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also Quicken and make he said bring to life your mortal bodies he said what a promise that is well can you say amen and he talks about victories how many's how many's ever had a battle in here before how many's ever had a battle then you know you've also had to have a victory you've also had to have a victory I thank God for the battles because it shows me that I can win the next battle because I just come out of that one well I I don't want to look at battles like like a bad thing and they're hard when you're in them but I've come out of battle after battle and I'm going to go into another one if I get out of this one but let me gohe and tell you something God is never going to leave you somewhere or put you somewhere that he can't bring you out of what can you say amen he said all these great victories was temporal victories even Moses he said Israel went right back into bondage again Always In and Out in and out we find it he said many Heroes did that they still do it in wars and the natural forces and I'm running out of time so I'm going to I'm going to go on down here he said but he said he said every he said man was made to live and no matter how many great achievements he did he still died and just the same and he went to the grave and they buried him and that settled it they marked his grave with a tombstone out there and that was it he said death swallowed him up he said that great Moses great Joshua the great prophets of the Bible nearly all of them except about two or three we know where their graves are at and where it marked them death swallowed them up and took them right out on see but one day he said there came a battle and there come the chief Warrior came down it was Jesus Christ the son of God and there was an Easter and that was the real Victory Day oh somebody say amen and Jesus had fought and prevailed well come on somebody he didn't just fight and Prevail for him but he overcame death hell and the grave he fought for you he died so that you could live again he died so that you could be free he died so that you would not have to live in bondage in this day can you say Amen he said the first thing he said when he was born he was born with a dirty name he was born as an illegitimate child and he fought himself right on through that and he said he said he said he he said when but in his heart he knew he was a Son of God he fought through that and he come to the day where he would make his decision of what he would do after he had received the Holy Ghost he come to the day that Satan took him up on the mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said I'll make you a king now you're the Son of God and you got power but I'll give you the rule of all the nations I'll make you ruler of all Nations he said just what the Antichrist is trying to do today he said but there was a victory day oh can somebody say Amen there was a victory day and he said he said then he said they said if thou be the Son of God and then there come a time when he was challenged by the word if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread and you're hungry now eat them see if you're the Son of God you can do that if you're the Son of God pull yourself off of that cross if you're the Son of God if you well they're unbelievers anyway and you cannot make an unbeliever believer no matter how hard you try why because their ears have already been deafened to the message of the hour now brother Brandon would go on to say this he said that's right but there had to be a victory day and he won the victory over that Temptation and now he they said now you can be a great person you can show yourself and you can go to the Pinnacle of the temple and and drop off and brother B said brother bam said it's written I'll give Angels charge over thee lest any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and bear thee up look at that Theologian that see look at that Theologian that Satan is oh he knows the scriptures better than anyone sitting in the building here tonight why because he was there to deny every word it was as it was written and he said now he said now Jesus would say it like this now remember everything Jesus did was to show what you can do now Jesus said get thee behind me Satan and he said come the word he said it was Victory Day he come to every Victory Day he walked up in the presence of Peter's uh mother laying there sick of a fever and the fever was raging her body and they needed service and he walks over and touches her hand sickness couldn't stand in the presence all sickness couldn't stand in the presence sickness can't stand in this presence sickness can't stand in your presence Brother David sickness can sickness has to leave that body that's been affecting you listen I know brother David's been dealing with some stuff in his head and his ears listen sickness can't stay any longer because the word of God that is in you will cast out that devil well come on somebody do you realize the power that you have sir you don't have to be bound any longer you can be set free by the word I'm running out of time so some want to hurry is that okay he walked out to the grave and pulled them shoulders back I've told this story a hundred times up here but he T he called Lazarus to come forth and he said that word went forth and it was the word of God life sprung on itself again back come the victim oh the victim and he said sure he won the victory that's right sickness Temptation everything that could be he fought through every bit of it exactly right right now we're getting somewhere so if you hang with me for just about 10 more minutes we'll be okay he said now he said when the time when the whole world was laying in Shadows and the regions of the Shadows of death every man every human every Prophet every great man all these great Heroes that they all laid back there Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and all of them and he goes on down I'm gonna skip some of this he said even to belar and all the rest of them said El who even tried to accuse them accuse them and tempt him in things and with the word and wife would come and job excuse me job's wife would come and say why don't you curse God and die to death and he said thou speakest like a foolish woman see job would not deny the word of God no matter what kind of a situation he was in no matter how bad the Temptation no matter how bad the struggle no matter how bad of a situation he was in God had for ordained him to be an overcomer for that generation and God went on down and and he told job he said he said down in the harness and he said job even went down in the harness he died a Believer Abraham went down to the harness yes Sir Isaac went down Joseph went down Joseph said don't bury me down here bury me up there with my father see and he goes on and he says that's the same thing in me that's the reason I want to be buried in the name of Jesus can you say amen for those that are in Christ will God bring with him you see when we find out on and on that the heroes and here come a time that the chief captain that sent him and they had fell on the field of battle great Victors they come to their Victory Day and they won the victory over their enemy Joshua had had won the Victory and he goes on and he tells about all these different Heroes here and he says I need he he said there needed to be light and God stopped the Sun for him one time and he said he fought he he fought and he said he stayed in the same place for 24 hours and weeded out every one of the enemies and brought them down and he said didn't give them a time to be mobilized again but see these were temporal victories these were not anything that you could look at and say well after we win this then the battle's over no no this was just a battle attle and a victory and a battle and a victory and a battle and a victory it was just over and over it's much like life that you're living sister Stephanie it's a battle and there's a victory and it's a battle and a victory sometimes it's hard to come to church but then sometimes there's victory in coming to church sometimes the devil will get you and he'll he'll just make you have such a miserable time in the house of God and sometimes you'll be so free I say we need to be free in the house of God we need to find our freedom again in the house of God we need to know that we can go in the house of God and we can feel the presence of God and if we have a sickness or we have something come up upon our body we can call out to God and he is there to meet every need God is still God can you say Amen brother Ram said now there's two more enemies that's the grave out yonder and he said then there's hell and he said so on that day when he died Jesus died so and he died so dead until the sun quit shining and the Earth had a nervous breakdown and the Rocks rung out of the hills and things like that he died and he went down into hell and he conquered death and he conquered hell and on Easter morning he conquered the grave he said you talk about a complete Victory Day a real Victory Day and brother Ram goes on down here a little bit farther and he said he said he said don't you know that that was a great time up there when they entered that Kingdom into the kingdom of God all these Heroes that were stuck in their graves and there was no way for them to come out but he said that there was a victory day because remember when he come out of the Grave many of the saints that were dead already come out of the Grave he said oh that must have been a great time that was a real victory for them because he said he brought out Abraham Isaac Jacob job and all the rest of them and brought them out of the Grave with him and he captured see he come to the Earth and he captured death and he captured hell and he captured the grave and he captured everything somebody say everything he captured everything and he said then he said what did he do he ascended on high and give gifts back to men what was it swords swords in their hand the word to conquer oh can you say Amen the word that you have Will Conquer every devil that will come against you the word that you have in your heart the word that you're holding in your hand I say take what's in your hand and defeat that devil listen we've sat in church too long with complexes and we've sat here with grudges against somebody for way too long I say it's time that we go ahead and take that sword of the word of God and cut that devil's head off and go on in Victory there's no reason to have a bad service because of a bad attitude you might as well just go ahead and let go of that thing and have church for a little while you might as well just go ahead and let go and let God have his wonderful way in the house of God he wants you to be happy he wants you to be free he wants you to live like little children he wants to be in your heart you just got to let him in well I wish somebody' say man God has given you the authority to walk on Devils God has given you the authority to cast out demons and all you have to do is just believe his word can you say amen he said he give gifts back to and see he said Oh my he gave them swords and and the Word was to conquer sickness and sin and superstitions oh can somebody say amen he said it was to conquer evil and to bring every living creature every living creature that wants to live bring every one of them to the realization that because I live you live also we have the fight of Faith let us fight good he said let us fight the good fight of Faith complete our victory for our complete Victory is positive can you say amen it sure is it's got to be we have the first fruits of it we have the evidence of it in our heart now because we've already got the first battle behind us we have been able to conquer through faith of Jesus Christ we've had our Victory Day oh come on somebody we've had our Victory Day we've seen what God can do we know that God is real we are not serving a dead God but we are serving a real God and I would say if the Holy Ghost comes on you then you won't be able to sit there but you'll have have to get an action and say I'm going to tell somebody about a living God who can still save and he can still heal and he can still take the broken and bring them back together again because God is still God and you are no longer slaves to what the world has I'm not a slave I'm a son I'm not a slave you're not a slave you're a son you're not a slave you're a daughter you're no longer slaves to fear you're no longer slaves to that complex the complex can't hold you you're letting the complex hold you you see the devil can't hold you but you're letting the devil have his way in your life you're letting the devil talk to you cast down that devil cast down the reasoning cast down imaginations and as brother Brandon would say cast down superstitions and walk on in the presence of God live a Victorious Life in this day that we live here you say how can we do it because we have the word we have the blueprint we know the way to get to a Rapture let's not be deviated over here and pulled aside over here let's not let's not fall to the Creeds of man and let's not go off on this side and say well I want to make a little ISM over here and a little Doctrine over here no I say I just want to believe everything he said I want to believe all that the prophet spoke and it's not because he was a prophet but he was a word prophet and I can take what he said right back to the word of God in the Bible see if he had have preached something outside of that word he wouldn't have been the prophet to come in the hour that we live in but this Bible was revealed to us the Bible became a new book the loose sins were tied up the things that we didn't understand we can now see in the Bible why because we're not slaves to man's opinion of the Bible we're not slave slaves to six Church ages of different ideas and and different things but what we are is we are now free to worship freely in the pure unadulterated word of the hour so I would say today the opening of the word has set us free the revealed truth in this hour has set us free I would say Malachi 4 came so that you could be free he could restore you all the way back to where you don't have to live in another cycle of Revival and death but he has restored you back to where you could be just like the original church and when the power of the Holy Ghost would fall on them oh they couldn't even speak English no more Brother David why I tell you what listen we need to quit worrying about what people think about us and walk on in the true word that's been revealed to us I believe this word is what's going to get us out of here can you say Amen I'm G skip way on down here and try to close shortly very shortly he said now listen he said he said look at Hebrews 11 there was just one nod of them Patriarchs from God and they subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness stopped the lion's mouth escaped the fire and the things that they done through faith by just one nod now he's talking about the heroes in the Bible just one nod from God and he said they done that through faith by just one nod just a nod you didn't realize the power you had on a nod but God has given you so much power that you can just point at that devil and he scared to death of you he hates to be exposed he hates to know that you know that he has no power over you what can you say man the devil knows it but he don't want you to know that he wants you to be scared of him he wants you to feel pressure from him he wants you to be in a world listen do you realize why the world's in the condition it's in because this is Satan's kingdom and he puts pressure on the people that's why there's neurotics everywhere and that's why there's people that are that are just literally a nervous wreck in this world I tell you what it even affects church people because Satan is so he's coming on so strong in this hour that when you get a little Freedom the devil wants to come and steal your joy what can you say man that's why we see churches that are sitting dead as 12:00 why because they're not really able to break through the cycle of Revival and death and they're trying to go backwards when this bride will go forward can you say Amen this bride will never turn back this bride will this bride will not point you to a has been message or a has been work but this bride will only point you to the things to come and it will live like it's living now and it will say look this is the this is what the prophet would say this is what the Bible would say and here it is coming to pass and we know that if God is doing these things he is able to continue to do what he's promised and we're not going to stop here and denominate around God s a prophet what can you say Amen you know people could do that you can denominate and say well we're just going to listen to his tapes and we're not going to go any farther no he wants men and women that are in action he wants men and women that are not afraid to stand where God has placed them positionally he wants men that'll stand in the pulpit and preach the message he wants women who will stay in their position and raise children to believe this message God still has a people that are still doing the works of God in this day well how do you know brother Joel because he has no hands but yours he has no feet but yours he has no mouth but yours this is an age where the bride has a voice and the bride has a Ministry what brother Brandon was asked the question will the bride have a Ministry before the Rapture he said yes it's going on right now but it'll be so simple listen you may not feel like you're much but God has called you Brother Bruce to a Time such as this God has called you to be a believer in this day and if God chose you for this time he is able to keep you until the Rapture and a body change can you say Amen brother brand would say it like this he said today God can send a preacher and Hammer that word as hard as he can and we go to sleep and get up and walk out he said no wonder we're walled in well help me Lord he said no wonder we're walled in he said I he said I know this is taped and it's going a lot of places you see all over the world but he says I mean to every he said I mean and I mean everyone yes sir he said return what can somebody say Amen return this is the time to return while the Call's coming I I I know this has been a little bit cut up tonight but I want to show you where we're at at now remember there was a cycle and it was a Revival and then there was a death and so they would be set free and then they would love that Doctrine or that idea so much that they would actually go right back into bondage again and and I don't mean this to be bad but brother BR would actually use it like this it was like a a hog returning back to the wall it was actually just coming out of something getting cleaned up and going right back to the same thing it's like a a Christian or you'll see a person come out of the world and they'll clean up and there's no more drugs there's no more alcohol but there's something on the inside of the Nature has not been changed they go right back to it now I'm not saying that that eternally separates them but but maybe they weren't ready yet maybe they just couldn't handle it yet but listen there will be a people who will not be bound by the things of the world there will be a people who when they hear the gospel trumpet they will be set free never to return back to slavery again I you know in the Bible they they had to be willing to give up family they had to be willing to walk alone but I say there is a bride here today that has the authority to say you know what I'm willing to walk alone but I'm not going to leave one hoof behind they're going to come with I'm not walking with them just so I can be closer to my family I'm not going to walk in the world just so I can have fellowship with Darkness but I'm going to say I'm going to walk in the light as he is in the light and then I will have fellowship with my father and then those that are called of God they will come in line they will come to the message don't worry about your family don't worry about your kids don't worry about anybody that's out there listen if you'll stay walking in this message God will bring the those in that are meant to follow this message a God is not going to lose one of them God is not going to lose you he's not going to lose them but I would say tonight let us not stay in bondage let us not stay in fear let us not be be bondage to the world let's not be bound to the world but let us come out of the world and separate ourselves and come into the message of the hour I say if you hadn't been hearing the tapes I say you need to be hearing the tapes again if you're not reading your Bible I say read your Bible again I say if you haven't found your freedom in the house of God try raising your hand once in a while I say if you haven't said amen in a while try saying amen once in a while God will set you free by the word of God can you say amen he said yes sir run return He said yes sir these sign my time's up musicians can go ahead and come he said yes sir return this is the time to return while the Call's coming yes sir these signs shall follow Sons not slaves how can you say Amen these signs shall follow Sons not slaves this is what a prophet would say to return in Jubilee 1962 these signs will follow Sons not slaves not bondsman not servants but Sons you're no longer a slave church but you're a son and daughter of God you have the authority to speak the word of God in this day you are no longer a slave to fear you are no longer a slave he said listen and I want to say this real quick just before we close he said these sh these signs shall follow he said now and no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's right you might say you do but the Holy Ghost has to vindicate it and prove it listen church I'll leave you with this you are no longer slaves to this world you are no longer slaves to fear put a name on it you're no longer slaves to depression you're no longer slaves to that devil that's tried to hold you back with a disease you are not a slave to anything that the devil's got because God has stripped God has stripped him of every legal right he thought he had over you you have been set free can you say Amen oh somebody ought to find their freedom here tonight quit letting that devil hold you back quit letting that devil tell you you're not good enough quit letting that devil tell you that you don't need to be in the house of God God has put you here so that you can find Freedom let's stand to our feet God wants you to know who you are it's a new book it's a new day he's no longer calling you slaves but he's calling you a son brother the Jeff he's calling you Daughters of God sons of God you are sons of God you have been positionally placed by the message of the hour the opening of the word has showed you who you are you couldn't see this in a denomination you couldn't see this without the opening of the word but in this day you can see who you are and we're not bound but we're a free people you're free to worship you're free to to do listen come on Church you are free from everything that's holding you right now every complex and everything that's coming in your mind telling you well well I just I I I just don't want to be here right now listen you're free from that if you'll just let go of it right now you're free of it listen you're free from it all you need to do is say Lord I Surrender I Surrender this body to you I'm no longer a slave I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of god sister Stephanie where you've been cannot dictate where you're going the devil C listen the devil's going to show you your past time and time again he's going to show you everybody who started and everybody who would fall but God is not going to leave a people on Earth that can't make it all the way to the end but he has a group of people that are getting ready to leave this world he's got a group of people brother Joe that are not going to stay here when the bombs are falling you've been free from going through the tribulation you've been free from serving other gods you can serve God and him alone can you say Amen this is your day of Freedom this is your day of freedom I would like to ask you every one of you to Bow your heads and I would say this I won't hold you but I would like to say this if there's one person in here who feels like they're still being bound I say this is your service to let go and let God remove those things of complexes we've seen healings Among Us we've seen things move among us we've seen God reel right here in this church but time after time we let the devil come right in and try to take us back where we come from but God is not a God God is not a God that goes back on his word but he always keeps his word can you say amen amen with your heads bowed if you need prayer you're welcome to come tonight I'm no longer a Slave To Fear I am a child of God oh I'm no longer slave fear I am a child
