children to be dedicated and i spent some time this morning in the sunday school class and i wanted to tell you what their questions that they had for me they had questions about ghosts they read in the bible about how that he gave up the ghosts jesus gave up the ghost and and how it would say that and one said well can you see ghost and another one said well i get scared thinking about ghosts and and so the sunday school teacher called me in and we went back there and tried to answer those questions i tell you what that's a hard class that's difficult but jeremy can tell you sister sandra

being a pastor has been able to do this and you end up in all your all of your photos i'm sorry about that children are a blessing from the lord and the bible said blessed is the man has his quiver full so maybe we've got a few more to make a quiver but and god bless the duckworth family we're glad to have him with us aren't we what a blessing amen go ahead [Applause] let's bow our heads heavenly father we're so grateful to lord be able to dedicate little isaiah matthew duckworth lord we we can't do anything but present him to you lord and then it's his parents to dedicate his life and train him up in the way that he should go i pray you would give them direction lord and strength i pray a blessing over his life may grow up lord if you tarry to be a minister of the word a preacher of the gospel or some help in the church lord lord we know that there's a future as long as these children are being raised in christian homes lord so as long as you tarry may we continue to do this lord i pray you'd build a hedge of protection around him and his family may sickness never come near them lord we give them back to you we don't know lord what the future holds but we know you hold it and you hold our children lord we have a promise if we train them up in the way that they should go when they're old they won't depart from it lord so we thank you for that we pray you bless lord this little baby this family lord we commit them to you into the hands of the almighty lord for your purposes we pray in jesus name amen and god bless you [Applause] i always get a little bit scared holding the baby like that and that one he's a little bit of a chunk i think he could he's not it doesn't feel as breakable as some of them do so you love the lord this morning amen do you love one another amen it's good to be in the house the lord this afternoon we'll have a memorial service for our sister jean cook and so be here if you can for that i know some of you can't be but if you can be here for that that would be wonderful there will be others that will be here with us and in memorial of her life it'd be a good thing for the family and brother robert being such a big part of the church and sister gene as well and appreciated her faith i didn't know her until she was older but i appreciated her faith she believed she was going to be healed and she is today and so we're thankful for uh the healing for our sister would you stand with me revelation chapter 19 and verse six i want to continue to speak to you on how the bible is right why the bible is right and the foundation of our faith and kind of go then a little bit different direction this morning we'll just see what the lord does i won't hold you long i'm going to try to stop about about noon so you'll have time to go out and eat and then our dinner today will be after uh after the service tonight amen revelation 19 6 it says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice that's the hour that we live in church let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen as the righteousness of saints i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word let's bow our heads together for just a moment if you have some special need maybe on your heart and in your mind would you raise your hand to the lord god bless those hands heavenly father we're so thankful to be in your presence the art as we've done these things and we've talked to the sunday school we've heard the singing lord in our children how it thrilled our hearts to see them lord asking questions and then singing lord we've dedicated the baby lord and now today we turn our attention to your word lord we know these things have been done in your name but lord now would you just allow your presence to settle down among us lord as your word is preached i pray that you to hold me lord keep me from saying anything that's against your word lord and that i would only say those things that you'd have me to say lord i pray for these needs that were represented by way of uplifted hand i pray you'd meet every one of those needs today that you to help them lord in all of their life we pray and we ask it in jesus name amen man god bless you you can be seated the bible is right we believe that today the bible is right that is the foundation of our faith we do not have a faith that is not grounded or settled but the bible is right you might be in the worst trouble of your life you might be in a situation where it's hard and and it's difficult and there's struggles all around you you might be like we preached about jonah in the belly of the fish but yet you can say this morning the bible is right and because the word is right because jonah believed that what's what solomon said when he prayed there in the temple that was written in the scripture and he believed that and when he believed that it was effective in his life and when we believe it it is effective in our life we must have a foundation for our faith without a foundation everything is negotiable and when you begin to negotiate with the devil you get in trouble when you begin to bargain with the devil like eve did and he said surely you won't die and she began to bargain with him surely it don't mean what it says so when she began to bargain with him over the clear revelation of the word what happened is she ended up in death and despair and everything like that but when jesus come he was the word and the antidote to the argument over the word was the reality of the word walking in shoe leather and i'm so glad we had a god who didn't just give us a theory he didn't just give us an identification and say well that's the word he wasn't just a theologian but he was god in flesh and that's what we want to be today we want to be the holiest we want to be god in this hour that part of god in flesh living in our generation amen now little messiah is walking along little little word if we could say it that way walking around the world that we live in as the children said today and they said well we talk to kids at school and they don't believe they don't believe we try to tell them but they don't believe i said you just live it and live such a life that that they will believe and and and some may never but if there's a predestined seed out there somewhere they'll they'll grab a hold of that it'll be a light to them maybe they won't ever read the word but they'll see your life our faith has its foundation on the inerrancy of the word of god that's everything and brother branham taught us that that gives it a perfect resting place amen aren't you glad that you have a perfect resting place today and that perfect resting place is not how i feel it's not my emotion it's not my it's not anything else but it's the perfect resting place is the word of god so we find it in the scripture that abraham journeyed and just to kind of background this for a little bit before we move on abraham journeyed and he looked for a city with foundations the bible said he looketh for a city which has foundations in other words a city that's stable a city that that is set on something and we find in the early church when they came that they were built on the same foundation ephesians 2 19 says you are no more strangers and and foreigners you're not wandering around looking for something with a foundation but your fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone so now he said this is the church's foundation he said well the church is built on the rock of revelation that's true what is the revelation of it's a revelation of jesus christ who he is who is he he's the word amen a revelation of the word is everything to us you can't overstate the importance of the revelation of the word of god so now as we realized then as we go through the church ages each one was identified with the foundation when you come in revelation 3 and 12 to the laodicean church ages he said him that overcometh i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out this is the philadelphian church age he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god i will write upon him my new name notice what he says i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god but branham said in other words part of the foundation i'm going to make him a pillar you ever heard the saying he was a pillar of the church what does that mean part of the foundation part of what makes it stand and he said he that overcometh i'll make him part of the foundation what will i give him i'll put in him the doctrine of the apostles and prophets from the beginning give him the revelation what the prophets say about him he's counsellor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father and everyone who's a part of that foundation says the same thing what do we look at last week how that every book in the bible we could look at the old testament and see in every book who he was how he was the will in the middle of the wheel and all of those things that we saw in each one of those books what was it what was that we can look and we agree with the prophets we we have a revelation the same revelation that they did and we become a part of that same foundation what they said about him we say about him counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father healer deliverer are you with me now that makes you part of the foundation oh i this is good this morning i'm not saying that because i'm preaching i'm saying that because it's the word hey man i'm saying that because i get to fellowship with you good people and feel the presence of god and the joy of the lord being our strength today even in times of sorrow amen well he said what will i give him i'll put him in the doctrine of the apostles and prophets he said that's what they said the prophets and the apostles and he that can overcome all this synagogue of satan keep himself free and look straight to the gate i'll make him a pillar i'll put him back in the foundation of my word in the house of my god he said i'll put him right there in that pillar in the foundation where you stay right in the word oh my you don't move something that's been put in the foundation our future home has the same foundation revelation 21 and 14 it says the wall of the city had twelve foundations in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb we could contrast that with the beast in revelation 17 which ascends out of a bottomless pit a pit with no foundation notice revelation 17 8 he was ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition what is it what is the bottomless pit it's there's no foundation for catholic doctrine remember that that catholic church that beast rose up out of the bottomless pit he said there's no foundation for catholic doctrine there's no bible for catholic doctrine listen any doctrine that does not come from this bible come out of the bottomless pit right that's where it come from is the bottom there's no foundation but we've found a city we've found a christ who has a foundation he said in the volume of the book it's written to me amen it's something with a foundation we are not a cult we are not some kind we are christians today we are believers in the bible we believe that god does what he said he would do we believe he's the same yesterday today and forever we stand firm on the foundation of the scripture yes sir hallelujah amen there's no bible for any of that but there is a scripture for for what we believe and there are it's the entirety of the word of god we find that he was the word and then his wife the wife that was described in our in our text in revelation 19 she's different from others because she's a bride of the word she's going to a city with foundations notice where she is going what she is wearing and how she wears it in revelation 19 of 7 he said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready i want you to watch closely now and put your thinking caps on and as we go through this it may be just a little different maybe than what you've heard but i believe it's the scripture and the message of the hour now the word is come it could be translated has been completed the marriage of the lamb has been completed it is completed and as i begin to think about that i begin to think you know what is she getting ready to go to now when we think about this scripture i know as a child i would look at this scripture and i would think well there is an application of it to that i would think well you know the bride she's getting ready and so she wants to dress correctly so she shows up at the wedding in a proper dress so the groom will accept her now and if you think that way that's that's kind of how i thought about it but think about it not you know i loved my wife's dress but i didn't care that much about it maybe i shouldn't admit that after 16 years but she she wore a white dress and we still have it it's yellow now i think but it's it's still there and and in in a box in our in our storage and you know and i i won't go there but it's not usable anymore and in any way and so it's just sitting there and so now uh you know but i didn't care so much about that but danny she did she wanted a beautiful dress now why did she want a beautiful dress she wanted to present herself to me in a certain way she cared about it oh god she cared about she wasn't going to gain my favor based on the dress that she wore because she'd already gained my favor now notice what it said go back to that scripture the marriage of the lamb has come the bride is now the wife and the marriage supper is about to be served now he said the marriage of the lamb has come his wife has made herself ready what wants to say his wife right he doesn't say his is engaged right has betrothed his wife amen the bride is now the wife are you with me this morning and if you begin to think deeply about that you begin to realize that it's not me getting ready and dressing myself in the word so i can then go and maybe i'll be maybe he'll accept me but see this wedding started a long time ago come on amen he this ceremony has been going on a long time because he slipped his wedding band to predestine unmerited grace on me before the foundation of the earth come on are you with me now and in this age the marriage that was was was finally come together we're now his wife and we'll talk about that in a moment but but now think about what that does because it's not me going out here and attempting to please him enough to get in his favor to gain his favor right that's not what i'm here for not to please him enough so that and many times we think that way we think legalistically we think well i'm going to do all the right things and i'm going to gain the favor no you don't gain his favor by dressing in the word but you dress in the word because you've gained his favor he already put the wedding band on you are you with me this morning where is she going she's going to the marriage supper amen how do we know that verse 9 he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god now brother branham picks that up at the end of his ministry he said in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together he said the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man he said not a clergyman see it son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us will make his word so real that it'll oh my aren't you glad he did it in our hour he said it'll make his words so real amen he said that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper he goes a little further he says she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage he said fill the uh the flesh of the mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come he said but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person oh my the word here unites with the person they to become one now watch and that's what we want that's what we want we want to become one with this word how many believe that today what does it do then it manifests the son of man again yes and this is the part now listen to me if you're waiting on brother branham to come back and and manifest the son of man again so that you can then put your dress on get ready and be dressed in the word to be ready for a rapture you've missed it you've missed the entire message that's what the message was yes come on it'd be like you you showed up late for the wedding and you're waiting on the preacher the preacher was already here amen the clergyman already stood there and he stood there for the bill and he and he said here's the groom here's surprise let's unite the two together come on oh god oh my and i had a brother pointing out to me the other day actually last night i was talking to a brother and he said you know when brother ran him in the breach he begins to talk to him at the end of that he said now by the power invested in me and he began to talk about it like that and i believed that god was doing something he was uniting he was using the language of a wedding ceremony uniting what was it the bride with the groom the marriage of the lamb has come let us be glad and rejoice this is the time for the celebration are you with me this morning we're not going we're not sitting there worried and scared well maybe he'll accept me maybe he won't i've i got to get my life just right so he'll accept me no you you already chose him before the foundation of the world you're his bride you belong to him the marriage of the lamb has come yes and his bride has made herself ready but what's she what's she dressing for now the wedding supper think about it what she's getting dressed for again my my wife wear just about anything i'd be okay with it just about anything long as it was decent she cares oh god i hope you hear it today she cares what she wears you brothers know that you take your wife out to eat at a nice restaurant she cares way more than you do even about what you wear go to one of these banquets you know if it was up if it was just men in the church that made all the decisions you know i know i know that men are in leadership but if just men made all the decisions we would never have banquets we would just all go over and eat together and it'd be all ages and then and we'd sit us men would sit together and tell hunting stories and we'd be there in our camo and and and all of that and and the reason we have banquets where we dress up is not because of the men it's because of the desire that a woman has in her heart to present herself in a certain way not for somebody else or you hear me today she's got a desire in her heart to present herself to her husband that's my desire today that's why i want to have church the way he taught us to have church that's why i want to have a a church that that is like that first church i want to i want to see a bride presented to him clothed in the word not because i have to do that to gain his favor but because he's already given me his favor he slipped his wedding band on me i'm married to the word so i want to be dressed in it what is that i want to apply it to my life because every bit of it's true my foundation is on it let me apply it let me live it but that frees you then from the the worry and the fear you don't get dressed for a banquet out of fear are you with me now i'm gonna miss it how could you miss it you're his wife the preacher already came and went i'll wait on the preacher to come back well the preacher was here none said the wedding vows for those who would do it for those who would believe it oh god look she's getting dressed for an event and in doing that she becomes it manifests the son of man again not the church theologian the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing you say oh son of man ministry son of man ministry but what's happening today son of man ministry in the church that's what brother branham taught us the church does the same thing now watch the process of courtship engagement preparation all of that is over that's the church ages think about it she's his wife now and they without us could not be made perfect because this is marrying time so there was something that took place in this age but even when we get there it won't be well luther you know he did certain things and he believed certain things that were not right but he's going to say the same waiting supper that we do because of us right because we complete it and so it's imputed to them who only had light for their hour because we followed the light for our hour right they without us could not be made perfect now so we're getting dressed up for an event the process is over we're his wife oh we could get a revelation of that today you say well i don't i'm worried i need i need to know who i am you're his wife you belong to god and no matter what happens around you your marriage might shake your church might shake the world might shake politics might shake everything that can be shaken will be shaken but you're going to stand why you're married to the word that's your foundation amen you belong to the creator of the universe you're his wife you you belong to him and you're anxiously see how that changes the mindset you're anxiously waiting preparing for that wedding that wedding banquet in the sky and it is the wedding it's the last part of the wedding but you're already married hallelujah amen now after the vows have been made and the ring is on her finger the veil is on his shoulder but the reception in heaven is about to begin now it's still part of the wedding that began in his mind before the foundation of the earth and we're now waiting on the marriage supper we are already amen we have the mechanics and the dynamics brandon taught us the dynamics already here right we have the mechanics in the dining we're not waiting on some revival to give us the mechanics and the dynamics they're here he said he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest let's see how we live in it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh you've all heard it before but now listen in this context this is who you already are not she will become flesh of his flesh she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power he said well i haven't become that you just walk in that word today walk into that light become that yourself as an individual this is marriage time she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him not she will be him she's going to be him she is him glorious man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken the spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife glory she is mechanics and dynamics that's why we don't settle for a dead church we don't settle for dead religion we don't settle for emptiness and doom and gloom theologies we settle for only for the word the word is right somebody's wrong the black church and i thought of that last week when i was preparing those sermons the black church used to sing a song they said i know the bible is right and the congregation says somebody's wrong that's right because a lot of people are not following the bible but i know the bible is right somebody's wrong but the bible is right i may be wrong but the bible is right amen that's how i'm married to him i become one with the word amen and i can only do that by the message of the hour now watch and we'll continue on that now hold that in your thoughts as we move on she was chosen in him according to according to ephesians 1 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love we were chosen there yeah say well if i get dressed in the word i'll i'll i'll finally be chosen by him you were chosen there he slipped the ring on you there i want you to watch this morning as we kind of move away and we'll come back but jesus first miracle was performed at a wedding reception i've often been puzzled by that seems almost meaningless but brother branham actually had an answer for that he shined light on that scripture let's look at that in john chapter 2 and verse 1. it said the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee the mother of jesus was there listen nothing happens in your life by accident there's a purpose and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage now back then if you were called if you were invited it was more than just getting an invitation in the mail is today but it was a great dishonor to the family if you were invited and didn't come so jesus and his disciples were invited to this marriage the bible said blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb now watch john 2 3 and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto them saith unto him they have no wine no she wasn't expecting to go buy wine she knew who he was she said they have no wine jesus says in her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour has not yet come his mother saith unto the servants i love how she didn't even respond to him that's how mothers do right she don't even listen mom what are you doing i said mom and mom looked at me what are you doing they have no wine jesus said woman what am i going to do with you his mother his mother said the servants just do whatever he says glory hey man she believed and so he does an odd thing he takes water now the water was there for the purpose of making wine right that's where they got the water there was water there but they didn't have the grapes and the process of making wine out of it they may have had the grapes there in the water but it takes longer than that to make wine right so they would have gone through the process of making wine and so he has them pour it in the wine the water into wine vessels if you go down to verse 9 it says when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and he saith unto him every man at the beginning does set forth good wine he said this is great when men have well drunk then that which is then that which is worse so in other words what they're doing is they get them to taste the good wine and they'll say well the wine at that wedding was so good and then after they've after they've drank enough wine that they can't tell the difference right then they water down the line that's what they did it was a very common practice they watered it down until there was almost nothing in it so and so they just continued whenever you were running out of wine you just add water to it but somebody forgot to add the water and now they're panicking they're out of wine jesus doesn't add water to existing wine because this wine was better than the original wine glory so now what does he do he says thou has kept the good wine until now and it said this beginning of miracles did jesus in cain of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him now brother branham taught us that this miracle spoke of the resurrection this miracle done at a wedding supper spoke of the resurrection now think about it he said he is god you fail to see who he is he's the unchanging god he said i'm glad i got faith in him tonight that someday when my life my body with its 16 elements will be back in the dust of the earth now listen i told you last week i'm more certain when i bury a saint in the ground that i'll see them again than i am that i'll see someone if i tell them i'll see you later at the house because lots of things could happen between now and then but when we commit our loved ones to the ground we're certain we'll see them again because the bible says that we will right and so now now this is a type of the resurrection now watch he he said it's six feet elements will be back in the dust of the earth but he will say william branham and i'll come forth oh god he will breathe the breath of life into it say there you are he will bypass the birth through my mother and so forth and you find different places where brother branham taught this it's not just one quote he said like jesus on his first miracle he turned water into wine eventually it would have been wine but he bypassed all that procedure oh glory oh my and said turn the water to wine so he said at the resurrection he will not say mr and mrs branham get married again speaking of his parents and bring forth william he will speak and i'll come forth how many believe that today he will speak and i'll come forth that's him he's god so he was showing oh god that he could take something bypass the process and make a resurrection of the wine are you with me now he's bringing a resurrection and he'll not say you know go get married and come through the natural process but it's in a moment and a twinkling of an eye at the last trump we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed are you with me now yes now watch now we take this this wedding supper that's where it was done at listen there's going to be a moment and a twinkling of an eye i can't explain every bit of it but i know this i'll see my loved ones and then we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye now watch again i don't want to get into the detail say well this happens first and this does but i do know this it'll happen in an instant and it's a sudden secret going away of the church so there's not going to be a warning or anything like that it has to be that way that's the way the word says in such an hour that you think not that's the hour that the lord comes now watch as we begin to look at that you begin to realize when that happens the water is changed into wine and we'll find ourselves at a wedding banquet oh god we find ourselves what at a wedding maker what are we doing now getting ready for that banquet oh god he said well again i'm afraid i won't make it i might miss it what wife would say that she's not saying well i if i don't dress correctly my husband's going to kick me out of the car you don't have a husband you have a tyrant we don't serve a tyrant that's right are you hearing me this morning we don't serve a tyrant we serve jehovah god to become a man become our bridegroom and type you understand now watch he is our bridegroom he loves us he's already committed to us and we have committed to him we are not making ourselves pleasing to him in order to be married but we are making ourselves ready our overcoming is not in making ourself working our way into a position of being able to call ourselves bride that it's a misconception that's not how we overcome we overcome because we are the bride we're not working our way into position of being able to be called the bribe we're already his wife his wife made herself ready why did she make herself ready because she's going to a banquet amen she wants to be pleasing to him not because she's afraid that he'll say something derogatory to her right not because she's afraid that the preacher will get up on sunday and preach on a short skirt so she she gotta wear them she don't she wants to dress like the world does but she's afraid hear me peter messed up the title this morning and peter i'm not picking on you this morning and he had uh i actually called this uh uh dressed in the word and he put it dressed in the world and it's just a little bit of difference there that'd actually be a good title but it sounds like a dress code sermon and that's actually not what this is at all our dress code is the word men and women alike are you with me now but we don't go around saying oh you know what as a preacher you know if he knew what i did then i'd be in trouble and you sit in condemnation all the time you don't know who you are you don't know where you belong why don't you just let go of that become the wife of the lamb let go of that condemnation and that worry and that strife just become his wife say lord i lay my i put the i put the authority on you i put the responsibility on you i'm giving it to you i don't care what the others might say they may laugh and make fun of me i'm going to dress in the word because i'm going home to the banquet glory i've already been i've already been there i hope you hear me today i've already been intimate with my my husband i've already he's i've already felt the kiss of eternal selection i know what it is to be his bride to be redeemed i'm not worried that he doesn't love me are you hearing me today you need to get that revelation now not try trying to work your way through it you're ready now you want to please him not because the pastor might say something or somebody else might i want to do what's right because he wants it he desires it not because he would say something but i just i want what he wants yes are you with me today we're we so we dress ourselves in the word now watch she has dressed herself in the provided garment to her was granted she should be reading fine linen and clean and white for the fine linens the righteousness of saints contrast that with revelation 17 3 here is a woman who calls herself the bride of christ right revelation 17 she calls herself the church the catholic church the universal church and all of her daughters they're with her denominational daughters he said i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and deck so she was dressed how she wanted to be dressed you hear me today she was dressed how she wanted to be dressed she was at a banquet but not his she's seated at a table she's drinking the wine but not his yes are you with me today yeah she's dressed how she wants to be dressed we don't get to pick and choose how we have church it don't matter if you say well nobody believes it like that so and so believes it differently it doesn't matter we don't get to pick and choose how we have church we don't get to pick and choose whether or not there are preachers today we don't get to pick and choose whether there's healing today or not we don't get to pick and choose whether there's salvation today we believe the word you believe the word today we don't get to pick and choose how what we should do but we go to the bible amen and then we take that we begin to apply it now watch the fine now here's this woman and i'll skip down to revelation 18 and and 16 how the merchants were weeping and wailing and over this woman that was there and says that woman was clothed in fine linen just like the bride was and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls so she had the fine line and she said oh i believe the word and everything else but the bride was only dressed in the final inning clean and white you remember esther when she'd come before the king i told you christ is in every book of the bible book of esther doesn't even mention god but esther herself some type of the bride and she's standing there and she tells the chamberlain i'm standing there he said what do you want what do you want to be dressed in to go to the king she said i'll trust you i'll trust you to know what the king likes i'll trust the word amen to know what the king likes i'll trust it to know that that's what he wants she just dressed herself simply in whatever was provided to her that's what we have to do we must stress ourselves in the provided word and not because we we're gaining the favor of christ but because we've already gained his favor the bible said his wife has made herself ready at the end of the age how did she make yourself ready to becoming his wife he said what is she what kind of a garment she had on his own word she was stressed in his righteousness now think about it for just a moment before we close what what are the essential things that you need other than address to be ready to go out and eat and just think about it well if you if someone put you in a room and gave you a garment to put on what are the things the essential things that you would need two things one of them i've got to get in that back room you know what it is a mirror all right you got to have a mirror to dress properly you'll end up like me and your collar is always over your over your coat and there's a reason one is my neck is so big and the other you can laugh at that that's fine and i can't find a shirt that'll fit and the other one is that that i don't have a mirror on the door and so i'll come out sometimes last minutes you know doing something and and i put my my coat on last and the caller comes up over it brother joel has to make motions and do all this try to get me to do it to put it down i'm glad he does that but you know you know what you need a mirror but if you put in a room there's one other essential thing that you need you can't get dressed without it well you can but you shouldn't light what do you think i was going to say light think about it i'm so glad there's a man here that can turn on the light we're put in the room here we are with the garment how are we going to how are we going to dress in this word you can't do it without the message of the hour are you hearing me this morning the message is the light of the hour you can't be dressed in the word oh god if we just understand it today you cannot be dressed in the word without the message of the hour because listen when they'll be there at that table with us luther and luther's day they could not be dressed in luther's message without luther's light are you hearing me wesley say they could not be dressed in wesley's message without wesley's site pentecostal age the same and in this age we cannot be dressed in the word for this hour to go home to the banquet unless the light of the hour shines on the word the message is absolutely indispensable are you with me today it's not the bible but it's the light in the room that lets us put the bible on because the bible laid there for 2 000 years and it laid there and men had all kinds of opinions but a prophet come out a simple kentucky hillbilly that may be beyond what you can believe but i believe that god is a supernatural god i believe god called john the baptist out of the wilderness wearing camel's hair and eating locusts and drink and wild honey but he was god's prophet god called the kentucky hillbilly out of the hills of kentucky and he come to shine light amen he was not the bridegroom but he pointed us to the bridegroom hey man in the present stage of my ministry brother branham picks it up and he you remember the vision that was there you go back and listen to it he told the vision about his ministry how he was there was the hog lot remember the hog lot and then and i'm skipping through it just to jog your memory but then there was his tabernacle and then he said this is not your tabernacle he showed him the fruit trees planted in buckets and all of those things how his ministry would be stand between the oneness and the trinity and he showed him and the voice spoke to him and said second timothy 4 1-5 and so he began to read it and it's second timothy 4 1 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing and his kingdom preach the word amen be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come and they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things and do reflections do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry brother brown said he always stopped there but he went on in that sermon to tell the rest of the story which is kind of sad if you think about it because he's nearing the end of his ministry brother branham knows it and this was in 1962 i believe it was just right before right before brother branham goes into the opening of the word and so he begins to preach it yes september of 1962 and he reads the next verse he said always read verses one through five the next verse i'm now ready to be offered the time of my departure is at hand and so brother the random says there must be a crowning as there was a crowning of paul's ministry even though it looked like his ministry was over yet he's in he's writing philippians in jail writing about joy i want to get into that at some point it's wonderful he writes that from jail count it all joy and how we should think and how we should be and so and it's the crowning of his ministry it's the third poll of his ministry but now he he realizes there must be a crowning to his own ministry and he said you see it's at that time when men forsake men god's servants that stay true to the word god seals their ministry with a crowning time yes oh god i hope i can get through this now by 12 o'clock and i'll let you go he said i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision that happened down there on the river i've stayed true to it he's been true to me i'm trusting in him someday i don't know when for a crowning of my ministry he said i've stayed just as true as i could be i don't know what it'll be i don't know when it'll be i just when he's ready i am i don't care he said i hope he i hope i love this he will crown my ministry of this now he didn't say of of going and and people recognizing all oh this is brother branham and becoming oral roberts or building a big school or doing something like that but he said letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word for his righteousness i hope he will crown me let me stand on that day and say behold the lamb of god oh god that takes away the sin of the world he said okay well we'll just wait on him to do that what what have you been doing what have you been studying all these years brother branham then in in the feast of the trumpets he said the bride must step out of the way to go up now so the two servants of god in revelation the two prophets can appear upon the scene the sound the seventh trumpet to them make known to them the christ the seventh angel messenger and watch they behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he said i hope that my crowning would be to dress so bright in the word by saying behold the lamb of god are you hearing me today here he stands and says behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world not behold my methodist my baptist my pentecostal but the word what is he doing showing us who the lamb is picking him out of a crowd john had to identify him pick the lamb out of a crowd there was a crowd of people they all looked the same but john identified him he said behold the lamb pointed him out to the people and brother branham identified the word in our hour the word amen the word of the hour and he looked at it he said behold the lamb behold the lamb the open book in our hour taking that takes away the sins of the world amen not my baptist my pentecostals but the word the son of god the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world for no other foundation is there you believe that today amen he said how long have we got the jews are in their homeland the bride is called yes oh god go you have to meet him the bride's called she's now his wife you realize what howard we're living in everything just exactly what he promised we're ready we're ready so then 1964 we're ready the hour is here amen you come into a dark age a layer of cnh here was the garment here was the bride she's seated in that dark room and she don't know how to dress herself she comes out with the tag turned around messed up can't see tears on her face trying to get ready and here comes the man who can turn on the light and flips the switch that's what the message is behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world yes so brother branham after reading the scripture musicians go ahead and come he reads the scripture the bride has made herself afraid he said so there's going to be a meeting in the air one of these days in that sweet sweet by and by just stay ready stay ready keep yourself ready you've been made ready by the word stay ready keep yourself ready purge your heart from all evil thinking have faith in god notice where he takes he said all evil thinking but thinking immorality things like that's not what he's saying have faith in god no matter how dark it looks how many laughs and makes fun and says you've made a mistake keep right on living holy and living for god just keep moving on the hour will arrive what are we waiting on the marriage of the lamb in a moment in the twinkling of an eye will turn the water into wine bypass the process and we shall be changed do you believe that today do you want to be ready i believe that you can be ready by the word today just walk into it don't be scared but there is going to be a meeting in the air and a sweet sweet buying by and will sit at that table thousands of miles long we who have put on the word sit with our brothers and our sisters in anticipation waiting as he comes by and the bible said he wiped every tear from our eyes oh glory he's our husband it's not his fear but it's in anticipation of that moment i'm not afraid when someone dies it just makes me more anxious in anticipation lord i wanna i wanna be home while i'm here let me be a pride dressed in the word let me keep the light on oh god let me keep the light on as devils try to come by and turn out the light let me the light's been turned on in my let me keep it on let me keep the message burning the fire burning let me let me stay in the holy ghost and the fire of god let me remain set your desire this morning let me be alive and remain not just to be living but to be alive and remain at the coming of the lord to be one who's in anticipation ready waiting the light's on i'm dressed just waiting on the time he said here comes the bride and all the attendants stand up and the angels stand at attention and here she goes into that heavenly place he said brother ben you really believe that i really do really do i trust that you do as well maybe in your life if you can just bow your heads for a moment maybe in your life you've went through a lot and you've struggled to put on that dress let the light come on just let the message of the hour be be the light that shines and then just put it on apply it he said what part of it should i apply but have been all of it all of it all of it from my attitude to my the way that i live the way that i dress the way that i act how i go to church the joy the peace the all the things he's given me it looks good to him it's beautiful to the groom he purchased it for me let me put it on maybe you're that way today you just kind of struggle with that and say well i'll just never be worthy he already counted you worthy before you ever made the mistake before you ever did the sin he counted you worthy to be his bride why don't you accept that today just believe it and move on in your life put on the armor of the word put on the dress of the word it'll keep you from every fiery dart of the enemy heavenly father lord i pray for these with their heads bowed today oh god we want to be ready lord
