God's grace gra on releasing of God's power thank you Lord some things that the Lord's been dealing with our hearts for a little bit so may the Lord just richly bless you each and every one of you tonight Hebrews chap 11 verse1 says now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not not made of things which do appear by faith a will offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by this he being dead yet speaketh but by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was found because God translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him amen can we just bow our hearts one more time tonight Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for an opportunity to come and worship you Lord in spirit and Truth Lord we're looking forward to what you have in store for us this evening father we pray now Lord that you'll come and minister to each and

heavens open up Lord let us be willing to receive Lord we believe this is special times Lord that you given us as children of God to come to the house of God Lord God and hear Lord The Word of Life Lord God not a dead God somewhere but a living God that's resurrected living and ruling and reigning right now in our lives Lord we're the we inhabit you Lord God in this Tabernacle called flesh Lord God and Lord we're allowing that to take over and bring this body under subjection to you father we pray Lord God we commit this time into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you this this evening and you can have your seats we're so thankful tonight to serve a God that's so mighty he's a mighty God he's a warrior he's he's all knowing he's all powerful brother Danny he and uh and and often times preaching and and looking at different things you know combing through the message taking time and uh there's one thing about our God that he's all powerful he's all knowing but he's also all present he's omnipresent he's here and and you know we've heard the prophets say those things you know what good would it be Brother David if he was a God that had all power power he was a God that had knew all things but he wasn't present and but I thank God tonight that we serve a God that's all powerful all knowing he's present here tonight and he's he's not a god way off in the Milky Way somewhere brother Joel but he's actually a God that's he been been in our past working in our future living in our present and he's got everything under his control nothing happens listen friends I I believe this brother Ben that that that that God is so far head of the enemy before the enemy ever thinks of a tricked and trapped and try to make in your life God's already knows what he's up to and amen that's a mighty God there's nothing that and I've said this many times we can never put God in Checkmate he's always a step ahead of the enemy and that's what kind of God I want to praise tonight amen I believe and his anchor that he's placed that is sure and steadfast in our hearts it's unremovable it can't be broken it can't be taken away from as an absolute of the Soul Heen it's not here today and gone tomorrow but it's an absolute it's here the weather every storm every hard time every grief every sorrow amen anything you as a Believer may go through listen friends God has placed something in the Holy Ghost that's going to take care of every one of your needs and if you go by the way of a grave They Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down either amen why because it's him it's not about who you are who I am or who brother Ben is or who brother Harvey is it's but God rich in Mercy yes sir it's God rich in Mercy it's not what I can do it's not what even our pastor over here can do but it's God rich in Mercy yes sir don't you love him what an absolute but I was thinking out this here here in Hebrews that if it was impossible to please God without faith what is it tonight if we had Faith cuz there's thousands of promises in the word of God and there's thousands thank you Lord of promises laying there brother Ben you care to get my Bible off the desk I've grabbed everything but my sword I'm in trouble tonight that's what these iPads will do for us and you know that's the first mistake I ever made in my life you believe that thank you brother Ben now I'm ready bud I don't even I've got everything in my notes but I don't like to come out here without my Bible and U I was getting excited back there hearing songs of Zion and and uh pacing in the spirit back there if you want to call that brother Ben but there's thousands of that's what made me thr I just going to lift my Bible up said there's thousand of promises in the Bible amen that's laying here for believer but without a way to release the power to bring it on the scene what happened what what good would it be yeah if we didn't have something that could release a power to bring it on the scene for you and I tonight and just like that day that night rather the in Egypt you know there was something there was a power release when they applied the token upon their their homes that no matter how hard the Death Angel tried he could never penetrate what a Believer did he obeyed his obedience to the word of God the voice of a king there was power behind that voice and there was a liberty behind applying the token of the doorpost of their homes there was a peace inside of that home that passeth all understanding and and I I thought about these things as I was thinking on these lines of of releasing of power a been what good would it be to have a God that gave all promises but he didn't give a way for a Believer to obtain them amen and I'm a firm believer tonight amen that for me and my house we're going to praise the Lord and amen if I come to church I want to praise the Lord amen if we take worship out of the church amen what kind of church do we have I tell you tonight we have a dead church we have backsliding children backsliding homes you take the fire out the pull pit what do you had backsliding homes backsliding children but thank God we have men of God in this last day doesn't care what what the world says or what other churches says but they come with one mission is bring the fire of God down in the Tabernacle once again that with enough power to burn the chaff out of our Lives burn the unbelief out of our lives make US soldiers Hallelujah my brother Ben that's all free this morning I I don't know if you let the preacher up here or not I had even got to my notes harly but God's good to us tonight amen Mark 9ine tells us Jesus said unto him if thou C believe all things are possible to him that believeth we remember when when those 10 lepers came unto Jesus they was begging him have mercy upon me we were beaten down we're bruised we're defeated we're discouraged and all Jesus said to them it says go down and make yourself known unto the priest and the scriptures records here brother Allan he says as they went as they begin to take God at his word and moveed by faith it unlocked something it released they power amen that leprosy couldn't hold them any longer oh I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if it worked that way yesterday he's going to work that way tonight as well amen if we take God at his word all they did is take a step of faith can I have somebody say tonight I'm going to make a step of Faith tonight as they went they was cleansed from leprosy yes sir thank you Lord yes sir they was cleansed no matter how long those demons held on to those those men when faith unlocked the door oh yeah it released a power come on it released an anointing that leprosy just wasn't comfortable with right and from that point it didn't have the Liberty to hold on to them men any longer oh I say he's the same God tonight he said that's true brother says anywhere that you meet God's requirements there's where you're saved anywhere that you meet God's requirements that's where you are healed he says and if you don't meet those requirements then the blessings and Promises of God is none effect to you so faith faith brother Brown preached the message called faith is the victory that overcomes the world Faith brings him present on you realize that tonight church that your faith can you say your faith tonight your fa brings him present right oh thank you Lord Brother we make a statement like this Faith picks up God's binoculars yeah come on and it all it's determined one thing it's not look at the goliaths or the Lion's Den or it's not looking at the circumstances of life Faith is designed to pick up God's binoculars which is the old and the New Testament right Heen and he sees every promise that he made and Faith sees it out there and Faith chooses that over what the circumstances is or what the present tense is Faith is the six sense amen it's the power to embrace faith brother B says it like this faith is that little whip that you have on your side amen and he said brother Ben he said if you allow it it'll take you to to your possession it'll take you to your healing it'll take you to your deliverance if you will just allow it not the preacher amen the preacher can be all anointing he can be amen but if you're not willing to use your with this morning or this evening amen allow it to take you to your promises amen I'm telling you amen you're going to be discourage they didn't sing the right song he didn't preach the right sermon but I'm determined God's got it all in control and it was the right song it was a right sermon it was the right message yes sir come on on and he gave it to you as a six sense than do you believe it this evening that this is the hour of Mountain Moving faith it is right come on not for just a minister but for you that the scripture say you speak the word you speak to your Mountain yeah I believe this message of the hour has equipped us yes sir God has sent a message and this message will deliver listen brother Joe God's not holding us back come on somebody he's not holding us back tonight yeah I'm here to tell you you're going to get what you come to expect if you're not expecting heaven to open up it's not going to open up to you you might a a ain't it an odd deal Amen brother Ben that you'd have uh uh someone walk out of your service this morning and tell you brother Ben that is the best I ever heard you do you know you knocked it out of the ballpark and and then you would have two critics after the service or get together and talk about how bad he done and he shouldn't have said that he should have said this or he should have done that and and been out of the same service am been and the critics said well God wasn't moving in all but the other side man they would say man God opened up heaven and God begin to speak through the pastor and he begin to speak to my needs and he begin to he begin to pick my mind he begin to talk about a conversation I had with so and so few days ago and what was that was God moving in your behalf and another person cross the ow from you can be sitting there as cold as a cucumber Heen not receiving anything but it doesn't stop God hallelujah I'm determined tonight I'm determined as a as a minister if no one wants to back me it ain't going to stop God's move I'm still going to preach God's gospel I'm still going to preach the Bible I'm still going to preach this message sir yes sir Hallelujah cuz God's not holding us back yes he said faith is that little whip on your side and it will take you to your possession then brother Brown says if you'll let it how many how many tonight would say I'm going to let it tonight I've been fighting this battle a long time and I I i' Satan has talked to me long enough that I forgot I have a whip on my side amen I forgot faith is in my [Music] presence now brother R says now you as a Believer he says go to Satan and say give it back all right listen to what the prophet would say he said Satan give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possess of heavens and earth and he says and I'm a Heir it's mine Glory I felt air to it it's not who I am it's what he is hallelujah he says give it back Satan listen he says Satan cannot hold it if you as a Believer go to him with the scriptural authority of the word by faith yeah and say praise God it's mine and he says lay it down he says amen glory I like that Satan you lay it down now he begins to demonstrate it he's telling you how to overcome and now he says now he's going to do it himself he says Satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back to me because I'm serving notice on you lay it down he said that's gets him started but let's don't get him started let's get him running tonight lay it down because I come with the scripture Authority I am a believer all right Hallelujah and every place the solds you your feet can set upon by faith God gives it to you and the bride says it's yours it's yours possession faith is the key and Christ is the for yeah that's right brother say faith holds the key that unlocks Christ and reveals him Faith oh God gives it to you come on God gives it to you it's yours thank you Lord you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it up to you you'll see what I mean the power is controlled by you are Son of God how many sons of God we have in the house you are Son of God you are a daughter of God he says that never leaves you all right hallelujah it's with you all the time thank you Lord but your faith gets away from it but it's still there oh Hallelujah he says we are saved God gives you Faith to raise from the muck of the earth thank God for resurrection power Heen that faith has caused you have a temporary Resurrection it caus you to resurrect from the things of this world the muck of the world all right you was a liar you was a cheater you an adulterer come on somebody every one of us was at one time or another because we all came to the world the same way Hallelujah right wonderful but God gives you the faith to rise from the muck of the earth he says your faith overcomes the things of this world what is your faith your faith is the act that God had did in you to make you a Son of God you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith come on your faith raises you above it if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith you're saved and through Grace as much as your faith will be released oh yes amen sister Stephanie that how much Faith your faith come on is released he says that's how much power you can have Hallelujah so I say tonight don't blame it don't blame on brother Allan don't blame it brother brother Ben or brother Joel it's your faith tonight it's your faith that releases the power come on the same faith that lift you out of the muck of the world and made you a son and daughter of God is the same Faith that's right there tonight thank you Lord that's good it's right here tonight because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth amen God dwells in you you're the habitation of God God dwells in you who would ever thought it God dwells in me am been the maybe there's a lot of people around our area would have never thought but God dwells in Me God changed me God changed Rahab God changed me I was adulterer I was a liar I was a thief but God rich in Mercy men couldn't change me churches couldn't change me a religion couldn't change me but God rich in Mercy has the ability brother Joe to change me from the red nless to the suime Hallelujah in you God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God he says there you are but it's your faith he says another place says when the believer and God gets turning together amen that Devil's in trouble when a believer in God gets turning together brother Brown says it generates in other words it releases the power amen it generates he says the power of his resurrection no wonder Jesus say I have power to lay my life down and I have power to raise it up or lifted up again release in the power of his resurrection when a Believer takes his word in their heart come on oh and begins to generate in other words something begins to move something becomes alive it brings forth faith when a Believer and his God gets mooded together didn't he say one time one place brother Ben he says nothing can stop or prevent a Believer going to meet the promises of God he said he said what the most powerful weapon is not atomic bombs or nuclear bombs it's not it's not Russia he said the the powerfulest weapon is a believer in contact with his maker amen because when a Believer and his con his his his God begins to move in the same direction oh my that's when that scripture we read all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah something's moving and he says he says that's what it is when a Believer takes a word in the heart it begins to generate bring Faith everything is in line oh yeah he says the only thing that you have to do to get electricity is push the button that's all you have to do with the scripture is supposed to be fulfilled now is press the button everything is ready come on my we've had a messenger in this age came and tied in all the Loose Ends yes sir everything is in line church it's we're not waiting another Messenger to come no sir we're not waiting on return Ministry we're not waiting on a tent somewhere I say we are that tent we are the inhabitation of almighty God we are read Epistles read of all men we are his victory we are Spirit of his Spirit life of his life power of his power all right and brother B says she is him right yes sir Hallelujah thankes and all we got to do is press the button not push play and stay home from church but push the button that releases the power of almighty God Heen you know why somebody got a blessing this morning cuz somebody was pushing the button the are all electricity is here the capability of overcoming is here come on the capability of receiving healing is here it's already been paid for they they had Calvary he paid for it said it is finished and when he ascended up on high he tied in those lens them lines and sck back a electricity power that can change these vow bodies oh come on come on with the same power oh Hallelujah and we hold it we hold it the key brother Brown says we hold the master key that unlocks every door remember Pilgrim's Progress I believe it what was his name Christian and hopeful wasn't it yeah they got caught up by the enemy and got throw in the The Dungeons of unbelief yeah they tortured them they they I believe it was they caught him on a Wednesday and there was three or four days rocked on and one of them begin to realize says I don't maybe he was praying maybe he was singing songs of Zion maybe he was just praising his God in the midst of a bad situation all right oh thank you Lord but he begin to think you know what I've got a key in my bosom that hangs right over my heart and hoper said what do you mean Christian I mean to tell you this key unlocks every door of the enemy I stood here this long under bondage and all the time he had the key of the liberty and freedom Hallelujah and he went down and he took that key and he begin to open the door and he walked on in amen every promise everything that was keeping him bound everything that was keeping him not praising their God that was keeping him under such bondage of legalism [Music] [Applause] oh yeah but he said but I'll never do any good for either one for your healing or salvation until you accept it as your own personal property he says and then it comes into effect the word effect means the power to produce the results or make something happen come on good they was getting beaten they was getting made fun of they was getting talked about and all the time they had the key right yeah but when they came to a realization no this key is mine and it has the power to unlock any door [Music] GL the key is what it that key is designed is somebody hearing me this evening that key is designed to open up Christ open up his word open up his his gifts open up his Deliverance open up his healing the key has the power yeah come on to release God's benefits for you and I tonight sir why sit here and be defeated why sit here and be discouraged let's go down to the enemy's camp and take back what belongs to us it ain't the devil's anyhow he's lied to you he told you you couldn't have your children hey but but he's a liar tonight he says there was no hope for you but he's a liar tonight don't you love him let me finish this quote he says you say it isn't affected to me he says maybe you're leaving them on words on the pages come on pre maybe you're just leaving them on the page or the book yeah on oh my but if there's promises in the book oh yeah and God's given them to you remember he said I wouldn't have told you to come if I didn't make a way for you to make it he would have never told Peter to come walk

woman which had an issue of blood 12 years has suffered many things from many Physicians has spent all that she had and wasn't nothing better but weather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came and pressed behind and the pro in this age says she she might have lived way up on top of a hillside somewhere and there she was she wasn't able to walk she wasn't able to run she wasn't hardly able to make the journey but she said brother bar would dramatize it out and said you know she be to crawl she went through a lot of obstacles she went through a lot of circumstances she went through a lot

fire away he just took the heat the very element to destroy those boys he took the heat out of the fire and brother said he allowed the fire to just keep burning on but it look like an uncross

and says Be not Afraid or dismayed oh yeah by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but it's God's oh that changed a lot right there amen they seen what kind of God he was in Moses and Abraham and they've heard about all the stories and now God has giv them a visitation and begin to tell them don't worry about this great multitude come on don't worry about this Goliath

conquered and the battle's not yours enter into his gates with Thanksgiving oh yes and they toship a that OD come on to worship and the the and they're facing the greatest battle that they ever seen and they get to begin to praise their lord brother B it says sister Janie with a loud voice they were worshipers G they was sounding with a loud voice they was singing they was worshiping they was praising sounds like a good Revival doesn't it sounds like a good meeting when everybody uh is getting ready for a great move of God a great brother being calls in a great man of God that's been preparing for months and our expectations is high yeah you know he he he don't have to say much and moves the people why because their expectation they're singing louder they're praising louder they're worshiping louder they're singing louder I just believe this was that type of Revival they was down there expecting God to do great things and they begin to sing and they begin to praise their God oh yes and the Bible says sister Jackie that they came down God came down and set ambushments against Mount seir and Moab and the children of Aon and yeah Ma they turned on one another they begin to destroy one another yes sir and this is this is my interpretation of it take it or leave it you can leave if you want to come on but I thought they was down there and they heard a lot of noise going down there brother Ben but I just don't believe they could see it just like it you know and and they could hear a lot of things going on but they didn't know exactly what was going on down there what is the Lord doing what there a walk of faith and and then some times elaps and Judah came down there and cl climbed up the wat Tower come on and Judah begin to look over and there was dead bodies laying everywhere yes sir and Judah begin to scream back to all the children of God down there Hallelujah don't be dismayed don't be discouraged listen your enemy is dead Hallelujah you know what kind of energy they brought the children of God they might not could see it with a natural eye and we've had a messenger in this hour has screamed out in our day and screamed out your enemy is dead sir all right yes sir and it energizes Us by faith and we rejoicing tonight oh thank you Lord hallelujah and it took him what what was it brother being three days of taking up the spools of the enemy my you talking about a Revival they went down and then you know they wasn't eating good they didn't have much of well Jess they didn't have much to talk about could you imagine Judah tell them said go down

underneath her messenger and our messenger said you can do it hallelujah hallelujah don't listen to The Devil's lie the Revival isn't over you're the Revival yes Revival is not a special meeting Revival is you yes sir come on prach come on brother R tells about the story I've got a really hurry come on they tell a preacher don't talk about time nobody worry about it but I I don't believe that's true brother Tim was preaching our meeting down here and uh on Sunday believe it was Saturday I went in the back room said brother Tim you need anything he said no just about two hours okay then he got out there and he said Sunday morning said you know what by the time I'm done today I'm going to look like a pizza and then when he got to the IR and so Mark he said you know what I'm probably looking like two pizzas but brother an would tell a story well it was actually uh something that happened in his life so there a testimony on the wings of a snow white dove and he begin to tell about the time I'm going to make this long story short because it's a powerful story and he begin but Sam he begins to tell how that the spirit of the Lord came to remember he had that stomach problem he wore for many many many years and he said you know and he he talk about that squirrel how he would jump down his mouth and tear his stomach up and the spirit of the Lord told him to go to the cattle in the mountains when he got to the the top and the spirit of the Lord told him to stop and he stopped and I'm paraphrasing and he said when he stopped and and he seen a squirrel den or something and he said all of a sudden out of that squirrel den here come that gray ugly looking squirrel he came down and came and jumped and hit his chest this time I hitting his mouth bounced off his chest hit some Cactus and the spirit of Lord wheed out of there and said your enemy is dead and brother Brown goes back to the doctor amen they run the X-ray to tube down his throat and they come back and tell Reverend William brandham I hate to break this to you your stomach is withered it's reached the point of no return you'll never get over this you'll always have this problem this problem will follow you all the days of your life oh God's always a step ahead of the enemy God knew exactly what that doctor would see in his stomach but before the doctor ever tell him God already beat him by prophetic gift and told him says your enemy is dead and brother Brown said you know I would have been a discouraged boy if it had not been for the vision glory to God and I feel the same way tonight I would be a discouraged boy if it had not been for the vision hallelujah hallelujah we might fall we might make mistakes but the SC but he said get back in line who's he talking to believers who was he witness is the Bride of Jesus Christ to let you know you might make mistakes you might fall short you might hide for a season but I'm going to find you brother Cody you ran for many years but God had a predestinated moment of time says oh he thinks he's going this direction but I got this oh that's my God and when he gets a hold of you he changes you he covers you with his Precious Blood and that blood becomes a bumper that blood becomes a life that changes you thank you Lord and when he looks down through the blood of Jesus and through your the red sins brother BR says he sees you brother Cody as white as snow hallelujah oh isn't that beautiful tonight thank you Lord Jesus and he echoed in our hour he says your enemy is is dead it's a perfect setup he trapped him at the Red Sea brother said was a perfect setup brother B I believe brother Joel you believe this thing's rigged come on somebody this thing's rigged he's way ahead of the devil yes sir devil gets a plan go come on come on brother Allan said one time uh what was it Pharaoh had a plot but God had a plan that's stuck with me brother Allan all these years you know God had a plan before Pharaoh said you know what we need to trap them down by the Red Sea you know we need to we need to get on their tracks and know God said man you know the children of God they begin to murmur and complain a little bit but God said I got this I've got this I wouldn't have called you to a Promised Land if I didn't if I ain't got this I'm telling you it was rigged brother says a perfect setup cuz when God's children begin the cross and the pill of fire came down and then they roll back the waters yeah and the wind of Yahweh came sweeping down through there and dried up the ground that those mud dobers didn't have to walk on mud any longer walked on dry ground I'm telling you we walking brother a been on on a road to Victory those things that kept us bound those mud that heavy down our and weighed us down is no longer on they're behind us oh you talking about a Revival could you imagine it was a Revival as they got over there to the other side Hallelujah this is all free tonight I probably ain't going to get done anyhow so I'm just having a good time come come on hey they got down there and they crossed over the enemy side you know here's our chance God moves back the very Bearer that was holding them in position away from the children of God moves away they begin to all charge toward the enemy and God said know there looking down through the pill of fire with Angry Eyes yeah I've waited a long time right I knew this day was coming I know they didn't know I know that they was waiting on it but I knew this day was coming and I was going to defeat their enemy once and for all and he goes down and he takes off the wagon wheels and they run their wagons into the dirt and they tried to run but it's too late that last Soldier crossed in to the other side and brother Brown said that that that W that pathway wasn't made for unbelievers that pathway was made for believers and when unbelievers got in the path and God's Believers stepped over on the other side and Mar gra the to dance and scream and holler and run and shout and praise their God and worship why because they been getting to look back and all the task Masters that beat them made fun of them are now struggling for life and all of a sudden they heard the same word we heard your enemy is dead GL Glory it was rigged I'm telling you church tonight God's got it all in control he's got politics it's where it's at God knows where it's at God knows exactly who's going to be the next president God knew exactly who would be the next Pope God's got it all in control cuz we're serving a God that's been in our past working in our

Hallelujah and tears from her eyes of worship Pi a drop on the Master's feet hallu Hallelujah and brother Brown would make a statement like this yes she was breaking up there party oh Hallelujah to
