Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. Heal my heart and make me whole. Oh Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. She glad you come on a Wednesday night and believe that if you ask you shall receive. So if your prayer is Lord pour your spirit out on me, then the Lord can do that. And we're so happy to have brother Andrew here tonight. We had him scheduled originally for this weekend. It didn't work out. And then um you know I felt kind of bad about that, but the Lord I think just arranged it. He said he was coming tonight. So I said, "Well, why don't you preach then?" &gt;&gt; Amen. And I knew a bunch of our folks would be gone hunting, but we've got several folks from Brother Mats. Thank you all for coming tonight. And uh, you know, on a Wednesday just makes you feel special when you see fellowship like that. I know you just got done with meetings and it's hard to go to five or six services in a row and then show up on Wednesday night. But thank you for coming. You're real troopers. And uh, it's good to have Sister Mariah and Malachi and is it Haven? I tried. Isn't it Haven? I have to. My wife's doing this. So good to have them. Haven hasn't been to church here yet. So glad to have that addition. And uh she's somebody's got her back there. It's good to have each one of you. Uh Malachi fell and hurt his leg, but the Lord's healing and helping him. And going to get that cast off soon. So we just love the uh brother Andrew and his family, the Glover family. And it just I remember a Wednesday night a few years ago when we were really needing a breakthrough and the Lord just come through. Maybe a crowd's probably much smaller than this one tonight and but the Lord just really moved in a mighty way and he can do that. He has a way of doing that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you just present your need before him. I know there's real needs healthwise and uh some folks that called me today and said they were unable to be here because of sickness and things and we just believe the Lord's going to heal them tonight. And those that had to stay in the stream and even those that are in the deer woods, God can go down where they're at, too. So, we sure appreciate all of you. As brother Andrew comes, uh remember our fall festival on Saturday. And y'all are welcome to come. Anybody that's able or wants to come and and fellowship with us. Won't be no church on Saturday. Just uh uh food and fellowship and games and things like that. And then on Sunday, Brother Shawn Martin will be with us. And we're looking forward to seeing him and his family uh this weekend. Amen. Let's sing that again. Pour your spirit out as brother Andrew comes. Pour your spirit out on me. Oh, make it your prayer tonight. Oh, saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. Fill my heart and make me whole. Oh Lord, I need you now. [Applause] [Music] on me. Fall just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my heart again. Fill my heart &gt;&gt; and make me whole. I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Amen. How many believes this evening he's able to do that? Amen. There's one thing about our Lord. If you're if you're hungering and thirsting for more of him, prophet of God told us there's an evidence there's more of him for us to receive. And &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe here tonight there's a amen group of believers here tonight that has not come full of themselves, but they've come empty and amen with a lot of room to receive more of him. I tell you, I all I want is more of him. Amen. And I was listening the other day to an old sermon there of brother Biscll preaching years ago and he was talking about some visitors there in the service. I believe they were from Uganda and uh they would stand up while he was preaching and they would use this certain phrase and he said they just say it and sit back down. And he said, "Come to find out it meant 3* 7." And he said, so he went to him after service and he said, "What does this little phrase you all are using mean?" And they said, "It means keep it coming. Keep it coming." And amen. And he uh got to preach and he stopped and he said, "Lord, keep it coming." And I I believe that's the way the bride is in this hour. Amen. We're just asking, Lord, keep that revelation coming and the power of God moving. And Amen. It is a real honor to be here tonight with you. We want to thank you, brother Ben, for this opportunity to be here tonight and speak to the church. And amen. Always enjoy coming this way and seeing our friends here and being with brother Ben, his family, and brother Joel. And amen, as it is Haven's first time to Hardy. So, amen, we're we're thankful to have her here with us tonight. And do want to uh thank you all on behalf of our pastor there, Brother Matt, and the Saints at Grace Tabernacle for the support of the meetings last week. And brother Ben, we do appreciate you bringing the assembly down there. And I know you all believe this missed your Wednesday night to come be with us, and that means more to us than you realize. And we really appreciate that. and appreciate the the arm of fellowship and Amen. Good to see all the folks here with us tonight from the church that came and Amen. I I know uh there's a lot a lot of folks may be out tonight, but there's one thing I do know. I know that we're two or three are gathered in his name that he made a promise he would come and be with them. And amen, it is sure good to be here tonight. Good to see you, Sister Karine. God bless you. Amen. How how'd you get here? Did you drive or Amen. Amen. That's a we was in a meeting one night. in Louisiana. And I asked her how she got there and she said, "Well, I drove." Amen. Or ask me how I got there. And I said, "Well, I drove." So, every time we see each other now to meet, we just say, "How'd you get there?" Amen. But it it's sure good to see Sister Karine. We sure love and appreciate her and brother Phil. And Amen. We want tonight before we open the word, maybe just bow our hearts for a word of prayer. I know it's a a Wednesday evening, but I know the Lord is mindful of all the needs among us. And maybe you just slip your hands up and say, "Lord, come by my way tonight. I I know he's mindful of every need." and he'll speak to every heart. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we've gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon, Father, we've not gathered here to be seen or to be heard, but Lord, we've gathered here to do one thing, and that is to lift up the name that is above every name, and that is your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. For Lord, at that name, Lord, demons have to flee. At that name, Lord, spirits are broken. Father, at that name, sick bodies become well. Father, at that name, empty vessels are filled with your very presence and spirit. So Lord, we've come here tonight to speak the name of Jesus. Lord, you see every hand that was raised here tonight. And Lord, behind that hand, there is a need. Now, Father, I pray that your great anointing would come among us tonight. And Lord, we'll be sure to lay aside the cares of life and the situations, oh God. And and Lord, we'll be sure to entertain your anointing, Lord. For Father, it's the anointing that destroys the yoke of the enemy. And Lord, I'm asking you, Lord, may you come by this way tonight in a special way. Father, as you have seen, Lord, those that may not be here tonight, some at home sick, dear God, or maybe we'll go back and hear this sermon. I pray, Lord, that you would reach a hand of deliverance down to them, Lord. Maybe in their body right now suffering with symptoms, oh God. Lord, we rebuke those symptoms in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May they leave the body of the believer, Father. And Lord, we pray tonight that you would come among us in the preaching of your word. Lord, may you may you give us wisdom and revelation tonight in your word. And we'll be sure, Lord, to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. It's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we want to go to the book of Hebrews, the 10th chapter. The book of Hebrews, the 10th chapter. Amen. It is is an honor to to be here tonight. Really enjoyed that song service and Amen. just the presence of the Lord. Hebrews the 10th chapter uh tonight. We want to look here in Hebrews 10 and also Hebrews 11. Uh those of you from home are going to have to forgive me. Uh you might hear this a second time, but amen. In Hebrews 10 and verse number uh 35, Paul here writing, he says, "Now cast not away therefore your confidence." I I love how Paul makes that personal. He don't say, "Cast not away confidence." &gt;&gt; But he says, "Cast not away therefore your confidence." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. Which hath great recompense of reward. Also want to turn over to Hebrews 11 and verse number six. Hebrews 11 and verse number six. Paul again here writing in the great heroes of faith chapter in Hebrews 11 and 6. He says, "Now without faith it is impossible to please him." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; "For he that cometh to God must believe that he is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Amen. He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. We ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word. As you can have your seats here tonight from those uh verses of scripture, if I would take a title tonight, I want to talk to you for a few moments on this. There's a reward coming. Amen. There's a reward coming. 1963, the prophet of God is preaching, God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him. He said, now there is a coming blessing just as the same as there is a coming wrath. He said, oh, we have to be looking for one of it tonight. You either have to be looking, amen, for the wrath to fall upon you and for destruction or either you have to be looking for the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. He said the same God that promised one promise the other. So there is a promise, amen, of a coming wrath which will bring a destruction. But then there is a promise of the resurrection. Now I I've just recently been studying and speaking here out of Hebrews 10 on casting not away, amen, your spiritual confidence. And when you when you look there at that spiritual confidence, it is a deep unwavering belief and trust in the higher power in divine wisdom. He says now that resides in one's own soul. It means to provides inner strength and resilience to navigate life's challenges. Amen. Spiritual confidence is not pride or arrogance. Amen. But it is a humble conviction that is rooted in one's connection. Amen. to something that is greater than oneself. Amen. Spiritual confidence leads to peace and love and a fearless approach, amen, to life's uncertainties. I I wonder how many tonight could testify that life is full, amen, of uncertainties. Whether, Amen, it's in the natural life or in the spiritual life, the world we're living in, Amen, is full of uncertainties. I I think it's powerful there that another meaning of spiritual confidence is actually, Amen. spiritual revelation. So when one has amen, a spiritual confidence, they have a spiritual revelation. Now I love there what Paul says. He says, "Cast not away." Amen. Therefore your spiritual confidence or your confidence because there is a recompense of reward. When you look there at that recompense of reward, it is a repayment. Amen. Or a compensation that is given as a reward. And it is often for good actions, faithfulness, or service. Amen. Amen. I want to begin tonight by saying this. We are not serving God simply. Amen. For a reward. Brother Brandon said, "If I am condemned when I come up before the judgment seat of God at the end time, if it is planned that way and I have to stand in his presence and he points his majestic finger at me and says, "Depart from me." He said, "Now, if I keep this same attitude that I have now," he said, "and I be in hell, I will still love him." See? Amen. He's just. I deserve to go there at the first place. And if I knew that I was going to be condemned and know now that I would be condemned at the end after I worked for him a 100 years from now, amen, I would still desire to work for him. He said, "If there would be no heaven and if there would be no reward, I still want to be a Christian." Amen. I don't know about you, but that's my testimony tonight. Amen. If there's no heaven and there's no reward, Amen. I still want to be a Christian. He said, "It's just a perfect satisfaction. It's something." Amen. That peace, it just passes all understanding. He said, "I wouldn't trade it for nothing. I've tried everything that I was big enough to do and a lot of things I wasn't big enough to do." He said, "I tried anyhow, but I've never met anything that filled me to perfection." Amen. Nothing had ever touched the borders until one night. Amen. Jesus Christ come in this poor Irish heart of mine. Amen. And it made me a different person. Amen. I wonder how many can testify that same Jesus. Amen. Came into my heart. And when he come into my heart, he filled me. Amen. With the perfect satisfaction of his presence. And there's nothing the devil can do. Amen. To change the love of God that has been revealed unto my heart. My when I think about God's rewards, I I'm happy to announce to you tonight. Amen. They are not temporary. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God gives a reward, it's an eternal reward. The prophet of God said, "All too little time, amen, is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of God." He said, "The recompense of God is too lightly esteemed." If we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal kingdom of substance, then we ought to lay up in heaven those good treasures that are available to the faithful saints. Amen. That's my desire is not just to be a church member. Amen. My desire is not just to go to church and amen punch a religious time clock. Amen. But my desire is to be a faithful servant unto God. Now, if I'm going to be faithful, that means the devil's going to be after me. Amen. If you're going to be faithful, that means the devil is going to be after you. And the prophet of God would show us, amen, that Satan is not only working, amen, but he's working overtime. Amen. What he's trying to do is he's trying to knock the spiritual confidence out of you, amen, that God has instilled in you. In 1959, brother Re's preaching on Elijah the prophet and he says, "Now watch after your Mount Carmel." Amen. You're going to have a juniper tree. Whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God pours down and does something for you, he said, "Look out." Amen. Satan is on that track. Amen. How many can testify of that? Have a good Sunday. Amen. But watch that Monday. Amen. Amen. Have a good Wednesday, but watch that Thursday. He said, just remember the next day. Amen. It's going to be a hard thing. Amen. Because he's going to do everything he can. Amen. To knock that confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before. Now, it is very important to note, amen, who is instilling the confidence. Right. &gt;&gt; If a preacher instills the confidence, then a preacher can take it away. But my Bible says in Romans 15:13, Amen. that the God of hope would fill you. Amen. With all joy and peace and believing that you may abound in hope, amen, through the power of the Holy Ghost. Listen, this is not just a preacher showing up on Sunday and showing up on Wednesday feeding you with the things of God. But this is the Holy Ghost of the Bible. Amen. coming down in manifestation and power. Amen. Filling your life with joy and peace and glory. My I say the Holy Ghost has instilled. Amen. The confidence in you. Amen. I love that word instill. It means to gradually but firmly establish. Amen. An attitude or an idea. Amen. In a person's mind, amen. I say the Holy Spirit is here tonight. He is here to instill in our hearts the faith that was once delivered unto the saints. I love what a prophet said. He said, "I pray God that you will instill in our hearts," Amen. the power of the resurrected Jesus. He said if the sick person can ever meet God, that no matter how crippled you remain, how sick you remain, how blind you remain, you ever meet God, Amen, there's something that sinks into you, Amen, that you don't see any more of the circumstances, but you look at what God said. Amen. God could ever get a way down to the cares of life into your heart and instill a faith there. He said, "Then there's nothing in the world will ever shake you from it." Listen, that's a God of God I'm talking about. Amen. You may be sick. You may be broke. You may be crippled. But if the Holy Ghost ever establishes, Amen. Confidence in your heart. Amen. The symptoms won't change it. Hey, the troubles won't change it. Amen. Cloudy days won't change it. Cuz it's not coming from a man. It's coming from the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. And he has instilled in your heart, amen, an attitude and a confidence. My, it's spiritual warfare when a man meets God. Now, amen. You all realize this is not something, Amen. the devil's going to let you easily hold on to. Amen. The devil's not going to easily let you hold on to your spiritual confidence. If you ever get it, you're going to fight to keep it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, can I preach? If you ever get it, you're going to fight to keep it. But that's why Paul would say in Hebrews 3:14, he says we are made partakers of Christ. That if we hold the beginning of our confidence, amen, steadfast unto the end. So it's not enough just to have it when you start, but you got to hold it steadfast until the end. See, look what brother Brandon said. He said, I think it's come to a time that when we've got to know how we stand. How can you do anything unless you got faith in what you're doing? How can you do it? You got to have faith. And that's my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the believers faith and confidence in what they're standing for because it's the word of the Lord. He said that as long as to the scripture, it is sovereignly placed from Genesis into Revelation, back and forth, amen, up and down. Now listen at a prophet, he's not just throwing you a sermon. Amen. He's not just making you feel good, but he's taken the Bible from Genesis unto Revelation. Amen. From the top to the bottom. Amen. And he's given you a place to stand. And that would make a way no way for the devil to move in there. Amen. Then you got perfect confidence. That's why the devil hates this message is because this message opens the Bible and makes it a new book and it gives you a place to stand where no devil can whip you. Hey, I think it's time to let that devil know who we are. We're not a bunch of church members. We're not a bunch of religious folks. We are the sons and daughters of God that have been baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire and have been given a place to stand by the positionally scriptural or placing of the word of God. My, when I think about that, there's some people here tonight that knows where they're standing. &gt;&gt; Come on. I say this. Amen. I don't believe you're a group of people tonight that guesses where you're standing on water baptism. Amen. I don't think you're a group of people tonight. Amen. That guesses where you're standing on predestination or guesses where you're standing on the Godhead. Prophet of God said, "You ever notice how Satan how he hates two books of the Bible more than all others." Amen. Through liberal theologians and persuades, he is always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation. It is in both of these books that we find Satan's origin, his awful ways and his destruction. He said that is why he attacks them. He hates to be exposed. And in those books, he is exposed for exactly what he is. That's why Jesus said, Amen, that Satan has no part in me, Brother Brian, and I have no part in him. Amen. The devil would like to prove that different, but he cannot. Amen. So he does all that he can to destroy the confidence in the word. And when the church listen but when the church will disbelieve Satan and will believe the spirit's revelation of the word then the gates of hell cannot prevail against her. Listen, when you quit believing the devil and start believing the spirit of truth, it will release a confidence in your heart that no matter what tomorrow holds, no matter what next week holds, I got a revelation in my soul of who holds my future and come hell or high water, I'm going to make it by the grace of God. My to think tonight, amen, that Satan is trying to knock that confidence out because he knows there's a reward coming to the confidence. &gt;&gt; Now listen, there's no reward coming to our feelings. &gt;&gt; There's no reward coming to emotions, but there's a reward coming to the confidence. You read in Genesis 15:1, the Bible says, "After these things," Amen, "The word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision." And here's what it said. It said, "Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward." &gt;&gt; My my my. So, there we find that the source of Abraham's confidence was coming from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram picks this up and he reads and he says, "I am thy shield." Now, if God is your shield, then how's the devil going to hit you? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If God is your shield, then how is the devil going to hit you? Amen. You got to quit letting the devil make you an easy target. Amen. If God is your shield, Amen. Then how can the devil get to you? He said, see, I am your shield and your exceeding great reward. Who is I am? Amen. The Lord, your exceeding great reward. Now, I want you to notice here, Brother Ben, there is a shield and then there's a reward. There is a shield and there's a reward, which is signifying there's a battle, amen, between the time of the promise and the reward that comes to that promise. But in Ephesians 6:16, Paul says, "Above all, amen, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able, amen, to quench some of the fiery darts." Amen. A few of the fiery darts, three of the fiery darts. Paul said you'll be able to quench all the fiery darts. Amen. Of the wicked, Amen. Now, you know what a shield is, don't you? Amen. A shield, Brother David, is a large oblong, Amen. four cornered shield. Amen. Now, come on, folks. Amen. It don't take a scientist to realize that there are four gospels in the Bible, which if you believe all four, it'll make you a full gospel believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I love what a prophet said. He said, "I got a uniform on and I'm in the army of the Lord." Amen. I'm fighting the foes of the wicked, but I'm dressed. You might not be able to see it, but I know it's there. Amen. I feel it. the armor of God. He said, "The full gospel in my heart?" Well, glory to God. If you got the full gospel in your heart, Amen. What devil can take you out? What spirit can bind you? What demon can discourage you? I'm talking about a people who have been shielded with the faith of almighty God. Hallelujah. He said, "Our armor is on the inside of us." Amen. I love what he says in the true Easter Seal. He says, "Above all things," Amen. Take the shield of faith and move forward. Come on, church. You can't lay here, Abraham. Amen. There's a battle, but there's a reward coming. Amen. There's a battle, but there's a reward coming. And I tell you tonight, church, you may be in a battle tonight. Amen. But put on the shield of faith. Get the sword of the spirit in your hand. Get your feet shine with the preparation of the gospel of peace and move forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there's going to be a reward, Amen. then there's got to be a rewarder. &gt;&gt; If there's going to be a reward, brother Joel, there's got to be somebody that's going to be the rewarder. In Hebrews 11:6 in the Amplified Bible, Paul says, "Without faith, it is impossible." That means to walk with God and to please him. For whoever comes near to God, &gt;&gt; come on. Whoever comes near to God must necessarily believe that God exists. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I like to preach all night on that. Amen. If you ever come near to God, Brother Job, the first thing you got to do is acknowledge that God exists &gt;&gt; and that he rewards those who will earnestly and diligently seek him. Brother said, "Now this in the first sermon, I love it that's ever recorded on tape. Faith is the substance. 1947 he said this is the keynote to the scripture faith. See he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. Listen, God don't set you out. Amen. Seeking something without there being a reward to the desire you're seeking for. Brother said, "Maybe that's why that sickness is on you. That God has to educate you to a place that he is." Amen. A rewarder of those who diligently seek him. Maybe that's what your faith has given to you. That's why the sickness come upon you to test your faith. Then you can walk out here in Phoenix or Douglas or wherever you're from and you can say, "I know. I know. Nobody can tell me I know he's a healer." Well, I don't think we got to go to Phoenix. I don't think we got to go to Douglas tonight. I believe there's some Holy Ghost filled believers right here in Hardy, Arkansas that can walk out on the streets of Hardy. You can walk out on the streets of Black Rockck. You can walk out on the streets of Mammoth and you can say, "I know my God is a healer. I know my God is a savior. I know my God is a deliverer because I met him and he imparted a revelation in my soul." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My only way you can say I know is by experience. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That's the only way you can say I know is by an experience. That's why Paul said that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord. &gt;&gt; But by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, I just got to say what a prophet said. He said, "Every man that will come to Christ and will believe that he is." Now, I wish I was a singer right now. I'd sing my buddy Josh Bennett song. God is God. Amen. You got to come to God and you got to believe God is. &gt;&gt; What good does it do to believe God was? Come on. Amen. How would I help you tonight if I come here and I only believe, Sister Vicki, that God was and God used to do something and God used to move and God used to heal? How would I help the church if I come here tonight? Amen. Believing God will be in the millennium, but I didn't come here tonight believing just God was or believing just God will be. But I came here tonight with a full assurance in my heart that God is a savior. Hallelujah. God is a healer. And no matter what you're facing tonight, God is more than able to walk in on the condition and change it because he's an everpresent God. &gt;&gt; My you got to believe that he is &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of those who seek him. You got to give up your sins. Remember said, "And throw open your arms to God." Now listen, you can have. Ain't that powerful? You can have not something that looks like it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some imitation of it, &gt;&gt; but a genuine heart full &gt;&gt; of the real baptism &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; like it fell on the day of Pentecost. Now listen, the faith of God that has been instilled in a believer's heart is what's causing them to expect things. See, that's what Job said in Job 5'8. He said, "I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause, &gt;&gt; which doeth great things." &gt;&gt; Brother David, are you a witness? God doeth great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, unsearchable. Amen. Marvelous things without number. I love what a prophet says. He says, "God will do great things for you if you'll only believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you must believe that he is &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. Now, I got to say what brother said here. He said, "You can't sit half dead &gt;&gt; and believe some kind of a cold doctrine and then expect to get something from God." &gt;&gt; No, sir. You've got to believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. Well, I feel like shouting tonight. Amen. Thank God, brother Danny. We're not gathered in the house of God. Amen. Under a thermometer 40 below zero. Amen. Pumping cold and bombing fluid. But there is a fire in the house of God. There is a reality burning in the soul of every believer here tonight that whatever you expect, God is able to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I don't think it's time to cool off. If you're cooling off, I think it's time to move closer to the fire. Amen. If worldlyism is creeping in your life, I think it's time to move closer to the fire of God and let the fire of God burn it out. Amen. If Oh, God. Can I preach? If unbelief is creeping into your confession, I think it's time to get back close to the fire and let the fire of God melt the icicles of unbelief off of your confession where you can stand with a testimony that'll shake the shingles off of the roof. God is a savior. God is a healer. God is a Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it. Amen. I believe what a prophet said. He said, "It's become such a place till the spirit of God has been grieved." &gt;&gt; And any church, &gt;&gt; that's brother Brandon right here, &gt;&gt; "That denies the supernatural, &gt;&gt; it'll die as sure as I'm standing in this pullpit, &gt;&gt; any church &gt;&gt; that denies the supernatural." Now, I could I could preach there for a second. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't deny your version of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; But denies the Bible supernatural. &gt;&gt; Now watch a prophet. Because Satan introduce the idea that the supernatural isn't real. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now I got a question for you. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram asked questions. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "How do you know unless you taste and see?" &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "See, and know that he's the rewarder of those &gt;&gt; who would diligently seek after him, not those who stand back and criticize." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, I just got to say it, folks. Criticizing will cause you to lose faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's anything that'll start drying up your faith as a believer is when an old critical devil gets on you and you start criticizing everything and everybody and every song and every preacher. Oh, God. Amen. Reverson said if we lose faith, he said, then we'll never get a prayer answered by God. For he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him. So if we lose faith, then our prayers are anulled. He says we get nowhere. So it's all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith. Amen. If you was with me last Wednesday, you heard it. Stand strong in the battle of faith. You got to hold on to faith. Then if we lose faith, amen, all our hopes is gone. Now listen, church, the minute faith dies is the minute hope begins to dry up. &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm telling the truth. Amen. See, but if we lose faith, now watch this. And if we lose faith, then all our spiritual reality is gone. &gt;&gt; For you cannot have faith in things you see, for the things you see are all perishable. Amen. So if you put your faith in perishable things, then you're going to perish with the things you put your faith in. But my Bible says the things that are not seen, amen, are real and are eternal. &gt;&gt; My then I can tell you tonight, the new birth is the only way for God to bring spiritual reality into a human being. You cannot have faith until you're born again. Statue of a perfect man, bottom of the pyramid, can't get nowhere without the foundation of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. I know a lot of guys teach statue of a perfect man. But let's come back to the way brother Brandham taught it. He taught a new birth and then he taught add to your virtues. &gt;&gt; I know a lot of people then and I'll just say it very plainly and move on. But I I I feel liberty to say it. There's a birth and there's an adoption, folks. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Ram taught. Amen. Now, there's a people on the earth that's been born again. &gt;&gt; See, that's the thing about it. There's a people on the earth that's been born again. Listen. That will see. Is everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That will see the spiritual and little realities of the body change. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not you fighting for nothing. &gt;&gt; This is not you confessing the promises of God over sick loved ones and over your family and over your health and over your church in vain. There's a reward coming to that confession. There's a reality coming to that desire. Brother Ben said, "Oh," he said, "Oh, I want to see him." How many says, "Oh, I want to see him. I want to see the hour that I could look and see all these old bodies transformed and see them changed in a moment, in a twinkle." Listen, folks, that's not a pipe dream. That's not an imagination. That is a spoken word of God that will have a fulfillment in a body of flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that isn't so, then we're the most foolish people. &gt;&gt; Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you die. Amen. See, you're just like an animal. You die and go to the dirt and that's all. &gt;&gt; Now listen now. And then I'll say this. Amen. I I there's an immortal soul living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's let me back up a second. I feel that hovering there. There is a birth &gt;&gt; and there is an adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that's in the adoption series. And and I thank God for for men of God like brother Ben that'll preach it way brother Ram said it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's one of our points of fellowship is a man will just read what brother Ram said and preach it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We don't need no elder to get all high and mighty and correct the way brother taught it. &gt;&gt; See there's an immortal soul. Let me move on. There's an immortal soul living in you, brother. We have done heard from heaven. Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask y'all this. How are you here on a Wednesday night, church? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Some of you all are going through things right now that you don't even feel like being here. &gt;&gt; But you're here anyhow. &gt;&gt; You're going through changes and situations and and structural changes and all kinds of things happen, but you're here anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you why? Because the prophet said, "We've done heard from heaven. We've done seen it proven. We know that he is and we know that a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. You say, "Brother Andrew, how does a believer hear from heaven?" I wondered that same thing, Brother Joel, when I got over in the book of Matthew about the 16th chapter and the 17th verse. And the Bible said Jesus answered and said unto him, &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; For flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Now come on church. How many will agree the father was in Jesus? In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Then all that was in God he poured into Christ. Then whatever was in heaven was in Jesus in flesh on the earth. Oh church of the living God. Amen. Heaven was in Jesus. Amen. When they heard Jesus speaking, they were hearing from heaven. They were not hearing from the local rabbi. They were not hearing from the local seminary. They were hearing from heaven. Oh, can I say it to you the way I believe it? I believe heaven was speaking. And I believe heaven is speaking today. And I want to tell that devil, heaven has a voice and heaven has an audience. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And I am a part of the audience of heaven. &gt;&gt; Heaven has spoken. Oh, brother. Is it beautiful about Job? He said Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit and he could cuff him up and make him do it. Amen. But you see Job with his perfect revelation of God and who God was. Now, now how many say, "Lord, give me a perfect revelation of who God is." Amen. Lord, fill me with a perfect revelation of who God was and who God is. But listen, Job's revelation went beyond that. You know what a prophet said? He had a perfect revelation of how God loved him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Hey, I tell you, sometimes, Amen. All your quotes and scriptures on the Godhead won't defeat the devil on a bad day. Amen. Sometimes all your quotes and all your theology on predestination won't defeat the devil on a bad day. But when you can reach way down in the depths of your soul and begin to draw from the perfect revelation that is dwelling in your soul, God loves me. It'll put every devil in hell on the run. The world may be again me. The church may be against me. My friends may be against me. But oh, the love of God, God loves me. He loves me when the sick people that's in the building tonight that's crippled or you that have the need of God when you can get that type of revelation. &gt;&gt; Oh church, that's a type of revelation I want is a perfect revelation because a perfect revelation produces a perfect confidence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get that type of revelation that you are justified, &gt;&gt; when you are actually justified in asking the thing you're asking for and you believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him, are y'all ready for this? Then there's nothing, oh God. Then there is nothing, amen, that can ever separate you from the faith that's anchored to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God, church. That ought to make you shout hallelujah. When the perfect revelation of the love of God ever strikes the soul of a bornagain human, that is more than just a church anchoring to you. It's more than your pastor anchoring to you, but it's faith anchoring to your life. Oh my. Can I go ahead and say it, brother Joel? That's how you get out of every trouble. That's how we overcome every situation. It's because we're not anchored to the church. Brother David, the church might change. Amen. Preachers might change. Moves and the message might change. But if the faith of Abraham ever anchors to the soul of a believer, no matter how low they'll go, they'll feel a tug, but it'll be a faith tug. It'll be the faith of God pulling them out of the situation. Oh, I feel the pull, brother David. Hallelujah. I feel the pull of it tonight. I feel it, Brother Jonah. I feel the pull of the faith of God saying, "You can make it. You can overcome. You can rise above it all." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you talking about?" that after you recognized that the very word of God was eagle food, you left the other thing, you have been formed into the living image &gt;&gt; of the living God. &gt;&gt; Listen, you heard from your theophony. &gt;&gt; Can I say it? Brother Peter, you heard from your reward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You heard from your reward. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. What's keeping you in the battle of faith? What's keeping you positioned against old age and against sickness and against disease? Is because we've already heard &gt;&gt; from our theophony which is not made with hands eternal in the heavens. It's a glorified body. It's a glorified condition. When I feel like shouting that devil plun back to hell where he come from, I may look like I'm falling apart. I may look like every devil's piled up on me, but devil just stand back cuz I'm hearing from my theophony. I'm feeling a tug from another dimension and it's pulling me up high power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Can I just tell you tonight? Amen. Confidence has been instilled in you by your own theophony. &gt;&gt; I know that might be a hard one to swallow, but you know what a prophet said? He said, "Your theophony is a glorified body." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Just think of it. Your glorified body is right here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is right here at the tabernacle. Now, the presence of the Holy Spirit, which is your glorified condition in Christ right now, you're glorified. Why don't you turn loose of your voice right now and testify against that devil and say right now in the presence of God, I'm already glorified. &gt;&gt; You say, "You can't prove that." I can. Romans 8, those he justified, he also glorified. Can I say what a prophet said? And your own glorified body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cast not away your confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. your own glorified body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a direct quote. Is right here standing near you right now in Christ Jesus to give you strength like a charge going into a battery. The Holy Spirit is in you. It's to charge your body to give you new strength. Oh, I don't know about you tonight, but I raise my hand, Brother Caleb, and say, "Lord, I can use some new strength on a Wednesday night. Lord, come by my heart. Come by my pew. Amen. Hook up my theophony to my body and send some new strength into me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's here to charge your body, to give you new strength to heal you from the sickness that you got and to make you well. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Herald, this perfect revelation is coming from none other than our Lord Jesus Christ. And I want to say to you tonight, if Job under the blood of bulls and goats could have a perfect revelation of how God loved him, then what about a believer who is under the creative perfect blood of almighty God? I think if anybody got a right to shout and if anybody got a right to rejoice and if anybody got a right to praise God unrestricted and unlimited is the bride of Jesus Christ. We've done heard from heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. You say, "Preacher, you're getting way out there." Well, you know what Paul said? He said, "God commendeth his love towards us." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; In that while we were yet sinners, &gt;&gt; if we' ever get a revelation of that, we' change the way we approach new folks coming in. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's free of charge. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We quit belittling them, making fun of them. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz one time that was you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Free of charge. Okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring out. &gt;&gt; Right, brother Bruce. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. We We We ready just to Well, &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; We We expect them to come clean. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I've been fishing since I was a kid. &gt;&gt; And I ain't never cleaned a fish I didn't catch first. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. Every fish I ever caught, I cleaned it after I caught it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes them fish can take a while to clean. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See, but much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. &gt;&gt; Look here in 1 John 4:10. here in his love. Not that we love God, but that he loved us &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Sometimes you got to remember before you had your confidence, you had your sins, and we had our iniquities and we had our mistakes and our failures. And &gt;&gt; come on, y'all might as well loosen up and preach a second. But God who is rich in mercy made a way to redeem us from our sins and our iniquities and to set us in a place of justification. We love him because he first loved us. You know what the prophet said? He said if the church has lost its divine revelation of the love of God, it becomes a mock and a stalk and a stumbling block to the world. &gt;&gt; Now I just got to say what the Bible says. For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I I'm so thankful for this, brother Ben. &gt;&gt; But my kindness shall not depart from thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Saith the Lord that hath mercy on me. Look in Ephesians 3:17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; But you being rooted and grounded in all your codes in it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You being rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If we don't get the love of God in the heart of a believer, then they're only doing things out of dos and don'ts and not from love. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Good. Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to say what a prophet said. When a man experiences the depth of God in his life, it's an actual personal experience &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God indwelling him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and the knowledge of God through the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this. &gt;&gt; He will as always attempt to make a substitute &gt;&gt; for this reality of God. How will he do it? He will take away the knowledge of the truth of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He will. &gt;&gt; He will destroy the word by putting forth his own. Yay hath God said. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can I bring it on down? &gt;&gt; Bring it on. &gt;&gt; And he will then substitute the personal Christ in our spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, Satan hates the thought of there being a people in the land with the perfect revelation of who God is. Come on. &gt;&gt; His love for them &gt;&gt; and that he's their rewarder. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See what what the Bible says in 2 Chronicles 15:7. Be ye strong, therefore, and let not your hands be weak. &gt;&gt; For your work shall be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Look what David says in Psalms 18:20. The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompense me. in Psalms 103 and verse 10, he hath not dealt with us after our sins, &gt;&gt; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. And as far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Well, if anybody got a righteous shout is those who've been redeemed by the hand of the Lord. You say, "Preacher, why are you shouting?" Because I know my mistakes. I know my failures. I know my humanity. I know all my stumbling blocks and all my faults and failures. But the God of Abraham has gave me a reward. And he put a sword in my hand to fight back against every devil that would try to pile my past upon me. Oh, I love what Proverbs says. Who so despiseth the word shall be destroyed. &gt;&gt; But he Come on. &gt;&gt; But he that fearth the commandment shall be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know what Jesus said? He said, "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake." Can I tell you how to handle it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Get mad and bless God. I'll meet him down on the corner of the street and I &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. You say, "Preacher, you crazy." I'm not crazy. I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free from caring about what people think about me, about what people think about what I do, think about what I preach, think about where I go and what I say. I'm free of all that. The more they talk about me, the more I want to rejoice. The more they ridicule me, the more I want to shout. Amen. Cuz I know where my reward is coming from. It's coming from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Rejoice for it. Great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Look at this word reward. It is used of the fruit naturally resulting from tools and endeavors. It is in both senses rewards and punishments. of the rewards which God bestows or will bestow upon good deeds and endeavors. Amen. Can I say what a prophet said in 1964? He said, "The church will never know the labor and the weary and the toil and trial that's tried to break it the message." &gt;&gt; The world will never know. The church will never know the labor and the weary and toil and trial that's tried to break it the message. But God does. He said, "But my reward doesn't come from peoples." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, give me some shout room in the house of God. My reward doesn't come from peoples. You know what Paul said? He said, "Be not deceived, for God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sweth to the flesh shall also reap of the flesh corruption, but he that sweth to the spirit shall reap of the spirit of the everlasting. And remember, my brothers and sisters, you will reap what you sow. That's God's law. That's God's law of nature. Now, you say, "Well, can't we backslide?" Absolutely. Hebrews. Can't we backslide? Absolutely. And when you backslide, you're going to get it. Don't you worry. Abraham got it. And the rest of them got it and you'll get it. Don't you think it you get Don't you think it gives you a right to sin? It doesn't. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. We might as well preach. We're this close to it. Amen. Why are we letting up now this close to the rapture? Amen. It don't give you a righteous sin. You'll pay for everything you do. You will reap what you sow. Well, come on. You do one little sin and you'll reap a whole wash tub full. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of good legalistic preachers. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And right now, bless God, Brother Ben, they they'd hunker down in that microphone &gt;&gt; and they'd get on that. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I'm going to tell you right now, you're going to hell. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, read the rest of the quote, &gt;&gt; brother. You'll reap what you sow a wash was washed up full. But that don't mean to say you're lost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. How can you be lost when you've already heard from your theophony? &gt;&gt; How can you be lost when the faith of God has anchored itself to you? How can you be lost when God has allowed the word to impart a revelation in your soul that you got a seat at the marriage supper of the lamb and nobody can take your place? You say, "Well, that's just giving us a right to sin." Amen. I'm going to tell you, and I'm going to say it very plainly, and I'm going to say it very straight. A predestinated seed requires a predestinated life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We always use that in the negative. Well, bless God, they're sowing and they're going to reap. Why don't we turn it to the positive? &gt;&gt; If there's a people that can sow bad and reap bad, don't you think there's a people can sow good and reap good? Don't you think what the Bible says when it said, "Let us not be weary and welloing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not." &gt;&gt; You know what brother said? He said, "That's been my attitude all along. And I want to go out of this world with the same attitude, knowing that someday I shall receive a reward if I can only be faithful until that time when the rewards are given." He said, "The reward of the just &gt;&gt; waits for each believer." &gt;&gt; Amen. I love what a prophet says in Hebrews or in the fifth seal 1963 paragraph 471. Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How many's ever had to take a stand? &gt;&gt; You ever had to make a stand? &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said? He said, "And the God of heaven rewards you &gt;&gt; for your stand." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All things, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon clearly and emphatically establishes that God rewards faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith is a revelation. Now, you all know him in the message in Genesis 4. Abel and Cain come to the altar to worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, Brother Brandon breaks it down beautifully. He says, Cain comes up there and he lays out everything just right. And he looks at God and he says, "Can I find favor with you?" &gt;&gt; Brother said he wasn't an infidel. &gt;&gt; He was a fundamental believer. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; He said, "But God through election." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Called Abel and had a recompense to that reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now Abel had foresight." Isn't that powerful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can I Can I Can I just let you in on a little secret? Sometimes Sometimes it's real easy to get critical against somebody. &gt;&gt; But you don't realize they're elected by God and they have foresight. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about, right? And then it's like brother said here he said he was born to Adam which was the son of God. He said and the church today that's born of Christ the son of God has the foresight and the recompense to the reward that's going to come. &gt;&gt; So that's why they're not looking at what is. &gt;&gt; They're looking at what will be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, they don't care what the world says. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; brother Noah. They don't care how old-fashioned they're called, how much this that or the other. We know what God said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what we're looking to, brother Peter. I love what a prophet said. We don't look at the things that go on so much temporarily now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we look to the end of the road &gt;&gt; where the rewards are given. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, God rewards faith. &gt;&gt; Can I can I say this to you tonight? And God's attitude is eternal. &gt;&gt; It never changes. &gt;&gt; Paul said this, "Sin were compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight." and the sin that disease and beset us. Let us run with race the patience with the let us run with patience the race &gt;&gt; that's set before us look into the author finish of our faith the Lord Jesus Christ. Now Abraham says if we see what God did back there to those people &gt;&gt; upon certain attitudes they taken towards God and then if we find out if we'll take the same attitude they did &gt;&gt; we will receive the same reward that they did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So your attitude is connected to your reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can just expect because God never changes. His blessings is the same and his penalties is the same. See then there's a recompense of reward for obedience and there's a recompense of reward for disobedience. Now, now you all remember there in in 1955 Reb gives his life story there in Zurich, Switzerland. And he says, "I put down all the invitations that night among the Pentecostals for the first time." And he said, "I went home." And Amen. Now, now, can I preach to you for a second? Is that is that I got 56 seconds. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; I went home and I said, "I found the baptism of the Holy Spirit." And I said, "Oh my." I said, "Honey, I've got all these invitations. We're going into the evangelistic work." and she went to tell her parents and her mother was a refined type of woman, belonged to a great big church. And she said, "Now, Billy, them people are nothing but trash. There's nothing to them. You stay away from them. I don't want my girl around them." I said, "Oh, but they were real." And she said, "No, no." And I said, "But I believe they are." &gt;&gt; Now, my wife started crying. Now, listen. And there's where I made my fatal mistake. &gt;&gt; Sure. He went against what he believed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now you say, "Preacher, surely you're talking about somebody besides Brother Brandham." No, I'm talking about Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And And this is &gt;&gt; brother Brother Danny. This is one of them hard quotes for them daddy folks to swallow. &gt;&gt; I listened to my mother-in-law. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Instead of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. and forsaken the church and went on back with the Baptist people. And right away plagues hit my home. My wife took sick. My father died on my arm. My brother was killed. Everything happened just a few days a foot hit this country. Washed away the homes. My wife was in the hospital. I was on a rescue boat one night out in the water. My boat got in the current was going over a big falls. I couldn't get the motor started. But I raised up my hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Oh, God, don't let me drown. I'm not worthy to live. but think of my wife and baby. Listen, and I tried again and it wouldn't start. And I cried again to God. Listen, you're going to reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was reaping the benefits of listening to his mother-in-law, but he wasn't lost. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I tried again, and just before going over the falls, the motor started and I got to land." Are you hearing me? See, just because you make a mistake, just because you fall, don't give up. &gt;&gt; Come on. Just because you're reaping something you sold, don't throw away. Amen. God is faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I want to I want to close on this right here. I'm having to skip over a lot, but a prophet stands there and he says, "The Holy Spirit is here and will reward you if you will believe." He said, "Now, without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, I can prove infallibly if you'll believe me that sickness will leave you now, God will reward your faith." Amen. Can I Can I bring it right down to you and just say this? The unseen Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is standing among us here now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's here to reward your faith. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Listen, I I I I just got to studying the other day and I know I know over the last little bit you all are not ignorant. It's been a big a big argument. Should we shout? Should we not? Should we dance? Should we not speak in tongues? Should we not? Should we? But but let's just go back to what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said, "People say, "Well, unless I receive the Holy Ghost and speak in tonesues, I don't have it." He said, "No matter how much you speak in tonesues and deny this word, you're wrong anyhow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you don't go in by speaking in tonesues. &gt;&gt; That's right. You go in by keeping every word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe you can be quick and like I said this morning, do you speak with a new tongue? I have myself. I know it's the truth. I know it's true. &gt;&gt; But that's not the sign that you're God's selected child." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many will come to me and say, "Lord, and then I prophesied and done all these great things your name." And he'll say, "Depart from me." That's right. You worker of iniquity, I never knew you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now listen. You speak with tongues and then refuse to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just bring it right on down to the message. &gt;&gt; See? Yes, indeed. In those things, the orders that God gives, there's something wrong. Now, just search your own conscience and see what the Bible said. Show me some place where somebody was baptized in the name of Father, Son, Holy Ghost. See, it's not there. But you see, sometimes for your conscience sake, you say, "Well," &gt;&gt; now, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Now, here I got to say what what he said. &gt;&gt; You say God speaks to the women about how they must do and not wear shorts and things. But you know the pastor said, &gt;&gt; uh, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said, "So they take the easy way." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, can I leave you by saying this? There's no reward coming to those that take the easy way. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; When the pastor says something different than the word, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; That's the easy way. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And when you take the easy way, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; You can forget the reward of the word. &gt;&gt; I'm out of time, but I'll set the way to the prophet said. He said, "I was over in in the other day preaching and he said, "I was preaching trying to separate denominationalism from real Christianity." And he said, "A man was giving me kind of a short talk from a famous Pentecostal church. His name was Danny Henry. He's a movie star's cousin there." And he said, he said, "Brother Bra, I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, but that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation." And when he started to say something else, he started speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; Now, three people wrote it down. Now, all three notes was the same. And it said this, "Because thou has chosen this harder way." &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've chose it. &gt;&gt; You have took chose it by your own choosing. Of course, we know that was Moses had to take his choice. This is the precise and the correct way &gt;&gt; because it's my way. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And what a glorious decision you've made. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, because of this, a large portion of heaven &gt;&gt; awaits you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this in itself is that which will make and bring to pass &gt;&gt; the tremendous victory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the love divine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you tonight? God will reward you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of your stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the confidence you've taken. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you getting at?" I'll tell you this. How many knows Ruth had to make a decision? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many knows Ruth had to serve? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many knows Ruth's coming to rest after her decision and serving? &gt;&gt; And I love what a prophet says. He said, "And Ruth, after resting from her serving under her decision, &gt;&gt; Ruth was rewarded." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; When Ruth was deciding, she knew there was a reward coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a reward coming to that decision. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When she was serving, she knew there was a reward coming to that service. when she was resting, she knew there was a reward coming to that rest. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said this, &gt;&gt; he said, "And Ruth was rewarded by getting Boaz." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The church is rewarded by when the coming of the Lord shall come on that bright and cloudless morning." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, we're resting now. &gt;&gt; We're waiting now. But it shall come why it's redeemed." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; As the musicians are coming tonight, I want to tell you, hold fast your confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jes. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, it's awful hot and heavy in the battle right now, but there's a reward coming." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Listen, heard Abraham said today, I was riding down the road. He said, "There's nothing you do for God that he don't see what you do." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every little thing you do, remember there's a reward." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; See, somewhere or another, you got to get your eyes off of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got to quit looking for people to pat you on the back and &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; agree with you and support you and &gt;&gt; sometimes they're not going to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, remember brother talk about that that John Ryan, he said he got his healing and he went out testifying. Church people was his big biggest critics. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Talking about I'm I can see extra extra my eyes are healed. stumbling around and bumping into walls and tripping over things. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost had come into his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Sister Karine, the Holy Ghost had instilled confidence in him. &gt;&gt; I'm your healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say this to you. &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming to our young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That take a stand for this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I want to just say it very plainly and very openly. Amen. And there's a reward coming to our young ladies &gt;&gt; that bear the reproach every day of the world. &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming. &gt;&gt; There ain't no reward coming to this mix in Hollywood fashion and gospel fashion. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But there's a reward coming to that that life that'll consecrate itself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming to these young men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Clean living above the things of the world. Listen, elders, there's a reward coming to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But you got to hold fast your confidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir. Somebody said, "Brother Andrew, I don't know. I don't know if God remembers what I done, one of my one of my favorite testimonies." I heard one time a brother was testifying of it. He said, and and and he's testifying about how God don't forget and God remembers and all that. Brother David, he says this. He's talking about one time the lady come up in a prayer line and and I haven't I'll be honest with you, I haven't filmed it on tape, but I believe the testimony. So, if that's okay, I'll just share it. was testifying of how lady come up on up on the prayer line one night. Brother Joel and she's standing there before brother Brandham. Brother Brandham said, "Oh," he said, "I see you got this condition and you got this problem in this situation." He said, "Oh, but I also see something else." He said, he said, "Oh," he said, "I see one time there was a little girl wanted to go to church." And he said, "That little girl didn't have a dress." And he said, "And that little girl wanted to go to church so bad that she didn't have a dress." And he said, "Oh, I see. You took time out of your schedule and you sold that little girl the dress." so she could go to church. And he said, "The Lord didn't forget that." And he said, "Oh, I also see," he said, "there it is." He said, "That little girl is my wife and she's sitting right back there tonight." [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, God don't forget." &gt;&gt; He said, "God remembered that." And he said, "The Lord Jesus makes you well here tonight." Now, listen, folks. Either he's an all remembermbering God or he's not. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either he remembers the stand you've taken for him or he's forgotten it. But I propose to you tonight, my God don't have amnesia. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; And my God don't forget &gt;&gt; and my God keeps good books. &gt;&gt; And my God will be indebted to no man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many want to raise your hands tonight and say, "Lord, give me the grace." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me the spiritual confidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to take a stand for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know you'll reward me for that stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of y'all are sitting right here tonight in the fruit of reward of a stand you took for God. Amen. I believe it tonight. I want you to stand up on your feet with us this evening. Amen. I pray something's been said to bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To help you tonight. I I pray the Holy Ghost has come by your heart and &gt;&gt; you felt that little tug. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You felt that little tug of faith. &gt;&gt; That little anchor, that pull of faith. &gt;&gt; I remember your stand. I remember what you done. I remember the confession. I remember the word. I remember where it was you made that stand. And and I want tonight you just say, "Lord, fill my heart." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fill my heart with that perfect revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, would you would you just come by my heart tonight and just just fill it with that perfect revelation of your love of who you are and how much you love me. or the devil. May maybe you're here tonight and the devil's doing everything he can to try to knock that confidence out of you. Amen. God bless you, little buddy. He's trying everything he can to knock your confidence out. He's trying to drain the confidence of God right out of your heart. &gt;&gt; But you say tonight, Lord, instill it in me. &gt;&gt; Lord, instill it in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe you say, "Preacher, how in the world is this confidence coming? service after service, tape after tape, word after word, line upon line, here a little, there a little, precept upon precept, and just gradually but firmly establishing and instilling in your heart a word attitude. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I raise my hands tonight. I say, Lord, instill it in me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, fill me with that confidence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't let anything shake it from me, Lord. Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your presence tonight, Lord. Father, we've stood here behind this sacred desk once again, Lord. And Lord, endeavor to declare unto your children the goodness of your grace and mercy. And Father, I know there's a group of people standing before me here tonight that's in a great battle. Lord, the devil is doing everything he can to beset the believers. But Lord, we stand up on the confession of faith tonight that Lord, your word is true. And Lord, in the face of every unbelieving spirit, your word will prevail. Now Lord, as we stand here tonight, we stand here believing that you're the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. &gt;&gt; Lord, we stand here believing that you're the God that was. Lord, we believe that you're the God that shall be. But Lord, we're standing here tonight upon a present day revelation. You're the God that is. &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe that you exist, Lord. Father, we believe that you're existing in every one of our situations. We believe that you're controlling every one of our lives, Lord. Now, Father, if there would be one here tonight that's lost their confidence, I pray that you would take the Holy Spirit tonight in their hearts &gt;&gt; and you would refresh it, Lord. You would restore it, dear God. &gt;&gt; Father, maybe one of them feeling a little weak in their stand. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm asking you tonight, dear God. Lord, may you shir up the stand of every believer here tonight. Father, maybe they're feeling a little weak in their faith, Lord. Lord, may you send a surge of strength into that heart tonight. Father, we're looking to you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. In Jesus name we pray. Oh, maybe you just raise your hands tonight and say, "Lord, while I'm in your presence, the Holy Ghost here, my glorified body right here in this tabernacle tonight, wanting to send a charge through me like a battery and give me new strength. Would you come by my heart, Lord? &gt;&gt; Would you come by my way right now, Lord? Would you touch me, Lord? You see this sickness? You see this condition? &gt;&gt; You're the God that can make it well right now. You've already made it well. Now, Father, I'm asking you come by my way right now in the name of Jesus. In Jesus name. Let's sing it together tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're crying. Saveior. [Music] Oh my savior. [Music] Won't you hear my humble cry? &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Oh, and while on other are [Music] not pass [Music] by. [Music] and pass me not. Oh gentle Savior, won't you hear my humble cry? [Music] Oh, and while all others thou art calling, oh, do not pass me by. Oh, we're calling on you, Savior. Oh, yes, my savior. [Applause] Won't you hear my humble cry? Oh, and while all thou art calling, oh dear, not pass me Oh, we're crying. Saveior. Oh, my Savior. [Music] Won't you hear my humble cry?

We say God bless you tonight, brother Ben. We thank you for the opportunity to be here tonight and speak to the church once again. And it is a real honor to be here. And amen, I pray tonight something been said to bless you and help you. And amen, just look away to Jesus tonight. And amen, know there's a reward coming. Amen. Every prayer you pray, every stand you take, every time you swing that sword against that enemy, &gt;&gt; there's a reward coming to your faith. Amen. We love you tonight with love.
