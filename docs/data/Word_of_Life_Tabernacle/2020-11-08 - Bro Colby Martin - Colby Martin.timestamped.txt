[43:44] ideas oh but tonight we're asking that
[43:46] there'd be something that
[43:48] can be said lord i know my cry is to
[43:51] have more of you in my heart
[43:53] to have a renewal and i refill it

[44:36] tonight
[44:38] i heard you guys had a a good service i
[44:40] hate you have to
[44:42] hear me tonight but i pray there's
[44:44] something that
[44:45] can be said i had a thought
[44:48] on my mind um to speak
[44:52] and actually um the lord put another
[44:55] thought on my
[44:56] my heart so i pray that there'd be
[44:58] something that would be said here
[45:00] tonight if we can turn to james 1 and
[45:04] 12.
[45:11] like to say it's an honor to be here
[45:15] we don't get this way too often so i do
[45:18] appreciate your pastor extending
[45:20] his hand of invitation to us and um
[45:25] amen james 1 and 12 says blessed is the
[45:27] man
[45:29] that in due earth temptation for when he
[45:31] has tried he shall receive the crown of
[45:33] life which the lord hath promised
[45:35] to them that love him let no man say
[45:38] when he is tempted i am tempted of god
[45:41] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[45:43] neither attempt that he any man but
[45:46] every man is tempted when he is thrown
[45:47] away of his own lust
[45:49] and enticed then when lust has conceived
[45:52] it brings forth sin
[45:53] and sin but it is finished bringeth
[45:56] forth death it says
[45:58] do not air my beloved brethren
[46:01] may the lord has blessed him to the
[46:02] reading of your word amen
[46:10] i tell you having these hooks on right
[46:11] here they're really nice
[46:14] but brother branham says here in
[46:15] perversion
[46:18] um he said when there was when was there
[46:20] any more a wicked in adulterous
[46:22] generation than we've got now
[46:24] when we're there more sin he says we've
[46:26] got more people on the earth right now
[46:28] they tell us as many people on the earth
[46:30] right now that's ever been on the earth
[46:32] since adam is on the earth right now he
[46:35] said this is that wicked
[46:36] and adulterous generation homosexuals
[46:38] perversion we can see that
[46:40] everything on the increased by thousands
[46:43] and thousands says churches fall away
[46:45] they're a heady high-minded lovers of
[46:48] pleasure
[46:49] more than lovers of god and if if i had
[46:52] a
[46:53] title tonight it would be the cycle of
[46:55] sin and
[46:56] if i like to take in parallel the first
[46:58] church age with our life if that's all
[47:00] right here tonight just
[47:02] i know it's a communion night so just
[47:03] give me 20 30 minutes of your time
[47:06] brother branham is identifying that
[47:09] there is
[47:09] more sin than ever before
[47:12] we can see that that churches are
[47:15] beginning to fall away the standards
[47:17] have dropped
[47:19] correction of the word a being preached
[47:21] like it used to be
[47:23] amen where the preaching of the word and
[47:26] its power and
[47:27] demonstration and authority is not being
[47:29] accepted anymore do you believe them
[47:32] or the power of god and i'm not saying
[47:34] it's here so don't get don't take the
[47:35] throne where the power of god
[47:37] can't move through a church anymore and
[47:39] change lives and break chains
[47:42] people are under the the attitude
[47:44] anymore well come to church pay my
[47:46] tithes do
[47:46] do my time and that's all there is for
[47:48] me but there can be a deliverance
[47:51] if you come to the house of god with an
[47:53] expectation
[47:54] god will come down and meet your need i
[47:56] believe that
[47:57] but we have to come to church with an
[47:59] expectation that god
[48:01] i'm not leaving here until i get
[48:03] something
[48:04] from you but churches anymore young
[48:07] people ain't seeking the holy ghost like
[48:09] they used to
[48:09] and be honest with you can't find a true
[48:12] blue
[48:13] sinner anymore it's hard to find someone
[48:16] that's just a true blue sinner and they
[48:18] you know it's just hard to find it but
[48:21] it wasn't so
[48:22] at the beginning do you believe that so
[48:25] we want to look at the root and the
[48:26] progression of sin
[48:28] if that's okay here tonight just like
[48:31] anything it starts out with a seed it's
[48:34] not something that
[48:35] has changed overnight but it's something
[48:37] that has been
[48:38] in work for some time at a very slow
[48:41] pace we
[48:42] you go out there i assume there's
[48:43] farmers here and you don't go out there
[48:45] and plant your corn or
[48:46] your crops and you you don't expect it
[48:48] to be grown by the next day
[48:50] but there is a process and it takes time
[48:53] for this seed to grow and
[48:55] people's idea and perception towards sin
[48:58] has changed with time
[49:00] do you believe that what what's evil is
[49:03] now
[49:03] good and what was what's good is is now
[49:06] evil
[49:08] our our view of the revealed word has
[49:12] changed over time people's minds have
[49:14] been programmed what was
[49:16] wrong is no longer wrong anymore or what
[49:17] was right it's no longer right
[49:19] but regardless of the change of time the
[49:22] message of the hour is still the same
[49:25] the bible and its power and authority is
[49:27] still the same
[49:29] the reason that god allowed the message
[49:30] to be recorded because that voice
[49:32] will never change no matter how satan
[49:35] has changed his tactics over time and
[49:37] the world has changed their
[49:38] their ideas on how things are the word
[49:41] has never changed
[49:42] and it will never change you believe
[49:45] that
[49:46] no matter what may blow against the
[49:48] message or the bible there is
[49:49] it will never change you can put your
[49:53] faith in that because you know
[49:54] god will never change if he promised to
[49:56] heal you back then he'll heal you today
[49:59] if he promised to deliver you then he
[50:01] will deliver you today
[50:02] that power is still very real tonight
[50:06] amen do you believe that if i can say
[50:09] this we don't need
[50:10] the prophet to come back that authority
[50:12] that he had is resting within the bride
[50:14] here tonight
[50:16] you believe that you can speak to your
[50:18] circumstance
[50:20] that authority is now here amen
[50:27] amen brother branham in the church agent
[50:29] seals
[50:30] taught us about the history and the
[50:32] condition of the church and
[50:34] how there was a cycle a process brother
[50:36] branham says here in the first seal now
[50:38] remember
[50:39] the anti-create christ and the beast is
[50:42] the same self-spirit
[50:44] there's the trinity yes sir it's three
[50:46] stages of the same
[50:48] devil power he said it had to be
[50:51] incarnated before it was crowned
[50:53] remember watch this
[50:54] three stages the first stage he called
[50:57] antichrist
[50:59] the second stage he called the false
[51:01] prophet in the third stage he called the
[51:04] beast
[51:04] we see the three stages we see there's a
[51:07] cycle
[51:08] before it can be crowned but it's still
[51:09] the same spirit as it was back then
[51:12] and the garment of it is the same spirit
[51:13] today it hasn't changed
[51:16] do you believe them so we see everything
[51:19] starts with a seed but in time it grows
[51:23] into a full grown tree and
[51:25] we can see how satan was first
[51:26] antichrist we understand that that's
[51:28] anything against the lord bear with me
[51:30] i'm getting somewhere with this in the
[51:33] second stage he was the false prophet
[51:35] and in the final state is the beast
[51:37] which is the incarnated devil we can see
[51:40] the devil being incarnated today brother
[51:41] branham taught us that
[51:43] that satan needs a vessel to work
[51:46] through just as god needs a body to work
[51:48] through where he can
[51:49] display himself satan also needs a body
[51:52] brother branham says satan is powerless
[51:55] without a body
[51:57] there would be no wickedness in this age
[51:59] if no one would allow the devil
[52:01] to take control of their body amen
[52:05] just as christ needs a body a vessel to
[52:08] demonstrate himself into a world today
[52:11] do you believe that
[52:12] and i believe there is a bride that
[52:14] christ is living through
[52:16] do you believe that amen
[52:19] revelations 1 2 and 1
[52:22] says unto the angel the church of
[52:24] ephesus is right
[52:26] these things say he that holdeth the
[52:28] seven stars in his right hand
[52:30] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[52:31] golden candlesticks i know thy works
[52:34] in thy labor and how thou s cannot bear
[52:37] them which are evil
[52:38] thou hast tried them which say they are
[52:40] apostles and are not as found them liars
[52:43] and as born and has patience for my
[52:45] namesake has labored
[52:47] now it's not faded nevertheless he says
[52:50] here i have somewhat against thee
[52:53] because thou has left thy first
[52:56] love we see how the church ages have
[53:01] progressed
[53:02] and how that as individuals we also
[53:04] progress and i want to look at that
[53:06] first church age
[53:07] for a minute they saw the mighty acts of
[53:10] the holy ghost didn't they
[53:12] they see people influenced by god
[53:14] they've seen the dead rays they
[53:16] seen the sick hill they seen god walking
[53:19] right
[53:19] in the midst of them they had a fervent
[53:21] desire
[53:22] to please god didn't they and i'd like
[53:24] to go back and look at our lives how
[53:26] many remembers the time when we got
[53:28] saved you got saved
[53:30] and how on fire you were for god and how
[53:33] you know if you had the chance you would
[53:35] try to convert the whole world if you
[53:37] could
[53:38] you had such a desire to to express
[53:41] that the newfound joy that you had but
[53:44] after
[53:44] time just like anything we see here
[53:48] that the first church age after all that
[53:50] zeal
[53:51] and they became easy
[53:54] and they got used to the condition that
[53:56] they were in even as
[53:58] as our experiences grow sometimes we can
[54:00] grow relaxed in what god has given us
[54:04] sometimes we get to a place in our life
[54:06] to where
[54:07] that zeal that we once had was no longer
[54:09] there
[54:11] we've all been there i've been there
[54:12] many times and where
[54:14] once when we read the bible and listen
[54:16] to the message it had such a
[54:18] a a new a new found meaning to us but
[54:20] after
[54:21] time as time goes on before you know
[54:24] we're not reading the bible as much
[54:26] and before no before long we're not
[54:28] listening to the the message as
[54:29] much there comes a place in our
[54:32] experience where we must have a renewing
[54:34] of the holy ghost
[54:35] paul says i die what daily
[54:38] he's not dying weekly or monthly but
[54:41] it's something that is happening
[54:43] every day of his life and we get to a
[54:45] place where we can grow
[54:46] stagnant in our experience with god
[54:49] just like the first churches brother
[54:51] branham said they had the right spirit
[54:55] they had the new birth right there they
[54:56] had it but after
[54:58] time they left their first love and
[55:01] after time in our
[55:02] human walk with god it's very easy to do
[55:04] with all the the cares of life coming
[55:06] upon us and having
[55:08] a family and a job and before no it just
[55:11] we grow stagnant and what god has given
[55:14] us but there is a renewing here tonight
[55:16] where this communist service we don't
[55:18] have to leave the same
[55:19] but we can leave here so close to god i
[55:22] said this morning so close to god
[55:23] that the devil don't know what to do
[55:25] with you you could get to that
[55:27] experience with god
[55:29] but it takes a daily dining out where
[55:31] god i need you god
[55:33] not just coming to service on wednesday
[55:34] and sunday but
[55:36] every day that we wake up every morning
[55:38] that we wake up
[55:39] we get a new experience with god we can
[55:42] live so close to god that one day would
[55:43] be like enoch
[55:45] it rapture out of here it is happening
[55:49] but if satan had his way in your life
[55:51] he'd take your life like he did the rest
[55:52] of the world
[55:53] and just corrupt it and pollute it and
[55:55] throw you away
[55:57] satan don't care for you young people
[55:59] satan don't care what you do
[56:02] he is willing to destroy your life here
[56:03] tonight and we begin to see
[56:05] that the first church age relaxed in
[56:08] their experience
[56:10] brother branham says here at a prophet
[56:14] like unto moses he said as the
[56:16] conversation went on
[56:17] it must have been satan who looked out
[56:19] from behind the clouds and said i've
[56:20] caught them alone
[56:22] he's not with him now is my time to get
[56:25] even with him
[56:27] that's how satan walks that's the way he
[56:29] watches
[56:30] that's the opportunity he waits for is
[56:32] to get one time
[56:33] that we go out on what we call a little
[56:35] social fun
[56:37] or play card or tensor rally or
[56:39] something that isn't godly
[56:41] he waits to catch you off guard waits to
[56:44] get to a place where the church
[56:46] has got lukewarm has got too busy doing
[56:49] something else
[56:51] that is what he attacks he's away from
[56:53] them
[56:54] now is my opportunity brother branham is
[56:56] saying here satan is
[56:57] watching you looking for a weakness
[57:02] satan if i can say it like this is not
[57:04] stupid
[57:06] he won't attack you when you're at your
[57:08] your best
[57:09] he won't attack you when you're sitting
[57:10] on cloud nine or or when you just come
[57:13] out of a meeting
[57:14] he will attack you when you're at your
[57:15] lowest point in your life
[57:18] he will hit you with depression and
[57:20] oppression it seems like mental
[57:22] oppression is one thing
[57:24] that is on the rampage today is a mental
[57:26] oppression everybody's fighting
[57:28] depression and anxiety and
[57:30] and they're they're getting caught up
[57:32] right here
[57:33] and brother brown said the greatest
[57:34] battle ever fought is right here
[57:38] because if satan can get you down
[57:39] mentally he has got you beat
[57:43] so he's looking for a weakness in your
[57:45] life
[57:46] where he will come and attack you that's
[57:48] why we must always have our guard up and
[57:51] our shield up no matter
[57:52] what situations we're getting you say
[57:53] brother colby is it wrong to fight
[57:55] depression no
[57:56] no but you don't have to be succumbed by
[57:58] the depression
[58:00] we will fight anxiety in the lives that
[58:01] we live in but we don't have to be
[58:03] succumbed by it but we can overcome it
[58:07] you believe that the bible says that it
[58:11] was in the days of noah they were eating
[58:13] and drinking and marrying so they're
[58:16] doing these
[58:17] normal natural things but they were so
[58:19] caught up
[58:20] with the cares of life until god was
[58:23] pushed aside there's a reason why god is
[58:25] standing
[58:26] on the outside of the church in this age
[58:27] knocking knocking
[58:29] because the cares of life has pushed god
[58:31] right out
[58:33] you believe that so we see
[58:36] 20 years from the birth of the church
[58:39] they begin
[58:39] to get relaxed and in this relaxed stage
[58:43] satan came in and sold his seed
[58:47] just as he sowed his seed and eve satan
[58:50] will try to sow his seed in your heart
[58:52] by planting doubt
[58:53] planting fear planted uncertainty and
[58:58] depression but
[58:59] we may be living in an age of
[59:00] uncertainty but there is one thing that
[59:02] is certain that's the word of god
[59:04] and no matter what we go through in our
[59:07] natural life the word of god promised
[59:09] that he would never leave you nor
[59:11] forsake you that he would be there until
[59:13] the very end
[59:14] and i believe no matter what we go
[59:16] through god will be there to guide us
[59:19] but satan will try to plant the doubt of
[59:21] fear
[59:22] and doubt and anxiety and we can see
[59:25] that in our natural walk
[59:28] we don't pray as we used to we don't
[59:29] read as we used to we become
[59:32] relaxed in the experience that we once
[59:34] have but just like if i could say this
[59:36] just like a marriage
[59:37] i'm not relying on the experience i
[59:39] first had
[59:40] when i first got married to my wife but
[59:42] i'm hoping that that love
[59:44] is getting stronger and stronger every
[59:46] day
[59:47] going on in 10 years of marriage and be
[59:50] honest i i've got blessed with a
[59:52] a beautiful wife and she's not here
[59:54] tonight um
[59:56] the lord has blessed me but if i am not
[59:59] careful
[1:00:00] i can grow stagnant even in that
[1:00:02] relationship
[1:00:04] but brandon says the natural always
[1:00:06] types the spiritual
[1:00:08] and if our love and renewal for our my
[1:00:10] wife
[1:00:11] must be daily renewed daily renewed what
[1:00:14] about our walk with god
[1:00:17] if we want our our marriage to prosper
[1:00:21] we must have a love shown to her day in
[1:00:24] and day out what about with god
[1:00:26] if we want our walk to to to flourish
[1:00:29] with god we must have a daily
[1:00:31] renewal but we see at the beginning
[1:00:36] once the zeal was taken away from once
[1:00:39] they became relaxed
[1:00:41] we see the beginning of the downfall of
[1:00:43] the church
[1:00:45] brother branham says here they have the
[1:00:46] right spirit
[1:00:48] they were writing a book of acts then
[1:00:49] they lost their passion
[1:00:51] they lost their zeal they backslid the
[1:00:54] ephesian age has presented to her the
[1:00:56] opportunity for god's best
[1:00:59] and for a while she prevailed and then
[1:01:01] relaxed
[1:01:03] and in that unguarded moment satan
[1:01:04] planted the seed
[1:01:06] of complete ruin if we can turn
[1:01:09] to jude one and one and one just give me
[1:01:12] a few minutes
[1:01:13] more minutes we'll we don't want to take
[1:01:15] up too much time for tonight
[1:01:21] jude wanted one when you there say amen
[1:01:25] so jew the servant of jesus christ and
[1:01:28] the brother of james
[1:01:30] to them that are sanctified by god the
[1:01:32] father and preserve in jesus christ and
[1:01:34] cult
[1:01:35] mercy unto you and peace and love be
[1:01:38] multiplied
[1:01:39] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[1:01:41] write unto you the common salvation
[1:01:44] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:01:46] and exhort you
[1:01:47] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:01:49] the faith
[1:01:50] that was once delivered unto the saints
[1:01:54] we see that satan didn't move
[1:01:57] and in full force but he moved in under
[1:02:00] cover
[1:02:01] do you believe that as a spirit as an
[1:02:04] anointing an angel of light as a
[1:02:05] deception he moved
[1:02:07] in i'm so glad for the message of the
[1:02:10] hour that actually showed us what this
[1:02:11] deception looks like
[1:02:13] that showed us what this angel of light
[1:02:16] looks like
[1:02:17] you believe it and you know it would be
[1:02:20] very
[1:02:22] easy you know if i knew that
[1:02:25] i was going to have a a
[1:02:28] a a robber come in and break in at my
[1:02:30] house at a certain certain time
[1:02:33] i would be prepared for it
[1:02:37] i would be ready for this guy when he
[1:02:38] came in and we can see here that the
[1:02:41] message came
[1:02:42] and revealed to us what is taking place
[1:02:44] so we would be ready
[1:02:46] do you believe that paul says here
[1:02:49] beware of wolves
[1:02:51] and sheep's clothing and we can see that
[1:02:52] in a tiny way a tiny sea that you can
[1:02:55] see
[1:02:55] the manifestation of this seed this is
[1:02:59] the harvest time where both seeds are
[1:03:01] coming to manifestation you believe that
[1:03:04] we understand that at the beginning when
[1:03:05] the seeds were
[1:03:06] planted that it was hard to tell them
[1:03:08] apart
[1:03:09] but now we're coming to the fruition of
[1:03:11] what these seeds are
[1:03:12] and we can see the manifestation of it
[1:03:16] amen brother branham says here that the
[1:03:18] ephesian age to the christianity
[1:03:20] at ephesus was where the jews lived at
[1:03:22] ephesus
[1:03:24] and it was founded about a.d 53 or 55
[1:03:27] christianity was planted there by saint
[1:03:30] paul later saint paul spent
[1:03:31] three years at ephesus paul's teaching
[1:03:34] brought great influence to the believers
[1:03:36] at ephesus
[1:03:37] next timothy was the first bishop of the
[1:03:39] church at ephesus
[1:03:41] paul wrote to the church at ephesus it
[1:03:43] says in paul's top it was a great church
[1:03:46] but ephesus means the very name of
[1:03:48] ephesus means let go
[1:03:50] relaxed backslidden
[1:03:53] which was called by god the backslidden
[1:03:55] church god acknowledged their first
[1:03:57] works he said
[1:03:58] their labor their patience but god
[1:04:01] rebuked their living
[1:04:03] leaving their first love for backsliding
[1:04:05] for no longer bearing
[1:04:08] light we see here satan is always
[1:04:10] looking
[1:04:11] for an entrance he will come in gently
[1:04:14] so suddenly we don't realize that it's
[1:04:16] even there and then before we
[1:04:18] realize it he becomes very harmful
[1:04:23] amen brother can i continue on in this
[1:04:25] quote
[1:04:26] brother branham says here in the
[1:04:27] ephesian age in the church age book
[1:04:29] chapter 3
[1:04:30] the very name ephesus has a strange
[1:04:32] compound meaning aimed at and relaxed
[1:04:35] the high aspirations of this church that
[1:04:38] had begun with the fullness of the
[1:04:39] spirit the death of god
[1:04:41] whereby they were aiming at the high
[1:04:43] calling of god began to give way
[1:04:45] to a less watchful attitude a lesser
[1:04:48] dent following of jesus christ began
[1:04:51] to manifest itself as an omen that on
[1:04:53] the future ages of the physical vehicle
[1:04:55] called the church was sink
[1:04:57] to the awfulness of the depths of satan
[1:05:00] it had become relaxed it was drifting
[1:05:03] already the age was backsliding
[1:05:05] it had left its first love
[1:05:08] the tiny seed planted at the ephesian
[1:05:10] age would one day grow
[1:05:12] in the spirit of error until all foul
[1:05:14] birds of the air would roost
[1:05:16] in its branches so offensive to a human
[1:05:19] reasoning that that little plant
[1:05:21] appeared in the new eve the new church
[1:05:24] then again she would be deceived by
[1:05:25] satan and says
[1:05:27] the ephesian age had presented to her
[1:05:29] the opportunity for god's best
[1:05:32] and for a while and then she relaxed and
[1:05:34] in that unguarded
[1:05:35] moment satan planted his seed of
[1:05:37] complete run brother branham also says
[1:05:39] here this guy isn't called nothing to
[1:05:41] see he's a white horse
[1:05:43] the rider has no arrows for his bow did
[1:05:45] you notice that
[1:05:46] he had a bow but there there's nothing
[1:05:49] said about having any arrows he's a
[1:05:52] bluff here tonight and i can say that
[1:05:54] satan is a bluff here tonight he wants
[1:05:57] to make you feel that he's got control
[1:05:59] over your life
[1:06:00] but let me tell you something he has a
[1:06:02] ball with no arrows
[1:06:04] he has a bark but he has no body you
[1:06:06] don't have to be deceived
[1:06:08] by what satan is telling you there's a
[1:06:10] lot of mind battles that we face that
[1:06:12] we're not worthy enough that we're not
[1:06:13] good enough that this message ain't for
[1:06:15] us if it wasn't for you you wouldn't be
[1:06:17] sitting here tonight
[1:06:18] god could have left you in the state
[1:06:20] that you were in but he felt it is hard
[1:06:22] to call you and bring you out
[1:06:24] amen do you believe that he wanted you
[1:06:27] he longed for you that's the reason he
[1:06:29] came down
[1:06:30] so for the bread was saying here he's a
[1:06:32] bluff tonight
[1:06:35] don't be succumbed right here in the
[1:06:36] mind
[1:06:39] says here right but maybe he's got a lot
[1:06:41] of thunder but no lightning but you find
[1:06:43] out
[1:06:43] christ has both lightning and thunder
[1:06:47] for out of his mouth goes in two uh
[1:06:49] sharp two edges sore and he smites the
[1:06:51] nation with it
[1:06:52] this guy can't smite nothing see he's
[1:06:55] playing the part of a hypocrite and he's
[1:06:56] going forth
[1:06:58] riding as a white horse going out to
[1:07:01] conquer
[1:07:02] now also in the same message brother
[1:07:04] branham says here a white horse rider
[1:07:05] went out
[1:07:06] see he's mighty in his conquering power
[1:07:09] he's a great fellow in his conquering
[1:07:11] power you want to tell
[1:07:12] you want me to tell you who he is he's
[1:07:14] the antichrist
[1:07:15] exactly what he is now because you see
[1:07:19] if an antichrist jesus said the two
[1:07:21] would be so close together
[1:07:23] that would it deceive the very elect
[1:07:26] if i'm so glad for the word if if
[1:07:30] it were possible but it says here it is
[1:07:33] not
[1:07:33] possible are you so thankful for that
[1:07:37] that we won't be deceived amen
[1:07:41] but we see here if i can continue on
[1:07:43] just a little longer
[1:07:45] sid never starts fully grown
[1:07:48] if we seen the devil for what he really
[1:07:51] is
[1:07:52] we would have no part of him we'd want
[1:07:55] nothing to do with the sin
[1:07:57] but he has come in as an angel of light
[1:08:00] it starts out very small do you believe
[1:08:03] it
[1:08:04] but with a tiny seed a tiny spirit
[1:08:07] something that
[1:08:08] didn't seem harmful has now turned into
[1:08:11] something very
[1:08:12] harmful and if i can use this
[1:08:14] illustration the same as
[1:08:16] a a young man or a girl that has
[1:08:20] feelings for one another
[1:08:22] and if we're not careful satan can take
[1:08:24] those feelings
[1:08:25] and pervert them
[1:08:28] it takes just a brief moment of holding
[1:08:31] hands and then a hug
[1:08:32] they didn't embrace and before you know
[1:08:34] they have completely
[1:08:36] committed or submitted to the devil and
[1:08:38] satan has taken their time
[1:08:40] and his church and perverted it we see
[1:08:44] satan came into something that was so
[1:08:45] inoffensive so slightly
[1:08:47] so cunningly something that didn't seem
[1:08:50] bad at all
[1:08:52] are you with me here this tonight
[1:08:54] revelation 6 2 is said then i saw
[1:08:56] a and behold a white horse he thou
[1:08:59] sat on him had a bowl and a crown was
[1:09:01] given unto him
[1:09:03] and he went forth conquering
[1:09:06] and to conquer brother branham says here
[1:09:07] in the ephesian age he says the very
[1:09:09] religion of ephesians
[1:09:10] types out perfectly the first church age
[1:09:13] and it sets the tenor
[1:09:15] of of ages to come in the first place
[1:09:18] the magnificent temple of diana
[1:09:20] that was so many years in building
[1:09:22] housed in its sacred courts
[1:09:24] the most lustrous and obstructive image
[1:09:26] of dying that one could imagine
[1:09:28] she was absolute absolutely unlike any
[1:09:31] other images seated and the other
[1:09:33] temples dedicated to her
[1:09:35] she was simply an almost shapeless
[1:09:37] female figure that finally sunk
[1:09:39] in a block of wood from which she was
[1:09:40] carved and her two arms were
[1:09:43] formed of two simple iron bars and
[1:09:46] perfectly this depicts the spirit of the
[1:09:48] antichrist loosed
[1:09:50] in the first age that he was loosed in
[1:09:52] the midst of the people yet took no
[1:09:54] shape as to alarm to people
[1:09:56] yet the two arms of iron bars showed
[1:09:58] that it was his intent
[1:10:00] to crush the work of god as he made
[1:10:04] his enroll so no one noticed what he was
[1:10:07] doing but one day they wouldn't notice
[1:10:09] that with these arms of iron
[1:10:11] his deeds became a doctrine and his
[1:10:13] doctrine became the law
[1:10:15] of an empire you believe it the sin in
[1:10:18] ephesus was so shapeless it didn't
[1:10:20] alarm anybody but brother bram says here
[1:10:23] satan presented something to them
[1:10:25] it came in his purpose was to destroy
[1:10:28] that age and satan's purpose in our life
[1:10:31] is to destroy
[1:10:32] your life do you believe
[1:10:36] it amen
[1:10:41] brother branham says here but this that
[1:10:43] thou has that thou hateth the deeds of
[1:10:45] the nickelodeons which i hate
[1:10:47] the true vine hated the formal deeds of
[1:10:49] the nickelodeon so did god
[1:10:51] what deeds in the ephesian age in the
[1:10:53] church of ephesus became a doctrine in
[1:10:55] the pergamos church
[1:10:56] and in ephesus the first church it was a
[1:10:59] it was a deeds
[1:11:00] and the next church became a doctrine
[1:11:02] can you hear it do you understand it now
[1:11:04] it was a deed in ephesus and watch over
[1:11:06] here in pergamus it became a doctrine
[1:11:09] it just started there in a little baby
[1:11:11] form now in a minute we're going to find
[1:11:13] out what that was
[1:11:15] he says now in paul's wolves is the
[1:11:17] deeds of the nickelodeons
[1:11:19] can we turn to revelations two and six
[1:11:21] give me 15 more minutes
[1:11:24] i hope this is a blessing here tonight
[1:11:28] this is not a beat down i promise we're
[1:11:30] going to get to something good here in a
[1:11:31] minute
[1:11:33] if revelations two and six foot this
[1:11:36] that thou
[1:11:37] has that thou hate is the deeds of the
[1:11:38] niculadians
[1:11:40] which i also hate we understand that a
[1:11:42] deed was just a saying
[1:11:45] he presented it in such a way that it
[1:11:47] looked so good that he wasn't
[1:11:49] trying to kill but that was his purpose
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] amen can we turn to also daniel 11 21.
[1:12:09] amen daniel 11 and 21 it says and in his
[1:12:15] estate shall stand up a vile person
[1:12:18] to whom they should not give the honor
[1:12:20] of the kingdom
[1:12:21] but he shall come in peaceably and
[1:12:24] obtain the kingdom
[1:12:26] by flatteries brother branham says here
[1:12:30] remember in the church ages when we
[1:12:31] opened the first church age back then
[1:12:33] we found out the holy spirit was against
[1:12:35] a certain thing that got started
[1:12:38] in that church age and that was called
[1:12:39] the deeds of the nickelodeons you
[1:12:41] remember
[1:12:42] nicole means to conquer laity means the
[1:12:44] church the laity nickelodeons
[1:12:46] to conquer the laity to take the holy
[1:12:49] spirit out of the
[1:12:50] church and give it to one holy man and
[1:12:51] we can see that's what satan is trying
[1:12:53] to do
[1:12:53] is take the power of god out of the
[1:12:55] churches
[1:12:58] amen take the deliverance that god has
[1:13:00] out of the churches where it's a
[1:13:02] powerless church today
[1:13:03] but i believe that there is a powerful
[1:13:05] church here tonight that will not be
[1:13:07] succumbed by the devil's tactics but
[1:13:09] will would attack him and destroy him
[1:13:11] with power and authority
[1:13:13] you believe that says notice nicholaity
[1:13:16] a saiyan in one church it became a
[1:13:18] doctrine in the next church age
[1:13:20] and in the third church it was
[1:13:22] enforcement and they had the nazi
[1:13:24] council and it was there made a doctrine
[1:13:29] in a church the seed that was planted
[1:13:33] grew from a deed into a doctrine because
[1:13:36] it was not removed as a seed
[1:13:38] and we all know according to the law of
[1:13:42] growing
[1:13:43] only the only way for anything to grow
[1:13:45] is to water it
[1:13:47] to have the proper ground and the proper
[1:13:49] sunlight
[1:13:50] for you we can prevent doubt from plant
[1:13:53] being planted in our mind and grow it if
[1:13:55] we don't
[1:13:56] water it do you believe that
[1:14:00] we don't have to let fear be planted in
[1:14:02] our mind we can
[1:14:03] we can cut it off we can stop the root
[1:14:05] of bitterness
[1:14:06] you believe it amen okay we'll move on
[1:14:10] so we see here that one seed made a way
[1:14:12] for every demonic spirit of hell
[1:14:14] to be unleashed brother branham says
[1:14:16] here if i can continue on with this
[1:14:17] quote to see how it started in the early
[1:14:20] church it was called deeds
[1:14:21] then it became a doctrine it became the
[1:14:23] standard it became the unbending way it
[1:14:26] finally took over and god
[1:14:28] was pushed aside oh it started so small
[1:14:31] so quietly so inoffensively it looked so
[1:14:33] good it seemed so sound
[1:14:35] then i caught hold and like a python and
[1:14:37] squeezed out the very breath
[1:14:39] and killed all the spirituality that was
[1:14:41] in the church
[1:14:43] there was a false vine oh that false
[1:14:45] vine is subtle
[1:14:46] it's like an angel of light until it
[1:14:48] gets a hold of you now i want to say
[1:14:50] that i believe in leadership
[1:14:51] but it's not the leadership of men i
[1:14:53] believe in i believe in the leadership
[1:14:55] of the holy
[1:14:56] ghost coming through the word do you
[1:14:57] believe that
[1:14:59] because i believe also that god has sent
[1:15:00] men in church
[1:15:02] men are gifted by the spirit and they
[1:15:04] will keep the church in order i believe
[1:15:06] that
[1:15:06] i believe also that the church is ruled
[1:15:08] over by men that god has sent to take
[1:15:10] charge
[1:15:11] but that rule is by the word so that is
[1:15:14] not every man
[1:15:15] really ruling but the spirit of god for
[1:15:18] the word
[1:15:18] and the spirit are one
[1:15:22] i'm going to skip through some of this
[1:15:23] here that's why sin cannot be tolerated
[1:15:26] in the body do you believe it sin is
[1:15:28] like a cancer it starts
[1:15:30] with just a backslidden cell and from
[1:15:33] there it grows until it finally destroys
[1:15:35] that person's life
[1:15:36] until god intervenes you believe that
[1:15:39] but i believe god
[1:15:40] can deliver amen
[1:15:44] so we see sin always progresses sin has
[1:15:46] the quality
[1:15:48] of leaven if anything that is contrary
[1:15:52] to the word comes into your life it will
[1:15:54] grow
[1:15:55] into the entire cycle just give me 10
[1:15:56] minutes 10 minutes i'm watching the
[1:15:58] clock here
[1:15:59] so we see that this cyclist the
[1:16:00] antichrist false prophet
[1:16:03] and then the beast so we understand the
[1:16:04] best time to kill
[1:16:06] anything is in the early stage
[1:16:10] the further sin progresses the harder it
[1:16:12] is to deal with it the
[1:16:13] further anybody allows sin to grow in
[1:16:15] their life the more
[1:16:16] beast-like it will become the cycle of
[1:16:20] sin a deed that you hate
[1:16:21] you hate what you've done but remember
[1:16:23] sin has the quality of leaven
[1:16:26] it will grow and mature and then it
[1:16:29] becomes a doctrine
[1:16:30] then you're re then you reason why
[1:16:32] you're doing this and you come to the
[1:16:34] place where you're justifying yourself
[1:16:36] and while you do a certain thing
[1:16:38] then you become a false prophet now you
[1:16:40] have a teaching on why
[1:16:41] you're doing what you're doing amen
[1:16:45] and then it moves into a crown where it
[1:16:47] receives a a full endorsement
[1:16:50] we understand that it always takes time
[1:16:53] for anything
[1:16:54] for people to get used to something
[1:16:57] an earring in a man's ear was evil in
[1:16:59] 1960 but we looked down in 2020 going to
[1:17:02] 2021
[1:17:04] it is acceptable for a man to wear
[1:17:05] earrings
[1:17:07] a woman cutting her hair and wearing
[1:17:09] trousers was evil in the 1950s but now
[1:17:11] after time in 2020 it is now it's
[1:17:14] accepted
[1:17:16] evil for a man to wear a neck chain or
[1:17:18] an arm chain but now
[1:17:20] it is accepted even the cycle of
[1:17:22] homosexuality
[1:17:24] it was once done in secret it was a
[1:17:25] curse in the family
[1:17:27] but now it is openly accepted and now
[1:17:29] it's a hate crime for you to speak
[1:17:31] against it
[1:17:33] it was a sin it was unacceptable it was
[1:17:35] disgusting for
[1:17:36] for someone to be gay but now you're the
[1:17:39] disgusting one if you talk against it
[1:17:42] it has come to a full cycle now what is
[1:17:44] good is evil what is evil is now
[1:17:46] good and acceptable if there's ever a
[1:17:49] time
[1:17:50] to make a stand it is right now is there
[1:17:53] ever a time to say i will now
[1:17:55] allow that junk in my family's home it
[1:17:57] is right now
[1:17:58] satan is on the prowl and if he can
[1:18:01] sneak in you're i don't care what it is
[1:18:03] through this or through
[1:18:04] watching this movie or doing that satan
[1:18:06] will get to you but right now
[1:18:09] it's a time to take a stand and say no i
[1:18:11] am not allowing you devil in my home
[1:18:14] in my mind because he will come in so
[1:18:17] subtly so unaware before we know it
[1:18:20] he has completely took that family took
[1:18:23] the church
[1:18:24] you believe it amen but i'd like to say
[1:18:28] no matter how society changes god's
[1:18:30] voice is still the same
[1:18:32] through all the darkness and the gloom
[1:18:34] that we living in there is still a light
[1:18:36] and there's still a voice that will
[1:18:37] will never change that will never be
[1:18:39] overcome by the devil
[1:18:41] amen can i continue on just a little
[1:18:42] longer
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:48] first peter 2 and 6 says in churning the
[1:18:50] cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes
[1:18:53] condemning them with an overthrow
[1:18:55] making them an example unto those that
[1:18:57] after should live ungodly
[1:19:00] and deliver just lot vexed with filthy
[1:19:02] conversation of the wicked
[1:19:04] for that righteous man dwelling among
[1:19:06] them and seeing and hearing vexed his
[1:19:07] righteous soul
[1:19:09] from day to day locked became vexed
[1:19:13] became weak became wore down by the
[1:19:15] condition that he was in
[1:19:17] and we can take it and look at lord's
[1:19:19] life and apply it to us if we're not
[1:19:20] careful we'll become
[1:19:21] weak with the conditions that we're
[1:19:23] living in we're living in such a
[1:19:26] hellish conditions if we're not careful
[1:19:29] satan can come in and wear us down with
[1:19:31] all the thoughts and
[1:19:33] but here tonight we can be renewed how
[1:19:35] many needs are renewing
[1:19:37] how many will say lord i need you here
[1:19:39] tonight he's here to do so
[1:19:41] amen i believe that we'll continue on
[1:19:44] just a little longer here
[1:19:47] so we see here james 1 15 says then when
[1:19:50] lust hath conceived
[1:19:52] and bringeth forth sin and sin when it
[1:19:54] is finished bringeth forth death
[1:19:56] do not air my beloved brethren
[1:19:59] it starts with a desire a lost then it
[1:20:02] is
[1:20:03] but only one remedy that can stop the
[1:20:06] cycle of sin and we can read it right
[1:20:07] here
[1:20:09] in revelations 2 15. so it says thou
[1:20:12] also them that hold the doctrines of the
[1:20:13] nickelodeons which i hate repent
[1:20:16] or else i will come quickly and fight
[1:20:18] against them with the sword
[1:20:21] of my mouth repent quickly it says
[1:20:25] brother branham says here we learn in no
[1:20:27] certain terms that this false vine is
[1:20:29] the vine of satan
[1:20:30] their gathering is of him saying they
[1:20:32] meet in the name of god and lie that
[1:20:34] they are christ's
[1:20:35] they preach they teach they baptize they
[1:20:37] worship they partake of various rights
[1:20:39] given by god to the church
[1:20:40] yet they are not of god but since they
[1:20:43] say they are
[1:20:44] god will hold them responsible and at
[1:20:47] each age he speaks of them and to them
[1:20:49] they remind us exactly of balaam he had
[1:20:51] the prophetic office he knew the proper
[1:20:53] approach unto god
[1:20:55] as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the
[1:20:57] clean beast yet
[1:20:58] he was not a true word prophet for when
[1:21:00] god told them not to go honor balak with
[1:21:03] his presence
[1:21:04] he sought to go anyway he was mo
[1:21:06] motivated by his lust for gold
[1:21:09] and prestige god let him go
[1:21:12] the perfect will of god gave him gave
[1:21:15] way to the permissive will of god
[1:21:16] because
[1:21:17] of the heart desire of balaam god
[1:21:20] actually said go ahead did god change
[1:21:22] his mind no sir
[1:21:24] god had his way regardless of balaam
[1:21:25] going balaam did not annul the will of
[1:21:28] god
[1:21:29] god had his way regardless it was balaam
[1:21:32] who was the loser for he bypassed
[1:21:36] the word but lebron says this here as
[1:21:40] musicians get ready to come
[1:21:43] it says your eternal destination is a
[1:21:45] choice
[1:21:47] and maybe some of you tonight will make
[1:21:49] that choice where you will spend
[1:21:50] eternity
[1:21:51] and before the service ends tonight
[1:21:54] there will be one time if you turn god
[1:21:56] down
[1:21:56] many times there'll be one time you turn
[1:21:58] him down for the last time
[1:22:00] there is a line between mercy and
[1:22:02] judgment it is a dangerous thing for a
[1:22:05] man or a woman or girl
[1:22:06] to step across that line for there's no
[1:22:09] return when you step across that
[1:22:11] deadline
[1:22:12] so tonight it might be the time that
[1:22:15] many will make their decision
[1:22:17] where will we spend our endless
[1:22:21] eternity if i can say this tonight put
[1:22:24] an end to sin before it has ever crowned
[1:22:28] before it ever gets too far in our life
[1:22:30] tonight let's make a new dedication to
[1:22:32] god and say you know what i've
[1:22:33] i've allowed things in my life but
[1:22:36] tonight lord i need
[1:22:37] i need you to come down and renew my
[1:22:40] vision
[1:22:41] i've gotten tired i've gotten weary i've
[1:22:43] gotten weak in my fight with the devil
[1:22:46] but tonight god can renew you he can
[1:22:49] take the skills off your eyes i believe
[1:22:51] that don't you
[1:22:53] there's nothing too impossible for god
[1:22:56] no how many has ever had
[1:22:59] did a flower been no
[1:23:03] i wanted to until i seen how much work
[1:23:05] was involved in it
[1:23:08] but my mom and dad has a a beautiful
[1:23:10] flower bed
[1:23:11] and it took them months
[1:23:15] and tons of money to to get this flower
[1:23:17] bed to where it was beautiful and
[1:23:18] i remember my mother being out there on
[1:23:22] the first flower bed the first day was
[1:23:24] done
[1:23:24] you see a little weed pop up oh my mom
[1:23:27] was out there plucking that thing out
[1:23:28] faster than
[1:23:29] she was quick well the next day you know
[1:23:32] how weeds grow they continue to grow
[1:23:33] they never die
[1:23:34] so she goes over there and and plucks it
[1:23:36] out again
[1:23:37] well before you before you knew it she
[1:23:40] lost the zeal and the newness of this
[1:23:42] flower
[1:23:42] that was once new was now it's 110
[1:23:45] degrees outside or whatever it was and
[1:23:47] she's looking at her
[1:23:48] flower bed and seeing these weeds grow
[1:23:49] and she's like
[1:23:52] you know what i'll go off there and i'll
[1:23:54] just cut them off
[1:23:55] so she cut them off and before long
[1:23:56] these weeds have grown and overtook her
[1:23:58] flower bed and she's like
[1:23:59] you know what i'm not even going to deal
[1:24:01] with it i'll just i'll do it tomorrow
[1:24:03] well now the weeds have overtaken her
[1:24:05] flower bed
[1:24:06] and and she grew lazy and helped my mom
[1:24:10] stop watching this
[1:24:11] and and lax did it instead of cutting
[1:24:13] and plucking them up by the rushing
[1:24:14] which is going just cutting them off cut
[1:24:16] we're getting a weeder
[1:24:17] josh go out there well these things are
[1:24:20] popping up and if we can take this and
[1:24:21] apply it to our lives
[1:24:23] we don't need to just cut off the
[1:24:26] problem in our life we need to pluck it
[1:24:28] out by the roots
[1:24:32] and because that problem that we face
[1:24:34] and fight we'll come back again
[1:24:36] and again and again that's where god can
[1:24:38] come down here tonight
[1:24:40] and he cannot just cut it off but he can
[1:24:43] completely pull it out by the roots in
[1:24:44] your life
[1:24:45] how many wants that here tonight see i'm
[1:24:48] more down lord
[1:24:50] with the cares of life i know this was a
[1:24:52] weird message for a communion service so
[1:24:54] forgive me in that aspect but i pray
[1:24:59] for myself lord i need a refueling
[1:25:02] may not leave this service here the same
[1:25:06] but lord lord as i see
[1:25:10] the the times changing and the
[1:25:13] conditions that we're living in lord may
[1:25:14] i never grow relaxed
[1:25:17] may i never get cold and informal in the
[1:25:19] experience that i have with you but lord
[1:25:20] may my love
[1:25:23] be ever growing if there's ever a time
[1:25:25] but we
[1:25:26] need to get closer to god it's now we
[1:25:29] can see
[1:25:30] prophecies prophecies being fulfilled at
[1:25:32] a rapid
[1:25:33] rapid rapid pace this is the time
[1:25:37] that we must sincerely seek god
[1:25:40] because he is coming he is coming
[1:25:44] i don't want to be left behind but i
[1:25:46] want to have oil in my lamp i want my
[1:25:48] land being trimmed
[1:25:49] for when he comes i will be ready
[1:25:53] heavenly father lord we love you tonight
[1:25:58] i know this was an odd message for our
[1:26:00] community service
[1:26:02] but i felt this was the direction that
[1:26:03] we needed to go
[1:26:06] and lord i pray here tonight that you
[1:26:09] can renew the minds
[1:26:12] renew the vision the zeal the pasture
[1:26:15] that we've had
[1:26:16] renew renew that tonight lord i know we
[1:26:19] get tired
[1:26:21] i know we get weary from fighting day in
[1:26:25] and day out lord and we ever we wonder
[1:26:27] if it will ever end but we know there's
[1:26:29] a promise that you're coming soon
[1:26:31] there's a land that was made for the
[1:26:33] overcomer
[1:26:35] lord give us the strength to endure just
[1:26:37] a little longer
[1:26:39] lord lift up the hands of the weak lord
[1:26:42] the feeble father the ones that don't
[1:26:44] feel like they can endure tonight lord
[1:26:46] give the strength to endure
[1:26:49] coming down lord and refresh our minds
[1:26:53] refresh our experience tonight
[1:26:57] oh we thank you for all you've done
[1:27:02] amen playing
[1:27:06] it's already done
[1:27:11] praise the lord
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] the battle is over
[1:27:18] victory is one
[1:27:21] it's already done
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:44] hallelujah
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:55] hold your hand up to the lord and say i
[1:27:57] believe this it's
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:12] already
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:27] and we're going to give you just a
[1:28:28] minute i believe the lord spoke to
[1:28:30] brother colby to come by and
[1:28:32] and speak these words to us tonight and
[1:28:35] there must be a reason for that and
[1:28:36] maybe there's something in your life
[1:28:38] that
[1:28:39] is just a seed that's there maybe it's
[1:28:40] just a thought
[1:28:42] maybe just a little bit of irritation
[1:28:45] with someone or
[1:28:46] just something that's there and satan
[1:28:48] would like to grow that into a root of
[1:28:50] bitterness and
[1:28:51] satan would like to take that whatever
[1:28:53] that is maybe that thought that you had
[1:28:55] and make it something
[1:28:56] that would dominate your life why don't
[1:28:58] you just ask the holy spirit to come
[1:29:01] down
[1:29:02] we'll just take a moment and say lord if
[1:29:04] there's any seeds of sin in my life
[1:29:06] anything that's not right lord take it
[1:29:08] out of me
[1:29:09] tonight i know i'm saved i know i'm a
[1:29:11] child of god but if there's something
[1:29:13] there that would
[1:29:14] get in the way of my communion with you
[1:29:16] would you just
[1:29:17] take that out of me lord and just just
[1:29:20] talk to him like that for a moment
[1:29:21] heavenly father we believe
[1:29:23] lord what was said tonight that satan
[1:29:26] would like to come in just like a
[1:29:28] a a white horse rider lord and some
[1:29:31] seem like so simple and and so pleasant
[1:29:34] but lord we see the end of it is death
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:37] the wages of sin is death lord i pray
[1:29:40] for myself tonight if there's anything
[1:29:42] that's unlike you
[1:29:43] that we come to the communion table lord
[1:29:46] we ask you to take it out lord we
[1:29:48] believe and we know
[1:29:49] that you're able to do that and so we
[1:29:51] come with our simple
[1:29:52] faith tonight and believe that you're
[1:29:54] able to remove these things from our
[1:29:56] life that are unlike you
[1:29:58] father may we worship you and realizing
[1:30:01] that just in a moment we can be forgiven
[1:30:03] lord we thank you for that
[1:30:04] thank you that there's an advocate that
[1:30:06] we have and we thank you for this time
[1:30:08] you've given us to remember you
[1:30:10] in everything we pray in jesus name amen
[1:30:14] amen if the brothers would come
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] and we'll uh we'll have you come
[1:30:22] and uh if you could have a brother
[1:30:25] direct the people to come if you could
[1:30:27] just
[1:30:27] continue playing um
[1:30:32] we're going to read first corinthians
[1:30:37] chapter 11.
[1:30:44] once we're done with the communion i'll
[1:30:45] give you an opportunity to be dismissed
[1:30:47] if you don't want to
[1:30:48] take part in the foot washing service or
[1:30:50] you can't for some reason
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:53] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23
[1:30:57] for i have received of the lord that
[1:30:59] which also i delivered unto you the lord
[1:31:02] jesus the same night in which he was
[1:31:03] betrayed took bread
[1:31:05] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:31:07] said take eat
[1:31:09] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:31:11] this do in remembrance of me
[1:31:14] after the same manner also he took the
[1:31:15] cup when he ends up saying this cup is
[1:31:17] the new testament of my blood
[1:31:19] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:31:21] remembrance of me
[1:31:22] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:31:24] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:31:26] death till he come
[1:31:28] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:31:30] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:31:31] unworthily
[1:31:32] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:31:34] the lord but let a man examine himself
[1:31:36] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:31:38] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:31:40] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:31:42] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:31:44] lord's body
[1:31:45] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:31:47] among you and many sleep
[1:31:49] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:31:50] should not be judged but when we are
[1:31:52] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:31:55] we should not be condemned with the
[1:31:56] world
[1:31:57] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:31:58] together to eat carry one for another
[1:32:00] and if any man hunger
[1:32:02] let him meet at home that you come not
[1:32:03] together into condemnation
[1:32:05] the rest will i set an order when i come
[1:32:15] heavenly father lord jesus we have the
[1:32:17] bread lord
[1:32:18] as a representative of your broken body
[1:32:21] i pray god that as it passes
[1:32:23] through lord the bodies of these people
[1:32:25] that take it
[1:32:27] i pray lord that as a body we would be
[1:32:29] whole it would be one
[1:32:31] you were broken so we could be whole we

[1:32:36] through the body that there would be
[1:32:38] healing take place tonight lord we
[1:32:39] believe that it could happen and
[1:32:41] we know we believe your word lord we're
[1:32:43] doing this by faith knowing there's
[1:32:45] nothing
