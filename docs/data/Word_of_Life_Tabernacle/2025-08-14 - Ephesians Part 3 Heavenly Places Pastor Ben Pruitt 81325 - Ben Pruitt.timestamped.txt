[32:36] Gyra.
[32:38] So glad you're my proiderider.
[32:42] Jehovah
[32:44] sea.
[32:47] Oh, you reign in victory.
[32:50] Jehovah Shalom.
[32:54] You are my prince of peace.
[32:59] Oh, I worship you because of who you
[33:04] are.
[33:06] Oh yes, I worship you because of who you
[33:13] are.
[33:14] We bow our heads together for just a
[33:16] moment.
[33:18] Maybe you've got a special need you'd
[33:20] like to make known by way of uplifted
[33:21] hand tonight. God sees those needs. We
[33:24] think of Wednesday night as prayer
[33:26] meeting tonight. So let's just have a
[33:28] little prayer meeting here at the
[33:29] beginning of the service.
[33:31] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you as
[33:34] our father, the one who made the heavens
[33:37] and the earth, the great one, Lord, and
[33:39] we thank you for all that you've done
[33:41] for us. We thank you for your goodness
[33:43] to us, Lord. I pray that you would just
[33:46] help us today. I pray that you'd help
[33:48] us, Lord, in our worship, Lord. That we
[33:51] would worship you in spirit and in
[33:52] truth. Lord, if we've committed any sins
[33:55] or done anything that's wrong, I pray
[33:57] you'd forgive us of it, Lord. these
[33:59] needs, Lord, that were represented by
[34:01] way of uplifted hand. I pray you'd meet
[34:04] every need. Lord, you know what they are
[34:06] and you're able to come and meet those
[34:08] needs. I pray you'd do it now. We thank
[34:10] you for doing it, Lord. We ask you to
[34:13] come and just move me out of the way and
[34:15] speak directly through your word to the
[34:17] people, Lord, to the eagles, Lord, that
[34:19] want to eat eagle food for you to grant
[34:22] it now. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:26] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[34:30] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three.
[34:33] Ephesians 1 and 3.
[34:36] Peter, those house mics are really loud
[34:38] in my monitors.
[34:40] Ephesians 1 and 3. We're going to uh
[34:44] approach this same verse again. I hope
[34:46] you're not bored with it already, but
[34:49] it's just something else that the Lord
[34:51] had impressed on my heart about this
[34:53] verse. And then we'll move on. And as we
[34:55] get into the book of Ephesians, we'll
[34:56] move a little bit faster. It won't take
[34:58] us 10 years to do it because we'll have
[35:01] gone over some of the the territory. But
[35:03] don't you love the word of God?
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it feed your soul? I pray that
[35:06] it does. And and I wanted to say tonight
[35:09] as you're turning there that how much I
[35:12] appreciate you coming tonight on a
[35:13] Wednesday night. I know it's the first
[35:15] week of school and for those of you that
[35:16] go to public school, that's a traumatic
[35:18] kind of thing. and and uh you're going
[35:21] and maybe to a new school or a new place
[35:23] and a new class and new teacher and uh
[35:26] so especially for you kids. I know
[35:28] that's hard, but you're here tonight and
[35:30] I appreciate that. I I really do. And
[35:32] for you teachers, just praying for a
[35:34] good year for you. I know brother Joel
[35:36] prayed with you Sunday. We're praying
[35:38] that the teachers and the students and
[35:40] you homeschooled families, I'm praying
[35:42] that you just have the best year you've
[35:43] ever had and that the kids will learn
[35:45] and and uh we just and that they'll be
[35:47] protected. We we want our children to
[35:49] have God's protection on them, don't we?
[35:51] We can only do so much.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; It takes him to provide real protection
[35:56] for our children. So, we want to do
[35:58] that. And we so thankful for you being
[36:00] here tonight. It just blessed me to you
[36:01] here tonight. Ephesians 1:3, "Blessed be
[36:04] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[36:06] Christ, who hath blessed us with all
[36:09] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[36:13] in Christ." I pray the Lord would add
[36:15] his blessing to the word. You may be
[36:16] seated.
[36:18] Paul is telling us what we have when we
[36:20] are in Christ. If you are in Christ, you
[36:24] have
[36:25] all someone say it with me, all
[36:28] spiritual blessings. If you are in
[36:30] Christ, you have all spiritual
[36:32] blessings. And then he says where you
[36:34] have it, you have it in heavenly places.
[36:37] In the Amplified Bible, this verse is is
[36:40] uh is this way. It's May blessing,
[36:42] praise, ludation, and eulogy be to the
[36:45] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[36:47] the Messiah, who has blessed us in
[36:50] Christ with every spiritual given by the
[36:53] Holy Spirit blessing in the heavenly
[36:55] realm. So these spiritual blessings are
[36:58] Holy Ghost blessings, as we would say,
[37:00] Holy Spirit blessings in heavenly places
[37:03] or a heavenly realm. In heavenly places
[37:06] is not just necessarily this building.
[37:09] This could be a a place where we meet in
[37:12] together, but we're meeting not just in
[37:15] a building, but our our spirits have
[37:17] lifted us up into heavenly places in
[37:20] Christ Jesus. And that's why it's so
[37:22] important to come together because when
[37:23] you come together, you're actually in a
[37:26] in a different assembly. You're not just
[37:28] assembling here in the flesh, but you're
[37:30] assembling on a spiritual level. You're
[37:33] assembling together. And and when we get
[37:35] all of our licks of fire together, it
[37:37] does something for us. Now, brother
[37:39] Brandham says in heavenly places. Now,
[37:41] just not out anywhere. In heavenly
[37:43] places, we're assembled in heavenly. It
[37:46] means that the position of the believer
[37:48] that if I'm prayed up, how many come
[37:50] prayed up tonight? If I'm prayed up,
[37:52] well, not very many of you. I guess
[37:54] maybe we do need to have a prayer
[37:56] meeting. How many come prayed up
[37:57] tonight? That's all right. You say,
[37:58] "What do I need to pray up?" Sometimes
[38:00] you just be that quick and say, "Lord,
[38:02] forgive me. Help me. And and and let me
[38:05] my spirit be right to hear the word of
[38:07] God." He said, "If I'm prayed up, you're
[38:08] prayed up." The church is prayed up, and
[38:10] we're ready for the message, and we have
[38:12] assembled ourselves together as saints,
[38:15] called out, baptized with the Holy
[38:17] Ghost, filled with God's blessings,
[38:19] called, elected, set together in
[38:22] heavenly places. Now, he said we are
[38:24] heavenlies in our souls,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; right now. We know we're not heavenlies
[38:29] in our bodies because some of you are
[38:31] hurting tonight. Some of us, we we have
[38:34] sicknesses and things that you deal with
[38:36] and and and there's things that come up.
[38:38] Maybe you're stressed out about
[38:39] something. Maybe you've got a a
[38:41] situation in your family or a situation
[38:43] at work that you're worried about. But
[38:46] but the thing is when you come together,
[38:48] you can come together in heavenly places
[38:50] no matter what's going on in your body
[38:52] because it's heaven's in our souls. Our
[38:54] spirits has brought us into a heavenly
[38:57] atmosphere. He said, "Oh, brother, there
[39:00] you are, a heavenly atmosphere." He
[39:01] said, "Oh, what could happen tonight?
[39:05] What could happen tonight if we would be
[39:07] sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere
[39:10] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[39:12] heart that's been regenerated and become
[39:15] a new creature in Christ Jesus." He
[39:18] said, "All sins under the blood in
[39:21] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[39:24] and our hearts lifted, sitting in
[39:27] heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[39:29] worshiping together in the heavenly
[39:32] places." So again, it's something more
[39:34] than just sitting here, but it's
[39:36] something about sitting together with
[39:38] our spirits united together in heavenly
[39:41] places. He said, "Did you ever sit in
[39:43] one?" He said, "Oh, I have set till I
[39:45] would weep for joy and say, God, never
[39:47] let me leave here." Have you ever been
[39:49] in a service like that? If it's been a
[39:51] while since you've been in the house of
[39:53] God and you said, "Lord, don't let me
[39:55] ever leave here. I want to feel this
[39:57] presence." And you need to get back to
[39:58] that. We need to get back to that moment
[40:00] when we realize, "Lord, I just want to
[40:02] be here. I want to enjoy church." And
[40:04] for some of you new Christians, there's
[40:06] just that special feeling about it. I'm
[40:08] glad I'm in the house of God. I I feel
[40:10] that the condemnation is gone. I feel
[40:12] that my load of sin is gone. But for
[40:15] some, it's been a while since you've
[40:16] really realized you were sitting in
[40:18] heavenly places. But if you come and
[40:20] your sins have been forgiven and you've
[40:22] been baptized with the Holy Ghost,
[40:23] that's where you're sitting tonight.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are we're born,
[40:30] listen, we're born by natural birth into
[40:34] an earthly place.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; How many realize that tonight? We were
[40:38] not born into heavenly places by natural
[40:41] birth, but we're born into heavenly
[40:42] places by spiritual birth. So, we must
[40:46] have a there must be something that
[40:48] takes place to make us worship together
[40:51] in heavenly places. Now, so we're born
[40:54] by natural birth into earthly places, an
[40:57] earthly realm, and an earthly
[40:59] atmosphere.
[41:01] And when the natural seed, I'll just say
[41:04] it like this, was quickened to life.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; When we were conceived, and then when we
[41:08] took the breath of life, when we come
[41:10] into the world,
[41:11] &gt;&gt; our birth places us into this earthly
[41:15] realm,
[41:17] &gt;&gt; right? That's what placed us here. We
[41:19] were placed, we didn't have to fight to
[41:21] get into it or or or try to get into it.
[41:25] We didn't get to choose where we would
[41:27] come, but our birth just placed us right
[41:30] into a heavenly realm in a certain
[41:32] family be based on the seed that we were
[41:37] &gt;&gt; right. We we become a part of a certain
[41:39] family. I want you to think with me
[41:41] tonight. And that place you in a certain
[41:43] place in the earth.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; So, and and and brother Brandham even
[41:47] tells us that God ordained that.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; How many know your natural birth was
[41:50] pre-planned?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Right? Go listen to things that are to
[41:53] be. Our natural birth was pre-planned.
[41:55] We're not here by accident. We're not
[41:57] here by chance. But God places us here
[42:00] for a reason. Now, but God will place
[42:02] you sometimes. I know there there's a
[42:04] lot of question about that. They said,
[42:05] "Well, why if God placed me somewhere
[42:07] did I ever move away from there?" Well,
[42:09] let me say this. God placed Abraham. His
[42:12] place was in the land of Canaan. But his
[42:15] birth birthed him into
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; of the Cales, right? His natural birth
[42:20] put him in an earthly realm of the
[42:23] Cales. But the realm he was supposed to
[42:25] be in,
[42:27] come on, was hundreds of miles away.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; But he was purposely put into so he
[42:34] could make a journey of faith.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And many of us have been purposely
[42:38] placed in our the family we were in in
[42:40] the place where maybe we weren't born in
[42:42] a message family. Maybe there was
[42:43] trouble in our family. Maybe we were
[42:45] born into a message family, but there
[42:47] was a lot of struggle and maybe we had
[42:49] reasons to even uh maybe blaspheme or
[42:51] deny the message, but there just
[42:53] something in us wouldn't wouldn't let us
[42:54] do it. Why was that? Because though we
[42:57] were born in a certain place, God knew
[42:59] that that that faith would carry us.
[43:01] There's something in our hearts that
[43:02] would carry us to another place. Aren't
[43:04] you glad for that tonight? He wanted
[43:07] Abraham to be in the land of Canaan. So,
[43:09] you were born into a natural realm. Now,
[43:11] think about it for just a moment. God
[43:13] wants every one of us who were in his
[43:15] mind. And he knows he he has determined
[43:17] that every one of us that were in his
[43:19] mind before the foundation of the world
[43:20] would actually come into this spiritual
[43:23] adoption, this spiritual land, this
[43:26] spiritual place, these heavenly places
[43:28] that we would come into that. He is he
[43:30] has predetermined that we would. But yet
[43:32] we have to we have to move our way
[43:34] there. We are we are transported from
[43:37] one realm to another
[43:40] &gt;&gt; because you were not meant to be down
[43:42] here. You're meant to be in heaven.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you go back before
[43:50] your natural birth,
[43:51] &gt;&gt; you were a child of God.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that, church?
[43:56] &gt;&gt; If we really believe that we were in the
[43:58] thoughts of God, it means that he had us
[44:00] in his mind before the foundation of the
[44:02] earth. And so what happened is that we
[44:04] were we were meant to be in heaven, but
[44:08] sin came in and we were we we had there
[44:11] was a fall and we were born in sin
[44:13] shaped in iniquity. But God called us
[44:15] out of that earthly atmosphere, that
[44:18] earthly realm into a heavenly realm or
[44:20] heavenly place.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And in our souls, we're sitting there
[44:23] already.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; In our souls, we've already made it.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; In our souls, we're already in heaven.
[44:30] But in our bodies, we haven't made it
[44:31] yet.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show it to you in just a
[44:35] moment. The Lord willing now. So, the
[44:38] natural seed was quickened to life and
[44:39] its birth placed it in an earthly realm.
[44:43] But as sinners, we were like all other
[44:45] sinners,
[44:47] right? Or mostly we did a lot of things
[44:50] we shouldn't have done
[44:52] because our position was earthly,
[44:57] &gt;&gt; right? Our position was earthly.
[45:00] Now, Brother Brandham says this, "And
[45:03] and yet there was something in us that
[45:05] wanted God, but we didn't know that. And
[45:09] so, we drank, smoked, maybe sat on a
[45:12] church pew board to death."
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; The word didn't mean nothing to us.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; But one day,
[45:23] &gt;&gt; an eagle flew overhead.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. We heard a scream. What
[45:27] changed? Come on, church. Listen. It's
[45:29] not so much where you were sitting. But
[45:31] when you heard it, it was your time.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ahead of myself a little
[45:35] bit, but our position has to change then
[45:38] from earthly. Just like the chicken
[45:40] coming up from an earthly position to a
[45:43] flying position, to a heavenly position.
[45:45] Romans chapter 3 and verse 9, it says
[45:48] this about us. This is the way we come
[45:50] to the earth. He said, "What then? Are
[45:51] we better than they? know we know wise.
[45:53] For we have before proved both Jews and
[45:55] Gentiles that they are all under sin. As
[45:58] it is written, there is none righteous,
[45:59] know not one. There is none that
[46:01] understand it. There's none that seeketh
[46:03] after God. They are all gone out of the
[46:05] way. They are together become
[46:07] unprofitable. There is none that doeth
[46:09] good, know not one. Romans 3:23 says,
[46:12] "All have sinned and come short of the
[46:14] glory of God." Psalms 51 and5 said,
[46:16] "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity. In
[46:19] sin did my mother conceive me. Psalms
[46:22] 58:3 says, "The wicked are estranged or
[46:26] separated from God from the womb. They
[46:29] go astray as soon as they be born,
[46:30] speaking lies."
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 20:9 says, "Who can say I have
[46:35] made my heart clean?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; I am pure from my sin."
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Now, we can stop there for a while.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 7:20. There is not a just
[46:46] man upon earth that doeth good and
[46:49] sinnth not. Come on, church. We want to
[46:52] judge everybody and look down our noses
[46:54] at everybody and and talk about how, oh,
[46:56] we were different. We can't think of any
[46:57] reason why we wouldn't be saved, you
[46:59] know, and and and boy, we just always
[47:01] been pretty good. I tell you what,
[47:03] that's that's probably the worst spirit
[47:04] that you can have is a religious spirit.
[47:06] I've told my kids that. I know they
[47:08] haven't experienced what other people
[47:10] have because we've held them in a place
[47:12] where they didn't have to. But that's
[47:13] the worst spirit you can have is a
[47:15] judgmental, critical, religious spirit
[47:17] that tries to say, "Well, I don't need
[47:19] to change. I don't need to repent. Every
[47:21] one of us do. There is none, he says
[47:23] that that that that that can say I've
[47:25] made my heart clean.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Pure from sin. Who can say that? You're
[47:32] born in an earthly realm, under earthly
[47:34] conditions, under the king of the earth,
[47:36] who is Satan.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; The prince of the power of the air. Born
[47:42] into that realm. This is Satan's Eden.
[47:45] We weren't born into God's Eden like
[47:47] Adam and Eve were. were born into
[47:49] Satan's Eden.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's not a just man upon
[47:54] earth that doeth good and sinth not. We
[47:56] can't change our spots. You young
[47:57] people, you remember a few weeks ago I
[47:59] told you about how, you know, a leopard
[48:01] can't can't wash his spots. Brother
[48:03] Brandham was in a quote. He said a
[48:05] leopard can't lick off his spots. Well,
[48:08] the Bible says that Jeremiah 13:23, "Can
[48:11] the Ethiopian change his skin?" In other
[48:14] words, if you're God made you a certain
[48:16] color, can you change that?
[48:18] I guess you could
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Michael Jackson tried but it didn't
[48:22] work.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the
[48:28] leopard is spots? Then may you also do
[48:31] good that are accustomed to do evil. In
[48:34] other words, if you come in the world
[48:35] speaking lies, how can you get rid of
[48:37] that? How do you get rid of them spots?
[48:40] Is what Nicodemus wanted to know when he
[48:42] come to Jesus one day. He was a
[48:44] righteous man. A man who kept the letter
[48:46] of the law.
[48:47] And he was a he was a man who had had
[48:50] everything from his childhood ordered
[48:52] just right. Just like some of our
[48:54] children that we've tried to keep them
[48:56] from all kinds of things and help him
[48:58] out any way that we can. And it says in
[49:00] John chapter 3, there was a man of the
[49:02] Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of
[49:04] the Jews. The same came to Jesus by
[49:06] night said unto him, "Rabbi, we know
[49:08] that thou art a teacher come from God."
[49:11] Rabbi means teacher, but it's a very
[49:13] respectful term. Rabbi, we know thou art
[49:16] a teacher come from God. For no man can
[49:18] do these miracles that thou doest except
[49:21] God be with him. And Jesus answered and
[49:25] said unto him, verily, verily I say unto
[49:26] you, except a man be born again, he
[49:29] cannot see. That word see is to
[49:31] understand the kingdom of God.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Why? You were born in an earthly realm.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You were born in earthly places.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; You didn't sit in heavenly places when
[49:41] you come to the earth. So Nicodemus said
[49:44] unto him, "How can a man be born when
[49:45] he's old, can he enter the second time
[49:47] into his mother's womb and be born?" And
[49:49] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[49:51] unto thee, except a man be born of water
[49:53] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
[49:55] the kingdom of God. That which is born
[49:57] of the flesh is flesh. That which is
[49:59] born of the spirit is spirit. So if
[50:01] you're flesh born, you're bound in
[50:03] earthly places."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Right. And and if you're spirit born,
[50:08] you are in heavenly places.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Do you see it tonight? They You can't be
[50:12] spirit born and not be in heavenly
[50:15] places.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; You don't slip out of heavenly places
[50:20] &gt;&gt; when you face trials,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:23] &gt;&gt; When you get discouraged,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; right? When when you're when when you
[50:27] struggle in some way. You don't just
[50:29] slip out of heavenly places. It doesn't
[50:30] suddenly become a something that said,
[50:33] "Well, he was in heavenly places, but
[50:35] now, you know, now he he he just he
[50:39] can't get back there. He's just unable
[50:40] to." doing. No. If you've ever been in
[50:42] heavenly places,
[50:45] you can be in heavenly places.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; You're born into heavenly places.
[50:51] See, once they crossed over, they were
[50:55] in the land,
[50:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:58] &gt;&gt; They were in the land.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Now, some chose not to cross over.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; They stayed on the other side. Right?
[51:04] They come twothirds of the way there and
[51:06] didn't go on all the way in. But those
[51:09] who crossed over were there.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Right? Once you've heard it, you can't
[51:12] unhear it. Once you receive the
[51:14] revelation, you can't you can't get it.
[51:16] You can't give it back.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Right? You're here,
[51:20] &gt;&gt; but now you got to fight,
[51:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Now you got to go to war. Now you got to
[51:24] now you got to fight to pay attention on
[51:26] a Wednesday night. Now you got to fight
[51:28] to to through through struggle and
[51:30] heartache and worry and fear, all of
[51:32] those things. But what is it there for?
[51:34] You were you were born into heavenly
[51:36] places. You were put in that realm to
[51:37] fight.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ahead of myself in in a
[51:41] major way, but let's let's go on.
[51:42] Listen. He said, you can't you can't be
[51:44] b placed in heavenly places by family,
[51:47] &gt;&gt; right? You're not born into it by
[51:49] natural family, by your last name. You
[51:51] can't you're not born into it by effort,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Right. You could go and and go to the
[51:56] youth camp and jump and shout and run.
[51:58] And I'm so thankful that we can do that.
[52:00] I'm thankful for the freedom to do that.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; I'd like to see more of it. But but you
[52:05] don't get into heavenly places by
[52:06] effort,
[52:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; You don't get in by money. You can't buy
[52:10] your way in,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:11] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to have heavenlies
[52:14] in your soul, and that's to be born
[52:16] again.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; You've got to be translated from an
[52:19] earthly desire to a heavenly desire to
[52:22] from a carnal desire to a spiritual
[52:24] desire. This is why so many people
[52:26] struggle. It's why so many people can't
[52:28] keep the victory. It's what brother
[52:29] Brandham talked about. Satan deceives
[52:31] them that well, I felt a good feeling
[52:32] one time. I had this going for me one
[52:34] time. I was doing pretty good. But if
[52:36] you find yourself up and down and in and
[52:38] out and you can't seem to serve the
[52:40] Lord, maybe it's time to come back and
[52:42] say, "Lord, I want to be translated into
[52:44] heavenly places."
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; The word delivered. Colossians 1:13. I I
[52:53] my mind is on the end of this and I'm
[52:55] just keep I keep going ahead of myself.
[52:58] But Colossians 1:13, he says, "Whoath
[53:01] delivered us from the power of
[53:02] darkness?" Aren't you glad to be
[53:03] delivered?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; The word delivered means rescued.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; He's rescued us
[53:09] &gt;&gt; from Hallelujah.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; From the power of darkness,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; which we couldn't fight on our own, by
[53:16] the way.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And hath translated us,
[53:20] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[53:20] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son. So
[53:23] translated is uh the word it's I cause
[53:27] to change its place. I move out of its
[53:31] place. Notice this is not what we did.
[53:35] It's what he did.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Right? You did not translate yourself,
[53:40] your soul into a heavenly place. He had
[53:44] to translate you from an earthly place
[53:47] into a heavenly place. Are y'all is Are
[53:49] we okay so far?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I know I started out deep and y'all
[53:52] thinking, "Boy, he's gonna take all
[53:54] night." But I I purposely did tonight
[53:56] because I I knew that you'd be tired and
[53:58] I purposely kept it short. So, you know,
[54:00] unless you just pull it out of me, we're
[54:02] we're not going to be long tonight.
[54:04] But, but he said, "I caused to change
[54:06] its place." That's what translation
[54:07] means. Move from one place to another.
[54:11] Moved by something. What are we moved
[54:14] by? What are we rescued by?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; What are we translated by? By quickening
[54:18] power.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Quickening power. Ephesians 2:4. And
[54:22] this where we're kind of jumping ahead
[54:24] and so we won't have to spend as much
[54:25] time when we get there later on. He
[54:27] said, "But God, who is rich in mercy,
[54:29] for his great love, wherewith he loved
[54:31] us, even when we were dead in sins, hath
[54:34] quickened us together with Christ. By
[54:37] grace ye are saved, and hath raised us
[54:41] up together, and made us sit together in
[54:45] heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[54:50] Now,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to change our thinking
[54:52] because many times we're brother Brandon
[54:54] talked about Johnny Crow and he talked
[54:56] about how that uh Johnny Crow was a a
[54:59] bound crow. He he was bound to a certain
[55:02] circuit and he had to do the same thing
[55:04] over and over again and and and he just
[55:07] kept flying, but he had a he had a
[55:08] string attached to his leg and he was
[55:10] didn't have the power to break it and so
[55:12] he just kept flying in circles. You ever
[55:14] felt like that? just flying in circles
[55:16] over and over and over again. Johnny
[55:18] Crow flew over that same route over and
[55:20] over and over again. Brother Ram said,
[55:22] "One day a good man come by and he
[55:23] released him from that from that
[55:25] string."
[55:27] &gt;&gt; He let him loose.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But guess what Johnny Crow did.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; He just kept flying that same circuit
[55:33] cuz he was Oh, church.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; He was so used to it. It's just like
[55:37] cows you put in the pasture. If you get
[55:39] them used to there being electric fish,
[55:40] you don't even have to turn it on.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Why? because they're used to that.
[55:45] They're used and for a while they'll
[55:46] stay right in that same area because
[55:48] they perceive that they have to be
[55:50] there. But if they could just get a
[55:52] revelation, he said that here come the
[55:54] crows flying over. Johnny Crow goes
[55:56] south. He couldn't do it when he was
[55:57] tied up, but the good man released him
[55:59] to do it, but he still didn't do it
[56:01] because in his mind, he was still bound.
[56:03] That's where many people are. Your
[56:04] heavenly in your soul, but in your mind,
[56:07] you're still bound. And so, you don't
[56:09] recognize who you are or where you are.
[56:11] And it's why it's hard to worship. And
[56:13] it's hard to get above the things of the
[56:14] world. And it's hard to move on in your
[56:16] life because you you just haven't
[56:18] recognized it yet. I think we ought to
[56:20] get into such a place. Come on, church.
[56:22] We ought to get to such a place where we
[56:24] realize it don't matter what's going on
[56:26] in my life. I've been translated into
[56:28] the kingdom of his dear son. I've been
[56:30] born again. I've been changed. Things
[56:32] are different. I can worship God with
[56:34] all of my heart.
[56:43] We're translated
[56:45] into this place. Now notice where we're
[56:47] translated to. Out of earthly places.
[56:51] Now where was Jesus when he was raised?
[56:54] In the belly of the earth,
[56:56] &gt;&gt; right? The son of man be in the belly of
[56:58] the earth for three days and three
[57:00] nights. He was taken out of earthly
[57:02] places and taken up before them into
[57:04] heavenly places.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Right? And so Paul says you are raised
[57:08] with him
[57:10] &gt;&gt; in his body
[57:12] &gt;&gt; because the bride is a part of him.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So brother Brandon says you
[57:17] died with him. That's such an important
[57:18] thing. Brother Brandon preaches
[57:20] identification. He says that I I'm
[57:22] identified with this nation. If I'm a
[57:23] part of this nation, I'm identified with
[57:25] Gettysburg. I'm identified with Valley
[57:27] Forge. What's he telling us? I'm
[57:29] identified with it. He said I'm
[57:31] identified with Christ in his
[57:32] resurrection. I'm identified with him in
[57:34] in the death, burial, and resurrection.
[57:36] I died with him on Calvary. I was raised
[57:38] with him on the third day. I know people
[57:39] make fun of that and say, "Well, Brother
[57:40] Brandon didn't know what he was talking
[57:41] about." No, he knew what he was talking
[57:43] about. He was saying the same thing that
[57:45] Paul was saying. You've been translated
[57:47] from an earthly thing to a heavenly
[57:49] thing. From an earthly realm to a
[57:51] heavenly realm.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And so, we've been raised by the same
[57:56] quickening power
[57:58] &gt;&gt; that he was raised by.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Into the same place.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; That's where he wants us to be, right?
[58:08] That's what we're supposed to manifest
[58:10] is is the same things. To do the same
[58:12] things that he did,
[58:14] &gt;&gt; right? We weren't called here just to be
[58:16] church members.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; We weren't called in this age just to be
[58:20] another group of people. We were called
[58:21] to do the same things that he did. Wow.
[58:24] We've been quickened into the same place
[58:26] he was quickened to.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Let me use an example. Brother Brandham
[58:32] talked about God's attribute earth
[58:36] and and in the future home and I just
[58:39] kind of give a brief synopsis here. You
[58:41] know the earth will not be done away
[58:43] with after the millennium. How how many
[58:45] understand that
[58:46] &gt;&gt; right? But it'll be changed.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; It its atmospheres will be changed.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It it'll even melt. The Bible says with
[58:55] a fervent heat,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; right? It'll be changed. Everything
[59:00] about it will be changed. But heaven
[59:02] will be on earth. The new heavens and
[59:05] the new earth
[59:07] is the old heaven and the old earth
[59:09] regenerated.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; So much so that there's not one speck or
[59:14] one atom that remains the same.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Do you realize what the Holy Ghost means
[59:22] to us?
[59:23] &gt;&gt; It's a regeneration
[59:25] &gt;&gt; of the soul.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; So in 2 Peter chapter 3 and:e 10 says,
[59:32] "But the day of the Lord will come as a
[59:33] thief in the night in which the heavens
[59:34] will pass away with a great noise
[59:37] and the elements that the the heavens
[59:39] will have an altar call, an altar
[59:41] service,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; a great noise, and the elements will
[59:45] melt with fervent heat. The earth also
[59:47] and the works of their end shall be
[59:48] burned up." Nevertheless, we according
[59:50] to his promise look for new heavens and
[59:52] a new earth wherein dwelleth
[59:53] righteousness. Revelation 21:1 I saw a
[59:55] new heaven and a new earth for the first
[59:57] heaven and the first earth were passed
[59:59] away and there was no more sea. That
[1:00:01] word pass away. I like that Dake's
[1:00:04] topical Bible if you have one. You look
[1:00:06] in Dake's Bible and he says this. He
[1:00:08] said pass away. Pass from one condition
[1:00:11] to another. That word never means
[1:00:13] annihilation.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Isn't that what brother Brandham
[1:00:16] taught us in future home? He said it
[1:00:18] wasn't annihilated. It it's passed away.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Right? And Ecclesiastes 1:4 tells us
[1:00:24] that the earth abides forever.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Right? So we know the earth is an
[1:00:28] attribute of God. The earth is
[1:00:30] regenerated. Titus 3:5 tells us, "Not by
[1:00:33] works of righteousness, which we have
[1:00:34] done, but according to his mercy, he
[1:00:36] saved us by the washing of regeneration
[1:00:39] and renewing of the Holy Ghost." Brother
[1:00:41] Brown uses that as an example of what
[1:00:43] happens to the earth. The earth is
[1:00:45] actually loosed from its bondage
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; of sin by being changed into a new
[1:00:52] heaven and a new earth.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So he talks about the earth being
[1:00:56] loosed. He talked about Lazarus. When
[1:00:59] Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus, he
[1:01:00] said, "Loose him and let him go." And
[1:01:02] that word is the same as pass away.
[1:01:05] Change him from one place to another.
[1:01:08] Set him free.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. See, brother Ram says, "You
[1:01:14] were made for an eternal purpose."
[1:01:15] Brother also talked about the cult.
[1:01:17] Remember, it was tied up
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; and they told him, they said, "Tell him
[1:01:21] to loose the cult and let him go. My
[1:01:23] master has need of him."
[1:01:25] Because in the mind of God, that cult
[1:01:28] had a purpose. And in the mind of God,
[1:01:30] this earth has a purpose.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you believe, church? In the
[1:01:34] mind of God, you had a purpose. You may
[1:01:36] not feel the purpose. You may not be
[1:01:37] able to see it right away, but it's
[1:01:39] there. There's a purpose for you.
[1:01:41] Listen, if you're watching tonight,
[1:01:42] maybe you got down and depressed and
[1:01:44] you've gotten discouraged and worried
[1:01:45] and you think, "Well, there's no need
[1:01:46] even going to the house of God anymore."
[1:01:48] Remember, you have a purpose.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. You're an attribute
[1:01:53] of God. And he come, the new birth comes
[1:01:55] to loose you for that purpose.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; See, you were made for an eternal
[1:02:01] purpose because you were the
[1:02:02] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:02:03] in God that thought of you and expressed
[1:02:05] you and he made an earth to take you out
[1:02:07] of and to make you a human being. Sin
[1:02:10] come along and perverted his way. He
[1:02:11] said you come anyhow, but you was lost
[1:02:13] with the world. So he come and redeems
[1:02:15] you. The expressed attribute also
[1:02:17] redeems this earth by the same way. He
[1:02:19] said then his purpose rolls on.
[1:02:22] Ephesians 1:10 says that in the
[1:02:24] dispensation of the fullness of times.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; So it tells us when it's going to
[1:02:28] happen. He said in the fullness of times
[1:02:31] he might gather together in one all
[1:02:33] things in Christ both which are in
[1:02:35] heaven which were on earth even in him.
[1:02:38] Listen, brother Brown said taught us
[1:02:39] that the earth had a fullness of times.
[1:02:41] You had a fullness of times.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; In that sermon he teaches us that that
[1:02:47] the the the prophet the people said
[1:02:50] don't let God speak. Let a let the
[1:02:51] prophet speak. Let Moses speak. So a
[1:02:54] prophet's words became God's words.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Because the people said, "Don't let God
[1:02:59] speak. Let Moses speak." So God veiled
[1:03:02] himself behind Moses.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; And spoke things.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "There will be a prophet like
[1:03:09] unto me. Isaiah the same way. Isaiah
[1:03:12] stood there said, "A virgin shall
[1:03:13] conceive." Brother said, "That word
[1:03:15] circled the earth
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; until the fullness of times." that that
[1:03:20] word was meant to sink into the heart
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; of Mary at the right time.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm enjoying myself tonight. I
[1:03:30] don't know about the rest of you, but
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; I know for some of us it's just old hat.
[1:03:36] You say, "Brother Ben, I knew all of
[1:03:38] that." But have you thought about it
[1:03:39] lately?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I think it would change the way we look
[1:03:45] at things
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; and the way we look at people. You say,
[1:03:48] "Well, that person hasn't moved in 20
[1:03:50] years." But we don't give up on people.
[1:03:52] Why? Because that word will circle the
[1:03:53] earth until the fullness of time comes
[1:03:55] in. And when the fullness of time comes,
[1:03:57] that that word was meant to strike the
[1:03:59] heart. That person will change.
[1:04:01] Sometimes you see them sit in church for
[1:04:02] years. Sometimes they'll sit at home for
[1:04:04] years. One day they show up at the house
[1:04:06] of God and things begin to change for
[1:04:08] them. Why is that? Because in the
[1:04:10] fullness of times,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; God came down and loosed them from their
[1:04:14] bondage.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Glory. Aren't you glad you had a moment
[1:04:18] and a time when God released you,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; changed you?
[1:04:26] The Brandon said that's the same thing
[1:04:27] he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:04:28] baptism with fire. He can come and dwell
[1:04:30] with you and we can sit in heavenly
[1:04:32] places in Christ Jesus because we are
[1:04:36] already in him.
[1:04:38] Hallelujah. Not we will be. We are now
[1:04:42] sitting in Christ Jesus. How do we get
[1:04:46] into it? By one Holy Spirit baptism.
[1:04:50] By one spirit. We're all baptized into
[1:04:52] Christ, which we are now. He said, won't
[1:04:55] be won't be in Christ. We are.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; He is the great spiritual king.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Over the spirit that's in us.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he said our spirits can be
[1:05:08] lifted up into heavenly places. Because
[1:05:11] though our spirit realm,
[1:05:14] our spirit realm is not converted. Our
[1:05:15] flesh realm is not converted. But the
[1:05:17] king controls it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Right? As long as you let him control
[1:05:22] it.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; As long as you surrender to him, the
[1:05:25] king controls it. The king is in
[1:05:27] residence. And the fruits of the spirit
[1:05:29] can be displayed. Love, joy, peace,
[1:05:31] longsuffering, gentleness, kindness. All
[1:05:33] those things can be displayed in your
[1:05:34] life because the king is in residence.
[1:05:36] Oh, I think if I didn't have the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost tonight, I'd be look I'd be
[1:05:39] seeking with everything I had in me, I'd
[1:05:40] be looking for it. I'm always amazed by
[1:05:42] sometimes you'll take ask for a show
[1:05:44] hand. How many don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:45] and people will be honest and they'll
[1:05:47] tell you and I I say you ought to be
[1:05:49] honest if you know you don't have it or
[1:05:51] if the devil's fighting you on that. You
[1:05:52] need to find assurance of that because
[1:05:54] the devil use that against you. So, you
[1:05:57] need to find an assurance. Sometimes
[1:05:58] he'll try to make you think you don't
[1:05:59] have it when you do have it. But if you
[1:06:02] don't have it, you ought to be looking
[1:06:04] for it
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; because it's a promise to us. It's not
[1:06:07] something that well, it's not something
[1:06:08] God holds on a like a carrot on a stick
[1:06:10] and said, "When you behave, I'll give
[1:06:11] you the Holy Ghost." No, he said he'd
[1:06:13] give it to those that asked for it.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he wanted to give it to
[1:06:16] you more than you wanted it. I'd say
[1:06:18] it's about time to let our let our
[1:06:20] atmospheres be changed. Let let our in
[1:06:23] let our inner being be changed.
[1:06:24] Everything about us be changed. Be
[1:06:26] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:06:32] It's a great spiritual king over the
[1:06:33] spirit that's in us. But the RA explains
[1:06:35] that and who is this Melzdc. You don't
[1:06:38] have to quit smoking, quit drinking,
[1:06:39] quit doing those things. Let him become
[1:06:41] king.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; All those things will go away.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself unable, well, I
[1:06:48] just can't do it. I can't do it. It's
[1:06:49] because you're trying to do it and
[1:06:51] you're not letting him be king.
[1:06:55] Look,
[1:06:58] every one of his attributes, including
[1:07:00] the earth, will receive the baptism of
[1:07:03] fire.
[1:07:07] Right? You might as well might as well
[1:07:10] be now. Why struggle at it? Worry about
[1:07:13] it.
[1:07:16] Brother said, "What will it do?" It this
[1:07:18] earth couldn't be a place for heaven to
[1:07:19] sit now. See, you you weren't a
[1:07:22] candidate for heavenly places before
[1:07:26] because of sin.
[1:07:30] How much sin does that take, brother
[1:07:31] Ben? Any sin.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The nature of sin,
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; even if you never acted on it, was
[1:07:37] enough to keep you out of the presence
[1:07:39] of God.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; But what also that means is that if
[1:07:43] you're sitting in heavenly places, if
[1:07:44] you've been born again and redeemed,
[1:07:46] brother Gabe, there's nothing there.
[1:07:52] Are are you hearing me? There's nothing
[1:07:53] there. No wonder a prophet could stand
[1:07:55] up and say and say you're the sinless,
[1:07:58] spotless bride of Jesus Christ. You
[1:08:00] never did it in the first place. If you
[1:08:02] have been transported, te teleported, we
[1:08:05] might say translated from one from
[1:08:08] earthly to heavenly. If you've been
[1:08:10] changed, it means there's nothing there.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] Brother Brandham says the sin will have
[1:08:26] to be cleansed. The earth couldn't be a
[1:08:28] place for heaven to sit. Now the sin
[1:08:30] will have to be cleansed. No man, no
[1:08:31] person, no woman, boy, girl, I don't
[1:08:33] care who he is, is fit to go in the
[1:08:34] pulpit or even claim to be a Christian
[1:08:37] without being filled by the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:40] Filled with the Holy Ghost. See, you
[1:08:41] have no right to the Lord's supper or
[1:08:42] any communion, feet washing, or anything
[1:08:44] until you've been cleansed by the Holy
[1:08:46] Fire of God.
[1:08:49] He said, "No man has a right to preach
[1:08:51] unless it's you like Moses meets him out
[1:08:53] there on that sacred grounds."
[1:08:55] Hallelujah. That pillar of fire hanging
[1:08:58] there where he knows where he's at.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Notice how we go after the
[1:09:02] world's fire baptism, all germs is
[1:09:04] gone." Well, praise God.
[1:09:08] Listen, we don't have to make some kind
[1:09:10] of strange incantation over COVID 19 or
[1:09:12] however many more COs there have been.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It'll it'll just
[1:09:16] get burned up with the earth.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. With the
[1:09:23] atmospheres, the germs makes it a fit
[1:09:25] place then for heaven to dwell here on
[1:09:27] earth.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He said a type now of sitting in
[1:09:30] heavenly places in Christ Jesus passed
[1:09:33] from this dirty like the little woman
[1:09:35] was. He was talking about the woman at
[1:09:37] the well,
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; right? She was dirty. She was black in
[1:09:40] her in her in her heart, in her soul.
[1:09:43] But he said there was representation
[1:09:44] there.
[1:09:46] Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] But but these priests though they lived
[1:09:49] godly lives
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; had no representation
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; cuz they couldn't see the manifested
[1:09:55] word of the day. But the little woman
[1:09:57] when she when it was revealed to her,
[1:09:59] she saw it. She grabbed a hold of it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, he he said he said
[1:10:05] that like this little woman was into the
[1:10:07] expressed attribute of God. Now we're
[1:10:09] the sons of God, not we will be. We're
[1:10:11] the attributes of God's thinking. Right?
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; What is it? You're sitting in heavenly
[1:10:16] places. Now, how did we get here? We've
[1:10:18] been translated change. Move from one
[1:10:20] state to another, from one desire to
[1:10:22] another, from one condition to another
[1:10:24] by quickening power. In Colossians 2:13,
[1:10:26] you being dead in your sins and the
[1:10:27] uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
[1:10:29] quickened together with him, having
[1:10:31] forgiven you all. Someone say all,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; all trespasses.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Again, he said, now notice when this
[1:10:38] great moving power of God comes into a
[1:10:39] son of God, it quickens him. The spirit
[1:10:41] of life enters into him. And what does
[1:10:43] it do? It seats them in heavenly places
[1:10:45] right now. Not they will be. We are now.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Now we've already resurrected. The
[1:10:51] dynamics and the mechanics has gone to
[1:10:53] work. I know people tell you that you
[1:10:55] got to go to their church to get the
[1:10:56] dynamics. You ought to throw that right
[1:10:58] back in their face. Listen, you don't
[1:11:00] have to go to a certain church to have
[1:11:01] the dynamics. You don't have to hear a
[1:11:03] certain preacher or or be in a certain
[1:11:05] service to have the dynamics. If you're
[1:11:07] born again, the dynamics and the
[1:11:09] mechanics has gone to work in your
[1:11:11] heart. quickened us and we're quickened
[1:11:13] up into the presence of God where his
[1:11:15] spirit is.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And now we are seated together. And
[1:11:19] aren't you glad to be seated together in
[1:11:21] heavenly places in Christ Jesus? Listen,
[1:11:23] I wouldn't want to give up church for
[1:11:25] nothing because it's my chance to come
[1:11:27] together in heaven. I'm in heavenly in
[1:11:29] my soul, but when we get together, we're
[1:11:31] in heavenlies together,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Seated together in heavenly places.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] He said, "In Christ sitting there, that
[1:11:41] great seat's already already fired up."
[1:11:45] Boy, I can stop and preach for a while
[1:11:47] and I don't have time.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Preacher don't have to fire you up.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; The light show doesn't I know that's
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; that's creeping into the message. I see
[1:11:59] that overseas if you some of you
[1:12:01] brothers. I've been to Africa a couple
[1:12:02] times and I've noticed boy they have
[1:12:05] such a simple wonderful faith. But I've
[1:12:07] noticed in some of the bigger countries
[1:12:09] that they brought in light shows and LED
[1:12:11] walls and and and and and loud music and
[1:12:15] things. I don't I'm not nothing against
[1:12:17] loud music, but it just seems like it's
[1:12:18] become a stage show.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; God help us today.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to fire up, a child
[1:12:24] of God.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You're already fired up. If you're not,
[1:12:30] then the place is at the altar.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Uh it won't I won't be able to fire you
[1:12:34] up. It'll take a quickening of the Holy
[1:12:35] Ghost. It'll take a refilling of the
[1:12:37] Holy Ghost to fire you up. Not a dynamic
[1:12:40] preacher or a dynamic service, but a
[1:12:42] quickening power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for just preaching tonight.
[1:12:46] But it's just
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; something is on my heart.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Already fired up. Been raised from the
[1:12:52] dead. He said we're part of it. If
[1:12:53] you're a part of the bride, you are
[1:12:54] because the bride is part of the groom,
[1:12:56] you know. So, we find out that it's the
[1:12:58] same thing. And she'll do just exactly
[1:13:00] what's predicted for her to do in this
[1:13:02] day. She won't be a Leodysian. not by no
[1:13:05] means a lukewarm, but she'll be on fire
[1:13:08] for God. She'll be moving on in the
[1:13:10] spirit of God. I believe that tonight.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; This quickening power has translated us
[1:13:16] into the land where all the promises
[1:13:18] laid, where we have all spiritual
[1:13:20] blessings in Christ. I know sometimes we
[1:13:22] get, you know, and I I don't want to
[1:13:24] take away I don't want to lose my
[1:13:25] feeling for you. I I know many times
[1:13:28] people will come and and and they have
[1:13:30] real needs and things on their heart and
[1:13:31] I don't want to lose the ability to to
[1:13:33] empathize with that. But sometimes we
[1:13:35] can be sympathized right out of the
[1:13:37] kingdom of God and we just people that
[1:13:40] feel sorry for us so much. And I tell
[1:13:42] you, you don't really need somebody to
[1:13:44] feel sorry for you. What you need is
[1:13:45] another dip of the Holy Ghost and and
[1:13:48] another revelation of God's word and and
[1:13:50] to get deeper into him. You need to be
[1:13:52] in Christ because you say, "Well,
[1:13:54] brother Ben, you always make me feel
[1:13:55] good when you're around, but there will
[1:13:57] come a moment I'm not around." The devil
[1:13:58] makes sure he attacks you in a moment
[1:14:00] you can't get a hold of me or you can't
[1:14:02] get a hold of Brother Joel. He'll make
[1:14:03] sure that he attacks you in that moment
[1:14:05] and try to make you think people don't
[1:14:07] love you and don't care about you, but
[1:14:09] you still got heavenly in your soul. You
[1:14:11] can still reach out by the power of the
[1:14:13] Holy Ghost and overcome that thing.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to reach out. I want I want
[1:14:19] to care for you. But remember, he cares.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham
[1:14:28] taught us that heavenly places are full
[1:14:30] of Pentecostal blessings. I got three
[1:14:32] minutes.
[1:14:36] He said what Jesus ordained in Mark 16,
[1:14:38] Paul ordained the same thing 30 years
[1:14:40] later.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Said if an angel from heaven comes and
[1:14:43] preaches any other thing, let him be
[1:14:45] accursed.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Brother said, I believe that Pentecost
[1:14:48] began without an ending. I believe it's
[1:14:49] to be to every creature, all times, at
[1:14:52] all places.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; So, excuse me for being a little
[1:14:55] Pentecostal on a Wednesday night.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ben, I'm just not feeling
[1:14:58] it tonight. Well, that's just the the
[1:15:00] part that hasn't been changed yet. But
[1:15:02] let him be the king over that tonight.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Let him sit in residence over that.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let him rule over that body
[1:15:09] and that spirit.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; He said the Pentecostal blessing should
[1:15:12] always remain. The Pentecostal blessing
[1:15:14] should be upon the people. He said,
[1:15:16] "Now, what is this Pentecostal
[1:15:18] blessing?" It's the confirmation of the
[1:15:20] resurrection. What was it that they went
[1:15:22] across and got when they went into the
[1:15:24] land? They come back with grapes. What
[1:15:25] was the grapes? A confirmation that
[1:15:28] there was a land.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is the Pentecostal
[1:15:31] blessing? It's a confirmation that the
[1:15:33] land is there. We've entered the land.
[1:15:35] In the land is all good things in the
[1:15:37] land. Hallelujah. Every every promise of
[1:15:40] God is in the land. He said no wonder.
[1:15:42] He said the gospel itself means good
[1:15:44] news. Good news of what? He has raised
[1:15:46] from the dead. And because I live, you
[1:15:47] live also. Ye which were once dead in
[1:15:50] sin and trespasses, God has quickened us
[1:15:52] together by that spirit that raised up
[1:15:54] Jesus from the dead. And we are now,
[1:15:56] someone say, now sitting in heavenly
[1:15:58] places with him, communing with him,
[1:16:00] talking with him. What a joy to tell
[1:16:02] people that story that believes it to be
[1:16:04] the truth. I'm going to stop right
[1:16:06] there. Sister Joanna, musicians, go
[1:16:07] ahead and come. What a joy it is to
[1:16:09] preach to people that believe that
[1:16:11] they're sitting in heavenly places in
[1:16:13] Christ. that every Pentecostal blessing
[1:16:15] is available to them. You may not feel
[1:16:17] Pentecostal tonight. You may not I'm not
[1:16:19] talking about uh 1906 Pentecost. I'm
[1:16:22] talking about the Pentecostal blessings
[1:16:23] that fell on the day of Pentecost. You
[1:16:25] may not feel like it tonight, but
[1:16:27] there's a Pentecostal blessing for you.
[1:16:29] There's a spiritual blessing uh in
[1:16:31] heavenly places for you. Why? You've
[1:16:33] been translated from what you were to
[1:16:35] what you are now.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, you become the target of the devil.
[1:16:39] The devil's got his target trained on
[1:16:41] you. And we'll talk about that more
[1:16:42] maybe in the future. Uh maybe next week
[1:16:44] if the Lord carries, we'll talk about
[1:16:46] that. But when we're seated in heavenly
[1:16:48] places, it's in those heavenly places.
[1:16:50] That's where we fight our battles. The
[1:16:53] devil's got his every gun trained on us.
[1:16:55] He's got every weapon trained on the
[1:16:57] believer who's seated in heavenly
[1:16:59] places. But this is our position, and
[1:17:01] we'll fight for it. We will be like
[1:17:03] Caleb who he was a type of the bride. He
[1:17:06] said, "Give me my mountain. Let me take
[1:17:08] over depression. Let me take over
[1:17:11] superstition. Let me take over cancer.
[1:17:13] Let me take over what belongs to me.
[1:17:16] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:19] Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:27] The word spoken by prophets
[1:17:31] is only waiting
[1:17:33] for the fullness of times.
[1:17:37] Have great hope in that.
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:41] Because if I'm not at peace now because
[1:17:44] I'm in heavenly places, my peace is
[1:17:46] coming.
[1:17:50] You may not have your healing tonight or
[1:17:52] at least the the symptoms may not have
[1:17:54] went away, but because you're seated in
[1:17:56] heavenly places in Christ because he
[1:17:59] rose, brother Paul, that's the story of
[1:18:01] the gospel. The good news of the gospel
[1:18:03] is because he rose. I rose with him. And
[1:18:06] we've been quickened together into
[1:18:08] heavenly places. And because I know I'm
[1:18:10] in heavenly places, I know that my
[1:18:13] healing's coming. I know that the
[1:18:15] salvation of our children's coming.
[1:18:17] Hallelujah. I know they'll be filled
[1:18:19] with the Holy Ghost cuz every attribute
[1:18:20] of God will be baptized by fire. I know
[1:18:24] that I'm going to make it. Brother Ben,
[1:18:25] you're always trying to encourage
[1:18:26] people. That's because the devil's
[1:18:28] always trying to discourage people.
[1:18:32] Listen to me, church. Some of y'all
[1:18:33] know, yeah, I know there's people people
[1:18:35] here in the church maybe don't do
[1:18:37] everything they should do. I I know
[1:18:38] there's people get involved in things
[1:18:40] they shouldn't, and it's my job to
[1:18:41] preach about those things. But let me
[1:18:43] say this, the devil's going to come and
[1:18:45] he's going to condemn you.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know there's a word
[1:18:49] that can wash you of that thing. You
[1:18:51] don't have to bow down to that. You
[1:18:53] don't have to give in to it. You don't
[1:18:54] have to give in to desire to fit in with
[1:18:56] the world. You don't have to give in to
[1:18:58] to to lust. You don't have to give in to
[1:19:00] filth of the world. Why? You can be
[1:19:02] changed. Hallelujah.
[1:19:04] Wash. You said, "What happens if I get
[1:19:06] dirty? If I get dirty, I know I'm a
[1:19:08] Christian. I know I've been filled with
[1:19:09] the Holy Ghost. What happens if I make a
[1:19:11] mistake?" Listen, you can be washed by
[1:19:13] the water of the word. Even tonight,
[1:19:15] Brother Brand said, "But how are you
[1:19:16] going to be washed if you won't stay
[1:19:17] under the fountain?" Lord, help me to
[1:19:19] stay under the word and listen to what
[1:19:21] he has to say.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe your peace has come.
[1:19:25] your joy cuz it's been spoken by a
[1:19:27] prophet in our day by the prophets that
[1:19:30] wrote the Bible. It's been spoken. So
[1:19:33] shall it be.
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:38] Brother Brandham gets to the end of the
[1:19:40] rapture sermon.
[1:19:42] Hallelujah.
[1:19:44] He preaches about a rapture.
[1:19:48] I just love this.
[1:19:51] He comes like this. He said, "It's been
[1:19:52] spoken,
[1:19:54] so it shall be.
[1:19:59] He was sure what he was talking about.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I believe it, church.
[1:20:05] I'm just simple to believe it. The word
[1:20:06] comes to the prophets.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; It's been spoken. So shall it be. Think
[1:20:11] about it. And and it's not just that.
[1:20:14] We're not just relying on the word of a
[1:20:16] man, but the reason it works is because
[1:20:18] you were in the mind of God, a thought
[1:20:20] of God before the foundation of the
[1:20:22] world. God knew you. That's why he spoke
[1:20:25] over you. Aren't you glad for that
[1:20:27] today?
[1:20:29] Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] H. Would you bow your heads with me?
[1:20:37] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:20:40] Maybe
[1:20:42] maybe you just talk to him for a minute.
[1:20:45] Lord, translate me.
[1:20:51] Oh, God.
[1:20:54] Translate me, Lord.
[1:20:57] Maybe you're doing things you know is
[1:20:59] wrong. Maybe some that are watching,
[1:21:00] some that are here. I don't know. How do
[1:21:03] I get rid of that? How do I let go of
[1:21:04] that?
[1:21:06] Get in Christ.
[1:21:08] Let him be king.
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:11] Are you tired of fussing and fighting
[1:21:13] and carrying on and no peace in the
[1:21:16] home? Let him be king in your home.
[1:21:19] You're tired of worry and depression
[1:21:21] taking you over and until it immobilizes
[1:21:23] you. Let him be king over that. Let him
[1:21:26] be king in your mind.
[1:21:29] Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] You just talk to him right now. Wherever
[1:21:36] you're sitting, if you you want to come
[1:21:38] pray, you're welcome to come.
[1:21:40] God knows your hearts. He knows my
[1:21:42] heart. Lord, Lord, I want to sit in
[1:21:45] heavenly places.
[1:21:47] How long's it been since you've been in
[1:21:48] a service that you really enjoyed being
[1:21:51] in that you knew everything was clear
[1:21:53] between you and God? Not because you're
[1:21:54] a good person, but because he took it
[1:21:56] away.
[1:21:58] It only takes a moment.
[1:22:01] Just a simple prayer. Lord, forgive me.
[1:22:04] And you really mean it. If you really
[1:22:06] mean it, he'll forgive you.
[1:22:10] Hallelujah.
[1:22:11] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're Lord,
[1:22:15] I see
[1:22:18] Lord, I I can see it on people's faces
[1:22:20] tonight. And I know my own heart is
[1:22:21] stirred. And Lord, we've not been
[1:22:23] stirred by the preaching of a man. We've
[1:22:25] been stirred by your word tonight, Lord.
[1:22:27] That we are sitting in heavenly places
[1:22:29] in Christ. Lord, would you take away all
[1:22:32] the dross, all the all the elements of
[1:22:34] sin, all the atmospheres of sin, oh God.
[1:22:37] Lord, I know I've received the baptism
[1:22:39] of the Holy Ghost. I know I've been
[1:22:41] changed, but Lord, change me again
[1:22:42] tonight. Refill me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:45] Oh God, if there's anything left that's
[1:22:47] unlike you, take it out of me, Lord. Let
[1:22:49] me be right. Oh God, let me be holy. Let
[1:22:51] me live according to your word. I pray
[1:22:53] you grant it, Lord Jesus. I pray for
[1:22:56] each one here tonight. Lord, that you
[1:22:58] just move in their homes, move in their
[1:22:59] lives, Lord. if they're tired of just up
[1:23:02] and down and in and out. Lord, may
[1:23:04] tonight be the night they get in their
[1:23:05] prayer closet and and and not give up,
[1:23:07] Lord, until you baptize them with fire.
[1:23:10] I pray you grant it, Lord. Oh, we thank
[1:23:12] you for these heavenly places. We thank
[1:23:14] you, Lord, for the an assurance that our
[1:23:16] peace is coming. Our our joy is coming
[1:23:19] and it's already in the land, but
[1:23:21] already belongs to us, but it's just
[1:23:23] waiting until the word, the moment, the
[1:23:25] fullness of time for us to enter into
[1:23:27] it. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I thank
[1:23:29] you for all that you've done. Thank you
[1:23:31] for these people who have waited
[1:23:32] patiently tonight and listened. I pray
[1:23:34] you'd bless them abundantly. Bless our
[1:23:36] mothers and fathers and students and
[1:23:38] teachers, Lord. Everyone, I pray you'd
[1:23:40] bless them. The leadership of the
[1:23:42] church. I thank you for them, Lord. I
[1:23:43] thank you for our deacons and our
[1:23:46] associate pastor and all everyone, Lord,
[1:23:48] that takes up the slack. Lord, when when
[1:23:50] things are maybe when I'm not here or
[1:23:52] something, Lord, I thank you for them.
[1:23:54] Lord, I pray you bless these young
[1:23:56] people that are coming to the banquet.
[1:23:57] Lord, may you protect them, Lord, as we
[1:23:59] were reminded again over the weekend how
[1:24:01] quickly things can change. I pray you'd
[1:24:03] protect our young people on the roads to
[1:24:04] the banquet. Lord, some coming from
[1:24:06] quite a ways, I pray that you'd bless
[1:24:08] them, Lord. I pray you'd fill them with
[1:24:10] the Holy Ghost, Lord, each one of us as
[1:24:12] well. We s we're so thankful for your

[1:26:47] The battle battle is over. Oh, I'm glad
[1:26:51] the victory is won.
[1:26:55] It's already done.
[1:26:59] I want us to pray especially as they
[1:27:02] continue to play and I'll turn it over
[1:27:03] to brother Joel. But I I want us to pray
[1:27:06] especially for our young people. I was
[1:27:08] in the meetings this weekend and there's
[1:27:11] probably 4 or 500 young people there and
[1:27:14] kids and
[1:27:16] of all ages. I preached to the older
[1:27:18] group, probably somewhere maybe 80 or 90
[1:27:21] kids over 21. And uh on uh Friday,
[1:27:29] talk to them just to give them some time
[1:27:32] because sometimes the devil when you get
[1:27:33] a little bit older with Ryan, it seems
[1:27:34] like the devil just attacks you that
[1:27:36] much more. Why haven't you done this or
[1:27:38] that or that with your life? And you
[1:27:40] want to give them let them know we care
[1:27:42] about them. So we're doing this banquet
[1:27:44] for that reason, too. But I was just
[1:27:45] struck
[1:27:48] by
[1:27:50] I was struck by how much trouble there
[1:27:53] is in the minds of our young people.
[1:27:57] They're they're good pe young we have
[1:27:59] the best young people on the face of the
[1:28:00] earth. But I there's so much trouble
[1:28:04] and I know some of you elder people
[1:28:05] struggle. I know you do. Especially as
[1:28:07] you get older and the devil battles your
[1:28:09] mind as you you get old enough where you
[1:28:10] can't it's harder to take care of
[1:28:12] yourself and you really struggle with
[1:28:14] that. But our young people struggle too
[1:28:17] tremendously in a way maybe that we
[1:28:20] didn't. Even I didn't. And there's a
[1:28:23] spiritual warfare going on. Many of them
[1:28:26] are sitting in heavenly places but
[1:28:27] they're fighting spiritual battles. And
[1:28:29] so constantly devil's telling them and
[1:28:31] we prayed for maybe a thousand young
[1:28:34] people over the weekend by the time we
[1:28:35] got done because they all come through
[1:28:36] the prayer line and they all they all
[1:28:38] come up and they they just kept coming
[1:28:41] up
[1:28:42] and by the time we got done praying for
[1:28:44] everybody I I realized some of the
[1:28:46] devil's fighting every one of them just
[1:28:47] like he's fighting you tonight trying to
[1:28:49] tell them they're not worthy and they
[1:28:51] don't have it and or or maybe they never
[1:28:53] get it.
[1:28:55] And then you got real serious needs.
[1:28:57] parents, if you if you don't know what's
[1:29:00] going on with your young people, you
[1:29:01] need to know what's going on. You need
[1:29:02] to be a part of their lives.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Especially if they're in public school
[1:29:06] or if they're got friends that are
[1:29:08] worldly or even even in the church, you
[1:29:11] need to know what's going on. You need
[1:29:13] to ask them, talk to them, be a part of
[1:29:16] their lives because we there's just some
[1:29:18] awful things. I sat back there with some
[1:29:21] preachers behind the platform after the
[1:29:23] prayer line at about midnight after a
[1:29:24] 6-hour service and cried because of some
[1:29:27] of the things that we'd heard come
[1:29:28] across there. Oh God. Oh God.
[1:29:34] Some of you young people with desperate
[1:29:35] needs, we need to get them in the
[1:29:36] presence of the Lord. We should never
[1:29:38] surrender a service to the enemy.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let a critical spirit come
[1:29:42] over you and say, "Well, I I just won't
[1:29:44] go to church. I I won't I'll sit there
[1:29:46] with a critical spirit cuz somebody did
[1:29:47] me wrong or somebody said something
[1:29:48] about me. Just let it go. Our young
[1:29:51] people are worth it. Our elders are
[1:29:52] worth it. Those that are out of the ark
[1:29:54] of safety today, and there's hundreds in
[1:29:56] this area that used to be in church at
[1:29:58] some point. You remember many of them
[1:30:00] used to be in the house of God. They're
[1:30:02] not there today. I believe God's going
[1:30:03] to go get them. But we got to get the
[1:30:05] atmosphere right. We need to be sitting
[1:30:07] together in heavenly places.
[1:30:12] Let's just do that. Can we do that? If
[1:30:14] we're asked to do something at work,
[1:30:15] let's just do it. If we're not asked to,
[1:30:17] maybe be a little bit offended, that's
[1:30:19] okay because maybe we were meant to just
[1:30:21] pray in that situation, right? So, let's
[1:30:24] just let's just get behind our young
[1:30:26] people. Do everything we can do. And
[1:30:27] above all, pray for them. Pray for my
[1:30:29] kids. Pray for these older ones. Pray
[1:30:31] for these younger ones. We got a bunch
[1:30:33] more coming up. Let's be in prayer for
[1:30:35] them. Not just in the school year, but
[1:30:37] every day of their lives. Amen. I We're
[1:30:40] going in a rapture one of these days. We
[1:30:42] might as well. We don't want to leave
[1:30:43] one hoof behind. As Moses said, we won't
[1:30:46] leave our children. We won't leave our
[1:30:48] cattle. We won't leave nothing. He said,
[1:30:50] "We're going to make a sacrifice of
[1:30:53] praise to God." Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:30:56] you tonight, Brother Joel, if you can
[1:30:57] come. I love you with all my heart.
[1:30:59] Thank you for putting up with me being
[1:31:00] gone. I believe it meant something to
[1:31:02] the kids that win and and those over
[1:31:04] there. God bless you now. Oh, it's
[1:31:06] already done.
[1:31:11] Oh yes, it's all already done.
[1:31:19] Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] It's all done.
[1:31:26] Praise
[1:31:28] the Lord.
[1:31:30] The battle is over.
[1:31:34] The victory. Oh, you believe that
[1:31:36] tonight?
[1:31:38] Yes, it's already
[1:31:41] done.
[1:31:45] Well, I'm on the battlefield for my
[1:31:48] Lord. For my Lord. Oh, I'm on the
[1:31:53] battlefield for my Lord.
[1:31:57] Well, I promised him that I would serve
[1:32:01] him till I die. And I'm on the
[1:32:05] battlefield for my Lord.

[1:32:13] Lord. For my Lord. Yes, I'm on the
[1:32:16] battlefield for my Lord.
[1:32:21] Well, I promise that I would serve him.
[1:32:27] Well, I'm on the battlefield.
[1:32:30] All clap your hands and sing them one
[1:32:31] more time. Oh yes, I'm on the
[1:32:34] battlefield for my Lord. Oh my Lord.
[1:32:39] Yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord.
[1:32:44] Well, I promised him that I would serve
[1:32:49] him till I die. And I'm on the
[1:32:52] battlefield.
[1:32:54] Let me hear you sing it one time before
[1:32:55] we go. Till I'm on the battlefield. For
[1:32:59] my Lord. Oh my Lord. Yes, I'm on the
[1:33:04] battlefield.
[1:33:06] Yes, we are. Well, I promise
[1:33:11] would serve him
[1:33:14] and I'm all
[1:33:16] for my Lord.
[1:33:22] Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise.
[1:33:25] Amen. Aren't you thankful for the word
[1:33:26] of the Lord? Did you enjoy the message
[1:33:28] tonight? Amen. Give the Lord another
[1:33:29] hand clap and praise. Amen.
[1:33:34] Amen. I want to say, are you washed in
[1:33:35] the blood as we go? Amen. You're God
[1:33:38] bless you. I won't hold you any longer.
[1:33:39] Amen. Don't forget to be in prayer for
[1:33:41] our banquet for our young people and
[1:33:43] those of you that have uh that we we've
[1:33:45] texted and stuff about helping. Uh just
[1:33:47] be sure and make sure if you've been
[1:33:48] texting, haven't responded that you
[1:33:49] respond to Sister Virginia or myself and

[1:33:58] in prayer for our young people this
[1:33:59] weekend. Let's sing this as we go. Well,
[1:34:01] have you been to Jesus for the pleasing
[1:34:06] power? Are you washed in the blood of
[1:34:10] the lamb?
[1:34:12] Are you fully trusting in his grace this
[1:34:17] hour? Are you washed in the blood of the
[1:34:21] lamb?
[1:34:23] Oh, are you washed
[1:34:26] in the blood
[1:34:29] in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb?
[1:34:35] Are your garments spotless?
