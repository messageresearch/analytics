there's needs that there's things that I need God to move in my life for and I'm sure you do as well and we know that God knows every one of our needs Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're thankful that you see everything and you know all things Lord and in these troubling times that we live in we thank you that you're still God you're still on the throne and you still have the ability to meet our needs and so I pray for each hand that was raised Lord whatever that it is Lord personal financial spiritual Lord you know what it is father and I pray God that you'd reach right down that you would heal that you would bless father and that through your word tonight you can meet the needs that I don't even know about Lord but you know what they are I pray that you'd Grant it now and speak to us speak to me Lord in this midweek Service as well as to your people we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you thank you for coming tonight we're going to turn to Romans chapter 4 we'll start reading in verse 13 we'll read down to verse 18 Romans chapter 4 and verse 13 again thank you for being in the house of the Lord I I feel very special towards those who come on Wednesday night not that we're at all special and I know some are away and some it's too far to come on a Wednesday night but for those of you that are here and those of you that are listening tonight uh there's a special blessing for you because you uh in spite of your work week and the things that you've got going on you want to be in the house of God and so you've set aside a couple hours of your day of your week to come and so we know it won't be void because the word of God doesn't go forth void and we're going to read the word and and if that's all you get out of it all week long that'd be something that'd be something Eternal in in a life full of just the mundanity and the things that we go through every day we can brother Caleb come to the house of God and hear the word of God that is eternal and know we've got something that'll help us amen so I want to speak to you tonight on Hope for the Future Hope for the future and Romans chapter 4 and verse 13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for for if they which are of the law be Hees faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end or the result that the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all so he says that's what brings us into the picture is the promise of faith if it wasn't for that we'd be out just by virtue of our nationality so he said he's the father of us all and he says as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even in God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations you don't become the father of many nations by being a weakling or a coward but he said against hope he believed in Hope or in other words where there's no reason to hope he had hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so so shall thy seed be amen that's us amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated for just a few moments it's almost too obvious of a statement to make but we live in troubling times we are buffeted from within and from without and you look on the outside and you think that we had the Corona virus and we had the you have the Sodom condition of the world anyway that it's in just just think back over the last 10 or 15 years and think what it's come to today and I can remember I couldn't have imagined the world that we lived in today when I was a teenager I couldn't imagine what it would be like that all these things would be legalized that we would have be living in the kind of world that we live in today we have the modern church and the condition that it's in and I don't think any of us as Believers would want to approximate that or be like that as we see the the church literally fulfilling the vision that brother randam had when he saw the the Church of the United States going down into hell and marching to that rock and roll beat with the nudity and the things and you see the church today fulfilling that just walking right into that vision and but thank God there was another part to the vision that there was a bride also that the bride would not go down but the bride would go up and if that part of the vision is being fulfilled that the world and the the worldly church the church of the United States would go down then there has to be a a part that's fulfilled that the church or the bride is going up so there there's a Sodom condition though in the world there's a modern Church there's riots and lawlessness and and you have lawlessness in the police force but then you have lawlessness in the streets and every reaction as I said Sunday is worse than the action before it and so it just keeps digging itself a deeper hole every time nothing gets fixed it just keeps getting worse but the scriptures tell us that these things are the beginning of Sorrows in Matthew chapter 24:8 he said all these the beginning of Sorrows he speaks of war and rumors of war and all distress among nations and all those things he he said these are the beginnings of of Sorrows or this is the first part of the birth pains this is that time period when you're getting up close sister Vicki to the end and you realize that if you've been through a pregnancy as my wife and I have I said use that Loosely but but we've got three children and so we've been through pregnancy and and I remember there being some labor pains before the baby was born that's what he's speaking of this is the beginning of Sorrows this indication that is coming that it's getting close and we can see that and we've seen that in the last 2,000 years has just kept cycling closer and closer and closer we could go on about that all night but these are those birth pains but brother random speaks of it this way in The Invisible Union Union of the bride of Christ he says the complete total insanity this world will get into he said right away he said we'll go into right away way he said it's almost there now he said why you see the footsteps of it you can see where they're making the tracks he was saying you you can tell that it's around well now today you can see it it's right out on the streets and then you could see the footsteps of it he said there it is it's marching right out on the street right down the church pew total insanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being civilized that's the hour that we live in oh I'm so thankful for the message of the hour today so thankful for the word of God that makes us love I don't want to live without this message I don't want to live without this word because what does it do it keeps us sane in an insane generation it's insane and so he says he says that and he says oh God in another place in leadership he said oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with you father I don't want to stay here on this Earth to watch these tribulations coming on so in other words I I hear and I feel and I see the birth pains and I don't want to be a part of that tribulation period when it's down to the wire when those last moments of the earth when those last spasms H the Earth as we talked about the drgs of the cup of God's Wrath when that takes place I don't want to be here at that time so I'm going to avoid that he said Lord let me go where do I want to go I want to go in a Rapture so he went by way of the grave but he's coming in a resurrection the dead in Christ shall rise first and people say brother bram's coming back yes he is with all the other Saints it's not just him but all the other Saints all the saints are coming back amen but now we find this this age of insanity we want to escape that so he says I don't want to stay here on this Earth to watch these tribulations coming on I don't want to stay here in this Insanity I don't want to stand here when these hideous sights the people losing their mind and my son was telling me on the way over here on the drive over that Toyota is putting out a they're working on a car that will be like a a pet you know people have emotional support pets and they're working on a car that will be an emotional support car if this isn't true blame Peter for it because I didn't have time to look it up but but he said they're working on this emotional support car that will actually sense when you are are needy emotionally and it will talk to you and it will talk you out of it that's the hour we live in it's going into insanity and I've got all kinds of ideas what that might be I need to look that up but he says he says I don't want to stand here when people are losing their mind he said we look at men trying to act like beasts and look like beasts women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face he said knowing that these things are predicted to happen that the thing will they'll go so insane to Locust will raise up with hair like women to haunt the women teeth like lions and things that you said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone he said we see it in the making right now Lord help us and he says this he said restore us to the sane mind of Christ Jesus our lord and you see the way the world goes and Satan will get a hold of a person and you watch them they'll do something that it's just insane it makes no sense but they'll they'll reason it out and they'll have a an idea this is the way it's supposed to be and they'll grab a hold of that but it makes no sense and they may have their reasons but it makes no sense to do what they do makes no sense for black people to Rob black businesses because a a white cop killed a black man and then kill black people it makes no sense no more sense than it made for the cop to do that in the first place it made no sense it was crazy and you look at the world that we live in it doesn't make it's insane and people just don't have common courtesy anymore we just run over each other it doesn't matter and you take a prophet of God look at the attitude of a prophet of God a prophet of God wasn't ever that way he said we believe in life when he went to plead for the life for those young people that have been caught up in all that those problems he said we believe in life but we see the world in the making he said right now and that was back then but he said restore us to the same mind of Christ Jesus our lord listen that's what we need and it'll only come by the word it's got to be something that comes by the word that the word can actually restore us us back to sanity it's not that the word is is making us where we're weird or odd or different but the word is making us Sint and there's nobody that looks as weird as the samee person among insane people you walk through a world of people who are insane you don't look sane you look different you don't look normal but thank God for that what is Hope biblically hope is something different than what it is in in our common common vernacular if I could put it that way it's hope to us is means well I hope it happens so I'm not real sure it's going to right it's something that you know you hope for you hope for a lot of things but that's not biblical hope biblical hope is expectation brother brandham deals with that in in the sermon expectation he talks about how our expectations what they should be he said now if God has promised a Revival here we're going to have it he's speaking to these people as these come into town and these churches pull together and bring brother brandom in they want to have a Revival they want to see people healed they want to see people saved and brother brandom comes in there he said if God has promised a Revival here we're going to have it let's make ready for it if God promised to heal let's make ready for it he said Jesus said the works that I do show you also let's make ready for it move out everything get ready we're right in time he said now it'll seem foolish now you say well how's it going to happen in a day like this and when all this I want you to think about that in the in the context of what's going on in the world right now how's it going to happen in a day like this when all this huh all this riding all this looting all this Corona virus all this trouble all this trouble on the internal side in the church all these problems that we've had how's it going to happen in a day like this but what what did we read in our text Abraham against hope believed in hope when had no right to expect anything he expected it anyway so how's it going to happen in a day like this and when all this he said I don't care what anything contrary is to that it's wrong he said we can't see it now you're it's a prophet of God speaking he said we can't see it now listen even a prophet of God could only see he could see so far he could see that maybe by 1977 it'd be so black that he couldn't even see any further we look at that and think what what kind of Hope do we have then if if the angel of God even wrote Leo deia with all Blackness all Darkness but we have a a a hope an expectation because the scripture says Rise and Shine for thy light has come so we have an expectation of something greater we have an expectation of something better too many times we get our eyes on what we can't see well I don't see any people around me I don't see things going on and so we we react in that way but somebody's got to be a soldier somebody's got to be willing to step into the battle somebody's got to be willing to be like Abraham and say I see it against hope I Believe In Hope because not because I can see it with my natural eyes I I don't see how it's going to happen and I have forgive me for making it personal but I've had people lately come to me and say brother Ben I don't see how you're going to do what you're doing but but it's it's not you can't see it with these eyes you got to be able to see beyond that you've got that there's got to be somebody that can look at what can be according to the word not according to the people not according to the situation but according to the word what kind of church can we have what kind of people can we be huh you look at your children or your grandchildren or maybe somebody that's out of the Ark of Safety and they're away from church and you look and say well they've done this and this and this what what hope is there for them but you don't look at what you can see you look at what can be look at what the word proom promised you we can't see it I see no hope of it look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow cuz God said so it'll happen anyhow I'm expecting it can you imagine what those two girls must have thought when Mary and Martha when Jesus had roll the stone away Lazarus was still dead and by this time he stinketh he was in the grave and he'd been there long enough he was already decaying and they'd never seen that before but it was at Thy word Lord he said but see he had to have them do it it wasn't Jesus didn't walk up there and push the stone away himself he said roll the stone away he gave the command and somebody had to have the faith to stand there and carry out the commands of Christ see that's what we're doing here tonight somebody's got to have the faith to come on a Wednesday tonight and carry out the commands of Christ and say I'm going to do it anyhow it might be hard it might be difficult it might be a troubling time that we're going through but I'm going to do it anyhow why because that God said it could happen and against hope we believe in Hope hey man he said if God said so let's do it anyhow CU God said so it'll happen anyhow I'm expecting him now the Bible tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the substance of expectation and when the Bible speaks of expectation it doesn't just speak of a general expectation or a positive attitude but it's a specific expectation based on promises made see the Israelites always expected Jerusalem to be the city of God based on promise proes made they expected a messiah based on promises made they expected God to do certain things now they may have misunderstood many of those promises but they base that on the promises made it was an expectation and so you find that after thousands of years of the people believing in a messiah expecting Messiah here is Simeon standing there in a temple and he still expects God to fulfill his word and it becomes such an expectation in his life brother Harvey that he took it personally and it was revealed to him that he would not die until he saw the Messiah and to the world that looked crazy but see I believe that happens to us when we we come to this the message of the hour there's got to be an expectation there that's more than just a general expectation but a specific expectation based on promises made there will be a Rapture and then there got to come of people like Simeon to say it's going to happen to me now Hebrews 11 and8 says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went he went out not knowing with he went by faith he soured in the land of promise as in a strange country country dwelling in Tabernacles or tents with Isaac and Jacob HS with him of the same promise for he looked for a city he looked for a city which have foundations whose Builder and maker is God now he looked for that word looked for is to receive or to accept and also to expect so he accepted that the word of God was true that there was a city and then he expected it so he waited for it but he never saw it huh he never saw it but by faith God led him right to the spot where it would be so brother bham tells us the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said are you ready he said this is the city that Abraham was looking for what our future home that City that he's talking about that that New Jerusalem this is the city that Abraham was looking for see being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere the Bible said so and he forsook the city he lived and he went over he said look where he went exactly where it'll be he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God he said being a prophet and Abraham was looking for it and he professed he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God that Prophet knowing it was somewhere John saw it coming down but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then why because he had that expectation God didn't tell him when it would be he just said there would be a city so Abraham looked for a city amen he was oh my if we just recognize that he looked for a city but he couldn't settle for Sodom see lot found a city he liked I hope you're with me tonight lot found a city that he liked and he was comfortable sitting there until God destroyed it and God sent him up into the mountains and he begged him to take him to another city because he was looking for a city but he found comfort in the in the things of the world in the cities of this world but Abraham lived in the country amen lived on the mountains why because he was looking for a city that was better than Sodom oh I hope we keep sight of that today we're looking for a country for a city that's better than this one that we live in that's why we don't get caught up in all the things that are going on because if we get too caught up in that we start looking for a city here that's what communism does they want to build a Utopia here that's what many people do and all every politician that comes along well I'm going to build this we're going to do this we're going to make it the way it should be but remember it'll never be how it should be amen until the king of Peace comes there will never be peace until the king of Peace comes there will never but there is coming a city we're going to live in that Abraham looked for amen he said Abraham thought it must be on earth right then he said why why did he think it must be right then he said he met MDC the king of it and gave him a tithe which had no father nor mother no beginning of Life or no ending of Life Abraham met him and they took communion on the literal spot where the city will be raised up the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live can I tell you something tonight listen we expect a city we have a hope for the future because we met a king we met MDC and and so we expect a better City because we met the king of the city and he said I go and prepare a place for you amen and we know that we have a body there we know we have a a life there there's something that we've been in the mind of God all this time and so we know it's there we met him we met him we've taken communion if we could put it that way on the spot where that City will be and I don't mean in this case Abraham on the literal spot but for us we do that in Christ we have communion we take communion not so much in a building but in Christ in the in the body of Christ we take communion on a spot where the city will be raised up the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live oh my why do we expect things different than the world does because we medicate you could hear all about they're being a city of Atlantis you would never believe it because no one's ever met the king of Atlantis it's not a city that it may be mythical or whatever it's supposed to be a city under the water the sink under the sea and there's no there's no record of it that you could ever prove because you can't meet meet the king you've never met the king but this city you've met the king of the city and so you have confidence that it's there so you live under the administration of that kingship even though we're not there yet are you with me now so the Bible speaks of Hope in Jeremiah chapter 31:15 or this specific hope because this was the hope of Israel that there would be a land there would be a place there would be a restoration so no matter what happened in the meantime they always had this hope and Jeremiah 31:15 says thus sayith the Lord a voice was heard in Rama lamentation and bitter weeping Rachel weeping for her children refusing to be comforted for her children because they were not they were not and he said thus sayith the Lord refrain thy voice from weeping thine eyes from tears for thy Works shall be rewarded sayith the Lord they shall come again from the land of the enemy he said and there is hope in thine end there is hope in thine end that's where our real hope our specific hope is and that affects everything else that we do our hope is not here it's in the end it's in thine end sayi the Lord because every one of us are going to have an end when it comes to this life every one of us will either go by way of the Grave or we'll go to Rapture there'll be an end but there's hope in thine end what did he say that God he said I know the thoughts that I think towards you to bring about an expected end an expected end thoughts of good thoughts of peace and not of evil he said there is hope in thine end say the Lord so he says I know you're going through it right now and Jeremiah being the weeping prophet had such a hard message to deliver because he was delivering it to a people he was telling them you've got to go back you got to go with them it's God's will that you go down into Babylon he said but there's hope in thine end I know it's hard now and I know there's trouble but there's Hope In the End Amen he said there's hope in thine end sayi the Lord thy children shall come again to their own border what we got to remember about our own children There's Hope in thine end turn you to the stronghold in Zechariah 9 and12 this is scripture was just powerful to me speaking these Jewish people these people who were had been through so much he says turn you to the stronghold there's a stronghold there's a Christ that's coming there's a messiah turning you to the stronghold turn to the word ye prisoners of hope they were prisoners of Hope and the world mocked them because the world did whatever it took to get ahead in the moment that is the way of the cosmos I hope you're hearing me tonight the cosmos the way of this world where he said love not the world love not the cosmos or the things of the world because the way of the cosmos is to take advantage of right now for the moment that's the way of the world but here the Jews were always different because they were looking for a better hope they were looking for something more they weren't looking for the moment but they were saying Lord someday you'll restore us and the people that conquer them didn't understand look you're a conquered people why don't you just go away and assimilate with all the rest of us and become like us and the Jews for thousands of years May main their testimony and their dignity and their religion why did they do that because they had a hope amen turn you to the stronghold you prisoners of hope they were prisoners of Hope their lives and everything was ruled by that they couldn't just be like any other Nation they were a peculiar people you and I are the same way today we are prisoners of Hope even today said do I declare that I will render double unto thee amen what a promise now look acts 23 and6 but the time of Paul hope this hope had become a belief in the resurrection a belief in the resurrection there wasn't a maybe a specific understanding of the Resurrection in the Old Testament even though job spake of it in many other scriptures in in the Old Testament but in the New Testament it becomes crystal clear and it becomes clear frankly because of the death burial and resurrection of Christ because he was the first fruits he showed it could be done right so the resurrection existed only in theory to the Jewish people it was a theory that they had that there would be a resurrection so the Pharisees believed in a resurrection the Sadducees did not they didn't have this hope but he says when Paul perceived he was he was before the the Sanhedrin Council and he perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the counsil men and Brethren I am a Pharisee the son of a Pharisee The Hope and resurrection of the Dead I am called in question and Paul gets out of this basically because he sets them against one another maybe that's what the Lord's doing right now you know we're just kind of scooting by and everybody else is just fighting with one another but we don't join the fight but Paul says I I'm a Pharisee and he says all these Pharisees here believe in a resurrection and for that hope for that expectation I'm called in question and he was literally telling the truth because it was a resurrection of Christ the resurrection of Christ but he was telling it truth in a way they would understand because and brother brandham did that you'll find that many times in front of Pentecostal crowds he would tell the truth in a way that they would understand but yet we we recognized was still true but it was just put in in a frame that they would understand Paul does that also in Mars Hill to the Greeks in Acts 24:14 Paul again he said but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets so again he's speaking of this and he said and have hope toward God which they themselves also allow so he's speaking to the king of gri I believe he's speaking to him and he says they have hope or claim to have hope as well that there will be a resurrection of the Dead both of the just and unjust yet they were persecuting Paul because he believed that it happened and the persecution we take in the message is not because we believe a prophet would come but we believe it already happened you go any any commentary you go almost any older commentary and you'll find they believed Elijah was coming and many people today want a profit but the uniqueness of the messages that we believe one's already come we've already had a prophet and we've seen the completion and the Fulfillment of that that that the third pole would be the last poll it's there's a finality to it that that's the end the the the last poll or the last attraction to the bride would be the word of God oh my he said but they themselves also allow there should be a resurrection of the Dead both the just and unjust and now I stand and I'm judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers unto which promise our 12 tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come he said this is why we're different because we hope in a resurrection amen instantly serving God day and night hope to come for which Hope's sake King AG grippa I am accused of the Jews 1 Corinthians 15:19 let's look at this as Paul brings it down and kind of makes this hope very clear here he said if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable so I want to set this forth today as our hope for the future is not a hope for the present but it brings hope to the present so our hope is a hope of an end our hope is a hope of what will be brother Curtis and especially as you get older you realize that your hope is what will be you got more years behind you than you do ahead of you so your hope is what will be but that brings hope to the present that brings a joy to your step today that makes you want to come to church that makes us want to keep doing the things that we're doing keep planting our potatoes why because we have a hope we have a hope if we have a hope in Christ we're if if we only had it in this life we are of all men most miserable but we are not of all men most miserable in fact we're the only ones that have real Joy boy why because our hope is not just in this life our hope is in another world our hope is in another city like Abraham's was we look for that City if if we only have hope in Christ we of all men most miserable this is the typical inscription on a grave in Paul's day it says I was not I became I am not and I care not that was the typical inscription in the world at that time that was the the Greek world I I was not I became you know so I just wasn't anything somehow I got here it sounds familiar doesn't it just big bang Evolution whatever that it was I was not I became I am not I care not doesn't matter because I lived for a while just like a dog would or or a horse would or any other creature and then all the sudden I am not I care not and so the the philosophy of the age led to hopelessness that's an hour that we live in today as well the philosophy of this age with atheism and communism and all these things that we see and even just just regular churchianity if you could say it that way just just the regular you know it really doesn't matter it really doesn't matter what you do because there's no hope in it anyway I was not I became I am not I care not let's just get the the most as as the one said in the scripture eat and drink for tomorrow we die hopelessness hopelessness oh my that was typical of the day but it was not typical of the believer but the believer was willing to sacrifice this life to go to a better place amen that's hope what does Hope do I want you to get this the hope of Salvation is protection for the mind of the Christian you remember that I I told you that as I read where brother BR said we're going into insanity and we'll look at some more of that you see the world just drifting into insanity but the hope of Salvation is protection for our minds so that we are not overcome by the darkness of the age and by the hopelessness of the age first Thessalonians 5:4 says but you Brethren are not in darkness amen you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief so you understand what's going on you're all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness and I want to kind of and maybe we'll get into this sometime but without this message you can't make sense of the last 2,000 years it's hard to make sense of the church ages because you know what happened in the Protestant Revolution a lot of people drive themselves crazy or go back into Catholicism because are trying to make sense of what's happened in church history because but if you understand the message of the hour in the scriptures correctly you find out that a corn of wheat died in the ground it had to die so it could come up again an alpha and omega bride those are things we believe that are unique to the message those are things that are not necessarily taught out here in the church world so if it's just going on if it's just if everything just keeps going as it always has every morning is the same every night is the same then what what does it matter then it looks like God didn't keep his promise but if you can look back you can see we're not children of the darkness we're children of light light has come in the end time to show us what God's been doing all these years that he was working in the first church as he was working in the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth God was working and so most denominations the Baptist can't explain Wesley they can't explain it they acknowledge it was the move of God but they can't explain it the wesle can't explain Pentecost they don't they can't cope with it can't comprehend it and so they have to just say well it was false right the Pentecostals don't can't explain the message of the hour they don't understand it but we understand there's a place for the for the Pentecostal there was a place for the wesle there was a place for the Baptists and the and the Lutheran and the Calvinists why because we believe the message of the hour those things just don't come out of nowhere and then what does that make us it makes us children of light we are children of light the children of of the day we're not of the night nor of Darkness we don't have to goow up around and go from here here to here and try to find what's true what's true is there truth maybe we misunderstood something maybe there's something that the church has never understood you mean God's never had a bride think about it when the Oneness Church come out with the name of God they didn't understand what had happened and that God winked in ignorance with Arian baptism they believe that trinitarian baptism was always wrong and and and it was but they don't understand what God was doing and so they throw out everything and say well here was some at the beginning and then it didn't happen again for 2,000 years God just didn't have a bride for 2,000 years now think about that we take for granted these things that we believe but we're children of light we're Children of the day we know we're not of the night we know what God was doing something and so we don't even have to be hopeless about those that are sealed into another age or those that are foolish virgin we realize God's got a handful of change in his pocket he's got pennies he's got quarters he got diamonds he's got dollars there's all kinds of people that are God's people we have room for them and hope for them are you with me even those that don't don't follow exactly what we believe but we we realize that God has got all kinds of people so we don't have to put anybody out let God do that right why because we're children of light Children of the day we're not of the night we're not of the darkness he said therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober sober that sober is to be sober of mind it doesn't mean not to drink but what it means is to not be overcome by your emotions to not be overcome by your emotions to not be so worried or so fearful that you have to change with every wind of Doctrine but to understand to be sober and understand what's going on for they that sleep sleep in the night they that be drunken are drunken in the night that's the people who don't understand but remember what Daniel said he said the wise will understand and know their God he said they that be drunken are drunken in the night he said but let us who are of the day how many are of the the day this evening I'm of the day it may be just a little bit but it's it's a light around me it may seem like Darkness all around me but there's light I'm of the day let let us who are of the day be sober again there's that word to to make sure that our minds are are not overcome by all these things that are going on he said putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for a helmet where does the helmet go on the head now look at this word sober again to be sober to be calm and Collective to be temperate dispassionate circumspect not to be overcome by emotion that's what it means 1 Thessalonians 5:9 for God ha not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that who died for us whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him he said wherefore Comfort yourselves to together and edify one another even as also you do now so Paul is saying put on the hope of Salvation as a helmet so you can maintain your sobriety in a world that's drunk with ignorance and Insanity maintain that ability to to understand where you are and what hour you live in he said wherefore Comfort yourselves together edify one another even as also you do Ephesians 6:17 he speaks of it again he said take the helmet of salvation the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God so the helmet of salvation is the hope of Salvation now brother Bram says that's he said he says the soul then he says the mind he said the mind in here the head covers the head covers the head he said how you going to let this helmet what's what it does he said it's a protection it's a protection what is a helmet made out of brass take a brass helmet and try to punch it you're going to hurt right man out of brass it's hard tempered he said harder than iron a brass headpiece what salvation knowledge what was Paul talking about the hope of Salvation Being Sober he says put on the the hope of Salvation as a helmet here he says brass can be tempered uh he said a brass headpiece is the Salvation knowledge of knowing this my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God Amen my experience matches his word you see why it's so important that we teach a word that's sober and that's sane we we start teaching that it's tongues it's evidence or or you have to jump and you have to shout and you have to run all over the church what that does is it makes people where they don't keep sober as to what their experience whether it matches the word that's right we our experience has to match the word there's nothing wrong with those things but our experience is not based in those things my experience matches the word and and that hope of Salvation that I have that helmet that I've got on that expectation of Salvation keeps me oh my from allowing the Devil to talk me out of who I am right CU I know this my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word there you are covered over with a protection the helmet of salvation Deliverance take that then go marching forward oh church we we need that helmet of salvation today we need that more than in any other hours as the devil is just pouring things on you and he'll try to make you think well everything is going to pieces and the church is not what it should be and the message is not what it should be and the devil will attack you by websites and he'll attack you by preachers and he'll attack you by people and just over just a constant Onslaught even he'll use your own family against you but you get up in the morning you put on that helmet of the hope of Salvation you begin to walk out in it and you begin to realize my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God I I match my experience in the Bible it don't matter what they say I've got my helmet on I expect to be delivered I expect if the Rapture comes today I'm going my body is going to be changed I expect that God will do things for me I believe that he'll heal me I believe he'll save my children I believe I have an expectation of Salvation amen and that protects me from everything that would come through my mind in the world that we live in take that and then go marching forward so the Roman helmet you could see was a protection it covered over it might have been heavy to wear might have been hard I wouldn't have wanted to try to wear a hat like that that's made out of brass it might have made your hair look weird might have made you sweat but it was protection it was protection might look funny to the world but they had been through the battle and they knew what it took amen what brought Jesus up out of the Grave it was the expectation of God's word he believed God's word and it brought him he believed his own word and it brought him up out of the Grave the hope of Salvation the expectation that God would would would uh do what he said he would do that's what the Jews are still holding on to today and one day that faith for 144,000 Jews will be rewarded why because they have a hope and expectation of Salvation and so the Romans could put this on and they could walk around and they weren't afraid because they had an expectation the helmet was good it was the best in the world it would keep them from danger how much more should we have an expectation in the of Salvation that our God keeps his word brother Brandman and knoweth it not he said brother George Wright sitting here is 75 or 78 years old he said what would you think would have happened if You' have went to seen sister Wright someday and you would have been standing in a pair of shorts he said why you never you'd had the woman locked up you'd have never married her well if any young man in that day would have done it the same thing would have took place listen Brothers we need to appreciate our wives because our wives go out on a world full of women that they don't look like and they're doing that for us and for God but they're doing that for us when it comes to our wives we don't have to worry about them going out in the world and somebody lusting after them because of the way they're dressed because of the way they look are you with me some people are will will lust after anything but you understand they've kept themselves we ought to appreciate that very much instead of pushing them off and thinking I see young people today go out in the world and try to find some girl that dresses just as awful as she can look because it's so different from what they're used to around the church but you find out once you're married for a while you appreciate a woman that keeps herself right keeps herself holy you don't want what the world world has somebody that'll hold back and not not show that to everybody else are you with me now he said if a young man in that day would have done it he said he said you'd have never married her he saidy young man in that day would have done it the same thing would have took place she'd be a dishonorable woman to present herself like that he said well it was sin if it was sin and wrong then it's the same thing but the people has grow into Insanity these and you know you've heard me enough now I'm not a a preacher that just constantly talks about specific things but just bear with me for a moment these yoga pants women wear today that's insanity and you have to Shield your eyes just think my she forgot to put pants on forgot to put a skirt on something you know why would why would anybody and then you look at the schools and I watch the schools with my kids and and the kids don't want to dress that way they want to dress like my girls they do they go up to my girls they want to they want to put on a dress they like to look nice and the parents buy these clothes for them it's awful and then of course after the kids get older they realize boys look at them huh but I found even my girls you got to beat the the boys away with the stick you know not only because they're pretty because they look like they're Daddy no they look like their mother just thought I'd threw that throw that in for a bit of humor but but they're pretty but that's not it they're different and and and the boys even in the school will will look at that and and there's something about that that's just different but you see what we're doing it's Insanity people grow into that like the frog that got put in a bowl of warm water just kept turning up the heat and after a while if a woman can do whatever she wants to do and if a man says anything about it not that the man the man has no right to do anything but if he would it's completely his fault and she has nothing to do in it what is it it's grown into Insanity what what do we need we need the helmet of salvation to keep us from becoming that Brothers as you go out in the world you need the helmet of salvation to keep you from looking at that if it was sin then and wrong then it's the same thing if adultery was wrong yesterday it's wrong today today if ungodliness was wrong yesterday it's wrong today we don't grow into something that's outside of the word if what we're doing is wrong and we know what it is if what we're doing is wrong let's just stop doing it do what's right the world may have grown into insanity but we have a clear picture amen by the word of God I don't know where that come from that wasn't in my notes that's free Lord help me August 15th 1965 brother Brandon preaches he said let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is grouping in insanity and I wouldn't look that up because I thought brother BR said groping in Insanity he actually says grouping in Insanity grouping in insanity and it seems like when they come in groups they get worse as the mob grows bigger and you can look and if you've looked at what's happened over the last couple of weeks it's like a a microcosm it's like a a microscope on what's going on in the world that people are just grouping together in lawlessness where no law applies no no whatever every man does what's right in his own eyes and so the people go into bondage because without any law everybody's a slave right and it applies in the natural and the spiritual so there has to be something you believe in something is true the whole world is grouping in insanity and how do they do it today by Facebook I'm not against Facebook but I'm saying that's how they do it they do it by by Twitter they do it by Insanity until the police even know when there's about to be something take place because there are people online who never get out of their parents' basement who are actually causing these riots and Things by stirring up the people and these people get out on the streets and get arrested and I heard the governor of Arkansas say today the people who are instigating it never somehow never get arrested but it's so they cover their tracks but it's the ones who get out there on the front line they get arrested not even knowing why they're mad don't even know why they're stirred up they just get stirred up because they're grouping in Insanity they just come together and the more the more insane people you get around the less insane you feel the more righteous you feel like your cause is the whole world is grouping in Insanity will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's almost that way now he said look what Darkness we're in today look what's going on today look at murder rape Strife he said why it's come to pass I believe it was Billy Graham said in 10 years from now every citizen of California will have to pack a gun to protect himself where are we at today he said you can't put enough law enforcement the people have just gone insane shooting murder rapes everything see it's gone wild upon the streets see it's a day we're living in a sodomite day until you look at the our even our own monuments in Washington and I saw a picture of the of the Lincoln Memorial with every step lined with soldiers because it took that many people with automatic machine guns to keep people from defacing the greatest Monument to Freedom we have probably in this country what's going on if they if they hadn't been there they would have defaced the Monument of the man who gave his life to free the slaves it makes no sense I'm so glad we're not in the darkness amen you see the world how it's been how it is he says it's gone wild since today we're living in a sodomite day but there is a light shining oh I'm so grateful for that great Shining Light today there is a light shining he said if they'd only look if they'd only see look into the word and see what's supposed to be in this hour they would know what's trying to be done for God ha not given us the spirit of fear the Bible says but of power and of love and of a sound mind God has not given us the spirit of fear the world is full of it but he's not given it to us but he's given us power he's given us love he's given us a sound mind a sober mind Children of the day brother brand I'm again I'm sorry for keeping you but as long as I have but it'll just be a minute a couple minutes longer a couple is variable but I try to get myself a little room and not lie to you I'm sorry I want to get try to get through this tonight he said watch them when they come to the other country speaking of Americans it makes you sick to even think you're America the way they act it's rightest the nastiest acting people the most impudent impudent independ dependent educated idiots what would he think today he said and the other world knows it said no wonder we're trying to buy our friendship with our dollars they look at third world countries I've been in third world countries those people have so much more respect for themselves and for their neighbors than we do I say we as a nation the other world knows it he said no wonder we're trying to buy our friendship with our dollars you don't buy friendship he said our nation is rotten to the roots there's no hope for it it's all gone there's only one thing to look for the coming of the Lord oh my you see our hope of Salvation gives us the ability to keep pressing on listen it's in this hour and it may seem like an oxymoron as I'm closing tonight but it may seem like a strange thing it's in this hour that we invest in our local church it's in when the dark dark Ness is the hardest that's when we put in the time that's needed it's when the darkness is is the is the worst that's when we pray more that's when we seek God more that's when the Bible said we should assemble together more as we see the day approaching why because the darkness is all around us the darkness is so powerful but light is always more powerful than Darkness so we build we plant we do the things that we have to do to keep the kingdom of God going because because we have hope it may look like they say well why do you do the things that you do why do you want to why do you want to keep things going why do you want to keep things looking as nice as possible and and keep people and keep witnessing and keep if it the Lord's coming anyhow I read a story of a of a town in Maine where they gave the people about six months warning that they were going to flood the place and this Village or town would be completely washed over in water so they gave the people 6 months warning to get out out guess what happened not a yard got mowed not a house got painted and they said walking into that town just before the water was about to fall it looked like it was just a ghost town why because they were hopeless they were hopeless they gave up oh church and know if we're not careful the devil get us in that position where we feel like we're hopeless well the Lord's coming anyway might as well just eat drink could be married there it's not things haven't worked out like we thought they would we might as well just pull off to ourselves no we keep building we keep investing we keep working we keep shouting we keep praising we keep witnessing we keep reaching out why because the world is falling apart but we're not we don't invest in our church or invest in our families because we don't believe the Lord is coming I believe a man if he if he doesn't doesn't have an education like he should and he sees a way to better himself do that if you can and still serve the Lord like you should if you don't have a good job and you want to try to train do something to get a better job do that if you can if if something needs painted paint it if a house needs build buil build it why because not because you don't believe the Lord is coming but because you believe he is I'm going to be all the light I can be while I'm here so it puts even more urgency in what we do not because of hopelessness but because of Hope the hope that I have for the future gives me hope for today see Jesus said this Jesus knowing that he was going to die yet all the way to the Cross he does good things he he does good for people he heals the blind eyes and makes the lame walk and raises the Dead all the way to his own cross knowing what was going to happen but what does he say he says I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work said now's not the time to when when things are dark and it don't seem like there's many folks around now's not the time to to do and to work and to really put your heart into it no now is the time to do that if there ever was a time to work Now's the Time H the devil's working over time because he knows his end is short he hasn't given up he still shows up at church I heard brother Andrew Glover preaching the other day and he talked about how the devil is still always the most faithful one to be there but why why is he always there because he hasn't given up he's still trying to do all he can do knowing he has an end out there he knows that it's true he knows God is real he's been right there before the throne he knows God is real but he keeps going anyway we know God is real and we keep going anyway we know the coming of the Lord is near but we keep walking he said see then that you walk circumspectly in Ephesians 5:15 circumspectly that's that word soberly with with the right kind of mind think what about what you do walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time Redeeming the time because the days are evil brother BR says if you're building a house put it on up Jesus comes tomorrow you'll be found faithful it's your duty if you're Building a Church go on put it up I'd rather be putting my money in something like that that'd be found with it in my pocket we're not building a new building that's not why I'm saying that I'm not about to Spring something on you but we got to keep our hope keep pressing on how do we increase that Romans 5 and3 we have hope through experience not only so he said but we glory and tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience patience experience and experience hope we have hopec we have the hope of Salvation because we've experienced salvation and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us we also find Hope in the scriptures Romans 15:4 for whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope have hope by the Holy Ghost Romans chapter 15 and 13 now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost amen nothing gives you hope like seeing the Holy Ghost work in your life Psalms 13 and5 says this musicians go ahead and come he said I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope there's a story of the school system in a large city that had a program to help children keep up with their schoolwork during stays in the City Hospital one day a teacher was assigned who was assigned to the program received a routine call asking her to visit a particular child she took the child's name and room number talked with the child's class teacher and the teacher told her said we're studying nouns and adverbs now and that's what he's missing so why don't you go and and teach him about nouns and adver verbs no one had mentioned to the hospital program teacher that the boy had been badly burned and was in great pain he was she was upset when she saw him when she left she felt she hadn't accomplished much just teaching a dying boy about nouns and adverbs seems like a strange thing to do the next day as she was making rounds in the hospital a nurse come to her and said what did you do to that boy and she thought she must have done something she needed to apologize for and she the nurse said no you don't know what I mean we've been worried about that little boy because he had no hope but ever since yesterday his whole attitude has changed he's fighting back responding to treatment it's almost like he's decided to live the boy explained later that he had given up hope until the teacher arrived and as she sat there and began to teach him brother his it's nouns and adverbs what a strange thing to give hope nouns and adverbs but heut he said it this way he said they wouldn't send a teacher to teach me nouns and adverbs if I was a dying boy amen oh my don't you real don't you recognize don't you realize the reason why God keeps talking to us keeps preaching to us

Lord in my own rushed way but Lord I I know that you still spoke to your people tonight and you spoke to my heart through these things help us to never give up hope there's never a situation Lord that I found that maybe I've been in situations where people were angry I've never found a situation where if I could get them to talk to one another if I could get them to sit down at the table and have lunch together and work together eventually they just couldn't hold that level of anger and I realize Lord that it's just because they found Hope as they to begin to work together I pray it would be so with us Lord that we would find Hope in our lives as we work together Lord as we move towards the Future No Matter what's happened in the past there is no situation that's so far gone that if we'll
