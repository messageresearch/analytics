[43:30] [Music]
[43:50] Lord we love you so much Lord we thank
[43:54] you for your constant presence with us
[43:58] Lord when there's so many times we don't
[44:00] acknowledge it but Lord tonight we want
[44:02] to and we just want to take these
[44:05] moments set them aside and let you take
[44:07] the preeminence in our lives and in this
[44:10] service I pray you bind every spirit
[44:13] that would be unlike you Lord
[44:16] every bit of carnality in me Lord that
[44:20] that would try to go my own way I pray
[44:23] that you'd find that tonight and speak
[44:26] directly to your people tonight
[44:28] those that are here those that are
[44:30] watching oh God me me just track a
[44:33] Revival of the word in our hearts
[44:35] tonight
[44:36] it means something to us Lord and we not
[44:39] just take it as another service but Lord
[44:41] may it be a reality in our lives
[44:44] you are a god of Miracles
[44:48] or we believe that tonight
[44:50] more than may you work miracles in the
[44:52] congregation Among Us Lord we'll give
[44:55] you the praise and the glory and the
[44:56] honor for every need Lord we believe
[44:58] that you'll meet those needs that were
[45:00] represented uplifted hand we pray and we
[45:03] ask in Jesus name
[45:05] [Music]
[45:07] First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 8
[45:10] we'll read down through verse 11. I want
[45:13] to get back on a gift tonight
[45:16] and I want to speak to you tonight on
[45:18] the working of Miracles
[45:21] I enjoyed those specials so much and uh
[45:25] all of them and the bill I hadn't heard
[45:27] that song in a long time are you afraid
[45:30] to die but I've got good words if you go
[45:32] to that third verse and and uh really
[45:35] good words and we all need to take
[45:37] account of that especially in the day
[45:38] and hour we live in is coming is near
[45:41] and we don't have much time left we want
[45:44] to serve him with all of our hearts
[45:45] don't we and I think you know we don't
[45:49] we're not afraid to die because all of
[45:51] our hope is in Jesus and we're going to
[45:54] make it through so I thought that went
[45:56] together really well this Saturday we'll
[45:58] have a work day here at the church for
[46:00] whoever we won't set any certain time I
[46:03] don't guess we'll probably I'll probably
[46:04] be up here by 8 o'clock or so in the
[46:06] morning and the brother Harvey and some
[46:08] of the rest of them that'll help the
[46:09] trustees and different ones that are
[46:11] able to be here I know not everybody can
[46:13] be here on a Saturday but if you want to
[46:14] pitch in if you that's a desire in your
[46:17] heart to do that come on a different day
[46:19] and and we'll let you in and let you
[46:22] help but there's just some things that
[46:24] need to be done it's easier with more
[46:25] hands so I appreciate you helping us
[46:28] with that
[46:29] again First Corinthians chapter 12 and
[46:32] verse eight let's just get right on the
[46:33] word tonight night for to one is given
[46:36] by the spirit the word of wisdom to
[46:38] another the word of knowledge by The
[46:39] Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same
[46:42] Spirit to another the gifts of healing
[46:44] by The Same Spirit to another the
[46:47] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[46:50] to another Discerning of spirits to
[46:52] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[46:55] another the interpretation of tongues
[46:57] but all these worketh that one and the
[47:01] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[47:04] severally as he will pray the Lord
[47:07] without his Blessing to the word you may
[47:09] be seated
[47:11] the word Miracles that Paul uses is
[47:14] Dynamics which is a power a deed of
[47:18] power it literally describes the ability
[47:21] to perform an activity by extension it
[47:24] refers to someone in a position of power
[47:26] for the force of a person's uh
[47:30] person's action and so the action the
[47:33] person that we're talking about is the
[47:36] person of Jesus Christ and he is the
[47:39] worker of Miracles how many believe that
[47:41] tonight he is the worker of Miracles and
[47:45] so he is the one who has the uh who is
[47:48] The Giver of the gift to perform
[47:50] Miracles now the random differentiates
[47:53] this from Divine Healing he said you
[47:55] know many of you gets the wrong
[47:57] conception of Divine Healing he said now
[47:59] this is not a gift to perform Miracles
[48:01] Miracles is a separate and different
[48:04] gift from healing he said the Bible said
[48:07] do all have the gift of healing to all
[48:09] have the gift of Miracles see but
[48:11] Miracles are performed
[48:14] he said that's right it's a miracle
[48:16] every time he said somebody a vision
[48:19] that happens and tells people what's
[48:21] wrong with them he said that's a miracle
[48:24] It's Supernatural so any Supernatural
[48:27] event without explanation that is a
[48:30] miracle if I can tell some of you
[48:32] haven't found your seats yet
[48:35] that is a miracle I just love changing
[48:38] the seats up
[48:39] it's a miracle every time somebody a
[48:42] vision happens and tells people what's
[48:44] wrong with them that's a miracle It's
[48:46] Supernatural and we don't think about it
[48:49] like that but that what was working in
[48:50] brother Brown's life could be classified
[48:52] as a miracle because it's supernatural
[48:55] it's beyond explanation and so the
[48:57] difference in healing in America would
[48:59] be a healing God uh uses doctors to heal
[49:02] he uses medicine to heal he uses Divine
[49:06] Healing by laying on of hands that's
[49:08] your faith when when hands are laid on
[49:10] you if you go and listen to the message
[49:12] perfect faith brother Branham teaches us
[49:15] in there how to have hands laid on us
[49:17] and and how we should expect God to meet
[49:20] that need but that's healing right and
[49:22] yet God does Miracles as well where a
[49:25] cancer can be removed like that or a
[49:28] crippled person would stand up and walk
[49:30] that's a miracle that's beyond any kind
[49:33] of of understanding of human beings and
[49:35] I'll tell you this we need miracles in
[49:38] our church we mean miracle in our lives
[49:41] we need to believe in miracles
[49:43] we need to believe in miracles because
[49:45] there's going to be moments in your life
[49:47] when you need a supernatural God
[49:51] when when the natural doesn't work
[49:53] anymore when the theology doesn't work
[49:55] anymore when the psychology doesn't work
[49:57] anymore when you've gone as as far on
[50:00] the tree of knowledge as you can go you
[50:02] need to step over onto the tree of life
[50:04] and let Miracles take place in your life
[50:07] we need miracles
[50:10] amen it's somebody something beyond your
[50:13] comprehension
[50:15] if you look behind me there's a cross
[50:17] and I didn't intend to use it as an
[50:19] illustration tonight but isn't that
[50:21] wonderful brother brother Mark made that
[50:23] cross
[50:24] to me that's a miracle
[50:27] because it's beyond my ability to do
[50:30] right it's beyond my comprehension if I
[50:33] made one it wouldn't look like that so
[50:35] there's a superior intelligence that put
[50:38] it together and are you with me now a
[50:40] superior ability to work with wood
[50:42] listen to making this Pulpit took a
[50:45] superior ability to work with wood a
[50:47] superior intelligence I can't do that
[50:49] and so I have to I have to let someone
[50:52] do that for me that's the god that we
[50:55] serve today there's things in your life
[50:57] that you need somebody to step in and
[51:00] perform a miracle
[51:02] and that's God
[51:05] how many needs him tonight how many know
[51:08] that you need him tonight you need
[51:10] Miracles when counseling can only go so
[51:12] far when when a pastor's uh wisdom can
[51:15] only go so far right when your brother
[51:18] your sister can only say so much to help
[51:21] you you need a miracle in your life
[51:25] Hallelujah
[51:27] Moses brother Brandon said had two signs
[51:30] and I don't didn't bring the quote but
[51:32] just you can go find it he said miracles
[51:34] and healing one was a healing of leprosy
[51:37] in the hand
[51:38] and the other one was a miracle because
[51:40] it was a rod that he threw down and it
[51:42] become a serpent
[51:44] that's a miracle
[51:46] it's beyond human explanation
[51:48] according to Webster a paradox brother
[51:51] Brandon says is something that seems
[51:53] incredible but it's true
[51:55] therefore if Paradox would be the same
[51:57] as a miracle
[51:59] he said a paradox is when something that
[52:01] seems like it just couldn't be the
[52:04] knowledge of the human mind it's all
[52:06] together incredible but yet it's proven
[52:09] true now remember when we're teaching on
[52:12] the gifts that we can't teach you how to
[52:14] receive the gifts all we can do is tell
[52:17] you what it is and we can tell you that
[52:20] it's present and we can tell you those
[52:22] nine spiritual gifts are in the body
[52:24] that God does Miracles he's a worker of
[52:26] Miracles but what what is a gift to work
[52:28] miracles it's somebody who is able to
[52:31] believe that God is still God that he's
[52:34] still the same yesterday today and
[52:36] forever somebody who's able to reach out
[52:38] by simple faith and grab a hold of the
[52:40] fact that God does things beyond my
[52:42] explanation
[52:47] are you with me tonight
[52:51] it seems like it just couldn't be he
[52:54] said the knowledge of the human mind
[52:55] it's all together incredible but yet
[52:58] it's proven true
[53:00] he said now a miracle would be the same
[53:02] thing for a miracle cannot be explained
[53:04] a miracle is something that happens you
[53:06] cannot explain it he said that makes it
[53:09] a paradox it's incredible
[53:10] but yet it's the truth
[53:13] we believe in a god of Miracles
[53:16] our Miracle working God changed Abraham
[53:19] and Sarah's bodies
[53:21] and you don't know how he did it
[53:23] right I don't know how he did it but he
[53:25] did it
[53:26] hey man do you wear a grandma that that
[53:30] was too old to be to have children that
[53:33] was almost at the end of her life turned
[53:35] back and become such a desirable young
[53:38] woman beautiful young woman that a king
[53:40] tried to take her away from Abraham
[53:43] proud to be one of his wives and I have
[53:46] what would cause that
[53:48] it had to be a miracle-working god
[53:51] it was a miracle working God that
[53:52] brought plagues on the Egyptians frogs
[53:55] and and and and hail and darkness and
[53:58] the death of the firstborn a miracle
[54:00] working God
[54:01] it was a miracle working God that opened
[54:03] the Red Sea for Moses
[54:06] I'm just going through some things that
[54:07] I thought of and I put them down because
[54:09] well I want to remind you that we serve
[54:12] a miracle working God
[54:14] it was a miracle working God that caused
[54:17] that Red Sea to open it they said well
[54:19] he walked across on I walked across on
[54:21] uh just a little bit of water on a sea
[54:24] of reeds and brother said well that
[54:26] would be even more of a miracle because
[54:27] he drowned all the Egyptians in that
[54:29] water
[54:33] it was a miracle that stopped the Sun
[54:35] for Joshua
[54:37] unexplainable that's brother Raymond's
[54:39] Point by the way he's not trying to tell
[54:41] you that the that the Earth is flat or
[54:44] or that the Earth doesn't move when
[54:47] brother random talks about this it was
[54:49] the son that stood still because the
[54:50] Bible is true
[54:52] he said that's not that ball of gas out
[54:54] there that missile he calls it but he
[54:57] said somehow this son that you see Stood
[55:00] Still the reflection of the sun he said
[55:03] but that doesn't make sense because if
[55:05] the Earth stopped and it would all fall
[55:07] off because gravity would stop don't you
[55:09] see it's a miracle it's beyond
[55:11] explanation
[55:13] it's not supposed to make sense
[55:18] right
[55:20] stop the Sun for Joshua he raised the
[55:23] dead shunamite for Elisha the dead
[55:26] shunamites boy
[55:27] he delivered the three Hebrew children
[55:29] from the fire that don't make sense that
[55:32] they didn't even smell like smoke
[55:34] and the only thing the fire burned was
[55:36] the ropes off of their hands
[55:39] that don't make sense but he did it
[55:42] he delivered Daniel from the Lions
[55:45] turn the water to wine
[55:47] fed five thousand with the loaf and two
[55:50] fishes
[55:51] that don't make any sense that they took
[55:53] up 12 basket full of leftovers
[55:59] leftovers after they got done eating at
[56:01] the buffet
[56:03] and it was one little boy's lunch
[56:05] that's a miracle
[56:07] it was a miracle that opened
[56:08] bartimaeus's eyes
[56:10] miracle that Cath Legion the the demon
[56:14] Legion of demons out of the maniac of
[56:16] gadera we heard about on Sunday night
[56:19] it was a miracle that raised up Christ
[56:21] on the third day
[56:23] unexplainable but true
[56:26] it was a miracle that raised a lame man
[56:28] at the gate beautiful
[56:30] it was a miracle that delivered Peter
[56:32] from prison and we could go on and on
[56:34] and on speaking of miracles in the New
[56:36] Testament why because we serve a Jehovah
[56:39] of Miracles
[56:42] we still do tonight
[56:45] you don't want to get so carnal
[56:48] that you can't
[56:49] leave God any room to work
[56:53] brother Branham says that this lady said
[56:54] you need to get out of order just long
[56:56] enough to get saved
[56:59] and in preaching these gifts a lot of
[57:01] what we talk about is church order and
[57:03] we want that we we want to make sure we
[57:05] get it right and he said well how do we
[57:07] know if we get it right well the prophet
[57:08] was right about it
[57:11] and the Bible's right about it so we
[57:13] want to make sure that we get it right
[57:14] but at the same time we need to maintain
[57:17] our belief in a miracle-working God we
[57:20] need to understand that God can get out
[57:22] of the way and get us out of the way and
[57:25] move us in a different direction and
[57:27] make the service go away that we didn't
[57:29] intend who does that a miracle working
[57:31] God
[57:32] how many times has God spoken directly
[57:35] to you in the service talk to you some
[57:37] of you told me how God talked to you
[57:39] directly in the service and I'm not
[57:40] talking about like brother Branham with
[57:42] discernment I'm talking about the
[57:43] preaching of the word that spoke
[57:44] directly to your heart because the word
[57:46] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[57:48] intents of the heart
[57:49] how many times has he done that that's a
[57:52] miracle
[57:55] and you can either believe in a miracle
[57:57] working God or turn him down but I'd
[57:59] rather believe in the Jehovah of
[58:00] Miracles
[58:01] I'd rather believe in a lord Jesus
[58:03] Christ who's the same Hebrews 13 and ate
[58:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:10] Hallelujah
[58:12] you might ask me tonight
[58:14] why does God do miracles
[58:17] you ever think about that
[58:19] you don't have to
[58:21] right now again in a way because of the
[58:25] atonement God is obligated to heal you
[58:29] based on your faith but he's not
[58:30] obligated to give you a miracle
[58:33] he is obligated to heal you
[58:35] you say well I
[58:37] I just let him heal me I won't ever
[58:38] believe for a miracle then think about
[58:39] this
[58:41] the obligation of healing wasn't
[58:43] extended to the Gentiles until after
[58:46] Jesus left the scene
[58:49] that's right because Jesus told the the
[58:52] South Phoenician woman he said the
[58:54] healing is the children's bread
[58:56] so it's not for you dogs
[58:59] but she had the right attitude
[59:02] amen but she said I know that it's not
[59:06] promised to me
[59:08] but I believe that even the little dogs
[59:10] eat the crumbs that fall from the
[59:12] master's table
[59:13] and that's the way we ought to be about
[59:15] miracles I understand that what I'm
[59:18] promised is healing what I'm promised is
[59:20] is God will heal me he didn't say when
[59:22] but he would heal me but yet I also
[59:24] believe in a miracle working God and
[59:26] sometimes I need a supernatural
[59:28] intervention
[59:30] and I'm gonna be like the South
[59:31] Phoenician woman he won't even
[59:33] discourage me right the word itself
[59:35] won't even discourage me from seeking a
[59:38] miracle
[59:39] are you with me now he let God do what
[59:42] he wants to but leave the option open
[59:44] right oh God I believe you're a Jehovah
[59:46] of Miracles
[59:50] why does God do Miracles brother random
[59:51] talks about the eagle
[59:53] and how she has a little nest full of of
[59:56] eaglets
[59:57] and she wants to show the eaglets her
[1:00:01] power
[1:00:02] and so she wants something the reason
[1:00:05] why she wants them to see who she is so
[1:00:08] they can recognize who they can be
[1:00:12] a miracle working God wants you to show
[1:00:14] you miracles so you think you can
[1:00:17] recognize that you are a miracle
[1:00:20] so brother bear said she gets up there
[1:00:22] before this little fellow because why
[1:00:25] she's going to take him on a flight
[1:00:28] he's never been out of that Nest some of
[1:00:31] us need to get out of the nest
[1:00:34] we need to get out of our comfort zone
[1:00:36] yeah
[1:00:37] yeah we need to get out of our
[1:00:38] comfortable chair
[1:00:40] and get into a place where we can
[1:00:42] receive from God
[1:00:45] he's going to take him on a flight he's
[1:00:47] never been out of that nest and she's
[1:00:49] going to take him way up in the heavens
[1:00:52] and Shake him off
[1:00:54] and let him up there to flock for
[1:00:56] himself
[1:00:58] to learn how to fly
[1:01:00] so she wants to show The Authority she
[1:01:04] has
[1:01:06] now watch this
[1:01:07] she spreads forth her big wings to the
[1:01:11] strutting of the feathers and she
[1:01:13] screams and then she fans them
[1:01:16] oh my the feathers fly out of the nest
[1:01:19] you realize Revival is uncomfortable
[1:01:23] there's never been a comfortable Revival
[1:01:25] you you said well brother Ben I want
[1:01:27] Revival I want to see God move for my
[1:01:29] family I want to see God move for my
[1:01:31] children it won't be comfortable
[1:01:33] it's not going to leave you sitting like
[1:01:35] you were when it came look Revival is
[1:01:38] uncomfortable Revival gets you thinking
[1:01:41] about your your sin Revival gets you
[1:01:43] thinking about where you've come up
[1:01:45] short Revival puts you under conviction
[1:01:48] and puts a desire in your heart a
[1:01:50] burning desire to serve God
[1:01:53] huh
[1:01:54] that's what Revival does
[1:01:57] and so now these are 10 these little
[1:01:59] eagles are in Revival
[1:02:01] oh my the feathers fly over the nest and
[1:02:04] everything else she's throwing wind in
[1:02:05] there like out of a Jet Plane knocks him
[1:02:08] backwards and he lays on his little back
[1:02:12] and he looks up and thinks
[1:02:14] mother How Great Thou Art
[1:02:18] How Great Thou Art
[1:02:20] isn't that what he does to us so many
[1:02:22] times when we come and hear the
[1:02:24] preaching of the word when we're sitting
[1:02:26] in a service in the presence of God
[1:02:28] begins to move so supernaturally that we
[1:02:30] can we can just feel it all around us he
[1:02:33] doesn't have to do that he never has to
[1:02:35] let us feel it again but he does it
[1:02:37] anyway why does he do it because he
[1:02:39] wants us to be knocked back on our back
[1:02:42] and lay there and think oh God How Great
[1:02:44] Thou Art
[1:02:49] make you uncomfortable
[1:02:51] put you in a service
[1:02:53] makes you uncomfortable people talk bad
[1:02:55] about you people say you're Pentecostal
[1:02:59] people say you're nuts
[1:03:03] you just say there and say oh God
[1:03:06] How Great Thou Art
[1:03:09] but the JT Justin Hall at the presence
[1:03:12] of God
[1:03:13] and the power of God we need to know
[1:03:15] what that's like church
[1:03:17] we don't need to forget what it's like
[1:03:19] to be under the influence of a miracle
[1:03:22] working God
[1:03:30] see how strong my wings are
[1:03:32] I can pick you up and pack you anywhere
[1:03:35] I want to
[1:03:37] I'm powerful
[1:03:39] he said that's what God was doing to
[1:03:41] Israel you remember he told them he said
[1:03:43] I brought you out On Eagle's Wings
[1:03:45] he didn't have to do it that way he
[1:03:48] could have led him a different direction
[1:03:49] they would have never come up against
[1:03:51] the Red Sea but why did he lead Moses to
[1:03:53] the banks of the Red Sea why did he lead
[1:03:56] you right to the banks of a trial why
[1:03:58] did he put you here in laodicea he could
[1:04:00] have made it easy for you he could have
[1:04:02] made it easy for me but he didn't do it
[1:04:04] why didn't he do it but again because he
[1:04:07] wanted to show us how strong he was he
[1:04:10] wanted to show us his Deliverance power
[1:04:11] he could have made everything easy for
[1:04:14] you and your family he could have made
[1:04:15] the road paved it made it all easy but
[1:04:18] every time you have a victory it seems
[1:04:20] like you take another step back every
[1:04:21] time there's a Mountaintop there's also
[1:04:23] a valley why he's bringing you through a
[1:04:25] route that will cause you to understand
[1:04:27] how great he is he's bringing you
[1:04:30] through oh I I wonder if anyone's ever
[1:04:32] experienced that in your life he's
[1:04:34] brought you through a route that shows
[1:04:35] you I'm God I'm a great God I'm an
[1:04:38] awesome God
[1:04:40] good yes sir Hallelujah
[1:04:44] oh
[1:04:46] I wish I wasn't so fat sometimes
[1:04:51] I preach like him evangelist here
[1:04:53] but doesn't it stir your heart yeah
[1:04:58] doesn't this stir your heart
[1:05:00] look up and say
[1:05:05] you knocked me on my back
[1:05:07] you showed me your power
[1:05:10] that's what God was doing to Israel he
[1:05:11] said you know he said it's the eagle
[1:05:13] stirth of finesse that's the same thing
[1:05:15] he found Israel in a howling land down
[1:05:17] there he brought him up out of Egypt
[1:05:19] took him into the promised land on the
[1:05:21] wings of an eagle
[1:05:22] what was God doing these miracles
[1:05:25] what was God doing these Miracles he was
[1:05:27] trying
[1:05:28] to get to his people that he was the
[1:05:31] mighty Jehovah
[1:05:33] and that's what he's trying to do today
[1:05:37] he just doesn't heal people just because
[1:05:40] he can heal
[1:05:41] he's trying to get to you that he's the
[1:05:45] resurrection
[1:05:47] over to God so if you never got sick you
[1:05:51] would never understand what the
[1:05:52] resurrection means but because you were
[1:05:55] flat on your back one time in a hotel
[1:05:57] where in a hospital room because you
[1:05:59] knew what it was like to be at the verge
[1:06:01] of death because you had some sickness
[1:06:03] in your body and you've had to fight it
[1:06:05] over and over again God was showing you
[1:06:06] every time he heals you every time he
[1:06:08] lets you live another day he's shown you
[1:06:10] there's a resurrection somewhere every
[1:06:13] time he gives you the strength to come
[1:06:14] to the house of God sister friends he's
[1:06:16] shown you there's a resurrection yes
[1:06:19] Hallelujah
[1:06:21] I'm glad he does it
[1:06:23] he's trying to get to you that he's the
[1:06:25] resurrection that he can make you well
[1:06:27] he can raise up your body he can do
[1:06:30] whatever he wants to he's Jehovah
[1:06:33] Hallelujah
[1:06:35] miracles
[1:06:37] he's a miracle working God yet we
[1:06:39] understand Miracles are sovereign
[1:06:43] we know when the tempter came to him he
[1:06:45] said if thou be the Son of God command
[1:06:47] that these stones to be made bread
[1:06:49] that would be a miracle
[1:06:51] he answered and said it is written man
[1:06:53] shall not live by bread alone
[1:06:55] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:06:57] the mouth of God
[1:06:59] that's why we don't take up serpents at
[1:07:02] least on purpose
[1:07:04] all right because if I brought out a box
[1:07:07] of rattlesnakes today I I don't know how
[1:07:09] much faithful I know I wouldn't I
[1:07:11] wouldn't be around
[1:07:12] I'd let Billy Joel preach that service
[1:07:15] my brother Stewart one of the other
[1:07:16] brothers I I just don't think I could
[1:07:19] handle it
[1:07:20] me in a boxer rattlesnakes don't mix
[1:07:23] and we don't take up serpents because we
[1:07:25] don't tempt God
[1:07:27] but if I come in the line of duty like
[1:07:29] Paul was and I find myself over a
[1:07:32] campfire and one bites me in the hand
[1:07:35] I've got a miracle working God
[1:07:38] I serve a miracle working god brother
[1:07:40] Branham talks about the man who got bit
[1:07:42] by a rattlesnake down in Florida he was
[1:07:44] out here out fishing and it wasn't too
[1:07:46] long after he was after he was prayed
[1:07:48] for that he was completely well and the
[1:07:49] poison had left his body what was that a
[1:07:52] miracle working God showing us he's the
[1:07:55] same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:57] that's right
[1:08:00] most of the Miracles we see in scripture
[1:08:02] are associated with Deliverance
[1:08:04] so if you're keeping notes write that
[1:08:06] down Deliverance
[1:08:08] Miracles are associated with Deliverance
[1:08:11] that was the case with Giddy and I want
[1:08:13] us to look at Gideon for a moment in the
[1:08:15] time that we have left
[1:08:18] and we're going to look at Gideon and I
[1:08:20] brought these things to you before but
[1:08:21] maybe take just a little bit different a
[1:08:23] slant on it tonight
[1:08:28] Judges chapter six is where you'll find
[1:08:30] the story judges six and seven
[1:08:33] says it came to pass from the children
[1:08:34] of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of
[1:08:37] the midianites
[1:08:38] that the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[1:08:41] children of Israel
[1:08:42] which said unto them thus saith the Lord
[1:08:44] God of Israel
[1:08:46] how I love that he sends a prophet
[1:08:49] and he says I brought you up from Egypt
[1:08:51] brought you forth out of the house of
[1:08:54] bondage
[1:08:55] that delivered you out of the hand of
[1:08:57] the Egyptians
[1:08:58] out of the hand of all that oppressed
[1:09:00] you and draved them out from before you
[1:09:02] and gave you their land so he's
[1:09:06] reminding them the prophet is reminding
[1:09:08] them of a miracle working God he's
[1:09:11] bringing Christ out of History making
[1:09:13] him present
[1:09:15] and I said it to you I am the Lord your
[1:09:17] God fear not the gods of the amorites
[1:09:20] and whose land you dwell but you have
[1:09:21] not obeyed my voice
[1:09:23] now brother Branham teaches us in a
[1:09:25] message that he titles if God be with us
[1:09:28] then where is all the Miracles he
[1:09:29] preached on the New Year's in a New
[1:09:31] Year's service
[1:09:32] and he titles uh that sermon if God is
[1:09:35] with us and where are all the Miracles
[1:09:37] and then he preaches that God always
[1:09:39] sends a prophet for deliverance
[1:09:42] for deliverance
[1:09:44] and I'm here to tell you tonight we're
[1:09:46] not waiting on that
[1:09:48] he has done that
[1:09:51] he has done that if you need Deliverance
[1:09:53] tonight take advantage of it
[1:09:56] you need Deliverance in your life and
[1:09:58] and yet you never pick up a tape you
[1:10:01] never read a book you never hear a
[1:10:02] prophet you don't know anything about
[1:10:05] the message you never study it you never
[1:10:07] if you need Deliverance you need to look
[1:10:09] to a Deliverance message that we had
[1:10:11] today what it was was a message of
[1:10:13] Deliverance
[1:10:15] to get us ready to deliver us from this
[1:10:18] age
[1:10:19] this message is a message of Deliverance
[1:10:21] if you need Deliverance you need to go
[1:10:23] back as as brother Andrew reminded us
[1:10:25] last week you need to get nosy in the
[1:10:27] message
[1:10:29] right I'm thankful I got some questions
[1:10:30] this week and different ones told me
[1:10:32] we're getting nosy I'm thankful for that
[1:10:34] I'm thankful for that because this
[1:10:37] message will is a message of Deliverance
[1:10:40] something in it that'll deliver you
[1:10:43] but I'm thankful also that when the
[1:10:47] messenger left
[1:10:48] he didn't just leave a void
[1:10:51] when the prophet left you didn't leave
[1:10:52] the void but he sent Christ
[1:10:57] when the angel left remember John said I
[1:11:00] must decrease that he might increase it
[1:11:03] was Christ that come and took his place
[1:11:05] and now when uh when this Angelus
[1:11:10] Prophet left uh Gideon and left that
[1:11:12] nation of Israel in Genesis 6 11 it says
[1:11:15] There came an angel of the Lord
[1:11:17] and said under an oak which was an offer
[1:11:20] the pertaining to joash yeah everybody's
[1:11:22] right his son Gideon fresh Wheat by the
[1:11:24] wine press to hide it from the
[1:11:25] midianites now he later tells us that
[1:11:28] this was the Lord in a theophany body
[1:11:31] capital l o r d
[1:11:33] Angel the Lord is a
[1:11:36] pre-incarnation uh uh pre-incarnation
[1:11:39] theophany body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:42] so now and Gideon's down here afraid to
[1:11:47] take God in his word
[1:11:49] but here comes a prophet came and went
[1:11:52] and here come the angel of the Lord
[1:11:55] Hallelujah you may not believe it but I
[1:11:59] want to testify to you what I believe
[1:12:01] tonight that when a prophet gave his
[1:12:03] message Christ the word came down
[1:12:07] and come in this place and it's here
[1:12:11] today
[1:12:12] amen the same yesterday today and
[1:12:14] forever then what do you have to be
[1:12:16] afraid of today nothing
[1:12:18] come on why because Christ has come look
[1:12:21] he said I know there's going to be a
[1:12:22] Rapture a physical Rapture we'll see a
[1:12:24] physical Lord Jesus we believe that but
[1:12:27] we also believe that he has come in our
[1:12:28] day in word form
[1:12:31] and he says oh we're living in a grand
[1:12:33] time immediately when the prophet went
[1:12:36] off the scene what happened the Lord
[1:12:38] came on the seat as soon as John went
[1:12:41] off the scene the Lord came on the sea
[1:12:43] very strange how God works but he does
[1:12:46] it he works in mysterious ways
[1:12:48] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:12:50] him and said unto him the Lord is with
[1:12:53] thee
[1:12:54] thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:12:57] brother Jason he didn't think he was a
[1:12:59] mighty man of Valor
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:03] he's hiding from the enemy
[1:13:06] he don't know he he don't even he's even
[1:13:08] afraid to take God in his word just for
[1:13:10] their basic needs
[1:13:12] and how many times we find ourselves in
[1:13:14] that same position
[1:13:16] but he says you're a mighty man of Valor
[1:13:19] and Gideon said to him oh my Lord
[1:13:22] if the Lord be with us
[1:13:24] notice he identifies him as the Lord
[1:13:26] first you got to recognize who came in
[1:13:28] our day
[1:13:29] he identified the word the Lord being
[1:13:33] present he said oh my Lord if the Lord
[1:13:36] be with us why then is all this befall
[1:13:39] in us and where is this gift of Miracles
[1:13:41] that you talked about being in the
[1:13:43] church
[1:13:45] right where be all his miracles
[1:13:49] now this is a great question
[1:13:52] and watch how he backs it up he's
[1:13:53] scriptural he said where be all his
[1:13:56] miracles which our fathers told us of
[1:13:58] saying did not the Lord bring us up out
[1:14:00] from Egypt but now the Lord hath
[1:14:01] forsaken us delivered us in the hands of
[1:14:03] the median ice but he's going back to
[1:14:04] the scripture and saying he should be
[1:14:06] the same today as he was then
[1:14:09] if he's still God he should still be the
[1:14:11] same do we still believe that today
[1:14:14] it's a valid question if God is with us
[1:14:16] why are we not delivered and I'll say
[1:14:19] this if you're living under bondage
[1:14:20] constantly in your life you need to
[1:14:23] question yes
[1:14:25] you need to question if God is with us
[1:14:27] where are all the Miracles
[1:14:29] and I'm here to tell you they're here
[1:14:32] they're here for you you don't have to
[1:14:34] live under bondage you don't have to
[1:14:37] live up and down and up and down and in
[1:14:39] and out and never know who you are and
[1:14:41] never know where you belong you can
[1:14:42] belong to him you can be one with the
[1:14:45] word in this day you can be a bride
[1:14:47] without spot or wrinkle you can be
[1:14:49] washed in the blood of the Lamb you can
[1:14:50] be a part of the bride's Revival you can
[1:14:53] be the bride's Revival
[1:14:55] that's the day we live in
[1:14:58] don't settle for anything less
[1:15:01] so he didn't just say well that's a good
[1:15:02] message praise God
[1:15:04] I believe a prophet
[1:15:06] he said if God is with us
[1:15:09] why are we not delivered
[1:15:12] you don't have to be in bondage to
[1:15:13] depression
[1:15:17] you don't have to be in bondage to
[1:15:18] pornography
[1:15:19] you don't have to be in bondage to fear
[1:15:21] yeah
[1:15:22] to nicotine to alcohol to drugs to a
[1:15:26] religious spirit
[1:15:27] you don't have to be in bondage you just
[1:15:30] need Jehovah of Miracles
[1:15:32] to come by your way
[1:15:34] he's still a miracle working God and
[1:15:37] when you need Deliverance you need to
[1:15:38] start asking questions you need to get a
[1:15:41] little uncomfortable and start asking
[1:15:42] questions Lord if you are with us where
[1:15:44] are the Miracles we need to start
[1:15:46] digging and that's that's the greatest
[1:15:48] sin of our time if I can say it that way
[1:15:50] it's complacency it's just drifting
[1:15:53] along with the tide it's becoming label
[1:15:55] to see it now if we if we don't see God
[1:15:57] in our own lives and I'm not talking
[1:15:59] about going out there and doing like
[1:16:01] he's going to do for the Jews and and
[1:16:02] bringing out a worldwide Revival I'm not
[1:16:04] talking about that I'm talking about
[1:16:06] miracles in your own life Supernatural
[1:16:09] unexplainable Revelation Supernatural
[1:16:12] unexplainable change in your life when
[1:16:14] if you don't see that you need to ask
[1:16:16] him for it
[1:16:19] yes sir
[1:16:22] and I'm preaching a little bit for a
[1:16:23] Wednesday night but it just struck me
[1:16:25] he's a god of Miracles
[1:16:27] and brother Branson those gifts are in
[1:16:29] the church today God where are you at I
[1:16:31] need you tonight
[1:16:32] where's that gift of Miracles I need
[1:16:34] that working of miracles in my life I
[1:16:37] need it in my family I need it in my
[1:16:39] home I needed in my church I need you to
[1:16:42] be a supernatural God
[1:16:47] need you to reveal yourself to me like
[1:16:49] you did to job when he said he said I've
[1:16:51] heard with my ears but now I see
[1:16:54] yeah amen now I know who you are
[1:16:58] oh how many can say Amen to that tonight
[1:17:00] I know who you are Lord I've seen you
[1:17:02] with my own eyes I know you're a worker
[1:17:04] of Miracles
[1:17:06] if you don't have that in your life you
[1:17:08] need to start digging
[1:17:10] where are my miracles
[1:17:12] if you did it for Joshua if he did it
[1:17:14] for Moses if he did it for shamgar he
[1:17:16] can do it for me too
[1:17:18] are you with me now
[1:17:20] if he delivered brother Ben
[1:17:22] I just use myself because I needed
[1:17:24] deliverance and the god of Miracles
[1:17:29] has come by my way not once not twice
[1:17:31] but many times
[1:17:33] and delivered me
[1:17:35] delivered me when I needed Deliverance
[1:17:37] or if you delivered if he delivered we
[1:17:39] think of the great evangelist brother
[1:17:41] Daryl Ward brother Andrew Glover people
[1:17:43] like that brother Ron Spencer if he
[1:17:45] delivered them I can think of people
[1:17:46] here in the church if you deliver
[1:17:48] brother JT if he delivered each and
[1:17:50] every one of you from every kind of a
[1:17:52] spirit that there was if he delivered
[1:17:54] you he can deliver our young people as
[1:17:56] well he can deliver our children as well
[1:17:58] he can deliver those that need it today
[1:18:01] foreign don't sit in complacency but
[1:18:04] believe in a god of Miracles
[1:18:08] do it for me where can I see this God In
[1:18:12] Action where is he at if he is for us he
[1:18:15] said the Mighty Man of Valor could refer
[1:18:17] back to the old word and know it's right
[1:18:19] because he knew this that God is a
[1:18:21] supernatural being and wherever a
[1:18:23] supernatural being is he'll do
[1:18:25] Supernatural signs because the
[1:18:27] Supernatural is in him you just can't
[1:18:29] get out of it
[1:18:30] he said how can you stand in the face of
[1:18:32] the wind without having wind blowing
[1:18:36] and I'm fixing I'm fixing to call
[1:18:41] I want to call the devil's Bluff
[1:18:44] because the devil sometimes will sip in
[1:18:46] and he'll tell you well you know I know
[1:18:49] you've never experienced God but you
[1:18:51] know it's really not like that anymore
[1:18:52] yeah and you just have to go through a
[1:18:55] 12-step program and someday you'll be
[1:18:56] okay
[1:18:59] it's the devil
[1:19:01] we want to call his bluff tonight
[1:19:03] right how can you get in water without
[1:19:06] being wet
[1:19:08] water is wet we know it's not all about
[1:19:10] emotion I preach that to you many times
[1:19:13] but how can you get in the presence of a
[1:19:16] supernatural miracle-working God and sit
[1:19:18] there like a bump on a log
[1:19:21] yeah are you with me now how can you do
[1:19:23] it yeah
[1:19:26] yeah there's got to be something when
[1:19:28] water is wet yeah when they come out of
[1:19:31] the upper room let me say this with all
[1:19:32] of you all the authority that I can
[1:19:34] muster according to a Vindicated Prophet
[1:19:37] they weren't out shaking hands on the
[1:19:38] parking lot but they were staggering
[1:19:40] like drunk men and the people said well
[1:19:43] they've drunk new wine and he said no
[1:19:45] they haven't they're drunk of the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost this is that that was promised
[1:19:50] you can't get in water without being wet
[1:19:53] you can't face god without it changing
[1:19:56] you
[1:19:57] look what it did for Moses who saw God
[1:19:59] just the hindered part of God and it
[1:20:01] veiled him in glory
[1:20:05] changed him
[1:20:06] when he met the pillar of fire it
[1:20:09] changed his appearance what has it done
[1:20:11] for you and I it's done the same thing
[1:20:14] may not have changed the outside of this
[1:20:16] flesh that much although it it usually
[1:20:18] does
[1:20:19] it may not have changed the maybe the
[1:20:21] form of your face
[1:20:23] but it changed you on the inside
[1:20:26] something happened
[1:20:28] he said but brother Ben I'm not where I
[1:20:31] want to be but you're not where you used
[1:20:32] to be
[1:20:33] you were in the water and you got wet
[1:20:35] yeah
[1:20:36] you were in the wind and you felt the
[1:20:39] force of the wind blowing you can't be
[1:20:41] in the wind without it blowing you can't
[1:20:43] get in the water without being wet
[1:20:46] so that's the chemical of it is wet when
[1:20:48] you get in water you're going to get wet
[1:20:50] and when you get in the presence of God
[1:20:51] the supernatural there is going to be
[1:20:53] Supernatural signs and Supernatural
[1:20:55] workings of a supernatural God
[1:20:58] you're not going to keep doing what you
[1:21:00] always do I say we should strive for a
[1:21:03] supernatural God to be present in every
[1:21:05] one of our services why because we need
[1:21:07] him we need him we need him we can't do
[1:21:10] it without him how dare we go without
[1:21:12] him like Moses said he said thy presence
[1:21:14] he said my presence will go before you
[1:21:16] he said if it doesn't go don't let me go
[1:21:18] we don't want to go without your
[1:21:20] presence we can't do it without you yeah
[1:21:25] yeah verse 14 judges 6 14 the Lord
[1:21:27] looked upon him
[1:21:29] and said go in this thy might
[1:21:31] and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
[1:21:33] of the midianites have not I sent thee
[1:21:37] and he said unto him oh my Lord
[1:21:39] where is shall I save Israel
[1:21:41] behold my family is poor in Manassa I am
[1:21:45] the least in my father's house
[1:21:47] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[1:21:50] be with thee Thou shalt Smite the
[1:21:52] midianites as one man
[1:21:54] and he said unto him if now I have found
[1:21:56] Grace in thy sight show me a sign that
[1:21:59] thou talkest with me
[1:22:01] I want to know that it's you Lord
[1:22:03] I think every service we ought to ask
[1:22:05] God the same thing if this is you Lord
[1:22:08] speaking to my heart if this is your
[1:22:10] word show me something Lord it don't
[1:22:12] have to be some some great thing but the
[1:22:15] Lord somehow make it real to me
[1:22:18] make it real to me make your word real I
[1:22:21] want a supernatural element to it
[1:22:24] Hallelujah show me a sign said depart
[1:22:26] not hints I pray thee until I come unto
[1:22:29] thee and bring forth my present and said
[1:22:31] it before thee
[1:22:33] he said I will tarry until Thou come
[1:22:34] again my brother Branham tells us it was
[1:22:36] probably two or three hours
[1:22:38] by the time Gideon came back but the
[1:22:41] Lord waited patiently
[1:22:44] well Gideon got down at the altar
[1:22:47] and went to work
[1:22:50] see Gideon didn't get down at the altar
[1:22:52] to get something yeah Gideon got down at
[1:22:55] the altar to get a sacrifice ready to
[1:22:58] present to God
[1:23:00] something that could be consumed
[1:23:04] Gideon went in made ready a kid
[1:23:06] unleavened cakes of an IFA of flower and
[1:23:09] the flesh you put in a basket you put
[1:23:11] the broth in a pot brought it out into
[1:23:13] him under the Oak and presented it
[1:23:15] many times people are waiting on God
[1:23:17] God's waiting on you
[1:23:20] to make a sacrifice start showing up in
[1:23:23] church
[1:23:24] start doing the hard stuff I know we
[1:23:27] harp on those things but churches so
[1:23:28] it's the elementary it's a little stuff
[1:23:30] he wants us to start giving of ourselves
[1:23:33] not sit there and wait oh God I know
[1:23:35] you're Supernatural God so I'll sit here
[1:23:36] and wait on you no Gideon said if you're
[1:23:38] a supernatural God if I do my part I
[1:23:41] know you'll do your part
[1:23:44] yes so he brought the sacrifice he
[1:23:47] brought it under the Oak and presented
[1:23:48] it when he got done at the altar the
[1:23:52] angel was still there
[1:23:54] he waited on him
[1:23:56] and the angel of God said unto him
[1:23:59] take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes
[1:24:01] lay them Upon This Rock pour out the
[1:24:04] broth and he did so
[1:24:06] and then the angel of the Lord put forth
[1:24:08] the end of the staff that was in his
[1:24:09] hand and touched the Flesh and the
[1:24:11] unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire
[1:24:14] out of the Rock
[1:24:15] I love I love how God works Supernatural
[1:24:19] There Rose up fire out of the rock
[1:24:21] Gideon didn't have to Kindle it he
[1:24:24] didn't have to work it up
[1:24:26] he didn't have to sing for search songs
[1:24:28] are you with me now he didn't have to
[1:24:30] worry well you know if we don't have a
[1:24:32] certain preacher we can't have Revival
[1:24:33] we don't have certain songs we can't
[1:24:35] ever Revival no Gideon knew that if he
[1:24:37] was a supernatural God God could come
[1:24:39] out of a dry Rock
[1:24:41] fire would come out of a drive oh God
[1:24:44] that he would give us on Wednesday night
[1:24:45] that this would be that rough that he
[1:24:47] could bring out of that rock some fire
[1:24:52] because we need it
[1:24:54] but what was the purpose of the fire
[1:24:57] to consume the flesh
[1:25:05] this is what's lacking
[1:25:07] this is what's lacking in me
[1:25:10] this is what's lacking in you yeah
[1:25:13] I'm just being honest with you we're
[1:25:15] children of God we're predestined
[1:25:16] children of God we're going to make it
[1:25:18] we believe that tonight
[1:25:20] but if we want to live a Victorious life
[1:25:23] and I know that you do because you are
[1:25:25] predestined children of God
[1:25:27] you need to let him consume the flesh
[1:25:30] consume it
[1:25:33] until you can be smote on one's cheek
[1:25:35] and turn the other one
[1:25:38] consume it until the carnality is gone
[1:25:41] and you don't care what position you
[1:25:43] feel in the church you just want to be a
[1:25:44] help
[1:25:46] consume it until everything is burned
[1:25:48] out
[1:25:51] are you with Me Now consume it until you
[1:25:54] know you say I don't care if I'm the
[1:25:55] pastor if you move Lord I'm going to
[1:25:58] move

[1:26:02] something that makes tears come out of
[1:26:04] my face I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to
[1:26:06] you Lord
[1:26:08] if there's a place something that needs
[1:26:10] to be done in the church is there some
[1:26:11] position needs to be filled if it's just
[1:26:13] me raising my hands and worshiping on a
[1:26:15] Wednesday night let me do it Lord
[1:26:19] till you make promises you can keep
[1:26:24] consumed until the old man is dead
[1:26:30] okay old story I think I've told you
[1:26:32] before but the man the old Holiness
[1:26:34] preacher and the man
[1:26:36] was said he was entirely Sanctified as
[1:26:38] what they called it back there and
[1:26:40] entirely Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:26:42] Ghost and and they found he caught him
[1:26:44] stealing watermelons
[1:26:46] he said I thought you died the other
[1:26:47] night at the altar he said I did he said
[1:26:49] never seen a dead man steal watermelon
[1:26:53] the truth
[1:26:55] Paul said I died daily
[1:26:59] sanctification is an ongoing process but
[1:27:02] something the message of the hour taught
[1:27:03] us you don't quit striving for
[1:27:05] sanctification after you receive the
[1:27:07] Holy Ghost it just gives you the ability
[1:27:09] to remain Sanctified if you stay under
[1:27:12] the influence of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:14] but you don't quit striving for
[1:27:16] sanctification I say God help me today
[1:27:18] and that's more than just how you dress
[1:27:20] y'all dress good I'm so happy to have a
[1:27:23] group of people that that dress well and
[1:27:25] act one present themselves well but
[1:27:27] that's not all of it it's our attitudes
[1:27:30] towards one another it's how we treat
[1:27:32] strangers
[1:27:34] it's how we react to other people in the
[1:27:37] church
[1:27:38] you want to know if you're dead let
[1:27:39] somebody start poking you real good
[1:27:44] you know take a a cow you know Abraham
[1:27:47] offered a cow on the altar a
[1:27:49] two-year-old heifer and one of the ways
[1:27:52] you know if a cow is alive if you touch
[1:27:54] it there's a tender spot behind their
[1:27:56] leg if you touch that tender spot
[1:27:58] they'll kick
[1:28:00] huh
[1:28:01] boy got quiet
[1:28:03] you want to know if you're dead As Dead
[1:28:05] As you should be let somebody touch that
[1:28:07] tender spot
[1:28:11] see if you're dead yet or not
[1:28:14] I didn't plan on going this direction
[1:28:16] let's see if we're dead yet or not
[1:28:18] somebody take that cattle prod and just
[1:28:20] poke that tender spot
[1:28:23] oh you saw something that you didn't see
[1:28:26] before and then what do you do you go
[1:28:28] back and ask God God consume
[1:28:31] do a supernatural work I can't do it on
[1:28:34] my own
[1:28:35] my own some of you have been through
[1:28:36] horrible things you've seen preachers do
[1:28:39] horrible things you've seen you've seen
[1:28:40] people fall away you've gotten jaded
[1:28:42] against message people maybe because of
[1:28:44] the things that have went on and you get
[1:28:46] to the point where you don't even you
[1:28:47] don't even really like to be identified
[1:28:48] with the message because you've seen so
[1:28:50] much nonsense but be careful there's got
[1:28:53] to be a moment in your life where you
[1:28:55] sell out to the message of the hour you
[1:28:58] sell out to the word of the hour until
[1:29:00] they can poke that tendered spot where
[1:29:02] you've been hurt over and over again and
[1:29:04] you still lift your hands and say God
[1:29:05] you're still God this message is still
[1:29:08] true
[1:29:09] no matter what everybody else did
[1:29:12] [Applause]
[1:29:15] right it rolls up fire out of the Rock
[1:29:16] and consumed the Fletch
[1:29:18] and the unleaven
[1:29:20] Branham taught us that the greatest
[1:29:22] miracle was the new birth how many know
[1:29:24] he taught that over and over again
[1:29:27] so if God if there's a worker of
[1:29:28] Miracles I believe that's Christ today
[1:29:31] but if there's a gift of working in
[1:29:33] Miracles and there's got to be a new
[1:29:35] birth taking place because that's the
[1:29:37] greatest miracle
[1:29:40] brother Branch that's the one I talked
[1:29:41] of this morning when you lay your soul
[1:29:43] that morning he preached you must be
[1:29:45] born again
[1:29:47] he said when you lay your soul upon his
[1:29:49] brass altar of judgment what takes place
[1:29:51] if he's the same God he'll take the
[1:29:54] sacrifice
[1:29:56] you've offered it in sincerity upon his
[1:29:58] altar
[1:29:59] he'll consume that sacrifice and the
[1:30:02] world will be gone out of you just the
[1:30:05] smoke will fall away the sacrifice will
[1:30:07] be gone if you be God and you are the
[1:30:11] god of the Bible look where he takes
[1:30:16] he doesn't take it well if you really
[1:30:18] get down to business with God you have
[1:30:19] great Miracles and signs and wonders
[1:30:21] that's not where he takes it he said if
[1:30:24] you really get down the business of God
[1:30:25] and say God where are the Miracles he'll
[1:30:27] consume you
[1:30:29] can't do Miracles through you until he
[1:30:32] consumes you
[1:30:33] right and that in itself is the greatest
[1:30:35] miracle
[1:30:38] said if you be God you're the god of our
[1:30:41] Bibles our our fathers tell that before
[1:30:43] Miracles let me see you perform a
[1:30:44] miracle let me see some sort of miracle
[1:30:46] that I know God has met with me
[1:30:49] he said now may I say this if God Still
[1:30:50] Remains God if God is the same God he
[1:30:52] was in the days gone by you don't have
[1:30:54] to go up and shake hands with the
[1:30:55] preacher you don't have to go up and put
[1:30:58] your name on a book them things are all
[1:30:59] right nothing against it he explains how
[1:31:01] church members act going back and forth
[1:31:03] Pillar To Post he said if God remains
[1:31:05] God lay your sinful so on his Altar and
[1:31:08] he'll touch you with his word and his
[1:31:10] power and the world will be gone from
[1:31:12] you you'll be a new Creature if he
[1:31:14] remains God you believe he's still God
[1:31:16] tonight he was God of the Old Testament
[1:31:19] he was God of the New Testament he's the
[1:31:21] same God today yesterday today and
[1:31:23] forever and you know then down in your
[1:31:25] heart that a supernatural work has been
[1:31:28] done by a supernatural being when you
[1:31:30] want strength and smoked and lied and
[1:31:32] you women love the world so much you
[1:31:34] kept wearing your makeup and your short
[1:31:35] hair and doing other things you did and
[1:31:37] you find out that something happens all
[1:31:39] the devils in Hell couldn't make you do
[1:31:41] it again something happened a god of
[1:31:43] Miracles performed
[1:31:46] glory to God
[1:31:48] what did he do he changed your vile
[1:31:49] heart
[1:31:50] change your desires change your nature a
[1:31:53] supernatural word by a supernatural God
[1:31:56] made a creature of time to a creature of
[1:31:59] Eternity
[1:32:01] took the world out of you and put Christ
[1:32:04] in you the hope of glory and you're
[1:32:05] filled with the spirit ready to meet him
[1:32:07] if God be God where is his miracles if
[1:32:10] God is with us where is his miracles he
[1:32:12] said if God's with the Methodist Church
[1:32:14] why is all the women still wearing
[1:32:15] bobbed hair
[1:32:16] if God's with the Baptist Church was a
[1:32:18] pastor still smokes cigarettes many of
[1:32:20] them he said why do they still deny the
[1:32:22] power of God to heal the sick to raise
[1:32:24] the dead to speak in tongues
[1:32:25] interpretations Gifts of Prophecy why do
[1:32:27] they still deny it if the god of the Old
[1:32:29] Testament god of the New Testament is
[1:32:30] still the same God if the god of the New
[1:32:33] Testament the Holy Ghost is still the
[1:32:34] god Pentecostals claim oh now we're
[1:32:37] going to get down to the nitty-gritty
[1:32:38] before we go he said if he's still the
[1:32:41] god the Pentecostals claim why don't
[1:32:43] they break down their walls of petition
[1:32:45] and fussing at one another
[1:32:48] and become Born Again Christians
[1:32:53] you realize
[1:32:54] I know I'm talking about I've been to a
[1:32:56] lot of places in my life in a short few
[1:32:58] years
[1:33:00] I've been around a lot
[1:33:01] most people only go to One Church ever
[1:33:05] and some of them only ever hear one
[1:33:06] preacher
[1:33:08] and if that one preacher fails they're
[1:33:10] gone
[1:33:11] that one Church closes or no more
[1:33:13] because their whole religion is that
[1:33:17] and they're taught not to even speak to
[1:33:20] anybody else
[1:33:22] brother Brandon said if
[1:33:24] if God is still the god of Miracles you
[1:33:26] believe he is tonight
[1:33:28] why don't you break down those walls of
[1:33:30] protection
[1:33:32] that'd be a miracle in hearty wouldn't
[1:33:34] it
[1:33:36] fussing at one another
[1:33:37] become Born Again Christians
[1:33:41] said sure no one one won't even speak to
[1:33:44] the other one see the sacrifice hasn't
[1:33:46] been consumed
[1:33:48] they go through Sensations he said
[1:33:50] they've done that all their also the
[1:33:51] ages under Idols they've done Sensations
[1:33:53] but the god of the Bible That's the God
[1:33:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:57] burns up the world and all the
[1:34:00] difference
[1:34:01] makes us new creatures in Christ
[1:34:05] say brother Ben I don't like that very
[1:34:06] much I didn't say it
[1:34:10] remember that Prophet we talked about
[1:34:13] remember that Christ that came down in
[1:34:16] our age not the man but the word
[1:34:20] through opening of the word the
[1:34:22] revealing of the word
[1:34:24] taught us to tear down the walls of
[1:34:26] petition
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:30] Jesus said these testify and tell you
[1:34:32] who I am what the works that I do
[1:34:36] because I serve a god of Miracles
[1:34:39] I want us to look as we're closing it
[1:34:41] Gideon's response to this miracle
[1:34:43] working God
[1:34:45] judges 6 22 when Gideon perceived that
[1:34:49] he he was an angel of the Lord
[1:34:52] Capital Lord
[1:34:54] Gideon said alas O Lord God
[1:34:58] because I've seen an angel or theophany
[1:35:00] of the Lord face to face
[1:35:03] and the Lord said unto him peace be unto
[1:35:06] thee
[1:35:07] fear not Thou shalt not die
[1:35:11] you realize what this message is
[1:35:13] and what that Supernatural power is
[1:35:15] that's been talking to you it's been
[1:35:17] working in your life
[1:35:19] he said I I might I'll die he said Don't
[1:35:22] Fear thou shall not die then Gideon
[1:35:25] built an altar there unto the Lord and
[1:35:27] called it Jehovah shalom
[1:35:30] I love this
[1:35:32] Jehovah's shalom
[1:35:34] not Jehovah the one who brings confusion
[1:35:37] not Jehovah the one who who brings all
[1:35:40] kinds of differences and of opinions and
[1:35:43] and Jehovah the one who caused all kinds
[1:35:45] of problems but Jehovah shalom
[1:35:48] now when you come to this Jehovah Shalom
[1:35:49] it may separate you from all kinds of
[1:35:51] things but it won't separate you from
[1:35:53] the word
[1:35:54] and it won't separate you from God's
[1:35:56] people
[1:35:58] you you come at a place of peace
[1:36:01] he said Jehovah Shalom Yahweh is peace
[1:36:06] Yahweh is peace
[1:36:09] Brandon picks up on this he said the sun
[1:36:12] is always Shining
[1:36:14] the only thing that keeps us from seeing
[1:36:16] it is the clouds
[1:36:18] and this is what he's saying about
[1:36:19] miracles it's important about miracles
[1:36:21] it's they're there
[1:36:22] we serve a Jehovah of Miracles Gideon
[1:36:26] served the Jehovah of Miracles
[1:36:29] and if we're willing to step out in
[1:36:30] faith there you'll see miracles happen
[1:36:32] yes yes but what keeps us from seeing it
[1:36:35] is the clouds right he said take the
[1:36:38] clouds away what happens the sun is
[1:36:41] right there the only thing you have to
[1:36:43] do today musicians go ahead and come he
[1:36:46] said the only thing you have to do today
[1:36:47] say not oh Jesus come and heal me oh
[1:36:50] Jesus give me the Holy Ghost
[1:36:52] just take the clouds away
[1:36:56] he's already there
[1:37:00] he said God give me a great gift show me
[1:37:02] this great gift show me what I'm
[1:37:03] supposed to do just let the clouds go
[1:37:05] away
[1:37:06] you got the doubt go away let the fear
[1:37:09] go away that thing that you're doing
[1:37:11] that you know is wrong stop doing it let
[1:37:13] the power of God begin to work in your
[1:37:15] life
[1:37:17] let the clouds go away
[1:37:19] he's already there
[1:37:21] would you bow your heads with me
[1:37:26] maybe you got clouds in your life we all
[1:37:28] do at times
[1:37:29] or sunny days there's cloudy days
[1:37:32] there's days when you you don't feel
[1:37:33] good
[1:37:34] you don't feel like a Christian you
[1:37:36] don't you don't feel like a a servant a
[1:37:40] child of a miracle working God

[1:37:44] and yet you know that he is
[1:37:46] something inside of you knows that he is
[1:37:50] foreign

[1:38:57] forget what a prophet of God in our day
[1:38:59] he come and preached a message about
[1:39:01] pride and about Jesus sitting here with
[1:39:03] unwashed feet and he said they had lots
[1:39:05] of good things to do
[1:39:06] they were busy with church problems busy
[1:39:09] with churchanity and they forgot to
[1:39:12] welcome Christ who sit in the corner
