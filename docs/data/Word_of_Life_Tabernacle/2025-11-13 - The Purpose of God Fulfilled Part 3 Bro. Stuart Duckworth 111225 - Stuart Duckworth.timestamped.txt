[11:31] of God.
[11:33] I've [music] been washed
[11:35] in the [singing] fountain.
[11:38] We are cleansed by [music]
[11:41] his blood.
[11:44] We're joiners
[11:46] with Jesus
[11:48] as we travel [singing]
[11:51] this song.
[11:53] For I'm part
[11:56] of the family,
[11:59] the family [singing]
[12:01] of God.
[12:04] How many's happy to be in the house of
[12:06] the Lord tonight? Can you give the Lord
[12:07] a hand clap of praise? By and by when
[12:10] the morning comes. [applause]
[12:12] Well, by and by, oh, when [singing] the

[12:27] how we've overcome or we'll understand
[12:30] [singing] it better by and by.
[12:34] Well, we are often tossed [singing] and
[12:36] driven on the restless sea of [music]
[12:39] time. Summer skies and howling tempest
[12:43] off [singing] succeeded a bright
[12:45] sunshine in that land with perfect day.
[12:49] With the [singing] mish have rolled
[12:50] away, we will understand [music]
[12:53] it better. By and by,
[12:57] we're singing [music] by and by. Oh,

[13:17] by.
[13:19] We are often destitute of the things
[13:23] [singing and music] that life demands.
[13:25] one of food and one of shelter. Thirsty
[13:28] [singing and music] hills and barren
[13:30] lands, but we're trusting in the Lord.
[13:34] And according to his word, we will
[13:37] understand it better. By and by,

[14:45] understand [singing]
[14:46] it better by and by.
[14:49] Oh, temptations, hidden snares of ought
[14:53] to take us [singing] unawares. And our
[14:56] hearts [music] are made to bleed from
[14:58] any a thoughtless word or deed. And we
[15:02] wonder why the test when we try to do
[15:05] our best, but we'll [singing and music]
[15:07] understand it better by and by.
[15:12] Well, children by and by. Oh, when
[15:16] [music] the morning comes, when all the
[15:20] saints of God are gathered home, we will

[35:22] Amen. You love God tonight.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; You love one another.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Try not to hold you too
[35:30] long tonight. We'll just turn in the
[35:31] scriptures um to Daniel 3.
[35:36] Daniel 3 and 1.
[35:48] Some of my family's home sick, so I I
[35:50] drove up here by myself tonight. It's
[35:52] kind of lonely,
[35:55] but here we are.
[35:59] Man,
[36:01] try not to put anybody to sleep tonight
[36:03] either.
[36:04] So,
[36:07] you love God.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel 3:1
[36:12] just kind of the fulfilled purpose of
[36:14] God kind of continued that thought.
[36:18] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[36:20] gold whose height was three score cubits
[36:23] and the breadth thereof six cubits and
[36:26] he set it up in the plain of Jura in the
[36:28] province of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar
[36:31] the king sent together
[36:35] the princes, the governors, and the
[36:37] captains, the judges, the treasures, the
[36:39] counselors, the sheriffs, and all the
[36:41] rulers of the provinces to come to the
[36:44] dedication of the image which
[36:46] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Oh
[36:50] my, what a dedication.
[36:53] Then the princes, the governors, the
[36:55] captains, the judges, the treasures, the
[36:57] c counselors, the sheriffs, and the
[36:59] rulers of the provinces were gathered
[37:00] together unto the dedication of the
[37:03] image of Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
[37:05] up. And they stood before the image that
[37:09] Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Amen. You can
[37:12] be seated tonight.
[37:16] try not to hold you too long,
[37:20] but just imagine for a moment they're
[37:24] looking at this image like what in the
[37:27] world is this?
[37:29] But all these princes and governors and
[37:31] these rulers looking looking at this
[37:33] image,
[37:35] you know, they're sitting there all all
[37:37] the great great people, all the all the
[37:40] great counselors and and people of
[37:42] position there and and is that who we
[37:46] think it is?
[37:49] They look over and maybe Daniel's
[37:51] standing on on the far end down there
[37:53] and he's like, I don't know, guys. I
[37:55] don't know about this, you know, but and
[37:59] they're they're just like, is that that
[38:02] guy right there?
[38:04] &gt;&gt; But it was a look of confusion.
[38:07] And that's what Babylon causes. That's
[38:10] what Babylon is. It come from the tower
[38:13] of Babel and Nimrod.
[38:16] And Babylon is the spirit of confusion.
[38:19] The spirit of Babylon is the spirit of
[38:22] confusion.
[38:23] And brother Brandham says here in
[38:25] questions and answer on the seals he
[38:26] said remember in the time of Babylon and
[38:29] Nebuchadnezzar when the gentile kingdom
[38:31] was issued in. See when gentile kingdom
[38:34] issued in it come in by the worship of a
[38:36] man. And Nebuchadnezzar made a statue of
[38:39] a man. And if you've got a spiritual
[38:41] mind, he said, "Now listen to this
[38:43] revelation."
[38:45] That spirit, that man that he made an
[38:47] image of by his revelation
[38:50] &gt;&gt; was Daniel, a religious man being
[38:54] worshiped. See it? Because his name was
[38:56] Belt Shazar, which was the name of his
[38:59] God. And listen to this. And he made an
[39:01] image of that God, which was the image
[39:04] of Daniel. And he said, "And Daniel
[39:06] refused to bow to his own image." Amen.
[39:11] And we look here. Why was the why was
[39:13] the king so impressed with Daniel? What
[39:15] what did the prophet Daniel do? But the
[39:18] king had a dream. And in this dream, he
[39:21] was troubled. The Bible says in spirit
[39:24] and his sleep broke from him. The Bible
[39:27] says he was so troubled by this dream
[39:31] that he called all the magicians.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and astrologers and sorcerers and
[39:36] the Chaldans to come and give him an
[39:39] answer about his dream.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; And they said
[39:44] these astrologers, these sorcers, these
[39:48] supposed to be the smart people that
[39:49] that can figure things out. They said,
[39:51] "Tell us a dream and we'll tell you the
[39:54] interpretation." But that didn't work
[39:57] for the king, for he knew they would
[39:59] they would lie to him. But the king told
[40:02] them, he said, "The dream has gone from
[40:05] me."
[40:06] &gt;&gt; But he wanted them to tell me. He said,
[40:08] "Tell me both the dream and the
[40:10] interpretation."
[40:12] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that none, Amen, was
[40:14] able. And they they saidnone would be
[40:17] able to do there's none of us that would
[40:19] be able to do such a thing to be able to
[40:20] tell you not only an interpretation, but
[40:23] to tell you the dream also.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. None was able to do such a thing.
[40:28] And there went a decree. Amen. that all
[40:31] the wise men would be destroyed. So
[40:34] there Daniel listening to this and him
[40:37] being a part of these wise men and and
[40:39] and so on. But Daniel desired the Bible
[40:42] says an opportunity to give an answer to
[40:45] the king. Amen. As this as this man was
[40:48] sent out, Amen. And the the decree of a
[40:50] king, whatever his word word was, Amen.
[40:55] it was to be. Amen. So let it be written
[40:58] and so let it be done. If a if a king
[41:00] speaks a word, if he gives out a
[41:02] commandment, it must go forth and it
[41:04] must be carried out. And here this man
[41:06] was going to carry out to begin to
[41:09] destroy and to kill these wise men
[41:11] because it was the decree of the king.
[41:13] But Daniel overheard this and he said,
[41:15] "Now hold up a minute. Hold up a minute.
[41:18] Give me a little bit of time and let me
[41:21] see if I can go in and get the king an
[41:24] answer."
[41:26] And there the Bible says, "And and
[41:28] there, Amen. and and he went in, Amen,
[41:32] in prayer to get an answer for the
[41:35] king." And he desired prayer. He desired
[41:38] mercy that the God of heaven would show
[41:40] him both the dream and the
[41:42] interpretation.
[41:45] Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And there Daniel, he explained. We know,
[41:50] we know that God showed him because
[41:52] that's God's prophet. God showed him,
[41:54] Amen. the dream. He showed them the
[41:56] interpretation what what the king what
[41:58] had gone from his mind God coming and
[42:01] through his prophet Amen revealed the
[42:04] entirety of the thing and Daniel began
[42:06] to explain what he saw and he said thou
[42:09] king art this head of gold
[42:12] and so on and down and and be to
[42:15] describe the the body and the different
[42:17] parts of it and he come on down to the
[42:19] feet of iron and clay and and there in
[42:22] Daniel 2:34 and he said and and thou
[42:24] Thou saw a seal of stone was cut out
[42:28] without hands, which smoked the image
[42:31] &gt;&gt; upon the feet that were of iron and
[42:34] clay, and it break them to pieces.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; And and brother said, Daniel's seen the
[42:39] beginning of that gentile rule. He's
[42:42] seen the beginning of that gentile rule
[42:44] on down to this very day that you and I
[42:47] live in. He's seen on down, amen, the
[42:50] beginning of the gentile kingdom. And
[42:52] he's seen on down to the very end. And
[42:54] he seen, amen, at the very end, he seen
[42:57] a rock that was cut out of the mountain
[42:59] without hands that would break, that
[43:01] would destroy this gentile kingdom. What
[43:04] did Daniel see? He seen, amen, not just
[43:06] the end of a kingdom, but he seen the
[43:09] day of the Lord. He was caught up and he
[43:11] he come on down to the very end. Amen.
[43:14] When man's day would end, when man's day
[43:17] would end and be crushed by this stone,
[43:19] preach with me tonight. Amen. It would
[43:22] be crushed by this stone. Amen. That was
[43:24] cut out of the mountain without hands.
[43:26] Amen. Man didn't have nothing to do with
[43:29] it. And this is what would come down at
[43:31] the very end and destroy the kingdoms of
[43:34] man. All the other kingdoms. Amen.
[43:37] Everything at the very end. Every
[43:38] denomination, every system would come
[43:41] down and this stone would destroy every
[43:43] bit of that. And this kingdom, amen,
[43:46] would be set up by the God of heaven. It
[43:49] would be set up, amen, not by man or
[43:51] man's idea, but it would be set up by
[43:53] the God of heaven and it would stand
[43:56] forever. And amen, it would never be
[43:58] destroyed. The Bible says, Amen. that it
[44:00] would stand forever.
[44:04] [snorts]
[44:06] &gt;&gt; I hate to know what I look like while
[44:07] I'm preaching.
[44:10] And I apologize,
[44:16] but the prophet of God said that stone
[44:19] was Jesus Christ.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Daniel saw Jesus.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; He saw Jesus Christ. He caught a vision
[44:28] of that.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Reyn said it was the stone
[44:32] that the builders rejected.
[44:35] And that and and the Bible says in that
[44:37] same the the the stone that the builders
[44:40] rejected that same becomes the head of
[44:43] the body. It's that stone, brother Bram
[44:46] said that caps off the pyramid. And what
[44:49] is the pyramid? Amen. It's the stature
[44:52] of a perfect man. What did the pyramid?
[44:54] What did it type out? It was the stature
[44:57] of a perfect man. It was the building
[45:00] up, Amen. And it it was the building up,
[45:02] amen, of the of of the children of God,
[45:04] of the sons and daughters of God.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that that stone was to come
[45:08] and cap off the pyramid of you and I.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The stature of a perfect man.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that stone that Daniel
[45:18] seen? It is the headship of Christ.
[45:23] Yeah,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; it's some mighty angel coming down to
[45:27] identify and to bring the mind of Christ
[45:30] into the body.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the Lord's day when the
[45:35] stone comes down. Amen. It is the
[45:38] seventh seal. It is the coming of the
[45:40] Lord. Amen. When man's day is over,
[45:43] amen. When denomination is over, the
[45:45] Bible says, Amen. It comes in a time
[45:47] when time is no longer. And brother
[45:49] said, Amen. What does that mean? And he
[45:51] said, "Time has run out for man. Time
[45:53] has run out for denomination." What is
[45:55] it? It's the Lord's day. Amen. It's the
[45:58] Lord's day when he comes upon the scene.
[46:01] Everything else passes away. Amen. When
[46:03] the Lord comes on the scene. Amen. Amen.
[46:06] And this is the Lord's day that you and
[46:08] I live in. Amen. When he fully comes, he
[46:11] will come in judgment. Amen. But when he
[46:13] comes to you and I, it is in mercy.
[46:16] Amen. It is a help. It's a strength.
[46:18] It's a supernatural strength. It's a
[46:20] supernatural pouring out. Amen. It's no
[46:23] longer Amen. about a man, but it's about
[46:25] the Lord.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the Lord's day.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him have his way
[46:36] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Let him have his way in your need.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Don't fear.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. For I am alive. Amen. Now I am he
[46:47] that was dead and behold I am alive
[46:49] forever more. Amen. When Jesus rose
[46:52] again. Amen. That was the Lord's day.
[46:55] Man put him in the tomb. Come on Jonah.
[46:57] Amen. Man put him in the tomb. Amen. But
[47:00] the Lord's day came. Amen. And a
[47:02] resurrection took place.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; The Lord's day. It is the day of his
[47:11] power.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; It is the day of his authority
[47:14] &gt;&gt; identified in a bride body. That stone,
[47:18] &gt;&gt; that stone, amen, that caps off the
[47:20] bride, that caps off you and I, that
[47:22] headship that is identified. Amen. Amen.
[47:24] It comes in a bride body that is upon
[47:27] the earth.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it tonight? What is it?
[47:31] It's your everything.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; It's your everything. When it crushes
[47:35] everything else, Amen. And when it
[47:37] destroys everything else, it brings you
[47:40] victory. It brings you joy unspeakable
[47:43] and full of glory. It brings you faith.
[47:45] It brings you healing. It brings the
[47:47] resurrection quickening power in your
[47:50] body. It's everything to you.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan's had his way, amen, with
[47:55] our lives. Amen. He could only have his
[47:58] way. I'm going to lose my voice. He
[47:59] could only have his way for a short
[48:01] period of time. Amen. But when the Lord
[48:03] come on the scene, Amen. Amen. God be to
[48:06] have his way. And it brought a
[48:08] quickening power. Amen. It is your
[48:10] everything in this hour. That headship,
[48:13] that stone that Daniel seen is your
[48:15] everything. It is your body change.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; It is the rapture to you and I. It's
[48:20] faith enough for the rapture.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord's day.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; The 17th week of Daniel,
[48:30] but the true church all over the world
[48:31] has shaped down.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. through all the ages to a place
[48:37] that there's come a ministry among us
[48:39] just exactly like the ministry of Jesus
[48:42] Christ. That's what it took in this
[48:44] hour.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall ye do also.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; The day when the son of man is revealed.
[48:51] Amen. Jesus couldn't come back to do
[48:53] that. He had to work through his body.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And a ministry come among us. Amen. to
[49:00] unite us not with itself but to unite
[49:04] the bridegroom and the bride. That was
[49:07] the purpose of this ministry. Amen. And
[49:09] then and it come down through the ages
[49:11] and it and God through Luther and Wesley
[49:13] and Pentecost and on down. Amen. We're
[49:16] we're honing down. We're honing down and
[49:19] it's getting tighter. It's getting
[49:20] closer. Amen. But it had it had to come
[49:23] to that place. Amen. For a ministry. It
[49:26] took a ministry to bring us to to that
[49:28] place where this headstone could come,
[49:31] where the Lord
[49:32] &gt;&gt; could have his day.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Good.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; He said it's just like the ministry of
[49:41] Jesus Christ.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; He said, now what they got? They got the
[49:45] thing in condition. Now what's the next
[49:47] thing? This rejected stone of the
[49:48] pyramid cut out of the mountain without
[49:50] what? Without hands. God sent it. Do you
[49:55] see it? The congregation says, "Amen."
[49:58] The rejected one. The rejected stone is
[50:01] the head of this. It's the head of the
[50:03] capstone. And the very one that they've
[50:05] rejected through the gentile age is
[50:07] Christ. And Christ was not cut and put
[50:10] out here in here as a valker or son of
[50:12] God. Listen to this. Or some great
[50:14] dignitarian in the church. He is the
[50:16] Holy Spirit.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the cap of the pyramid will be
[50:24] Christ coming.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? He said, "Hallelujah.
[50:28] What happened at that time? The coming
[50:30] of that stone up with the church in the
[50:32] glory."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of the stone, the
[50:35] coming of the headship identifies that
[50:38] the rapture is just close at hand.
[50:40] Church. Amen. The things that we've
[50:42] seen, the things that we've heard. Amen.
[50:44] It's to let you know who's here. It's to
[50:46] let you know, Amen. that that the day of
[50:49] man is over. that Satan's time is over.
[50:51] Amen. Amen. For a for a little bit of
[50:53] time here. For a little bit of time,
[50:56] when the word has been restored, God's
[50:58] got full access. God's got full Amen.
[51:01] He's got hearts that are open, amen, to
[51:03] his fullness that he can pour himself
[51:05] into that God can have his way with.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit. [panting]
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Quit waiting for something else to come.
[51:14] Quit waiting for something something
[51:16] greater to come down the road. He is
[51:19] here.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; The capstone is here. Amen. We We're
[51:23] We're We're not waiting for something.
[51:24] He's here. We're not waiting for another
[51:27] ministry to show up. Amen. Quit waiting
[51:29] on me to try to tell you something.
[51:31] Amen. Amen. To to to to get you worked
[51:33] up. Amen. What we've seen, what we've
[51:36] heard, what we've witnessed. Amen. What
[51:38] God has done for us is enough.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; And he is the Holy Spirit. I say tonight
[51:44] that God is not limited. Amen. But he is
[51:47] unlimited. I say tonight, amen. He is
[51:49] the absolute. He is the final say. He is
[51:52] our everything tonight. Amen. Amen. And
[51:55] he is here present.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:59] [snorts]
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Behold, I go away.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; But a comforter will come.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; The comforter is here tonight
[52:09] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said he would be. Jesus,
[52:12] if he was standing here in flesh, he
[52:14] could do no more for you than what he's
[52:16] already done. and the revealed word of
[52:18] the hour. Amen. That ministry brought us
[52:20] to to a vision. Amen. More than
[52:22] Lutheran, more than just being saved,
[52:24] more than just being clean, more than
[52:26] just gifts. Amen. But it brought us to a
[52:28] ministry. Amen. Where we become one with
[52:30] the word. [sighs]
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Quit putting it off somewhere else.
[52:42] He is the Holy Spirit
[52:44] &gt;&gt; and he's working through his word. Amen.
[52:47] To those that will believe him,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; those that will trust him, he will
[52:50] manifest himself to them if you can
[52:53] believe him. If you can trust him.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; How do we come to this place where the
[53:03] capstone can come? How do we come to
[53:06] this place where the headship can just
[53:08] take full control? And brother, brother
[53:10] Ben's preaching about adoption. And and
[53:12] I believe that that's this age. No other
[53:14] age could come to the place of adoption,
[53:17] a maturity because there was nothing
[53:18] there to mature them. There was not a
[53:21] there was not an open word there to
[53:23] mature them. And we we just you know
[53:24] that becomes just a term. Amen. But but
[53:27] it's the fullness of the word. It's the
[53:29] fullness of the effect. You understand?
[53:32] It's not a head knowledge. It's not a
[53:33] doctrine. But it's the effect. It's the
[53:36] Holy Spirit unleashed. Just like Satan
[53:39] wants to be unleashed on people's lives,
[53:41] the Holy Spirit wants to be unleashed on
[53:43] our lives to take the word and to
[53:45] manifest it through sons and daughters
[53:47] of God.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; But how do we get to that place? It
[53:51] takes some trials.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It takes some hardships.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; It takes some battles.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; It takes separation.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It takes shaving off. Yes, sir.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And judgment, the Bible says, begins at
[54:13] the house of God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So, as sons and daughters of God, if
[54:16] we're sons and daughters of God, God has
[54:19] to correct you.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; If if if we're his seed, he can't let us
[54:24] continue in error. He can't continue to
[54:26] to let us be uh uh uh doing things that
[54:29] are wrong.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And so, it takes the correction of the
[54:33] word.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Right. It takes the Holy Spirit. Hey
[54:38] now,
[54:40] &gt;&gt; quit doing that.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That little tug,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; you understand?
[54:46] &gt;&gt; More than sometimes more than a tug, it
[54:47] takes it takes some hard preaching.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; It takes some stern speaking, right?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; What would we really do if we heard hard
[54:57] preaching? Would we run off? Would we
[55:00] quit?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, we say, "Lord, Amen. shame me down.
[55:05] I want to be right. And that's the
[55:07] attitude of the believer. That's the
[55:09] attitude of a son or daughter of God
[55:11] that can take correction
[55:13] &gt;&gt; because they know it's for their good.
[55:14] They know it's from the father and they
[55:16] the father has their best interest.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; It takes some willingness to be cut to
[55:22] size.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be sticking out over
[55:25] here. And but the pyramid's coming up.
[55:28] It's honed in
[55:31] &gt;&gt; and the the capstone's got to come down
[55:33] on that. It can't come down here at the
[55:34] bottom. It wouldn't look right.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; So, it's got to be perfect.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; It's got to be perfect.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And only God can do that.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; You can't do it yourself.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; We can't perfect ourselves. So, it takes
[55:51] the word.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; It takes being subject to the word by
[55:55] the Holy Spirit. And without the Holy
[55:57] Spirit, you will never subject yourself
[55:59] to the word.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; It takes some growing up and maturing to
[56:06] be perfected and properly placed as sons
[56:10] and daughters of the living God. You
[56:12] know, and I like to act like a kid, you
[56:15] know. I'm almost 40 years old and I I I
[56:20] don't want to be 40 years old,
[56:23] but you know what? But the older you
[56:24] get, as time goes on, you know, you you
[56:28] got to be a man. And sometimes you just
[56:31] got to put yourself dead last, right?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to tell a sob story or
[56:37] nothing.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; But you got to as you grow up, you
[56:44] prioritize things the best you can. And
[56:48] it doesn't become about you, but it
[56:49] becomes about the ones around you,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; right? And so we mature. We we let
[56:54] things go
[56:56] &gt;&gt; and we move on to higher things, right?
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a higher place in Christ
[57:01] that I want to go to.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Higher than what I've been what I am
[57:06] today, what I was. I've been serving the
[57:08] Lord now for 20 years. 2005 October. God
[57:13] saved me. 20 years. And but if I haven't
[57:17] grown from that, what am I doing? What
[57:19] is the effect effectiveness? If this
[57:21] word is effective, what what am I doing?
[57:24] What are we doing here? But there's a
[57:26] higher plane. There's a higher calling.
[57:29] No matter how long you've been in the
[57:31] way, there's a maturing that we can come
[57:33] to. Even the prophet of God.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. A hunter.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; A hunter love to kill game. But there on
[57:41] the mountain when the snowstorm and you
[57:44] know what happened? He spoke to the
[57:45] storm. And there there that animal there
[57:47] presented itself. And amen. There there
[57:50] God said, "Won't you just walk with me?"
[57:53] Heaven, "Won't you just walk with me?"
[57:54] And he he couldn't even bring himself to
[57:56] kill that animal. Oh my. Such
[58:00] experiences.
[58:01] Amen. Where where it's not more so much
[58:04] of the earthly, but it's of the
[58:06] heavenly.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. To walk in that that atmosphere is
[58:10] what I long for.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I'm still going to kill a deer tomorrow
[58:13] if it walks out in the woods, though.
[58:15] [snorts]
[58:18] If I if I can
[58:20] &gt;&gt; if I don't miss. [snorts]
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Big buck, right?
[58:32] [clears throat]
[58:33] But it takes growing up. It takes
[58:34] maturing to be properly placed. But
[58:38] [clears throat] it it will be worth it
[58:39] in the in the end
[58:41] &gt;&gt; to purpose in your heart to serve God
[58:45] through all of that, through all the
[58:46] hardships, the trials, to to stay with
[58:49] it. Amen. To purpose it will be worth it
[58:52] in the end, to let the Lord have his
[58:55] way.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Daniel 2:46.
[58:59] And there Daniel interpreted the dream.
[59:03] But the Bible says, "And Neba, the king
[59:04] Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and
[59:06] worshiped Daniel and commanded that they
[59:09] should offer an oblation and sweet odors
[59:12] unto him." My guy's pretty messed up,
[59:14] isn't he? He don't know what's going on,
[59:17] man.
[59:21] But that's the world.
[59:23] But the pagan king, you imagine this, he
[59:25] was so troubled by his dreams, by by the
[59:28] by what he seen. He was so he was so
[59:31] troubled and Daniel revealed to him. But
[59:35] the pagan king no doubt was so relieved
[59:38] that he was free from this. He was so
[59:40] impressed by what he saw the display of
[59:43] the power of the one true God. So to
[59:46] reveal the secrets of the heart and
[59:48] there he made Daniel a ruler over the
[59:50] whole pro province of Babylon and put
[59:52] him over all these wise men. And there
[59:55] he made an image for worship.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; The image of this prophet
[1:00:00] And so here they're all looking at this
[1:00:02] image, standing there, man, confused,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; man. This is just this guy right over
[1:00:08] here. He ain't been here very long.
[1:00:09] We're going to make an image. We're
[1:00:11] going to worship him. But they're there
[1:00:14] in confusion. And all they can do and
[1:00:16] all the world can do is just take part.
[1:00:19] That's all they know how to do. All they
[1:00:22] know know how to do is just fall in
[1:00:24] line. Young people, the world, they all
[1:00:27] they know how to do is just to be led by
[1:00:29] by whoever else. Don't be led by whoever
[1:00:32] else. Be led by God.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Be led by by by somebody who's a
[1:00:38] Christian that you know is a Christian.
[1:00:40] Let that person influence your life.
[1:00:42] Don't let the world that will go after
[1:00:44] whatever whatever old spirit, whatever
[1:00:47] old evil thing, they'll they'll worship.
[1:00:48] They'll put whatever in front of them.
[1:00:50] Amen. Don't be influenced by that. Be
[1:00:53] influenced by real people of God. Amen.
[1:00:56] Amen. Listen to the prophet of God.
[1:00:58] Amen. Put that before you. Put the word
[1:01:01] before you. Amen. Tired about your Amen.
[1:01:04] Your bed post. Amen. Amen. Let it be
[1:01:06] anchored in your heart.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't partake of the confusion.
[1:01:12] Don't partake of the chaos because
[1:01:14] that's all that it is. That's all they
[1:01:16] know. That's all they know how to do.
[1:01:20] There was no life or power in the image
[1:01:23] of that man of God. He was a man of God,
[1:01:26] but there was no life in that image.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And as great as he was, there was no
[1:01:31] life. There was nothing behind him.
[1:01:33] Amen. And there's no real power in the
[1:01:35] relics, but in the God of Daniel, there
[1:01:38] was power. Amen. Amen. When when Elisha
[1:01:42] When Elijah went away, Amen. Elisha
[1:01:44] didn't say, "Amen. Elijah, come back."
[1:01:47] He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[1:01:50] Amen. He didn't cry for Elijah to come
[1:01:52] back. Elijah had fulfilled his purpose.
[1:01:54] Amen. But Elisha said, "Amen. I want a
[1:01:57] double portion." Amen. I I don't want to
[1:01:59] I don't just want to be like the man.
[1:02:01] Amen. I want the spirit of God that was
[1:02:04] on the man to come back upon me. Amen.
[1:02:06] And give me a double portion. Amen.
[1:02:08] Don't cut yourself short here tonight.
[1:02:10] He is the Holy Spirit. He is our
[1:02:13] portion. Amen. And our portion is more
[1:02:15] than it's ever been to any age it's ever
[1:02:18] been. Amen. Call out to God. He is
[1:02:20] available tonight. He is available.
[1:02:23] Amen. Amen. For power. Amen. For for
[1:02:26] glory. Amen. He is here tonight. He is
[1:02:28] available.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [snorts]
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of God, it was more than
[1:02:36] an image that God put on display,
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; but God worked through Daniel. Amen. And
[1:02:43] it's it's more than some picture or some
[1:02:46] image. Amen. Today, it's more than some
[1:02:48] mental conception. But there's a real
[1:02:51] true and living God on the throne
[1:02:54] tonight.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And by faith, if you can catch a vision
[1:02:58] and believe from the heart, he can be
[1:03:00] made known.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; It's more than a mental conception.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; There's a literal, Brother Ram said,
[1:03:07] there's a literal Jesus Christ on the
[1:03:10] throne tonight.
[1:03:12] There's a that that body is he said that
[1:03:14] body is somewhere.
[1:03:16] That body is somewhere. That person is
[1:03:19] somewhere in what he is. Amen. You can
[1:03:22] he can be touched tonight by the feeling
[1:03:24] of your infirmities. Amen. You believe
[1:03:27] that tonight he's a real God.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He's not a mental conception. He's not a
[1:03:32] picture on the wall, but he's a real and
[1:03:34] living God that God come down. Amen. In
[1:03:37] in in our day and revealed the secrets
[1:03:39] of the heart. Amen. in the second pool.
[1:03:42] Amen. To grab our attention, amen. But
[1:03:44] more than that, amen. He revealed
[1:03:46] himself in the third pull and the
[1:03:48] opening of the word. And that's what
[1:03:49] caught the attention of the true
[1:03:51] believer. Amen. That that power of that
[1:03:53] fullness,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; It's available to you tonight.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; It's it can be more real than what we're
[1:04:00] seeing here tonight. Today, tonight.
[1:04:02] Amen. We've got to look beyond the
[1:04:04] unseen,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; but beyond the scene, rather,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And see the unseen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm just preaching.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Well, we look here. What did Daniel do?
[1:04:20] Daniel purposed in his heart to not
[1:04:23] defile himself with the king's meat. He
[1:04:26] purposed within himself to stay true to
[1:04:29] God. No matter who his earthly ruler
[1:04:32] was, no matter where he was, no, no
[1:04:36] matter where he was or what anybody else
[1:04:38] give him to, he was going to stay true.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to do in this
[1:04:43] hour?
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Daniel had been caught up into the
[1:04:48] Lord's day.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He wasn't caught up into the false
[1:04:51] worship,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He wasn't He wasn't interested in
[1:04:54] building a kingdom unto himself. He knew
[1:04:57] that it was God. He knew that it wasn't
[1:05:00] him
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; and he wasn't interested in those things
[1:05:03] because he had been caught up. He had
[1:05:04] seen a vision of the Lord's day. He seen
[1:05:07] what was going to take place. He had
[1:05:09] caught a vision of the power of Jesus
[1:05:12] Christ.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Gabriel's instructions to Daniel.
[1:05:17] But he had been in the very midst Daniel
[1:05:20] with nobody but three companions them in
[1:05:23] different parts of the kingdom. But
[1:05:25] Daniel standing alone with God held the
[1:05:27] victory for 68 years.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; He had kept the victory and was
[1:05:32] undefiled before God without the baptism
[1:05:36] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Without the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:05:40] make intercessions for him, with only
[1:05:42] the blood of bulls and goats and heers
[1:05:44] which he had to offer secretly, he said
[1:05:46] because of the heathens and traditions
[1:05:49] of that land,
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Daniel and them could stand there
[1:05:52] without a birth.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:55] without a birth of the word. They could
[1:05:57] stand there without the Holy Ghost. Why?
[1:06:01] Because they were the children of the
[1:06:03] promise by the flesh.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Children of Abraham, heirs of promise,
[1:06:08] not of the spiritual but by flesh.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And they came and they overcame the gate
[1:06:15] which was a promise to the children of
[1:06:17] Abraham. They overcame the gate of the
[1:06:19] enemy by holding the truth of the
[1:06:21] promise and having the faith to put
[1:06:24] themselves as part of the promise.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; To see themselves in the word.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Abraham was gone. Isaac was gone. Jacob
[1:06:36] was gone. Moses was gone. Joshua was
[1:06:39] gone. Everybody was gone. But Amen. They
[1:06:42] were prom they were they were children
[1:06:44] of the promise nonetheless.
[1:06:47] Amen. They were children of Abraham.
[1:06:48] They were part of the promise. Amen. It
[1:06:51] didn't matter if the prophets had went
[1:06:53] off the scene. Amen. There was people in
[1:06:55] the land. Amen. And they were in the
[1:06:56] awfulst of of situation. They were
[1:06:59] slaves. They didn't have no friends.
[1:07:01] They didn't have the They didn't have
[1:07:02] the word. They didn't have the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost. All they had was the blood of
[1:07:05] boys and goats. But yet, they kept the
[1:07:07] victory.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were a part of the
[1:07:09] promise. They seen themselves in the
[1:07:11] word.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; See yourselves in the word tonight.
[1:07:16] See yourselves in healing. See yourself
[1:07:18] in joy. See yourself in deliverance.
[1:07:21] It's yours tonight. It don't matter how
[1:07:23] long the prophet's been gone off the
[1:07:24] scene. It ain't got nothing to do with
[1:07:26] it. This ain't about a man. This ain't
[1:07:29] about the worship of a prophet. Amen.
[1:07:31] But it's about the Lord's day. It's
[1:07:33] about God making himself real.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I can't preach it no harder than that.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Good buddy. Come on.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; They overcame.
[1:07:43] We have no excuse tonight.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; We have no excuse.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; You ought to There ought to be a shout
[1:07:50] of the king in the camp tonight.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; This ought to be the loudest place in
[1:07:54] hearty Arkansas.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; You ought to be the most happiest people
[1:07:58] on the face of the planet.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; They seen themselves in the word.
[1:08:10] They can look at the promise even how
[1:08:13] God was with Abraham.
[1:08:16] Even when Abraham wasn't in the land.
[1:08:19] Amen. God had a way of seeing Abraham
[1:08:22] back.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; God had a way of seeing Abraham through
[1:08:27] it. And that's the promise of the
[1:08:29] believer in this hour. We get out of
[1:08:31] step,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; but you're a believer
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; and you'll God will make a way for you
[1:08:35] to get back. Amen. And and there will
[1:08:37] even be a blessing at the end of it
[1:08:39] because you are ordained of God to sit
[1:08:42] in this seat tonight. You're ordained of
[1:08:44] God to believe the message of the hour.
[1:08:46] You're ordained in the Leodysian church
[1:08:49] age to be a Christian and to be a light
[1:08:51] and to see yourselves in the word.
[1:08:54] [snorts]
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it is to all the children
[1:09:00] of Abraham. Amen. All of all of the seed
[1:09:04] of Abraham, the children of promise,
[1:09:05] those who will separate from the chaos,
[1:09:08] from the confusion of this world, you
[1:09:11] can inherit all things.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; The gate of your enemy will not overtake
[1:09:16] you, but you can possess it. Whatever
[1:09:20] that may be, you can possess it. You can
[1:09:23] keep the victory.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; He did it without the Holy Ghost. Who's
[1:09:27] got the Holy Ghost tonight?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And you've got him. He is the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost. It's not a third person. It's not
[1:09:35] the second person, but it's God. Amen.
[1:09:37] The dispensation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:39] Amen. Amen. God in his bride, in his
[1:09:42] church. [clears throat]
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? Daniel had purpose
[1:09:47] in his heart. He held the victory.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; He stayed true.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; you won't make it today without it.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; True. It wasn't available then. The
[1:10:01] blood of Jesus hadn't been shed, but it
[1:10:03] has now. It's available tonight. It's
[1:10:06] available to you tonight. That created
[1:10:08] blood cell that held the victory that we
[1:10:10] needed was broken. And the life and the
[1:10:13] nature of God has been released.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Only only the new birth
[1:10:22] will hold in this hour. No other
[1:10:24] experience,
[1:10:26] no emotional experience will bring you
[1:10:28] through or bring you to the realization
[1:10:30] that you're part of the word but the new
[1:10:32] birth. First John 5:4, for whatsoever is
[1:10:35] born of God overcometh the world.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And this is the victory that
[1:10:40] overcomemeth the world, even our faith.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram preaches a sermon. He
[1:10:45] says, why why some people can't keep the
[1:10:48] victory. What a what a title. He said,
[1:10:50] "Now notice the church doesn't need a
[1:10:52] polishing. It doesn't need a
[1:10:54] facelifting. It needs a birth."
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for a birth?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; When you when you couldn't when you when
[1:11:01] you tried when you tried to serve God
[1:11:03] and you couldn't, God provided a new
[1:11:05] birth.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; He provided the the birth of the Holy
[1:11:10] Ghost in your life.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He said it needs a birth. It needs a
[1:11:14] conversion. It needs some something's
[1:11:16] got to happen. Something's got to take
[1:11:18] place, young people. Yeah,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; it's more than more than knowing who
[1:11:22] Brother Brandham is. And our brother Joe
[1:11:24] brought that out and really drill it in.
[1:11:25] It's more than knowing the the tapes and
[1:11:28] the books. Amen. Something's got to take
[1:11:30] place. Something's got to happen. Amen.
[1:11:33] And when something happens, Amen. You
[1:11:35] got something to go back to when things
[1:11:37] begin to go wrong. You got something.
[1:11:39] You got an anchor down within you that
[1:11:41] will hold you.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And you can go back and you can say, "I
[1:11:45] know on this day the Lord done this for
[1:11:47] me." Amen. And it was a it was it was a
[1:11:50] point of contact. Amen. It was a victory
[1:11:52] in your life. It's where the victory
[1:11:55] began and where the defeat ended. Amen.
[1:11:57] And that's what the Holy Ghost is. Amen.
[1:11:59] Amen. It's where the defeat ends and the
[1:12:01] victory begins. And it's victory after
[1:12:04] victory after victory. Amen. And it is
[1:12:06] hard. It is a struggle. There is ups and
[1:12:09] downs. Amen. There there is things that
[1:12:11] you got to go through. Amen. But the
[1:12:13] Holy Ghost, which is him, he will see
[1:12:15] you through.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:20] The new birth, a word birth isn't only
[1:12:24] is your only way of living a victorious
[1:12:26] life. That's the only way that we can
[1:12:29] truly stand. When the word is born in
[1:12:31] you, when the word is born in us, it
[1:12:33] produces Jesus Christ. It produces the
[1:12:36] word in flesh. And it is this body. It
[1:12:40] it is this body is subject. It makes his
[1:12:42] body subject to the word by the spirit.
[1:12:47] What is it?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; It's overcoming the pressure. The
[1:12:51] outside pressure,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Because because the outside is trying to
[1:12:57] affect the inside.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in there, if the
[1:13:02] Holy Ghost is inside, that means that
[1:13:06] God is sealed in and the devil is sealed
[1:13:08] out.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; So, the only way that he can attack you
[1:13:12] is from the outside. You're you're
[1:13:14] sealed to the day of your redemption.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:13:19] Till the body change. If you live long
[1:13:22] enough to see it. If I live long enough
[1:13:24] to see it. Satan has no right or
[1:13:27] property. No, no, no ruler, no anything
[1:13:31] over that part of you. But the outside
[1:13:34] pressure is where he comes in. And the
[1:13:36] victory, amen, that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:38] produces, Amen. Amen. Amen. The life
[1:13:40] that it produces, Amen, inside you.
[1:13:43] Amen. Amen. Only only in in in that life
[1:13:47] in that inner man with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] being in there can you withstand the
[1:13:51] pressure that Satan has so produced in
[1:13:54] this age.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Only with that
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; can you withstand the pressure.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; It takes a birth.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Daniel could do it.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; We can't.
[1:14:10] Daniel Daniel could withstand the
[1:14:11] pressure then
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; because he was built for that for that
[1:14:15] age because he was a he was a it was a
[1:14:18] promise of the flesh
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; but this is a spiritual kingdom
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; and it's a spiritual battle
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; and it's a real battle and it's a
[1:14:27] pressure that doesn't let up. It's a
[1:14:29] pressure that that doesn't doesn't give
[1:14:30] in. Amen. And it takes the constant
[1:14:33] flowing of the Holy Ghost his present
[1:14:37] presence to overcome
[1:14:40] And that's what the word birth produces.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's not an emotion. It's not It's more
[1:14:45] than an emotion. It's a life. It's a
[1:14:47] sustaining life.
[1:14:53] And I know we know that, but I just
[1:14:55] wanted to wanted to cow down on that for
[1:14:58] a minute. What is it? It's the
[1:15:00] overcoming of the flesh.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Because if Satan can control this, then
[1:15:05] he can break you down.
[1:15:08] But if this is subject to the word,
[1:15:10] Satan, he his his hands are tied. His
[1:15:14] hands are tied. You see,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; but flesh and blood, flesh and blood
[1:15:19] cannot inherit the kingdom of God. And
[1:15:21] this corruption cannot inherit
[1:15:23] corruption.
[1:15:26] Amen.
[1:15:28] It takes something from within to
[1:15:30] inherit. It takes something from within
[1:15:32] to overcome.
[1:15:34] All right, we'll move on here.
[1:15:39] Lord help us.
[1:15:42] But I like what we read in the beginning
[1:15:43] there. Daniel refused to bow to that
[1:15:46] image.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; man? I don't know what y'all are talking
[1:15:49] about. I ain't I ain't nobody, man. I
[1:15:53] don't know why y'all made an image of
[1:15:54] me.
[1:15:56] I ain't nobody.
[1:15:59] I ain't bowing to that.
[1:16:03] But again, imagine those rulers looking
[1:16:05] at that image. But Daniel knew who the
[1:16:08] one true God was.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Y'all can y'all can be in that confusion
[1:16:12] all you want. If you want to worship a
[1:16:14] prophet, you can do that if you want.
[1:16:17] I'm not partaking in that.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Y'all can do whatever you want to do.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; But Daniel knew who the one true God
[1:16:23] was. He knew,
[1:16:25] amen, that God was the one that revealed
[1:16:27] those secrets.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Right. And brother Brandham will tell us
[1:16:29] I I wasn't the one, right? I wasn't the
[1:16:33] one at the river that day. That was him
[1:16:36] that spoke out. I was just standing
[1:16:38] there. Amen. I'm not the one that does
[1:16:40] these things. I'm just standing there
[1:16:41] when he does it. It's not me.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And we put so much on that. And our
[1:16:46] faith looks back to that. And and
[1:16:52] but where's your faith now?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Where's your faith now, Hebrew children?
[1:16:58] Yeah.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Where's your faith at now?
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Daniel's nowhere around.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; He cannot help you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; He cannot help you one bit, but he he is
[1:17:08] the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; He is the power and he is the authority.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That can take the word that was
[1:17:14] ministered to you and I and make it live
[1:17:17] in us and that we can overcome.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; He that overcomemeth will be granted to
[1:17:22] sit with me in my throne.
[1:17:24] Not that he that eases by,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; not that he that squeaks by and lives
[1:17:28] any old way, but he that overcomemeth.
[1:17:31] He that stays true to me will be he will
[1:17:34] sit with me and not throne.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He Daniel knew it wasn't him. He knew it
[1:17:39] was God. Amen. And it wasn't about
[1:17:42] Daniel. It was about God. Daniel knew
[1:17:45] there was only one true and living God.
[1:17:47] He knew that there was only only one.
[1:17:49] There was one other greater than
[1:17:51] himself. There was only one who could
[1:17:53] keep him and deliver him. And his trust
[1:17:55] wasn't in what he was, but the staying
[1:17:58] power of the God of heaven.
[1:18:01] In
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; 1956, the handwriting on the wall.
[1:18:05] Brother says, "I want you to notice at
[1:18:06] the beginning of the Gentiles when God
[1:18:08] dealt with them, they got hotty in their
[1:18:09] heart and forced every man to worship
[1:18:11] the image of a holy man. And the Gentile
[1:18:14] age was issued in with that. It will go
[1:18:16] out the same way. a boycott of the mark
[1:18:19] of the beast that will force people to
[1:18:21] worship images and do the things that
[1:18:23] we've been taught that was contrary to
[1:18:25] the word of God. And brother, it'll be
[1:18:28] so slick and sly until it will deceive
[1:18:30] the very elect
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; if possible. Come on now.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "So you better purpose in your
[1:18:36] heart."
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Tonight and be filled with God's Holy
[1:18:39] Spirit that you'll be able to discern
[1:18:41] the right and the wrong thing
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; when the proclamation is issued.
[1:18:46] Hallelujah. So he's telling you there's
[1:18:48] a worship coming. The way it started is
[1:18:51] the way that it will end.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We have heard a cry. We have
[1:18:58] heard a cry in this hour. Come out of
[1:19:00] her, my people. And be ye not partakers
[1:19:03] of her sin. Come out. The cry went forth
[1:19:05] to come out of the confusion. Come out
[1:19:08] of those harlot symptoms. And many of
[1:19:09] you sitting here tonight, you you can
[1:19:12] testify that. And when you came out, oh,
[1:19:14] how how the light shone. How the light
[1:19:17] shone. Amen. And and you were
[1:19:19] illuminated in the time of darkness. You
[1:19:21] were sleeping. You were you were
[1:19:22] asleeping. You were dead as a dead
[1:19:25] person in those those denominations.
[1:19:27] Amen. But a light shone. A voice came
[1:19:29] forth and you awoken. You were awaken
[1:19:32] out of sleep. Amen. From those
[1:19:33] denominational systems. Amen. Many of
[1:19:37] you done that. But what about tonight?
[1:19:39] What about in 2025? Where is the
[1:19:42] deception that would try to catch the
[1:19:44] elect if it were possible? It's not out
[1:19:47] there. But he said it'll be so close.
[1:19:50] Amen. What happened? It started with the
[1:19:52] forced worship of a man. Amen. And it
[1:19:55] will end with the worship of a man. You
[1:19:58] won't be tempted to worship a pope. But
[1:20:01] what about a man of God with a special
[1:20:03] revelation that only a few can
[1:20:05] understand and teach?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; What about Amen. making more out of the
[1:20:11] prophet than what even God made out of
[1:20:14] him.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we begin to draw lines and
[1:20:18] put people under fear, Amen. If they
[1:20:20] don't receive a certain doctrine, that
[1:20:23] is forced worship.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; When we make everything about a prophet,
[1:20:27] Amen. And we make everything a prophet
[1:20:29] said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, and if you
[1:20:31] don't believe it, then you can't be the
[1:20:32] bride, part of the bride." That is a
[1:20:34] fearbased religion. That is a forced
[1:20:37] worship upon the people, upon your
[1:20:40] congregation. Amen. When Amen. when they
[1:20:43] when the new begin to sing more Amen.
[1:20:45] When we begin to sing more about a
[1:20:47] prophet than our Lord and Savior, that
[1:20:49] is idol worship. You idolize a man that
[1:20:52] needed the same redeeming power as
[1:20:54] anyone else, as you and I. Amen. This
[1:20:57] isn't the day of a man. What is it? What
[1:21:00] is this day? Daniel saw it. John saw it.
[1:21:03] John said, "I was in the spirit on the
[1:21:05] Lord's day." And John seen the whole
[1:21:07] thing played out. And brother Bram said
[1:21:09] John was a type of the bribe. Amen. And
[1:21:12] a prophet came and opened the word to us
[1:21:15] by the Holy Ghost. By the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:18] And we have been caught up in that
[1:21:20] tonight. Amen. This isn't man's age.
[1:21:23] This is the Lord's age. Lord, give me
[1:21:25] breath in my lungs tonight. Amen. We
[1:21:27] have been unearthed. We've been brought
[1:21:29] out of the chaos. We have been brought
[1:21:32] out of the confusion. Amen. By the
[1:21:34] opening of the word, the seals have been
[1:21:36] revealed and a loosening power has been
[1:21:39] released to you and I. This isn't man's
[1:21:41] day. This is the Lord's day. This is the
[1:21:44] eagle age. Amen. Amen. And you tonight
[1:21:46] are under a prophetic anointing. Amen.
[1:21:49] And it is going from the prophet to the
[1:21:51] prophecy. Amen. From what was said to
[1:21:54] things that ought to be. Amen. And to us
[1:21:57] has been released faith for this age to
[1:22:00] overcome. Faith to believe what the
[1:22:02] message has for us. Preach with me
[1:22:04] tonight. Amen. In this age, Amen. That
[1:22:06] fullness of the word has been open.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Not for what what you want.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; But what you need.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; What do you need tonight? The Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] is here to provide it. Amen. Amen. To
[1:22:18] move upon the scene. Amen. What do you
[1:22:21] need tonight, little Hattie? Do you need
[1:22:23] your children? What do you need tonight?
[1:22:26] What's your desire? Amen. Is it filtered
[1:22:29] through the word of God or is it or is
[1:22:30] it earthly based? Amen. The word of God
[1:22:33] has br has come to bring us, Amen, from
[1:22:35] an earthly to a heavenly mindset.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; this is the Lord's day.
[1:22:52] Daniel's seen it. John seen it. And
[1:22:55] you're living in it.
[1:22:58] You're here.
[1:23:00] You're here partaking. This is his day.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; It is the omnipotent sovereign God who
[1:23:06] has been made known to you and I. This
[1:23:09] is the age of adoption when sons of God.
[1:23:11] It's not not the day of man. It's not
[1:23:14] the day of any old religion, but it's
[1:23:15] the age of adoption when sons of God are
[1:23:18] manifested. When we have received
[1:23:20] empowerment by his omnipotence in our
[1:23:23] midst.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Fear not, John. Fear not, little flock.
[1:23:31] Fear not.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; All my power is yours.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; All my omnipotence is yours. In the
[1:23:38] church age book, I have not come to
[1:23:41] bring you fear or failure, but I've come
[1:23:44] to bring you courage, love, and ability.
[1:23:47] Amen. And I am the omnipotent one
[1:23:49] standing in your midst. Reading that
[1:23:52] from the church age book.
[1:23:55] Amen. It is the omnipotent, sovereign
[1:23:57] God who's been made known. Friends, it's
[1:23:59] more than God sent a prophet tonight.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; It's so much more than that. Amen. It is
[1:24:05] the bride and the bridegroom becoming
[1:24:07] one. This is the Lord's day.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; God's provide a place of worship. 1965,
[1:24:16] if you're part of the bride, you are
[1:24:18] because the bride is part of the groom,
[1:24:21] you know. So, we find out that it's the
[1:24:23] same thing. And she'll do just exactly
[1:24:25] what's predicted for her to do in this
[1:24:27] day. She won't be a leo to sin. Not by
[1:24:30] no means a lukewarm, but she'll be on
[1:24:31] fire for God.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; She'll be moving on in the spirit of
[1:24:36] God.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] Daniel
[1:24:42] stood. The prophet has came and stood.
[1:24:44] What? What are we going to do?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Hebrew children,
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; what are we going to do?
[1:24:52] There was a few young believers that
[1:24:54] knew their God.
[1:24:56] true children of Abraham. Everybody else
[1:24:59] was bowing down
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; like it was nothing.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's there's Daniel. Okay. All
[1:25:04] right.
[1:25:06] But they weren't willing under the
[1:25:09] persecution, the threat of fire to even
[1:25:11] bend a knee to save their lives.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; All they had to do was bend down.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; All they had to do and they wouldn't
[1:25:18] have to go through nothing.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, you can get up. God forgive me.
[1:25:25] No,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; it was a test,
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; it was a test,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Believers
[1:25:36] don't live under a forced religion.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; We serve God because we love God.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; And we love him because he first loved
[1:25:45] us.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; No, none of us have to be here, but
[1:25:49] we're here
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; because we love him.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; We're not here because it's easy. Come
[1:25:54] on.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; We're here because it's hard.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; We don't want it to be easy.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Believers are tough.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; You're tough tonight.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You're tough. And the devil can blow and
[1:26:06] blow and blow.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Believers don't bluff.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they won't make their
[1:26:11] stand.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; They weren't they weren't willing
[1:26:15] through the the threat of burning alive
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; to bend their knee.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Don't give up so easy. There's a victory
[1:26:23] that you can have tonight. Daniel 3:14
[1:26:26] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said to them,
[1:26:27] "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:26:29] Abedneo? Do do not you serve my gods,
[1:26:32] nor worship the the golden image which I
[1:26:34] have set up. Now if you be ready that at
[1:26:36] what time you hear the sound of the
[1:26:38] cornet, the flute, the harp, a s
[1:26:41] whatever that is sack, but
[1:26:45] sultry and doul I am so sorry. and all
[1:26:48] kinds of music you fall down and worship
[1:26:50] the image which I have made. Well, but
[1:26:52] if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
[1:26:55] same hour into the midst of a burning
[1:26:57] fiery furnace. And who is that God thou
[1:26:59] shall deliver you out of this out of my
[1:27:02] hands? And I love this verse 16.
[1:27:05] Daniel 3:16, Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:27:07] Abednego answered and said to the king,
[1:27:09] "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful
[1:27:11] to answer thee in this matter. If it be
[1:27:14] so, our God whom we serve is able to
[1:27:17] deliver us from the burning fiery
[1:27:20] furnace. And he will deliver us out of
[1:27:22] thine hand, O king. Listen to this. But
[1:27:25] if not,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; be it known unto thee, oh king, that we
[1:27:29] will not serve thy gods,
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; nor worship the golden image which thou
[1:27:34] set up. They testified.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; They had a testimony service there. They
[1:27:38] got together. They had a little meeting
[1:27:40] about it.
[1:27:42] brother, God's able.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; God's able. And we're going to tell the
[1:27:46] king this. And they told the king that.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And they said, "If the king says this,
[1:27:51] then we're going to say this and say,
[1:27:53] "Even if he don't,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; even if if he don't do it, we believe
[1:27:58] that he can, but if he don't, Amen.
[1:28:00] We're still not bending the knee."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said in 1965 and
[1:28:04] ashamed, he said Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:28:06] Abednego wasn't afraid of the fiery
[1:28:08] furnace. He said, "Our God is able to
[1:28:10] deliver us, but if he don't, we're not
[1:28:13] bound out." He said, "They wasn't
[1:28:14] ashamed of it." No, sir. No, sir. They
[1:28:16] certainly wasn't ashamed of it because
[1:28:18] they knew.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; They knew where they stood.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; They knew where they were standing. They
[1:28:23] They were positive.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; They were positive that God was able to
[1:28:28] see them through. Amen. And even if he
[1:28:30] didn't, they still wouldn't bow. Oh my.
[1:28:32] Tonight, things can get real tense. The
[1:28:34] trial. Amen. The trials can get hot.
[1:28:37] Amen. But that's when a believer presses
[1:28:39] on. That's when you shine as a bride of
[1:28:41] Jesus Christ. Amen. The trial can become
[1:28:43] fiery. Things can look real dark, but
[1:28:46] it's under pressure. When a genuine
[1:28:48] faith is made known, amen. And you've
[1:28:50] got to stand there. You've got to stand
[1:28:52] there and be positive. Amen. Despite all
[1:28:55] the negative, Amen. And that type of
[1:28:57] faith is what brings God on the scene.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:29:02] He says, "And I know
[1:29:05] 1960." "And when your faith is put to a
[1:29:07] test, then don't fail. Stay right with
[1:29:09] what you believe."
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; And then their faith was put to a a test
[1:29:13] and they went to a crucial hour. Not
[1:29:16] only did they not only did they go to
[1:29:18] ash sheet, but they went to a fiery
[1:29:20] furnace, but Satan could not destroy
[1:29:22] them, for God's purpose wasn't
[1:29:24] fulfilled.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's purpose has got to be
[1:29:27] fulfilled. It's got to be seen through.
[1:29:30] They could go in there with this hope.
[1:29:31] He says that I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; They could go in there with this hope.
[1:29:37] We are assured that God is able to
[1:29:38] deliver us from this fiery furnace. But
[1:29:40] nevertheless, we will not bow to the
[1:29:43] image.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Help me preach tonight. In those times,
[1:29:47] we've got to know
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; in sickness, you have to know that he is
[1:29:51] the Lord who heals all thy disease and
[1:29:53] all thy sicknesses. When things are
[1:29:55] hard, you have to know that God is able
[1:29:57] to deliver you from all your troubles
[1:29:59] and that he is your refuge, that he is
[1:30:02] your hiding place. Amen. To know that he
[1:30:04] is the author and the finisher of your
[1:30:06] faith. Amen. To know that he called you
[1:30:08] and will see you through it. If God
[1:30:10] called you to it, God will see you
[1:30:12] through it. You've got to know that he
[1:30:14] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:30:16] forever. Amen. To know that he is
[1:30:19] working all things for your good. Amen.
[1:30:21] And the Hebrew children knew God's
[1:30:23] ability to change a situation. Amen.
[1:30:26] They knew his ability to part the
[1:30:28] waters. They knew his ability to show up
[1:30:30] in a time of battle. And that this is
[1:30:33] the Lord's battle. Amen. They knew at
[1:30:36] that point of their trial that all they
[1:30:38] could do was stand still and see the
[1:30:40] deliverance, see the salvation of God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; They knew
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; that that's all they could do.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else they could do but
[1:30:48] that.
[1:30:55] again. And I know my redeemer liveth. I
[1:30:57] got a few more minutes about 30.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; help us, Jesus. Deliver us, Lord. I know
[1:31:06] my redeemer liveth. Kind of the same
[1:31:09] same title there. He said, "We think of
[1:31:10] the Hebrew children when God had a
[1:31:12] purpose for them. when they were down a
[1:31:15] bad one and the furnace, listen to this,
[1:31:18] [snorts] and the furnace was hit. I
[1:31:20] don't know where it got hit from, seven
[1:31:22] times harder than it ever was heated to
[1:31:24] destroy the purpose of God. The fire was
[1:31:27] heated to destroy the purpose of God for
[1:31:30] the children.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those Hebrew children.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And all Babylon was on a
[1:31:34] rage. Satan was determined to destroy
[1:31:37] the purpose of God. For he knew those
[1:31:39] children was going in that furnace."
[1:31:41] Listen to this. So he made the furnace.
[1:31:43] Amen. when he he hit it seven times
[1:31:45] hotter to be sure the program of God
[1:31:47] would be destroyed. But listen to this.
[1:31:50] But God wanted to display his power and
[1:31:53] all Babylon and all hell could not
[1:31:56] defeat that purpose. No sir. No matter
[1:31:59] if they could have heated it that
[1:32:00] furnace a million times hotter. It would
[1:32:03] have never been destroyed. The never
[1:32:05] destroyed the purpose of God. God wanted
[1:32:06] to show that he was a God of deliverance
[1:32:09] and that he he'd bring deliverance to
[1:32:11] whomever desired. Amen. to bring it and
[1:32:13] nothing would interfere with his
[1:32:15] program.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; R said, "Fire cannot defeat God's
[1:32:19] purpose."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Your fiery trials,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; are for your good.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Your fiery trials cannot defeat God's
[1:32:27] purpose.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to take you out. He wants to
[1:32:30] destroy you.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; But the fiery trial cannot defeat
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; God's purpose.
[1:32:38] He says, "Oh, how I love to say this
[1:32:40] this morning. All the hydrogen bombs in
[1:32:42] the world can never defeat the
[1:32:43] resurrection of his church. All the
[1:32:45] explaining away and all the mathematics
[1:32:46] and so forth. Amen. That this
[1:32:48] intelligent world is disguised through
[1:32:50] her her purpose to do something about to
[1:32:52] destroy the faith of God's children. It
[1:32:55] will never do it. That faith will live
[1:32:58] forever.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Will that faith live forever?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Will the purpose of God in your life be
[1:33:06] destroyed?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; No. That faith will live forever.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can stand tonight.
[1:33:16] I got quite a bit more here, but I won't
[1:33:19] hold you.
[1:33:26] Daniel 3:20.
[1:33:29] I lied, didn't I?
[1:33:33] I can't. I got to finish this. I'm
[1:33:35] sorry. Daniel 3:20. And he commanded the
[1:33:38] most mighty men that were in his army to
[1:33:40] bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, and
[1:33:42] to cast them into the burning fiery
[1:33:44] furnace. The Bible [music] says that
[1:33:46] fire was so hot that it slew the men who
[1:33:50] took up the Hebrew children.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And there at the last moment, all
[1:33:55] Babylon is raging, the king is raging,
[1:33:57] the king gave his commandment. It looked
[1:33:59] like [music] defeat for the children of
[1:34:00] Israel.
[1:34:02] All Babylon, all hell was against him.
[1:34:04] But all the power in [music] heaven
[1:34:07] stood ready to move.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. There stands his majesty. There we
[1:34:14] seen the earthly scene play out, but
[1:34:15] there was a heavenly scene playing out.
[1:34:17] And brother Brandham describes that.
[1:34:19] There stands his majesty, the great
[1:34:21] attribute of the fullness of God, the
[1:34:24] pillar of fire, the Lord of hosts, the
[1:34:27] Lord that is mighty in battle. There
[1:34:29] he's standing. Amen. [music] His majesty
[1:34:32] on his throne. They're watching his
[1:34:35] children there with his angels all
[1:34:38] around him.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown tells a story how here
[1:34:41] moves up the angel Wormwood.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; The angel who controls all the waters.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; He looks down. Master, have you looked
[1:34:49] down there at these believers?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I watched them all night.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, heaven's watching.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; They don't never take their eyes off of
[1:34:59] you.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; They see what you're going through
[1:35:01] tonight. I may not see it. This brother
[1:35:03] may not see it, but God sees what you're
[1:35:06] going through.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Heaven
[1:35:08] has has all your attention.
[1:35:15] Heaven's watching.
[1:35:17] He's saying there, "Let me go down at
[1:35:19] thy command and bring a flood to destroy
[1:35:22] Babylon and put out that [music] fire."
[1:35:25] Here comes another angel, Michael. He
[1:35:26] said that great angel that stands in the
[1:35:28] presence of God there with the sword
[1:35:30] ready drawn to go down at the king's
[1:35:32] command.
[1:35:34] Brother said these angels both could
[1:35:36] have went down and delivered at the
[1:35:38] moment of command.
[1:35:40] And [music] here he says and I can hear
[1:35:42] him say Michael you've obeyed me since
[1:35:44] the day I created you. But I can't let
[1:35:46] you go [music] because I'm going I'm
[1:35:48] going myself. This is a mansized job.
[1:35:51] Yeah.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And there he raises up off of his seat
[1:35:54] there, God, the fullness of the
[1:35:56] attribute, the Lord of hosts. And there
[1:35:58] he grabs a light and bold and he rides
[1:36:00] down just before the moment. And I
[1:36:03] believe I believe that he was in the
[1:36:05] fire before they even got close to it.
[1:36:10] Amen. And he's in your trial tonight.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; He's in the fire tonight before you can
[1:36:14] even get close to it. I believe God is
[1:36:16] waiting for you there tonight.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. There he rides it on down and
[1:36:21] brother Random depicts a story. Amen. He
[1:36:24] stops in just [music] enough time to get
[1:36:25] a palm branch and there he's in the
[1:36:28] fire. And there they get thrown in the
[1:36:30] fire. Amen. But what was it? What kept
[1:36:33] them from burning? What kept their
[1:36:34] clothes from getting singed? It was the
[1:36:36] very presence of the fourth man. Amen.
[1:36:39] The king looked down and said, "Did we
[1:36:40] not cast three men bound into the midst
[1:36:42] of the fire? Lo, I see the fourth man
[1:36:45] walking down there." Amen. They're
[1:36:47] walking around. Amen. Amen. What were
[1:36:49] they singing? What were they doing? I
[1:36:51] don't think they were down there
[1:36:52] whispering, "What's going on? What's
[1:36:54] going on?" But I believe they were in
[1:36:56] worship. Amen. They were in the presence
[1:36:57] of the fourth man. Brother said, "Amen.
[1:37:00] Who is the fourth man?" He said, "It's
[1:37:02] Jesus Christ." They asked him the
[1:37:04] question. They said, "Was that Daniel
[1:37:06] the prophet?" He said, "No, that was
[1:37:08] Jesus Christ."
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth man, God didn't
[1:37:11] descend. Amen. An angel. He didn't
[1:37:13] descend a man. He came himself. Amen. It
[1:37:16] was the Lord on the scene.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:21] Amen. He was in the midst of their
[1:37:23] child.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Brother B said he took the fire and he
[1:37:27] turned [music] the keys and he unlocked
[1:37:29] the power of that fire to loosen their
[1:37:32] bands. Oh my. I can I [music] can think
[1:37:35] they were down there rejoicing, praising
[1:37:37] God, having a good time. They weren't
[1:37:39] worried about the flames. They were
[1:37:41] singing, "He's an on time God." Yes, he
[1:37:45] is. Yeah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I [music] said he's an on time God.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's in the fire tonight. He He's

[1:39:19] May we we've been struggling for years
[1:39:21] with things. Oh God, come in the midst
[1:39:23] of the fire, that which was meant to
[1:39:26] destroy us. Oh God, come on the [music]
[1:39:29] scene now. Help your people. Everything
[1:39:31] that they go through, everything that
[1:39:32] they face, Lord, we just commit them to
[1:39:34] you tonight. We love you in Jesus name
[1:39:37] we pray.

[1:41:56] one.

[1:43:00] I need thee.
[1:43:04] Oh, won't you bless
[1:43:08] me [music and singing] now,
[1:43:11] my savior?
[1:43:14] [singing]
[1:43:16] I come
[1:43:20] to
[1:43:22] [music]
[1:43:23] I wonder if we just worship him for a
[1:43:25] moment now. Oh, I need
[1:43:29] [singing and music]
[1:43:31] thee. Oh,
[1:43:34] I need thee. Yes, we do, Lord.
[1:43:39] Oh, every [singing]
[1:43:41] [music]
[1:43:43] hour
[1:43:46] I need thee. [music and singing]
[1:43:49] Oh,
[1:43:51] just bless
[1:43:53] thee now.
[1:43:56] My savior
[1:43:59] [singing]
[1:44:02] I come
[1:44:05] to
[1:44:08] one more time with your hands up to him.
[1:44:10] Do you need him [singing and music] here
[1:44:11] tonight? Oh, I need
[1:44:16] thee. Oh,
[1:44:19] I need [singing and music] thee.
[1:44:25] And
[1:44:27] every hour
[1:44:31] I need you, Lord. Yes, we do. Sing it.
[1:44:36] Oh, [singing and music] bless
[1:44:39] be
[1:44:42] my savior. [singing]
[1:44:47] I come [singing]
[1:44:51] to you. If anyone else needs prayer,
[1:44:53] [music] the altar's still open. One more
[1:44:55] time with all your hearts now. Oh,
[1:44:58] I need
[1:45:01] Yes, we need you, Lord.

[1:45:21] Oh, [singing] bless
[1:45:24] me now.
[1:45:27] My [singing and music] savior.
[1:45:32] I [singing] come [music]
[1:45:36] to
[1:45:39] thee. [singing]
[1:45:41] Just play that for just a moment before
[1:45:42] we go. Amen. How many knows he's here
[1:45:45] tonight? Amen. The word went [music]
[1:45:47] forth and I was thinking when brother
[1:45:49] Stewart was preaching. Amen. Brother
[1:45:50] Brandham didn't come to point us to
[1:45:52] himself, [music]
[1:45:53] but he came to point us to the one that
[1:45:55] he was representing. And aren't you glad
[1:45:57] tonight that [music] we know that we
[1:45:59] don't serve a God of history, but he
[1:46:02] lifted him up out of history to show him
[1:46:03] we have a real and living God here
[1:46:05] tonight. And if you have a need among
[1:46:07] you tonight, I just wonder while we sing
[1:46:08] that one more time, if you just slip a
[1:46:11] hand up to him and say, "Lord, I need
[1:46:12] you." I don't care if it's I [music]
[1:46:14] don't care if it's health or financial
[1:46:16] or whatever it is. Amen. I believe he's
[1:46:18] here to meet every need in the building
[1:46:20] tonight. Amen. He's come to vindicate
[1:46:22] his word that was preached here this
[1:46:23] evening. I feel him here and I hope you
[1:46:25] do too. Amen. I love it when he shows
[1:46:27] up. I hate to just rush off when he's
[1:46:30] here because I believe if you have a
[1:46:31] need and I believe every one of us have
[1:46:33] needs here in the building tonight and I
[1:46:35] think it's just time just for a minute
[1:46:36] now. I wonder if we could just sing this
[1:46:38] to him and pray to him in your heart.
[1:46:40] Whatever your need is, just accept that
[1:46:43] he is here to do the to finish the work
[1:46:45] tonight. Amen. as we sing it now with
[1:46:47] all of our hearts. Oh, [singing]
[1:46:51] free
[1:46:54] I need thee.
[1:46:58] Oh, sing it to him. Oh, bless.
[1:47:03] Bless me now,
[1:47:06] my [singing] savior.
[1:47:11] I come [singing]
[1:47:15] to
[1:47:18] all over the building now. Let me hear
[1:47:19] you singing. Oh, singing.
[1:47:22] [music and singing]
[1:47:23] I need
[1:47:26] [music] thee. Oh,
[1:47:30] I need [singing] thee.
[1:47:34] Sing [music]
[1:47:35] it.
[1:47:38] Pray out.
[1:47:41] I need thee. [singing]
[1:47:45] Oh yes.
[1:47:49] Bee now
[1:47:52] my [singing] savior.
[1:47:58] I come
[1:48:02] to
[1:48:05] thee.
[1:48:06] You give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:48:08] tonight. [applause]
[1:48:10] Aren't you thankful? Amen. When he comes
[1:48:12] by our way. Amen. How many enjoyed the
[1:48:15] word of the Lord tonight for my brother
[1:48:17] Stewart? Amen. Go ahead, give the Lord a
[1:48:19] hand clap of praise. Amen. I I you know
[1:48:22] this is [applause]
[1:48:24] I've been thinking about this and
[1:48:25] studying on [music] it. Amen. There is a
[1:48:27] voice in this hour that we've had to
[1:48:30] come under subjection to. But the
[1:48:32] prophet taught us that we would be the
[1:48:36] final voice
[1:48:37] to the final age under her messenger.
[1:48:40] Aren't you glad that the bride has a
[1:48:43] voice? It's not our voice, but it's the
[1:48:45] voice of God. And I'm so thankful for it
[1:48:48] here tonight. Amen. That [music] we know
[1:48:50] when he speaks, there's authority behind
[1:48:53] it. Aren't you thankful for that
[1:48:55] tonight? Don't mean to be a crybaby, but
[1:48:57] I tell you, I just feel the presence of
[1:48:58] the Lord here tonight. And I'm thankful
[1:49:00] that the Lord would use a man, let him
[1:49:01] yield himself so that we could feed on
[1:49:04] the word of God tonight. Amen. Just
[1:49:06] before we go, I wonder if we could just
[1:49:07] sing this. Learning to lean. Same key.
[1:49:10] Well, I'm learning [singing]
[1:49:13] to lean. Oh yes, I'm [singing and music]
[1:49:16] learning
[1:49:19] how to lean.
[1:49:21] And I'm [singing] learning
[1:49:24] to lean
[1:49:27] on [singing] Jesus.
[1:49:31] And I am finding [singing]
[1:49:35] more power
[1:49:38] than I ever
[1:49:40] [music] dream.
[1:49:42] Oh yes, I'm learning [singing]
[1:49:46] to lean
[1:49:48] on Jesus.
[1:49:51] Amen. [music] Sing it as you go now. Oh,
[1:49:53] I'm learning [singing]
[1:49:56] to leave.
[1:49:58] Yes, I'm learning [singing]
[1:50:01] how to lean.
[1:50:04] And I'm [music] learning
[1:50:07] to lean
[1:50:09] on Jesus.
[1:50:14] And I'm finding [singing]
[1:50:17] more [music] power.
