[29:59] [Music]
[30:02] Come Holy Spirit,
[30:07] I need thee.
[30:13] Come.
[30:15] Holy Spirit,
[30:18] I pray.
[30:26] I
[30:29] like power.
[30:47] Holy Spirit,
[30:50] I lead thee.
[30:58] Holy Spirit,
[31:01] I pray
[31:03] [Music]
[31:20] that special
[31:23] way. Would you raise your hands to him
[31:24] and sing it this morning? Oh, won't you
[31:28] come?
[31:30] Holy Spirit,
[31:33] I need thee. Make it your prayer now.
[31:38] Won't you come,
[31:41] sweet spirit,
[31:44] I pray? Won't you come in your strength
[31:48] and your power? Come
[31:51] in thy strength and thy power.
[31:57] Oh Lord Jesus, won't you come
[32:02] in thine own special way? Could we sing
[32:07] it one more time? Invite him in this
[32:09] morning. Won't you come, oh Lord? We
[32:13] need you this morning.
[32:15] Oh, I need thee.
[32:18] Hallelujah.
[32:20] Won't you come down?
[32:23] Holy Spirit
[32:26] I pray.
[32:29] Come in your strength. Won't you come
[32:33] in my strength and
[32:37] thy power?
[32:41] Oh, won't you come
[32:44] in and throw
[32:47] [Applause]
[32:48] away
[32:51] bow your heads while they play that
[32:53] softly? Maybe you've got a special need
[32:56] this morning and you need the Holy
[32:57] Spirit to come and speak to that need.
[33:00] Would you just raise your hand today and
[33:02] believe that God's going to take care of
[33:03] every need and he knows all about it
[33:06] this morning. He's able. He's able to do
[33:09] that. Heavenly Father, Lord, I I'm
[33:12] insufficient in myself to care for the
[33:15] needs of the people in the way that I I
[33:17] should, Lord, but I know that you're
[33:19] able. I pray, God, that you'd reach down
[33:22] this morning. Lord, you to heal the
[33:24] brokenhearted, touch those that are
[33:26] hurting, Lord. Lord, may your anointing
[33:29] flow, oh God, from your word, and may it
[33:32] strengthen our lives and satisfy the
[33:35] thirst on the inside, Lord. May it heal
[33:38] the sick, oh God. May you may you make
[33:40] yourself known, oh God, mighty in
[33:43] battle, I pray you'd grant it today,
[33:47] Lord. Every need, physical, financial,
[33:49] whatever it is, Lord, I pray you'd meet
[33:51] it today. Move me out of the way. If
[33:54] there ever was a time, Lord, that I
[33:56] needed you, it was this morning. And I
[33:58] pray, God, that you'd move me out of the
[34:00] way and speak to your people. We pray in
[34:03] Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you this
[34:07] morning. Romans chapter 8 and verse 818.
[34:11] And then we'll read from Ephesians 4:11.
[34:14] Romans 8:18 and Ephesians 4:11. It's
[34:18] good to be in church this morning. I
[34:19] know there's several missing. Some are
[34:21] hunting and and some are uh gone and
[34:25] different reasons. Brother Joel's
[34:27] traveling back from Bethl camp. Be
[34:29] praying for him. Brother David got sick
[34:31] this morning. Unable to be here. Brother
[34:33] David White. So be praying for him this
[34:34] morning. Romans chapter 8 verse 18. For
[34:37] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[34:40] present time are not worthy to be
[34:43] compared with the glory which shall be I
[34:47] like that shall be revealed in us. For
[34:52] the earnest expectation of the creature
[34:55] waitth for the manifestation
[34:58] of the sons of God. And then Ephesians
[35:01] chapter 4 and 11
[35:04] says, "He gave some apostles and some
[35:06] prophets and some evangelists and some
[35:09] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[35:12] of the saints, for the work of the
[35:14] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[35:18] of Christ, till we all come in the unity
[35:22] of the faith and the knowledge of the
[35:24] son of God unto a perfect man." In other
[35:29] words, a fully grown man unto the
[35:32] measure of the stature of the fullness
[35:35] of Christ. Amen. I pray the Lord would
[35:38] add his blessing to the word. You may be
[35:40] seated this morning. I want to speak to
[35:42] you this morning on what does a
[35:43] manifested son look like? What does a
[35:47] manifested son look like? I think we get
[35:51] an idea. Thank you, brother Danny. We
[35:53] get an idea in our in our minds of what
[35:56] a manifested son would be as if it would
[36:00] be some type of superman. It would be
[36:02] some type of of uh of uh a a god man.
[36:08] And and and it is. And yet we get this
[36:11] idea that it would be without failure,
[36:14] without frailty, without humanity. And
[36:17] yet we know when Jesus come to the
[36:19] earth, he didn't come that way. But he
[36:22] come in a human body. And he come in a
[36:24] body that could get sick and could and
[36:26] could be tempted and and and could get
[36:29] worried and could get stressed out and
[36:31] could get angry. Yet he never sinned.
[36:34] And I'm so thankful for that example
[36:36] that we have today. And yet in
[36:39] ourselves, we even come uh in a way that
[36:42] that the word is in us. We believe that.
[36:44] We believe that that we're part of the
[36:47] word. Yet uh we're we're human and we
[36:51] tend to make mistakes and we tend to
[36:53] have problems and and we're not even as
[36:56] he was he was virgin born. We are not.
[36:59] And so we come into the world in a in a
[37:01] manner that every man is born of a
[37:04] woman's a few days and full of trouble.
[37:06] Comes into the world with a sinful
[37:08] nature speaking lies. And and so we we
[37:12] have come into a world that uh we carry
[37:15] a body of humiliation with us. And and I
[37:18] know everybody wants to think, well, I I
[37:21] I believe that I could speak to the
[37:23] storm. And I believe that you could. I
[37:25] believe that's the hour that we're
[37:26] living in and the potentials that we
[37:28] have as children of God. And yet many
[37:31] times in in doing that, we look at that
[37:33] example and say, "Well, I I want to
[37:35] speak to storms." And yet, we have a
[37:37] hard time getting ourselves out of bed
[37:39] and getting to church. And come on,
[37:41] church. We we're human beings. We're not
[37:43] we're not some type of a of a Superman.
[37:46] And we we need to get rid of that idea
[37:48] in our in our heart of what that will
[37:50] be. We're going to carry these bodies of
[37:52] humiliation until the moment that we
[37:54] leave here, right? And that's the
[37:57] fullness of our adoption is the change
[38:00] of these bodies when we become fullgrown
[38:03] sons of God. And yet there's a place
[38:05] that we can come to under the message of
[38:07] the hour that we do have a a control and
[38:10] a do a domination if you will over our
[38:14] surroundings, over our flesh, over sin,
[38:17] over those things. That's a place that
[38:18] we're called to that we can come to. And
[38:21] yet this body is still a body of death.
[38:24] It's still a body of sin. It's still a
[38:26] body that'll that'll plague you until
[38:28] the day that you die. But remember, when
[38:30] you get rid of this body, there's
[38:32] already another body waiting. This isn't
[38:35] even the real you, but there's a real
[38:37] you waiting somewhere.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And we've got to remember that we're
[38:42] we're we're only here we're here as as
[38:44] for a purpose. And I guess if you would
[38:47] just, you know, the the the most uh
[38:50] example, the best example that we have
[38:52] of what a manifested son would look like
[38:54] in this age in a in a a body of a human
[38:59] being, a redeemed body would be brother
[39:02] Brandham,
[39:04] &gt;&gt; right? Because he did come to that place
[39:06] where the Lord allowed him to speak a
[39:08] squirrel into existence.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; And some of y'all say, "Well, I got as
[39:12] much of that as, you know, Brother
[39:13] Brandham does." Well, why are you still
[39:15] using corn then to attract deer?
[39:21] &gt;&gt; I went in Walmart the other day and and
[39:23] and everybody there was buying corn. I
[39:26] thought they're keeping the economy
[39:27] alive. This guy's buying corn to attract
[39:30] deer. And yet we say we're manifested
[39:33] sons of God living in the age of
[39:34] adoption and we are.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me church? And yet, brother
[39:39] Brandham come to that. And yet, you look
[39:40] at brother Brandham and what we failed
[39:42] to see is what he had to go through
[39:45] &gt;&gt; to get to that place.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; See, God used that vessel, but he lost
[39:49] his baby. He lost his wife. He went
[39:52] through some things.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; He'd been through some heartaches, been
[39:55] through some trials. It wasn't always
[39:57] easy in the Brandom home,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Huh? You say, "Well, a prophet's home
[40:01] would always be would always be stable."
[40:04] And no, I'll take you back to Moses in
[40:06] the Old Testament. Moses and Zapora had
[40:10] a lot of fights and had a lot of trouble
[40:12] and a lot of strife and a lot of
[40:13] struggle. And and so a prophet's home
[40:16] isn't necessarily easy. It's not an easy
[40:18] place to live. A preacher's home isn't
[40:20] necessarily easy. I I had someone one
[40:23] time tell me, and you forgive me this
[40:24] morning, we're going to be very real
[40:26] today. So I I I had someone tell me one
[40:30] time in counseling and they told me
[40:31] said, "Brother Ben, you don't understand
[40:33] because your marriage has always been
[40:34] perfect." And I laughed at them.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't intend to, but I chuckled
[40:40] because I thought, "God, if they only
[40:42] knew how how how close that I had come
[40:44] to giving up so many times." And I'm
[40:46] sure I'd push my wife to the brink. But
[40:48] but but but we we're adults. We chose to
[40:51] do something different and and come
[40:53] together and do what's right. and and
[40:56] and we did that because of the influence
[40:58] of the word of God in our life. And and
[41:00] that's what manifested sons are not sons
[41:02] without trouble. Manifested sons and
[41:05] daughters of God are not people with no
[41:07] trouble in their lives or their homes or
[41:09] in the church, but pe manifested sons
[41:11] and daughters of God are people who who
[41:14] make the decision that they need to make
[41:16] when the time comes. They stand for the
[41:18] word and when it's revealed to them what
[41:19] to do. When they make a mistake, they
[41:21] get back up again. They don't quit. Come
[41:24] on, church. It's somebody who won't
[41:26] quit. Somebody who won't give up.
[41:28] Somebody who won't give in to the devil.
[41:30] How many of those have we got this
[41:31] morning? You still live in a body of
[41:33] humiliation. But you don't have to give
[41:35] into it. You don't have to give up when
[41:37] the going gets rough. That's a time for
[41:40] you to get going and get moving and
[41:42] begin to move on in faith and believe
[41:44] what God said. Anybody can believe God
[41:46] when everything's going good. But what
[41:48] about when it's rough?
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Right. You see men of God,
[41:58] &gt;&gt; men of God who have come to a place of
[42:00] maturity in their lives and you look at
[42:02] them and you think, "Oh, you know,
[42:04] they're just on a different plane. They
[42:06] just haven't struggled like I've
[42:07] struggled." You don't know that.
[42:10] That's right.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; You see people that have come even in
[42:15] our church, some of these older deacons
[42:17] and some of our men that have come to a
[42:20] and not to sight our younger deacons,
[42:22] but our older deacons have been around
[42:24] so long that they, you know, you look at
[42:26] them and think, well, they must have
[42:27] been Superman. But you don't know what
[42:29] it took.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't know the process of
[42:36] making these men
[42:39] &gt;&gt; and their wives.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; I'm being very real with us this
[42:43] morning.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; See, we think that a manifested son
[42:46] would be somebody who who just had it
[42:49] all easy and they always made the right
[42:50] decisions. And no, but it's somebody God
[42:53] will deal with. See, he deals with us as
[42:56] sons. Paul says, "Are you going through
[42:58] a struggle or a trial or tribulation in
[43:01] your life?" It's because he's dealing
[43:02] with you as a son or daughter of God.
[43:04] And we ought to thank God every minute
[43:06] for that.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; But just remember what you are. You got
[43:10] to start somewhere. We don't become
[43:13] fullborn full-blown sons of God
[43:15] overnight. I know. I know. We We must be
[43:18] born again. We'll get into that this
[43:19] morning. You've got to be born again.
[43:21] There's got to be a change. But you
[43:22] don't you start at the bottom. You don't
[43:24] start at the top. Don't give up because
[43:26] of where you're at right now. Keep
[43:28] pressing the battle. keep moving
[43:30] forward.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; The problem is people are proud and they
[43:38] think that the whole church will look
[43:39] down on them if they admit to having
[43:42] gone through something. And the truth is
[43:43] the whole church has been through it.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz people are human.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to speak to the storm,
[43:54] myself included. And sometimes we do and
[43:57] God vindicates it and blesses it.
[43:59] Everyone wants to curse the fig tree and
[44:02] Jesus did. But do we have the character
[44:05] of Christ
[44:07] &gt;&gt; there to control those things?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've said it many times, but
[44:12] some of us, even us preachers, if we
[44:15] really had the power to speak people out
[44:17] of existence,
[44:22] &gt;&gt; would speak all the wrong people out of
[44:25] existence.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. If you really had knew and
[44:31] you really believe you had the power to
[44:32] speak somebody out of existence, how
[44:34] many times would you have done it?
[44:36] That's right.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; If you had the power to call 10,000
[44:42] angels and deliver you from trouble,
[44:47] we believe angels surround us. Did you
[44:49] know that
[44:49] &gt;&gt; the Bible says they they compass about
[44:52] those who are they surround those who
[44:54] who serve the Lord. That's right.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; We believe that today.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says if you can see
[44:59] beyond the veil of this flesh, you'd see
[45:01] angels at their position at every pew.
[45:04] And and yet we we realize that that's
[45:07] the case. And but if you had the power
[45:09] to call 10,000 angels, would you deliver
[45:11] yourself from the cross? And the answer
[45:13] for most of us is yes.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I would get myself out of this
[45:20] trouble. I'd just quit.
[45:25] But the exit is not always the easy way
[45:28] out. That's right.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Right. The closest exit is not always
[45:32] the easy way out. If you guys go out
[45:34] this door, that's not the easy way out
[45:36] of the church.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; We had a prayer line one time and
[45:39] somebody headed out that door after they
[45:41] got prayed for around that time. And
[45:43] that is not the easy way out of the
[45:45] church because there's rocks out there.
[45:46] There's a hill out there and if you're
[45:48] out there at night in the dark, you
[45:50] might get hurt.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; You probably will be. The closest exit
[45:53] is not the easy way out of your problem.
[45:55] But we need to get to a place of
[45:57] maturity until we're not looking for
[45:59] exits, but we're saying, "Lord, whatever
[46:00] you're dealing with me on in my life,
[46:02] let me accept that. Let me let me let me
[46:05] be able to deal with that. Let me let me
[46:08] submit myself to your will and to your
[46:10] way."
[46:11] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that this
[46:12] morning?
[46:14] &gt;&gt; See, the greatest anointing that was
[46:15] ever on a man was not a man that was
[46:18] screaming and and shouting. Brother
[46:21] Brandham said the greatest anointing
[46:22] that was ever on a man was when Jesus
[46:23] stood there that day and said this day
[46:26] this scripture is fulfilled. He sat down
[46:28] and began to teach the people. Brother
[46:30] Brandham said the anointing is not
[46:31] emotion. The anointing listen is supreme
[46:34] power in control
[46:37] &gt;&gt; knowing I love this exactly what and
[46:41] how. And what I really need so many
[46:44] times, Sister Karen, and and I know this
[46:46] is my in myself is what I struggle with
[46:48] as a pastor is what to say when and how
[46:52] to act when,
[46:54] &gt;&gt; right? And that's where we fail the most
[46:56] is in what to do and what to say and how
[46:58] to act and when to make a phone call and
[47:01] when to when to when to be abrupt and
[47:03] there's times we need to be we need to
[47:05] drive a point home and there's times we
[47:07] need to be careful and what to say and
[47:09] how. That's what the anointing is. And I
[47:12] can't explain it to you, but there's
[47:13] something about being in the pulpit.
[47:15] Sometimes you can deal with things in a
[47:17] way that you can't deal with even in
[47:18] person because you're under the
[47:20] anointing. And the Holy Spirit helps you
[47:22] to speak to a situation maybe that you
[47:24] don't even know about, but he's helping
[47:27] you do it anyway. It's supreme power and
[47:30] control, knowing exactly what and how.
[47:32] He said, "And that's what's here." Oh, I
[47:35] love that. That's what's here. Second
[47:38] Peter chapter 1. Let's turn there this
[47:40] morning because I've already used uh so
[47:42] much time in introduction. We'll just go
[47:43] on through uh this morning. We're just
[47:46] going to try to get to a portion of
[47:48] this. If you want to draw a direct
[47:51] equation between adoption, what we've
[47:53] been talking about is manifested sons.
[47:55] What would a manifested son look like?
[47:56] Well, he'd be the stature of a perfect
[47:58] man or a mature man. He'd be the image
[48:00] of Jesus Christ. He'd have the character
[48:03] of Christ. He would be a partaker of the
[48:05] divine nature. And Peter explains that
[48:08] in second Peter chapter 1. Simon Peter a
[48:10] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[48:13] To them that have obtained I like that
[48:16] that have obtained like precious faith
[48:18] with us through the righteousness of God
[48:21] and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and
[48:23] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[48:26] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[48:29] according as his divine power hath given
[48:31] unto us all things. Someone say all
[48:34] things.
[48:35] that pertain unto life and godliness
[48:38] through the knowledge of him that hath
[48:39] called us to glory and virtue. So
[48:42] there's something that the divine power
[48:44] hath given us. He's given us all all
[48:48] things. So we have it and yet he says
[48:50] add to it. Now he said whereby are given
[48:53] unto us exceeding great and precious
[48:56] promises that by these you might be
[49:00] partakers of the divine nature. How do I
[49:04] uh partake of the divine nature? By
[49:06] faith in the word. The great and
[49:08] precious promises is the word. And by
[49:12] believing the word, I can have faith to
[49:14] believe it. I and to accept it and it
[49:16] can come. I was uh listening last night
[49:19] to brother Donnie Reagan preach and he
[49:20] made a remarkable remarkable statement
[49:23] out at Bethl. I was watching to see if I
[49:25] could see Joel and the boys out there.
[49:28] And I I listened to that. He made a
[49:30] remarkable statement. He said it, you
[49:32] know, it's so easy for a person to catch
[49:34] an evil spirit. All they have to do is
[49:36] disbelieve,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; right? And if that's true, then what
[49:40] about on the other side?
[49:42] &gt;&gt; How how easy would it be to to receive
[49:45] the Holy Spirit if you really believe
[49:47] the word?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; We have exceeding great and precious
[49:51] promises. And by these we are partakers
[49:54] of the divine nature,
[49:56] &gt;&gt; right? We make it difficult sometimes,
[49:58] but it's actually quite easy. What we've
[50:00] got to do is say yes,
[50:03] &gt;&gt; right? Yes. This way, right? If you if
[50:06] you if you agree with the word, then oh
[50:10] God, that that makes things a whole lot
[50:12] easier because you're not going to cross
[50:14] the word. And if you know that in your
[50:17] heart, God can bless that and can and
[50:19] can give you the Holy Spirit. Now, and
[50:22] brother Bram tells us that full
[50:23] obedience entitles us to the token,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; right? And and so that's simply you say,
[50:29] "What is obedience?" Well, obedience is
[50:31] saying amen to every word. It doesn't
[50:33] mean you can do it on your own. You
[50:34] can't do it on your own. You can't quit
[50:36] smoking, quit drinking, quit quit
[50:38] running around with women. You can't do
[50:39] that on your own. You need the Holy
[50:41] Ghost to be able to do that. And and
[50:43] yet, how do you get the Holy Ghost? By
[50:45] saying amen to the word, by being
[50:47] obedient to the word. Do what you know
[50:49] to do. Walk with him in every in the way
[50:51] that you've been called to walk with
[50:53] him, and he'll lead you into great and
[50:55] promised land. Now look, he leads you
[50:57] into the fullness of the adoption. Now
[51:01] he said he's given us great and precious
[51:03] promises,
[51:05] precious promises. So I think the number
[51:08] one job of a preacher is to wave those
[51:10] promises over the people, right? Is to
[51:13] make sure that they understand that
[51:15] these promises are for you, right? These
[51:18] promises are for you. Not just healing,
[51:20] not just salvation, but everything the
[51:23] word says that you can be, that's what
[51:25] you can be. And so when God says
[51:27] something, then those great and precious
[51:29] promises that by these you might be
[51:31] partakers of the divine nature, having
[51:34] escaped the corruption that is in the
[51:36] world through lust or sinful desire.
[51:39] Brother Brand said, look here. He said,
[51:41] you escaped it. See who it's to? It's to
[51:45] the church. them who are in Christ has
[51:49] been exalted above these things. Not he
[51:52] exalted himself, but Christ brought him
[51:56] up. Christ brought him up. And so I know
[52:00] there's folks that believe the stature
[52:02] of a perfect man is something you work
[52:03] on, you work on, you work on, and one
[52:05] day you get enough faith and then you
[52:07] get enough virtue and eventually if you
[52:09] work on them all and God's satisfied
[52:11] with it, then he gives you the Holy
[52:12] Ghost. But it's the Holy Ghost from the
[52:15] beginning.
[52:16] that began a good work,
[52:19] &gt;&gt; right? And we need to be we need to be
[52:22] clear about that today. It's the Holy
[52:23] Ghost from the beginning. It's the Holy
[52:24] Ghost that justifies you.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that sanctifies you.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that fills you.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's the work of the Holy
[52:33] Ghost all the way through. God doesn't
[52:36] respond to our effort, but to our
[52:38] obedience to the word.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:42] So um the B said that's how we know we
[52:46] passed from death to life. He talked
[52:47] about a woman who got up and testified
[52:51] and she said I'm not what I want to be.
[52:54] She said but I'm not what I used to be.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And and he responds to that. Brother Ram
[52:59] tells that story. He said that's how we
[53:01] know we passed from death unto life.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; That's pretty simple, isn't it? Some of
[53:07] y'all struggle with, oh, do I have the
[53:09] Holy Ghost? Do I have this, that, or the
[53:10] other? That's how we know we passed from
[53:13] death unto life. I'm not maybe what I
[53:15] want to be. He's not finished working on
[53:17] me yet, but I'm not what I used to be.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, we look back to the
[53:23] pit where we was heed from. Oh, a year
[53:26] ago, it looked a lot different. 10 years
[53:27] ago, it looked a lot different. For some
[53:29] of you, 40, 50 years ago, you looked a
[53:31] lot different. But you're different
[53:32] today than you was then. You're better
[53:34] today, Sister Stephanie, than you was
[53:36] then. Why? Because you've been brought
[53:38] from death into life. You may not even
[53:40] even realize what happened at first, but
[53:42] God's been bringing you out.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Look to the pit where we was heed from.
[53:46] See, we're not what we want to be. We're
[53:48] not even what we ought to be. But one
[53:50] thing we're thankful for, we're not what
[53:52] we used to be.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're on the road. How
[53:56] many are on the road this morning?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:00] Hallelujah.
[54:02] So God is using these gifts that we read
[54:04] of in in Ephesians 4:11, these ministry
[54:07] gifts to build his temple, which is you
[54:11] and me. And brother Brown said, "It's
[54:12] God trying to condition his people so he
[54:16] can get from them what he created them
[54:19] for." That's a powerful thought, church.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; He can get from them what he created
[54:26] them for.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; He created you to be a ruler. He created
[54:31] you to be a king and a priest.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; He created you to uh to rule and reign
[54:36] with him right in the millennium.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; We read about that last week. He created
[54:42] you for that. Well, how are you going to
[54:44] get that kind of character,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to get it
[54:50] &gt;&gt; is by going through what you're going
[54:51] through right now.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's good.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; By going through the process and not
[54:55] jumping out. Right. like a Navy Seal
[54:59] trying to be, you know, becoming a Navy
[55:01] Seal. I forget how many of them fail in
[55:03] doing that. Most people who apply never
[55:06] become a SEAL,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Because what happens is they they they
[55:10] don't realize how tough it's going to
[55:12] be.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; But the toughness is because what they
[55:15] want is not a soldier who will give up
[55:17] when he faces a firefight.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; What they're wanting is somebody who run
[55:22] towards the sound of the of gunfire.
[55:24] somebody who will who go headlong into a
[55:28] battle. That's what they're looking for.
[55:29] So, so they make it intentionally tough
[55:32] because they're wanting a certain
[55:33] character at the end. Don't you realize
[55:35] what God's doing today? He's made life.
[55:38] He's allowed troubles to come, trials to
[55:40] come. Many times we we even doubt and we
[55:43] we we go through struggles. We fall for
[55:46] a while and we get we get messed up in
[55:48] life and we struggle with our families.
[55:50] We struggle in our homes. What is God
[55:51] doing? He's taking us to something a
[55:53] character. Brother Joe that he wants us
[55:55] to be in.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Something that he wants us to be.
[56:03] He said he never made you to be
[56:05] something else besides a son and
[56:06] daughter of God. He said if you've
[56:08] missed that being a son and daughter of
[56:10] God, you've missed the mark. We put so
[56:12] much well I'm going to be this. I'm
[56:13] going to be that. I'm going to get this
[56:14] degree here. I'm going to be this in my
[56:16] life. But listen, he never made you to
[56:18] be something else besides a son or
[56:20] daughter of God. and he'll do whatever
[56:22] he has to do to heal you out
[56:25] &gt;&gt; and make you a son or daughter of God.
[56:30] Brother said if you miss that, you've
[56:33] missed the mark.
[56:35] Now the word sin means missing the mark.
[56:39] That's what that means. And brother
[56:40] Random illustrates that. He said if you
[56:42] take a gun
[56:45] and it's not tuned up. Now, I I have I
[56:49] have guns and I've shot weapons, but not
[56:52] like some of y'all have, but you know,
[56:56] if you if you if you don't have it tuned
[56:58] in, I'm not good at tuning in a scope or
[57:02] or making sure that it's right.
[57:04] Calibrating it, I guess, would be the
[57:06] word. I'm not good at that. And so, no
[57:09] matter how good a shot you are, if your
[57:11] weapon's not tuned, not calibrated
[57:14] correctly,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; you'll miss the mark. Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Right. So, Brother Brandham talks about
[57:19] that and talks about how that if you
[57:22] miss just a little bit up here, you're
[57:24] going to miss by inches down here. And
[57:26] inches might make all the difference.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Right. So many times what we're
[57:30] struggling with now is not because of
[57:32] now. It's because of something we failed
[57:34] to do years ago.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Right. And we didn't take the word of
[57:38] God seriously maybe. And so God just let
[57:40] us let it go. Let it go in our lives
[57:42] until finally because he's wanting to do
[57:44] something with us. So he lets us just
[57:46] follow our own will for a while and we
[57:48] find out we get to the target and we'd
[57:50] missed it by that much. How in the world
[57:51] did that happen because you started back
[57:53] here,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; right? And you got to go back and redo
[57:56] that. Retune that. But the Brandon said,
[57:58] "God put you here to be a Christian." He
[58:00] said, "If you're off to one side, come
[58:02] back and get tuned up."
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen to me, church. The altar is
[58:06] not just for sinners. The altar is for
[58:08] Christians.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; A pastor is not just for young people.
[58:12] But pastor, God give us a pastor for all
[58:14] of us.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we all need a pastor.
[58:18] Sometimes we all need a preacher.
[58:20] Sometimes we all need the church.
[58:21] Sometimes we all need one another.
[58:23] Sometimes we all need some help. There's
[58:25] no shame in asking for help.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Many times because of pride, we don't do
[58:32] that.
[58:33] And that's how we end up missing the
[58:35] mark.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I know one thing. If I was missing the
[58:39] mark and I needed to shoot something,
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I would find somebody who knows how to
[58:45] tune it up.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, "There's only
[58:50] one thing can tune you up, and that's
[58:51] the scripture."
[58:53] &gt;&gt; How many believe that today?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the scripture tune
[58:58] you, bring you directly onto the target
[59:00] again. I say, "God, tune me up this
[59:03] morning.
[59:04] make me right.
[59:07] We are see he wants us to be a living
[59:09] tabernacle
[59:11] of the living God. If we go back a book
[59:14] from first Peter or from second Peter
[59:17] rather to first Peter in our Bibles 1
[59:19] Peter chapter 2, Peter talks about this
[59:22] how we're to be living tabernacles
[59:24] of the living God. 1 Peter 2:1,
[59:26] wherefore laying aside all malice
[59:30] and all guile, in other words, let's be
[59:31] real with one another. must be truthful
[59:34] and hypocrisies and envys and all evil
[59:37] speakings
[59:39] as newborn babes. Desire the sincere
[59:43] milk of the word that you may grow
[59:46] thereby.
[59:47] Other words, let's not try to pretend
[59:49] what to be what we're not.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; If you're still on that faith level and
[59:55] you're struggling, you're trying to it's
[59:57] not say, "Well, so and so don't
[59:58] struggle, so I'll try to be like them."
[1:00:00] There's no merit in that.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; A pretend house is still a pretend
[1:00:05] house. You ever been on a movie set? Few
[1:00:08] years ago, we went to old Tucson and
[1:00:10] walked around the movie set where a lot
[1:00:11] of the old great westerns were made.
[1:00:13] It's just a set,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; It looks good, but it's a set.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; It's a false front.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; And if you're a false front Christian,
[1:00:20] you may look good in church, but you're
[1:00:23] still a false front. You're empty
[1:00:25] inside. You need to come back and find
[1:00:27] out what's missing. Yes.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many people end up in that
[1:00:31] condition. I I will say that all of us
[1:00:33] build false fronts from time to time.
[1:00:36] But he said, "Let's lay that aside." If
[1:00:38] we need to be a baby, if we need to
[1:00:41] desire sincere milk, say, "Lord, give me
[1:00:43] what I need."
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I've been around a long
[1:00:48] time, but where are you at in your
[1:00:49] life?" Let's take an honest appraisal.
[1:00:52] See what it is that we need
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; that you may grow thereby. If so be
[1:00:56] you've tasted that the Lord is gracious.
[1:00:58] So if you've even come to him and and
[1:01:00] you've recognized there's something
[1:01:01] about the message or something about the
[1:01:03] word that's helping you that's leading
[1:01:07] you, you've tasted the Lord is gracious.
[1:01:09] He said to whom coming as unto a living
[1:01:12] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:01:15] chosen of God and precious.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah. Ye also so he was chosen of
[1:01:23] God and precious. You also as lively
[1:01:26] stones were living stones are built up a
[1:01:30] spiritual house, a holy priesthood to
[1:01:35] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:01:38] to God by Jesus Christ. You are both the
[1:01:41] temple and the priesthood. Amen. To
[1:01:44] offer up a spiritual sacrifice in your
[1:01:47] own temple to God. This is your purpose.
[1:01:51] It's your destiny. It's what you were
[1:01:53] born to be. All of us have a purpose.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, and I know we worry sometimes
[1:01:58] say, "Well, if I had a purpose, I
[1:02:00] wouldn't have gone through what I've
[1:02:01] gone through. If I had a purpose, I
[1:02:02] wouldn't have been born the way I was
[1:02:04] born or where I was born or the time I
[1:02:06] was born." Listen, God sometimes don't
[1:02:08] see. We He don't always show us. He
[1:02:11] don't always reveal in our birth or
[1:02:12] where we're at in our beginning of our
[1:02:14] life what we will be.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Look, look.
[1:02:19] Pharaoh was born for destruction. How
[1:02:21] many know that the Bible says that
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; he said he was fitted, he was a vessel
[1:02:25] fitted for destruction.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But Moses was born in Pharaoh's house.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Or rather, he was he was raised in
[1:02:35] Pharaoh's house.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So the house you were raised in.
[1:02:41] Come on. But he was of different a
[1:02:43] different gene,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; a different seed. The house you were
[1:02:47] raised in does not dictate what your
[1:02:49] future is. what God wants you to use you
[1:02:51] to be.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Right. And so just because listen, Moses
[1:02:55] was raised to be a Pharaoh. He was
[1:02:58] raised to harden himself against his
[1:03:00] enemies. He was raised to protect Egypt.
[1:03:02] He was raised to do that and all the
[1:03:04] arts of the Egyptians. He was raised to
[1:03:06] be a Pharaoh. But he could not be a
[1:03:08] Pharaoh because there was something on
[1:03:10] the inside of him. He was a failure as a
[1:03:12] Pharaoh. Listen to me, church. You'll be
[1:03:14] a failure if you're not in the will of
[1:03:16] God. Amen. That's right.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; No matter how worldly how much worldly
[1:03:20] success you had, Moses had conquered the
[1:03:22] world, but he was a failure and ended up
[1:03:24] killing an Egyptian and running for his
[1:03:26] life. And all he had to show for it was
[1:03:28] one dead Egyptian in the sand. Brother
[1:03:30] said, "One stinking Egyptian until he
[1:03:33] finally on the back side of a desert
[1:03:35] after 40 years of God building that man
[1:03:37] up, he finally become what God called
[1:03:39] him to be." Hallelujah. I got confidence
[1:03:43] this morning that God's doing that to
[1:03:44] some of us. We may be on the back side
[1:03:46] of the desert right now, but the pillar
[1:03:48] of fire is here. You can meet him this
[1:03:51] morning and it'll change your life.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Point you to your destiny.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You can't be a Pharaoh
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; if you're born to be Moses. Even if you
[1:04:03] live in Pharaoh's house,
[1:04:06] Jehovah,
[1:04:08] he had a body that he made
[1:04:11] both created the blood cell,
[1:04:14] the egg and created himself in the womb
[1:04:17] of Mary.
[1:04:20] He that was a body that he made. But
[1:04:22] Jehovah wants a redeemed body to live
[1:04:25] in.
[1:04:26] That's his purpose.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So he died so that we could live.
[1:04:33] And we are his building, his body built
[1:04:36] by his word. The Bible said, "A body
[1:04:39] according to scripture, a body has self
[1:04:41] prepared me. God dwells in the stature
[1:04:42] of a man, reflecting himself into that
[1:04:46] being." Perfect worship,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; perfect worship. What you're doing
[1:04:54] today, if you have the baptism of the
[1:04:56] Holy Ghost, is perfect worship. those
[1:04:58] who worship him. Jesus said, "The time's
[1:04:59] coming when they'll have to worship him
[1:05:00] in spirit and in truth." That's perfect
[1:05:03] worship. That's what he wants. God in us
[1:05:07] being his tabernacle,
[1:05:09] God manifesting. Second Peter chapter 1
[1:05:12] and verse five, let's look at this.
[1:05:13] Beside this, giving all diligence. So he
[1:05:16] says, "Pay attention to it.
[1:05:19] Pay attention to it."
[1:05:21] I I don't want you to pay attention this
[1:05:22] morning because the pastor's preaching,
[1:05:24] but because I'm reading the word of God
[1:05:26] and I'm trying to tell you the word of
[1:05:27] God, it's life to us.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; We pay attention to it. He says, "Give
[1:05:32] all diligence. Add to your faith virtue.
[1:05:35] To virtue knowledge, and to knowledge,
[1:05:37] temperance, to temperance, patience, and
[1:05:39] to patience, godliness, and to godliness
[1:05:42] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[1:05:44] kindness, charity or love. fruit. The if
[1:05:47] these things be in you and abound, they
[1:05:49] make you that you shall neither be
[1:05:51] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:05:54] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, so there
[1:05:56] are people who have a portion of this
[1:05:59] that don't even pretend to be
[1:06:00] Christians,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; right? They may have a little bit of
[1:06:03] faith. They might have a little bit of
[1:06:04] virtue, might have a little bit of
[1:06:06] kindness, right? But brother Brandham
[1:06:08] taught us that that was like a a
[1:06:10] blackbird sticking peacock feathers in
[1:06:12] them,
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; right? It looks good for a while, but it
[1:06:14] don't last and it's not complete. So you
[1:06:17] you there's got to be something happen
[1:06:19] that makes you eligible for these
[1:06:21] things. Brother Brandon said, "That's
[1:06:22] the way it is. Trying to manufacture
[1:06:24] Christianity, you can't do it. The first
[1:06:27] thing you've got to do is be born again.
[1:06:29] You've got to be changed."
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; And when you're changed, you become a
[1:06:34] new creation. He said, "Now you're
[1:06:36] getting right now." See, now you don't
[1:06:38] have to worry about the feathers. It'll
[1:06:40] take care of itself when you're born
[1:06:42] again. Listen, if you got to stick
[1:06:43] feathers on every time you come to
[1:06:45] church, then feathers are going to
[1:06:46] bother you the whole time you're in
[1:06:48] church.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not the real you.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; But how much better would it be to have
[1:06:53] a nature change and be able to come to
[1:06:55] church and just exhibit what God has
[1:06:58] already put in your life? I'm not
[1:06:59] putting on when I come to the house of
[1:07:01] God. I want to live that way every day.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, by the grace of God, we do. We
[1:07:05] don't. Our our religion doesn't stop at
[1:07:07] the door, but it goes home with us.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Goes to the job with us. goes everywhere
[1:07:12] with us,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; We're not reformers.
[1:07:16] Listen, we are not reformers. We don't
[1:07:18] do 12step programs to people who are
[1:07:20] unsaved.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's not our job to do that. There's
[1:07:25] people who do that. Do a good job. I
[1:07:27] don't begrudge them a bit, but we don't
[1:07:29] do that. We believe in a nature change.
[1:07:31] And then once your nature's been
[1:07:32] changed, then we begin to teach you the
[1:07:34] things of God.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; But let's get the nature changed first.
[1:07:37] See, because no matter how much you
[1:07:38] understand about the mysteries, and you
[1:07:40] might be attracted to that, I believe
[1:07:41] the word will catch the attention of the
[1:07:43] elect,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; right? It'll catch your attention, but
[1:07:46] you still need a nature change. You
[1:07:48] might be able to talk about it, but you
[1:07:49] still need a nature change. You might be
[1:07:51] able to argue about it and know what
[1:07:53] your favorite quote is and know all
[1:07:54] about the message, but you still need a
[1:07:56] nature change.
[1:07:58] Because no matter how how much you put a
[1:08:01] a skirt a tutu on a pig.
[1:08:06] That's kind of a funny image, isn't it?
[1:08:09] Put a skirt on a pig, put it out in the
[1:08:11] pig pin, it's going right back into the
[1:08:14] waller.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; You ever seen a dog I I think I think uh
[1:08:19] Esther's dog gets a bath every time Trip
[1:08:22] comes to our house.
[1:08:25] That may be the only reason she's
[1:08:26] keeping you around, bud. But
[1:08:30] but
[1:08:35] it seemed like that dog gets a bath
[1:08:36] every time. You know what that dog does
[1:08:37] when he gets a bath? He goes out in the
[1:08:40] backyard and he just rolls in the dirt.
[1:08:45] And the dust flies everywhere. Why? He's
[1:08:47] got the nature of a dog. He don't mind
[1:08:50] how he smells.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He don't care. That's the nature of a
[1:08:55] dog. He wants to be out rolling around
[1:08:56] in the dirt. Oh God, we just realized
[1:08:59] what a sinner is. Brother Brand said,
[1:09:00] "Don't begrudge a sinner." You know, he
[1:09:02] might be a drinker, might be a smoker.
[1:09:04] That's all he has to satisfy himself. We
[1:09:06] don't hate people because they do wrong
[1:09:08] things. That's
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; We don't look down on them because they
[1:09:10] do things that are wrong. But what they
[1:09:12] need is an experience with Jesus Christ,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; a a change of nature.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And no teaching can can give us that.
[1:09:22] But if you have that, you can believe
[1:09:25] for all things.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes, you know, we give up
[1:09:32] because we've had maybe even had a
[1:09:33] nature change and we we see some dirt
[1:09:35] still on us because we have to be washed
[1:09:37] by the word and we we get discouraged.
[1:09:40] Don't do that.
[1:09:43] Just keep letting yourself be washed.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; You're not who you used to be or you
[1:09:48] wouldn't be in church.
[1:09:53] Somebody's hearing me today. Yeah. You
[1:09:54] wouldn't be sitting here if you were who
[1:09:56] you used to be.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me today?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; But there's something that keeps drawing
[1:10:02] you back to the word. Drawing you back,
[1:10:04] pulling you back to the word. What is
[1:10:06] that? There's something in you has
[1:10:08] changed. Get into that. Surrender to
[1:10:10] that.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Let him become Let him Let him grow in
[1:10:13] you. Let faith and virtue and knowledge
[1:10:16] and all of these things grow up into a
[1:10:17] full grown Christian, a fully born son,
[1:10:21] a trueborn son of God.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; We're not reformers.
[1:10:26] The Bible says, "Therefore, if any man
[1:10:28] be in Christ, he's a new creature. Old
[1:10:30] things are passed away. Behold, all
[1:10:32] things are become new." But the brand
[1:10:35] taught us the old man doesn't understand
[1:10:36] supernatural things. He doesn't
[1:10:38] understand shouting. He doesn't
[1:10:39] understand speaking in tongues. Doesn't
[1:10:40] understand how we listen to the word.
[1:10:42] doesn't understand what we do. The old
[1:10:44] man doesn't understand that because they
[1:10:46] can't understand the kingdom until
[1:10:47] they're born again. He can't understand
[1:10:49] it. He said until that man is born
[1:10:51] again. Then when he's born again, then
[1:10:52] he's in line of fellowship because he's
[1:10:54] a new creation. He said that old
[1:10:56] suspicious
[1:10:58] doubting character he was
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; dead.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He said now he's a new creation. So you
[1:11:08] see, he don't have to add anything to
[1:11:10] his now because it'll automatically be
[1:11:13] added. So now listen, God's already been
[1:11:15] working in your life and giving you
[1:11:16] faith and virtue and knowledge, all
[1:11:18] these things. But you come to a place
[1:11:19] where he just adds it automatically.
[1:11:21] That's the token. That's the spirit of
[1:11:23] God. It just you just give in to it. You
[1:11:25] surrender to it and it just adds
[1:11:27] automatically. It grows in your life.
[1:11:29] Brother Brandon put it this way. He
[1:11:30] said, "It's like a tree." He said, "All
[1:11:32] you have to do is water it. It just
[1:11:34] pushes out branches and pushes out
[1:11:35] branches and gets bigger and gets
[1:11:37] bigger. You just never quit watering.
[1:11:39] One day it'll push out a branch and
[1:11:40] you'll you'll be in eternity. Then
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; what is it? You just you started
[1:11:45] watering it one day. You got to start
[1:11:46] somewhere.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; So
[1:11:51] teaching
[1:11:53] is for those who have the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:57] Most teaching is for those who have the
[1:11:59] Holy Ghost. Right? What we teach people
[1:12:02] who don't have it is how to get it.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; All
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; right. But people who do have it, what
[1:12:10] do we teach them? We teach them the
[1:12:12] word. We preach the word. And the word
[1:12:15] is powerful. It's a it's it's alive and
[1:12:17] powerful. It's a discerner of the
[1:12:19] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[1:12:21] it divides the the the bone and the
[1:12:24] marrow. The Bible says it makes a
[1:12:25] difference in our lives.
[1:12:28] See, but if you don't have the Holy
[1:12:30] Ghost, no matter how much you assimilate
[1:12:31] with Christians year by year by year,
[1:12:34] then you you don't have that you you
[1:12:38] don't have that ability to receive
[1:12:40] teaching. And so you always have that
[1:12:42] suspicious nature towards the message of
[1:12:44] the hour. John 14:26 tells us, "The
[1:12:46] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
[1:12:48] the father will send in my name, he
[1:12:50] shall teach you how many things?" all
[1:12:53] things
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:12:56] whatsoever I have said it to you.
[1:12:57] Brother Brandham said see you must come
[1:12:58] under teaching. You say I don't need no
[1:13:00] one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has
[1:13:02] come. My friend, he said that just gives
[1:13:04] me a little room to doubt whether you
[1:13:05] really got it or not. He said the way
[1:13:06] you're acting with it see the thing
[1:13:08] you're doing. He said if the Bible said
[1:13:09] the Holy Spirit is the teacher, why did
[1:13:11] the Holy Spirit put teachers in the
[1:13:13] church? He said to set the church in
[1:13:15] order the same Holy Spirit. So he
[1:13:17] explains it. He said we don't need any
[1:13:18] seminaries to go around a big bunch of
[1:13:20] men to look out these things. The Holy
[1:13:22] Spirit is the teacher. It's the teacher
[1:13:24] and it gives some fellow a gift of
[1:13:26] teaching. He said, "And then you must be
[1:13:28] subject to that gift." But you can't
[1:13:30] even receive that without the Holy
[1:13:32] Ghost. Neither can I preach it without
[1:13:33] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:35] Right? Are you with me now? So, I want
[1:13:39] to show that statue of a perfect man. I
[1:13:41] know we've gone through this before.
[1:13:42] Maybe some of you haven't seen it. And
[1:13:44] if you can't see that, if it's too
[1:13:45] small, I can send it to you later if you
[1:13:47] ask.
[1:13:49] But the statue of a perfect man
[1:13:52] is, and you can show that on the on the
[1:13:54] stream if you would. You can see it on
[1:13:56] there a little planer if you go back and
[1:13:58] watch. But the statue of a perfect man
[1:14:00] is these virtues that Peter mentions
[1:14:03] that come from the divine nature. And
[1:14:05] brother Brandham is inspired to put
[1:14:08] these into a pyramid form and and then
[1:14:11] he's inspired how they connect with the
[1:14:14] ages.
[1:14:15] So, you see where we're living? We're
[1:14:17] living actually at the top of that. And
[1:14:21] we're we're not living at the bottom.
[1:14:23] We're living in that Leosian age at the
[1:14:25] very end of that Leosian age during a
[1:14:27] time we call the bride age or the bride
[1:14:29] time. We're living at the very end of
[1:14:31] that. And so, we the Elijah has already
[1:14:34] come, right?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; We we believe that. And so, all things
[1:14:39] have been restored to us. The seals have
[1:14:40] been opened. The book has been open. And
[1:14:43] so we're living right at the top. And so
[1:14:45] that's where the age is. But the person
[1:14:48] has to grow up into the age.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? A person who's born in
[1:14:54] the age of Luther could only grow up
[1:14:56] into Luther. That was his potentials. A
[1:14:59] person who was born in the age of Wesley
[1:15:01] could only grow up into sanctification.
[1:15:03] Let me tell you, we don't believe the
[1:15:05] word's important. The word is very
[1:15:06] important. What you're hearing is very
[1:15:08] important because it's the word that
[1:15:09] grows us up.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right? And your potential
[1:15:13] today is not justification. It's not
[1:15:15] sanctification, but your potential is
[1:15:18] not even just the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost or the or the gifts of the spirit,
[1:15:21] but your potential is the rapture.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Right? It's the coming down of the
[1:15:26] capstone to the body.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's your po God. That's your
[1:15:30] potential is to head back on the body
[1:15:31] again. And it's by the word that we are
[1:15:34] matured up into that. So actually in our
[1:15:36] age because all the word they heard in
[1:15:38] Luther was just enough to make them
[1:15:40] justified. All they heard in Wesley was
[1:15:41] enough to make them sanctified. All they
[1:15:43] heard in Pentecost was enough to make
[1:15:45] them have the gifts of the spirit and
[1:15:46] run and shout and jump. But now we've
[1:15:48] reached an age where we can become
[1:15:50] fullborn sons and daughters of God.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; But you don't start as an individual at
[1:15:56] the top.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You start at the bottom. And that's
[1:16:02] where so many of us struggle with is
[1:16:03] right there at the bottom. Brother
[1:16:05] Jeremy, I thought of you this week as I
[1:16:08] was studying these things because
[1:16:09] sometimes a person that comes out of the
[1:16:11] world and some of you know brother
[1:16:12] Jeremy's testimony come out of the world
[1:16:15] and come to the message and was born
[1:16:17] again.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Right? I believe that with all of my
[1:16:20] heart because brother Jeremy's life has
[1:16:22] changed. And so you see that you you
[1:16:24] realize he's not what he used to be.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't know him back then, but I've
[1:16:28] heard the stories. Some of the stories
[1:16:30] get magnified, you know, over time. But
[1:16:33] but you know he's not what he used to
[1:16:35] be. And many of you have that
[1:16:36] experience,
[1:16:38] right? You've been out there and but
[1:16:40] it's easier for you many times to take
[1:16:42] that first step
[1:16:45] to have that faith because there's such
[1:16:47] a clear line.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Between what you was,
[1:16:53] right?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; So you can believe because you know what
[1:16:57] you were
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and you know what you are. Yes.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; God's brought you from that. But some of
[1:17:04] our young ones raised in church and some
[1:17:06] of these young ladies and young men,
[1:17:07] they have a difficult time because I I
[1:17:10] did I was raised in church. And so that
[1:17:13] step of faith, I never left the world. I
[1:17:15] never went out in the world.
[1:17:17] Right? I still had to deal with a carnal
[1:17:20] nature.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I was still sinful. I told Brother Bill
[1:17:22] Stewart this morning, if I was a sinner,
[1:17:24] I wouldn't be a good sinner.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that right now. I'd be a
[1:17:29] really bad sinner.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I know what I would be without the grace
[1:17:33] of God.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; God has revealed that to me. I don't
[1:17:36] know that by experience.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I know that by God has shown me what you
[1:17:41] know. And sometimes you can tell just by
[1:17:43] the temptations that you have and the
[1:17:44] things that you have to fight and that
[1:17:46] you had to go through maybe even as a
[1:17:47] young person. But our young people many
[1:17:49] times they have a difficult time taking
[1:17:50] that step. That's why we want them. We
[1:17:52] we want them to go to camp. We want them
[1:17:54] to get in an atmosphere. We want them
[1:17:56] why would we preach against that? We
[1:17:58] want them to have an atmosphere of the
[1:17:59] Holy Ghost. We We want them to be born
[1:18:01] again. We want them to get right. We
[1:18:03] want to keep the altar open and give
[1:18:04] them a place to take that step of faith.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Right? You got to start somewhere.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And you and no matter what kind of false
[1:18:13] front you put up and what kind of
[1:18:14] appearance you've made to the church and
[1:18:16] assimilated as a Christian with the
[1:18:18] Christians, you still got to take that
[1:18:20] step of faith when you when you turn
[1:18:22] around and say, "Lord, I believe that
[1:18:23] you died for my sins. I believe that I
[1:18:26] can become one with your word. I believe
[1:18:28] the message of the hour.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; So it starts with a foundation of faith.
[1:18:35] So that's we're going to deal with that
[1:18:36] for a moment this morning and we're
[1:18:37] going to let you go. But the foundation
[1:18:39] is faith. Brother said you must have
[1:18:41] faith for a foundation. All
[1:18:43] Christianity,
[1:18:45] all you are,
[1:18:48] all you'll ever be is based upon faith
[1:18:52] in the word.
[1:18:57] It's not based on emotion. It's not
[1:18:59] based on a preacher. It's not based on
[1:19:02] anything else. Faith in the word.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says without faith, it is
[1:19:09] impossible to please him. For he that
[1:19:13] cometh to God must believe. Someone say
[1:19:16] must.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Must believe that he is. that he is a
[1:19:20] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:19:23] him. This is the foundation of your
[1:19:27] entire Christian walk, faith in the
[1:19:31] word. And that's why Satan will attack
[1:19:33] that over and over and over again, even
[1:19:35] as mature Christians. Many times he will
[1:19:37] attack faith in the word. He'll try to
[1:19:38] tell you the the Bible doesn't mean what
[1:19:40] it says. How many times has he done it?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Or or maybe it was for somebody else but
[1:19:45] not for you.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Trying to attack faith
[1:19:48] in the word. But I tell you this
[1:19:50] morning, if you can believe, all things
[1:19:52] are possible to them that believe.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; This is the foundation of your entire
[1:19:57] Christian walk. Everything, your family,
[1:20:00] your your your job, your all that we are
[1:20:03] as Christians. Are you with me now?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; This is the foundation, the beginnings
[1:20:08] of it
[1:20:10] is faith in the word. So, Brother
[1:20:12] Brandham, you know, he tells us a story.
[1:20:14] Now, there's a story that Brother
[1:20:15] Brandham tells. I appreciate you
[1:20:17] listening this morning. I just it's on
[1:20:19] my heart and I tonight we're going to
[1:20:20] have a baptism service after this and
[1:20:22] dinner. If you can stay for tonight, I
[1:20:24] got something on my heart for you
[1:20:25] tonight. Something completely different.
[1:20:27] But if you can stay, if you can't stay,
[1:20:30] watch that service.
[1:20:33] But you know, Brother Brand tells a
[1:20:36] story over and over again in the
[1:20:37] message. Uh you've heard it about a
[1:20:39] caribou and a grizzly bear, right? a
[1:20:44] caribou with horns 42 inches long and a
[1:20:48] grizzly bear
[1:20:50] that never had a mama,
[1:20:53] right? You know the story. I took these
[1:20:55] pictures myself in Tucson last time we
[1:20:58] were there. That's the grizzly bear that
[1:21:01] brother Brandham talked about. And on
[1:21:03] the right in that other picture is the
[1:21:04] caribou. That's an impressive set of of
[1:21:07] animals up there.
[1:21:09] On the right is that caribou that
[1:21:10] brother Brandham had or saw that was 42
[1:21:13] in long. The the tape was 42 in at the
[1:21:16] time and it was killed. There's actually
[1:21:18] a picture of that and brother Bisll
[1:21:20] actually I believe it was brother Bisl
[1:21:22] one of the young men that were there
[1:21:23] that held the tape that was there on
[1:21:25] that trip. Now brother Brandham talks
[1:21:27] about this and he he gives us he talks
[1:21:30] about it a lot and you know we tell
[1:21:34] hunting stories. Y'all tell hunting
[1:21:36] stories.
[1:21:38] I have one hunting story and it
[1:21:42] shouldn't be told and
[1:21:45] I'll tell you privately if you want to
[1:21:46] ask me later, but
[1:21:49] one hunting story my whole life
[1:21:52] and it was a mistake.
[1:21:55] But but some of y'all have hunting
[1:21:57] stories. You tell the hunting stories
[1:21:58] and and we tell them because we want
[1:22:00] people to know
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; we're pretty good.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Let's just be honest about it. You know,
[1:22:06] I do that with fish. The fish that I've
[1:22:08] caught grow every year,
[1:22:11] just a little bit.
[1:22:14] You know how you do? You hold the fish,
[1:22:16] you take the bass, and you hold it by
[1:22:17] the lip out like this and put the camera
[1:22:18] right in front of it and it looks like
[1:22:20] it's 25 inches long. You know, it's
[1:22:24] about that big.
[1:22:27] We tell hunting stories. We tell fishing
[1:22:30] stories. Brother Brandham wasn't just
[1:22:31] telling a story.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He's telling us something.
[1:22:35] They say that when in the 60s if you
[1:22:37] come to brother Brandham's house, he'd
[1:22:38] show you these and tell you about them
[1:22:40] almost every time. It was important to
[1:22:43] him. Brother Brandham explains in the
[1:22:45] statue of a perfect man why these
[1:22:47] stories were so important.
[1:22:50] He explains to us that when people come
[1:22:53] to see it, it built faith
[1:22:56] in those people to believe that God kept
[1:23:00] his word.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, brother Brandon said last
[1:23:04] evening some friends come in. They had
[1:23:05] heard that vision told about the caribou
[1:23:08] 42inch horn and the silver tip grizzly
[1:23:09] bear. He said I don't know how many
[1:23:11] people has come at the house wants to
[1:23:12] see that. I said here's the tape
[1:23:14] measure. Get on the horn. He heard it
[1:23:16] told before it happened. See why? When
[1:23:19] God says anything, it's got to happen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. He wasn't just
[1:23:24] telling a hunting story. He wasn't just
[1:23:26] trying to make it bigger and make it
[1:23:28] bigger. No, he didn't do that. He was
[1:23:29] trying to tell us something. God was
[1:23:31] telling us something in a way we could
[1:23:33] understand
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; because some of y'all understand hunting
[1:23:36] bear. You understand hunting caribou and
[1:23:38] you understand how how elusive they are
[1:23:40] and you understand how difficult it is.
[1:23:42] And so brother Brand was trying to tell
[1:23:43] us something. That grizzly bear appeared
[1:23:45] right where it was supposed to be. And
[1:23:47] that caribou it happened just exactly
[1:23:49] the way God told him it would happen.
[1:23:51] And he said I don't know how many
[1:23:52] people's come to see that. Here's the
[1:23:53] tape measure. He says why when God says
[1:23:56] anything it's got to happen. That's the
[1:23:59] reason he said it's based. So, it gives
[1:24:01] you something that you can base faith in
[1:24:03] that God kept his word,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; right? Faith is not in the grizzly bear.
[1:24:07] The grizzly bear is dead. It's as dead
[1:24:09] as any other grizzly bear. The caribou
[1:24:11] is dead. But God is giving you faith to
[1:24:13] believe in something not for brother
[1:24:15] Brandham's life, but for your own life.
[1:24:17] Listen, we're not talking about what
[1:24:18] brother Brandham did. We're talking
[1:24:20] about it's a foundation, something that
[1:24:22] we can build on and say, "If God did
[1:24:24] that for a prophet, if a son of God
[1:24:26] stood there and God told him something,
[1:24:27] he can do it for me."
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon says, he said,
[1:24:36] "Here's the plan. Here is the plan of
[1:24:37] salvation." How many believe that today?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You want to know how to be saved? Acts
[1:24:42] 2:38. Here it is.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And then if his vision happened
[1:24:47] perfectly exactly the way they say they
[1:24:50] do, hallelujah. You realize what God had
[1:24:53] to do. If you get a chance, go back and
[1:24:56] listen to Brother Wayne Lawson at Grace
[1:24:57] Tabernacle on Friday night. Brother
[1:24:58] Wayne preached a message about about the
[1:25:01] great high priest and he talked about
[1:25:02] how in Hebrews it talks about the
[1:25:04] discernment the word of God is a
[1:25:05] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:25:07] the heart and then he goes on to say
[1:25:09] Paul goes on to say seeing then
[1:25:11] oh hallelujah what was it a foundation
[1:25:14] of faith the discernment was for faith
[1:25:17] to build our faith not in brother
[1:25:19] Brandham but in the great high priest
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:25:24] he did a masterful job of preaching that
[1:25:26] sermon but Look, brother Brandon said,
[1:25:29] "Here's the plan of salvation." He said,
[1:25:30] "And this church knows that's right.
[1:25:32] What about his word? If he keeps the
[1:25:33] vision, what about the word?" He said,
[1:25:35] "That's more sure than the vision."
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "If the vision
[1:25:40] didn't speak with the word, then the
[1:25:41] vision is wrong." But it's the word
[1:25:43] first because the word is God. What if
[1:25:46] we could put that kind of confidence in
[1:25:47] the word?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:52] Hallelujah.
[1:25:54] But Peter says, "We have also a more
[1:25:56] sure word of prophecy, where unto you do
[1:25:59] well that you take heed as unto a light
[1:26:01] that shineth in a dark place until the
[1:26:03] day dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:26:05] hearts, knowing this first that no
[1:26:06] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:26:09] private interpretation. For the prophecy
[1:26:12] came not in old time by the will of man.
[1:26:14] But holy men of God spake as they were
[1:26:16] moved by the Holy Ghost." Oh, do you
[1:26:19] believe it, church? Do you believe the
[1:26:20] Bible is for you? that the scripture
[1:26:22] speaks about you. Do you believe you can
[1:26:24] become what it says you can be? Then you
[1:26:27] can become a fullborn manifested son or
[1:26:30] daughter of God in the age that we're
[1:26:32] living in. What does that look like? It
[1:26:33] looks like you.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; You got to believe that. You got to
[1:26:40] start with faith.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "First, you must
[1:26:46] be born again." And when you're born
[1:26:48] again, you have faith. You believe the
[1:26:50] word until you're born again, you'll
[1:26:52] argue against it.
[1:26:54] If you're just religiously inclined
[1:26:57] and you got a little human knowledge
[1:26:58] that you should do, right? You'll never
[1:27:01] be able to agree upon the word of God.
[1:27:02] You'll never do it.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You got to be born again.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; And born again, it produces faith. I
[1:27:09] love that. The new birth produces faith
[1:27:12] because it's the gene of God being
[1:27:14] manifested in your life. And in him is
[1:27:16] faith. He had to believe, brother Jaden,
[1:27:17] his own word to create the world. Oh
[1:27:19] God, if he was able to do that and that
[1:27:22] gene seed of God is in you and you
[1:27:24] tasted the good things of God, why
[1:27:25] wouldn't you believe for the good things
[1:27:27] of life? Why wouldn't you believe beyond
[1:27:29] this life for heaven? Why wouldn't you
[1:27:31] believe that he's going to keep you and
[1:27:32] help you and make you a different
[1:27:34] person? Listen church, if you begun, he
[1:27:36] was begun a good work.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He will finish it. You got to start with
[1:27:40] that foundation of faith.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Born again
[1:27:46] produces faith. After you get faith,
[1:27:48] this right here, faith,
[1:27:51] faith, then you're just in position of
[1:27:52] growing.
[1:27:55] A lot of people go up to the altar and
[1:27:58] pray and say, "Lord, forgive me." And a
[1:27:59] great experience of sanctification come
[1:28:01] upon them and things.
[1:28:04] He said, "Then you have a great time.
[1:28:05] Get up the altar shouting." You go back
[1:28:06] and say, "Bless God, I got it." No, you
[1:28:08] just started to a place where you can
[1:28:09] grow.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing yet.
[1:28:13] Only thing you done is just laid the
[1:28:15] foundation. He said, "Now you're going
[1:28:17] to build a house." You pour the
[1:28:18] foundation. Say, "Boy, I got her. You
[1:28:20] got the foundation to build your house
[1:28:22] on.
[1:28:23] Now you got to build a house."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; that's what you're doing right now.
[1:28:29] Right? You believed, but now you got to
[1:28:31] build a house.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; What is the foundation of Christianity?
[1:28:35] Faith in the word of God. That's your
[1:28:37] foundation. Then you begin to grow. Then
[1:28:39] you start. You begin to add to this
[1:28:41] foundation.
[1:28:42] See? And so he actually wants you to be
[1:28:46] him. He became us so that we might
[1:28:49] become him. So to be him, to be a fully
[1:28:52] manifested son or daughter of God that
[1:28:55] looks like him, he had to remove the
[1:28:57] veil of the law because it hid him
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; in tights and shadows.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; And he had to be revealed. The mercy
[1:29:06] seat had to be hung in plain view.
[1:29:08] That's right.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Paul says it this way. 2 Corinthians
[1:29:11] 3:18, "We all with open face, beholding
[1:29:13] as in a glass or a mirror the glory of
[1:29:16] the Lord are changed into the same image
[1:29:19] from glory to glory, even as by the
[1:29:22] spirit of the Lord." And you've got to
[1:29:25] be born again for this process to start.
[1:29:27] You find in the ancient times, Brother
[1:29:29] Brandham said they would beat gold. Are
[1:29:31] you still with me this morning?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; They would beat gold. And when they
[1:29:34] would beat gold, brother Brandham talked
[1:29:37] about how that they would and I went and
[1:29:39] read up on it. They would actually they
[1:29:40] actually take gold and they melt it and
[1:29:43] then they and then they get it real.
[1:29:46] There's still one family that does it in
[1:29:47] the whole world that that we know of
[1:29:49] that still does it the old way in
[1:29:51] Venice, Italy. And they'll take the gold
[1:29:55] and they'll they'll they'll melt it and
[1:29:57] and until it's liquid and then they'll
[1:29:59] they'll let it start to harden and then
[1:30:01] they'll they'll beat it really thin and
[1:30:03] then they get it thinner and thinner and
[1:30:05] thinner until it becomes gold plate
[1:30:07] until it's so thin that if you picked it
[1:30:09] up you'd it'd just crumble.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be that thin and that
[1:30:14] beaten out to be put to use. And so if
[1:30:17] you look at the they've restored the the
[1:30:19] famous statue in Venice, the the golden
[1:30:22] statue of Venice. They've restored that
[1:30:24] statue up on top of high building with
[1:30:27] that beaten gold. It's been beaten out
[1:30:29] in those sheets and it's so thin. Oh
[1:30:33] god, it it's looked like it would break,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; but it's exactly what they want it to
[1:30:37] be. Oh my. What are they doing? They're
[1:30:39] getting all the copper out of it and all
[1:30:41] the impurities out of it until it's
[1:30:43] absolutely pure gold. And and they make
[1:30:47] the statement. I watched a YouTube video
[1:30:48] on it. They make that the statement.
[1:30:50] They said when when the beaters get to
[1:30:52] beaten the gold and said the reason they
[1:30:53] still do it by hand, that one family is
[1:30:55] because no machine,
[1:30:58] oh God, no machine can do it like the
[1:31:01] hands. He said it just isn't the same
[1:31:03] product as it is in the hands of a
[1:31:05] master. Oh church, he didn't he didn't
[1:31:08] call mechanical devices to preach the
[1:31:10] gospel. There's nothing that can do it
[1:31:12] but the Holy Spirit moving and working
[1:31:14] and doing what he does and beating the
[1:31:17] gold.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; We've got to be in the hands of God so
[1:31:20] he can move us changes into what he
[1:31:22] wants us to be. Brother said that's the
[1:31:24] way God does. He takes the gold that he
[1:31:26] is found in the earth and he beats it by
[1:31:27] the Holy Spirit. Turn it over and over
[1:31:30] and over beating it until he receives.
[1:31:32] He can see his reflection.
[1:31:35] Why? Because he wants us to do his work.
[1:31:38] He wants to us to cover. Oh God, he
[1:31:42] wants us to cover. So he beats us all
[1:31:45] the impurities out of us until we can
[1:31:48] cover his people,
[1:31:51] till we can cover our families,
[1:31:54] till we can be put to his use.
[1:31:57] John 14:12 said, "Verily, verily, I say
[1:31:59] unto you, he that believeth on me,
[1:32:01] there's your foundation of faith. The
[1:32:02] works that I do shall he do also, and
[1:32:05] greater works than these shall he do,
[1:32:07] because I go unto my father. He didn't
[1:32:10] he didn't put you here to do nothing.
[1:32:12] Put you here to work.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Look, God put Adam in in in Eden to
[1:32:17] work. Do you know that? Look at Genesis
[1:32:19] 1 26. God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:32:21] image after our likeness. Let them have
[1:32:24] dominion over all of these things, the
[1:32:26] fish of the sea and the fowl of the air,
[1:32:28] every creeping thing that creepeth on
[1:32:29] the earth." Genesis 2:15. And the Lord
[1:32:32] God took the man and put him into the
[1:32:35] Garden of Eden to have fun.
[1:32:40] Well, I'm sure it was fun because it was
[1:32:41] perfect,
[1:32:43] but he didn't put him there just to have
[1:32:45] fun.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; The purpose of life is not
[1:32:48] entertainment.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I know it's the world that we live in
[1:32:52] today, but that's not the purpose of
[1:32:53] life. That's right.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Why sometimes God allows the razor backs
[1:32:56] to lose just so you can
[1:33:02] go through some trials.
[1:33:04] He put you here to work.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He put him in the
[1:33:09] Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[1:33:12] it. Oh, God. To dress it and to keep it.
[1:33:16] Even before the fall, he was put there
[1:33:19] to work. But his work was fruitful. And
[1:33:22] brother Brandon taught us how he did it
[1:33:23] is he spoke
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; and it appeared.
[1:33:27] Oh God, we are supposed to do the works
[1:33:30] of God. He put Adam in Eden to dress it
[1:33:33] and to keep it. He put us in Satan's
[1:33:35] Eden to do his works.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't put us here by accident. He
[1:33:42] didn't put us here just to survive. He
[1:33:43] put us here to do his works.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; He came in flesh and proved it could be
[1:33:47] done. So he gave himself as payment of
[1:33:49] the debt so true sons, born sons,
[1:33:51] manifested sons could walk the earth
[1:33:53] again. Hallelujah. Adam and Eve couldn't
[1:33:56] keep the word. Remember, they were in a
[1:33:58] perfect place and couldn't keep the
[1:33:59] word. But God said, "By the process of
[1:34:01] redemption," he said, "I'm going to come
[1:34:03] down and live in them." He said, "And
[1:34:04] I'm going to make them all such a part
[1:34:06] of me that this bride will keep the
[1:34:08] word. They will not fall. Don't you
[1:34:10] worry. They will not fall in the end.
[1:34:12] They may stumble many times, but they
[1:34:14] will not fall away."
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; They will not fall. Why? Because of
[1:34:19] grace.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Because the
[1:34:24] purpose of God in the end time is not to
[1:34:26] prove again that he's a redeemer, but to
[1:34:28] prove grace.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; So many of us, brother Brown said, try
[1:34:35] to do the works of Christ before the
[1:34:38] reflection of Christ is in us.
[1:34:41] Now there's the trouble.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; We find those things happening. He said,
[1:34:46] "You know it, and I know it. Everybody
[1:34:49] wants this or that or the other.
[1:34:50] Everybody wants to be in front of
[1:34:52] people.
[1:34:55] But do we? If we're going to do the
[1:34:56] works of Christ,
[1:35:00] as I said at the beginning, everybody
[1:35:02] wants to be like brother Brandham, wear
[1:35:04] a buckle, belt buckle and a hat and you
[1:35:07] know how it used to be.
[1:35:09] Everybody wants to do that. Maybe today
[1:35:12] it's turn change other things. We want
[1:35:13] to be like so and so at some preacher
[1:35:15] somewhere.
[1:35:18] Everybody wants to be that, but you
[1:35:19] don't know what it took
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; for God to get that man where he what he
[1:35:23] and make him what he became.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "We find those
[1:35:29] things happening. You know it. I know
[1:35:30] it. We see these stumbles along the
[1:35:32] road. We find the scrap peep of
[1:35:34] ministers of Christians piled along the
[1:35:37] road because they didn't go into it
[1:35:40] right.
[1:35:42] They went to do the works of Christ, but
[1:35:44] they did not have the reflection of
[1:35:46] Christ. I pray, oh God, let me first
[1:35:48] have the reflection of Christ in my
[1:35:50] life.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want a big ministry. I don't
[1:35:53] want fortune and fame. We don't want a
[1:35:55] great big church. What we want first is
[1:35:57] the reflection of Christ.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we get that right.
[1:36:06] So, there's the trouble. We find those
[1:36:07] things happening. You know what? I know
[1:36:08] it. Stumbles along the road because they
[1:36:10] didn't go into it right. Trying to do
[1:36:12] the work before we've been beaten into
[1:36:15] his image. And you say, "Well, I had an
[1:36:17] experience." That's good. I I can
[1:36:20] preach. That's good. I can sing. That's
[1:36:23] good. We want to use you.
[1:36:26] But don't get in the head of God. Wait
[1:36:29] till the beater gets you in shape to do
[1:36:32] the work.
[1:36:35] Now, Brother Brandham taught us like
[1:36:37] this. He said, he said, "Don't wait to
[1:36:39] be educated. If you have a testimony, go
[1:36:41] tell your testimony." That's right.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Don't try to preach the seals. Tell your
[1:36:45] testimony. You don't know how valuable
[1:36:46] that might be to somebody.
[1:36:50] I was lost, but now I'm found. My baby
[1:36:52] was healed. My I was healed. My my I
[1:36:55] know God like the little girl that was
[1:36:57] captured. You remember the story? And
[1:36:58] she went down there into Syria and she
[1:37:00] surrounded by enemies and and non her
[1:37:03] her her her master that her person who
[1:37:06] had her enslaved the naming the Syrian
[1:37:08] was sick. He got leprosy. And the little
[1:37:10] girl stood up and gave a testimony. And
[1:37:12] she said, "If you were in my country,
[1:37:14] you could be delivered of leprosy." Even
[1:37:16] though at that time, no one had ever
[1:37:18] been delivered of leprosy. But she knew
[1:37:20] that Elijah served a real God. Oh,
[1:37:23] hallelujah. Elisha served a real God.
[1:37:25] She knew that God was real. And so she
[1:37:28] testified. How many could testify today?
[1:37:30] He's still real. He's the same
[1:37:32] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; You can do something. He said, "Brother
[1:37:37] Brand said, if you got the candle lit,
[1:37:38] go tell how it got lit."
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; But wait on your ministry.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; See, when we're born again, that's when
[1:37:48] the battle begins. Brother Brandon said,
[1:37:49] "Here's what we do." What's the first
[1:37:51] thing? Have faith and be born again.
[1:37:53] That's laying the foundation. When we're
[1:37:56] born again, the battle begins. We need
[1:37:57] the shield of faith to win the battle.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; See, a manifested son of God, what does
[1:38:03] that look like? with someone who's
[1:38:04] shielded by faith in the word where the
[1:38:07] fiery darts don't have the effect on him
[1:38:10] that he would an unshielded or they
[1:38:12] would an unshielded person,
[1:38:15] right? That that that person that where
[1:38:17] you look at say, "Boy, they're so mature
[1:38:20] and so godly, such a saint." Well,
[1:38:23] they've just held up that shield of
[1:38:24] faith. It's not them that's doing it.
[1:38:28] It's Christ in them.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; The shield of faith. Listen, you young
[1:38:32] people, you can hold up your shield of
[1:38:34] faith.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6:16, above all, taking the
[1:38:37] shield of faith wherewith you should be
[1:38:39] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:38:40] the wicked. That word above all, we take
[1:38:42] that wrong because of modern English,
[1:38:44] it's not saying uh above all that it's
[1:38:46] the most important. What it's saying is
[1:38:49] covering all.
[1:38:51] Covering all, protecting all. Look at
[1:38:55] the amplified version. Lift up over all
[1:38:57] the covering shield of saving faith upon
[1:39:01] which you can quench all. Someone say
[1:39:04] all.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; The flaming missiles of the wicked one.
[1:39:08] See, if you can't defend yourself, you
[1:39:11] have no chance on the battlefield.
[1:39:13] You've got to be able to defend
[1:39:15] yourself. And Jesus found that when he
[1:39:18] was tempted, he was tempted by the lust
[1:39:21] of the flesh and the lust of the eyes
[1:39:22] and the pride of life. And yet none of
[1:39:25] it, the fiery darts were the same fiery
[1:39:28] darts that that the devil uses for us
[1:39:32] and it sticks sometimes and it burns us.
[1:39:35] Why didn't it burn him? Because he had
[1:39:38] the shield of faith,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; right? In the word.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; What did he do when when Satan said he
[1:39:45] said he said this is what you know if
[1:39:48] you're the son of God, you know, make
[1:39:50] these stones bread. And Jesus said it's
[1:39:52] also written.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Right? He had faith in who he was and he
[1:39:55] had faith in the word. Look, he was
[1:39:57] tempted the same way we were. Look at
[1:39:59] those pictures of the of the shield.
[1:40:00] That's the Roman shield that Paul was
[1:40:02] probably talking about. It's actually a
[1:40:05] a full body shield. And you can see in
[1:40:08] on on the on your left side, there's a
[1:40:11] formation. And the formation they could
[1:40:14] move through all the arrows that were
[1:40:16] coming at them. had they even had
[1:40:17] shields over their legs, armor on their
[1:40:19] legs, and they could walk through into a
[1:40:22] a storm of enemy fire.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Because they had the shield,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; the shield was curved so that it would
[1:40:32] bounce off either direction. It was
[1:40:34] built specifically to quench fiery
[1:40:37] darts,
[1:40:38] right? Because the enemy is going to
[1:40:41] send them. And this shield was built
[1:40:43] specifically to quench those darts.
[1:40:45] Listen. And so there was protection that
[1:40:48] they would actually get in a formation
[1:40:50] called the turtle formation where they
[1:40:51] would completely close themselves in and
[1:40:55] they could be protected and before they
[1:40:57] could reload they could rush the enemy.
[1:40:59] So there was a great uh advantage to
[1:41:01] being shielded and it was the Roman
[1:41:03] weapons more than anything else. Their
[1:41:05] their genius and weapons was able to
[1:41:08] make them conquer the world. And so they
[1:41:10] had these shields and Paul picks that
[1:41:12] up. He said it's the shield of faith.
[1:41:14] We're not covered by our feelings. We're
[1:41:16] covered by faith.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The thing that protects you is what you
[1:41:20] believe.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me this
[1:41:24] morning. That's the foundation of all
[1:41:25] that you ever will be as a Christian.
[1:41:27] What protects you is what you believe.
[1:41:29] Do you believe the message? Do you
[1:41:31] believe what God has done in our day? Do
[1:41:33] you believe in your brother and sister?
[1:41:35] Come on, church. Do you believe you're
[1:41:37] going to go in a rapture? Can't you
[1:41:39] believe? That's the foundation of what
[1:41:41] does a mature son of God look like? What
[1:41:43] does a manifested son look like? He
[1:41:44] looks like this. He's covered by the
[1:41:46] shield of faith.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; The Roman centurion. Interesting that he
[1:41:52] was a military man who would have
[1:41:54] carried one of these shields,
[1:41:58] commanded an army, but he come to Jesus.
[1:42:01] Remember the story? Come to Jesus and
[1:42:05] they said, "Oh, his daughter's dying or
[1:42:08] his servant rather, I believe it was,
[1:42:10] was dying."
[1:42:12] And the Jesus started to go to his
[1:42:15] house. Matthew 8:8 says, "The centurion
[1:42:18] answered and said,"Lord, I'm not worthy
[1:42:20] that thou shouldest come under my roof,
[1:42:22] but speak the word only and my servant
[1:42:24] shall be healed." What was it? He grasps
[1:42:27] the concept of faith. That's gentile
[1:42:30] faith. The kind of faith that comes by
[1:42:32] the Holy Ghost dwelling in you. Listen,
[1:42:35] that's the house of God. The house that
[1:42:37] God dwells in. Brother said, "Not a
[1:42:38] building with a big bell on top of it.
[1:42:41] But a body hast prepared me. A body God
[1:42:44] can talk in, God can work in. A living
[1:42:46] instrumentality of God. Your written
[1:42:49] epistles." The Bible says, "Rad of all
[1:42:50] men. And if the life that's in Christ be
[1:42:52] in you, you'll bear the life that Christ
[1:42:55] bore." Hurrying on. Now, he said, "Will
[1:42:57] you take us?"
[1:42:59] I had to include this quote. You forgive
[1:43:01] me. He said, "You take us, there's
[1:43:03] nothing but a wild gourd, a knad.
[1:43:07] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he that's what brother
[1:43:13] Brandon says about we're it's a wild
[1:43:14] gore to not head. See, and there's
[1:43:17] nothing to us for all dead in sin and
[1:43:20] trespasses. We're all in these kind of
[1:43:21] conditions.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; And then we ourselves can prostrate
[1:43:24] ourselves, give ourselves up until God
[1:43:27] takes his transfusion to the name of
[1:43:30] Jesus Christ because there's not another
[1:43:31] name under heaven whereby man can be
[1:43:33] saved and transfers the life of Christ
[1:43:35] into us. He said, "Then we have this
[1:43:37] kind of faith." The faith that Christ
[1:43:38] had and Christ's faith was not based in
[1:43:40] those Pharisees or Sadducees in their
[1:43:42] pots, kettles, and pants. Listen, our
[1:43:44] faith is not in long hair and long
[1:43:46] dresses. That's not where we place our
[1:43:47] faith. We place our faith in the word.
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was based on the word of
[1:43:55] God. Amen. So much until Christ was the
[1:43:57] word. The word was made flesh.
[1:44:00] And then when we can get so transfused
[1:44:02] by his power, we die our own thinking.
[1:44:03] Our faith becomes a genuine faith.
[1:44:05] Hallelujah. Then the life of Christ is
[1:44:08] transfused into us. Musicians go ahead
[1:44:10] and come. He said we become living
[1:44:13] creatures of God, a dwelling place where
[1:44:15] the Holy Spirit can send his radiant
[1:44:18] blessings down through there and we're
[1:44:20] in the stature of Christ.
[1:44:23] I got more to say this morning, but I
[1:44:25] think you get the point. And Steuart,
[1:44:27] somebody's got to break the cycle here
[1:44:30] of long-winded preaching, but
[1:44:36] What does a manifested son look like?
[1:44:40] His grown-up faith.
[1:44:45] She might tell me this morning say,
[1:44:46] "Bro, brother Ben, I just have a little
[1:44:47] child's faith." That's a good faith.
[1:44:51] It's simple.
[1:44:53] That's a good faith to have.
[1:44:57] Brother Brand or Jesus said, "Be like
[1:44:59] little children."
[1:45:01] Paul tells us to be like children.
[1:45:02] Simplicity. He said, "But be men in the
[1:45:05] word when it comes to the word."
[1:45:09] Say, "I got a little bit of faith,
[1:45:10] brother Ben."
[1:45:12] Well, just feed that the word.
[1:45:15] Feed it the word. I know you've heard
[1:45:16] that over and over again, but are we
[1:45:18] doing it, church?
[1:45:22] Are we doing it?
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:29] That's your foundation.
[1:45:31] And you let faith grow in you by feeding
[1:45:34] at the word. What word? Philippians 1:6.
[1:45:37] Being confident
[1:45:40] of this very thing,
[1:45:43] that he which has begun a good work in
[1:45:47] you, brother West. He begun something
[1:45:48] good in you. But you you just let that
[1:45:51] build. Feed that the word,
[1:45:55] right? Feed it the word. Negativity
[1:45:57] won't help you.
[1:45:59] The world won't help you. Entertainment
[1:46:01] won't help you. But the word will change
[1:46:04] you.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Feed your faith. The word. Feed it the
[1:46:10] message of the hour.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We still believe that
[1:46:13] God sent a message for a reason. Feed
[1:46:16] your faith the message.
[1:46:19] Feed your faith the Bible.
[1:46:21] feed your faith the good things of God
[1:46:23] by reminding yourself of things that God
[1:46:26] has said. See, because you didn't lay
[1:46:28] the foundation of faith. If you have
[1:46:30] even a little bit of faith today, he
[1:46:32] gave that to you. He provided you with
[1:46:34] that. And he his hands have laid the
[1:46:37] foundation, as we've said many times
[1:46:39] recently, and he will finish it. That's
[1:46:42] where our hope lays.
[1:46:47] You might not have much hope right now.
[1:46:48] And with every head bowed and every eye
[1:46:51] closed,
[1:46:53] those of you are watching, maybe you
[1:46:54] could bow with us.
[1:46:56] Bow your heads.
[1:47:01] You may not have much faith.
[1:47:04] You may not feel like there's any way
[1:47:07] out of your current situation. You
[1:47:10] You've said some or done something.
[1:47:11] That's not right.
[1:47:14] that he laid the foundation.
[1:47:17] Why don't you just believe him today?
[1:47:21] You see, the way out is not to be down
[1:47:23] on yourself or feel sorry for yourself.
[1:47:26] The way out of that pit is to believe.
[1:47:29] To believe.
[1:47:31] And when somebody throws dirt on you,
[1:47:33] you just walk on it till you walk right
[1:47:35] out of that pit.
[1:47:40] Hallelujah.
[1:47:42] Maybe you
[1:47:44] You just want to slip up a hand
[1:47:46] acknowledge to the Lord. Say, "Lord,
[1:47:49] I I may not be where I want to be, but
[1:47:51] I'm not what I used to be. Increase our
[1:47:53] faith, Lord. Increase my faith.
[1:47:56] Help me, Lord. My hands are raised. I I
[1:48:00] Lord, help me. I want to be a fullborn,
[1:48:04] mature son of God in an age when it
[1:48:08] calls us to that. We can live in that. I
[1:48:11] want to be able to speak and God back it
[1:48:13] up. Oh God, help me. God help me today.
[1:48:18] But got to begin somewhere. Let me begin
[1:48:21] by believing the word that I've been
[1:48:23] given. Heavenly Father or Jesus, I pray
[1:48:26] for our congregation today, Lord, for
[1:48:30] we're we're a church. It's not my
[1:48:31] church. It's ours. And every member,
[1:48:35] whether they're present this morning or
[1:48:36] not, they're part of that.
[1:48:39] I pray God that you would just most of
[1:48:43] all it's your church. I pray Lord that
[1:48:46] you would just come in every heart.
[1:48:49] I pray you would soften the the stony
[1:48:52] hearts. Lord,
[1:48:55] you're the only one that can do that. I
[1:48:57] I've tried so many times to change a
[1:48:58] mind and I couldn't change the mind
[1:49:01] because I couldn't change the heart. But
[1:49:04] Lord, you can change our hearts.
[1:49:07] Take away the old stony heart and put in
[1:49:08] a heart of flesh. That's not the even
[1:49:10] the new birth. That's just the
[1:49:11] beginning. I pray you'd grant it to us
[1:49:14] today, Lord. Oh, and if we had begun, oh
[1:49:17] God, if there's one here who's never
[1:49:19] begun, I pray they would begin today on
[1:49:21] that foundation of faith. If they've
[1:49:23] never begun, I pray, God, that you would
[1:49:26] just do that work in them. They have
[1:49:28] begun. I pray you would increase by the
[1:49:30] word every day, every hour until we
[1:49:34] leave here in the fullness of our
[1:49:35] adoption, in the change of our bodies.
[1:49:39] Pray you'd grant it today. We love you
[1:49:40] and we thank you in Jesus name.
[1:49:44] Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] Hallelujah.
[1:49:49] Hallelujah. If you seen that, Peter.
[1:49:52] Hallelujah. If you need prayer, the
[1:49:54] altar's open today. We've got a baptism
[1:49:56] service in just a moment. Listen, if you
[1:49:58] haven't been baptized in the name of
[1:50:00] Jesus Christ, the water's ready. We have
[1:50:03] a a young man wants to be baptized. Be
[1:50:06] glad to baptize you today.
[1:50:09] Hallelujah. Oh, this is my
[1:50:14] desire.
[1:50:16] Oh, could you sing it to him this
[1:50:18] morning? To honor
[1:50:23] you. Oh, can we stand together and sing
[1:50:26] it? Oh Lord, with all
[1:50:30] my heart, hallelujah,
[1:50:33] I worship you. If anyone else needs
[1:50:37] prayer, the altar's open now. Come if
[1:50:39] you need if you need prayer, we'll be
[1:50:40] glad to pray with you. Hallelujah. All I
[1:50:44] have within me. Oh yes. Oh, I give
[1:50:52] you
[1:50:55] praise. Hallelujah. Sing it now. All
[1:50:59] that I All I know
[1:51:04] is in you,
[1:51:15] Lord. I give you my heart.
[1:51:19] I give you my soul.
[1:51:25] I live for you, oh Lord.
[1:51:30] Every breath that I take,
[1:51:35] every moment I
[1:51:41] have your way.
[1:51:49] This is my
[1:51:52] desire.
[1:51:56] We honor
[1:52:00] you,
[1:52:05] Lord, with all my heart.
[1:52:10] I worship you.
[1:52:20] All I have
[1:52:23] within
[1:52:25] me
[1:52:27] are
[1:52:36] all that I know
[1:52:41] is
[1:52:52] Lord, I gave you my heart.
[1:52:56] I give you my soul.
[1:53:02] I live for you. my
[1:53:07] every breath that I take
[1:53:12] all the way
[1:53:21] in me. Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:53:27] I give you my soul.
[1:53:33] I live for you. I know
[1:53:38] every breath that I take
[1:53:44] my way.
[1:53:48] Lord, have your
[1:53:52] me.
[1:53:54] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:53:59] in my soul
[1:54:05] for you know
[1:54:10] everywhere.
[1:54:31] Let
[1:54:32] me walk with
[1:54:36] you Jesus.
[1:54:41] Holy
[1:54:52] without love.
[1:54:55] You are
[1:54:58] forever.
[1:55:02] Oh
[1:55:08] my god.
[1:55:36] Without
[1:55:38] you, I hallelujah.
[1:55:42] Would never
[1:55:44] Oh, don't you love him this morning? No.
[1:55:47] Never
[1:55:49] make it
[1:55:52] my home. Do we know those verses? Oh,
[1:55:55] let's sing one of them now. Oh, you
[1:55:58] found me
[1:56:00] when I was
[1:56:03] so lonely. You remember what that felt
[1:56:06] like, church, to be worthy of praise
[1:56:09] today. You found me when I was
[1:56:14] so blue.
[1:56:16] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, you found me
[1:56:22] when no one could love me. Hallelujah.
[1:56:29] Oh, when no one knew just what to do.
[1:56:38] Sing it now with all your heart. Oh,
[1:56:41] soul.
[1:56:43] Let me walk with
[1:56:47] you, Jesus.
[1:56:50] So great, Lord. Oh, don't ever
[1:56:55] leave me or leave me alone.
[1:57:00] For without you, oh for without
[1:57:05] you I
[1:57:08] I could never.
[1:57:13] Oh
[1:57:14] never
[1:57:17] make heaven
[1:57:19] in my home.
[1:57:22] We got a young man should be baptized
[1:57:24] today.
[1:57:26] Went to Acts 238.
[1:57:28] Christian baptism is in the name of
[1:57:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And we've seen a little revival among
[1:57:34] our young people, even the little ones
[1:57:36] that are old enough. And I'm thankful
[1:57:38] for that.
[1:57:41] We need a revival among the parents.
[1:57:49] Today, it's me standing in the need of
[1:57:51] prayer. I know all of us do.
[1:57:55] There's some serious needs. I know
[1:57:56] healthwise. in the church and we're just
[1:57:59] going to have prayer for little Luke and
[1:58:01] brother Stewart's going to baptize him.
[1:58:03] We'll just exit the building immediately
[1:58:05] after we're done here praying and we
[1:58:08] just go on out and the baptismal
[1:58:11] service. But
[1:58:13] we got some real needs people. Brother
[1:58:15] Bill Curtis
[1:58:17] real need in his body.
[1:58:20] Sister Cletus and just
[1:58:24] just doctors can't do a whole lot at
[1:58:27] that age. And so there's only God can
[1:58:29] heal them. Oh, we believe that he's not
[1:58:31] a respector of age.
[1:58:35] Brother JT has been in need for a long
[1:58:37] time.
[1:58:39] And some of you other elders, you suffer
[1:58:41] and things. Our young people, you keep
[1:58:43] praying for them. Pray for me and
[1:58:45] Brother Joel and Brother Stewart.
[1:58:47] We need to pray for one another. Our our
[1:58:49] couples, our married couples. The
[1:58:51] devil's doing everything he can to
[1:58:53] destroy our marriages in this day and
[1:58:56] destroy couples, destroy homes. But we
[1:58:58] serve a God that's able to help. But do
[1:59:01] you believe it today? Bible says, "Ask
[1:59:04] and you shall receive." So let's pray
[1:59:06] for all of these things together. Just
[1:59:08] lift up your voice to him in your own
[1:59:09] way. And I just believe God's going to
[1:59:11] take care of it. Heavenly Father, I pray
