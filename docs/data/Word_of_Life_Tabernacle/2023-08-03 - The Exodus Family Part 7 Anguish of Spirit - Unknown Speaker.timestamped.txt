[44:57] amen we've got kids day on a Saturday uh
[45:00] communion on Sunday remember that and um
[45:04] I wanted to let you know whether JT had
[45:06] a test today I don't think I told
[45:08] Brother David this but JT had a test and
[45:12] they had to put him under and and do a
[45:14] test and now they want to do more tests
[45:16] so let's be praying for brother JT and
[45:18] the folks there in West Plains as
[45:20] they're getting older but age is nothing
[45:23] to God aren't you glad of that but Bill
[45:26] I think they put your test off didn't
[45:27] they tell
[45:28] next week so we're just believing for
[45:31] good results and I believe you'll do for
[45:33] you what you've done for others and the
[45:35] testimonies that we've had and wasn't it
[45:37] wonderful the testimonies that we had
[45:38] Sunday and I believe there's more
[45:40] testimonies to be had and we just have
[45:43] to believe amen won't always be uh
[45:46] sunshine and Roses so to speak but the
[45:49] the way uh the way that we walk
[45:52] sometimes is is up up mountains and
[45:55] through valleys but there will be those
[45:57] moments when we know he's still God he's
[45:59] still the same yesterday today and
[46:01] forever and he is a Healer he is a
[46:03] savior and I'm thankful for that tonight
[46:04] turn with me to Exodus chapter 6 and
[46:07] verse 9. so many missing tonight but I
[46:10] trust that they're listening or watching
[46:12] if they're able
[46:14] Exodus chapter 6 and verse 9.
[46:22] it says that Moses speaks so unto the
[46:25] children of Israel
[46:26] but they hearkened not unto Moses
[46:30] for anguish of spirit
[46:32] and for cruel bondage I want to just
[46:35] take that
[46:36] as my thought tonight anguish of spirit
[46:39] as we continue to talk about the Exodus
[46:41] let's bow our heads together maybe you
[46:43] have a need you'd like to make known but
[46:44] we've uplifted hand tonight God sees
[46:47] every one of those needs my almost all
[46:48] of us have a need Heavenly Father Lord
[46:51] these needs that are represented here
[46:53] tonight it just would be overwhelming to
[46:56] a man
[46:57] but Lord you're you're not a man you are
[47:00] the almighty God we're so thankful Lord
[47:03] that you do not depend on on the whims
[47:06] of men or or the abilities of men or or
[47:10] even the uh Lord the the goodness of a
[47:13] man but Lord you are you are not bound
[47:16] to anything you are the all-powerful
[47:18] almighty God and we're so grateful for
[47:21] that today Lord we're so thankful that
[47:23] you if the doctor gives a bad report
[47:25] your report is still the same Lord if
[47:28] the world gives a bad report your report
[47:30] is still the same and we're grateful for
[47:32] that today I pray you'd meet every one
[47:34] of these needs I I pray for these
[47:36] families here tonight that you would
[47:38] bless them Lord for coming out to the
[47:40] house of God I pray you give him a
[47:42] double blessing Lord I pray for those

[47:59] for doing it even before the symptoms
[48:01] leave we thank you for it we love you
[48:04] and we thank you now in Jesus name amen
[48:07] God bless you you can be seated
[48:12] the word anguish in in the Hebrew is
[48:16] is to be ineffective to be short
[48:19] it's to be short of spirit
[48:21] to be ineffective to be powerless to be
[48:24] impatient it means to be utterly
[48:27] discouraged it means to be short of
[48:32] spirit impatient with God
[48:34] and I think all of us have gotten there
[48:36] at some point or another
[48:38] in our lives especially when it comes to
[48:41] our families and just our regular toil
[48:43] of life our regular way of life they
[48:46] were discouraged and and there was a
[48:48] reason why that they were discouraged
[48:50] it's because that things hadn't worked
[48:53] out under their message the way that
[48:56] they thought that it would and it caused
[48:59] a discouragement because they they had
[49:01] it all planned out of what was going to
[49:03] happen when Moses come up there and and
[49:05] they found out he was still alive for
[49:07] one and that he was to deliver and he
[49:09] comes up with a message an 80 year old
[49:12] man as we left him last time going up
[49:15] there to take over going down to Egypt
[49:17] to take over and he had to stick in his
[49:20] hand and he comes up there and shows the
[49:22] signs and does the things that he's
[49:24] supposed to do and what happens the
[49:26] people of God are all excited and
[49:27] they're thinking my goodness we're gonna
[49:29] we're gonna be delivered immediately but
[49:31] they weren't delivered immediately there
[49:33] was a gap there was a a delay in between
[49:36] the time that that they heard the mess
[49:38] message in the time of the deliverance
[49:40] and I think we could type that to today
[49:42] that we're living in a time when there's
[49:44] been a delay between our hearing of the
[49:46] message and and the actual Deliverance
[49:49] of the Rapture what we would call the
[49:51] full deliverance we believe we've we've
[49:53] come through in Exodus in the sense
[49:55] we've come out of denominationalism
[49:57] we've went into the Promised word and
[49:59] yet there's coming an even greater
[50:01] fulfillment what's happened in a
[50:03] spiritual type what's happened in word
[50:05] form got to become a reality one of
[50:07] these days and these bodies have got to
[50:10] be changed aren't you glad that there's
[50:12] a promise of that
[50:14] yet many times it's a discouragement
[50:16] it's a discouraging thing because we
[50:19] think well it's just not worked out like
[50:21] we thought it did
[50:23] and more people than what we realize
[50:25] maybe on the edge of of wondering well
[50:27] is the message true or not is it even
[50:30] for me does it even matter anymore it's
[50:32] hard to live like we live it's hard to
[50:34] do what we do doesn't even matter and
[50:36] I'm here tonight to encourage you to
[50:38] keep pressing on don't let your spirit
[50:40] get anguished don't let your your
[50:43] patience get short with God
[50:47] because when your patience is short you
[50:50] can't hear the message
[50:53] like it was intended to be heard
[50:56] so now
[50:58] go back if you go back to Exodus 4
[51:01] . and this is right where we left off
[51:03] last time in Exodus 4 27. that the Lord
[51:07] had spoke to Aaron this is after Moses
[51:09] is coming up from Egypt or from uh from
[51:12] the Wilderness into Egypt the Lord said
[51:15] to Aaron go into the Wilderness to meet
[51:16] Moses and he went and met him in the
[51:19] Mount of God and kissed him and Moses
[51:21] told Aaron all the words of the Lord who
[51:23] had sent him and all the signs which he
[51:25] had commanded him and Moses and Aaron
[51:27] went and gathered together all the
[51:29] Elders of the children of Israel and
[51:32] Aaron stake all the words which the Lord
[51:35] had spoken unto Moses and notice and did
[51:38] the signs in the sight of the people
[51:41] and the people believed how many
[51:44] Believers we got here tonight
[51:46] the people believed and when they heard
[51:49] that the Lord had visited the children
[51:51] of Israel that he had looked upon their
[51:53] Affliction then they bowed their heads
[51:56] and worshiped there was a time of
[51:59] worship because they heard the message
[52:01] yeah yeah and there was a message like
[52:04] they'd not heard before it was a message
[52:06] of Deliverance God said I've heard you
[52:09] God said I'm going to deliver you God
[52:10] said there's going to be a rapture
[52:14] and Moses proved to them that God was
[52:17] still alive
[52:19] here they they were going on they
[52:21] believed they were Believers maybe they
[52:23] believed in a yacht they believed in God
[52:24] uh Yahweh whatever it was that they
[52:27] called him by but they didn't know him
[52:29] they didn't really know his name as a
[52:31] deliverer they didn't really know his
[52:32] identity as a deliverer as a as the
[52:35] almighty God they knew him as a Helper
[52:37] but they didn't really know him as the
[52:38] God it was a God of War
[52:41] God who could defeat a pharaoh a God who
[52:44] could defeat Egypt the mightiest Empire
[52:46] in the world they didn't know him that
[52:47] way so this message came to show them
[52:50] that he was more than just a getting
[52:52] along God if we could say it like that
[52:54] more than just to get in by the skin of
[52:56] your teeth God but here was a God that
[52:58] was going to deliver them
[52:59] right that was going to make them a a
[53:01] bride without spotter wrinkles we could
[53:03] say it in modern terms that it was going
[53:04] to make them a people with like no other
[53:09] and he proved to them that God was alive
[53:12] by the signs the two signs that God gave
[53:15] him
[53:16] and so in Exodus 5 1 it says that if you
[53:19] like studying the scriptures I trust
[53:22] that you do we won't read every verse of
[53:24] this but maybe you'll have time when you
[53:26] go home it says afterwards Moses and
[53:28] Aaron went in and told Pharaoh thus
[53:31] saith the Lord God of Israel let my
[53:33] people go if they may hold a feast unto
[53:36] me in the wilderness
[53:37] and Pharaoh said who is the Lord
[53:41] that I should obey his voice to let
[53:43] Israel go
[53:44] I know not the Lord
[53:46] neither will I let Israel go
[53:50] now that may not have been exactly the
[53:52] the response that they had hoped for
[53:55] they may have hoped for a little bit
[53:57] better
[53:58] response now if you go down to verse 6
[54:00] Pharaoh instead of things getting better
[54:03] things begin to get worse
[54:05] and Pharaoh commanded the same day the
[54:07] task masters of the people
[54:09] and their officers saying you shall no
[54:11] more give the people straw to make brick
[54:14] as heretofore let them go and gather
[54:16] straw for themselves
[54:19] and the tale of the bricks which they
[54:20] didn't make heretofore the total you
[54:22] shall lay upon them you shall not
[54:24] diminish ought thereof for they be idle
[54:27] therefore they cry saying let us go and
[54:29] sacrifice to our god so he says in
[54:31] response to them asking to go for a
[54:34] break I'm going to make them work harder
[54:37] so they don't have time to think about
[54:39] God so they don't have time to think of
[54:42] oh don't you realize that same devil is
[54:44] working today that same devil is trying
[54:47] his best to get you where you don't have
[54:49] time to pray you don't have time to
[54:51] think about God you don't have time to
[54:52] go to church you don't have time to
[54:54] serve God in any way but I'm here to
[54:56] tell you there's a people of God that's
[54:57] going to overcome that in this day
[55:01] so he said I don't want you to think
[55:03] about a Deliverance message
[55:05] he knows if they talked about it brother
[55:07] Paul if they thought about it it had a
[55:10] power to deliver
[55:12] but as long as they just stay busy
[55:15] he could keep them in bondage
[55:18] so he said he said let there be more
[55:21] work be laid upon the men
[55:24] but they may labor there and let them
[55:25] not regard vain words
[55:29] let's make it look as if that'll never
[55:31] happen
[55:32] let's make life so hard it'll look like
[55:34] it'll let don't you realize that old
[55:35] Devil's doing the same thing today let's
[55:37] let's make them that's all the
[55:39] sicknesses of demons you blood pressure
[55:41] and blood sugar and all these things he
[55:43] wants to come into you your life for the
[55:45] day and he wants to bring it on you and
[55:46] say don't you see there will never be a
[55:48] Rapture there will never be a
[55:50] Deliverance but I serve in almighty God
[55:52] whose word has never failed he said I'm
[55:54] not a man that I should lie amen I'm so
[55:57] glad I served God and not a man
[56:00] God's word never fails
[56:03] but he said let's make them busy so they
[56:05] don't regard vain words
[56:08] let's keep them all we're going to
[56:10] preach a little bit tonight let's keep
[56:11] them so busy that they don't have time
[56:13] to look at the promises of God
[56:19] oh my
[56:21] verse 12 he says so the people were
[56:22] scattered abroad throughout all the land
[56:25] of Egypt together stubble instead of
[56:27] straw they couldn't even stay where God
[56:29] put them because the work had gotten
[56:31] harder so they had to go all over the
[56:34] land
[56:35] and they got split up that's what the
[56:37] devil's trying to do as well
[56:39] and the taskmasters hasted them saying
[56:42] fulfill your Works your daily tasks
[56:46] as when there was straw
[56:49] we'll see what they'll do with no
[56:50] Revival in the land
[56:52] we'll see what they'll do when they
[56:53] witness and nobody nobody he wants to
[56:56] hear it
[56:57] we'll see what they do and over and over
[56:59] again they come to church and it seems
[57:01] like the same old same old thing and it
[57:03] seems like they begin to get discouraged
[57:04] let's see what they do
[57:07] oh God
[57:08] that's where you'd be where the rubber
[57:10] meets the road that's when you begin to
[57:11] see those that are really faithful
[57:15] now look
[57:17] he said fulfill your daily task that's
[57:19] when they were strong they went to see
[57:20] Pharaoh they complained about it they
[57:22] said
[57:23] look you it's your fault it's your
[57:25] people's fault because they won't give a
[57:28] straw to make bricks
[57:29] verse 17 but he said you're idle you're
[57:32] idle therefore you say let us go and do
[57:33] sacrifice to the Lord
[57:35] go therefore now and work
[57:37] for there shall no straw be given you
[57:39] yet shall you deliver the tale of bricks
[57:42] the officers left that meeting kind of
[57:45] disheartened with the politics of the
[57:47] day
[57:49] probably look like some of y'all if you
[57:50] get done watching Fox News
[57:54] or get on your phone and listen to all
[57:56] the stuff that's going on or looking at
[57:58] it you get kind of discouraged when you
[58:00] go back from that meeting think there's
[58:02] never going to be there's not any hope
[58:04] this inflation is going to go through
[58:06] the room we're just gonna have to work
[58:07] harder and I'm never going to get to
[58:09] retire have you ever felt like that
[58:12] those are real thanks maybe on this
[58:15] spiritual sense you you begin to
[58:17] question me and think well all that's
[58:19] happened since I come in the message of
[58:20] the hour things have gotten worse things
[58:22] have gotten say well we didn't expect
[58:24] the world to get better did we didn't
[58:26] the prophets say it would get worse and
[58:28] worse until the end
[58:29] but the brides are going down the
[58:31] bride's going up so it depends on
[58:33] whether we're looking at the problem or
[58:35] we're looking at the promise
[58:37] so now they they come back and they told
[58:40] Moses they met him on the way Moses is
[58:43] going back up to pharaoh and here they
[58:45] come back and and they said all you've
[58:47] done is increase our burden
[58:49] Moses verse 22 returned unto the Lord
[58:53] and said Lord
[58:54] wherefore has so so evil entreated this
[58:57] people
[58:58] why is it that thou Hast sent me
[59:02] now think about this for a moment God's
[59:06] Prophet now don't think it's just you
[59:08] tonight
[59:09] you would get mixed up and we wonder
[59:11] what am I called to do
[59:13] what am I supposed to do am I even a
[59:15] believer
[59:16] is this message even right
[59:19] you say well I've never thought like
[59:20] that well praise God
[59:23] everybody's sitting around your house
[59:28] that's just the truth
[59:30] you may not have dwelt on it but at some
[59:32] point in your life those thoughts begin
[59:34] to come say well I wonder what's the
[59:35] point
[59:37] why be faithful when you can be
[59:39] unfaithful and be just as popular
[59:42] Why
[59:44] Live the way we do when you can be when
[59:47] you can live like others and I've heard
[59:49] it said well there's people who don't go
[59:50] to church at all and they're blessed
[59:53] there's people who don't who don't
[59:55] believe the message anymore and it seems
[59:57] like they're more blessed than they ever
[59:58] were but see God to many times God lets
[1:00:00] that go but there's coming a judgment
[1:00:03] day there's coming a Payday but there's
[1:00:05] also coming a Payday for the Bride of
[1:00:07] Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] there's coming a reward but we can't see
[1:00:11] that many times we look at what's going
[1:00:13] on and so he said Moses God's prophet
[1:00:17] begin to question
[1:00:19] why have you sent me
[1:00:21] I've come with the sign in the hand
[1:00:24] and I had to sign the other sign that
[1:00:28] you've given me as our Prophet was given
[1:00:30] the sign in the hand and then and then
[1:00:32] know the secrets of the heart
[1:00:34] and he said he said for since I came to
[1:00:37] pharaoh to speak in my name he has done
[1:00:39] evil to this people
[1:00:41] neither hast thou delivered thy people
[1:00:44] at all
[1:00:47] things just got worse
[1:00:49] you realize the prophet of God got in
[1:00:51] the same situation now some of you know
[1:00:52] the message you know what I'm talking
[1:00:53] about
[1:00:54] he began to question brother Allen
[1:00:56] whether his whether his calling what was
[1:00:59] whether it was over whether he was about
[1:01:01] to die whether he was washed up he even
[1:01:04] said well maybe I'm will they in the
[1:01:06] groundwork for somebody else to come
[1:01:08] and not knowing god was about to do the
[1:01:10] greatest thing he could do by moving his
[1:01:14] ministry into the third pole but he knew
[1:01:17] something was happening something was
[1:01:18] going to come but he goes to God in kind
[1:01:20] of this questioning manner what am I
[1:01:22] doing
[1:01:24] every time he said every time I cross
[1:01:26] the nation he said it gets worse
[1:01:28] I preach it and it gets worse
[1:01:31] oh but I'm so glad there's a people
[1:01:33] today that have responded to the word of
[1:01:35] God preached by a prophet
[1:01:40] Moses even began to question
[1:01:43] and brother Branham did that he in in
[1:01:46] gifts in 1956 he said I've been a little
[1:01:48] nervous
[1:01:49] he said because I've been since I've
[1:01:51] been up here I haven't been able to
[1:01:52] carry my texts and so forth and to
[1:01:54] minister like I should he said I've
[1:01:55] started something my meetings has always
[1:01:58] been a loaded for a long time he said
[1:01:59] I've seen it he talked about his mail
[1:02:01] dropping from 1500 letters a day to 15.
[1:02:05] the big draw
[1:02:07] he said because he just wasn't home he's
[1:02:09] too nervous he'd go out in the woods and
[1:02:11] and run around and they couldn't get a
[1:02:13] hold of him so they just quit writing
[1:02:16] he said now he met me again in 1957
[1:02:19] Jehovah Jireh said he met me some time
[1:02:20] ago several months ago and they're
[1:02:22] fixing to be a change in my Ministry he
[1:02:25] said it's a change for the better
[1:02:28] well of course when the people heard a
[1:02:30] change for the better they thought like
[1:02:32] we all did you know and well they're
[1:02:34] going to be more crowds it's going to be
[1:02:36] bigger stadiums there's going to be more
[1:02:39] people there's going to be more
[1:02:41] miraculous miracles
[1:02:43] which would be hard to do but you know
[1:02:45] the people after seeing what God did in
[1:02:47] brother Brandon's Ministry I thought wow
[1:02:49] this this next Ministry must be
[1:02:50] something great
[1:02:53] right but brother Branham didn't know
[1:02:55] what it was
[1:02:57] he said I keep feeling there's a change
[1:02:59] coming a change coming he said when we
[1:03:01] spoke of it but now he said he was
[1:03:04] talking to somebody about it he said he
[1:03:06] said it won't be a change in my Ministry
[1:03:08] because it can't be no more you
[1:03:10] understand he talks about how once God
[1:03:12] gives you a gift you always have it
[1:03:14] God don't take it away
[1:03:16] he said but it'll be a change in me
[1:03:19] amen now again brother by Adam he's
[1:03:23] inviting folks even to come and see he's
[1:03:26] telling them he said it's real close in
[1:03:28] 1959 he said it was so close I thought
[1:03:30] it was going to happen yesterday he said
[1:03:32] I believe it'll be right away now it'll
[1:03:34] be far beyond anything we've ever seen
[1:03:35] or heard he said now you remember that
[1:03:37] saith the Lord and we're just expecting
[1:03:39] it anytime
[1:03:41] oh my yeah you ever been like that
[1:03:43] you're not sure what God's doing but you
[1:03:45] know something's coming
[1:03:47] something's coming well I'll tell you
[1:03:49] what's coming the rapture's coming
[1:03:52] many times the things you know brother
[1:03:54] random didn't know and you may disagree
[1:03:57] with me here you have a right too if you
[1:03:59] want to that's fine you can disagree
[1:04:01] with me and maybe you're right but but
[1:04:02] this is what I what I see in the message
[1:04:04] is that brother Branham didn't know
[1:04:07] until after it happened
[1:04:09] that the change had even happened
[1:04:12] that it was in such a a way that he
[1:04:15] didn't even realize you can go and look
[1:04:17] at it he's still looking for that change
[1:04:18] and then he goes back he turns around
[1:04:20] and says that was it
[1:04:23] so it was after he after it happened
[1:04:26] then he recognized oh that was it
[1:04:28] sometimes we can't see what God's doing
[1:04:30] right now
[1:04:31] we looked for him over Yonder somewhere
[1:04:33] we looked for him back there somewhere
[1:04:34] and we can't see him in the middle what
[1:04:36] he's doing right this moment
[1:04:39] and so a prophet Being Human was was no
[1:04:41] different than we are in that way
[1:04:43] now brother Brandon said so far as I
[1:04:45] know every Vision he's ever given me has
[1:04:47] been fulfilled except the one that I'm a
[1:04:49] change in my Ministry where I'm to pray
[1:04:52] for people in a little place like a
[1:04:53] little room under a tent or a big
[1:04:55] Auditorium or something
[1:04:57] looked to me he said like a tent he said
[1:04:59] you remember that through two three
[1:05:00] years ago most all of it was brought to
[1:05:02] pass he talks about Mexico he talks
[1:05:04] about the vision of little fish but he
[1:05:06] knew there was something more
[1:05:08] than just the meeting in Mexico but he
[1:05:10] didn't know what it was
[1:05:12] yeah it's amazing that people other
[1:05:14] people knew that he didn't know
[1:05:17] right but now he said it made him
[1:05:19] nervous it made him anxious
[1:05:22] listen we're living in a time like that
[1:05:24] now
[1:05:25] I hope you I hope I can get this to you
[1:05:27] the way it is in my mind in my heart
[1:05:30] because we're living in that kind of a
[1:05:32] time when we're not real sure what the
[1:05:34] next step is
[1:05:35] and we see people over here saying well
[1:05:37] this is the bride's Revival and over
[1:05:39] here this is surprise Revival this is
[1:05:41] what we should be doing this is who we
[1:05:43] should be following and we realize that
[1:05:44] God has already been doing something
[1:05:48] amen one of these days You're Gonna wake
[1:05:51] up
[1:05:52] just walking in the door and you'll
[1:05:54] realize what God's been doing all the
[1:05:56] time
[1:05:56] and it'll be a day just like any other
[1:05:59] day it'll be a day just like Monday just
[1:06:01] like Tuesday just like Saturday whatever
[1:06:03] day that it is it'll be just like any
[1:06:05] other day and you'll be like you know
[1:06:07] you'll walk home with God
[1:06:09] and you begin to see your low aren't you
[1:06:11] looking forward to it but don't you
[1:06:12] realize you won't maybe notice the
[1:06:14] change but it happened you didn't notice
[1:06:17] that you were getting more sincere you
[1:06:19] didn't notice you were getting more
[1:06:20] desperate you didn't notice that things
[1:06:22] were changing but they were
[1:06:26] yeah Hallelujah
[1:06:30] don't lose hope don't get anxious don't
[1:06:31] get short with God
[1:06:33] during that time
[1:06:38] brother Brown thought he was going to
[1:06:40] die
[1:06:42] so did you ever think he was at the end
[1:06:43] of the road
[1:06:45] let's just be real Church
[1:06:49] said about eight months ago when I saw a
[1:06:50] vision at home and you know about it
[1:06:52] sirs what time is it I've seen that
[1:06:54] heard that blast go off in the vision
[1:06:56] seen seven angels come grab me I told
[1:06:58] you all this is probably the end of the
[1:07:00] road
[1:07:01] went to my wife and I said honey this
[1:07:03] may be my end I don't know
[1:07:05] he said how many has ever heard the tape
[1:07:06] well sure you know I said this saith the
[1:07:09] Lord something is fixing to happen I
[1:07:11] know not you know what it was he said
[1:07:14] something is fixing to happen he said
[1:07:16] and then I went to her and I said
[1:07:18] sweetheart I'll tell you what I want you
[1:07:20] to do now if this is my end God has
[1:07:23] showed a vision
[1:07:24] now listen he said he don't always tell
[1:07:26] you what it is
[1:07:27] he never told the prophets of the Old
[1:07:30] Testament or new testament what it was
[1:07:33] many times unless he wanted them to know
[1:07:36] they just wrote down see he said it
[1:07:38] wasn't none of their business
[1:07:41] oh my oh if we learned that we'd be a
[1:07:43] whole lot better off
[1:07:45] we'll be a whole lot less mad at God if
[1:07:48] we learn many times as what he's doing
[1:07:50] what he's working in the background what
[1:07:51] he's doing supernaturally many times he
[1:07:54] don't let us know listen when job begin
[1:07:56] to get in the position that he was him
[1:07:58] and everything come against him and job
[1:08:01] cried after God he said God if you just
[1:08:03] tell me why
[1:08:04] if you just tell me why then I would I
[1:08:07] would come and I would reason with you
[1:08:08] I'd sit down with you he said if you
[1:08:10] just tell me why God never did tell him
[1:08:12] why
[1:08:13] but what did he do he said I'm going to
[1:08:15] show you a redeemer and job got to the
[1:08:17] place where he said I know my redeemer
[1:08:19] lives and in the last days I was amen
[1:08:22] though the skin worms destroying my body
[1:08:24] yet in my flesh I shall see God he
[1:08:27] showed him a vision of redemption he
[1:08:29] never told him why he went through what
[1:08:30] he went through he may never tell you
[1:08:32] why the struggle he may never tell you
[1:08:34] why you've been through hell and back
[1:08:36] and why you went through the things you
[1:08:37] did Buddy he says you have a redeemer
[1:08:41] you have a redeemer and get a vision of
[1:08:43] your Redemption get a vision of the
[1:08:45] bleeding word
[1:08:55] he said it wasn't none of their business
[1:08:57] it's God doing something
[1:09:00] that's a whole lot different view of
[1:09:01] prophets than what we have sometimes
[1:09:02] isn't it
[1:09:06] yes
[1:09:08] after the opening of the seals he told
[1:09:10] him what it was
[1:09:13] you didn't tell me what it was while
[1:09:14] during the openings he tells him
[1:09:16] afterwards
[1:09:18] and yet you can find brother Brandon
[1:09:20] preaching it even during the seals but
[1:09:23] later he identifies it what it is
[1:09:26] he says remember the third poll was was
[1:09:29] the opening of them Seven Seals
[1:09:32] now when brother Brandon says the third
[1:09:34] poll he's talking about the change of
[1:09:35] his ministry it's the third pull of
[1:09:37] brother Banner's Ministry literally
[1:09:39] casting a fishing pole out in the water
[1:09:42] and you pull right he's setting the hook
[1:09:46] for the third time
[1:09:48] right first time he did it got a little
[1:09:50] bitty fish second time a little bit
[1:09:52] bigger fish but he's got his line all
[1:09:53] tangled up because he tried to explain
[1:09:55] him
[1:09:56] but he said you you can't do that you
[1:09:58] can't teach Pentecostal baby
[1:10:00] Supernatural things trying to trying to
[1:10:02] thread a half inch cord through a little
[1:10:04] baby shoe you remember the vision
[1:10:07] and so he and so he said this time he
[1:10:09] said he'll be it'll it'll be so humble
[1:10:11] that they won't even see it and they
[1:10:13] didn't
[1:10:14] the Pentecostal babies still don't see
[1:10:17] it right
[1:10:18] right but now what watch what happened
[1:10:19] he he said now now that it's happened he
[1:10:23] said the third pole was the opening of
[1:10:25] them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:10:27] truth that's been sealed in the word he
[1:10:30] looked back at it and you know with the
[1:10:32] benefit of hindsight you say why was he
[1:10:33] so anxious why was he so nervous why did
[1:10:36] God let him stew like that but he was
[1:10:38] testing his Prophet just like he tests
[1:10:40] you and I to see whether we'll hold
[1:10:42] strong to see whether we'll stay with
[1:10:44] the word
[1:10:45] I'm so glad brother Brown to stay with
[1:10:47] the word but he's not the only one
[1:10:48] that's got to stay with the word you've
[1:10:49] got to stay with the word and I've got
[1:10:51] to stay with the word
[1:10:57] God gave Moses two signs like he gave
[1:11:00] brother Branham
[1:11:01] he told that's what the angel come
[1:11:03] brother around he said I've given you
[1:11:04] two signs like I gave Moses
[1:11:06] Moses showed those signs
[1:11:09] all the people were excited
[1:11:12] now they didn't believe no more
[1:11:15] because of Anguish of spirit
[1:11:19] and then verse 1 of chapter six
[1:11:21] I want you to watch this
[1:11:23] then the Lord said unto Moses
[1:11:26] now shalt thou see what I will do to
[1:11:28] pharaoh
[1:11:30] Hallelujah for with a strong hand shall
[1:11:33] he let them go
[1:11:34] with a strong hand shall he drive them
[1:11:36] out of his land
[1:11:38] and God spake unto Moses and said unto
[1:11:41] him I am the Lord now watch real closely
[1:11:44] he said I appeared unto Abraham unto
[1:11:46] Isaac unto Jacob by the name of God
[1:11:48] Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I
[1:11:51] not known to them now so he said I
[1:11:53] manifested myself to them as God
[1:11:55] Almighty El Shaddai but not as Yahweh
[1:11:58] Jehovah
[1:11:59] see because they had not recognized him
[1:12:02] though they knew that his name was
[1:12:04] Yahweh but he had not manifested himself
[1:12:06] in that way as a deliverer as a mighty
[1:12:09] God of War and and all those things that
[1:12:12] they needed and so you see kind of the
[1:12:14] the lamb and the lion as well that here
[1:12:17] he had not shown himself yet as a lion
[1:12:20] and yet the lion is at work
[1:12:23] judgments coming on this world
[1:12:25] there's coming a day oh church we could
[1:12:28] just see what's going on behind the
[1:12:29] scenes
[1:12:31] right but when we look we see a lamb so
[1:12:34] now and remember the the first uh the
[1:12:37] very first of this of the Mysteries that
[1:12:39] begin to be unfolded was who got what
[1:12:42] God's name was
[1:12:43] how to baptize the very first Hallelujah
[1:12:47] very first mystery that was unfolded and
[1:12:50] it's the first thing he shows the
[1:12:51] children of Israel
[1:12:53] now he's and the Bible says whatever you
[1:12:55] do in word or D do all in the name of
[1:12:57] the Lord Jesus
[1:12:59] so that's that's what we worship under
[1:13:02] and now what was he going to do for them
[1:13:04] once they had the revelation of who he
[1:13:06] was now
[1:13:08] he tells them and if you're writing it
[1:13:10] down or if you want to keep it if you
[1:13:11] can remember it God bless you because I
[1:13:13] probably couldn't
[1:13:15] but there are three I haves
[1:13:18] in these next few verses three I have
[1:13:20] watched from he said and I have
[1:13:23] also established my Covenant with them
[1:13:26] to give them the land of Canaan the land
[1:13:28] of the pilgrimage wherein they were
[1:13:29] strangers he said you're not waiting on
[1:13:30] that yeah
[1:13:32] Hallelujah I have
[1:13:35] right he said I have also heard the
[1:13:38] groanings of the children of Israel whom
[1:13:41] the Egyptians keep in bondage
[1:13:44] they weren't delivered yet but he said I
[1:13:46] have heard
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:49] and then he says again I have
[1:13:51] remembered my Covenant
[1:13:54] I have established my Covenant I have
[1:13:56] heard their groanings and I have
[1:13:58] remembered
[1:14:00] my Covenant so the time is right now
[1:14:03] then he begins to say seven things that
[1:14:06] he says I will
[1:14:08] I will so there's three I haves and then
[1:14:11] seven I Wills I love the way God's word
[1:14:14] works and all fits together he said
[1:14:16] wherefore sand of the children of Israel
[1:14:18] I am the Lord is the first one I will
[1:14:20] bring you out from under the burdens of
[1:14:22] the Egyptians
[1:14:24] and I will read you out of their bondage
[1:14:27] and I will redeem you with a stretched
[1:14:29] out arm and with great judgments listen
[1:14:32] to this I will take you to be for a
[1:14:34] people when they were discouraged when
[1:14:36] they were down when they were despaired
[1:14:38] but here he says I will
[1:14:40] if they could have only seen the
[1:14:41] promises and not the problem
[1:14:43] he said I will be free to you for a god
[1:14:46] I will take you to me for a people and I
[1:14:49] will be to you a god you shall know that
[1:14:51] I am the Lord your God which brings you
[1:14:52] out under the burdens of the Egyptians
[1:14:54] and I will bring into you I will bring
[1:14:56] you into the land concerning the which I
[1:14:59] did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac
[1:15:01] and to Jacob and I will give you for
[1:15:03] inheritage
[1:15:04] I am the Lord these were their positive
[1:15:08] promises
[1:15:11] now look he showed the signs and he
[1:15:14] comes from the Joel with the word and he
[1:15:16] begins to preach to them I will I will I
[1:15:19] will but all they can see is pharaoh
[1:15:22] all they can see is making bricks
[1:15:24] without straw
[1:15:26] huh we gotta look up Church
[1:15:28] we got to look past our problems we've
[1:15:31] got to look past our circumstances once
[1:15:33] in a while you need to stay with the
[1:15:35] word you need saying what the word means
[1:15:38] more than just not being deceived it
[1:15:40] means to stay fervent about the word to
[1:15:42] remain in the word to keep feeding on
[1:15:44] the Promises of God you need to see he
[1:15:47] said I will bless you I will put you in
[1:15:50] a rapture
[1:15:51] I will do these things I will heal you I
[1:15:53] will save your children I will we have a
[1:15:55] positive message
[1:15:57] listen the Bible says all the promises
[1:16:00] of God someone say all all the promises
[1:16:02] of God in him are yea and in him amen
[1:16:05] unto the glory of God by us they're all
[1:16:07] positive
[1:16:08] not a negative one in them
[1:16:10] why because they're in him to us
[1:16:13] Hallelujah no negativity of all at all
[1:16:16] what did he say he said I have elected
[1:16:18] you I have called you I have heard your
[1:16:20] cry
[1:16:21] Hallelujah the enemy begins I will she
[1:16:24] said I will deliver you because the seed
[1:16:26] is not air with the shuck you see where
[1:16:29] I'm going now I'll read you out of the
[1:16:30] bondage of those broken sisters
[1:16:33] I redeem You by an invisible Union
[1:16:36] I will take you to me in the choosing of
[1:16:38] a bride
[1:16:40] future home
[1:16:42] oh my it makes me want to run all over
[1:16:44] the place tonight I will
[1:16:46] take you to your future home I will give
[1:16:49] you things that are to be
[1:16:52] but if we're not careful we can't see
[1:16:54] the I Wills because always dwelling on
[1:16:56] well things aren't like they used to be
[1:17:00] people aren't like they used to be well
[1:17:02] boy brother if you could have lived in
[1:17:04] my day I'm glad things aren't like they
[1:17:05] used to be because I'm another day
[1:17:07] closer to the Rapture I'm another year
[1:17:09] closer to the Rapture I'm living in a
[1:17:12] time of I will
[1:17:15] it's good can you see that I
[1:17:18] I don't think I'm stepping outside the
[1:17:20] word at all
[1:17:22] and saying that now
[1:17:24] these are positive promises to us
[1:17:28] oh
[1:17:29] it says in Moses
[1:17:31] steak so
[1:17:33] in other words God told it told him what
[1:17:35] to say
[1:17:36] and Moses said it
[1:17:39] I love that Moses was a man but he said
[1:17:41] what God Said
[1:17:44] Hallelujah
[1:17:45] oh they had to have confidence in that
[1:17:47] they could have confidence in the fact
[1:17:49] though he was a man yet he said what God
[1:17:51] said when he said what God Said
[1:17:53] if they just believe it
[1:17:56] it would change their circumstance
[1:17:58] because it's much easier to make bricks
[1:18:01] without straw if you know there's
[1:18:02] Deliverance coming it's much easier to
[1:18:05] adopt to live in pharaohs Egypt to live
[1:18:07] in Satan's Eden it's much easier if
[1:18:10] you've heard the seven I Wills if you if
[1:18:12] you've forgotten into the word of God if
[1:18:14] you believe the word if you if you've if
[1:18:17] you've listened to the taste you you've
[1:18:18] heard of prophet's voice and you know
[1:18:20] you say I know what he said life may be
[1:18:23] hard right now but I know God sent a
[1:18:25] prophet to tell me I will
[1:18:28] huh
[1:18:31] it doesn't mean anything to us
[1:18:34] I know it's Wednesday
[1:18:37] these things just struck my heart I
[1:18:39] believe God
[1:18:40] I don't believe God does that for me
[1:18:42] just for me I believe he does that for
[1:18:44] all of us
[1:18:47] they were literally
[1:18:49] too stressed to be blessed
[1:18:52] you've heard they're saying I'm too
[1:18:53] blessed to be stressed
[1:18:56] the children of Israel were in Egypt
[1:18:58] were too stressed to be blessed I wonder
[1:19:02] how many times we've come to church on a
[1:19:05] Wednesday night to stressed to be
[1:19:07] blessed
[1:19:08] and we got nothing out of the service
[1:19:10] because we're thinking about this and
[1:19:11] thinking about that and thinking about
[1:19:13] this person and thinking about how this
[1:19:14] went and thinking about that if you
[1:19:16] could just lift yourself above the mud
[1:19:18] lift yourself above the bricks look at
[1:19:20] well why did Moses why was he able to
[1:19:22] forsake the The Treasure of Egypt for
[1:19:24] for our people that were a bunch of mud
[1:19:26] daubers because he looked beyond that he
[1:19:28] looked to a God who said I will
[1:19:31] amen I will give you a future home
[1:19:36] I will heal you I will I will touch you
[1:19:38] all these things that he's promised us
[1:19:40] the Bible says Moses when he speaks on
[1:19:43] the children of Israel they hearkened
[1:19:45] not
[1:19:46] didn't say they didn't hear him
[1:19:49] they heard him
[1:19:51] but they just couldn't believe it
[1:19:54] because of anguish
[1:19:57] spirit
[1:19:58] and cruel bondage
[1:20:01] if your spirit is short
[1:20:04] you can't believe the promise of your
[1:20:06] day the message itself becomes
[1:20:08] ineffective to you
[1:20:10] because your spirit is short
[1:20:14] see he said my brother Ben I've gotten
[1:20:17] impatient in my spirit
[1:20:19] I've gotten to where I don't have the
[1:20:22] thirst and the longing that I used to to
[1:20:24] hear the word and and to get into the
[1:20:26] things of God and I just don't know
[1:20:28] where I stand right now
[1:20:29] I'm in this condition I see myself in my
[1:20:32] family I see us in this condition of of
[1:20:34] Anguish of spirit
[1:20:37] but how do you fix that
[1:20:39] by turning your eyes away from the cruel
[1:20:41] bondage
[1:20:43] looking at the promise and patiently
[1:20:46] waiting on the Lord
[1:20:50] Isaiah 40 and 27 Isaiah says this why
[1:20:53] say sorrow Jacob and speak as though
[1:20:56] Israel my way is hid from the Lord my
[1:20:59] judgment is passed over from my God this
[1:21:01] judgment is not in a negative sense God
[1:21:04] should have Avenged my enemies God
[1:21:06] should have made things right and they
[1:21:07] said it's not happened
[1:21:09] my judgment is passed over my way is hid
[1:21:12] God don't see me
[1:21:14] have you ever felt like that
[1:21:16] the children of Israel felt like that he
[1:21:19] said hast thou not known
[1:21:20] hast thou not heard sometimes we just
[1:21:23] need to be reminded don't we
[1:21:26] that the Everlasting God the Lord the
[1:21:28] creator of the ends of the Earth
[1:21:31] Hallelujah faith is not neither is weary
[1:21:34] there is no searching of his
[1:21:36] understanding did you ever think about
[1:21:37] it there's many places on the ocean
[1:21:39] floor that no man has ever been the
[1:21:42] other day some people died trying to go
[1:21:44] down to view the wreckage of the Titanic
[1:21:46] but before the Titanic was ever there
[1:21:48] there was somebody there God was there
[1:21:50] he's a God that knows the ends of the
[1:21:53] Earth he created the ends of the Earth
[1:21:56] the very deepest places of the earth not
[1:21:58] only that but the very highest places of
[1:22:01] the Stars places we've never even
[1:22:02] dreamed about yet God's already been
[1:22:05] there
[1:22:06] and not only that he's already been he's
[1:22:08] already seen our down sittings and her
[1:22:09] uprisings he's already been through he's
[1:22:12] already seen the sickness that we would
[1:22:13] have and how we would overcome him he's
[1:22:15] already seen our children go out and do
[1:22:17] whatever they've done but he also saw
[1:22:19] how they would come back he's already
[1:22:21] been there
[1:22:22] just because a man's not been there
[1:22:24] remember he said have you not seen have
[1:22:26] you not heard this is God we're talking
[1:22:28] about
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:30] the creator of the ends of your fainteth
[1:22:33] not neither is weary
[1:22:35] there is no searching of his
[1:22:37] understanding he giveth power to the
[1:22:39] faith oh I'm so glad for that tonight to
[1:22:42] them that have no might he increases
[1:22:44] strength even the youth shall faint and
[1:22:47] be weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:22:49] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:22:52] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:22:54] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:22:57] run and not be weary they shall walk
[1:23:00] and not faint
[1:23:04] towards the end of his life
[1:23:06] brother Branham kept telling the people
[1:23:08] wait on the Lord
[1:23:10] wait on the Lord be patient
[1:23:13] God's doing something
[1:23:16] he says this he said patience patience
[1:23:20] some of us I'm just going to turn around
[1:23:22] preach it myself
[1:23:25] some of us get so in such a hurry
[1:23:29] and God help us
[1:23:30] he said I think of many a good man has
[1:23:32] done that
[1:23:33] you get in too much of a hurry you want
[1:23:36] to see you want to do it yourself
[1:23:39] he said and Minister Brethren Minister
[1:23:41] brethren
[1:23:45] God help us tonight
[1:23:46] Minister Brethren he said you know from
[1:23:49] when I'm talking you that's listening to
[1:23:51] this tape he said I'm talking to you
[1:23:54] that's pretty direct isn't it
[1:23:56] he said I'm talking to you not only to
[1:23:58] the little congregation here but men
[1:24:00] around the world
[1:24:01] many men go out impatient
[1:24:06] right many men go out impatient but
[1:24:09] believing that the time is near you try
[1:24:12] to do something
[1:24:13] within yourself he said wait upon the
[1:24:16] Lord
[1:24:16] patience is virtue if you can have
[1:24:19] patience it's virtue it's virtue they
[1:24:21] that weighed upon the Lord shall renew
[1:24:22] their strength he said not they that try
[1:24:24] to get ahead of the Lord they that try
[1:24:26] to tell the Lord Lord I know you want me
[1:24:28] to do this glory to God don't do that
[1:24:31] wait upon the Lord the Bible said they
[1:24:34] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:24:36] their strength
[1:24:38] huh
[1:24:40] brother Brown's talking about now you
[1:24:42] just applied to your own life he's
[1:24:43] talking about the ministry he's talking
[1:24:45] about how a ministers on how many times
[1:24:47] did we see it over the years we're now
[1:24:49] looking back at many of much of this we
[1:24:52] look back and we see a man got in a
[1:24:54] hurry
[1:24:54] started preaching the Thunders for the
[1:24:56] virtues
[1:24:58] all right good men but they got
[1:25:00] impatient
[1:25:01] men got in a hurry and decided brother
[1:25:03] Branham had to come back literally in a
[1:25:04] tent
[1:25:06] because the Revelation has broken to him
[1:25:07] yet
[1:25:09] of what it was what actually happened
[1:25:11] and brother Brandon said it but they
[1:25:14] just couldn't see it
[1:25:15] good men God impatient
[1:25:19] but he's telling them he said patience
[1:25:20] patience wait
[1:25:24] listen he said I understood that in
[1:25:26] France this morning
[1:25:28] there's better than 2 000 Frenchmen on a
[1:25:31] several day fast that will come to bring
[1:25:33] the message to France
[1:25:35] he said in France the whole Protestant
[1:25:36] Nation Protestant part of the nation of
[1:25:38] France he said it just began blooming
[1:25:42] now
[1:25:44] I like this it's just begin blooming now
[1:25:51] I just
[1:25:52] I don't want to make this personal but
[1:25:54] this means so much to me he said just
[1:25:56] begin the Shucks I wasn't even born yet
[1:26:00] but look it was beginning to bloom
[1:26:01] something's been going on
[1:26:04] something's been going on God's been
[1:26:06] doing something while they were in
[1:26:08] anguish of spirit while they were
[1:26:10] worried about the outcome while they
[1:26:12] couldn't even hear the message
[1:26:15] oh God so many of them passed it over
[1:26:17] couldn't even hear the opening of the
[1:26:19] word
[1:26:19] could not hear the seven Thunders being
[1:26:22] uttered and the voices being could not
[1:26:25] hear God speaking to us
[1:26:28] you know what I'm talking about
[1:26:31] I look they just couldn't see it but how
[1:26:34] many times we get in the same place
[1:26:35] anguish of spirit short of spirit
[1:26:38] impatient
[1:26:40] well it's time for something to happen
[1:26:41] something is happening
[1:26:43] and you're a part of it
[1:26:48] Hallelujah
[1:26:49] something was going on God was fixing to
[1:26:52] judge Egypt fix to give him 10 plagues
[1:26:55] something was happening the wheels were
[1:26:57] already turning
[1:26:59] they just couldn't see it
[1:27:02] and brother Brandon says remember
[1:27:04] just began blooming now so just keep
[1:27:05] reverent he said keep praying see
[1:27:07] remember they that wait upon the Lord
[1:27:09] renew their strength
[1:27:11] he said now I was getting pretty old and
[1:27:14] I thought well will there be another
[1:27:16] Revival I'll see another time he said
[1:27:19] Just remember from the West Oh Come a
[1:27:21] white horse rider brother speaks about
[1:27:23] this white horse rider I don't have time
[1:27:25] to go into it but it's from a dream that
[1:27:27] someone had actually several dreams that
[1:27:29] were had they saw a white horse rider
[1:27:30] and one it was he was an Indian Chief
[1:27:32] and another he was a captain of the
[1:27:34] Cowboys and and they saw him writing and
[1:27:37] and he went off towards the west and and
[1:27:40] and and then come back from the west and
[1:27:42] he talked about that he said we'll he
[1:27:44] now in most places he talks about he
[1:27:45] said I'll ride this Trail again
[1:27:47] but in this place he says wheel
[1:27:50] ride this Trail again
[1:27:52] we'll ride this Trail again I don't get
[1:27:55] don't get nervous I'm not preaching no
[1:27:57] strange Doctrine just hang with me a
[1:27:59] minute
[1:28:00] have some faith
[1:28:03] he said we'll ride this Trail again
[1:28:05] that's right as soon as we get ready
[1:28:09] huh
[1:28:10] it's a promise you see
[1:28:13] oh my I've told you before God
[1:28:16] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:28:18] pass
[1:28:19] how did we know that brother Brandon's
[1:28:21] Ministry was over
[1:28:23] God took him home
[1:28:26] right his per his personal Ministry on
[1:28:28] the Earth was over because God said it
[1:28:30] was I didn't have anything to do with
[1:28:32] that you didn't have anything to do with
[1:28:34] that that's that was the end of his of
[1:28:36] him making tapes
[1:28:38] right that was the end of the revealing
[1:28:40] of the Mysteries that's how God revealed
[1:28:43] it he interpreted his word
[1:28:45] amen
[1:28:46] now watch
[1:28:48] it this word if you look at it it was
[1:28:52] not a prophet that went riding I don't
[1:28:54] know went riding from the west and went
[1:28:56] around the world again what was it this
[1:28:59] message
[1:29:01] it was his message that went out he said
[1:29:03] we'll ride this Trail again
[1:29:06] we'll ride this oh my it was the message
[1:29:09] that went out this message did not stop
[1:29:10] when the prophet died
[1:29:12] but the word has been writing around the
[1:29:15] world for more than 50 years
[1:29:18] and I got to thinking about this brother
[1:29:19] Joe because we were in Egypt last year
[1:29:21] about a year ago preaching to doing
[1:29:23] something that rarely gets done anymore
[1:29:25] because most people in the world have
[1:29:28] been reached by the message now
[1:29:31] and it's been greatly sped up by the
[1:29:33] Advent of the internet but most people
[1:29:34] at least maybe they haven't heard but
[1:29:37] they've had access to here
[1:29:39] it's in their language right and somehow
[1:29:41] God will find that last predestined seed
[1:29:43] I I don't believe the last one's been
[1:29:45] found because if it had been found we'd
[1:29:47] be going home
[1:29:48] we'd be home
[1:29:50] right but now it's been going on for 50
[1:29:52] years and when we were in Egypt I got
[1:29:54] thinking about that we were having an
[1:29:55] opportunity to preach the brand new like
[1:29:57] a brand new field it was wide open and
[1:30:01] the people were handing out books and
[1:30:02] giving them to people that had no access
[1:30:04] to it no access to the internet no
[1:30:06] access to in in their language
[1:30:07] translating the books and giving in
[1:30:09] their language and as we begin to do
[1:30:11] that I begin to think about this if
[1:30:12] brother Branham came back physically
[1:30:16] where would he go
[1:30:18] the message already went to France
[1:30:20] it already went to Africa what he was
[1:30:23] planning to do
[1:30:25] was to take this message that we have
[1:30:27] here which he said we now have by by
[1:30:29] Divine Vindication of perfect Revelation
[1:30:32] you know what I'm talking about the
[1:30:34] quote I'm talking about why why what
[1:30:36] would he do
[1:30:38] think about it
[1:30:40] you do the same thing that's been done
[1:30:43] you take it to the world
[1:30:46] oh God and we didn't even know it
[1:30:49] we've been part of that
[1:30:52] this little church has been part of that
[1:30:54] over the years taking the message
[1:30:56] overseas
[1:30:58] we've been poor we haven't just left it
[1:30:59] just to ourselves but we've been part of
[1:31:02] that you're part of that now you're
[1:31:04] taking the message to pick it you're
[1:31:05] taking the message to uh you're taking
[1:31:07] the message to Hardy you're taking the
[1:31:08] message to Cherokee Village you're
[1:31:10] taking the message to Thayer you're
[1:31:11] taking the message to Bono what is it
[1:31:13] what's God doing just by your everyday
[1:31:16] life thousands of lived voices are
[1:31:19] spreading this message
[1:31:23] infant bride grew up
[1:31:28] I Don't Preach like this very often but
[1:31:30] you just hang with me I'm almost done
[1:31:33] look brother Brian said I'm very
[1:31:34] thankful for these open doors
[1:31:36] I've had to go into the inspiration it's
[1:31:39] give to young men like your pastor here
[1:31:41] let's cause them as I'm beginning to get
[1:31:43] old know that my days are numbered and
[1:31:46] know now that these young men can take
[1:31:47] this message and sweep it on to the
[1:31:49] coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in
[1:31:51] my generation men like brother biscoll
[1:31:53] took that and said that's me
[1:31:56] right men like a young Tim Pruitt took
[1:31:59] that said that's me
[1:32:00] right men like that that's me a young
[1:32:03] Donnie Reagan said that's me
[1:32:05] right those men are I'm gonna get in
[1:32:09] trouble but those men are almost old now
[1:32:12] I qualified it's all right
[1:32:15] it's a memorial
[1:32:17] some of them I've even ceased the
[1:32:19] minister many have gone on brother Perry
[1:32:20] green many of those people that spread
[1:32:22] this message all over the world but
[1:32:24] they're we're still here
[1:32:27] somebody's got to keep writing
[1:32:29] somebody's got to keep preaching
[1:32:30] somebody's got to keep living it
[1:32:32] because these young men have got to
[1:32:35] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord
[1:32:38] see brother Brandon kept telling the
[1:32:40] people he said nothing's how to cater
[1:32:43] he kept warning on that and in 1965 it's
[1:32:46] very interesting if you go to listen to
[1:32:48] The Rapture message and then things that
[1:32:50] are to be and modern events made clear
[1:32:52] by prophecy that's three nights in a row
[1:32:54] brother Brandon preaches
[1:32:56] preaches the Rapture things that are to
[1:32:58] be modern events are made clear by
[1:32:59] prophecy December 4th December 5th
[1:33:01] December 6th
[1:33:03] and I can't find where he said this
[1:33:04] before
[1:33:05] but he starts saying it those three
[1:33:07] nights
[1:33:08] he said if God is infinite Almighty
[1:33:11] all-powerful
[1:33:12] I'm not president omniscient why he knew
[1:33:15] all things from the beginning
[1:33:17] so he knowed there's nothing out of
[1:33:19] cater
[1:33:21] it's just us that thinks it is
[1:33:24] again the next night things that are to
[1:33:26] be you are our little Minds cannot
[1:33:29] fathom what infinite means
[1:33:32] the infinite God he knowed all things
[1:33:35] somebody believes he knows all things
[1:33:36] tonight
[1:33:37] he said therefore there's someone say
[1:33:40] nothing
[1:33:42] nothing out of cater
[1:33:44] it's two again the next night by the
[1:33:47] mouth of two or three Witnesses of
[1:33:48] everything be established he said we
[1:33:50] think we're all out of cater but we're
[1:33:52] not
[1:33:54] everything's moving just exactly with
[1:33:56] God's word
[1:34:00] everything's moving just exactly less
[1:34:02] than three weeks later brother Branham
[1:34:03] was dead
[1:34:08] God's trying to tell us something Church
[1:34:11] there was nothing out of cater
[1:34:15] but there was a blooming going on
[1:34:18] an infant bride and one day she got big
[1:34:20] enough she started carrying it
[1:34:22] started taking it with her amen
[1:34:24] and they've carried it now for many many
[1:34:26] years and we're carrying it tonight we
[1:34:28] haven't quit we're not going to quit
[1:34:30] someone say Amen tonight we're not going
[1:34:33] to quit in face of opposition we're not
[1:34:35] going to quit because of some some
[1:34:36] website we're not going to quit I'm not
[1:34:38] gonna quit carrying this message why
[1:34:40] because this message is who I am this
[1:34:42] message is more than a Prophet this
[1:34:44] message is more than just a man it's
[1:34:45] more than a headquarters somewhere but
[1:34:47] this message is the word of God revealed
[1:34:50] Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's
[1:34:52] the I will what I will do to you I will
[1:34:55] give you a Rapture but the bill I will
[1:34:57] give you a new body I will give you
[1:34:59] healing I will give you salvation I will
[1:35:01] have a church like that first church
[1:35:03] there will be a bride without spotter
[1:35:05] Eagle I will I will I will we think
[1:35:08] everything's out of cater but nothing's
[1:35:10] out of gator
[1:35:12] Hallelujah all the time that the
[1:35:15] children of God were in anguish of
[1:35:17] spirit because of the conditions of The
[1:35:19] Exodus the wheels of Deliverance were
[1:35:22] already in motion
[1:35:23] judgment was coming on pharaoh
[1:35:25] the message had come
[1:35:27] they were going home
[1:35:31] yeah
[1:35:33] oh God
[1:35:37] Church
[1:35:39] their shortness of spirit did not change
[1:35:43] what God was doing
[1:35:47] they're anguished and their sadness and
[1:35:49] their worry and their did not change I'm
[1:35:51] so glad he's not dependent on me
[1:35:54] but I'm dependent on him
[1:35:56] he's doing it and he's doing it he's not
[1:35:58] just doing it but he's doing it through
[1:36:00] me and he's doing it through you yeah
[1:36:02] he's not just doing it but he's doing it
[1:36:04] through us
[1:36:06] in spite of our shortness of spirit the
[1:36:08] children of Israel did not know they did
[1:36:09] not realize they were going home
[1:36:12] that it did not change the word of God
[1:36:15] unbelief does not hinder God
[1:36:18] did not change it
[1:36:19] but how much better off would we be if
[1:36:21] we would just believe it
[1:36:24] it's good yes sir amen
[1:36:27] let's buy our heads together
[1:36:30] we're going home musicians wouldn't come
[1:36:33] we're going home
[1:36:40] I have to say Lord
[1:36:42] in spite of my
[1:36:44] shortness
[1:36:46] spirit
[1:36:48] in spite of my worry
[1:36:53] oh God
[1:36:54] fussing and fighting and carrying on but
[1:36:57] we're still going home
[1:37:01] in spite of the weakness of Flesh no
[1:37:04] matter how many ways they pick apart the
[1:37:06] message no matter how many ways they try
[1:37:07] to pick apart the God he still said I
[1:37:09] will
[1:37:10] I will
[1:37:12] he repeated what God Said I will
[1:37:16] Hallelujah and what can I do but believe
[1:37:19] it
[1:37:21] what can I do it may seem like it'll
[1:37:22] never happen it may seem like it's so
[1:37:24] far-fetched you raising young kids I
[1:37:26] know it's hard to look forward to a
[1:37:28] Rapture when you're facing you're
[1:37:30] raising little bitty children
[1:37:32] you're just trying to get them through
[1:37:33] the day you're just just trying to make
[1:37:35] it through the week it's it's hard to
[1:37:36] look forward
[1:37:38] I think sometimes for you Elders it's
[1:37:42] hard to look forward because you just
[1:37:44] get caught up in
[1:37:45] today I hurt today it's hard
[1:37:48] today I I can't remember like I used to
[1:37:50] I
[1:37:51] I can't do like I used to I wish I could
[1:37:54] I see the young ones and I think oh God
[1:37:56] have I just been left behind
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] but there's a body change coming
[1:38:03] there's a reality of the word of God for
[1:38:05] you
[1:38:07] you get caught up in what the insurance
[1:38:09] man's doing and what the uh what what
[1:38:11] the uh what what the Realtors do and
[1:38:13] what the what the pastors do and what
[1:38:15] the church is doing what other churches
[1:38:17] are doing but if we could only get back
[1:38:19] to the word and we'd hear a prophet of
[1:38:21] God speaking said I will give you a
[1:38:23] future home I will deliver you I'm Gonna
[1:38:25] Make You the head and not the tail I'm
[1:38:27] gonna I'm gonna give you the blessings
[1:38:29] of God I will restore saith the Lord
[1:38:31] what did he say I will
[1:38:33] he has never left us has he hasn't he
[1:38:36] hasn't he been good to us he been good
[1:38:38] to us over and over again when every
