the word of the Lord so good to have you all with us I wanted to do something this morning brother David White for many years has been our song leader here at the church and our main song leader and then we asked him to take a step back and and he went to Wednesday night and he's just done everything we asked him to do and I've been faithful in that position for many many years and then I recently asked him to if we could change up our Wednesday night service so brother David's going to be taking a backup role as a song leader you'll still see him but it's going to take a backup roll and that's a hard thing to do Brother David I appreciate your attitude and in doing that but David's been my right hand man here for I don't know how long I if I have something I need he said trustees a Treasurer and and he'll continue in that role as long as until the Rapture till we both go home that's the way we want to go isn't it go together so but I sure appreciate Brother David Brother David if you would come I've got something for you this morning I've got a a Bible I collect Bibles a lot of you don't know that I what I do is when I find one I like I buy it and then when I have a chance I give it away and that way it don't it don't accumulate dust because I have lots of Bibles but there's a card in there for you too brother David I appreciate you man appreciate your service to the church [Applause] some of y'all that are new or don't know but David's done that for years maybe 15 years here at the church and or longer and so we sure appreciate him and his willingness to to fit with the program and do what we need him to do and what the church needs I appreciate that amen do you love the Lord this morning you ready to hear the word brother Allen is going to at 1 30 today for those of you that want to come gather a bacteria he's going to do that teaching or part of it today going to begin it today I know there's some that wanted to be here that couldn't be here today but they're going to watch we are going to stream that so that you'll be able to watch that if you're not able to be in the building but if you can you got kids or whatever just leave them over there my wife will take care of them or yeah just leave them at the fellowship Paul they'll be all right we'll we'll make sure there's somebody to watch them if you want to come with your with your spouse and sit through that or or some of you single people may need that as well I know us married couples do and I'll be listening as well I've got some work I've got to get done we just had a really busy week but I I want to be listening as well because I I need it as well and and the Bible gives us answers for everything doesn't it and we just want to help you in every way that we can so that'll be at 1 30 today just got it back in while I'm singing or nothing and then we will have our service at three what I'm going to do I'm gonna stop at 10 till 12 this morning and then I'm just going to pick it back up but Bill laughed at me I'm gonna stop 10 till 12 and then I'm gonna pick it back up this afternoon and we'll just continue I just got one sermon really for today so we'll just do that amen you love the Lord amen God bless you let's stand together and read the word First Peter chapter 5 and verse 8. be sober be vigilant because your adversary of the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who has called you who has called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you so he says there's going to be a fight there's going to be a time of struggle there's going to be a time of suffering but then there's going to be a victory as well and I want to speak to you this morning on Victory in the battle of the Mind victory in the battle of the Mindless bow our heads together Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in your presence this morning so thankful Lord to know that you're with us that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord as I saw that yesterday on the wall of a hospital that we were visiting Lord I just struck my heart I thought oh if the world could even testify that you are the same yesterday today and forever what does that mean to us as Believers it means that anything is possible and that we are your your children Lord and we can have what we ask for we're so thankful for that today you've got it all in control Lord I pray that you'd bless this service take take me out of the way Lord and speak directly to your people God we want to help help people we we're not just here to just to speak or to be seen But Lord we want you to speak Lord we we realize we can only help so much through through carnal methods Lord we we want your Holy Spirit to come in and take over this service Lord and speak and Lord be the speaker be the hearer Lord and we pray that you would do it pray you would heal every sick person Lord those that aren't able to be here this morning I pray you'd raise them up Lord we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated this morning good to see brother JT back with us this morning God bless you good to have you with us today amen every one of us fight a battle in the mind it's not the battle of the Mind as much as it is the battle in the mind the battle is between Good and Evil and and it's the same battle that has been fought since the beginning of time since Satan fell it's there's been a battle and the Angelic battles brother Branham taught us became human battles and now there's a battle in the mind now we're involved in this battle it's a battle between good and evil and is fought for control of a place called the mind so that's the No Man's Land brother Branham told us that was selected for this battle to take place in so the battle is could I say it this way the battle is for you right it's a battle of Good and Evil and it's a battle for your soul yeah yeah it's a battle for you and so brother random said when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battleground began in the human mind so this is where where everything begins and so it's a no man's land it's a place where the battle is fought but I want us to think about it today this morning and this afternoon if the Lord is willing I want us to think about it as a place where the king dwells and so you're you're a three-part being your body Soul and Spirit and if you look at an old city a walled City they would always have an outer defense an inner defense and then on the inside there's a keep so it's like three rings of a circle there's an outer wall an inner wall and on the inside is the stronghold to keep and so we have a body we have a soul we have a spirit it's a walled City you can't just get in any way okay but the way that we access our body is by the five senses of the body so the five senses of the body are sight taste feeling smell and hearing yeah right we've all been taught that right so then but there are also five senses of the spirit so think of those senses as Gates right just to simplify for it so for us for me so that I could be able to understand it I thought of those senses as Gates brother Brown describes it as that in some places so there's Gates there's there's a gate of sight of taste the feeling of smell of hearing and then inside of that in that inner wall and in your spirit realm there's Gates there as well imagination conscience memory reason and affection so five gates of the body five gates of the spirit realm and then one gate to the soul and that gate brother Branham in different places he calls it Faith or doubt he calls it free will right so you you have the ability only you have the ability to let something in or out in the soul so now when you're born into the world so that there's a throne room that's the soul it's a throne room that's where the king is to dwell when you're born into the world as you reach the age of accountability battle begins and so there's fighting going on everywhere that all through these outer defenses they're they're just broken down they're uh we're not you know if you're not taught the word especially if you come up in a non-Christian home or you come up in a denominational realm there's just all kinds of battles going on everywhere and maybe you give in to different things you become addicted to certain things and and that all all that you're losing the battle all the time but there's got to come a place in your life where you're not losing the battle every time say brother man I'm fighting the battle of the mind I'm fighting the battle in the mind I'm fighting the Battle of Good and Evil but there's got to come a time when you begin to win some battles yeah still be in the war Satan's still going to come back and attack you but there's got to come a time you begin to win in that right and that's what we want to do don't you want to be a winner and not a loser well you are a winner and not a loser according to the word so we can have victory in the battle of the Mind so as you reach this age of accountability at some point God's word is introduced to you and somehow through these senses of the body and the spirit you know we know the word specifically is is introduced to us to the sense of hearing so we tell our children you need to be baptized you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit they hear that word right we we quote Acts 2 38 to him right repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we quote that to him and and they have to believe that and but but but that's in their mind it comes through their sense of hearing and maybe they'll be in the service atmosphere is important yeah because that all your senses are inlets and maybe they're in a service and they feel the presence of God they have a feeling they have a sense of the presence of God it's coming in through these Gates because and that's the kind of atmospheres we want our children to be around we want them to we want them because those Gates don't just let in bad things they let in good things so here our children are soaking this in and so maybe one day they feel the presence of God in a certain way and they repent of their sins and they ask Jesus to come in their heart and then they want to be baptized they want to start taking communion and and all of those things and begin to see that what's happening the battle's not over but there's been a victory in that battle there's been a victory that and now the the city The Walls Start to be built up and and it don't happen overnight it takes years but David over and over and over again we build and we work and we build and we work and God works on us yeah and it's hard sometimes it's tough sometimes but he's building he's doing something so now as we go through this battle that's the God's word is introduced into the battle and now there's a battle between faith and doubt the Bible says this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory so if you want to think about Victory what is victory in the battle of the Mind faith is the victory in the battle of the mind this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so the victory is faith faith doesn't bring the victory faith is the victory Amen in other words when faith is present you've won the Battle of the mind or the battle in the mind and yet there'll be another battle there will be many other it'll come over and over again but as long as faith is there in any given situation Faith overcomes the enemy how many believe that today it's faith that does that nothing else can do that the five senses of the of the body the five senses of the spirit but if you can ever get Faith on the inside in that keep on the inside when when the Holy Ghost when the king begins to Reign once there was no one it was just desolate and and there was no one there but now the the palace has been restored you were made to serve God there's a king sitting there and He Reigns and and there's faith that comes out right not Faith from the outside but Faith from the inside and that Faith again is increased by hearing the word so now Faith is the victory brother Brown said faith is the victory over death yes amen faith is the victory over sin Faith well what do I need to do brother men do I need to do Penance do I need to drag myself over logs no faith is the victory yes sir maybe I should punish myself in some way no what you need to do is have faith you need to believe faith is the victory over them faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over are you with me this morning faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world yes sir now he said faith is a conqueror Faith was not a passive thing faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes right so we don't make peace with the Enemy at the gates but we're watching to identify who that enemy is because every thought is a potential enemy right it's a potential enemy it's a potential friend and we have to decide by the word of God whether that thought is going to stay or whether whether it's going to be allowed across the border or whether you're going to kick it out right so faith is it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what is to conquer conquer in Victory is the same he said to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison right so we can say it this way when you're not saved when you when you're not filled with the Holy Spirit you're not born again there's nothing there's no Administration there's no government in your soul right so you you know anything can take place there's no law you you can oh I want to get rid of my smoking my drinking all these other things but you can't do it you're helpless because the law is law of sin it's the law it's the law of death right but there has to be the law of Liberty that comes in the law of Grace and God has to there has to be a an Administration set up that can then begin to run your life right it'd be a government that begins to run our life and it's not the government of man it's not even the government of the church although there is governments in the church but that's not what this is this is the government of Christ he is the king amen and his government the currency of that government if we can say it that way is faith that's what he Rules by now Faith is the victory he said he said it means the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you've whipped it you are greater than it is Hallelujah you don't always have to give in right right they don't always have to continue to be like it always was yeah but faith is the victory so he said faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil someone say Every curse oh but but brother Ben you don't understand my family my situation Every curse of the devil faith is the victory that overcomes that so he said uh he said faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it overcomes the world he said when you can climb into God by prayer until you seem to think conquered under you there's nothing can hurt you've overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're sailing free then faith is the victory he said you have been a drunkard and a slave to Whiskey you will be the master over him then hallelujah some of you can testify with that he said that Old Devil of alcohol that made you a drink he's your master now but when you get Faith he said I don't mean Make Believe real Faith he's your servant then you who can't lay down tobacco you women and men when it comes to a place where you can get to that spot where you have overcome it by faith you'll Master it then Hallelujah he said real Faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated just cutting out it cannot be defeated even death itself can't defeat it aren't you glad for that today even death itself can't defeat real faith amen faith is the victory faith has its own language do you know that everything else those defeat but Faith doesn't know the faith has its own language we need to learn the language of faith it has its own language but the brand talks about that he said if you go to a foreign country he said you wouldn't use a bunch of American slang right you wouldn't go over there use a bunch of Americans saying he said what would you use you'd use the language of the country that you were in you'd try to learn how can I have a cup of coffee what is it you know just the little things that it would take we need to be learning the language of Faith quit speaking the language of defeat and the language of sorrow and the language of worry and start speaking the language of faith we have to learn that language he said I think it would behoove Christians more today if they were trying to learn some Heavenly language the Praises of God that we're going to sing over there and enjoy he said and the people that does not believe in shouting what would you do when you get over there he said you would be so out of place he said better get Faith and overcome now for faith is the victory that overcomes he said no he said you wouldn't be tagging little things like that you get Faith you that all that legalism starts to go yeah because you begin to realize God's going to take care of his church God's in charge amen so you wouldn't be tagging little things like that you would be having Victory it's time we had some we've been hearing about the battle in the mind all of our life it's time we had some victory in it [Music] now you might tell me this morning brother Ben that faith is the Victory and faith comes by hearing why don't I have more faith why don't I have more victory faith has to come to a place that's not just mental faith but it has been accepted by the soul and quickened to life and we call this the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the token to differentiate from just a feeling or just an experience although it is an experience but it's if there's a there's a reality to it of a changed life see the king is there now he wasn't there and now he is right it's just like an old house if you've got an old house that's all dilapidated and and down you can tell when you drive by brother Danny nobody lives there anymore used to be a nice place but brother so and so they used to live there and her sister so-and-so used to live there now now it's just overgrown with weeds and then one day you walk you begin to see the weeds are beginning to be cut and the fences are beginning to be built back and the house is being painted what happened to that house somebody moved in right somebody told mine somebody took ownership there's a new government in that house don't you realize that's where we live today that's what he's done for us when he moved in my offenses started to be rebuilt when he built in the loan started being mowed when he built in it changed my desires yeah change the way I looked even yeah right and the way I looked at life now it's more than a mental Faith it's a reality and so the king is in residence on the throne of your heart from his administration comes joy peace all the fruits of the spirit you're not trying to produce something by your own efforts it just flows out of you it flows back out of those Gates where you can touch somebody else and help them right so now the scripture says what says that the word is 90. so it's not something you have to reach out for somewhere else but the word is Snivy even in my mouth in my heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved what is that that's the faith that's the word of God that's thus saith the king right now he said we we just accept the word upon the basis God said so and that sets a stream between you and God right so now there's a connection he said every channel comes open between you and God then he said there's the battle the very first front line and so he makes the same and he said let's not use a 22 rifle brother Jeremy had a 22 rifle out here a while back and at 22 you couldn't even hear it sounded like a pellet gun because he had a suppressor on it maybe I shouldn't have said that out loud it was a 22 it wasn't a machine gun he had a suppressor on it hard to just make a little Pleak you know and I was I marveled at it you couldn't hardly tell you were firing a weapon but that's not the kind of weapon we use against the enemy we don't need a suppressor we don't need you know they don't worry about noise on the battlefield they don't out there monitoring the noise and monitoring the smoke and monitoring all that they want to make as much noise as possible remember when they invaded Iraq what they called it shock and awe right shock and all and if you watch the TV coverage back then uh when they've been invaded I remember watching it and the Palm was dropped and it just all over all over uh the city there that they were attacking they all just begin to drop and begin to explode in Iraq there and Saddam Hussein began to run why he found him hiding in a hole months later why did they do that they did that because they didn't want to just go in with a 22 rifle because the enemy's not scared of that when you go in with psychology when you go in with well somebody said something and I kind of believe maybe it's right that that what happens is the 22 rifle he said let's get an atomic bomb yeah let's do the job right if you're going to be a Christian you might as well be a happy Christian if you're going to be a Christian you might as well you might as well have control over your territory if you're going to be a Sovereign Nation if each one of us is a sovereign individual that Christ rules over if you're going to be a nation you've got to have borders yeah I'm not talking about politics now I'm talking about right here you've got to have boundaries you gotta have borders there's got to be there's got to be a front line you got to be fighting if you're not fighting you've already been taken over but there's got there's victory in that yeah because your weapon is much stronger than his and so he said let's get God's atomic bomb what is it brother Branham f-a-i-t-h in his word that's God's atomic bomb it blows sicknesses and Devils right and left it annihilates them it just destroys it disintegrates everything that's oh my oh I hope you're seeing it this morning it disintegrates everything that's ungodly when that palm of face drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease he said you say is that right brother Brandon then why does it on some and on others now listen he said it's because of the channel he said you can look out and see it but you've got to have it in here looking this away not out there looking in see you see well there's a battle going on I see it but it's not that Faith that's outside looking in but it's inside looking out he said you've got to have it in here looking this away not out there looking in you've got to be in looking out you can't come through reason you can't come through these other things you've got to come right down God's channel of it right into the soul aren't you glad aren't you glad that she's on the inside yeah Hallelujah oh that old song said he Jesus on the inside working on the outside whole what a change in my life amen amen he that is within you it's greater than he is in the world now he that is within you begins to make your body and mind come subject to the word your actions are transformed by the renewing of your mind there's a new King in Residence once the king is there all the channels are cleaned out by the Holy Spirit brother Brown use the example of a girl with Hodgkin's disease and her and her mother they come up in a prayer line but they were not Christians and he talks about it he said first he said accept Christ as your savior first he said you need to be a Christian and he says is he about that he said what was the matter he said you had to open the Channel first you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word Oh my he is the word and he stands there there's nothing going to stop it then now he uses again the example of a boiler if you go back to greatest battle ever fought here's an example of a boiler now many of us don't know what a boiler is because we don't use very many of them around here some of the old-timers know what it is a boiler like you would put in a house right that would that would heat your house and the boiler has to have a flute because the boiler whatever is is running it whether it's steam I guess they're well they put coal in it or wood or whatever that it is the boiler gas even the boiler has to I it has to have an outlet or it'll explode right and so if there was a flu that would go outside the house you'd see a flu sticking out the wall of the house or out the basement or someplace so a boiler had to have an escape valve a flu in order to not in order to work correctly in order not to blow up let me say this there's got to be something actively in your life getting rid of the things the devil's trying to put in there the pressure's building up we live in that age of pressure we live in that eight of age of hardship we live in that age of mental oppression we live in that at the time that we live in it's a mind age and Satan is constantly bringing stuff in and you've got to have an outlet that's not stopped up right to get rid of it so a cluttered mind needs an escape valve huh you can't just live with all them thoughts forever you met hoarders right well maybe you haven't met them I I think I kind of am one but I just a minor case but if you're a hoarder what you do you can't bear to get rid of anything so your house starts to build up you've seen them maybe in their car they can't even get in it and just be full of magazines and say you're saying man that Magazine's from 1982. Popular Mechanics and and there ain't nothing you're going to ever need to know but they can't give like there's something psychological they just can't get rid of it they just can't get rid of it and so that's many times what we do spiritually if our mind gets cluttered like that we get things we can't you just need to get rid of that I don't have time to worry about all the people that don't like me come on come on right you don't have time to spend there and just just keeping that old that old Grudge around that'll malice around I don't think the devil gave that to you give it back there's got to be an outlet that thing will build up until you've got no room anymore you got no room for Joy Got No Room for peace Got No Room for the revelation of God's word because you're just full of stuff so he said you've got to clean it conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word of God that it's the truth no matter if ten thousand died on this side today trusting ten thousand died on that side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with me I'm the individual I'm the one that's trusting I'm the one that believes it he said and we see back Yonder if we wanted to open up our channels then if we can and see we find this one and that one and this one and that one thousands of them testifying so he's saying you're an individual but if you could ever open up the channel as an individual you'd find you have brothers and sisters testify they've been through the same thing you went through it wasn't a unique situation but you thought it was but if you could get on the outside you'd see God did it for them he can do it for you all right she just gotta clean out that flu so there can be victory in the battle of the Mind see there's only a couple uh letter difference between victim and Victory right a victim is a sacrificial lamb that's what that word comes from in the Latin victim is a sacrifice but a Victor is one who benefits from that sacrifice yeah Jesus said we're more than conquerors oh my God see that Victory you're a Victor not a victim if you have a victim mentality you're never going to be able to overcome in the battle of the mind but if you have a Victor mentality you can overcome no matter what the devil sins there so victory in the battle of the mind is a promise from God Isaiah 26 3 that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusteth in me Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God there's the outlet the flu it's open he said the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and mines through Christ Jesus listen for God hath not given us second Timothy 1 7 the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind are you with me now yeah so God can keep your mind God can heal your mind just like he can heal your body and and he can keep your mind now taking second Corinthians 10 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war in the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare not carnal that's where I want to go tonight but I'll just read it now so you can keep it in your mind but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God so anything that comes in at these Gates that we see its identity is against the word yeah and it shouldn't be there we cast it out we arrested right bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ right and I've got 15 minutes left I want to spend it on this now many people like well I I never get to Victory I I've been suffering with this for 50 years 30 years 20 years 10 years if you have faith you already have the victory right and one day one day that's going to be well but you understand that there's there you've got to get through that at some point and sometimes it's hard now brother Branham suffered with this himself when it comes to the battle of the mind and and specifically mental oppression and that's what he called it and he prayed for people with mental oppression and they got well and yet he struggled with it and it wasn't all the time but every seven years he said he went through I've talked to young people you go through a change you get married you have a child something happens you lose a home so you lose a job something will happen that's when the devil likes to work on you it's a junction before brother random every seven years was that conjunction he just goes through the blues he get he gets discouraged and and it's a real thing it's a real thing you can't just tell that well just get over it well yeah brother random could have just gotten over it he would have all right right but it took it took something it took a faith and then that Faith eventually Abraham held on for 25 years but finally that Faith but let me say this let me say this that faith become reality that brother Branham did not give in to it even while he had it he still preached he still served the Lord he had that nervous breakdown he said during one of those times in the 40s he was away for one year but he came back yeah yeah he was off the field but he didn't quit serving the lord he didn't give in to the devil what'd he do he just kept coming back kept coming back kept coming back and that's what we have to do now he he talks about a lady he said I see a lady sitting right back through this away She's suffering she's got oppression she's got a breakdown it's a nervous condition a mental condition he saw if the woman could only catch it her name is Mrs Adams but leave with all your heart Jesus Christ will make you well he said Do you believe it with all your heart you accept your healing he said don't be scared here's the key to overcoming mental oppression don't be scared don't be scared he said if you're scared you'll always be in that estate it's a mental oppression but don't doubt believe with all your heart will you do it stand upon your feet Mrs Adams stand up on your feet stand up right here and be healed in the name of Jesus Christ he said I rebuke that devil that's bothering you to try to keep you from it yeah yeah the devil's lying to you you're gonna be all right go home and be well now oh my God again brother Brown said all right the thing of it is he said you're really the trouble is you're suffering from a nervous breakdown you're having some kind of mental Scruples in your mind it's oppression from Satan now there might be many reasons for it and but the answer is not psychology the answer is to order our mind by the word right because God made the mind he knows how to work in it he knows how to heal it so now he said you're having some kind of mental Scruples in your mind suppression from Satan this has been going on for some time it's cause your body to get weak your heart is weak you're in a very bad shape by this your whole family is just about into a breakdown and many times we've experienced that I've seen that how it spreads from one member to another because especially when it's a father or mother and it gets to spread through the family because it's a it's a mental oppression now he said sir you've been waiting for a word haven't you the brother said yes he said do you accept my word yes sir then in the name of Jesus Christ I send you home to be well I don't know brother Brandon may have had it might have had a vision and seen him home well and so he could do that but many times when brother Brandon would do that he explained it he said I'm not telling them I'm not healing them he said what I'm doing is I'm telling them what the Bible said right go home and be well he said that's what the Bible says if you believe you'll be well yeah you you waiting on her word will you accept the word from me I'll say to you this morning are you waiting on a word will you accept the word from the Lord will you accept the word from the Lord are you waiting on something to come some Supernatural thing to break in will you accept the word of the Lord that says thus saith the Lord God will give you peace in a time of trouble God will give you an answer when you need an answer all right thus saith the word thus Save the King amen amen now this is something brother Brandon has as well he says you don't know what I've suffered just mental oppression every seven years it's come all my life explains this on the wings of a snow white dove I don't have time to get deep into it this morning but he went to Mayo clinic trying to get help and when he was 38 years old I just realized I'm that age but Joel 38 years old but he was a prophet of God he had dealt in that nervous a spiritual realm I'll say this spiritual people are nervous and it's just something you have to deal with a lot of times musicians are nervous talented people are nervous and yet other people can I can be just calm and just go on in life and just steady well you need both kinds because if we were all just nervous wrecks all the time we'd have trouble all right we need some people that can be solid and and sit there and and and just listen to the word of God and take the word of God in and maybe they're not they're not up into up and down all the time and and excited but they're but they're solid they they know where they stand yeah we need people like that but we need some people that God works on in a spiritual realm and so if you're that way don't don't think that well if I could be more like that other person no you just be what God made you to be so but he went to Mayo clinic trying to get help and when he was there he had a vision of a squirrel now he said you'd have to understand my Ministry to understand this he said we had a vision of a squirrel and the squirrel like a weasel he said it was he said it was six inches long and it jumped into his mouth and jumped down his stomach and just was tearing him to peace for pieces from the inside and he comes out of the vision screaming and crying somebody help me and and this this is six inches long and he said the voice told him remember he's only six inches long oh he won't last forever he's only six inches long now but but the Brandon said Mayo brothers the next day examined me he said your father was an Irishman he drank your mother being a half Indian makes you almost a half breed this these doctors were something else doctors can be cold sometimes can't they said so you're just a nervous wreck until you'll never be out of it and said otherwise you're healthy but there's something in the soul that man cannot control oh that's where they were wrong said when a man dies you can't hold an autopsy because his Soul's gone he said well you'll you'll never get over it I said but sir I don't do nothing I said I'm happy he said that's right it's just out of the human grab bag I said you'll always have it he said oh what a discouraging thing because the doctor presented it to him as if there would never be victory yeah in this battle in his mind oh God I'm glad the prophet God was honest with us aren't you told us these things because he presented as if there would never be Victory and the devil's trying to tell you today there will never be Victory but remember he's only six inches long he cannot last forever you'll either be healed here you'll be healed over there you might as well worship God yeah might as well thank God for your healing I said but but sir I I don't do nothing I'm happy he told him that oh what a discouraging thing now his mother had a dream of six white doves but the brandman's mother a dream of six white doves and then he realized there had to be a seventh somewhere and I've stood out there brother Bill in Dove Cove where brother Brandon gets out in that Cove and in Sabino Canyon it's a very pretty Place very peaceful shaded by the rock walls of the canyon and you have stood in that Cove and and thought about this he was in that Cove he saw the seventh white dove the seventh death and then I think it was the next day and you forgive me if I've got some of my facts wrong but I just kind of have to move through this now I I couldn't can't read the quotes for you we'd be here all day but he saw that six inch squirrel and he said it was laying on the ground full of choya cactus it had jumped and he said what had happened is I love I love brother random's Faith he said it had jumped and it tried to hit him remember every seven years that thing hit him right but this time oh God you say well that thing's bothered me over and over and over and over again and every time it does it brother being every time it keeps me out of church every time it every time I give into it every time that Temptation comes I just have to give in no there's going to come a time when it'll be the last time and that was the last time amen it was the last time he said but I'm older than I've done with it all my life brother Adam was almost about to go home it's one of his last sermons he was believing for his healing God gave him his healing but he told him you won't have to deal with this anymore Hallelujah it missed him and it hit the cactus now you know brother Brandon begins to after seeing that he's still sick he still has the battle going on but he's gained the victory in the mind he still felt blue he still felt discouraged but he had that in his mind he had gained the victory he said somehow I know I'll tell you before it happens he said the doctor's a good doctor no doubt I think he's a fine man but I know I'm going to be over it it's done it's finished I'm gonna be well Hallelujah well I wonder if we could come to that this morning I know it's going to be over with it's done I'm finished it's going to be well I'm gonna be well I'm not gonna deal with that no more I've dealt with that nervousness all my life but this is it if you could ever get that faith in your heart he's defeated me that way over and over again but not today Satan not today it's gonna be okay [Applause] huh later that night during the prayer line he prays for a woman with the same problem you know a lot of times we think well brother Ben there's there's uh you know I'm not a prophet so what worked for brother Brandon won't work for me I'll say this you got something greater than a vision that's what brother Brandon taught us you have something greater than a vision you have faith in the word but listen how he deals with his sister that same night and it was an old-fashioned prayer line where they come and told Brother Brown what was wrong with him he prayed for him so he didn't use the discernment often in that line he had an old-fashioned we called an old-fashioned prayer line he said depression fear I know the sister speaks to brother Brandon poor little thing she said she's never seen peace in life the same thing that I said can't sleep nervous tension dear God bear me record Lord that I've told the truth how I feel for this little woman I pray God that you'll send to her tonight that streak of Faith from above that knows that you are obligated to your word and you'll keep every word May the god of Heaven take this fear away from my sister and I obey you he said by laying hands upon her and condemning it in the name of Jesus Christ may it come out of her he said now look sister you believe me now if you can start from right here by the cross from this night deny you got it you said my brother Ben I don't have a six inch squirrel I don't have a vision but from this moment on if you start right here by the cross deny that you got it see go on saying I haven't got it no more and it will leave you why brother Brandon realized he had had the victory by faith this woman could have the victory by faith he didn't tell her she needed a supernatural sign he didn't tell her but if she could get a victory in her mind it was over I don't know about you this morning as I close the musicians come I don't know about you but I'm tired of the devil getting free reign in my mind I'm tired of him coming over the walls I'm tired of letting him in at the gates I'm going to close them off I'm going to shut them up I'm gonna kick him out amen there's going to be a victory in my mind I may not see it in my body yet I may not see it in my children yet I may not see it in my circumstances yet but in my mind there will be Victory because I know he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll come again but I'll defeat him again every time that thing will miss me and it'll destroy itself oh Hallelujah quit messing around with the 22 rifle trying to get rid of it well brother Ben I win and I tried to make myself feel a little bit better and a little bit of self-care quit messing around with the 22 rifle drop the atomic bomb of faith on your enemy you can have victory in the battle of the Mind oh my hey man do we know that on the wings but Snow White Dove I hate to throw you a curveball but could we sing that before brother Allen comes and then we'll be dismissed oh do you love the
