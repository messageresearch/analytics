[51:51] I want to speak to you this morning on
[51:53] proving his resurrection you may have
[51:55] your seats
[51:58] live in a time when everyone wants
[52:00] scientific proof or picture proof that
[52:04] what you're saying is true
[52:07] it's take a picture or it didn't happen
[52:10] because we have the ability to do that
[52:13] today and and so we live in a very
[52:16] cynical Age and and yet if you look at
[52:20] the death burial and resurrection of
[52:22] Christ it's actually that event that
[52:26] that develops the picture of who he was
[52:29] there was no real proof of who he was
[52:33] until his death burial and Resurrection
[52:36] it's as if it was there but it was only
[52:39] in a form that you couldn't you couldn't
[52:41] really see it the full picture of it but
[52:44] once they saw him and heard the word
[52:47] from him after his resurrection it was
[52:51] them actually seeing him of the Paul
[52:53] that that caused him to recognize this
[52:56] is real this is the truth and and I want
[53:00] to say this to us this morning that
[53:02] there was a time when every one of us
[53:04] was undeveloped if you could say it that
[53:07] way we could say that we were a
[53:09] Christian we could identify as a
[53:11] Christian we might have many times had
[53:13] little experiences and things in our
[53:16] lives that we thought well I've given my
[53:18] heart to the Lord but there had to come
[53:20] a time when we died to sin and through
[53:24] death burial and Resurrection through
[53:27] baptism and through the through the
[53:29] filling of the spirit of God we actually
[53:31] developed into what God wanted us to be
[53:34] and then the people could see here's a
[53:37] proof that this person is a son or
[53:40] daughter of God there was a time brother
[53:43] Stewart when you were just another
[53:45] message kid and I was just another
[53:47] message kid but through death burial and
[53:50] Resurrection I've been developed and you
[53:53] have been developed into where the
[53:55] people can see it's a proof of his
[53:57] resurrection we shouldn't take that
[53:59] lightly Church it ought to mean as much
[54:01] to us this morning as it did the very
[54:03] day that it happened and I want to tell
[54:06] you this each one of you children you've
[54:08] got to have that same thing happen in
[54:10] your life you can be a church member you
[54:13] can have everything going just right you
[54:15] can have all things said in order you
[54:18] could even get married and marry a
[54:20] Christian boy or a Christian girl you
[54:22] could live for decades and go to church
[54:23] and pay your tithes but there's got to
[54:26] come a time when there's a death burial
[54:28] and Resurrection in your life it's got
[54:30] to happen
[54:32] the picture has got to be developed and
[54:35] if you find yourself miserable in the
[54:37] house of God if you find yourself unable
[54:39] to to participate in the freedom of
[54:42] worship you find yourself unable to come
[54:44] to God you need to reach that place
[54:47] my own children the children of this
[54:49] church the burden of my heart this
[54:51] morning as I was praying let them see
[54:53] there's got to be a proof in their life
[54:55] there's got to be a death burial in a
[54:57] resurrection
[54:59] there's got to be a not more than just
[55:01] being a message person more than just
[55:03] being a singer more than even being a
[55:05] preacher there's got to come a proof
[55:07] when you come out on the other side and
[55:09] people can see he was dead but now he's
[55:12] alive
[55:13] Lord you've had for that today it was
[55:15] been a year sister Stephanie since that
[55:17] happened in your life and you could be a
[55:19] testimony this morning something
[55:21] happened death burial and Resurrection
[55:25] amen every one of us can have that do
[55:28] you believe it this morning every one of
[55:31] us can have that and we must have that
[55:35] so before his death burial and
[55:38] Resurrection
[55:40] there was no real proof
[55:42] that Jesus was so he said he was now I
[55:45] know what you're thinking you think well
[55:46] the scriptures but the scriptures had to
[55:48] be completely fulfilled and it was that
[55:51] event which which completed the
[55:54] Fulfillment of the scriptures in his
[55:55] life
[55:56] now we know that I they uh he had his
[55:59] the Virgin birth and Isaiah 7 14 they
[56:02] had been promised a virgin shall
[56:04] conceive in the story of Christmas it
[56:07] speaks to us of a time when he was born
[56:10] and it fulfilled the scripture
[56:13] but there was really only one person who
[56:15] knew for sure that that was the truth
[56:18] and that was Mary
[56:21] right she knew
[56:24] so to her that was a reality
[56:27] but to many others they had to believe
[56:31] all right
[56:32] they had to believe in the story of
[56:34] Christmas
[56:35] they had to believe that he came on a
[56:37] certain at a certain time and that God
[56:40] came down and and and actually and
[56:43] actually the Holy Spirit was the father
[56:45] of Jesus how he how he was she was
[56:48] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and they
[56:51] had to believe that and for most people
[56:53] they didn't believe it most people
[56:55] believe that this was a Roman soldier
[56:57] most people believed that it was some
[56:59] kind of a case where she was just too
[57:01] embarrassed or too ashamed that was the
[57:03] prevailing story and I'll be honest with
[57:05] you if you were just a a person who had
[57:08] nothing no knowledge of God no knowledge
[57:10] of the scriptures you wouldn't think
[57:12] that this was some kind of Supernatural
[57:14] thing you would think that poor girl's
[57:15] trying to hide something
[57:18] that's what it looked like
[57:21] yeah oh my and so to many of them they
[57:23] had to just accept her word for that
[57:25] they could look back and Trace his
[57:27] family lineage back to David they can
[57:29] trace it back on both sides but but yet
[57:31] and then they knew that that fulfilled
[57:33] the scripture if Isaiah 11 and 1 where
[57:35] it says he would be a root out of Jesse
[57:37] and they could trace that family
[57:38] scripture back or that family lineage
[57:40] back and it was true but again they had
[57:42] to believe it because there were many
[57:44] sons of Judah there were many people in
[57:46] that lineage
[57:47] thousands and thousands of people
[57:51] and then as he grew up and began his
[57:54] ministry
[57:55] begin to fulfill the word spoken about
[57:57] him and they begin to see things happen
[57:59] in his life they begin to see him that
[58:02] he was uh he he was a person that had
[58:05] extraordinary Miracles that happened in
[58:07] his life he had an extraordinary ability
[58:10] to reveal the word to them to speak to
[58:12] the truth
[58:13] and he began to come in Luke chapter 4
[58:16] and verse 16 and he came to Nazareth
[58:18] where he'd been brought up and as his
[58:21] custom was he he went to church on on
[58:23] the Sabbath day and stood up for the
[58:25] Reed and there was delivered on him the
[58:27] book of the prophet Isaiah when he had
[58:29] opened the book he found the place where
[58:30] it was written the spirit of the Lord is
[58:32] upon me
[58:33] it's anointed me to preach the gospel to
[58:36] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[58:37] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[58:40] the captives recovering of sight to the
[58:42] blind the Senate Liberties him that are
[58:44] bruised verse 19 to preach the
[58:46] acceptable year of the Lord right and he
[58:50] closed the book and he gave it again to
[58:51] the minister and sat down in the eyes of
[58:53] all them that were the synagogue were
[58:54] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[58:56] them this day yes
[58:58] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[59:02] but you know what their response was to
[59:04] that
[59:05] out of town
[59:09] right they run him out of town
[59:11] and you find you say well that was his
[59:14] neighbors and friends because they
[59:15] looked at him and they've said you know
[59:17] we know his father
[59:18] we know his mother we know his family we
[59:21] were we've been around the carpentry
[59:23] shop he's just another guy right
[59:25] right he was well hidden
[59:27] in Simplicity yes he's well hidden today
[59:31] but he was well hidden in Simplicity and
[59:34] so they said we knew we knew about him
[59:36] we knew his uh who he was we knew where
[59:38] he come from we know his family history
[59:40] we know how poor he was we we know of
[59:42] the town that he come out of we know
[59:45] he's no King we know he's no Prophet we
[59:47] know he's no Messiah but they could they
[59:49] couldn't see who he really was they
[59:50] couldn't see beyond that veil of Flesh
[59:53] so they actually run him out of town
[59:56] even John the Baptist
[59:59] now think about it
[1:00:01] now we think we have a hard time
[1:00:02] believing today it's much easier to
[1:00:04] believe today than it was then
[1:00:07] because he was making claims see it's
[1:00:10] it's easier to believe him for who he
[1:00:12] was but you've not walked with him
[1:00:13] you've not eaten with him if it's one
[1:00:16] thing to say he lived and he was God in
[1:00:18] flesh it's another thing to actually sit
[1:00:20] down and eat with him and say he's God
[1:00:22] in flesh
[1:00:24] right because you know he got headaches
[1:00:27] you know that he he got sick sometimes
[1:00:31] probably caught whatever virus was going
[1:00:33] around
[1:00:35] I said Not Jesus absolutely he did
[1:00:38] he was a man he was tempted and all like
[1:00:40] men are like we are
[1:00:42] yet without sin
[1:00:45] so even John who baptized him and
[1:00:48] declared over him Behold the Lamb when
[1:00:50] he was under the anointing
[1:00:52] don't be too hard on yourself for
[1:00:54] doubting when you get in a hard spot
[1:00:55] yeah
[1:00:57] because that's just what we human beings
[1:00:59] do
[1:01:01] when John was under the anointing he
[1:01:03] stood there in front of the Pharisees
[1:01:04] and said this is him
[1:01:07] Behold the Lamb of God who takes away
[1:01:09] the sin of the world you imagine what it
[1:01:12] must have felt like to be in that
[1:01:13] service as he stood there with the power
[1:01:15] and authority of the prophet of the
[1:01:16] Forerunner of God who stood there and
[1:01:18] said this is him
[1:01:21] a little while later he's sitting in
[1:01:23] prison yes sir
[1:01:27] sitting in prison right and if you go to
[1:01:29] that next scripture the Bible says that
[1:01:32] John heard in the prison The Works of
[1:01:34] Christ and he sent two of his disciples
[1:01:38] and he said unto him art thou he that
[1:01:40] should come or do we look for another
[1:01:42] somehow in that prison brother said this
[1:01:45] Eagle Eye got filmed over he began to
[1:01:48] not really understand or not really come
[1:01:50] for him somehow with circumstances of
[1:01:52] life but that didn't mean he wasn't a
[1:01:54] Christian didn't mean he wasn't a
[1:01:56] Believer it just meant that he that he
[1:01:58] needed to be sure oh my but when you
[1:02:01] need proof today we do not follow
[1:02:03] cunningly devised fables we don't follow
[1:02:05] a message of some kind of a cult or some
[1:02:07] kind of an idea somebody had but if you
[1:02:10] need proof today there's proof for you
[1:02:12] that he's alive
[1:02:14] if you're willing to believe it and
[1:02:16] accept it
[1:02:19] we don't follow a a story
[1:02:23] we follow approved gospel
[1:02:27] now watch
[1:02:29] he come to him he said all right though
[1:02:31] he that should come
[1:02:33] and Jesus answered it
[1:02:35] yeah I love the way he did this
[1:02:37] he didn't go back and preach a series of
[1:02:39] sermons on John the traitor
[1:02:44] hey could have
[1:02:46] he could have come and preached it told
[1:02:48] the people well John used to used to
[1:02:50] love me but he is forsaking me you know
[1:02:52] well Jesus knew his heart yes he knew
[1:02:55] the hard time that he was in he said are
[1:02:57] you heathens should come or do we look
[1:02:58] for another and Jesus answered and said
[1:03:00] go show John again
[1:03:04] he'd seen it once but he said go show
[1:03:06] John again those things which you do
[1:03:09] here and see sometimes I think we need
[1:03:11] to go look again at what God's done in
[1:03:13] her day sometimes I think we need to go
[1:03:15] back and re-examine what God did in
[1:03:17] Malachi 4. what he did in Revelation 10.
[1:03:20] we need to go back and re-examine what
[1:03:22] he did in the prophets Ministry some of
[1:03:24] us need to go back and re-examine what
[1:03:26] he's done in our own lives we need to go
[1:03:28] back and look this is what I was and
[1:03:30] this is what I am today yes I have fault
[1:03:33] yes I have failures don't let the devil
[1:03:35] talk you out of what you have because
[1:03:36] you've made a mistake because you've
[1:03:38] done something that's not exactly said
[1:03:40] well I've messed up Don't Let The Devil
[1:03:42] talk you out of your death burial and
[1:03:43] Resurrection but you've got proof in
[1:03:45] your life that Christ is the same
[1:03:47] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:50] who do we believe it this morning
[1:03:54] he said go show John again
[1:03:57] that's a good sermon title right there
[1:03:58] with a joy
[1:04:00] Go and show John again those things that
[1:04:02] you do here and see
[1:04:04] the blind received their sight the lame
[1:04:06] walk the lepers are cleansed the death
[1:04:09] here the dead are raised up the poor of
[1:04:11] the Gospel preached to them and blessed
[1:04:13] is he whosoever shall not be offended in
[1:04:16] me
[1:04:19] even the disciples weren't sure
[1:04:24] he spoke to them about his death
[1:04:28] uh
[1:04:30] no no not going to happen
[1:04:34] Mark 8 31 he began to teach them
[1:04:37] the son of man must suffer many things
[1:04:41] and be rejected of the elders
[1:04:43] and of the chief priests and scribes
[1:04:46] and be killed
[1:04:48] and after three days rise again this is
[1:04:50] not what they wanted to hear
[1:04:53] he said no no you don't understand Jesus
[1:04:57] we're going to go in we're going to
[1:04:58] explain to the scribes and the Pharisees
[1:05:00] they're all going to see it and we're
[1:05:01] all going to have a national revolt
[1:05:03] against Rome
[1:05:06] he said that's not how it's going to
[1:05:07] happen
[1:05:09] you think this is going to be glorious
[1:05:10] but my Kingdom's coming in
[1:05:13] a way that actually I've got to die yes
[1:05:17] and you're all going to be scattered
[1:05:19] yeah
[1:05:20] yeah now look
[1:05:22] and he spake that saying openly
[1:05:24] and Peter took him to the side and said
[1:05:27] hey
[1:05:30] he quit preaching like that
[1:05:33] you're discouraging people
[1:05:36] you're just telling them the truth
[1:05:38] but they just couldn't conceive
[1:05:41] what he would do
[1:05:43] because they couldn't see past death
[1:05:47] oh I hope you're I hope you're listening
[1:05:49] this morning with spiritual years
[1:05:51] they couldn't see past death
[1:05:54] they saw death as a Fidelity because it
[1:05:57] had always been a finality yes they saw
[1:06:00] death as they saw death as something
[1:06:03] that if he died or was lost if he died
[1:06:06] it was all over and they didn't
[1:06:07] recognize that when he died it had just
[1:06:10] begun
[1:06:11] but they saw death as a phenology they
[1:06:14] saw death as something that would end it
[1:06:16] all right because they couldn't conceive
[1:06:18] what he would do and many times in our
[1:06:20] lives when we see trouble when we see
[1:06:22] trials when we see heartaches for the
[1:06:24] herald we see things happen we lose
[1:06:26] loved ones we have trouble in our lives
[1:06:27] we have struggle in our lives and we
[1:06:29] wonder what what is it and we look at it
[1:06:31] meantime we can't see past the death but
[1:06:33] if you can see past the death you begin
[1:06:35] to realize there's a Resurrection on the
[1:06:37] other side he said all things someone
[1:06:40] say all things this morning all things
[1:06:43] work together for the good but in the
[1:06:45] love God who called according to his
[1:06:46] purpose well what is that Romans 8 28
[1:06:48] he's telling us that we are his elected
[1:06:51] children of God if we if we have to go
[1:06:54] through a death if we have to go through
[1:06:55] a trial if we have to go through
[1:06:57] persecution there's something better
[1:06:58] coming on the other side of it
[1:07:01] he's doing it for a reason yes
[1:07:08] it couldn't conceive of it
[1:07:12] of it and the scribes and Pharisees
[1:07:14] couldn't see it Matthew 12 38 certainly
[1:07:16] the scribes of the Pharisees answered
[1:07:18] saying master
[1:07:19] we would see a sign from thee
[1:07:22] yeah but he answered and said unto them
[1:07:24] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:07:26] seeketh after a sign
[1:07:27] there shall no sign be given to it
[1:07:30] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[1:07:33] first Jonas was three days and three
[1:07:35] nights in the wells belly so shall the
[1:07:37] son of man be three days and three
[1:07:40] nights in the heart of the Earth
[1:07:41] he tried to tell him John Chapter 2 and
[1:07:44] verse 18. I know I'm reading a lot of
[1:07:45] scripture but just want to lay a good
[1:07:47] foundation before we move on this
[1:07:49] morning he said then answer the Jews and
[1:07:51] said unto him what sign show us thou
[1:07:53] unto us seeing that thou doest these
[1:07:55] things
[1:07:56] Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:07:58] destroy this Temple he said here's a
[1:08:01] sign destroy this Temple and in three
[1:08:03] days I will raise it up
[1:08:06] and then said the Jews 40 in six years
[1:08:09] was this temple in building
[1:08:11] we'll thou rear it up in three days
[1:08:13] took him 46 years to build the Third
[1:08:16] Temple herod's Temple and you say will
[1:08:18] you well you're going to raise it up in
[1:08:19] three days
[1:08:21] but he spoke of the Temple of his body
[1:08:25] all the way down to the end they
[1:08:26] couldn't see it
[1:08:28] even the disciples were still fussing
[1:08:30] with one another like many people do
[1:08:32] today
[1:08:33] if we're not careful we get caught
[1:08:34] fussing with one another instead of
[1:08:36] seeing the big picture
[1:08:38] and they were fussing with one another
[1:08:39] about who would be the greatest in the
[1:08:41] kingdom and each one of them jockeying
[1:08:43] for a great position right up to the
[1:08:45] very end
[1:08:46] he was having his last supper with them
[1:08:49] and they were still only concerned about
[1:08:51] who would be the Prime Minister and who
[1:08:54] would be the the great one in this in
[1:08:56] this great Kingdom that's coming up and
[1:08:58] they didn't see
[1:09:00] yeah what he'd been telling them
[1:09:03] it had not been proved to them who he
[1:09:05] was
[1:09:06] oh my it should have been they should
[1:09:08] have known they should have seen him he
[1:09:11] raised the dead he did the Miracles
[1:09:13] but it was the resurrection it took a
[1:09:15] resurrection to prove who he was yes
[1:09:19] watch this
[1:09:20] they watched
[1:09:22] as he went to the garden
[1:09:25] through Sleek filled eyes
[1:09:30] had they believed it they would have
[1:09:32] stayed awake
[1:09:34] yes but they didn't really believe
[1:09:37] that this would be the way it would all
[1:09:39] end yeah
[1:09:40] that this would be how it would happen
[1:09:42] they just couldn't believe
[1:09:44] that their little group was going to get
[1:09:46] broken up because God was fixing to do
[1:09:49] something better
[1:09:51] they watched him as he prayed in the
[1:09:53] garden and the blood and the sweats
[1:09:56] separated and and no blood in the water
[1:09:59] in his body separated and he had drops
[1:10:01] of of sweat perspiration like blood
[1:10:05] Peter even had a sword with him and when
[1:10:09] they come to get him and they watched
[1:10:10] Judas kiss him and and extend a hand of
[1:10:14] friendship to him and yet yet as a sign
[1:10:16] to tell him who he was and Peter
[1:10:19] recognized that and he picks up the
[1:10:20] sword and all he accomplishes is one guy
[1:10:23] that's really confused yeah
[1:10:26] because one minute guys coming at him
[1:10:28] with a sword imagine this poor guy
[1:10:31] these guys coming at him with a sword
[1:10:33] and he comes at him and cuts his ear off
[1:10:35] oh no
[1:10:37] he can feel it it's not there and here
[1:10:39] comes another guy they're going to get
[1:10:41] these criminals you know one of them
[1:10:43] does what a criminal's supposed to do
[1:10:45] fight back
[1:10:46] but the other one
[1:10:50] walks over to him picks up the air off
[1:10:53] the ground and puts it back on I tell
[1:10:56] you what that's more than a man yeah
[1:10:58] they should have known who he was but
[1:11:01] they didn't recognize it
[1:11:03] picks up his ear and puts it back that
[1:11:05] guy's confused
[1:11:07] yeah
[1:11:08] he probably thought it was all a dream
[1:11:09] yeah
[1:11:12] most of the disciples fled from the
[1:11:14] authorities
[1:11:15] Peter follows at a distance
[1:11:19] he gets down there and they put him
[1:11:20] through all these trials six different
[1:11:22] trials
[1:11:23] by the way that they put Jesus through
[1:11:26] in that night
[1:11:28] if you think about it he didn't sleep
[1:11:29] through all of that
[1:11:31] that kept him awake they beat him they
[1:11:33] put a crown of thorns on his head they
[1:11:34] spit on him
[1:11:36] what did he do during this time that as
[1:11:38] he was going through all of this Peter's
[1:11:41] watching him during the night
[1:11:42] and he's staying a distance away and he
[1:11:45] goes down there to the house and he's
[1:11:46] sitting around a fire with some others
[1:11:48] and somebody recognizes him
[1:11:51] and what does he do he doesn't stand
[1:11:53] there and say I have such confidence in
[1:11:55] Christ that I don't care if they burn me
[1:11:57] or crucify me or whatever I'm Gonna
[1:11:58] Stand what does he do he's so unsure
[1:12:02] uh if he's really who he says he is yeah
[1:12:05] yeah he stands there and says I'm not
[1:12:07] one of them
[1:12:11] see that's that's why
[1:12:13] that's why sometimes it's hard to pray
[1:12:16] in public yeah
[1:12:18] yeah young people sometimes have a hard
[1:12:20] time in school
[1:12:21] praying over your food
[1:12:24] you want to look like the world
[1:12:26] not sure
[1:12:30] I'll say this this flesh you're never
[1:12:33] going to convince the flesh
[1:12:36] but there's got to be a birth in the
[1:12:37] soul yes
[1:12:39] that's gonna hold that flesh brother
[1:12:41] Riley and no matter what you go through
[1:12:43] in life you know yeah yeah I know he's
[1:12:46] my God yes
[1:12:47] I know this message is true
[1:12:49] I know he's my savior I don't care what
[1:12:52] the internet says what what the what the
[1:12:54] people say I know who he is because he's
[1:12:57] raised in my heart
[1:12:58] I know that he's alive
[1:13:01] because of what he's done
[1:13:04] oh my
[1:13:05] God because of how he's raised me up
[1:13:07] from the death of my own sin
[1:13:10] see that's why it's hard many times to
[1:13:13] acknowledge Him publicly
[1:13:15] you might feel a little bit embarrassed
[1:13:17] about the message of the hour a little
[1:13:18] bit embarrassed about what church you go
[1:13:20] to
[1:13:21] because it's hard if you're not sure but
[1:13:24] let's be sure this morning let's let him
[1:13:27] prove himself to us let's let him make
[1:13:29] himself live in our lives
[1:13:34] hey watch the Roman soldiers beat him
[1:13:37] they watched him fall
[1:13:39] on the road
[1:13:41] to Calvary
[1:13:43] you all know the story
[1:13:45] are you with me this morning I don't
[1:13:47] want to bore you I know you've heard it
[1:13:49] before
[1:13:50] they watched him as he as he as he went
[1:13:53] he had the cross he's trying to carry
[1:13:55] the cross after you've been up for 24
[1:13:56] hours he's he's been beaten over and
[1:13:58] over again
[1:14:00] and he he gets as far as he can go
[1:14:03] physically
[1:14:05] he just can't take anymore you ever been
[1:14:07] there
[1:14:09] his body fell
[1:14:11] and if he didn't go the rest of the way
[1:14:13] he could never redeem man he could never
[1:14:16] fulfill all the scripture
[1:14:18] you realize that he had to fulfill all
[1:14:20] of the word yes
[1:14:22] he had to fulfill all of the word he
[1:14:24] could never fulfill the Psalms where it
[1:14:26] says my phone say stare at me is he had
[1:14:28] died on the way
[1:14:30] if he was unable to pick up the cross
[1:14:32] and so he would stay he was he was under
[1:14:34] the burden of that cross he failed he
[1:14:36] could not move another step
[1:14:38] and God did not come down in
[1:14:40] supernaturally strengthened him but he
[1:14:42] had a man standing there by the name of
[1:14:44] Simon the siren I preached on it to you
[1:14:46] before he's standing there by the side
[1:14:48] of the road he just happens to be there
[1:14:50] an African man who just happened the
[1:14:52] Bible said to come out of the country
[1:14:53] and was found in an intersection and
[1:14:55] when he's at that intersection he don't
[1:14:57] know why he's there and he sees a crowd
[1:14:59] coming he sees the you see here's the
[1:15:01] noise and here comes Jesus and he falls
[1:15:03] right in front of him and a Roman
[1:15:05] soldier looks at him and he says you
[1:15:07] carry his cross
[1:15:09] what was it he was compelled to do it
[1:15:11] listen to me that's how I got called in
[1:15:13] the ministry that's how God calls his
[1:15:15] men it's not because they wanted to it's
[1:15:18] not because they've striven to make
[1:15:19] themselves preachers but it's because
[1:15:21] his body is weak and all of a sudden
[1:15:24] there's a there's a requirement there's
[1:15:26] a compelling the Holy Spirit points in
[1:15:28] your heart said you carry the crawl yeah
[1:15:31] that's right you do what's necessary
[1:15:35] they watched that
[1:15:37] I think it's interesting that Peter
[1:15:38] didn't do it
[1:15:41] James didn't do it right
[1:15:44] John didn't pick him up pick up the
[1:15:46] cross
[1:15:48] Simon did
[1:15:52] you want to change your family history
[1:15:54] pick up a cross
[1:15:57] you can go back and find the scripture
[1:15:58] much later that Simon's children were
[1:16:01] known to the people in the early church
[1:16:05] why because Simon picked up the cross
[1:16:07] yeah
[1:16:09] you want to break a curse in your family
[1:16:10] pick up your cross yes
[1:16:13] start going to church
[1:16:15] start living for God start doing the
[1:16:17] hard stuff
[1:16:24] disciples watched that
[1:16:27] they watched him fall yeah yeah they saw
[1:16:29] Simon pick up the cross they they saw
[1:16:31] him drag his body over the last few
[1:16:33] steps
[1:16:35] to Calvary
[1:16:37] they saw the nails putting his hands and
[1:16:40] his feet some of them did
[1:16:42] they watched his public execution
[1:16:47] they saw him give up the coast
[1:16:51] when he said it is finished
[1:16:54] they thought their lives
[1:16:56] are over
[1:16:59] that's right imagine how hard it would
[1:17:01] be to believe
[1:17:02] it may have been easier to believe back
[1:17:04] when the The Fish and Loaves were being
[1:17:06] handed out and back when they were so
[1:17:08] limbs restored and back when they saw
[1:17:10] demons delivered and they they saw
[1:17:13] different things happen the blind eyes
[1:17:15] opened it was easier to believe then
[1:17:16] than it was that day when they stood
[1:17:18] there and they watched him nailed to a
[1:17:20] tree
[1:17:22] they watched him die yeah
[1:17:26] watch the soldier break his leg
[1:17:30] break the other's legs and then take the
[1:17:32] take the spear and thrust it in his side
[1:17:36] blood water come out
[1:17:41] it's over imagine that was a hard
[1:17:42] weekend wasn't it yeah
[1:17:45] day one
[1:17:46] still over
[1:17:48] yeah I woke up in the morning nothing
[1:17:49] changed
[1:17:52] went to bed on
[1:17:53] Friday night what a what a Passover
[1:17:55] weekend
[1:18:00] they just well I guess the message is
[1:18:03] done for him
[1:18:06] it's over
[1:18:07] nobody's going to believe it nobody's
[1:18:09] going to receive it yeah he's gone
[1:18:10] there's nothing we can do about it
[1:18:12] hmm we'll just tell a few stories and
[1:18:16] sit around listen to some tapes
[1:18:20] do our thing
[1:18:25] they thought their lives were over yeah
[1:18:27] yeah but he wasn't done yet right
[1:18:31] right Hallelujah he wasn't done yet
[1:18:35] you see he believed the word that was
[1:18:37] written about himself
[1:18:41] and he goes down into the grave
[1:18:45] oh God but he doesn't stay there his
[1:18:48] Spirit leaves NOW Watch What Happens it
[1:18:50] goes down Into the Depths he preaches to
[1:18:52] the souls in prison he comes and empties
[1:18:54] Paradise
[1:18:55] and he comes up a mighty conqueror on
[1:18:58] the third day now watch
[1:18:59] and the Bible tells us on the first day
[1:19:01] of the week
[1:19:03] cometh Mary Magdalene
[1:19:06] early
[1:19:07] she got to church first
[1:19:11] I love the story of Mary Magdalene I
[1:19:15] love it
[1:19:16] he said when it was yet dark unto the
[1:19:18] Sepulcher
[1:19:20] and see if the stone taken away
[1:19:23] now her first thought is not
[1:19:27] it's not he's risen
[1:19:31] her first thought is they've taken him
[1:19:33] yeah
[1:19:34] somebody stole a body
[1:19:37] yeah
[1:19:39] and she runeth and coming to Simon Peter
[1:19:41] and to the other disciple whom Jesus
[1:19:43] loved I love the way John describes
[1:19:45] himself
[1:19:47] he was writing about myself I'd want to
[1:19:49] write about myself that way too
[1:19:51] it's kind of a humble brag right the one
[1:19:54] Jesus loved
[1:19:58] and so she comes to the disciple who
[1:20:01] Jesus loved and said they've taken away
[1:20:02] the Lord out of the Sepulcher we know
[1:20:04] not where they've laid him
[1:20:06] and Peter therefore went forth they
[1:20:08] weren't going to find him risen they
[1:20:10] were going to see they were going to see
[1:20:12] uh who had stolen him who'd ruined his
[1:20:15] who'd ruined their ability to mourn yeah
[1:20:18] their ability to come together and talk
[1:20:20] about what had been
[1:20:22] yeah oh God
[1:20:24] so they ran both together and the other
[1:20:26] disciple did outrun Peter
[1:20:31] came first to the septica
[1:20:34] he stood he's stooping down and looking
[1:20:36] in saw the linen clothesline yet waiting
[1:20:38] not in
[1:20:39] and then come as Simon Peter following
[1:20:41] him and went into the Sepulcher see at
[1:20:43] the linen closed line and the napkin
[1:20:45] that was about his head not lying with
[1:20:47] the linen clothes notice the details
[1:20:48] they remembered later
[1:20:50] but wrapped together in a place by
[1:20:52] itself
[1:20:54] glory to God
[1:20:56] it's one thing to take them off it's one
[1:20:58] thing for them to steal the body but
[1:20:59] here they he's taking off the
[1:21:02] handkerchief he's taking off the The
[1:21:03] Veil if you put it that way and wrapped
[1:21:05] it left it there
[1:21:07] now watch
[1:21:08] and he says
[1:21:10] then when then also that other disciple
[1:21:12] which came first to the septica and he
[1:21:14] saw and believed
[1:21:15] he saw him believed now watch he did not
[1:21:18] believe in the resurrection he just
[1:21:19] believed he was gone
[1:21:21] and we know that because the next verse
[1:21:23] yes says for as yet they knew not the
[1:21:26] scripture
[1:21:27] that he must raise again from the dead
[1:21:31] now they had heard it
[1:21:34] but they didn't know it yeah come on
[1:21:36] that's right see that's the problem many
[1:21:39] times as we don't yet we know the
[1:21:41] scripture that said you must be born
[1:21:43] again but we don't really know the other
[1:21:45] he said you will receive power after the
[1:21:48] Holy Ghost has come upon you we we've
[1:21:50] heard it we've read it we've heard it
[1:21:52] preach but you got to know it brother
[1:21:53] Peter you got to know it it's got to
[1:21:55] become part of your life yeah it's got
[1:21:58] to become your overwhelming desire it's
[1:22:00] got to be something in your life that'll
[1:22:02] make you want to reach out it'll make
[1:22:04] you go the rest of your life and and
[1:22:06] tell the story as if you were there and
[1:22:08] you saw it can you imagine if you were
[1:22:10] Mary Magdalene if you were one of the
[1:22:12] disciples you went into that tomb you
[1:22:15] saw him laying there you saw the absence
[1:22:17] of a body and then you found out later
[1:22:19] that it matched the scripture can you
[1:22:20] imagine no one could ever get you to
[1:22:22] quit telling that story you tell it the
[1:22:24] rest of your life but let me tell you
[1:22:26] this this morning if you were dead and
[1:22:28] trespasses and sins and you come and
[1:22:30] wept your way in an altar and you were
[1:22:32] resurrected one day there ain't nothing
[1:22:34] but a sandwich ever gonna be able to
[1:22:36] take you away from that story you're
[1:22:38] going to tell it the rest of your life
[1:22:43] you'll tell your neighbors you why
[1:22:46] because you believe it
[1:22:48] you saw it it's been proved to you
[1:22:52] Hallelujah
[1:22:53] it heard it they were taught it from
[1:22:55] their youth
[1:22:56] yeah but they didn't know it
[1:22:59] verse 10.
[1:23:01] then the disciples went away again into
[1:23:03] their own home
[1:23:04] but Mary
[1:23:07] I love you
[1:23:08] stood without without a deceptica weeper
[1:23:12] and as she went
[1:23:14] she stooped down and looked into the
[1:23:15] Sepulcher and seeth two angels in white
[1:23:18] sitting
[1:23:20] I wanted the head and the other at the
[1:23:21] feet
[1:23:23] where the body of Jesus had laid
[1:23:25] they said unto your woman
[1:23:27] why weep us now
[1:23:29] she saith unto them because they have
[1:23:31] taken away my Lord
[1:23:33] and I know not where they have laid him
[1:23:34] yes
[1:23:35] and when she had thus said she turned
[1:23:38] herself back
[1:23:39] and saw Jesus
[1:23:45] standing
[1:23:48] and not
[1:23:51] that was Jesus
[1:23:54] and Jesus saith in her woman
[1:23:57] why we pastel yes
[1:24:00] whom seeketh now
[1:24:03] and she supposedly him to be the
[1:24:06] gardener
[1:24:07] saith on him sir
[1:24:09] if thou have borne him hence tell me
[1:24:11] where thou slayed him and I will take
[1:24:13] him away let me be let me let me have my
[1:24:17] grief
[1:24:18] leave me alone in my morning
[1:24:20] I want to take him away and build a
[1:24:22] memory Memorial to him
[1:24:24] because of what he did and how wonderful
[1:24:26] he was and how much he loved me
[1:24:29] yeah oh God
[1:24:31] it's not what he wanted
[1:24:32] he wanted her to be the memorial
[1:24:36] Jesus said unto her Mary
[1:24:41] oh you'd see him you'd been to church
[1:24:43] over and over again but one day
[1:24:46] you heard a voice say Mary
[1:24:50] Ben you
[1:24:52] Paul
[1:24:55] come on what was it you may not have
[1:24:56] heard it in a literal form but you heard
[1:24:58] it what was it it was the voice of God
[1:25:02] Hallelujah it was speaking to you you'd
[1:25:05] heard tape after tape after tape you'd
[1:25:07] heard you'd read scripture after
[1:25:08] scripture but one day yes
[1:25:11] it spoke to you and you heard your name
[1:25:15] she said Mary he said Mary and she
[1:25:18] turned herself
[1:25:22] say that him ripponi
[1:25:24] which is to say
[1:25:26] master
[1:25:29] this was the same voice that it
[1:25:31] delivered her of Seven Devils
[1:25:35] he picked the right person
[1:25:38] to show himself alive to First
[1:25:40] the first proof the first infallible
[1:25:43] proof is the way that Luke puts it in
[1:25:45] the book of Acts the first infallible
[1:25:47] proof that Jesus was alive was to Mary
[1:25:49] Magdalene
[1:25:52] why Mary
[1:25:54] look at Mark 16 and 9 you know when
[1:25:56] Jesus was risen early the first day of
[1:25:58] the week he appeared first to Mary
[1:25:59] Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven
[1:26:03] Devils
[1:26:04] so the scripture ties the fact of her
[1:26:07] being the first one with her being the
[1:26:09] one who was delivered of the most
[1:26:12] Hallelujah
[1:26:14] I feel like that's me no wonder Paul
[1:26:16] said that's the chief I'm the chiefest
[1:26:17] of Sinners yes that puts me in a good
[1:26:20] place to see it yeah you said my brother
[1:26:22] Ben you don't know what I've done you
[1:26:24] don't know what I've been you don't know
[1:26:25] what my past is you don't know the
[1:26:27] memories that I have we don't know the
[1:26:29] memories that she had but we know this
[1:26:30] we know she was the first one to see him
[1:26:33] if you've had a past if you've had
[1:26:35] struggles if you've had trouble just
[1:26:37] remember I just put you in a good place
[1:26:39] yeah
[1:26:40] yes the disciples who were raised good
[1:26:43] and raised with Godly homes and things
[1:26:45] and taught the scriptures they could not
[1:26:46] see him first but her that woman who had
[1:26:49] been delivered out of Seven Devils she
[1:26:51] saw him she recognized the presence of
[1:26:53] the Lord she heard his voice
[1:26:56] Hallelujah
[1:27:00] we need to recognize what we were
[1:27:03] delivered from yes so it can appear to
[1:27:05] us
[1:27:09] well I'm not one of the disciples why
[1:27:11] not one went on his own Earthly mother
[1:27:13] yeah
[1:27:14] you see Mary Magdalene would be the
[1:27:16] least credible Witness
[1:27:19] if all of them
[1:27:21] if you put her on the witness stand
[1:27:23] she's the one that would be believed the
[1:27:24] least because of what her passed had
[1:27:26] been yeah
[1:27:32] he was the one who got to tell the story
[1:27:34] first yeah
[1:27:37] glory to God
[1:27:39] listen
[1:27:41] brother says this he said Mary Magdalene
[1:27:43] knew his power
[1:27:44] she knew there was something about him
[1:27:46] was different from anyone else she had
[1:27:48] Seven Devils cast out of her
[1:27:50] he said everybody that's ever been free
[1:27:53] from the Devil by the power of Jesus
[1:27:55] Christ knows where they're standing
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:00] Hallelujah no one can ever come in his
[1:28:03] great divine presence and ever be the
[1:28:05] same person anymore
[1:28:08] all right you see what I'm still the
[1:28:10] same you've never come in his presence
[1:28:13] you've never come in his presence if you
[1:28:15] ever did you'd never be the same person
[1:28:17] again
[1:28:19] sure has a story to you but it's got to
[1:28:21] become a reality
[1:28:23] yeah yeah glory to God
[1:28:26] amen he said no one can ever come and
[1:28:30] ever be the same person you're changed
[1:28:31] or something happens to you he said oh
[1:28:34] you can stand off in Psychology and
[1:28:36] imagine this and accept this a certain
[1:28:39] thing some theories or something like
[1:28:41] that but we don't believe in theology we
[1:28:43] believe in the power and the
[1:28:45] resurrection of Jesus Christ and when
[1:28:47] you come into His presence there's
[1:28:49] something that happens in your life that
[1:28:51] changes you oh we could we could shout
[1:28:53] about that this morning you're never the
[1:28:55] same anymore a man that's ever been in
[1:28:57] the presence of Christ but it mean
[1:29:00] what's wrong with you what's happened to
[1:29:01] you I've been in his presence have you
[1:29:03] made mistakes yes do you have a past yes
[1:29:06] have you gotten messed up in the past
[1:29:08] but I've been in his presence
[1:29:10] I can worship him I can recognize him
[1:29:12] I've been changing his presence is there
[1:29:15] anyone else here this morning I can say
[1:29:16] Amen to that I didn't change in his
[1:29:19] presence I've heard his voice I've seen
[1:29:21] him alive he's proved himself to me
[1:29:25] glory to God
[1:29:27] Hallelujah
[1:29:31] look at the Devil she had cast out of
[1:29:33] her
[1:29:34] said she had Seven Devils cast out of
[1:29:36] her Pride
[1:29:39] Envy
[1:29:43] and here's one she thought she was so
[1:29:45] pretty
[1:29:46] there was no one like her
[1:29:49] but when Jesus spoke
[1:29:51] he said be thou clean
[1:30:02] she become a new person
[1:30:04] she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own
[1:30:06] side
[1:30:07] but she wrapped herself in the robe of
[1:30:09] meekness and gentleness and followed the
[1:30:11] master
[1:30:12] she loved him
[1:30:17] I think about
[1:30:18] and we're going to tie this together
[1:30:20] after a little bit but
[1:30:22] I think about when he was proving
[1:30:23] himself alive in this generation
[1:30:26] how he come as I preached you many times
[1:30:28] to a widow named Hattie Wright Moser we
[1:30:31] call her Hattie right
[1:30:32] you know the story
[1:30:34] brother Brandon preaches my new ministry
[1:30:37] he tells the story for the first time
[1:30:39] and sister had me and her two boys are
[1:30:40] sitting there
[1:30:43] see the god that come in our day he
[1:30:45] didn't come and tell us later
[1:30:47] about these things he told us while the
[1:30:49] people involved were still alive yeah
[1:30:52] and you think about that's a powerful
[1:30:53] thing
[1:30:55] excuse me because in that first church
[1:30:57] age there were people there who were
[1:30:59] alive
[1:31:00] and you can say Jesus didn't raise but
[1:31:02] you have a hard time convincing Peter
[1:31:04] that yeah if a hard time convincing Mary
[1:31:06] Magdalene of that
[1:31:08] they were there people today can look
[1:31:11] back and say oh nothing happened with
[1:31:13] Hattie Wright but she was in the meeting
[1:31:15] yeah when he told the story yeah and he
[1:31:18] told her he said here stand up Sister
[1:31:20] Hattie there's a little widow woman that
[1:31:22] the miracle happened on first yeah
[1:31:26] amen and so and he said he talked about
[1:31:30] her husband how she was in a tragic he
[1:31:31] was in a tragic farm accident she lost
[1:31:33] her husband he tells the story he talks
[1:31:35] about it being in her house and he said
[1:31:37] it was the greatest anointing that he
[1:31:38] ever felt more so he said than when he
[1:31:40] stood in Africa and thirty thousand gave
[1:31:42] their souls to Christ at one time yes he
[1:31:45] said here stand up Sister Hattie here's
[1:31:47] the one the miracle happened on he said
[1:31:48] bypassing all the peoples of the world
[1:31:49] for that thing to happen first to that
[1:31:51] poor little humble widow woman up on the
[1:31:53] hillside up there trying to raise a crop
[1:31:55] of corn out of a crawfish ground out
[1:31:57] there to take care of her children he
[1:31:59] said that's the one that God honored the
[1:32:01] first time since the days of Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ and said ask what you will
[1:32:06] he said you know why the plutocrats
[1:32:08] didn't get it or the big folks like that
[1:32:10] it's because God knew they'd ask things
[1:32:11] it was no good for them but he gives it
[1:32:13] to people who he knows will ask the
[1:32:15] right thing why has he revealed the
[1:32:17] message of the hour to you why is he
[1:32:19] giving you the token why has he set you
[1:32:21] free why does he prove his resurrection
[1:32:23] to you because you're somebody who can
[1:32:25] handle it you're somebody who asked for
[1:32:27] the right thing
[1:32:29] glory to God yes
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:33] after he appeared to Mary Magdalene he
[1:32:36] appeared to The Other Women we know the
[1:32:37] story then appeared to Peter privately
[1:32:40] Peter needed that yeah
[1:32:44] the Bible doesn't tell us exactly
[1:32:45] anything about that
[1:32:47] it was just meant for him that just says
[1:32:48] he appeared to him
[1:32:50] two of the two of the number who are not
[1:32:53] the Inner Circle they were not of the
[1:32:55] eleven
[1:32:55] and they probably were not preachers
[1:32:58] just lay people
[1:33:00] but they were on their way to Emmaus
[1:33:01] later that day yeah yeah going home
[1:33:03] after the day's events and they were
[1:33:06] talking about what had happened
[1:33:08] the Bible says they talked together for
[1:33:10] all those things which had happened
[1:33:12] and it come to pass it while they
[1:33:13] communed together and reasoned you want
[1:33:15] him to come around talk about him
[1:33:19] you can talk about the weather you can
[1:33:20] talk about everything going on that's
[1:33:22] going on in the world you can talk about
[1:33:23] politics but you want Jesus to come
[1:33:25] around in your house talk about him
[1:33:27] every once in a while
[1:33:28] talk about it they begin to talk about
[1:33:31] him Jesus himself Drew near and went
[1:33:33] with them but their eyes were holding
[1:33:35] that they should not know him and he
[1:33:37] said unto them what manner of
[1:33:38] communications are these that you have
[1:33:40] one to another as you walk in are sad
[1:33:43] why are you sad he says there's no
[1:33:45] reason for you to be sad why would you
[1:33:47] be sad yes sir yes sir after the
[1:33:49] Passover
[1:33:51] and and one of them whose name was
[1:33:53] cleopas answering said unto him aren't
[1:33:55] there only a stranger in Jerusalem
[1:33:57] that's not known the things which are
[1:33:59] come to pass there in these days
[1:34:01] he said send unto them what things
[1:34:04] and they said unto him concerning Jesus
[1:34:06] of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[1:34:08] indeed in word before God and all the
[1:34:10] people and how the chief priests and our
[1:34:11] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[1:34:13] death and of crucified him but we
[1:34:15] trusted notice look they put it in the
[1:34:18] past it didn't happen we trusted that it
[1:34:22] had been he
[1:34:23] oh my which should have redeemed Israel
[1:34:26] and beside all this today is the third
[1:34:28] day since these things were done yes
[1:34:30] yay and certain women also if our
[1:34:32] company made us astonished which were
[1:34:34] early at the Sepulcher when they found
[1:34:36] not his body they came saying that they
[1:34:38] had also seen a vision of angels which
[1:34:40] said that he was alive and certain of
[1:34:42] them which were with us went to the
[1:34:43] spectacular and found it even his soul
[1:34:45] as the women had said now notice why
[1:34:47] could they still not believe
[1:34:49] yeah him they saw not
[1:34:53] watch
[1:34:54] they hadn't seen him personally
[1:34:57] so there was no proof
[1:35:00] oh God
[1:35:01] and he said unto them
[1:35:05] Jesus gets ready to preach
[1:35:07] old fools
[1:35:10] what a great opening line for a servant
[1:35:16] whole fools and soul of heart
[1:35:18] to believe all that the prophets have
[1:35:20] spoken
[1:35:22] ought not Christ who have suffered these
[1:35:24] things
[1:35:24] and to enter into his glory
[1:35:27] and beginning at Moses and all the
[1:35:29] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:35:30] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:35:32] himself
[1:35:33] and they drew not into the village
[1:35:35] whether they went he made us know that
[1:35:37] he would have gone further
[1:35:38] but they constrained him
[1:35:40] saying abide with us after this six-hour
[1:35:43] sermon
[1:35:45] let's have some fellowship
[1:35:48] we need to take time to entertain him
[1:35:50] after we get done hearing the word
[1:35:53] we'll take a few minutes sometimes and
[1:35:55] entertain him so we have these brothers
[1:35:57] come up at the end and seeing it's not
[1:35:59] when I leave the platform that's not the
[1:36:01] time to end the worship but the time is
[1:36:03] you just soak sometimes you in quickly
[1:36:05] and that's fine but sometimes we need to
[1:36:07] just let it soak a little bit let the
[1:36:09] atmosphere come right why would we do
[1:36:10] that we want to make him welcome we want
[1:36:13] to come straight and stay with us for a
[1:36:15] while we need you at work this week we
[1:36:17] need you at home we need you in the
[1:36:19] school we need you we need you to be
[1:36:21] with us so come stay with us
[1:36:26] it's good he constrained them
[1:36:28] abide with us for it is toward evening
[1:36:31] and the day as far as being he went into
[1:36:33] tarry with them and made him welcome
[1:36:36] to pass as he said it meet with him he
[1:36:38] took bread
[1:36:39] and blessed it break it
[1:36:42] gave it to them
[1:36:44] I saw him do something he did when he
[1:36:46] was here
[1:36:51] that's how he proves himself yeah
[1:36:53] Yeah by doing what he did when he was
[1:36:56] alive
[1:36:58] yeah Hallelujah
[1:37:00] he blessed it and break and gave to them
[1:37:05] now if something happened to brother
[1:37:06] Joel he got sick and passed away God
[1:37:08] forbid
[1:37:11] I even saying that I could feel a cold
[1:37:12] chill go over the church
[1:37:15] but if something happened brother Joel
[1:37:17] I'm picking on him because I can
[1:37:19] because he'll take it but if something
[1:37:21] happened to him
[1:37:22] and he come back later and said he was
[1:37:24] resurrected and I buried him I put him
[1:37:27] there in the grave in the ground we said
[1:37:29] all our kind words about him you don't
[1:37:32] want to mess up a good funeral you know
[1:37:33] right
[1:37:36] that you got him you got him in the
[1:37:37] ground and you get him all you know and
[1:37:39] and here he comes back
[1:37:40] man messing up the program
[1:37:43] well you know the first thing you'd want
[1:37:44] him to prove who he was
[1:37:46] right you could be just a look-alike
[1:37:49] all right
[1:37:51] but but if he showed up at church
[1:37:54] and talks to everybody before service
[1:37:57] and everybody after you know it's Joel
[1:38:03] foreign
[1:38:05] because you know he did something
[1:38:08] are you with me this morning
[1:38:13] if
[1:38:15] if I come back from the dead and I never
[1:38:17] preached and I never never was me

[1:38:21] I'm telling myself if I come back from
[1:38:24] the dead and I didn't eat biscuits and
[1:38:26] gravy
[1:38:29] Fried Chicken yeah
[1:38:31] yeah or you hearing me now you see me

[1:38:41] position as a Master of the House and
[1:38:43] the head of the table he sits down and
[1:38:45] he breaks the bread
[1:38:47] we've seen this before
[1:38:50] Hallelujah
[1:38:52] their eyes were open and they knew him
[1:39:00] Brandon said it was after cleopa said
[1:39:02] got Jesus in the room him and his friend
[1:39:03] and Emmaus Jesus broke the bread their
[1:39:05] eyes come open it was after that was
[1:39:07] done they could run all night long back
[1:39:09] up there and tell them disciples truly
[1:39:11] he's raised from the dead
[1:39:13] we've seen him right down there well
[1:39:14] they went back a lot quicker than they
[1:39:16] come up
[1:39:18] he said he said we we've seen him right
[1:39:21] down there and he done the same thing he
[1:39:23] did like he did before he was crucified
[1:39:27] he said oh brother today he said there's
[1:39:29] no need of this Gentile World Turning
[1:39:31] Away your last sign Jesus Christ has
[1:39:33] raised from the dead he's here tonight
[1:39:35] in the form of the Holy Ghost listen to
[1:39:37] me as brother Andrew likes to say we're
[1:39:39] not a helpless hopeless bunch of people
[1:39:40] but what are we today we are the
[1:39:43] children of God we're the ones who are
[1:39:46] proving his resurrection today we live
[1:39:48] in a time when he's done what he said he
[1:39:51] would do and he did it in our generation
[1:39:53] we've seen it yeah
[1:39:55] good yes sir all right and I'll go for a
[1:39:58] little further he's still doing it yeah
[1:40:02] we've seen it we yeah yeah we're not
[1:40:05] just another denomination yeah
[1:40:08] we've seen it
[1:40:09] there's no need of you Gentiles turn
[1:40:11] away your last sign he's here yes
[1:40:14] yes Hallelujah said he's here to perform
[1:40:16] and to do just like he did before his
[1:40:19] crucifixion he's raised from the dead
[1:40:22] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:40:24] forever
[1:40:25] Hallelujah he said you could doubt that
[1:40:27] but if he comes on the scene in a few
[1:40:29] minutes and performs the same thing he
[1:40:31] did before his crucifixion he said then
[1:40:33] you're a sinner If you deny it yes
[1:40:36] yes oh God help us today
[1:40:39] yeah sir they turn around to one another
[1:40:41] and said wait a minute we didn't realize
[1:40:43] how good of a service that was yeah
[1:40:46] now that we know he's alive that six
[1:40:49] hour sermon was a lot easier to take
[1:40:53] did not her heart burn within us
[1:40:56] they didn't recognize that they had
[1:40:58] spiritual heartburn
[1:40:59] until after they'd seen him and knew
[1:41:01] that he was alive I knew who he was and
[1:41:04] then they looked back and said is this
[1:41:06] message good yeah
[1:41:08] yeah don't you love the opening of the
[1:41:10] word why have they've seen him for who
[1:41:12] he really was
[1:41:15] seen him do something he did when he was
[1:41:17] alive
[1:41:18] they rose up the same hour and returned
[1:41:20] to Jerusalem found the eleven gathered
[1:41:22] together and them that were with them
[1:41:23] saying the Lord has risen indeed now
[1:41:25] this is what the eleven were saying they
[1:41:26] come back and they said you can't
[1:41:28] believe what just happened to us the 11
[1:41:30] said oh we know
[1:41:31] he's risen he appeared to Simon
[1:41:36] he was seen by 10 of them that evening
[1:41:38] as eight together
[1:41:39] and the next week he returns so even
[1:41:41] doubting Thomas could see he was alive
[1:41:44] he said come he said put your hands in
[1:41:46] in the put your put your hand on the
[1:41:48] hand on the scarf put him in the scars
[1:41:50] of my hands he said I don't have to Lord
[1:41:51] I believe now
[1:41:53] he said more blessed are they who have
[1:41:55] not seen it yet believe
[1:41:58] yeah he was seen by seven disciples at
[1:42:00] the Sea of Tiberius
[1:42:02] in John 21 3 when Simon Peter you know I
[1:42:06] preached a sermon one time on Peter's
[1:42:08] besetting boat
[1:42:10] because Peter's boat was what he always
[1:42:12] went back to when he got in a tight spot
[1:42:14] he always went back to his job that was
[1:42:16] his job he wasn't fishing for for fun
[1:42:18] right
[1:42:19] he quit preaching went back to work
[1:42:23] and Simon Peter said every time he got
[1:42:25] discouraged oh if you're discouraged
[1:42:27] this morning I want you to be encouraged
[1:42:28] in the fact that he's alive
[1:42:30] Peter got discouraged even after he had
[1:42:32] seen him once
[1:42:34] I said I'm going fishing
[1:42:37] they said unto him
[1:42:38] well I guess we got nothing else better
[1:42:40] to do either
[1:42:41] we've not been you know it's not like
[1:42:43] we've been given any kind of commission
[1:42:45] remember that came later
[1:42:47] they said we're going with you they went
[1:42:48] forth entered into his ship immediately
[1:42:50] the night they caught nothing
[1:42:52] but when the morning was now come
[1:42:54] Jesus stood on the shore but the
[1:42:57] disciples once again they knew not that
[1:42:59] it was Jesus
[1:43:00] then Jesus saith unto them children have
[1:43:03] you any meat
[1:43:04] they answered him no
[1:43:07] and he said it to them casting out on
[1:43:09] the right side of the ship and you shall
[1:43:11] find
[1:43:12] and they cast therefore and now they
[1:43:14] were not able to draw it for the
[1:43:16] multitude of fishes
[1:43:19] oh God and therefore that disciple whom
[1:43:22] Jesus loves said to Peter Peter
[1:43:25] oh
[1:43:27] yeah I'm the disciple who Jesus loves
[1:43:28] you need to listen to me yeah
[1:43:32] it's the Lord
[1:43:34] amen Peter's a man of action he's not
[1:43:38] just going to stand there but it says
[1:43:40] Peter turn when Peter heard it was the
[1:43:42] Lord he heard his Fisher's coat unto him
[1:43:43] for he was naked it means he just had
[1:43:45] his under underneath his short tunicon
[1:43:47] and so he grabbed a hold of his Fisher's
[1:43:49] coat and got dressed to go swimming and
[1:43:52] cast himself into the sea
[1:43:55] now why was he so sure
[1:43:58] why was he so sure because Jesus had
[1:44:01] just done something that he did when he
[1:44:04] was alive
[1:44:05] you remember the first time they ever
[1:44:07] met yeah
[1:44:08] yeah
[1:44:09] Simon Peter is fishing out in the same
[1:44:12] Lake yeah
[1:44:15] and they're fishing perhaps that same
[1:44:17] body of water they're out there fishing
[1:44:18] they hear a voice from The Shore cast
[1:44:20] your net on the other side he said but I
[1:44:22] fished so night and haven't caught
[1:44:23] nothing and I know how to fish this is
[1:44:26] my job he said cast it on the other side
[1:44:28] he said at Thy word Lord I let down the
[1:44:30] net and he did and when he did it come
[1:44:32] up and there was more fish than they
[1:44:33] could handle and when it happened the
[1:44:35] second time he knew it proved to him
[1:44:37] that Jesus was alive let me tell you
[1:44:40] this morning in our generation he's come
[1:44:42] and done the same thing after 2 000
[1:44:45] years he said it's happened again
[1:44:48] Glory
[1:44:49] we saw him do you can watch a video and
[1:44:52] see him do yes
[1:44:53] what he did when he was alive yeah
[1:44:57] yeah that's why we don't mimic that sign
[1:44:59] yeah we don't mock it we don't try to
[1:45:01] reproduce it yeah
[1:45:03] right yeah
[1:45:05] yeah because that sign was one to a
[1:45:07] generation wasn't just discernment yeah
[1:45:10] yeah it was a resurrection sign yeah
[1:45:12] wasn't telling us there was a prophet on
[1:45:14] the earth though there was but it was
[1:45:16] telling us there was a God yes
[1:45:18] same yesterday today and forever but
[1:45:21] Jesus Christ had risen from the dead yes
[1:45:28] I will skip forward a little bit because
[1:45:30] I've run out of time
[1:45:33] he cooked the fish for him
[1:45:35] and Jesus says come and die
[1:45:38] and none of the disciples just asked him
[1:45:40] said who art thou knowing
[1:45:42] that it was the Lord I skipped forward
[1:45:43] several
[1:45:44] several verses were go to acts 1 8 next
[1:45:49] to Peter he said let us tell me more
[1:45:51] than these you all know the story
[1:45:54] you've seen by James
[1:45:55] the Bible says another private viewing
[1:45:58] that James had of Jesus in his
[1:46:00] resurrection
[1:46:01] he's seen by the 11 again on the
[1:46:03] mountain in Galilee
[1:46:05] and finally he was seen by about 500 as
[1:46:07] they saw him
[1:46:08] sinned
[1:46:10] before he ascended he told them this he
[1:46:12] said you shall receive power after that
[1:46:14] the Holy Spirit has come upon you shall
[1:46:15] be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:46:17] and all Judea and Samaria under the
[1:46:19] uttermost parts of the earth when he had
[1:46:21] spoken these things while they beheld he
[1:46:23] was taken up and the cloud received him
[1:46:25] out of their sight and while they looked
[1:46:27] steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up
[1:46:28] behold two men stood by them in white
[1:46:30] apparel which also said you men of
[1:46:32] Galilee well I stand you gazing up into
[1:46:34] heaven this same Jesus which is taken up
[1:46:38] from you into heaven so shall so come in
[1:46:40] like manner as you have seen him go into
[1:46:42] heaven
[1:46:44] now they knew that he was alive now
[1:46:46] but he did not appear in that form again
[1:46:49] once he ascended he did not appear in
[1:46:52] that form again at least to them
[1:46:54] and so how would they prove to Future
[1:46:56] Generations
[1:46:57] that he was alive
[1:47:00] think about it because eventually that
[1:47:02] generation would pass away
[1:47:04] so there had to come some further proof
[1:47:07] that he was alive
[1:47:09] and it comes in Acts chapter 2.
[1:47:11] with the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:47:13] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:47:15] place and suddenly he that ascended has
[1:47:17] also descended
[1:47:20] and there came a sound from Heaven as of
[1:47:22] a rushing Mighty Wind it filled all the
[1:47:23] house where they were sinning they
[1:47:25] appeared into them coven tongues it's
[1:47:26] like a fire and it said upon each of
[1:47:28] them and they were all filled with the
[1:47:29] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:47:31] tongues since the spirit gave them
[1:47:32] utterance what was it it was a proof of
[1:47:34] his resurrection they became the proof
[1:47:38] glory to God
[1:47:41] John 14 or 12 he had told them verily
[1:47:43] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[1:47:45] on me the works that I do so he do also
[1:47:47] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:47:49] because I go into my father
[1:47:51] years later Paul is writing to the
[1:47:53] Corinthians I love this as he's wrapping
[1:47:55] up and he's he's proving I love Paul
[1:47:57] because he proves this point
[1:47:59] and he's proven to them he says I
[1:48:01] delivered unto you first of all that
[1:48:03] which also I received how that Christ
[1:48:05] died for our sins according to the
[1:48:07] scriptures
[1:48:08] and that he was buried and that he rose
[1:48:10] again the third day according to the
[1:48:11] scriptures you can deny that if you want
[1:48:14] to but God but that's what Paul said I
[1:48:16] believe what Paul said because there was
[1:48:18] Millions on the other side said we're
[1:48:20] resting on that
[1:48:21] glory to God
[1:48:23] and so now he says he was seen he was a
[1:48:27] scene of cephas that's Peter then of the
[1:48:29] twelve
[1:48:30] after that he was seen of about 500
[1:48:32] Brethren at once of whom the greater
[1:48:35] part remaining to this President imagine
[1:48:36] what a powerful testimony that was
[1:48:39] yeah he said he was seen of these 500
[1:48:42] but you know back in that day many of
[1:48:44] them that were there you know some of
[1:48:46] them didn't even go to the upper room
[1:48:48] in fact 380 of them never showed up
[1:48:50] because we're only 120 men women and
[1:48:52] children in the upper room
[1:48:54] so I don't know where the other ones
[1:48:56] went but maybe the persecution maybe
[1:48:58] they had a job maybe there was something
[1:48:59] going on but there was 120 in the upper
[1:49:01] room
[1:49:02] so many of them maybe were Witnesses but
[1:49:04] not Believers yeah
[1:49:07] think about that for a moment
[1:49:10] and yet they were seen of all these that
[1:49:12] were there yeah he said the great
[1:49:13] apartment of this present but some are
[1:49:15] falling asleep so now it's been some
[1:49:16] years later
[1:49:18] these are starting to die off yeah he
[1:49:20] said after that he was seen of James
[1:49:22] then of all the apostles
[1:49:24] and last of all
[1:49:29] he was not there when he ascended
[1:49:32] he was not there when he appeared during
[1:49:33] the 40 days yeah
[1:49:35] he was not there any of that time he had
[1:49:38] no claim to that yeah yet when he lists
[1:49:41] the witnesses
[1:49:43] he comes down to the end he says he was
[1:49:45] seen to me yeah
[1:49:48] he said about but brother B doesn't
[1:49:51] appear in that form but the same God
[1:49:52] turned himself back into the pillar of
[1:49:55] fire and struck Paul down on the road to
[1:49:57] Damascus
[1:49:59] you know the story and Paul every time
[1:50:01] he gets in a tight spot he goes right
[1:50:02] back to that testimony why is he why
[1:50:04] does he do that because that's where
[1:50:06] Christ appeared to him
[1:50:09] glory to God and we have to have
[1:50:11] something like that in our lives where
[1:50:12] we've met the pillar of fire where this
[1:50:14] meant this word these people that have
[1:50:16] seen it in our hour they've seen I've
[1:50:18] known sister Brown I've known many of
[1:50:20] the others that that new brother Branham
[1:50:22] or seen brother Branham or had their
[1:50:23] name called out and then seen the sign
[1:50:25] they knew that it was there many of
[1:50:27] those who've seen it have passed on
[1:50:28] thank God we still have the video and
[1:50:30] the tapes but many of those who have
[1:50:32] seen it have passed on but there's
[1:50:34] another generation coming up how will I
[1:50:36] prove to you that he's alive he was seen
[1:50:39] by granted by Sister Brown he was seen
[1:50:41] by many others he was seen by a hibiscus
[1:50:43] he was seen by Peregrine he was seen but
[1:50:46] last of all he was seen by me
[1:50:49] they saw him alive it was more than a
[1:50:51] prophet it was God reacting in this
[1:50:53] generation but you can declare with me
[1:50:55] this morning he was seen by me I mean
[1:50:58] you could say Amen to that today he was
[1:50:59] seen by me in the new bird he was seen
[1:51:01] by me I have met the pillar of fire I
[1:51:04] met the power of this message
[1:51:06] [Music]

[1:51:09] meet that Pillar of Fire you need to
[1:51:11] come in those sacred Sams
[1:51:13] of all he would see to me

[1:51:20] seen by people with that again we've met
[1:51:23] in the prayer lines performing the very
[1:51:25] same Resurrection sign he did when he
[1:51:27] was on the Earth
[1:51:28] picture was taken with a prophet
[1:51:30] that's not just a man that that's a
[1:51:32] pillar of Fire
[1:51:33] it was not the man but the man was a
[1:51:36] vessel he was standing by when Christ
[1:51:38] appeared he appeared in the cloud showed
[1:51:41] himself in the cloud it was our Lord up
[1:51:43] there we see him in the opening of the
[1:51:45] word how many sees him in the opening of
[1:51:47] the word we see him all through the
[1:51:49] scriptures like they did on the road to
[1:51:50] Emmaus
