[36:49] you for it help me Lord to be able to
[36:52] say the things that you want me to say
[36:54] ask in Jesus name amen
[37:01] Exodus Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1.
[37:05] we'll read down to verse 5.
[37:08] we got the new AC unit in so praise the
[37:11] Lord for that and we're those of you who
[37:14] like the cold are going to appreciate
[37:17] that and uh so we're we're thankful for
[37:20] that they got that in this morning
[37:22] we've got the meetings coming up next
[37:25] Thursday a week from tomorrow so I'm
[37:29] looking forward to that this is my
[37:31] Christmas so y'all just have to kind of
[37:33] bear with me a little bit I'm a little
[37:35] excited about it but we've got a bunch
[37:37] of people coming in and from or at least
[37:39] telling us that they're going to from
[37:41] out of town so thank you for your
[37:44] hospitality and and they come to see you
[37:46] all and and to experience the presence
[37:49] of the Lord that we have here and and uh
[37:51] we're just a part of the body of Christ
[37:53] the bride of Christ but we believe we
[37:56] his presence is here and we want to keep
[37:58] it that way and uh so we'll have
[38:01] musicians practice on Sunday night uh
[38:05] after the second service we'll we'll
[38:07] have a short second server us on Sunday
[38:09] we'll have a musician's practice and
[38:11] then they're going to do some cleaning
[38:14] and things as well I think in the
[38:15] fellowship hall isn't good to be a
[38:17] Christian tonight good to see all of you
[38:19] so many of us were all over the place on
[38:22] the fourth of July weekend it's good to
[38:24] see you in the house of the Lord tonight
[38:26] Exodus 3 and 1. now Moses kept the flock
[38:29] of Jethro his father-in-law the priest
[38:32] of Midian and he led the flock to the
[38:34] back side of the desert and came to the
[38:37] Mountain of God even to Horeb and the
[38:40] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[38:42] flame of fire out of the midst of a bush
[38:46] he looked and behold the bush burned
[38:48] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[38:51] and Moses said I will now turn aside and
[38:54] see this great sight why the bush is not
[38:57] burnt
[38:58] when the Lord saw that he turned aside
[39:00] to see God called unto him out of the
[39:03] midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses
[39:06] he said here am I and he said draw not
[39:09] nigh hi hither put off thy shoes from
[39:12] off thy feet for the place where on thou
[39:15] standeth
[39:16] is Holy Ground may the Lord with that is
[39:19] blessing to the word you may be seated
[39:22] we continue our thought of The Exodus
[39:25] family
[39:26] Moses had given up all thought of being
[39:29] a deliverer
[39:31] and sometimes that's what we need to do
[39:34] for God to be able to use us we need to
[39:37] maybe give up all thought of of our
[39:40] plans and our ideas and we talked about
[39:42] that a couple of Wednesday nights ago
[39:45] how that Moses was a prisoner had to
[39:47] become a prisoner to the will of God and
[39:50] and that's what God was doing there on
[39:53] the backside of the desert he was happy
[39:55] to live with his family he was happy to
[39:58] just continue on hurting the sheep and
[40:00] yet God had a great plan for his life
[40:03] God had a great thing that he was going
[40:05] to do and so we we don't we want to
[40:07] realize that the current situation of
[40:10] our life the state that we're in right
[40:12] now it won't always be that way God may
[40:15] be he may be planning to use us in a
[40:18] different way going forward but we've
[40:21] got to be willing to serve him where
[40:23] we're at before we can serve him in a
[40:25] greater way so now Moses had had to get
[40:30] happy with his condition where he was
[40:32] and he had to have all the ambition
[40:34] stripped out of him all the all the
[40:37] learning and things that was going on
[40:39] yet we know that it was time when Moses
[40:42] was there before it was time for the
[40:45] people to be delivered the 400 years was
[40:47] up and so I've wondered many times why
[40:50] did God wait but brother Branham says
[40:52] this he said a prophet can never deliver
[40:54] his message unless the people wants to
[40:57] hear it so God just called his Prophet
[41:00] Into the Wilderness he said sure took
[41:02] him out there let the people suffer a
[41:05] little longer till they was ready he
[41:07] said Moses was ready God was ready but
[41:09] the people wasn't they stayed 40 years
[41:11] longer because they wasn't ready that's
[41:13] exactly right could I say this maybe
[41:16] Moses was too ready
[41:19] maybe he was too ready because part of
[41:22] being a leader is that you've got to
[41:24] wait on the people
[41:26] to be ready
[41:28] so God had to strip his ambition
[41:30] remember that's what got him in trouble
[41:31] that's why he ends up with a stinking
[41:33] dead Egyptian in the sand is because he
[41:37] has uh he's actually had to be stripped
[41:40] of his ambition and his ambition gets
[41:43] him in trouble now uh Moses was the
[41:46] deliverer he was the one that God called
[41:48] and I believe God has called us in this
[41:51] hour to be the Overcomers of laodicea
[41:53] how many believe that tonight he's
[41:55] called each and every one of us to be
[41:57] the Overcomers of laodicea then what do
[42:00] we have to well we we're gonna we're
[42:02] gonna be that we're gonna We believe
[42:03] we're gonna be in a rapture we we
[42:05] believe we're the called of God we're
[42:07] the elected of God we're the Bride of
[42:09] Jesus Christ we're going to move
[42:11] mountains we're going to see the sick
[42:12] healed and the dead rays and the power
[42:14] of God move we're going to see those
[42:16] things
[42:17] and yet we remain many times on the
[42:19] backside of the desert why because God's
[42:22] doing something in our lives
[42:25] so being a prisoner of Christ requires
[42:28] you to wait until his time yeah
[42:32] and he does have a Time
[42:34] and we know that in Moses life there was
[42:37] there was uh three 40-year periods in
[42:40] each 40-year period had its purpose
[42:43] and I like to think about Moses because
[42:46] he lived a long time you know Jesus
[42:48] Jesus was crucified before he was even
[42:50] my age
[42:52] if he was 33. and I'm fixing to be 38.
[42:56] and I'm just using that because it makes
[42:58] me feel really old
[43:00] and he had already done his work
[43:02] and they say that the best years of your
[43:05] ministry is the first three years I
[43:06] think they saved your ministry but the
[43:08] Joel's the best year of your ministry
[43:10] best years of your ministry so that's a
[43:12] long time ago brother Danny a long time
[43:15] ago and yet I believe that each period
[43:18] of life has its own purpose
[43:20] it has its own every season has its own
[43:23] fruits
[43:24] right every time of year has its own
[43:27] purpose so am I we just realized that
[43:30] tonight now Moses had to go in brother
[43:34] Brown said and be the highest educated
[43:36] man in all the country
[43:38] he can teach the Egyptians wisdom he was
[43:41] a military man we're told by history he
[43:44] knew all the ins and outs how to do it
[43:46] and God let him get trained like that
[43:48] now listen to prove that you cannot
[43:52] accomplish for God in that manner
[43:55] come on come on he wasn't going to use
[43:58] one bit of his military training
[44:01] he wasn't going to use one bit of his
[44:03] Egyptian training in the Egyptian
[44:06] philosophies and and the Egyptian
[44:08] psychology he wasn't going to use any of
[44:10] it
[44:12] but what he did is he allowed him to be
[44:14] trained in that way so it was God's
[44:16] purpose for Moses to go be trained
[44:19] God caused him to be found by Pharaoh's
[44:22] daughter he was born into Pharaoh's
[44:24] house God wanted him to see that that
[44:27] would never work
[44:29] so in order for him to kill the Egyptian
[44:32] and see that that would never work and
[44:34] end up fleeing from the house of pharaoh
[44:37] he first had to join the house of
[44:38] pharaoh
[44:39] right so God had to let him get trained
[44:42] like that he says he uh he cannot
[44:45] accomplish to prove that you cannot
[44:46] accomplish for God in that manner his
[44:48] military all of his genius mind all of
[44:51] his education he bitterly and miserably
[44:54] failed by it God let him do it let him
[44:57] be educated and smart
[45:00] not because he was going to use his
[45:02] education
[45:04] because he was going to use his
[45:05] smartness if that's a word
[45:08] not because he's going to do that use
[45:10] any of that but he actually is he's
[45:12] going to use the space created by Moses
[45:16] weakness is what he's going to use but
[45:18] Moses has got to realize that none of
[45:20] that's going to work so God allows him
[45:22] to be smart so he can prove to him that
[45:25] smart don't isn't enough
[45:27] he allows him to be educated so he can
[45:29] prove to him that being educated is not
[45:31] enough
[45:33] so he met her he bitterly and miserably
[45:36] failed back God let him do it let him be
[45:38] educated be smart and I know what you're
[45:40] thinking Lord I why didn't you let our
[45:43] pastor be educated and smart
[45:45] or maybe why didn't you let me be
[45:47] educated and smart but he allowed Moses
[45:49] just to show him that wasn't enough
[45:52] and then it took him 40 years to educate
[45:55] him and then 40 years to beat it out of
[45:57] him
[45:59] and both was intended by God
[46:02] so I want you to see tonight both of
[46:04] those things were intended by God for
[46:07] the purposes of God yeah
[46:08] before he could use him he said that's
[46:10] right that's right took him out on the
[46:12] back side of the desert got rid of all
[46:13] the education he had yeah
[46:15] again he said he had him trained in
[46:17] worldly wisdom so that he could fail
[46:21] I believe God would do that he trained
[46:25] him in worldly wisdom so that he could
[46:27] fail and show that it isn't wisdom that
[46:29] will ever be delivered by
[46:31] oh my it's by faith that we're delivered
[46:35] and God sometimes will let us figure it
[46:37] all out and lay it all out and have
[46:39] everything just the way we want it we
[46:41] got all of our plans and all of our
[46:43] designs and all of our life figured out
[46:45] just to show us that it won't work
[46:47] yes yes sir
[46:49] oh my what's he doing he shows us that
[46:52] will never be delivered by wisdom will
[46:54] only be delivered by faith
[46:57] God bringing Deliverance had to train
[46:59] him in wisdom to let him fall
[47:03] to show that you cannot lean upon the
[47:06] arm of your own understanding or anybody
[47:08] else's understanding
[47:11] you're asked me anytime God will allow
[47:13] you to go through something he'll allow
[47:15] you to go through a season as a church
[47:17] you realize that he'll allow you to go
[47:19] through a season and you'll be lifted up
[47:21] and everybody will be talking good about
[47:22] you and everything be going on and then
[47:24] he'll allow something to happen and
[47:26] something comes and it kind of cuts you
[47:28] down he said why would he let us do that
[47:29] he wants you to see that it won't be by
[47:32] might it won't be by power but it'll be
[47:34] by the spirit of the Lord
[47:36] yes sir
[47:38] you let him become the highest
[47:40] until he would be
[47:42] the next pharaoh
[47:44] he was a mighty General according to
[47:46] history conquered Moses himself to
[47:48] countries around and then when he turned
[47:51] to the work of the Lord with all of his
[47:52] talent God let him take a headlong
[47:55] topple
[47:59] oh because at 40 years old Moses was
[48:01] still a baby
[48:03] when it come to the things of God
[48:06] take a headlong
[48:08] so that he could put him out there
[48:14] out there in humility and sent him down
[48:17] with a stick in his hand to deliver the
[48:20] people
[48:21] oh my
[48:23] Moses had an understanding that he was
[48:25] to be the deliverer from the teaching of
[48:26] his mother
[48:27] he said he'd trained himself in military
[48:29] might to do so but it failed he had the
[48:31] understanding he had the education but
[48:34] that didn't work so he had to forget it
[48:36] all and come to the simple thing of
[48:38] taking God in his word and then he
[48:40] delivered the people
[48:42] that's how you overcome listen to me
[48:44] church that's how you receive your
[48:45] healing that's how you receive Miracles
[48:48] that's how you come close to God that's
[48:50] how you deliver the people that's how
[48:51] you raise your family when you come to
[48:53] the simple thing I'm going to take God
[48:55] at his word if God says so I believe it
[48:59] and I'm gonna follow it to the best of
[49:01] my ability why but you're just taking
[49:03] God in this word in the Simplicity of it
[49:05] that's how your family is brought up
[49:06] that's how your family is restored
[49:08] that's how your your kids are brought in
[49:10] that's the thing that God wants
[49:12] to be an overcomer you've got to
[49:16] allow the simple thing of taking God in
[49:18] his word to become the main thing in
[49:20] your life now
[49:22] after all this training and untraining
[49:26] laughs
[49:28] God's getting ready to do something
[49:32] but before he can do it
[49:34] he has to get Moses in his presence
[49:39] five minutes
[49:41] is all he needed
[49:44] I want you to think about this tonight
[49:46] five minutes
[49:49] it's all he needed yeah he spent 40
[49:51] years
[49:52] getting him trained in Egypt 40 years
[49:55] getting him untrained but when he come
[49:58] in the presence of God he only needed
[50:01] five minutes
[50:02] in the presence of the pillar of Fire
[50:06] now why did he need to come in that
[50:09] presence
[50:10] we know that the pillar of fire is the
[50:13] logos or the word that was manifested in
[50:16] visible form
[50:18] condescending to be seen
[50:22] right so God could not be seen
[50:25] no man has seen God at any time and so
[50:27] the logos is simply God coming into a
[50:30] form
[50:31] so that he can be seen
[50:34] right so now that form that he can be
[50:38] seen in was called the logos
[50:40] Brown said now that Pillar of Fire is
[50:43] the logos that went out of God
[50:46] the logos which is actually the
[50:48] attribute of the fullness of God I was
[50:52] fellowshipping actually with brother
[50:53] Jason Ward the other night by text about
[50:55] this thought that God does not diminish
[50:58] himself by it by how great he can be so
[51:02] great and yet not diminish himself by
[51:04] changing himself
[51:06] and brother random calls that he said
[51:08] and we studied it back when we were
[51:09] talking about the breach and he changed
[51:12] his strain he changed his strain I never
[51:14] understood that until covet happened
[51:18] you say what does that have to do with
[51:19] covet well coven changed its strain you
[51:22] remember remember we had one strain and
[51:24] then they said all the vaccines aren't
[51:25] going to work or nothing because it's
[51:26] Omicron now
[51:28] coven changed it's straight it was still
[51:31] covered but it changes strength but what
[51:33] did it do it diminished it yeah
[51:35] every time a virus changes its strain it
[51:38] loses something
[51:40] oh my every time any any sort of DNA any
[51:43] sort of living thing when it changes its
[51:45] strain it loses something but God
[51:47] changed his strength without losing any
[51:49] of his power without losing any of his
[51:51] ability without losing anything because
[51:53] he's he's Almighty
[51:56] right if you've got a if you've got a
[51:59] pound of sugar and you take out half a
[52:01] pound you you got half a pound left
[52:05] right because it's a it's a fallible
[52:07] resource
[52:08] it's not infinite
[52:10] it's a finite resource
[52:12] but when you take the logos
[52:16] out of God you haven't diminished
[52:18] anything
[52:25] don't worry can you see it tonight he
[52:27] had to come in the presence of the
[52:29] logons
[52:31] and it's simpler than what we think it
[52:33] is
[52:34] because that same presence that we feel
[52:37] in the service
[52:39] that same presence that is the logos the
[52:42] presence of God
[52:44] yes sir it is actually God condescending
[52:47] not to be seen with eyes but to be felt
[52:52] it has to be
[52:54] sure and we'll get to that in a moment
[52:55] now
[52:56] when president said when God becoming to
[52:58] a formed work can be seen
[53:00] it was the anointing of the great spirit
[53:02] that went forth It's condescending
[53:04] coming down God the father of the logos
[53:07] that was up over Israel he was holy
[53:09] could not bear sin
[53:11] now we know that God's presence can be
[53:14] felt how many have ever felt God's
[53:16] presence
[53:17] it can be felt
[53:20] it can be felt
[53:22] I've often wondered what Moses felt like
[53:24] the Bible doesn't record what he felt
[53:27] like but we know he saw the visible
[53:28] presence of God he saw God in a burning
[53:32] bush but there had to be a feeling
[53:35] associated with that a feeling of
[53:38] Awesomeness a feeling of Wonder a
[53:40] feeling maybe of Joy a feeling uh maybe
[53:43] a fear in some way of if this is the
[53:45] almighty God
[53:47] that he's about to come up to
[53:49] so now we know that that presence can be
[53:52] felt the writer said it this way he said
[53:54] I feel I feel filled with the spirit
[53:57] right now
[53:58] I feel the Holy Ghost
[54:01] I feel his presence
[54:03] I know he's here he said I'm positive
[54:05] he's here I see him yes sir
[54:08] now brother Brandon being a prophet many
[54:10] times would say can't you see that and
[54:12] the people couldn't see it right there
[54:14] would be a pill the logos would be in
[54:16] the meeting
[54:17] right yes don't let it throw you off too
[54:20] far but the logos is always in the
[54:22] meeting
[54:23] the logos are still in the meeting today
[54:26] because God's here
[54:28] where two or three are gathered together
[54:30] I will be in their midst what forms he
[54:32] going to be in
[54:33] he's going to be in in the condescending
[54:36] form that we can feel him in and we can
[54:38] know that he's here
[54:40] right and I believe brother said the
[54:42] only thing that keeps you from seeing
[54:43] into that other dimension to actually
[54:44] see the form that he's in to see that
[54:47] Pillar of Fire to see those angels He
[54:49] said it's the flesh
[54:50] that it's actually this this flesh keeps
[54:53] us and that's why he said the servant of
[54:56] Elisha when when he couldn't see saw the
[54:58] syrians coming against the city and and
[55:00] the prophet told him so there's more
[55:02] with with us than be with them
[55:04] and he said well I don't see anybody
[55:06] else and the prophet said open his eyes
[55:08] Lord
[55:09] when the prophet prayed for his eyes to
[55:10] be opened he saw horses and Chariots of
[55:13] Fire on all the mountains but the man
[55:14] said if you could press Beyond the Veil
[55:16] of the flesh you would see Angels after
[55:18] position at every pew
[55:21] oh my what is it it's another it's in
[55:24] another dimension but it it calm
[55:26] descends down to this Dimension to be
[55:29] felt by his people
[55:32] he said I see him I know he's here I see
[55:35] him moving that great Pillar of Fire
[55:36] glory in a manifestation of his being
[55:39] the deity of his presence
[55:41] great August
[55:43] being
[55:44] now you do not
[55:47] and I want to be careful with this
[55:49] because we do not base our faith on how
[55:51] we feel
[55:52] right we don't base our faiths on being
[55:54] able to feel the logos
[55:56] right that's why it's called faith faith
[55:59] is when there's nothing there but you
[56:00] believe in Sarah anyway
[56:02] that's faith
[56:04] but the logos the presence of God is
[56:06] there he allows you to feel that because
[56:08] many times that builds our faith and he
[56:11] lets us do that now but you've got to
[56:13] believe it or you can't feel it
[56:16] and that's why many times a stranger
[56:18] could come in Among Us or maybe somebody
[56:19] that's backslid or maybe sometimes us
[56:22] ourselves when we're not in the service
[56:24] we're not participating in the service
[56:26] we're here but we're still fixing the
[56:28] car we're here but we're still at work
[56:31] right and we can't feel the presence of
[56:34] God
[56:35] and other people might be able to enter
[56:36] in sitting right beside you
[56:38] and tears streaming down their face and
[56:41] they're worshiping and and praising God
[56:43] they can feel the presence of God and
[56:45] you're sitting there so I don't feel
[56:46] nothing
[56:47] well you've got to believe who's here
[56:49] before you can feel it
[56:52] and to believe the whole mind don't you
[56:54] realize what God did for us in this day
[56:55] he didn't give us just any kind of word
[56:57] he gave us a word of authority that you
[57:00] could see that God was speaking in our
[57:02] hour that you could hear the word that
[57:04] was spoken when I preached the message
[57:06] of the hour he said the pillar of fire
[57:08] always accompanies the message of the
[57:10] hour
[57:11] so then you would know and you could
[57:13] have faith to believe God's here
[57:15] the word is here that means God is here
[57:19] right or do you see it tonight
[57:21] amen I hope I'm not going to
[57:23] too deep for us but I want us to
[57:25] understand there is a validity
[57:28] to feelings
[57:29] it's not where we place our faith
[57:31] but there is a real feeling of the
[57:33] presence of God
[57:36] people would feel when they came near
[57:38] the pillar of Fire
[57:40] now brother Branham
[57:42] he does this hundreds of times
[57:44] and he would explain it to the people as
[57:46] they come up
[57:47] in this instance he said how do you do
[57:49] we're strangers to each other the sister
[57:51] says yes Lord Jesus knows us both
[57:54] he said now don't be afraid see then
[57:57] you're kind of feet just relax
[57:59] it's his presence
[58:01] and many times and maybe this will help
[58:03] us when brother Brown was talking see if
[58:06] you're all nervous and you're all bound
[58:07] up and and your old tits and and under
[58:11] strain you can't receive from God like
[58:13] you do when you're relaxed
[58:16] and brother Brandon would tell the
[58:17] people he said Relax and say let that
[58:20] man speak to me
[58:22] when they come up they would be tense
[58:24] because they would feel something was
[58:25] different they would feel that that that
[58:28] the presence of the Angel and brother
[58:30] random would tell them he'd say relax
[58:33] relax he said and begin to think on the
[58:36] blessings of God think on the word of
[58:38] God think on the mercy of God many times
[58:39] we come to church two tents free and
[58:42] that's why we don't we're tense about
[58:44] the days of this we're tense about the
[58:45] unpaid bills but if you could just relax
[58:48] a little bit and let yourself come into
[58:50] another realm you begin to feel the
[58:52] presence of God maybe somebody would
[58:53] come say well I've been to church over
[58:55] and over I never feel the presence of
[58:56] God I don't ever maybe it's because
[58:58] you're you're seeing a pillar of fire
[59:00] but you don't recognize it as something
[59:03] Supernatural
[59:04] it was Moses faith when he saw the
[59:07] pillar of fire that caused him to
[59:08] recognize brother Harvey that that
[59:10] Pillar of Fire was a supernatural being
[59:13] otherwise it was just another burning
[59:15] bush
[59:18] got hit by lightning or something else
[59:19] my brother Brown said he didn't try to
[59:21] make it scientific
[59:22] try to figure it out he said let me turn
[59:25] aside and see
[59:27] oh my
[59:29] God oh look
[59:31] he said now just relax it's this present
[59:33] see that's it it's his presence
[59:35] he said no you have a real strange
[59:37] feeling odd
[59:38] kind of a sweet humble like feeling
[59:41] now standing in the presence of a man
[59:44] wouldn't make you feel that way
[59:47] oh my God I'll be honest I'd be honored
[59:51] to stand in the presence of William
[59:52] Branham but what they were feeling was
[59:54] not the presence of William Branham it
[59:57] was the presence of the angel
[1:00:00] right and so he says now standing in the
[1:00:02] presence of a man wouldn't make you feel
[1:00:04] that way how many ever seen that light
[1:00:05] that Pillar of Fire pillar of light fire
[1:00:08] it was taken right here in Texas first
[1:00:10] time second time it's hanging he said
[1:00:12] it's hanging right by the woman
[1:00:15] in this Dimension now
[1:00:18] you remember what happened we watched
[1:00:19] the video here a few Wednesday nights
[1:00:21] ago where he talked to the to the black
[1:00:23] women that were sitting back in the
[1:00:25] audience and that Pillar of Fire moved
[1:00:27] over him he said can't you see that
[1:00:28] Pillar of Fire it's hanging over a
[1:00:30] colored lady sitting back in the corner
[1:00:32] and she began to shout why she felt the
[1:00:34] presence of it she probably didn't see
[1:00:36] it but she felt the presence of it
[1:00:39] and she knew that it was that it was
[1:00:41] that it was real
[1:00:43] right oh my she'd been able to touch by
[1:00:45] faith she'd touch the presence of God
[1:00:48] now
[1:00:50] God dwells in another dimension only
[1:00:52] accessible by faith
[1:00:54] but when it comes to our five senses
[1:00:57] it's his condescending that's what he
[1:00:59] did in Christ he he poured himself into
[1:01:01] Christ and they never saw the pillar of
[1:01:02] fire while Christ was here because he
[1:01:04] was the pillar of fire he was the low
[1:01:06] cost he was in the form of the son of
[1:01:09] God
[1:01:09] in the form in the form of a body of a
[1:01:13] fish and so he walked among men and and
[1:01:15] but they could touch him that's why the
[1:01:17] Bible says that which we have seen which
[1:01:19] our hands have handled the word of God
[1:01:22] right he was God in flesh
[1:01:24] and so now but but here he said it's
[1:01:28] expedient for you that I go away because
[1:01:29] if I go away I'll come again and I'll
[1:01:31] come in another form
[1:01:33] and in that form of the Holy Ghost or
[1:01:36] the brown calls it turning back into the
[1:01:38] pillar of Fire
[1:01:39] because we know that the pillar of fires
[1:01:41] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:42] right and so when you turn back into the
[1:01:44] pillar of fire it was licks of fire that
[1:01:47] fell on each one of them there on the
[1:01:48] day of Pentecost tongues of fire is what
[1:01:51] the Bible says licks of fire that went
[1:01:53] on each one separated himself into the
[1:01:55] people of God so now he's going he's
[1:01:58] condescending he went back it was
[1:02:00] actually more beneficial for them to
[1:02:02] have that Pillar of Fire and to know
[1:02:04] that he was within them than it was for
[1:02:06] them to be actually with him where they
[1:02:08] could see him and handle him
[1:02:10] so what they had after Pentecost was
[1:02:13] better
[1:02:14] than what they had before that's what he
[1:02:16] told them it would be what we have today
[1:02:18] is better than the literal Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] standing here in front of you now
[1:02:24] because we have the pillar of fire and
[1:02:26] the pillar of fire came back to the age
[1:02:28] it was not with just a man but it was
[1:02:31] Return of the word and the fullness of
[1:02:33] the word came the fullness of the spirit
[1:02:35] as well to dwell among the people
[1:02:38] are you with me so far
[1:02:41] well you said brother Ben what does his
[1:02:43] presence feel like
[1:02:44] well David
[1:02:46] it was a man who knew the presence of
[1:02:48] God
[1:02:50] and he says this he says in psalm 16 11
[1:02:53] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[1:02:58] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[1:03:02] forevermore
[1:03:04] and he describes in Psalm 63 and 1 how
[1:03:08] that his how he thirsted for the
[1:03:10] presence of God
[1:03:12] he said oh God Thou Art my God early
[1:03:15] will I seek thee in other words that's
[1:03:18] that word is fervently will I seek thee
[1:03:22] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[1:03:26] longest for thee in a dry and thirsty
[1:03:29] land where no water is in the original
[1:03:31] it says my flesh faints
[1:03:34] My Flesh faints I I I can't make it
[1:03:37] without your presence Moses said that he
[1:03:39] said if your presence doesn't go with us
[1:03:41] don't send us
[1:03:43] I need something that I can see
[1:03:46] something that's real and sometimes we
[1:03:49] need something we need to go beyond just
[1:03:51] a theory and we need to spend five
[1:03:54] minutes in the presence of God where
[1:03:56] we'll know that we met him and we know
[1:03:58] that he's real
[1:04:02] did my flesh faints Longs for thee in a
[1:04:05] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[1:04:07] to see that power and my glory so as I
[1:04:11] have seen thee in the sanctuary
[1:04:14] because thy loving kindness is better
[1:04:16] than life my lips shall praise thee thus
[1:04:19] will I bless you while I live I will
[1:04:21] lift up my hands in thy name so he's
[1:04:22] he's describing reactions to the
[1:04:24] presence of God now Joy is not the
[1:04:27] presence of God lifting of hands is not
[1:04:29] the presence of God praising him with
[1:04:30] your lips is not the presence of God but
[1:04:32] it is a Biblical reaction to the
[1:04:35] presence of God
[1:04:38] right yeah Clapping Your Hands and
[1:04:40] worshiping worshiping with a loud the
[1:04:42] Bible says well on the loud symbols
[1:04:44] worshiping him with a loud song
[1:04:46] worshiping him in the quietness of of
[1:04:49] the early morning worshiping him on your
[1:04:51] bed at night those are all biblical ways
[1:04:54] to acknowledge the presence of the Lord
[1:04:58] when did you worship the word worship is
[1:05:01] to prospect yourself before a Majesty
[1:05:03] when would you worship the king
[1:05:06] now think about it when would you
[1:05:08] worship Him
[1:05:09] when you come in his presence
[1:05:12] that's when you worship it when you come
[1:05:14] in his presence now if you realize he's
[1:05:16] always with you what does that make you
[1:05:18] constantly it makes you a worshiper
[1:05:23] it makes you a worshiper
[1:05:26] wake up in the morning and say oh God
[1:05:28] I'm so glad you've given me another day
[1:05:32] you've given me strength in my hands to
[1:05:34] work thank you for being with me
[1:05:37] thank you for me he says when my soul
[1:05:39] shall be satisfied with mods with Morrow
[1:05:42] and fatness my mouth shall praise thee
[1:05:45] with joyful lips oh God you're so lovely
[1:05:48] you're so wonderful you're so great to
[1:05:50] me now I'm not just in church but all
[1:05:52] day long
[1:05:53] because I know your presence is with me
[1:05:55] I know it even when I can't feel it
[1:05:57] because I know your word says that I'll
[1:05:59] be with you even in you
[1:06:02] who am I
[1:06:03] so he says when I remember thee upon my
[1:06:06] bed and meditate on thee in the night
[1:06:08] watches because there has been my help
[1:06:10] therefore in the shadow of thy Wings
[1:06:13] will I rejoice in the shade of your
[1:06:16] presence
[1:06:18] brother Branham he identifies it like
[1:06:20] this and talking about the pillar of
[1:06:21] fire and I don't have time to bring all
[1:06:22] the quotes tonight but he talked about
[1:06:24] sunlight and he talked about warmth he
[1:06:27] said you may not a man who was blind he
[1:06:30] said could not see the sun
[1:06:32] and so he could never prove the sun was
[1:06:35] there by sight
[1:06:37] because he didn't have access to that
[1:06:39] dimension
[1:06:40] right but he felt its warmth
[1:06:43] and he could know when the Sun was
[1:06:45] shining
[1:06:46] because of the warmth of it on his skin
[1:06:48] because he can still feel even if he
[1:06:51] can't see and though you may not be able
[1:06:52] to see the pillar of fire even though I
[1:06:54] believe God could make himself visible
[1:06:56] even in this Dimension like he did in
[1:06:58] the picture you understand he actually
[1:07:00] condescended into this Dimension but
[1:07:03] many times the pillar of fires in
[1:07:04] another dimension and it couldn't his
[1:07:06] picture couldn't be taken in another
[1:07:08] dimension by a camera couldn't be taken
[1:07:10] taken by a video recorder in another
[1:07:12] dimension but uh but the warmth of the
[1:07:15] spirit of God the warmth of the pillar
[1:07:17] of fire the warmth of the burning bush
[1:07:19] can still be felt
[1:07:22] is good
[1:07:24] think I'm crazy but it's the truth
[1:07:27] the Browns had a man that believes now
[1:07:29] there's the key
[1:07:31] I challenge you to believe
[1:07:34] you know we have meetings and there's no
[1:07:35] difference in whether God's with us in
[1:07:37] the meeting or a Wednesday night service
[1:07:40] that God was with us tonight well
[1:07:44] he's with us right now
[1:07:47] but what it does it raises your faith
[1:07:50] it raises your expectation
[1:07:53] I told you it's my Christmas man I I
[1:07:55] want to I want to see the presence of I
[1:07:57] want to feel the presence of God I want
[1:07:59] to participate and be fed by the word of
[1:08:01] God just like you get fed by the word of
[1:08:03] God why because I begin to feel that
[1:08:05] sunlight it begins to filter down that
[1:08:07] warmth that comes over me and it raises
[1:08:09] my faith
[1:08:10] it raises by faith to a place that I can
[1:08:13] believe God believe me for my healing
[1:08:15] believe me I got things I need to
[1:08:17] believe God for I know many of you have
[1:08:19] things you need to believe God for and
[1:08:20] so you need to be in the meeting make
[1:08:22] every effort to be in a meeting because
[1:08:24] when we gather together all those licks
[1:08:26] of fire come together what happens it
[1:08:28] raises our faith
[1:08:30] it raises our faith in the presence of
[1:08:32] God a man that believes in God can see
[1:08:35] the presence of God feel the presence of
[1:08:37] God sense the presence of God and know
[1:08:40] he's here
[1:08:41] he is here to answer everything that he
[1:08:43] made promise for in this thing he
[1:08:45] promised you your healing he promised
[1:08:47] you salvation he promised the salvation
[1:08:49] of your children and he's here to answer
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:52] many times in a in a service like this
[1:08:54] one tonight where you feel the presence
[1:08:56] of God your faith begins to be elevated
[1:08:59] and you begin to see things happen right
[1:09:02] You Must Believe to benefit from his
[1:09:05] presence Hebrews 11 and 6 but without
[1:09:07] faith
[1:09:08] it is impossible to please him for he
[1:09:11] that cometh to God the person who would
[1:09:14] approach the presence of the logos
[1:09:17] must believe that he is
[1:09:19] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:09:22] diligently seek him
[1:09:25] with faith
[1:09:27] caused Moses to turn aside
[1:09:29] and go to the meeting
[1:09:32] right you can use it that way Faith
[1:09:34] caused him to go to church that night
[1:09:37] Faith said it's hard on me tonight but
[1:09:40] I'm gonna go I'm going to turn aside
[1:09:42] I'm gonna take five minutes
[1:09:45] and five minutes is all God needed
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:49] amen he didn't need three hours he
[1:09:51] didn't need 24 hours he needed five
[1:09:53] minutes
[1:09:54] and Moses said I'm going to take five
[1:09:56] minutes I wonder how many times we rush
[1:09:58] out of the service we rush on to Homer
[1:10:00] we rush down to the place where we're
[1:10:02] going to either we or we go somewhere
[1:10:04] else and we rush through the day and we
[1:10:06] don't take that five minutes to spend in
[1:10:07] the presence of God not realizing that
[1:10:10] could be the most crucial five minutes
[1:10:11] of our life that morning prayer might be
[1:10:13] the most crucial five minutes that there
[1:10:15] ever was that time we spent in the
[1:10:17] scripture might be the time to change
[1:10:19] our life because we're in the presence
[1:10:21] of the logo
[1:10:25] Faith to cause him to turn aside all
[1:10:28] that he would stir up your faith he
[1:10:30] would stir up my faith tonight to turn
[1:10:32] aside for five minutes
[1:10:34] in the presence of God
[1:10:37] he didn't try to explain it
[1:10:38] scientifically
[1:10:40] but he just turned aside
[1:10:43] now Moses needed to be in the presence
[1:10:45] of God to be changed
[1:10:48] and to receive his Commission
[1:10:50] for what he was already born to do
[1:10:53] brother Brown Stadium was brought up
[1:10:55] under the very precept of Education
[1:10:56] under every precept of Education that
[1:10:59] could be brought
[1:11:00] he was a king son but still trying
[1:11:03] himself failed to make it go over
[1:11:06] but in five minutes hey brother man
[1:11:08] where'd you get five minutes from the
[1:11:09] prophets of the age he says it over and
[1:11:12] over and over again
[1:11:13] he said but in five minutes in the
[1:11:15] presence of the burning bush he'd become
[1:11:16] a new person
[1:11:18] amen oh if Moses said no now listen if
[1:11:23] he had known that that was going to be
[1:11:24] the life-changing event that that was
[1:11:26] going to be the moment that it was he
[1:11:28] would have made he'd have done
[1:11:29] everything he could not to miss it
[1:11:30] listen if you realize that you're five
[1:11:32] minutes in the presence of God could
[1:11:34] change your life you do everything you
[1:11:36] could to be in that presence
[1:11:38] you'd lay aside everything
[1:11:41] to turn aside and see the supernatural
[1:11:46] he become a new person something
[1:11:48] happened and what we need today he said
[1:11:51] in our seminaries
[1:11:52] is not so much theology to be taught but
[1:11:54] a burning bush experience where men get
[1:11:57] down before God and meet him face to
[1:11:58] face we need a challenger today like we
[1:12:00] had on that day
[1:12:01] he said what we need is men and women
[1:12:03] who has met God and know what they're
[1:12:05] talking about not somebody trying to
[1:12:07] teach you from some church book or some
[1:12:09] open theology what we need today is a
[1:12:12] man that's been in the presence of a
[1:12:13] burning bush has been born again and
[1:12:15] changed and made a new creature that's
[1:12:17] the type of person we need today that's
[1:12:19] the kind of person that will stay on the
[1:12:21] firing line regardless of what comes or
[1:12:23] goes
[1:12:25] oh my it was Moses in the presence of
[1:12:28] the burning bush
[1:12:29] that's why I believe many of you have
[1:12:31] been in that presence
[1:12:33] let's stay in his presence
[1:12:35] it was Moses in the presence of The
[1:12:37] Burning Bush was better equipped in five
[1:12:39] minutes in the presence of God than 80
[1:12:41] years of schooling he'd given yes yes in
[1:12:43] the presence of God five minutes give
[1:12:46] him more knowledge of God and better
[1:12:48] equipped him than 80 years of schooling
[1:12:52] brother we don't need so much theology
[1:12:54] we need neology today
[1:12:57] five minutes in the presence of the
[1:12:59] burning bush 80 years he'd shun 40 years
[1:13:02] on the desert running and five minutes
[1:13:04] in the presence of God at the burning
[1:13:06] bush he was ready to go
[1:13:09] here you are
[1:13:10] now he said may I say this with
[1:13:13] reverence
[1:13:14] it's tonight that when God calls him in
[1:13:15] many times he has to step out of the
[1:13:17] political ranks
[1:13:18] out of the social ranks and walk out
[1:13:20] into a place if it would be necessary if
[1:13:23] his associates had to say he's gone
[1:13:25] crazy or become a Holy Roller but it's
[1:13:28] that secret place
[1:13:29] that spot yeah yeah he said oh don't
[1:13:32] miss it my loyal friends every one of
[1:13:34] you that's received Christ of all your
[1:13:35] teachings your fine pastors your great
[1:13:37] affiliations with your churches
[1:13:40] which is all right he said don't
[1:13:43] misunderstand me but you're trying to
[1:13:45] place that before this
[1:13:47] you said but in my church the pillar of
[1:13:49] fire is seen in my church we feel the
[1:13:52] presence of God in my church but what
[1:13:54] about you
[1:13:55] have you spent five minutes in The
[1:13:57] Presence of Jehovah or are you just
[1:13:59] relying on the fact that you are
[1:14:01] affiliated with the church
[1:14:03] have you spent five minutes in the
[1:14:05] presence of God have you spent five
[1:14:07] minutes in in the in the knowing that
[1:14:10] he's real where you absolutely all doubt
[1:14:12] was cleared away and you knew beyond the
[1:14:14] shadow of a doubt he's here he's right
[1:14:17] here with me have you gotten to that
[1:14:19] place
[1:14:21] he said you're trying to place that
[1:14:23] before this
[1:14:24] five minutes it don't have to be some
[1:14:26] great thing we have no record of what
[1:14:28] Moses did
[1:14:29] right like it it may he may have run
[1:14:31] around the place we know he made some
[1:14:33] excuses
[1:14:34] tried to argue with God
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:40] some of y'all sitting in church arguing
[1:14:42] with God right now
[1:14:45] he said how do you know well we argue
[1:14:46] with the word
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:50] that's what he did we don't know if he
[1:14:52] jumped and run around the church but we
[1:14:54] know one thing his life was changed
[1:14:56] when he come out of there he come out
[1:14:58] with a new purpose he come out with a
[1:14:59] new heart he'd come out with a new
[1:15:01] desire he come out with a with a goal
[1:15:03] set in his mind he knew what he was born
[1:15:05] to do and he was ready to go do it
[1:15:07] before he had a head knowledge of who he
[1:15:09] was but now he had a heart knowledge of
[1:15:11] who he was
[1:15:12] five minutes in the presence of God
[1:15:14] changed him
[1:15:16] he said that little time that God gets
[1:15:18] you away from your Associates
[1:15:21] get you way back in the corner brings
[1:15:23] you into a place in a secret place where
[1:15:26] that the wisdom of the world becomes so
[1:15:29] unsufficient to where all the education
[1:15:32] that you ever had doesn't mean nothing
[1:15:35] into that divine presence to the lust of
[1:15:37] the eye gets so dim you can't see it
[1:15:40] anymore until the love of money is
[1:15:43] completely vanished away from you oh God
[1:15:46] glad he didn't say money was completely
[1:15:48] vanished away but the love of it
[1:15:51] and when you stand there alone with
[1:15:54] Jehovah God that's the things that
[1:15:56] counts that's the things that makes you
[1:15:58] forget all you ever knew that's where
[1:16:01] Moses had to get what a beautiful
[1:16:03] picture God revealing himself there in a
[1:16:06] burning bush and Moses knew more about
[1:16:08] God in five minutes in the presence of
[1:16:11] that burning bush then he learned 40
[1:16:14] years in Egypt he said that's the place
[1:16:17] to be alone
[1:16:18] with God
[1:16:24] the spirit of God that moved on the face
[1:16:26] of the waters that logos that went from
[1:16:28] God
[1:16:29] moved over the face of the waters
[1:16:31] every seed that was in the water became
[1:16:34] what it was
[1:16:36] in the presence of God
[1:16:40] you realize that's where we stand today
[1:16:42] we've got to spend time in his presence
[1:16:46] and doing that again is it's not
[1:16:48] it's not like well I'm not going to work
[1:16:49] I'm not going to do that but but you
[1:16:51] need to take five minutes
[1:16:53] just five minutes
[1:16:56] that's all he needs
[1:16:58] but five minutes without doubt
[1:17:00] five minutes without fear
[1:17:02] five minutes without looking at what
[1:17:04] somebody else thinks about you
[1:17:07] yeah just break clear through
[1:17:10] for five minutes in the presence of the
[1:17:12] light
[1:17:14] he said Moses
[1:17:16] learn more in five minutes time in the
[1:17:18] presence of that fire and he learned in
[1:17:20] 40 years of education yeah
[1:17:22] he knew more about God in five minutes
[1:17:24] in the presence of that light than he
[1:17:26] did in 40 Years of studying and
[1:17:28] schooling how his mother had taught him
[1:17:31] that he was to be the emancipator of
[1:17:32] Egypt all these Saints he had been
[1:17:34] taught by his mother and by teachers and
[1:17:36] by schools yet he knew more about God in
[1:17:39] five minutes in the presence of that
[1:17:41] light he said I believe today that if
[1:17:43] the teacher would go into the presence
[1:17:45] of God instead of so much schooling and
[1:17:47] trying to twist and to make it fit
[1:17:49] certain theologies just go in the
[1:17:51] presence of God you'll learn about God
[1:17:53] and then we find after that that Moses
[1:17:55] was willing what Moses slacked the
[1:17:57] burning bush had amen he said what we
[1:18:00] lack in our church the Holy Spirit has
[1:18:03] for us
[1:18:04] oh we have needs as a church there's
[1:18:06] things we need but what we lack in our
[1:18:08] church the Holy Spirit has for us do you
[1:18:11] believe that tonight let's spend five
[1:18:13] minutes in his presence and let him give
[1:18:15] us what we need
[1:18:18] for the Bible said in five minutes in
[1:18:19] the presence of that supernatural being
[1:18:21] he was better equipped than all the
[1:18:23] wisdom that Egypt could have given five
[1:18:26] minutes before he was a running coward
[1:18:28] but after that experience of being in
[1:18:30] the presence and knowing that God of the
[1:18:31] Hebrews live he acted different from
[1:18:34] then on
[1:18:35] now Moses needed that five minutes
[1:18:38] because he would face opposition
[1:18:40] you need that five minutes in the
[1:18:42] presence of the pillar of fire because
[1:18:44] you're going to face opposition as a
[1:18:46] husband as a dad as a as a father as a
[1:18:48] mother as a as a worker whatever it is
[1:18:50] that you are you're going to face
[1:18:52] opposition in your calling Satan's going
[1:18:55] to try to come against you he's going to
[1:18:57] try to destroy you there's going to be
[1:18:58] false prophets rise up
[1:19:01] there's going to be false teachers rise
[1:19:03] up you've got to be in the presence of
[1:19:05] God have spent that time in the presence
[1:19:07] of God so you can be ready to face
[1:19:09] opposition here would come Pharaoh
[1:19:11] opposition to Moses here would come
[1:19:13] Janice and Chambers even Aaron and
[1:19:15] Miriam who were who were real children
[1:19:17] of God
[1:19:18] but at times they become Moses
[1:19:20] opposition
[1:19:22] sometimes your opposition becomes those
[1:19:24] of your own house
[1:19:27] you got to set your face
[1:19:29] make sure you've been in the presence of
[1:19:31] God
[1:19:32] at one time the whole nation wanted to
[1:19:35] kill Moses
[1:19:37] and God even came down and said step out
[1:19:40] of the way Moses I'm going to destroy
[1:19:41] him
[1:19:43] but Moses
[1:19:45] because he'd spent five minutes
[1:19:48] in that great attribute of God called
[1:19:50] luck
[1:19:53] he displayed the character of that light
[1:19:57] he displayed the character of that logos
[1:20:00] he displayed the character of Christ and
[1:20:02] he said Lord save me first
[1:20:06] don't take them take me and he stood in
[1:20:09] the breach for the people why because of
[1:20:11] five minutes in the presence of God
[1:20:13] five minutes before he was a coward but
[1:20:16] now he was a warrior
[1:20:20] you know I'm going to digress for a
[1:20:22] moment I'm almost done
[1:20:25] but you know there's two ways to to cook
[1:20:27] a steak on a grill
[1:20:31] just had to bring that up didn't I some
[1:20:33] of y'all haven't had dinner yet
[1:20:37] there's two ways to cook a steak on a
[1:20:39] grill you can sear it and then cook it
[1:20:43] right or you can cook it and then sear
[1:20:45] it
[1:20:47] now what do you do what are you doing
[1:20:49] when you sear a steak I know this is way
[1:20:52] off the beaten path but just hang with
[1:20:54] me
[1:20:55] when you sear a steak what you're doing
[1:20:57] is you're getting it in the presence of
[1:20:59] the fire
[1:21:00] right because if you've got it on your
[1:21:02] grill you got it way away from the flame
[1:21:03] you don't want to burn it but if you're
[1:21:05] going to sear it you got to get it right
[1:21:07] on the Fire
[1:21:09] put it right close to the fire so it can
[1:21:12] be seared and what that does is it melts
[1:21:15] on the outside most of the fat and and
[1:21:17] all the little pieces on the outside and
[1:21:19] causes them to
[1:21:20] coagulate together I guess that's the
[1:21:22] word it caused them to all melt together
[1:21:25] and what it does is it creates a crust
[1:21:27] and you wouldn't think that would be
[1:21:29] good but it's it's essential to having a
[1:21:31] good steak
[1:21:33] right and so you can do that either at
[1:21:35] the beginning of the Cook or at the end
[1:21:37] now when Paul come to God and remember
[1:21:40] we don't judge people's experience only
[1:21:42] by the word
[1:21:43] right Paul comes to God and he he has an
[1:21:46] experience with God God Sears him by the
[1:21:50] fire
[1:21:51] right and then he takes him and Cooks
[1:21:53] him on the back side of the desert
[1:21:57] right maybe he's ready
[1:22:01] Moses got cooked literally in the desert
[1:22:07] that's why God sends the desert he had
[1:22:09] to cook them
[1:22:10] Moses got cooked and then it was called
[1:22:13] her hey with paulus called her or with
[1:22:16] Moses called a reverse sear a reverse
[1:22:18] sear is when you cook them first and
[1:22:20] then you sear it
[1:22:22] the end products the same
[1:22:24] now God might have cooked you first and
[1:22:26] then he's going to sear you now he might
[1:22:28] have seared you first and now he's going
[1:22:30] to cook you but either way he's going to
[1:22:32] pick a finished product he's going to
[1:22:34] get what he wants out aren't you glad
[1:22:36] for that today
[1:22:37] and brother Brown said every man that
[1:22:39] goes to the field to preach the gospel
[1:22:40] should never leave until he has that
[1:22:42] back of the desert experience to all
[1:22:43] them juices are seared in
[1:22:45] no one could explain that out of your
[1:22:47] mind he said no matter how much they
[1:22:49] twist the scriptures and say this sad or
[1:22:50] the other if you've ever met God face to
[1:22:52] face in the true baptism of the Holy
[1:22:54] Spirit there's not enough theologians in
[1:22:56] the world to ever erase it from your
[1:22:57] memory something happened you were there
[1:22:59] when a man gets that place there's no
[1:23:01] one can explain it from him but you see
[1:23:03] you don't don't get discouraged say well
[1:23:04] I wasn't seared I started with God and I
[1:23:06] went maybe years
[1:23:08] and I never really never really had that
[1:23:10] great experience with god well he just
[1:23:12] waiting he's going to sear you
[1:23:16] think I'm crazy but I'm not
[1:23:21] just wait
[1:23:22] you're gonna come in the presence that
[1:23:23] fire one day
[1:23:26] don't get discouraged
[1:23:27] don't give up so I've not had that great
[1:23:29] experience so maybe you're looking to
[1:23:31] emotion what you need to do is look by
[1:23:33] faith say hey I see the supernatural
[1:23:36] let me turn aside and get in the
[1:23:39] presence of the light
[1:23:42] but Brothers many most of us I think he
[1:23:46] he Sears us gives us that good
[1:23:48] experience
[1:23:49] then we start going through some things
[1:23:53] he said when the person finds that place
[1:23:55] in Christ the faith that says by his
[1:23:57] stripes I'm Healed there could not be
[1:24:00] enough doctors in the world tell you you
[1:24:02] were fixing to die no matter what your
[1:24:04] symptoms are you still believe it anyhow
[1:24:07] right
[1:24:08] he needed courage
[1:24:10] he said Moses running from Egypt 40
[1:24:12] years on the desert but five minutes in
[1:24:14] the presence of that bush the next
[1:24:16] morning here he goes down to Egypt his
[1:24:18] wife sitting a straddle of a mule with a
[1:24:21] youngin on each hip
[1:24:22] and him a man 80 years old with an old
[1:24:25] stick in his hand the whiskers are
[1:24:27] blowing where are you going Moses going
[1:24:30] down to Egypt to take over
[1:24:33] before he'd been scared to do anything
[1:24:36] more than keep the Sheep
[1:24:38] and now he goes down as a one-man
[1:24:40] Invasion to take over a world superpower
[1:24:45] Oh my he said the thing of it was he did
[1:24:48] it
[1:24:50] he said but a man that claims to be a
[1:24:52] Christian has no right and the pulpit or
[1:24:54] has no right in the office a leader
[1:24:56] anywhere until first he has climbing
[1:24:58] them steps into a place where he's born
[1:25:00] of the spirit of God filled with the
[1:25:01] Holy Ghost in such a way that nobody can
[1:25:03] explain it away from him again the other
[1:25:06] people around you might doubt it because
[1:25:08] it may not be an outward show but it's
[1:25:11] something that was real to you
[1:25:16] man 40 years more he got all got him all
[1:25:19] trained down all the education theology
[1:25:21] out of him he said I skipped one he said
[1:25:24] he bled him on the back side of the
[1:25:25] desert he knew more about God in five
[1:25:27] minutes in the presence of God than he
[1:25:29] learned in 40 years
[1:25:31] books
[1:25:33] the books are necessary
[1:25:35] but you'll learn more about God in five
[1:25:37] minutes
[1:25:38] of his presence
[1:25:41] more cooking takes place on the stake in
[1:25:44] five minutes
[1:25:46] being close to the fire
[1:25:48] than it did the whole time but both were
[1:25:49] necessary
[1:25:51] you understand
[1:25:52] but you've got to get in the presence
[1:25:56] of the pillar of Fire
[1:25:59] where you going Moses
[1:26:01] I'm going to my job to take over
[1:26:04] become Adam
[1:26:06] and Eden again
[1:26:08] where are you going Moses I'm going to
[1:26:11] my home
[1:26:13] to become to become like Eve and even
[1:26:16] again
[1:26:18] my family can be right
[1:26:21] where you going pastor
[1:26:24] I've been in the presence of God I'm
[1:26:26] going down to every Affliction every
[1:26:29] every bondage of the enemy everything
[1:26:31] that the enemy has after I've been in
[1:26:32] the presence of God I'm like the mouse
[1:26:34] that fell in the in the vat at the
[1:26:36] winery and he'd come up he said where's
[1:26:37] that cat
[1:26:39] why he's been in the presence of God
[1:26:41] what could God do for you if you spent
[1:26:44] five minutes being drunk in his spirit
[1:26:46] being inebriated in his presence
[1:26:48] spending the time in his presence I'll
[1:26:50] tell you what we shouldn't wait for the
[1:26:51] meeting we should before the meeting
[1:26:53] happens so we can help somebody else
[1:26:55] spend five minutes in his presence it'll
[1:26:58] change you
[1:26:59] make you different
[1:27:02] a far cry from the man who ran away from
[1:27:04] his responsibilities
[1:27:06] now he's going back to Egypt
[1:27:09] take over
[1:27:11] about your heads with me musicians go
[1:27:13] ahead and come
[1:27:21] what do you think God is wants you to do
[1:27:25] maybe there's something that
[1:27:26] not do anything you think he wants me to
[1:27:29] do this I know I know this is my future
[1:27:32] I know for all of us there's a rapture
[1:27:35] we're going to take a rapture
[1:27:37] one of these days
[1:27:39] that may sound
[1:27:41] that may sound far out right now
[1:27:45] but we're going to take a Rapture how
[1:27:46] are we going to do that
[1:27:48] those five minutes in the presence of
[1:27:50] God
[1:27:51] field the rapture
[1:27:53] inside of you
[1:27:57] sealed you away to the day of your
[1:27:59] Redemption
[1:28:01] if you've never spent that five minutes
[1:28:03] in his presence we got five minutes
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:07] and his presence is here
[1:28:11] why not on on a Wednesday night
[1:28:15] why can't you just take five minutes
[1:28:18] spin it in the presence of God
[1:28:21] foreign
[1:28:23] could you just by faith reach out just
[1:28:25] outside of the Flesh and us I know that
[1:28:27] things may not be what they I think they
[1:28:29] should be but right now I'm gonna take
[1:28:31] five minutes
[1:28:33] I'm gonna take five minutes here in the
[1:28:35] church five minutes if you're watching
[1:28:37] tonight and you're not able to be here
[1:28:39] five minutes that's all he needs
[1:28:43] it's been five minutes in his presence
[1:28:46] talk to him

[1:28:50] through all your unbelief and your
[1:28:52] frustrations and all those things let
[1:28:54] him let that all Melt Away get close to
[1:28:56] the fire
[1:28:57] Lord I believe you help thou my unbelief
[1:29:01] let me spend five minutes not in the
[1:29:03] presence of a worship band not in the
[1:29:06] presence of a great preacher not in the
[1:29:08] presence even of a prophet but let me
[1:29:10] spend five minutes in your presence oh
[1:29:12] God
[1:29:13] let me spend five minutes where your
[1:29:15] word is being preached and where the
[1:29:17] people believe that we can feel the
[1:29:19] presence of God and know the presence of
[1:29:21] God and see the presence of God let me
[1:29:23] spend five minutes with a faith that
[1:29:25] believes that you're the almighty God
[1:29:27] who's able to come and take over my life
