way and speak directly to the people that you would speak to today we thank you for doing it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this [Music] morning we're going to uh go to Genesis chapter 22 and verse 14 we'll just read the one verse this morning I hope you're not tired of Abraham we're almost almost done but we just now got into the good part so Genesis chapter 2 and verse 14 we're going to speak this morning on Jehovah Gyra says and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen Jehovah Gyra means the Lord sees or the Lord provides I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be [Music] seated as we followed Abraham's life through his journey his entire life has been marked by God asking him to believe in impossible things and then act on that belief yeah so it wasn't just that Abraham said okay Lord I believe I agree with you this is true but Abraham had to act on what he actually believed and so there's a in the scriptures there's almost a tension presented between Paul and James in the New Testament on how Abraham was justified but they're both saying the same thing it's just two different sides of it Paul says in Romans 4:1 what shall we say then that Abraham our father if pertain to the flesh has found If Abraham were justified by works he hath where of the glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness so Paul's saying Abraham is not justified by his works or by his effort but by his faith but then James in James 2 20 says but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead faith without works is dead he said was not Abraham Our Father justified by works yeah when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar he said see us thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God they're both using the same scripture and and it's not a contradiction what they're doing is looking at two different sides of it the brandom said the two men were talking on faith he said Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham but James Justified Abraham by what man saw in Abraham so he said see Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him he believed it but then when he went to acting now come on Church there's a difference in saying you believe it and then acting on it and that's where we want to move to we want to move beyond the spot of just saying well I'm a Believer and to the point where Lord because I believe this is what I'm going to do so he said he went to acting as though it was already done amen he said that's what man saw in him so what man saw was Abraham going to the store and buying diapers for a baby that when he was oh my when he was a hundred years old know right that's what man saw that's works but what was the works a result of it wasn't because Abraham just decided to do that it wasn't because Abraham just made that up and and decided Well I'm going to I'm going to go do this no because God said so and Abraham believed God and that belief resulted in Works in his life so Abraham was expressing he said he said that's the same as this T our works Express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on what we believe we do not believe it he said you've got to believe it Abraham's Works was expressing his faith he had in God's promise so man saw what Abraham did but God sees the motive God sees his faith God sees his belief and so God counted Works to Abraham before he had ever done the works because he was a Believer right so it wasn't just that he The Works were there they had to be there but it wasn't that God withheld his favor from Abraham until the work came but God said I've called you Abraham listen to me Church you need to recognize that today you say well I haven't done everything yet just you're just right and I'm not I'm not walked this road very long but God is not justifying you by what you've done he's justifying you by what he sees you will do how you respond to what to the faith that's in you he is justified by faith so God counts it already done amen he counts listen to me Church you realize God sees you already raptured he sees you already in a new body he sees you already in a perfect place he already sees that but what's he doing in your life men don't see that but what we see is the results of that the results of God's favor the results of God saying I know this is the person that's going to do it because that's who I've chosen to do it so here's a man acting as if God is going to keep his word oh that's a wonderful thing what would it do for us if we would act as if God was a Healer act as if God was a savior act as if he as if he keeps his word that's what Abraham was doing it was Faith expressed in Works see said it had been revealed to him so he believed it so and was acting as though it had already took place yeah that's pretty good isn't it in Genesis 22 And1 so we now we moved past the point and and if you find Abraham he's he's act he's asked to believe uh a series of things that are keep getting more and more difficult yeah until finally he's asked to believe that he's going to have a baby at 100 years of age and he believes it and he receives a visitation from the angel and his body change but now we fast forward about 16 years 13 to 16 years later and we find out that God is going to do something to Abraham he's going to test him a little bit more right he's already passed the test but God's going to test him a little bit more it says it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham that word tempt is test it's not tempt in the sense of trying to tempt to do wrong but it's to test Abraham the word is to test to put to the test in order to ascertain the nature of something including imperfections faults or other qualities so he's going to put it to test the way you would put gold to the test you don't put it to the test to prove that it's not gold you put it to the test to prove that it is gold right you don't put it to the test to prove listen when they go to test a truck uh like a an F-150 or whatever it is that you drive if they went to test a new truck they don't put that thing through what they put it through to to show you that it can't do it but they put it through those trials and those tests to show what it can do what it can endure that's what God is doing with Abraham he's showing him what he can endure oh Church many times in our life we look at test that's punishment it's not punishment at all it's actually rewards for faith God is bringing us to a place where I know Abraham can handle this I know he can handle it or I wouldn't put him through it in the first place so it's a it's a test of his of the qualities that's in him yes and God said I know Abraham remember a couple weeks ago he said I know him I know he'll command his family I know him I I predestined him I've elected him and so I know how he'll respond in the moment when he's put to the extreme test I know what he'll do oh I say God can have that kind of confidence in us this morning he can look at you and say I know he can endure the test whatever you're going through right now God said you can make it through it you're going to be able to make it because what because he had faith enough in you to put you through the test so he's testing Abraham and he's he's trying him and this would be his greatest test but would also be his greatest Victory brother Bram said Abraham had a V Day a victory day yeah when was it the day that he left the land of the shinar Plains he said not exactly remember that was a great test to God have God speak to him and say leave and he left yes right it was a great test he crossed over the Euphrates and come on this other side that was a good day but his main vday was up on Mount Gyra when he got up there that day when God give him the final test the final test when he had his only son he said now Abraham take him up there to that mountain and offer him up for a sacrifice see the final test is a test of willingness whether he or not he will actually take his understanding of how the promise works and and surrender that to the work there you go right his understand and that that works for all of us listen we've got to take our understanding of the way things are going to go our understanding of our future our understanding of our life come on young people you got a certain thing you you expect out of life and I'm going to marry this one I'm marry that one or I'm going to get this job I'm going to do things this way and the final test though of your faith is God saying I'm going to make you surrender that all to me yeah and I'm going to put you in a place where you don't have a clue how it's ever going to come out right and see if you'll obey my word and believe my word during that time and during that moment when it seems like there's no way it could work out are you still going to say yes Lord I'm going to follow the word I'm going to do what God Said even oh church that's the way we have to be this morning no matter what the circumstances say even if the word itself seems to be against me I'm going to say nevertheless Lord I believe your word come on good he's going to test all of Abraham's children the way he tests Abraham now he'll never ask you to offer up one of your children thank the Lord CU we'd be trying to choose which one to offer up wouldn't we that's terrible the one you thought of right there that's terrible you know but that's not what God's doing but the BR said that was a type in his shadow yeah what does he want he wants a sacrifice of us yeah right right we got to die to ourselves now look he said Abraham take him up on the Mountain offer him up for a sacrifice I've made you a father of Nations here is the only thing that you've got to make you father of Nations is through this son yes sir so in Abraham's understanding the only way the promise could ever be fulfilled was through Isaac he said I want you to kill him oh you see it destroy everything destroy the very purpose see a lot of times the dreams and the plans that you have for Life you've got plans and you've got dreams and sometimes God makes you go through some things that causes you even to not even be able to understand how that's ever going to work out and it's not that he wants to destroy your dream but he wants you to realize that it's not you that did it but it's him that did it and if oh church if God gave you the dream God's able to get you to the place where it can be fulfilled right and you got to leave what the in between up to God so now he said destroy the very purpose here you are Abraham you're about 115 years old now you waited for 25 years for the baby yeah and now the boy is 15 or 16 years old I want you to take him up and kill him so that I can make you a father of Nations he said Abraham never moved oh I want that kind of Faith don't you he never quivered at the word of God said yes Lord here I go yes Lord here I go picked up the wood and took Isaac right up to the top of the hill just exactly in obedience why he put the Commandment of God first listen to what God tells him in Genesis 22:2 he said take now thy son thine only son look how God presents this to him I want you to take everything you've got all your hopes all your dreams whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and and the lack of conversation yes after this is amazing to me like wait a minute shouldn't shouldn't god let's have it talk come right I mean I got questions right you asked me to sacrifice Isaac Lord give me a revelation help me to understand Revelation doesn't always doesn't always come the way we think it should right he doesn't always tell us ahead of time or warn us ahead of time what we're about to go through but what he does he says follow me follow me obey my word don't quit going to church don't quit doing what's right yeah don't quit living for God you're going to go through some things it's not going to work out the dream listen to me church so many people give up because they have big dreams and then they go get to follow those dreams and they hit a test and they say well the Lord must not have wanted me to do it nonsense If Abraham had done that he would have never achieved anything he' have never been the father of Faith but he's the father of Faith because he hit up against obstacle after after obstacle and he said I know the word is still true I know what God told me is still accurate listen can can we do that church we've hit obstacle after obstacle with our families obstacle after obstacle here at the church what are we going to do with it are we going to are we going to just turn back and say well it's too hard it's hard to be a message believer in this hour it's hard to live for God it's hard to be a cre or are we going to say I'm Abraham's seed I was called to do it I was called to be a believer right I got a text yesterday from somebody was going through some things and and he told me he said I've gone through this and I've gone through that and I've been through that but in the middle of that text he wrote me and he said I know I'm a son of Abraham I'm a Child of God I'm a seed of God I said that's the right attitude to have that's the right attitude to have you don't have to deny what you're going through but I know I'm a Seed of Abraham I know God's going to keep me I don't have to have a conversation about why yeah I just know he's going to do it amen amen amen and he said I you know we would have said maybe I've got questions yeah but not Abraham why his Faith was expressed in his Works Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and caved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place of which God had told him see faith is not always doing great things simple obedience is Faith yes sir simple obedience is Faith right I'm going to do what God Said period yes obedience let's look at that for just a moment before we go a little bit further into Jehovah gy Deuteronomy 4:30 says when thou art in Tribulation and all these things that come upon thee even in the latter days now God's giv Israel a promise he's saying look you you're going to go after other gods you're going to stray you're going to do all of these things he said but when you're in Tribulation when all these things even in the latter days oh my he's still this is still a promise that's good for Israel because there's going to be 100 44,000 Jews that'll do this they'll turn back to God but he said even in the latter days if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shallal be obedient unto his voice he said all I want you to do is obey me he said for the Lord thy God is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he weing to him listen you don't need to obey a preacher you don't need to obey a uh you don't need to obey a boss necessarily you don't need to obey any of these things you need to obey God first don't you don't have to be extra about it y'all know what I mean by that you don't have to walk around say Lord I'm going to obey you here it is just obey just do what God says well praise God let's have a let's have you know today we have celebrations about everything and that's good that's that's awesome we have little celebrations with our families and stuff but but you don't have to have an obedience celebration call a party live stream it this is my obedience you know like we do we take the picture of the Bible and and and the co coffee cup for some for some reason that goes together and you said and said I'm obeying God I'm reading my Bible and praying listen we don't have to do that it might encourage somebody else if we did but we don't have to do that God knows when we obey we don't need to be extra right you don't have to be super spiritual I'm not against spirituality at all if God speaks to you that's wonderful I believe God does speak to people I believe these signs shall follow them that believe right we believe that but you but listen to obey God we obey what he's already told us right it's not necessarily what he's going to tell us in the future but the things we already know that's the things that we've got to obey sir he said for the Lord thy God is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he swear unto them Isaiah 1:18 says come now let us reason together sayith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow isn't this a beautiful word picture he said though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool yes oh my it's I used to sing that a lot as a young person and I was trying to make sure I was where I needed to be with God I sing that old uh old altar hymn old altar call song whiter than snow or Jesus I long to be perfectly whole wash me and make me whiter than snow oh Church it still rings in my heart today I want to have this in my heart though my sins were red as Crimson they are like wool though they be as Scarlet they'll be white as snow he said if you be willing and obedient yeah that's pretty good isn't it he didn't say you know if you'll do this jump through this hoop you know follow this ministry go out no if you just be willing and obedient yes you shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you should be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it remember Saul and I'm just going through these things quickly Saul was very religious when he went down and and killed the amalekites then he had all the animals spared and made a sacrifice and Samuel went down there and said hey what what is this bleeding of sheep out he he said well I fully obeyed the Lord he said well then what's the what's the beeding ship he said oh that's for a religious purpose that's for a sacrifice right and Samuel said at the lord it's great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord told to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams we find that Jesus was obedient as as in the type of Jehovah Gyra we find Isaac was obedient not just Abraham but Isaac was obedient yes to Abraham's word Jesus was obedient in Romans 5:18 therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life for as by one man someone say one man one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous what was it simple obedience the son obeying the father's will you say well he had to no he didn't but there was nothing in him to disobey but but he did have his own way he could have disobeyed but there was something he was the son of God and you're Sons and Daughters of God join hers with Christ he said just the same as Abraham passed the test Jesus passed the test oh I I just love that like he he was willing to be led up the hill and laid on the cross but he knew where he was going right oh my sir oh my see Isaac didn't know what the end would be but he was just obedient you don't know what the end would be but Jesus knew yeah he was going to the Cross he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done Philippians 2:5 said let this mine be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation yeah and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became what's that word obedient unto death even the death of the Cross where God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus Jesus every knee should bow oh I believe it ought to be true today of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father what is that it's an obedience that he had listen to me church do you realize that when you come to God the only way to receive his spirit in you is to be obedient amen and that's the sign when you come in obedience to the full word that is the sign that the the spirit of Christ is in you because the obedient one is on the inside look at Paul's words he's saying Adam the old man was disobedient Adam the flesh is Naturally by Nature disobedient are you with me now but but Jesus was obedient right glory to God oh I want to be like that how can you be like him by receiving his Spirit the literal Life of Christ on the inside of you by the token the Holy Ghost full obedience he said to the word brings God the word eternal in you and that is the token you'll find that in several places brother BR says full obedience to the full word of God oh I love that today sir listen he said you've got to die to yourself in your thoughts and fully obey the word full obedience to the full word listen Church it is not our job to provide the lamb it's not our job to do that it's our job to obey we can't be our own lamb we can't to be obedient for us to death is not to be Obed to the death on the cross because if we died on the cross it wouldn't atone for sin because we're not the perfect one but he already did that so obedience for us is to acknowledge what he did and say Lord I'm going to follow you I'm going to follow you in baptism I'm going to follow you in in in Christian Living I'm going to follow you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to follow you in sanctification yeah I'm going to follow you in obedience yes see and and Adam don't want to obey and you'll always fight that yeah but Jesus obeys the word he is the word he provides the lamb he told Abraham he said I want you to take all that you've achieved and give it back to me and Abraham was obedient remember Abraham had sent ishmail away so all of his hopes and all of his dreams were in Isaac but God said go so Abraham went and on the Third Day verse 4 Genesis 224 Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off he was brother random says I believe 75 to 100 miles from civilization it's a long ways from where Abraham was to where Abraham made the sacrifice it's the it's where he made the sacrifice is actually Mount Mariah in Jerusalem and where he was was many miles away in Genesis 225 Abraham said unto his young men abide you here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship I love this and come again to you right oh my look at the faith that this man had he said I and the lad will go and come again now sometimes you've got to rely not on a specific promise of God see everybody's wanting a specific word but sometimes you got to rely on the nature of God right that's good right Abraham is not relying on the specific promise although there's a promise the overarching promise the big promise is he'll have a he'll have a son right so Isaac got to live one way or the other right but he's not just relying on the promise he's relying on the nature of God right what what what is the nature of God God keeps his word God don't change his mind are you with me now the nature of God is that somehow this is going to work out for my good all things someone say all things work together for good to them that love God are called according to his purpose what is he doing he's saying he's saying you you've got to rely sometimes on the fact that God is good and he loves you and that's enough brother brand said when the uh during the Dark Ages when they were there and they their babies were being cut out of of Mother's woms and the mother left to die trying to get the the dad to recant their faith and many times they were tortured and put on the rack and and given poison or waterboarded and things like that put through many many different tortures that they were put through and if you go and read that think how did they stand through that well God told them he told Jesus told them and when he spoke to the church age he said he said I know yeah he just said I know he didn't say I'll fix it he didn't say I'll get you out of it he just said I know and brother B takes something the church H book and he said it's a good it's a n that he knows yeah it's Oh my he didn't have to didn't intervene because that was the age they lived in they were suffering but it's enough that he knows and if he knows come on church if I'm in his will if I'm walking in the way God called me to walk I'm in the house of God but I don't feel good I'm in the house of God but my finances aren't right I'm in the house of God but things aren't going exactly like they said they would but I'm in his will I'm doing what he told me to do and so I'm believing today that me and the lb's going to go and me and the lad will come again somehow it's going to work out somehow things are going to get better come on church every one of us ought to be like that I may not understand why but I will not fall into depression I will not let over anxiety overwhelm my life because I know it's going to work out I know it's going to be okay not because of anything not because somebody spoke in tongues over me come on church not because of that but because the word of God is still true and he's the same yesterday today and forever and the nature of God is to provide for my needs amen amen good good come on now Abraham said I and the lad will go and come again in another translation it says Abraham said to his servants you stay here with the donkey and I and the boy will go up there yes sir we will worship and then we will return to you yes sir oh my it puts it pretty plain doesn't it sir Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises look look at the tension that Paul creates here with these words he that had received the promises offered up the results of the promises there's so much here right because sometimes to stay with the word it seems like the Revival dies yeah come on now H so Abraham says well if I stay with the word the Revival is going to die come on but I got to trust God for the Revival and stay with the word right you don't you don't you don't change the word for a temporary Revival I think I've told you before but listen if you're going Downstream if you're if you're struggling against a current you know you're while you're oring while you're rowing going against the current it's hard you get fatigued you feel stressed cuz you're going against the current but when you let go you have a temporary Revival you feel better but where are you going many people when they leave church they think well you know it's easier you know many times when you I I don't mean to harp ites but many times you stay home from church say well it's just easier if we don't go on Wednesday nights it's easier if we don't do that and I know people are G for different reasons I'm not preaching at you this morning I'm just saying in general you know it's easier if we just let it go that's right sure it is but look where you're going right that's right it's easier if we don't do everything we know to do but look where look where you're headed yes it's easier just let our kids go and be like kids in the world it's easier to say nothing to them if they don't dress appropriately or act appropriately it's easier just to let it go but look where you're going come on now yeah oh church we need to stay with the word even if it seems to kill all of our hopes and dreams we say Lord your word is true we'll trust you for the outcome yes look what he says he had received the promises offered up his only begotten son auma would said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called a county that God was able there's a great Revelation there what did the Hebrew children say we don't know if God's going to deliver us but we know he's able so we won't bow to your image come on church we won't be L to see we won't fall into lukewarmness why not because we we say well God's going to God's going to fill up my bank account God's going to do that no we're not doing it because of that we're doing it because we believe that the God who made the promise is able somehow how to keep the promise we don't know how he's going to do it we don't know when the Rapture is going to happen we don't know how it's going but we know this our bodies are going to change one day it's going to take place right we account that God's able to raise us up listen to me church that's what we've got to do in our hour we've been asked to believe almost an impossible thing that a body could change back into a young body again into a perfect body it seems like an impossible thing but God said I want you to believe it and we've got to be able to account that God is able to raise us up even from the dead good Hallelujah why could he count that he said from when also he received him in a figure so in other words look look at Abraham's faith and where it's drawing from he says I was dead church for every intent and purpose I could not produce there you go a word child and every one of us could say Amen to that we were all dead in in shaping in iniquities come to the world speaking Li for all inten we could not produce the right thing all of us were there are you with me now he said I was dead but one I didn't stay Dead one day the angel of the Lord spoke to me and and I became alive and I my body change happened I I changed something's different about me I was able to have this boy and because of that I realized if I was dead and he raised me from the dead he can raise my dreams from the dead he can ra he can raise my family for are you with me now he can save my friends he can save my family he can save my children why he saved [Applause] me he didn't save you because you were good he didn't save you because it wasn't difficult amen so well they've gone too far so at all of us every one of us had gone too far everybody wants to use that say well we've gone too far Adam's race had gone too far but there was one found worthy in Revelation chap 5 to open the book and the loops of seals right no one was worthy to bridge the gap to come across that Chasm brother brandom talks about the bridge no one was worthy to do that we were on one side God was on another but the lamb opened the book bloody lamb who died for us Jehovah Gyra God will provide Hallelujah so his expectation of a resurrection was based on his own Resurrection our expectation for our loved ones is based on what God has done for us right we they have to be save themselves we can't save them but our expectation for them is based on what God did for us and so we need to think about what God did for us and then have that same faith for our children for our grandchildren for those that we love listen he said did Abraham fear no sir right Abraham said this I am fully persuaded that he is able to raise him up from the dead for I received him as one from the dead and if that commandment of God told me to do this and I stayed true to it and it paid off to have given me the son God is able to raise him from the dead from which I received him as a figure verse 6 Genesis 226 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and here they go to church and Isaac's okay for a little while and then brother brand said you started to get suspicious CU Isaac knows what it takes to have church there's a lot of extra things we we we struggle with technology so much because none of us are very technologically able I found that Hardy is a technological desert and so we have a very difficult time don't we brother Robert all of us do very difficult that's that's the preacher included we've had to things up we've done remarkably well for the size of congregation we have to be able to do what we do and I know I know those that are streaming today are thankful for that those of you when you have to stay home but my own wife's at home sick today and and and it's I'm thankful that we're able to do it so it's a it's a but you don't have to have that to have church right none of that has to be there it's not a necessity right this microphone is nice but it's it's not a necessity yeah the pews are nice but they're not even a necessity we can sit on the floor well maybe for some of us could we could all sit some of us couldn't get up but it's a it's a you know it's not Necessities they didn't have none of that in the early church what's the necessity the necessity is the fire yeah and the wood something for the fire to burn and the lamb and you talked about that the word and the spirit have to be there right one not one without the other but both together because the logos he said my words are life so when you preach the true word you have this the spirit of God is there he anoints that word right so the word and the spirit have to be there and he says we're having a pretty good service yeah but where's the lamb oh Church would be a great question to ask wouldn't it we're having a pretty good service but where's the lamb sir I'll say this and just as a way of kind of just putting it in here uh at the risk of kind of shoving it in a square peg to a round hole but listen listen Jesus always needs to be present in our preaching Christ needs to be there the lamb needs to be we need to preach Christ when when listen when you when all the couns doesn't work and the things that you're going through and it seems like everything's wrong and every nothing's going right and it seemed like nobody has the answers preach Christ because Christ has the answer listen young people if you look to him he's got the answer for everything you have need of he is Jehovah Gyra he is our provider he is the provided lamb oh Church listen they he said where's the lamb listen something was missing and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together he said here's the wood and here is all everything the fire where is the Lamb for the burnt offering listen to that old daddy without a quiver in his voice he said my son oh church God will provide for himself the sacrifice his only son going to the slaughter but yet that faithful old heart had knew that God can't lie that's the Seed of Abraham today how can it be brother Brandon God will provide for himself how is it going to I don't know but he's Jehovah Gyra Genesis 22:9 they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order yeah maybe took a little bit longer with the pre-service than he normally did you know said God you need to show up or else all of my dreams are going to die today I'm sure he was desperate what was it full obedience full obedience he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood I'll be honest with you if I went to have church and we just built an altar of stones here in the middle and I told Peter Peter and Peter saw the fire he saw the wood and I start to bind him I'd have a difficult time doing it I don't know what happened to you but dad you're crazy isn't it amazing that Isaac being a type of Christ laid himself down when his 115 year old father that old that that boy didn't this it be good for some of you young people that boy didn't stand there oh that old man don't know nothing he's crazy the teenager laid himself on the Altar and said God I I don't understand it I don't understand why dad's making this decision but I I trust you Lord oh Church yeah Abraham stretched forth his hand took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I sir he said lay not thine hand upon the lamb neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me right yeah and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and lo and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns he just had to look away from his present situation and look around see what God was about to do what was he looking for listen he said God he he said God won't make you so he said well there must be a sacrifice somewhere if Isaac's not going to be offered there must be a a ram caught in the bushes amen caught on a Thicket and behold behind him a ram caught the thicket by his horns and Abraham went took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stad of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it has said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen yes lamb was provided as it was many years later on that same Mountain Hallelujah Jehovah gy is the first of seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah I have your attention for just a minute kind of I don't know if you can see that I can barely see it but Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa Jehovah shama Jehovah Shalom Jehovah nii Jehovah raw and Jehovah sidu all of those are are compound names Redemptive names of Jehovah found in the scripture Exodus 1526 I'll move through these quickly but you may want to write them down this is uh Jehovah Rafa he says I put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptian for I am the Lord that Health Thee the Lord that Health thee Oh My Jehovah Rafa Jehovah sh it was round about 18,000 measures he's seeing Ezekiel seeing the new city he said the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there Jehovah present Hallelujah Jehovah shalom in judges 624 Gideon built an altar to the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom or Jehovah our peace Jehovah peace to this day it is getting o for the bites in Exodus 17:15 Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah nii Jehovah ni oh my Jehovah Jehovah had all of these compound names and this one is Jehovah n now go back to that go back to the to the slide if you will brother Robert I'm sorry I lost my place for just a minute go back to the side with the all the names on it I'm getting old Jehovah ni is the Lord our Banner what that means God will fight for us he's our Victory Jehovah nii oh I'm so glad he's our Victory today he is our Victory Jehovah ra the Lord is mine Shepherd yes I shall not want yeah in other words he he's my shepherd He cares for me yes Jehovah to canu the Lord our righteousness oh my in Jeremiah that's in Jeremiah 23 six now brother bandam says this he said now God his attitude towards the people from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in these seven Redemptive names so the name is God's attitude towards you it's God's it's who he is right it's telling us that's what a name does it says who he is and this is who he is and if you remember how many remember FF Bosworth we may talk a little bit more about him tonight to the with the young people but FF Bosworth was a a man who believed in Divine Healing he wrote Christ the Healer and when he was about 70 years old he and brother bram's pths crossed and you remember that brother brandham was challenged to a debate in Houston Texas by Baptist preacher about Divine Healing yeah and FF Bosworth answered the challenge brother Randon wouldn't do it but he was there and so FF Bosworth is making a case during that debate he makes this case he says if he is our sacrifice our Gyra he is our Rafa he is our healer yes sir if he is our healer yes sir he is sh he is with us amen if he is our peace if or if he's with us he is our peace right if he is our peace he is our Banner our Victory if he's our Victory he's our Shepherd if he's our Shepherd he's our righteousness so he challenged the Baptist P which of those seven Redemptive names was not in Christ he said well all of them were in Christ well if they were in Christ that's what he is to us that's what oh church that's what he is all seven Redemptive names were wrapped up in Christ and that's Church Christ is God's attitude towards his people good so now what happened at that debate remember that's the debate where the pillar of fire appears over brother bram's head when he comes up to pray remember what happened in all the other they took all the pictures of the Man how he wanted to put his finger in his face and things like that they all failed none of the pictures turned out but one and that's the famous picture of the pillar of fire was authenticated to be light that struck the lens right the only uh authenticated Supernatural photo that's ever been taken that we know of that was authenticated in that manner so it was a supernatural light what was it God in the pillar of fire and all of those attributes of the seven Redemptive names are in that Pillar of Fire right what did Paul what did you tell Paul he said I am the one he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest what was he a pillar of fire Hallelujah so if they were all in Christ and the and Christ was the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire is was with brother brandham you say well he was with brother brandham one day he has got to come back for the Brom no but the brandom taught us the pillar of fire is not just with him the pillar of fire is in you that's what the Holy Ghost is then if all that Christ was was wrapped up in those seven Redemptive names oh Church then all that Christ was he is your healing he is your peace he is your salvation he is your Victory he is all of these things so all all those compound names now look he said in all those compound names they were everyone met in Jesus Christ he was Jehovah Gyra he was Jehovah RFA the Healer he was Jehovah the banner Jehovah the buckler Jehovah the peace Jehovah the shepherd all those compound Redemptive names was applied to Lord Jesus couldn't apply one and take the other one away yes if they was not applied he was not Jesus the son of God they're Inseparable and you can't separate God's compound names and if one of them was applied to Jesus all of them someone say all all them was applied to Jesus so if he's God's provided sacrifice for sin he's God's provided atonement for healing sir oh can we believe that today sir you that are sick can we believe that if he's God's provided sacrifice for sin he's God's provided atonement for healing the same yesterday today and forever listen to me church he was righteousness to a woman caught in adultery look what he was when he was here he was he was her righteousness she wasn't righteous she was caught in the a but he was righteous he was a Shepherd to Peter when he said Satan desires to sift you like wheat but I prayed for you he was Victory to a man possessed by a legion of demons is he your Victory this morning he was aace to the disciples in the storm when he was laying there asleep and they out to wake him up and he gets up and says oh you have little faith and he rebukes the storm and says peace be still what was he Jehovah peace oh Church Jehovah peace he was present for the woman at the well he was there he was healing to the woman that touched the H of His Garment and because the reason he's all of that is he is our provided sacrifice the Bible says he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world he is the same today can we just glorify him for just a minute more Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what was Jehovah Gyra it was the final Revelation that Abraham would receive was that God was sufficient in his sacrifice God was providing a sacrifice listen that's what God wants to bring you to is a complete Reliance and Trust on the one who provides es and he provides all of these things was Abraham fully obeying God and God fully revealing himself to Abraham what did he say God has provided the lamb I won't question it that's more than enough for me amen now we know that all of the other things that God is are secondary to the substitute to Jehovah Gyra yeah right because if he's not Jehovah Gyra he's none of the other things right but if he is Jehovah Gyra he's all of the other things amen and that's why I say let's preach Christ that's important and I believe Christ is the message of the hour the bleeding word that's why we preach the message of the hour around here we believe Christ is the message of the hour that's what we preach we preach Christ and this message didn't take me away from Christ this message brought me to a view of Christ where I understood who he was we were last night we were with the kids over in Branson we went to that uh Miracle of Christmas show and part of that that they do is trinitarian I don't know if the kids caught it but I'm sure they did cuz it was pretty obvious but they have Jesus standing there I don't know if you've seen the play they have Jesus standing there with his back to the audience and the father's speaking out of this with a big booming voice out of a big fire cloud and then the Holy Spirit you can't see him because he's a spirit and they're all there and and and God's telling Jesus he said now I want you to become a baby and go down the womb of Mary and then go and that's the way they understand it but the message right you realize what the message has done for us really Joel and I we didn't mean to be bad but we laughed about it we're sitting there chuckling because it's so so awkward man it's like really do I have to you know you go down and die for him I'm going to stay up here safe and it's not the way it was God came down yes so in their view God didn't didn't condescend the father condescended and or the son condescended but God stayed up there and the Holy Spirit didn't really have anything to do till later he just kind of floating around I heard trinitarian one time preaching on the Trinity he said the holy spirit is the Divine eavesdropper he said he just EES drops on the conversations going on in the throne room and then he go it's laughable isn't it but why why are we do we believe something different we're not under Superstition no more we're not hell under Roman theology we're not held under Babylonian ideas what do we believe we believe that God came down at Christmas time whenever that was we believe that God came down and came into a Manger God wrapped himself in flesh people want to complicate that or whatever but what it was was Jehovah Gyra coming down providing himself a lamb becoming the lamb you see how much greater of a story it is when God himself right becomes the lamb God has provided a lamb and he is more than enough for me yes everything else is secondary to that I believe he's all those other things but if he took my place he can provide my healing he can provide everything else that I have need of listen to me someone had to take our place someone had to die so we could live but once he has revealed himself to me as a savior or to you as a savior then all these other things are it's just natural and easy for him to do so can you imagine now listen if you just put yourself in Abraham's place for a minute he was about to kill his boy you talk about a a mixed emotion change the Bible don't say he shouted or danced or whatever but I think we'd all respond in a pretty relieved way if we were about to lose everything come on have you ever been there we were about to lose everything and suddenly in the ticket yes sir he catches a glimpse sir of something that will work Hallelujah it wasn't church he didn't catch a glimpse of an old disease broken down lamb it was just caught by the Thorns yes Church our lamb was not some some disease some kind of lamb that had sinned and something like that what was he was perfect he was sinless but he was caught by the Thorns the Thorns were on his ra he was caught there in the thicket by the Romans there you go he was placed by God yes oh church he he placed his own body there he surrendered himself to the will of the father placed his own body on the cross sir even felt the separation said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me what was he doing but can you imagine you can you imagine the relief that Abraham felt when he looked at said there's my lamb well that's the same way I feel every time I look at my own sins every time I look at my own needs that I have and I see him there I see him there on the calvary I see him caught amen no wonder brother brand kept a crucifix nearby he kept one his car had one hanging in the church what was it I see my lamb I see what God has provided and I know he is Jehovah Gyra I see my lamb you imagine how Abraham felt now can you imagine how Isaac felt when he was loosed from his bonds amen you said can you imagine mother B yes I can because one day when the lamb when God provided a sacrifice for me when I realized what he had done for me my Bonds were loosed oh church I couldn't have paid for my own sins Isaac's death wouldn't have meant nothing it was just Abraham being obedient but there was a provided lamb oh Church of me laying myself down to him was just obedience but one day I caught a glimpse of who he was and he is God's provided lamb hallelujah oh my if you're a Christian today you were released just like Isaac you were released just like Barabas somebody took your place Hallelujah I wonder when we see him on the cross I'm not trying to stir up your emotions but it ought to mean something to us Church it all means I know I've been criticized for that somebody told me and said well you you preach 2,000 year old theology I pray it's fresh every day I pray I can still put my hands on the head head of the Lamb feel it quiver feel it shake feel the life go from it into me yeah it takes that to be a Christian yeah how does it make you feel when you see him on the cross and you realize that's the lamb yes that died for my sins good brother BR tells us that all emphasis should be laid on him yes right you want to know what the emphasis ought to be it shouldn't be our church it shouldn't even be the gifts or or the preacher or anything else what should the emphasis be on him the lamb oh Church like the serpent on the pole he was lifted up like the brass Serpent and and he said look and live and all we have to do is look and believe for Heath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Hallelujah Jehovah the Lord my righteousness the world sees no Beauty in that a person who doesn't realize they need a lamb sees no Beauty in a lamb caught in the thicket but Abraham saw the beauty in it because it was a release Hallelujah Isaac saw the beauty in it because it was a release from his bonds the world sees no Beauty in him but look and live Isaiah 53 And1 who has believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground Heath no form nor cless so when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and coined with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded come on church does it mean something to you this morning he was wounded for our transgression brother the BR said every one of us ought to be able to put our names there he was wounded for Ben through his transgression he was BR forb fruits iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I am healed brother brand tells us a story about a woman who went into the fire for her daughter many of you remember it maybe the young ones haven't heard it there was a a a girl that was coming home from college on the train and she was riding home and and she got home as she got close to home she was riding with a friend and her friend looked out on the platform waiting she saw a woman who was disfigured in her face and she says oh my that woman is disfigured she said I can't imagine whose mother you know that would be I can't imagine I'd be so embarrassed if that was my mother and of course a little girl sit beside her she felt the peer pressure of that you know and she well I I don't know her so she gets up on the platform they both get up on the platform and the mother comes for her daughter and she says Hey here I am here I am she was going on like she would ignore her and the porter was letting the bags out the guy would pick up the bags he saw it he jumped up on a box he said wait a minute he said that should aren't you ashamed to be ashamed of this woman he said let me tell you a story he said one day when this little girl was young here she is about 20 years old when she was young said when she was just a baby said the house that they were living in caught on fire the kitchen caught on fire the baby was upstairs sleeping and she was outside putting uh wet laundry on the line and said when that house caught on fire when she turned around by the time she turned around that grease fire had grown and all she could think to do was take that wet laundry and put it over her face grap it over herself and run in to protect herself and grab the baby but coming out she didn't protect herself she took that blanket and wrapped it around the baby to protect the baby and carried her carried her out he said and that set baby now this 20-year-old girl how can you be ashamed of love like that listen to me Church the world may say there's nothing to it they may say the message is just a bunch of old folies may say we're a bunch of holy rollers but Christ took my place how can I be ashamed of love like that I would have been disfigured I would have been there I would have be the one that should have died I should have been crucified but he took my place how can I not love him with all of my heart how can I not give him everything that I have oh he said brother when I see God the god of Heaven forfeited his throne his Beauty and all that he was to be born on the top of a manure pile be wrapped in swaddling cloth to be made fun of by his signs and his wonders to be called a devil should I be ashamed of him no sir let the classic world do what they want to to me he's a super sign the Holy Ghost In Me screams out it might make me act funny and be a crazy man by this world but I cannot deny him who's done so much for me he took my place in death he took my place in Calvary he done all these things he condescended from heaven from the pearly white Thrones to become a man to taste my suffering to go through my temptation to know how to be the right kind of a mediator in me to lead me into God gu me to eternal life and through his poverty I made Rich through his death I'm given life eternal life don't deny him don't be ashamed of him musicians go ahead and come don't don't be ashamed of him but Embrace him say yes my dear Lord give to me like they did on the day of Pentecost give to me the Holy Ghost pour it into my heart I don't care what the teenagers say I don't care what the world says I'm not looking to them I'm looking to you I wonder if we can say that today look what Paul right he said God forbid that I should glow and Sav in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified to me and I un to the world a man named Isaac was I'm just going to read this to you I know it's an old old song and hard to sing Isaac was was inspired by Paul's words to write this When I Survey the Wondrous Cross on which the prince of Glory died my richest gain I count but loss and poor contempt on All My Pride forbid it Lord that I should boast saving the death of Christ my God all the vain things that charm me most I sacrificed him to his blood do you see the link the sacrifice we sacrifice all our dreams all our hopes everything to him I am crucified to the world and the world to me
