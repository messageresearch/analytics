presence come in lord and was like smoke so thick that the priest couldn't even minister lord the doors the post of the doors moved at the sound of the worship that went on inside maybe so in in this temple lord in these tabernacles god may you just speak lord to us from the holy place lord may be more than just words that that we hear or something that i would say god i pray that it would be your voice speaking from the inside lord something about it would just register with our hearts we would know you are real you are the same yesterday today and forever you don't change so we thank you lord that you're still able to do that today and i pray for these many requests lord that were made today i i pray god that you would move in every situation and every one that needs healing lord i pray that you'd move me out of the way this morning and and just speak lord and may there be just a reality of your presence among us we don't want to be here lord unless you meet us here we're not doing any good unless you're here with us and we thank you that you said we're two or three are gathered together that you would be here and so lord we claim that promise today and we believe it may your presence become visible among us lord may we be able to know that you're here there are angels lord at their position at every pew granted father's more with us than be with them no matter what takes place in the world around us may we remember that father i pray you'd bless this service all things that are said and done for your glory in jesus name amen amen let's turn to psalms chapter 85 psalms chapter 85 and i want to read all the way through that chapter down to verse 13 a little more reading than we normally do psalms chapter 85 verse 1 through 13. brother allen will be speaking for us wednesday night so keep that keep him in your prayers psalms chapter 85 and verse 1. i want to speak to you this morning on the subject of revival psalms 85 and 1 lord thou hast been favorable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin thou has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger couldn't we all say amen to that this morning are you glad to be saved this morning you've taken away the fierceness of thine anger turn us o god of our salvation cause thine anger toward us to cease will thou be angry with us forever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations verse 6 is what i want to draw my text from with thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee for seven show us thy mercy o lord grant us thy salvation i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land glory made well in our land that is the glory speaking of is the shekinah presence of god glory may dwell in our land that's what we want this morning mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven yeah the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increase righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning what is revival the word in the hebrew that was used for revive us again is to live to have life to remain alive to sustain life to live prosperously to be quickened to be alive and to be restored to life or health if you think about revival as being in a state of life then it should not be the unnatural condition of the believer but it should be the natural condition of the believer it's the condition that we're most comfortable with and yet i get the feeling that in some places and i don't say here but maybe even with myself sometimes we get comfortable in a place with no revival we get comfortable without any stirring in our hearts and in our lives and it shouldn't be like that but it's just the age of the jt that we live in that makes us that way we get comfortable with that with just a continuing on as though we as as we always have and we trust the grace of god and but there has to be a a quickening or a life that comes to the word of god because otherwise we can't even do the word that he said we can't even follow what we know much less what we don't know much less what what we what we don't understand but what we do understand we can't follow it unless there's a life inside us to do it and there's got to be something with isaac that that takes hold on the inside that makes you live and makes you want god that there's such a desire there that you're willing to give up everything else for god you're willing to give everybo everything else away just to have him and brother branham taught us that to have him is to have life right and so that should be revival it should be the condition of god's people someone has defined revival as the people of god living in the power of an ungrieved and unquenched spirit the people of god living in the power of an ungrieved and unquenched spirit you see our flesh because of the nature of it it's always flesh it's always going to be that it's always going to be weak and we tend to grieve the spirit and so that's why paul says grieve not the spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption so it's not that you can lose your salvation but we tend to grieve the spirit it's just something that as human beings we tend to do and we have to watch that we also tend to quench the spirit because sometimes the spirit of god wants us to do or to say or to move or to sing or to preach or certain things or to say certain things or to be active in a certain way and we hold back and paul tells us quench not the spirit because you know it shouldn't matter who's looking at us it shouldn't matter who sits in the pew beside us we should be able to worship god we should be able to seek god we should we should have complete comfort if we have a need of coming and seeking for god's help we shouldn't be scared of the altar right we shouldn't be scared of the house of god we shouldn't be uncomfortable with with getting down and really getting down to business with god when we are we quench the spirit of god brother branham defines revival he says when you see these crowds gathering he said that doesn't mean revival he said that's just a gathering but a revival is when people get really right with god and pray through and starts the revival throughout the city and everything he said you see they put away sin put away their iniquity well that's what i want to see they put away sin to put away their iniquity what's iniquity when you know something is wrong and you do it anyway it's iniquity he said they put it away and then turn to god turn around and start back again the road and i don't want you to take this this morning as though i'm preaching at you or trying to trying to make you feel bad that's not what i'm doing i want to stir up our faith to believe that it's possible that we individually could be in a state of revival that we could seek god and he would answer our prayers and that we could see him move in a supernatural way that we could see him working in our lives as i believe you've seen him in the past but right now we need god to move so now and to get desperate for that and that's so that's the purpose this morning now brother brown says the revival to my opinion doesn't consist of bringing in new members revival doesn't consist of a bunch of conversions although those things go along with the revival but a revival is to revive what you've already got just to get them revived again in in another sermon he said now notice now the church doesn't need a polishing it doesn't need a face lifting it needs a birth and i think what brother branham is saying there is is that there's something that we need beyond just appearances you know we get embarrassed we want to look better but that's not what we need we need revival it don't need a face lifting it needs a birth it needs a conversion something's got to happen not just to strengthen our borders not to bring in new members revival is not getting new members a revival is to revive what we got he said that's what we so badly need he said not long ago in chicago i was standing out by the great famous lake michigan and i noticed how those waves were leaping and jumping and i thought oh my the lake's got a revival today he said i stood there and someone was standing with me and they said pardon me brother branham i said the lake has a revival why he said what do you mean by revival i said look how it's leaping and jumping pounding its waves back and forth dashing against each other just frolicking he said well what do you mean a revival i said it's having a rejoicing time i said but remember there's not one more drop of water in it and it's jumping as it is when it's quiet he said now our jumping and shouting and praising god is wonderful if we can still have the same amount of water when we come down to earth again he said the church is not built upon rejoicing and upon bubble dancing but it's built upon the baptism of the holy spirit the love of god and he said well you say what good does the revival do then he said if you notice every time the sea has a revival or the lake it just turns back and forth is to knock all the trash out of it after you get the revival over the trash is laying on the bank it cleans itself in a revival he said and god knows the church or the living god needs a revival for a lot of its nonsense needs to be churned out of it you say well well brother ben who are you talking about i'm talking about me because you pick up nonsense i pick up nonsense as we travel through life that's why we we have communion and and peter told jesus told peter peter said wash all of me and jesus said he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet and the reason is because he walks through life his feet get dirty on a walk through life we need to wash ourselves in the water of the word we need to stand in the water of the word to be washed and so that that it's a revivalist when the lake churns the nonsense comes out he said what makes the revival what makes the lake churn he said it's because there's a wind comes he said that's right the wind comes down from heaven and gives it a revival that's what makes the church when a rushing mighty wind come down from heaven one day a pentecostal revival broke out he said that's what we need today is another rushing mighty wind on the pentecostal church to get the little isms and little differences out of it so the love of god can have the right of way throw all the trash out on the banks and clean her out and let's get started again but doesn't that sound like a good place to be in throw all the trash out on the banks let's get started again and and there's a question today because it's almost become message dogma that we can't have revival and and so the question is should we look for revival well if you define revival as being in a state of life if we don't have revival we don't have life so there has to be revival but there's certain things we don't look for and there's certain things we do now brother brown says now remember correctly he said each generation he said that's why each generation has its own revival its own revival and that's why you usually see revival break out among young people right because young people tend to their generation hasn't had that revival yet and so you look back through any revival in history it usually breaks out first among young people young people even children but but now look look at the age that we live in i i'm concerned that there's people that are elders that have not yet experienced revival i'm afraid that we've got people in message churches and you just bear with me that have never experienced revival because how could you experience revival and cross the word with impunity how could you ever do that you you can't just walk across the word and say i'm in revival doesn't matter how much you shout or dance or anything else you couldn't do it right and so no matter how well you could preach no matter how well you could sing no matter how well you could you could do anything else how many times you paid or whatever if you can cross the word of god with impunity you just walk across and say well it doesn't apply to my situation then you're not in revival so i think every one of us needs to look for revival every one of us needs to get in a place where we where we know what it's like to be in the presence of god where we know what it's like to be convicted by sin when the preaching goes forth that our heart is tender not hardened and not not been seared with a hot iron that our conscious can can convict us and the holy spirit can move in our lives and tears can flow down our cheeks every one of us needs to be in that place we don't have it we don't have life so brother branham says each generation has its own revival it gets a chance at the word it gets a chance at the word god is faithful i hope you hear me this morning god is faithful but jt to give us a chance at the word he gives us an opportunity to hear he gives us an opportunity to believe an opportunity but he won't dwell with us he won't deal with us forever i've seen people pass opportunity after opportunity you don't know when the last opportunity will come you don't know that this won't be the last service you'll ever be in if you're streaming this morning you don't know that it won't be the last time you'll ever watch a service on the internet and it could be because that you don't make it i preach to people at their last moments in life their last service young people i've been there i've done that i preached the last sermon i know what that's like but it wouldn't necessarily mean that you lost your life but it could be you never want to again you might walk away from the service today and never want to be in the house of god again he said well that wouldn't be me don't pass up your chance at the word every generation gets its own chance at the word he said then they hybrid it instead of taking on they go somewhere else they make a denomination out of it and a new generation has to rise up see there's a revival going on the bride's revival but you got to take your opportunity you've got to participate in it it's one thing to know the revival is going on it's another thing to participate in the revival and it's it's difficult because of the time that we live in but you've got to participate in it now brother branham talks about revivals he said that's the reason today in the third seal the revivals that we're supposed to have he said we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring he said don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere and he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet he said we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again yeah he'll send it he promised it now what did we talk about a few weeks ago those seven unknown thunders what happened he told us what they were we have a revelation of that we claim to that a mighty angel came down and opened a book revelation 10. there's an open book it means the seals have been taken off the book the book is open the seals are off right so if the seals have been taken off the book then we ought to be in the bride's revival and that's where people miss it is they don't see what's happened so brother brown says it'll take those thunders and then in recognizing your day and it's message what an appropriate title he said everywhere now there's no revival everybody is complaining ministers crying he said i was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper i know the editor i know the people they're godly people very fine brother and sister more of the herald of his coming he said one of the finest papers on the field but they will hardly print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet he said how many reasons you know you see it all the time fast pray it's all you hear we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen they're still doing that today in charismatic circles in pentecostal circles still looking for that revival he said they're crying there he said why do they do that he said why do they do that they want a great awakening they're crying believing that there will be awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they've not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a christian now listen they feel the pull of the hour well maybe that's why people that are supposed to be in the bride's revival don't ever get awakened maybe they're not a christian you got to start somewhere i'm again i'm not preaching at you i want to stir us up you understand that by being a christian these people at least feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done he said that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you and they still can't see it today still can't see that it's come but we know there will be no more great sweeping revivals but there is a revival for our day and we must participate in that now brother branham explains that well in the message thirst in 1965 and i'll i'll go into that but i'm talking today about individuals in the bride being in revival and then i think we could expand that to our local church our church can be in revival now as an individual that can be the state you live in as a church it comes and goes right because you have all kinds of people in a church and all the people are affected by the revival by the spirit of god but not all have the revival in them but what we're talking about is a revival and see the spirit of god is just as powerful as it ever was how many believe that today just as powerful as it ever was what's the difference it don't affect people like it used to that's what the difference is that's why people could continue to live in sin that's why people can continue to to preach or whatever else and continue to live in sin that's why they can continue to go on the way that they're going and never even think about god and we talked about last night and talking to some of the young men and we're talking about how that people even become atheists raised in the message and grow up and realize they don't even believe in god why they've never been in revival they've never they've never understood that they've never been in that place they never participated in the bride's revival and so the bible says you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a revival he said well that ain't the revival for you well if we could have a church revival if we could have a great preacher and if we could do something no that ain't the revival for you he said the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god is there something still there that's what i'm appealing to today is there something inside of you i know there's coronavirus going on i know there's sickness everywhere i know there's trouble everywhere i know it's hard to even get half a church full anymore i know what the world's like but is there something inside of you if there's a deep calling then there's a deep to respond and if there's something inside of you that cries out the lord i don't want to remain in this condition i don't want to stay in this dryness i don't want to remain without revival then there's got to be something to respond to that if god would put something in my heart and a cry in my heart to cry out for that then there's got to be somewhere in god's in his in his heavens there's got to be a storehouse somewhere that there could be a revival that could pour out on us there's got to be a place somewhere where there consists of revival that we can be a part of and it won't it won't consist of us traveling around looking for revival but it'll start right here and he says the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god he said there might not be another member of the church wanting that revival but if it breaks out in you it'll break out in other places he said but see you neglect that thirst oh listen here's what we were talking about last night and i was so impressed to sit and talk with a couple of the brothers about the word sit and talk about the word me and brother joel fellowship around the word often and that's what's in my heart it's what i longed to do i like to fellowship with you about other things but i want to fellowship with you about the word because there's something about it when you begin to see a desire for the word and you're talking about it there's something about it you just feel like oh oh we we we want to be right we want to make sure and so that you're talking about the word when you begin to talk about him he comes around and so brother brown says you neglect to milk the cow when the cow when the other is full of milk and if you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry he said that's exactly right he said if you neglect to take a drink of water say i just ain't going to drink no more you'll die you neglect to eat food you'll die now we have spiritual food in due season don't we we have we have the scripture we have the message of the hour we have food what a shame it would be for people to starve with all the food we have what an embarrassment it would be what a hard thing it is to see people starving on the pew when there's a storehouse when there's food all you have to do is reach out and grab a hold of it all you got to do is pray and ask god reveal it to me and it's there for you there's food available but you say i just i don't want to eat and remember i'm not preaching at you but when i say these things it's what people say but if the shoe fits we need to wear it if you neglect to eat food you'll die he said so if you neglect to give the holy spirit the word of god you'll die he said you christians you baptist methodist presbyterians pentecostals assemblies of god oneness tunis threeness whatever you are he said see don't care he said that don't matter nothing to me he said i don't think it does to god see you're an individual you're you're a unit you're an individual you'll never go to heaven as a church or a denomination you go to heaven as one single person between you and god he said that's all he said i don't care what church you belong to we put way too much emphasis on what church you go to but he said i don't care what church you belong to he said if you neglect to read the bible and to believe the bible and the holy spirit to feed upon that you will die now brother branham says how do you get closer to god read your bible and pray do you know that's the hardest thing you can do in your life just to have the time to do that and some of you retired people could say amen to that because you know you get retired you think well now i'll have time not working but you'll find other things to fill your time because that's just the nature of it it's just the way things are the satan will come in and try to distract you with everything that he can distract you with i tell you what i love my phone i like having it i like to be able to communicate but it hinders revival it absolutely does i love all the technology that we have but they had more revival back when we didn't have it are you with me now i'm not anti-technology but we got to think about what these things do to us sometimes it starts us with a storehouse full of food if you neglect to read the bible and to believe the bible and the holy spirit to feed upon that you will die jesus said in saint john 4 3 he said jesus said the man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it i want to talk to you this morning about the effects of revival what does the revival do well in psalms 85 11 in the scripture that we read it says truth shall spring out of the earth he said if you revive us this is what will happen truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven in every real revival there's a return to the word and with that is a return to holiness and by holiness i don't mean long sleeves and long dresses but i mean a lifestyle that's pleasing to god in every real revival there's a return to holiness when revival comes to your heart as brother branham says it gets rid of the nonsense it sweeps away the nonsense it makes you clean up when the wesleyan revival come to england at the beginning of the 18th century before john wesley was born england was in a moral quagmire a spiritual cesspool and they've gone back to that condition today but before that revival there was a man named thomas carlisle to describe the country's condition as stomach well alive soul extinct it's a vivid way of saying that they had a passion for everything but the word a passion for everything but the holy spirit a passion for everything but god deism was rampant deism basically which is it doesn't matter god's there but he doesn't care a bland philosophical morality was standard fare in the churches sir william blackstone visited visited the church of every major clergyman in london but he said he did not hear a single discourse not a single sermon which had more christianity in it than the writings of cicero he said in most sermons he heard it would have been impossible to tell just from listening whether the preacher was a follower of confucius muhammad or christ i wish he could see us today look at america today it's the same way morally the country was becoming increasingly decadent drunkenness was rampant look at the numbers go i challenge you go look at the numbers on drunkenness and on how much people are drinking since this epidemic started they're drowning their fears drunkenness was rampant gambling was so extensive that one historian describes england as one vast casino almost like going to oklahoma one vast casino newborns were exposed in the streets it sounds like today don't it 97 of the infant poor went to work houses and died as children 97 bear baiting and fighting were accepted sports tickets were sold to public executions like a theater the slave trade was rampant brought material gained to many while degrading their souls a man named bishop berkeley wrote that morality in religion in britain had collapsed to a degree that was never known in any christian country but now all of a sudden something happened a revival was coming amen revival came and when john wesley began to preach in the fields and the revival began to start it touched every class of society england was transformed by the revival i'm showing you the effects of it and we know that this country won't have a revival like that they turned down their last revival they turned down their chance at the word but listen we can have it we can have it right here we know the country won't have it but we can have it amen why we're alive we're supposed to be alive listen the revival cut across denominational lines touched every class of society england was transformed a man named davidson wrote that wesley practically changed the outlook and even the character of the english nation until right after he died they actually abolished the slave trade and he was instrumental in that it so altered the course of english history england was headed for a revolution just like france becoming a godless society like they were but the revolution changed the nation and even the politics today they recognize historians recognize that it was affected why because of the revival that took place and i've told you before that when the revival when the western revival would sweep through a town all the bars would close because the spirit of god was so rampant among the people that they didn't do what they used to do anymore people were changed that's revival revival brings joy there's a rare thing in our day at age psalms 85 and 6 which we read said will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee when david was backslidden in his backseating condition he said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation not thy salvation you can't lose salvation but the joy of thy salvation uphold me with thy free spirit now spurgeon said it this way he said joy in the lord is the ripest fruit of all grace all revivals and renewals lead up to it by our possession of it we may estimate our spiritual condition it is a sure gauge of inward prosperity he said a genuine revival without joy in the lord is as impossible as spring without flowers or day dawn without light revival brings joy brother branham ties revival to joy and i know some of you are thinking of this quote as i'm reading this but see if you're looking for a sweeping revival to bring joy it's not going to happen if you're looking for trump to get saved he may but if you're looking for him to be born again and all the all the senate in the house and everybody to stop abortions and and stop all the nonsense and stop everything else do you realize why abortion is such an issue today because the the country is so morally bankrupt that's why abortion is the issue it is look at the number of of sexually transmitted diseases and all the things going on in the country right now the reason is because the people are immoral that's why there's so many abortions if you cut out the immorality you wouldn't you just cut out the immorality in the churches you would have a lot less abortion but abortion becomes the issue because it's the only thing left that they stand for god help us that we wouldn't be that way but if you're looking for revival to come because a million people are going to get together and we're all going to have a revival it's going to cross the land across the drama it won't do it because they turned down their revival america did in 1956 they've turned it down and you know we look at the republican party someone said that someone said that the democrats republi the america is like a corpse and and democrats are fighting to do away with the corpse and republicans are fighting to keep it but it's still a corpse america is is dying on the vine i didn't say that a prophet said that big sweeping revivals it won't happen that won't bring you joy you're not going to find joy on fox news you might end up being like some of them other support supporters of the other candidate were four years ago if that's where you take your joy you might end up weeping but there's joy in the presence of the angels when a sinner repents there's joy in the hearts of the people of god but look brother brother said there can't be no organization left neither can there be any further advancement than what's going right now do people understand that do they get that but the brahmana says it very plainly but people are still looking for something he said there can't be any further advancement what does that mean no further this is our chance that the word it's the word that's already come there's not going to be some new revelation that's going to make us right with god this is it no more big sweeping revivals this nation never receive it the revival he said is over across the nation there ain't going to be no revival speak sweeping revivals this nation never receive it you might have an intellectual gathering but i mean a spiritual revival we've seen all of it he said i hope you're catching it i'm saying in such a way that i hope you get it see he said it's over a fine minister said a while ago brother branham if i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart i said son the revival is over and so brother branham ties it to that but it doesn't mean you can't have joy because we know that joy is the fruit of the spirit why couldn't he feel joy there's no sweeping revival how does revival start i believe it can start right here brother branham talks a lot you can go and read it about the welsh revival and i want to deal with that some this morning as we go along now brother branham says so in the welsh revival one of our late revivals before our pentecostal no one knew what started the revival just a bunch of people and i'll go into a little bit of that later but some of it was just young people in one in one place the revival broke out just because a young lady was 16 years old stood up and said i believe the lord jesus saved my soul or something like that that's all she said revival broke out why it was time for revival brother branham calls it a jubilee time it was their jubilee time in wales so it was time for revival and the revival broke out and so brother branham talks about he said no one knew what started the revival he said now when we get all our friend billy graham we get all the presbyterians and the lutherans and pentecostals and everything together and go into the city and there they'll have a great gathering together of thousands he said thirty thousand will come in two weeks and give their hearts to christ go back another two weeks you ain't got one he said see that's the mechanics he said but let god in his sovereign grace just speak to some little nitwit i wonder if we can say lord i'll be the nitwit that you speak through let me be the nitwit that you speak through my church needs revival my family needs revival my this this area needs revival lord let me be the knit with if there's going to be one let me be that one some little knit where he said that god can speak to a little nobody let his spirit fall into the city and men can't go to work women can't wash dishes the maid can't make the bed screaming and crying with their hands up in the air he said that's revival that's in the will of god he's oh that used to happen but not anymore what are we church of christ preaches cessation doctrine that's revival it's in the will of god i i said i wanted to stir you up i feel like i'm just i'm just hammering it today but you bear with me it was said that some noblemen from the church went over to wales to understand to figure out what all the mechanics was in the revival during the welsh revival they got off the ship with the tall hats and the round collars he said seen coming down the street a little policeman swinging his club around whistling they said my good man could you tell me where the welsh revival is brother branham calls this in different places a happy policeman where where's the welsh revival happy policeman when's the last time someone come up to you and and said hey you look like you have revival but they said where is it at because they thought he could direct them to it he said you he said he said my good man could you tell me where the welsh revival is he said yes my brother and you're standing in the middle of it he said you understand i am the welsh revival i said because the west revival's in me and notice this brother brown said that's sovereign that's what god does and he alone has a right to send a revival we can't work it up we can't make it happen but he'll send it when we need it he alone has a right to send a revival not get the mechanics together and so many times that's what we worry about if we can have all the logistics and we get worried about having the right preacher and having all the right things and getting everybody together he said but not the mechanics together it's pray pray for god to send the dynamic now during that welsh revival things changed brother branham tells a story about a minister who prayed stopped over a culvert driving across a culvert in the road he was so burdened for the sins of the city he said lord he said let every person that drives over this culvert feel your presence and repent of their sins he said he got someone from the city that was a prayer warrior struck him underneath that culvert and prayed he said every time somebody passed through that culvert men would would stop on that culvert and just unexplained didn't know why and they'd suddenly begin to repent and give their heart to god that's revival huh that's not something somebody worked up that's revival brother brown says pray for god to send the dynamic there there was something that happened in that revival it was so changed the area that all of the the pit ponies the ponies they used to pull the coal out of the mines were confused they were confused because they were used to being directed by curses and all the miners would just curse at their animals he said none of the animals knew how to do anything anymore because nobody cursed that's revival they only understood foul language and the miners didn't talk that way anymore men would go into above this is documented history man would go into a pub and order a beer and try to drink it and start weeping because the presence of god was so real in the bar that they would leave it on the bar and walk away that year the welsh rugby team had had their best year ever and usually that was a a time when those people are fanatical about their their sports usually that be a time when everybody drank and and the stadiums would be full but during that year the stadiums were empty and the churches were full in spite of having their best year that's revival you think about arkansas winning the national championship if there was revival enough i'm not saying it's wrong to to follow arkansas it's not what i'm saying but if there was such a revival in the land that the people filled the church instead of the stadium oh church you don't have to tell people you have to yell at people about doing those things if there's revival in their heart brother adam says if you and i could still or brother branham is actually jeep campbell morgan who was a great preacher back then he said if you and i could stand above whales looking at it you would see fire breaking out here and there in yonder and somewhere else without any collusion or pre-arrangement and i think that's why brother branham was so attracted to the welsh revival in particular because there have been many revivals over the over history but this this revival just broke out spontaneously he said over here there in yonder and somewhere else without any collusion or pre-arrangement it is a divine visitation he said in which god he said let me say this reverently which god is saying to us see what i can do without the things you are depending on see what i can do and answer to it praying people see what i can do through the simplest who are ready to fall in line and depend holy and absolutely upon me don't you believe god wants to do that today he said see what i can do through the simplest see what i can do through the coal miners see what i can do through the field hands who are ready to fall in line and depend holy and absolutely upon me are you still with me this morning brother branham talked about the early days of the healing revival and we'll come back to the welsh revival after a bit brother brown said now he said we have just witnessed one of the greatest revivals i believe that the world has ever seen he said in these last 10 to 15 years there's been a revival he said not just like the days of billy's sunday or the days of the welsh revival or the days of the wesleyan revival of the moody revival he said it's been a worldwide sweeping affair around the world great healing services great revival fires was burned on practically every hill there is in the world he said right tonight way over in the lands of africa down in china and japan this gospel is being preached and people are being healed right this very minute around and around the world he said it's been one of the greatest revivals he said because i believe it's one of the last revivals this world will see a world sweeping revival he said but now in the last few years it's quietened down he said you don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be when the great awakening come through new england the second great awakening they were building ships the great awakening come to new england and you know how people do they steal office supplies well these ship builders had stolen tools and they said the ship companies when the great awakening come through town had to build new barns to store the stuff people were returning why because revival makes you want to be right with god and with man and that's the kind of revival but brother branham talks about this healing revival as being so great even greater than that and he says but now you don't notice the enthusiasm of the people that used to be he said i remember of having the privilege by the holy spirit to spearhead that revival that started when that angel the lord appeared on the river and said that about many years ago he said to see it happen see it set ministers hearts of fire everywhere revivals broke out he said why you could just simply walk into a building and the people just get up out of their cots and stretchers and walk away healed you didn't even have to say one word just being there it's all it taken he said i remember one night in vandalia illinois i walked into the meeting i'm saying these things for a reason i want to stimulate our faith to see what god can do he said i walked into the meeting had no more been in the meeting over five minutes he said there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out and piled up blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking and he said just simply the spirit of the lord was present and he just healed the whole group of them he said now that's when you can do something is when revival is going but let that revival fire die down he said you can hardly the people are still christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something see you've got to be revived you've got to be associated you've got to be participate in your revival you've got to be a part of it he said it's just like in a forge in a blacksmith shop he said you've got to get the iron hot before you go pounding it on the anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out can i be honest with you i would to god that i could just preach and people would be convicted and they'd know and they'd walk away from sin but today it seems like you just have to you just have to almost force it because people just don't know what's right and wrong anymore and what is that it's no revival you've got to get the iron hot if you do when you pound on it it'll become something it'll bend oh my he said if you don't you'll never straighten it out he said that's what it takes to have a revival is everybody under the heat of the holy spirit that's been brought down the powers of god and revival moving he said then there's prayer meetings going day and night every minute everywhere why the people wouldn't even leave the grounds where are we at today church i know of a very large message church one of the largest in the world and i was told that they had prayer meetings on an off night and in that very large message church there's an average of four to six people that come to the prayer meeting and none of the preachers i'm not condemning them where are we at i feel like what brother brown said there's no revival anywhere but there can be revival right here there could be revival right here brother says i remember in jonesborough arkansas now this happened just a few miles from here he said in joseph arkansas i don't know if i'm pointing the right direction or not i think i was pointing towards west plains he said but when i first started about my third meeting he said first in st louis and then at corning and then down to jonesborough the paper stated 28 000 people in the meeting for 20 or 30 miles from the city was just tents set up you couldn't get a farm house to stay in the little city of jonesboro and people coming from miles packing lanterns walking through the jungles you got to understand back then he called it jungles because there were actually trees before they cut them all down made farms but he said you and it was a logging area perigold and in that area walnut ridge was a logging area and we lived over there and i was very interested in that history how now there's not a tree hardly to be seen unless somebody planted it around their house but he said people come from miles packing lanterns walking through the jungles catch a bus and come he said i set out in the wilderness one evening evening praying before the service started i seen young ladies coming with their shoes and stockings under their arm he said then before they get down there stop and brush off the dust from their feet put on their stockings and shoes and go into the meeting i wonder how much trouble we would get we would go to to go to have a revival we want revival but how bad when evan roberts who was one of the instigators of the welsh revival was 13 years old he began to pray for revival he began to pray he prayed for for seven years he prayed for revival and and then one day he was praying and he went to church and a deacon spoke to him because he was working in the coal mines he said he missed a lot of church because of his work he was working in the coal mines and a deacon spoke to him and said what if you weren't here when the spirit fell you say you want a revival and that was on his heart but what if you weren't here when the spirit fell that's something to think about isn't it what if you weren't here and i'm not trying to condemn you but again how how much would we put ourselves out if having revival meant that we couldn't and brother was talking about finances the other night if have if if having whole finances means you can't go out and eat for a while would you be willing to do it see that that makes you think doesn't it if having a revival meant you missed dinner now and then they say that people in the west revival got so under the inspiration of that that they actually felt the spirit of god so strongly that they would cry out and say lord leave me alone or i'm going to die it's such a a sense of the presence of god and this evan roberts from that day on he dedicated himself to church but it was years later when he was in his mid-20s when the revival finally came but now brother brown talks about it how he said i've seen them lay their sick children under old cotton trucks stay there day and night hold papers and canvas over them while it was raining storm of blowing not leave their place waiting just to get inside the building he said there is where the blind was seeing the death was hearing he said listen listen to this the ministry tonight is a hundred miles beyond that now go listen to those tapes i'm not putting down on anything brother brandon preaching back then but you can go listen to some of the tapes from the four late 40s and you look at the ministry later and brother brown said it's 100 miles beyond that because you look at the difference that he was still a prophet but you look at the word that began to come forth and even the manifestation of the son of man how it becomes so real he said the ministry tonight is a hundred miles beyond that but the revival fires has died down he said see the people walk up there and say just point your finger say well do you believe brother that's all he was out and gone that's all had to be done they believed amen the revival wasn't moving he said but we're living in a different time we are we are living in a different time but you still have to strive to have a life look brother brown talked about the difference in this time and this is after the quote we read about the young minister saying i don't have any joy but lebron says now the stabilizers has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us could coronavirus have been one of those waves the things that we've been going through one of those waves this church has been through great fearful ways but there's been stabilizers put on the ship he says we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore hey bad we're nearing the shore just stay stable he said just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word let it stay stable he said when you see all these great big old clouds around us storms coming and atomic bombs everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them do we believe that today he said yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling on the other side stabilizers don't mean the waves won't come and those waves will be waves of blessing and then waves of of hardship and trial it'll come and it'll go but you're stable during those times are you with me what does the word say he said stay with the word what does the word say now a revival if we could think about it this way is a return of of hearts to the atonement that's what malachi 4 came to do turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers so we could say it's i'm touching on uh our brothers that's my brother allen's forgot your name there for a minute brother ellen don't feel bad i forget my wife's name every now and then i'm touching on his sermon series on the atonement but that's what it is it's a return to the atonement and if there was as long as there is an atonement there could be revival don't let satan defeat you on any blessing or trick you out of any blessing that's included in the atonement because the atonement is still there today if it wasn't we talked about it last night if we didn't have mercy we i couldn't have survived yesterday not because i went out and did some great sin but because i live in flesh right and if we didn't have mercy we couldn't survive day by day as long as there was an atonement there could be revival but listen what the word says ii chronicles 7 14 if my people now listen where was he at solomon was in the temple and the holy of holies was there and he said if my people the atonement there was god providing a way for the people if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven we'll forgive their sin and we'll heal their land there's a sermon right there look if my people which are called by my name shall what humble themselves number one number two pray number three seek my face number four turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven because he knew they were human beings he knew they would go back and forth and be up and down he knew they would need revival so he said every time you need revival if you'll turn your face to this we take this as being national revival but that's not the land he's talking about he's talking about god's people israel was god's people america has never been all god's people are you with me now israel was god's people they were god's elect we are god select amen and if my people who is he talking to if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray then i'll heal their land i'm closing with this as i said evan roberts was instrumental in in in continuing the revival that had already started again praying for revival at the age of 13 and for years and years he prayed one day he was in church i don't know about you but this really spoke to my heart you forgive me i'm not trying to force anything i i just want to see god move i have a longing in my heart there's something in me i want to see people really change i want my family it's not just everybody else but but us my kids they they've got to be in the right atmosphere that's got to be hot the anvil's got to be hot there's got to be a way for it to be heated so that they can feel conviction so that they can be saved you've got children you've got loved ones that are out there there's people sitting here today you need something from god you know that you're not where you're supposed to be maybe you've been praying about it and seeking the lord but you just haven't gotten that answer yet but i want to encourage you if you'll humble yourselves and pray he said i will evan roberts began to pray and one day he was in church an old minister that'd been there for many years the old pastor he said he was praying and he said these words lord bend us bend us it's one thing to follow to get down on your knees and pray it's another thing when god puts you down on your knees when there's such a burden in your heart for revival that you can't do anything else but get down on your knees and this young man evan roberts had gotten into a cold period in his life he'd started out on fire and done all this praying for all these years and he'd gone cold he'd gone to bible school and just couldn't get nothing from bible school he'd gone cold and so he left bible school and he come to this church and he he was he was listening to the preacher you need to be listening for the voice of the spirit because this was a voice that that ignited a revival it was just a preacher praying lord bend us and it just struck him because he was praying for the holy ghost and he struck him and that day he went back to eat with the preacher and his family he went back to eat with them and the preacher offered him some buttered bread he said no i'm full and when he said that he said conviction struck his heart because he said maybe the reason i haven't received the holy spirit is not because it's not offered but because i'm just unwilling to take it and that voice of the ministry could hear it in his heart bend us in the next service he come back and they had a prayer meeting and he began to fall on his knees and begin to cry lord bend me put me on my knees lord bend me and that's all he could say he just prayed it over and over again lord bend me he has yet to not even preach to a crowd he was allowed after a prayer meeting to speak to 17 people and the lord put something on his heart and this is what he said he had four things the lord put on his heart and i think it still applies today he said first of all he said confess any known sin to god and put away any wrong done to others you want revival there's a way to have it you want to have life there's a way to have it secondly he said put away any doubtful habit put away any doubtful habit what steals your time what makes you hard listen if you hear something preached across the pulpit and that's why it's a dangerous thing and even as a minister i have to be careful because i want to stay with the word because i can actually harden your heart by preaching things that aren't the word and you harden yourself to that and then when i say something that is right you won't listen so i have to stay with the word not just preach legalism but when you do hear the word and your heart doesn't respond to it and you know you know you should be doing something different but you don't respond put away that doubtful habit he said obey this holy spirit promptly how many times you can go back and look at brother branham would call out someone he said you're going to miss it and he would counsel the people don't wait to respond if the holy spirit's moving in your life if the holy spirit is moving in the service don't wait to respond if you feel the tug to go to an altar if you feel a tug to be prayed for if you feel a tug to raise your hand or to worship whatever that it is do it feel the tug to talk to somebody about their soul and i appreciate that i've seen some of you do that i know you do that you feel that tug whether it's on facebook or whether it's somewhere else make sure if you feel a tug to talk to somebody about their soul and the right opportunity comes do it obey the holy spirit promptly don't let satan there come a time in one of the meetings when evan roberts he couldn't understand why the meeting just seemed to be so flat and he went home and the preacher's daughter said i felt the holy spirit was in me to sing and they'd asked me to sing and she said she refused five times she'd been asked to see she said i'm just not ready and she refused five times and he said that's what hindered that meeting and when she went back the next time she's saying and the holy spirit come again he said well those things aren't true it was true for brother branham obey the holy spirit promptly confess christ openly with your manner of life with the people that you're around you don't have to hide who you are i'm a believer i'm a christian you don't have to go tell them a bunch of things about pyramids and clouds and things like that just tell them you're a christian let people know you're a child of god i think of that little girl that was down there and been taken captive by by a name in the syrian and she was down there in a foreign land all by herself down there just just no no support system at all no church to go to and she's down there by herself and here she is in those campfires at night wondering why was i dragged down here but she had such a testimony in her heart that even as a young person here she's sitting in those campfires and then she gets in the man's home she becomes his servant and and he gets sick with leprosy and she said oh that you were in my country pretty bad i may be a slave i may have been mistreated i may be down here you may feel like you're mistreated at work but maybe if somebody got sick you could say oh that you went to my church because we believe in the healing power of god we believe in the presence of god we believe god said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that she said what god you were in my country and he was healed because of a little girl's testimony confess christ openly obey the holy spirit promptly put away any doubtful habit confess any known sin to god put away wrong done to others within two months after he got up to those 17 people and said those four things when the long sermon within two months sixty thousand souls have been saved in whales i don't look for sixty thousand souls there was a hundred thousand people total healed in that revival you remember a story in the bible where the king goes to the prophet and he said this is the arrow of god's deliverance he said and every time you smite the ground with it he said it's gonna there's gonna be deliverance and so he didn't tell him how many times to smite and he smoked once twice three times he stopped and the prophet got mad at him he said you should have kept smiting you should have kept smiling well before the welsh revival evan roberts wrote down on a note he wrote you talked about writing things down he wrote down on a note he said we're going to have a hundred thousand souls saved from this revival he was a practically illiterate coal miner tried to go to bible school and failed but he said we're gonna have a hundred thousand souls saved and guess what over the course of that revival there were a hundred thousand souls saved sixty thousand within two months revival broke out revival broke out listen to me musicians go ahead and come why did the revival broke out break out because evan roberts was willing to be bent within a year of the revival he had a nervous breakdown never preached in that manner again it was never used by god in that way again but for one year a hundred thousand souls were saved would you be willing to be broken would you be willing to bend brother branham talked about going into the forest he talked about how there was trees he said all the old dead trees made a mournful sound you remember the story they all made a mournful sound when the wind blew through he said it was just as the wind blew through the the trees he said but then he saw some young trees that come up there'd been a forest fire he said there were some young trees that come up he said and they just bent in the wind rejoiced in the wind what is it what is revival it's the wind of the holy spirit on the dead pentecost there come a rushing mighty wind and when the wind come what was it they bit god are we willing to bend are we willing to let the wind of the spirit the price revival that i believe we're we have today are we willing to participate in it enough that we could bend maybe our nature is not to be excitable but we can bend maybe we're not somebody who likes to talk to our neighbor about the lord but we can bend maybe we're somebody who who just never has gotten that excited in church but we can bend maybe we're somebody who's never prayed out loud but we can bend lord bend us that would be my cry today church lord bend me bring back the new again let me know what it's like to pray to be able to pray and know that it's cutting all the way through to heaven and pray through it won't be that way all the time in your life but there's got to be some times that it is there's got to be some times that we can touch heaven there's got to be sometimes when it's more than just a preacher preaching a sermon but when the holy spirit moves among us and we can feel his presence then we just linger because we know he's here there's got to be some times like that there's got to be some moments when we put aside our intellectualism and and all of our learning and and and know that god is here just because he's present among us it's got to happen i felt it happened i felt it happen in different ways but we've got to respond to it we've got to it's that or or it's it's life or death and i've told you the story before but i remember christian and pilgrim's progress as he was going towards salvation he was going towards that celestial city towards that gate of salvation in celestial city and as he was traveling towards salvation his wife and his children were crying out come back come back how many things are crying to us today it's not worth it come back but he had such a burden on his back of sin that he wanted to see it released and so he began to run and he put his he put his hands over his ears and he began to run in the story and he said life i must have life and they said come back but he said i must have life i wonder if we could stir ourselves that much so we can cry out lord i must have life the world's going to go crazy it is going crazy but i must have life whenever you do it lord whenever you stir whenever you begin to move i'll i'll raise my hands i'll begin to welcome you in i'll begin to ask you to come i begin to pray in that direction it won't be hard to get me to do it because there's something inside of me i must have a life would you bow your heads with me it wouldn't take all of us to do that and take one of us [Music] what that puts on me how does that make me feel this morning [Music] wouldn't take all of us pick one one person really get down to business with god could change the entire atmosphere of a service of a church of an area one person really really getting where they should be you say well so-and-so should get be where he needs to be what about you what about me when's the last time you just gave in to the spirit of god the last time you surrendered to god and said lord move through me i know it's not all about emotionalism but when's the last time that you felt the presence of god so real that you were moved to do something the holy spirit moved to the congregation he's still alive today there won't be a worldwide sweeping revival we don't obtain our joy on the outside we won't get it by looking at the news but there's something that can happen in our souls i say god let it begin in me [Music] let it begin in me [Music] i can't tell you what a burden i've had for prayer in the last week or so or let it begin in me i'm not much lord but you can start something in me i if i'm just using this kindling and i'm consumed that'd be getting me [Music] if it takes me scratching for every blessing i can get because of the age we're living and let it begin in me if i have to be broken if a year from now i i can't do it anymore but whatever it is lord let it begin in me i don't want to be a flash in the pan i don't want to just be somebody that that goes lightly at it i want to be something i want to have something in my life that my kids can know there was a day when revival struck in his heart and he began to move something began to happen could you just let that be you today you know i'm not prone to fanaticism you know i'm not prone to that but god help us today we need the holy spirit to move in our midst would you just talk to him while we pray heavenly father let it be one lord if there's only one let it be me may there be revival fires as they said in the land of wells lord that it would be break out across different places in different towns lord we we get the feeling that only revival can only happen in big churches or a different place in the lord it can happen here if we'll humble ourselves you said if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray lord we're praying today we're not afraid to let our voices be heard we've been through the waves we've we've felt the anchor of your word when the times were rough and when when it seemed like we couldn't stand we stood but now lord we want revival we want you to move in a mighty way among us lord i'm not here just to be a placeholder lord i'm here to see you work i want to be a conduit lord i want you to move god would you just make it so in every one of these people's lives lord there be such a revival in their hearts they couldn't wait to get back on wednesday night

you grant it lord god let it be such a revival break out in this area lord if you never used me again that's okay lord if you used me one time and set me on the shelf maybe some young man maybe one of these children lord he said such a revival in their heart maybe my son or my daughter or one of these other children you put such a revival in their heart that they couldn't couldn't even think or
