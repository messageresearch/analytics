[46:15] god bless you can be seated
[46:22] the men
[46:24] in jonah's ship were looking for answers
[46:27] i
[46:28] read a story just a few minutes ago
[46:30] about a man
[46:32] who one late one night he'd gotten drunk
[46:35] and
[46:36] he was uh
[46:37] out on the street he was on his hands
[46:39] and knees under a street light looking
[46:41] for his wallet
[46:43] and a policeman come up to him and he
[46:46] saw him there and he got down there with
[46:48] him and he looked he said what are you
[46:49] looking for he said well i'm looking for
[46:50] my wallet
[46:52] he said well where did you drop it he
[46:54] said all about two blocks down that way
[46:58] the policeman was perplexed and he said
[47:00] he said why are you looking here he said
[47:02] well there wasn't no street light down
[47:04] there
[47:07] he was looking for answers in the wrong
[47:09] places
[47:11] that's why so many people have gotten in
[47:13] trouble
[47:14] their lives got messed up and
[47:16] and they found themselves in a condition
[47:18] they were drunk on the things of the
[47:20] world and they went looking on the
[47:22] internet
[47:23] for answers when answers are found in
[47:25] god's word
[47:26] right amen
[47:28] but jonah didn't have the answers to
[47:30] that difficult question
[47:32] it was difficult the most difficult
[47:34] question he would ever be asked why have
[47:36] you done this and i think every one of
[47:38] us can identify with that
[47:40] at some point in our lives you don't
[47:42] have to
[47:43] you you don't have to have done
[47:44] something like jonah did to uh to
[47:47] identify with that that feeling why did
[47:49] why why am i here what am i doing here
[47:51] and and why did i do what i did and why
[47:55] did i react the way that i did why did i
[47:57] act like that and and you can come up
[47:59] with all kinds of excuses but really
[48:01] there was no excuses
[48:03] the hebrew prophets were were not often
[48:06] seen in the cargo holds of the ships of
[48:09] tarshish it wasn't where they belonged
[48:12] he belonged on the battlefield he
[48:14] belonged in the pulpit he he belonged as
[48:16] a prophet of god standing there and
[48:18] preaching the word of god doing what god
[48:20] told him to do
[48:21] and there's no excuse for what he did
[48:24] and yet god providentially worked in his
[48:26] life
[48:28] and actually made that work out for the
[48:30] better in his life and
[48:32] in his own perfect will and
[48:35] and yet it was the lowest moment of
[48:37] jonah's life
[48:39] the lowest moment of his life
[48:42] and so he didn't have any answers why he
[48:44] did
[48:45] what he did no excuse for it and and yet
[48:49] we know that god's providential work in
[48:51] one person's life to turn an awful
[48:54] decision into a testimony it's no excuse
[48:57] for the next person to try and do the
[49:00] same thing
[49:01] if you try to run from god you may not
[49:03] have the same outcome as jonah
[49:05] god has called us to do his perfect will
[49:08] and so we're to learn from these things
[49:10] not to not to make the same mistakes but
[49:12] to keep from making those mistakes in
[49:15] first corinthians chapter 10 paul lists
[49:17] a a list of things that we shouldn't do
[49:20] that the children of israel did he he
[49:22] said we shouldn't lust or unless there
[49:24] is not sensual lust but it is desire
[49:27] something that you don't need he says we
[49:29] shouldn't committed idolatry we
[49:31] shouldn't commit fornication we
[49:33] shouldn't tempt christ
[49:35] and they tempted christ by continually
[49:38] continually rebelling and and we
[49:41] shouldn't murmur he says and and so he
[49:43] said these things happen unto them for
[49:46] examples and they're written for our
[49:49] admonition that admonition we've went
[49:51] over that when it comes to parental
[49:52] discipline it's warning it's correction
[49:56] it's turning around these things are are
[49:58] done so that we can turn from what
[50:00] they're doing and what they did and do
[50:03] something different and so paul goes on
[50:05] to say wherefore let him that thinketh
[50:07] he stand to take heed lest he fall and
[50:10] brother aaron mcgeary years ago stood in
[50:13] this pulpit and he said something that
[50:14] stuck with me
[50:16] ever since and it's been probably 10 or
[50:18] 15 years ago and he stood in this pulpit
[50:21] and he said that he said you say well
[50:23] they just think they stand he said you
[50:25] can't fall unless you're standing up
[50:27] and that really stuck with me because
[50:29] there were people that were that were
[50:31] standing up he was a prophet of god a
[50:33] real prophet
[50:34] these that went out of the wilderness
[50:36] were god's people
[50:38] but they fell so he said if you think
[50:40] you're standing if you think you're sure
[50:42] about your standing don't take heed
[50:44] because you're going to end up falling
[50:46] but then he goes on to say there has no
[50:48] temptation taken you
[50:50] but such as is common to man and what
[50:52] this verse tells us is that there are no
[50:54] excuses
[50:58] well brother ben you don't know my
[51:00] particular situation but he said there's
[51:02] no temptation taking you but such as is
[51:05] common to man other men deal with it
[51:07] other women deal with it other
[51:09] christians deal with it but he said but
[51:12] god is faithful aren't you glad that
[51:14] he's faithful even when we're not
[51:16] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[51:18] you to be tempted above that you are
[51:20] able but will with the temptation also
[51:24] make a way to escape that you may be
[51:26] able to bear it
[51:28] amen so you're able to do it today
[51:31] you're an overcomer you're able to
[51:33] overcome
[51:34] and so that's the that's the attitude
[51:36] that we should take
[51:37] towards that
[51:38] and we know that there is a perfect will
[51:40] and a permissive will
[51:42] in god that there is things and a great
[51:45] example of that is is history itself
[51:48] and the early human beings that they
[51:51] stood there adam and eve in the garden
[51:53] and god's perfect will was for them to
[51:55] remain in the garden
[51:57] and yet if it had not been for their sin
[52:01] we would never have a redeemer
[52:04] his attributes that he had in him would
[52:05] never have been expressed
[52:08] and so that but it is his permissive
[52:10] will but we we have to be careful with
[52:12] that because the redeemer was his
[52:15] perfect will
[52:17] now watch amen
[52:19] it was his perfect
[52:20] attribute to be a redeemer
[52:23] and yet in his perfect will because he's
[52:25] a god who can't make you sin
[52:27] who will not abide sin
[52:29] right he couldn't do that and be god and
[52:32] yet his his attribute his perfect
[52:34] attribute
[52:35] clashed in that instance with his
[52:37] perfect will but then his permissive
[52:39] will worked
[52:41] to allow his perfect attribute to be
[52:43] expressed
[52:45] did you follow me on that
[52:47] so sometimes god wants to express his
[52:49] attribute in your life and so it the
[52:51] sickness that we have that's the
[52:53] permissive will of god all these things
[52:55] it's god allowed it so he can express
[52:57] his attribute in your life oh we ought
[53:00] to just surrender to that will of god
[53:02] today
[53:03] but we should want his perfect will
[53:06] and very early in brother branham's
[53:07] ministry he recognized the difference if
[53:09] you go all the way back to 1947
[53:12] brother branham says now look he said
[53:13] there is a perfect will of god and
[53:15] there's a permissive will of god and god
[53:17] permitted his prophet to go on he's
[53:20] speaking about balaam in this instance
[53:22] he said yet it wasn't his perfect will
[53:24] it was his permissive will
[53:26] he said and i feel this afternoon is the
[53:28] same thing he said working for this
[53:31] miracle line now if you'll remember the
[53:33] branham's miracle line was when he would
[53:35] have people come and he would pray with
[53:37] that individual until they were healed
[53:40] he wouldn't stop until they were healed
[53:43] sometimes for hours he would pray for
[53:44] one individual and that's how he ended
[53:47] up having a nervous breakdown and
[53:48] leaving the field because he just
[53:50] couldn't bear the strain of it but he he
[53:53] early on knew that wasn't god's perfect
[53:55] will he said it's god's maybe permissive
[53:58] will but it's not his perfect will
[54:00] because brother branham goes on to
[54:02] explain that sometimes he would try to
[54:04] take something off that god had put on
[54:06] the person
[54:07] the person that never repented never
[54:08] done anything to to change it and so he
[54:11] had been better off not to pray that way
[54:13] but just to pray that god's will would
[54:14] be done now now he said now this is just
[54:17] his permissive will this way now this is
[54:20] in 1952 after he started to use the
[54:23] visions more in
[54:25] in the prayer lines he said this is just
[54:27] his permissive will this way he said
[54:29] it's just when i come here and pray and
[54:30] cry and begged him before coming he said
[54:33] until that is laying so close it forces
[54:35] me into it he said you see the vision
[54:38] it'll cut off he said but when it comes
[54:40] upon god's perfect will it just moves
[54:42] down he said and sometimes i'm out for
[54:44] about two hours then he sends in
[54:46] different parts of the country in
[54:47] different places he said that's just
[54:49] every time perfect now brother brandon
[54:50] talk about that how he would get weak
[54:52] when the people would pull on he said
[54:54] that's your faith that's used operating
[54:56] the gift so he looked at that as god's
[54:58] permissive will but god's perfect will
[55:00] was what he would show him and when he
[55:02] would show him like that he didn't get
[55:03] weak
[55:04] because he could see visions all during
[55:06] the day he wouldn't get weak but when he
[55:08] was standing in the platform he could
[55:09] only pray for about 15 people
[55:12] so i'm going somewhere tonight so just
[55:13] hang with me so at the very end of
[55:15] brother banner's ministry you don't see
[55:17] him addressing it in the middle really
[55:19] but at the end
[55:20] he picks up the same theme
[55:22] and he preaches a message that does god
[55:25] ever change his mind about his word
[55:28] and so he goes into the perfect and
[55:29] permissive will once again he said but
[55:31] and if the people won't walk in his
[55:33] perfect will he does have a permissive
[55:36] will he'll let you walk in
[55:38] he said notice he permits it all right
[55:40] but he will make it work out for his
[55:42] glory
[55:43] in his perfect will
[55:46] now watch he said it's best to have
[55:48] god's will
[55:49] he said that's what he taught us thy
[55:51] will be done and we can say amen to that
[55:53] tonight that's the prayer that we're
[55:55] taught to pray thy will be done that's
[55:57] his perfect will
[55:59] right he said we he said thy will be
[56:01] done thy kingdom come we must submit
[56:03] ourselves to his will and his word don't
[56:06] question it
[56:07] believe it
[56:08] don't try to find a way around it just
[56:11] take it the way it is
[56:13] hey man if you want the answers go back
[56:16] to where the answers are if you want the
[56:18] answers go back to the source
[56:21] i feel like i'm just a little bit loud
[56:23] up top i'm not sure brother gabe
[56:26] my brother peter whoever's running that
[56:29] but you know we must submit ourselves to
[56:31] his will
[56:33] brother branham said it's best to have
[56:34] god's will how many want god's will in
[56:36] their life
[56:37] he said that's what he taught us thy
[56:39] will be done thy kingdom come he said
[56:40] don't question it believe it don't try
[56:42] to find a way around it take it the way
[56:43] it is he said so many wants to go around
[56:45] get some other way and when you do you
[56:47] find yourself going on you find god
[56:49] blessing you but you're working in his
[56:52] permissive will and not in his perfect
[56:55] divine will
[56:56] now watch he's blessing you in it
[57:00] he's blessing you in it
[57:02] but it's his permissive will
[57:04] he said he permits it as i said but he
[57:06] will not let it be his perfect will his
[57:09] permissive will is never his perfect
[57:11] will
[57:12] right he will not let it be his perfect
[57:14] will but he'll make it work to honor and
[57:17] bless his perfect will right oh my
[57:21] and see that's where god he knows what
[57:23] we would choose before right he knows
[57:25] who we'll be but when you find somebody
[57:28] who's always trying and attempting to
[57:30] live in the permissive will of god what
[57:33] you find out is that person there's
[57:35] something wrong on the inside and you'll
[57:37] find that there's a person maybe that
[57:39] just doesn't have what it takes to be
[57:41] the bride at the end time i'm just going
[57:42] to be blunt with you tonight because the
[57:44] bride wants the perfect will of god
[57:47] that's why we live the way that we do it
[57:49] would be all right to go to the baptist
[57:50] church or the methodist church or some
[57:52] other church in the permissive will of
[57:53] god but we're here tonight you're here
[57:55] tonight because you want the perfect
[57:57] will of god because you're not just some
[57:59] other church you're his wife
[58:03] you're his wife and there's a place for
[58:06] those in the permissive will of god
[58:07] there's a place for people who are who
[58:10] are in other parts of the economy of god
[58:12] but for us tonight we want his perfect
[58:15] will how many could say amen to that
[58:17] tonight we want everything that he has
[58:19] for us and why do we want that because
[58:21] we love him
[58:23] we're his bride we want his perfect will
[58:26] in our lives i believe there will be a
[58:28] bride like that
[58:30] now watch
[58:32] it was moses
[58:34] who stood there at the rock and brother
[58:35] brown uses the example
[58:38] moses how he smote the rock twice
[58:41] god told him speak to the rock
[58:43] but god said come here moses come here
[58:46] come up here on top
[58:47] you've been a faithful servant he said
[58:50] like the woman with the high heels
[58:52] you climbed
[58:54] talked about that woman the dream that
[58:55] his mother had of a woman in high heels
[58:57] and she climbed up three steps
[59:00] justification sanctification the baptism
[59:02] of the holy ghost and she gets on a
[59:04] pathway
[59:05] but she can't walk with high-heeled
[59:07] shoes on
[59:08] so she can't walk down that pathway
[59:11] he's not talking about legalism in that
[59:13] story that's not what it's about what
[59:16] he's talking about is a person who could
[59:18] come up through
[59:19] luther and wesley and pentecost and yet
[59:21] not be able to walk in the word
[59:23] because they wouldn't stay with god's
[59:25] perfect will
[59:26] he said like the woman with the high
[59:28] heels you climbed moses climb up here
[59:30] look over yonder see the promised land
[59:32] oh lord he said but you're not going
[59:34] over you took my permissive will down
[59:36] here at the rock you've glorified
[59:38] yourself seeing not me you sanctified
[59:41] yourself you didn't sanctify me you
[59:43] didn't keep my original word what i told
[59:46] you to do he said yet the waters did
[59:48] come see a lot of times we think that
[59:50] we're in god's perfect will because we
[59:52] won the argument
[59:59] oh i won i i got what i wanted
[1:00:03] i'm in god's perfect will that's not how
[1:00:05] we find out what the perfect will of god
[1:00:07] is because if you want something bad
[1:00:08] enough god will give it to you
[1:00:10] he'll let you have the desire of your
[1:00:12] heart
[1:00:13] you don't find out god's perfect will by
[1:00:15] how blessed you are
[1:00:17] or how big of a church you go to or
[1:00:19] don't go to
[1:00:20] you don't find out god's perfect will by
[1:00:22] having a big church or by having a good
[1:00:25] job or by making lots of money that's
[1:00:26] not how you find out he said brother ben
[1:00:28] how do we find out is it with the word
[1:00:31] god's perfect will is always the word he
[1:00:34] may allow you to do something
[1:00:36] that's outside of his perfect will
[1:00:38] that's his permissive will and he may
[1:00:40] even work to glorify his perfect will
[1:00:43] but his permissive will will never be
[1:00:44] his perfect will
[1:00:46] and i believe there will be a bride at
[1:00:48] the end time who want to do just what he
[1:00:50] wants us her to do don't you want to be
[1:00:52] part of that
[1:00:54] now he said you can lay hands on the
[1:00:56] sick and they recover you can prophesy
[1:00:57] speak with tongues but the thing is keep
[1:00:59] his original word
[1:01:01] he said god don't change his mind friend
[1:01:03] you've got to keep his commission his
[1:01:05] will you say oh well that was for the
[1:01:07] disciples he doesn't change if he's
[1:01:10] still got a disciple how many disciples
[1:01:12] does he have here tonight if he's still
[1:01:14] got a disciple that's the same
[1:01:16] commission go into all the world and
[1:01:18] preach the gospel these signs shall
[1:01:21] follow them that believe he said it
[1:01:23] never changed he can't change
[1:01:26] he said now you can say well i tell you
[1:01:27] it ain't for this day he said oh you
[1:01:29] balaamic
[1:01:30] you see god don't change he's the same
[1:01:32] yesterday today and forever but you see
[1:01:34] my my prejudices are or you know i don't
[1:01:37] like that because i'm a i'm a sane
[1:01:39] sensible person he didn't ask you to
[1:01:41] make sense of it he didn't ask you to
[1:01:43] reason it out he just asked you to
[1:01:45] believe it
[1:01:47] hey man he wants you to take his perfect
[1:01:50] will
[1:01:51] yet he grants you permission
[1:01:53] permission to permit your will
[1:01:55] permissive will
[1:01:56] knowing what's in your heart he knows it
[1:01:59] you say well brother branham i do so and
[1:02:00] so it don't bother me
[1:02:04] this is good food on a wednesday night
[1:02:08] not because i'm saying it but because
[1:02:10] it's the truth
[1:02:13] he said it don't bother me
[1:02:15] god blesses me every day i sing in the
[1:02:16] spirit i dance in the spirit he'll
[1:02:18] permit it
[1:02:19] i've had people tell me that well i'm
[1:02:21] living in this sin but i i i can raise
[1:02:24] my hands i feel the presence of god
[1:02:27] i've had people tell me that very thing
[1:02:30] he said i wear shorts and i do this it
[1:02:32] don't bother me i know my faith is in
[1:02:34] christ not in what i wear
[1:02:36] if i had a dollar for every time i've
[1:02:38] heard that in my life
[1:02:40] my faith is in christ not on what i wear
[1:02:42] but the bible said there's something to
[1:02:44] it
[1:02:45] what do you do you'll make a stumbling
[1:02:46] block like balaam did before every one
[1:02:48] of the other women
[1:02:49] what do you do to your young girls
[1:02:51] you'll have a bunch of raquettas that's
[1:02:52] exactly right much a little painted up
[1:02:54] jezebel's you might be able to say
[1:02:55] brother ben i can get by with it you
[1:02:57] might get by with it
[1:02:59] you could get by i could get by with
[1:03:01] being late to every service
[1:03:03] i'm not preaching about being in church
[1:03:04] late but i could get by with i could get
[1:03:07] by with uh with giving half-hearted
[1:03:10] sermons
[1:03:12] i could get by these song leaders could
[1:03:13] get by with half-heartedly leading the
[1:03:15] thing and the people you could get by
[1:03:16] with just sitting back and and just
[1:03:18] sitting there like a bump on a pickle
[1:03:21] you can get by with that said brother
[1:03:22] ben am i going to go to hell if i don't
[1:03:24] say amen no
[1:03:26] am i if the church isn't on fire am i
[1:03:28] going to am i gonna go to hell to no
[1:03:30] you're not well okay then bless god i
[1:03:33] can do what i want
[1:03:35] but his bride loves him
[1:03:39] there's something about the bride they
[1:03:41] love him they wanna be there they to
[1:03:43] they they want to live for god they want
[1:03:44] to give it everything that they've got
[1:03:46] are you with me tonight
[1:03:48] there's something about you as the bride
[1:03:50] of christ that you want to give it or
[1:03:52] your all why because that's what's
[1:03:54] inside of you you're in love with him
[1:03:56] and if you don't feel that way tonight
[1:03:58] but maybe you are the bride but you just
[1:03:59] let other things get in the way you need
[1:04:01] to get back your spiritual love life you
[1:04:04] need to fall back in love with the word
[1:04:05] until you love to hear the messages
[1:04:07] again until you love to come to church
[1:04:09] again until you love to read your bible
[1:04:11] again
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:15] hallelujah
[1:04:16] he said
[1:04:18] he said he blessed israel
[1:04:21] he said god will prosper you
[1:04:24] he blesses me i don't doubt that he
[1:04:25] blessed balaam too
[1:04:27] certainly will you're walking in his
[1:04:28] permissive will not his perfect will god
[1:04:30] doesn't change his mind because he
[1:04:32] blesses you
[1:04:33] he blessed israel right out there for 40
[1:04:35] years what did they do married wives
[1:04:36] raised families kiss the children paid
[1:04:38] their tithes
[1:04:39] lived right out there
[1:04:41] oh church i don't want to be a people
[1:04:43] that's in his permissive will
[1:04:46] i don't want to just be another church
[1:04:49] or you hear me death reading today
[1:04:51] about how that the glory of the lord
[1:04:53] filled the temple
[1:04:54] there in solomon's day
[1:04:56] and in acts 2 it says that the the
[1:04:59] spirit come down and filled the house
[1:05:01] that they were sitting in and acts 4 it
[1:05:03] happened again it filled the house they
[1:05:05] were sitting in i want to strive for
[1:05:07] that
[1:05:08] i want to strive for that i want i don't
[1:05:10] want to sit in his permissive will and
[1:05:12] say well we can come to church and read
[1:05:14] a few quotes and we'll be okay we can
[1:05:16] come and sing a few songs and we'll be
[1:05:18] okay and raise our hand once in a while
[1:05:20] but i want to be in his perfect will if
[1:05:22] his perfect will is to have a church
[1:05:24] that's on fire a church that loves the
[1:05:26] lord a church that the atmosphere is
[1:05:28] right then that's what i want to be
[1:05:31] i don't want to be anything less than
[1:05:33] what his perfect will is are you with me
[1:05:35] tonight he said but it's wednesday night
[1:05:36] i want his perfect will on a wednesday
[1:05:39] night i want his perfect will on a
[1:05:41] sunday morning a sunday night
[1:05:43] every service may not be shouting and
[1:05:45] running and everything else because
[1:05:46] that's not always his perfect will but
[1:05:48] it is his perfect will for his people to
[1:05:50] love him
[1:05:52] are you with me now
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:56] he said
[1:05:57] god blessed him in the wilderness them
[1:05:59] fed them with the man on and on every
[1:06:01] one of them perished because they never
[1:06:02] kept his original will his word they
[1:06:04] took his permissive way
[1:06:06] go ahead but you remember when they left
[1:06:08] kadesh they never journeyed any farther
[1:06:10] they just went around and around in the
[1:06:11] wilderness where they could have been
[1:06:13] out in two days after that they could
[1:06:15] could have been on the promised land
[1:06:16] they journeyed 40 years
[1:06:18] every one of them died but joshua and
[1:06:20] caleb the ones that stayed
[1:06:21] on the original word
[1:06:24] now brother branham said any move from
[1:06:26] the original plan of god throws the
[1:06:27] whole thing out of cater this is the
[1:06:28] next day
[1:06:29] that he preached
[1:06:31] another sermon
[1:06:32] he said any move out of the original
[1:06:34] plan of god throws the whole thing out
[1:06:35] of cater we can't move from that
[1:06:36] original word
[1:06:38] he said we talked on it last evening
[1:06:40] evening before last on balaam he got
[1:06:41] god's answer straight and clear don't go
[1:06:43] but he has a permissive will
[1:06:45] you can work in that if you wish to and
[1:06:47] god will make it honor him
[1:06:50] but it's still not god's perfect will
[1:06:52] and that's what we should strive for his
[1:06:53] perfect will not his permissive will
[1:06:56] he said the kingdom of god i love this
[1:06:58] the kingdom of god which is in the earth
[1:07:00] today
[1:07:02] can never be set up justly
[1:07:05] on permissive will
[1:07:09] the millennium won't be permissive will.
[1:07:13] are you with me now neither will the
[1:07:14] kingdom of god on the earth
[1:07:16] neither will his end time bride it won't
[1:07:18] be permissive will and those that live
[1:07:20] in that permissive will will end up back
[1:07:22] in denominationalism
[1:07:24] right because they they live in that
[1:07:26] realm but we don't live in that realm we
[1:07:28] live in his perfect world he did brother
[1:07:29] ben does that mean i do everything right
[1:07:31] no it doesn't it means you strive for
[1:07:33] that
[1:07:34] it means you want that your desire is
[1:07:36] that sure you're going to mess up but
[1:07:38] your desire is right your heart is right
[1:07:42] and i think that's where brother branham
[1:07:43] is going with jonah as we look here that
[1:07:45] really maybe we give jonah a little bit
[1:07:47] of a hard time about being a backsider
[1:07:49] brother branham did too but there come a
[1:07:51] time when brother branham realized well
[1:07:52] maybe he wasn't really a backsider but
[1:07:54] he just couldn't decide what to do and
[1:07:56] and he ended up out on in a place where
[1:07:59] he didn't even know how he got there
[1:08:00] what are you doing here they said why
[1:08:02] did you do this i don't even know
[1:08:06] somehow it was in the plan of god
[1:08:10] oh my
[1:08:11] now brother branham said it's got to
[1:08:13] come back to his perfect will
[1:08:15] you think of abraham and hagar that was
[1:08:18] god's permissive will polygamy was god's
[1:08:20] permissive will
[1:08:22] not his perfect will
[1:08:24] how do you know that because in the
[1:08:25] beginning he created one man and one
[1:08:27] woman
[1:08:28] right he created one uh
[1:08:31] a male deal with a bunch of female deer
[1:08:35] there was one uh one male of almost
[1:08:38] every uh every kind that could have have
[1:08:40] many but not with man
[1:08:44] it's one and one
[1:08:46] so again you see somebody trying to live
[1:08:48] in polygamy
[1:08:49] they're living in god's permissive will
[1:08:51] trying to
[1:08:53] and he don't allow that today because
[1:08:54] the bible tells us at the times of this
[1:08:56] ignorance god winked at
[1:08:59] but now he commandeth all men everywhere
[1:09:01] to repent it's just an excuse
[1:09:04] because the man wants to fulfill lust
[1:09:07] i'm just being honest with you tonight
[1:09:09] so you find somebody that that'll
[1:09:12] constantly i've had people try to
[1:09:14] constantly give me their revelation on
[1:09:15] marriage and divorce that oh god allows
[1:09:17] polygamy god allows polygamy not anymore
[1:09:20] we're not living in permissive will
[1:09:22] anymore
[1:09:23] we're living in his perfect will
[1:09:25] and there's some things that he's
[1:09:26] allowed even between a man and a woman
[1:09:28] that one day won't be there anymore
[1:09:30] jesus said in the in heaven they don't
[1:09:32] marry or give in marriage but while
[1:09:34] we're here but see we don't fully go
[1:09:36] into his perfect will until we leave
[1:09:38] here
[1:09:39] you understand but we've strived for it
[1:09:42] everything we can do
[1:09:48] mark twain had a good uh
[1:09:50] rejoinder to that a mormon man asked him
[1:09:52] he said
[1:09:53] he said don't you believe in polygamy he
[1:09:55] said no he said the scripture's against
[1:09:57] it he said well show me the scripture he
[1:09:59] said the bible says no man can serve two
[1:10:01] masters
[1:10:09] brother branham said so we really
[1:10:11] believe that god never changes his mind
[1:10:12] about what he said he always keeps it
[1:10:15] true do you believe that tonight
[1:10:17] but he has a permissive will
[1:10:19] he said now there's where the trouble
[1:10:20] lays we try to work on god's permissive
[1:10:23] will and he will permit it but also if
[1:10:25] we take his permissive will though it's
[1:10:26] not right
[1:10:28] i love this he will make his permissive
[1:10:30] will to work out together
[1:10:32] to glorify his perfect will
[1:10:34] there's nothing i've read this to you
[1:10:36] before but it just fits here there's
[1:10:38] nothing will go wrong with god
[1:10:40] now we're going to pull out and see the
[1:10:41] big picture you understand
[1:10:43] in the in the micro when you're looking
[1:10:45] at in your own life you want to do the
[1:10:46] perfect will of god strive for the
[1:10:48] perfect will of god but yet you know
[1:10:50] you've messed up you know you've done
[1:10:51] things that weren't in the perfect will
[1:10:52] of god but what's god going to do
[1:10:54] because you're his bride you're his
[1:10:56] elect you want to be in his perfect will
[1:10:58] i believe even jonah wanted to be in his
[1:11:00] perfect will his flesh his mind whatever
[1:11:02] it was just didn't allow him to do it so
[1:11:04] god made a way
[1:11:06] god prepared a fish amen
[1:11:08] amen maybe you come into this earth weak
[1:11:10] in some way maybe you come in and you
[1:11:12] find yourself you found yourself in
[1:11:14] trouble in sin or in some kind of an
[1:11:17] issue where you just can't seem to
[1:11:18] believe like you want to but god has
[1:11:20] made a way for you to overcome that
[1:11:24] to be in his perfect will
[1:11:26] you can't look around say well i don't
[1:11:28] know why i'm where i'm at and i don't
[1:11:30] understand no just keep going forward
[1:11:32] commit yourself to the lord
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:36] amen he said we think it's wrong
[1:11:39] but he knows it's right
[1:11:41] it's supposed to be like this even the
[1:11:43] world's supposed to be like this
[1:11:45] right but again looking at it from our
[1:11:47] own individual responsibility lord i
[1:11:49] want to be in your perfect will
[1:11:52] yet i know you've got all things
[1:11:55] working according to your plan romans 8
[1:11:57] 28 we know that all things work together
[1:11:59] for good to them love god i believe we
[1:12:01] read this last week as well to them who
[1:12:03] are the called according to his purpose
[1:12:05] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:12:08] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:12:11] image of his son to be conformed so you
[1:12:13] wouldn't always be in the image of his
[1:12:15] son but you're going to be made
[1:12:17] in the image of his son
[1:12:19] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:12:21] many brethren
[1:12:23] aren't you glad he's still working on
[1:12:24] you
[1:12:25] i'm so glad he's still working on me he
[1:12:27] hasn't given up on me yet
[1:12:29] he's still working on me
[1:12:32] i want him to be proud of me
[1:12:36] you want him to be proud of you
[1:12:38] brother branham talked about the holy
[1:12:39] ghost going the tudor you know i'm going
[1:12:40] back and he's given the drama of it
[1:12:42] telling the father he said well he
[1:12:44] he he just
[1:12:45] he just won't do what you tell him to do
[1:12:47] he won't follow directions but then you
[1:12:50] come to that place of adoption where
[1:12:51] you're willing to stand there and he
[1:12:53] said he's just like you
[1:12:56] doesn't that make you proud
[1:12:59] i want to be as i want god to be as
[1:13:01] proud of me as alan was of matinee this
[1:13:03] week
[1:13:06] that right it makes you proud doesn't
[1:13:08] when your kids do something i'm always
[1:13:10] asking people about my kids at school
[1:13:11] hey how they doing i asked their friends
[1:13:14] how are they in school because you don't
[1:13:15] get sealed much in school what do they
[1:13:17] do they pray over their foods you know
[1:13:19] and
[1:13:20] and i'm always proud when they tell me
[1:13:22] good things about my kids
[1:13:24] why because i want them to reflect the
[1:13:27] work that god's done in my life
[1:13:30] i don't want them to reflect me in the
[1:13:31] natural but i got you've got to come to
[1:13:33] a point in your life where you could say
[1:13:34] son or daughter you follow me do what i
[1:13:37] do you'll be okay
[1:13:38] do what i did because i accepted christ
[1:13:41] as a savior for my sins i was baptized
[1:13:44] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:13:45] remission of sins and i have been
[1:13:47] forgiven and i've received the baptism
[1:13:49] of the holy ghost
[1:13:51] so you can follow me
[1:13:52] walk in my footsteps
[1:13:54] do the same things and you'll have the
[1:13:56] same results
[1:13:58] but he wanted to be the firstborn among
[1:14:00] many brethren the bible
[1:14:01] reveals that god knows every detail of
[1:14:04] the past
[1:14:05] present
[1:14:06] and future
[1:14:08] do you believe that
[1:14:10] and he actively works in the present
[1:14:13] to bring about his future plan
[1:14:16] he's not just sitting back
[1:14:18] letting things happen
[1:14:20] that's why we don't have to worry
[1:14:22] you don't have to fix it it's not up to
[1:14:25] us to to fix oh we got to get all the
[1:14:27] doctrine right figure everything out no
[1:14:29] it's not up to us to fix it
[1:14:32] god knows what he's doing
[1:14:36] he just said have you ever been good at
[1:14:37] something and watched somebody else just
[1:14:39] mess it up and mess it up and usually i
[1:14:42] worked in the title industry the
[1:14:43] realtors were usually the ones that did
[1:14:45] it they'd come in there and just
[1:14:46] constantly on my case and why don't you
[1:14:48] do it this way why don't you do it this
[1:14:50] way why don't you do it that way well
[1:14:52] you know i have the license
[1:14:55] all right i've been trained
[1:14:57] i spent 15 years in the industry i know
[1:14:58] what i'm doing it frustrates you don't
[1:15:00] it or maybe you had a boss that didn't
[1:15:02] know what they were doing
[1:15:03] we had a guy buy us out one time in the
[1:15:05] title industry and he bought our
[1:15:07] industry come from the another insurance
[1:15:10] industry wasn't land title at all and he
[1:15:12] decided he was going to buy out a title
[1:15:13] industry and when he did he knew nothing
[1:15:15] about it but he was constantly making
[1:15:17] improvements
[1:15:18] walking in there telling you why don't
[1:15:20] you do this why don't you do that
[1:15:22] and uh and finally uh i guess you know
[1:15:26] you just get tired of it you say why
[1:15:28] don't you go away
[1:15:30] and i can do my job you think god ever
[1:15:32] feels like that
[1:15:36] i'm just trying to bring it down on a
[1:15:37] human level now
[1:15:39] why don't you just go away so i can do
[1:15:41] my job you're constantly worrying about
[1:15:43] tomorrow you're constantly meddling with
[1:15:45] everything that's going on you're
[1:15:46] constantly trying to fix stuff and
[1:15:48] figure stuff out and i've already got it
[1:15:50] done
[1:15:51] the whale's already in the ocean
[1:15:54] he's been growing for years the fish has
[1:15:56] gotten big everything's already laid out
[1:15:57] but here you are worrying about what's
[1:15:59] going to happen tomorrow it's time you
[1:16:01] committed that to god let him do it
[1:16:04] god says let me do it i'm i'm qualified
[1:16:06] to do it i'm trained to do it i i i'm
[1:16:09] the one who created you
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:14] i i know my thoughts concerning you
[1:16:16] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:16:18] bringing expected in god says i know you
[1:16:20] i i birthed you i brought you where you
[1:16:22] were at don't don't speak to me like i
[1:16:24] don't know what i'm doing
[1:16:27] oh god
[1:16:30] no brother branham
[1:16:33] if you'll bear with me for just a few
[1:16:34] more minutes tonight
[1:16:36] we'll get through this brother branham
[1:16:37] preaches for years that jonah was
[1:16:40] backslid
[1:16:42] for years
[1:16:43] brother branham preached that jonah was
[1:16:44] backstage sometime around 1958
[1:16:47] when he changed i think actually in 1959
[1:16:50] i think this was the sermon when brother
[1:16:52] branham begins to make it clear
[1:16:53] and it was in the queen of sheba because
[1:16:55] he's dealing with what jesus said about
[1:16:57] jonah
[1:16:58] being a sign
[1:17:00] the sign of the prophet jonas
[1:17:02] and he's beginning to realize also in
[1:17:04] his own ministry this parallels with
[1:17:06] what we said at the beginning
[1:17:07] brother branham even the visions he said
[1:17:09] well this isn't the perfect will of god
[1:17:11] but he come to find out later was the
[1:17:12] sign of the son of man
[1:17:15] now think about it
[1:17:18] huh he he's he's growing in his own
[1:17:20] understanding of that so he comes to the
[1:17:22] sign of son of man this is linked to
[1:17:23] that because when he begins to go
[1:17:24] preaching he preaches it over and over
[1:17:26] again the queen of sheba the queen of
[1:17:27] the south all those sermons he preaches
[1:17:29] about the queen of sheba and in those
[1:17:31] sermons he deals with the son of man
[1:17:33] ministry
[1:17:34] and so in dealing with that he begins to
[1:17:36] defend jonah
[1:17:38] right he's defending himself i think too
[1:17:43] he said let's stop just for a minute to
[1:17:44] straighten my expression
[1:17:47] that i made about jonah
[1:17:49] i don't know what people do with that
[1:17:50] who believe that everything brother
[1:17:51] random ever said was thus saith the lord
[1:17:55] i believe brother bran was a prophet
[1:17:56] whenever he said anything he said
[1:17:58] but if you believe everything he ever
[1:18:00] said was thus death lord you don't allow
[1:18:01] him to grow
[1:18:02] as a prophet
[1:18:04] right he said let's just stop just for a
[1:18:07] minute to straighten my expression i
[1:18:08] made about joan he said i do not believe
[1:18:10] he was backslid he said he did what god
[1:18:12] told him not to do
[1:18:14] he said but god knew all the time he was
[1:18:16] going to do it
[1:18:17] for god's infinite and he knows all
[1:18:19] things
[1:18:20] he said and we are told or i have read
[1:18:22] that the people of nineveh were
[1:18:24] worshipers of idols and their sins had
[1:18:26] got great and one of their gods
[1:18:28] especially the god of the sea was a
[1:18:29] whale and it was the god of the sea
[1:18:31] because it was the largest specie in the
[1:18:33] sea
[1:18:34] he said in the people their occupation
[1:18:36] was fishing and as all of them at their
[1:18:38] tasks that morning drawing in the nets
[1:18:40] of fishes
[1:18:41] all of a sudden up comes the god of the
[1:18:43] sea
[1:18:44] opens up his mouth and the prophet walks
[1:18:46] out
[1:18:47] sure they repented it was all in order
[1:18:52] now watch brother branham's looking at
[1:18:54] the big picture now
[1:18:55] a prophet was a sign
[1:18:57] and and really both are true
[1:19:00] if you think about it as we said brother
[1:19:02] comes back later and preaches a man
[1:19:03] running from the presence of the lord
[1:19:06] and so it really donate again there's no
[1:19:08] excuse for what jonah did
[1:19:10] and yet a prophet is a sign watch out
[1:19:12] brother branham always keeps coming back
[1:19:14] to the fact he was a prophet
[1:19:16] now we got to be careful with this again
[1:19:18] because you say well i'll just i'll just
[1:19:19] do like joan i'll just go do everything
[1:19:21] against the word of god and then god
[1:19:23] will just bring it out the way he wants
[1:19:24] it we can't do it like that
[1:19:27] you remember brother branham couldn't
[1:19:28] smoke or drink some of us did
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] brother branham tried to smoke couldn't
[1:19:34] smoke why he was a prophet
[1:19:39] you're not less of a christian than he
[1:19:40] was
[1:19:41] he still had to be saved but god was
[1:19:43] saving him for a special purpose
[1:19:46] right he had to have a clean vessel for
[1:19:48] that purpose and so god would save him
[1:19:51] from things maybe he wouldn't save me
[1:19:52] from
[1:19:53] right some of us
[1:19:55] he tried to commit suicide and
[1:19:56] everything else and
[1:19:58] and and that don't mean that you should
[1:20:00] right it's like that's the danger of
[1:20:02] using a prophet's life as an example
[1:20:04] christ is our example
[1:20:06] but see here was a prophet who was going
[1:20:08] out and he was a sign
[1:20:10] but not necessarily an example does that
[1:20:12] make sense
[1:20:14] it doesn't mean you should do what he
[1:20:15] did
[1:20:16] or we'd all go out and say well ezekiel
[1:20:18] laid out there naked on his side for so
[1:20:19] many days
[1:20:21] we'll just all go do that
[1:20:23] and and one of the prophets adam ate a
[1:20:25] scroll let's just all go eat the scroll
[1:20:27] but it's a sign
[1:20:29] right and jonah is a sign it's a sign of
[1:20:31] the son of man
[1:20:33] sign of the resurrection
[1:20:35] god's going to use him for a special
[1:20:36] purpose and brother brown said now again
[1:20:39] and behold a greater than solomon is
[1:20:41] here which is the same sermon just a
[1:20:42] different title in 1962 he comes on a
[1:20:45] little stronger he said the prophet when
[1:20:46] he got down to the sea coast instead of
[1:20:48] going to nineveh he took a ship that was
[1:20:50] selling out to tarshish he said now
[1:20:52] we've always thought that was a shortcut
[1:20:53] or dodging the duty he said but i'm
[1:20:55] going to try to take up for that
[1:20:56] preacher tonight
[1:20:57] i'm going to say that i believe he was a
[1:20:59] prophet and was exactly in the will of
[1:21:01] god
[1:21:03] he said i believe he was following the
[1:21:04] leading of the spirit i believe he was
[1:21:06] led to go that way
[1:21:08] he said he didn't understand it after
[1:21:10] god had commissioned him one place and
[1:21:12] here he found himself going another way
[1:21:15] again brother brandon said jonah was a
[1:21:16] prophet
[1:21:18] he said many people condemn jonah and
[1:21:20] say well he was an old backslider he
[1:21:22] wasn't backslid a man of god the
[1:21:24] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[1:21:25] the lord he said you believe that he
[1:21:28] said i don't care what the man of god
[1:21:29] does if he's ordained of god he might do
[1:21:31] things he thinks is crazy to himself
[1:21:33] but if you'll only watch it works out
[1:21:35] right out exactly right if he just goes
[1:21:37] the way he's led now watch
[1:21:40] i hope you realize this it doesn't make
[1:21:42] it right for jonah to do it
[1:21:44] and god will deal with him later
[1:21:49] but he had to do it for a reason
[1:21:52] sometimes god will allow a pastor
[1:21:54] brother branham said even the ones in
[1:21:55] one place he said he lets him go out
[1:21:57] with the sheep
[1:21:59] it let him go a certain direction with
[1:22:01] the sheep and and you wonder why was he
[1:22:03] allowed to do that well it's god's gonna
[1:22:05] deal with him later
[1:22:08] right you should always stay with the
[1:22:09] word
[1:22:10] but yet god may allow that just so that
[1:22:12] the sheep can be corrected and brought
[1:22:14] back to a certain place
[1:22:16] we don't understand god's work
[1:22:19] we just let him do it so again if you
[1:22:20] find yourself saying and people are
[1:22:23] asking you why did you do what you did
[1:22:27] that's not the question you have to
[1:22:28] answer
[1:22:30] the question is what are you going to do
[1:22:31] now
[1:22:35] see god is perfect the men he uses are
[1:22:37] not
[1:22:39] but he's backs them up
[1:22:41] right brother branham talked about the
[1:22:42] seven spirits of god he had the seven
[1:22:44] spirits of god in the seven stars
[1:22:45] revelation three and one he said this
[1:22:47] same lord identified himself with man
[1:22:49] that identified himself with man in the
[1:22:51] incarnation is again identifying himself
[1:22:53] with man by his spirit within man now
[1:22:55] remember the seven messengers the seven
[1:22:57] stars was his spirit within man
[1:23:00] this christ was the incarnation of god
[1:23:03] this is spirit within man he said these
[1:23:05] are mine saith the lord they're still
[1:23:07] his
[1:23:09] oh my
[1:23:10] oh my the seven spirit-filled messengers
[1:23:12] are the lords
[1:23:13] that's why i'd hate to spend all my time
[1:23:15] criticizing them
[1:23:18] he said they may be repudiated
[1:23:20] they may be questioned you realize the
[1:23:23] prophet's telling us what would happen
[1:23:24] today
[1:23:26] people say well they don't know what
[1:23:27] they're talking about that's what
[1:23:28] they're doing
[1:23:30] i've gotten i didn't bring it out to you
[1:23:32] but i threw it in the trash but i got a
[1:23:34] book the other day and some of you may
[1:23:36] get it in the mail if you do bring it to
[1:23:37] me and i'll throw it in the same trash
[1:23:38] can
[1:23:41] but i got a a book
[1:23:43] just
[1:23:44] just
[1:23:45] these claims they put on the internet
[1:23:46] they put them into a book paid a lot of
[1:23:48] money put them in a book about that
[1:23:50] thick
[1:23:52] trying to prove brother branham
[1:23:53] influenced the assassination of john f
[1:23:55] kennedy and
[1:23:56] all kinds of conspiracy theories like
[1:23:58] that
[1:23:58] it's not even worth giving your time to
[1:24:00] i got to looking at that
[1:24:02] i thought he told us that was going to
[1:24:03] happen
[1:24:05] they may be repudiated
[1:24:07] they may be questioned but they're gods
[1:24:12] he said indeed the human minds they may
[1:24:14] not even seem to qualify
[1:24:17] he said nevertheless they are the
[1:24:18] messengers for their age
[1:24:21] he said well brother branham did this
[1:24:22] and this and this
[1:24:25] if you put brother branham's life up
[1:24:26] next to any preacher
[1:24:29] you're going to feel sorry for the other
[1:24:30] preacher
[1:24:32] in signs and wonders in the way that he
[1:24:34] lived and the way he lived according to
[1:24:35] his conscience
[1:24:37] god allowed us to have a prophet who did
[1:24:40] a lot of things right but he was human
[1:24:43] allowed that too
[1:24:45] sure
[1:24:47] god allowed him to say some things
[1:24:50] that people would use
[1:24:52] to try to bring him down
[1:24:54] god allowed it that's same thing he did
[1:24:56] with abraham
[1:24:57] he said god you said abraham he lied he
[1:24:59] was the moses he rebelled to jonah he
[1:25:01] disobeyed a samson he sinned to david he
[1:25:03] murdered
[1:25:04] he also used the joshua and a joseph and
[1:25:07] those with severe blemishes far
[1:25:09] outnumber those whose histories seem to
[1:25:11] be perfect
[1:25:12] again god will deal with them
[1:25:15] god dealt with david he dealt with
[1:25:16] joshua he dealt with joseph
[1:25:19] he said all were and are his none dare
[1:25:21] deny that
[1:25:22] he used in bind through the holy spirit
[1:25:24] that he put within them to their own
[1:25:25] master they stood or failed and in them
[1:25:27] all was accomplished the sovereign will
[1:25:29] of god
[1:25:31] let external history attempt to refute
[1:25:33] this
[1:25:34] let them write the books
[1:25:36] it still stands the eternal god still
[1:25:39] walks
[1:25:40] amongst the golden lamp stands and sends
[1:25:42] his messengers by his spirit with the
[1:25:44] word to the people of every age
[1:25:48] now brother brown wasn't justifying sin
[1:25:51] a christian minister has a higher
[1:25:52] calling than even an israelite king
[1:25:55] you know that brother branham angel told
[1:25:56] brother branham he said you have a
[1:25:57] higher calling than an old testament
[1:25:59] prophet
[1:26:00] god wouldn't let brother branham get by
[1:26:02] some of the things they got by with
[1:26:04] but brother brandon put it this way said
[1:26:05] don't put your confidence in a man when
[1:26:07] that man leaves the word of god you
[1:26:08] leave the man but it doesn't mean he's
[1:26:10] not god's man
[1:26:12] if he's god's man god will correct him
[1:26:16] i'll spend all your time well was i
[1:26:18] deceived but i go through all this oh
[1:26:19] god will correct him if he was god's man
[1:26:22] huh don't don't don't let that shake
[1:26:24] your faith you just stay with the word
[1:26:30] what's jonah going to do
[1:26:32] that's where i wanted to come to in this
[1:26:33] service
[1:26:35] that's why i couldn't get jonah in the
[1:26:36] well
[1:26:37] and the fish
[1:26:41] the sailors said why did you do this
[1:26:45] he didn't know he never answers the
[1:26:47] question
[1:26:49] you don't have to be able to explain
[1:26:50] your past
[1:26:52] to trust god with your future
[1:26:57] you don't have to be able to explain why
[1:26:59] you're where you're at
[1:27:00] in order to trust god with your future
[1:27:02] yes aren't you glad you serve a god like
[1:27:04] that
[1:27:06] jonah 1-11 said they said unto him what
[1:27:09] shall we do unto thee
[1:27:10] that the sea may be common to us
[1:27:12] for the sea wrought and was tempestuous
[1:27:15] the storm was going on he said unto them
[1:27:18] take me up
[1:27:20] and cast me forth into the sea
[1:27:23] so shall the sea be calm unto you
[1:27:26] for i know that for my sake
[1:27:28] this great tempest is upon you now the
[1:27:30] bible tells us that they didn't want to
[1:27:32] do it so they attempted to row and
[1:27:34] couldn't do it
[1:27:36] remember but remember you you can't get
[1:27:39] by you've got to do what god wants you
[1:27:40] to do
[1:27:42] he told paul he said it's hard to kick
[1:27:43] against the pricks
[1:27:46] right so they're rolling they're trying
[1:27:47] to trying to get it to shore and they
[1:27:48] couldn't do it and finally they just
[1:27:50] gave up
[1:27:51] and verse 15 says they took up jonah and
[1:27:53] cast him forth into the sea
[1:27:55] and the sea ceased from her raging
[1:28:00] where did he get this from
[1:28:02] you think about it why the ocean
[1:28:06] why why
[1:28:07] if it was me
[1:28:09] i'd say lord have mercy till we get to
[1:28:11] shore row boys row
[1:28:15] where can i get find a ore where can i
[1:28:17] get to a place where i can help
[1:28:19] why didn't you guys some of us would be
[1:28:21] walking around why didn't you guys build
[1:28:22] this better
[1:28:26] didn't you know this was storm season
[1:28:28] what you doing offering passage to
[1:28:29] tarsus during storm season we like to
[1:28:32] blame other people don't we
[1:28:36] what's the point of giving me safe
[1:28:38] passage to tarshish when you're gonna
[1:28:39] get out in the middle and the storm
[1:28:41] blows up
[1:28:42] how come you didn't build the boat
[1:28:43] better why didn't you do that but jonah
[1:28:46] knew
[1:28:47] oh god he knew he had disobeyed god
[1:28:51] and he knew he was in a place he
[1:28:53] couldn't explain why he was there
[1:28:57] but he knew what he had to do about it
[1:29:01] you see the way back
[1:29:03] into the perfect will of god
[1:29:05] is by committing yourself
[1:29:08] to god
[1:29:12] every time
[1:29:14] that i have a funeral
[1:29:16] we do what's called a committal
[1:29:18] at the end joe knows what that is at the
[1:29:20] very end
[1:29:21] when you have a
[1:29:22] graveside service at the end of the
[1:29:24] graveside service
[1:29:26] and i have a little thing that i read or
[1:29:28] recite from memory and it's
[1:29:30] and it's something like ashes to ashes
[1:29:32] and dust to dust
[1:29:35] we commit our brother to the ground or
[1:29:37] our sister to the ground
[1:29:38] so the imperishable spirit may be with
[1:29:40] the lord it's called a committal
[1:29:43] that's what it used to be called at the
[1:29:44] end of a service brother branham calls
[1:29:45] at the end of a service when he prays
[1:29:48] for everybody when the prayer line's
[1:29:49] done he calls it a committal prayer
[1:29:52] a committal prayer
[1:29:54] what is that it's
[1:29:55] lord we're giving the rest of this to
[1:29:57] you
[1:29:59] we can't do any more
[1:30:02] right right
[1:30:03] we're committing them to the ground i
[1:30:04] think it's an important part of a
[1:30:06] christian burial because you're
[1:30:07] committing that body to the ground you
[1:30:09] can't do nothing for it
[1:30:12] maybe doctors have done all that they
[1:30:13] can
[1:30:14] and family has done all that they can
[1:30:16] they've loved and nurtured and protected
[1:30:17] and here's this person they're being
[1:30:19] committed to the ground and you stand
[1:30:21] there and say ashes to ashes and dust to
[1:30:22] dust you commit them to the ground and
[1:30:24] then when they there's nothing you can
[1:30:26] do
[1:30:27] but god can
[1:30:30] and i love to take
[1:30:32] first thessalonians 4
[1:30:34] and read it
[1:30:36] at the end of the service
[1:30:38] or at the graveside
[1:30:41] because especially when it's a christian
[1:30:43] and you know where they're going
[1:30:45] because you believe that the body you
[1:30:47] commit to the earth will be raised up
[1:30:49] again
[1:30:50] you can't do it
[1:30:52] you can't put it back together it might
[1:30:54] be completely decomposed you can't do it
[1:30:57] but god can
[1:31:00] and don't you see when you get out of
[1:31:02] the will of god when you've done so you
[1:31:03] find yourself in a place you can't
[1:31:05] explain even when you're sick or in need
[1:31:07] and you find yourself in a situation
[1:31:09] that a storm that you can't get out of
[1:31:11] it's time to commit yourself to the
[1:31:14] water commit yourself to the will of god
[1:31:18] say lord i can't do nothing more about
[1:31:20] it i'm tired of manhandling it
[1:31:23] tired of putting my hands on it that's
[1:31:25] why we talked about sunday brother ram
[1:31:27] said the man put his hand on it when he
[1:31:29] put his hand on he put his hands on the
[1:31:31] word and only the holy ghost has a right
[1:31:33] to the word
[1:31:34] we don't put our hands on the word of
[1:31:36] god we can't we can't tell god what to
[1:31:38] do
[1:31:41] jonah realized that he was out of his
[1:31:43] hands now he tried to get out of it
[1:31:46] he wasn't going any farther
[1:31:48] oh god don't you realize that's where
[1:31:50] your kids have to get that's where you
[1:31:52] have to get that's the condition they
[1:31:54] have to get in and where they can't go
[1:31:56] any farther and god has such a storm
[1:31:58] going on that there's nowhere to go but
[1:32:00] into the ocean
[1:32:02] yes
[1:32:03] and again if it was me if they tried to
[1:32:05] throw me in i'd been saying hey wait a
[1:32:07] minute
[1:32:09] stop don't don't throw me in the water
[1:32:12] that's the worst place
[1:32:14] at least in the boat i might make it
[1:32:17] in the water i'm not gonna make it
[1:32:19] but jonah had enough confidence in the
[1:32:21] god that he served he had that kind of
[1:32:23] confidence tonight he had that kind of a
[1:32:25] confidence that if he went in the water
[1:32:27] if he committed himself to the water
[1:32:29] amen he said commit me to the sea lord
[1:32:32] i'm yours i can't change the past but i
[1:32:34] can commit myself to your mercy and when
[1:32:36] i commit myself to the mercy of god what
[1:32:39] happens god has something prepared a way
[1:32:42] out for me because i'm not relying on my
[1:32:44] own instinct i'm not relying on my own
[1:32:46] abilities i'm not relying i've done
[1:32:48] everything i can do i committed to you
[1:32:50] lord i commit my family to you i commit
[1:32:53] this church to you i commit everything i
[1:32:55] have to you
[1:32:56] not relying on my own abilities anymore
[1:32:59] let me fall into the arms of god
[1:33:03] and jonah
[1:33:05] they pick him up
[1:33:06] crosses his arms
[1:33:09] and they lay him in the sea like a dead
[1:33:10] man
[1:33:12] he said god i can't control my life
[1:33:14] anymore
[1:33:16] that's what they do to dead men
[1:33:18] toss them overboard
[1:33:21] he just goes overboard you don't fight
[1:33:22] it
[1:33:23] he don't try to swim
[1:33:25] he just falls into the ocean
[1:33:29] are you hearing me tonight
[1:33:31] that's the place we have to get with god
[1:33:37] it just falls into the ocean
[1:33:40] look
[1:33:41] brother branham said there's a perfect
[1:33:43] way in a permissive way
[1:33:46] he says if i feel that if god here on
[1:33:47] the platform can show me things it has
[1:33:49] been in my room so so forth he's able to
[1:33:51] tell me just where he wants me what he
[1:33:53] wants me to do
[1:33:54] but i feel as long as i've got it all
[1:33:56] hooked up or i feel like
[1:33:58] then he won't put his hands on it as
[1:34:00] long as i'm doing it yeah
[1:34:02] he said and that's the way it is
[1:34:03] anything
[1:34:04] as long as you're going to do it if
[1:34:06] someone talks about you and you talk
[1:34:09] back about them
[1:34:10] god can't fight your battle
[1:34:13] you're fighting it yourself
[1:34:16] you're grabbing a hold of things trying
[1:34:18] to keep them from dragging you out of
[1:34:19] the boat
[1:34:25] i hope you can see it tonight
[1:34:27] just let go
[1:34:29] he said you're finding it yourself just
[1:34:31] let loose and let him do it
[1:34:33] just commit it to him he said the
[1:34:35] greatest weapon that i know of of a
[1:34:37] christian today is a committal to god
[1:34:40] when you can't do nothing about it just
[1:34:43] commit it to him and god will take care
[1:34:45] of it
[1:34:47] jonah committed himself to the sea
[1:34:50] like we commit a dead man
[1:34:52] a dead body
[1:34:55] lord we believe in the resurrection you
[1:34:57] see how was the sign of the resurrection
[1:34:59] he was dead
[1:35:00] he can't live in the ocean
[1:35:03] oh god
[1:35:05] you may be facing a situation you know
[1:35:07] you can't get through you can't live
[1:35:08] like that commit yourself to the will of
[1:35:10] god
[1:35:12] commit yourself to the sea
[1:35:16] and at that moment
[1:35:18] jonah fell into
[1:35:20] the perfect will of god
[1:35:27] oh god
[1:35:29] the bible said commit thy way unto the
[1:35:31] lord
[1:35:33] trust also in him
[1:35:35] and he shall bring it to pass
[1:35:37] you're worried about it we worry so much
[1:35:39] some of you older people that are
[1:35:41] married you look back and see all the
[1:35:43] people you worried about that you didn't
[1:35:44] end up married to
[1:35:48] you know what i'm talking about
[1:35:53] but god worked it out
[1:35:54] the way he wanted it now some of you may
[1:35:56] question that now
[1:35:59] but god did that
[1:36:01] you got to commit yourself to the
[1:36:02] marriage
[1:36:04] i'm committed
[1:36:07] or maybe you should be but
[1:36:10] just trying to
[1:36:15] but you know what i'm saying
[1:36:18] you got to let yourself let it go
[1:36:21] i've committed to this why argue about
[1:36:23] things that happened years ago that i
[1:36:25] can't change
[1:36:27] why suffer over things that i have no
[1:36:30] ability and this jonah finally realizes
[1:36:32] this
[1:36:34] if god wants me to go to nineveh i'm
[1:36:35] gonna go to nineveh or i'm gonna die one
[1:36:37] of the two is gonna happen i can't i
[1:36:39] can't fight god
[1:36:46] see jesus did the same thing
[1:36:48] he committed himself to the cross
[1:36:51] and then he committed his spirit into
[1:36:52] the hands of god
[1:36:54] into thine hand i commit my spirit
[1:36:58] amen he quoted psalms 31 5 into thine
[1:37:01] hand i commit my spirit
[1:37:03] thou hast redeemed me o lord god of
[1:37:05] truth
[1:37:07] oh my
[1:37:09] listen the bible tells us that when he
[1:37:10] was reviled he reviled not again when he
[1:37:13] suffered he threatened not but he
[1:37:14] committed himself
[1:37:16] to him that judgeth
[1:37:18] righteously and he committed himself to
[1:37:21] the grave
[1:37:23] believing what god said
[1:37:26] when he said i will not suffer leave my
[1:37:28] my soul in hell or suffer from my holy
[1:37:30] one to see corruption he believed one
[1:37:32] word
[1:37:36] preach
[1:37:36] spoken by baxten king
[1:37:40] but he believed it
[1:37:42] right because he was under inspiration
[1:37:44] when he said it
[1:37:46] oh god he believed it maybe you could
[1:37:49] grab a hold of something tonight and
[1:37:51] believe it it's not so much about what's
[1:37:53] said or who's saying it can you believe
[1:37:55] it
[1:37:59] he committed himself
[1:38:01] to the grave but on the third day
[1:38:03] he come out of the grave
[1:38:05] just like jonah
[1:38:07] come out of the whale the belly of the
[1:38:09] well
[1:38:11] let that be our example as the musicians
[1:38:13] come tonight
[1:38:16] let that be our example
[1:38:18] so we can be in the perfect will
[1:38:21] of god
[1:38:26] you can't do it
[1:38:28] fighting the waves or fighting the wind
[1:38:32] or fighting the sailors
[1:38:34] who are throwing you in
[1:38:35] as a dead man
[1:38:38] you just got to commit yourself to the
[1:38:40] lord
[1:38:41] he'll bring it to pass he knows what
[1:38:43] he's doing
[1:38:44] he's bigger than me bigger than you
[1:38:47] aren't you glad that he is
[1:38:50] i can't even get
[1:38:53] myself
[1:38:56] to do everything i know to do i'm not
[1:38:58] talking about big things i'm talking

[1:39:27] commit my marriage to you commit my
[1:39:30] my way
[1:39:32] my life my life the way that i walk i
