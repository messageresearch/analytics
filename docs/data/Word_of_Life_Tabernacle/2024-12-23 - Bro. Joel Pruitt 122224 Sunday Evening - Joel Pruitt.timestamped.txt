[44:15] verse
[44:23] 14 say Amen when you get it amen amen
[44:29] Romans chapter 9 and verse
[44:31] 14 what shall we say then is there
[44:34] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[44:38] he saith to Moses I will have mercy on
[44:40] whom I will have mercy and I will have
[44:43] compassion on whom I will have
[44:45] compassion so then it is not of him that
[44:48] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[44:51] God that showeth Mercy for the scripture
[44:53] saith unto Pharaoh even for this same
[44:56] purpose have I raised thee up that I may
[44:59] show my power in thee and that my name
[45:02] might be declared throughout all the
[45:04] Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he
[45:06] will have mercy and whom he will he
[45:09] hardeneth and Romans chapter 8 verse 28
[45:13] very very familiar scripture here just
[45:16] read a few few verses Romans chapter 8
[45:18] ver
[45:20] 28 and we know that all things work
[45:23] together for good to them that love God
[45:25] to them who are the called according to
[45:27] his purpose for whom he did Forno he
[45:31] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[45:34] the image of his son that he might be
[45:36] the firstborn among many Brethren
[45:38] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[45:40] he also called and whom he called them
[45:43] he also Justified and whom he justified
[45:46] them he also glorified what shall we
[45:49] then say to these things if God be for
[45:52] us who can be against us and you may be
[45:55] seated may the Lord add his Blessing to
[45:58] the reading of the word tonight if I
[45:59] could title this it would be his purpose
[46:01] his purpose I believe that every one of
[46:04] us tonight have a purpose how many
[46:06] believes that and I believe that if
[46:07] we're walking in his purpose then
[46:09] everything in our life Works according
[46:11] to his purpose and his plan and for our
[46:14] good it doesn't always feel good it does
[46:17] it isn't always things that we enjoy
[46:19] going through but everything that we go
[46:21] through every test you've been through
[46:22] every trial you've been through
[46:24] everything that's happened I don't care
[46:25] if it's a family problem I don't care
[46:27] what it is it may be a trial but
[46:29] whatever it is God has allowed you to go
[46:31] through that for his will and his
[46:33] purpose so many times we can look at a
[46:36] per at something going on in our life
[46:38] and we can say and I don't have my timer
[46:40] set but I'll look at the time just to
[46:42] see where we're at God God puts us
[46:44] through things and many times we'll
[46:46] we'll we'll look at it and say well I
[46:47] must not be in the will of God or many
[46:49] times we'll say why did this happen to
[46:51] me but if we'll only realize that if we
[46:53] love God and we believe on God then
[46:55] everything that we're going through is
[46:57] for his plan it is for his purpose and
[47:00] so we are part of his Symphony can you
[47:02] say amen and we're part of this great
[47:05] machine that God has placed here on
[47:06] Earth and he called it the body of
[47:08] Christ and it's a it's a machine that
[47:10] would it's a Well oiled machine and if
[47:12] you're a holy ghost filed believer and
[47:14] you're walking in the promises of God
[47:15] and you're walking in the will of God
[47:17] then you realize that God is using you
[47:20] for a purpose it is for his Divine
[47:22] Purpose in our lives and brother Brandon
[47:24] would say it like this he said you have
[47:26] to become part of the word to know God's
[47:28] Symphony his symphony is when it's
[47:30] playing you understand you're marching
[47:32] with the beat of the time you're
[47:34] watching for the works that I do shall
[47:36] you also greater than this shall you do
[47:38] these last days oh my the great changing
[47:40] of the time we get into the beat of the
[47:43] word can you say amen and we find his
[47:46] purpose the hour that we're living get
[47:48] into the rhythm of it and he says how
[47:50] does how he does that if you if you get
[47:51] into the word you find out how he did it
[47:54] at the beginning then you know how he's
[47:55] doing it all the time so if you look
[47:58] back you can look at any uh uh you can
[47:59] look at anything that God has done and
[48:01] you'll know that God always works the
[48:03] same way what can you say Amen so if you
[48:06] put you you'll find in Moses that he
[48:08] actually uh Moses was born for a purpose
[48:11] uh in the land that he was born in and
[48:13] he was born for a purpose in those
[48:15] people and he was raised a certain way
[48:17] for a purpose and it it looked like
[48:19] Moses was raised in a way that he would
[48:21] have everything he ever wanted it was
[48:22] look like that everything was going to
[48:24] go smooth for Moses but also part of
[48:26] God's purpose was when he was in the
[48:27] backside of the desert and he married a
[48:29] high-tempered wife that was also part of
[48:32] God's purpose and so all these things it
[48:34] look it looked like that God uh was was
[48:37] was working in Moses's favor when he was
[48:40] in the palace but God was also there on
[48:42] the backside of the desert so just
[48:44] because you're in the backside of the
[48:45] desert or just because it looks like
[48:48] you're going through a trial that is
[48:49] still working for your good that is
[48:51] still part of his purpose that is still
[48:54] part of the plan of God so everything
[48:56] you go through just because it feels bad
[48:59] doesn't mean it's for your bad just
[49:01] because it feels like you're going
[49:02] through the trial of your life doesn't
[49:05] mean that you're really in in a bad spot
[49:07] just because you're sitting here this
[49:09] afternoon and maybe you've got children
[49:11] that are not saved and just because you
[49:13] feel like your marriage isn't where you
[49:14] want it to be that doesn't mean you're
[49:16] out of the will of God many times God is
[49:18] allowing you go to go through that to
[49:20] fulfill his plan later in life just
[49:22] because maybe a minister would go
[49:24] through a hard time and and maybe he
[49:26] would get to maybe get called on God
[49:28] maybe he'd be a minister of of the
[49:30] gospel and and a god- calleded man but
[49:31] he can go through something because God
[49:34] knows what's coming down the road and
[49:35] he's got to prepare his servant for
[49:37] what's to come so God would get Moses
[49:39] ready for a great a great thing that was
[49:42] coming and so he had to get him out
[49:44] there on the back side of the desert and
[49:45] he had to actually get Moses in a place
[49:48] where he would not rely on his own
[49:50] abilities he would not rely on what he
[49:52] thought was right he would not rely on
[49:54] what he had learned under under pharaoh
[49:56] and and what he had learned in the land
[49:58] of Egypt but he had to get him alone so
[50:00] that he could hear what God had for his
[50:02] life he had to get him in a place where
[50:04] he could know that God was still in
[50:06] control of everything Moses had no
[50:08] control am mean he had no idea what he
[50:10] was doing but he when he went down there
[50:12] into Egypt remember he was a fully
[50:14] surrendered man to the word of God he
[50:16] was fully surrendered even though he was
[50:18] old in age and and he was well stricken
[50:20] in age brother BR would talk about he
[50:21] said he was an old man walked down there
[50:22] with a Crooked Stick and and a wife
[50:24] straddling the mule and he would go down
[50:26] in there it was nothing that he thought
[50:29] in his mind would be acceptable to take
[50:31] over Egypt but what it was he was in the
[50:34] plan of God and he was going according
[50:36] to God's purpose for his life so it it
[50:39] doesn't matter what we think about it he
[50:41] said you ain't got no thought coming
[50:42] amen if you think about something you
[50:44] think well this is what I need to do
[50:46] because God wants to work through me in
[50:48] this way just get yourself out of the
[50:50] way and let God use you and that will
[50:53] always work out according to his purpose
[50:55] what can you say man so brother Brandon
[50:57] would go on to say it like this he said
[50:59] we find his purpose the hour that we're
[51:00] living get into the rhythm of it and he
[51:03] said if you get into the word you'll
[51:04] find out that how he did at the
[51:06] beginning is how he was always going to
[51:08] do it all the time brother BR goes on
[51:10] down here and he talks about expressions
[51:12] and he says God is expressing himself
[51:14] and he said many times the S so n seems
[51:16] to be many times far away but when he
[51:18] begins to shine the son of righteousness
[51:20] will arise with healing in his wings and
[51:22] every life no matter where it's buried
[51:24] how deep how far in the waters or in the
[51:26] Sands or in the Rocks it'll rise to the
[51:28] glory of God why because God is
[51:31] expressing to us showing us just what
[51:34] he's doing his purpose is to show us
[51:37] through the flowers and through the Sun
[51:38] and through the trees and through all
[51:40] life that he is the resurrection and the
[51:42] life so when you look at a flower that
[51:44] is springing in the springtime that
[51:46] flower is for a purpose to show you that
[51:49] there is a resurrection when you look at
[51:50] a tree that is blooming with new life
[51:52] that is to show you there is a
[51:54] resurrection but when you see that the
[51:56] leaves are falling and things are
[51:58] starting to die you can see there is a
[51:59] death coming and there is there's got to
[52:01] be a burial but then at that time you
[52:03] can then see that there will be a
[52:05] resurrection all these things are for a
[52:08] purpose to show you that God really is
[52:11] and that God really does what he says
[52:12] he's going to do and so brother BR would
[52:14] go on down he said it like this God
[52:16] resurrects his life when it serves his
[52:19] purpose and if the flower serves its
[52:21] purpose and God has a resurrection for
[52:23] the flower how much more for our sister
[52:25] who serves her purpose in life and God
[52:27] has a resurrection for those that serves
[52:29] their purpose amen if you serve his
[52:32] purpose then God has a resurrection for
[52:34] you well can you say Amen tonight if
[52:36] you'll just come under submission to the
[52:39] word of God that is the will of God and
[52:41] then God will use you for his service
[52:44] and God will use you and raise you up
[52:46] for his purpose welcome the church say
[52:48] Amen tonight brother Brandon would go on
[52:50] down he says if you notice these flowers
[52:52] are not all the same color of flowers
[52:53] they different in color showing that God
[52:55] is a god of variety he likes different
[52:57] colors mixing it together making the
[52:59] bouquet that he loves God a god of
[53:01] variety he has his white flowers he has
[53:03] his red flowers he has all colors of
[53:05] flowers and putting them together he
[53:07] serves his purpose what can you say man
[53:10] he has big mountains and little Hills
[53:12] and plain and he has deserts and he has
[53:14] seas and he has the oak tree and the
[53:16] palm tree everything Blended together in
[53:18] its place where God the God of all
[53:20] nature can live and enjoy his being as
[53:24] living in his creatures in time that's
[53:25] serving his purpose so all these things
[53:28] are for his purpose if we ever realize
[53:30] that we're really pretty small in this
[53:32] economy of God but everything you do is
[53:35] is already seen of God and is already
[53:38] worked out for a purpose in God's mind
[53:40] God God knew that the acorn would fall
[53:43] and the reason he would allow it to fall
[53:45] into the ground and actually bring up
[53:46] another Oak so there's a purpose for
[53:48] that falling everything that we see
[53:50] around us in nature serves a purpose are
[53:53] you still with me tonight everything
[53:55] that we do serves a purpose purpose when
[53:57] a man stands in this Pulpit the purpose
[53:58] is not to be seen or heard but is to
[54:00] help the people it is to fulfill the
[54:02] word of God by preaching the word to the
[54:04] people when a man stands here it's not
[54:06] for self- Glory it is not so he can
[54:08] stand here and try to out preach
[54:09] somebody or look better than somebody
[54:11] but it's to stand here under the
[54:13] submission of the word of God and
[54:15] through foolishness of preaching Souls
[54:17] would be saved and so God wants somebody
[54:20] to get into his economy into his
[54:22] Symphony and do what the Great Master of
[54:24] the orchestra would say do and he wants
[54:26] somebody to play the part that he has
[54:28] called him to play in this great economy
[54:30] so if you're just a doormat in the house
[54:32] of God then we should be the happiest
[54:34] doormat we can be in the house of God
[54:36] Amen if you're just a if you're a singer
[54:38] in the house of God if you're a song
[54:39] leader a deacon whatever you are stay in
[54:41] your position and God will work that
[54:44] position for his glory and his good and
[54:47] so I I hope y'all are okay tonight I
[54:49] know this is simple but we need to
[54:51] recognize that in this day we are
[54:53] serving his purpose can you say amen and
[54:55] we're not serving our own ideas or our
[54:57] own purpose and and so you can say well
[54:59] I'm doing what's best for me and what's
[55:01] best for my family what's best for you
[55:03] and what's best for your family is to
[55:05] serve him and let him use you for his
[55:08] purpose can you say Amen so brother B
[55:11] would go on down and he says God never
[55:13] changes when God says anything that must
[55:15] forever remain if God I I if if uh if a
[55:18] man come to God and God healed that man
[55:20] on the basis of Faith he has got to do
[55:22] the next man the same way or he acted
[55:24] wrong when he healed the first man if he
[55:26] saved a man under the blood and that
[55:27] only if he saved a man under the blood
[55:30] and that only and will let somebody else
[55:32] get in just under education or being
[55:35] some Theologian or something without the
[55:36] shed blood applied to him then he acted
[55:39] wrong when he required blood for the
[55:41] first man see he must ever remain the
[55:44] same his purpose has always been the
[55:47] same his actions has always been the
[55:49] same can the church say amen and so when
[55:52] you see people today trying to change
[55:54] the program of God then you can say that
[55:56] that is not as it was at the beginning
[55:58] it was not so at the beginning but we
[56:00] are going back to the word because that
[56:03] is our absolute can you say amen amen
[56:05] our absolute is not a program our
[56:07] absolute is not something that that
[56:09] we've made up or our absolute is not
[56:11] even our pastor or or sometimes there's
[56:13] an absolute Authority that comes from a
[56:15] certain position but that is not our
[56:17] absolute today our absolute is the word
[56:19] of God and if we can submit ourselves to
[56:22] the word of God we are in his will and
[56:25] being used for for his purpose well can
[56:27] you say amen and so brother Brandon we
[56:29] go on down remember now we we've looked
[56:31] at nature God showing himself through
[56:33] nature his purpose for all these things
[56:35] in nature is to show us that he is it is
[56:38] to show us that God still works in
[56:40] nature brother brandom says that's what
[56:42] he would he read nature as his first
[56:44] Bible he he would look at nature and he
[56:46] would see he would see signs in nature
[56:48] he would see he would see how how a tree
[56:50] remember when the when he went and he
[56:52] talked to that uh that Infidel there
[56:54] when he was going to squirrel hunting
[56:55] and he talked talks to him about the
[56:56] tree and and how that how how the Apple
[56:59] about August here the leaves would start
[57:01] falling and the and and the apples would
[57:03] fall from the tree and he would actually
[57:05] sit there and prove according to Nature
[57:07] that God was real and so that even an
[57:10] Infidel had to see it and I say tonight
[57:12] if you can even look at nature you can
[57:13] see that God is still God and God
[57:16] doesn't change if you can look and when
[57:17] you're out hunting in the in the woods
[57:19] and things I don't do those things but
[57:20] you that do you can look out there and
[57:22] maybe you can just feel God all around
[57:24] you because the tree you're in God made
[57:26] it the deer you see God made it the the
[57:28] squirrels that are there God made it
[57:30] when you look up and you see the skies
[57:32] whatever is around you God made every
[57:34] bit of that and it serves a purpose even
[57:37] now all these hundreds of years later
[57:39] and thousands of years later God's
[57:41] purpose is still here today so brother B
[57:44] would go on and he also shows a purpose
[57:46] through his people and God would
[57:48] actually show a purpose through a man
[57:51] that would sit here and bring his
[57:52] children to the house of God and and
[57:54] actually uh come under the authority of
[57:55] the word and this day that is you are
[57:57] serving God's purpose for your
[57:59] generation you have come to the message
[58:01] of the hour you have not been lost in
[58:03] leosia but you have come under the
[58:05] purpose that God has chosen for you
[58:07] today and so God has ordained you for
[58:10] your purpose today and he is working
[58:13] that purpose for his good are you still
[58:15] with me tonight and so brother brand
[58:17] said God won't leave his program that's
[58:19] the reason we know that this day it's
[58:20] got to be simple see now he always works
[58:23] in Simplicity but God in the beginning
[58:25] that that could say that he could have
[58:27] made the sun preach the gospel or the
[58:29] winds preach the gospel or an angel
[58:31] preach the gospel but he ordained men
[58:33] for that purpose and he never changes it
[58:36] welcome the church say amen he never
[58:38] changes his purpose and his way of doing
[58:40] things he never took men out of the
[58:42] pulpit and said we don't need men
[58:44] standing there anymore no he he said
[58:46] preach the word be instant in season and
[58:48] out of season he always had a man to
[58:50] stand in the pulpit and preach the word
[58:52] now listen if somebody else comes and
[58:54] tells you if an angel from heaven would
[58:56] come and tell you we don't need
[58:57] preachers in the Pulpit I say don't
[58:59] listen to that devil that is trying to
[59:01] lie to you on we have one Prophet
[59:05] messenger and he has come and told us
[59:07] that God never changes his program he's
[59:10] always working in Simplicity God in the
[59:13] beginning he could have made anything
[59:14] preach the gospel but he chose men to
[59:16] stand in this Pulpit brother Stuart if
[59:18] he chose a man then he's got to have a
[59:20] man that will be submitted to the word
[59:22] of God he has to have a man that is
[59:24] willing to take on that word and
[59:25] actually do it it is through the
[59:27] foolishness of preaching that our young
[59:28] people are going to be saved it is
[59:30] through the foolishness of preaching
[59:32] that your children are going to be saved
[59:33] it is through the foolishness of
[59:35] preaching listen what man calls foolish
[59:37] God calls great to because you can look
[59:40] and say well that that we don't need the
[59:41] preachers in the Pulpit no more look it
[59:43] don't make any sense for a man to stand
[59:45] In a Pulpit anymore but God is still
[59:47] using men in the Pulpit
[59:49] today so brother Brandon would say it
[59:51] like this he goes on he said he never
[59:53] changes it he never ordained
[59:54] denominations he he never ordained
[59:56] groups of men he ordained men to preach
[59:59] the gospel not Machinery Mechanical
[1:00:01] Devices or any Angelic being it was men
[1:00:05] welcome the church say amen amen so you
[1:00:07] can look and you can say well this just
[1:00:08] makes more sense if it is not with the
[1:00:10] program of God it is not for his purpose
[1:00:13] and God will not ordain that thing that
[1:00:15] is outside of his will or his purpose
[1:00:18] but if you are in the will of God then
[1:00:20] you are under the word that God has
[1:00:22] given you for this day so brother Randon
[1:00:24] would go on and he says like this he
[1:00:26] says or any Angelic being it was men and
[1:00:29] when he brought Deliverance to the
[1:00:30] people down there he sent a simple human
[1:00:32] being born of a simple family and a
[1:00:34] bunch of slaves now remember this is
[1:00:36] Moses he's talking about he said now oh
[1:00:38] my what a God he is unfolding himself in
[1:00:41] Simplicity now I bet nobody looked at
[1:00:43] that that basket going down the Nile
[1:00:46] there and thought there's the deliverer
[1:00:47] they didn't know yet what was to come
[1:00:49] but God was already there working for
[1:00:52] their good God was working for the good
[1:00:54] of the slaves and the slave pit in the
[1:00:56] mud pits of Egypt even when God was
[1:01:00] still in his little baby floating down
[1:01:02] the river well can you say am man
[1:01:03] tonight so God was working in in his
[1:01:06] will and his purpose the whole time so
[1:01:08] Moses is floating down the river and the
[1:01:10] crocodiles can't take him out even
[1:01:12] though he's in a bad situation God is
[1:01:15] protecting him for his purpose and so he
[1:01:18] gets down there and he learns and and he
[1:01:19] learns all the things that that you
[1:01:21] would think a man should know by carnal
[1:01:24] by carnal carnality we would think think
[1:01:26] that Moses is in a pretty good condition
[1:01:28] Moses is saved from being uh being
[1:01:30] killed and Moses is put over here and
[1:01:32] and he's got a great palace to live in
[1:01:34] and his own mother gets to raise him and
[1:01:37] she gets paid to do it these are all
[1:01:38] good things but remember God had put him
[1:01:41] in that condition so that he could
[1:01:43] deliver the people in the end see we
[1:01:45] don't always see the working of God we
[1:01:47] don't always see the will of God coming
[1:01:50] about but God has it in his mind the
[1:01:52] whole time and his purpose is being
[1:01:54] fulfilled before you even when you don't
[1:01:57] see it come on so when you see Moses
[1:02:00] there's a baby it don't look like God's
[1:02:02] purpose is being fulfilled where is our
[1:02:04] deliverer they're looking for a man or
[1:02:05] an army or they're looking for somebody
[1:02:07] that can come in and take over Egypt and
[1:02:10] God comes in humility in Simplicity but
[1:02:13] God is still working for his purpose can
[1:02:15] the church say Amen am brother bandam
[1:02:18] goes on down he says he is unfolding
[1:02:19] himself in Simplicity now notice he had
[1:02:21] him trained in worldly wisdom so that he
[1:02:24] could so that he could fail and show
[1:02:26] that it isn't wisdom that will ever be
[1:02:28] delivered by think about it tonight
[1:02:30] church he did that so that you would
[1:02:32] know that we can't overcome by wisdom he
[1:02:35] let him be trained all the way back then
[1:02:37] so that we would know that wisdom will
[1:02:39] never overcome our enemy and so he would
[1:02:42] go on down and say like this he says now
[1:02:44] notice he had him trained and he goes on
[1:02:46] and he says but it isn't wisdom that
[1:02:47] will ever be delivered by it's by faith
[1:02:49] that we are delivered he let him go in
[1:02:52] and get such an education until he could
[1:02:54] teach the Egyptians WID wisdom he was so
[1:02:56] smart God was with that simple family
[1:02:59] and who could perhaps may not write
[1:03:01] their name and Moses was took into the
[1:03:03] highest of schooling with such a great
[1:03:05] education until he could teach the
[1:03:07] wisdom to the teachers he could teach
[1:03:08] the Geniuses and he said yes and God let
[1:03:11] him get that way so he could display
[1:03:12] himself in humility and to show that
[1:03:15] wisdom has nothing to do with it can the
[1:03:18] church say amen and Moses miserably
[1:03:20] failed in his genius brother brandham
[1:03:23] said oh yeah oh yeah he let him get that
[1:03:25] way for his purpose that's right so he
[1:03:29] has a purpose the whole time he let him
[1:03:32] fail for his purpose so when you fail
[1:03:34] you say well God must not be in this
[1:03:36] what I'm doing that doesn't mean that
[1:03:38] God's not in it God is working for his
[1:03:41] good even when it doesn't feel like he's
[1:03:43] working for his good and His glory is
[1:03:46] always going to be brought about through
[1:03:48] the believer even when you don't feel
[1:03:50] like his glory is coming uh coming in
[1:03:52] the right way or maybe you feel like
[1:03:54] well I'm letting God down but if God is
[1:03:56] behind it just trust in God if God is
[1:03:59] for you who can be against you if God
[1:04:02] has raised you up for such a time as
[1:04:03] this no weapon formed against you can
[1:04:06] prosper the weapons will be formed but
[1:04:08] they cannot take you out why because of
[1:04:11] his purpose and his will and his divine
[1:04:14] plan nothing can stop you from the will
[1:04:16] of God in your life well can you say
[1:04:18] Amen it may not look like you're in his
[1:04:20] will but you've been in his will the
[1:04:22] whole time Brother David your past it it
[1:04:25] it does Define your future in the sense
[1:04:27] that God knew what you would go through
[1:04:29] so that he could see what you would
[1:04:31] become there are things today that you
[1:04:33] would never allow in your home because
[1:04:34] of what you went through in the past and
[1:04:36] maybe that served a purpose for your
[1:04:38] next Generation maybe there's things I
[1:04:40] went through as a young person that
[1:04:42] actually made me the way I am so that I
[1:04:44] would not allow things in the Next
[1:04:46] Generation you see it may have looked
[1:04:48] like hell on Earth at the time but God
[1:04:50] let me go through those things so that
[1:04:52] the Next Generation would not suffer
[1:04:54] what I went through well I'm is
[1:04:55] preaching to you tonight maybe you had
[1:04:57] to go through something and come a
[1:04:59] certain way to the place that you are so
[1:05:02] that God could use those things to
[1:05:04] perfect you into the person that you are
[1:05:06] today many times we look back and we say
[1:05:08] well if God would have just been there
[1:05:10] then or if God would have showed up at
[1:05:12] that time or if God would have changed
[1:05:13] this situation God was there all the
[1:05:16] time he never left you he never left you
[1:05:18] without his purpose in mind and God has
[1:05:21] raised you up for this time with his
[1:05:23] purpose in mind to fulfill the word in
[1:05:26] your Generation Well I wish the church
[1:05:27] would quit blaming God for your problems
[1:05:29] and start thanking him for what he's
[1:05:31] brought you through quit worrying quit
[1:05:33] quit blaming him but saying well look at
[1:05:35] my past look at my family history that
[1:05:37] does not define who you are now but his
[1:05:39] plan all the time will Define where
[1:05:41] you're going because God has always
[1:05:44] looked ahead in time and seen the future
[1:05:46] of man you can't see tomorrow you don't
[1:05:48] know what tomorrow holds but he knows
[1:05:50] the very end of this thing and he knows
[1:05:52] who's going to be there and who's not
[1:05:54] going to be there so thank him for the
[1:05:56] trials that you're going through thank
[1:05:58] him for the things that have happened in
[1:05:59] your life because it's all been for your
[1:06:01] good and for his plan and purpose can
[1:06:04] the church say Amen tonight amen he said
[1:06:06] he let him get that way for his purpose
[1:06:09] so Moses is going out of Egypt and he
[1:06:10] and he kills a man on the way out and
[1:06:12] and he goes into a desert it looks like
[1:06:14] all hope is gone for the Egyptians down
[1:06:16] there that are stuck in Egypt it looks
[1:06:18] like God's people are going to have to
[1:06:20] wait on another delivery well are you
[1:06:21] all right tonight I know you ate a lot
[1:06:23] this afternoon but let me just go ah a
[1:06:25] and preach to you for a minute God all
[1:06:27] the time in that whole situation knew
[1:06:29] that it was going to take 40 years for
[1:06:31] Moses to unlearn what he had learned in
[1:06:32] Egypt but he didn't do that on listen it
[1:06:35] was for his purpose the whole time
[1:06:37] because there had to be a certain time
[1:06:39] that Pharaoh was going to be hardened
[1:06:41] now the Bible says to him that he will
[1:06:43] he lets their heart their hearts be
[1:06:45] hardened and there had to come a ramies
[1:06:47] that would raised up that would be
[1:06:48] raised up and actually be sitting on the
[1:06:50] throne there had to see God knew the
[1:06:53] actual time that needed to be for all
[1:06:55] all things to be fulfilled he couldn't
[1:06:57] do it in another day or another age but
[1:06:59] he had to wait until the people were
[1:07:02] ready to line up with the word and when
[1:07:04] the people were ready the messenger
[1:07:06] would come and the people would fall
[1:07:08] right in line with the word well can you
[1:07:10] say amen and another quote I don't have
[1:07:11] it with me but brother bandam said God
[1:07:13] could never send his message until the
[1:07:14] people were ready to line up with it and
[1:07:16] so when Moses sent was sent down to
[1:07:18] Egypt listen the first time he was sent
[1:07:21] and he was just a he was just a rich kid
[1:07:22] sent down there and he was raised in the
[1:07:24] palace and and he was next in line to be
[1:07:26] Pharaoh but when God got done with him
[1:07:28] he was ready to be the deliverer to the
[1:07:31] people but God had to come as a baby now
[1:07:33] I want to bring this around to Christmas
[1:07:35] time God had to come as a baby before he
[1:07:37] could go to the temple and teach at 12
[1:07:39] years old and he had to go in the temple
[1:07:41] and teach at 12 years old before he
[1:07:42] could go and and be in the synagogues as
[1:07:45] a 30-year old man and then he had to go
[1:07:46] through all those things to be led and
[1:07:49] and fulfill scripture all of his life
[1:07:51] until he would come to a time in life
[1:07:53] where he would actually go and do the
[1:07:55] will of his father and and then he would
[1:07:57] actually turn water into wine and the
[1:07:58] Miracles would start to happen and
[1:08:00] people would start to recognize him
[1:08:01] listen the elect would catch the message
[1:08:04] as it came in that day there was a
[1:08:06] virgin that was ready though listen a
[1:08:08] lot of times we realize we we see that
[1:08:10] that there was a baby in the manger but
[1:08:12] but but somebody had to have that baby
[1:08:14] somebody had to be ready for the word to
[1:08:16] be born inside of them somebody's got to
[1:08:19] be ready for the word to be born in them
[1:08:21] today well come on somebody the word
[1:08:23] that is born in you somebody has to be
[1:08:26] ready for it or the word came in vain
[1:08:28] sir if there's nobody to accept the word
[1:08:31] then why would the word even come
[1:08:32] Brother David when the word came to you
[1:08:34] it came at a time when you needed the
[1:08:37] word in your life amen God is not going
[1:08:39] to send the word to somebody and they
[1:08:41] turn it down if God has placed a seed in
[1:08:43] you then God has put that seed in you
[1:08:46] because he knows that there is something
[1:08:47] in there to respond and to grow what he
[1:08:50] has already ordained to grow and there's
[1:08:52] going to be Believers growing out of
[1:08:53] that family listen I do believe there's
[1:08:55] been people associated with this message
[1:08:57] because their kids were ordained to life
[1:08:59] I do believe that there may be there I I
[1:09:01] I've heard years ago that there was a
[1:09:03] brother in Canada and I forget his name
[1:09:04] now but he was in Canada and he had a he
[1:09:06] had a son that ended up becoming a
[1:09:08] preacher and I believe it was his
[1:09:09] grandkids that ended up really being a
[1:09:11] big help and and in the missions and
[1:09:13] things like that and and but God had
[1:09:15] brought a man who never quit smoking I
[1:09:17] believe was the story and I may have it
[1:09:18] wrong but there was a man that would he
[1:09:20] come to the message knew the message was
[1:09:22] associated with the message but could
[1:09:23] never lay down his habits why because he
[1:09:25] was actually looking that God was using
[1:09:28] that man for the next generation and the
[1:09:30] third generation after that God is
[1:09:32] always using who he needs to use or
[1:09:35] using the program that he has chosen to
[1:09:37] use to get his message out and to
[1:09:40] fulfill his will for the hour listen
[1:09:42] church I don't think any of us recognize
[1:09:45] the really the the the omnipotence of
[1:09:47] God he is in this room right now doing
[1:09:49] what he wants to do in your life he is
[1:09:51] fulfilling himself through you Brother
[1:09:53] David and brother Joe and and brother
[1:09:54] Isaac you look things and when life gets
[1:09:56] hard and life gets really tough on us
[1:09:59] sometimes and and and and the bills
[1:10:00] don't seem to want to get paid or or you
[1:10:02] know well come on somebody sometimes
[1:10:04] it's just just life right life happens
[1:10:06] but God already saw your life and
[1:10:08] already knows what tomorrow holds he
[1:10:10] already knows what the future is for you
[1:10:13] and he is working all things for your
[1:10:15] good so every trial for his uh for his
[1:10:18] glory it is for your good and every
[1:10:20] everything that you've went through that
[1:10:22] looks like it should have taken you out
[1:10:24] everything is working for you your good
[1:10:26] it's hard to say this is for my good In
[1:10:28] the Heat of the battle but it is for
[1:10:30] your good why because it's what the word
[1:10:32] said and just because there's an enemy
[1:10:34] that comes against you and causes a
[1:10:36] trial remember he goes right on and down
[1:10:39] right on down and says that no weapon
[1:10:41] form shall prosper so I think we just
[1:10:43] need to recognize that we are just
[1:10:44] writing in the plan of God and we are
[1:10:46] participating in in what God has for us
[1:10:49] we don't always understand the mind of
[1:10:51] God we don't always have to figure out
[1:10:53] what God wants for us but we are going
[1:10:55] to just do what God says and stay with
[1:10:57] his word and God will back up his word
[1:11:00] and he will not allow one enemy to take
[1:11:03] out one of his children he will not
[1:11:04] allow the he will not allow pharaoh to
[1:11:06] come down there and get his children why
[1:11:09] because just because it looks like
[1:11:10] you're at the Red Sea just because it
[1:11:12] looks like there's no hope coming just
[1:11:14] because it looks like that nothing's
[1:11:15] going to work for you God shows up with
[1:11:18] a pillar of fire God shows up with the
[1:11:20] word of God and God shows up and
[1:11:22] delivers his children Time After Time
[1:11:24] battle after battle come on somebody if
[1:11:27] you've ever been in a battle you know
[1:11:28] somebody delivered you from that battle
[1:11:31] if you've ever had a a problem in your
[1:11:32] life somebody had to bring you through
[1:11:34] that problem if you've ever been in a
[1:11:36] situation you did not see a way out of
[1:11:38] somebody brought you out of that
[1:11:39] situation it was God himself that did it
[1:11:42] and God will not change his way of doing
[1:11:44] things if God Did It for brother Stewart
[1:11:46] he can do it for brother Caleb and if
[1:11:48] he's done it for brother Harold he can
[1:11:49] do it for brother Ben if God has done it
[1:11:51] for one he'll do it for everyone in this
[1:11:53] building God is no resp Spectra of
[1:11:55] persons but every one of you are
[1:11:57] operating in his plan for his purpose
[1:12:00] can the church say amen amen and so he
[1:12:03] shows himself through nature he shows
[1:12:05] himself through prophets and and people
[1:12:07] that have always been listen everything
[1:12:09] that God needed was was always shown in
[1:12:12] his word he did not leave us without a
[1:12:14] witness he did not do something in this
[1:12:16] age that was peculiar to the word it was
[1:12:18] not something so different that he'd
[1:12:20] never done it before no God had brought
[1:12:22] prophets before so that we could see
[1:12:24] what was to come in this
[1:12:25] God had already fulfilled his word in
[1:12:27] times past and if he did it then he can
[1:12:29] do it now well can you say Amen we're
[1:12:32] not we're not walking blindly after a
[1:12:34] message but we can see it in the
[1:12:35] scriptures that there's already been
[1:12:37] prophets that have come and they've
[1:12:38] always come according to the word for
[1:12:41] their generation and when it was
[1:12:42] fulfilled the Believers could look back
[1:12:44] and say it was already written and now
[1:12:47] this day the scripture is fulfilled see
[1:12:49] it was God's purpose all the time it was
[1:12:52] God's plan all the time to be fulfilled
[1:12:54] at his certain time when the people were
[1:12:56] ready to catch that word that was to
[1:12:59] come so the people have got to be ready
[1:13:00] to catch it or it won't do them any good
[1:13:02] what can you say Amen so when you look
[1:13:04] at people and and and they're just not
[1:13:06] really walking in the message yet maybe
[1:13:07] it's not their time yet maybe they need
[1:13:09] to go through something to bring them to
[1:13:11] the message of the hour don't get
[1:13:13] discouraged when you see people that
[1:13:14] aren't lining up to the message of the
[1:13:15] hour because many times that's just
[1:13:17] because they they they they're following
[1:13:19] after the Flesh and they're not walking
[1:13:21] after the spirit many times they're
[1:13:23] walking after what grandma said or what
[1:13:24] Grandpa Paul said or or what my church
[1:13:26] thinks or or what I think or what my
[1:13:29] opinion is or what some Facebook
[1:13:30] preacher has posted but listen just
[1:13:32] because those things have got your mind
[1:13:34] distracted don't let those things take
[1:13:36] you from the purpose of God in your life
[1:13:39] and the purpose of God in your life is
[1:13:41] to line up with the message of the hour
[1:13:43] under the messenger that has come and
[1:13:45] not after somebody else listen church we
[1:13:47] have a purpose every one of us have a
[1:13:49] purpose but we are not to line up with
[1:13:51] something outside of our purpose don't
[1:13:53] walk after false gods don't walk after
[1:13:55] other things and if you do God is going
[1:13:58] to have to bring you back and you may
[1:13:59] have to go through things and things may
[1:14:01] have to hurt you and listen you you may
[1:14:03] go through battles that you didn't think
[1:14:04] you could come through but now if you're
[1:14:06] one of his and I believe you are tonight
[1:14:08] then I believe God's going to still
[1:14:09] bring you through listen we can go to
[1:14:11] Jonah and brother Brandon would say it
[1:14:12] like this and I don't have time to read
[1:14:14] the quote but brother Brandon would say
[1:14:15] Jonah was coming to Nineveh he said and
[1:14:17] actually he said it was actually working
[1:14:19] in God's perfect will the whole time
[1:14:21] because he said there was people that
[1:14:23] had to be shown listen um no Jonah was
[1:14:26] over here and he was supposed to go this
[1:14:27] go to Nineveh and and he would actually
[1:14:29] go uh he would actually go to Tarsus and
[1:14:31] and when he would get on his way there
[1:14:33] uh brother Brandon would say listen he
[1:14:35] said it looked like he was out of the
[1:14:36] will of God but God would use that for
[1:14:39] his Perfection and for his will and
[1:14:41] Jonah would actually be in the will of
[1:14:43] God and would overcome things listen if
[1:14:45] God had left him he had never come out
[1:14:47] of that ocean but God had a fish
[1:14:49] prepared before he ever made the wrong
[1:14:51] decision and before you ever made a
[1:14:53] wrong decision before you ever
[1:14:55] had a bad thought and before you ever
[1:14:57] walked out on God God was already there
[1:14:59] to bring you back God was already
[1:15:01] looking at you saying that's my child
[1:15:04] the devil can come after you the devil
[1:15:06] can put you through everything but the
[1:15:08] devil cannot have your life why because
[1:15:10] God already called you to be his son
[1:15:13] amen if a prophet of God can get out of
[1:15:15] the will of God and it still be used for
[1:15:17] his good then if you've been out of the
[1:15:18] will of God God can still use your bad
[1:15:21] for his good he can still use your
[1:15:23] weaknesses for his Purp perfect strength
[1:15:25] and just and in your weakness he said
[1:15:28] he'll he'll become strong and and so
[1:15:30] when you can actually look at yourself
[1:15:31] and say you know what I've been walking
[1:15:33] according to my mind and and my flesh
[1:15:35] and my battles and and it's all about me
[1:15:37] listen if you can lay that down and walk
[1:15:39] in the word again then you'll see the
[1:15:41] overcoming power of God in your life
[1:15:43] you'll see God moving again you'll
[1:15:45] you'll sit in a service and God will
[1:15:46] raise you up again to enjoy the house of
[1:15:49] God there'll be things happen why
[1:15:51] because you're not walking after the
[1:15:52] flesh but after the spirit in his
[1:15:55] purpose is that all right tonight I know
[1:15:58] I'm all over the place but BR would say
[1:16:01] it like this I do have this quote he
[1:16:04] wasn't out of the will of God he was
[1:16:06] doing just as God makes everything work
[1:16:09] together for good to them that love God
[1:16:10] that's right and we're called according
[1:16:13] to his purpose so everything Jonah loved
[1:16:16] God he just didn't feel he wanted to do
[1:16:18] what God Said to do sometimes we feel
[1:16:20] the same way about going to
[1:16:22] church let me get let me catch my breath
[1:16:24] for minute sometimes we don't feel like
[1:16:27] going to church even though we know it's
[1:16:29] the will of God to go to
[1:16:31] church man the church gets quiet when
[1:16:33] you say stuff like that it is the will
[1:16:35] of God to go to church that doesn't mean
[1:16:36] you're not saved when you don't go it
[1:16:38] doesn't mean it doesn't mean that you're
[1:16:41] it doesn't mean that you're not going to
[1:16:42] make it just because you missed a
[1:16:43] service but I'll say this you know God
[1:16:45] will use that for his good maybe
[1:16:47] sometimes you'll get you'll be at home
[1:16:48] on a on on a church service day or
[1:16:52] Wednesday night or whatever it is and
[1:16:53] maybe just maybe that's where you'll
[1:16:55] find
[1:16:56] conviction that you need but whatever it
[1:16:59] is God will use those things and the
[1:17:00] pastor saying good Lord I wish he'd
[1:17:02] preach and sto
[1:17:04] meddling but you know everything works
[1:17:08] together for your good come on how many
[1:17:10] love God here today almost everybody
[1:17:13] here loves God and that's a good thing
[1:17:16] we're about 95% in so the other 5% of
[1:17:20] you you all be the altar at the end of
[1:17:21] service because you need to love God but
[1:17:24] if you love God than all things think of
[1:17:27] your worst battle come on that
[1:17:31] thing will work together for your
[1:17:34] good all
[1:17:36] things well I mean you could just go
[1:17:38] into detail I mean I could go into
[1:17:39] detail about my life but you already
[1:17:40] know the worst thing that's ever
[1:17:41] happened in your life all
[1:17:44] things is that okay all things now
[1:17:47] brother Brandon would go on and I love
[1:17:49] how he deals with
[1:17:51] this and it's Christmas time so I tried
[1:17:53] to put this in here he said now we see
[1:17:55] here how that this little Bethlehem yet
[1:17:57] being unnoticed a little place not
[1:17:58] noticed too much of the outside world
[1:18:00] just the smallest of the Cities but
[1:18:01] nobody paid any attention to it but yet
[1:18:03] God had in his purpose that there's
[1:18:06] where all these things would happen oh
[1:18:10] yeah all up until this time God was
[1:18:12] working and preparing a place there was
[1:18:15] no room in the end because God had to be
[1:18:17] born in
[1:18:19] Simplicity God had to be born in
[1:18:22] humility and for him to do that it had
[1:18:25] to be he had to come to the lowest place
[1:18:26] in the city at a time when there would
[1:18:29] he couldn't come at a time when all the
[1:18:31] hotels were open he couldn't come when
[1:18:33] the holiday and express was offering
[1:18:35] free breakfast he had to come on well
[1:18:38] come on son listen I'm trying to wake
[1:18:39] somebody up wish somebody would wake up
[1:18:42] look at y'all you look like you're gonna
[1:18:44] be fun to preach to for a minute God
[1:18:47] everybody awake all right God come in
[1:18:50] humility do you know what that means
[1:18:52] anybody look at the way he was born look
[1:18:54] at the look at his birth God couldn't
[1:18:56] come as a king he couldn't come as an
[1:18:58] angel he couldn't come because everybody
[1:19:01] would have recognized him had he come
[1:19:02] and ascended descended down through the
[1:19:05] heavens had he descended in such a way
[1:19:07] that he split the the heavens wide open
[1:19:10] and he come down and he maybe he was
[1:19:11] riding on a big white horse and he come
[1:19:13] down and said hey it's me you know that
[1:19:17] would have been nice because then
[1:19:18] everybody would have believed but it
[1:19:19] would have been too easy for him there
[1:19:21] had to be something to hide it from the
[1:19:24] wise people of the day or the wisdom of
[1:19:26] men and actually be revealed to people
[1:19:29] who could really catch the Revelation
[1:19:31] somebody had to be looking for him to
[1:19:33] come in in a way of humility somebody
[1:19:35] had to be looking uh for God to come in
[1:19:37] that way listen and that the ones that
[1:19:39] were looking for it found it and so is
[1:19:41] it today when the word comes in a little
[1:19:43] church in Hardy Arkansas when there's
[1:19:45] bigger churches better
[1:19:47] programs can you say Amen bigger
[1:19:50] congregations and yet when the word's
[1:19:51] preached then God is actually here doing
[1:19:54] what he promised to do the whole time he
[1:19:56] never comes in the mainstream he never
[1:19:58] comes listen I'm not talking about big
[1:20:00] churches being wrong I I I bigger we are
[1:20:03] the better I'm PR growth everybody knows
[1:20:04] that and listen I I but but but but I
[1:20:07] think we ought to just go ahead and just
[1:20:08] say it like this we're never going to be
[1:20:09] the biggest group in the world come on
[1:20:11] we're never going to have the biggest
[1:20:12] congregations in the world there's going
[1:20:14] to be a lot of churches that are going
[1:20:15] to have have 10 times your numbers and
[1:20:18] that's okay because I'm not looking for
[1:20:19] the numbers I'm looking for an
[1:20:21] individual to become a Powerhouse and
[1:20:24] actually let the word be born in
[1:20:25] Simplicity again let the word be born in
[1:20:28] the heart of a man let the word be born
[1:20:30] in the heart of a housewife that will
[1:20:32] actually take her position and do what
[1:20:35] God has called you to do in this day God
[1:20:37] has not called you to be rulers of the
[1:20:39] world but he has called you to be Sons
[1:20:40] and Daughters of a living God he has not
[1:20:43] called you to be set up here and and be
[1:20:45] the president of the United States even
[1:20:47] because why politics is corrupt and if
[1:20:48] you put a good man in the white house
[1:20:50] then brother bandam said he'd come out
[1:20:51] corrupt just like the rest of them and
[1:20:53] so if we put one of our good young
[1:20:54] people in the white house I don't have a
[1:20:56] whole lot of Hope for them but I'll say
[1:20:58] tonight if they could just be a good
[1:20:59] Christian and let the word operate in
[1:21:01] their lives then that is God's purpose
[1:21:03] for them God's purpose is not to be a
[1:21:05] king God's purpose is not even to be the
[1:21:07] best preacher or the greatest preacher
[1:21:09] or have the biggest church or or have
[1:21:11] the listen have the nicest car whatever
[1:21:13] it is it doesn't matter those are all
[1:21:15] good things those are all fine things to
[1:21:17] have but God wants somebody who will
[1:21:20] humble themselves and recognize that
[1:21:22] this message is not living just in in
[1:21:25] Jeffersonville or not living just in
[1:21:27] Tucson or not living just in Hardy
[1:21:29] Arkansas but it is living in the in the
[1:21:31] individuals in the heart of the believer
[1:21:34] can you say Amen so God wants somebody
[1:21:36] to Humble themselves so that his purpose
[1:21:39] can be fulfilled in our lives he's
[1:21:41] taking these young sisters here and
[1:21:42] these young Brothers here to fulfill his
[1:21:45] purpose for the Next Generation listen
[1:21:46] if there's 20 years down the road you're
[1:21:48] going to look at these men and you're
[1:21:49] going to find out that the way they were
[1:21:51] raised is going to have an effect on the
[1:21:53] way that they're going to be you if you
[1:21:55] find out that if the parents never go to
[1:21:57] church the kids ain't never going to
[1:21:58] church and if you take the kids and you
[1:22:00] start letting them wear makeup at 8
[1:22:01] years old or 10 years old you're going
[1:22:03] to find out that they're going to do it
[1:22:04] even worse when they're 18 years old and
[1:22:06] you're going to find out that if you let
[1:22:07] your if you have a backsliding home your
[1:22:09] kids are going to become backsliding
[1:22:11] what can you say amen and what we've got
[1:22:13] today is we've got people who have
[1:22:15] lowered their standards because of peer
[1:22:17] pressure and we've decided that we can
[1:22:19] walk after our own ways and we can still
[1:22:21] make it but what you failed to realize
[1:22:23] is God had a purpose in your life and
[1:22:25] God had a plan for your life and the
[1:22:27] perfect will of God for you is to be in
[1:22:29] the house of God and to bring your
[1:22:31] children to the house of God the perfect
[1:22:33] will of God is to do what his word has
[1:22:35] already said the the the perfect will of
[1:22:38] God is not to just say well I'm going to
[1:22:40] make it by the skin of my teeth or I'm
[1:22:42] going to well come on somebody God does
[1:22:44] not want you to just uh to just walk out
[1:22:46] here and say well God's got me no
[1:22:48] everything you do God had already had in
[1:22:50] his mind but he knows what decision
[1:22:52] you'll make and some decision
[1:22:55] will will will harm your family some
[1:22:56] decisions will cause scars in you that
[1:22:59] you'll live with for the rest of your
[1:23:00] life yes it's going to work for your
[1:23:02] good yes it's going you're an overcomer
[1:23:04] yes your children are going to make it
[1:23:05] but you need to go ahead and realize we
[1:23:07] might as well Walk In The Word of God
[1:23:09] and work according to his will now so
[1:23:11] that our children don't have to pay the
[1:23:13] price in the Next Generation well can
[1:23:15] you say amen and I believe there's going
[1:23:16] to be young sisters here that may be
[1:23:18] Preachers Wives or there's going to be
[1:23:20] young sisters here that may grow up and
[1:23:21] be a Deacon's wife or or maybe they'll
[1:23:23] just be a person on fire for God and and
[1:23:25] and and help with children Whatever It
[1:23:27] Is God has a purpose for their life that
[1:23:29] you may not know about but God wants us
[1:23:31] to act now a a in a way that would
[1:23:34] fulfill his purpose according to his
[1:23:36] word and you know you say well how do I
[1:23:38] know the purpose of God for my life the
[1:23:40] word of God is your blueprint it is your
[1:23:43] map it is what you need to walk in his
[1:23:45] will what is the will of God it is the
[1:23:47] word of God what can you say amen and if
[1:23:49] we'll follow the word of God we're in
[1:23:51] his perfect will and our children are
[1:23:52] going to turn out right why because the
[1:23:54] word already tells us if you raise them
[1:23:57] if you raise them in the fear and the
[1:23:58] admonition of the Lord if a child that
[1:24:00] is raised right they'll not flee from it
[1:24:02] they'll not depart from it now now I
[1:24:04] I'll say this they may they may struggle
[1:24:06] they may fight demons they may every
[1:24:08] devil in hell is trained on our young
[1:24:10] people today but God is not going to let
[1:24:12] one of them be lost if you'll just hold
[1:24:14] them in the presence of God if you'll
[1:24:16] just hold the banner over them and say
[1:24:18] you know what my house shall be saved me
[1:24:20] and my house he said thy and thy house
[1:24:22] shall be saved and if you'll believe for
[1:24:24] your house then not one of them will be
[1:24:25] lost I don't care what the circumstances
[1:24:27] around them are I don't care how bad it
[1:24:29] looks or how gloomy it gets I wanted to
[1:24:31] say like this tonight I'm just trying to
[1:24:33] preach to you a little bit encourage
[1:24:34] somebody to walk in the word of God
[1:24:36] again and if you get your house right
[1:24:38] and you start praying again and get your
[1:24:40] Bibles out on the table and and maybe
[1:24:41] turn your TV off for once in a while and
[1:24:43] go ahead and just start meditating with
[1:24:45] your kids and and maybe get in that
[1:24:46] prayer closet again and start
[1:24:48] recognizing that I need more time with
[1:24:50] God and I need more time in the house of
[1:24:52] God let these things become become
[1:24:54] common again to you and say you know
[1:24:56] what I I enjoy going to the house of God
[1:24:58] again I enjoy singing in church again I
[1:25:01] enjoy praising again I enjoy worship
[1:25:04] again what is it it is God fulfilling
[1:25:06] his purpose in your life when you line
[1:25:09] up to the word of God I know God's going
[1:25:11] to make it all work out right anyway but
[1:25:13] why do we have to be pulled from here
[1:25:14] and pulled to there why don't we just
[1:25:16] walk in his purpose why don't we just
[1:25:18] walk in his plan amen sister Stephanie
[1:25:20] God saw what you'd go through and he
[1:25:22] brought you back anyway but you know
[1:25:23] it's a whole lot of easier if you just
[1:25:25] submit yourself at a young age to the to
[1:25:27] the will of God it's a whole lot easier
[1:25:29] if you don't have to bear the scars of
[1:25:30] yesterday it's a whole lot easier if you
[1:25:33] don't have to be drugged to church what
[1:25:34] can you say man it's a whole lot easier
[1:25:37] if you don't have to be you know come to
[1:25:39] church with a bad attitude it's a whole
[1:25:41] lot easier if you just enjoy yourself in
[1:25:43] the house of God it's a whole lot easier
[1:25:46] if you say you know what I'm here I'm
[1:25:48] might as well Rejoice while I'm here I
[1:25:50] might as well worship while I'm here I
[1:25:51] might as well go ahead and have a good
[1:25:53] time why because church is not just to
[1:25:55] come in and and just be and and feel
[1:25:57] like you you you you have to be there no
[1:25:59] God wants you to be there and you love
[1:26:01] God and you gladly do the will of God
[1:26:04] why because it was his purpose for you
[1:26:06] to be here tonight and receive whatever
[1:26:08] it is that you're expecting to receive
[1:26:09] tonight if you came expecting something
[1:26:11] bad then buddy you might get it but if
[1:26:13] you came expecting something that's
[1:26:15] going to change your life if you came
[1:26:16] expecting something that's going to
[1:26:18] change your children if you came with
[1:26:20] expectations tonight then God and His
[1:26:22] Sovereign Grace is going to give you
[1:26:24] what you have need of here tonight it's
[1:26:26] not who's standing in the Pulpit it's
[1:26:28] not what they're saying it's a heart to
[1:26:29] receive what God is speaking to the
[1:26:32] people sometimes we'll we'll sit here
[1:26:34] and we'll say well I just wish I knew
[1:26:35] what to say to the people listen I'm I
[1:26:37] believe I believe in all these things
[1:26:39] that we need to get prepare and studying
[1:26:41] all this but sometimes I believe that
[1:26:42] God just needs to move a man out of the
[1:26:44] way and speak to the people because I
[1:26:46] think sometimes we get so tired so low
[1:26:48] down on ourselves and we start feeling
[1:26:50] so depressed and we start feeling like
[1:26:52] we ain't good enough no nobody's good
[1:26:54] enough but if you're here tonight God
[1:26:56] saw you and brought you here for his
[1:27:01] purpose God didn't put you here just to
[1:27:04] just to be a doom and gloom
[1:27:06] Christian and I feel like my time is
[1:27:08] about to run out maybe it did run out
[1:27:12] that's what happens when I don't have
[1:27:15] don't have a timer brother Ben said I
[1:27:18] could have some of his time from this
[1:27:20] morning and y'all are quiet now praise
[1:27:23] the Lord
[1:27:25] let's just work on right down to the end
[1:27:26] of it brother brandom said that was his
[1:27:28] purpose of dying that he could still
[1:27:30] project himself through his church and
[1:27:33] make every word through every Age act
[1:27:36] just exactly the way it's supposed to
[1:27:40] act that was his purpose now brother
[1:27:44] brandham goes on down he
[1:27:45] says now God passes the Nobles and gets
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:50] weakness God passes those who thinks
[1:27:53] there's something to take somebody that
[1:27:55] don't know nothing in order to work his
[1:27:56] purpose in their life that's what we get
[1:28:00] God said to Paul my strength is perfect
[1:28:02] in your weakness my strength becomes
[1:28:04] more perfect as you become more weak the
[1:28:07] more you can yield to me the better I
[1:28:08] can use you the more you can forget
[1:28:10] about your education the more you can
[1:28:12] forget about your denomination the more
[1:28:14] you can forget about your stuff and
[1:28:16] yield yourself to me the more I can use
[1:28:18] you because you become weak and he said
[1:28:21] I'll make my own purpose strong what can
[1:28:24] you say man I'm almost done don't get
[1:28:27] scared he said I'll make my own purpose
[1:28:30] strong God can make strength out of
[1:28:32] weakness is that all right he said
[1:28:33] that's the reason he always does it when
[1:28:35] he chose his disciples he said the
[1:28:37] humility of his own son when he was born
[1:28:39] in a manger in a manure Barn in the cow
[1:28:41] stall and was wrapped in swalling
[1:28:43] clothes see he could have come through a
[1:28:46] palace he could have come down the
[1:28:47] quarters of heaven and a full Angel
[1:28:49] salute but he chose to make Christ the
[1:28:51] example for us and he brought him in
[1:28:54] humility now as the musicians would go
[1:28:56] ahead and come I'm going to wrap this up
[1:28:58] he said he would come in humility now
[1:29:00] listen Church anytime you see a man
[1:29:02] that's boasting saying look at me look
[1:29:03] at what I've done look at the look at my
[1:29:05] program look at look at this no I want
[1:29:07] you just go ahead and notice something
[1:29:09] that God never came that way God
[1:29:11] wouldn't even use a prophet that would
[1:29:12] point to himself and say look at my
[1:29:13] Ministry look at the way I am look at
[1:29:16] look at what I've done no he would say
[1:29:17] it's not me it's him it's not me it's
[1:29:20] him that's speaking it's not him that's
[1:29:22] doing these things it's him listen
[1:29:23] Church it's not brother brandom doing
[1:29:25] those things it was him that's s him and
[1:29:27] so many times we're sitting there and
[1:29:29] we're saying well well I I'm following a
[1:29:30] man no we're not following a man we're
[1:29:32] we're following a God that the man
[1:29:34] pointed us to amen we're we're following
[1:29:36] a message that was that was ordained to
[1:29:38] come in an age that we're living in why
[1:29:40] to fulfill his purpose of a return of
[1:29:43] the hearts of the people all these
[1:29:45] things have had to come from some from
[1:29:48] the mind of God and be fulfilled in this
[1:29:51] time and so we are in fulfillment of
[1:29:54] scriptures today and we are acting
[1:29:56] according to his purpose can you say
[1:29:59] amen and so I don't want to look at I
[1:30:01] don't want to look at Brother David and
[1:30:02] say well brother David's not in the will
[1:30:03] of God no brother David's walking
[1:30:05] according to the way God is leading him

[1:30:47] humil
[1:30:48] humility his
[1:30:51] purpose was to Blind the eyes of the
[1:30:53] wise and Pro but reveal it to

[1:31:52] bit but I want you to just know
[1:31:54] something tonight God is working in
[1:31:58] Simplicity and if I could say nothing
[1:32:01] else but this right
[1:32:03] here he would
[1:32:06] say what shall we then say to these
[1:32:08] things if God before us who can be
[1:32:13] against
[1:32:14] us how many's ever felt the weapons of
[1:32:16] the devil formed against you and not one
[1:32:19] of them have prospered and not one of
[1:32:22] them ever will
[1:32:24] see we we don't often know the plan of
[1:32:26] God but we know we're in his plan we
[1:32:29] don't often know the mind of God but
[1:32:31] we're in his

[1:32:58] your

[1:33:06] purpose if you want to with your hands I
[1:33:08] see several hands up in the

[1:33:12] right where you're
[1:33:14] at I know it's Christmas time
[1:33:17] and
[1:33:19] sometimes you know we get so caught up
[1:33:22] in Christmas that we forget
[1:33:25] that God came in humility in such a
[1:33:27] humble way
[1:33:29] that we think it's got to be tinsel or
[1:33:32] glamour as a pastor taught this morning
[1:33:36] we sometimes even the message gets a
[1:33:38] little tinsel on it but I wonder if
[1:33:40] tonight we could just humble ourselves
[1:33:43] and say Lord I want to be in your will
[1:33:45] for your purpose in my
[1:33:48] life want to march in the symphony that

[1:33:58] faithfully and become part of the word
