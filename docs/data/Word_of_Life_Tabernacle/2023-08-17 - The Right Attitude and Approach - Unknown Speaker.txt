tonight I need you I pray you granted Lord give us strength Lord to overcome every fiery Dart of the enemy we pray in Jesus name we're gonna go to Mark chapter 5 and verse 24 Mark chapter 5 verse 24 down through verse 28. and then we'll also read from John 11 21-22 Mark 5 24 and John 11 21 good to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night amen I thank God for these Wednesday nights it just seems like we're uh we're comfortable and able to preach the word I've always enjoyed a Wednesday night service I know what I was working which I did for many years in the public and and coming to church on Wednesday nights I was always tired but also it was just such a refreshing time to just take your thoughts off of everything else in your mind off of work and just come and sit in the quietness of the church and then to come in and Worship the Lord and and just give him all that we have so I'm I'm still it's still special to me to come in on a Wednesday night because I'm worshiping here with you as well so we just thank God that we're able to do that Mark 5 24 it says and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians have spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus aim in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole what a statement of faith and then John 11 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know isn't this wonderful I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God will give it thee amen I pray the Lord that is blessing to the word you may be seated this evening I want to talk to you about the right attitude and approach the right attitude and approach everything that we do requires an attitude and an approach that would be appropriate to that situation that we're in when it comes to Faith that it's no different you've got to have a right attitude you got to have a right approach you've got to have a right uh a right motive a right objective it's not just that when we reach an age of the spoken word as we'll be talking about tonight that suddenly you can just speak things into existence and and just whatever comes into your mind that you just speak it but that's not what the spoken word is at all in fact a prophet had to wait for inspiration for God to actually speak those things and and so we wait on those things and and we make sure that our motives are right and the atmosphere is right and and what we're saying this I was in the in the office thinking about these things I picked up this little book I don't know if you have it uh healing thoughts sister Rebecca Branham put together some time ago and opened up and it fell to this page and I don't have this in my notes but brother Branham says this he said no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives have to be exactly perfectly right and then you have faith he said if our hearts condemn us not we have confidence First John 3 21 we've got to have confidence so to come boldly Before the Throne of God in order to really believe that what we're saying is going to happen it's got to be right we've got to have the right motives behind it and not just that we're telling ourself that it's the right motive but is it really the right motive does it match up with the word so then if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence we've got to have confidence he said say I want this to the honor and glory of God he said then faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got a mental intellectual Faith he said I'm not a genuine Faith from God he said that intellectual faith will get you nowhere it might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for so we want something more we want something real don't you want something real and and so you've got to have the right motive the right objective and also the right attitude and the right approach now the Branham taught this all through his ministry that the right mental attitude towards the promise of God towards the gifts of God would bring results he says the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass will bring it to pass he said if you can look at it the way God wrote it and accept it in your heart God will make that word come to life aren't you glad you serve a God Like That so now uh brother Branham when he talks about these things he always used the story of the woman with the issue of blood and also the story of Martha at Lazarus grave to illustrate how uh that what the right mental attitude was and what the right approach was to the gift of God and to the promise of God so these women somehow they they tapped into that without having been taught or anything else but but they but they just seem to know what the right approach was there was something about them that their attitude was right and they were their approach was right and I pray God help me to come to church with the right attitude help me to come on a Wednesday night with the right approach to God you don't get nothing from nobody by coming with arrogance and or coming with uh with hate or coming with the ungodliness in your life but you've got to have you got to have the right attitude you know you you can't even get uh you can't even get a response from people without the right attitude right they'll they'll they'll they'll sit there and look at you but if you've got a good attitude people will respond people you that's what leadership is is is is trying to project something I project I realize when I come out here I project my attitude to the congregation if I've got a bad attitude here brother Joe on us Wednesday night you will too at least by the time you leave so if you don't have a good attitude tonight if you came here in a bad attitude borrow mine for a little while we'll we'll just be all right when we get done the attitude spread but these somehow they had a right attitude even though their situations weren't good even though she this woman was sick that touched him of His Garment she'd been sick for a long time she had no promise even direct promise from God like we do have a direct promise of healing but she had no direct promise of that she touched him of His Garment but she said it I I believe that if I can Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be whole huh so it was the attitude that she had that produced faith and got a response from Christ and that's what we're looking for now we have to take the right mental attitude towards the promised word of the hour what were they doing that he Christ was the promised word of the hour for that day and they had to take the right mental attitude towards that promised manifested word of God for the day so what were they doing what would it be it would be how do I approach this person how do I come in his presence how do I how do I get what I need from this person but not when the sense of manipulating the person but what would be the right way to come so and that would help us in every area of our life by the way if we come in the right attitude we'd get more the old saying is uh honey attracts a lot more than than something that would taste bad right that's not the same but it's that's the meaning of it honey I think his honey attracts more flies than vinegar or something like that but but now uh we if we take the right attitude we get the right results a lot of people don't want to demand results that's not how it works it's not how it works in marriage it's not how it works in a church not how it works at school not how it works in business and it's not how it works with God all right so now in in the promises of this day I want to give you some scriptures these are promises for our day what attitude should we take to Mark 16 17. these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with two tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you say well if Jesus was here I'd have the right attitude towards him but the attitude you take towards the word towards these scriptures that brother random taught us from for our day is the same attitude you would have towards him if he were here in the flesh so so he said they'll lay hands on it what attitude do we take towards Mark 16 18. they shall take up serpents of the drinking deadly thing it won't hurt them they show their hands on the sick they shall recover What attitude should we take to John 14 12. verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name he said I will do it what should be our attitude towards that word and so he promised us then that we would do the greater work so I want to look at that for just a moment because it kind of goes back into What attitude and what approach we should have in Mark 11 23 he said apparently asking to whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not down in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now remember remember that it's got to be something that God said for you to have confidence in it it can't be just something you dreamed up what would have been I I've got I I Got Confidence I'm gonna go out and play the lottery and win well though you'd probably just be down a dollar or two or however much a lottery costs these days you might win just so they'd be broadcast the newspapers that you were playing that you were gambling that's what the lottery is by the way in case anybody didn't know it's legalize gambling right but but but that's not the attitude it's not the right approach right we you know the right approach of faith is to is to do what God says everything he says and then believe for what you can't do right right so it doesn't do any good if I if I'm not taking care of my family it doesn't do any good to sit here and have oh I believe there's going to be a check in the mail I believe that it's gonna there's something if I'm not taking care of my family it doesn't do me any good I don't take care of my family first do the things I know to do and then God will do the rest but don't you believe he can do exceedingly abundantly even more we could ask or think absolutely he can't but we got to do our part first that's our confidence we don't have any confidence if we don't do our part so count the cost and then believe right that's the attitude the right attitude towards the word count the cost and believe hey man now then so one time brother Brown said talking about this this scripture of the Greater Works he said one time he said about the third poll and I hope I can put this together where you'll understand it tonight it's it's just kind of moving around and and so you just kind of have to grab a hold of some of these things as I preach them but he said one time he said about the third poll how it would come by this one way he said then by knowing the heart and then the spoken word so it's a sign of the hand it was uh knowing the heart and then the spoken word and he quotes John 14 and 12 and then he said when we hear the symphony beating changing fixing to change it's a junction time we notice as we begin to beat we've seen the works that I do so you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it we wondered how it could be and brother Brandon sits there and wondered about that for years how that could be and he talks about then he begins talking about Jesus how he turned water into wine now that's a great work that's a great work he turned water into wine and so when he did that he took water which could potentially have been wine in fact that water was probably going to be used for wine that they used and they were they but they just hadn't made it but he took the quote something had the potential of becoming wine and made one he skipped the process brother said it was a type of the Resurrection right because that's what happens but this isn't just Resurrection time because every age went down understanding and believing in a resurrection but this is the hour of the rapture so there's something greater that comes to us so then he talks about feeding the five thousand he said he took uh two fish and five loaves of bread or whatever that it was and he took a little boy's lunch and he he makes out of that little boy's lunch something that would uh that that would feed five thousand people now that's miraculous that's a paradox but it was the potential was in there yeah right but but he just bypassed the process right and so now now the 5000 was fed but he makes his point he said but in the woods so it's nothing there to make a squirrel let there be in their wants without anything to break it from what is it the same Jesus Christ greater things than this will you do if I go to my father not to take something that's been created break something from it and multiply a creation but absolutely create it's good now you understand why I'm CR to absolutely create and again you go back to questions and answers I keep beating this over and over again because a lot of times it gets us feeling down because we say well I can't just speak and things happen I've been speaking for years or nothing you know yeah you can feel that way brother Brandon said it had to be at the right time the right place the right approach had to be inspired of God right and so a lot of times what faith looks like in the real world is not somebody walking out here and saying boom I speak to you and boom I speak to you but it's working your job and doing what what God requires and coming to church and and putting up with people and and doing the little things that make it make life seem so so mundane but when you get to the end of it you realize somehow God kept me somehow God made that work some how God fed the 5 000 or however many kids you got somehow God did that right and yet but you were doing all you could do so you're not just you're not just pouring or or Pie in the Sky somewhere you're not just pouring all your hopes and dreams into well someday God's gonna move for me but you're doing everything you know how to do listen if you want to stay on fire for God I know how easy it is to get back sitting cold if you want to stay on fire for God you've got to do your part you've got I know we're the elect of God listen if you're safe you can't do nothing to be unsafe but you can get cold on God and I'd rather live on fire for God than I would being cold on God all the time well because I love him that tells me I am the elect of God I am a I am a born-again child of God and so I want to be on fire for God I want to feel the presence of God I want to know that he's here if you want to feel the presence of God you've got to do your part in the house of God you got to do your part to live for God you're going to do your part to read your Bible you got to do your part to pray that's the part we do but we can't do the Supernatural part he's the one who warms the heart right so it applies the same thing applies now showing he's the same Jehovah I hope we can just kind of enter in I know it's hard on a Wednesday night it's hard sometimes I I'm not rebuking you okay Wednesday nights are hard I I saw the video pan because I've got a screen in my office well the video paying the audience I thought oh goodness it's gonna be a gonna be plowing tonight and I'm glad you're here it's hard isn't it I'm a church you're tired some of y'all about got killed this week yeah it's hard it's difficult and working out in the Heat and not today praise God but the the God you know there's just so many things that happen and you've been taking care of your kids are in school now and many of them are and now or you're homeschool and sometimes it's worse and and you're tired and you're weary and you don't you know if you could just enter in for a minute if we could just walk in if we had the if we had the holy of holies here with us today you know the Old Testament in the Old Testament in the temple there was the Holy holiest place and behind it was behind Badger skins and if you went in behind the veil if you had the opportunity to take a step behind the veil and just walk back there brother Bill and I'm just going to shut myself in and be in the presence of the shoe brand be in the presence of the art be in the presence of the Shekinah Glory if you could do that tonight wouldn't you take advantage of that opportunity you wouldn't pass it up we went the other day to uh to uh Eureka Springs and and the passion play wasn't going that day but I went to the Bible Museum and I really enjoyed that but I was kind of disappointed I didn't go get to go in the model of the Tabernacle and those things because they didn't have a tour when we were there I was kind of disappointed in that but how much more if I if I could go in the real thing Brother David if I could walk in and shut the door behind me and and just be in the presence of God don't you realize you can do that tonight don't you realize that's what we're here for that we can walk into the presence of the almighty God and shut the door behind us and I'm going to forget about my work I'm gonna forget about my family everything else and I'm just gonna Lord speak to me tonight let me be in your presence let me worship you amen oh it's hard but let's just let's just enter in for a minute it's the same Jehovah that stood back there and said let there be there was word was made manifest when he was made Flesh on Earth he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied it but now in the last days when he comes down among us again the same light that moved down and said let there be light see he he just speak the creation into existence is it greater than this will you do for I go to my father remember we're at these times now you see those Greater Works well that was for brother Branham what brother Branham said I read it to you Sunday when the bride realizes that she can do the Greater Works go look it up I'm not changing that when the bride realized she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army because she can do Hallelujah she can do the Greater Works which means that the power of the spoken word will be in her again we're we're you're thinking up here you're not realizing what God's already doing in your life in this day Acts 16-31 look here's another promise what attitude do we have towards this they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thou should be saved in thy house I want to challenge you tonight what attitude do you take towards acts 16 and 31 right now whatever you have need of or God is able to provide it how many believe that tonight there's a story uh that brother Branham he begins to tell and he's had a house and and he's talking to some friends of his and and they're sitting in the living room and at the table sits the brother right and and and a couple of other brothers and over here sitsa how do you write somebody's car is going off and over here is happy right it's all right the battery will run down after a while but don't everybody try it once but on one side was on one side was Hattie Wright and on the other side on the other side was uh was Edith her sister that was you remember the story her sister that was sick and so you've got a you've got a situation where uh you've got a situation where they're seated in the living room and and the prophet is talking he's just telling stories and what the first story that he tells is about Jehovah Jireh he said that when Abraham was up in the in the mountains said there was a there was a he needed a ram because he God had told him to sacrifice his only son and he knew his son would have to be the the his seed that was only that was the promise God gave him so there had to be a something offered in his Stead and so we provided something a ram where there could be nothing right everybody's still with me now so he provided a ram when when there could be nothing there in a place where there could be no RAM and so brother random relation he says I was in the woods he said and there was a uh there was a squirrel he said God spoke to me and talked to me about these scriptures and there was no squirrels there and I was in a sycamore Thicket I believe that he said a place where there would be no squirrels and he said I I was sitting there and he said all of a sudden there was one and he shot it and he told the story and when he got done telling the story or as he was telling the story sister Hattie sitting over by the wall in the living room and she makes a statement she said that's nothing but the truth all right you've all heard the story and I'd have love to admit sister Hattie and ask her exactly how that went down but the random relates it a few times the brother Bill told me he met sister Hattie Wright some of you kids these sound like really old stories brother Bill met sister Hattie right and and she was a real woman that lived and and she was a poor woman but now when she said that all of a sudden brother Brown talked about that presence of God dropping in on him and I could read you the quotes we don't have time tonight that presence of God dropped in on him he began to he began to uh begin to tell her he said the spirit of the Lord told her tell her to ask for what she needs say what she needs and give it to her and so he tells her he says he says what do you have need of ask whatever he said whatever you ask for God will give you and she said what should I ask and he said well here's your sister that's crippled and my brother ran up at one place in that story he says that he says when she said it's nothing but the truth at the same time he said sister right her mother was trying to get Edith or trying to uh trying to relate what Edith was saying trying to translate what Edith was trying to say and so there was more than one voice in the room but he said The only voice that I heard was hers well look it up I believe God hears our Voice tonight I believe he hears your voice so he they're they're sitting there around the table she says it's nothing but the truth he says whatever you have need of and he said here's your sister sitting here that's been sick all over her life he said if you speak she'll be well here here you need money you don't have any money and you're you're trying to make it as a widow he said he said to you and oh my yeah you could have money you could speak it it would be there a new home a new car whatever it would be but brother random taught us that God chose her because she would ask for the right thing and the right thing was the salvation of her children he said we're standing over in the corner laughing at what he was saying Oh my he said they've gotten to be about 15 16 years old and they were standing there Snicker and laughing about what he had to say and as they were standing there he said and she said I want the salvation of my children and when he and he responded I give them to you in the name of the Lord and immediately they fell down and began to repent what was that right that was God keeping his word and and now but watch watch what it was it was her attitude and her approach to the prophet it was her saying the right thing right and again you might say well it's just for brother random look what brother Brandon says later in the sermon he tells that in first was my new ministry in 1959 and he says this he said now every one of you not only ministers but all of you ought to pray for these people he said you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else now brother Branham encouraged congregational prayer at times in the services he said he would say this he'd say God can hear you he hears he said there's millions of prayers going up all over the world he said so you pray like you do in your church I'm sure you've heard him say that you pray like you do in your church he said because God hears prayers from all over the world he hears you oh what a comforting thought that is but he would encourage people to pray together I think sometimes we need to hear our own voice even if nobody else hears it we need to hear ourselves say it's nothing but the truth we need to hear ourselves say Amen you say brother man I'm not in a manner but you need to hear it as much as I need to hear it you need to hear yourself obey the word you need it you need to see yourself obey the word you need to hear yourself amen the word so it may be just quiet and maybe all you can get out is just a boy man maybe I would never hear it but you heard yourself say it he said it's nothing but the truth and somehow in the confusion of that room the prophet of God heard her yeah oh God so now but he said he said you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else what if you'd say the right thing he said here's a woman standing here that's so sick to have to hold her up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like Bank said the right thing like caddy said the right thing when we gather together so what if our prayer could be the say the right thing for brother JT or one of these other people that are sick or in need what if our prayer could be the right thing for our children that they would come home reach oh you hearing me tonight what if you would say you say brother brother Ben I'm not much of a prayer Warrior but if you can just get those those sounds out the words that he can put them together it's like the little boy was praying his ABCs he said I believe God can put it together then what if your prayer would be the right thing what if you would say the right thing your prayer to cause God to come down and do something see this is just not one person this is the Church of the Living God everybody oh my God what about our attitude towards this promise and I trust me it all goes together in some way or another first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds and meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord what is our attitude towards that promise what do we preach on Sunday this message was a Rapture message so our attitude towards that scripture is our attitude towards the message of the hour brother Branham ties this spoken word Hattie right ties it over to the rapture and he said Jesus said say to this mountain and you've heard about what's been taken place that's the ministry we're entering into we're way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go say well that's concerns me brother Ben I'm not sure but he said but don't worry it'll be there I love that there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle there will be a people that will that will grab a hold of Faith at the right time and you might sit there brother Ben I don't even have faith for nothing right now but listen at the right time if you're the bride God will give it to you yeah somehow you'll have the faith to speak you'll have a part in that now I want to ask then as I've come a long ways and I'm almost out of time but I want to quickly go into this what kind of an attitude did the woman with the blood disease Martha and Hattie Wright have in common there's an attitude of humble expectation humble expectation they did not approach the word with an attitude of entitlement God you owe this to me brother Brandon talks about the Spanish people and and he says you're humble you're willing to eat or just take the crumbs whatever he said you come in that attitude that's the reason you get healed that's the reason you're healed because you come humble anyone who comes stiff-necked will never receive nothing from God say God help me to come humble he said you've got to see how low you can get and then Christ will heal you that's right or he will save you that was in 1948 again in 1961 brother Brandon says I just he said I'm trying to dodge an issue here I'm going to say it he said my last meeting at Tucson Arizona three or four nights ago I seen the white people come in there starchy Pentecostal starchy as they could be I've seen some poor old Mexicans comes in there they was there that morning when I spoke at the morning service he said they sit right in that church all day long from nine o'clock about the morning until eight o'clock about seven o'clock or eight when they come in they sit and stayed right around in that church until that evening and when it come time when the Holy Spirit dropped in among the building who got healed said the Spanish the Mexicans the Holy Spirit going right out through the audience and raising up the sick and Afflicted and everything like that bringing around Spanish humble now this isn't racism I I think we're all Americans here tonight yeah we're pretty American but if we could come humbly in spite of our americanness said come expect the world just look at I've related to you many times how the people come and how they approach the meeting overseas and what a difference it makes in the services brother random and we talked about the Germans and the Swiss and he's over in Germany or in Switzerland actually preaching and he said I noticed a Swiss he said the Swiss never had no trouble they're like Americans fined fed praise God I said my just as cocky said if you'll excuse the expression we are so-and-so we are the swing lights we're Lutheran we don't have to listen to that stuff and then poor old Germans all beat down so we counted 180 busloads them big glass top buffaloes come into where there's about 50 000 gathered together there in the big arena this was less than 10 years after World War II you can imagine their cities were destroyed their lives were destroyed their government was upending millions of them were killed and not only that the Christians themselves have been persecuted under Hitler the Evangelical Christians had just been he tried to destroy him put in death camps and everything else and go read about ones that stood against him and and some of the things that went on during that time it was a terrible time for the church they'd have probably told you it was the end times they didn't probably told you it was Armageddon because that's what it felt like to them but they've been through that and it produced a humility in their life he said what happened he said when the Holy Spirit began to fall everyone out there was the Germans that he called oh my left them sitting right where they were sitting talking about the Swiss still in their sickness still in their sin set right there and healed the Germans that come with expectations and arms out he said they'd been beat down to a place them Christians up there under Hitler and them had been beat to a place so they had to look to God for mercy he said oh God knows how to do things he said friends watch don't let it be you you come with expectations be ready lay aside every little weight that so easily beset you and come humble in heart expecting God to keep his word and he will do it amen I mean believe that tonight when we come with a arrogance don't get nothing from God that's just the truth first Peter five and six listen to how Peter puts it humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him so it's humility with expectation one doesn't work without the other humility with Biblical hope which is expectation casting all your care upon him for heareth for you Martha met him look at her attitude she went up there looked like she had a right to upgrade him she had a right to get mad at the preacher right because brother Brown said when he found out last the Lord told him that Lazarus was going to get sick he left said when the father told you to go look it up when the father told Jesus that last was going to get sick Jesus left and he was gone the whole time he was sick they didn't know where he went until they sent somebody to find him but now look at her attitude and he didn't come back until he was already dead and she went up there looked like she had a right to raid him but she didn't if she would the story would never have been told she fell down at his feet she said Lord that's what he was if thou would have been here my brother would not have died see but I know now yet he's dead four days the skin worms is done crawling in the nose has fell in if you'd have been here my brother would not have died but even now how many believe that tonight no matter what situation you're in no matter how bad it looks no matter no matter how rough it may seem even now even now even at my age even even in my situation even in my with my trouble even with my family even now oh hope we can grab a hold of that tonight even now you could do it Lord even now anything is possible even now everything's gonna be okay hey man if you'd have been there my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you that's the way to come he said see humble so it's humble expectation we just see the same attitude and approach with another woman that brother Brown sometimes uses in the same situation that's a gentile woman or the sour Phoenician woman and she come to Jesus and ask for healing for her daughter she's not even asking for herself and Jesus said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs it's not appropriate for me to heal your daughter and she comes back and says that's the truth Lord but the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table and you say well that I I don't want to be no little dog hey go ask our dog how that life is pretty good he just sits there and eats the crumbs that fall from the master's table and he runs around he that little thing's as fat as he can be why because all he he don't have to hope for himself he don't have to go out and Chase a rabbit dog we got a rabbit dog and a rabbit that's our two pets and and he he might have to hunt for a living he might have to if you set him out he said let him go free he'd die but when he can eat the crumbs from the master's table he's all right oh I'd rather be eating the crumbs from the master's table than to be the biggest dog in the bunch are you with me now he'd rather be there than the best kennel in the country amen listen she didn't say she didn't say you have to come down to my house and lay your hands on my child she didn't say if you would come down and speak in another language out yonder tell me all about it I'll believe it listen we got to be careful what we how we approach God I know sometimes we approach him as if well the Lord better speak to me if he doesn't speak to me if he doesn't directly speak to me in a way that says Ben this is you wake up then that he didn't do his job no God is already spoken maybe he's waiting on us to listen she didn't say if you'll come down and speak in another language tell me all about it I'll believe it she said I only want the crumbs just the awful it's all I'm looking for see she had the right approach she had the right approach to God's gift she was the first Gentile that Jesus ever done a miracle on faith always admits the word is right and Faith always acts humble we believe that tonight but it's humility with expectations see you've got to expect God to do what he does the woman with the blood issue was expecting he said If She Could Touch the Hem of His Garment it was over when she touched the Hem of His Garment her expectations were fulfilled if you come tonight expecting to be healed you're going to be healed if you come tonight expecting to find something to criticize the meeting you'll certainly find it you get what you come for again the woman that touched him of His Garment was expecting God to keep his word Martha was expecting God to keep his word when he said I am the resurrection of life and yet we think about this and then the more you think about it because in our sense when we think about being humble and we begin to think about who we are and what we deserve which isn't much and we begin to think well I'm not worthy how many have ever thought that I'm not worthy to come to God I'm not worthy to go into the throne room brother Ben when you talked about the going into the inner chamber to the holy of holies I wouldn't go in I'd be afraid I'd Die well that's right you wouldn't go in by yourself but look what it says give me that that next slide look what it says in Hebrews in Hebrews 4 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession verse 15 for we have nodded high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities oh thank God but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin we are not worthy but he is we failed but he stood the test we we have failed many times to do what we ought to do but if we come humbly before him we can also come boldly before him look what he says verse 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need that word boldly is with confidence come with humble confidence humble expectation to one who has been through the same temptations that we've been through and he did not fall so he stands in our place and allows us to make our petition to a high priest that can be touched oh my oh my that's what the little woman knew he could be touched and how many times did Brother Branham stand in the platform and he said what did she touch what did he touch what was he saying he was saying the physical Lord Jesus is not here so you can Touch the Hem of His Garment but by faith you touch the word and when you touch him today he is still able to heal you he's still able to reveal the secrets of your heart amen listen Abraham says our heavenly father he's praying then we bow in Humble worship to express to you the very adorations of our heart oh how we are elated tonight Lord to feel your blessings moving in our mortal beings few moments I love this humble expectation expecting in a few moments to see the vital the real presence of Jesus Christ moving among the people giving them Faith seeing great signs and wonders take place so we come humbly expecting great things you come with the right approach you're able to get what you asked for right Jesus even said that the woman who didn't deserve remember the unjust judge and the woman he didn't give it to her because of the merits of her case she come knocking she bothered him so much that he gave it to her God is Not unjust and we are not a widow woman we are married to Christ the word are you with me now but Jesus uses that extreme example he said even the widow woman come knocking and the judge just gave it to her because she come with the right approach so we come expecting great things I was in the fellowship Paul Sunday and Elaine's not here tonight my niece and she come up behind me and I'm sitting there talking to somebody she come up behind me and said Uncle Ben can I have two dollars and I took out my wallet and I got two dollars out and I put it over my shoulder I gave it to her and she walked away and about five minutes later it occurred to me she was not my child oh all right should come with confidence right so humbly it's not just well I'm afraid to ask no humble you she wasn't asking the bank see if I come brother Allen ask him I dress up a chafe right come to the bank because I know what my credit looks like so I'd come humbly you know but I would I would I dress up but I wanna but she was coming somebody she knew so she could come boldly yeah you come I heard a story y'all forgive me I heard a story the other day on the radio and this guy said that he had been counseling some people financially and and they said they had a they had a uh a 1200 car payment on 2600 of income he said well the first thing you do is you need to get rid of the car he said why can't the lord gave me the car he said well he said how do you know the lord gave you the car he said because he said the finance manager told me it was a miracle that I got approved right lord gave me the car well I want you to I want you to think spiritually now when you come before God your credit is good with God you're not coming before the bank you're coming before your father you're coming for somebody you have a relationship with you're coming before somebody that all you have to do is ask and he'll give it to you and you wouldn't ask for nothing you shouldn't have because you've got the right attitude if you don't you need to get the right attitude so you come home humbly expecting great things a woman one time pressed to the crowd and touched His Garment and felt within herself that she was healed and went out and sat in the crowd Jesus said who touched me Peter rebuked him but he said I perceive that virtue of strength has gone from me he looked around over the audience until he found the little woman until she told us she had a blood issue and her face had saved her is that right he said well now if he's the same high priest wouldn't he do the same thing tonight if he'd be touched he said now how would he do it he's Divine now we are the branches is that right he said well then he'd act through the branch if it's a correct oh my if it's a correct Branch out of the vine it'd act the same way the life was in the vine is that right he said now you pray you believe and then he said I pray I believe so that's both ends working together you pray you believe I pray I believe and upon the stand that I've taken for God around this world he said in this ministry of discernment is now leaving you realize brother Branham was taking a step up I don't know there's people ever since then there's been a Pentecostal movement that's tried to impersonate that gift but brother random was moving was taking even a step higher although he said that gift would always be with him because he was a prophet but in his ministry he was taking a step up what was it into the opening of the word amen and the spoken word identified that as the opening of the word I hope you I hope you get it tonight he said the ministry of discernment is now leaving and I'm stepping into a higher Ministry of speaking the word and you see what God has done he's put it right back in the lap of the people let them come with the right approach and watch what happens I say to you in the name of the Lord tonight according to the word of God if you come to with the right approach I believe we are one of the branches on the vine we are not Divine but we are the branches if you come with the right approach God will heal you God will save you but he put it right back in your lap he said let them come with the right approach and watch what happens but they've got to have the right approach see no one can heal he's the Healer but I cannot say it until he speaks to me see but you can speak now how do you believe it tonight church I'm ready to close but listen you can speak now with your faith and get your healing if you believe but you do that you've got to come humbly and with expectation expecting God to do something let's use one more example as the musicians come tonight Centurion Matthew 8 8. Jesus you come to Jesus and ask if he'd heal his his servant and Jesus said yeah I'll go and he answered back the Lord I'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof see humility right humility isn't it something a Roman Centurion that probably had the biggest house in the place he a centurion was a great man in that time head of a hundred soldiers he was a Roman citizen he would have been a man that had wealth and power and influence he was a man who carried a staff that allowed him to even beat up on Roman citizens he had that much power and and he stood there oh my when Jesus went to Simon Pharisees house they didn't even wash his feet when he went in they didn't even care that he was there but the Centurion said you're I'm not even worthy that you come to my house but speak the word expectation speak the word only said you don't have to speak it loudly you don't have to you don't have to say it in a certain tone of voice it don't have to be during Wednesday or Sunday service it doesn't just speak it don't you realize the age that we live in speak the word only and my servant shall be healed what are we waiting on for the Rapture the word has already been spoken it's our attitude towards that and by taking him at his word when the time comes we'll go home by taking him at his word when the time comes for healing will be healed by taking him at his word when the time comes amen he said well when is the time believe for it now believe for right now and when you believe for it now it won't matter if it's 25 years from now brother Joe well it'll come to pass humble EX expectation that God will fulfill if you've heard don't come casually we'll come to God casually don't teach your children that don't come lackadaisical don't come just well I'll take it or leave it that's not how we come to God we come to God with all of our heart our body our soul our mind he said love the Lord God that's all we can do we can't make it happen we can't save ourselves I can't there's nothing I can do to make myself a Christian but I can come to God in the right way and oh my my brother brother Mark if I come to God in the right way I believe even if I wasn't on the Lamb's Book of Life if I come to him the right way I'd be like that Gentile woman that I come to him in such a way that I said Lord I'm not going to accept no for an answer I'm going to come to you and I'm not going to I'm not gonna be disappointed I'm not going to let anybody talk me out of it even if my name was not on the Lamb's Book of Life I believe somehow I'd make it into heaven because I come to you in the right way because I know there will be some there like that but I believe it's much more than that I believe I am the elect bride of Jesus Christ I believe I am his child so I can come boldly Before the Throne of God but believing whatever he has for me I can receive it is that your is that your statement of faith tonight I believe I can receive it my motives are right my objectives are right I'm coming before God with the right in the right atmosphere with the right attitude with the right approach then you can have anything you ask for that's the end times that we're living in today him let's stand together let's stand together why don't you raise your hands to him why don't you raise your hands to him and just begin to talk to him you need to hear your own voice say it you talk to him and say Lord whatever I have need of Lord whatever this situation is I believe you're going to meet that need tonight tonight is the night I believe it's going to be over things are going to be different and things are things that look impossible I believe you can do it Lord I come humbly Before the Throne of God but I come boldly expecting you to work your a miracle in my life oh God now let him hear your voice let him hear your words they don't have to be loud but let him hear you say it Lord I believe whatever you have need if you're back sitting on God if you're cold grab a hold of the fire of God tonight grab a hold of it and Lord I'll do my part I'm trusting you to do your part refill me with the Holy Ghost help me Lord help me Lord help me to do what's right I believe you will Heavenly Father Lord we come boldly before your throne Lord I've got needs in my own life Lord so my hands are raised tonight and I'm believing oh God that you're going to do what you promised you would do I get excited about it Lord but it's not about the excitement it's the promise of your word you promised you would do it Lord and we're believing it today Lord we come with the right attitude oh God we come humbly before you Lord we come boldly we come confident oh God we come with expectation you're going to do what you promised you would do and we are the bride we are the children of God oh God we ask that our joy may be full we ask for our children we ask for our families we ask for our finances we ask for our healing oh God lord I ask you for brother J.T Lord I somehow the right word will be said maybe it won't be me maybe it'll be one of these other people Lord that'll Speak Lord you've already done a miracle and helped him Lord I believe you're going to continue to work oh God I asked for each one of these that are sick Lord or in need some unable to be here some Lord that maybe they're their soul is slipping back into the world or something's going on that we don't even know about but God may you arrest them tonight or may you grab a hold of their lives may you just begin to warm them Lord may you not let them rest until they receive that place they get to that place they ought to be in you I pray you granted Lord God oh how we need you tonight we couldn't make it without you let us go in Lord let us go in boldly behind
