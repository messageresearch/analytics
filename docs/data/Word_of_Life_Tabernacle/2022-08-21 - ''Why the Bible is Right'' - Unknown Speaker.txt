are you ready for the word of the lord this morning did you come expecting i heard it said one time there was a soup line and there was some people coming and they had to bring their own bowl for the soup line and they'd fill up the bowl that the person brought this person come through had a little bowl they filled it up next person come through had a great big bowl filled it up person turned around said why did he get more than me because he come with a bigger bowl so this morning if you come with a big bull i believe we can be filled this morning you believe it amen he became me aren't you thankful for so that i might become in my brain [Music] so that i might become [Music] and he took my place so that i threw his love good days and we became so that i [Music] thank you lord so that i might be come here by grace [Music] so that i might become him by grace he took my place [Music] took my place [Music] oh yes he became me so that i might become in my grace [Music] heavenly father we're so grateful that you became us that we might become you lord we want to walk fully into that promise today lord we so badly want to be able to walk like you walked and talk like you talked we're so grateful lord that you left us a word not only a letter lord but a spirit lord that allows us to live and to walk and to do the things that you would have us to do lord and when we fall when we fail your mercy is there to catch us lord to lift us up and bring us into that perfect place or the way you saw us before the foundation of the earth we're so grateful for that today lord i pray if there's one sick here this morning that you would heal their body lord if there's a backside or here or a sinner i pray god that you'd help them lord and you bring them close to the cross lord that you bring them to that place that image that you have lord of them lord bring us all closer to you changes god so we can be better than when we came in we ask in jesus name amen amen hallelujah such a sweet spirit in here this morning thank the lord for the music i'm thankful for brother joel he's gonna gonna take him a while to get down there this morning he uh fell this week off about 18 feet off of a ladder and landed on his feet like a cat but he uh i couldn't believe he would go ahead and lead singing today he's going to try to preach this afternoon so we're thankful that it wasn't worse the lord had his hand of protection on brother joel i'm thankful for that and i didn't get to hear the prayer requests but we're going to be reading out of second timothy chapter 3 verses 14 through 17. ii timothy 3 14. but uh i don't i didn't get to hear the prayer request but uh we went to see sister fritz this week and uh she is uh much much better in fact they're going to release it from the hospital today and uh brother jt and them are there with her they're going to bring her home the lord willing today and so we thank god for that and god is no respecter of age i've seen him heal over and over again even even our elderly believers and folks in the church and then sister jean brother robert stayed home with her this morning uh we thought she was passing last sunday and i went up there and sister jean's a fighter she's a warrior and every time she gets real low and to the point where medically that you wouldn't think she'd make it and she always gets back up and so there's a reason for that and we're thankful she's still here still with us and be praying continuing to pray for that family amen first or second timothy chapter 3 and verse 14 but continue thou and the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise into salvation through faith which is in christ jesus verse 16 is very important for us it says all scripture is given by inspiration and we've heard it many times that's the god breathe it's the expiration of god that word is god breathed his own word all scripture is given by inspiration of god is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning good to have each and every one of you with us today good to have for the white camp back with us we've been praying for your dad as well and we'll talk to you later about that and praying that he's doing okay good to have all of you with us and those that are missing today some are on vacation we miss them today but i'm sure they'll be watching i'm thankful that we have the ability to do that how to stream the services that they can watch i know you're a traveling church you've been traveling all summer and so i'm thankful that people are able to watch the services to keep up amen i believe god's doing something for us and and we're thankful for all of you i want you to be a part of it we've been talking about faith and we must have a foundation for faith there's got to be something i'm going to get real simple on you this morning but i think it'll be good for us there's got to be something that we base our faith on and we could say it this way that faith is not based on anything but what god said it's not based on anything but what god said and we've talked before how the uh the absolute is what god said right it's what god said what has god said and that is our absolute and faith is based on that we found that abraham believed god it was imputed in him for righteousness he believed god that was faith he he grabbed a hold of something he heard the voice of god and then he believed that that was god that spoke and then his words or his works rather showed that he believed that and and so we find that if you don't know what god has said you can't know how to please god how many want to please him this morning that should be all of our desire we want to please god we want to make him happy we we we want to not only to have a god that well god will forgive me but we want to please god and in order to please him we have to know how to please him how are we going to do that with our limited knowledge we cannot find what we need to find out by human reasoning or knowledge or scientific reasoning but we've got to be able and investigation won't get it for us but we've got to be able to actually hear from god himself how are we going to hear from god we've got to know what he said right how are we going to hear from him well he's we hear from him by his word which is the scriptures do we believe that today this is how we learn how to please god because if you don't know how to please him and or if it doesn't matter you might as well eat drink and be merry there's no reason to go to church or live for god unless you unless there's something to tell you well that's what you're doing has some fruit to it that's some there's going to be some beneficial fruit of it and so we believe that the bible is the foundation for all of our faith now uh i like the way john wesley put this he said he said i'm a creature of a day passing through life as an arrow through the air i'm a spirit coming from god and returning to god just hovering over the great gulf a few months hence i am no more seen i drop into an unchangeable eternity i want to know one thing the way to heaven oh my is that what you want to know today i want to make it i want to know how to get to heaven how will i know how to get to heaven he said god himself has condescended to teach the way he hath written it down in a book oh my he hath written it down in a book and wesley said this he said oh give me that book at any price give me the book of god if this is how i please god if this is his words to me give me that book let me let me count it as precious i think today we handle it too lightly many times give me that book let me take the scripture in whatever form it's in if it's on my ipad if it's in in the book form like this if it's on a phone let me handle it as the precious word of god let me handle it as the thoughts of god that allow me to live the word of god that allow me to be a message believer in my day i wouldn't have that unless i had a foundation and this is the foundation of all of our faith and that's why every false doctrine everything that comes against the word it always comes because there's no foundation of the scripture it don't go back to the scripture we've got to correct ourselves by the word all scripture is given by the exploration of god god breathed it so we could be corrected so we could be reproved so we can be built up oh do you believe that today oh we ought to love our bibles i'm more than a baptist or methodist nothing against those people i'm sure many of them are sincere we ought to love of all people we ought to love the bible give me that book and so we find then the bible is the old testament and the new testament it's written in two parts the old testament was a cloudy view it was types and symbols and the new testament was a more sure word of prophecy peter says it this way in second peter 1 16 he said we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount and he said we have also a more sure word of prophecy so he said the fact that we saw god manifest his own word in his son right this oh my the fact that god manifested his word in a body of flesh gives us a more sure word of prophecy then the old testament prophets had that any believer at the new testament could look at it and see things that the old testament didn't reveal you understand that's why jesus said john the baptist was the greatest man born among women he said but even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he why because we're able to stand on the shoulders of those prophets and look beyond look farther even than what they could see he said and it's like a light he said shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation so in other words he's saying we i didn't have a right to tell you that jesus was the messiah just because i dreamed it up just because i decided it was so but god came from heaven and proved yes that he was the messiah we have a more sure word of prophecy god came and vindicated that he was oh could you bring that now to the message of the hour and see what how we're living in we have a more sure word of prophecy what the bible says god vindicated it in a ministry but he didn't only vindicate it in the ministry of william branham but he vindicates it in his pride today we have a more sure word of prophecy god becoming flesh the word walking in shoe leather are you with me this morning and so it's not of any private interpretation not for anybody to say well this is it or that's it but what has god done let us see what god has done let's find out what god's doing amen i believe he's doing something in this hour that's why i refuse to bow to doom and gloom about the church or about the bribe or about what god's doing in this age i refuse to preach a gospel of doom and gloom and despair but i believe that there's a bride on the earth who's doing exactly what god said they would do i believe there's a people you're a part of it this morning i believe we can see healing we can see salvation we can feel the power of god we can move in the mind of god and know what god wants us to do why because we're the bride we're not looking for one to come we're not waiting on a more sure word of prophecy we have a more sure word of prophecy we've seen the light of the hour the message of the hour it's not a private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost they were moved to speak now watch i like if you'll excuse me for just a moment i like adam clark's commentary on this he said the prophecy came not an old time in any former time with the will of man man's own searching conjecture calculation but holy men of god persons separated from the world devoted to god's service spake moved by the holy ghost so far were they from inventing these prophetic declarations concerning christ or any future event that they were he uses the greek word moved carried away that's what that word means they were carried away so they could not speak it themselves but they were so in the spirit of god that they were carried away by the vision carried away by the word that they spoke they were carried away they were moved out of themselves and out of the whole region as it were of human knowledge and conjecture by the holy ghost who without their knowing anything of the matter dictated to them what to speak what to write and so far above their knowledge were the words of prophecy that they did not even know the intent of those words but search what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow let's read that first peter 1 10. listen peter's talking about this more sure word of prophecy this salvation that we've received he said which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently look they prophesied it they spoke of it and yet they looked for it they tried to find out what they were saying god i didn't even know it but we know it why god manifested his word by bringing it to pass so they searched for it who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching water what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow he said unto whom it was revealed not unto themselves oh i love this so he said they searched and then it was revealed to them that they didn't say this for themselves it was not to themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into the prophets looked at it and couldn't see it the angels looked at it and couldn't see it but when the time came god interpreted his word by bringing it to pass look the prophets didn't know malachi when he said when he said behold i send you elijah the prophet i send you elijah the prophet he did not know what he was talking about in its fullness you understand he said it and it becomes scripture it was the word of god angels looked at it prophets looked at it people ministered down to the ages and looked at it but one day god brought his word to pass yes oh don't you believe a god who could do that would bring his word to pass in your life the prophet said they said i am the lord thy god that healeth peace i'm the god that heals all thy diseases they may not have known about cancer and about covet and about all these things but you know the reality of it because you serve a god who has healed you from those things you serve a god who's brought his word to pass and don't you realize today you've got to have that you've got to have that you've got to have a god who can bring these things to pass not a god who's only a theory not a god who's only in your mind or in your head but you need a god who has brought these things to pass in your life and it gives you a confidence i've been young and i now i'm old but i've never seen the seed forsaken i've never seen them begging bread i know god's taking care of me i know god's a healer i know that what the bible said is true why because he's brought it to pass in my life i know he forgives of sin oh can you say amen to that this morning i know he's a forgiver i know he has mercy why he had mercy for me i know he loves me he loves me because i feel his love for me i know that he's a healer because he's healed me hallelujah oh my oh you're easy to preach to this morning i'm about to slow down hallelujah they ministered those things to us we'll see the example of david prophesying of christ had no idea what he was saying he said my god my god why has self-forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring he thought he was talking about himself psalms 22 14 i am poured out like water all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a pot shirt my tongue cleaveth to my jaws that has brought me into the dust of death dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet and he had no idea what they were talking about what he was talking about i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they park my garments among them cast offs upon my vesture brother branham brings it up into the crucifixion and he says the very day that they were singing the psalm the 22nd psalm that's what they're saying at passover time they sang the 22nd psalm the very day that they did that my god my god why has that forsaken me all my bones they stare at me not one bone should be broken the very song that they were repeating in the temple there hung the sacrifice screaming the very words that david said 800 years before but they were too blind to see it oh god open our eyes today open our eyes today that we can see the word of the hour when it manifests itself they were too blind to see it he said today the very god that spoke of this age oh he's bringing it down to our day now he said he's on the scene doing exactly what he said he would do and they're too blind to see it he said that's unbelievers listen to me they didn't see that god was manifesting himself in a son of man ministry and there's many today that can't see that god has clothed himself in his bride that he's wrapped himself in his bride they can't see it but it don't make it not true it just means that they can't believe they don't have the capacity to believe but you believe this morning why do you believe because there's a seed down on the inside that makes you believe oh god open blinded eyes today to see where god is he's with us right now he's in us right now doing his work the very god that spoke of this age is on the scene doing exactly what he said he would do they're too blind to see it they walk out and say oh i can't believe stuff like that i never heard of that in my life it don't make any difference what you heard amen the bible said it would be here and it's his word listen they read the original scrolls of psalms and i just want to bring this down today where even our children could understand because you're going to hear that the bible is not accurate in its present form you're going to hear well it was translated and it was all this was done to it it's been messed with and you're going to hear that you can't have confidence in it but i want you to understand i want you to have confidence in the scriptures it's one thing and we want our children to learn the scriptures that's something that we stress that children should learn as parents we need to teach our children the scripture teach them the scripture behind everything we do at church there's something scriptural to back it up you understand that everything we do is a teaching opportunity for our children why do we get baptized why do we come to church early how do we sit in the presence of god why do we do all of this why why why does the preacher come back out like what he does and how do we give the the main focus on the word all of those things come from scripture and then a prophet came and shed light shine light on that right but we can take our children back to the scripture and i want to give you a foundation for this why do we believe in in predestination why do we what about the serpents see what about these things once they reach a certain age they begin to wonder about these things we should be able to take them to the scripture and show this is a this is the word of god and i want you kids to have confidence today i want you young people to have confidence today in the word of god if i live my life according to the word i'm going to make it it won't matter how i feel it won't matter what comes in front of me it won't matter what the unbelievers say the word of god is still true do you believe that today amen and so now but they were singing the very songs that had been the the from the scrolls that had been carefully copied word for word so much so that if they ever made one mistake in penmanship they would throw the whole thing away that's how careful they were about copying the words of moses and the and the psalms and the songs that they had and the different prophets that were written down they they were careful to preserve the old testament scriptures they committed them to memory so that they could quote the entire torah the entire books of moses before they reached 13 years of age it was a requirement to become a man to be able to quote those things and yet they stayed right there in the temple while the word itself was being manifested on the cross even being able to quote it and knowing it line by line word by word but there was something they were missing they could not see it because they were blind the bible says they were blinded for our sakes and there was god standing there revealing that word crying my god why has south forsaken me the very songs that they were singing in the temple that david had made for them years ago pertaining to christ all my bones they stare at me they pierced my hands and my feet there they were standing there singing that and the very man dying on the cross when he died the god of heaven came down like he did on mount sinai with holy fire burnt that temple veil from top to bottom tore it apart and what could they do look right out there out of the temple window on calvary there was god in plain view the sacrifice but they don't see it yet today he said god in this last day has rent those traditions away and brought the word for this age right plain and view and they still don't see it they just don't know it it's so simple now watch god interprets his word by bringing it to pass satan interprets his by reason and we talked about that last week this is how satan interprets his word is by reason the serpent said unto the woman we shall not surely die you shall not surely die now watch he he just adds a word he just adds a word he said actually he adds the word not it says you shall surely die he adds one word it changes the entire meaning right one word change the entire meaning for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof your day shall be oh your eyes should be open you should be as gods knowing good and evil now what was he telling them he was saying okay you can't trust this and this is always how he acts what he does that serpent is still on the earth today right in spiritual form and he inspires men and women to take the word and try to remove the credibility from the word to try to get you where you don't believe the bible and then he'll try to get you where you don't believe the message or the hour just to remove the credibility from it now watch what he does he takes away the credibility of the word he tries he says you shall not surely die and so in other words he said well it was mistranslated you misunderstood he said but i have secret knowledge now he could make a claim to having secret knowledge if she really knew who she was who she was talking to it was lucifer that it inhabited the serpent you understand and he he was standing there but the one who had had inhabited the serpent the one who had taken over that body was actually the one who was with god who was created by god who was the right-hand man of god in heaven and so he could claim to have prior knowledge he could say i was right next to god i was in the inner circle and you wouldn't believe the things he told me private testimonies i'm not comparing people who tell testimonies to to to satan that's not what i'm doing but you understand you don't put confidence in that put it in the word you separate brotherhood over something somebody told somebody you told somebody told somebody it might have been asleep when the person told it you don't know we don't trust that we trust what god said i got opinions i told you last week i got opinions i got certain opinions about school certain opinions about about about things that my own children and things i'll let them do and things i want but you go back to the word don't don't go back to my opinions or or somebody else's opinion go back to the word find out what the word said and i'll tell you your attitude towards the word ought to be not not some attitude of well you know the word says it but i believe god's a merciful god now if the word says it i'll just do that well the word says it but i better try to figure out maybe he meant something different you know i know brother branham taught this about the scriptures but but maybe i i can do something a little bit different that shouldn't be our attitude at all it should not be our default position to try to find a loophole or a way out remember that's what balaam did that's what balaam did try to find a loophole maybe i can go maybe it'd be good if i do this and do that and god finally granted him that permission but we don't want the permissive will of god we want the perfect will of god hey man we don't go by loophole but we say god said it i believe it and that settles it now again you have to have understanding but the understanding has to has to fit with the entirety of scripture right the light of the age how do we know it's the light of the hour well the holy ghost witnesses it yes but we don't go by feeling but it fits through the entire scripture right and you can't take baptist doctrine through the entire scripture right you can't take methodist doctrine i know i'm being bold on that but it's a fact can't take it to the whole scripture but we as message people should not be scared of any scripture in the bible to believe it because it's true it's god's word right now again satan interprets by reason he tells us he's misunderstood it was mistranslated brother brandon said and i read this last week but i want to drop it in here and then we'll move on brother brown said faith believes that god that can make me can keep that book in the order for me to live by if the god who made me is going to judge me can't keep his book in order then he's a very poor god he said i believe every word of it is the truth shouldn't that be our attitude towards it today yes sir what does this do to believe that it gives faith a perfect resting place in it and that means or whatever else is shaken my foundation can't be shaken my faith has a perfect resting place amen listen your mom and dad might fail you your church might fail you somebody else might fail you but if your faith is found in the word of god you will always endure you're not going to be saved you might fail yourself but you will not be shaken because your faith is in the word excuse me [Applause] i believe the word i fell in love with the word you know why i fell in love with the word i fell in love with the author you ever got a love letter you didn't fall in love with the love letter but you you kept it it was precious to you why because you were in love with the author this bible is precious because i fell in love with the author one day and it's precious to me and i've kept it it means something to me oh my if we could just read that bible like that if we could treat it like that it's the word of god he said i believe every word of it to is true it gives faith a perfect resting place now watch and what did the scripture say the men who wrote the old testament were holy men of god right it said holy men of god that doesn't mean they didn't make mistakes but the bible says they were holy men of god that wrote it and what they wrote was so inspired that they didn't even know what it meant so it was holy men of god it was inspired and then what they wrote was manifested in the life of one man all of it this is so good you know i've heard it before well you just need to learn to rejoice in the little things what if you went to your wife every time and said well i saw you before it don't mean do nothing for me now you know they say as you get older your eyesight gets dimmer so you both continue to appreciate one another you know as we get older our eyes fail but you know you you learn to love one another you learn to love one another and appreciate one another you don't stand there and say well i i've seen you before i i've seen them know you love one another so it means something to when we love the word the word means something to us now watch what they wrote was manifested in the life of one person jesus christ psalms 40 and 7 said alo i come in the volume of the book or in the entirety of the book it is written of me brother branham said he is the principle theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something now that's a challenge for us that's a challenge for us if we if we don't see christ in every verse of the bible we've got to go back and read it again we missed something he said the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there is christ now in order to believe this you got to believe he's god if you believe he's a second person you can't make every scripture christ but if you believe he is god he is the word then you see christ in every verse of the bible he said the bible is christ he is the word you read in the beginning god created there is christ from that to the amen in revelation is every word testifying of jesus christ number branham goes on to say that's why the maccabees and some of these other books that you've heard about are not in the scripture because they don't fit with the theme of jesus christ you understand they may be true they get maybe historical there may be lots of good stuff in them but they don't fit with the theme amen but everything in this bible are you hearing me this morning everything in this bible brother ben you're a fanatic praise god i'm glad to be a fan of something that's a what a what a badge of honor right in the beginning now in the beginning was the word right that's the logos the word we understand that the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld its glory amen the glory says the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now put that together john 1 and 1 with john 1 14. now i went through and as i began to think about this and begin to ponder this i i just from memory i began to jot down and begin to look and see what i could see every book and i think we ought to know the books of the bible well this is so elementary brother ben but but listen to me i think sometimes we forget this is important now you may not be able to recite them from memory but you ought to know the teaching from every book in the bible because every book is important you may have never read obadiah or nahum or some of those books like that but but it's important it matters in the economy of god so now and i think that's why it's important to read the whole the whole bible but now we find i begin to think about that and begin to jot down what is it where do i see christ in every book of the old testament now think about it because he fulfilled that he was the walking word right he fulfilled every book not only every book but every verse and we don't have time to go through every verse this morning but let's just look at the at the books and see what is he in genesis he's the creator in exodus he's the deliverer in leviticus he's the lawgiver i'm just writing these things down what does it mean to me how do i see christ in every part of the scripture in numbers he is the brass serpent in deuteronomy he's a prophet like moses in joshua he is jehovah's savior in judges he's the angel giving encouragement to gideon you remember he's the angel of the lord and ruth he is the kinsman redeemer in samuel kings and chronicles he's a rejected king the true king of israel in ezra and nehemiah he's the builder oh my and see how you can bring all that back to christ in esther he's the king with a scepter you realize esther doesn't even mention god the book of esther doesn't even mention god but just the life of esther was enough to be inspired by god to be placed in the scriptures because it represents god it represents a king with a scepter it represents a bride yes amen amen and so there's so many types we can preach from esther and we can see christ in job he's the redeemer of this body he said though my though the skin worms eat that my body yet in my flesh shall i see god amen i know my redeemer lives hey man in psalms he's crucified as we read to you already they pierced my hands and my feet in proverbs and ecclesiastes he is wisdom in the song of solomon he is the bridegroom amen in isaiah he's god's servant right my righteous servant he says oh he said he was he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's a lamb going to the solder he was god's servant and isaiah in jeremiah he's the root and branch of jesse calls him the branch amen in lamentations he's a weeping prophet in ezekiel he's the wheel in the middle of the wheel hallelujah brother branham tells the story of how that when he went down when jesus goes down into the hell they were into the regions of paradise he walks down he knocks on the door and they open it up and ezekiel saw him he said there's the wheel that was in the middle of the wheel amen in daniel he's the ancient of days hallelujah in hosea he's a loving husband who will not give up glory in joel he's the restorer said i will restore the years and amos he's a roaring lion in obadiah he possesses his kingdom go back and read it he possesses his kingdom in jonah he's a resurrection glory we're going to get to that one of these days in our series on jonah he's a he's a sign of the resurrection amen in micah and nahum and habakkuk and zephaniah and haggai those minor prophets he is the righteous judge and the one who will not forget his people but we'll bring them back to the land in zechariah he's the golden lamp stand the headstone and the fountain for sin so many types of christ in the book of zechariah in malachi he's the message all right what was it he said behold i send my messenger before my face he is the message that the messenger came to bring glory brother brother said the message is christ he is the message proclaimed by the messenger no wonder he could stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled and i'm sure you could go back and look at each one of those books of the bible and find many other types many other scriptures every verse tells us who he is and what he does this day this scripture is fulfilled i wonder if we wonder what we've got if we realize what we got what we've got i wonder if we if it inspires us with all an understanding or if we've just laid it on a shelf in the new testament now watch it's the same things again what was the new testament written by holy men of god right written under inspiration manifested in a body yes not one man but a body us yes well you shout when i talk about jesus think about it oh god how's he going to prove the new testament to be true gloria in in our bodies in our mortal flesh amen when jesus came he was the word in his fullness because the whole plan of redemption laid into him the whole plan of redemption didn't lay in moses didn't land joseph didn't lay in elijah see they were only part of the word he said pointing to it therefore after him the fullness we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word and i like i love the way the editor puts this in here he said brother branham picks up his bible he said this is the complete revelation nothing can be added or taken away from it there is the complete revelation he said all that a shadow of him to come but when he come he was the perfect hebrews 1 god in sundry times spoke to the fathers to the prophets god spoke through veils the prophets but in this last day through his son jesus christ there you are unveiled out there on calvary the son of god unveiled are you still with me this morning we've got just a little more time he said notice made alive he said and today and this is a continuation of the same quote he said today when the word is manifested in human vessels veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to god being baptized into him according to first corinthians 12 we become identified with him what is it it's manifested in a body of the bride glory now watch we are living epistles walking word the fleshly veil of the unseen god the prophets were part of the old testament word but jesus was all of the word the denominations could only live that part of the word the new testament word that they saw but we can live all the word brother branham said the mysteries was in the seven seals when these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible he said the seven seals they would steal with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the someone say entire entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption now watch new testament and it goes on to explain why the old testament was a shadow but the new testament is the reality amen that's where we live today ii peter 3 14 he said wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things we look at the end time coming and that's what they were looking for in that early church and he said you look for these things he said be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the long-suffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you now watch there'll be some people who believe the old testament who will tell you the new testament isn't such isn't so inspired or somehow it's been mistranslated but now watch what he's saying he said our brother paul according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you also in all his epistles you know all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood it should make us feel better shouldn't it some things are hard to be understood i'm so glad for the light and the message of the hour he said which they that are unlearned ignorant and unstable don't they don't have no foundation he said rest rest w-r-e-s-t they wrestle with it their mind they're not sure but see faith if you go back to a fundamental foundation of faith but the rhetoric is unconscious see you don't have to think well i'm going to believe i'm going to believe i'm going to believe but you just believe in the word it's just unconscious you just say the word says it i believe that that settles it how many could say amen to that today the bible says it so it must be true right it's unconscious and so you don't have to think and build yourself up and work yourself up into it it's unconscious he said like crossing a bridge when you get to it you just expect it to hold start in your car in the morning some of us anyway expect our cars to start and sometimes they don't i've been there i know what that's like even with a newer vehicle they won't always start oh but thank god we have a word that will always work when the car won't start when the groceries when the money's not in the bank for the groceries when the kids are hungry when the people are sick when the family is all fighting and fussing with one another the word of god is still hold amen because it is christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever so he said they wrestle as they do also the other scriptures so he identifies paul's writing has scripture he said unto their own destruction it's not good to wrestle with the word you need to settle it be sure that what god said is true be positive listen to me young people listen to me young married couples be positive that what god said is true and build your life on that you're going to make mistakes but build your life on what god said right and if you build your life on what god said you're going to be able to make it and i think some of those have been decades and decades in the way and know what i'm talking about today you can you can testify to that and say i built my life on the word i made mistakes but i'm here i messed up but i'm here why because of my life there was a foundation when i hit i can't go too far to the bottom because there's the word there amen now watch you say well what about translations we got different translations and i recognize that the king james sometimes is difficult for us to understand sometimes i'll read something and have to go look it up because of that brother branham said that he said we find now in the old testament there's many words he said in our new king james version that seems very strange we called it our new king james version i don't think he was talking about the new king james version but but the king james version was a relatively new translation in history of the bible and we think of that as old now but he said that seems very strange but for me he said the rest of you brethren could teach from any version you want to he said but i like the king james just seems more like the bible to me and if you've ever read from what they call the message version of the bible then you know that king james is a pretty good translation and they've got different versions the living bible and all those things but that it's not what's important brother branham was not king james only fundamentalist he wasn't you don't find that he he went to the greek and and the different places and found some places king james don't make it he a great example of that is in st john 14. my father's house are many mansions he said my father's house are many mansions he said one translator translated in my father's apartment or many apartments and that don't seem like it makes a whole lot of sense in my father's house are many mansions but brother ram goes back and explains that in my father's house he said a house was a household in those days and my father's house are many tabernacles and it goes on in things that are to be to explain that that's our bodies right our word bodies and so we realized then that that that new testament or that king james version rather there's things there that you have to work to understand but it's still every bit the truth right right now i like it for the same reason that he did there would be nothing wrong with reading from a different translation i like it because it sounds like the bible all of these and therefores and vows i like that because it just to me it sounds like the bible i just love the majesty of how it's written but brother branham goes into this discussion in the church age book of greek verses arab aramaic aramaic was the language of the common people probably the language that jesus spoke in most of the time because hebrew had gone out of fashion hebrew was spoken by the scholars of that day so some people believe that the bible the new testament was written first in aramaic and then translated into greek but most believe that it was written first in greek but now it was dr lomsa who made that famous brother brandon was a personal friend of his he wrote a bible called the loss of bible he said and he believed it was from aramaic he said however before we get too concerned about this he said let us read both the king james version and the translation by dr lomsa to our gratification we find the words in both amazingly the same so that there's no difference actually in content or doctrine i'm ringing a little bit up here there's no difference in content or doctrine now watch you know why he could say that he wasn't looking at it like a legal document it was looking at the theme of it it still presents christ there may be some things better translated in the aramaic some things better translated in the greek but it has the same content the same doctrine he said we may even conclude that god has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications have already known scripts to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we already had and we find that though translators may fight each other scripts do not hallelujah and so many times the reason we think that there's a problem is because we're reading it wrong i don't know that any of you do that i'm just preaching on a level where we could all just kind of build from this morning and so the people but you watch the devil try to talk you out of it if there's something you know you should do and your flesh don't want to do it you think your flesh is above trying to get you to believe the bible's been mistranslated well i've been in a message for 50 years but you think satan won't try that if he can on you right sure if that's a weakness if you're a if you're a type of guy that's educated and you kind of you like to study and you like to do those things or a woman who likes to think and about these things and get into the word and the devil will try to use that against you to try to get you to think well it's been mistranslated there's something wrong with it but see it's because you're reading it wrong in the first place you don't read the bible like a legal document or a newspaper but in nehemiah 8 and 8 it says that the priest gave the sense read the law of god distinctly he gave the sins caused him to understand the reading it wasn't read like a legal document luke 10 and 21 in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent has to reveal them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight and so he taught us read between the lines right and and that's something that other men have said as well i there's an illustration a mortimer adler wrote a book called how to read a book of course the people who needed to know how to read a book never read it but he wrote a book called how to read a book in that book he observed that the one time people read for all their worth is when they're in love and they're reading a love letter they read every word three ways they read between the lines and in the margins they read the whole in terms of the parts each part in terms of the whole they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity you know they begin to read what is he really saying here what's he saying here they perceive the color of words the order of phrases the weight of sentences they may even take the punctuation into account he said then if never before after they read carefully and in depth why because they're in love and they want to know what the what the author said oh church that ought to be us today we want to know what the author's saying let's read in depth let's look over it let's get into it let's find out what a prophet said about it let's read about it it's a love letter to us amen but the brown said that's the way you know this love book of gods amen this love book of gods he said the reason it's so complicated to people you're not in love with christ you say it contradicts itself and all this you're just not in love with the author that's all it's a love letter it's a love letter oh it's to be read by somebody who's in love and there ain't nobody on the earth in love with him but his bride are you with me today they're not in love with him they're in love with what they think he is but we're in love with him who is the word amen revelation only comes from the author itself first corinthians two and nine as it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him i may be going too fast here but you just write it down and go back or go back and listen to it or go and listen to some of the sermons brother branham preached about it he said but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things gave the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god no man knows the things of god but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god we might know the things that are freely given to us of god so it's not a dead letter we're reading it with the spirit he said which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth or in other words not the things that man says makes sense not men's reasoning not the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual it's very important you don't compare spiritual things with carnal things you don't run the church like a business right you you don't you don't compare spiritual things with carnal things spiritual things are compared with spiritual things but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god but they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so you got to be born again in order to fall in love with the author so you can read the book right are you with me this morning and when you have that revelation when you are born again of the spirit of god this book will line up from genesis to revelation and then the message which is the light on those scriptures not satan's false sight but god's promised life will begin to shine and it'll begin to make known unto you what god said listen revelation 10 and 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets in other words as it is written in the scriptures he said zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day in or night but it shall come to pass at evening time it shall be light not it shall be more word or a different book but it shall be light light on the scripture amen amen now we're going to get serious here because i'm out of time this isn't just any book don't mess with it i need to turn around and tell myself that don't mess with it life or death you can pull things out of there and hold people by fear destroy their lives huh you can take you can take the message out or do the same thing ruin people with it don't mess with it don't add to it that's what the devil did revelation 22 18 for i testify to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life this is someone who had been a believer and had somehow gotten in his name was in the book of life was not bright you can't have taken your name taken off the lamb's book of life that part of the book of life which is reserved to the elect but but here is someone who had their name taken out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book you know what the the hard part to me brother joel is not what he says he'll take his name out of the book of life but that means that he'll have his name taken out of the holy city and he won't get to experience the the new city then he won't get to experience the wonders of heaven why because he messed with the book oh god jonathan edwards shook this nation preaching a sermon called sinners in the hands of an angry god he took his text from deuteronomy 32 and 35 he said to me belong with vengeance and recompense and he highlighted these words their foot shall slide in due time he said for the day of their calamities at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste today the bible is mocked ridiculed torn apart manhandled don't put your hands on it it's the word god's word their foot shall sight in due time in other words he said you're walking he said if you're if you're wicked and this is the way that he put it to the people he said if you're wicked you're walking on brittle threads over hell you're walking on ropes that are giving way right as you walk on them and you're standing over hell and you're walking on those ropes and you're about to fall in their foot shall sight in due time rocked the nation with that sermon and there was a revival the great awakening is what they call it listen but the brethren said tonight my brethren your soul is over hell on a chain well it's not important what the bible says about how i dress or what i do hear me this morning your soul is hanging on a chain yes and that chain is not some theological seminary's teaching that chain is not some denomination or some creed that you're living by that chain is god's word and as i've told you recently you might go home and say well i i believe everything brother ben says i believe in my pastor i believe he's a man of god i'll take what he says listen you are not hanging over hell by a chain of my words or any other man's words but by what god said he said it's a chain you're hanging over hell with it and that's the only thing that'll carry you through oh god i want to make it don't you listen to this he said when the believer becomes a make-believer and lives on one word that's contrary to this word he cuts his fellowship with god one link broke a chain is its strongest at its weakest link or we can say it this way it's only as strong as its weakest link your faith in the word will only hold by its weakest link by the verse you believe the least are you with me now oh i believe jesus is my savior but we've got to believe all of it yes sir amen well this ought to encourage our faith today he said if there's something in the word that's puzzling to you something that you've heard different but they said oh the oh oh that was for the apostles them things was for days gone by in other words it's not for you that's for somebody else it's eve's interpreter he said when the scripture said jesus christ is the same do we believe that today yesterday today and forever don't let that be a weakness now watch this morning your life is hanging by a chain of the word only as strong as its weakest link your life then is hanging on your under on your belief that god is a healer as well as your belief that god is a savior on your faith that god still has what he says he has right your life is hanging on genesis 1 1. you created the heavens and the earth your life is hanging on ephesians 4 11. you can take any verse of it but say well we can take that out it don't matter it ceased your life's hanging on it right how can you be the bride and refuse part of the dress you see what i'm saying this one is serious i don't mean to be a downer this morning but it's serious do i believe every word or do i make excuses for myself or for somebody else he says them things was for days gone by when the scripture said jesus christ was is the same yesterday today and forever don't let that be a weakness listen if you if you find yourself with something you you don't understand you're puzzled about you're worried about it don't let it be a weakness don't shy away from it are you hearing me don't don't pull back and say well i i just don't really know if i should really be the kind of wife that god wants me to be i don't really know if i should really be the kind of husband the kind of child the kind of pastor the kind of deacon that he wants me to be i don't really know if what he wrote in the word about these things is really true or not maybe i should just let it slide maybe it doesn't matter if i go to church maybe it doesn't matter you see what i'm saying our life is hung by its weakest link but aren't you glad the mercy of god provided us the holy ghost that we could have his spirit that he could teach us what to do and what god meant by what he said are you hear me today he could teach us the word of god and he will not let us fall amen amen but now he said don't let that be a weakness fortify it hold it wrap your life into it whatever that weak link is whatever that part of the word is it's so hard for you to understand well i just have a problem with god sending a prophet i have a problem with all these things find what that word is and fortify it don't let that be a weakness that's where satan will attack you it doesn't really matter how people live it doesn't really know find where it's a weakness and don't walk away from it don't ignore it fortify it and hold it wrap your life into it otherwise i may have a temper but god told me that the wrath of god doesn't work the righteous the wrath of man doesn't work the righteousness of god that's the word i'm going to wrap myself in that angry and sin not no don't let the sun go down on your wrath i'm gonna wrap myself in that whatever it is you could go to whatever it is in your life i'm gonna fortify that hold it because it's the only thing that'll ever take me over the flames of hell we bow our heads as musicians come this morning what do you have trouble with give it to god this morning lord i'm going to wrap myself in your word it may be hard for me to understand why a woman shouldn't wear pants shouldn't cut her hair but it's your word lord let me wrap myself into it don't let me fall lord i know by my own reasoning i'll talk myself out of heaven i'll talk myself out of eden like like eve did i'll listen to things that aren't right i'll hear things how will i know what i hear i'll hear you let me hear your word lord let me hear only your word let me hear the blessings of god but also let me hear the warning i want to be one who lives by all the word of god where i haven't forgive me lord i believe i have an advocate with the father i'd spend the rest of my life dealing with the condemnation of the past but let me move forward lord where that chain was weak let let me let that become my fortified place the place where where i used to have a problem i just said well it don't matter church doesn't matter but now that's my fortified place maybe my family did things a certain way and they all fought and fussed and argued but now peace is my fortified place where everybody's sick all the time and and others just constantly disease running in my
