[35:31] Almighty [singing]
[35:33] God,
[35:36] there [music and singing] is none like.
[35:39] Let me hear you say with all your
[35:41] hearts, if you believe in it this
[35:42] [music] morning. Oh, there is.
[35:47] Oh, there's nobody like you.
[35:51] And no one [music] else can touch my
[35:54] heart like you.
[35:58] [music] And I [singing] search for all
[36:01] eternity
[36:03] long.
[36:05] And I find there is love. [music] Sing
[36:08] it for us one more time with all your
[36:10] hearts now. Oh yes.
[36:13] Oh [music and singing] there is none
[36:16] like you
[36:21] and no one else.
[36:24] Nobody else. [music]
[36:28] Oh, [singing] I can search for all and
[36:32] turn it [music] on
[36:35] and I [singing] find there's none like
[36:40] you.
[36:43] Amen. Do we know that song? Let your
[36:45] word be born.
[36:48] See, couldn't see. [music] Amen. How
[36:50] many wants the word to be born in your
[36:51] heart this morning? Amen. Let's start
[36:53] with the chorus if you would.
[36:56] Let your word [singing]
[36:58] be born
[37:00] in the manger of my heart.
[37:03] [singing and music]
[37:05] Let it live in me. Let it
[37:08] [music and singing] start.
[37:12] Live inside this house [music]
[37:16] and mold me [singing] every day.
[37:21] Let [music] your word be born
[37:24] in the manger [singing]
[37:27] of my [music] heart.
[37:32] It was a tiny [singing]
[37:33] simple staple [music]
[37:36] all beaten
[37:41] hardly a place
[37:44] for a king to be [music] born.
[37:48] He didn't choose some place special
[37:50] [singing]
[37:52] to reveal his majesty. [music]
[37:55] So I know if I give [singing] him
[37:58] control,
[38:00] he'll be born in [music] me.
[38:04] Let [singing]
[38:05] your word be born [music]
[38:09] in the manger of my heart.
[38:14] Let it live in me.
[38:17] Baby star [music and singing]
[38:21] inside this house
[38:25] and love [music] me [singing] every day.
[38:29] And let your word be born
[38:32] in a manger
[38:35] of my [singing] heart. [music]
[38:39] Well, outwardly I'm nothing.
[38:44] Not much to behold, [singing]
[38:48] unlikely
[38:50] place
[38:52] for his word [singing] to unfold.
[38:54] [music]
[38:56] Unfoul let it have his way. [music]
[39:01] Have his [singing] way. Sorry. Oh, from
[39:04] glory unto glory. [music]
[39:07] He will change me day by [singing] day.
[39:11] Let [music]
[39:12] your word.
[39:15] Oh, sing with all your hearts now,
[39:16] church.
[39:19] [music] Oh, let [singing] it live in me.
[39:23] Oh, let it start. [music]
[39:26] Won't you live inside [singing] this
[39:29] house [music]
[39:32] and hold me every day?
[39:36] Let [singing] your word be born
[39:40] in a manger. Sing the chorus one more
[39:42] time. I wonder if we can stand and
[39:43] [music and singing] sing it now. Oh, let
[39:47] your [music] word
[39:49] be born
[39:51] in a manger. Is that your desire this
[39:54] morning? [music]
[39:56] Let it [singing] live me. Let it start.
[40:00] Oh, [music] let it start [singing]
[40:02] living inside.
[40:06] Oh yes [singing] and more [music] we
[40:11] Oh, let your word be born
[40:14] in a manger
[40:17] of my heart.
[40:20] [singing]
[40:21] Give him one more hand clap of praise
[40:23] this morning. [applause]
[40:28] Let's sing this. He became me so that I
[40:30] could become him. Aren't you thankful he
[40:32] could become flesh so that he could send
[40:34] his spirit and live through us this
[40:36] [music] morning? You know, we know it
[40:38] wasn't maybe this time of year that he
[40:39] was born, but you we worship him every
[40:42] Sunday. We don't come just [music] to
[40:43] every time we come to church, we're
[40:44] worshiping him.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Every time we come here, it's all about
[40:49] him. [music]
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Every morning when you pray, when you
[40:51] pray and you get down on your knees and
[40:53] pray or you open your Bible, [music]
[40:54] it's all about him. Brother Brandham
[40:56] said he was in every verse of the
[40:58] scripture.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Every verse. It's all about him. So this
[41:02] time, you know, when when the world's
[41:03] made it about everything but Christ, I
[41:06] think it's time to remember that there's
[41:09] more about there's more to this thing
[41:10] [music] than just a baby in a manger.
[41:12] There's more to this than, you know,
[41:14] there's more to this than just presents
[41:16] and gifts and [music] things like that.
[41:18] Amen. But it's a time to reflect and
[41:19] remember why we worship who we worship.
[41:21] He was a baby. He lived and he died, but
[41:24] he's come back and he's living inside of
[41:25] every one of us this morning. So if you
[41:27] have his spirit on the inside of you, we
[41:29] ought to be able to worship him like
[41:30] nobody else. The world can't worship
[41:32] like we can worship cuz we know why
[41:34] we're worshiping. Do you believe that
[41:35] this morning? Because he became me, we
[41:38] could become him. Let's sing with all of
[41:39] our hearts as our pastor comes. There
[41:40] will be a baby dedication right [music]
[41:42] after this. Let's sing it now. Oh, I
[41:46] know [singing] that he [music]
[41:50] became me
[41:53] so that I might
[41:56] become him
[41:59] by grace. [singing]
[42:04] Yes, [music]
[42:05] he
[42:07] became [singing]
[42:08] me [music]
[42:10] so that I might
[42:13] become him by grace. [singing]
[42:21] Oh, he [music] took my place
[42:27] so that I through
[42:30] his. [music and singing]
[42:32] Aren't you thankful for it this morning?
[42:35] Yes, we did. Oh, [singing]
[42:38] he
[42:40] became [music] me
[42:43] so that I might
[42:46] become him [singing]
[42:49] by grace. One more time with all your
[42:51] hearts. Sing it like you mean it now.
[42:54] Oh, he [music]
[42:56] became [singing] me
[43:00] so that I might [singing] become [music]
[43:05] in my grave.
[43:09] Sing it now. [singing]
[43:10] Oh, he [music]
[43:13] became me
[43:16] so [music] that I might [singing]
[43:19] become him
[43:22] by [music]
[43:23] grace. [singing]
[43:24] He took my place. Aren't you glad he
[43:26] did? For [music] he
[43:30] took my [singing] place
[43:33] so that I through his love [music]
[43:38] could take his [singing]
[43:43] for he [singing]
[43:46] became me
[43:49] so that I [music] might [singing]
[43:52] become him
[43:55] by my grace.
[43:59] Aren't you glad [music] for grace this
[44:00] morning? Amen. We'll be seated just for
[44:03] a moment and
[44:05] we're going to have a uh dedication
[44:07] [music] little Maya uh it's been
[44:09] dedicated this morning. My sister uh
[44:13] just has a [music] heart for children
[44:15] and the Lord has placed several children
[44:17] in her life and I believe there's
[44:19] something special about this one just as
[44:21] a baby coming into her home. And so
[44:23] we're going to dedicate this baby to the
[44:25] Lord. And especially these babies that
[44:27] come from the foster system, it's hard
[44:29] to [music]
[44:30] know what their future will hold, but we
[44:32] believe that God holds their future. He
[44:34] knows all about them. And [music] so
[44:36] we're just going to have that this
[44:39] morning. Brother Brandham said this
[44:40] about dedications. He said, "What an
[44:42] appropriate time." [music]
[44:43] He said, "When in the manger there was
[44:45] found a baby, a Christmas time for
[44:47] dedication [music] of babies back to
[44:49] God." So thought that was appropriate
[44:51] this morning. if you would come.
[44:53] Let's sing Bring Them In, Brother Joel,
[44:55] if you could do that.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[44:58] [singing] Oh, [music]
[44:59] bring them in.
[45:03] Bring them [singing] in.
[45:07] Bring them in from the fields of
[45:11] [music and singing] sin.
[45:13] Bring them in.
[45:17] Bring them in.
[45:20] Bring the [singing] little ones to
[45:24] Jesus. [music]
[45:28] &gt;&gt; I don't think little Ma's afraid of
[45:30] anything. She She just loves to look
[45:33] around. Look at this. See all them
[45:35] people?
[45:37] Yeah, we sure love these little ones.
[45:40] Let's bow our heads together.
[45:42] Heavenly Father,
[45:44] Lord, you you saw Lord before this baby
[45:47] was born. Lord, the need that it would
[45:50] have of a family and a mother, Lord, and
[45:53] you placed it in this family, Lord. I
[45:56] pray that you would just, Lord, that you
[45:59] would just be with this baby. That you
[46:01] would there would be a hedge built
[46:03] around about its life. Lord, as she
[46:05] grows, may she be nurtured in the fear
[46:07] and admonition of the Lord. I pray for
[46:09] this home, Lord, that Becky raises these
[46:12] children, all all three of them. Lord, I
[46:14] I pray, God, that you'd just help her.
[46:16] Lord, we know the struggle of it, but we
[46:18] know that you're her helper. I pray you
[46:20] would do that this morning. Pray you
[46:22] protect the little child from sickness,
[46:25] from things, Lord, that would come
[46:28] quench every fiery dart of the enemy. I
[46:30] pray, Lord, that she would grow to serve
[46:32] you and to be a wonderful part of your
[46:34] kingdom and give her heart to you at the
[46:36] earliest opportunity. Lord, I pray that
[46:39] you grant it. If you, Terry, Lord, may
[46:40] she become a strong Christian, a
[46:42] believer. Pray you grant it, Lord Jesus.
[46:45] Lord, we pray for all of these at this
[46:47] time of year. Lord, these children that
[46:49] Lord, maybe aren't born in the best
[46:51] situation, but Lord, you see them, you
[46:54] know. I pray you'd protect each one. I
[46:56] pray you bless this family. Now, we
[46:58] dedicate little Maya back to the Lord in
[47:00] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Bless you. Let's
[47:06] give her a hand this morning. [applause]
[47:12] All right, that'll be all the singing
[47:13] this morning.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I want to, if you'll stand with me, I
[47:21] want to read from first John chapter 1.
[47:24] [snorts]
[47:24] It's good to be here. If I haven't
[47:27] mentioned your name this morning, good
[47:28] to see everybody again. We were gone
[47:30] last week and so sometimes when I miss a
[47:33] week and then somebody else has missed a
[47:35] week, it seems like forever since I've
[47:36] seen you, but we sure good to see you
[47:38] this morning. God bless you. If you have
[47:40] any visitors among us, God bless you
[47:42] this morning. Thank you for being with
[47:44] us. 1 John chapter 1 and verse one. That
[47:47] which was from the beginning, which we
[47:50] have heard, which we have seen with our
[47:52] eyes, which we have looked upon and our
[47:55] hands have handled of the word of life.
[47:59] For the life was manifested and we have
[48:02] seen it. So
[48:05] there was it wasn't just a story, but
[48:08] there was a baby being held. There was a
[48:10] life that was manifested. There was a a
[48:13] real real man who went to the cross. It
[48:17] was a manifested life. The life was
[48:19] manifested. We have seen it. In other
[48:21] words, the word became flesh. And bear
[48:24] witness and show unto you that eternal
[48:26] life which was with the father and was
[48:29] manifested unto us. And then verse
[48:31] three, that which we have seen and
[48:34] heard, declare [clears throat] we unto
[48:35] you, that you also may have fellowship
[48:37] with us. And truly our fellowship is
[48:39] with the father and with his son Jesus
[48:42] Christ. I want to also read from St.
[48:44] John. St. John chapter 1 and verse 14. A
[48:48] very familiar scripture. St. John
[48:50] chapter 1 and verse 14.
[48:54] It says, "And the word was made flesh
[48:58] and dwelt among us. And we beheld his
[49:02] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[49:04] of the father, full of grace and truth.
[49:07] I pray the Lord would add his blessing
[49:09] to the word this morning. You may be
[49:10] seated.
[49:15] I want to speak to you this morning on
[49:16] the word becoming flesh and dwelling
[49:19] among us. I don't believe there's
[49:21] anything that causes more conflict among
[49:23] message people than Christmas. I don't
[49:26] think that ought to be the case, but it
[49:27] is. And we believe in freedom of
[49:31] conscience. In other words, if someone
[49:33] has a conviction about something, we let
[49:35] them have that conviction. And we don't
[49:38] want to uh ever trespass that because
[49:41] you can make someone sin against their
[49:42] conscience and and it would actually be
[49:44] a sin because it's unbelief. So,
[49:46] [snorts] we don't want to do that. And
[49:48] but what we try to do is treat one
[49:50] another with love and treat one another
[49:51] with respect at all times of the year,
[49:54] not just at Christmas, but all year
[49:55] long. Treat one another with love and
[49:58] respect. We can never go wrong in that
[49:59] way. Just try to help somebody. You
[50:01] know, I I I think people look at it in
[50:03] the world and say, "What can I do to
[50:05] serve the Lord?" Well, try to help
[50:07] people. That would that'd be a good
[50:08] start. Try to help somebody. Don't just
[50:11] be a a hindrance to people, but or a
[50:14] stumbling block. Be a stepping stone to
[50:16] help somebody. And I think there's,
[50:18] Brother Brandham said, as long as it's
[50:20] good for suffering humanity, he said
[50:22] it's of the Lord. And I believe that
[50:23] ought to be what we try to do. And yet,
[50:26] as the bride of Christ, we're called to
[50:27] even a higher walk. We believe we're
[50:30] going to be his bride. That we are his
[50:32] bride. And so, we have to stay with the
[50:34] word. So, we try to stay just as close
[50:36] to the revealed word of the hour as we
[50:38] can. We believe that the Bible is the
[50:41] word of God. How many believe that today
[50:43] that it's the word of God from cover to
[50:45] cover as brother Joel already said this
[50:47] morning. We believe that uh you can find
[50:50] Christ in every verse of the scripture.
[50:52] Brother Brandon said if you don't find
[50:53] Christ in every verse, he said then go
[50:56] back and read it again.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; So we believe that the Bible is the
[50:59] absolute word of God. We believe that in
[51:02] that Bible it tells us that there would
[51:04] come an Elijah that would come and
[51:06] restore the heart of the children back
[51:08] to the faith of the fathers. So we
[51:10] believe that we are living in that time
[51:13] with that evening light and we've seen
[51:15] that prophet come. And so what we have
[51:18] is the ability to look at what a prophet
[51:21] said and what a prophet did and be able
[51:23] to see how should we act in the world
[51:25] that we live in today where everybody's
[51:27] gone crazy and you can't find an
[51:29] absolute anywhere. But God allowed us to
[51:32] see what his word was all about in in
[51:35] the words of a prophet and and and and
[51:38] make it clear to us in this day. Not to
[51:40] write a new Bible but to make it clear
[51:42] to us so we could o it could be open to
[51:44] us to understand. In 1961 in a sermon
[51:47] titled Christianity versus idolatry,
[51:49] brother Brandon made this statement he
[51:51] [snorts]
[51:52] said studying on mythology and all these
[51:54] myths. Christmas itself is a myth. He
[51:56] said nothing real about Christmas.
[51:58] Christmas wasn't even mentioned in the
[51:59] Bible. They never worshiped the birthday
[52:00] of Christ. Wasn't no such a thing. He
[52:03] said that's a Roman Catholic dogma, not
[52:04] a Christian teaching. No scripture for
[52:06] it nowhere in the Bible. And for the
[52:08] first hundred years after the Bible see
[52:10] nothing of it. It's just a myth. He said
[52:12] Santa Claus commercial everything. the
[52:14] whole thing has wound up into a big
[52:16] conglomeration. And boy, it got quiet.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; But that's the truth,
[52:23] &gt;&gt; right? We believe that. We know that to
[52:25] be the truth. Now, the next week,
[52:27] Brother Brandon preached a sermon that
[52:29] was in uh on December 17th, 1961,
[52:33] Christianity versus idolatry. The next
[52:34] week, Brother Brandon preaches a
[52:36] Christmas message
[52:38] titled, "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And he says this. He said, "Yet at
[52:42] Christmas, you know, little kitties, you
[52:44] can't tell them no different." He said,
[52:46] "It's just Christmas time for them." He
[52:48] said, "And they wouldn't have their
[52:49] little sock come up, sock hung up, there
[52:51] would be something." So he said, "If
[52:53] they didn't have a sock hung up, there
[52:54] would be something." He said, "It's a
[52:56] tradition." Even in our nation, they
[52:57] hang up a sock and something another. He
[52:59] said, "Why I did when I was a kid?" And
[53:01] although as far off the scripture beaten
[53:02] path as it is, kids are they hear the
[53:05] other kids say, "Well, I got this for
[53:07] Christmas. I got this little fell stand
[53:08] around. Look, you know, he said you
[53:10] can't make them understand, so just
[53:12] Christmas is here to stay. Now, now, how
[53:15] do you justify that with what he already
[53:17] said? I I think that he's doing the same
[53:21] thing Paul did when he talked about uh
[53:23] things that were sacrificed, food that
[53:25] was sacrificed to idols. Paul makes a
[53:27] remarkable statement in Romans chapter
[53:28] 14 and verse 5. He's talking also about
[53:30] those who observe one day above another.
[53:33] Talking about those who observe feast
[53:34] days, Jewish feast days, those who did
[53:36] not. He said, "One man esteemth one day
[53:39] above another, another esteemth every
[53:40] day alike." He said, "Let every man be
[53:43] fully persuaded in his own mind."
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Could we be Christian enough to do that
[53:47] today? And when it comes to Christmas,
[53:49] I'm going somewhere. This has something
[53:51] to do with what I'm preaching. So, I
[53:52] just want to lay this in before we go
[53:54] any further. He said, "He that regardeth
[53:56] the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And
[53:58] he that regardeth not the day to the
[54:01] Lord he does not regard it. He that
[54:03] eateth eateth to the Lord, for he giveth
[54:05] God thanks. And he that eateth not to
[54:08] the Lord he eateth not and giveth God
[54:09] thanks. So we said there's uh some
[54:13] observe and some do not but we give God
[54:15] thanks anyway. So whether or not you
[54:17] observe the birth of Jesus on Christmas
[54:19] as brother Brandham did or but it has
[54:22] nothing to do with your salvation. The
[54:24] just live by faith alone.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Right? We're not saved by Christmas.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not saved by whether how
[54:31] many gifts we got or whether we didn't
[54:32] get any or whether we how we did it or
[54:35] whether we hung things up uh lights on
[54:37] our house. We're not saved by that.
[54:39] We're not Christians because we serve
[54:41] Christmas. We're Christians because
[54:42] we've been born again,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; because we have a new birth, something
[54:46] in our heart. And and that ought to make
[54:48] all the difference. We ought to have a
[54:49] love one for another because of our new
[54:51] birth. Now,
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham,
[54:54] just a few minutes after saying what we
[54:56] just read, he said this. He said, "Let
[54:58] me make this clear. I do not believe
[54:59] Jesus would care what day you worshiped
[55:02] his birthday on if it's the 25th, 26th,
[55:04] whether it's April, May, June, July, or
[55:07] whenever it might be just so you
[55:09] worship. He said you worship him on any
[55:11] day. But here's what it is. They've
[55:13] taken the sacredness from Christmas to
[55:15] make it not a Christmas. He said a
[55:17] worship day, but a celebration. See, we
[55:19] you hear people say, "We're going to
[55:21] celebrate Christmas." He said, "That's
[55:22] wrong. We should never celebrate
[55:23] Christmas." Christmas is a day of
[55:25] worship, not a celebration. So, brother
[55:28] Brandham takes that and if you study the
[55:30] message and this week I went back and
[55:32] refreshed myself. I read every quote
[55:34] brother Brandham said anything about
[55:36] Christmas and I've got them all on a
[55:38] file if you if you want to have them
[55:40] sometime. But but if you go and look at
[55:42] it, brother Brandham is always pointing
[55:44] us to he said if there's something
[55:46] negative during Christmas time, he said
[55:48] there must be something positive during
[55:50] that time.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; He said the light shines the greatest in
[55:54] the darkest place.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Right? So what are we doing today? And
[55:58] and I wanted as I preach my Christmas
[56:00] sermon today, what are we doing today?
[56:02] We are letting the light shine in a very
[56:05] dark time when all the tinsel of the
[56:07] world has taken over. But we want to
[56:09] recognize that he was born, but he
[56:12] didn't stay a baby. He grew up to die
[56:14] for my sin. And and and he didn't stay
[56:16] on the cross either, but he raised again
[56:18] on the third day. And he's living in my
[56:20] heart right now.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said it should not
[56:24] be a celebration. He said, "But the
[56:25] birthday of Christ, I believe should be
[56:26] a day of consecration worship." He said,
[56:29] "Instead of tonight of people at church
[56:31] on their knees praying, thanking God for
[56:33] the real Christmas gifts, I think it's
[56:35] appropriate for us to have church today
[56:38] at Christmas time." Why did brother
[56:41] Brandham observe Christmas on as a day
[56:44] to remember the birth of Christ? Because
[56:45] we know brother Jesus wasn't born on
[56:47] December 25th,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; but he said light shines best in
[56:51] darkness. He said, "This Christmas ought
[56:53] to be an outstanding thing." He said,
[56:56] "We Christians ought, no matter how much
[56:57] it looks, it'll make it shine that much
[56:59] better." He said, "The whole world's got
[57:01] tinsel. We've got Christ."
[57:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what we ought to be letting
[57:04] shine in this dark hour that we're now
[57:06] living in.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; When Brother Brandham from 1957 to 1963,
[57:11] and this is going to lead into what I
[57:13] want to say this morning, preaching, but
[57:15] brother Brandham was at home every year
[57:18] from 1957 to 1963.
[57:21] and preached a Christmas message at the
[57:23] tabernacle. In 1964, he preached a
[57:26] Christmas message in Phoenix. In 1965,
[57:29] he was on his way home, but he had
[57:31] already told us what he was planning to
[57:32] preach. He said why it had to be wise
[57:35] men. And I've heard people say, "Well,
[57:39] brother Brandham did that, but we
[57:40] shouldn't do what we should do what
[57:41] brother Brandham said, not what he did."
[57:43] Well, if we apply that, we make Brother
[57:45] Brandham a hypocrite and a Pharisee.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. He said,
[57:49] "You've known me long enough. I hope
[57:50] I've lived before you to show show you
[57:52] I'm honest and sincere. I'm not a
[57:54] hypocrite. Even my critics don't say
[57:57] that.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Right. He said, "My critics say I'm
[57:59] wrong, but they don't say I'm a
[58:00] hypocrite." I pray we could live that
[58:02] way.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the word become so flesh in my
[58:05] heart that even my critics would say,
[58:07] "Well, he's not a hypocrite."
[58:08] &gt;&gt; He lives what he preaches.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; You realize that's why there's
[58:12] scriptural qualifications for a pastor
[58:14] in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1. Because a
[58:18] pastor doesn't just preach a sermon, he
[58:20] lives his sermon.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; But that's true for all of us. Brother
[58:23] Brandham said, "If you're a preacher,
[58:24] get you a pulpit and preach."
[58:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you're not a preacher,"
[58:28] he said, "don't try to be a preacher,
[58:30] but live your message." He said, "Oh,
[58:32] how Jeffersonville needs thousands of
[58:35] lived voices." Yes, sir.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. Not just a
[58:38] baby in a manger, but lived voices. We
[58:41] We need to see the word becoming flesh.
[58:43] Let it become flesh in our homes. Let it
[58:45] become flesh in our community. Let it
[58:47] become flesh all around us.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; That's what we need is the word to
[58:52] become flesh.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; See, you you would and rightfully so. If
[58:56] I did not live what I preached and you
[58:58] knew about it, you'd either quit coming
[59:00] to church here or vote me out.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Right? Because because I would be a
[59:05] fraud,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; a hypocrite.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; I got to live what I preach. I I make
[59:10] mistakes. I'm human. But I live what I
[59:12] preach
[59:13] &gt;&gt; to the best of my ability as a human. as
[59:16] a human being. A pastor is supposed to
[59:18] live his sermon and preach it. A a
[59:20] prophet does the same thing. A and
[59:22] Brother Brandham taught us that a
[59:23] prophet is a divine interpreter of the
[59:25] word. But he don't just interpret that
[59:27] in his preaching, but even in the way
[59:29] that he lives, the way God deals with
[59:31] him. He's not God. A prophet's not God.
[59:34] How many know that he makes mistakes?
[59:36] He's human, but he says, "Follow me as I
[59:38] follow Christ." That's right.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And he even come to uh with Moses when
[59:44] uh when when Moses made mistakes, but he
[59:47] was God's man. And brother Brandon said
[59:48] God backed him up even in his mistakes.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; But he said Joshua could have confidence
[59:54] because he said as I was with Moses, so
[59:56] I will be with you and he looked at
[59:58] Moses mistakes. I'm glad that God didn't
[1:00:00] call an angel a literal angel to come in
[1:00:02] this day. But he called an earthly angel
[1:00:04] a messenger that that was a human being
[1:00:07] and made mistakes. I'm so glad that
[1:00:10] Jesus didn't come as an angel, but he
[1:00:12] come as a man. He was a high priest that
[1:00:15] could be touched by the feeling of our
[1:00:16] infirmity. Aren't you glad for that
[1:00:18] today? No matter what you're going
[1:00:19] through, no matter what's going on in
[1:00:21] your life here at this time of year, it
[1:00:23] may be a dark time of year. I know for
[1:00:25] some people that Christmas time of year
[1:00:27] is a very dark, depressing time of year
[1:00:29] because of things that they've been
[1:00:30] through or people that they've lost. But
[1:00:32] I'll say today, there's a comforter here
[1:00:34] for you. There's a God who knows what
[1:00:36] it's like to be lonely. He knows what
[1:00:38] it's like to be alone. He knows what
[1:00:39] it's like to be weary. And he says,
[1:00:41] "I've come to comfort you today."
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; If a man walks in sin, we're not
[1:00:49] supposed to follow him.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Philippians 3:17,
[1:00:54] "Brethren, be followers together of me.
[1:00:58] And mark them which walk so as you have
[1:01:00] us for an example."
[1:01:02] So other words, they live like we live.
[1:01:05] For many walk of whom I have told you
[1:01:07] often and now tell you even weeping that
[1:01:09] they are the enemies of the cross of
[1:01:11] Christ whose end is destruction whose
[1:01:13] god is their belly whose glory is in
[1:01:15] their shame who mind earthly things for
[1:01:18] our conversation. That word conversation
[1:01:20] is lifestyle. Our manner of life is in
[1:01:22] heaven.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; From whence also we look for the savior,
[1:01:26] Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[1:01:28] vile body that it may be fashioned like
[1:01:30] his glorious body according to the
[1:01:32] working whereby he's able even to subdue
[1:01:34] all things unto himself. What is he
[1:01:36] saying? We we don't just let it be stay
[1:01:38] word, but the word has to become flesh.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going now, brother
[1:01:43] Brandham? It is not just that he
[1:01:46] preached one thing and did another, but
[1:01:48] he actually lived what he was preaching,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Why didn't the religious scholars of
[1:01:55] that day? As we turn our minds now
[1:01:57] towards my Christmas sermon with that
[1:02:00] now as a background, a foundation for
[1:02:02] what we want to say.
[1:02:04] Why didn't the religious scholars of the
[1:02:06] day recognize the word made flesh?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Why couldn't they see it?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; You know, he fulfilled every scripture.
[1:02:13] Yes.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Mary was a
[1:02:16] virgin.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; He'd be born in Bethlehem. He was born
[1:02:19] in Bethlehem.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; All the scriptures that were written of
[1:02:22] him, he fulfilled that. But they
[1:02:24] couldn't see who he was. And the reason
[1:02:28] they couldn't see it is because of
[1:02:30] tradition. And many times the thing that
[1:02:32] keeps us from revelation in our life is
[1:02:34] our own tradition that we've added to
[1:02:36] the word that we actually we actually
[1:02:40] though we're well taught. But this was
[1:02:42] the most well-taught generation of Jews
[1:02:44] that had ever lived. They were a people
[1:02:47] who who dotted their eyes and crossed
[1:02:49] their tees and they were they were the
[1:02:51] most legalistic of the legalists.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Right. In that day, they had everything
[1:02:55] going the way they thought it should go.
[1:02:57] But you don't listen to me. You don't
[1:02:59] serve God by legalism. Brother said, "I
[1:03:01] don't serve God legally. I don't come
[1:03:03] here legally."
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, if I was if I was just just
[1:03:07] depending on the works of the flesh to
[1:03:09] make it in, I'd never make it in. But I
[1:03:11] live the way I do because of his grace
[1:03:13] in my life. Because he saved me.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul said. By the grace of
[1:03:17] God, I am that what I am. He said, "But
[1:03:20] I labor more abundantly than you all."
[1:03:22] He said, "Because grace has been shown
[1:03:24] to me." Well, I pray that we could live
[1:03:25] like that. That grace would be shown in
[1:03:27] our lives.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Grace for others, grace for ourselves.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that ought to make us want to
[1:03:36] serve him even more.
[1:03:39] They were the most well-taught
[1:03:41] generation of Jews
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; that had ever lived.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Generation after generation of Jewish
[1:03:47] people had gone into idolatry and
[1:03:48] paganism, but thieves didn't.
[1:03:52] But see, Satan has a way. If he can't
[1:03:54] get you to go up into paganism, he'll
[1:03:57] get you to go the other direction
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; into legalism.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Right? So what he did is what they did
[1:04:05] is they began to begin to preach a
[1:04:08] nationalistic gospel and during the time
[1:04:11] between the time that Malachi came and
[1:04:15] the last prophet that they had it was a
[1:04:17] period of 400 years where they didn't
[1:04:19] have a prophet and so they had great
[1:04:21] teachers during that time. One by the
[1:04:23] name of Hel was a great teacher whose
[1:04:26] teaching was that you had to follow both
[1:04:27] the written law and the oral law. So it
[1:04:30] wasn't just what was written but what
[1:04:32] was actually said by them or done by the
[1:04:35] Jews. He basically made tradition carry
[1:04:38] the same weight as scripture. He was one
[1:04:41] of the founding teachers of the
[1:04:42] Pharisees. That's the time that the
[1:04:44] Pharisee uh cult as it was came into
[1:04:47] existence was during that time. And and
[1:04:50] the Pharisees unlike the Sadducees they
[1:04:52] believed in in divine revelation. They
[1:04:54] believed in the oral law. The the
[1:04:56] Sadducees believed just in the written
[1:04:57] law the letter of the law. But the
[1:04:59] Pharisees are the founders of modern
[1:05:01] rebbitic Jew Judaism. It's they were
[1:05:04] actually the people who had it right.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's the way that the Jews are today.
[1:05:08] And and that's God's chosen people. But
[1:05:11] they couldn't see the word made flesh.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; The very word they were taught in.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; See, the Sadducees weren't looking for a
[1:05:18] Messiah, but the Pharisees were.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; They were the Pentecostals of their day.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Right. They were the closest thing to
[1:05:26] the real. And in fact Jesus in Matthew
[1:05:30] 23, Jesus spoke to the multitude and to
[1:05:31] his disciples saying the scribes and the
[1:05:33] Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. So he so
[1:05:36] he said they have that office. He said
[1:05:38] therefore whatsoever they bid you
[1:05:39] observe that observe and do.
[1:05:43] You realize what people are doing when
[1:05:45] they say brother Random didn't live what
[1:05:46] he preached.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; They're making him a Pharisee
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said that observe and do.
[1:05:51] He said what whatever they did you
[1:05:53] observe that observe and do. But do not
[1:05:54] ye after their works. For they say and
[1:05:57] do not.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; For they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[1:06:01] to be born. Lay them on men's shoulders,
[1:06:03] but they themselves will not move them
[1:06:04] with one of their fingers. Other words,
[1:06:05] they tell people to do things they won't
[1:06:07] do themselves.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; It's phariseism.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And they didn't recognize him. Simon
[1:06:14] didn't recognize him when he was invited
[1:06:15] to his own house. Didn't recognize him.
[1:06:18] And you all know the story, but a little
[1:06:20] woman that was of real fame, she
[1:06:22] recognized him when he come in. Well, I
[1:06:24] pray we could be like that little woman
[1:06:25] today. We could recognize him when he
[1:06:27] comes. We could we could bow before his
[1:06:30] presence. We could worship him when he
[1:06:32] comes.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; But but Jesus said they made the word of
[1:06:36] God of none effect. He said through your
[1:06:37] tradition which you have delivered and
[1:06:39] many such like things do ye. They built
[1:06:42] a framework of tradition for the word so
[1:06:44] that could only be seen a certain way.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; They were a generation of Jews that were
[1:06:50] looking for a Messiah. Oh, we we think
[1:06:53] that the Jews had been subjugated by the
[1:06:55] Romans for many many years, but that's
[1:06:57] actually not true. They had actually
[1:06:59] only been under Roman uh under Roman
[1:07:02] control for about 40 years.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So, they could remember when they were
[1:07:06] free.
[1:07:08] They could remember, the elders could
[1:07:10] remember when when they had had their
[1:07:12] own nation through the the I don't know
[1:07:15] if I'm pronouncing right, but the
[1:07:16] Hasmonian kings and and the high priest
[1:07:19] was the king for a while through the
[1:07:21] Mcabes and some of those they they
[1:07:23] remembered what freedom was like. And so
[1:07:26] they they they they believed they
[1:07:28] thought that oh that you know here's
[1:07:30] Messiah's going to come and take us back
[1:07:32] to that and he's going to overthrow
[1:07:33] these Romans. said they had it all
[1:07:35] worked out how it was going to happen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Just like some of us how it have it all
[1:07:39] worked out how the rapture is going to
[1:07:41] happen.
[1:07:42] Huh? We got it all figured out what
[1:07:45] exactly is going to happen and when it
[1:07:47] comes I wonder if we'll even recognize
[1:07:49] why what you know you want me to say
[1:07:50] something. Brother Brandon said the
[1:07:51] rapture is already in you.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; It's already started. It's already
[1:07:54] began. He said he said he would descend
[1:07:56] with a shout and he said a shout was a
[1:07:58] message.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Well, we got it all figured out how it's
[1:08:02] going to happen. They had it all figured
[1:08:03] out how was going to happen. But we
[1:08:04] don't want to miss the word becoming
[1:08:07] flesh. The word being more than just a
[1:08:08] written letter, but the word becoming
[1:08:11] something you actually do.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Worship can be just
[1:08:18] something we say.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of people will talk about worship.
[1:08:22] Oh, we want worship, man. We want
[1:08:24] worship. We want to be in a church
[1:08:25] that's on fire. And you know, and they
[1:08:27] get to worship time and they just barely
[1:08:31] Yes.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; barely able to get a hand up. Barely
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; able to make it. It's hot up here. I
[1:08:38] don't know if it is out there or not,
[1:08:40] but
[1:08:42] they just barely able to. Maybe if we
[1:08:45] sweat a little bit, it'll cool us off.
[1:08:48] But but uh you know, just you say they
[1:08:50] talk about worship. It's easy to talk
[1:08:52] about. It's easy to say, "I want to be
[1:08:53] in a church that's on fire." But how
[1:08:55] much prayer do we actually put in?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Right? How much time do we actually put
[1:08:59] into having a church be on fire? I
[1:09:02] believe we are on fire, but how many how
[1:09:04] many time how much time do we put in
[1:09:05] making sure it stays that way?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Because we can talk about it, but
[1:09:10] let the word become flesh this morning.
[1:09:12] The word wasn't meant to be just an
[1:09:14] idea. This message was never meant to be
[1:09:16] just something people say, a word
[1:09:18] stories people tell about a prophet. It
[1:09:20] wasn't meant to stay just on paper. It
[1:09:22] was meant to be lived by preachers,
[1:09:24] lived by evangelists and pastors, lived
[1:09:27] by the leoty, lived by every one of you,
[1:09:29] every one of us.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; We don't want to make the word of God of
[1:09:33] none effect by tradition. But let's make
[1:09:35] the word live.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You see, Herod knew enough about it that
[1:09:44] he recognized the Messiah as a threat.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. In Matthew 2:1
[1:09:50] it says, "When Jesus was born in
[1:09:51] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[1:09:53] the king, behold, there came wise men
[1:09:55] from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
[1:09:57] where is he that is born king of the
[1:09:59] Jews? For we have seen his star in the
[1:10:01] east, and are come to worship him?" And
[1:10:03] when Herod the king had heard these
[1:10:06] things, he was troubled, and all
[1:10:08] Jerusalem with him. And when he had
[1:10:11] gathered all the chief priests and
[1:10:12] scribes of the people together, he
[1:10:13] demanded of them where Christ should be
[1:10:15] born. And they said unto him, "In
[1:10:17] Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is
[1:10:19] written by the prophet, thou Bethlehem
[1:10:21] in the land of Judah, art not the least
[1:10:23] among the princes of Judah, for out of
[1:10:24] thee shall come a governor that shall
[1:10:26] rule my people Israel." Then Herod, when
[1:10:28] you had privately called the wise men,
[1:10:30] inquired of them diligently what time
[1:10:31] the star appeared? And he sent them to
[1:10:33] Bethlehem and said, "Go search
[1:10:35] diligently for the young child. And when
[1:10:37] you found him, bring me word again that
[1:10:38] I may come and worship him also." He
[1:10:40] didn't want to worship him. He wanted to
[1:10:41] kill him.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; But he recognized him as a threat.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But he didn't recognize, he
[1:10:50] couldn't see the word becoming flesh
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; and bow down before him, though the wise
[1:10:55] men did. See, the only ones who
[1:10:57] recognized him during that time were
[1:10:58] those who had a personal revelation of
[1:11:01] who he was.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; See, he had to tell Joseph in a dream
[1:11:05] because there was no prophet in the
[1:11:06] land. So, brother Brand say, he did it
[1:11:08] in a secondary way. He showed him in a
[1:11:10] dream.
[1:11:11] He had to he had to give a revelation to
[1:11:14] Simeon and a revelation to Anna. Oh my.
[1:11:17] That they would see him at the temple.
[1:11:20] It it was he come to shepherds and and
[1:11:23] the angels actually come down and showed
[1:11:25] them where he was. Oh my. Told him where
[1:11:28] he was and they saw the heavenly host
[1:11:31] and the wise men come following the
[1:11:33] star. two years they come across from
[1:11:36] the east and coming to to find him so
[1:11:39] they could worship the young child there
[1:11:41] in Bethlehem.
[1:11:43] And did you notice brother Brandham said
[1:11:45] in the coming of the Lord those who
[1:11:47] really received him he said it was
[1:11:49] Simeon never no never heard anybody
[1:11:51] nothing about him but he was looking for
[1:11:53] the Lord blind Anna in the temple John
[1:11:56] the Baptist in the wilderness
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; he said John went in the wilderness at 9
[1:12:00] years old never appeared again till he
[1:12:02] was 30 in the wilderness and men like
[1:12:03] that who secretly believed and kept
[1:12:05] humble they was looking for the coming
[1:12:08] of the Lord but why were those who were
[1:12:11] so well taught taught so ignorant.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; It's not how much you read, it's how it
[1:12:21] applies.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I've been working real hard on
[1:12:25] preaching, you know, and and and and and
[1:12:27] the way that we talk to our young people
[1:12:28] and stuff because we want it to apply.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; We want it to make sense. We wanted to
[1:12:34] you to be able to live it, not just to
[1:12:35] be an idea that you could tell us what
[1:12:37] the seals are, the thunders or something
[1:12:38] like that, but what what what what does
[1:12:40] the word mean to you?
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Right. How does it affect you? How does
[1:12:45] it take flesh?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Right? How does it become flesh in the
[1:12:49] way you deal with your parents? How does
[1:12:51] it become flesh in the way you deal with
[1:12:53] your children? How does it become flesh
[1:12:55] in the way we congregate together, in
[1:12:57] the way that we love one another, in the
[1:12:58] way that we in the way that we worship,
[1:13:00] in everything about our lives? How does
[1:13:02] the word become flesh? That's what we
[1:13:04] want to see. Not just the word in letter
[1:13:06] form, but the word in life form. Now,
[1:13:10] why were they so ignorant? Well, there
[1:13:11] was no prophet there at that time.
[1:13:14] Remember, he had to show Joseph in a
[1:13:16] dream because there was no prophet.
[1:13:18] That's why the Jews got so far off
[1:13:21] during that 400 years. They got so far
[1:13:24] away from God. Even though they thought
[1:13:26] they were getting closer to him,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; but by their traditions, they were
[1:13:30] making the word of God of no effect.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Right? They got so far off of from God
[1:13:36] that they didn't even recognize him when
[1:13:37] he come.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And why? Because God had to bring a
[1:13:41] prophet. And Amos 3:7, he said, "Surely
[1:13:44] the Lord God will do nothing, but he
[1:13:47] revealth his secret to his servant
[1:13:49] servants the prophets."
[1:13:51] He said then a prophet means not only to
[1:13:53] speak the word but also to foretell and
[1:13:55] a divine interpreter of the word. The
[1:13:58] divine word written the word come to the
[1:14:00] prophet. So the prophet is the
[1:14:02] interpreter of the word. So there had to
[1:14:05] be a prophet come John the Baptist
[1:14:08] right? You realize John and Jesus were
[1:14:09] born within six months of each other.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; So you would think that well you don't
[1:14:14] nearly need both. But you couldn't see
[1:14:17] Jesus unless you first got pointed to
[1:14:20] him
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; by a revelation.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; So it had to be a revelation.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That was revealed by a prophet.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And they could not see him. You realize
[1:14:33] Jesus had no disciples until John
[1:14:36] pointed at him
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and told him who he was.
[1:14:41] And yet every detail of his life of
[1:14:43] Jesus birth and life was foretold in
[1:14:45] scripture. Yet they could not see it.
[1:14:48] They knew what Isaiah said, "A virgin
[1:14:50] shall conceive." And they were looking
[1:14:52] for it to happen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; But when a virgin did conceive, they
[1:14:56] said, "That's not her."
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; That's not him.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? When he did signs
[1:15:02] and wonders and miracles and did exactly
[1:15:04] what the word said he would do and said,
[1:15:05] "This day this scripture is fulfilled,"
[1:15:07] they stood there and said, "This is
[1:15:08] Joseph's son."
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:11] They couldn't see that Jesus was the
[1:15:13] fulfillment of that prophecy. Are you
[1:15:15] with me this morning? Aren't you glad
[1:15:17] for Isaac can see Jesus rejoiced in his
[1:15:19] spirit and he said, "I thank thee,
[1:15:21] Father." He said that you've hid these
[1:15:23] things from the wise and the prudent and
[1:15:25] revealed them to babes. Oh, I feel like
[1:15:26] a baby this morning in learning. I feel
[1:15:28] like I don't know hardly nothing, but I
[1:15:30] know I've had something revealed to me.
[1:15:32] He hid it from the eyes of the wise and
[1:15:34] prudent. But he sent Elijah to turn my
[1:15:37] heart back to open up the word to me so
[1:15:39] I could see the word when it was made
[1:15:41] flesh.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] See, the word come to the prophet. The
[1:15:47] word didn't come to Hel.
[1:15:49] The word didn't come to them during the
[1:15:50] 400 years. The word come to the
[1:15:53] prophets. The word didn't come to
[1:15:54] Caiaphas even though he prophesied and
[1:15:56] and different things but the word the
[1:15:59] interpretation the divine interpreter of
[1:16:00] the word was John.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; So Jesus had no disciples until John
[1:16:07] identified him. Look at John 1:29.
[1:16:10] It says the next day John seeth Jesus
[1:16:12] coming unto him and sayith behold the
[1:16:13] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:16:16] the world.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my takes away the sin of the world.
[1:16:20] He didn't stop there, but every day once
[1:16:24] he got the revelation of who he was, he
[1:16:27] stood there. He said, he said, "There he
[1:16:29] is." Then again, the next day, verse 35,
[1:16:31] after John stood in two of his
[1:16:33] disciples, so he's got disciples, got
[1:16:35] people in his church looking to him as a
[1:16:38] leader. And he looks at him and he says,
[1:16:40] "You need to follow him."
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. Don't you realize that's the
[1:16:45] same thing that happened in our day that
[1:16:47] brother Brandham stood there and said,
[1:16:48] "You need to follow him." Yeah,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; you need to follow Christ. What was it?
[1:16:52] A voice crying in the wilderness, in a
[1:16:55] wilderness of dogmas and creeds and and
[1:16:57] pagan ceremonies and everything else. A
[1:16:59] voice stood there and said and said,
[1:17:01] "I'm going to I'm going to He lived what
[1:17:02] he preached, but he said, "I'm going to
[1:17:04] preach the word to you to help you
[1:17:06] understand this is him. Don't look at
[1:17:08] denomination. Don't look at all the
[1:17:10] ceremony things. Look at me." He said,
[1:17:12] "Look at the word. Look at Christ. Look
[1:17:15] away from even from the flesh of the
[1:17:16] prophet and look at Christ."
[1:17:19] Are you with me now?
[1:17:22] [snorts]
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; So John stood there and looking upon
[1:17:24] Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the
[1:17:27] lamb of God."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I love this next verse because this is
[1:17:32] the story of my life. The Bible says the
[1:17:35] two disciples heard him speak and they
[1:17:38] followed Jesus.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet speak and that's why I
[1:17:45] believe what I believe. I've told people
[1:17:46] before, I don't preach in spite of the
[1:17:48] message. I preach because of the
[1:17:50] message.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet when I was a young
[1:17:54] boy, and thankfully I was in a grew up
[1:17:55] in a home. Some of y'all ought to be
[1:17:57] thankful that you grew up in a home that
[1:17:58] taught you the message of the hour. I
[1:18:00] heard a prophet preach when I was a
[1:18:01] young boy. I heard him on tape and and
[1:18:04] and that voice, there was something
[1:18:05] about it that pointed me not to itself,
[1:18:08] but to point me to Christ.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; The disciples heard him speak. Who?
[1:18:14] John. But they didn't follow him. They
[1:18:16] followed Jesus.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Now I believe we follow Jesus. We follow
[1:18:21] Jesus. We follow brother Brandham as he
[1:18:22] followed Jesus because he was following
[1:18:25] Jesus.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't walk in a different manner,
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And Jesus did.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Look, they couldn't see it until John
[1:18:33] identified it. It was hid from the
[1:18:36] public.
[1:18:38] You see that seventh seal? How that
[1:18:39] works? I know maybe above some of our
[1:18:41] heads, but brother Brandon said if you
[1:18:43] go back you that listen to tapes, he
[1:18:45] said it was hid from the public.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Right. It John's who Christ was was hid
[1:18:50] from the public. But the hour arrived
[1:18:53] that the book was open.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And we see Christ.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Today our traditions have
[1:19:01] hit him just like their traditions did.
[1:19:03] But at the darkest night, I wonder
[1:19:04] today, can you see the light shining?
[1:19:07] This morning as we It's a beautiful day
[1:19:09] outside, but there's a lot of darkness
[1:19:10] in the world. Gross darkness is covering
[1:19:12] the people. But he said at evening time,
[1:19:14] there would be light. Can you see the
[1:19:16] light at the end time? This message is
[1:19:17] not a drudgery. It's not a book of dos
[1:19:20] and don'ts. But what is it? It's a it's
[1:19:21] a breaking of revelation. Just like
[1:19:23] John's message was, behold the lamb
[1:19:25] [screaming] of God that takes away the
[1:19:27] sins of the world. Behold the lamb of
[1:19:29] God that you can worship with. Behold
[1:19:31] the lamb of God. You can be a bride,
[1:19:33] too. Behold the lamb of God who takes
[1:19:35] away every sin.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad for him this
[1:19:38] morning? Aren't you glad to be one of
[1:19:40] his bride? Aren't you glad to have heard
[1:19:42] the voice of a prophet, I heard his
[1:19:44] voice, but I followed the lamb.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] Brother said as the first forerunner
[1:19:54] came from the wilderness and cried
[1:19:55] behold the lamb of God. He said the
[1:19:57] second forerunner will probably do the
[1:19:58] same when brother retells this in the
[1:20:00] church book. He said no doubt do the
[1:20:02] same by pointing the people to a word
[1:20:04] born bride.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] Something's been born in this hour. It
[1:20:10] wasn't a baby in a manger, but it was an
[1:20:12] infant bride on the earth.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride of Christ will be
[1:20:19] pointed to the skies at the appearing of
[1:20:21] Jesus screaming. Hallelujah. Oh, what
[1:20:24] are we going to be screaming, church? He
[1:20:26] said, screaming, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:20:28] will come forth from his lips." What?
[1:20:31] How does the bride scream that? You
[1:20:33] said, "Well, that's brother Brandham's
[1:20:34] job." No, we say what a messenger said.
[1:20:36] If he said, "Behold the lamb of God," he
[1:20:38] then we say, "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:20:40] He said, "The seventh angel messenger
[1:20:42] said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes
[1:20:44] away the sin of the world." will not
[1:20:45] behold my Methodist, my Baptist, my
[1:20:47] Pentecostal, but the word, the son of
[1:20:49] God, the lamb of God that takes away the
[1:20:51] sin of the world.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; For no other foundations is there,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We don't worship,
[1:20:57] brother Brandon. We worship Jesus
[1:20:59] Christ.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And all of his power, but a prophet's
[1:21:03] message pointed us to Christ.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, we don't we don't brother's not
[1:21:10] our inter intermediary.
[1:21:13] He was the groomsman,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; the best man,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; the mighty prophet
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; that come and handed us off
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; The word. I'm so glad that he did.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:21:31] Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] Why couldn't they see it? They needed
[1:21:34] their prejudices stripped away.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; They needed to be washed by the word of
[1:21:38] a prophet. Why do we have so much
[1:21:39] conflict and controversy? Because
[1:21:41] there's there's quotes people can't
[1:21:43] Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; There's scriptures they can't back.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Because it would mess with their idea.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Or the way that they live,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; When the kids were young, uh, younger,
[1:21:58] every time, you know, they get kind of
[1:22:00] rowdy. A few times I did this. we'd get
[1:22:03] together and you know have family prayer
[1:22:05] and I'd tell them now today we're going
[1:22:07] to pray or we're going to read Ephesians
[1:22:10] 6 can't remember the verse but it's the
[1:22:12] one where it says children obey your
[1:22:14] parents in the Lord for this is right
[1:22:18] [laughter]
[1:22:19] they got a little older and they
[1:22:20] realized what the rest of that said they
[1:22:22] they said read a little further fathers
[1:22:24] provoke not your children to wrath
[1:22:27] [laughter]
[1:22:31] but but what is it it's got to become.
[1:22:33] Now, think about it. If you have a
[1:22:34] problem with that, the problem's not
[1:22:37] with the word, unless it's a very simple
[1:22:39] thing. But if your kids have a problem
[1:22:40] with hearing that preached, children
[1:22:43] should obey their parents. The problem's
[1:22:45] not with the verse.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; The problem's with us,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; we should be able to take any scripture
[1:22:56] of the Bible.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. If our teaching doesn't align with
[1:22:59] something Brother Brandham said, we
[1:23:00] don't just throw out what he said. Come
[1:23:02] on. If it don't align with the
[1:23:03] scripture, we don't just throw out the
[1:23:05] scripture. We realize brother Brandham
[1:23:07] had a progressive revelation and things,
[1:23:09] but when we see something Brother
[1:23:10] Brandham taught over his entire life,
[1:23:11] his entire ministry, we don't throw that
[1:23:13] out. How dare we do that?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He was pointing us to Christ to throw
[1:23:17] out the word. To throw out his ministry
[1:23:19] is to throw out our our direction to
[1:23:22] Christ.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And we want to find Christ. We want to
[1:23:26] live with Christ. We want him to live in
[1:23:28] us.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; So, we want the word to live. We want
[1:23:30] the word to be made flesh. So, if you
[1:23:32] got a problem, a woman cuts her hair and
[1:23:34] and and she don't want to hear that
[1:23:36] scripture in first Corinthians where it
[1:23:37] says a woman shouldn't cut her hair.
[1:23:39] Why? Because she's doing it.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Right? If you sisters, I don't mean to
[1:23:44] make this about this today, but it just
[1:23:46] comes to my heart. A few scriptures if
[1:23:49] you sisters dress in a way and and the
[1:23:51] preacher is preaching the word, not his
[1:23:53] own opinions, but the word.
[1:23:55] Right? And it bothers you to hear it
[1:23:57] preached.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; The problem's not with the word.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; As brothers, if it bothers us to hear
[1:24:06] about how a man should be and what a man
[1:24:07] should do, the problem is not with the
[1:24:09] word.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; The word has to become flesh.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; See, this was God's great gift.
[1:24:21] And the people needed to be washed by
[1:24:23] the water of the word that a prophet
[1:24:25] spoke to be able to see it and recognize
[1:24:27] it.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Oh church, can you see that the bride
[1:24:30] today is God's great gift?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And the and we need to be washed so we
[1:24:37] can recognize one another.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; So we don't spend all our time fighting
[1:24:44] and fussing and feuding.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We must recognize
[1:24:52] the word made flesh and dwelling among
[1:24:54] us. This was God's greatest gift. And
[1:24:58] all they could do was see the wrapping
[1:25:00] that it came in.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He was God's wrapped gift. Brother Rand
[1:25:04] preached that to us in John 4:10. He he
[1:25:07] he told the woman at the well, "If you
[1:25:08] knew the gift of God,
[1:25:11] you would ask me for a drink."
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Right. If you knew the gift, hang with
[1:25:15] me for just a few more minutes and we'll
[1:25:17] get you to dinner.
[1:25:18] But look, they could not receive it
[1:25:20] because they thought more of their
[1:25:22] creeds than they did of the gift. He
[1:25:24] said, "That's the way it is today.
[1:25:25] People can't accept speaking with
[1:25:26] tongues in their church. It would ruin
[1:25:28] their creed. They can't accept divine
[1:25:30] healing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:32] and such great evangelical doctrines of
[1:25:34] the Bible, apostolic truths." Why?
[1:25:36] Because their creed condemns it. And
[1:25:39] brother Brandham illustrates that.
[1:25:41] Excuse the expression, but this is the
[1:25:42] way he put it. He said the took
[1:25:44] the wrapping paper
[1:25:46] instead of the gift.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He said that's what Simon Pharisee did.
[1:25:54] He took the wrapping paper instead of
[1:25:55] the gift. He said foolish
[1:25:58] Pharisee.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's what he called him.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Who [snorts] took the wrapping paper
[1:26:04] instead of the gift.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; You can you see the gift today? I know
[1:26:08] it's in flesh. I know the bride
[1:26:11] sometimes does things that people don't
[1:26:13] recognize and say, "Well, you know, they
[1:26:14] must not be bride cuz they they made a
[1:26:16] mistake or something like that." But can
[1:26:17] you look past the humanity of it? Can
[1:26:20] you look past it being in Hardy,
[1:26:21] Arkansas? Can you look past what God's
[1:26:24] what's going on around it and and and
[1:26:26] tear off the wrapping paper and look
[1:26:27] inside? There's some people there who
[1:26:29] love the Lord with all of their heart,
[1:26:31] who believe the message of the hour, who
[1:26:32] are doing their best to serve him, who
[1:26:34] are going in a rapture one day. Are you
[1:26:36] with me? It's not a maybe, but it's a
[1:26:38] it's it's a it's a certain thing. There
[1:26:40] is a people who are going to go and it
[1:26:42] won't be based on on their own works.
[1:26:44] It'll be based on election from before
[1:26:46] time ever began. They were called to go
[1:26:48] and they're going. There will be a
[1:26:50] people leave the earth. But the Brandon
[1:26:52] said, "If it wasn't for he said
[1:26:54] predestination, I'd be a very
[1:26:55] discouraged man." I'll say this because
[1:26:58] of predestination. I am not discouraged
[1:27:00] today. I believe God does have a bride.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:06] good
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; said they couldn't see it because their
[1:27:10] creed condemns it.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; So [snorts] they can't fellowship with
[1:27:14] people because
[1:27:15] well I have a creed about this so I
[1:27:17] can't fellowship with that.
[1:27:20] Better make sure it's the word.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said he's rejected as
[1:27:25] much today as he was then.
[1:27:27] [snorts] This Christmas night he's just
[1:27:29] as much rejected as he was the first
[1:27:30] Christmas night. He said they cannot do
[1:27:33] it because it disagrees with their
[1:27:34] creeds. All down through the ages, we've
[1:27:35] had the same thing. He talked about how
[1:27:37] there was no room for him at the end.
[1:27:41] Oh, church.
[1:27:44] [snorts]
[1:27:46] Whenever Brother Brandon preached a
[1:27:47] Christmas sermon, he'd say something
[1:27:49] like this. He said, "I want to dramatize
[1:27:50] this so the kids would understand."
[1:27:53] So, I kind of want to do that this
[1:27:54] morning, you know, with the inkeeper.
[1:27:57] Brother Brandon said they brother the
[1:27:59] Brandon said Joseph fed his fed that
[1:28:01] donkey real well because he said that
[1:28:03] Mary was heavy.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; She was great with child.
[1:28:08] So he fed his donkey real well the night
[1:28:10] before. He said they to went by the on
[1:28:13] the road down to the city of Bethlehem
[1:28:15] where he was born and she'd been in pain
[1:28:18] all day. that he'd come down there in
[1:28:20] the dust of the wagons. People who could
[1:28:22] travel faster than they could got all
[1:28:24] over them. They were going down towards
[1:28:26] Bethlehem. He said they come down there,
[1:28:28] got to a certain spot and there was a he
[1:28:31] said there was a the stars come out and
[1:28:35] and Joseph noticed it. He said he he
[1:28:38] said he looked he saw that star. He
[1:28:41] said, "Mary, did you see that?" When he
[1:28:42] turned to look at her, the star was
[1:28:43] shining in her black eyes. He said,
[1:28:48] he said that as they went down into into
[1:28:51] Bethlehem, he said they knocked on the
[1:28:53] door of the inn
[1:28:55] and they come down the inkeeper opened
[1:28:57] it up and and
[1:29:00] listen to him looked like a bunch of
[1:29:02] dusty, dirty travelers,
[1:29:05] more people to bother with,
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; but it was it was God condescending.
[1:29:13] Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; If he had known it was a king, be king,
[1:29:18] he'd have thrown open his house,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; put all them publicans and everybody out
[1:29:25] on the on the straw tick and let the
[1:29:27] baby have a room.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; But he didn't recognize who it is who it
[1:29:33] was.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; So he treated them in in a manner. He
[1:29:36] said, "Well, there's all there is is a
[1:29:37] stable, but that's good enough for God."
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:42] just a just a cave in the side of the
[1:29:44] hill. Now, we know again this didn't
[1:29:47] happen on on December 25th, but it did
[1:29:49] happen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And the inkeeper missed the birth of
[1:29:57] Christ.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He probably went back in, put his took
[1:30:01] his slippers off, put his feet up, and
[1:30:03] said, "I made some money tonight." Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Stuck his belly out there, you know, and
[1:30:11] stuck his toes towards the fire and
[1:30:12] said, "Boy, I showed them not going to
[1:30:16] overburden myself this night."
[1:30:19] Oh, church.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; How many times do we come to the house
[1:30:22] of God
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; and the knock comes at the door? He
[1:30:26] wants to become flesh. He wants to live
[1:30:27] in our hearts.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; We sit back and say, "Well, it don't fit
[1:30:31] with my creed."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:35] How many times will we have an
[1:30:36] opportunity to go to church with me with
[1:30:38] with people who love the Lord and and
[1:30:40] but we can't do it. That's not our
[1:30:42] creed. So and so hurt my feelings.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I got hurt. I got
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; God, let me let the word in.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; No matter what anybody else does, no
[1:30:53] matter what it's wrapped in, let me let
[1:30:55] the word in. Let me open the door of my
[1:30:57] home for the word.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He missed the birth of Christ.
[1:31:04] Because listen to me now, he didn't have
[1:31:06] room in his busy home
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; for a birth.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Let me let that sink in for a minute.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Our homes get busy.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; We get busy with work. We get busy with
[1:31:24] everything else. But he wants to get you
[1:31:26] in an atmosphere that you could be born
[1:31:28] in.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:31] How many people have missed the birth of
[1:31:33] the word because they were just too
[1:31:35] busy?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; They didn't have room
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; after everything else that was going on
[1:31:42] around Christmas
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; to let him in.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Young people, don't do that.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Don't do that. Don't get so busy. I want
[1:31:54] you to do well in school. I want you to
[1:31:55] do well I want I want you to have a
[1:31:57] family. I want you to have a wife or a
[1:31:59] husband if you if the Lord carries. Not
[1:32:01] right now.
[1:32:04] If the Lord carries, I want that for
[1:32:05] you. I I I want I want you to grow up in
[1:32:08] the fear and admonition of the Lord,
[1:32:11] but you you're going to get busy.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't spend all your time on your
[1:32:17] schoolwork.
[1:32:19] Don't spend all your time on your on
[1:32:21] your vacation. Don't spend all your time
[1:32:23] dreaming about that new car or that boy
[1:32:25] or that girl.
[1:32:29] Give him a little room.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Give him a little time at the beginning
[1:32:34] of your day. Give him a little time and
[1:32:36] say, "I know this is simple, church, but
[1:32:38] if we could just receive it this
[1:32:39] morning, if we could just receive him,
[1:32:40] let the word become flesh and the the
[1:32:43] word has to have a room to become flesh
[1:32:45] in.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are so jumbled up and
[1:32:48] you're not so thinking. I know people
[1:32:50] come to church and they come and they
[1:32:51] don't even think about church. They
[1:32:53] don't even think about the Lord. They're
[1:32:54] just thinking about what's going on at
[1:32:56] home, what they have to deal with on
[1:32:57] them. This Satan will bring everything
[1:32:58] to their mind and try to bring
[1:33:00] something. Some of you are thinking
[1:33:01] about your lost children. You're
[1:33:02] thinking about this and that. If you'd
[1:33:03] think about him, maybe your children
[1:33:05] begin to come back. If you'd think about
[1:33:07] him, maybe your healing would come.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; There was a king of glory.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; No room.
[1:33:21] How many times the word preached? People
[1:33:23] are too busy
[1:33:25] to go hear it or to turn on a tape or to
[1:33:28] read their Bible.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Too busy.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; They went on about their business. But
[1:33:36] the word was born that night.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Brotherson was wrapped as a gift as a
[1:33:41] gift from God. Sent from God. A God that
[1:33:42] they didn't know nothing about. They
[1:33:44] claimed they did. And they claimed they
[1:33:46] was looking for him, but he did not come
[1:33:47] in the way that they thought he was
[1:33:49] coming according to their creeds. And
[1:33:50] they could not receive God's gift.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; He was wrapped different. He was wrapped
[1:33:54] up like a baby. He was born in a manger.
[1:33:56] He come from poor people. He come from a
[1:33:58] bunch of fanatics. So how could they
[1:34:00] receive something like that? No wonder
[1:34:01] there was no room for him in the end.
[1:34:03] There's no room in our religious circles
[1:34:04] today. He said for a Holy Ghost meeting.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; They don't want it. It belittles them in
[1:34:09] the sight of the classes of the country.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I say I want to give him room
[1:34:13] this morning. It belittles them to think
[1:34:16] they humble themselves to come down to
[1:34:17] an altar to cry and to tar there until
[1:34:19] they're filled with power from on high
[1:34:21] to rise up from there with newness of
[1:34:23] life. To let women let their hair grow
[1:34:24] out, act like women ought to make men
[1:34:26] throw away their cigarettes, quit their
[1:34:28] drinking, treat their fancy. The word
[1:34:29] has to become flesh.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; It's too much for them. So they hold on
[1:34:33] to their creed of their church instead
[1:34:34] of receiving God's Christmas gift.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; He was wrapped in a dirty cloth, a
[1:34:40] swaddling cloth. He's wrapped today in
[1:34:42] the same thing which they call holy
[1:34:44] roller fanaticism. Bunch of heretics.
[1:34:46] It's wrapped up in swaddling cloth. And
[1:34:47] the world don't want it. Oh, I pray that
[1:34:49] we want it this morning. Oh, I'll serve
[1:34:52] God if I have time. I'll serve God if it
[1:34:54] don't get in the way of my job. I'll
[1:34:55] serve God if it don't get in the way of
[1:34:56] my my my sports. I'll serve God if it
[1:34:58] don't get in the way of this, that, or
[1:35:00] the other. I say we ought to serve him
[1:35:01] at this time of year and every time of
[1:35:03] year.
[1:35:11] Do we realize what it is?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; If you had all the money you would ever
[1:35:17] need to live on waiting on you at home,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; all you had to do was open up your door
[1:35:24] to get it. You would find time.
[1:35:32] Everything you would ever need to make
[1:35:33] it in life just plop down in front of
[1:35:37] you.
[1:35:40] For me, that's like $20,000. You know,
[1:35:45] some of you that's millions, you know,
[1:35:47] but no, like you think, oh, I could get
[1:35:49] out of debt. I could drive a new car. I
[1:35:52] could buy a new house.
[1:35:56] Have money to make it. I wouldn't have
[1:35:57] to work. I could spend time with my
[1:35:58] family.
[1:36:00] You'd miss church if you had to.
[1:36:03] I mean, come on now. If you knew it was
[1:36:06] waiting on you at home, you'd you'd do
[1:36:08] just about anything.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Make sure you were there. You know how
[1:36:12] they Some of you will do that for a cell
[1:36:13] phone
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; when they require a signature.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; You move heaven and earth to be there
[1:36:19] when it gets there.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; But what about him?
[1:36:26] This is not all you need for the rest of
[1:36:29] life. It's all you need for the rest of
[1:36:30] eternity.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And he's laid it at
[1:36:35] your doorstep.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Just like you come to the to the
[1:36:39] inkeeper. He's laid it at your doorstep.
[1:36:41] And you have a choice. Will I take it?
[1:36:44] Will I take time? Will I make time in my
[1:36:46] busy schedule to take him in to receive
[1:36:50] the word? Or will I just leave it there?
[1:36:53] Even though it could change my life. The
[1:36:54] truth is we don't really believe what's
[1:36:56] in the package.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; It's wrapped
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; and we've never opened it up to see
[1:37:02] what's inside it. That's why some people
[1:37:04] can't worship God the way that they
[1:37:06] should is because they haven't seen
[1:37:07] what's on the inside.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But if they could ever see what's on the
[1:37:11] inside, it'd make a worshipper out of
[1:37:13] them.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm so glad to raise that cloth
[1:37:19] off. Look what's laying underneath it.
[1:37:21] Eternal life. God made flesh and dwelt
[1:37:23] among us.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; But they don't even give the gift a
[1:37:26] chance to receive it today. It
[1:37:29] interferes with them. Oh, if somebody
[1:37:31] would raise up in the church and start
[1:37:32] shouting or praising God or somebody say
[1:37:34] amen.
[1:37:35] I know sometimes our meetings people
[1:37:37] say, "Well, you got a bunch of ministers
[1:37:38] saying amen." I got a quote for it.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Or somebody say amen like this
[1:37:43] group of ministers here."
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; I think it's appropriate for ministers
[1:37:46] to amen the word. But not just
[1:37:48] ministers.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody to amen the word.
[1:37:52] Right? So he said he said something like
[1:37:54] this group of ministers here or
[1:37:55] something or in the audience quickly. He
[1:37:57] said an usher would lead them to the
[1:37:59] door and if you had your name on the
[1:38:01] book it would be quickly taken off. See
[1:38:03] God don't have a chance.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I say give him a chance this morning.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You say well it might it might break
[1:38:09] into my dinner time. It might do that.
[1:38:11] Give him a chance this morning. Let him
[1:38:13] come to you.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Open the door. Let him in. Let the word
[1:38:17] be born
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; in your home.
[1:38:23] rejected in that day because it was
[1:38:25] wrapped in swaddling cloth. God's
[1:38:26] wrapped gift today for many.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Christmas is a bottle of whiskey.
[1:38:33] A party at the office
[1:38:36] spending too much on a credit card.
[1:38:39] That's not Christmas.
[1:38:41] I know it's what the world calls
[1:38:42] Christmas, the Catholic holiday, but
[1:38:44] that's not what we observe at this time
[1:38:46] of year.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We worship Emmanuel.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; A light in the darkest hour.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; People are still playing with the paper
[1:38:58] on the floor.
[1:39:00] They still don't want the gift.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Like a little child, you y'all, some of
[1:39:06] you give your kids Christmas gifts and
[1:39:10] birthday gifts, whatever it is.
[1:39:11] Birthdays are pagan, too, by the way.
[1:39:15] But you give your children gifts and
[1:39:18] there's
[1:39:20] wrapping on them.
[1:39:22] They take off the wrapping and they play
[1:39:24] with it. And you could have just got
[1:39:26] them a box.
[1:39:31] It's because they're not grown up
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; enough to recognize the importance. If
[1:39:36] there's something wrapped, there must be
[1:39:37] something good in it.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; If God delivered a package to the earth,
[1:39:41] there must be something good in it. If
[1:39:44] he's given us a message today, there
[1:39:45] must be something good in it. Let's not
[1:39:47] be like the foolish Pharisee that
[1:39:49] refuses to look and see what's inside.
[1:39:50] Well, I'm just going to live my life and
[1:39:52] go to church and be No. Look inside the
[1:39:54] gift.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Look inside and see what he said.
[1:39:59] Listen, people are still playing. They
[1:40:01] don't want the gift. But brother Brandon
[1:40:02] said, "I want it." How many can say amen
[1:40:04] to that this morning? I'm closing. He
[1:40:06] said, "I want it. I'm glad I received
[1:40:09] it." Oh, Emmanuel, God made flesh and
[1:40:12] dwelt among us, rejected and condemned
[1:40:14] all down through the ages. and his mercy
[1:40:17] extends today to every heart that will
[1:40:20] receive him.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you this morning as the
[1:40:23] musicians come, would you receive him?
[1:40:25] Take off the dirty cloth he's wrapped in
[1:40:28] and see Christ,
[1:40:30] hear the voice of the prophet of Malachi
[1:40:32] 4, Elijah, calling you to open the
[1:40:35] package.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; He said the first ones to open the
[1:40:38] package was the angels. He said when
[1:40:40] they l opened the package and looked
[1:40:42] inside, he said they began to rejoice.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:45] When the wise men f saw the star, they
[1:40:48] rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Oh, I
[1:40:50] believe it ought to be a rejoicing time.
[1:40:52] When we look inside the package and see
[1:40:54] beyond the tinsel and and the wrapping
[1:40:56] and everything else and see Christ is
[1:40:58] still he was born. He's a reality. He
[1:41:02] He's living among us. He's the same
[1:41:03] yesterday and forever. We don't have to
[1:41:05] wait till Christmas time to worship him.
[1:41:07] Let's worship him every day, every hour.
[1:41:09] Listen, if you've not let him in your
[1:41:11] heart, if he's still waiting outside
[1:41:13] knocking and your creed won't let him in
[1:41:14] or your lifestyle won't let him in, why
[1:41:16] don't you open up that door this morning
[1:41:21] with every head bowed and every eye
[1:41:22] closed?
[1:41:24] Open up that door.
[1:41:32] Don't be so busy
[1:41:37] that the word doesn't have time to
[1:41:39] become flesh. You see, Jesus didn't
[1:41:42] become the man of Galilee overnight.
[1:41:46] It took 30 years
[1:41:48] till John pointed him out and said,
[1:41:51] "Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:41:53] the sin of the world." 30 years.
[1:41:58] Oh, however long it takes. Brother
[1:42:00] Brandham said, "We're not we don't
[1:42:01] believe in overnight conversions." You
[1:42:02] know, he said that. In other words, you
[1:42:04] don't become a full mature Christian.
[1:42:06] Yes, you're born and and just it just
[1:42:08] takes a moment to be born, but you don't
[1:42:10] become a full mature Christian
[1:42:11] overnight. Don't get discouraged at
[1:42:13] yourself. You just keep receiving the
[1:42:15] word, receiving the word. Let the word
[1:42:17] become flesh.
[1:42:21] And Jesus even being the the son of God,
[1:42:24] God wrapped in flesh, he said, yet he
[1:42:27] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:42:30] suffered.
[1:42:32] You can only do that if you're looking
[1:42:33] at the gift.
[1:42:35] You won't put up with the long journey.
[1:42:37] Mary had a long journey. Joseph had a
[1:42:39] long journey. The wise men had a longer
[1:42:41] journey. But unless they recognized the
[1:42:43] importance of what they were looking for
[1:42:45] and what they were looking at, they
[1:42:46] would never go through the hardship.
[1:42:49] Unless you recognize today the
[1:42:51] importance of the message and the
[1:42:52] importance of what's being said, you
[1:42:54] will never go through the hardship. The
[1:42:56] first time you're mocked or made fun of
[1:42:57] or laughed at, you'll turn back. But oh,
[1:43:00] let me open up my heart. Let me see the
[1:43:02] importance of it today. Let me see God's
[1:43:05] wrapped gift.
[1:43:07] Oh, hallelujah. Let me see it. That's my
[1:43:10] cry. If maybe you've never given your
[1:43:12] heart to the Lord, I want to give you
[1:43:13] this opportunity. I do this because
[1:43:15] brother Brandon did it almost every
[1:43:16] Christmas time. If you want to raise
[1:43:19] your hand, brother Brandon taught us
[1:43:21] that was a powerful thing. If you want
[1:43:23] to raise your hand, maybe you've never
[1:43:24] really given your heart to the Lord.
[1:43:26] You'd like to do that this morning. God
[1:43:27] bless that hand. I believe he can do it
[1:43:30] today. I believe he can save you. If
[1:43:33] you'll just open up your heart to him,
[1:43:35] he can change you, make you new, take
[1:43:37] away all the old, make you a new
[1:43:39] creature in Christ. God bless that hand.
[1:43:42] Maybe maybe there's someone else here.
[1:43:44] Maybe you're a Christian, but you just
[1:43:46] kind of got busy and the word's been
[1:43:48] waiting on your doorstep and you just
[1:43:50] didn't take time to let him in. Said,
[1:43:52] "Brother Ben, I want I just want to take
[1:43:54] time today to let the word in my life."
[1:43:57] Would you raise your hand? My hands are
[1:43:58] raised. I want to take the time though I
[1:44:01] get busy. Brother Brandon said, "They
[1:44:02] got so busy at Pharisees house with
[1:44:04] religious things that they forgot to
[1:44:07] they forgot to entertain him when he
[1:44:09] came in." Yeah. No matter what you
[1:44:11] believe or what your theories are or how
[1:44:14] much what dogma or whatever you might
[1:44:17] have, he's still worthy to be worshiped,
[1:44:20] he's still worthy. Not just at this time
[1:44:21] of year, every time of year, he's worthy
[1:44:24] of our worship and our praise. Let's
[1:44:26] just let's just turn it to him now.
[1:44:28] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, is the hand
[1:44:31] that went up, Lord, for salvation. I
[1:44:33] pray God that you'd cleanse them of all
[1:44:35] sin today. you'd help them to receive
[1:44:38] your your great gift, Lord. May they
[1:44:41] quickly find their way, Lord, to a place
[1:44:43] where they can receive you with all of
[1:44:45] their heart. I pray, God, that you they
[1:44:47] would do it today. May they grow
[1:44:49] continually, Lord. Lord, that little
[1:44:51] light that comes on the inside as they
[1:44:53] raise their hand, Lord, may it continue
[1:44:55] to grow until it fills their entire
[1:44:56] being. I pray you grant it, Lord, for
[1:44:59] those of us, Lord, who want to welcome
[1:45:01] you in our homes. Welcome you, Lord.
[1:45:04] Welcome the word in our lives. And I
[1:45:05] pray God that you'd help us. Help me,
[1:45:08] Lord, not to get so busy even with
[1:45:10] pastoral things and things that are are
[1:45:12] good and godly. But Lord, may I not get
[1:45:14] so busy that I don't have time to
[1:45:16] receive the word. Oh, help me Lord. Help
[1:45:19] me, Lord. I I want to when you come
[1:45:21] knocking, Lord, I want to be there to
[1:45:23] open up. I don't want to be an inkeeper
[1:45:25] that put you away, but I want to give
[1:45:27] you room in my house. Oh granted, Lord.
[1:45:31] Lord, may we look inside and see that
[1:45:33] wrapped gift. open up the wrapping and
[1:45:36] see you revealed in this hour. I pray
[1:45:38] you'd grant it, God. I pray we'd be able
[1:45:41] to see one another, Lord. That's all
[1:45:45] we've got. There's not a lot of us,
[1:45:48] Lord. I pray you'd help us to see the
[1:45:49] gift of our of our people, Lord, that we
[1:45:53] fellowship with, Lord. The people that
[1:45:56] believe like we do, and we may have
[1:45:58] little differences here and there, but
[1:46:00] Lord, help us to see your wrapped gift,
[1:46:03] oh God.
[1:46:05] love one another, the word becoming
[1:46:07] flesh. Grant it, Lord, we pray. May this
[1:46:11] message be more than something we talk
[1:46:12] about or
[1:46:14] Lord, a a belt buckle or something we
[1:46:16] put on, but Lord, may it be a reality
[1:46:19] that lives in our hearts. We pray in
[1:46:22] Jesus name.
[1:46:24] Amen.
[1:46:26] Oh, shine all [singing]
[1:46:30] around us
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; by by day and [music]

[1:46:45] this morning, let's just stand and
[1:46:47] worship him now. Oh, we walk in
[1:46:50] [music and singing]
