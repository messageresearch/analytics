[0:07] praise the Lord
[0:11] [Music]
[0:15] you never asked me to stretch out my
[0:20] arms
[0:22] no one put nails in my hands
[0:30] I'll never filled up wait of the world
[0:37] carry that cross on my back
[0:42] [Music]
[0:45] then I do
[0:49] every pay
[0:52] all that you did on that day
[0:57] [Music]
[0:59] you took my place
[1:05] [Music]
[1:09] so that I could be free
[1:14] you died for me now I'm living for you
[1:21] for that's the least that I can do
[1:26] [Music]
[1:29] you never sent me
[1:32] out on my own
[1:36] you're always leading the way
[1:43] oh that you asked for is a home in my
[1:48] heart
[1:50] and only a small seed of faith
[1:57] I know you gave me
[2:01] all that I have
[2:04] so I Wouldn't Die give it back
[2:12] you took my place
[2:15] up there on that tree
[2:19] who played the price
[2:22] so that I could be free
[2:27] you died for me and now I'm living for
[2:32] you
[2:34] Lord that's the least that I can do
[2:40] you didn't have to walk down that road
[2:44] you didn't have to rescue my soul still
[2:49] you lay down your life just for me
[2:54] I should have been taken in those steps
[2:58] it should have been my last breath
[3:03] you just want me to believe
[3:10] you took my place
