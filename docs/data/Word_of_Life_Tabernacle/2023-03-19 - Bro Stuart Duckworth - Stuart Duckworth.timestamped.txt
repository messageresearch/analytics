[42:34] scriptures I mean I believe it covers I
[42:36] believe it covers where we are amen
[42:41] Revelations 5 9.
[42:44] and they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[42:46] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[42:48] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[42:52] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[42:54] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[42:58] Nation
[42:59] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[43:02] Priests and we shall reign on the Earth
[43:05] and I beheld and heard the voice of many
[43:08] angels round about the throne and the
[43:11] beasts and the elders and a number of
[43:12] them was Ten Thousand Times Ten
[43:14] thousands and thousands thousands
[43:17] sing with a loud voice
[43:19] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[43:23] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[43:26] strength and honor and glory and
[43:27] blessing
[43:30] and every creature which is in heaven
[43:32] and on Earth and under the Earth and
[43:34] such as are in the sea and all that them
[43:37] are in them heard I sang blessing and
[43:41] honor and glory and power be unto him
[43:43] that sitteth upon the throne and unto
[43:46] the lamb forever and ever you can be
[43:49] seated this morning
[43:53] amen
[43:55] we should be able to say Worthy is the
[43:59] Lamb that was slain this morning
[44:02] amen worthy Worthy is the Lamb that has
[44:04] redeemed us Amen to God by his own blood
[44:08] and what a blood that is amen
[44:11] amen and we can look here and what what
[44:14] a worship this was by John amen the lamb
[44:18] taking the book of redemption amen and
[44:21] our names were on that book amen and
[44:24] somebody had to come forth and to take
[44:26] that book
[44:27] amen if if if he hadn't came if the lamb
[44:30] hadn't came everything would be lost
[44:34] all creation everything would have been
[44:37] lost and everything in everything in
[44:39] heaven amen when they heard John
[44:41] praising everything in heaven and in
[44:43] Earth and under the Earth heard John
[44:45] Praise Him brother round said it must
[44:47] have been a real Pentecostal time
[44:50] amen a time of worship amen and we're
[44:53] living we're living under these
[44:55] scriptures our eyes have been open to
[44:57] the things that have happened in in this
[44:59] day and and what God is doing and and
[45:01] we're living under this type of worship
[45:04] amen
[45:06] My Touch screen's messed up on my
[45:08] computer so I'm just gonna have to hit
[45:10] the button like the old-fashioned way
[45:12] here
[45:14] amen so if if he wouldn't have came we
[45:17] would have been lost we would have all
[45:19] been lost right we needed a redeemer to
[45:21] come we needed someone a man to bring a
[45:24] blood to bring a sacrifice because
[45:26] because the law and we won't get into
[45:28] this a lot we wish we could we wish I
[45:30] had time but we understand that there
[45:32] was a law of redemption amen that God
[45:35] said in his word a law of redemption and
[45:37] that we needed a near Kinsmen the blood
[45:40] of sacrifice of bulls and ghosts that
[45:42] that which Abel brought even by
[45:44] Revelation wasn't enough wasn't enough
[45:47] to take us back to what to what we were
[45:51] before the fall to take us back to what
[45:53] Adam lost
[45:54] right because because as we as we
[45:57] ministered before amen Abel brought that
[46:00] sacrifice to the guard to the to the to
[46:02] the gate of the garden that was as far
[46:04] as he could come
[46:06] right it would only take him so far but
[46:08] yet under that sacrifice he would be
[46:11] brought back into Fellowship because God
[46:13] always provides a way for his people to
[46:16] have fellowship with him he provides a
[46:18] way to come back
[46:20] can I get this a little bit more volume
[46:23] my voice is going to give out
[46:26] I don't want to speak that but I need a
[46:28] I need a little bit
[46:30] But Here Come the lamb
[46:33] here come the lamb amen he brought forth
[46:36] a blood it wasn't the blood of Jews or
[46:39] Gentiles but it was a created blood it
[46:43] was the very blood of God Amen it was a
[46:46] creative blood and it was a blood strong
[46:49] enough Amen to to undo what Adam and Eve
[46:53] did to the rest of us right it was a
[46:55] blood strong enough to take us back it
[46:58] was a bleach blood as brother Branham
[47:00] describes in in the breach of uh and
[47:02] when he preached the breach amen it was
[47:06] a blood Amen to take us back amen our
[47:09] blood a Clorox bleach amen amen to
[47:11] abolish and to annihilate Amen to to
[47:14] cleanse completely
[47:17] amen
[47:20] amen our blood's so strong amen that it
[47:23] could bring forth back the children of
[47:25] God bring them back to their position
[47:27] amen
[47:32] amen
[47:35] so here we see these scriptures
[47:38] amen it was a time of worship it was
[47:42] when all the church agents were finished
[47:45] when the mysteries of the Plan of
[47:47] Redemption were finished Amen brother
[47:49] random said it was a time amen there
[47:51] where the seals were opened
[47:54] everything in Heaven and Earth worshiped
[47:57] this is what all creation had grown for
[47:59] this is what it had longed forced
[48:01] someone to come forth and to take the
[48:04] book someone that was worthy to take the
[48:06] book because if if he didn't all was
[48:08] lost we were lost everything would have
[48:10] just went off
[48:14] but because he had Sons and Daughters
[48:17] because God had a plan
[48:19] and God will he will ruin he will fool
[48:22] he has foiled Satan's plan he has
[48:25] disrupted amen Satan's plan that he had
[48:28] amen God Amen by Redemption amen under
[48:32] that law of redemption and by the blood
[48:34] is able to bring us back amen
[48:37] to what Adam lost
[48:42] amen everything worshiped everything
[48:45] worshiped and it was under this time
[48:47] that that worship took place and if we
[48:50] could just see amen that we're not
[48:52] living under just an ordinary Revival
[48:54] we're not living just uh just during a
[48:57] time of just an outpouring of the spirit
[49:00] and we'll get into that just in a little
[49:02] bit later I'll read you something that
[49:03] brother Brown said this isn't just an
[49:05] ordinary Revival that we're living under
[49:07] but we're living under the worship we're
[49:10] living under the worship of the Lamb
[49:12] that has come forth in this hour and
[49:14] that's that's that's the that's all
[49:16] that's what God has planned if I could
[49:18] get the word the words out this has been
[49:20] God's plan all along amen no matter what
[49:23] what we see what what what someone else
[49:26] does what someone else produces this is
[49:28] God's plan under this word of the hour
[49:31] under this Plan of Redemption and what
[49:33] he has showed us and what he has brought
[49:35] us under and this is what we worship
[49:38] under
[49:40] and Redemption this Redemption is
[49:43] bringing us back
[49:45] it's bringing us back to what Adam lost
[49:49] and brother Brown says here in the
[49:51] message the breach
[49:54] he says here but now in this Sevenfold
[49:56] book of seals of redemption that the
[49:59] lamb took within himself was the only
[50:01] one who could do it
[50:03] and he took it from the right hand of
[50:06] him that sat on the throne now to claim
[50:08] his Redemptive right to claim his rights
[50:10] he says to claim for me and you
[50:13] what he redeemed us from to see back to
[50:17] everything that Adam Lost In the Garden
[50:19] of Eden he has redeemed us back to them
[50:22] so we look at what what did Adam lose
[50:25] Adam lost his rights yes
[50:28] he lost his rights Adam was God of the
[50:30] earth amen he had all authority amen but
[50:33] he lost those rights he forfeited his
[50:35] right as a son of God
[50:37] amen but there has been Redemptive
[50:39] claims there's been Redemptive claims on
[50:43] you and I there's been a Redemptive act
[50:45] that has took place amen and Redemption
[50:47] the word Redemption is to bring back
[50:50] to bring back amen and to restore Amen
[50:53] to the former of what what it was
[50:57] right amen the bleach of blood has come
[50:59] forth in this hour and it has come forth
[51:02] amen and the understanding of it amen
[51:04] we've received that understanding amen
[51:06] amen and I say let it come forth this
[51:09] morning if there's something Among Us
[51:10] and there's something in our lives let
[51:12] that bleach come forth let it destroy
[51:15] any sin in my life in your life amen and
[51:18] in doing that it puts it back it puts it
[51:20] back on Satan
[51:22] that's what this blood does that's what
[51:25] the blood of Jesus Does
[51:28] to take away and break any hold that
[51:32] Satan would have upon us
[51:34] to take away the shame the shame that
[51:37] was brought on us amen by the fall and
[51:40] by these things that we didn't have no
[51:41] control over Amen to take away the shame
[51:44] amen and put Joy back in your life amen
[51:47] put Authority back in your life put an
[51:49] identification of who you are back in
[51:52] your life
[51:53] that we have a right
[51:55] amen we have an inheritance as the
[51:58] children of God
[52:00] and then we don't have to walk in shame
[52:02] we don't have to live in shame amen the
[52:04] blood takes every bit of that away it
[52:07] takes every bit of the fear it takes
[52:09] every bit of the unworthiness away for
[52:11] none of us could do it amen no man was
[52:13] worthy but one came forth that was
[52:16] Worthy
[52:17] amen I'm so thankful this morning
[52:23] amen so under Redemption
[52:25] we're going back to that which was lost
[52:28] amen
[52:30] amen Redemption means to bring back
[52:32] we're going back to to the original
[52:34] position that we had and gone
[52:36] and brother Brown talks about it like
[52:38] this he said you know he heard the story
[52:40] of the devil the devil put me in the
[52:41] pawn shop but Jesus got me out and
[52:45] that's what Redemption is
[52:46] that's what Redemption is amen the devil
[52:49] put me in there amen I I didn't have no
[52:52] control over what I was born and sin the
[52:54] devil put me in there amen but Jesus got
[52:57] me out amen he paid the price amen he
[53:00] thought enough of me to come by that old
[53:02] antique Place amen somebody may have
[53:04] walked by walked by me so many times and
[53:07] wrote me off said I wasn't worth nothing
[53:09] said you wasn't worth nothing but to
[53:11] Jesus amen you were worth his blood you
[53:13] were worth the stripes and the scars and
[53:16] everything that he took upon that tree
[53:18] of Calvary you were worth every bit of
[53:20] that to pay that price
[53:22] and he come by your way man amen and he
[53:25] took you out of the pawn shop he took
[53:28] you out of the prison he took you out of
[53:30] the prison of this life
[53:31] amen and brought you to a freedom as a
[53:34] son and daughter of God
[53:37] amen he paid the price that price of
[53:41] redemption
[53:45] and we were worshiping under that
[53:47] Redemptive Act
[53:49] we're not worshiping under a theology or
[53:51] or just a just an emotion
[53:55] just an emotion or something that we can
[53:57] muster up and then we're worshiping amen
[54:00] we're identifying ourselves with that
[54:02] sacrifice just as Abel about Revelation
[54:05] he came amen he he didn't have nothing
[54:08] to read he didn't he didn't have the
[54:10] material that you and I had but by
[54:12] Revelation and he died he identified
[54:14] himself and he died on the altar with
[54:17] his sacrifice and that's what it takes
[54:19] you say why did Abel have to die but you
[54:22] look at that type we all had to die on
[54:25] The Altar that old man that old that old
[54:28] Cain life that Old King body and you
[54:30] still have that potential in you well
[54:32] these bodies they're under that curse
[54:35] they're under that curse of sin amen we
[54:38] could go from here and and we could die
[54:40] we could we could die of whatever
[54:41] Anything could happen to these bodies
[54:43] these bodies could be destroyed
[54:45] we were under that curse
[54:48] amen but Abel Abel died on that altar
[54:52] with this sacrifice
[54:55] amen
[54:57] amen we have to we have to crucify these
[55:00] bodies got to crucify these lives amen
[55:04] to live
[55:06] live that life amen to follow Jesus
[55:10] amen
[55:14] amen so
[55:16] if we can see if we can begin to see
[55:19] where what Adam lost and what Jesus done
[55:22] for for us we can see we're at what what
[55:24] Adam lost where he fell from and where
[55:26] where Christ is bringing us amen we can
[55:29] begin to see a picture of what Christ
[55:31] has in store for us and what what he's
[55:34] done for us by this Redemptive act amen
[55:36] if we can see amen by Revelation what he
[55:39] has done for us we can begin to have the
[55:41] right kind of faith I mean because if
[55:44] we're a son or daughter of God Amen you
[55:46] can live below your privileges if you
[55:49] don't recognize what God done for him
[55:51] and that's you are a son you're living
[55:53] below your privileges today you're
[55:55] living below the authority amen that God
[55:58] is as a Son of God Amen in The
[56:01] Inheritance as a Son of God has for you

[56:12] faith we want to have the right kind of

[57:20] the whole pawn shop and bulldozed it
[57:22] down and destroyed it amen for any
[57:24] remembrance amen that's what the blood
[57:26] does and then it takes away every
[57:28] remembrance
[57:30] that's good yes sir faith is a victory
[57:33] this morning
[57:34] if you can lay hold if you're going to

[57:41] yourself and come under that worship of
[57:44] the one that came forth amen it'll give
[57:46] you that victory
[57:50] praise the Lord
[57:55] amen
[57:58] so we're under
[58:00] we're under the expectation
[58:02] amen of fullness of redemption
[58:06] we understand what that is the fullness
[58:08] of redemption
[58:09] Jesus Paid the price redemption's been
[58:12] paid amen but Redemption amen as we as
[58:16] we said before it were going back to
[58:18] something we're being restored back to
[58:20] something so Redemption we are in the
[58:23] process of redemption
[58:25] we can say this morning that we're
[58:27] redeemed
[58:28] that we're redeemed if you have the Holy
[58:30] Ghost In You amen you've been sealed
[58:32] until the day of your Redemption there's
[58:35] nothing there's nothing Satan can do to
[58:37] take that seal off
[58:39] if he could he could be your brother he
[58:41] could he could access that but there's
[58:43] nothing he can do to take that seal off
[58:44] you have been sealed by the Holy Ghost
[58:47] until the day of your Redemption
[58:50] amen and we're living amen under that
[58:52] expectation amen that I've got the
[58:54] earnest within me I've got something
[58:56] that came amen it wasn't just an emotion
[58:59] it wasn't just something that somebody
[59:01] talked me into but it's something that
[59:03] changed my life it changed my nature it
[59:06] changed me from who I was amen it's
[59:09] changing me now amen and I'm in the
[59:11] process I may not be what I want to be
[59:13] but thank God I'm not what I used to be
[59:15] amen I'm in the process of redemption of
[59:19] coming back to what I was in God amen
[59:21] amen and when that happens when the
[59:23] fullness of redemption comes this body
[59:25] is going to be changed in the moment in
[59:28] the twinkling of an eye and we're going
[59:29] to be caught up together with our Lord
[59:32] to meet him in the air
[59:35] amen
[59:37] amen the next time when you see Jesus
[59:40] you're not going to see him in these
[59:42] bodies he's not going to see you you're

[59:45] but you're gonna meet him Amen in a full
[59:47] am in a fully redeemed body amen amen

[59:59] restoration
[1:00:01] that's right
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:11] so by faith I mean we're living under
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:16] Amen in faith in the one who was able to
[1:00:18] redeem us
[1:00:20] and we live under that expectation amen
[1:00:23] amen the one
[1:00:25] that's the one who has claimed to
[1:00:26] redempt to rights upon his people I mean
[1:00:28] that's who we have faith in amen this
[1:00:30] evening this this morning
[1:00:32] amen it was God's plan all along to
[1:00:35] bring us back
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:39] it's good we read here Romans 8 15. I
[1:00:43] don't think I gave this to
[1:00:44] the brother for we have not received a
[1:00:47] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:00:49] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:00:51] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen
[1:00:55] so either they're the that word adoption
[1:00:58] is the placing of sons so it's bringing
[1:01:01] us back into our position and we have
[1:01:04] not received as the Bible says a spirit
[1:01:06] of fear again to bondage and that word
[1:01:09] bondage means slavery
[1:01:12] a condition of a Slave
[1:01:15] we've not received that Spirit we've not
[1:01:18] received that Spirit we've not received
[1:01:20] a spirit of fear a spirit of hold but
[1:01:23] Satan would have a hold on us a spirit
[1:01:26] of slavery amen but we've received the
[1:01:28] spirit of adoption that God is placing
[1:01:31] me that he's bringing me into my
[1:01:33] position amen as a son or daughter of
[1:01:35] God Amen that I'm not living below my
[1:01:37] privileges
[1:01:39] amen break that slave mindset that Satan
[1:01:43] would put on you break that mindset that
[1:01:45] you're not good enough break that mind
[1:01:48] say that your mind said that you're not
[1:01:49] going to make it amen you are going to
[1:01:52] make it if you're a seed of God you're
[1:01:54] going back to the beginning and when the
[1:01:57] sea is going to return to itself amen
[1:01:59] the Sons and Daughters of God have
[1:02:01] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:02:04] we cry have a father
[1:02:07] father God
[1:02:08] I know I'm not good enough but you're
[1:02:10] worthy I'm not worthy but you're worthy
[1:02:13] right I know I'm not good enough but
[1:02:15] you're good enough your blood is good
[1:02:17] enough this morning and I don't have to
[1:02:19] live under fear that I'm not gonna make
[1:02:21] the Rapture that I'm not good enough
[1:02:22] amen he's made me good enough
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:31] we've heard the word
[1:02:33] we've heard the word
[1:02:35] amen this is our year of Jubilee
[1:02:38] you ain't got to wait on it we're living
[1:02:41] in the Year of Jubilee we're living
[1:02:43] under when the lamb has taken the book
[1:02:45] amen he's loose to seals he's opened up
[1:02:48] everything that we have need of we're
[1:02:50] living under that amen we're living
[1:02:52] under the sound of freedom
[1:02:56] shake the bondage
[1:02:58] shake the mindset that you're not a son
[1:03:00] or daughter of God
[1:03:02] shake that mindset of the world
[1:03:05] the world will try to drag you along
[1:03:07] with it
[1:03:11] the world will try to drag you down try
[1:03:13] to bring you with it
[1:03:15] and there's a hill waiting
[1:03:17] there's a hell waiting for the

[1:03:50] under the spirit of laodicea that
[1:03:53] lukewarm condition but let me discern

[1:03:58] withstand every evil spirit amen that
[1:04:01] would rise against us let us discern
[1:04:03] amen those are the evil spirits that
[1:04:05] would enter our homes let us discern and
[1:04:07] withstand anything that would come
[1:04:09] against the word
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] it's a glorious time for the believer
[1:04:19] it's a glorious time for the believer

[1:04:23] Redemption claims

[1:04:34] just for a moment here
[1:04:36] what brother Brown said
[1:04:38] because I believe it ties together
[1:04:40] because we're coming to a culmination as
[1:04:43] the song goes amen we're coming we're
[1:04:46] coming to the Head
[1:04:48] we're coming to the to the end of all

[1:05:09] Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us
[1:05:11] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:05:17] pleasure of his will
[1:05:21] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:05:23] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:05:25] Beloved
[1:05:27] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:05:29] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:05:32] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[1:05:35] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[1:05:37] and Prudence having made known unto us
[1:05:40] the mystery of his will and then we're
[1:05:42] living under the time of all Mysteries
[1:05:44] have been revealed everything's finished
[1:05:46] up

[1:05:56] has been finished we're at the finishing
[1:05:57] up of everything

[1:06:06] amen he purpose in himself amen amen
[1:06:09] Redemption all along

[1:06:14] of times he might gather together in one
[1:06:18] all things in Christ
[1:06:20] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:06:22] on earth even in him in whom we have
[1:06:26] obtained an inheritance being
[1:06:28] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:06:30] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:06:33] counsel of his own will
[1:06:36] so there in verse 10 it talks about the
[1:06:38] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:06:40] now he might Gather in Christ
[1:06:43] and brother Branham says here in
[1:06:45] adoption
[1:06:47] he says do you believe in dispensations
[1:06:49] the Bible said so in the dispensation of
[1:06:51] the fullness of time he said what is the
[1:06:54] fullness of time
[1:06:55] there's been a dispensation of well of
[1:06:57] Mosaic law the dispensation of John the
[1:07:01] Baptist
[1:07:02] there was a dispensation of Christ there
[1:07:05] was a dispensation of church
[1:07:07] organization and there was a
[1:07:09] dispensation of the outpouring of the
[1:07:11] Holy Spirit he said but now in the
[1:07:14] dispensation of adoption when the
[1:07:16] world's waiting groaning and when the
[1:07:19] fullness of time comes when the
[1:07:20] dispensation of that fullness of time he
[1:07:23] said what is it when the dead Rises
[1:07:26] when the sick ceases when all Earth
[1:07:29] ceases to groan the fullness of the
[1:07:32] dispensation of time
[1:07:34] so we're not living just under just a
[1:07:37] Revival we're not living we could go
[1:07:40] back in we're not living under the days
[1:07:41] of Christ
[1:07:43] amen we're not here to repeat what Jesus
[1:07:46] done
[1:07:47] amen verbatim Every Act what he done
[1:07:51] because those days are over right
[1:07:54] and so we have to move on from that we
[1:07:57] benefit from that and we have to have
[1:07:59] faith in that but we move on because God
[1:08:01] Amen is moving right the holy spirit is
[1:08:04] moving and so amen we're not even living
[1:08:07] under just an outpouring of the Holy
[1:08:09] Spirit
[1:08:10] we want an outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:12] we are beneficiaries of of that amen but
[1:08:17] also All Flesh is a beneficiary of that
[1:08:21] the weed and the tares amen they receive
[1:08:24] the same Reign they receive that same
[1:08:27] outpouring amen but there's something
[1:08:29] even beyond that there's something
[1:08:32] Beyond even just the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:34] Ghost in your own life but you've got to
[1:08:37] move on from that Amen to a maturing
[1:08:40] Amen to the fullness of time Amen to
[1:08:43] where God is bringing us in this
[1:08:45] Redemption plan amen not just a savior
[1:08:47] not just to clean you up not just to use
[1:08:49] you in this life fill you with the Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost amen but to change your body
[1:08:56] to bring you to the completeness under
[1:08:58] the Redemptive act under the claims that
[1:09:01] have been made upon you and I that if we
[1:09:04] live long enough
[1:09:05] that if we stay alive that we which are
[1:09:08] alive and remain
[1:09:09] amen shall not hinder this then which
[1:09:11] are asleep and under the fullness of
[1:09:14] times amen under the under this
[1:09:16] dispensation and when the church is
[1:09:18] moving up
[1:09:20] in the Holy Ghost series he said we've
[1:09:23] came from justification sanctification
[1:09:25] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:09:28] where God is going to unite or this
[1:09:31] church so much so much he's going to
[1:09:33] pour himself so much into her that the
[1:09:36] dead in Christ will raise and when they
[1:09:39] without us cannot be made perfect
[1:09:42] I believe that's what the message
[1:09:43] teaches I'm not looking for anybody to
[1:09:46] come back and call forth that
[1:09:48] Resurrection amen but as we near Christ
[1:09:50] amen the dead will raise as we near the
[1:09:54] fullness of times it can't help but take
[1:09:56] place
[1:09:58] thank you right
[1:10:04] I'm sorry that I'm yelling that
[1:10:08] but I wanted to be so real to myself
[1:10:11] I wanted to be more than just a head
[1:10:13] knowledge
[1:10:14] I don't want to be a reality that we're
[1:10:17] living in that time that there's no
[1:10:19] going back
[1:10:21] no time to turn back
[1:10:24] there's no time to look back we've got
[1:10:26] to look forward we've got to raise our
[1:10:29] raise our hands Lift Our Heads amen for
[1:10:33] our time and then when we see these
[1:10:34] things begin to come apart come to pass
[1:10:37] a turmoil amen the condition of
[1:10:39] everything
[1:10:40] when we see things moving into their
[1:10:42] place amen Jesus said lift up your head
[1:10:45] for your Redemption your redemptions are
[1:10:48] off nah amen God amen amen is going to
[1:10:51] bring you to that fullness of redemption
[1:10:57] the Holy Ghost Inside you that earnest
[1:11:01] the down payment's already been made
[1:11:04] you're going there
[1:11:07] we which are alive and remain
[1:11:11] if we're here
[1:11:12] if you're alive if I'm alive
[1:11:15] if the Lord tarries
[1:11:18] my children grow up yeah
[1:11:20] yeah they're going to be part of that
[1:11:22] body change
[1:11:23] that rapture
[1:11:25] they already are
[1:11:27] amen I believe that
[1:11:29] I believe we're living under under the
[1:11:30] token I believe we're living under the
[1:11:33] blood where the death angel if it's
[1:11:34] applied the death angel has to pass
[1:11:37] I believe under that token I believe we
[1:11:40] bring every every loved one with us
[1:11:43] I believe that
[1:11:45] I mean they didn't leave a hoof behind
[1:11:47] they didn't leave no one behind when
[1:11:48] they left Egypt but under under that
[1:11:51] blood amen and we're under that blood
[1:11:53] are we not is that what we believe is
[1:11:55] that what we've identified our lives
[1:11:57] with we're under that blood when we
[1:11:59] shall go forth
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:12] so the fullness of time
[1:12:14] brother Ram says here in adoption
[1:12:16] he says I have an inheritance an
[1:12:19] inheritance of eternal life
[1:12:21] now God sent Jesus to make that
[1:12:23] inheritance real to me
[1:12:25] because there was nothing I could do to
[1:12:27] inherit it it was blank it was valid
[1:12:30] there was nothing I could do but in the
[1:12:32] fullness of time God sent in his own
[1:12:34] good time Jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:12:37] foundation of the world his blood was
[1:12:40] shed that I might go to my inheritance
[1:12:43] to be what what inheritance the sonship
[1:12:46] to be the Son of God to be a Son of God
[1:12:49] as we said earlier if if you if you miss
[1:12:53] that if you're living below that
[1:12:55] privilege you're missing the whole thing
[1:12:57] you're missing the whole thing
[1:12:59] amen if you're just a good church member
[1:13:02] you're missing the whole thing
[1:13:04] to be a son
[1:13:06] amen under under that under that
[1:13:09] inheritance is your Authority is your
[1:13:12] rights
[1:13:13] is where you speak
[1:13:15] as a son
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:19] we're not just servants here
[1:13:22] we're sons and daughters
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:31] excuse me here
[1:13:35] amen so he sent his son
[1:13:37] Amen in the fullness of time then he
[1:13:40] said he goes on and said this might
[1:13:41] choke you to death but did you know that
[1:13:43] men that are the sons of God are amateur
[1:13:45] gods he said how many ever know that how
[1:13:48] many knows that Jesus said that did not
[1:13:50] your laws say itself that you are gods
[1:13:53] and if you call them Gods he said which
[1:13:55] in God said in Genesis 2 they were Gods
[1:13:58] because they were
[1:14:00] and so we're going back to Genesis right
[1:14:02] we're going back to Genesis they were
[1:14:04] gods of the earth they had full domain
[1:14:06] he said they had full domain and
[1:14:08] dominion over the world he give the
[1:14:10] Dominion them dominion over all things
[1:14:14] so that's what that's what you're going
[1:14:16] back to as a Son of God Amen if you've
[1:14:18] been restored back to that if you've
[1:14:21] come under that amen and they've got
[1:14:23] that Revelation that I'm a son of God
[1:14:27] you've got Dominion
[1:14:28] you have a domain
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:33] and we'll go on here we'll get into
[1:14:35] something here just a little bit
[1:14:37] but he talked about he said he lost his
[1:14:39] godship he lost his sonship he lost his
[1:14:42] domain Satan took it over he said but
[1:14:44] brother we're waiting for the
[1:14:45] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:14:48] will come back and take it over again
[1:14:50] waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:14:52] the pyramid gets to the top when the
[1:14:55] sons of God will be manifest when the
[1:14:57] power of God will walk out and take
[1:14:59] every Power that Satan's got away from

[1:17:01] in the foot for that
[1:17:04] we missed something maybe we'll get to
[1:17:05] it here
[1:17:07] the fundamental 1955 the fundamental
[1:17:10] foundation for faith
[1:17:11] he said we want to talk about the Son of
[1:17:14] God we're kind of going without a fallen
[1:17:16] Son of God
[1:17:18] I believe brother Joel mentioned this
[1:17:20] quote and not when he mentioned it I I
[1:17:21] had read this also
[1:17:23] brother Rob says no matter what a state
[1:17:26] a man's Inn yet he's a son of God
[1:17:30] no matter how sinful he is how far away
[1:17:33] he is how Fallen he is but yet he's a
[1:17:36] son and God is his Creator God is his
[1:17:39] maker and God has bought him with a
[1:17:42] price and he may never reconcile himself
[1:17:45] to that he may never accept it he may
[1:17:48] never do him any good
[1:17:50] but yet he's a son and she is a daughter
[1:17:52] of God
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:55] amen uh though
[1:17:58] bum you see up there down the road
[1:18:02] I know some of y'all seen him coming in
[1:18:04] that's the son of God
[1:18:07] that's the Son of God God made him to be
[1:18:09] a Son of God or whoever that was if it
[1:18:11] was a woman a daughter of God
[1:18:13] God made him that way and whether or not
[1:18:17] they accept it whether or not
[1:18:20] they come to it God has that for them
[1:18:23] God God made them to be that right and
[1:18:27] brother REM says here he said if we miss
[1:18:29] I always like to say if you miss being a
[1:18:32] son or daughter of God then you missed
[1:18:34] the mark yeah
[1:18:35] he said and to miss some more is the
[1:18:37] definition of sin he said when you're
[1:18:39] sitting in a gun and at 50 yards and
[1:18:42] you're you're you're driving tax
[1:18:44] but then you move out a couple hundred
[1:18:47] yards in your your five inches off he
[1:18:49] said you're off the target you've missed
[1:18:51] the mark he said but what you got to do
[1:18:53] you got to come back he said but if I
[1:18:56] miss I if I miss faith in God I've got
[1:18:58] to get tuned up he said there's
[1:19:00] something wrong if I miss faith in God
[1:19:03] he said if I miss being a Christian I
[1:19:05] need to come back and be tuned up I say
[1:19:08] this morning if you if you miss being a
[1:19:10] son or daughter of God you're living
[1:19:11] below your privileges you're living
[1:19:13] below where God
[1:19:15] amen what God made you to be
[1:19:18] and then for God put us here to be that
[1:19:20] to worship Him
[1:19:22] to live for him that's what God designed
[1:19:24] man for in the beginning
[1:19:26] if you're off to one side if I'm off to
[1:19:28] one side I need to come back and be
[1:19:30] tuned up by the scripture by the word
[1:19:35] what says here in John 1 I always love
[1:19:39] this scripture he was in the world and
[1:19:43] the world was made by him and the world
[1:19:44] knew him not
[1:19:46] and he came unto his own in his own
[1:19:48] received him not
[1:19:50] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:19:52] he power to become the sons of God I
[1:19:56] couldn't do it on my own I couldn't
[1:19:58] inherit it myself amen but he gave power
[1:20:01] to those that received him
[1:20:04] those those that he came to rejected him
[1:20:07] but as many as received him as many as
[1:20:09] they can receive the word for their day
[1:20:11] amen amen to them gives he power to
[1:20:15] become the sons of God
[1:20:18] eminent and sons of God even to them
[1:20:21] that believe on his name and it goes on
[1:20:23] which we're born not of blood nor of the
[1:20:26] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:20:28] but of God
[1:20:30] amen he gave me power it wasn't my power
[1:20:33] but he gave me power I've got no power
[1:20:36] of my own Amen to come into anything
[1:20:38] amen but there's a power available
[1:20:41] there's a power available
[1:20:43] you can live beat down I'm gonna go back
[1:20:46] to this you can live beat down you can
[1:20:48] live depressed every day of your life
[1:20:51] but if you'll come to an identification
[1:20:54] that I'm a Son of God if you'll let that
[1:20:57] come to you if you if you'll stay quiet
[1:20:59] long enough if you'll get out of the
[1:21:01] pity party long enough and let God come
[1:21:04] down and tell you that you're my son
[1:21:06] that you're my daughter and I give unto
[1:21:08] you my power I give you back your
[1:21:10] Authority that's what you were made for
[1:21:13] you weren't made to live defeated you
[1:21:15] were made to live Victorious
[1:21:18] amen when God done that for me it's
[1:21:20] changed my life ever since before that I
[1:21:23] I'll be honest with our struggle with a
[1:21:25] had the holy ghost or not you're up and
[1:21:28] down you're in and you're out you're a
[1:21:30] Judas one day and you're a Son of God
[1:21:31] the next you don't know but if you'll
[1:21:34] get still just just for one moment if
[1:21:36] you'll come into His presence and let
[1:21:38] him seek that reality in it'll change
[1:21:40] your life
[1:21:42] and through the ups and downs and
[1:21:44] they're going to come every day there's
[1:21:46] ups and downs there's no no telling what
[1:21:48] we'll face but it'll be your stay amen
[1:21:51] he'll be the captain of the ship
[1:21:53] he'll be the one that calms the wind in
[1:21:55] your life
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] I can't go out there and calm no wind
[1:22:02] I'd go out here and I could holler at
[1:22:04] the wind all day
[1:22:06] but if God speaks that through me
[1:22:09] the Holy Ghost speaks that through you
[1:22:11] you can speak to the storm yes
[1:22:14] you can holler at the cold weather all
[1:22:16] you want
[1:22:17] there's nothing going to change
[1:22:20] but if God speaks it through you
[1:22:23] if you need it
[1:22:24] it will be there
[1:22:27] we're coming to that fullness of
[1:22:28] adoption
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:34] amen so we were able to receive him
[1:22:37] amen receive the word for your day
[1:22:39] brother run said that's the evidence of
[1:22:40] the Holy Ghost right
[1:22:42] if you can if you can receive the word
[1:22:44] for your day
[1:22:46] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:47] when the spirit of truth comes he shall
[1:22:50] show you all things
[1:22:54] and so we were able to receive that we
[1:22:56] were in his thinking from the beginning
[1:22:59] amen you say you're really talking
[1:23:01] yourself up that's what the prophet told
[1:23:03] me that's what the Bible tells me I'm
[1:23:06] gonna I'm gonna believe what the
[1:23:07] messenger told me about myself that's
[1:23:10] all I can believe I can't go listen to
[1:23:12] so and so on the internet and some some
[1:23:15] Big Time mega church preacher and they
[1:23:18] could have awesome preaching
[1:23:20] that's not what that's not their worship
[1:23:22] that we're under yeah that's not the
[1:23:24] anointing that we're under we could have
[1:23:26] an outpouring here today the church down
[1:23:28] the road could have an outpouring
[1:23:30] because the rain falls on the just in
[1:23:32] the unjust but the word has come to you
[1:23:34] and I and we understand amen where we're
[1:23:37] going
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:43] that's good

[1:23:48] power to become the sons of God it's

[1:24:00] to them gave he power
[1:24:02] Authority
[1:24:04] it gives you the right it gives you the
[1:24:07] Liberty it gives you the jurisdiction
[1:24:09] and the strength amen now now you're
[1:24:12] coming back you're coming back to what
[1:24:14] Adam lost that power is a son of God
[1:24:19] Amen brother Brown says here in the Seal
[1:24:20] of God
[1:24:22] he says but as many as received him gave

[1:26:06] he said and I'll say here that now
[1:26:10] we've become the manifested attributes
[1:26:13] we are the thoughts of God we were in
[1:26:16] him in the beginning amen we were in him
[1:26:19] in the beginning so we had to come back
[1:26:21] amen we had to come back under
[1:26:23] Redemption claim if you're a son or
[1:26:25] daughter of God he's not going to lose
[1:26:26] you amen the son of man came to seek and
[1:26:29] save that which was lost
[1:26:32] right yes and I always like this here in
[1:26:35] the church ages where the room said we
[1:26:37] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:26:41] were seed and therefore we were reborn
[1:26:43] for only the elect can be reborn because
[1:26:47] we were seed is the reason we could be
[1:26:50] quick and amen there's there's Fallen
[1:26:52] sons of God there's Fallen sons of God
[1:26:55] Walk in this Earth but if there's not
[1:26:57] something in there to Quicken buy
[1:26:59] predestination nothing will happen
[1:27:03] and they may become a good church member
[1:27:05] you understand they may go on and be in
[1:27:07] heaven they they there is a place for
[1:27:10] that amen but as the seed of God and I
[1:27:13] believe that's who I'm preaching to here
[1:27:15] today amen you didn't become something
[1:27:17] you always were something and the Holy
[1:27:20] Ghost amen the sea within you that Holy
[1:27:23] Ghost was there to Quicken that it was
[1:27:25] laying in there all your life you knew
[1:27:27] you were different you knew you knew you
[1:27:30] you knew better
[1:27:31] you knew better
[1:27:33] come on you're taught better even if you
[1:27:35] weren't taught better you knew you were
[1:27:37] different if you're a seed of God and
[1:27:39] you can identify with that this morning
[1:27:40] amen you never you were different you
[1:27:42] knew you you shouldn't be doing those
[1:27:44] things
[1:27:46] amen but one day a predestinated moment
[1:27:49] to a predestinated seed of God in you
[1:27:52] amen amen you didn't you weren't you
[1:27:55] weren't just reborn for any old reason
[1:27:56] you didn't just come to it like that
[1:27:58] amen amen because of the sea within you
[1:28:01] you could be born again
[1:28:05] the seed's not there and nothing to
[1:28:07] Quicken
[1:28:09] there's nothing to bring that forth Amen
[1:28:12] in the the grain the grain is going back
[1:28:15] to itself again it has come to itself
[1:28:17] again
[1:28:18] the grain that went down in the first
[1:28:21] church age it has come back to itself
[1:28:23] again
[1:28:24] right yes and this thought that we said
[1:28:27] earlier amen we're going back to what
[1:28:29] Adam lost we're going back to Genesis
[1:28:31] we're going back to that Eden because
[1:28:34] everything everything that had a
[1:28:36] beginning every seed every every every
[1:28:38] Doctrine every church every cult every
[1:28:41] every idea
[1:28:42] began in Genesis
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:45] and so so we're going back
[1:28:48] yeah we're going back to that but I'm
[1:28:51] going back hey man I'm not going I'm not
[1:28:52] just going back so far I'm going back
[1:28:54] all the way
[1:28:56] the seed of God Amen within me that life
[1:28:58] within me has taken me all the way back
[1:29:00] I'm not going to pick back up where Adam

[1:29:05] fell and get back into the mess again
[1:29:07] amen before going back amen before Adam
[1:29:09] fell before Satan got his greasy old
[1:29:12] hands on our life amen amen and amen in
[1:29:15] the message teaches that we're going to
[1:29:16] live out that day amen we're going to go

[1:29:20] out we're going to live a thousand years
[1:29:21] amen during a millennial Reign amen

[1:29:28] ruler upon this Earth amen he's gonna
[1:29:30] sit amen
[1:29:32] and there will be peace
[1:29:35] remember there's got to be a peace here
[1:29:37] this morning there's got to be a peace
[1:29:39] he's got to be the ruler on your heart
[1:29:40] but got to be an Eden in your heart now
[1:29:52] and brother Brown goes on here to say
[1:29:53] and we look at what did Adam lose
[1:29:56] he had perfect Fellowship
[1:29:58] when we go on here brother Brown says
[1:30:00] now in the beginning when God made man
[1:30:01] to worship Him Live and live God taking
[1:30:04] care of him fed him man had a perfect
[1:30:07] fellowship with God there was nothing
[1:30:09] wrong and God come down it's a beautiful
[1:30:11] picture this just listen to it God came
[1:30:14] down in the evening and talked to Adam
[1:30:16] and Eve what a beautiful picture no harm
[1:30:19] nothing could harm them no sickness
[1:30:21] could ever come to them they didn't even
[1:30:23] know what sickness was they didn't know
[1:30:25] what old age was they didn't know what
[1:30:27] being hurt was they couldn't be hurt
[1:30:30] they was in the presence of the
[1:30:32] omnipotent powers of God
[1:30:35] which held them in control and guided
[1:30:37] them by a spirit there was nothing that
[1:30:39] could harm them
[1:30:41] what a beautiful picture that is
[1:30:43] if you look at that picture their God
[1:30:46] God and man had perfect Fellowship amen
[1:30:49] a man was made to worship and have
[1:30:52] communion with his creator that's what
[1:30:54] we were designed to be and how he would
[1:30:56] come there brother around the Scout
[1:30:57] described it he would come down the cool
[1:30:59] of the evening he would take care of
[1:31:01] them
[1:31:02] they knew no harm they knew nothing they
[1:31:04] knew no sickness they knew no worry they
[1:31:07] knew no stress they knew nothing because
[1:31:09] father God was there communing with them
[1:31:11] in this condition amen
[1:31:14] this hidden condition
[1:31:16] amen there amen he just he just loved to
[1:31:20] talk with his children I mean he still
[1:31:22] loves to talk to you and take care of
[1:31:25] you today amen and he does that today
[1:31:27] what a picture
[1:31:30] and you could say
[1:31:32] well that picture just isn't quite clear
[1:31:35] on this one to me if I'm redeemed then
[1:31:39] why do I have troubles
[1:31:41] if what what you're saying is that we've
[1:31:45] been brought back to what Adam was why
[1:31:47] why do I have troubles why why do I have
[1:31:50] sickness but it's because of the Fall
[1:31:53] it's because of the fall and now God can
[1:31:56] come and express himself in a greater
[1:31:59] way than he could even to Adam and Eve
[1:32:01] for God can come down in your broken
[1:32:03] heart he can come down in your sickness
[1:32:06] and amen and be the Lord God that heals
[1:32:08] all thy diseases he can come into your
[1:32:11] trouble and be be your deliverer it can
[1:32:14] be your Hiding Place amen
[1:32:16] but the picture it just doesn't may not
[1:32:20] look right to you but it's coming
[1:32:21] together it's coming together as the
[1:32:24] fullness of time goes on as we worship
[1:32:26] under Redemption and as we as we live
[1:32:28] under Redemption claims amen we're going
[1:32:31] back to where the picture is going to be
[1:32:33] made clear again
[1:32:35] amen we're going to be known as we are
[1:32:37] known
[1:32:39] amen when we see him we shall be lock
[1:32:41] him
[1:32:42] there's more change that's got to take
[1:32:44] place
[1:32:45] there's more there's more there's more
[1:32:47] to it and remember we're walking in it
[1:32:49] we're walking in it
[1:32:57] amen so
[1:33:00] we may not be able to
[1:33:03] to have the picture just quiet exactly
[1:33:05] like they had it we may not be able to
[1:33:07] come here this service
[1:33:09] or whenever at your home and and paint
[1:33:12] it just exactly like they had it where
[1:33:14] everything's perfect
[1:33:16] but I believe we can come here today I
[1:33:18] believe we can come and we we're sitting
[1:33:20] together here in Heavenly places
[1:33:23] I believe the holy spirit is bringing us
[1:33:25] a power yes I believe it's bringing us
[1:33:27] to our position I believe it's showing
[1:33:30] us more and more of who we are and who
[1:33:32] he is amen as that happens the picture
[1:33:35] becomes clear and clearer amen is as to
[1:33:39] where when it becomes so clear
[1:33:42] there will be changed in a moment in the
[1:33:44] twinkle of an eye
[1:33:46] I'm not closing yet

[1:34:09] for the fullness of adoption this will
[1:34:11] take place when at the first
[1:34:13] resurrection
[1:34:15] that's when our bodies will be changed
[1:34:16] from these vile creatures that we we are
[1:34:18] and we'll have a body like his own Glory
[1:34:21] spotting
[1:34:22] for we shall see him as he is and we
[1:34:24] shall be like him and when he appears we
[1:34:27] are we will appear in his alikeness we
[1:34:29] will have a body like his a glorious

[1:34:36] midst and blow away Amen to be no more
