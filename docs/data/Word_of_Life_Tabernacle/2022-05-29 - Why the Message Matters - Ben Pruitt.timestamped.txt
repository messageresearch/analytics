[49:41] and then we'll go to the word in just a
[49:43] minute i
[49:44] just wanted to talk to you for a minute
[49:46] we've been gone on vacation
[49:49] for a few days i guess it's a vacation
[49:51] when you take your kids to branson
[49:53] that's not much of a vacation but
[49:56] for us but that's what we did and
[49:58] it was a vacation for the children
[50:00] anyway they got out of school and were
[50:02] able to
[50:03] uh to go
[50:04] and do that and so i'm sure they enjoyed
[50:06] it and i did too just getting away
[50:08] sometimes you need to take a
[50:10] service off and i'm so thankful to have
[50:12] ministry here that we can
[50:14] trust to be able to come and
[50:16] and take care of the services and so we
[50:18] appreciate that
[50:20] but we're back in the saddle now and
[50:22] we've got some several things coming up
[50:25] uh i know there's several gone this
[50:26] morning and some of them have good
[50:28] excuses and some of them are on vacation
[50:30] so
[50:31] but uh
[50:32] i can't say much can't i because we just
[50:34] come off but uh it's kind of that
[50:36] weekend so we'll only have one service
[50:38] today
[50:39] uh but uh but joe i can't figure out
[50:42] when you're gonna be gone and when
[50:43] you're gonna be here so
[50:45] i'm just gonna assume brother joe's
[50:46] gonna be here until further notice i
[50:49] i've been thinking he's gonna be gone
[50:50] for the last month
[50:52] and he always shows up it's like a bad
[50:54] penny so
[50:55] we're uh
[50:57] we're happy to have brother joe
[50:59] and
[51:00] it's always good to see uh each one of
[51:03] you and i miss you when you're not here
[51:04] and i'm sure you miss me as well so we
[51:07] appreciate you being here but those that
[51:09] aren't here i know several of them on
[51:11] vacation to different things and they
[51:12] schedule that every year
[51:14] and that that's a blessing to be able to
[51:16] spend some time with your family but
[51:17] it's also a blessing to be together and
[51:20] spend time in the word but tuesday night
[51:22] if you're not here and you're listening
[51:24] our service this week will be on tuesday
[51:26] night instead of wednesday
[51:28] so everybody's got that tuesday night
[51:30] brother andrew glover is going to be
[51:32] here and so you won't want to miss that
[51:34] maybe you're not usually able to come on
[51:35] wednesdays but if you just find a way
[51:38] uh to be here on wednesday or tuesday
[51:40] night that would be a wonderful a
[51:42] wonderful thing and so he'll be here
[51:45] on tuesday night i know we don't like
[51:47] change but that won't be permanent just
[51:49] this week
[51:50] we'll do that and to accommodate
[51:53] his schedule i try to have brother
[51:54] andrew in a like a lot he's been a a

[53:33] brother ben why are you so busy what are
[53:35] you trying to do because the lord is
[53:36] coming
[53:37] we don't have very long say well they've
[53:38] been saying that for years but i believe
[53:40] it today he said occupy till i come so
[53:43] we're going to occupy until he comes
[53:45] we're going to stay busy and keep doing
[53:47] what we can for the kingdom of god amen
[53:49] let's stand together
[53:52] and we'll read from john chapter 1 and
[53:54] verse 10 actually verses 10 through 12
[53:56] and then romans 12 1 and 2.
[54:03] john chapter 1 verses 10 and 11 or 10
[54:07] through 12 and romans 12 1
[54:09] and 2
[54:10] it says he was in the world
[54:13] and the world was made by him
[54:16] and the world knew him not
[54:19] can you imagine coming to your own
[54:20] creation and not being known by
[54:23] that was our god
[54:25] he came unto his own his own received
[54:27] him not
[54:29] but as many as received him
[54:32] to them gave he power
[54:34] to become the sons of god
[54:37] even to them that believe
[54:39] on his name amen romans chapter 12 and
[54:42] verse 1
[54:43] he said i beseech you therefore brethren
[54:45] by the mercies of god that you present
[54:48] your bodies a living sacrifice
[54:51] holy acceptable unto god
[54:54] which is your reasonable
[54:56] service
[54:57] and be not conformed to this world
[55:00] but be transformed so there's a power
[55:03] on the earth today that can transform
[55:06] you
[55:06] not just conform to the world but
[55:08] transform by the renewing of your mind
[55:12] that you may prove what is that good
[55:14] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[55:18] in other words that that will could be
[55:19] manifested
[55:21] in our lives i pray that it would be so
[55:22] let's bow our heads together
[55:25] heavenly father we're so thankful to be
[55:26] in your presence again today and
[55:29] art as we think about this memorial day
[55:31] weekend and
[55:32] how we have a memory lord of those that
[55:34] have gone on especially those who have
[55:36] fought and have died
[55:38] for political freedom
[55:40] or today we also remember you and what
[55:43] you did for us there on the cross and
[55:45] how
[55:46] lord that you died for our freedom and
[55:48] so we could have our freedom in the
[55:50] spirit today lord and that you would
[55:52] come not only that you died for us but
[55:55] that you poured your spirit out upon us
[55:57] on the day of pentecost so that we could
[55:59] be
[56:00] become a tree of life a bride tree that
[56:03] could grow up lord we're so thankful for
[56:05] that today we're so thankful for these
[56:07] people that have gathered together i
[56:09] pray that you'd move in each and every
[56:11] life and every heart lord though there's
[56:13] just a smaller than usual number lord
[56:16] this morning yet we believe that you're
[56:18] still god would you just come and meet
[56:20] us here today lord just be with us
[56:23] throughout this day and we'll give you
[56:25] all the praise and the glory and the
[56:26] honor in jesus name amen amen god bless
[56:30] you you can be seated
[56:33] thank you for bearing with me
[56:37] i heard a story of a judge who'd been
[56:39] frequently
[56:41] ridiculed by a conceited lawyer and he
[56:44] was asked by a friend why he didn't ever
[56:46] rebuke him
[56:48] and he said this he said
[56:51] you know in our town there's a widow
[56:52] woman who has a dog
[56:55] and whenever the moon shines the dog
[56:57] goes outside and barks all night
[57:00] and
[57:01] he just started talking about something
[57:03] else and the man finally asked that
[57:05] judge
[57:06] said what about the dog and the moon you
[57:08] never finished the story
[57:10] he said oh he said the moon went on
[57:12] shining
[57:16] and and so sometimes it doesn't do a
[57:18] whole lot of good to respond to critics
[57:21] because we're the moon we're the
[57:22] reflection of jesus christ on the earth
[57:26] this message has many critics and
[57:29] as the lord began to put this on my
[57:30] heart this week as we were gone i
[57:32] began to think about it and i didn't
[57:34] really understand why
[57:36] i was moving in this direction this
[57:38] morning but i found out uh later in the
[57:40] week that there was a
[57:42] a number
[57:44] of people in west tennessee
[57:46] that have been affected and what they've
[57:48] been doing is people who don't believe
[57:49] the message have been
[57:51] targeting churches and pastors and
[57:54] they'll take a pastor's
[57:56] videos and they'll take them and splice
[57:58] them together that make it seem like
[57:59] he's harsh or or saying something that
[58:02] wouldn't be politically correct and then
[58:04] they'll
[58:06] they'll start mailing and calling each
[58:08] member of the church actually find out
[58:10] who the members are and these are people
[58:12] who used to be in the message and have
[58:14] become disaffected and they've done that
[58:16] in a couple of churches in west
[58:18] tennessee and they've been getting
[58:20] around to the people and trying to make
[58:21] them so doubt in the people's minds
[58:23] about the message of the hour
[58:25] and not knowing that but the lord had
[58:27] begun to lay this on my heart that
[58:29] why the message matters why does it
[58:31] matter we we're going to have critics
[58:33] there's going to be
[58:35] people who will tell you that well we
[58:36] should just move beyond that we don't
[58:38] need the message anymore we we can say
[58:41] the things brother branham said but
[58:42] we'll just leave that out of it we don't
[58:44] want to offend nobody we don't want to
[58:46] we don't want to push people into
[58:47] thinking or some kind of a cult or
[58:49] something like that but the truth is
[58:51] they're always going to think that it's
[58:52] just always going to be that way but the
[58:54] message still
[58:56] matters today there's always going to be
[58:58] critics john 15 and 19
[59:01] jesus speaking to his disciples he said
[59:03] if you were of the world the world would
[59:05] love its own
[59:07] there there's a reason why they don't
[59:08] love us because we're not of the world
[59:11] he said but because you're not of the
[59:13] world but i have chosen you out of the
[59:16] world therefore the world hates you
[59:19] you want to know why the world doesn't
[59:21] like christians you don't want to know
[59:22] why the world doesn't like message
[59:25] believers specifically you want to know
[59:26] why especially the world doesn't like
[59:29] those who live it
[59:30] those who really live it not just say it
[59:32] but live it the world don't like you
[59:34] because you're not of them and it's
[59:36] evident and the farther we go along the
[59:39] lines get farther and farther away of
[59:41] what a christian looks like and what a
[59:43] christian acts like compared to what the
[59:45] world is
[59:47] and i'll be honest with you i don't want
[59:49] it there to be any mix-up i don't want
[59:51] to be anything like the world we're at
[59:53] the end time there's a group that's
[59:55] going up and there's a group that's
[59:56] staying here i don't want to be the
[59:58] group that stays here you say well i
[1:00:00] could be a foolish virgin well there
[1:00:02] will be many who will be saved through
[1:00:03] the tribulation period but i'll be
[1:00:05] honest with you i don't want to go
[1:00:06] through the tribulation period have you
[1:00:08] read the book of revelation have you
[1:00:10] read some of the things that are coming
[1:00:11] on the earth i don't want anything to do
[1:00:13] with that i don't want my kids to have
[1:00:15] anything to do with that i don't want to
[1:00:17] be a part of that i want to be a member
[1:00:19] of the bride i want to be one that's got
[1:00:21] his robes washed and white and been
[1:00:23] given a white robe i want to be one of
[1:00:25] those
[1:00:26] i want to be one of them and so and so i
[1:00:28] don't care what the world thinks in that
[1:00:30] way yes we want to we want to do
[1:00:32] everything we can to make sure that
[1:00:34] we're the faults are not our own that
[1:00:36] we're not being criticized because if
[1:00:37] they criticize you peter said for the
[1:00:39] things that you do
[1:00:41] then you were you you deserved it
[1:00:44] right but if they criticized you for the
[1:00:45] word's sake
[1:00:47] then you just go on because you know
[1:00:49] they criticized him too
[1:00:52] amen so in john 15 21 he says but all
[1:00:55] these things will they do unto you
[1:00:58] why for my name's sake
[1:01:00] because they know not him
[1:01:03] that sent me amen
[1:01:05] oh my they they don't hate the message
[1:01:08] because they
[1:01:09] because they hate because they hate us
[1:01:11] necessarily they hate the message
[1:01:13] because
[1:01:14] they hate him they don't even realize
[1:01:16] they don't know him
[1:01:20] they didn't know him when he came
[1:01:22] they know not him that sent me
[1:01:24] and so we'll be asked the question does
[1:01:26] the message of uh that we call the
[1:01:29] message of the hour or we can say the
[1:01:30] message of william branham which it's
[1:01:32] really not
[1:01:33] it's the message of christ and we'll go
[1:01:35] into that
[1:01:37] but does it still matter
[1:01:39] is it outdated
[1:01:40] why did we need it in the first place
[1:01:43] and we've addressed some of those things
[1:01:44] before so i won't go over it
[1:01:47] in a comprehensive way this morning but
[1:01:49] these are questions that will be asked
[1:01:51] and
[1:01:52] the message matters
[1:01:55] and the reason the the main reason that
[1:01:57] the message matters is because the
[1:01:59] message is
[1:02:01] christ
[1:02:03] the message is
[1:02:04] christ and so brother madam tells us
[1:02:07] that in the token he said we're not come
[1:02:08] together to talk about the message right
[1:02:11] it's not just something we talk about
[1:02:14] we're come to get in the message
[1:02:16] right and the message is
[1:02:19] christ
[1:02:20] he is the word
[1:02:23] so we're not talking about just the
[1:02:25] messages not books and tapes literal
[1:02:27] books and tapes
[1:02:29] the message is not a symbol or a picture
[1:02:33] or even a person in the sense of a
[1:02:35] person of the earth but the message is
[1:02:38] the person of christ
[1:02:39] and he is the word
[1:02:42] so now brother branham said look what
[1:02:43] we've seen in this day the quickening
[1:02:45] power has come to us aren't you glad for
[1:02:47] that quickening power you know what that
[1:02:49] means that's not difficult to understand
[1:02:51] the power that makes you alive
[1:02:53] to be quicker than the scripture means
[1:02:55] to be alive
[1:02:56] when you're alive you're not dead
[1:02:58] yes well that's deep isn't it
[1:03:00] when you're alive you you you have
[1:03:03] movement
[1:03:04] yes right you're not sitting there like
[1:03:06] a bump on a log you got movement when
[1:03:07] you're alive
[1:03:09] the quickening power has come to us amen
[1:03:12] that's what this message is it's not
[1:03:14] word only it's not just a legalistic
[1:03:17] reading of the word but it's alive
[1:03:20] it's alive it's powerful it's able to
[1:03:23] quicken it's able to discern the
[1:03:24] thoughts and intents of the heart the
[1:03:26] quickening power has come to us to open
[1:03:28] the seven seals
[1:03:30] he said what was that he said the
[1:03:32] intelligence of a man no the quickening
[1:03:34] power of god he said see the quickening
[1:03:37] power of god foretold this would take
[1:03:39] place
[1:03:40] the quickening power of god made the
[1:03:42] world testify to it now he's talking now
[1:03:44] about the cloud and that's where much of
[1:03:46] the criticism comes from is the cloud
[1:03:48] and the cloud to me is very simple
[1:03:51] who's picked whose face was it
[1:03:54] right it was christ
[1:03:56] that's what it was it represented
[1:03:58] something
[1:03:59] and it's not about you say well did this
[1:04:01] happen on a certain day or what that's
[1:04:03] not what it was about brother branham
[1:04:05] didn't even know it when it happened
[1:04:07] right but months later he comes and gets
[1:04:09] a picture of it and the angel the lord
[1:04:11] said turn it to the right
[1:04:13] and when he turned it he saw whose face
[1:04:15] it was
[1:04:16] so it meant something to us they saw it
[1:04:19] and it didn't mean anything to him right
[1:04:21] right but brother branham didn't see it
[1:04:23] in his group and yet he knew something
[1:04:25] had happened he was there when the
[1:04:26] angels came to him but he didn't see the
[1:04:28] cloud
[1:04:29] but then
[1:04:30] that when he saw it in the picture of it
[1:04:32] he knew what it was
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] so no we're not we're not i'm not
[1:04:38] interested in a discussion about who was
[1:04:40] on what day and all of those things
[1:04:42] because that's not what it's about right
[1:04:45] you're mistaking what it's about it
[1:04:46] wasn't about brother branham and when he
[1:04:48] was hunting
[1:04:50] right it's about christ
[1:04:53] it's a sign that the quickening power
[1:04:54] came to open the seals he said the
[1:04:57] quickening power of god made the world
[1:04:59] testify to it that it's the truth the
[1:05:01] angel of the lord i told you was around
[1:05:03] in a pillar of fire quickening power
[1:05:05] that the world testifies the truth he
[1:05:07] said what does that mean to me well if
[1:05:08] the pillar of fire was around then
[1:05:11] and the people couldn't see it it's
[1:05:12] around today
[1:05:14] the pillar of fire hasn't left the earth
[1:05:16] it can't leave the earth if at least
[1:05:18] that means the holy ghost is gone
[1:05:20] right and so the pillar of fire is still
[1:05:22] here today
[1:05:23] why did god let us see it why do you why
[1:05:25] did he allow the picture to be taken why
[1:05:27] did he allow the cloud to be formed the
[1:05:29] way that it was however it was formed he
[1:05:31] allowed it to be that way why did god
[1:05:33] allow it oh my he allowed it because he
[1:05:35] knew there would be a people on the
[1:05:37] earth that needed to know that christ is
[1:05:39] here
[1:05:40] that you would face such a difficult
[1:05:42] time that you would face the end of all
[1:05:44] times when the tribulation was coming
[1:05:46] off he knew there would be a people on
[1:05:48] the earth who would be so persecuted and
[1:05:50] so afflicted and the mental battle would
[1:05:52] be so strong he knew there would be a
[1:05:54] people that needed to see that jesus was
[1:05:56] still alive
[1:05:58] oh do you believe it today do you
[1:06:00] believe he's still alive he's the same
[1:06:02] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:04] amen he he said we knew he said i told
[1:06:07] you it was around in a pillar of fire
[1:06:09] quickening power let the world testify
[1:06:10] that it's the truth and in that they
[1:06:12] didn't know what it was
[1:06:14] but we knew
[1:06:15] just look this away it's our lord up
[1:06:18] there
[1:06:19] amen he is the one
[1:06:21] he said who opened those seals
[1:06:24] he goes further he said he is those
[1:06:26] seals yes sir yes
[1:06:28] he is those seals why because the seals
[1:06:31] on the book the book was him
[1:06:34] and the book was us because we're part
[1:06:36] of him
[1:06:38] does that make sense
[1:06:39] the book was him and the book was us
[1:06:41] because it's part of him the book was
[1:06:42] the word he was the word we are the word
[1:06:46] if we're a part of him not this flesh
[1:06:48] but the inner man
[1:06:51] the flesh will never be saved
[1:06:53] but the inner man is
[1:06:55] amen the inner man comes and takes
[1:06:58] control
[1:06:59] amen becomes the control tower of the
[1:07:00] flesh now he said they didn't know what
[1:07:02] it was but we knew
[1:07:04] he said he's the one who opened those
[1:07:06] fields he is those seals for the whole
[1:07:07] word of god is christ
[1:07:09] and christ is the seals that was opened
[1:07:12] you realize why the message matters
[1:07:15] christ is the seals that was open yes
[1:07:18] you want to fight and quibble about what
[1:07:20] dates if brother ben have told a story
[1:07:22] one way and then told it another way
[1:07:24] i've told some stories here several
[1:07:26] different ways since i've been here you
[1:07:27] know why because i'm human
[1:07:30] sometimes i told a story here one day
[1:07:32] and i walked outside and my wife said
[1:07:33] you got that wrong
[1:07:36] it was a story about her
[1:07:40] and i got some of the details wrong but
[1:07:42] i was trying to make a point with it
[1:07:44] yeah and the point was well made i might
[1:07:46] add
[1:07:48] all right but i didn't get all the
[1:07:49] details right
[1:07:50] because i'm human yeah if you want to
[1:07:52] come and send me something in the mail
[1:07:54] and come and tell me and
[1:07:56] build a website tell me brother brandon
[1:07:57] was human you didn't have to do that i
[1:07:59] already knew that yeah
[1:08:02] tell me that he was a preacher like i am
[1:08:04] i know what it's like to be a preacher
[1:08:06] and to be tired and stumble over your
[1:08:07] words and i know what it's like to not
[1:08:09] be able to speak eloquently but i also
[1:08:11] know what it's like when the power of
[1:08:13] god comes down and you know it's not you
[1:08:16] speaking but it's god's speaking
[1:08:19] and he was a prophet even above even
[1:08:21] just a regular ministry he had a
[1:08:23] ministry that he heard direct from god
[1:08:25] like moses flipped to ear
[1:08:27] yes
[1:08:29] i'll listen to that yes yes
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:34] so now
[1:08:35] he's the one he is those seals the whole
[1:08:37] word of god is christ and christ is the
[1:08:39] seal that was open and so what is the
[1:08:41] opening of seals then revealing christ
[1:08:44] amen he said in the very seven angels
[1:08:47] which represented the seven churches all
[1:08:49] completed he said and we couldn't even
[1:08:51] see it they did they took the picture
[1:08:54] not us and there he is standing there
[1:08:56] supreme judge showing that he is alpha
[1:08:59] and omega the beginning and
[1:09:02] the end
[1:09:04] oh my listen it's christ yeah it's not
[1:09:06] about a man right it's not about
[1:09:09] men it's not about a bunch of preachers
[1:09:11] it's not about a bunch of just a bunch
[1:09:13] of people but it's about christ
[1:09:16] christ in a man christ in the people
[1:09:19] you understand now he said i wasn't the
[1:09:21] one that appeared down on the river
[1:09:24] i was only standing there when he
[1:09:25] appeared
[1:09:27] oh i love the way the prophet put it he
[1:09:29] said i'm not the one that performs these
[1:09:31] things and foretells these things it
[1:09:33] happens as perfect as they are
[1:09:36] he said i'm only one that's near when he
[1:09:39] does it
[1:09:41] oh my all the other all the other
[1:09:44] ministries healing ministries of that
[1:09:45] day would say come see the man of the
[1:09:47] hour come see the anointed man of god
[1:09:50] who's able to speak and and able to
[1:09:52] discern and able to do all of these
[1:09:53] things and here come a man with a true
[1:09:55] gift who come out and said it's not me
[1:10:00] i'm completely helpless until he shows
[1:10:02] up yes sir
[1:10:04] oh we would learn a lot from following
[1:10:06] that from imitating that example yes we
[1:10:08] we're completely helpless until he shows
[1:10:10] up many times we mess things up and i've
[1:10:13] often found i'm finding more and more as
[1:10:15] you counsel with people about what
[1:10:16] should i do what should i do well many
[1:10:18] times the best thing to do is not to do
[1:10:22] does that make sense the best thing to
[1:10:23] do is not to do not to not because you
[1:10:26] start messing stuff up
[1:10:27] many times what you ought to do is just
[1:10:29] sit back and wait and see what god does
[1:10:32] and then follow the word and god will
[1:10:34] lead you he said he'll put he said don't
[1:10:35] think about what you're going to say
[1:10:37] don't stress about it don't don't be
[1:10:39] anxious about it say well how will i
[1:10:40] speak to my children how will i talk to
[1:10:42] those around me about the message of the
[1:10:44] hour don't overthink it don't stress it
[1:10:46] you just live your life out in front of
[1:10:48] them and there will be an opportunity
[1:10:50] one day that you can begin to speak life
[1:10:52] into their hearts that's right
[1:10:54] because god wants to move through you
[1:10:56] you don't want to just move through a
[1:10:58] prophet but he come and showed us what
[1:10:59] you were able to do what who you are
[1:11:02] that you could speak and god would begin
[1:11:04] to honor your word
[1:11:06] but you can't do that if you're just all
[1:11:07] the time working for yourself
[1:11:10] jesus goes down through a crowd
[1:11:13] there's 5 000 people
[1:11:16] and he's he goes through this crowd
[1:11:19] and here are the the lame and the halt
[1:11:22] and the wizard thousands of people
[1:11:24] all of them sick because they're trying
[1:11:26] to get into the
[1:11:27] pool
[1:11:28] that's a disappointing way healing
[1:11:30] meeting
[1:11:31] think about it one person got healed
[1:11:32] every time the angel moved
[1:11:34] we don't even hear how often the angel
[1:11:36] moved
[1:11:37] it may not have been every day i don't
[1:11:39] believe there's it says how often it
[1:11:40] moved it just at certain times the angel
[1:11:42] would trouble the water and here they
[1:11:44] come
[1:11:44] one person whoever was quickest to get
[1:11:46] in
[1:11:47] so if you were lame or didn't have
[1:11:48] anybody to help you in or like the man
[1:11:51] with the maybe a prostate condition or
[1:11:52] something was just weak he was unable to
[1:11:54] get to the water in time so he laid
[1:11:56] there for year after year month after
[1:11:58] month year after year waiting on a
[1:12:00] moving in the water and jesus walks into
[1:12:02] that he don't go through and start
[1:12:03] making making a prayer line bringing
[1:12:05] everybody up and healing this one and
[1:12:06] healing that one but he was led by the
[1:12:08] father
[1:12:09] there was one
[1:12:11] laying there that he would speak to he
[1:12:12] didn't go to the worst case for the best
[1:12:14] case and sometimes we have to do things
[1:12:16] the best we can but the way jesus did it
[1:12:18] so he was perfectly led by the father to
[1:12:20] that one person aren't you glad that the
[1:12:22] word was perfectly led by the father to
[1:12:25] you and your condition to you and your
[1:12:27] family to you and your situation oh that
[1:12:30] ought to be enough to make a shout this
[1:12:32] morning that the word would come down
[1:12:34] into my world and speak directly to me i
[1:12:37] see myself in that sea of people i see
[1:12:39] myself like that here it comes being
[1:12:41] directed to me
[1:12:44] and i can't explain it it's all grace i
[1:12:46] can't i can't make it happen i can't
[1:12:48] call him down here he come and he said
[1:12:50] do you believe if you believe pick up
[1:12:52] your bed and walk do you want to be well
[1:12:55] and when he said it there was something
[1:12:57] inside the man said yes i believe i want
[1:12:59] to be well and when he said it there was
[1:13:01] something inside of you a seed from the
[1:13:03] foundation of the world that said yes i
[1:13:05] want to be well
[1:13:06] i believe
[1:13:08] hey man it wasn't brother branham that's
[1:13:10] the way he operated it wasn't it wasn't
[1:13:12] just brother branham doing and because
[1:13:14] sometimes when brother brown just did
[1:13:15] things he he made mistakes like we all
[1:13:18] do
[1:13:20] but when it was the father leading him
[1:13:23] yes
[1:13:24] that's why he was so careful
[1:13:26] not to just do what preachers wanted him
[1:13:27] to do right yes because the father led
[1:13:30] him
[1:13:30] we all need that leadership yeah god
[1:13:32] gives us human leadership but we need
[1:13:34] the leadership of the father beyond that
[1:13:36] because many times the human leadership
[1:13:37] will fail yes
[1:13:40] that's right
[1:13:42] he said brother brandon said i'm not the
[1:13:44] one that performs those things i'm only
[1:13:46] one that's near when he does it
[1:13:48] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:13:52] it
[1:13:53] amen it wasn't what i knew
[1:13:56] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[1:13:59] that he spoke through
[1:14:00] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:14:03] oh no it was the manifestation of the
[1:14:06] son of man
[1:14:08] not the manifestation of the seventh oh
[1:14:09] that's so key not the manifestation of
[1:14:12] the seventh angel he wasn't manifesting
[1:14:14] himself
[1:14:15] or his own ministry he was manifesting
[1:14:17] the son of man
[1:14:19] amen he said the son of man is christ
[1:14:21] he's the one that you're feeding on
[1:14:23] you're not feeding on a man
[1:14:26] we're feeding this morning
[1:14:28] we're feeding yes you want to know why
[1:14:30] we're happy i love that old song can't
[1:14:32] you see why i'm happy
[1:14:34] i've been eating at the buffet yeah i've
[1:14:36] got a full seven course meal that's why
[1:14:39] i could be excited that's why my kids i
[1:14:40] want my kids to understand he said
[1:14:41] brother ben this is above the level of
[1:14:43] the kids no it's not no it's not they
[1:14:45] can understand that the lamb died for
[1:14:46] their sins they can understand that the
[1:14:49] seals have been open and the book is a
[1:14:50] new book and they can have that same
[1:14:52] excitement that same i know it's not
[1:14:54] about the excitement but even our
[1:14:56] children ought to be able to get into it
[1:14:58] to the point where they believe it where
[1:14:59] there's a quickening power that comes to
[1:15:01] them and they say lord i believe it i
[1:15:03] may not understand it all but i believe
[1:15:05] it that quickening power can come to our
[1:15:07] children to our grandchildren to the
[1:15:08] people around us he's the word and that
[1:15:11] word quickens it makes you live
[1:15:14] yes hey man we're not feeding on a man
[1:15:16] if we were feeding on a man we could
[1:15:18] just make it a we'd make it a school and
[1:15:20] and teach everybody theology but we're
[1:15:22] not feeding on a man his words will fail
[1:15:26] oh my but you're feeding on the
[1:15:28] unfailing
[1:15:29] unfailing
[1:15:31] what does that mean unfailing it means
[1:15:33] it will
[1:15:34] go to its intended purpose the word of
[1:15:36] god will not fall to the ground he said
[1:15:38] my words will not become void if god
[1:15:40] said there would be a bride there will
[1:15:42] be a bride
[1:15:44] he's we're feeding on the unfailing
[1:15:46] i could just stop there and preach for a
[1:15:48] while
[1:15:49] the unfailing
[1:15:51] body word
[1:15:52] of the son of man
[1:15:58] i'm not going to sit and parse the
[1:15:59] prophet's word and say well this you
[1:16:01] know he wasn't right about this he
[1:16:03] wasn't right about that i'm just going
[1:16:04] to believe that what i'm feeding on yes
[1:16:10] i ate chicken you know i i like chicken
[1:16:12] with a bone in it
[1:16:14] it flavors it
[1:16:16] flavors the chicken it's not dry
[1:16:19] chicken with the bone in it
[1:16:21] it's good
[1:16:23] even pork with the bone in it by the way
[1:16:25] is good
[1:16:26] if there's something about the bone in a
[1:16:28] season but you don't need the bone but
[1:16:29] you don't sit there worry about it
[1:16:32] either you're not feeding on the
[1:16:34] humanity
[1:16:36] you're not feeding on that oh i can't
[1:16:37] listen to it it's got bone in it no feed
[1:16:39] on the feed on the chicken
[1:16:42] i feed on the unfailing body word of the
[1:16:44] son of man feed on the fresh kill you
[1:16:47] don't feed on the word on the on every
[1:16:49] mannerism and everything well i gotta
[1:16:50] walk like he walked i gotta i gotta say
[1:16:52] amen like he did that's not what we're
[1:16:54] feeding on we're feeding on the body
[1:16:56] word of the son of man
[1:16:58] right more than a man
[1:17:00] it's christ
[1:17:03] now
[1:17:04] he is the word let me say amen to that
[1:17:06] today
[1:17:07] let's turn to john chapter 1 and verse 1
[1:17:10] and we'll begin reading there and i just
[1:17:11] want to read this now in this light does
[1:17:13] the message matter
[1:17:15] does the message matter and we believe
[1:17:17] that it does
[1:17:19] and so now john 1 1 in the beginning was
[1:17:21] the word
[1:17:23] and the word the logos which is speech
[1:17:26] or a voice
[1:17:28] the word was with god and the word was
[1:17:30] god
[1:17:31] the same how do you get past that
[1:17:34] the word was god it wasn't a second
[1:17:36] person
[1:17:37] it was god
[1:17:38] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:17:41] all things were made by him and without
[1:17:44] him was not anything made that was made
[1:17:47] amen he is the creator
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:51] in him was life
[1:17:53] and the life i love it life it animates
[1:17:56] you you're not dead
[1:17:58] yes god won't ever stand still for a
[1:18:00] dead church that's right
[1:18:02] right i hope you're hearing me today
[1:18:04] there's got to be life it may not be all
[1:18:06] super emotional running the aisles but
[1:18:08] there's going to be life yes
[1:18:10] there's got to be life yes if there's no
[1:18:12] life if i don't care about what i'm
[1:18:14] saying why would you care
[1:18:16] if you don't care about it why do we
[1:18:17] come to church
[1:18:19] i don't get up here and spit because it
[1:18:21] makes me feel good to do it i don't get
[1:18:23] up here and yell at you you know because
[1:18:24] it just there's probably more proper
[1:18:26] ways to speak but he chose the
[1:18:28] foolishness of preaching to display not
[1:18:31] just to not just to say the words but to
[1:18:33] demonstrate by the power of the gospel
[1:18:36] so that not only the words could be said
[1:18:38] but the sick could be healed and the
[1:18:40] blind could see and the dead could be
[1:18:42] raised and people could be put in a
[1:18:44] rapture condition god chose to do it
[1:18:46] that way because in him was life yes and
[1:18:49] the life was the light of men
[1:18:52] and the light shineth in darkness
[1:18:56] and the darkness
[1:18:57] comprehended it not in other words the
[1:19:00] darkness never becomes light it's always
[1:19:02] darkness
[1:19:03] it gets pushed back by the light
[1:19:06] but it's always darkness verse six there
[1:19:08] was a man sent from god whose name was
[1:19:11] gone well wait i thought we were talking
[1:19:12] about the godhead yeah
[1:19:15] now think about it he comes back he goes
[1:19:17] through the verse one down through verse
[1:19:19] six and he comes back to the godhead
[1:19:21] later
[1:19:22] but now he's going to talk about john
[1:19:25] now think about it for a moment john was
[1:19:27] not the godhead he's going to explain it
[1:19:30] he was not the word
[1:19:32] the logos right
[1:19:34] but he was a man sent from god
[1:19:37] he was not god
[1:19:39] but he was a man sent from god
[1:19:41] now why would we need to know about john
[1:19:43] when we're talking about jesus
[1:19:45] and you remember john is saying in the
[1:19:47] spiritual the same thing that matthew
[1:19:49] and mark and luke said in the natural
[1:19:50] how that they told the story of jesus
[1:19:52] birth and so now they told his natural
[1:19:55] birth remember they would go down
[1:19:56] through the genealogy matthew especially
[1:19:58] goes all the way through the genealogy
[1:20:00] it shows that jesus is the son of david
[1:20:02] and talks about how he's a rightful king
[1:20:04] that comes on the earth the lion matthew
[1:20:06] chose that and mark shows what he shows
[1:20:09] and luke shows his luke goes into the
[1:20:10] manner of his birth and shows how he's a
[1:20:12] man and all these things but now we come
[1:20:14] down into john and john takes it from a
[1:20:17] spiritual supernatural level and he
[1:20:19] shows the god part and said this is how
[1:20:21] i use god this is his lineage
[1:20:24] right and so now the light is shining in
[1:20:26] darkness
[1:20:28] how is he going to shine
[1:20:30] how is he going to announce his arrival
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:35] how's he gonna do it there was a man
[1:20:37] sent from god yes all right
[1:20:39] so if he's gonna come a second time yeah
[1:20:41] are you with me now he came the first
[1:20:43] time how's he gonna announce his arrival
[1:20:46] he didn't announce it with a brass band
[1:20:48] he didn't announce it with a with a
[1:20:50] great kind of circus going on in a great
[1:20:52] theatrical production how did he
[1:20:54] announce it a man come out of the
[1:20:55] wilderness the spirit with the spirit
[1:20:57] and power of elijah
[1:20:59] come out of the wilderness with a with
[1:21:01] with even locusts and wild honey
[1:21:04] a man of the wilderness walked out and
[1:21:06] began to preach on the women
[1:21:08] yeah
[1:21:09] that's what he did
[1:21:10] he went to herod he said it's not right
[1:21:12] for you to have her yes and he was
[1:21:15] rejected by the people of that day but
[1:21:17] the bible said the same came for a
[1:21:19] witness
[1:21:20] to bear witness of the light yes
[1:21:24] that all men through him
[1:21:26] might believe
[1:21:28] he was not that light
[1:21:30] but was sent
[1:21:32] now think about it why do we believe a
[1:21:34] message
[1:21:35] the messenger was not that light but he
[1:21:38] was sent amen to bear witness yes he was
[1:21:42] sent to bear witness of
[1:21:45] that light
[1:21:47] amen he said that was the true light
[1:21:49] that was the true light what the logos
[1:21:51] the word
[1:21:52] that came and most made flesh that was
[1:21:54] the true life which lighteth every man
[1:21:56] that cometh into the world
[1:21:58] he was in the world now watch how he
[1:22:00] moves back now he's talking about jesus
[1:22:02] and then all of a sudden he said there
[1:22:04] was a man sent from god and now he comes
[1:22:06] right back to the word again he says now
[1:22:08] he was not that light he was sent to
[1:22:09] bear witness of that life that was the
[1:22:11] true light which lighteth every man that
[1:22:12] cometh into the world verse 10 he was in
[1:22:15] the world and the world was made by him
[1:22:17] and the world knew him not
[1:22:20] he came into his own
[1:22:22] and his own received him none right
[1:22:25] but as many as received him
[1:22:28] yes
[1:22:28] oh my i want to be one who receives him
[1:22:30] today yes
[1:22:32] i want to be one who receives the
[1:22:34] prophet's words because the prophets
[1:22:35] were to speak of him
[1:22:37] yes a prophet witnesses of him
[1:22:39] right so it's not him we don't worship a
[1:22:42] man we don't we don't just follow a man
[1:22:43] we follow christ
[1:22:46] in the word
[1:22:48] but christ spoke a man was sent from god
[1:22:50] and he said if you receive those who
[1:22:52] have sinned you've received me yes
[1:22:55] right so as many as received him to them
[1:22:57] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:22:59] so he says i'm not going to leave you in
[1:23:01] the condition that you are. but here's
[1:23:03] this word coming down manifested in the
[1:23:05] flesh and was prophesied by elijah the
[1:23:08] prophet to come and was foretold and
[1:23:10] introduced by him and now here he comes
[1:23:12] down to make you sons and daughters of
[1:23:14] god even to them that believe on his
[1:23:17] name
[1:23:18] amen gives you the power to be born
[1:23:20] again gives you the power to live a
[1:23:22] righteous life gives you the power to
[1:23:24] live for god you don't ever have to give
[1:23:26] in to any temptation you don't ever have
[1:23:28] to give in to any sin you don't ever
[1:23:30] have to get to a place where you feel
[1:23:31] like well i just can't make it but he
[1:23:33] said he gave you power to become the
[1:23:35] sons of god
[1:23:37] amen even to them that believe on his
[1:23:39] name which were born so this is how you
[1:23:41] become a son of god
[1:23:42] you you aren't educated into it
[1:23:45] i can't i can't make you a son of god by
[1:23:47] teaching you the message
[1:23:49] you become a son of god by being born
[1:23:51] into it
[1:23:53] not of blood nor the will of the flesh
[1:23:54] nor the will of man
[1:23:56] but of god yes
[1:23:58] amen now what was john's message when he
[1:24:01] come now look here he's talking about
[1:24:02] the word and how it come and there was a
[1:24:05] man sent from god and john's message was
[1:24:07] christ
[1:24:09] because the next day john seeth jesus
[1:24:10] coming unto him and said behold the lamb
[1:24:12] of god
[1:24:14] which takes away the sin of the world
[1:24:16] yes sir and brother brandon brought that
[1:24:17] down to our day and he said he didn't
[1:24:19] say behold my baptist behold my
[1:24:20] methodist yeah amen behold my
[1:24:23] pentecostal behold my favorite preacher
[1:24:25] what did he say
[1:24:26] behold the lamb of
[1:24:28] god that's what john that's what elijah
[1:24:31] spirit that's what the messenger the
[1:24:33] forerunner did yes sir
[1:24:35] now without that prophet and i read to
[1:24:37] you not long ago in the scripture where
[1:24:38] it says that those who receive john
[1:24:40] receive christ
[1:24:42] now not all of those some received john
[1:24:44] and never received christ right but
[1:24:46] those who received john's message yes
[1:24:49] who heard john's message
[1:24:51] they didn't stay with john
[1:24:53] but they said there here comes christ
[1:24:56] and brother randall says that the focus
[1:24:58] moves from the
[1:24:59] from the uh uh prophecy to
[1:25:02] to the fulfillment
[1:25:04] and so now that like the spotlight was
[1:25:06] on john in the river and when jesus
[1:25:08] comes into the water and is baptized the
[1:25:10] spotlight leaves john
[1:25:12] and as he's exiting the river if you can
[1:25:14] see it like a play as god's great drama
[1:25:16] is unfolding here's the spotlight it
[1:25:18] left john he's standing there in the
[1:25:20] river but he's still pointing at christ
[1:25:23] follow christ that's what the message is
[1:25:25] that's why it matters
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] now
[1:25:31] without a prophet
[1:25:34] in the spirit and power of elijah the
[1:25:35] people would never recognize the
[1:25:36] promised word of the hour and because
[1:25:39] and i say word of the hour because it's
[1:25:41] there's a specific thing that god must
[1:25:44] do in our day
[1:25:46] and and that's the rapture of the church
[1:25:48] and so we know that that's coming the
[1:25:50] change of the body we know that that's
[1:25:52] coming
[1:25:53] now and and we know in one sense it's
[1:25:55] already began hebrews 13 8 tells us that
[1:25:58] jesus christ is the same
[1:26:01] yesterday today
[1:26:03] and forever
[1:26:05] brother ben i knew that move on wait a
[1:26:07] minute
[1:26:08] jesus christ the same
[1:26:11] yesterday today and forever now what do
[1:26:13] we say christ he the message is christ
[1:26:18] right
[1:26:19] the message is christ
[1:26:21] so why does the message matter
[1:26:23] because the message is the same
[1:26:26] yesterday today and forever jesus christ
[1:26:29] is the same
[1:26:30] yesterday today and forever the message
[1:26:32] matters
[1:26:33] for yesterday yes right think about it
[1:26:36] the message matters for yesterday the
[1:26:39] message gives us perspective
[1:26:41] on what yesterday has been
[1:26:43] if you ever talk to a a regular
[1:26:46] denominational christian almost
[1:26:48] regardless of what denomination they are
[1:26:50] and you begin to talk to them and begin
[1:26:51] to speak to them about these things and
[1:26:53] they are good people many of them but
[1:26:55] they begin to talk to you and you begin
[1:26:57] to realize that they have no
[1:26:59] historical way of putting what hap what
[1:27:02] is happening today into context and what
[1:27:04] has happened in the context like
[1:27:06] the 2000 years it's like it didn't even
[1:27:08] matter and so history began when my
[1:27:11] denomination formed
[1:27:13] right so suddenly we were always without
[1:27:15] any hope and all of a sudden the church
[1:27:17] of christ come along and we were all
[1:27:18] saved
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:21] and and especially the oneness people
[1:27:24] bless their hearts i've talked to them
[1:27:25] about it and and even had family that
[1:27:27] went that direction and i talked to them
[1:27:29] about i said well how do you explain
[1:27:31] what happened in the church ages well
[1:27:33] there was just no nobody baptized in
[1:27:35] jesus name so there was nobody right
[1:27:38] so god didn't have anyone on the earth
[1:27:41] and there may have been some and that
[1:27:42] baptized but the you know the world just
[1:27:44] wasn't any movement until 1906 and then
[1:27:47] people started believing in the name of
[1:27:48] jesus christ and baptizing and then
[1:27:51] and then we now we have a church
[1:27:53] and that's the truth so history started
[1:27:55] with our denomination
[1:27:57] but we don't believe that do we
[1:27:59] why don't we believe that
[1:28:01] why can you believe that your methodist
[1:28:03] grandmother if you had one
[1:28:06] can be saved
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:10] you didn't get that from a denomination
[1:28:12] right you didn't get that from from
[1:28:15] so-and-so on youtube
[1:28:17] yeah right see if the message doesn't
[1:28:19] matter let's just pick somebody on
[1:28:20] youtube to follow but who are you going
[1:28:22] to pick
[1:28:24] where are you going to find a message
[1:28:26] that gives you perspective
[1:28:28] yes
[1:28:29] now think about it that places you in a
[1:28:31] proper perspective towards history
[1:28:34] so that you can see that the seed had to
[1:28:36] fall in the ground
[1:28:37] and you can see what had to happen
[1:28:39] during denominational ages and you can
[1:28:41] see why the martyrs came and you can see
[1:28:43] the four beasts and you can see the
[1:28:44] seven church ages and you can see the
[1:28:46] seven seals and how that they begin to
[1:28:48] start you begin to see all these things
[1:28:50] come together we take that for granted
[1:28:52] they don't understand that
[1:28:55] why would i want to leave this and go to
[1:28:57] a place where i don't even know where i
[1:28:59] am or what i believe
[1:29:01] right
[1:29:04] you all understand this morning i know
[1:29:05] i'm preaching to christians here this
[1:29:07] morning you all know this but i want to
[1:29:08] reinforce your faith today
[1:29:12] so
[1:29:13] most denominations have no answer for
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:16] what's happened well the catholic church
[1:29:18] said well we've always been the church
[1:29:19] well which infallible pope was right
[1:29:24] because they're all different yeah sure
[1:29:27] yes sir
[1:29:28] revelations
[1:29:30] 1 and 12 speaks of this because no
[1:29:31] denomination has an answer for this
[1:29:34] but here comes
[1:29:35] we're taught by the message he said i
[1:29:37] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:29:39] me and being turned i saw seven golden
[1:29:41] candle sticks
[1:29:42] in the midst of seven candlesticks one
[1:29:44] like into the son of man clove with a
[1:29:46] garment down to the foot geared about
[1:29:48] the past with a golden girdle his head
[1:29:49] and his hairs were white like woah why
[1:29:51] does snow his eyes wears a flame of fire
[1:29:53] his feet like in defined brass as if
[1:29:55] they burned in a furnace his voice is
[1:29:57] the sound of many waters
[1:29:59] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[1:30:02] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:30:04] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[1:30:06] as the sun shineth in his strength yes
[1:30:10] now look you look at him say what what
[1:30:12] are these seven candlesticks what are
[1:30:13] these seven stars leaving explain to the
[1:30:15] seven char the candlesticks are the
[1:30:17] seven churches the seven stars are seven
[1:30:18] messengers but we didn't weren't able to
[1:30:21] place those seven candlesticks in
[1:30:22] history without the message
[1:30:26] right the bible tells us the seven
[1:30:28] churches
[1:30:29] but it doesn't tell you what the seven
[1:30:31] churches were
[1:30:32] but now you're at the end looking back
[1:30:34] and saying we can identify those seven
[1:30:36] churches yes that's right
[1:30:38] right yes sir and we can look back and
[1:30:40] see what they were
[1:30:42] not only can we identify the seven
[1:30:43] candlesticks but we can identify the
[1:30:45] seven stars
[1:30:47] right we can look back in history
[1:30:49] you really
[1:30:50] i i realized just one day you know i was
[1:30:52] looking to test him brother brandon had
[1:30:54] a real revelation about the people that
[1:30:56] that were those seven stars the
[1:30:57] messenger for each age because how do
[1:30:59] you choose iranius over polycarp you
[1:31:01] know and all those things and begin to
[1:31:02] look at that and brother branham
[1:31:04] explains his methodology to that if you
[1:31:05] go back in the church age but the random
[1:31:07] explains that he says i he said i did it
[1:31:09] he said i almost chose polycarp but i
[1:31:11] chose irenaeus because polycarp was too
[1:31:13] close to denominationalism
[1:31:17] brother branham just looked at history
[1:31:19] and of course was guided by the angel by
[1:31:21] the holy spirit i believe that but he
[1:31:22] looked at history and he saw these men
[1:31:24] and he said here's one who meets the
[1:31:26] qualifications he said i looked at paul
[1:31:27] he said and then look at each one and
[1:31:29] see which one was closest to paul which
[1:31:31] one followed the example of paul in that
[1:31:33] age listen just history itself would
[1:31:35] tell you if there's going to be seven
[1:31:37] messengers who was it who was the
[1:31:39] messenger for our day would it be
[1:31:40] brother would it be uh benny hen
[1:31:45] would it be earl or oral roberts
[1:31:47] earl roberts about made him up
[1:31:51] got two preachers mixed up there
[1:31:53] would it be it would it be jack cole
[1:31:55] he's a good man but would it be him who
[1:31:57] would be the messenger for our day who
[1:31:59] opened who was there when the seals were
[1:32:02] open
[1:32:03] who got amen who was there to receive it
[1:32:06] i mean
[1:32:06] just look at history
[1:32:08] who else is it going to be
[1:32:12] i believe it was a prophet you believe
[1:32:13] whatever you want to if you believe it's
[1:32:14] you that's fine go manifest it
[1:32:17] yeah
[1:32:18] all right we'll wait 50 years and see
[1:32:20] what happens
[1:32:22] yeah
[1:32:23] say well the message has been here 50 60
[1:32:25] years and
[1:32:26] and nothing's 70 years message and
[1:32:28] nothing's happened wait a minute yeah
[1:32:31] you don't see what i see
[1:32:33] at the christmas carol said do you see
[1:32:35] what i see
[1:32:41] with eyes of balaam looking at the
[1:32:42] hinder parts
[1:32:44] you don't see what i see i've seen a lot
[1:32:47] i've got every reason not to believe
[1:32:49] this message i'm a perfect test case
[1:32:52] for those that would try to come in and
[1:32:53] grab people have been hurt amen and try
[1:32:56] to use that hurt against them but david
[1:32:58] knows what i'm talking about some of
[1:33:00] y'all do we're test cases for that we've
[1:33:02] seen the backside of it we've seen men
[1:33:05] who failed we've seen churches that
[1:33:08] failed we've seen the abuse of authority
[1:33:10] we've been there we've watched the
[1:33:12] people take the message and claim to
[1:33:14] believe the message and make a cult out
[1:33:15] of it we've seen that we've been there
[1:33:18] and done that but you don't see what i
[1:33:20] see what i see is a bride becoming flesh
[1:33:23] what i see is that word that he preached
[1:33:25] which is the same yesterday today and
[1:33:27] forever moving out of history giving me
[1:33:29] a perspective about history but moving
[1:33:31] out of history and being the same god
[1:33:33] today
[1:33:34] amen that's what i see i see a bride
[1:33:37] rising up
[1:33:38] you can see what you want to but i see a
[1:33:40] people being saved i see people being
[1:33:42] born again i see people coming to christ
[1:33:44] i see people being saved miraculously
[1:33:47] from the things of the world i see
[1:33:49] people manifesting an end time message
[1:33:51] yes we have our problems yes there's
[1:33:53] people among us that are not true
[1:33:54] there's always going to be a mixed
[1:33:55] multitude but i see god doing what he
[1:33:57] promised he would do
[1:33:59] it depends on how you look at it
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:04] now look
[1:34:06] brother branham says this he said no
[1:34:07] matter how good you are
[1:34:09] what you quit doing what you start doing
[1:34:11] you've got to accept the person of the
[1:34:13] lord jesus christ
[1:34:15] amen he said and then when you do that
[1:34:17] he is the word
[1:34:19] and then your life fits right in the
[1:34:20] word
[1:34:21] and it manifests itself to this age that
[1:34:24] you're living in
[1:34:25] noah had to do that for the word to be
[1:34:26] manifested in his age what if moses come
[1:34:29] along he said we know what noah done
[1:34:30] we'll take noah's word we'll do it just
[1:34:31] the way noah did it we'll build an ark
[1:34:33] and float down the now river and go out
[1:34:34] of egypt why it wouldn't have worked he
[1:34:36] said see that was another age
[1:34:38] jesus couldn't have come with moses
[1:34:39] message luther couldn't come with the
[1:34:40] catholic message well actually couldn't
[1:34:42] come with the luther's message pentecost
[1:34:44] couldn't come with the westview age
[1:34:45] message and the bride can't be formed in
[1:34:48] the pentecostal denomination
[1:34:50] it just can't do it he said that's
[1:34:52] exactly right she's done organized and
[1:34:53] went out here there she sits just like
[1:34:55] the rest of them and says shut
[1:34:57] hey man he said and then he begins
[1:34:58] talking about a writer because brother
[1:35:00] random had critics in his day
[1:35:02] right and they weren't they were here
[1:35:04] that's not new
[1:35:05] they like to think well we discovered
[1:35:07] all this stuff i've heard this stuff
[1:35:08] ever since i was a kid yeah i've heard
[1:35:10] the same criticisms yeah but you go and
[1:35:13] they're not those are not unique i don't
[1:35:15] even like to highlight them because
[1:35:16] they're not unique to the message you'll
[1:35:17] hear the same criticisms about
[1:35:18] christians yeah and if you take that
[1:35:20] same methodology when you can't prove it
[1:35:22] by science you can't prove jesus rose
[1:35:25] from the dead either
[1:35:27] or for that matter even that he ever
[1:35:28] existed
[1:35:30] and then where are we at
[1:35:32] yes sir right something you're going to
[1:35:34] have to believe something
[1:35:36] to be a christian
[1:35:37] it's going to take some faith to be a
[1:35:39] christian
[1:35:40] that's just the truth sir i wish i i
[1:35:42] wish i could prove everything by science
[1:35:43] i can't it's provable by science if you
[1:35:46] believe amen
[1:35:48] right if you believe i can prove to you
[1:35:50] by science jesus throws from the dead if
[1:35:51] you believe i can prove to you this
[1:35:52] message is true by scientific truth but
[1:35:54] if you don't believe yeah
[1:35:57] i can't prove it to you because there's
[1:35:59] always going to be that element of faith
[1:36:00] god made it that way
[1:36:02] he said he hid it from the eyes of the
[1:36:03] wise and prudent and revealed and
[1:36:05] debated such as would learn
[1:36:08] amen and so that writer began to
[1:36:10] criticize brother branham and he said
[1:36:12] what said he was a devil if there was
[1:36:13] such a thing so he said he didn't
[1:36:15] believe in god he said a god that could
[1:36:16] fold his arms and set up and watch them
[1:36:18] martyrs through the early ages claim to
[1:36:20] have power to open the red sea let them
[1:36:22] women and children be tore to pieces by
[1:36:24] lions and so forth he said and then say
[1:36:26] he was a loving god
[1:36:28] i was sitting in the philippines
[1:36:29] answering questions from young people
[1:36:31] one of the young people challenged me he
[1:36:33] said what kind of a god would let
[1:36:35] would let joshua go into jericho and
[1:36:37] kill the babies
[1:36:40] that's a real question
[1:36:43] huh
[1:36:44] and you try to explain that by the word
[1:36:45] and what the purpose was and all those
[1:36:47] things but again there's got something
[1:36:49] in you has to trust in an almighty god
[1:36:52] and that he knows what's best
[1:36:54] listen there's a judgment coming on this
[1:36:55] world there's going to be a time that's
[1:36:56] going to be wife clean
[1:36:59] and that's men women boys and girls
[1:37:02] god's going to allow that sin started it
[1:37:04] god didn't do it but god it's going to
[1:37:06] be in the hands of god when he lets it
[1:37:07] happen
[1:37:08] it'll be the judgments of the almighty
[1:37:10] god
[1:37:12] we've got to bow to the omniscience of
[1:37:14] god or you'll go crazy
[1:37:17] you're never going to understand what
[1:37:18] you go through i don't know why i'm
[1:37:19] going here this morning you're never
[1:37:20] going to understand why you went through
[1:37:21] what you went through that's right
[1:37:23] you're never going to do it live in the
[1:37:25] moment
[1:37:26] i was telling a young person yesterday
[1:37:27] is about to get married i said you need
[1:37:29] to live in the moment because if you
[1:37:31] constantly and i've advised other young
[1:37:32] people the same way if you're constantly
[1:37:34] worried about what your marriage and
[1:37:35] getting married and what it's going to
[1:37:37] be like and all these things
[1:37:38] and he hasn't even asked you yet you
[1:37:40] know that's a
[1:37:41] eventually you've got to come back and
[1:37:42] live in the moment
[1:37:44] rest in the fact that you have a person
[1:37:46] who who loves you and you and you love
[1:37:48] them and and there's this there's this
[1:37:49] bond between you but nothing's signed
[1:37:51] yet
[1:37:52] right
[1:37:53] and so that god may have a different
[1:37:55] plan but rest in this fact that there
[1:37:57] there's an attraction there and you can
[1:37:58] spend time together we need to learn how
[1:38:00] to value the moment in our lives
[1:38:03] if you spend the rest of your life
[1:38:04] trying to figure out why what happened
[1:38:06] to you happened to you you're going to
[1:38:07] end up on the ash sheep for the rest of
[1:38:09] your life but god had to bring job off
[1:38:10] of the ash sheep
[1:38:12] it wasn't that joke was a bad person
[1:38:14] anybody's going gonna gonna suffer
[1:38:16] when they've been through things like
[1:38:17] that yeah and some of you all suffer in
[1:38:19] ways that i can't even i've told you
[1:38:21] many times i can't i can't even imagine
[1:38:23] doing suffering like that i saw these
[1:38:26] kids that died the other day in the
[1:38:27] school shooting and my heart just broke
[1:38:30] i thought how in the world could could a
[1:38:32] boy take his take up arms and do that to
[1:38:35] children how how could that possibly
[1:38:36] because i see my own children that i
[1:38:38] can't even comprehend losing a child
[1:38:41] even the sickness much less to to those
[1:38:43] things
[1:38:45] but even in that
[1:38:46] you've got to bow to the omniscience of
[1:38:48] god
[1:38:49] and job said i can't make it into the
[1:38:50] world i'm going to go out naked i'll
[1:38:52] never understand it
[1:38:55] and god when he come to him he didn't
[1:38:56] ever show him why
[1:38:58] never did he just said
[1:39:01] i'm your redeemer
[1:39:03] yes job where were you before the
[1:39:05] foundation of the earth
[1:39:08] oh my he said he said where were you
[1:39:10] when the sons of god shall there's a
[1:39:12] revelation when the sons of god shouted
[1:39:14] together for joy job what are you doing
[1:39:17] why are you why are you why do you keep
[1:39:19] going after these things why do you keep
[1:39:21] keep rebuking god and fight with your
[1:39:23] friends he said there's something going
[1:39:25] on you don't understand and you never
[1:39:27] will but i'm here
[1:39:29] and job cried out i know my redeemer
[1:39:31] lives
[1:39:33] amen
[1:39:34] that's what we need to know
[1:39:36] brother branham spoke of those in the
[1:39:38] going through the dark ages he said all
[1:39:40] he told him he said i know
[1:39:44] i know what you're going through
[1:39:46] yes
[1:39:47] that's all he said
[1:39:49] i've always thought that i always wanted
[1:39:50] to be that kind of friend because i try
[1:39:51] to overexplain things but don't you
[1:39:54] appreciate that friend who will show up
[1:39:56] at the funeral
[1:39:58] just say i i know
[1:40:00] you know there's very few because only
[1:40:02] only a person has been through the same
[1:40:03] thing you went through can do that
[1:40:06] most people can't do that yeah but he
[1:40:08] always can
[1:40:10] because he was tempted in every way like
[1:40:12] we were
[1:40:14] so he just tells him he said i know
[1:40:15] oh my god can you imagine the prayers
[1:40:17] that went up from anguish mothers
[1:40:19] i don't know why i'm going this
[1:40:20] direction this morning but you just hang
[1:40:21] with me
[1:40:23] you know satan will use that he'll use
[1:40:25] the hardship of your life to try to tear
[1:40:26] you away from the message yeah sure to
[1:40:29] make you not not count on it anymore
[1:40:32] because if god was real this message had
[1:40:34] life in it why would you go through what
[1:40:35] you go through
[1:40:37] why would god allow something like that
[1:40:39] why would he ever do that there's just
[1:40:41] no
[1:40:42] there's no end to the questions and
[1:40:44] he'll try to use that to tear it away
[1:40:46] but he just says can you imagine a
[1:40:48] mother praying and she kind of god don't
[1:40:50] let them kill my baby
[1:40:53] don't let them kill my baby don't let
[1:40:54] them take my baby don't let them take
[1:40:56] them away away from me and if i if i
[1:40:58] acknowledge you they'll take my baby
[1:41:00] away and they'll kill my baby
[1:41:02] you imagine i i can imagine those sunday
[1:41:04] morning services
[1:41:05] they would gather together and say this
[1:41:07] this week you know we talk about this
[1:41:08] one's sick and that one they get up to
[1:41:10] read the prayer requests and say this
[1:41:11] one got killed in the arena
[1:41:14] brother so-and-so was was fed to the
[1:41:17] sister dogs and her baby was cut out of
[1:41:19] her womb
[1:41:22] and during that time god never lifted
[1:41:25] his finger
[1:41:27] he said i know
[1:41:29] that was their age they were in that ox
[1:41:31] age i don't say we have to go through
[1:41:32] that today but the things that we do go
[1:41:34] through yeah
[1:41:35] he says i know
[1:41:37] yeah
[1:41:38] he said it's enough for him to know
[1:41:40] right
[1:41:41] if you really know that he knows that
[1:41:43] he's omniscient and that he's got
[1:41:45] everything in control and you can ever
[1:41:47] wrap your mind around that and trust
[1:41:49] that
[1:41:50] say lord i
[1:41:52] i can't comprehend it i can't make
[1:41:54] myself feel better about it but i'm
[1:41:55] going to trust you
[1:41:59] i can't force myself to be happy but i'm
[1:42:01] going to trust you
[1:42:05] these people going through that and this
[1:42:07] atheist now used that against the
[1:42:09] message of the hour against brother
[1:42:10] branham because he said he said god's
[1:42:12] real how could a god that could fold his
[1:42:13] arms set up and watch them martyrs
[1:42:15] through the early ages and claim to have
[1:42:16] power to open the red sea let them women
[1:42:18] and children be torn to pieces like my
[1:42:20] lions and so forth and then said he was
[1:42:22] a loving god he said there's no such
[1:42:24] creature see the fellow without he said
[1:42:26] the fellow without inspiration of the
[1:42:27] word fails to see it
[1:42:29] he said the first corner of wheat the
[1:42:31] bridegroom had to fall into the earth
[1:42:33] where do you hear that you don't hear
[1:42:34] that at a baptist church
[1:42:36] that come from the message of the hour
[1:42:38] the corn of wheat had to fall into the
[1:42:40] ground in order to rise again so did the
[1:42:42] first bride yes amen that was born at
[1:42:45] pentecost had to go through the dark
[1:42:47] ages like any other seed to be buried
[1:42:49] you realize when is our dying time now
[1:42:52] we're going to be birthed we're planted
[1:42:54] on the earth we're here to die
[1:42:57] we got to go through this we we had to
[1:42:59] go through this to be tested that's why
[1:43:01] we're here
[1:43:03] and he drops us handfuls of joy and
[1:43:05] handfuls of inspiration but we're here
[1:43:07] to be tested that's our purpose on the
[1:43:09] earth but we're going to a better place
[1:43:11] a place where there is no death a place
[1:43:13] where they can't rip away our children a
[1:43:15] place where no one will be lost are you
[1:43:17] with me now yes
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:21] they had to die
[1:43:23] we don't understand that that's where
[1:43:24] you you give in you surrender yourself
[1:43:27] to the omnipotence of god
[1:43:29] he says i know
[1:43:32] i know
[1:43:35] the first bride had to die
[1:43:37] he said but it started sprouting again
[1:43:39] in luther
[1:43:40] look at the simple
[1:43:42] simplicity of this explanation
[1:43:44] the god of the past the same yesterday
[1:43:47] today and forever the simplicity of this
[1:43:49] i know
[1:43:51] i know
[1:43:53] and then but here it comes sprouting
[1:43:54] again and the first reformation it
[1:43:56] didn't look like the seed that went in
[1:43:58] but it was the light of that day
[1:44:00] the stalk then went into the tassel
[1:44:01] wesley and from the tassel it went into
[1:44:03] pentecost to shut down isn't that easy
[1:44:05] to understand
[1:44:06] we didn't get that without a message
[1:44:09] you see the message
[1:44:11] explains our yesterdays and washes away
[1:44:14] yesterday
[1:44:16] think about this we're washed by the
[1:44:17] water of the word yes where did we find
[1:44:20] out
[1:44:21] that we were justified yes yes
[1:44:26] i mean you may have understood from the
[1:44:27] scripture that the blood of jesus christ
[1:44:29] covered your sin but what does that mean
[1:44:32] what does that mean you could look at it
[1:44:35] say wait i know it says it but what does
[1:44:36] it mean for me well listen to what a
[1:44:38] prophet said he said not only is the
[1:44:40] bride washed forgiven but she is
[1:44:42] justified
[1:44:44] did you ever try the word justified to
[1:44:45] see what it means he said for instance
[1:44:47] if brother green heard that i've been
[1:44:48] drinking i've been doing bad things he
[1:44:50] found out that i didn't do it he come
[1:44:51] and said i forgive you brother branham
[1:44:52] you forgive me i've never done it what
[1:44:54] are you forgiving me about he said but
[1:44:56] if i'm guilty then i can be forgiven but
[1:44:58] i'm still not just because i did it but
[1:45:00] the word justified is though you've
[1:45:02] never done it at all he said and then
[1:45:03] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so
[1:45:05] from sin until it's put in the book of
[1:45:08] god's forgetfulness and he's the only
[1:45:09] one who can do it he said we can't we
[1:45:12] can forgive but we can't forget
[1:45:14] he said i could forgive you but i will
[1:45:16] always remember what you've done those
[1:45:18] evil things he said then you're not just
[1:45:20] you're forgiven but in the sight of god
[1:45:22] the bride is justified she never done it
[1:45:25] in the first place
[1:45:27] amen standing there married to the
[1:45:28] virtuous son of god never sinned in the
[1:45:30] first place why
[1:45:32] here's the explanation she was four
[1:45:34] ordained
[1:45:36] she was trapped into this and now when
[1:45:38] she hears the truth and come forth the
[1:45:40] blood cleansed her and she stands there
[1:45:42] virtuous no sin on her at all where do
[1:45:45] you get that from does the message
[1:45:47] matter come on yes sir
[1:45:49] yes sir
[1:45:51] don't get that from a denominational
[1:45:52] theory
[1:45:54] the message matters for yesterday's the
[1:45:56] message matters today remember jesus
[1:45:57] christ the same yesterday yes today
[1:46:01] the message places us in christ
[1:46:02] ephesians 1 3
[1:46:04] talks about that how we were blessed
[1:46:05] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:46:07] places in christ he has chosen us in him
[1:46:09] before the foundation of the world we
[1:46:11] should be holy without blame before him
[1:46:12] in love there was no wesley in a
[1:46:14] pentecostal church if you think about it
[1:46:16] that truth was there during calvin's age
[1:46:18] and then it began to be lost but they
[1:46:20] went to an extreme version of calvinism
[1:46:22] and then it began to be lost and here
[1:46:24] come the spirit of god moving in the
[1:46:25] wesleyans and the pentecostals but there
[1:46:27] is no wesley or pentecostal church that
[1:46:29] i know of that teaches predestination
[1:46:33] an election
[1:46:34] why it was restored by the message
[1:46:37] a prophet had to come
[1:46:38] i just had to come what is christ christ
[1:46:40] it's the word what is the message the
[1:46:42] message is christ why do we need the
[1:46:44] message because we need christ in his
[1:46:47] fullness amen forever was an hour we
[1:46:49] need him that's today he said in the
[1:46:51] volume of the book it's written to me
[1:46:52] listen that this was restored by the
[1:46:55] message of the hour where we could see
[1:46:57] christ in his fullness and see who he
[1:46:59] was and who we are
[1:47:00] predestinated he said there's a mystery
[1:47:02] before christ or anything else was ever
[1:47:04] on earth you see his great mystery that
[1:47:06] he chose the bride knowing eve would
[1:47:07] fall from disbelieving the word knowing
[1:47:09] that she would fall but he would choose
[1:47:11] a bride that would not fall that would
[1:47:13] hold to that word regardless of what all
[1:47:15] the rest of the world had to say about
[1:47:17] it is that you this morning you're going
[1:47:18] to hold on to the word no matter what
[1:47:20] the world says he said they would hold
[1:47:22] to that word they are predestinated to
[1:47:24] stand there you don't do that because
[1:47:26] that you were because you decided to you
[1:47:29] knew that because you were predestined
[1:47:31] to stand there
[1:47:33] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:47:35] predestinated the church to that great
[1:47:37] glorious stand he said oh i'm so happy i
[1:47:39] stand for the message you don't stand
[1:47:41] for it because you chose to
[1:47:42] you stand for it because the word in you
[1:47:46] responded to the word yes sir
[1:47:48] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:47:50] you were predestinated to that great
[1:47:52] glorious stance
[1:47:54] that's why you stood for 50 years
[1:47:57] that's why you stood in the church i
[1:47:59] think of members here in the church some
[1:48:01] of you have stood since before i was
[1:48:03] born some of you about double me and age
[1:48:06] and and when you look back and you begin
[1:48:08] to see you stood for the message almost
[1:48:10] since it began why are you still
[1:48:11] standing it wasn't you
[1:48:13] it was predestination
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:20] the message affects that it affects our
[1:48:22] conduct
[1:48:24] how does god want us to act are you
[1:48:25] still with me this morning
[1:48:27] how does god want us to act
[1:48:30] in this world is so messed up
[1:48:32] no one knows who they are
[1:48:35] who are we
[1:48:38] think about it
[1:48:39] and see as i read the scripture to begin
[1:48:41] with you'll either be deformed or
[1:48:42] transformed by them you'll either be
[1:48:44] deformed by the culture transformed by
[1:48:46] the word yes
[1:48:47] one of those two things is going to
[1:48:49] happen
[1:48:50] in the hour that we live in
[1:48:54] and i want to use as an example this
[1:48:55] morning because it leads through and
[1:48:56] sometimes we don't think about these
[1:48:58] things deeply enough and then i'll close
[1:48:59] in just a few moments if we don't get
[1:49:01] finished we'll just close anyway
[1:49:03] but i want to deal with this in first
[1:49:04] corinthians chapter 11 and verse 1
[1:49:06] because when you look at the family
[1:49:08] today and you look at what's going on
[1:49:10] why does the message matter
[1:49:12] the message places us
[1:49:14] in christ and it places our conduct it
[1:49:17] matters today
[1:49:19] not just for yesterday
[1:49:21] because some people look back and say
[1:49:22] well god did this to a prophet god did
[1:49:24] this they accept that but the message
[1:49:25] matters today jesus christ is the same
[1:49:28] yesterday today and forever
[1:49:31] and there's a reason why we're different
[1:49:32] and it begins with simple teaching
[1:49:35] yeah about the difference between men
[1:49:37] and women
[1:49:41] it's why we're not it's why we are so
[1:49:43] different it's hard to explain sometimes
[1:49:45] i know my girls get asked why do you not
[1:49:47] cut your hair
[1:49:49] huh
[1:49:50] and mom was telling me that she someone
[1:49:51] had told her why don't you trim off the
[1:49:53] dead end someone who knows better
[1:49:55] why don't you trim off the dead dead
[1:49:57] ends and just it'll make your hair so
[1:49:58] much better so why would i start doing
[1:50:00] that now
[1:50:02] after all these years
[1:50:06] but now you look at that and you begin
[1:50:08] to think why do we do things differently
[1:50:10] well because of the word
[1:50:12] right and you could say and i tell my my
[1:50:14] kids i say tell them the bible says so
[1:50:16] the bible says to do that we follow the
[1:50:18] scriptures but it's the message of the
[1:50:20] hour that brought this
[1:50:22] this present to us where we understood
[1:50:25] that it was for our day
[1:50:27] right first corinthians chapter 11 verse
[1:50:28] one be followers of me
[1:50:31] even as i also am of christ
[1:50:33] that's paul he said follow me as i
[1:50:36] follow christ
[1:50:37] verse 2 now i praise you brethren that
[1:50:39] you remember me in all things
[1:50:41] and keep the ordinances today we would
[1:50:42] say well he's taking too much on himself
[1:50:44] no he was the messenger to the age
[1:50:47] now as semester of the age this is where
[1:50:48] pastors gets get mixed up because as a
[1:50:50] messenger to the age he could do he
[1:50:52] could do things and say things about his
[1:50:53] ministry that i can't
[1:50:55] right
[1:50:56] right you don't follow me exclusively
[1:50:58] you follow the message
[1:51:00] right as long as i'm preaching that
[1:51:02] message you follow me
[1:51:04] right but a messenger to the age is
[1:51:06] under just the word himself
[1:51:08] right you follow him you follow the word
[1:51:10] you follow the man you trust if he is a
[1:51:12] messenger you'll stay with the word
[1:51:14] right yes sir right we believe we have a
[1:51:16] messenger to this age but now i don't
[1:51:17] get to say that i can't just say just
[1:51:18] give that blanket statement but paul
[1:51:20] could be followers of me
[1:51:22] he said now i praise you brethren that
[1:51:24] you remember me in all things and keep
[1:51:25] the ordinances as i delivered them to
[1:51:27] you
[1:51:28] he said but i would have you know that
[1:51:29] the head of every man is christ
[1:51:31] and the head of the woman is the man and
[1:51:33] the head of christ is god watch the
[1:51:34] family order he said this is the way
[1:51:36] it's supposed to be
[1:51:38] every man praying or prophesying having
[1:51:40] his head covered dishonoreth his head or
[1:51:42] we don't wear men don't wear hats in
[1:51:43] church and i'm seeing that creep in even
[1:51:46] into the message where people wear a
[1:51:47] ball cap and in church whether you're
[1:51:49] having church or not the sanctuary is
[1:51:51] not a place for a ball cap
[1:51:53] if i ever forget tell me that
[1:51:55] because i wear a ball cap all the time
[1:51:57] but i would expect a deacon if i come in
[1:51:58] here with a ball cap on to tell me take
[1:52:00] it off
[1:52:02] that's right
[1:52:03] because there's we don't cover our heads
[1:52:06] because that was not to be a man to do
[1:52:08] that and but now he'll talk about what a
[1:52:10] covering is in just a moment he said he
[1:52:12] said every man praying or prophecying
[1:52:14] having his head covered dishonored with
[1:52:16] his head his head is christ
[1:52:18] he's not dishonoring this
[1:52:19] be hard to be more dishonorable than my
[1:52:21] head is
[1:52:24] far just the way it looks
[1:52:26] but he he said now every and every woman
[1:52:29] that prayeth through prophesies with
[1:52:30] their head uncovered if you've got the
[1:52:31] scripture open your bibles to it where
[1:52:33] you can read with me every woman that
[1:52:35] prays or prophesies with her with her
[1:52:37] head uncovered dishonor her head
[1:52:40] for that in other words her husband
[1:52:42] remember
[1:52:43] the husband is the head of the woman
[1:52:44] christ is the head of the man
[1:52:47] he says with her head uncovered dishonor
[1:52:49] their head think about it like this
[1:52:50] because in our day and age we're taught
[1:52:52] that over and over girls don't let a man
[1:52:53] tell you you can't do for yourself
[1:52:56] but listen like this the man has
[1:52:58] responsibility for the wife
[1:53:00] and the family think about headship like
[1:53:02] responsibility that's the way it is with
[1:53:03] the church it don't make me a dictator
[1:53:06] i'm responsible
[1:53:08] right and it makes a man responsible
[1:53:10] he can't just treat his wife like a
[1:53:11] doorman he's responsible
[1:53:14] and i'm going somewhere with this now he
[1:53:16] said but every woman that praised their
[1:53:17] prophesies with her head uncovered
[1:53:19] dishonor their head for that is even all
[1:53:21] one as if she were shaven and back then
[1:53:24] it would have been an extreme disgrace a
[1:53:26] dishonor for a woman to have her head
[1:53:27] shaved completely shaved
[1:53:30] he said but if she if she cuts her hair
[1:53:31] she might as well have it shaved off
[1:53:33] he said for a woman be not covered let
[1:53:35] her also be shorn
[1:53:37] if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn
[1:53:39] or shaven let her be covered
[1:53:41] he said for a man indeed ought not to
[1:53:42] cover his head for as much as he is the
[1:53:45] image and glory of god but the woman is
[1:53:47] the glory of the man
[1:53:49] for the man is not of the woman but the
[1:53:51] woman of the man
[1:53:52] again you got to understand this in a
[1:53:54] biblical context he's not talking about
[1:53:56] some type of
[1:53:58] rulership where the man rules by fear it
[1:54:00] never works unless a husband loves his
[1:54:03] wife
[1:54:04] right it just won't work don't try it
[1:54:08] unless a husband loves his wife that's
[1:54:09] where it works
[1:54:11] but now he says the woman is the glory
[1:54:13] of the man the man is not of the woman
[1:54:14] the woman of the man neither in other
[1:54:15] words the man came first and woman come
[1:54:17] out of his side
[1:54:18] he said but this cause ought the woman
[1:54:20] to have power on her head because of the
[1:54:22] angels brother brown said that was the
[1:54:24] messengers he said a real
[1:54:26] minister would say something about it
[1:54:28] he said nevertheless neither is the man
[1:54:30] without the woman neither the woman
[1:54:32] without the man in the lord i love that
[1:54:34] scripture he's saying in the lord he
[1:54:36] said you can't do without one another
[1:54:39] right so you can't just say i'm the head
[1:54:41] you're under the headship of god
[1:54:44] right he said for as the woman is of the
[1:54:46] man
[1:54:47] even so is the man also by the woman in
[1:54:50] other words you were born by a woman
[1:54:52] every person in here was
[1:54:54] sure so if the woman come out of the man
[1:54:56] originally ever since then man come out
[1:54:58] of the woman
[1:55:00] right
[1:55:01] i think that's how it
[1:55:02] works he said but all things of god
[1:55:06] see god god was the creator
[1:55:08] verse 13 judging yourselves
[1:55:11] is it comely or is it decent that a
[1:55:13] woman pray unto god uncovered
[1:55:16] he said does not even nature itself
[1:55:17] teach you now you say well that covering
[1:55:19] i got to put a hat on in church he's
[1:55:21] going to explain himself
[1:55:23] he said does not nature itself teach you
[1:55:25] that if a man have long hair that would
[1:55:27] be covered
[1:55:28] would be long how long is long well
[1:55:31] not to cover
[1:55:33] and if you go back in the original to
[1:55:34] cover by the way if you go back and look
[1:55:36] at that to the original word cover means
[1:55:39] to be long enough to cover
[1:55:42] the shoulders
[1:55:44] and go back and look at it
[1:55:46] it's a glory to her now he said if a man
[1:55:49] have long hair it's a shame unto him
[1:55:52] it's a shame
[1:55:53] god never changed that
[1:55:56] i don't have to worry about that with
[1:55:57] most of you but men's hair because of
[1:55:59] testosterone if you understand that if
[1:56:01] you're a nurse or a doctor you'd
[1:56:02] understand that better than i would but
[1:56:04] because of testosterone present in the
[1:56:05] man and the woman has estrogen the
[1:56:07] woman's hair doesn't fall out like a
[1:56:09] man's dust thank god
[1:56:12] and sometimes it does there's always
[1:56:13] exceptions to every rule but in general
[1:56:15] that that's that's the case he said so
[1:56:17] that's nature teaching you that if a man
[1:56:20] has long hair it's a shame
[1:56:22] it wasn't built that way
[1:56:24] if a woman something's wrong
[1:56:27] he's effeminate
[1:56:28] that's what he's saying
[1:56:30] there's a lack of something and he's
[1:56:32] effeminate nature itself teaches you a
[1:56:34] man has long hair it's a shame
[1:56:36] if a woman have long hair it is a glory
[1:56:38] to her
[1:56:40] i'm about to give this up and let you
[1:56:41] preach for a minute
[1:56:43] but this is the word isn't it we believe
[1:56:45] the message of the hour he said now he
[1:56:48] said if a woman have long hair it's a
[1:56:49] glory it's not a shame
[1:56:51] it's a glory her hair is given her for
[1:56:53] covering so not a hat like the mennonite
[1:56:56] women or something would wear or the
[1:56:57] catholics would wear
[1:56:58] something or the muslims would wear a
[1:57:00] shawl or a veil he didn't say it was a
[1:57:02] veil he said he said it's not a veil
[1:57:04] it's a it's her hair that's given to her
[1:57:06] for a covering
[1:57:08] he said but if any man seem to be
[1:57:09] contentious we have no such custom the
[1:57:11] churches of god now many denominational
[1:57:14] pastors if you take this this scripture
[1:57:16] bring this verse 16 and say well see
[1:57:18] there's no custom but you can go back to
[1:57:19] any commentary you can go back to any
[1:57:22] explanation any alternate version and
[1:57:24] you'll find out that what he's saying is
[1:57:26] there's no custom of contentiousness
[1:57:29] in other words the custom in all the
[1:57:30] churches was
[1:57:32] that there's no question about this
[1:57:34] men have short hair
[1:57:36] women have long hair
[1:57:38] but the church decided this doesn't
[1:57:40] matter now look
[1:57:42] if this doesn't matter then does romans
[1:57:44] 1 matter
[1:57:47] right where he talks about men
[1:57:49] being attracted to men women attack does
[1:57:50] that matter and that's how you end up
[1:57:52] with women
[1:57:54] lesbians in the pulpit homosexuals in
[1:57:56] the pulpit
[1:57:58] right because it started in the 50s and
[1:58:00] a prophet of god
[1:58:02] looked at that coming you see why he
[1:58:04] talked about it over and over and over
[1:58:05] again and he can see where we're at
[1:58:07] today
[1:58:08] when i was told i was sitting in a in a
[1:58:10] brother's house the other day and he
[1:58:11] told me that in their school just in a
[1:58:13] rural school not far from here that
[1:58:15] there's now kids that call themselves
[1:58:17] furries i think is what they call it
[1:58:19] they give themselves a an identity of
[1:58:21] being a cat or a dog
[1:58:23] or some other kind of animal and they
[1:58:25] wear a tail
[1:58:26] in a local rural school smaller than the
[1:58:28] one here at highland
[1:58:30] that they actually they actually name
[1:58:33] themselves this and they were raising a
[1:58:34] petition because they didn't have their
[1:58:35] own bathroom their own litter box
[1:58:40] where does it end yeah
[1:58:44] well you could be whatever you want to
[1:58:45] be that's not what god said
[1:58:47] god said i made a man with with short
[1:58:49] hair i mean a woman with long hair
[1:58:52] and i wanted to stay that way
[1:58:54] because if you if you give that up about
[1:58:56] god you begin to go to all other areas
[1:58:59] and that's why brother branham was not a
[1:59:00] legalistic man he wasn't legalistic
[1:59:02] about a lot of things and he didn't just
[1:59:04] come and tell us every little way and he
[1:59:06] said i don't care how you wear it it's
[1:59:07] got to be long
[1:59:09] right and so he wasn't giving us
[1:59:10] legalism what was he telling us the word
[1:59:12] said that because there's a direct line
[1:59:14] from the women's liberation movement
[1:59:16] when they begin to cut their hair and
[1:59:17] wear pants until today when there's no
[1:59:20] difference in the gender at all and you
[1:59:22] can't even tell
[1:59:24] and we laugh at that but it comes right
[1:59:25] into the church
[1:59:27] and you can't even tell which one's
[1:59:29] which
[1:59:31] i have trouble i never had trouble as a
[1:59:33] kid i don't remember having trouble
[1:59:35] telling men from women
[1:59:36] the farmers wore overalls and
[1:59:39] and women even though they had pants and
[1:59:41] short hair but you can tell the
[1:59:42] difference i have trouble today with
[1:59:44] young people especially there are people
[1:59:46] in
[1:59:47] in in the kids of school and different
[1:59:49] places we go we'll attend at a
[1:59:50] restaurant you watch somebody come in
[1:59:52] and you gotta look for a while and you
[1:59:53] may never be able to tell
[1:59:56] whether it's a man or a woman and it's
[1:59:59] always kind of amazing to me but it's
[2:00:00] just accepted now
[2:00:02] it's just the way it is
[2:00:05] but it don't it's not accepted in your
[2:00:06] body you understand your body rejects
[2:00:08] that
[2:00:09] and that's why then you suddenly have
[2:00:10] violence and depression these kids they
[2:00:12] give them hormone blockers and
[2:00:14] everything else i know you didn't come
[2:00:15] to church necessarily to hear this this
[2:00:16] morning but we need to understand these
[2:00:18] things
[2:00:19] they give them these things and push it
[2:00:20] down their throats and say well let a
[2:00:22] kid transition even give them surgery
[2:00:25] it's barbaric
[2:00:27] there's a child that can't even decide
[2:00:28] for themselves they give them surgery to
[2:00:30] become another sex and but it started
[2:00:33] back here
[2:00:34] when the church said it doesn't matter
[2:00:36] yeah that's right
[2:00:38] the truth says for another age but a
[2:00:41] prophet does the message matter
[2:00:45] a prophet said it does matter
[2:00:48] see a church that rejects first
[2:00:49] corinthians 11 will eventually reject
[2:00:51] romans 1. how can it not because the
[2:00:54] reasons are the same if we if we hold
[2:00:56] the women to that standard we'll have
[2:00:58] fewer members and less money so if
[2:01:00] that's your standard
[2:01:01] that will change the word based on fewer
[2:01:03] members and less money you're going to
[2:01:05] have trouble one day yeah sure
[2:01:09] you understand i'm not yelling at people
[2:01:11] people can do what they want we're not a
[2:01:12] cult
[2:01:13] we don't hold one of you to this
[2:01:14] standard none of you
[2:01:16] but the word holds us all
[2:01:19] right and that's what it is the word
[2:01:20] holds it you you have to go home and be
[2:01:22] right with god after hearing the
[2:01:24] preaching of the word
[2:01:25] i don't hold you to that right i don't
[2:01:27] know what you do at home
[2:01:29] but i know this there's a god who cares
[2:01:31] about maintaining his order on the earth
[2:01:34] and there's a god who cares about you
[2:01:36] and he wants you to be right and he
[2:01:38] wants you to live before him where is
[2:01:40] pleasing in his sight i want to be
[2:01:41] pleasing to him don't you
[2:01:43] but it matters it matters more than we
[2:01:45] realize we say well don't cut your hair
[2:01:47] because the prophet said so no it leads
[2:01:49] to immorality
[2:01:51] it leads into the age that we're living
[2:01:53] in not that the people that cut their
[2:01:55] hair is are immoral that's not what i'm
[2:01:56] saying i'm saying the fact that the
[2:01:58] church allowed it then and it's come on
[2:02:00] up until it's completely gone haywire
[2:02:01] now
[2:02:02] where anything goes and they can't say
[2:02:04] anything about anything
[2:02:07] and so brother branham says this he said
[2:02:09] when you want to see the message of the
[2:02:10] hour there's nothing else you can see
[2:02:12] but that let me believe that today
[2:02:13] that's all everything else is gone the
[2:02:15] rest of it's just the filler you to see
[2:02:17] the message when no one in his group
[2:02:18] when they saw the message nothing else
[2:02:19] mattered when moses group saw it nothing
[2:02:21] else mattered when john's group saw it
[2:02:23] nothing else meant all that you could
[2:02:24] see it today
[2:02:26] that you can see it it's not a man it's
[2:02:28] christ
[2:02:30] hey man and he can give you the power to
[2:02:32] live it
[2:02:33] when the apostles group saw it nothing
[2:02:35] else mattered when luther's group saw it
[2:02:36] west is group pentecostal groups thought
[2:02:38] nothing else mattered they pulled away
[2:02:39] from everything by his foreknowledge he
[2:02:41] predestined these things to happen he
[2:02:43] knows what's in a man he knew it from
[2:02:44] the beginning what it was therefore he
[2:02:46] can make everything how many say
[2:02:48] everything this morning
[2:02:49] everything worked just exactly on clock
[2:02:52] time
[2:02:53] we get all nervous and frustrated you
[2:02:55] never seen him flustered
[2:02:57] everything's working all right just
[2:02:58] exactly the clock's ticking no he said
[2:03:00] where are you going you went from cut
[2:03:01] hair to god predestination and
[2:03:03] everything on time wait a minute he's
[2:03:04] going to bring it together
[2:03:06] he said these things that's supposed to
[2:03:08] happen all these women with short hair
[2:03:10] and these men wearing their like they
[2:03:11] got hair like their wives
[2:03:14] he said i see them absolutely have these
[2:03:16] roller curlers in their hair
[2:03:18] curl it up here in front what a
[2:03:19] perversion
[2:03:20] notice how he links it to perversion he
[2:03:23] said that's the results of satan's
[2:03:24] eating
[2:03:25] we're at the end of the end of it today
[2:03:30] that's the results of satan's eden and
[2:03:31] do like her she's trying to cut her hair
[2:03:33] like her husband her husband's letting
[2:03:35] his hair grow like his wife she is
[2:03:36] wearing his clothes he's wearing her
[2:03:38] underneath clothes
[2:03:39] she's getting masculine he's getting
[2:03:41] feminists
[2:03:43] we've watched it play out
[2:03:46] why are we different he said see it's
[2:03:48] satan's eating contrary to what god made
[2:03:50] it at the beginning that's the truth why
[2:03:52] are we different because of a message
[2:03:54] i don't want to be like this culture
[2:03:57] i don't want to be in a world where it's
[2:03:58] so confused where boys are so confused
[2:04:01] they don't know what they are and
[2:04:02] they'll play a video game and get so
[2:04:04] angry that they go shoot up a school
[2:04:06] full of children yeah sure i don't want
[2:04:08] to live in that world one day we won't
[2:04:13] but i don't want to be like that
[2:04:16] i don't want my kids confused about what
[2:04:17] they are
[2:04:19] i don't want to
[2:04:20] people say well i just want to take a
[2:04:22] stand against a cult you want to take a
[2:04:23] stand against a cult take a stand
[2:04:24] against the cult of video games
[2:04:27] that teaches people violence
[2:04:29] take a stand against the cult of
[2:04:30] pornography
[2:04:32] it teaches our young men to objectify
[2:04:34] women and teaches them that they can't
[2:04:36] even be husbands once they get married
[2:04:38] yeah are you sure
[2:04:40] i don't mean to be sound angry this
[2:04:42] morning but it just about had my feel of
[2:04:44] this world
[2:04:45] i've just about seen enough i want to go
[2:04:48] home
[2:04:50] i don't want to live in a world like
[2:04:51] that i don't want to live in a world
[2:04:52] where where you can't tell the
[2:04:53] difference and and not you can't have
[2:04:55] families anymore you realize that at the
[2:04:57] current rate of homosexuality
[2:04:59] i think the year was 2054 everybody in
[2:05:02] the world if it kept doubling at its
[2:05:04] current rate
[2:05:05] every so many years everybody in the
[2:05:06] world would be homosexual
[2:05:09] you realize in your generation some of
[2:05:11] you that are 65 and older in your
[2:05:13] generation there was one or two percent
[2:05:14] of the population you know what it is in
[2:05:16] my kids this generation 20 to 40 percent
[2:05:22] you see where we're going
[2:05:24] you say well you can't preach about that
[2:05:25] today if there ever was a time we needed
[2:05:27] to preach about it is today
[2:05:28] all right
[2:05:30] amen
[2:05:31] this is the hour when the message
[2:05:32] matters the most
[2:05:34] so what did what will satan do he'll
[2:05:36] send something to your email let's try
[2:05:37] to get you on a website they'll try to
[2:05:39] take the message away from you because
[2:05:40] this is the hour when it matters the
[2:05:42] most yes
[2:05:44] he's trying to bring everybody into his
[2:05:46] culture everybody into satan's even but
[2:05:48] we resist that why because a message
[2:05:50] come to us we were predestinated to hear
[2:05:52] it
[2:05:53] right amen
[2:05:54] the message you say well the messages
[2:05:57] are called i'll tell you what the
[2:05:58] message is the message of christ there
[2:06:00] may be cults around the message but the
[2:06:01] message of christ produces godly men
[2:06:04] women and families
[2:06:05] the message of christ produces people
[2:06:07] that live the gospel the message of
[2:06:09] christ produces people like some of you
[2:06:11] all and i'll just give you the credit
[2:06:12] right now because i may not live another
[2:06:14] day but some of y'all lived this message
[2:06:16] for years that's what the message
[2:06:18] produces
[2:06:19] and you can tell your children they can
[2:06:21] look around and see all the things going
[2:06:22] on and they can say what about him what
[2:06:24] about her and you can sit there and look
[2:06:25] at them and without any kind of
[2:06:26] arrogance at all and say but god that
[2:06:29] this message produced me this word
[2:06:31] produced me i live by the scriptures i
[2:06:33] live by the message of the hour and it
[2:06:35] produced kindness and joy and grace in
[2:06:37] my life it produced i'm not perfect but
[2:06:39] it produced something in me and it'll
[2:06:41] produce the same thing in you i remember
[2:06:44] hearing brother harold brown years ago
[2:06:45] and he said there was come a time he
[2:06:47] said when i was able to look at my son
[2:06:48] he said one day i couldn't do it but
[2:06:50] there come a time and i was able to look
[2:06:51] at my son and said son do what i do
[2:06:54] live like i live
[2:06:56] it'll bless you it'll help you
[2:06:59] that's a strong statement but paul said
[2:07:00] follow me as i follow christ i can't say
[2:07:02] that to everybody i'm not the messenger
[2:07:03] of the age but even to my children i can
[2:07:05] say son if you'll live it it'll produce
[2:07:07] a godly life
[2:07:09] daughter if you live it it'll produce
[2:07:11] love in the family
[2:07:13] it's not just a command something you
[2:07:15] have to do it'll produce love and joy
[2:07:17] and peace the fruits of the spirit the
[2:07:19] message matters i'm closing the message
[2:07:21] matters tomorrow
[2:07:24] you believe the message matters tomorrow
[2:07:26] what's in the future
[2:07:28] ain't nothing in the future in this
[2:07:29] world but heartache
[2:07:31] a system falling to pieces economic
[2:07:33] system that's going downhill
[2:07:35] but the message still matters
[2:07:37] because the message gives us hope for
[2:07:38] the future
[2:07:40] amen not just a hope but a biblical hope
[2:07:43] an expectation of what the future is you
[2:07:46] see without the message there would be
[2:07:47] no rapture we wouldn't be sure but now
[2:07:49] the message come at the end time to tell
[2:07:51] us behold the lamb of god here he is
[2:07:53] here he comes yes
[2:07:56] the bride is making yourself ready did
[2:07:58] you ever wonder what's she making
[2:07:59] herself ready with we say the word how
[2:08:01] do we know that look at revelation
[2:08:02] chapter 19 and verse 5. revelation 19

[2:08:25] i heard and said we're the voice of a
[2:08:26] great multitude that's the voice of many
[2:08:28] waters that's all of us

[2:08:32] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[2:08:34] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice this
[2:08:37] is what they're saying in response to
[2:08:39] the message that comes from the throne

[2:08:44] jeffersonville it come from the throne
[2:08:46] of god yes
[2:08:48] brother browner's voice is not the
[2:08:49] literal voice of god but the message
[2:08:51] that he preached
[2:08:54] no matter what the vocal cords did it
[2:08:55] passed over made it to be the message
[2:08:57] that he preached amen

[2:09:39] arrayed in fine linen

[2:09:45] righteousness of saints it's his
[2:09:47] righteousness
[2:09:49] amen given to us tran transmuted to us
[2:09:53] imputed to us
[2:09:54] verse 9 he saith unto me right blessed
[2:09:57] are they which are called unto the
[2:09:58] marriage supper of the lamb musicians go

[2:10:05] he sayeth unto me these are the true
[2:10:07] sayings of god
[2:10:10] you can trust them these are the true
[2:10:12] sayings and i fell at his feet
[2:10:16] to worship him
[2:10:19] and he said unto me
[2:10:21] see thou do it not
[2:10:25] i am that fellow servant and of thy
[2:10:28] brethren that have the testimony of
[2:10:30] jesus
[2:10:31] worship god
[2:10:33] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[2:10:36] of prophecy
[2:10:39] there's the coming of the prophet
[2:10:41] he's standing there the bride is
[2:10:42] rejoicing
[2:10:44] can you see it
[2:10:45] where are we at
[2:10:47] what's the next verse i saw heaven open
[2:10:51] behold the lamb see the christ that came
[2:10:53] in word form
[2:10:55] this it rap finally wraps up when he
[2:10:57] comes
[2:10:59] he doesn't come back to the earth when
[2:11:00] we meet him in the air that's his second
[2:11:02] coming but it finally wraps up this
[2:11:04] cycle wraps up at the end of the
[2:11:06] marriage supper
[2:11:07] when we're riding with him and so john
[2:11:10] in the vision he sees
[2:11:12] this this man this angel this this
[2:11:14] messenger speaking to him this voice
[2:11:16] from the throne speaking oh he's
[2:11:18] speaking to him and he's saying i'm one
[2:11:19] of your brethren don't worship me
[2:11:23] and immediately he said i saw heaven
[2:11:24] opened
[2:11:26] behold a white horse
[2:11:28] he that set upon him
[2:11:30] what was the message the message jesus
[2:11:32] christ
[2:11:34] he that set upon him was called faithful
[2:11:36] and true and then righteous
[2:11:36] righteousness he does judge and make war
[2:11:38] he is the message
[2:11:41] the messenger was just one standing by
[2:11:43] when heaven's opened
[2:11:46] oh god we just see what god has done in
[2:11:48] our hour
[2:11:50] the only hope that this world has i say
[2:11:52] this world those of us who are in this
[2:11:54] world who care about it
[2:11:55] the only hope that we have
[2:11:58] the only hope for the future the only
[2:12:00] expectation is in this message
[2:12:03] and i'll always stand for it again not
[2:12:06] because i not because i chose it but it
[2:12:08] chose me
[2:12:10] this is the hope of the future it's in
[2:12:11] this message not in a man
[2:12:14] if i was trusting brother bran i'm about
[2:12:15] to give up years ago i'm not trusting
[2:12:16] brother branham
[2:12:18] i'm trusting a message from the throne
[2:12:20] that come through brother branham
[2:12:23] are you with me now
[2:12:25] i'm not if you trust me alone you're
[2:12:27] going to be in trouble
[2:12:30] i want you to trust me but i want you to
[2:12:32] trust me so much that you give up on the
[2:12:34] word
[2:12:35] go to the word
[2:12:36] find out what it says because the
[2:12:38] message is christ the word is christ
[2:12:42] and the word places us the same
[2:12:43] yesterday shows us what we were
[2:12:46] places us in history
[2:12:49] today shows us what's going on right now
[2:12:51] doesn't it
[2:12:53] it shows us what'll take place in the
[2:12:54] future i saw heaven open
[2:12:56] a white horse
[2:12:58] let's bow our heads together
[2:13:01] said heavens will pass away but the word
[2:13:03] will never
[2:13:05] pass away
[2:13:08] i know i've been all over the place this
[2:13:09] morning i felt relaxed preaching to you
[2:13:11] and
[2:13:12] some of the things i said wasn't in my
[2:13:13] notes but maybe it was for you
[2:13:17] i don't know
[2:13:20] one of the hardest things about
[2:13:21] preaching is you can't control the
[2:13:22] outcome of the message all you do is sow
[2:13:24] seeds
[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:27] you can't control what people do that
[2:13:30] would be a forced religion it would be a
[2:13:31] cult
[2:13:32] but you can sow seeds and maybe people
[2:13:34] come go back to the word and begin to
[2:13:35] read and say oh that's what he said
[2:13:37] that's what the scripture says that's
[2:13:39] the truth i believe it if there's a seed
[2:13:42] of god there there'll be something that
[2:13:44] says i believe it lord help my unbelief
[2:13:46] if you're struggling with something
[2:13:48] today
[2:13:49] maybe maybe you've heard from some of
[2:13:51] these messengers that would come along
[2:13:52] and try to tell you that the message
[2:13:54] isn't true
[2:13:56] maybe you kind of listen to it for just
[2:13:57] a moment you say well that means i'm not
[2:13:59] bride brother branham i was driving down
[2:14:01] the road one day and he was listening
[2:14:03] to
[2:14:05] a radio station they were talking about
[2:14:06] how
[2:14:07] there was no creation and all these
[2:14:09] things he said the devil began talking
[2:14:11] to me and said well these things aren't
[2:14:13] real
[2:14:14] see to hear that voice doesn't mean
[2:14:16] you're not a christian
[2:14:18] it just means that satan's out to get
[2:14:20] you who's he out to get he's out to get
[2:14:22] the christians
[2:14:23] he's out to get you you'll you'll hear
[2:14:25] the voices of doubt
[2:14:27] but take it defend it with the word of
[2:14:29] god don't try to stand there on your own
[2:14:30] merit or anybody else well my pastor he
[2:14:33] really believes it should take the word
[2:14:35] of god he said but he also said
[2:14:38] you take the word of god and speak it
[2:14:40] right back to him like jesus did and you
[2:14:42] can overcome that maybe you've been
[2:14:44] struggling with that you just pray and
[2:14:46] ask god to help you
[2:14:47] you'll right from your seat where you're
[2:14:49] at this morning and you just say lord i
[2:14:52] i want you to come and and just solidify
[2:14:55] these things in my mind maybe i don't
[2:14:56] understand it all i want you to come and
[2:14:59] help me to understand
[2:15:00] lord help me to do that
[2:15:03] and we'll pray for you heavenly father
[2:15:05] are we
[2:15:06] we we want you to come into our lives
[2:15:09] and be our the teacher the comforter

[2:15:14] we thank you for that lord and we want
[2:15:16] you to come in today and be the teacher
[2:15:18] beyond what i could say but by the
[2:15:20] foolishness of preaching maybe you
[2:15:22] planted a seed this morning it would
[2:15:24] show us we you are the same yesterday
[2:15:26] today and forever you are the same in
[2:15:28] every aspect except the corporal body

[2:15:37] all that you do and all that you are to

[2:15:44] something in their lives and they've
[2:15:45] been struggled getting off that ass
[2:15:47] sheep oh god would you help them today i
[2:15:49] can't do that for them i wish that i
[2:15:51] could but lord would you just come and

[2:16:04] comforting hand of jehovah on us we
