========================================

ated people was the only ones that heard it and now search back the scripture down through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same name now and Jesus here referring them to the prophet and the Psalms he said they all spoke of him see and here these Jewish teachers rabis doctors of the law professors had did exactly like they had done before now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am I trying to do to show you that this Bible is the thing it's right the other day standing in a hospital room talking a sister had asked me to explain about denominations why we was against denominations uh with some denominational people you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is God see and Jesus declaring the same here that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the word made flesh now here he says search the scriptures they testify me in them you think you have eternal life that's true and they are the one that bear record of me and I'm bearing record of them and if I do not the works that's promised that I would do then don't hear me but if I do the works and you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any pler see all right now search the scriptures he said Moses and all the laws and so forth and the prophets and Psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and don't see Christ and every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word when you read in the beginning God created there's Christ see every from that to the Amen in Revelations is every word testifying of Jesus Christ that's why these added books that called the second book of Daniel and uh the book of the macbes uh adds purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoke of in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place Purgatory in there there's no place to place intersection of saints and things there's no place in there for that there's no place for denomination there's no place for for Creeds outside of the of the Bible so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people has added those and got their their their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up see they can't make it right same yesterday today and forever but if the things put together right there's the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation and God's whole plan revealed right in Jesus Christ amen that's the whole picture set together every little crooked corner it's just like not I don't mean to be sacrilegious for this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today that looks horrible say we are believers and a cow picking grass up in top of the tree don't worry that's when they say he's every way but just of a certain he's same yesterday and forever all but a certain thing see then ruin your picture the Bible said he is the same St John 5 or St John 14:12 he said he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also well that was for another age there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish and a bunch of hot sand where there's old fish at see see you got to bring him back to where he's fishing at Galilee where there's plenty of fish you see you you got to make the picture look right it's God's Great picture and there's only one way you'll see it that when you see Jesus Christ there's the entire Bible he's the principal theme of The Bible now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text it's just hard for a preacher to hold his peace you look like you want to keep going with it but you got to get back to what we're teaching on he is the principal theme of The Bible he watch in the prophets he was in the song he was in the history of the Bible the Bible Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of of ssongs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before and after what that is that making then the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday and forever brother Le where do you go to you got an awful picture there or he was the history see and he is the prophet he is the Psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same where what your picture look like do you see it all right he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 if you're writing it down he should be then he should be the principle if that's what he is and we believe it don't we amen then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing amen of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think amenl should be Christ amen that right all right since we think this since he's been made made the head of all things to us the colossian said so here he's the head of all things to us for he was made for us which we are considered all things he said what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of The Sinner if you don't accept it he was made the glory for

while Colossians chap chapter 1 and verse 18 we'll read that to get a a start tonight Colossians 1:18 as we continue in our series on Christ is the mystery of God revealed and tonight we're going to talk about the theme of our entire lives and uh he ought to be that we're going to find out out about that tonight Colossians 1:18 says and he is the head of the body the church Who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things someone say all things you might have preeminence I pray that the Lord would have his Blessing to the word you may be seated there are certain messages that brother Bron preaches that he could not preach before the opening of the seals and this is one of those messages that he preaches after the opening of the seals which could not have been preached before because it explains a lot to us about what that was all about and and really his whole Ministry what it was all about and you might look at this and say well I I don't see where this has an impact on my life but I'll say this it may have the the utmost impact on our personal lives because it tells us who we are and if we don't know who we are we're then we're vulnerable to what the devil wants to do to us in this hour which is to try to make us less than what we are to not have confidence in our weapon to fight a battle to not be able to come against the enemy because the enemy's coming in all the time isn't he's coming in and trying to destroy our homes trying to destroy our churches trying to destroy us as individuals trying to bring us down in all kinds of different ways so we but we must know who we are and when I'm saying that is not to be arrogant it's not to be anything else but it's to be able to identify ourselves in the word and say that's me like the little boy that looked in the mirror mama that's me and and so this is this is what brother brandom was doing is he's trying to place a bride uh in a certain place that's why he took as long as he did on this sermon before he left town uh and and he was getting really towards the end of his life though he may not have known that himself but there was an urgency to get this out and I'm glad that it it was was there now but brandom said he told the people just be as patient as you can he said for I feel that in this year if God will help me Will Reveal and bring into your mind he said all these other things that I've talked on through the days of the Tabernacle he said why I've said what I've said and why I've done what I've done this is why right so you want to know about brother rand's Ministry the seals the church ages adoption Hebrews this is why right this is why he said what he said this is why he did what he did and I love the fact that it comes back to the to Jesus Christ that's what it comes back to is the preeminence of Christ in the body right it comes back to him dwelling in US Christ in you the hope of glory that's what the message is about the message is not to promote some Ministry the message is not to put one person above another the message is not to beat people down the message is not about what you wear although that's part of it but that's not what it's about that's not the theme of it the theme of it is not not even what you do but the theme of it is Christ manifesting himself in our flesh that's right so brother brand said this is why he said now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now he says he introduces a statement that we we use all the time and you'll find a lot of these in Christ is the mystery of God revealed we call message catchphrases and this is where a lot of them come from because it's such an important sermon to what we believe so he says uh he says back in the back part of God's mind he said there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed he said because first there wasn't even a moon a star an atom a molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love you believe he's still expressing that attribute today aren't you glad that he is if you don't feel love if you feel unlove he's the attribute of love he he wants to express that in your life right in him was to be a father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior I'm glad he's a savior in him was to be a Healer aren't you glad he's a Healer that's in him that's his attribute he said all these great attributes that we see already expressed he said they were in God he said so he said in my opinion the first thing that he made was Angels because he he explains he said then they worshiped him that made him God so angels are what made God God God means an object of worship he said and he started from there he said as in previous messages I've tried to explain it and break it down and I didn't go back and get quotes from previous messages but you can go back and look and like the adoption series and there's many different messages Israel in the church brother brandom deals with exactly how creation took place and dramatizes it and all of that and just gives us a lot of information that was in the back part of God's mind if we can say it that way way so uh there was uh he said in previous message I tried to break it down he said then when the Angels began to worship him he said that was before there was even a molecule in the earth so the Earth the Bible says was without form and void it was nothing right there was nothing it was all Darkness wasn't no sun no moon no stars no nothing he said then he was God so before there was anything he was God cuz he created Ang so he would be God now he said as he asked Joe where was you when I laid the foundations of the world see when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy he said where were you he said that was way back before the Earth he said now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery he said and that's what I want to speak on the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God so this is a big subject because this is all of it right this is the this is an overarching View and that's that's what Christ is the mystery is it's an overarching view of the entire Bible the entire Plan of Redemption even going back previous to the Bible in the back part of God's mind he's going to show us all of it oh I'm so glad for the message of the hour and and it got to be more than just a book or a tape or something like that it's got to be a revelation it's got to be something real to us so he said where were you and and God had a purpose he said I want to speak on this purpose now he said he had in his mind before the world began how that has unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living He said then you will understand clearly then you see on I believe what is being done he keeps going back to this so listen you cannot understand the phases of brother Brandon's Ministry without understanding Christ is the mystery of God revealed said well why is that important for me to understand because if you're not careful you're looking for something else to happen and it's already taken place BR tells us that over and over he said man is always looking to what God has done looking to what he will do and not being able to see what he's doing right now right so this is about what he's doing right now right so if you understand the the phases of brother R's Ministry you understand that he calls that three polls of his ministry three polls uh and and in that he had those three things three different distinct ways that God worked you'll understand what was being done if you understand Christ is the mystery of God revealed so now he takes this and he connects it with the with the seventh seal now we we uh we dealt with the seventh seal here a while back if you remember I think I spent a few services on it and and on the seventh seal but I I was going to preach one more sermon and I didn't and now I get down to this and I realize that this is actually that and you'll hear people say that that uh there's a uh that the Christ is the mystery is actually the second part of the seventh seal and you'll actually hear preachers say that and I believe that too and this is why this is why we say that he said God's great mystery of how it's a secret he said he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it he said that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence he said the opening now watch the opening of the book was the revelation of his entire purpose of redemption right that's why I said Christ is the mystery could not have been preached before the opening of the book and and but now watch this so that seventh seal had to be open but there was silence now now there's one thing we don't know a part that we don't know and that's the day an hour of his return now brother bam alludes to that he said Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret he said and that's for the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it the coming of the Lord he said that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come he said it's a good thing that he doesn't right that's familiar right if you go back to where we were in the seventh seal I don't know how well you remember but if you go back to where we were we read those words in the seventh seal I want to read them again brother brandom if you studied the seals you know that brother brandom cuts off the end of the tape in the seventh seal and he begins again on Monday morning right and people who believe every word brother brandom said was thus that the Lord have to they have a problem with this because brother brandom actually edited his own tape yes right and it's not because it was wrong wrong it's because it could be taken wrong right it's because of us not because of him but but we know that he was a human being but the message is true those two things can be true by the way that the message can be perfect and absolute and at the same time we realize brother Brandon was a man who made mistakes and was fallible does that make sense right all the all the prophets in the bible were made mistakes too and yet the Bible is is absolute but the message is not a Bible the message is the truth of the Bible so we don't have to go back and try to make every word fit together we just let it be what it is and catch the revelation of it that make sense tonight so this is important this is foundational to believing the message of the hour right and you say well brother Ben it's not important for me to to believe the message I I just want to hear about Jesus I want to hear about Calvary and he's going to tell you about Jesus about Calvary about all of those things in here but I want you to understand how important this is to you young people this is important this is foundational because if the devil can get you mixed up on whether you believe the message is important or not he'll take you right out of the house of God right if he can get you mixed up on whether or not whe whether what a prophet says matters he'll take you right out of the house of God right he you'll be let off in every kind of a uh it's something God give it to us for a reason this is too difficult of an age for us to rely on a reformer for us to rely on the word of a of a of a dimly lit something or another that we can't we can't really see what it is but it had to be brought in Clarity it had to be brought by a prophet in our day because the devil's going to take you unless you have something in you to be a bride that won't fall and I'm so glad there's a people on the Earth today that will not fall yes but there's got to be something there why won't the bride fall because we have God has in he has reinforced us behind the message of the hour he knew we would believe it oh isn't that wonderful now so so brother brandham goes to a motel room on Monday morning and he says this he begins like this he said we be a good thing he doesn't know anything about it now what did he just say in Christ is the mystery he said that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he come when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't that's the first thing he says when he comes back in his second part of the seventh seal he said will be a good thing he doesn't know anything about it because if he did then he would impersonate that he said that's his tricks in doing things so therefore God has made it so hid to the whole world even to Heaven that there's no way of understanding it now watch he said only as God will reveal it himself right so let's go back that was from the seventh seal we'll go back to Christ is the mystery and he says this he has showed or it's almost like the same sermon he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible why couldn't Wesley see it Luther see it it took a prophet right in the Bible if you go back to 1 Samuel it says there was a time when there was no open Vision have you read that in the scripture there's no open vision and what that meant was that there was no clear word there was no Clarity to the word because there was no Prophet yeah right to tell them what was right and what was wrong we don't live in that kind of a time we live in a day with an open Vision you say well the prophet's not on the earth anymore but that's why we have the message brother the tape recorder was actually invented for the purpose the message of the hour was put on it so that we would know so you wouldn't be subject to just some whim of a Preacher right cuz I can tell you anything but you got to take it back to the word right aren't you glad you can have confidence in a preacher not because of who he is but because it goes back to the word but but don't reject something because you think it doesn't come from the word go search it out and find out first whether it does or whether it doesn't now the we we know that the so this is his he's talking about this seventh steal he said he showed it revealed in every types in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ Hallelujah see it it was everywhere yeah the the the mystery was all through the Bible but it could not be understood until this day why re Daniel 12:4 he said but thou Daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end guess where we're at tonight guess where we live we live at the time of the end and it's been revealed and and he said many will run to and fro knowledge will be increased and television programs and teachers will abound everywhere but there will be a truth somewhere Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what's he saying he's talking about the seven Thunders and under their voices he said they he said don't write it John but in the days of the voice amen when he when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he it declared to his servants the prophets oh my that ought to give us confidence today it ought to give us a uh an understanding if if God's word says this is who I am he can't change that there's nothing there's no more mystery to be revealed it's over so what that means is if I find myself looking at in the mirror of God's word and I see there a reflection of what God has made me then I know I cannot be lost amen because the word is unchangeable yeah good hallelujah amen now are you with me so far good and we'll just I'll take my time I won't hold you real late tonight but we'll have because I got to get up in the morning and drive too we're going to go over there but I'll come back on Saturday and I'm going to come back we'll have church on Sunday but we'll leave the young ones over there I can only handle so much Youth Camp just to be honest with you after about that fifth service man it just gets but it's good we we all we've always enjoyed it so I'm glad for the unity we've got among the young people going I I appreciate that so much you parents that are going so many of our older ones that are old enough to go are going we'll have more maybe next year if the Lord carries and allows us to do that thank you for doing that and I believe Lord I believe it'll be a special blessing for our youth for doing that and going together now brother brandom says he said the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible now think about it it where are you at church you say the message isn't important it is the culmination of that goal yes where we're moving from this world remember the three-fold purpose we'll get into it later on in crisis the mystery the threefold purpose the first one was God in Christ the second one is Christ in you yes right and the third one is back like the Garden of Eden again so in this three-fold purpose he's he's closing out the second fold and going into the Third that's what the message is that's what the seventh seal is it's the coming of the lord it's the closing out the blending of Time and Eternity the closing out of the of of everything that has been and the opening up of everything that will be oh true if you just realize what he's done for us in our hour with the BR said if I could pick a time to live it would be this hour that's right because what the Revelation that God has given us in this day now look en fire Bible is an expression of one goal one purpose he wanted to achieve all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been en tight and expressing what God's Great goal is now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it he said in God's help we'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it he said therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people see he said then you don't he said he said I haven't went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me but then now he goes into detail now begins to talk and types this to the disciples on Theus Road he talks about how Christ met them on the road and they didn't know who he was right and they began to tell him their story and how Jesus had died we supposed that he was the one you know that acted like some of us sometimes do and we lack revelation we supposed that this message would make us things different but now we're just walking sad along the road and seems like everything gone wrong but they didn't realize that it had gone exactly like it was supposed to go right Hallelujah so he meets them on the road and they told him their story and then Jesus responds this way in Luke 24:25 he said un them oh fools and soul of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets all the prophets he expounded oh I'd like to heard that sermon yeah he oh God you realize what brother Brandon was doing in messages like Christ is the mystery of God revealed the opening of the word it's as if we're we're on the emus Road and God's speaking through a prophet and he's telling us the things the same thing that Jesus told them Apostles on the Road God would wouldn't you like to have been there and heard that sermon as they were walking that six-hour sermon as they were walking down the road oh my sir I believe I believe we found out the same thing by the message of the hour look what was he doing identifying himself to these Apostles that all of the prophets and all of the Psalms and everything was him expressed brother Brown said he was teaching this not preaching it so people would understand he said now he was saying that all the Psalms and all the prophets spoke of him he said well there therefore that shows that all of the Old Testament someone say all all the Old Testament all the new test all the Psalms yeah if you got your Bible with you now just think about it you look at your Bible and you pick up the Old Testament the New Testament all the Psalms everything in there the singing the songs that were sung were sung of him I believe our song should still be about him he said take the 22nd Psalm and sing it and compare it with the morning of the crucifixion he said see my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my my feet my hands yet all those things there them singing that Psalm down there in the temple and crucifying the Very one said those great religious leaders those great men those great teachers yet so blinded that was reading the prophets was singing the songs and doing the crime that they said they would do they were singing the song that implicated them in the crime that they were doing oh God that's why singing the song is not enough right going to church is not enough but you got to there has to be Revelation God's got to reveal it to you look they were reading the prophets sing the songs but they could not see what could they not see the opening of the word yes right now why do I say that because Jesus was the opening of the Old Testament right the light on the Old Testament you you hear it's talk about the opening of the word you know what the opening of the word is it's the bride right because the bride is the light on the New Testament you take that home and chew on it for a while but it's actually the bride the oh God what we do brother BR said if they ever put forth another Branch or write another book of Acts behind it we're living there church we're living there what are we we are the opening of the word he was the open book The the Old Testament opened up but they couldn't see it in its open form they couldn't see it in it because it was Veil behind flesh and the same thing happens today go listen to the unveiling of God they couldn't see it in a prophet and they cannot see it in the bride right good right so they couldn't see the opening of the word so brother BR said so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that God had in his mind he hid it from all those Scholars he said and just a number of selected predestinated number a predestinated people was the only ones that heard it and now search back the scripture down to the age of the prophets and see if it was wasn't the same thing I want to elevate your thinking tonight you said well I struggle at home I'm struggling with my kids I'm struggling my marriage I'm struggling this way or that way I want to elevate your thinking tonight I want you to understand you're part of a bigger program I want you to understand you're part of something that's more than just your everyday job it's more than just what you're going through every day there's something real about this message and you can grab a hold of that you as a housewife you as a as a worker whoever you are you're a part of the economy of God you matter to God and you say well how will this help me will it help you when you lay your baby down and you realize that I may not understand all of it in my mind but somehow there's something inside of me that believes it and I know that when God when God all that he poured out of Christ he poured into the church and I know when my baby is sick I can pray I can lay hands on them and they can be well I know when my family when my kids are out of the Ark of Safety I can speak the word and they can come back that doesn't matter it does matter oh that we could Christ is the word if we could only Elevate him in our thoughts tonight we can lift him up that's what worship is is to lift him up amen yes lift him up out of History lift him up above denominations lift him up above personality lift him up that's our goal here at the church it's not to lift up a man not to lift up a preacher not to lift up the pastor but to lift him up not in on a cross because they lifted him up on a cross and he and he was crucified but let's lift him up in the way he was meant to be lifted up let's let's see him high and lifted up on his throne in his church Hallelujah I got to quit doing that I'll never finish I look he was all of it amen he said he said Jesus here paragraph 116 Jesus here referring them to the prophets in the Psalms he said they all spoke of him and here these Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors had did exactly like they had done before now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures he said what am I trying to do to show you that this Bible is the thing that's right and I know in the message sometimes we put the Bible say well we don't need the Bible anymore no the message of the hour was trying to show us that the Bible was right Wayne Lawson sent me a song the other day it's one I'd heard before but I like it he sent me a song it said it's old black song it said I know the Bible is right I means somebody's wrong you believe it today I know the Bible is right I might be wrong but the Bible's right he bad now he said search the scriptures they're the ones that testify me he said the other day standing in a hospital room talking and sister asked me to explain about denominations we was against denominations with some denominational people now now that's a good question why are we not a denomination brother brand preach do an entire sermon on that but see denomination takes Creed over the word so Christ cannot be preeminent in any church that takes anything thing over the word Let Me Go a step further Christ cannot be preeminent in your life if you put anything over the word a job money finances brother Bram said that talking about somebody that would would take a I'm not quoting verbatim but that there's a there's a quote brother brother BR talks about how that a person that would uh would put not put God first I just put it that way he said it' be like the Jing Ling of judas's coins in your pocket that's pretty strong isn't it he must be preeminent in our lives you believe it tonight now look you you denomination takes Creed over the word so we can't be a denomination we don't have Creeds and even like I said talk about these catchphrases that we got to be careful that that doesn't just become a message Creed or a message Dogma we believe the word right he said he said you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is God and Jesus declaring the same here that the word is him he said you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word made flesh he said now here he says search the scriptures they testify of me in them you think you have eternal life and that's true and they are the one that bear record of me and I'm bearing record of them and if I do not the works that's promised that I would do then don't hear me but if I do the works you can't believe me but leave the works because they testify he is the word he said oh it looks like it couldn't be any pler he said all right now search the scriptures he said Moses and all the laws and so forth the prophets and Psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he said he is now listen he is the principal theme sir of the entire Bible if you read the Bible here's another quote you've heard before if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse of it go back back and read it again just open up my Bible and read look it's talking about 1 Chronicles 26 26 shouth and his breth were over all the Treasures of the dedicated things which David the king and the chief fathers the captains over thousands and hundreds and the captain of the host had dedicated he said brother Ben what does that have to do with Jesus look he's the theme yes right he he is the temple of God just think about it for a minute he is the temple of God you say well that's just you go back and go back in uh uh in numbers or or book like that and it just name after name after name after name you say what what good is that well it's teaching us something it's telling us something in every verse it points to him it it may it may you may have to walk up some steps to get there but it points to him right you might put this verse with that and with that one with that one but eventually it points to him when you finally get behind the curtain it's him are you with me now all of the things that were in the Old Testament all the things in the New Testament speak of Christ now he said if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you miss something the Bible is Christ he is the word right he said when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ now people say he wasn't God or wasn't there at that time have a problem with that he said from from that to the Amen in Revelation is every word testifying of Jesus Christ and David put it this way in the Psalms he said then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me in the volume of the book now David is talking about the the petuk which is the first five books of Moses that's all they had written at the time he said in all five books of Moses it's written of me amen no no other part even uh even uh Adam Clark understands this when he says it this way he said he said that's what had been committed to writing this whole book speaks about Christ and his accomplishing the will of God not only in the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed but in all the sacrifices and sacrificial rights mentioned in the law he is all of it amen now if you go back and there something strange you'll find what brother brandham taught about that in the old commentaries but not the new ones they try to say Well it if you put it in their context it doesn't speak of Christ but brother brand said it did Paul said it did right the the the reformers even understood that it did so it types Christ now look the brand said that's why I got a question on this one time and he said that's why we don't use these other books like the uh the Apocrypha he said that's why these added books that they call the second book of Daniel book of mccabes adds purgatory and stuff like that he said see it's not spoke of in the Scripture it doesn't theme up there's that word again it doesn't theme up with the rest of it now what's a theme you been to a theme park a real theme park is one with one theme so everywhere you go at Silver Dollar City say because that's really the only one I go to if you're wondering or Dollywood I guess everything in silver dollar St is 1880s right they go to Great extreme great extremes to theme up the entire theme park it it means to set or to place so they're placing you in 1880 the Bible places you in Christ amen he is the thing right so they're trying to place you in an era or or or a say Disneyland Mickey Mouse or in a with a certain feeling where you can lose yourself right and you can just you can just walk around and and you feel like a kid again right you feel like or you feel like you're in the 1880s and you hear the music and all the theme until you if you could go behind those buildings they just false fronts but but it's the theme tells you right that that you belong in that era and the Bible tells you that you belong in Christ are you with me now yes he's the theme he's the theme that's how Webster defined it in Webster 1828 dictionary to set or to place in music it's a series of notes selected as the text or subject of a new composition so each note is is is different each note by itself you'd never see a theme but when you put it all together there's a theme to the music oh church that's why we don't isolate scriptures we don't isolate quotes but we put it all together and when you put it all together it's Christ Heen when you put everything that we do everything we're striving for it's Christ are you with me now so when you take every note together you put Joseph and and Jacob and and and Elijah and all of them together it's Christ Oh look The theme is not William Brandon the theme is not Ben PR it the theme is Christ oh I love that sir amen I love that and William Brandon brother Brandon pointed you to Christ that's right and I hope today I can point you to Christ through a prophet's message you understand but I hope also I hope also that we can point each one of us to Christ by Our Lives now look brother said there's no place to place Purgatory in there now watch place it's not in the theme right you put P Purgatory in it's like seeing a brand new uh car driving down the street in silver dollar City you don't expect to see it there right it it's out of place there's no place to put Burgatory in the theme of Christ there's no place to place intercession of saints there's no place in there for that there no place for a denomination there's no place for Creeds outside of the Bible he said so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture now why look at every false Doctrine that's come to this message since we've been alive some of y'all seen a bunch of them yeah but I saw a bunch of them too because how we raised and everything I I was exposed to a lot of different doctrines look at all of them what's the problem but the Jared they every one of them when you put them together they point to this preacher or that preacher or this church or that church or this Doctrine or that Doctrine or that man or a prophet or a priest or somebody else but they do not point to Christ yeah right when you put the Bible together you get the picture right it points to Christ he said if the thing is put together right now now let me go back he said when you see these things they just don't come in the picture that's why people have added those and got their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up he said they can't make it right same yesterday today and forever he said but if the thing is put together right there is the entire picture of the Fallen regeneration the whole picture of creation and God's whole plan revealed right in Jesus Christ he said that's the whole picture set together he said every little Crook and corner he said I don't mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today that looks horrible say we're Believers and the cow's picking grass up in top of the tree he said it don't work right if you had a puzzle where the cow you got the cow made right because that's what you do first is it in the puzzle you make the the cow nobody else does that I I do the borders first and then the then the then the objects and then you fill in the grass and stuff and you get done and the cows in top of the tree eating grass you got a problem right that's what he's saying he said but now he said you he said when they say he's every way but just of a certain he's the same yesterday today and forever all but a certain thing see then you ruin your picture yeah that's right the Bible said he is the same St John 1412 he said he anybody he I love that there's a message Doctrine or not a message Doctrine an anti- message doctrine that says that the he in John 14:12 is brother brandham but this is what the brother brandham said about the he he said he anybody right he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also well that was for another age he said there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish in a bunch of hot sand where there's no fish at you got to bring him back to where he's fishing at Galilee where there's plenty of fish now brother Brown uses the term and steuart had some fun with it on Sunday cuz we were back there looking for the quote and brother M says it several times but not not in the Pulpit but the steart and we we were back there and and he was having fun with this brother brand said you need to get your brain baptized do you know he said that that's pretty harsh right there but he said you need to get your brains baptized says it several places and what he's talking about is you just if it doesn't make sense there's a reason it doesn't make sense now that don't mean you have to be able to put together every little thing all the dates and all of that but it the overall picture ought to make sense it shouldn't be so complicated that your kids have no hope hope of ever grabbing hold of it it shouldn't be no so complicated that your young people have no hope of ever grabbing hold of it it has to make sense as a whole so he said you got to you got to make the picture look right it's God's great picture and there's only one way you'll ever see that he said when you see Jesus Christ there is the entire Bible he is the principal theme of The Bible Amen brother Bram takes that and brother Herald he looks at that and he says you could take a sermon he said on every one of these thoughts well we're going to try to do that he said he's the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible he said the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history he said also in the Bible is he is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever he was in the prophets and Moses said the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet like unto me and Isaiah it says of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end he Reign upon the throne of David to order and establish with judgment and Justice and Micah he said he'll be born in Bethlehem out of thee shall he come forth unto thee that is to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from old from Everlasting in Psalms it says the stone which the builders refused has become the head of the corner what was it he was in the prophets he's in the Psalms Proverbs even speaks of him did you know that Proverbs speak of him he said I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning wherever the Earth was Song of Solomon 56 s even in the Song of Solomon it speaks of him he said he's allog together lovely oh I'm glad that I love that he's allog together lovely the history he's in the history in 1 Samuel Samuel is a historical book it says I Will Raise Me Up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind and I'll build him a sure house and he shall walk walk before man anointed forever what is it's Christ just to give you a sample brother BR said he was also the things to come so he's the history he's the prophets he's the Psalms and he's the things to come Zacharias said his feet this is why we believe in a literal Corporal return of Jesus Christ right that's what the scripture said his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of oliv which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of oliv shall cleave in the midst thereof from toward the East and toward the west there shall be a very great valley and half the mountains shall moved toward the North and half of it toward the South what is it it's Christ in his future work and things to come now if you don't have any faith you can't believe that but I believe it's coming he said brother Brown said you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday today and forever he said where do you go to you got an awful picture there he was the history he is the prophet he's the Psalms he's everything you can't make him everything in the same he said what your picture look like like he said he is the thing now if you go back and listen to that when he says thing he may be saying thing I think he's saying theme they've TR they put that in here as thing but I think he's saying he's the theme but he says it like thing said he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 is the thing now look he he should be he should be the Principal he said if that's what he is he said we believe it don't we then if he is that I'm closing in just a moment if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking now we're going to apply it of our walking amen of our thinking of our [Music] singing it's not about me it's about him the preaching is not about me it's about him the singing is not about me it's about him that's why it doesn't matter you say well I get my feelings hurt cuz they never asked me to sing it's not about you just like it's not about me it's about him let's worship him if I never get asked to sing and I probably won't ever get asked to sing but if I never get asked to sing let me be one who worships him who puts as much effort when I'm in the seat as I am when I'm in the Pulpit right I want to do that I I I purpos to do that in my life that I put just as much effort I listen I go to a meeting and get wore out back in the preacher that's just the truth of it I'm not saying you should be like me but but he's the theme of my life it's not about me I get just as excited when somebody else brings the word a lot more excited sometimes when somebody else brings the word as when I do right what is it he's the theme I don't have to be behind the pulpit he's the theme it's not me it's him he's the theme of our talking our thinking our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's a principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything yes we do think about that for a minute everything how can he be the Principal theme at the funeral home he has to be that make sense I can be a principal theme when I'm testing pavement well he he has to be right I'm at school whatever it is that you do I'm at home you you ladies are at home and yeah he's the principal theme he's the principal theme when I'm on Facebook the principal theme when I'm huh right he's the principal theme when no matter what I'm doing he's the theme and he says he's the theme of everything we do say or think yes well thatd get rid of a lot a a whole lot of our anxious thoughts wouldn't it if an eternal if the Eternal God if we recognize who Jesus is is the principal theme how could we be anxious right he's the theme of our life he's going to do what's best for me he's going to work it out it's going to be all right cuz he's the theme good he ought to be the theme of our homes come on oh God help me not to make with the theme of my home but to let Christ be the theme of my home as the musicians come brother Bram he talks about you've all heard the story but for you young ones maybe brother B tells a story about a magic flower you know that tells a story about a magic flower and it's just a story it's not in the Bible he tells a story about the magic flower and he said this man was poor and he found a magic flower that said said I'll give you whatever you ask for so he looked at a mountain that was over there on the side of uh and he said he said let that mountain side open up he said I want to go in he said and be able to find all the riches I could ever want and the flower said okay so he opened it up and he walks inside takes the flower with him you know walks inside sets the flower down and he gets some silver it's a whole pocket full of I'm go I'm going to go tell some of my buddies what I found man I I'm rich and the flower says but don't forget the main thing he goes back he grabs some gold he said I'll take some gold and I I I'm rich I'll show my buddies said don't forget the main thing he said I'm going to I'm going to run and and uh and get some diamonds he grabs some Diamond said don't forget the main thing finally gets tired of hearing it you know like sometimes you get tired of hearing the preacher and he say oh you just shut up and he runs out with his gold and when he does the mountain side closes up the gold disappears what was it the flower was the main thing the the gifts aren't the main thing the gold wasn't the main thing the preachers aren't the main thing are you with me now the prophets weren't even the main thing he was the main thing with all when you get all the gifts and you get everything else when you get everything in life maybe you'll get everything all your dreams will come true and I hope that they do but don't forget the main thing make him the principal theme of your life will we can we do that tonight would you bow your heads with me to begin to play something softly is the principal theme of our talking oh God I maybe a little repentance is in order for me maybe maybe my life would go a little bit better maybe I'd get along a little bit better with my loved ones if he was the principal theme of our conversations he was the principal theme of our life and I think it's not that we don't talk about carnal things we do and yet there's that overarching theme whatever we we don't want to be like the pig that sat Under The Apple Tree he sat there for years eating apples never did look up to see where the apples come from we we want to acknowledge Lord you give me these things Lord you bless me you you help me the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord David said I once was young and now I'm old I've never I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed begging bread I'm going to believe that God can take care of me let him be the Principal theme would you do that Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I I'm sorry Lord where I haven't done that yet I know your message has called me Lord to come to that place where you are everything to me you are everything to my family Lord you are everything to my children oh God you've called us to that place Lord higher than other ages Lord to come to that place cuz you knew that in this hour the devil would be so he'd make Le to see us so attractive but oh God may we may we make you the principal theme of all things of Our Lives of our songs Lord may we take it seriously what we do in the house of God not only in the house of God but in our homes and our jobs Lord may we recognize that you are all in all we will not crush your word we will not we will not think we have a better idea we will not take Creed instead of the word but we'll be a virgin bride to you oh God we will accept every word that you have for us I pray you grant it tonight Lord I pray you'd forgive us where we've not done that and help us oh God thank you for this message that calls us back to Christ it

already healed Lord on Calvary by your stripes we were healed Lord I pray that the healing would take effect in our bodies Lord that each one oh God that needs it I believe Lord that you're a savior
