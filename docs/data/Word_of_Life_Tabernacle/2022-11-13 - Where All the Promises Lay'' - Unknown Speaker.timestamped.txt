[45:36] verse 8 Hebrews chapter 11 verses 8
[45:39] through 10 we'll go right into the word
[45:40] this morning
[45:43] something that's been on my heart for a
[45:45] while but I just had the time to
[45:48] approach it this week and you just bear
[45:51] with me this morning and
[45:53] pray for me and preach with me if you
[45:55] would and we'll get through it amen amen
[45:58] it's good to be here good to see all of
[46:00] you with us and those that are still
[46:03] sick we're praying for them this morning
[46:05] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8.
[46:09] it says by faith Abraham when he was
[46:11] called to go out into a place which he
[46:14] should after receive for an inheritance
[46:16] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[46:19] whether he went
[46:22] so he was called to go out to a place
[46:26] and by faith he sojourned and what that
[46:29] word means is that he was a stranger
[46:30] there he was an alien
[46:32] so he did not he was not a citizen of
[46:34] that country
[46:36] but he's adjourned there as a foreigner
[46:38] in the land of promise as in a strange
[46:40] country
[46:41] dwelling in Tabernacles or tents with
[46:44] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[46:47] the same promise
[46:48] for he looked for a city
[46:50] which hath foundations
[46:53] some place that was real someplace he
[46:55] could put his Stakes down and would not
[46:58] be a temporary dwelling place whose
[47:02] Builder and maker is God Amen I pray the
[47:06] Lord with that is blessing to the word
[47:07] you may be seated
[47:09] I want to title this this morning where
[47:11] all the promises lay
[47:15] Abraham was looking for a place where
[47:19] the promises given to him could be
[47:21] fulfilled
[47:23] and he knew that he was promised a
[47:25] certain land and he was directed to go
[47:27] out into that land and sojourned there
[47:30] it was the land flowing with milk and
[47:33] honey the place itself was a promise but
[47:37] also it was a place of promises so all
[47:41] of the promises lay in the land here as
[47:44] he would enter into the land he knew
[47:47] that as he would walk into it that that
[47:49] land contained all of the promises it
[47:53] would not only be a Promised Land itself
[47:55] but within it would be his body change
[47:58] within it would be the promised son
[48:01] within it would be his Blessing within
[48:03] it would he would become a blessing to
[48:05] others only in that land and so God told
[48:09] Abraham he said I'm going to bless you
[48:10] I'm going to make you a great nation I'm
[48:13] going to I'm going to preserve you I'm
[48:15] going to make you a blessing to other
[48:18] people and and that's us this morning we
[48:21] want to achieve all that God promise to
[48:24] us we we want to be everything that God
[48:26] wants us to be we're we're not here to
[48:28] go halfway in or or to step barely into
[48:31] the Waters of God but we want to go all
[48:34] the way in and and that's where Abraham
[48:37] was he said in order to be all the way
[48:39] in I'm going to have to journey in this
[48:41] land I'm going to have to make my temp
[48:43] in this land and you find that whenever
[48:45] he was in the land those promises could
[48:48] come true
[48:49] he was becoming a blessing to others he
[48:51] was a Sojourner a stranger he never
[48:54] owned a piece of that land until Sarah
[48:57] died and when Sarah died all of a sudden
[48:59] Abraham bought a piece of land and the
[49:03] reason why he decided at that time to
[49:05] buy land
[49:06] was because there was a promise of a
[49:09] resurrection
[49:10] and so he knew that the promises were
[49:12] yet unfulfilled there was something more
[49:15] than what he had experienced so far and
[49:17] so you could say well so far he had
[49:19] experienced the promised son he'd
[49:21] experience a body change he'd seen all
[49:24] of these things and yet he knew there
[49:26] was a spiritual promise for the job
[49:27] beyond that a promise of eternal life a
[49:30] promise of a resurrection a promise and
[49:33] so he knew that there was something
[49:35] coming and so he said I want to buy a
[49:37] piece of that land and do he buys Sarah
[49:40] the cave of mcpila and and he buys the
[49:43] land there and he buys himself a plot
[49:45] there and they were buried in the land
[49:48] of the promise brother Branham picks up
[49:50] on that and he said bury me in that land
[49:54] that's where I want to be is in the land
[49:56] of the promise
[49:57] because that's where the promises are
[50:00] so the resurrection promises in the land
[50:03] and his grandson Joseph was a mighty
[50:06] ruler and in Egypt and you know the
[50:08] story I went down into Egypt and yet he
[50:11] said don't leave me here because Egypt
[50:14] is not the Promised Land
[50:16] and what I want to tell you this morning
[50:18] in as a church where we want to go this
[50:20] morning it's good to have Catherine with
[50:22] us this morning you're always good to
[50:24] see each and every one of you but
[50:25] Catherine it's been a while uh her
[50:28] getting here so we're glad to have her
[50:29] today and
[50:30] and um
[50:32] one of these days maybe we'll we'll have
[50:34] more weddings who knows so
[50:37] but we've had a lot of weddings lately
[50:39] but Abraham going into the land and and
[50:43] and Joseph you know the land Egypt was
[50:46] not the Promised Land
[50:48] how many know that today it was a land
[50:50] where they could live but it was not the
[50:52] land where the promises lay it was a
[50:55] land where they could they could
[50:56] experience growth and even promotion but
[50:59] not the land where the promises lay and
[51:01] we want to be in the land where the
[51:03] promises lay denomination is not our
[51:06] land
[51:06] right the world is not our land we you
[51:09] might have a good job but that's not
[51:10] your land that's not where the promise
[51:12] lays the promise doesn't lay in your job
[51:15] the promise doesn't lay in your family
[51:16] the promise doesn't lay in some preacher
[51:19] somewhere but the promises in the word
[51:21] is in Christ
[51:23] amen
[51:25] so now uh
[51:27] he's his Joseph was a mighty ruler but
[51:31] he said bury me in that land are you
[51:33] with me this morning I wish I had the
[51:35] voice to preach today
[51:38] thank you
[51:40] but he said there come a time
[51:43] that the land would have to be possessed
[51:45] he said when you go back down there
[51:47] after 400 years I want you to carry my
[51:50] bones back to that land
[51:52] and but it was it was Joshua you know
[51:55] Moses could bring them out of Egypt
[51:58] but it was Joshua's Ministry that would
[52:00] take them in with the promises lay
[52:03] Moses could only take them so far but
[52:06] Joshua could lead them on in to the
[52:09] promised land
[52:11] and so as just kind of laying a
[52:13] background for where we want to go this
[52:14] morning and brother Branham sees a
[52:17] vision he relates it in Paradox and I've
[52:19] read it to you before
[52:21] but he said it was about three o'clock
[52:22] in the morning he said I'd gotten up and
[52:24] I looked in front of me and I was coming
[52:26] down to the Jordan he said look like I
[52:28] was standing on the map of Palestine I
[52:30] was coming down to the Jordan and it
[52:32] seemed like I could hear the song I'm
[52:34] going down to the Jordan someone was
[52:35] singing it and as I drew near the river
[52:38] I looked back and seen which way I had
[52:40] come I was two-thirds of the way there
[52:43] to the Jordan yeah and I looked across
[52:46] Jordan and I said oh praise God
[52:48] just on the other side is where all the
[52:52] promises lay
[52:53] excuse me every promise lays in the
[52:57] promised land every promise lays in the
[53:01] promised land now again Abraham saw that
[53:04] as as a natural land he knew that all of
[53:08] those things that he was promised lay in
[53:10] that land and you and I have a land and
[53:13] and we can look at our land and say all
[53:15] the promises not not just some of them
[53:18] but all of them
[53:22] promise of healing lays in that land our
[53:25] promise to the Salvation of our children
[53:27] lays in that land yes everything good
[53:30] that we can have from God lays in that
[53:32] land so why should we look for something
[53:35] else or or for somewhere else to go the
[53:38] promises in that land
[53:41] he said brother Ben where is Our Land
[53:43] what is Our Land
[53:45] where do the promises lay
[53:48] I I want to take you to
[53:51] adoption the message adoption
[53:54] and brother Branham at the end of that
[53:55] message a man comes forward a brother
[53:58] says pray for me brother Branham to have
[54:00] the Holy Ghost
[54:01] he said I want to receive the Holy Ghost
[54:03] he said I have to I have a desire I have
[54:06] to receive the Holy Ghost
[54:08] and he said you have a desire to receive
[54:10] it you want to come into the land where
[54:12] all the promises is notice how brother
[54:14] Branham frames it he said you want to
[54:17] come into the land how many want to come
[54:19] into the land this morning
[54:21] So This Is Our Land This Is Where We
[54:23] Belong
[54:24] and it's why we want to have the
[54:26] atmosphere right in our services it's
[54:28] why we want to have the atmosphere right
[54:30] in our homes it's why we want to fight
[54:33] to stay in the land of the Holy Ghost
[54:36] because he said this is where you want
[54:38] to come he said I want the Holy Ghost he
[54:40] said well you want to come into the land
[54:46] where all the promises is
[54:49] and he said now Lord he's praying he
[54:52] said this boy is just across the river
[54:54] camped on the other side and Jordan is
[54:58] swelling and there's no way for him to
[55:00] cross except you make a way like you did
[55:03] for Joshua and for Israel and father I'm
[55:08] asking you as your servant let our
[55:10] precious brother o God let him enter
[55:12] into this Promised Land This Promise he
[55:15] said that on the other side as I was
[55:16] carried the other night may I have the
[55:18] privilege of grabbing him and throwing
[55:20] oh my arms around him in that other land
[55:22] saying my precious brother he said
[55:24] granted Lord may he receive the promise
[55:27] of God the Holy Ghost so we realize then
[55:30] that that land we could say in that land
[55:33] is the holy ghost or we could put it
[55:35] like this we know Joshua was the type of
[55:37] the Holy Ghost and we know that the land
[55:39] is the full Promises of God it's the
[55:42] fullness of what we are to become and
[55:44] what we are to be it's the fullness of
[55:46] the word we could say it's it's the open
[55:48] book it's it's the promise of God for
[55:51] our age the land that we're entering
[55:54] into is the rapture can we say it that
[55:56] way that's the fullness that's what
[55:58] we're longing for
[56:00] foreign
[56:05] into that land we've got to enter into
[56:08] that promise and the only thing that can
[56:11] take us there is the Holy Ghost
[56:15] we cannot be carried into that Land by
[56:18] by the law
[56:21] now think about it for a moment your
[56:23] pastor's instructions cannot carry you
[56:26] into the land
[56:30] I can tell you how to live
[56:32] I can advise you what to do but that's
[56:36] not going to take you into the land
[56:38] that's not Joshua
[56:40] are you with me now Joshua's the Holy
[56:42] Ghost
[56:44] your your church cannot carry you over
[56:47] right being a member of a certain Church
[56:49] won't take you over being a part of say
[56:52] I'm a message believer that won't take
[56:54] you over believing in a prophet won't
[56:56] take you over
[56:57] saying I love the message I love the
[56:59] prophet I love the things of God that's
[57:01] not going to take you into the land but
[57:04] it's the holy ghost that carries you
[57:05] into the land if you want to go into the
[57:07] land of promise what do you need today
[57:09] you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:12] yeah
[57:15] do we believe that today
[57:23] devil
[57:26] so now we're going to enter into this
[57:28] this Promised Land
[57:30] where the promises of God can be take
[57:33] full effect in our lives
[57:35] where we can become something more than
[57:37] what we are in ourselves
[57:41] but the Branham even talks about that
[57:42] and we realize that in that Holy Ghost
[57:44] Land again it's all of the promises so
[57:47] we don't just stop when we receive the
[57:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost but it is that
[57:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost it carries us
[57:54] into the land and actually makes us
[57:57] become what God wants us to be it
[58:00] positionally places Us in the land of
[58:03] the word
[58:05] right and so now we want to enter into
[58:07] the full promises and brother Branham
[58:08] when he's preaching as I was with Moses
[58:10] so I will be with thee he's talking
[58:12] about his own Ministry he said the hour
[58:15] has come when I'm tired staying on this
[58:17] mountain I want to go up to Jordan I
[58:20] want to enter into the full promises how
[58:23] many can say Amen to that this morning
[58:25] I'm tired of of circling around this
[58:27] mountain I want the full Promises of God
[58:30] I'm tired of the devil getting to beat
[58:32] me up every day I'm tired of having to
[58:35] give in to him or you have been out I'm
[58:37] tired of having to beg and plead and I
[58:40] want to stand on the Promises of God I
[58:42] want to believe the word of God I want
[58:44] to be a happy I want to have a happy
[58:46] home I want to have a nice home I want
[58:48] to live for God I want to do what's
[58:50] right I want to I'm tired maybe you've
[58:52] struggled with some addiction or
[58:53] something in your life you say I want to
[58:55] go into the full Promises of God I'm
[58:57] tired of these besetting sins I'm tired
[59:00] of this lack of faith I'm tired of
[59:01] stepping back and wondering and just
[59:03] halfway living as a Christian and
[59:05] sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
[59:07] I want to go into the holy of holies I
[59:10] want to go in with the promises
[59:12] right are you hearing me this morning
[59:16] I want to go in on the inside I want to
[59:18] go into a deeper walk
[59:20] I want to go beyond just
[59:23] a pastoral religion
[59:25] where it's just the pastor's religion
[59:27] and I take it or my mom and dad's
[59:28] religion or somebody else's I want to go
[59:31] beyond that
[59:33] I want to go in with the promises lay
[59:35] yes
[59:36] oh my where the Holy Ghost can take
[59:39] control over my life
[59:44] oh my
[59:45] this is the desire of my heart this
[59:47] morning
[59:48] he said I want to get Faith Within
[59:51] Myself
[59:51] not looking to a sign not looking to
[59:54] something God has revealed or some kind
[59:57] of signpost I want to look towards
[59:59] Calvary and say by faith I come Lord God
[1:00:02] I'm coming in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:06] oh my so he's saying I want to get to a
[1:00:08] place where the promise is not in the
[1:00:10] future but the promise is right here all
[1:00:13] around me
[1:00:15] see there was a time when the promise in
[1:00:18] Israel was in the future they say here
[1:00:20] they were in Egypt they were not in the
[1:00:22] land and so they said well someday will
[1:00:23] be delivered someday will be taken out
[1:00:26] but there had to come a time when their
[1:00:28] feet walked on the land and they said
[1:00:30] now we are delivered
[1:00:32] huh now we're coming out
[1:00:35] now we're children of God yes
[1:00:37] now we can take a sword and say our
[1:00:41] enemy we were slaves in Egypt but we're
[1:00:44] Kings and Priests in the Promised Land
[1:00:48] so I want to get to a place where the
[1:00:50] promise is not in the future
[1:00:52] and this is why so many doctrines around
[1:00:54] this message it'll come up and and
[1:00:56] they'll put the promise some other time
[1:00:58] or some other place
[1:01:00] and they'll say well brother Branham you
[1:01:02] know he didn't get all the way into the
[1:01:03] promised land and so we're waiting on
[1:01:05] him to come back so he can go all the
[1:01:06] way in now I'm here to tell you he
[1:01:09] walked all the way into the third pole
[1:01:10] he walked all the way into the anointing
[1:01:12] of God he walked all the way into the
[1:01:14] open book
[1:01:16] and it was come back in our day we've
[1:01:19] already we've already seen the word
[1:01:21] common return in in word form Christ and
[1:01:24] word form return in our day what are we
[1:01:26] waiting on we're not waiting on anything
[1:01:27] we're just letting the Holy Ghost lead
[1:01:29] us through the land
[1:01:32] so we want to get to a place where the
[1:01:35] promise is not in the future
[1:01:37] or in some other Church
[1:01:40] all right I want to make us think this
[1:01:42] morning
[1:01:43] not in some other place
[1:01:46] well someday you know when the church
[1:01:48] grows and then we'll we'll all be you
[1:01:51] know on fire we'll have a real Revival
[1:01:52] what about today
[1:01:54] yeah
[1:01:56] someday all these kids will grow up will
[1:01:58] have a real youth group what about are
[1:02:00] we doing right now
[1:02:03] now it's time to get them saved
[1:02:07] right now it's time to get them in the
[1:02:09] atmosphere
[1:02:10] Now's the Time to really really begin to
[1:02:12] dig Now's the Time to show them what a
[1:02:14] real Praying Mother a real praying
[1:02:16] father is
[1:02:18] not going to get any easier
[1:02:20] the world's not going to get any lighter
[1:02:22] it's not going to get any it's not going
[1:02:24] to get any better it's only going to get
[1:02:26] worse
[1:02:27] but we're in the land
[1:02:29] hey man
[1:02:31] so it's all around us listen in Joshua
[1:02:34] 18 you'll find there that Joshua has
[1:02:38] they've come into the land and he's told
[1:02:40] them he's by Lots he's cast different
[1:02:42] ones he showed them where their land is
[1:02:45] and they come on into into chapter 18
[1:02:47] and he and they set up Shiloh and
[1:02:50] they've got a place there where they can
[1:02:52] worship and and they've got to land and
[1:02:54] that's been taken part of it but yet
[1:02:57] seven tribes it's still not possessed
[1:02:59] the land
[1:03:00] and Joshua challenges them and he says
[1:03:02] how long are you Slack to go to possess
[1:03:06] the land
[1:03:07] which the Lord God of your fathers hath
[1:03:09] given you now this is years after he's
[1:03:12] LED them into the land and he showed
[1:03:14] them he said this is yours
[1:03:16] this belongs to you
[1:03:19] but he said and he described it even in
[1:03:21] a book he showed it to him he said
[1:03:22] describe it by seven Parts in a book and
[1:03:24] and show it to the people and so they
[1:03:26] described it and they walked through it
[1:03:28] and they said this is ours
[1:03:30] but they hadn't went out and walked on
[1:03:31] it yet
[1:03:33] so he said how long are you slack to go
[1:03:35] to possess the land which Lord your
[1:03:37] fathers hath given you so he's not
[1:03:39] preaching them something well there's
[1:03:41] something coming and one day you'll be
[1:03:43] able to do it but he's saying why are
[1:03:45] you slacked to go do it
[1:03:47] now what was this land that they were
[1:03:50] going to possess
[1:03:52] and we know and each patriarch was named
[1:03:55] by their mother under a certain promise
[1:03:56] that placed them in that land
[1:03:58] and their name actually spoke of the
[1:04:01] land that they would go to and be a part
[1:04:03] of and we don't have time to run through
[1:04:04] all of that this morning but you all
[1:04:06] understand
[1:04:07] and but the random deals with that on
[1:04:09] adoption and brother Bram says Joshua
[1:04:11] not knowing this but by inspiration
[1:04:14] letter of the Holy Spirit after being
[1:04:16] into the promised land give each man his
[1:04:18] promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[1:04:21] promised through the birth back there
[1:04:23] he said how that God has set some in the
[1:04:25] church now notice that that the mothers
[1:04:28] when they would have those patriarch
[1:04:30] babies they would they would actually as
[1:04:32] they were having going through the labor
[1:04:34] pains they would cry out their name and
[1:04:36] that name would positionally place them
[1:04:38] in the land and sometimes we wonder why
[1:04:41] we go through pain in life why are we
[1:04:42] why we have struggles and why we have
[1:04:44] why we have to fight through things and
[1:04:47] why Lord if you've called me to preach
[1:04:48] why do I have to fight so hard to stay
[1:04:50] in my position if you've called me to be
[1:04:52] a teacher or if you called me to be a uh
[1:04:56] some kind of a worker in the field
[1:04:58] whatever it is that you've called me to
[1:04:59] be why do I have to fight so hard to be
[1:05:02] in that position why do I have to do
[1:05:04] that well because those labor pains is
[1:05:06] actually what brings inspiration
[1:05:09] it's when you have to work for it that's
[1:05:11] when the inspiration comes
[1:05:14] are you hearing me this morning when
[1:05:16] everything's easy and the church is full
[1:05:18] and anybody can preach you now oh
[1:05:20] everybody's excited that's wonderful but
[1:05:22] when you have to work for it when you
[1:05:24] have to press for it when you got to
[1:05:25] fight the battle when you don't feel
[1:05:27] good and you come to the house of God
[1:05:29] anyway that's when the inspiration comes
[1:05:32] it's in those labor pains
[1:05:35] he said oh they get tremendous sometimes
[1:05:38] when a church is groaning under the
[1:05:40] persecution of the outside world
[1:05:42] and this is why we're persecuted he said
[1:05:45] Believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[1:05:47] promise for the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:05:49] real to us as it was to Pentecost
[1:05:53] how they groan and cry under labor pains
[1:05:57] oh my because so many have stopped short
[1:06:01] they stopped short of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:03] they stopped short of the land of Canaan
[1:06:05] and thirds of the way
[1:06:06] say we can't go far any further
[1:06:09] he said but when they're born and
[1:06:11] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[1:06:13] God
[1:06:14] then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:06:16] church
[1:06:17] some Apostles some prophets some
[1:06:20] teachers some pastors some evangelists
[1:06:23] you see it's the labor pains that
[1:06:25] produce those Ministries
[1:06:28] it's the labor pains that identify those
[1:06:30] gifts
[1:06:32] are you with me now when the church goes
[1:06:34] through a labor pain when the church
[1:06:37] goes through a great trial that's what
[1:06:38] identifies who the pastors are who the
[1:06:41] evangelists are who the uh who the song
[1:06:44] leaders are who that's what happens when
[1:06:46] you're going through those pains you
[1:06:48] begin to see gifts raise up
[1:06:51] why because that's God uses them for
[1:06:54] deliverance
[1:06:55] oh my so the inspiration comes during
[1:06:58] that time he said when they're born
[1:07:01] positionally born into the kingdom of
[1:07:02] God God has said in the church some
[1:07:04] Apostles some Prophet some teachers some
[1:07:06] Pastor some evangelists
[1:07:08] he said then he's given to their
[1:07:09] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[1:07:12] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[1:07:13] healing all kinds of Miracles
[1:07:19] but
[1:07:20] now the thing is you don't go into the
[1:07:22] land
[1:07:23] and say well
[1:07:26] let's see before I go in I want to I
[1:07:29] want to find out what I am
[1:07:31] I'm going to be a prophet
[1:07:34] and then you go into the land no that's
[1:07:35] no no it's the land itself
[1:07:38] that places you
[1:07:40] right it's your birth path your name
[1:07:43] your identification and the land itself
[1:07:46] that places you so you'll find that God
[1:07:49] wouldn't put a man with a gift for the
[1:07:52] for the seed to be able to work on boats
[1:07:55] God didn't put that tribe of men he
[1:07:58] didn't put them over in the middle of
[1:08:00] the country but he put them over by the
[1:08:02] ocean
[1:08:03] because they had a gift to do that
[1:08:06] right he put certain people in Hardy
[1:08:08] Arkansas
[1:08:10] right it takes a very special breed of
[1:08:12] person
[1:08:14] I hope you're with me now he doesn't put
[1:08:16] just everybody everywhere but he puts
[1:08:19] people specifically for a certain job a
[1:08:22] certain Church a certain place and he's
[1:08:24] placed you today and but he don't put
[1:08:27] you somewhere where you can't do the job
[1:08:29] he puts you somewhere where you can work
[1:08:31] where you can be apart I'm so glad for
[1:08:33] that today yeah
[1:08:35] but but the thing to do is not to go in
[1:08:37] and try to plan and so many times we
[1:08:39] overthink these things we try to think
[1:08:41] well you know if I go for a while and
[1:08:43] then they'll make me a trustee or
[1:08:44] they'll make me a deacon or or one day
[1:08:46] I'll get to be a preacher that's not
[1:08:48] what we plan for at all we get in the
[1:08:50] land
[1:08:51] and we put our shoulder to the wheel and
[1:08:53] God identifies the gift
[1:08:56] right the thing to do is get in the land
[1:08:59] you want to be a preacher pray more
[1:09:02] you want to be a song leader you want to
[1:09:04] be a you want to be a Sunday school
[1:09:06] teacher you want to be a part of the
[1:09:08] church you want to be a trustee pray
[1:09:10] more get in the spirit of God become a
[1:09:12] part be a help to the church
[1:09:15] and it'll identify the holy spirit will
[1:09:18] move you what we need is to get into the
[1:09:21] land so the Holy Spirit can identify
[1:09:23] where you belong
[1:09:26] right because if I just start handing
[1:09:28] out things I could identify somebody
[1:09:29] that maybe looked like they could do
[1:09:32] something
[1:09:33] but that don't mean they can
[1:09:35] only God can bring that inspiration as
[1:09:38] they're in the land of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:41] so again in Egypt Israel was a slave
[1:09:45] are you still with me this morning
[1:09:47] but in Canaan they were conquerors
[1:09:50] oh my
[1:09:51] where are we at today what is Our Land
[1:09:54] Ephesians parallels this and Ephesians 1
[1:09:58] 1 and brother Branham goes into this in
[1:09:59] adoption
[1:10:00] he addresses this in Ephesians 1 1 to
[1:10:03] the Saints
[1:10:04] which are at Ephesus and to the faithful
[1:10:06] in Christ Jesus
[1:10:09] brother Brown said watch how he
[1:10:10] addresses this this is not to the
[1:10:12] unbelievers this is to the church
[1:10:15] it's called to the called out ones the
[1:10:17] Sanctified and called ones that are in
[1:10:19] Christ Jesus
[1:10:21] he said now if you want to know how we
[1:10:23] get in Christ Jesus you turn to First
[1:10:24] Corinthians 12 it says by one Spirit
[1:10:26] we're all baptized into one body
[1:10:28] baptized by what the Holy Ghost not by
[1:10:31] water baptism he said you Church of
[1:10:33] Christ people
[1:10:34] but by one Capital
[1:10:36] s-p-i-r-i-t by one Spirit not by one
[1:10:40] handshake by one letter not by one
[1:10:43] sprinkle but by one Spirit we are all
[1:10:45] baptized into one body our possession
[1:10:49] the land that God give us to live in the
[1:10:52] Holy Ghost he said just as he give
[1:10:55] Canaan to the Jews he's give us the Holy
[1:10:58] Spirit by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:11:01] into one body he said now he's talking
[1:11:03] to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the
[1:11:06] spiritual Israel who has possessed the
[1:11:08] land he said oh aren't you glad you come
[1:11:10] out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad
[1:11:12] you're out of the Wilderness and
[1:11:14] remember he said they had to eat Manna
[1:11:16] Angel's food out of Heaven until they
[1:11:18] crossed over into the land and when they
[1:11:20] had crossed over into the land the
[1:11:22] manatees to fall he said they were fully
[1:11:24] mature then and they eat the old corn of
[1:11:27] the land he said now not that you're not
[1:11:29] babies anymore he said now that you're
[1:11:30] not babies anymore now that you're not
[1:11:32] Desiring the sincere milk of the Gospel
[1:11:34] you don't have to be babied and patted
[1:11:36] and persuaded to come to church
[1:11:39] he said now that you're fully mature
[1:11:41] Christians you're ready to eat strong
[1:11:43] Meats now you're ready to come into
[1:11:45] something
[1:11:47] yeah right I've had people tell me why
[1:11:49] do you read so many quotes well because
[1:11:51] we're in the land yeah
[1:11:53] This Is Our Land
[1:11:56] this is what the Holy Ghost anoints in
[1:11:58] This Hour this is the word of the day
[1:12:02] what else are we supposed to be anointed
[1:12:04] too
[1:12:06] hey man and so this is the word this is
[1:12:10] Angel's food we we've come out now and
[1:12:12] we've had Manna and and all of that but
[1:12:14] we're eating we're eating mature food
[1:12:16] now we've got something that'll make
[1:12:19] mature Christians he said you're ready
[1:12:21] to understand something that's deep and
[1:12:24] Rich
[1:12:25] he said oh we'll get into it directly
[1:12:26] and oh it's been hidden since the
[1:12:28] foundation of the world he said now that
[1:12:30] you've come into this I'm addressing
[1:12:32] this to you not to those who have just
[1:12:34] left Egypt not to those who are still in
[1:12:36] the journey but to those who are in the
[1:12:38] promised land that has received the
[1:12:40] promise how many has received the
[1:12:41] promise today you're in the promised
[1:12:43] land that means you have the baptism of
[1:12:45] the Holy Ghost

[1:12:48] be seeking it yeah you need to you need
[1:12:51] to be getting in the land you need to be

[1:13:05] promise for the Holy Ghost he said oh
[1:13:07] aren't you glad you're in the land
[1:13:09] he said over here now eating the old
[1:13:11] corn eating the strong things of God got
[1:13:14] a clear understanding your spiritual
[1:13:17] mind is all unmuddled up
[1:13:20] I don't know if that's proper English
[1:13:22] but I understand it
[1:13:25] it's all unmuddled up

[1:14:38] been told different
[1:14:40] my children are already in this land
[1:14:42] my body changes already in this land
[1:14:46] huh
[1:14:47] have come into the land
[1:14:49] where the promises lay
[1:14:52] now watch
[1:14:54] he says
[1:14:56] he said your spiritual mind's all
[1:14:58] unmuddled up you know exactly who he is
[1:15:01] how many know who he is today
[1:15:03] you know exactly what he is
[1:15:06] you know exactly where you're going
[1:15:09] oh this this ought to excite us today oh
[1:15:12] this is us this morning you know exactly
[1:15:14] all about it you know in whom you have
[1:15:16] believed and persuaded he's able to keep
[1:15:18] that which you've committed to him
[1:15:19] against that day he said oh that's the
[1:15:21] one that's who Paul is talking to now
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] he said now let me have the church to
[1:15:27] repeat that how do we get into Christ by
[1:15:30] joining Church
[1:15:32] by putting our name on a book
[1:15:34] by being baptized by Mercy
[1:15:38] oh we go a little bit farther in our day
[1:15:40] and age couldn't we
[1:15:41] by listening to a tape
[1:15:44] by being a member of Word of Life
[1:15:45] Tabernacle
[1:15:47] huh
[1:15:49] that's not how being baptized is good
[1:15:51] but it's not what puts you in the body
[1:15:55] being a member of world of Life
[1:15:56] Tabernacle is good
[1:15:58] but it's not going to put you in the
[1:16:00] body
[1:16:02] God listening to a tape is good
[1:16:05] but it's not going to put you in a body
[1:16:07] listening to me preach is good I hope so
[1:16:12] but it's not going to put you in the
[1:16:14] body
[1:16:15] how do you get in the body by paying
[1:16:17] tithes
[1:16:18] no
[1:16:20] by working in the church by being a
[1:16:22] deacon or trustee how do we get into
[1:16:24] Christ by one Holy Spirit we're all
[1:16:27] baptized into one promise the body and
[1:16:30] our partakers of all that belongs in the
[1:16:32] land to get into Canaan you got to go
[1:16:34] across Jordan you got to die like we all
[1:16:36] had to die you got to go through the
[1:16:38] same watery grave you got to walk across
[1:16:40] under a supernatural leadership of
[1:16:42] Joshua the Holy Ghost
[1:16:44] it's the only way into the land
[1:16:49] right and it's why people can't manifest
[1:16:50] the promises
[1:16:52] of canaanisms because they've never
[1:16:54] went in with Joshua
[1:16:56] they're just observers in the land
[1:16:59] right just one around but they've never
[1:17:00] went in
[1:17:01] they've never they've never went in
[1:17:03] they've never been baptized in Jordan
[1:17:05] they've never walked through spiritual
[1:17:07] death death to the old nature and come
[1:17:10] out alive on the other side
[1:17:12] alive in Christ
[1:17:14] now watch he said Mom when I get in this
[1:17:16] land
[1:17:17] I watch I I wish I had the voice to
[1:17:20] preach today
[1:17:21] so when I get in this land it's mine
[1:17:23] yeah
[1:17:27] it's not mine Plus
[1:17:29] brother Ben's
[1:17:33] it's not mine plus my wife or my husband
[1:17:35] or my kids
[1:17:37] it's mine
[1:17:38] it belongs to me
[1:17:40] that means if my wife
[1:17:42] don't go I'm still going to go yeah
[1:17:46] that's harsh but it's the truth
[1:17:49] if my pastor don't go I'm still going to
[1:17:51] go
[1:17:53] huh I'm gonna get my new body
[1:17:56] if my family don't go I'm still gonna go
[1:17:59] it's not it's not determined on whether
[1:18:01] they do it or not whether they still
[1:18:03] believe the message
[1:18:04] listen to me so many people are only in
[1:18:06] the message because their family is as a
[1:18:08] family religion yeah that's a family
[1:18:10] tradition yeah that's not why I believe
[1:18:13] the message
[1:18:14] I believe the message in spite of my
[1:18:16] family
[1:18:19] I love my mother being here in church
[1:18:21] with me and my brother and my sister but
[1:18:23] I tell you what I believe the message
[1:18:24] inspired in my family because I know
[1:18:27] that family will fail but God never
[1:18:29] fails
[1:18:30] this is the land
[1:18:32] this is the land this is the place that
[1:18:34] God has given us this is the word of the
[1:18:36] hour I believe it in spite of in spite
[1:18:39] of every everything that's happened all
[1:18:41] the trials and tribulation we got to
[1:18:43] believe it anyway
[1:18:44] why it's the word of God you believe it
[1:18:46] because it's true
[1:18:48] I'm because somebody else does it not
[1:18:50] because well so and so goes to church
[1:18:52] there I guess I should no you have to
[1:18:53] believe it because it's true
[1:18:56] I'm in the land when I get in this land
[1:18:58] it's mine I'm a home now
[1:19:01] I think that's why some people have such
[1:19:02] a hard time worshiping God yeah yeah
[1:19:04] they're not home in the land
[1:19:07] you're getting the Holy Ghost and people
[1:19:09] begin to begin to look around say well
[1:19:10] that's not really for me
[1:19:12] I begin to pull back why because they're
[1:19:14] just not home there yeah and probably
[1:19:17] why that's happening is because they
[1:19:18] don't do that at home
[1:19:20] but if you get on under the influence of
[1:19:22] the holy spirit in your home you're
[1:19:24] going to be at home when the influence
[1:19:26] of the Holy Spirit comes in church
[1:19:29] you're not going to be afraid of the
[1:19:31] Holy Ghost
[1:19:32] because you've been there you know what
[1:19:34] that's like to be prayed through you
[1:19:36] know what it's like listen church I
[1:19:37] think the Hours come we need to get into
[1:19:39] it we don't need to shirk back from the
[1:19:41] Holy Ghost today it's a trick of the
[1:19:43] enemy this is the hour to pray through
[1:19:45] this is the hour to get into the Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost this is the hour to get sincere
[1:19:48] about these things not not the hour to
[1:19:50] step back but the hour to go on into the
[1:19:53] fullness of it because now we can there
[1:19:56] was a time they couldn't now we can
[1:19:59] now look he said I'm subject I'm in
[1:20:02] Canaan I'm subject to anything
[1:20:04] God wants to use me for right say
[1:20:07] anything
[1:20:09] you know what that means you're a
[1:20:10] totally surrendered vessel
[1:20:12] in the land you're not your own you

[1:20:46] of it feel pretty good but it merged
[1:20:49] Thunder

[1:20:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost not the

[1:21:45] holy ghost that fell on the day of
[1:21:46] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here
[1:21:48] tonight
[1:21:50] the same holy ghost that made Mary shout
[1:21:52] and speak with tongues and to have a
[1:21:54] wonderful time and rejoice and the
[1:21:56] things that she did is the same Holy
[1:21:59] Ghost here tonight yeah the same Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost to let Paul on that Old Ship where
[1:22:05] it looked like it was waterlogged and
[1:22:06] was gone 14 days a night no moon or
[1:22:09] Stars he looked out there and every wave
[1:22:10] had a devil on it glancing gleaming his
[1:22:13] teeth and said I'll sink you oh boy I
[1:22:15] got you now and while Paul went down to
[1:22:17] have a little prayer that stood an angel
[1:22:18] and said don't you fear Paul this old
[1:22:20] ship's going to be wrecked up on a
[1:22:22] certain Island go ahead and eat your
[1:22:23] supper it's all right now he said here
[1:22:25] he come with them chains on his little
[1:22:27] old arms dragging them on his feet and
[1:22:28] said be of a good courage man for the
[1:22:30] god the angel of God who's servant I am
[1:22:32] stood by me and said Paul don't you fear
[1:22:35] he said that same Holy Ghost is here
[1:22:37] tonight the same spirit of God
[1:22:39] ministering to us the same someone say
[1:22:43] the same
[1:22:44] spiritual blessings
[1:22:47] amen that's the land yeah
[1:22:50] yeah
[1:22:51] I said my brother Ben you
[1:22:53] why why don't we receive more of it
[1:22:56] well we just need to walk into it
[1:22:59] yeah the blessings are in the land yes
[1:23:02] stay in the land
[1:23:04] now I know
[1:23:06] some of you can you bear with me for
[1:23:07] just a few more minutes I know my voice
[1:23:09] this week I I've only got so much breath
[1:23:12] I've sat in a chair for two weeks
[1:23:15] because I can't breathe laying down and
[1:23:17] and uh but just that time of year and
[1:23:19] just these things going on I know some
[1:23:21] of y'all suffered the same way but but
[1:23:23] we believe God's A Healer you believe
[1:23:24] that today
[1:23:27] you might say brother Ben it's the Holy
[1:23:29] Ghost
[1:23:30] is where all the promises lay why did
[1:23:33] the Pentecostals not finish the job
[1:23:35] and think about well they had the Holy
[1:23:37] Ghost well it's true they tasted of the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost
[1:23:41] but the Pentecostal age was the age that
[1:23:43] Drew back yeah how many know that yeah
[1:23:45] that's Hebrews 6 4. he says it is
[1:23:49] impossible for those who are once
[1:23:50] enlightened remember it was the
[1:23:51] Pentecostal Church where he was outside
[1:23:53] the church
[1:23:54] knocking he said those who are once
[1:23:57] enlightened have tasted of the Heavenly
[1:23:58] gift and were made partakers of the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost they were made for takers and
[1:24:02] tasted the good word of God and the
[1:24:04] powers of the world to come and if they
[1:24:06] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[1:24:07] repentance
[1:24:09] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[1:24:10] Son of God afresh and put him to an open
[1:24:13] shame
[1:24:14] Joshua said Moses took one out of every
[1:24:16] tribe every denomination he sent us over
[1:24:18] to spy out the land when we got there at
[1:24:21] the river and looked across and seen
[1:24:22] that amalekites the amorites and the
[1:24:24] parasites and what more and said they
[1:24:25] were giants said the people screamed out
[1:24:28] for fear well we can't do that if we
[1:24:31] ever respond to our meeting like that
[1:24:32] our organization will turn us out we
[1:24:34] just can't do it we can't have things
[1:24:35] like that it's too shady see we we can't
[1:24:38] why it's impossible and when they come
[1:24:40] back yet they had the evidence brought
[1:24:42] back grapes from that land
[1:24:44] and the trouble of it is how can a man
[1:24:47] listen or church or denomination that's
[1:24:51] ever tasted of the evidence that he is
[1:24:53] alive and then deny him when he is
[1:24:55] resurrected Among Us how can you do it
[1:24:58] Pentecost you spoke with tongues and
[1:25:00] interpreted tongues as you claim he said
[1:25:02] and then how could you turn the very
[1:25:04] promised word down for this age he said
[1:25:06] take part of it you say it's a good land
[1:25:08] we had no idea it was a good land it's
[1:25:10] proven to be a good land but that one
[1:25:13] bunch of grapes wasn't all of it
[1:25:15] all Palestine was full of it so the
[1:25:18] Pentecostals were the ones who went and
[1:25:20] got by the day that one bunch of grapes
[1:25:22] and they come back slobbering on them
[1:25:25] right they come back and said oh they're
[1:25:26] good grapes
[1:25:28] bless God it's an Evidence
[1:25:31] right it's evidence the holy ghost man
[1:25:33] that we we believe in it we believe the
[1:25:36] Holy Ghost they partook of it they
[1:25:38] grabbed the evidence of it but they
[1:25:40] didn't get the person of it they didn't
[1:25:41] get the fullness of it they didn't go on
[1:25:44] in they stopped two-thirds of the way
[1:25:46] are you with me now
[1:25:48] many in this message have done the same
[1:25:50] thing
[1:25:51] if we're not careful we walk two-thirds
[1:25:53] of the way and say God sent a prophet
[1:25:56] and we see God sent a prophet and we
[1:25:58] take it back as an Evidence
[1:26:00] we say but uh we say look there's 1100
[1:26:03] tapes and we take that back as an
[1:26:04] Evidence look God moved through a
[1:26:06] Ministry we see a son of man Ministry we
[1:26:08] take that back as an Evidence God even
[1:26:10] opened the seals we take him back as an
[1:26:11] Evidence but there's more to it than
[1:26:13] that there's a land you've got to walk
[1:26:15] into
[1:26:18] huh
[1:26:20] you can't just go to the borderline and
[1:26:21] say there's an Evidence
[1:26:24] oh it's good but there's more where that
[1:26:26] come from
[1:26:28] how can you bring back the grapes and
[1:26:29] deny the word
[1:26:31] so that bunch of grapes wasn't full
[1:26:32] wasn't all of it all Palestine was full
[1:26:34] of it
[1:26:35] the same land has a body change in it
[1:26:39] oh Church you realize that this morning
[1:26:41] I wish I could preach that
[1:26:44] the same land yeah

[1:28:23] we've got good preaching but I want to
[1:28:25] go all the way in we we hear the word
[1:28:27] but I want to go all the way in if
[1:28:29] there's gifts there I want to take
[1:28:30] advantage of them if there's power there
[1:28:32] I want to take advantage of it if the
[1:28:34] presence of God is there that'll make me
[1:28:36] drunk on the Holy Ghost I want to take

[1:29:08] but that's where we stop bless God we
[1:29:10] got the Holy Ghost the evidence is
[1:29:11] speaking in tongues he said that's all
[1:29:13] right show somebody went over there
[1:29:15] but why do you stand at this borderline
[1:29:18] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:19] have tasted of the power of the world to
[1:29:21] come he said see that they'll fall back
[1:29:23] into the same old wrath the Methodist
[1:29:24] did the Baptist did the Presbyterian did
[1:29:27] and crucified to themselves the Son of
[1:29:29] God afresh and bring him to an open
[1:29:30] shame
[1:29:32] go on in
[1:29:33] you don't have to stand there where

[1:29:37] it
[1:29:40] in and out one day you got it one day
[1:29:42] you don't because somebody told you you
[1:29:44] didn't
[1:29:44] go on in
[1:29:47] go in where you're sure
[1:29:49] go in where you know be on the shadow of
[1:29:51] a doubt it was there when it happened
[1:29:53] and I guess I ought to know yeah
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:57] go into a no-sew religion go in
[1:30:00] something real
[1:30:02] hey man go in see we are not
[1:30:04] that group that goes back
[1:30:07] but Paul speaks in Hebrews 6 9 he said
[1:30:09] but beloved we are persuaded better
[1:30:11] things of you
[1:30:13] things that accompany salvation but we
[1:30:15] thus speak
[1:30:17] amen we're not going back we will not
[1:30:19] fail why because we're in the land
[1:30:22] we've crossed over we've been buried in
[1:30:24] Christ
[1:30:25] the church brother random says the blood
[1:30:27] of Christ by the spirit because the life
[1:30:29] is in the blood that's the baptism of
[1:30:31] the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his
[1:30:33] body that recognizes only his body his
[1:30:36] flesh his word and he patches the Bible
[1:30:39] he said denomination won't never touch
[1:30:41] that it's a revelation she knows it so
[1:30:44] did Eve know it but she failed but this
[1:30:47] one knows it and won't fall do we
[1:30:49] believe the word or don't we
[1:30:51] this one knows it and won't fall she is
[1:30:54] ordained Hallelujah she is ordained to
[1:30:56] not fall right she won't fail
[1:30:59] she is predestinated to it blessed is
[1:31:02] the man who God will not impute sin
[1:31:07] you just won't put it on his account
[1:31:17] I've often wondered why God led us have
[1:31:19] to fight while we preach
[1:31:22] but you know you realize it's just as
[1:31:25] much a fight to preach as this a fight
[1:31:26] to listen
[1:31:31] he said blessed is the man who God will
[1:31:32] not impute sin notice redeeming back
[1:31:34] with him going home back to eternal life
[1:31:37] in a human body
[1:31:39] oh God how many want to go all the way
