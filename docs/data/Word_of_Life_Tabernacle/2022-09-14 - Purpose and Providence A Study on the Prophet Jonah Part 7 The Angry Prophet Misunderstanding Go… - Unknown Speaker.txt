playing that softly maybe you'd have a special unspoken request you'd like to make known but we've uplifted and i know god sees all of these needs tonight he knows what's on your heart he's able to meet that need let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord we come to your altar tonight and we're so grateful that it's not just a family tradition but lord is something that you've given us placed in our heart a desire to be in your house oh god we're so thankful lord that we can come with those of like precious faith and bring all of our burdens and all of our cares and all of our struggles all of our troubles lord bring them together into the same place and know that the same god that was here and walk the earth lord that same god is here today in a body of believers and lord you're still meeting these needs you're still healing the sick you're still raising the dead lord from dead trespasses and sins we're so grateful for that today lord i pray you meet every need god you know what they are lord as the preaching of your word goes forth may it be a reality to us lord may it not be just something that's read from a book but oh god make it real in our lives tonight so we can follow it so we can live it we pray and we ask in the precious name of jesus amen amen god bless you tonight jonah chapter four verse one we'll just read the one verse and then we'll read the rest as we continue this evening i'm going to finish the lord willing our teaching on jonah tonight and i trust it's been a blessing to you i know it has been to me and but there's several things that uh we want to say tonight and kind of wrap it up and then there's some other things i've got on my heart for sunday and then going into next week i want to thank you for allowing us to go to oklahoma as we usually do every year thank you for letting me go and and for letting brother joel go as well and we take a lot of our uh sound people with us and of course you might have noticed that on sunday but it actually wasn't the people here's fault that we had something that actually went out in the wiring and the electrical so it was brother danny's fault from 22 years ago so but uh no it was uh just something that happened so it seems like something always happens when you're gone but but i'm so glad that that you allowed us to do that and i get feel guilty every time i don't know if guilty is the right word when we're not here i don't feel right unless i'm here with you and i believe the lord's put that in my heart and i trust that you feel the same way that you want to be with the people of god is that your desire tonight that's why you're here you don't have any other ulterior motive you just want to be fellowship with the people of god around the word of god and to hear the word and and so that's what i'm here for as well and i trust it'll be a blessing to you uh friday evening brother matt morris is having a youth service if you a young person or or not or feel like a young person you want to go to that i'd sure appreciate it if you would a brother matt really supported our meetings and they've got meetings coming up as well the next month this is just a youth service brother andrew glover josh martin will be there and i don't know which one is preaching friday night but if you get a chance to go i'd i sure appreciate both them young men are good preachers and both of them preach for us and our meetings so it'd be good if you could go uh brother marty mccomas have meetings this weekend as well not sure about the situation there the brother that's going to be there but he's doing that as well and they asked me to announce that we have a kids day this saturday here at the church for the sunday school kids and they're taking care of that i haven't dealt with that at all so i assume that's still happening but we're thankful for those that are working on that and have worked on that it's for our our kids our sunday school children so you remember that make it a priority to be in and have your kids and stuff like that in church it matters and it shows them what where your priorities are and and then sunday we'll speak to you sunday morning the lord willing and brother george moore will be with us again in the evening service he'll be traveling through so we'll have him again you love the lord tonight we're all caught up now jonah chapter 4 and verse 1 it said but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated he was very angry you know tempering itself isn't the problem it's what he was displeased at in itself temper is a is an emotion given to us from god uh it said that it was actually henry ward beecher the great abolitionist said that a man that does not know how to be angry does not know how to be good a man that does not know how to be shaken to his heart's core with indignation over things evil is either a fungus or a wicked man you've got to have some amount of of temper and jesus showed us that even when he used the whip and we've talked about that before and i've told you i feel like i couldn't do that because i would be getting the flesh at some point and i would overdo that i i would just take that opportunity to punish my enemies and and maybe whip a little bit too hard or do something like that and i'm sure most of us are in that same boat tonight but jesus could do that without sin and so that was the difference in him and any other mortal but and so someone else has said anyone can become angry that's easy but to be angry with the right person to the right degree at the right time and in the right way that's not easy i tell you who you should be angry at most of the time as yourself the bible tells us be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath and and and what that is paul is actually quoting the old testament that's psalms 4 4 he's quoting it from the greek translation of the scripture where it says stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still and what that means that stand in all means to tremble so you can be so mad that you're shaking you say a christian could get that mad yes you could be so angry that you were trembling with anger but don't let it consume you be careful or anger will destroy you and so paul goes on to say in ephesians 4 27 neither give place to the devil so that's why what he's saying he said don't don't go to bed angry don't don't let it consume you at night don't don't let it don't wake up with it on your in your thoughts in the morning because all it'll do is cause you trouble yeah amen and he said don't give place to the devil don't give room for the devil let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you brother branham put it this way and i'm just building up then to our thought here tonight because as jonah was angry brandon said don't get in fusses he said don't like to get in fuss he said if you like to see somebody raise up in church and say you know what i'll tell you so and so did so and so you say now brother shame on you if you say oh is that so he said listen to that scandal watch out the holy spirit is not a cesspool he said no the heart is occupied by the holy spirit is full of holiness purity thinketh no evil doeth no evil is that us tonight it ought to be right he said thinketh no evil doeth no evil believeth all things endureth long-suffering don't fuss he said when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them right your mother said i ain't having you up there that old church anymore well he said all you think about now you're letting your hair grow out you look like someone grandma don't fuss with her say okay mother it's all right i love you just the same i'll be praying for you as long as i live that's what a prophet said he said now don't fuss temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back then the holy spirit takes his flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have loved one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit is love amen isn't that what we want in our hearts and our lives and yet as i said anger at the wrong thing or at the right things that the things that are wrong don't that kind of anger is something that's necessary you got to get angry enough that you won't do it anymore and you don't want to see it you won't stand for it in your family you've got to get i i've seen situations where a person was so complacent that nothing upset them and it actually caused their families to be destroyed because they would not ever deal with sin and it's got to be dealt with somebody's got to get mad enough to deal with it right now why he why was jonah angry we find that he had finally obeyed god and went to nineveh in jonah three and one the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time aren't you glad god's a god of second chances so he's been through the he's been in the belly of the fish he's been all through there and and he finally reaches a place where the word of the lord came to him again and it said arise going into nineveh that great city preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee and i want to stop there just for a moment because it's not so much what you do that is the problem it's not so much the mistake that you make it's not so much the fall that you have because everybody makes mistakes but it's what you do with it it's how you react to it are you willing to get back up and get back into the harness and do what god tells you to do and so now he said go and preach the preaching that i bid thee so jonah arose and went into nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey that means it was took three days to get through the city and jonah began to enter into the city of dave's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown now notice jonah doesn't even give him a space to repent god didn't tell him to he just said preach right and he goes out and preaches and says there's judgment coming on this nation what did the prophet of god do in this hour there's judgment coming on this nation but yet we know in this nation cannot repent will not repent right it's gone past repenting yet the prophets still come out and preach amen he preached the same as as jonah did in nineveh the city should be overthrown as if it was going to happen that moment you realize people today will make fun and say well you know a prophet said that about uh about about los angeles and how it would fall in the sea and if you've listened to the tape of and listen to brother branham speak on uh on that uh sermon when he preached in los angeles choosing of a bride and he's and he says oh city of the angels and you feel like it's going to happen right then he tells the people to flee for their lives and yet all these years later we look back on and say well los angeles hasn't went in the ocean but it's going some day because a prophet cried out the words of the lord and here we find jonah cried out the word of the lord he said in 40 days nineveh will be overthrown and it goes into this great city now history agrees with the dimensions that it was three days journey across it took you three days to walk from one actually around the circumference of the city and those great big cities like that they're spread out especially in ancient times you experienced that some in cairo or city i've been in manila in the philippines those cities are spread out because of the way they build houses and they're spread out you can walk for seems like days and days to get through them and so it's a great city in jonah 3 and 5 it says so the people of nineveh believed god oh if the people of nineveh who knew nothing about god would hear the voice of a prophet and believe god what would it do for us if we could hear the message of the hour what would it do for us when we hear the word of god preach if we could just believe god and do what god says if we could just believe god it's not some great mystery somewhere he said well my family's struggling my i've got trouble in my family i've got trouble at home i got trouble in the church i got trouble at my work but remember if you just believe god god will take care of it if you just listen to the word of god and believe god but you've got to believe god or there's nothing the word can do for you the word cannot take effect in an unbelieving heart it's got to be given that that ability to that belief that that faith that allow it to grow that's the atmosphere that makes it grow believe god you say well i'm not where i think i should be i feel like i'm back sitting i feel like i've gone back how many have ever felt that way i'm not where i should be believe god the same way you did when you were saved believe god you say well i don't have the same people around me i'm not where i was but believe god anyway it's the word that saved you in the first place it'll be the word that keeps you believe god believe god and that atmosphere will begin to build around your life but then i wish we'd have the kind of services where i could believe god we can have those kind of services i believe we have those kind of services we can have more and more of those kind of services if you'll believe god if you'll just take god at his word when the word is being preached how many want to do that tonight amen the word is quick and powerful alive and powerful sharper than a two-edged sword the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed the fast and put on sackoff from the greatest of them even to the least of them for word came into the king of nineveh and that's a very biblically accurate statement i want you to notice the accuracy of the bible says the king of nineveh notice he doesn't call him the king of assyria because the king of syria assyria had actually died and there was a revolt by one of his sons whose two sons were fighting for the kingdom one of his sons controlled 27 cities you can find this in history during that time and so the official master of assyria was uh i can't pronounce his name but his name is with pal we'll just call him powell old pal was king of nineveh he literally was king of nineveh during that time aren't you glad god gave us an accurate word so he was not the king of assyria he was the king of nineveh because of that situation the political situation that was there and so verse 7 he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his noble saying let neither man nor beasts heard nor flock tastes anything let them not feed nor drink water but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth cry mightily unto god yea let them turn everyone from his evil way from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not now this man who knew nothing about god had a better idea of who god was than the prophet jonah did right it seems like that doesn't it here he knew nothing about god but he said i may not be the seed of god i may not be a i may not have been taught about god i may not know this god but i know he if he's got god he and that has the ability to destroy a nation he also has the ability to forgive a nation and to hold back that destruction oh church sometimes we get too too deep into well i i wonder if i'm a seed of god i wonder from that you just believe god's word and if you have the capacity to believe it there must be a seed somewhere if you've got the ability if you've got a desire to come to church brother branham told one young man he said i feel like i sinned away in my day of grace he said do you like gospel music he said yes i do he said that that's a sign that you haven't sent away your day of grace just hold on to what you can this king is grabbing hold of every every thought that he could have about the mercies of god well that's what we ought to do today rather than become a cynic say well it doesn't matter if i go to church or not it doesn't matter if i worship or not doesn't matter if i come to an altar or not don't be a cynic listen when when the spirit of god moves you to do something just do it don't become cynical about it who can tell that god might move through you to help somebody else who can tell that god won't move in your family when you set an example of doing the right thing to help some other family amen who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not but brown said what we need today is some more men down on their knees not some of these dried professions but a real good birth of the holy spirit and you will go type that in dry eyed confession or dried profession or dried repentance and look what brother branham says about that from 47 to 65 but random constantly hits that why because it's just a it's a tradition a family tradition but it has no heart in it verse 10 god saw their works notice that they turned from their evil way wasn't just that they cried but they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them and he did it not you say god you can't do that now look the first part of that sentence god god and can't don't go in the same sins right whenever you whenever you address him as god you don't get to say god you can't do that to me god you can't repent god you can't you can't let this nation live god you can't do that god you can't save so and so god you can't deal with so and so god you can't you can't do that you can't heal you can't whatever you don't get to god tell god what he can't do aren't you glad for that tonight if he's god he can do it we don't get to explain to god why he can't do things he turned from his evil that he thought he would do to them and he did it not of course being god he already knew that they would repent and we'll show you something wonderful about that here in just a moment now this is the same nineveh that had invaded israel previously if you go back when we first began preaching about this and how that they invaded it in israel and how jonah had prophesied and helped the king at that time jeroboam had helped him take back some of the land that the king of assyria had taken it's the same nation the same capital city of the same nation these were heathens worshipping false gods but you don't get to tell god what he's going to do god might bring somebody in off the street out of a denominational church bring them in and heal their body heal them of cancer use us to bless them they may never receive the message we don't get to tell god what to do with the change in his pocket he gets to use that how he wants to he might heal a dime or a penny and leave a silver dollar sick because he's trying to work something in his life but healing is already ours you understand we don't go by symptoms anyway but i mean god gets to do what he wants to do now you can tell a lot about people's spiritual condition by their response to people repenting and being forgiven you see the problem with jonah is that he was he was angry with god because people repented and god accepted it he was angry at god because god forgave people he didn't want to forgive brother madam said you know when i see personal workers going with people he said i want to say this about you people here he said that proves what you're made of i've went to places even in people who are supposed to be spirit-filled people and see altar calls made he said why you couldn't get people to go in with anybody to pray with them oh church it matters if we show concern it matters how we treat those who come to repentance it matters how we treat those who come to the house of god for the purpose of repentance there's some that don't come for the purpose of repentance there's some that come for the other reasons but if god would send somebody here i don't care what they've been what their past has been we ought to be able to say lord how would you want to use me help me lord to be used by you to help this person they may have had struggles in their life they may have had troubles but see it's how you view that tells a lot not about them but about you if you're not willing to be used as an instrument if i'm not willing to be used as an instrument to help somebody if we're not careful people become numbers i heard chuck swindoll the other day he said he was at a certain church and and he was talking to the janitor because they were waiting to talk to the pastor he said and he spoke to the janitor who was cleaning up after the sunday morning service and and he said it looks like y'all are doing well around here is a big church in a city he said yeah he said we processed 2 500 units this morning 2500 units that's cynical isn't it those are people but we lose sight of that brother branham lost sight of that at some point go and listen to standing in the gap but the random say he lost the feeling for the people because we get to stand on the side it's like we get to stand you know it's one thing to go to mcdonald's and get a happy meal or get a burger it's another thing to have to serve it makes you feel completely different about mcdonald's it's true i've worked at mcdonald's i've worked at burger maybe i shouldn't admit that i worked at burger king for a while so i started getting this at burger king and i i've worked there i know what that's like it's completely different from the inside and sometimes and i'm speaking out to us elders who work in ministry we work as deacons we workers we've been in the church a long time maybe you're a song leader or or working the music and you get cynical if you're not careful it becomes units it becomes numbers it becomes we build a barrier between us and the people now those are god's people god sent them here for some purpose for some reason we don't have a right cult to call them a unit it's god's people oh my i don't know where that come from but that was free tonight now look it said he said see when you wouldn't go into people to go in with anybody to pray with them he said see it that shows it's ichabod you realize how serious that is just not god keep our hearts warm we read last wednesday night he said he said knowing what we're doing with the knowledge and understanding we want teaching so we can be stable in the word but we want to be warm enough in our hearts so we can feel the presence of god we can be warm enough to know that he's moving warm enough to know that when someone comes seeking god that we want to get right there with them help them out help them out he said well altar calls made he said well you couldn't get people to go into anybody it shows it's ichabod the spirit of the lord has departed but when you see that zeal and fire and longing and long for human souls you see the people of nina were in nineveh were in revival but the prophet wasn't and god had used him to bring revival and yet he was out of revival i said god help me he would become so cynical about the job he had to do that it actually he actually treated the people as numbers and just somebody that god was going to destroy cannon fodder as brother branham put it and he said god told him not to call him rickies and richards because he said those are my children they may not be bribed but they're my children he said and there's some bright out there or some of god's children just don't know any better now brother branham talked about how that he talked about a minister that said why don't we have these burdens don't have burdens for lost souls he said i believe that it's the lacking of the revival he said well brother ben that gives me a built-in excuse no revival anywhere i can just i think that's why some people don't like revival because it gives them an excuse for just living any way they want to and you don't have to be have a burden for souls but brother branham says this he said i believe he said that we should still try to pray to god to give us passions for lost souls until jesus comes amen isn't that what you want in your heart a passion for lost souls until jesus comes why don't christians do that today it's because we live in laodicea people are affected by that and i may get into it sunday i don't know yet i've been studying and pondering on it but you realize that all the plagues that struck egypt most of them were only on the egyptians but the last plague was death and the last effect didn't care if you were an egyptian or an israelite the only thing that would keep that plague of death off of you was blood on the door that was the only thing was the application of the token and see that that spiritual death you don't care whether you say you're a message believer it doesn't care whether you go to word of life tabernacle it's in the land it's everywhere it's creeping into every house into every church it's everywhere out there but thank god we have a message of life spiritual death is everywhere but we have the blood on display but that's why the church is that way it's why there's no burden for souls it's just a number because of laodicea is everywhere spiritual death he said oh sure they say you know what we used to that little church we used to use in the back part this is the big one now he said i tell you no burden for souls but they got to see all these things are taken care of the lady said and all these other things all has to be taken care of but no burden for lost souls he said oh man what this church has gotten into brother branham talked about how that when simon struck me as a young man i've always remembered it he talked about how simon the pharisee invited jesus to come he said but he got so busy with church matters that he forgot to invite he forgot to invite jesus and not just invite him but welcome him and wash his feet when he came and anoint him with oil he got so busy with church matters we it's so easy for us to do the same way and we get so busy with church matters we get so busy with the little fusses and things that we go through that we forget to welcome jesus when he comes right brother said you asked him you invited him then worship him when he comes oh my do you believe he's here tonight in the word if he's hearing his word he's hearing his spirit we ought to worship him with all that we have but they were not burdened for souls he said oh man what this church has gotten into they were not burdened for souls but they were burdened with wealth that's right they had the wrong burden well they had a burden just the wrong one they had a burden for their wealth but not a burden for lost souls how do you know that brother ben because they spend all their time trying to make money and not only the people i'm not trying to criticize you tonight it's not just the people of this age it's the churches right spent all of our time trying to make money instead of actually having a burden to see somebody saved it's the wrong burden he said the scripture said they didn't know that they were wretched miserable and blind they think that they could take money and convert the world or if we could just get a program on we could get a lot of money here i believe we could convert the world if some of the rich people in our church brother branham if we could just get them to dig out he said i believe we could start a society would go around convert the world we could take airplanes and drop literature all over africa things like that if we just had some money brother the world won't be converted by money the world will be converted by the holy ghost he said the powerful preaching of the holy ghost and the cross will be the only thing that will convert the world do we still believe that tonight god's program is not money it's the holy ghost that's what god's program is for the later seeing church age or any other church age jonah had the wrong burden he had a burden to see people destroyed god had a burden to see people live but there was a greater purpose in that we're going to see that in a moment jonah lost his feeling for the people verse one chapter four it displeased jonah exceedingly he was very angry verse two and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country he said therefore i fled before unto tarshish truth is jonah did know something about god and that's why he was so upset he said i knew the thou art a gracious gracious god and merciful so to anger aren't you glad that he is aren't you glad he is to us gentiles but here was this jewish man who was one of god's chosen people this prophet of god but he said i knew you were a merciful god of great kindness repentancy of the evil therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live sometimes sometimes what we know becomes a burden to us because we know how how things are going to end up jonah knew more than the average man but lebron said you think you'd want to know things about people he said you don't because a lot of the people tell you that things are a certain way they're not that way and i'm glad i don't have it you say that makes things a lot easier wouldn't it in counseling and in preaching if you could just see people's hearts and and sometimes the lord will it just like it's plain before you but i'm glad i don't have that assurance of that and don't see visions and things like that because i can just preach and let it go out where it may and i don't necessarily know what you're thinking although some of you are easier to read than others but joel was before his glasses i don't know now but joel's wearing glasses in case anybody wondered tonight that's who that is on the front row but it's a burden because he knew what the ninevites would do he knew they were called the assyrians were called as a nation to be a scourge on israel he knew they would take the and they were so cruel they invented terror state terror they were so cruel they would take the skin of their enemies fillet them take the skin and and cover their their chairs with it they were like the nazis but god was using them they were so cruel that they would they would stick their enemies up on on on a stick on a pike and just leave them there and and line the the way to their banquets with their enemies naked on a stick cruel people godless people and jonah said you're going to give them another chance you don't get to tell god what to do because see what we know isn't everything we'll get to that in just a moment notice jonah was also angry and the reason he felt this way is because he was coming down out of the anointing and brother branham called it the monday morning blues and he talked about elijah how he dealt with that he said it's very strange he said pastor here knows at other ministers he said watch after your mount carmel's you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of god pours down and does something for you look out satan is on the track you watch that we watch it happen in our meetings this is a local church and it's everywhere it's not just us but we can apply the word to us we had a great meeting and immediately satan began to work begin to try to keep people apart i don't think we've had the whole church in one building since the meetings you think about that though satan he starts working in sickness and things like that why does he do that he wants to steal your blessing from you whenever a man has a blessing and the power of god pours down and does something for you look out satan is on the track he said just remember the next day that monday after a good day on sunday it's going to be a hard thing because he he does he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the holy spirit instilled in you the day before so the day before you sat back there and said hey i'm going to make it i'm a child of god you heard the preaching of the word and you were feeding on at the feast of the lord and you got defeating on it and you said i i'm a child of god i'm going to make it boy wasn't that a good service and you're so excited you go home and you get a phone call somebody's sick you hear about somebody that wants some money or somebody that that's dying somebody is sick in your family troubles begin to come up work people give you grief at work and and things happen in the home you have a disagreement with the wife or the husband and you begin it begins to take that confidence out of you why does satan do that because he wants to steal your blessing that's the time when you ought to stand up and say lord i know i'm still a child of god i know i'm still greatly blessed and highly favored i know i'm still the head and not the tale i'm still a believer and not an unbeliever i'm still a child of god i'm still the elect even though the devil is out to get me and now again jonah had a right to be angry about their sin yes but not about their forgiveness from sin be angry and sin not john 4 4 then said the lord does sow well to be angry ask him the question you do well to be angry so john went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow until he might see what would become of the city he literally goes out sits on his little mountain us for no more builds himself a denomination a covering a booth and sits there and criticizes the ninevites having this great revival sure god don't want you to be critical of revival even if it's a shallow revival that won't last because that's the kind this was but god still said jonah you shouldn't be angry just because you know it won't last he said don't get angry god does what he does for a reason if god sends a blessing let's just receive the blessing not sitting criticize it but jonah got critical built himself a little denomination pulled off by himself and just preached at that let them preach to himself about nineveh oh god how how many how many of us in the message have done the same thing pull back from the denominations and everybody pulled out of the world that's good we got to separate ourselves but then you pull off and sit on your heel and criticize oh america america is so bad what have we done what have we done to help well he said well i can't i can't change the nation no you can't but you can change the atmosphere in your home you can change the atmosphere it's your work you know you're a creator you're a little a little messiah a little a little bit of deity on the earth you can change things but the human tendency is to withdraw like jonah did make it make a covering a fig leaf that's what that word booth means a covering a denomination a religion and and god blessed jonah sitting there because he wanted to teach him a lesson and jonah four and six notice the lord god prepared a gourd and it's not that he had a gourd like we would think of get around around halloween or the fall festival you have a gourd like that it's not that it was the gourd plant that would grow and it's got a great big leaf and so the gourd plant grow up and it could grow very quickly in a day it would grow up and cover jonah's little hut and jonah said well i must be right bless god here in my hut and i got me a gourd got everything i have need of right here don't need them ninovites don't sit here and watch god destroy them so he got a shadow over his head and delivered him from his grief so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd his mood changed because now he's in the shade you ever been out in a really hot day and that sun just beating on your head and and that you get under a tree get in the shade and and you begin your mood begins to change and you begin to be happy because you're not sweating like you were and so he sits comfortably i think it's important for us to notice that god could control everything but jonah think about it he controlled the wind and the waves and the fish and the gourd and the worm we're going to read about in the wind but jonah had to surrender yeah everything in nature brother bradley said the heavens work in perfect order but the part that don't works down here the body of christ on the earth everything in nature obeys the word of god except human beings but we have the greatest reason to obey but so god's going to teach joan a lesson so he goes on and says god prepared a worm now watch the words god prepared a gourd one day and god prepared a worm now put that in your job god prepared the boss that likes you and god prepared the one that didn't think about it for a minute god prepared the co-worker that was efficient and got things done and then they left and god prepared the one who was lazy are you with me now god prepared the good day and the bad day and i already had them both set out on the calendar today jonah gets a gourd he's going to be happy tomorrow he gets the worm today may have been your worm day but remember god prepared it well it's hard on us didn't he god had a worm ready to eat the gourd that he prepared in verse 8 it came to pass when the verse 7 said god prepared a war a worm and it smote the gourd that it withered and then things got worse than they ever had been and verse 80 came to pass when the sun did arise god prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live god had prepared again when the sun arose god prepared god prepared a gourd a worm and an east wind brother branham said about that east wind he said one day the lord willing i want to come to the tabernacle and take a series just on jonah he said oh there's so many great you thought i was just doing that with jonah but that's what he said something he wanted to do he said oh there's so many great he said that east wind blowing and all he said oh my he said there's so many things in there it's thrilling them nuggets in there it all types right in fit it even brings jesus christ in it and everything else he said of course every line in the bible brings jesus christ do we believe that tonight so that east wind what is that that's that violent wind that blows from the east it's mentioned more frequently in the bible than other winds the east wind is described as a scorching wind and and it comes from the desert if you look at a map of palestine to the west is the mediterranean sea when the west wind blows off of the ever been in those desert countries the west wind blows off the ocean that's wonderful but when the east wind comes it's got nothing but deserts it's just coming out of the out of the arabian desert and out of all those deserts blowing across and when it does it kills everything it just it's such a dry wind that it actually dries up the plants dries everything up when we were in egypt i didn't have to comb my hair i'm serious because it there was no humidity everything was dry but if you didn't drink water because you didn't feel that hot when you were just out and about but if you didn't drink enough water you die you dry up oh sometimes when an east wind blows god prepared it but you better make sure you've got a source of water you better make sure you drink enough water or you're going to dry up when the time of the east wind see god doesn't think like we do the east wind serves its purpose the greeks called it euroclidon from pronouncing that correctly it's the same wind that drove paul's ship to the island of malta so he could be bitten by a snake so he could bring the gospel to that island on the way to rome and many times god has a purpose now can you bear with me for just a few more minutes i'm almost out of time just give me five more minutes and i only only take it from one or two of you but many times god has a purpose and then a hidden purpose are you with me tonight a purpose and then a hidden purpose so he has a purpose that he shows you maybe you're a deacon or a trustee or something like that he shows you that but he doesn't show you the hidden purpose so that route to becoming what you're going to be in life is you think it's like this but it's not it's like this right and over here is the hidden purpose that he doesn't show you so whenever you look at things brown said that scripture has compound meanings because there's a purpose there's a hidden purpose right and many many times there's other purposes along the way of your life and so now look at paul he only showed him the end result he said you'll stand before caesar but because he knew what his purpose was whatever happened in between wouldn't matter he couldn't die until he stood before caesar oh my if you could just recognize that today god has showed you your purpose and what it is you're to be the bride of jesus christ you're supposed to go in a rapture god showed you your purpose whatever happens in the meantime god will take care of it there's a hidden purpose in there but you're going to the same place the the things oh i hope you hear me tonight the things you went through did not do derail your purpose they were part of it yeah right the troubles that you face the the people that you faced at the job the the marriage problems the struggle at church the struggle everywhere you went that was a part of it oh god you thought that it was it was out of the will of god but it was actually a part of it when we step back and look at the bigger picture god had a hidden purpose for jonah his purpose was for him to go to nineveh but there was a hidden purpose of him to become a type of christ right paul's hidden purpose to go and get bitten by a snake bring the gospel to that island don't get angry at the east wind because it's blowing your ship into the perfect will of god jonah 4 9 god said to jonah to do us how well to be angry for the gourd he said i do well to be angry even unto death boy how we like to justify our actions despicable as they may be in our attitudes that's just human then said the lord thou hast pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not labored neither made us to grow which came up in a night and perished in a night should not i spare nineveh he said that's a plant you know why jonah had pity on it it fulfilled jonah's purpose it helped him along the way nineveh was going to help god fulfill his purpose oh my and there was a hidden purpose that jonah didn't know now look here here he said can you should not i spare nineveh where there's more than six scorers 120 000 people that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and i love that he adds this in here god even cared about the animals he said all so much cattle my daughter's going to give me a hard time about that because i give them dogs a hard time but god even cared about the cows see god had a purpose for jonah he had a purpose for the ship to tarshish for the storm for the fish for the lord for the worm east wind for the ninevites but jonah's anger stemmed from his arrogance he thought he knew what god needed to do don't get angry jonah you don't know everything i got to remind myself of that sometimes don't get angry when that person says that you don't know everything not that person that don't know everything but you don't know everything and jonah tapped into the mind of god or rather david did when he said maybe the lord told him to do that man's out there spitting and throwing rocks and joab grabs his sword he's going to cut his head off he said maybe the lord told him to do it because there was a hidden purpose one day christ would walk up that same hill and be spit on yes you don't know everything i don't know everything committed to god jonah didn't know he said well why didn't jonah know because god didn't tell him see brother branham said god don't have to tell you everything see so he don't even tell his prophets everything he just does what he wants to do he's god oh my i want you to notice now as we're closing jonah was right the ninevites would ultimately turn back to their evil ways but would not be destroyed until they fulfilled their purpose 150 years later they would be destroyed the same prophet that prophesied to help jeroboam defeat assyria also preached repentance to nineveh that don't make sense to us but it does to god which kept them alive long enough to completely destroy the northern kingdom of israel you go back in history look in the book of kings second kings you begin to see it which kept them alive long enough to completely destroy the northern kingdom of israel jonah's prophecy did that had they been destroyed in 40 days they couldn't have been the adversary to israel but i told you there's a hidden purpose now watch watch closely and we'll close they made they destroyed israel they made judah a vassal state that would have finally fought to the babylonians when they were destroyed by the babylonians now what happened when the assyrians conquered israel and i told i gave joel a clue to this the other night and i don't know if he's found it or not but there's a direct link between jonah and the woman at the well jonah and the woman at the well when the assyrians conquered israel they resettled the lands with other conquered peoples and those peoples became the samaritans you find that in second kings 17 24. brother brown talked about the samaritans are half jew half gentile it's because of that resettlement that came in and the jews that were left they mixed with them and it became a different kind of religion that still held on to the jewish religion and second kings chapter 17 explains that i'll just read the one verse but you can go and read it for yourself later it explains how that happened second kings 17 24 the king of assyria brought men from babylon from qatar from eva from hamath from sephirovin and placed him in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel now watch jonah's prophecy allowed nineveh to live so the king of assyria could come back and bring men from babylon and from qatar and from ava and from all these cities and bring them back into the land and put them in samaria josephus tells us that these are the samaritans who were there when jesus came came especially the ones from qatar that city that particular city those were the samaritans that were there when jesus came now watch 150 years after jonah's prophecy nineveh is destroyed hundreds of years later a samaritan woman with a life full of problems oh god i hope you can see the providence of god don't get angry at god he knows what he's doing i saw this a couple days ago for the first time in my life and i just about run around the room i thought oh god if you could do that for that woman yes a samaritan woman with a life full of problems comes to a well knowing nothing about the the nations that god has moved in order for her to be there because if there had never been donor's prophecy there would have never been any samaritans right there would have never been a samaritan woman but the sign of the messiah would not only be shown in the type in jonah's resurrection but jonah would have a direct link to it being shown by jesus at the well i've always wondered why did he have to go to that samaritan woman now watch here was a woman with a life full of problems coming to a well and a man said woman bring me a drink seemed like just a normal life event but god was closing a cycle that began hundreds of years earlier so you don't know what god's doing tonight you don't know what he's going to do next week you don't know other things happen the way that they did and why churches and things have we see the the minor details god sees the big picture woman bring me a drink and he showed her the sign of the messiah she believed it why did she believe it brother brown said look at that little woman she had fallen from god's thoughts she had fallen from god's thoughts she was a thought of god and because she was a thought of god god would move heaven and earth yes yes sir lord of god and in the end none of her five husbands mattered none of the sin that she was in none of the things oh god if you just see it today none of the problems that she'd had because hundreds of years before god made a prophet go to nineveh are you hearing me tonight this is scripture now so that the samaritans would resettle so so the assyrians would resettle in samaria so there would be a samaritan woman who was in an outcast tribe and an outcast herself oh god that would believe god he works in mysterious ways you know why the samaritans accepted the jewish religion or what parts of it they accepted go read second kings chapter 17 i believe it is where it talks about that it talks about how that they they come in to the land and then there were actually lions that come out of the wilderness and they ate them up and they come back to the king and they said hey we don't know the gods of this land send us a priest to teach us because they just wiped the land clean so they brought a jewish priest back from assyria to come back into the land to teach the people about judaism so they could live there oh my so she would know say would god wouldn't do that for one person why not she was a thought of god and not one thought of god will ever be wasted not one thought of god will ever fall to the ground and so god moved heaven and earth yes to find one woman oh god why she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven jonah had no hadn't gone to nineveh they would have never repented if they had not repented they would not have been destroyed in 40 days if they were they were or they would have been destroyed in 40 days if they were destroyed they would have never conquered israel never taken the tribes captive never replaced them with the samaritans there would have been no woman at the well let me read this to you as the musicians come venom said many times we get nervous remember i read this to you before but i hope we can understand it better now many times we get nervous when we begin to think well it ought to be this way we've got to make it this way or make it that way we don't have nothing to do into it just play our part that he leads us to play remember there's nothing out of cater god knows what he's doing do you believe that tonight oh that just makes me want to worship him a god that could move heaven and earth but he didn't just do that for the samaritan woman she was a type of you and i of the elect that would receive the sign of the son of man one who had representation in heaven god moved heaven and earth and your families to bring you here tonight so you could hear this message at this time quit blaming your circumstances quit quit spending your life worrying laying down on your bed and letting the thoughts overcome you of anger and fear don't get nervous god's got it [Music] he knows why you're going through what you're going through it's his purpose his providence to bring it about he he knew why jonah would go through what he did jonah may have never understood till he got to heaven never understood thought he was a failed preacher a failed prophet who only got mad when he shouldn't have that's where the book of jonah ends by the way is the last one we read god rebuking jonah we don't even know what happened to jonah after that because when god's done with a man he just takes him off the earth he's done with him he didn't use stone anymore but he used him for a very great purpose god is using your life tonight for a very great purpose you may not see what it is but maybe that redemption arc is coming back that circle's coming around maybe you're the one that gets the benefit from something god did hundreds of years ago you just let god be god quit trying to play god let god be god i don't have to have my hands in every little thing that goes on in every church and then every little thing that goes on in this church god help me tonight i don't have to play god god knows what he's doing god plays himself quite well you don't have to oh god you don't have to act he knows what he's doing let's just let him be god can we do that tonight just let it rest in his hands lord you know what you're doing you'll move heaven and earth to see me saved see my loved ones come in you'll move heaven and earth you don't know how he's going to do it what's going to happen you're lost right now you can't see a way out but he sees it he knows what's coming bow your heads with me for a moment heavenly father lord as we come to the end of this service lord and perhaps to the end of this series i pray lord that you would just help us impress us lord with your omniscience with your with your i'm not presence or with your abilities oh god we don't want to be impressed with our own abilities tonight but lord we are so impressed with yours we were your thoughts before the foundation of the world the prophet of god told us that that's why we could hear the message in our day that's why we had a desire to be here tonight we were your thoughts and we may have come down a hard path there may have been a lot of detours along the way but lord we know that there's a direct path of things that have been going on for many many years you've moved heavens and earth and we may not know till we get there but you've moved heavens and earth to make us a believer to put us in the family that we grew up in to put us in the church that we're in now you moved heaven and earth lord and i want to thank you for it tonight i want to thank you for leading me lord help me just to follow help me just to follow lord help me not to get too much in the flesh and to rely too much on the intellect but oh god help me to follow you jonah may have thought he had a great idea of what god should do but lord you knew better i pray god you'd help us just about your will and let you be god let you move and let you work lord we've seen you do so many things little proofs lord of your of your power lord that you've shown to us but we can't see the whole map we don't see the whole picture what we do see sometimes becomes a burden to us because we know what's coming on this earth lord while we're here maybe we have a burden for lost souls may we reach out oh god it may even hurt us to reach out it may even make us less when we give and we give and we give but oh god help us to keep giving help us to keep loving help us not to build a wall of separation oh god but help us lord that we would we would fall into the arms of the omniscience of god we would fall lord under your sovereign grace art and realize that you're the king you know what's going on you can move mountains move nations just to bring us to the place where we ought to be i pray you'd help us tonight to realize that to know it we've never known it before we worship you for that lord we thank you for what you've done i pray once again you would heal every sick body or those that couldn't be here tonight i pray healing virtue would flow hard as they as they receive your word oh god may that word go and flow in their lives lord may they recognize it being what it is may they rejoice oh god that you've come and healed them we pray thank you for everything that you've done i pray for sister karen tonight recovering from knee surgery lord i pray you'd bless her continually oh god may you may there not be pain lord may there be a continual healing lord lord as the doctors did what they could oh god i pray you'd bless her sister sharon lord white camp had that procedure today or tomorrow i believe it is oh god i pray you'd bless very lord that you'd guide the doctor's hands there would be no more additional trouble that should heal what's already happened i pray you grant it hard we know that you're a healer we know you're the same yesterday today and forever i pray you'd move now in our midst or in a way of worship may we just take a moment and worship you for who you are lord as we come lord to the end of this study may we be so impressed by your power the lord will say i'll follow you all the way i pray you grant it now ask in jesus name amen thank you lord jesus thank you lord oh where he lives i'll sing it tonight [Music] stand with me if you wish to tonight let's just sing it together i'll go with it oh yes i'll go with him [Music] all the way
