name amen thank thank the Lord thank the Lord hallelujah I enjoyed just that moment of worship with you just so wonderful uh to see the people of God enjoying the house of God I told Brother Joel here recently we need to enjoy church sometimes those of us who work in the church we we don't enjoy church as much as we ought to but I just want to enjoy church with you today worship together with you around the word of the Lord amen Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 1 I want to kind of pick up on a thought that we had dealt with two weeks ago but I want to title this this morning the United bride we talked about the bride in the American church and so we want to talk about the United bride this morning again dealing with that Vision that brother brandham saw of the Bride the preview of the Bride in Ephesians 4:1 Paul writing he said I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where withth you are called all with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there's one body and one Spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all we thank the Lord for the word you may be SE seated this morning brother brandom sees that Vision on July 3rd 1964 the preview of the Bride he was taken to a review stand and you'll remember the bride came by uh the bride coming this way coming by the review stand and here uh they come and then come the churches separated by National Group each one of them uh uh coming along and he said the bride was marching by sweetly with an air with a character and attitude about them of the word and he sees the churches dressed immorally dancing to rock and roll Beach she's separated by National Group she's led by a witch uh remember there was no leader in front of the Bride but she was looking to the review stand that's where I want to be looking this morning we don't count success by Earthly man but we count success by the review stand the word of God and God sent a message in our day for a reason and so the bride was watching that and as she went by and uh but yet the church was led by this witch and and and the church would go up to the crest of a hill and brother Rand saw in the vision as they marched by that the church would go like they were going up but then when they went to the crest of the Hill they went down uh though they thought perhaps that they were going up but they actually went down but he said the bride when she marched off she just kept on going up she never went down I'm so grateful for that today I believe that's the preview of where we're at and as we're as we're moving up and going forward so uh he said that uh they they there was no leader again they were just watching the review stand and there was no disunity in the bride group uh yet there was one from every nation right there was one he talked about different kinds of and and different nations that they come from not separated by National Group all marching together he said these started marching right up into the skies he said and when they went to marching I noticed a couple of little girls in the back he said look like uh it might be some foreign girl like Sweden or Switzerland or somewhere he said they started to look around and I I said don't do that don't get out of that step right don't get out of that step and he said that might happen happened after he was gone and then he he comes down here he said I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers and I looked and here come that s a bunch of little girls remember they come by once and then the church come by and he was just smitten in his heart he said is this all we've produced for God and then suddenly here comes he said the bride must come again and when she come by she was the Omega bride she was the the just like the first bride the alpha bride the beginning bride the Bride of the end was just like the first bride yes and brother M said she was smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word yeah she was the word she might have had different uh worship Styles or different there might have been differences in culture and differences in he's talked about the differences the way she wore hair and different things but yet they were all the bride they were all Church they were all a part of the Bride they were all marching to the beat of the word and he said she was the word they look like one out of every nation he said I was looking at it as they passed by and I seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up he said I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line and I screamed stay in line and the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line oh that's what I want to do brother Justin stay in line I want to stay right in line with the word of God sent for our hour each one of them dressed different but decently each one of them keeping their eyes on the voice and the voice behind the voice the message of the hour as they passed by we found that we all want to be in that bride group and I've been struck by that over the past couple of weeks as I haven't been able to remove myself from this thought I want to be part of that bride because remember that's the bride that lives in the city right that's the elect the ones that are going to live in the city is the bride they're the ones and I want to live there I want to be there I want to be a part of that I want to do whatever it takes to be a part of that bride group yet recognizing I can't put myself into that by effort but it takes the election of God and and to give me even a desire to serve God it's got to be his election that does that and his calling so you can't put yourself in nobody can take you out if you're ever a part of that bride group you come out of the mind of God and you're going back to God so you can't be taken out it's Eternal so no one can take you out and so uh and we talked about that and now uh we are the ones who've been called who been chosen to come out of Babylon who have heard the voice of Revelation 18 and obeyed that voice and we're the ones that he spoke to in Luke 12:32 when he said fear not little flock I wonder if that's us this morning if we could be counted as that little flock as a part a portion of that little flock fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom oh I'm so grateful for that today yeah so you can't put yourself in or out if you're part of the bridegroom that city is your future home and the Bible says God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes aren't you looking forward to that he wipe away all tears from their eyes there should be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away the bride makes herself ready for that place we talked about that Wednesday how that she the bride has made herself ready brand said God didn't push you through a pipe and pull you out the other end and say you're an overcomer but the bride is an overcomer and so there's something you have to do but you've been provided with what to do it with you've been provided with the message of the hour been provided with the word to dress yourself in that it's his righteousness not yours so the Bible said as wife has made herself ready he said at the end of the age he said how did she make herself ready becoming his wife what does she what kind of a garment she had on his own word she was dressed in his righteousness so the bride is Washed by the Water of the word I'm go I'm backgrounding this to go somewhere this morning so just kind of bear with me the word washes her dresses her makes her ready and she must be in step and stay in step with that word as she continues mark and I want you to understand today that the message is not is today to you that have been called out of Babylon the message is not calling you uh to a continual uh to a continual getting saved again or or receiving the Holy Ghost again although you we want to be refilled many times but if you're sealed you're sealed and if you're saved you're saved and nothing can take that away but what the message is calling us to today and what the messenger is calling calling us to what the preachers that are preaching are calling us to what we would call the five-fold ministry they're calling us to uh to a perfection in our walk to a place where we can walk in step with the word and a perfection in our walk is not a a a Perfection by the blood because that we can only be perfected by the blood sinless Perfection but it's a maturity to where we can when we walk we can walk in line with the word so it's calling us to a mature place a mature bride with a mature walk because the seed has got to become to a place of maturity before we can go home so if you go back to Ephesians 4 so I said all that as a background so the clock starts now if you go back to Ephesians chapter 4 Paul is saying the same thing that brother brandom says when he sees the vision get back in Step get back in line look how Paul word said I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you I beg you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called he's telling you walk worthy walk in Step yeah walk according to the word right and and brother Brandon was calling get back in line what did he say over what did they say over there he said I preach what Paul preached they said we're resting on that so as brother brandham the the messenger to our hour was calling us get back in Step Paul is saying walk worthy yeah of the vocation wherewith you're called yeah in other words get back in Step get back in line right so God has chosen us God has chosen you you're his elect and we need to understand that we need to believe that he speaks directly to you to you young people to your older folks to all of us he speaks directly to us sister Betty and says we are chosen by him and it's so wonderful to be chosen yeah but yet we must stay in step with the word right and I I'll confess that many times in the past that I've looked at that I I believe in Holiness I believe I preach Holiness I I've told people if you want to see what I believe about Holiness uh look at my family I we try to live a hus lifestyle try to do that the very best that we can and yet many times when I hear get back in step when I was younger I would hear that brother bill has wear your dresses a little longer maybe you're sleep a little longer or or not you know not to trim your hair or not to wear makeup and all that and I'll say this that should be Elementary to us at this point that should be Elementary and we'll keep preaching it because people still need it our young people still need it we still need to hear it we still need to hear those things and we'll preach those things and I do preach those things and yet when I see those things you see you know when you see a church that that that are all out of order in that way and I don't believe you are today but if we are get back in line but but that's the only thing I thought of when I thought get back in line get back in line with the Holiness standard of the word and yet that's not the only part of the word that we needed to get back in line with am right that was part of the word it is part of the word and we need to be in line with that when you see a church that's not in line with that cuz nobody ever preaches it right right that's not all there is to being a Christian right cuz you could wear long skirts and long hair and and look ever so Godly yeah and and and talk to you for five minutes you got a rotten attitude right and a rotten disposition and and treat people rotten and and God don't do that are you with me this morning so we want to come back in step with the word we want to increase our faith that's being in step with the word believing What God Says over everything else that's being in step with the word and coming to a place of maturity in our relationships and how we treat people and the way that we Fellowship together or not whatever it is that we do we we got to come to a maturity in that in order to reach the place that we're going to because when we get over there we're going to live in one city when we get over there we're not going to be separated by National Group when we get over there so we can't be separated in our hearts by that today right are you with me so far so I I I've come to see a little bit deeper meaning in getting back in step and this is what Paul is dealing with in Ephesians 4 he deals in Ephesians with how we walk in the sense of our morality and things like that but then he goes deeper he goes deeper because many of us most of us walk in a moral lifestyle in a way that's right in that way and yet many times and even before immorality shows up many times it shows up in character first and we don't put as much stress on that and really if we could if people would would recognize that a person who mistreats people maybe mistreats his wife or mistreats his children or mistreats a church or mistreats uh the center the person on the street yeah right there's something wrong with that person right we don't mistreat people and sometimes you say well people might take advantage sometimes they do but we don't mistreat people they took advantage of Jesus they took advantage of his silence on the cross didn't they they took advantage of of the fact that he stood there and let himself be beat to an inch of his life they took advantage of the fact they didn't call 10,000 angels they took advantage of him but he stood there and took it yes brother Bruce why he was paying for our sins but he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus he left an example for you to follow in his steps now when you're in step with the word you're in harmony with one another I know I'm going to address something because we've all been trained like well that's not being one is not being one with one another and that's true and that's important it's being one with the word yeah right right being one for us is not being one with one another it's being one with the word yeah but that makes you one with one another when you're one with the word because to be one with the word to be in step with the word is to be in harmony with the other members of the Bride don't mean you all see eye to eye in in every little Iota and every little thing we're not producing a cult right God's not looking for a bunch of people all identically dressed and all identically know God's a god of variety yes right and but it's learning how to uh if I could say borrow from our Wednesday nights learning how to till our own plot of land yeah right learning how to learning how to work our own corn and field and and learning how not to look at over what everybody else is doing and and doing what it takes to just take care of what God has given us right so in first John 1 and 7 the bible says if we walk in the light so I you know I I appreciate that song bringing me out on that song with Alan because this is part of what I'm preaching about today is Walking In The Light yeah right Walking In step is walking in the light of the word he said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another what is our fellowship based on the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from how much sin come on Church how much sin your sin my sin his sin her sin come on church all sin all sin now you say well you don't understand what they did to me all sin right right and we can have fellowship with one another because we have fellowship with God and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all a every sin that we've committed good so this is not an artificial Unity yeah as the church was kept in line by nation and kept in line by politics and kept in line by a witch which brother B said was the World Council of churches right a false Unity but it's not an artificial Unity but Jesus prayed we might be one with the father United with the word yes as he and the father were one now we know that artificial Unity brings the Tower of Babylon if the Lord lets me tonight I want to preach a little bit more about that about that Tower of Babylon some things on that but in John 17:1 he said now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are he wasn't talking about natural Unity but spiritual Oneness with god brother brandham says this and he had the people repeat it he said Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word huh the whole word and to make it manifested in power that's a challenge right there if we just take that quote and live it that that that'd be that'd be about all we ever needed yeah think about it Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word cuz all of us can agree with some of the word right right but the bride agrees with all the word the whole word to make it man you say well I don't walk in step with every word but the bride is trying to get back in step right even in a late hour even in a difficult time even after the prophets left the scene are you are you with me the bride's the ones trying to get back in Step as she's going up yeah and so the Oneness is to make it manifested in power he said there you are that's oness with God when that power Works in me and works in you he said We Are One Hallelujah he said Amen brother kid he's talking to an old brother there old preacher I believe he said when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you there's no disagreement the words there it works it makes it what it is yeah God made flesh in You by his word are you with me so far the word made Power among you every word so I want to focus down now as we focus broadly on walking and step with the word I want to focus down now uh so take out your spiritual binoculars let's just focus on one area and recognize this isn't all there is but this is what Paul deals with in Ephesians 4 which is important because of what else he deals with in Ephesians 4 so in Ephesians 4:2 so he says I want you to walk worthy of the vocation where with you're called get back in line stay in line stay in Step look with with all lonliness and meekness yeah with longsuffering forbearing one another in love I know I I I've been accused of being a kind old priest and and I guess it's okay to be accused of being kind but I don't like the priest part but I've been accused of being too soft and things and I you know what what if this is what we're lacking the whole word's been revealed yeah right right the whole word is here the opening of the word revealed all the Mysteries yes it's all here yeah but what if what we're lacking is that final little bit of of of of refining that makes us treat one another right as I've mentioned to you before that the brid tree goes comes back up in reverse order from the way it was eaten away and so the last thing to be restored before the coming of the Capstone love was brotherly kindness right so the last two are closely identified with what we're talking about today so when you look at that and look at the unity that we should have one with another Paul's saying this is how you have it by being in step with the word not just in our dress or not just in our in the way we have church I believe we should be in unity with the word in those ways but in how we treat one another how we treat one another within the family how we treat one another within the church family amen come on Church it matters and if you think I'm I'm especially sensitive to this I am because I grew up in a home where my my and my dad's passed away and gone on to his reward and and and he made some things right with me before he passed away but I grew up in a home where this wasn't done yeah and it was all about the word and being right with the word and all of this thing but but they failed to recognize that part of that is being right with one another and loving one another and treating your family right and treating your your wife right come on church that's part of the word too and if you can't do that how you ever going to do the other on and we're we fuss and fight and fought and and squabbled and and and and lashed and and and devoured one another what did it get us yeah huh what what it get us in the end come on tell me allall live through those times everyone to be a defender of the word and pull out a sword and I believe in defending the word but what did it get us being separated and and and in this area what did it get us being like that got division among churches and division among preachers and division among people and and division among families and people separating from one another because I believe this about the message and I believe that about the message why don't we just come back and believe what a prophet said and and have church and love people because the children are watching and they're affected more by your attitude than what you say they may not always remember everything you say but they remember the attitude you said it in and they remember how how you dealt with things and how you deal with things and they know what you're like at home I know what I'm like at home I'll be the first to admit I need a little refining and I think all of us do when it comes to this this area loneliness is humility humility humility is not how how you dress you know you can dress like never thought I'd say you can dress like brother Landon this morning and still be humble that's powerful man I I almost ask you if you wanted to preach I I like a good suit and tie I'm I'm just you know you want to get in good with me that's how to do it right there oh that's just you know I like to see a person that looks like they you know boy I got myself in trouble there I do like to see a suit and tie and that right Jaden so these young men starting doing that man that's that's nice but that's not you know humility you could you could be proud of that humility is not just wearing uh uh wearing uh I started to say something else but that's not what it wearing the rags they used to wear you know when they sackcloth and Ashes right you could have sackcloth and Ashes and be proud of them but what's humility humility of the heart yeah humbling yourself to the word saying Lord what you want for my life that's what I you want me to wear a suit I'll wear a suit if you want me to wear overalls I'll wear overall if you want me uh to work a certain job I'll do it if you want me to have a certain office I'll do it whatever it is you want me to do Lord I'm humbling myself to you amen meekness meekness in this place in the script scripture now there's different words that are used for meekness but in this place in the scripture this word for meekness is gentleness courtesy yeah on and you think well C you know I can be as discourteous as I want to be I can be as rude as I want to be and still follow the word not according to Paul not according to brother brandom right you you can't do that we treat one another with courtesy courtesy and that's more than just being nice and saying please and thank you although our young people ought to learn to do that right treat one another with courtesy even on the youth group chat thinking about one another and what we say and what we do come on church and how we treat one another and how you treat one another listen to me if you're treating one another badly now uh that they don't bode well for the future you need to be one and our young people don't treat each other badly but I just thought I'd Dro that in there because the devil gets in those things you young you young ones you you know you get to the point where you you feel like well I'll just pick at this one because of uh their size or their height or how they're dressed or something like that don't do that be courteous to one another uh get get in a habit of being nice to one another now so you can so you can later on it won't be difficult for you courtesy you say what does that mean well we need to be courteous with one another with the Holy Spirit courteous with one another when Paul when he said how we should take communion he said we should carry one for another there's a great lesson in that I don't just take it and rush off by yourself but communion is Oneness are you with now we Terry one for another we pray one for another and so maybe one part of the body maybe you didn't get nothing out of the service and the service goes a little bit long cuz somebody's here at the altar praying I said we ought to be courteous to one another a courteous another maybe you got something to do but you can wait 5 minutes maybe and and if you have to leave and slip off courteously and nicely we we should be courteous gentle with one another cuz you never know who you might have to live next to in that city right might be that person you couldn't stand but they might be a Christian yeah come on longsuffering is patience yes patience with each other and patience with God patience forbearing and brother B talks about these things we could go back and tie it into the to the virtues to the stature of a perfect man which is essentially what we're talking about but approaching it from a different direction forbearing is accepting complaints Welly there's a hard one accepting complaints yeah I had to think twice about that one it means that when somebody complains about you to you or you hear about it you're just willing to say okay it's all right maybe I do need help amen maybe I do need to change that's tough isn't it accepting complaints a lot of pastors would have a whole lot more people in their churches if they just accept complaints but they fight it and then and then end up people leaving and getting hurt and I'll be honest with you not everybody's bride I know that I don't know who is and who isn't so I want to keep y'all around as much as I can yet I realize people leave people will people there are people you just can't help but I pray they get help somewhere else I don't want bad for them God help me if I'd ever had that kind of an attitude yeah accepting complaints maybe we do need to look at that and examine that and see yeah and then if you complain too much that's on you you know come on church that's not me I don't have to deal with that just let me forbear accept a complaint Ephesians 4:3 endeavoring or being zealous to keep the unity of the spirit to keep the unity of the spirit because we have the unity of the spirit but we have to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace yeah verse four there is one body and one Spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling said we're all one one Lord One Faith one baptism yes one God and Father of all who's above all through all in you all but unto every one of us now see he says we're all one but we're not all the same we're all one but he gave he unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ we're all one but we're not all the same if you go down to verse 11 Paul begins to deal with the five-fold ministry in Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers I'm so glad we're not all the same because I would hate to hear me all the time that would just kill me I don't listen to myself preach I would just kill me to to have to hear me all the time I want to hear somebody that's got a different kind of a gift are you with me now I want to hear Brother Joel and brother Stewart because they got a different gift than I do but it blesses my heart to hear them and other brothers that come through just brother Andrew and different ones we use all the time and we we we just want to hear that gift but it don't mean everybody should be the same we're not supposed to be the same right but we're supposed to be one yes are you with me now so he said he he said for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith where brother Ben when are you going to quit preaching this when we all come in the unity of the faith when is that going to be I believe it'll be right then when we go home it' be right at that moment when we go home we may not come in unity of of which pie we like we may not come in unity of preference right on we may not come in unity of opinion yes but we've got to come in the unity of the faith yes what is that the message of the hour what God has revealed to us in the hour we come in unity to that come in the unity of the face of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a mature man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the sight of men and cunning crafs whereby they lie and wait to deceive I'm I'm ready to give up my come on Church there comes a time when you become knowledgeable when you be get ready you're ready to give up your diaper yeah I've always said when a kids old enough to change it themselves they're old enough to get rid of it ready to give up my bottle I want to eat some steak I've grown up I I want different food I want different diet I'm ready to give up the baby stuff I'm ready to give up the squabbles and the pettiness come on church I'm ready to give it up and let God begin to move and let God begin to be the object of our attention and our worship listen he said we hence for been on more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine every little thing that blows Along come on church we know better than that yeah we've been taught better than that yes by the sight of men and cunning crafs whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is ahead even Christ right from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so he's talking he begins to talk about the different parts of the body and how everyone fits one with another yeah Oneness with the word I believe will produce clean living how many believe that it'll produce Godly dress good marriages beautiful families wonderful local churches yes it'll also produce Unity yes right as more and more the bride becomes one with the word a United bride now you can all be in one place and be what brother brandom called disunified together or be scattered all over the face of the Earth and yet be United under one message yes good see the unity never took away our individual characteristics but each one of us were predestined to manifest some portion of the promise which is our allotment in that promise brother brand talks about the American Indian and it is a Marvel because if you think about how few of us Europeans there was uh around and how little of brother Wendell's kind that there was in the country you know there weren't very many there weren't very many of us there was a whole lot of little Josh Martins running around you know and and there wasn't very many of us and yet today the white man is kind of taken over and the Indian lives on a reservation why did that happen if you go back and study it at first there was hundreds of thousands maybe millions of Indians it wasn't an uninhabited land but they couldn't work together they they they had tribes and disputes and wars and every time there was a war half of them would align with this one this European power and half of them with this European power by the time they got done they slaughtered one another that's right they just couldn't get along with one another and brother brandom identifies that as like the denominations yes he said how did the American in lose he said they were Superior in numbers yeah and even they were Superior in tactics and at first in Weaponry but they failed to get United until hundred hundreds of years later and they finally United themselves and want a great victory over kuster but it was too late right cuz the war the the the the uh culture and and and the the settlement had Advanced too far they let it go too long and brother Brandon when he talked about that he said this he said we dis unify the body of Christ we should never be divided yeah we might differ in ideas but let's be heart in heart Brothers God wants us to be he died for the entire Church of God and we do not want to be disunified now brother Randon would always talk about how he wanted the denominations to work together right and if you've ever been around a denominational Church some of y'all were raised in message churches and I was too but I spent more time around denominational people than I did message people and I come to realize this you're not going to get a whole lot of unity between uh the Pentecostals and the Baptist I've noticed curiously the one thing that brings Unity now is music right they all kind of worship the same way whether wherever you go but that wasn't the case even when I was a kid everybody had their own liturgy and their own worship and their own way of doing things but you couldn't even get we come out of the uh Holiness movement and you had you had uh a hundred different denominations and some of them only had 10 15 churches and and their General Camp would be attended by 100 people and yet they had a denomination the only difference in one denomination another was this one would wear a tie and that one wouldn't that's right or this one believed in open toed shoes and this one didn't yeah and that was the whole difference Y and thank God for a prophet in our age because there's something we can come back to because each one of them any little guy can come up with his own interpretation of the word and just run off and do his own thing right right so that's what why God had to call a prophet because with different men you got different opinions right about how to do things right so God had to call a prophet in our hour but brother brandom talked about that and how that he wished they would come together but they never would he said but my Ministry he said is a Ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together trying to unite the body of Christ together not unite denominations to one denomination listen but unite brothers and sisters as one group of people one in purpose so could we be that today one in heart one in you to see the coming of the Lord Jesus oh my so brother brand never looked at the denominations and said you have too much Unity come on now yeah yeah he looked at them and said you're getting a false Unity right but he never looked at them and said you got too much Unity what he said was we must first be United with the word and that word breaks down the walls that hinder fellowship with those of like Precious Faith you remember the story of the Ducks brother BR said the Ducks were all on the pond but they were separated by fences yeah but once the water came up what happened the Ducks floated over the fences and began to Fellowship him what was keeping the ducks apart the fences what kept people apart denominationalism idolatry as it as it relates to that the Babylon system which was a confusion of language right where they all spoke different things and so they all they all begin to group off in different places and and so it's like ducks on the pond brother brand gives another illustration involving Ducks he talks about a leader he talks about this United time and sign he talks about in different places he talked about a ducks that had to have a leader and if you got a good leader the leader at a certain time he's stirred to be raised up he feels that maybe that first chill in the air and and he stirred to be raised up and to fly up into heavens and begin to call for the other d to join him and then pretty soon they're all together and they fly off to a southern land where they won't freeze to death right ain't type that to us but he said if you follow the wrong leader you end up in the wrong place right so they all fly to the rice fields of Arkansas or Louisiana and they they can they can spend the winter there if the hunters don't get them they they can spend the winter there but he talked about how that this certain duck he said was got so off course he got to look at at the wrong thing he got the following the wrong leader and he ended up in England all the way across and probably never made it back to their Homeland because of where they were there's death in that Journey that he he just ended up in the wrong place I say this today we've got a leader taking us back to our future home that leader we know is the Holy Ghost but it's in the message of the hour that's his way of doing it we have a leader taking us Back to Future Let's Stay with that leader under the banner of the message of the hour let's fly home together good now why is that so difficult for us it's because we Elevate our personal opinions to word status on come on now and every little honk we hear we like well that may be right we get our brother BR said we have to focus listen what he says here it's really important he said we got to get ourselves focused till whether we live or die sink or drown it's Calvary Christ that's the thing that God wants us to come back to and men in the focus of God's word instead of bringing it together and making it say the one thing that God makes it say we look at the natural side now he's explaining how denominations organizations get started he said we look at the natural side therefore it man doing that he gets himself into a place that he just takes off after the thing that's presented now here's it's a great teaching if we can ident identify this is how you identify somebody that's getting off an error or a group that's becoming organizational in their mindset because listen what he says happens he said he said if a man doing that he gets himself into a place he takes off after the thing that's presented he said here's an opportunity now he's quoting this these people that we us little group we can do this and we won't have nothing to do with the rest of them it's how denominations get started he said on that see that's the first thing is presented now watch this the first thing is presented so if you go to a church and the and and the very first thing that's presented that's their Doctrine so if you go to a church you've never been to even a message church maybe and you go there and the first thing they they tell you they look at you and they say what do you believe about brother brandom whether whether or not he fulfills certain Visions yeah come on now that's the very first thing right or what do you believe about what the Ria right what do you believe about this certain Doctrine and that becomes all they preach yes right right it's the thing that's presented right that they rally around and become an organization around though there may even be truth in what they're saying yeah and there's not truth in all of it some of it's just stupid right but some of it there's some truth to so it's a little more you know you lean towards it a little bit more right cuz there's a little element of truth to it but it's the only thing they present right and so they present it over and over and over again and I say if you go to that church you'll starve yes right right because that's all they're presenting it's one thing yeah and and it's not the message Noah presented one thing but it was the message of the hour yeah what we present is the full word yes right we have access to the full word that's what we present and our Focus ought to be on a Rapture going home right right so so brother say the first thing is presented instead of focuses in to know that it's brotherly love that we should have one for another and to understand one another and to love one another and to worship with one another they degrade a man because of his clothes he wears or the education he has or the color of his skin or something like that he said and it separates the people and man takes off after that yeah that's right so brother talked about us and he talked about even in that quote he talked about us being a three-part being he said men cater to the natural right they cater to the Natural and so two-thirds of you as I heard a brother say it I believe it was brother Donnie he said this he said two-thirds of you are fighting with two-thirds of them and that's why you have church problems there's a lot of Truth to that right I put that in my own words but there's a whole lot of Truth to that because we cater to the Natural that's why we have divisions yes we cat well I'm aul I'm of apollis right and that's what the Corinthians Church did and said for you yet carnal you're yet carnal you're not spiritual yet you're not where you're supposed to be he said for as there's among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men he didn't say you're yet carnal I see short short hair and slacks and things look that obviously that would be carnal yeah but that's not what he said yeah he said you're yet carnal not because you don't look like a church not because you don't look like message people but because there's en being among you in strife and divisions yes sir so you're carnal yeah God help me never to go to that place amen you're yet carnal I spoke here and again we all fight with that every one of us fight with it when are we going to stop fighting with it brother man when we get a new body yeah cuz this one never gets converted right and I've preached that for years something God showed me early on in my Ministry we never this never gets converted this flesh never does yeah it gets controlled yes but never converted till we go home the fullness of adoption true is the Redemption of our body yes oh my but the soul is redeemed now listen what brother BR said and and I want to take this and I know some people say well brother BR preached about love in the 50s but not after the opening the word that's wrong right you just haven't looked enough at the message brother brandom all these quotes now I'm going to read here at the end the the the ones I have remaining are from the opening of the word he said as I spoke here not long ago I believe was at the Tabernacle God is so great he can become so simple he said now when we get so great we can't be simple we know too much and we get to oh it's just got to be this way the way we say it or it isn't at all come on now well that way we miss God come on I wonder how many times we've missed God cuz we thought it has to be this way the way we say it or it isn't at all that oh I don't want to miss God I need God I need him we need him for the healing of our children we need him for the healing of our elders we need him for uh to move among us we need sou come on church we need the shout of the king in the camp we need the presence of God Among Us how we going to have it we we miss God when we begin to say oh it's my way or the highway come on right we miss him yes we don't see his presence working his control his love for the church good yes like balum we see the hinder parts and we don't see the shout of the king we don't see a brass serpent yeah we failed to see an atonement yes oh God help me today brother brandom talked about how he got so critical as a minister he got to the point where he couldn't he couldn't he couldn't treat the people maybe in in just the right way in his heart he still treated people right even during that time but he got in his heart he got he got up he got upset almost was angry he got he got a complex he said because people he kept preaching and people kept doing it he called him Ricky and retes and the angel told him not to do that not to do that why he said those are there's some of God's sheep in there yeah and you've been called to be a prophet not a prophet St out of the woods somewhere but a prophet among the people a prophet a prophet that preaches I'm so glad that he sted among the people and he preached the opening of the word to us what would we do without it but but even he got in that condition and I have to remind myself I don't want to get cynical I don't want to get critical come on church leaders we need to remember what we're doing here sometimes you just got to get back to the simple joy of a church service where the presence of God is moving and the people of God are blessed and people love one another just a simple joy seeing our children at the altar our young people getting saved getting filled with the spirit the simple joy seeing God heal the sick sometimes you just got to get back to that and recognize said he is able he is able to take care of every situation he is able we don't want to miss God and all of our all of our division and strife and everything else we want to be so simple that we can understand when God comes brother BR said surely after all these years on the field around the world and seeing different people I ought to know I ought to know Oh my he said a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit Spirit ever come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anyone has done if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person you'd be sweet and kind yeah oh church we don't always understand one another we're not always going to understand one another but we try to we make an attempt and we and we commit them to God when we don't understand what's going on we commit them to God he said remember God loved you when you were in sin and the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's in wrong just pray for them and love one another above everything come on Church what have we made the big deal the big thing yeah you think about it what have we made a big deal I hope you're listening to me now yeah well is it how we have church or how many songs we sing what kind of songs we sing huh I know in churches that that's the main thing and if you come there and sing a little bit different song than what they sing you get blasted right right but do that become our main focus that ought to be part of what we do is sing right songs but is that our main focus how you dress what you do come on church what do he say above everything say with me Church everything love God if you love God to love his word yeah you're not going to cross his word for nobody body come on but love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do or if you have a need this morning if you just humble yourself under the mighty hand of God he will exalt you in due time he will provide for you he will help you yes Hallelujah good oh he said take this solemnly take this seriously church we should love one another we should be so in love don't never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with God we are brothers and sisters oh live Godly live like Daughters of God live like sons of God live sweet kind humble let no evil come into your mind in your thinking that's where so much of our trouble begins that's where we have to overcome is in the battle of the mind he said don't let it come in so well how can I help it it'll fly over yes it will but knock it out of the air get of it consciously cast it down every thought that exalts itself against the word of God don't dwell on it knock it down throw it away if if something tells you that your brother or your sister don't love you and you know there're a real Christian take that thought and throw it in the trash cast it down cuz it's not true come on now if they're a real Christian they may be going through a rust fot they may not act like they love you but they love you yes cast it down when you get to if you ever get that thought says I can't make it now who would tell you that the devil who's smarter than you at the moment CU he knows you can make it we don't want to be we don't want to be dumber than the devil come on Church old brother Bosworth used to sit on the platform and he'd Mumble while brother Brandon was preaching and and uh and he'd just Mumble and and brother Billy Paul finally told brother brandom he said you know he said every time you preach brother Bosworth mumbles the whole service and what what he said I don't know what he's doing and and brother BR said I'll ask him and so he asked him said brother Bosworth he said why do you why do you Mumble while I preach and he said oh he said I'm not mumbling he said I'm just saying he said dumb devil poor devil dumb devil what does he do Church listen I don't want to be dumber than the devil old Devil's dumb because he always showed out and he knew he'd be cast out and that's what brother bosw was saying is that he knew every time he come across the platform he'd be he'd be cast out oh the old Devil's dumb isn't he we don't want to be dumber than the devil we want to know we can make it we are going to make it would you ever think anything else yes let no evil come in your mind and you're thinking just dismiss it if it knocks on the door take it away just show your token just keep walking I am under the blood keep walking keep in stamp he says I am under under the blood we ought to honor one another respect one another brother sister and love one another with Undying Love now I've heard this before and you don't have to raise your hand but I know some of you have said it well I just can't and to the Millennials that became a full sentence well I just can't and then now the the Next Generation you know they have their own language but this was something that we said you know when I was younger and those a little bit younger than me we just can't and it just meant you were done well brother brandom said well I just can't well just stay here a little longer if you go back in that sermon you'll find out I think context is important you'll find out brother Brand's preaching about being in the presence of God he's preaching the sermon God in his presence or being in the presence of God come about Isaiah how he was in the presence of God and you say you say I just can't love one another we just can't love one another with undying love I just can't I just can't brother Ben I I just can't I can't do it well just stay hereen why cuz in the presence of God you begin to be like Isaiah and you begin to realize I'm a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean Li Lord cleanse us and set us aside for service said stay here in the presence of God stay here in the in the sanctuary for a minute and find out you begin he said then you will like people too you'll love those who doesn't love you said that's really a good sign of Christianity when you can from your heart love those who does not love you I know people are making degrees of of love you love this one this much and this one that much and I understand we have different obligations we love our families maybe in a little bit different way than we love everybody else but we ought to love the unlovable with a gape love and you can't get any higher love than that we should long to be together uh this is a prophet teaching towards the end of his ministry he said as we see the great end time signs in the earth warning us the time is at hand we should love one another more someone say more than we ever did in all our lives you said brother Ben you preach it but but I want to see it I want to see it too but if we don't preach it how we ever going to see it yeah I believe we see some of it I believe you're a church that loves one another but we want to see more we want to encourage you in that I want to encourage myself in that yes we should love one another more there should be such a hunger to get to church let me just deal with this a little bit because in our hearts sometimes we we get well it doesn't matter we come in when it's convenient yeah but I I'm not preaching at you for not coming to church but there we should examine ourselves ourselves and see is there a hunger to be there cuz some people can't ever come yeah they have a difficult time even getting through the door and yet they want to be yeah they want to be in church I know there's people that stream the service that would love to be here and sit where you sit and they just can't do it and there's people in all different parts of the world that sometimes watch churches in America and they would love to be there maybe in their part of the world there's no church or nowhere to go and they do that that's their way or or they just listen to tapes and that that would be fine that's all they can do but when we can get together that we should get together that's a prophet of God saying this not me right look what he said there should be such a hunger to get to church and you say Well church can be just me and myself and my family that's not what he said there should be such a hunger for us to get to one another right amen it should be a love affair right and Illustrated that about how he wanted to be in Tucson with his wife and the longing and the hunger that he had to be with his wife in Tucson because they didn't he didn't like to be apart from her for a long period of time he said that's the way the church ought to be just seeing that the power of God what it's done for us we should be counting the moments yes getting together in love yes oh it's three days 10 hours 29 minutes and 13 seconds till we get together do you know these kids have more of a revelation of that than some of us adults do now you know that some of y'all are here cuz your kids kind of drive you you know they want to be together God help us to be like little children in this way to want to be together right we get older we get our routines and it's okay to have aone time I'm not telling you you can never have a long time but when we do have an opportunity to come together shouldn't we hunger to be together shouldn't we h to be something in our hearts that says God I just want to be around those of like Precious faith I just want to fellowship with them for a minute what is that hunger it's a it's a desire for Fellowship that was in the mind of God it's an attribute of the Divine that was in God before the foundation of the world by the that you want to be around God's people there's something you just want to be and sometimes we can't be in modern society it gets very difficult I understand that but we want to be together counting the moments getting together in love that we can fly away someday to meet Jesus said we have assembled here no I'm I'm closing here in just a moment but I just want to deal with this and let you know what a prophet taught about these things he said we have assembled here no Lord not for some great glory to be known as Leaders or an official of something great we're just here as humble Believers we're here because we love you how many come to church because you love the Lord we're here because we love you and we love one another and as we see each other and as we congregate together we find that it seems to be more of God don't you want more of God I want more of God not less of God why would I tell people to separate come on why would I tell people not to congregate yeah I want more more that's why it's such a hard decision sometimes for safety reasons we have to cancel church or maybe a bunch of people are going to be out of town we want to be considerate to one another right and sometimes we cancel we have to cancel but as a pastor I want us to be together more more what did Paul say assemble yourselves together more as we see the day approaching I'm not going to have a bunch more services but let's when we do come together let's take advantage of it Church be together more and when we are it be it brings more of God yes I want more of God not less of God that's simple math [Laughter] right Jesus said if you'll do this in my name I'll be in your midst sister Betty was telling me the birthday party yesterday how that she longs to be in church she always wants to be in church and her kids her children testified to me of the faithfulness in her heart to be in the house of God when she can't be here she she sits at home and streams the service I say thank the Lord for that thank the Lord for those that want to be to have a hunger maybe you can't always be here but there's something in your heart hunger to be in the house of God oh that's what draws us together but JT we've had many differences and things that have come up over the years there's been many things maybe we we didn't see I eye or disagreed about but one thing was the same we wanted to be together because we're the same Faith one Lord One Faith one baptism there many things we might disagree about but we still come together why there's something Divine in that in the unity of the bride all marching together marching to one step of the word oh my see each one believer symbols in one certain place what did that say it seems to be more of God gathers together as each believer assembles himself in one certain place yeah well we can't do that every week we can't have meetings with all the churches but we can go to our church yeah right when we have meetings we love that we love the fellowship but we can go to our church in one certain place and Jesus said if you'll do this in my name I'll be in your midst and we know that you are here hallelujah brother Brandon said this he said we should love one another during this time all right the church and the believer should be unseparable that's good unseparable again brother BR said my little children as Paul would have said not trying to impersonate him but the love I love you I storm the roads and everything else to get here to get to speak with you come up out of the desert across the snow drift to get here we fly in Planes you drive across the country we can get together we love one another uh someone asked me I think it was Melody asked me if brother Brandon was here and was had a meeting how far would you go to hear him preach I said well it wouldn't matter is there anybody else here like that yeah for me it wouldn't matter like that'd be my one opportunity right to hear him preach and In the Flesh and I would just go I'd drop everything and go I'd sell everything I had to sell and and I'm being honest with you yeah I'd go yeah huh I would go and so I I I would I would want that and maybe that's why God he had to leave the seen we had to become a mature bride and all over the world and be Witnesses in our own communities maybe we'd all just gathered around him but I would want to I I would drive across the country I I'd do everything I could just to honor him him being there yeah everything I could it wouldn't matter the distance right but should shouldn't we love one another yeah shouldn't this message bring more we I love the messenger but shouldn't it bring more than just a love for the messenger shouldn't it bring a love for one another yeah he said we love one another he said we're part of one another don't you never let Satan tell you anything else listen to me Church he'll try to but don't you never let Satan tell you you don't need to be together right that's what he's telling us don't you never let Satan tell you anything else being a part of one another we're part of him and we are fellow citizens of the Kingdom enjoying these blessings together of the Resurrection again he said don't take some new thing they're flying everywhere there'll be more than that come don't take these new things but the Lord God has declared to you what is truth the Lord your God has Vindicated what is Truth by his word and by his Spirit not by power not by mind but by my spirit he said God seeks those who worship Him in spirit of truth I'm hurrying now to close he said Thy word is true and he has thoroughly Vindicated that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever he has showed the evening seeds to you he's revealed it to you in the word he's proven it to you by his Spirit don't never start or try an organization don't try to build upon anything else but stay humble before the Lord your God for it looks like the gates may open into the Promised Land soon then let us go in with true singing and rejoicing when the bride and the groom takes its place at the throne live humble live loving love one another don't ever get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then Satan will do his best to get among you you let that happen some sick Tong fellow might come along try to take you away from it said but you think they could talk Moses out of the presence of God we had stood there and seen it no sir said we don't take from it or add to it just keep it the way the Lord said we don't want no denomination we don't want no organization we don't want no malice we don't want no Strife we want God how many wants God today and he is the word as I've already said what if this is what we're waiting on yeah I don't say that it's all I think all of us maybe are at a different place but as a whole what if this is it what if that next step we just step on out it may not appear like it but we've been going up cuz the bride doesn't go down we passed the review stand going up yes amen what if this is the last step yeah and we finally get it and we get it and suddenly there it is sweep comes over you and you you're you're you're predestinated to the Rapture the Rapture may be on any day it could be you washing the dishes or yelling at your kids and doing figures at the bank Could Happen anytime yes but maybe you don't even realize it but in the under the preaching under the washing of the water of the word under the message of the hour suddenly you get it yeah see part of the process of maturity and ripening is tindering yes tendering getting tender the the seed have you ever noticed that the shuck gets brittle hard divides from the grain right but the but the wheat gets more tender the more ripe it is so when it's perfectly ripe any kind of seed or any kind of any kind of uh plant any kind of fruit what do you want you want that ripe orange I like oranges I like mangoes but I don't like unripe mango mangos that they're terrible a right mango is some of one of the best things in the world but but an unra mangle terrible just awful what is it it's the same thing with god with with the word with the bride listen an unrip Bride Can can actually make God sick look at what happened to leosia he said you're lukewarm and I'll spew you out of my mouth but we want the message to bring us to ripeness and part of that is tenderizing yeah brother said Church we're teaching now but remember when you leave here start moving out of the shuck you're going into the grain but lay in the presence of the son don't add what I said don't take away what I said I speak the truth as far as I know it his father has given to me don't add to it just say what I said the thing of it is just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus is that what we want to do we don't want to present one Doctrine or another let's tell them to come seek the Lord Jesus and then you yourself lay right in his presence just make love to him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love of the world let me live holy in this present world before you can we do that this morning church Hallelujah musicians go ahead and come brother said I believe the church is beginning to hear the message begin to understand begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us proving it by the Bible is there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up and get sweet in the spirit yes so it can bathe down we love Revival we want to be in Revival we believe in the bride's Revival we can participate in all the time yes we believe in that yeah but many times when you're in an outward of Revival you know that that's joy and rejoicing and we want that but that's not what tenders you it's the heat of the word that's to go along with the moisture of the latter rain and the and the spirit of God that comes down but it's the heat of the word that brings you to that full maturity and sometimes I know and it just this thought occurs to me but I know you struggle with things and you go through things and and and you have real trouble yeah real trouble he said God why did you do this to me why why me and how many times would I look at that little baby and pray for them as I did for gab millenia's little baby Lizzy Joe and hold her in my arms and it's hard not to feel for that family as I holding her in my arms and praying for her and thinking what if that was us and dealing with that how and thinking my own babies and how we used to check make sure they were breathing and I'm I'm sitting there thinking about that that and wondering God why you know I went and prayed for her she got better it seemed like and then and then they had to go to the hospital anyway and it seemed like she had another episode this morning she was better and I thought God why why don't sometimes you just take these things away from me I believe he can do that how many believe in the Supernatural power of God but sometimes he's I think he's working on us he's working on us we get tender when we go through some things [Music] and I look back and I there was a time when I would have traded my life with just about anybody but I look back brother Daniel now and I think about what I've been through and I think I'm glad that I went through what I went through and come the path that I did and every one of you got your own story you got your own background you got your own life and someday you're going to be able to see past some clouds and be able to see that was God working all you could see was the clouds but there were angel wings beating together in the background and you look at those moments when you lost a dear loved one or something happened somebody died too young somebody got sick or you lost everything went bankrupt everything went wrong you're going to look back at that one day and you're going to say God I thank you for those moments I thank you for letting me trust you a little bit I thank you that the answer didn't come too soon because that's what made me tender that's what made me sweet so what made me love I didn't understand what people were going through until I went through some of it myself and then suddenly I I got it I'm not I'm not preaching the days of Miracles of past or anything like that I believe in miracles but sometimes God lets us tender up and just said are you going to believe me like you did to Abraham are you going to believe me are you going to believe me when your body's dead are you going to believe me no matter what happens when your wife is old are you going to believe me Abraham and Abraham said though he slay me yet I'll trust him job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him I believe Hallelujah thanks for that [Music] Buddy b said sometimes in speaking the message you get harsh there's time for that there's time we have to say things you have to break it in like that because you got to clinch a nail to make it hold but when the church wants gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes the Rapture what was it there go back and look he said only perfect love only perfect love can enter there he said whatever you do get that perfect love perfect love for God perfect love for his word perfect love for one another maybe that's what God's doing now maybe we're being perfected now maybe he's doing more than we realize right now he's working just let him work let's be humble little children as John said love one another lay in the presence of the Sun the brother brand in one place said the wheat is here the fullness of the word is here the seals have been open let's cry out in humility Lord manifest the word in my life let me be a portion of that United bride I want so badly if you just see it in my in my mind and my heart like I I've been seeing it myself I want so badly to be represented by that bride that he saw I want to be one that was walking in harmony I don't want to be one that was out of Step I want to be one that was watching the message of the hour walking in harmony with the word going up that's what I want to be every day getting better every day getting more tender every day getting more mature oh granted Lord would that be your prayer could you raise your hands with me if it is that's my prayer oh God I want to be more like you I want to I want to live for you I want to be in your presence I want to I want to come oh God in a place where I know I know you've called me to I know I'm a part of that bride I know I'm meant to be there let me mature oh God let the heat of the Sun come by and mature Me Tender me up make me ready oh god oh Lord I believe it's all of our desire Lord evidenced by a hand being raised today Lord by Hearts weeping before you we don't want to be a part of the American church we don't want to be a part of the one that's going down we don't want to be a part Lord of something that would be out of order we want to be a part of the Bride oh God we want to be right we want to walk perfectly before you I pray you'd help us today I pray you'd help the children the grandchildren the little kids the adults I pray you'd move God among our young people among our elders we want to be right we don't want to always have the answers we want to be right in our spirit oh I pray you grant it Lord oh God help us Lord where we've not been in humility help us to walk worthy of the vocation where withth we are called where we've not taken complaints help us oh God help us
