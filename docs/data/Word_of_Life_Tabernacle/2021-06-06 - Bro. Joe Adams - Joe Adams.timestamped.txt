[46:15] with god
[46:15] this evening by god's grace we'll look
[46:17] at god does the possible math part two
[46:19] but nothing impossible with you
[46:21] so i believe we as believers we have to
[46:23] realize that we serve a mighty god
[46:26] and the same word that pertained to the
[46:28] bridegroom also pertains to the bride
[46:31] so if nothing is impossible with him
[46:34] surely there's nothing impossible with
[46:35] us either so
[46:36] let us just bow for prayer father what a
[46:38] great honor and a great privilege it is
[46:40] to be back in the house of god with
[46:42] believers
[46:43] or to be here in hardy arkansas where
[46:45] brother ben and his church and
[46:47] the friends that i have here and that we
[46:49] have made over the years lord it's just
[46:50] a privilege to be back
[46:52] and i just pray this morning father
[46:53] you'll put the right words in our mouth
[46:56] hold the right words in our heart to be
[46:57] able to speak lord we've heard enough
[46:59] from man lord
[47:00] and we're not here to hear from man this
[47:02] morning but we want to hear from the son
[47:03] of man we're asking that
[47:04] lord you would overtake not only my lips
[47:06] but you'll overtake the ears of the here
[47:08] and we realized this morning father we
[47:10] have been trained and we have been
[47:11] taught
[47:12] that lord if we expect to get anything
[47:14] out of the service
[47:15] then we as the people have to pull on
[47:17] that gift of god
[47:18] and pull the presence of god to our
[47:20] situation
[47:21] pull the power and the presence of god
[47:23] to our need so lord i believe that
[47:25] you're that kind of god this morning
[47:27] i believe lord that you're the same
[47:29] yesterday today and forever
[47:31] you're very much god right now this
[47:33] morning at this very present time
[47:35] as you were 50 years ago 60 years ago
[47:38] you have not diminished in your power
[47:40] you've not diminished in your
[47:42] discernment
[47:42] you've not diminished lord in any
[47:44] authority about which you have granted
[47:45] unto man
[47:46] and we're here this morning lord to
[47:48] relinquish ourselves over to you
[47:50] and to that anointing and we ask father
[47:52] this morning that you'll take complete
[47:54] control of the service
[47:56] have preeminence in every heart and
[47:57] every life and lord just be with us as
[47:59] we just
[48:00] enter into the worship of the word this
[48:02] morning father we ask it now
[48:04] in jesus name amen if you have your
[48:06] bibles this morning we're going to look
[48:07] here in luke 18.
[48:09] gabe if you can pull a little bit of the
[48:11] highs out i'm kind of
[48:13] doing a little bit of that this morning
[48:14] if you don't mind we're going to look
[48:16] here in luke 18 and it may seem a
[48:17] strange section of scripture to come
[48:19] from
[48:20] but let's just enter in this morning
[48:21] says then a certain ruler asked him
[48:23] saying
[48:24] good master what shall i do to inherit
[48:26] eternal life
[48:28] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[48:31] meet good none is
[48:32] good save one and that is god
[48:36] thou knowest the commandments do not
[48:39] commit adultery
[48:40] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[48:42] false witness
[48:44] honor thy father and thy mother and he
[48:46] said all these have
[48:48] i done from my youth up now when jesus
[48:51] heard these things he said unto him
[48:54] yet lack us thou one thing notice he'd
[48:57] done all these other things
[48:58] but he lacked only in one area of his
[49:00] life he says sell all that thou has
[49:02] and distribute to the poor and thou
[49:04] shalt have treasure in heaven
[49:06] and come follow me and when he heard
[49:09] this he was very sorrowful
[49:11] for he was a very he was very rich and
[49:14] when jesus saw that he was very
[49:16] sorrowful he said
[49:18] how hardly shall they that have riches
[49:20] enter into the kingdom of god
[49:24] he says for it is easier for a camel to
[49:26] go through the needle's eye than for a
[49:27] rich man
[49:28] to enter into the kingdom of god and
[49:30] they that heard it said
[49:32] who then can be saved and he said these
[49:35] things which are impossible with men
[49:38] are possible with god you can have your
[49:41] seats this morning
[49:42] so our topic this morning is god does
[49:45] impossible math so when we think about
[49:48] math
[49:49] maybe some of you were math scholars
[49:51] sitting out here this morning
[49:53] uh but when we think about math many
[49:54] times we think about numbers
[49:56] we think all math you know i'm gonna
[49:58] count it by trade and we think well he
[50:00] may just
[50:01] excel in math but that's not necessarily
[50:03] the case i just happen to excel in
[50:05] accounting
[50:05] it's completely different it's a
[50:07] function of mathematics but it's not
[50:09] all the high-end math so we think about
[50:11] numbers we think about equations
[50:13] for some of you you're bored stiff when
[50:14] you think about math
[50:16] because you don't grasp the concept or
[50:18] maybe it strikes you with anxiety maybe
[50:20] you
[50:20] you're overwhelmed with stress but when
[50:23] many of us for all of us i can say when
[50:25] we think about
[50:26] math we think about problems because
[50:27] when you hear the word math
[50:29] that means somebody's got to figure out
[50:31] the problem
[50:32] in order to come to the answer that
[50:34] represents that math
[50:36] and for us we realize that our finite
[50:38] minds are limited
[50:39] to figure out many of the mathematical
[50:41] problems that we may face
[50:43] but i want you to know this morning
[50:44] there's not a problem by which god
[50:46] doesn't already
[50:47] have the answer to so you know what the
[50:50] problem may be big and it may be x
[50:52] y plus z hashtag this that and the other
[50:55] equals this
[50:56] and you're looking at it and your mind
[50:57] is blown because you can't figure it out
[50:59] or maybe some sickness in your home
[51:02] maybe some trial that you're going
[51:03] through
[51:04] and you wonder oh is there a solution is
[51:06] there an answer
[51:07] is there any way i'm going to get any
[51:09] kind of relief i want you to know this
[51:10] morning god
[51:11] does impossible math there's not an
[51:14] answer out there there's not a problem
[51:16] out there but with your god my god
[51:19] already has a solution to it but i want
[51:22] you to know sometimes it takes a little
[51:24] while
[51:24] to work out that problem to get to the
[51:27] desired result
[51:28] to get to the end result but i want you
[51:30] to know god has already figured out
[51:32] your problem god already knows about the
[51:35] solution to your situation this morning
[51:39] oh what a mighty god we serve you may be
[51:41] going through a different a difficult
[51:43] situation
[51:44] or maybe a difficult problem right now
[51:46] life may be difficult
[51:48] and you don't seem to have the answer to
[51:50] it sickness is maybe strict in your home
[51:52] hardships has inundated your life and
[51:54] you you don't know what to do maybe your
[51:56] life has been
[51:57] turned upside down your world turned
[51:59] upside down
[52:00] but i want you to know god does
[52:02] impossible math
[52:05] see you may not have the answer but it
[52:07] doesn't mean that an answer doesn't
[52:08] already exist
[52:10] just because you're not able to figure
[52:11] it out doesn't mean that there's no
[52:13] solution
[52:15] see he is the answer
[52:18] and he has the answer and maybe you're
[52:21] struggling to understand the why behind
[52:23] the problem
[52:24] but rest assured i can tell you one
[52:26] thing god has a purpose
[52:29] can we say amen to that god has a
[52:33] purpose and he's chosen you
[52:36] not only you but he's also chosen that
[52:38] problem
[52:39] in which you're going through to get to
[52:41] that desired purpose
[52:43] you say oh woe is me and woe is me but i
[52:45] want you to know god
[52:46] knows you he knows all through
[52:49] intricacies of you what makes you
[52:51] how you tick but he also has already
[52:53] designed the problem
[52:55] in order to get the best results out of
[52:57] your life so therefore god has allowed
[52:59] that problem
[53:00] to come into your life so that he can
[53:02] get that desire
[53:03] purpose and results to make you the
[53:05] believer in which he desires for you to
[53:07] be
[53:09] so god has it all figured out you know
[53:12] many years ago when i gave my heart to a
[53:13] lord i was a young 20 something year old
[53:15] college kid went through a very hard
[53:17] time in life and you know what i was
[53:19] going through it now
[53:20] i was like many of us why me god you
[53:22] know i got to the point i think many of
[53:24] you know me by now i've told the
[53:25] testimony over and over
[53:26] but i wanted to commit suicide i didn't
[53:28] want to live anymore it was really tough
[53:30] i really hit a dark moment in that time
[53:32] but now i look back on it and i see the
[53:35] mighty hand of god
[53:36] god orchestrated no the problem was too
[53:39] big
[53:39] i didn't have the answer to it but it
[53:41] didn't mean that god didn't have the
[53:43] answer to it
[53:44] it didn't mean that god didn't care it
[53:45] didn't mean that god left me to figure
[53:47] it out by myself
[53:48] he already had the solution he just had
[53:50] to use me
[53:51] to get through the problem and when we
[53:53] got through the problem it made me a
[53:55] real son
[53:56] of god and he's that same kind of god
[53:59] this morning
[54:02] so he may struggle many of us struggle
[54:05] with why
[54:07] but god hasn't you can have the
[54:08] assurance this morning
[54:10] that he is all you need he said and he
[54:13] gave a promise in his word
[54:14] i will never leave you how many
[54:18] has he left you this morning
[54:21] we don't have anybody that he's left
[54:24] well you need to turn around and tell
[54:25] the devil
[54:26] he's not left me and he ain't going to
[54:28] leave me so you might as well quit you
[54:30] might as well give up
[54:31] how many is the devil told you nobody
[54:33] loves you
[54:35] we ain't got one or two of y'all that's
[54:36] in church this morning with me
[54:38] now the devil comes and tells you nobody
[54:40] loves you nobody cares about you
[54:42] but let me just tell you you need to put
[54:44] that back on him nobody loves you devil
[54:46] nobody cares about you devil we're not
[54:49] here this morning to listen to you devil
[54:50] we come to hear from god we come here
[54:53] from the almighty we come to get the
[54:55] solution
[54:56] to the problem and which is bigger than
[54:57] us that we can't see the end but it
[54:59] doesn't mean
[55:00] that there's not an end it doesn't mean
[55:02] that we're going to be defeated
[55:03] it means that god is going to use you
[55:05] this morning and that problem
[55:07] that trial that sickness that situation
[55:10] to bring the best out of your life
[55:14] we have a promise he'll never leave us
[55:17] hebrews 13
[55:18] 5 says i will never leave thee nor
[55:20] forsake thee
[55:23] matthew 28 and verse 20 i am with you
[55:26] alway
[55:27] even unto the end of the world john 14
[55:30] 17
[55:31] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[55:34] you
[55:36] and in romans 8 and verse 28 we all are
[55:39] aware of this and we're all very
[55:40] familiar scripture
[55:41] and we know that all things work
[55:43] together
[55:44] for the good to them that love god to
[55:46] them who are they called according to
[55:49] his purpose
[55:51] you say brother are you sure about that
[55:54] because you don't understand what i'm
[55:55] going through right now you don't
[55:57] understand my situation
[55:58] how in the world can this work out for
[56:00] my good look what it's done to me look
[56:02] what it's done to my family
[56:03] look at the struggle that i'm in but no
[56:04] matter what you're dealing with at this
[56:06] time
[56:07] no matter what you're going through
[56:08] right now the word is the word
[56:10] and god can't tell a lie god can't be
[56:13] defeated he said that all things work
[56:15] together and no matter what you're going
[56:17] through
[56:18] no matter how you feel this morning no
[56:20] matter how dark the situation may be
[56:22] it's working toward your good gotta take
[56:24] that situation
[56:25] and turn it around and make sure that
[56:28] it's gonna bless you
[56:29] and enjoy it and lift you up into
[56:31] heavenly places
[56:34] all things work together now know this
[56:38] that they're not enjoyable
[56:41] you don't hit a trial and just jump up
[56:42] and shout praise god i'm going through
[56:44] it
[56:46] no we call you an imbecile that's how we
[56:48] say in louisiana
[56:51] you're a nobody signs up for it
[56:54] right
[56:56] maybe y'all do in arkansas but we don't
[56:58] know louisiana
[57:01] but see god is working it for your good
[57:06] so you may be facing what appears an
[57:09] impossible situation
[57:11] and perhaps you feel completely trapped
[57:13] hedged and overwhelmed
[57:14] with no solution in sight maybe you're
[57:18] confronted with a challenge where
[57:19] there's no resolution
[57:20] and sometimes your heart is heavy with
[57:22] worry and fear and anxiety and
[57:24] depression and
[57:26] all these other things and it seems like
[57:28] there's nowhere
[57:29] to turn every time you turn it's another
[57:32] situation or
[57:33] it's another uh oppression or something
[57:35] of that nature
[57:36] maybe you're on an emotional roller
[57:38] coaster one minute you're up and seems
[57:40] to be going good
[57:40] all of a sudden you just dip down into
[57:42] the valley of despair and it seems like
[57:44] god has
[57:44] left you but god has never left you
[57:47] alone
[57:49] so no matter how the impossibilities
[57:53] no matter what you're facing on this
[57:55] side of eternity
[57:56] i want you to rest assured god has your
[57:59] best
[57:59] interest at heart you are the apple of
[58:02] his
[58:02] eye he's not going to put too much on
[58:05] you this morning
[58:06] in which you can't bear but notice he's
[58:09] the one that's with you always
[58:11] so impossibilities are the platforms
[58:14] upon which god
[58:15] does his best work if life was easy
[58:19] life would be easy we wouldn't have need
[58:22] of a god now would we
[58:24] but when life tightens up a little bit
[58:25] things get a little bit tough on us
[58:28] the pressures get a little bit tough
[58:29] maybe the doctor's report said we only
[58:31] have a few months to live
[58:33] that's when you got to trust in the god
[58:35] that does impossible math
[58:37] how many of you know sister dottie brown
[58:38] she's brother nathan bryant's mother
[58:40] this time last year during covert the
[58:42] doctors she went to the hospital and
[58:43] they found that she had cancer
[58:44] throughout her whole lymph system
[58:46] and they gave her two months to live
[58:49] church's brother nate just sent out
[58:50] prayer requests and we begin to pray and
[58:52] many other believers begin to pray
[58:54] and look we just came from there last
[58:56] weekend held a series of meetings for
[58:58] for brother nathan's church me and
[58:59] brother aaron and brother timothy
[59:01] and and god god begin to call her out in
[59:04] every service god spoke to her
[59:06] and they gave her two months to live and
[59:08] she showed up in every service
[59:10] and she testified on every service that
[59:11] he's been so good to me no matter the
[59:14] cancer through my body
[59:15] no matter what i've gone through i got
[59:17] so much to thank god for
[59:19] she embraced that challenge she embraced
[59:21] that struggle
[59:22] and said know what my god is bigger than
[59:24] this cancer
[59:26] and she just went back to the hospital
[59:28] just the other day for a scan i believe
[59:30] and they only found a little speck of it
[59:32] left
[59:33] i'm going to tell you church not even
[59:35] cancer can stand before our god
[59:38] and if cancer can't stand before no
[59:40] matter what you're going through this
[59:41] morning
[59:41] it can't stand before our god it can't
[59:44] take you down
[59:45] god has your best interests at heart
[59:49] so with man these things may be
[59:50] impossible but with god
[59:52] all things are possible you know wise
[59:56] man once said he said most of our
[59:57] blessings are hidden
[59:59] in a little envelope titled impossible
[1:00:01] situations
[1:00:03] nobody likes to receive that envelope
[1:00:06] you want that one that has a check in it
[1:00:09] a stimulus here and a stimulus there and
[1:00:12] you want that kind of envelope we don't
[1:00:15] sign up
[1:00:17] to try to get those impossible situation
[1:00:19] envelopes
[1:00:20] okay let me open this up and find out
[1:00:22] what my ordeal is today
[1:00:24] some grab bag but no but when god wants
[1:00:26] to do a miracle he usually puts you in a
[1:00:28] difficult situation
[1:00:30] and when god wants to do an even bigger
[1:00:32] miracle he puts you in an impossible
[1:00:34] situation
[1:00:37] therefore if you're in a situation this
[1:00:39] morning
[1:00:40] and you can't see the seem to see
[1:00:42] anything any way out
[1:00:43] you don't feel anything it seems like
[1:00:44] god's a million miles away
[1:00:46] that doesn't mean that he's a million
[1:00:47] miles away that doesn't mean that god is
[1:00:49] not behind the scenes
[1:00:51] working everything toward your good what
[1:00:54] that means is for you as the believer
[1:00:56] when you don't see god move you don't
[1:00:58] hear from god and you don't feel god
[1:01:00] that's the moment you need to be
[1:01:01] expecting any minute god is about to
[1:01:04] move
[1:01:04] on my situation because we had a word in
[1:01:07] ephesians 3 it says now to him he is
[1:01:10] able to do exceeding and abundantly
[1:01:12] above
[1:01:12] all that we can ask or even think god
[1:01:15] knows your thoughts
[1:01:16] god knows the situation and god has
[1:01:18] already provided an answer
[1:01:19] and that answer is bigger than anything
[1:01:21] you can fathom in your mind
[1:01:23] it's greater than anything that you can
[1:01:25] fathom in your mind
[1:01:31] notice now for it is easier for a camel
[1:01:35] to go through the eye of a needle that
[1:01:38] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[1:01:40] of god
[1:01:42] thankfully many of us are not rich
[1:01:45] at least we're not back in louisiana
[1:01:47] some of y'all may be rich
[1:01:49] the million millionaire next door and
[1:01:51] that's fine
[1:01:52] what we find here when we think about an
[1:01:54] iv needle before i got saved and we
[1:01:56] heard this scripture as a kid growing up
[1:01:58] i think you know i'm thinking of a
[1:02:00] needle right sowing needle
[1:02:02] there ain't no way there ain't no way
[1:02:05] that that camel
[1:02:06] is going to fit through that little
[1:02:07] bitty eye of a needle but what that word
[1:02:09] needle there represents it actually is a
[1:02:11] gate in jerusalem
[1:02:13] which opens after the main gate is
[1:02:15] closed at night
[1:02:16] in order for the camel to pass through
[1:02:18] the eye of the needle
[1:02:20] to get through the second gate and enter
[1:02:21] into jerusalem
[1:02:23] that camel not only had to pass through
[1:02:25] the first gate
[1:02:26] but he also had to unload stoop down and
[1:02:29] unload everything that it had on it
[1:02:31] and then it had to squabble through on
[1:02:32] its knees to get through
[1:02:34] that needle and the prophet of god will
[1:02:37] tell us
[1:02:39] as he would say and forsaken all he says
[1:02:41] and the question lays before every one
[1:02:42] of us
[1:02:43] and jesus really asked this rich young
[1:02:46] ruler
[1:02:46] to forsake all that he had to take up
[1:02:48] his cross and follow him
[1:02:50] and we know the story and he went away
[1:02:52] sorrowful
[1:02:53] because he had great riches
[1:02:57] you know he had a lot of money and he
[1:02:59] didn't want to give up his money because
[1:03:00] with his money came fame came popularity
[1:03:03] came a lot of nice things material
[1:03:05] things and he wasn't willing to give
[1:03:07] those things up
[1:03:08] and notice he walked up into the face
[1:03:13] of eternal life and turned away
[1:03:18] turned away he had his opportunity he
[1:03:20] rejected the opportunity to follow jesus
[1:03:23] when he laid it down to him pretty
[1:03:25] strict and the prophet of god will tell
[1:03:27] us and we want to hold on to everything
[1:03:29] that
[1:03:30] we can and then follow jesus but
[1:03:33] sometimes jesus wants us to turn
[1:03:35] loose of everything so that we get both
[1:03:38] hands on
[1:03:39] him you know today we may not be rich
[1:03:43] with money
[1:03:44] we may not have nice house nights cars
[1:03:46] things i like
[1:03:47] of those sorts of things but some of you
[1:03:50] you've accumulated so much complexes
[1:03:54] oh you're rich in the wrong thing some
[1:03:57] of you got so much
[1:03:58] depression that you're rich in
[1:04:00] depression you're rich in your anxieties
[1:04:02] you're rich in your fears
[1:04:04] you're rich in all these things and i
[1:04:06] wonder tonight what could happen in this
[1:04:08] service this morning
[1:04:09] if we can take our eyes off of what we
[1:04:11] see take our eyes off of how we feel
[1:04:14] take our eyes off the situation take our
[1:04:16] eyes off the trial that we're in
[1:04:18] take our eyes off the impossibilities
[1:04:20] that lay in our humanity
[1:04:21] all the disappointments that we've
[1:04:23] encountered and it can unload
[1:04:25] in this morning unpack these things
[1:04:27] unload the depression
[1:04:28] and let go of the fear let go of the
[1:04:30] anxiety what kind of service can we have
[1:04:32] this morning
[1:04:33] talk about a god that does the
[1:04:35] impossible talk about going in
[1:04:37] to that inner gate and enjoying the joys
[1:04:39] of the lord oh church what you got to do
[1:04:41] this morning
[1:04:42] is unpack those things give those things
[1:04:44] to jesus this morning
[1:04:45] let jesus take that bird let jesus lift
[1:04:48] that off of you this morning
[1:04:52] we got to be like that camel we got to
[1:04:54] unpack these things
[1:04:57] and when we unpack these things
[1:05:00] unpack all the guilt from past failures
[1:05:04] unpack all that unforgiveness to those
[1:05:06] that hurt you
[1:05:08] you know we're christians and we we are
[1:05:10] but we're still human
[1:05:12] and as humans sometimes we harbor these
[1:05:15] little feelings
[1:05:17] somebody hurt you 15 20 years ago you've
[1:05:20] not let that thing go yet
[1:05:24] and yet you're saying i'm going to make
[1:05:25] it i'm ready for a rapture
[1:05:30] oh you ready for a rapture but you can't
[1:05:33] let go of that
[1:05:35] but god let go of so much that was on
[1:05:37] your life
[1:05:38] he forgave you so much that it was
[1:05:40] holding over you
[1:05:42] so that you can enjoy the blessings of
[1:05:44] him and yet you want to host something
[1:05:45] over somebody
[1:05:46] else oh you're rich with unforgiveness
[1:05:50] all the complexes you know many of us
[1:05:53] family strains run down through families
[1:05:57] generational curses work their way down
[1:05:59] through children
[1:06:00] but i want you to know generational
[1:06:03] curses
[1:06:04] they may have ran into your family until
[1:06:07] it ran into you
[1:06:09] and when it ran into you it stopped
[1:06:12] because you serve a mighty god
[1:06:16] many of you may know my brother-in-law
[1:06:17] was killed last month in a car accident
[1:06:20] but previous two months before that he
[1:06:22] had made contact or
[1:06:24] he had a son that we didn't know about
[1:06:27] he's a 20 year old kid at the time he
[1:06:28] was 19 and he made contact with nathan
[1:06:31] and so he made contact he wanted to meet
[1:06:34] him
[1:06:34] so they met in pensacola florida and so
[1:06:36] they got to meet each other
[1:06:38] and so the son this son who turned 20
[1:06:41] while he was at our place
[1:06:42] he came up for the funeral and he didn't
[1:06:45] know anything about our family we didn't
[1:06:46] know anything about him
[1:06:47] but he was a spitting image to my
[1:06:49] brother-in-law
[1:06:50] when i say a spitting image i'm talking
[1:06:52] about in looks i'm talking about the
[1:06:54] mannerisms i'm talking about the way he
[1:06:55] pronounced his words the way his mouth
[1:06:57] moved does everything that he was he's
[1:07:00] in the navy my brother all went to the
[1:07:01] navy academy
[1:07:02] all these things and you wonder how can
[1:07:05] these things be
[1:07:06] when they he he my brother-in-law had no
[1:07:09] influence on this child's life
[1:07:11] but the generational strains work really
[1:07:14] deep
[1:07:14] and they really ingrained and this kid
[1:07:16] did everything like his biological
[1:07:18] father
[1:07:19] but i'm going to tell you this morning
[1:07:20] if that's the case in the natural
[1:07:22] what about the case in the supernatural
[1:07:25] when that dna comes down inside of you
[1:07:27] let me tell you we should represent the
[1:07:29] king of kings
[1:07:30] and the lord of lords and all these
[1:07:32] generational curses that our
[1:07:33] earthly father and our parents want to
[1:07:35] put on us it's got to come to an end
[1:07:37] that cycle's got to be broken and i'm
[1:07:39] looking at cycle breakers this morning
[1:07:41] it may be too big for you but it ain't
[1:07:44] too big for our god
[1:07:49] it may be too much for us the grudges
[1:07:52] the doubts the unbelief all the fears
[1:07:53] and anxieties
[1:07:54] it may be too much for us so won't you
[1:07:57] just unload it this morning
[1:07:59] won't you give it to jesus this morning
[1:08:02] say jesus this is too much for me
[1:08:04] you're the one that does the
[1:08:05] impossibilities now work this in my
[1:08:08] favor
[1:08:10] so they asked a question because
[1:08:13] straight as the gate and narrow is the
[1:08:14] way
[1:08:15] and his disciples says well who can be
[1:08:17] saved
[1:08:18] so you know what the rich man does why
[1:08:21] it's so hard for a rich man
[1:08:23] to enter into that gate because a rich
[1:08:26] man depends
[1:08:27] on his own ability the rich man trusts
[1:08:30] in his own knowledge
[1:08:31] he's putting his trust in things that he
[1:08:33] can have an influence over
[1:08:35] or he can have an effect on and he's not
[1:08:37] trusting in god
[1:08:39] but i want you know this morning you
[1:08:41] can't buy your way to heaven
[1:08:43] you can't think your way to heaven
[1:08:45] there's only one way and jesus is that
[1:08:47] way
[1:08:48] he is the way the truth and the life he
[1:08:50] is the gate and you got to unload
[1:08:52] all your worldly concerns as the prophet
[1:08:55] of god saying you got to throw down that
[1:08:56] whirly bag of peanuts
[1:08:58] and get on the train because the train
[1:09:00] is in the blocks the train is about to
[1:09:02] leave
[1:09:02] let me tell you if there's ever been a
[1:09:04] time that we as a people should be ready
[1:09:06] for the coming of the lord
[1:09:07] that time is now when we see what the
[1:09:09] world is doing
[1:09:10] we see what the world is becoming we're
[1:09:12] in the middle of pride month
[1:09:14] oh the homosexual agenda solomon gemara
[1:09:17] is right here but i want you to know
[1:09:19] this morning we are in the middle of a
[1:09:20] pride month i'm proud to be a christian
[1:09:22] i'm proud to be a believer i'm proud to
[1:09:24] have the holy ghost i'm proud to be
[1:09:26] saved i'm proud to rely on that god that
[1:09:29] does the impos
[1:09:30] i'm proud of who my father is
[1:09:34] they want their rainbow we got a
[1:09:35] covenant i'll never leave you
[1:09:37] i'll never forsake you i'll be with even
[1:09:40] in you to the end of the world
[1:09:45] oh hallelujah for it is easier for a
[1:09:49] camel to go through eye of a needle
[1:09:51] therefore a rich man to enter the
[1:09:53] kingdom of god
[1:09:56] and when the disciples heard it they
[1:09:58] were exceedingly amazed saying
[1:10:01] who then can be saved i believe i may
[1:10:03] have said this many years ago when i was
[1:10:05] here
[1:10:06] when i first came to this message 20
[1:10:07] something years ago
[1:10:09] i didn't know i didn't grow up in a
[1:10:11] christian home i didn't know about the
[1:10:12] bible i didn't know these things
[1:10:13] and they talked about the fruits of the
[1:10:16] spirit
[1:10:17] i'm like oh my i got a fruitless tree i
[1:10:20] don't possess this
[1:10:21] this i got a temper i got this i got
[1:10:23] this man i got the wrong tree
[1:10:26] and i thought about these things but you
[1:10:27] know the longer i went the longer i
[1:10:30] stayed the longer i just
[1:10:31] i studied and fed on the word and then
[1:10:34] finally got received the baptism of the
[1:10:35] holy ghost
[1:10:36] then you realize these things start
[1:10:38] grafting into your life
[1:10:40] then you begin to push out because
[1:10:41] you're drinking in of this message and
[1:10:43] this message produces
[1:10:45] the fruits of the spirit so i was all
[1:10:47] worried about what i could do
[1:10:49] how i was going to do this how i was
[1:10:51] going to do that i was like that rich
[1:10:53] man depending on my own ability
[1:10:55] but god doesn't want your human ability
[1:10:57] god wants your human availability
[1:11:00] he wants you to be available to the call
[1:11:02] he wants you to be available to the sick
[1:11:03] he wants you to be available whenever he
[1:11:05] wants you to do something
[1:11:06] to the word he wants you to be available
[1:11:08] to him because i'm here to tell you when
[1:11:10] you look at situations
[1:11:11] sometimes your mind can't grasp the
[1:11:14] solution to the problem
[1:11:17] and you're like these disciples
[1:11:20] well then who can be saved
[1:11:23] but jesus beheld them and he said unto
[1:11:25] them with men this is impossible
[1:11:28] but with god all things are possible
[1:11:32] that word all is a small word right
[1:11:36] but it encompasses everything that
[1:11:38] you'll ever face
[1:11:39] on this side of eternity you name a
[1:11:41] problem you name a situation
[1:11:43] you name a sickness whatever it is all
[1:11:45] things are possible
[1:11:47] there's nothing that's not impossible or
[1:11:50] that's not possible with god
[1:11:52] so this word impossible here means not
[1:11:54] possible isn't that profound
[1:11:56] impossible means not possible it also
[1:11:59] means
[1:11:59] unable to be or to exist to happen
[1:12:03] unable to be done unable to be performed
[1:12:06] i'm able to be effective incapable of
[1:12:08] being true
[1:12:10] not to be done not to be endured utterly
[1:12:12] impractical
[1:12:13] and hopelessly unsuitable so what's
[1:12:17] impossible with us can't be true
[1:12:20] can't be endure can't be performed can
[1:12:22] be affected
[1:12:24] not suitable it's not the case with the
[1:12:26] god we serve
[1:12:29] so the hardest situations may seem to
[1:12:31] overwhelm us
[1:12:32] may consume our thoughts may keep you up
[1:12:34] at night
[1:12:35] how many of you've ever stressed tonight
[1:12:36] and you just toss and turn
[1:12:38] and you sweat and you strike got some
[1:12:40] honest christians here this morning
[1:12:41] thank god
[1:12:43] because we've all been there i mean we
[1:12:45] we were and we stress and we fret
[1:12:47] why when god's got it all in control
[1:12:52] it's bigger than you but it's not bigger
[1:12:53] than the god we serve
[1:12:56] we find here in mark 9 and verse 17 and
[1:12:59] one of the multitude answer and said
[1:13:01] unto
[1:13:02] said master i have brought unto thee my
[1:13:04] son which has
[1:13:06] a dumb spirit and whosoever he taketh
[1:13:10] him
[1:13:10] he teareth him and he followeth and he
[1:13:12] gnashes with teeth and he pileth away
[1:13:14] and i speak to thy disciples that they
[1:13:17] should cast him out
[1:13:18] and they could not see notice some
[1:13:21] things are not even possible
[1:13:24] with believers
[1:13:27] they could not cast him out and answered
[1:13:28] him saying oh faithless generation how
[1:13:30] long
[1:13:31] shall i be with you how long shall i
[1:13:34] suffer you
[1:13:35] bring him unto me and they brought him
[1:13:38] unto him and when he saw him straightway
[1:13:40] the spirit tear him
[1:13:41] and he fell on the ground and wallowed
[1:13:43] foaming now i don't know about you but
[1:13:45] if how many of you ever seen a spirit be
[1:13:47] cast out of a person
[1:13:49] first thing that spirit does and the
[1:13:51] prophet of god will say it when it knows
[1:13:53] that it's about to be cast out there
[1:13:54] comes a change over that person
[1:13:57] now i've been a lot of prayer lines i've
[1:13:59] i wouldn't say fortunate but
[1:14:00] i have had situations where we prayed
[1:14:03] and we've laid hands on them and we cast
[1:14:04] out devils
[1:14:05] and you find a lot of times first
[1:14:07] reaction is they pull back
[1:14:09] sometimes they growl sometimes they do
[1:14:10] this sometimes they do that
[1:14:12] just here at our easter meetings we had
[1:14:14] two in a service
[1:14:15] me and brother danny steeman was dealing
[1:14:17] with one young girl and
[1:14:18] she hit the ground when she raised up
[1:14:20] real quick she said leave me alone
[1:14:23] i said not today you're coming out
[1:14:26] because we got a commission now it may
[1:14:28] not be possible with your denominations
[1:14:30] it may not be possible with the bad news
[1:14:32] they may run from him they may run the
[1:14:34] the catholics may run from it but i'm
[1:14:36] going to tell you when you know your
[1:14:37] position in the body
[1:14:39] and god is giving you the covenant and
[1:14:41] god has commissioned you
[1:14:42] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:14:44] recover
[1:14:45] you in my name can cast out devils let
[1:14:47] me tell you you go forth into battle
[1:14:49] knowing that the god that you serve is
[1:14:51] greater than the demon that's attacking
[1:14:53] that person
[1:14:53] and that little girl will receive her
[1:14:55] deliverance that day
[1:14:57] and she got up and she was completely
[1:14:59] different
[1:15:00] and we had another young girl coming to
[1:15:02] line and she had a suicidal spirit
[1:15:05] and she showed up in oklahoma camp and
[1:15:06] it didn't get dealt with but
[1:15:08] i deserved it in oklahoma camp and i
[1:15:09] told brother timothy because he had come
[1:15:11] out and he said look there's
[1:15:13] i feel like there is a spirit of suicide
[1:15:15] here and it's heavy on my heart
[1:15:16] so when this young girl came into the
[1:15:18] line i looked re i
[1:15:20] spoke in his ear said this young girl's
[1:15:21] got a suicidal spirit i don't know i
[1:15:23] didn't know her i
[1:15:24] don't even know whose church she went to
[1:15:25] at the time
[1:15:27] but it didn't get dealt with in oklahoma
[1:15:30] she came to our easter meetings and she
[1:15:33] came up in the prayer line
[1:15:35] she began to tell me and brother aaron
[1:15:36] what what happened to her and how she's
[1:15:38] feeling
[1:15:38] and what she's going through and she
[1:15:40] wants to be free of this thing let me
[1:15:41] tell you we begin to pray
[1:15:44] not only did we begin to pray we begin
[1:15:46] to cast that thing out
[1:15:49] that young girl fell down hit her head
[1:15:51] against the
[1:15:52] the pew there because see that's what
[1:15:54] satan does
[1:15:55] he's trying to kill steal and destroy no
[1:15:58] matter what and here
[1:15:59] we find in this story here this young
[1:16:01] man foameth at the mouth
[1:16:02] he throws him in the fire throws him in
[1:16:04] the water he's doing everything it can
[1:16:06] to to destroy the host that is living
[1:16:08] him before it's cast out
[1:16:10] but that young girl came into a prayer
[1:16:12] line one way but i want you to know this
[1:16:14] morning
[1:16:15] she left free she left the liver that
[1:16:17] suicidal spirit left
[1:16:19] why because god not man but god does the
[1:16:22] impossible
[1:16:23] she was looking for a solution and god
[1:16:25] had the answer
[1:16:26] in a prayer line in an easter service
[1:16:28] and he's the same god this morning
[1:16:30] and he's here this morning for your need
[1:16:33] he's as very much god as he was and
[1:16:35] william branham as he is in the fivefold
[1:16:37] ministry today
[1:16:38] he's still god he still heals he's still
[1:16:41] saved
[1:16:41] he still feels with the holy ghost and
[1:16:43] he still cast out devils
[1:16:45] because he's still god and he does the
[1:16:48] impossible
[1:16:51] now notice jesus said
[1:16:55] of times he's cast him into the fire
[1:16:56] into the waters to destroy him
[1:16:59] but if thou canst do anything have
[1:17:01] compassion on us and help us
[1:17:05] and jesus said unto
[1:17:08] excuse me i got these t-rex arms i can't
[1:17:10] even get my jacket off
[1:17:14] y'all didn't know y'all had a dinosaur
[1:17:15] preacher up here did you
[1:17:17] well there it is hallelujah
[1:17:21] jesus said unto him if thou cast believe
[1:17:25] all things are possible to him that
[1:17:28] believeth and straightway the father the
[1:17:29] child cried out
[1:17:30] and he said with tears lord i believe
[1:17:33] but help thou my unbelief
[1:17:35] and that's we find ourselves there many
[1:17:37] of us we believe but then there's that
[1:17:39] slight unbelief
[1:17:40] that tries to come in and keep the
[1:17:43] promise away from
[1:17:44] him keep it at bay but i want to say
[1:17:46] this morning like
[1:17:47] like they did this his father did lord
[1:17:49] we believe
[1:17:50] we believe but help down my unbelief
[1:17:52] help us this morning to allow our faith
[1:17:54] to rise up
[1:17:55] to realize that there's no
[1:17:56] impossibilities with you
[1:17:58] and god jesus said if thou canst believe
[1:18:02] all things are possible
[1:18:03] so the case may seem impossible for the
[1:18:05] disciples it may seem impossible for you
[1:18:08] this morning
[1:18:09] but if you can put your trust anchor it
[1:18:11] in god this morning
[1:18:12] nothing is impossible for them that
[1:18:13] believe in the message moses he said
[1:18:16] divine healing died out a while
[1:18:18] here a few years ago this is in 1950 it
[1:18:21] just let down
[1:18:22] as it happens through the age of history
[1:18:24] it's let down so often and during that
[1:18:26] time cancer broke out sickness in the
[1:18:28] church
[1:18:28] eighty percent of the people are sick
[1:18:30] now we got the best hospitals we've ever
[1:18:32] had
[1:18:32] how he says we've got the best drugs
[1:18:34] we've ever practiced with haven't we
[1:18:36] we got more sickness than we ever had
[1:18:37] haven't we because we got more on belief
[1:18:39] than we ever had
[1:18:40] we had he goes haven't we said that's
[1:18:42] right exactly only
[1:18:44] god's the healer that's right right in
[1:18:46] the days when he's got all these fine
[1:18:48] drugs and operations insurgents
[1:18:50] and so forth excuse me constantly they
[1:18:52] are building infirmities
[1:18:54] for the incurable is that right he goes
[1:18:56] and there's never
[1:18:57] was nothing that ever came before our
[1:18:59] master
[1:19:00] jesus but what he was more than a match
[1:19:03] for
[1:19:04] oh you say brother joe that lays on the
[1:19:06] side of healing i'm telling you there's
[1:19:07] nothing
[1:19:08] that ever came before our master whether
[1:19:10] it be healing whether it be deliverance
[1:19:12] whether it be a situation
[1:19:13] that our god is not more than a match
[1:19:15] for so whatever you're going through
[1:19:17] this morning your god
[1:19:18] is more than a match for what you're
[1:19:19] dealing with
[1:19:23] he says and no incurables to him
[1:19:28] all things are possible is that right
[1:19:30] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:32] forever is that right
[1:19:34] then nothing is too incurable for him
[1:19:38] there's no situation that's incurable
[1:19:40] with him
[1:19:41] there's no person too far gone that's
[1:19:44] incurable for him
[1:19:45] there's no marriages that's so messed up
[1:19:48] that's not
[1:19:49] incurable with him there's nothing
[1:19:54] i like how the prophet of god said he
[1:19:56] says i never seen god go into battle
[1:19:58] but what he didn't come out packing the
[1:20:01] victory
[1:20:02] what does that tell you as a believer
[1:20:05] god can't lose
[1:20:06] and if you're in god you can't lose
[1:20:09] did you hear what i said god can't lose
[1:20:12] he's never lost a battle
[1:20:13] he's never lost a son he's never lost a
[1:20:15] sheep he's never and he can't lose you
[1:20:17] this morning so
[1:20:18] what does that tell you church you can't
[1:20:20] lose you and god are majority this
[1:20:22] morning you're undefeatable this morning
[1:20:24] you're the mighty voice of a living god
[1:20:26] you're the final voice to the final age
[1:20:28] and it's time that voice
[1:20:30] shuts the mouth of the devil and say my
[1:20:32] god is able
[1:20:33] my god is greater my god is bigger than
[1:20:35] anything that i face
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:39] shut the mouth of the enemy notice now
[1:20:43] and don't you think it's just as
[1:20:45] possible for god to send down
[1:20:46] deliverance
[1:20:47] for the sick people as he did to bring
[1:20:50] out them in bondage back in the days of
[1:20:51] egypt
[1:20:54] isn't he just as kind-hearted to your
[1:20:56] cry
[1:20:58] listen to your crowd the same as he did
[1:21:00] theirs he promised in the last days
[1:21:03] that he would have a church
[1:21:06] he promised he would have a church
[1:21:09] notice not a church scarred up not a
[1:21:12] church marred up
[1:21:14] not a church wrinkled up but a church
[1:21:16] spotless
[1:21:18] a church that's wrinkle-free she's not
[1:21:20] laid down in the bed of fornication with
[1:21:22] the world
[1:21:24] no but she's without blemish he's
[1:21:26] promised that if god
[1:21:28] gave that promise then god is duty bound
[1:21:31] to keep that word
[1:21:34] all that you have to do as a believer is
[1:21:36] unload
[1:21:38] unpack all that stuff that satan's
[1:21:40] trying to pack on you
[1:21:41] the bible would tell us that god daily
[1:21:43] loadeth us with benefits
[1:21:45] there's benefits this morning with being
[1:21:47] a believer
[1:21:48] many times we don't accept those
[1:21:50] benefits we take all the negativity that
[1:21:53] the devil wants to throw on us
[1:21:54] well we know you heard it the devil's
[1:21:56] been talking to me
[1:21:58] then why are you listening he's in my
[1:22:01] ear he's telling me this he's telling me
[1:22:03] that

[1:22:10] now you're sons of god not we'll be in
[1:22:12] the millennium you are now
[1:22:14] and if you are a son of god now then you
[1:22:16] got more power you got more authority
[1:22:18] you got more dominion over anything that
[1:22:20] you face
[1:22:20] on this side because you serve a living
[1:22:23] god a god that can't be defeated a god
[1:22:26] that can't lose and if god can't be
[1:22:28] defeated and he can't lose
[1:22:29] you can't either church recognize your
[1:22:32] position
[1:22:32] recognize your authority recognize the
[1:22:35] anointing by which you're under this
[1:22:36] board
[1:22:36] and stand toe-to-toe with that devil and
[1:22:39] say my god's able
[1:22:41] we're not gonna bow
[1:22:44] i don't know what he's got plans for hey

[1:23:06] god is able he's able
[1:23:11] oh i just believe he will because he
[1:23:14] does the impossible
[1:23:18] notice he promised in the last days that
[1:23:20] he would have a church
[1:23:22] these signs would follow them isn't that
[1:23:25] right well
[1:23:25] don't you think the last days are here
[1:23:30] don't you think that come on church how
[1:23:32] many y'all got a mouth this morning
[1:23:34] so y'all know y'all afraid to talk

[1:23:42] you ain't gonna scare me out of the
[1:23:43] pulpit by shouting it's all right i like
[1:23:45] a good heart
[1:23:46] amen to the word come on get behind it
[1:23:49] this morning pull from the gift of god
[1:23:50] what you have need of
[1:23:52] it says isn't it time now for these
[1:23:54] things to happen
[1:23:56] so if we believe that we're in the last
[1:23:57] days then shouldn't we be looking for
[1:23:59] god to perform his word
[1:24:02] if we believe that we're in the last day
[1:24:03] shouldn't we expect signs and wonders
[1:24:05] to follow the ministry shouldn't we
[1:24:08] believe to follow those that believe
[1:24:09] if we're in the last days shouldn't we
[1:24:11] believe shouldn't we be expecting
[1:24:13] a god to do the impossible shouldn't we
[1:24:15] be expecting
[1:24:16] another great expectation for god to
[1:24:19] work miracles in our lives
[1:24:21] oh we sing that song he's a waymaker
[1:24:23] he's a miracle worker is it let me tell
[1:24:25] you it's got to be more than a soul
[1:24:27] it's got to be a revelation my god is a
[1:24:29] wave maker
[1:24:30] when i don't see a way through this
[1:24:32] storm when i don't swing away
[1:24:34] through my trout god's already made a
[1:24:36] way let me tell you he'll split the red
[1:24:38] seas for you
[1:24:39] he'll open up the line still god is a
[1:24:41] wave maker and a miracle worker this
[1:24:43] morning
[1:24:44] there's nothing too big that our god
[1:24:46] can't move
[1:24:54] listen what he says here the doctor is
[1:24:58] working
[1:24:59] on the line of scientific now i know i'm
[1:25:02] dealing with
[1:25:03] healing but i want you to apply this
[1:25:05] healing to any situation
[1:25:07] because if he's a divine healer he's a
[1:25:09] divine savior
[1:25:11] and if he's a divine savior he can cast
[1:25:13] out devils he can heal the sick
[1:25:15] he can change any situation he can
[1:25:17] change any storm
[1:25:19] so he says now the doctor is working on
[1:25:21] on the line of scientific
[1:25:24] the doctor has done everything he can to
[1:25:27] save the person's life
[1:25:29] and it can't be saved because there's
[1:25:30] nothing else he knows to do
[1:25:33] he's at the end of his wits the man is
[1:25:36] honest
[1:25:36] but now the tree of knowledge is all
[1:25:39] right
[1:25:40] but when you go so far as it'll go
[1:25:43] then step off onto the tree of life and
[1:25:46] just keep going
[1:25:49] sister dottie got an ugly doctor's
[1:25:51] report you got two months
[1:25:53] she stepped off that tree of knowledge
[1:25:55] said i'm gonna believe in a god it does
[1:25:57] impossible
[1:25:58] she's still living today 70 80 years old
[1:26:02] somewhere like that she's not a spring
[1:26:03] chicken
[1:26:05] but she's believing in a living god got
[1:26:08] up at the end of our services
[1:26:10] after she had sat through three services
[1:26:12] and we're not talking a 30-minute little
[1:26:14] dissertation or some sermonette by some
[1:26:16] preacher we talk about anointed services
[1:26:19] and she got up at the end said i want to
[1:26:20] give a testimony
[1:26:22] and she ain't saying if i'm not mistaken
[1:26:24] she hasn't sang since she's gotten
[1:26:25] cancer
[1:26:26] and recovered this is her first time and
[1:26:27] she gets up and grabs them like
[1:26:29] all feeble at first i got
[1:26:32] so much oh but then that anointing here
[1:26:35] to thank him for
[1:26:37] so much to praise him for and just begin
[1:26:40] to change the atmosphere in that church
[1:26:43] oh people were on their feet rejoicing
[1:26:45] because they know what the doctor said
[1:26:47] they know how dire the situation was but
[1:26:49] they seen a living god in action
[1:26:53] and if god is that kind of god there in
[1:26:55] indiana what kind of god is he in
[1:26:57] arkansas
[1:26:58] he's the same god he's the same healer
[1:27:01] he's the same deliverer
[1:27:02] he's the same waymaker oh church
[1:27:05] the problem is though that that
[1:27:09] we get weak when it comes down time to
[1:27:11] the battle
[1:27:12] we pull back we don't believe brother
[1:27:15] bram said now watch the order of the
[1:27:17] word he says and you shall
[1:27:19] you shall receive it shall have it first
[1:27:22] you got to believe that you got it
[1:27:25] you got to believe that you got it
[1:27:29] easy for us to believe for somebody else
[1:27:30] correct
[1:27:32] brother david you almost lost your life
[1:27:34] to covet
[1:27:36] you was one step into the grave but god
[1:27:38] sustained you
[1:27:40] but you your family has to have the
[1:27:42] faith to believe
[1:27:43] that if god can do it for somebody else
[1:27:45] then god can do it for me
[1:27:47] god can do it for my family member god
[1:27:49] can do it for my family let me tell you
[1:27:51] that's the kind of faith that we got to
[1:27:53] have
[1:27:53] not just for somebody else but god
[1:27:55] you're as much god for me this morning
[1:27:57] as you were for that brother as you
[1:27:59] weren't for that sister
[1:28:00] god work into my heart working my life
[1:28:02] work in this situation
[1:28:03] god i don't see an answer but you are
[1:28:06] the answer to the problem
[1:28:08] and god was the answer to your covet and
[1:28:10] god sustains you god allowed you
[1:28:13] and coveted to meet in the middle and
[1:28:15] guess what happened you came out
[1:28:16] victorious
[1:28:18] oh satan has thrown his best at god's
[1:28:20] people
[1:28:22] but he ain't got enough this morning
[1:28:24] church let me tell you no matter what
[1:28:25] you're facing
[1:28:26] the devil don't have enough he don't
[1:28:28] have enough hounds or hell
[1:28:29] he don't have enough sickness he don't
[1:28:31] have enough depression he don't have
[1:28:32] enough anxiety to destroy a son and
[1:28:34] daughter of god he don't have enough
[1:28:36] because we serve a god of
[1:28:38] impossibilities
[1:28:40] we serve almighty god he says first you
[1:28:43] got to receive it you got to believe it
[1:28:45] and when you come and make your
[1:28:47] confession believe god
[1:28:48] believe that he will do it and he's
[1:28:50] under obligation to do it
[1:28:52] god is worth no more than his word no
[1:28:54] man is worth any more than his word
[1:28:56] and god is infallible he cannot lie
[1:28:59] excuse me his word is true and we just
[1:29:01] accept him by his word and believe it
[1:29:04] and it's got to happen he said it will
[1:29:06] happen if we believe it
[1:29:08] and we'll act upon our conviction but
[1:29:11] notice he said what's the matter is we
[1:29:12] christians
[1:29:13] we get too weak when it comes down to
[1:29:15] the showdown
[1:29:16] if it's real if it's real it's real let
[1:29:19] me go ahead and tell you this message is
[1:29:20] real
[1:29:22] he said bro joe how do i know that
[1:29:23] because i know what it's done for me
[1:29:26] i was going one way i was going down to
[1:29:29] a sinner's grave in the devil's hell
[1:29:31] but this word gotta hold in my heart
[1:29:33] turn my life around
[1:29:35] change my desires change my nature i
[1:29:38] don't desire the things i used to desire
[1:29:40] i don't look at the things i used to
[1:29:41] look at i don't drink the things i used
[1:29:43] to drink i don't smoke the things i used
[1:29:45] to smoke why because this word
[1:29:47] it works today church it's the same word
[1:29:50] that healed in the days of jesus it's
[1:29:52] the same word
[1:29:52] that delivered in the days of william
[1:29:54] brother and it's the same word today
[1:29:56] the same anointing the same holy ghost
[1:29:58] the same power
[1:29:59] and the same authority
[1:30:05] but we believe word of life tabernacle i
[1:30:08] believe we can say we believe it
[1:30:10] we believe it's real we believe in a
[1:30:13] living god
[1:30:14] we believe in a god that does a
[1:30:15] supernatural we believe in god that is
[1:30:18] supernatural
[1:30:19] we believe in a god that heals we
[1:30:20] believe in a god that delivers
[1:30:22] and we believe in the power of the holy
[1:30:24] ghost to transform lives
[1:30:26] we believe sorry devil you came too late
[1:30:29] we already believe
[1:30:33] oh it may be impossible it may be
[1:30:36] impossible for the denominations
[1:30:38] i got a very good friend of mine he's a
[1:30:39] baptist pastor probably one of my best
[1:30:41] friends
[1:30:42] we go hunting all the time together and
[1:30:45] one day we were turkey hunting
[1:30:47] how many y'all know sister atlanta butts
[1:30:48] in our church she was delivered from
[1:30:50] stage four lymphoma cancer
[1:30:52] and he and i were talking about and i
[1:30:55] was telling him the testimony how god
[1:30:56] came down and healed her
[1:30:57] he said you believe god healed her
[1:31:01] i said are you stupid she was had a
[1:31:04] death sentence on her yeah i believe god
[1:31:06] healed
[1:31:06] so you believe it's god's will to heal i
[1:31:08] said absolutely i believe it's god's
[1:31:09] will to heal
[1:31:13] and now the baptists don't believe that
[1:31:14] way they believe
[1:31:17] that if it is god's will he will heal
[1:31:20] they don't believe that it is his will
[1:31:21] to heal but when jesus sent his
[1:31:23] disciples out
[1:31:25] he told them to heal the sick to cast
[1:31:28] out devils
[1:31:29] feeler you give freely you receive so he
[1:31:32] gave the commission to heal the sick so
[1:31:34] it is god's will
[1:31:36] to heal so i say that to say the
[1:31:39] denominations
[1:31:40] may not have that revelation they may
[1:31:42] not have that authority
[1:31:43] it may be impossible with them but there
[1:31:45] is a god that heals today
[1:31:47] there is a god that sets free today
[1:31:48] there is a god that delivers today and
[1:31:50] there is a god that cast out spirits
[1:31:53] so what would they do in the
[1:31:54] denomination realm they sent them to a
[1:31:56] hospital
[1:31:58] they'll put them in an insane ward
[1:32:00] because they don't have the authority
[1:32:03] or the power or the revelation by which
[1:32:06] god gave the disciples to cast out
[1:32:08] devils to lay hands on the sick and they
[1:32:10] shall recover
[1:32:10] that's not no preacher's word that's not
[1:32:12] brother branham's word
[1:32:14] that's god's word that's jesus word to
[1:32:16] his followers you do these things they
[1:32:18] will not fall
[1:32:20] and so that's why we do these things
[1:32:22] that's why we line up to the word
[1:32:24] now notice the angel lord came to
[1:32:26] brother branham one time and he said now
[1:32:27] look if you can get to people to believe
[1:32:30] then nothing will stand before your
[1:32:32] prayer
[1:32:33] not even cancer back then they didn't
[1:32:36] have the
[1:32:37] the medical science that they do today
[1:32:39] for cancer treatment
[1:32:41] so usually back then when person
[1:32:43] somebody got cancer that person normally
[1:32:45] died
[1:32:46] but you realize we're not talking about
[1:32:48] normal we're talking about a god of
[1:32:50] impossibilities
[1:32:51] so this this angel came and told our
[1:32:53] prophet that if you can get the people
[1:32:55] to believe
[1:32:56] if you can elevate their faith that they
[1:32:58] can believe in a supernatural god
[1:33:00] a god that does the impossible then
[1:33:02] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:33:05] not even cancer now today churches want
[1:33:07] to they want to go back and say that was
[1:33:09] only for william branham i disagree with
[1:33:11] that
[1:33:11] i believe that word that message is as
[1:33:13] much as the 5-fold ministry today
[1:33:15] as it was to him then if i can get you
[1:33:18] to believe this morning
[1:33:19] that you're healed then you can receive
[1:33:21] that healing and if i can get you to
[1:33:22] believe this morning that that situation
[1:33:24] is already resolved then that situation
[1:33:26] will be resolved for you this morning if
[1:33:28] i can only get you to believe
[1:33:29] then you can have whatever things you
[1:33:31] ask for
[1:33:32] but your faith has got to be elevated
[1:33:34] look away from your situations
[1:33:36] look away from your sickness look away
[1:33:38] from how you feel and look to jesus this
[1:33:40] morning
[1:33:41] he's the author and the finisher of our
[1:33:43] faith
[1:33:46] he says now if i can get you to believe
[1:33:50] not worked up to not a thought in your
[1:33:53] mind but what you really know
[1:33:55] the very evidence of things not seen and
[1:33:58] we got
[1:33:58] we got churches now around the message
[1:34:01] preachers
[1:34:02] churches that don't believe in telling
[1:34:04] about the supernatural
[1:34:09] now i'm not going to get through all
[1:34:10] this today i thought i would but my
[1:34:13] goodness
[1:34:13] y'all pulling too good notice now their
[1:34:17] churches and preachers that don't
[1:34:19] believe in telling
[1:34:20] about the supernatural they shy away and
[1:34:24] even frown on telling
[1:34:25] about current day miracles that god's
[1:34:28] performing
[1:34:30] what do they say well that's only for
[1:34:32] brother branham
[1:34:36] either we're included in the promise or
[1:34:37] we're not either we're sons and
[1:34:39] daughters of god or not
[1:34:41] either the promise is unto them that
[1:34:43] believe or it's only to him that believe
[1:34:45] i happen to think it's for them
[1:34:48] i happen to put my place there and say
[1:34:49] you know what i believe
[1:34:51] i've already seen it with my own eyes
[1:34:53] i've witnessed it
[1:34:55] but they claim what they claim is this
[1:34:57] man drawing attention away
[1:34:59] from the prophet and putting the
[1:35:00] attention on his own ministry and his
[1:35:02] own gifts
[1:35:03] but let me ask you how will we ever get
[1:35:07] to people to believe
[1:35:09] in a supernatural god if we don't tell
[1:35:11] about the miracles
[1:35:13] if we don't tell about the healings if
[1:35:14] we don't make known the deliverances has
[1:35:16] taken place
[1:35:18] how will your faith ever rise up
[1:35:22] well we got the word brother joe yeah
[1:35:24] the word you got the letter the letter
[1:35:26] killeth
[1:35:26] but we want the letter and the spirit
[1:35:28] mixed together because the spirit
[1:35:30] anoints the word to live and what is the
[1:35:33] anointing of the spirit is signs
[1:35:34] following the believer
[1:35:36] it's miracles taking place it's the
[1:35:38] supernatural coming behind that letter
[1:35:40] and saying all right live again
[1:35:42] son of man can these dry bones live
[1:35:44] absolutely they can live
[1:35:46] oh it was just a ladder then but when
[1:35:48] the ladder when when the anointing
[1:35:50] breathed across that valley of dry bones
[1:35:52] let me tell you sin you became back to
[1:35:54] those dry bones they begin to rattle
[1:35:56] they begin to move they begin to come to
[1:35:57] life let me tell you there may be some
[1:35:59] dry bulls in this house this morning but
[1:36:01] i'm going to tell you there's an
[1:36:02] anointing that can sweep through this
[1:36:03] building
[1:36:04] and dry bones can come to life and send
[1:36:06] you and vote and muscle
[1:36:08] and life breathe back into your heart
[1:36:10] breathe back into your soul
[1:36:11] breathe back into your families let me
[1:36:13] tell you our god is able church
[1:36:16] don't put this in a day of 50 years ago
[1:36:19] only on a prophet
[1:36:20] it's more than able today he's the god
[1:36:22] of the impossibility
[1:36:23] right now this morning this service for
[1:36:25] your need
[1:36:28] don't put god in the box say he don't
[1:36:30] move today
[1:36:31] yes he does he's every bit the same god
[1:36:38] see it's not man taking credit for these
[1:36:40] things but it's god
[1:36:42] working through man
[1:36:46] these things are not possible with man
[1:36:49] i can't come put my hands on you
[1:36:53] and deserve what you're going through
[1:36:55] unless it be god
[1:36:57] i can't come put my hands on you and
[1:36:58] cast out that spirit because i don't
[1:37:00] know what you got
[1:37:02] unless it be god i can't pray for you
[1:37:05] for healing
[1:37:06] unless it be god so it has nothing
[1:37:10] to do with man man is only god's agent
[1:37:13] by which he uses to perform his word
[1:37:18] but we want to put it all off one man
[1:37:21] and i respect
[1:37:22] our prophet but i also respect every
[1:37:25] time he pointed us to christ
[1:37:27] because he knew one day he was off the
[1:37:29] scene he'd be off the scene but jesus
[1:37:31] would never walk off the scene
[1:37:32] because he said i'll never leave you
[1:37:34] i'll never forsake you i'll be with you
[1:37:37] even to the end of the age
[1:37:40] church we're at the end of the age and
[1:37:42] he's still with us
[1:37:44] we have that promise he's not left us
[1:37:47] notice man doesn't possess any special
[1:37:49] power to heal to save
[1:37:51] man is under this unction of the holy
[1:37:52] spirit and can only be used by god to
[1:37:56] make these things come to pass whether
[1:37:58] it be healing whether it be salvation
[1:37:59] whether it be deliverance
[1:38:00] it's all god and we find they don't want
[1:38:04] to declare but the bible tells us to
[1:38:05] declare these things
[1:38:08] psalms 105 and verse 1 says make known
[1:38:10] his deeds among the people
[1:38:13] psalms 89 and verse 1 i will sing of his
[1:38:15] mercies
[1:38:17] excuse me i will sing of the mercies of
[1:38:18] the lord forever
[1:38:20] oh well we can't preach about it i guess
[1:38:22] we can sing about it
[1:38:23] well i wish i could sing because i'd
[1:38:25] sing right now i told the church the
[1:38:27] other day i preached the other day and i
[1:38:28] had a dream before i preached it was
[1:38:29] saturday night
[1:38:30] i had my dream man i could preach i mean
[1:38:32] i could sing
[1:38:33] oh it was so lovely and i woke up the
[1:38:37] next morning i was so disappointed
[1:38:39] scratch out i guess i'll just preach god
[1:38:42] knows who he can and can't give
[1:38:44] gifts to but we find here i will sing of
[1:38:47] the mercies of the lord forever
[1:38:49] with my mouth will i make known thy
[1:38:51] faithfulness
[1:38:52] to all generations not stop at 65
[1:38:56] but to all generations psalms 96 and
[1:38:59] verse 3
[1:38:59] declare his glory among the heathen his
[1:39:02] wonders among all people
[1:39:04] psalms 145 and verse 4 one generation
[1:39:07] shall praise our works to another
[1:39:09] otherwise
[1:39:09] tell the other generation about the
[1:39:12] powers of god
[1:39:13] what god did how he opened the red sea
[1:39:15] how he slayed 600 under sham guard
[1:39:18] how samson defeated 1 000. let me tell
[1:39:20] you declare make known these wonderful
[1:39:22] works of god
[1:39:25] one generation shall praise thy works to
[1:39:27] another and shall clear thou mighty acts
[1:39:29] i will speak of the glorious honor
[1:39:31] of thy majesty i know thy wonders works
[1:39:33] psalms 145 and verse 11
[1:39:35] they shall speak of the glory of thy
[1:39:37] kingdom and talk of thy power
[1:39:39] to make known to the sons of men his
[1:39:41] mighty acts
[1:39:42] and the glorious majesty of his kingdom
[1:39:46] oh church don't you shy away of the
[1:39:47] supernatural don't you shy away a
[1:39:49] testifying what god has done and what
[1:39:51] god is doing
[1:39:52] you know the prophet of god nailed it
[1:39:54] when he says you know man is always
[1:39:55] looking back to see what god had done
[1:39:57] oh we can always look back and see what
[1:39:59] god has done he said he's always looking
[1:40:00] forward
[1:40:01] to see what god is going to do oh god is
[1:40:03] going to do this and god is going to do
[1:40:04] that but we ignore man ignores what god
[1:40:07] is doing right now i mean
[1:40:08] don't be guilty of ignoring the
[1:40:10] supernatural in our midst
[1:40:12] god is healing cancer god is delivering
[1:40:14] god is bringing home the prodigal
[1:40:15] god is still moving god is still working
[1:40:18] i've seen it time and time again
[1:40:22] god is doing these things so let me read
[1:40:25] some testimonies to you
[1:40:26] before i close that okay it's okay that
[1:40:29] our closer is okay let's read the
[1:40:30] testimonies that's a trick question
[1:40:31] don't answer
[1:40:32] don't answer you'll be in trouble
[1:40:36] how many you know sister beth dingwell
[1:40:40] maybe a couple of you know her sister
[1:40:43] beth dingwall
[1:40:44] she goes to brother bischo's church been
[1:40:46] there all her life
[1:40:48] years ago as a child she had this form
[1:40:52] it's called
[1:40:53] lymphomastic leukemia
[1:40:57] it's only is in children
[1:41:00] the survival rate is zero
[1:41:04] every child that ever got this form of
[1:41:05] leukemia never made it out alive
[1:41:08] they got the same treatment in hospital
[1:41:11] rooms
[1:41:12] well there was something different about
[1:41:14] this child
[1:41:16] because this child was part of a
[1:41:17] believing family
[1:41:19] this child was part of a believing
[1:41:21] church and i believe in family and i
[1:41:23] believe in church
[1:41:24] sought the horns of the altar and began
[1:41:26] to pray and begin to believe
[1:41:28] and suture beth dengue is the only known
[1:41:30] survivor of this form of leukemia
[1:41:33] and when she when she recovered from it
[1:41:36] they had to go in and change the record
[1:41:37] books
[1:41:38] now it's one in a million let me tell
[1:41:40] you she was at one
[1:41:42] and it may be that you're the one in
[1:41:43] your situation but god still
[1:41:46] does the impossible now i asked you this
[1:41:49] morning won't one of you go and tell her
[1:41:51] that god doesn't do miracles
[1:41:55] too late because she is one
[1:41:58] she's witnessed the power of god she her
[1:42:01] life should have been taken from her
[1:42:03] because satan put a death sentence on
[1:42:05] her but i'm going to tell you god
[1:42:06] changes the devil's plans
[1:42:10] satan can put only so much on he can
[1:42:11] only come so far
[1:42:13] but with god all things are possible
[1:42:16] how many of you are familiar with
[1:42:18] brother gary walker whether gary walker
[1:42:20] is a preacher in new zealand
[1:42:22] he was involved in a serious car
[1:42:23] accident while traveling home from some
[1:42:25] services
[1:42:26] he and his wife and his daughter i
[1:42:27] believe they were in a car accident and
[1:42:29] his wife looked over at him and he was
[1:42:30] lifeless he's already dead and
[1:42:32] he had turned gray and he's completely
[1:42:34] his eyes rolled back in the back of his
[1:42:36] head not breathing
[1:42:37] perfectly still blood oozing out of his
[1:42:39] nose
[1:42:40] and something spoke to her pray for him
[1:42:43] and she tried to put her arm on him but
[1:42:44] her arm was broken it couldn't move and
[1:42:46] her and her daughter began to pray the
[1:42:47] effectual fervent prayer
[1:42:48] of a righteous man and brother gary came
[1:42:50] back to life life breathed back into him
[1:42:53] and he began to gurgle in his blood
[1:42:56] people arrived on the scene and she said
[1:42:58] she they took us out of the wreck
[1:43:00] emergency service began to arrive and
[1:43:02] he died again now he didn't die twice
[1:43:05] satan was he was determined
[1:43:09] no matter how determined he is our god
[1:43:11] is more than determined
[1:43:14] there was a piece of excuse me a piece
[1:43:16] of paper found in gary's clothes
[1:43:18] recordings gary status state he was
[1:43:21] deceased at 5
[1:43:22] 48 p.m i would have kept that for a
[1:43:26] trophy
[1:43:28] arriving at the emergency department his
[1:43:30] wife was informed that gary had a severe
[1:43:31] head injury
[1:43:32] he had error in the brain bleeding in
[1:43:35] the brain
[1:43:36] a large hemorrhage in the skull multiple
[1:43:38] broken bones including the temporal bone
[1:43:40] the orbitals
[1:43:41] the sinuses his palate was split he had
[1:43:43] a broken shoulder blade
[1:43:45] this gloving of tissue from his right
[1:43:47] arm fractured t12 spine
[1:43:49] fractured ribs shattered right pelvis
[1:43:51] fractured left leg kneecap
[1:43:53] tendons were torn off his right shoulder
[1:43:54] and his left knee
[1:43:57] he was in pretty bad shape gary's nurse
[1:44:01] in the emergency room took his wife in
[1:44:03] to see him for what would be the very
[1:44:04] last time
[1:44:05] is with him alive he had already died
[1:44:09] twice and he wasn't expected to live
[1:44:11] he was on life support and was
[1:44:12] unrecognizable
[1:44:15] but with your darkest mouth that's when
[1:44:16] jesus comes on the scene
[1:44:19] notice she didn't settle and the family
[1:44:21] didn't settle
[1:44:22] and the church didn't settle for the
[1:44:25] report that the doctors gave
[1:44:27] he's not going to recover he's not going
[1:44:30] to recover
[1:44:31] he's not going to recover but god came
[1:44:34] on the scene
[1:44:36] and they were told many times that he
[1:44:38] wouldn't even improve
[1:44:39] okay he made it he lived he wouldn't
[1:44:42] improve
[1:44:42] but after two years of the trauma he
[1:44:44] continues to slowly
[1:44:46] improve he rarely slurs his words
[1:44:49] when tried he walks more steadily he's
[1:44:51] recently noticed freeing of the
[1:44:53] stiffness in his left hip
[1:44:54] his right knee gives him a lot less pain
[1:44:56] he's gaining more use of his left hand
[1:44:58] it can lift his arm
[1:44:59] well over his head and he still preaches
[1:45:02] inspired sermons
[1:45:05] oh satan had a plan for gary walker but
[1:45:08] god has a greater plan
[1:45:10] god says i'm going to put you gary and
[1:45:12] that problem gary
[1:45:13] and i'm going to work something
[1:45:15] supernatural
[1:45:18] in gary's own words he said he was at a
[1:45:20] very dark time in the hospital and he
[1:45:22] made his complaint known to god like any
[1:45:24] of us would right
[1:45:25] why me why didn't you just kill me why
[1:45:28] didn't you just take me
[1:45:30] and the voice spoke back to him and said
[1:45:32] if you knew the big picture
[1:45:35] you would volunteer for this
[1:45:39] sometimes i wonder if we're so shallow
[1:45:41] we're so worried about us
[1:45:42] and not realizing the big picture what a
[1:45:45] testimony
[1:45:46] of what god has done in gary walker's
[1:45:48] life
[1:45:49] a man who died twice wasn't expected to
[1:45:51] make it a third time
[1:45:53] and he still lives and he was told he
[1:45:54] wasn't gonna have any quality of life
[1:45:56] and he's still living and he's improving
[1:45:58] and he's preaching inspired sermons
[1:46:00] in the face of the enemy he's still
[1:46:03] ministering the gospel
[1:46:04] in the face of everything he's gone
[1:46:06] through he's declared that our god
[1:46:08] does impossibilities
[1:46:13] we all know the story of brother ron
[1:46:16] the angel of the lord came to brother
[1:46:17] ron told him if you trust me with your
[1:46:19] life
[1:46:20] i'll use you like never before
[1:46:23] this time last year i think it was maybe
[1:46:25] just around december
[1:46:27] november or december of 2019 if i'm not
[1:46:29] mistaken and
[1:46:30] he was diagnosed with cancer and his
[1:46:33] lymph nodes and his lungs and i think it
[1:46:34] went from his lungs to his brain so
[1:46:37] this man has got cancer throughout his
[1:46:40] body
[1:46:42] but if you've been watching services at
[1:46:43] the last several months
[1:46:45] this man is preaching under such an
[1:46:47] anointing
[1:46:48] not somebody who's up all night throwing
[1:46:51] up because of the chemo treatments
[1:46:54] so brother tim and i are having a
[1:46:55] conversation of the day and you know
[1:46:57] we're wondering when is ron going to
[1:46:59] receive his healing and i looked at
[1:47:01] brother tim i said you know let me tell
[1:47:02] you
[1:47:03] now this is me telling my pastor we all
[1:47:05] know my pastor is a very staunch
[1:47:06] believer and
[1:47:07] he's a very firm man and i just said you
[1:47:09] know god told him
[1:47:11] if you trust me with your life i'll use
[1:47:14] you
[1:47:14] like never before i said if god would
[1:47:17] have healed ron spencer in three months
[1:47:20] that's not using him like never before
[1:47:22] but in the face
[1:47:24] of the enemy in the face of all his
[1:47:26] sickness in the face of his sugar going
[1:47:28] up and down
[1:47:28] in the face of that devil trying to
[1:47:31] destroy his life
[1:47:32] with lung cancer brain cancer sugar
[1:47:34] issues
[1:47:35] throwing up all in the middle of the
[1:47:36] night god is using his servant
[1:47:39] more than ever before he's preaching
[1:47:41] more
[1:47:42] inspired sermons elevating the faith of
[1:47:44] the people
[1:47:45] and if ron spitzer can do it you can do
[1:47:47] it too
[1:47:48] and if god is the god of impossibility
[1:47:50] and a man that was supposed to die he
[1:47:52] only was given four months and he's
[1:47:54] still living what about your situation
[1:47:56] what about your family what about your
[1:47:58] need this morning he's a god of
[1:48:00] impossibility
[1:48:01] he's a weight maker he's a miracle
[1:48:03] worker and he's on time for you this
[1:48:05] morning
[1:48:08] he's on the scene for you this morning
[1:48:11] you say brother joe do you not believe
[1:48:12] that he's going to get his healing i
[1:48:13] absolutely do believe
[1:48:15] but i believe god had an appointment ron
[1:48:17] spencer
[1:48:18] cancer you're going to meet together
[1:48:20] because god's going to use this problem
[1:48:22] and he's going to do the impossible with
[1:48:24] it
[1:48:26] god's going to do the supernatural with
[1:48:28] ron spencer's testimony
[1:48:30] and his ministry and i'm telling you
[1:48:32] i've watched and i've listened i've
[1:48:33] gleaned
[1:48:34] and i've seen what god has done and the
[1:48:37] inspiration behind every sermon
[1:48:39] i'm here to tell you god is doing great
[1:48:41] things
[1:48:42] but it ain't only for ron spencer it's
[1:48:44] for whosoever will
[1:48:46] he's as much god this morning for you
[1:48:48] for your situation
[1:48:49] for your need is as he is for ron for
[1:48:52] gary walker for beth dingle
[1:48:54] for whatever let me bring this down to a
[1:48:58] close
[1:49:00] he said now my business is not to figure
[1:49:03] out how god is going to do it
[1:49:05] how god is going to make a way god will
[1:49:07] do it somehow
[1:49:09] how are you if you're dying with heart
[1:49:10] trouble how are you going to get well
[1:49:12] when a doctor says that you can't live
[1:49:14] another week i don't know
[1:49:16] but god will provide god will make a way
[1:49:21] he's still jehovah chira
[1:49:26] he's still jehovah jireh he still
[1:49:28] provides
[1:49:32] oh many times we think god has forsaken
[1:49:34] us told
[1:49:36] abraham take your son oh man y'all
[1:49:38] waited 25 years and here he is
[1:49:40] now i want you to take him when he's
[1:49:41] about 13. i want you to tie his hands
[1:49:43] together i want you to walk him over
[1:49:44] this mountain
[1:49:44] go about 90 to 100 miles and take him up
[1:49:46] in his heart this tall mouth and i want
[1:49:48] you to
[1:49:48] sacrifice your only son
[1:49:53] abraham said yes lord i'll do it
[1:49:56] he believed that he gave me isaac
[1:50:01] as one from the dead and surely if he
[1:50:04] was to take his life
[1:50:06] he can raise him again and notice they
[1:50:09] get to the top of the mountain before
[1:50:10] they go up he looked at his servant
[1:50:12] he said the lad and i are going to go
[1:50:13] yonder to worship
[1:50:16] and the lad and i will return see
[1:50:19] abraham didn't stagger at the situation
[1:50:21] abraham wasn't trembling as he was
[1:50:23] walking those hundred miles
[1:50:25] knowing what laid the head of him no
[1:50:27] abraham had his faith
[1:50:28] anchored in god and if i can get you to
[1:50:30] anchor your faith this morning and god
[1:50:32] and all the storms of life they may blow
[1:50:35] they may beat against your ship
[1:50:36] but they can't shake you they won't turn
[1:50:38] you loose from the promise of god
[1:50:40] and abraham went up there steadfast
[1:50:42] never staggered at the promises of god
[1:50:45] stroked his little hair back laid him
[1:50:47] down on the altar began to pull that
[1:50:49] knife back and the angel the lord caught
[1:50:51] his hand
[1:50:51] said abraham stay thy hand i know now
[1:50:54] that you love me
[1:50:55] see sometimes god's just waiting till
[1:50:56] the last minute to see if you believe
[1:50:59] to see if you really care to see if you
[1:51:01] really honor that word
[1:51:03] and when he did a lan a ram bladed over
[1:51:06] in the bushes
[1:51:08] god provided and he's very much
[1:51:11] god this morning for you and your
[1:51:12] situation as he was for abraham
[1:51:16] he's still jehovah jair he's still a
[1:51:18] waymaker
[1:51:19] he's still a need supplier now let me
[1:51:22] get down to this i'm gonna bring this to
[1:51:23] a close
[1:51:24] i gotta skip a lot but let me bring us
[1:51:26] down
[1:51:28] john six verse one
[1:51:32] after these things jesus went over the
[1:51:35] sea of galilee
[1:51:37] which is the sea of tiberias and a great
[1:51:40] multitude followed him
[1:51:42] because they saw his miracles which he
[1:51:45] did
[1:51:45] on them that were deceased lord disease
[1:51:49] excuse me disease
[1:51:52] jesus went up into the mountain and
[1:51:54] there he sat with the disciples
[1:51:56] and the passover and the feast of the
[1:51:57] jews was nigh and when jesus lifted up
[1:52:00] his eyes he saw a great company come
[1:52:02] unto him and he saith unto philip when
[1:52:04] shall we buy bread
[1:52:05] that these may eat and this is
[1:52:09] he said this to prove him for he himself
[1:52:12] knew what he would do and philip
[1:52:13] answered
[1:52:14] 200 penny worth of bread is not
[1:52:16] sufficient for them
[1:52:19] that every one of them may take a little
[1:52:21] and one of the disciples andrew simon
[1:52:23] peter's brother said unto him
[1:52:24] there is a lad here which has five
[1:52:26] barley loaves and two small fishes
[1:52:28] but what are they among so many
[1:52:31] you know many times we find ourselves in
[1:52:34] phillips place
[1:52:36] lord we got all this look at this
[1:52:38] there's no wave
[1:52:40] it's 200 penny worth all we got is five
[1:52:44] five loaves and two fishes i mean you
[1:52:46] may be jesus and all but really let's
[1:52:48] think about this
[1:52:48] that's a lot of people i'm doing it in
[1:52:51] our modern day
[1:52:52] all right preacher you plan on doing
[1:52:55] this that's impossible
[1:52:57] there's no way but we find ourselves
[1:53:00] just like philip in a difficult
[1:53:02] situation a difficult time we look at
[1:53:04] the crowd we look at the task at hand
[1:53:06] we look at how impossible it seems and
[1:53:07] we never realize
[1:53:09] who's with us we never realize
[1:53:13] jesus has already performed miracle
[1:53:15] after miracle
[1:53:16] after miracle after miracle
[1:53:19] and how common does the supernatural
[1:53:22] become when we've seen it over and over
[1:53:25] and over
[1:53:26] so jesus wasn't concerned about their
[1:53:28] lack of what they had he wasn't
[1:53:30] distraught about they didn't have enough
[1:53:31] money for the provision
[1:53:32] he's not concerned with what you lack
[1:53:34] he's not concerned about
[1:53:36] you not having money you're not having
[1:53:38] this that or the other
[1:53:39] he's only testing your faith
[1:53:42] do you believe that i will do what i
[1:53:45] said i will do
[1:53:47] notice he performed many miracles
[1:53:49] already in their midst and
[1:53:50] yet like us they were looking at the
[1:53:52] impossibility
[1:53:54] because they're looking through the eyes
[1:53:56] of man the finite mind there's no way
[1:53:59] they saw this one and that one and this
[1:54:01] one and that one as far as the eye can
[1:54:02] see
[1:54:02] 5 000 people 200 penny worth
[1:54:07] and many times brother batman says many
[1:54:09] times trouble strikes our home
[1:54:11] but he says it's a blessing in disguise
[1:54:12] and some people might say well you're
[1:54:14] sick
[1:54:15] just because you're sick he says just
[1:54:17] because you're not right with god he
[1:54:18] said that doesn't mean that job was
[1:54:20] right with god and he was sick
[1:54:22] but it's god testing you putting your
[1:54:24] putting you to the test to see what
[1:54:25] you'll do
[1:54:26] maybe he let the doctor say that for a
[1:54:28] purpose to see what you would do
[1:54:30] he never asked a question will i have a
[1:54:32] church will i have righteousness but he
[1:54:34] said will i find
[1:54:35] faith so he's looking for one thing
[1:54:37] church
[1:54:38] he's looking for word of life tabernacle
[1:54:40] to have faith to believe what he said he
[1:54:42] would do
[1:54:44] 200 penny worth
[1:54:48] well this is all we got we don't have
[1:54:50] enough we don't have enough resources
[1:54:52] we're insufficient
[1:54:53] god won't you just send everybody away
[1:54:55] let them go to their own homes
[1:54:57] we don't have enough and that's how we
[1:54:59] act sometimes
[1:55:01] you know i know as a preacher sometimes
[1:55:03] you feel
[1:55:05] you feel incapable what can i do what
[1:55:08] can i
[1:55:09] what can i give these people well when
[1:55:11] you take that kind of mindset it's not
[1:55:13] you anyway
[1:55:14] you have to remind yourself you've been
[1:55:15] anointed for this you've been called
[1:55:17] you've been chosen you've been elected
[1:55:19] it's not you that's obligated to feed
[1:55:21] the people he's obligated
[1:55:24] so i come this morning not with notes
[1:55:27] from joe adams
[1:55:28] but inspiration from the angel of the
[1:55:29] lord to speak these things to tell you
[1:55:31] that he's still god today
[1:55:34] and there was a lad there he only had
[1:55:36] five five barley loaves and two small
[1:55:38] fishes but what are these among so many
[1:55:40] how are we lord we don't have the money
[1:55:42] and all we got is five
[1:55:44] this little boy took five loaves that
[1:55:46] morning went he skipped school and he
[1:55:48] went down and he caught a couple fish in
[1:55:50] the river and you know here he is he's
[1:55:52] here to see what you're gonna do with it
[1:55:58] but we find this little boy was right on
[1:56:00] time
[1:56:03] god never misses the moment
[1:56:06] he's always on time when it looks
[1:56:10] impossible
[1:56:11] he's on time when it looks as distraught
[1:56:14] and a despair as you are
[1:56:16] he's always owned time
[1:56:19] he said how could a man take five little
[1:56:22] fish
[1:56:23] or five little pieces of fish and five
[1:56:25] biscuits and two pieces of fish
[1:56:27] and break them and feed five thousand
[1:56:29] not wiggling fish
[1:56:31] now i want you to get this this is how
[1:56:32] the proper describes this but
[1:56:34] cooked fish he says 5 000 people out of
[1:56:39] two fish
[1:56:40] he took those little fellas broke it off
[1:56:42] handed it out
[1:56:43] broke off another piece and every time
[1:56:45] he break it off another piece
[1:56:46] it had growed on cooked fish already
[1:56:49] cooked fried in crisco
[1:56:51] ready to go ready growed it all what a
[1:56:53] person
[1:56:54] i said if god can do that then oh my god
[1:56:57] can do that today
[1:56:59] cook fish even put them in crisco
[1:57:03] friedman broke it off and fed 5 000.
[1:57:07] he said now not break off raise up some
[1:57:10] wheat and go cook it and things like
[1:57:11] that
[1:57:11] the regular procedure but he could
[1:57:13] bypass all that just
[1:57:14] break off cooked bread hand it out to
[1:57:17] them with brown crust on it
[1:57:19] take it and eat oh my
[1:57:23] what a god of impossibilities notice now
[1:57:26] ordered two fishing five loaves among so
[1:57:28] many
[1:57:30] it all depends as i bring this down to a
[1:57:32] close
[1:57:33] of whose hands it's in it all depends
[1:57:37] we think for a minute give me a
[1:57:38] basketball i don't know i look like
[1:57:40] spudwell up here right i don't know
[1:57:41] who's
[1:57:41] well he's about five foot six he was a
[1:57:43] basketball nba player
[1:57:44] many years ago but you give me a
[1:57:46] basketball it may be worth 15
[1:57:48] 20 bucks in my hand stick it in steph
[1:57:50] curry's hand it'll be worth 30 to 40
[1:57:52] million
[1:57:54] i know i may be saying some names you i
[1:57:55] don't know don't go google them it's
[1:57:56] okay i'm just taking my word for it this
[1:57:58] morning
[1:57:59] maybe you give me a football it may be
[1:58:01] worth 10 or 11 bucks i may be able to
[1:58:03] throw it 20 feet
[1:58:04] but you put that same football in peyton
[1:58:06] manning's hand it's worth 50 or 60
[1:58:08] million
[1:58:10] are you giving me a golf club how many
[1:58:11] of you ever heard of tiger woods
[1:58:13] i had a golf club in my hand it made
[1:58:15] depends on how much i want to spend it
[1:58:16] maybe 100 to 120 bucks
[1:58:18] but you put that same golf club in tiger
[1:58:20] woods hands it'll win the u.s
[1:58:22] open and 80 million dollars you give me
[1:58:24] a stick and put it in my hand
[1:58:26] i may be able to beat a wild dog way but
[1:58:28] you put that same stick
[1:58:30] in the prophet moses it'll split the red
[1:58:32] sea oh let me tell you
[1:58:34] church here it is it all depends on
[1:58:36] whose hands it's sin
[1:58:38] you give me a slingshot or it may look
[1:58:40] like a little kid toy but you put that
[1:58:42] same slingshot
[1:58:43] in the hands of david a giant slayer and
[1:58:45] those shots have to fall
[1:58:47] every time why it all depends on whose
[1:58:50] hands it's in
[1:58:53] you give me a couple nails right now i
[1:58:55] may be able to build you a birdhouse
[1:58:56] i may be able to attach something on the
[1:58:58] wall but you take those same two nails
[1:59:00] and you drive them through the hands of
[1:59:02] jesus christ it brings eternal
[1:59:03] redemption
[1:59:04] it brings salvation it brings death hell
[1:59:07] and the grave back to a living people
[1:59:09] i mean it all depends on whose hands
[1:59:11] it's in
[1:59:15] and your worries and your cares
[1:59:18] and those things that you stressed about
[1:59:20] if you leave them
[1:59:22] in your hands that's all that they'll
[1:59:25] ever be
[1:59:27] but if you put those same worries those
[1:59:30] same cares
[1:59:31] those same troubles in the hands of
[1:59:32] jesus he
[1:59:34] will do the impossible
[1:59:38] musicians can come the prophet of god
[1:59:40] will say this 1965 heard but now i see
[1:59:43] we find that in those hours of real
[1:59:45] stress
[1:59:46] usually when the spirit of god moves in
[1:59:49] he goes
[1:59:50] that's usually when the spirit of god
[1:59:51] moves in he let the hebrew children
[1:59:54] walk walk right into the fiery furnace
[1:59:57] before he ever moved to hand but when he
[2:00:00] moves
[2:00:01] he moves did you hear me church
[2:00:05] when he moves he moves
[2:00:08] there ain't enough devils in hell ain't
[2:00:10] enough politics
[2:00:12] ain't enough disappointments in life
[2:00:14] ain't enough sickness that can tack your
[2:00:15] body
[2:00:16] when god moves he moves
[2:00:20] problems said god will answer in a time
[2:00:23] of crisis
[2:00:25] he will not only answer but he will make
[2:00:27] manifest in the time of crisis
[2:00:29] if the people will assemble together no
[2:00:31] matter if two or three whatever it is
[2:00:33] and pray there he said he wouldn't he
[2:00:36] said we would hear
[2:00:38] from heaven now notice we go back here
[2:00:43] and we find that when they filled when
[2:00:45] they were done passing out the
[2:00:47] fishes and the loaves jesus said now i
[2:00:50] want you to go gather up
[2:00:51] the fragments i want you to go gather up
[2:00:55] the fragments
[2:00:57] fragments wow we only had two fish
[2:01:01] when we had five loaves you talking
[2:01:02] about fragments
[2:01:06] oh they went out and they began to
[2:01:08] gather up 12
[2:01:09] baskets full what am i telling you oh it
[2:01:12] looked like 5 000 was more than enough
[2:01:14] let me tell you our god
[2:01:16] is more than enough this morning he's
[2:01:18] more than enough to feed the 5 000
[2:01:20] he's more than enough to heal the sick
[2:01:22] he's more than enough to heal cancer
[2:01:24] he's more than enough to restore broken
[2:01:26] marriage he's more than enough
[2:01:28] go out and i want you to take up the
[2:01:30] fragments this morning
[2:01:33] take up the fragments 12 baskets for
[2:01:36] it proves that god is more than enough
[2:01:39] for your situation
[2:01:41] and he does the impossibilities
[2:01:44] [Music]
[2:01:46] he does the impossible and i asked you
[2:01:49] this morning you got a need this morning
[2:01:51] i believe in a god that does miracles i
[2:01:53] believe in a god that heals the sick
[2:01:55] i believe in a god that saves the lost i
[2:01:56] believe in the supernatural god
[2:01:58] if you got a need and you need prayer
[2:02:00] i'm here to pray with you but not only
[2:02:01] may i believe the angel of the lord will
[2:02:03] meet you here
[2:02:04] and take care of that situation and take
[2:02:06] care of that problem
[2:02:07] and take care of that sickness and take
[2:02:09] care of that lost son
[2:02:10] or daughter i believe
[2:02:13] i believe do you believe
[2:02:18] do you believe this morning brother
[2:02:21] brown makes this last as i end this
[2:02:23] with this quote he said that ought to be
[2:02:25] the achievement of every believer this
[2:02:27] afternoon god
[2:02:28] is able to keep every word that he said
[2:02:31] he'd do
[2:02:32] i don't care what the denominations say
[2:02:34] days is miracles is past
[2:02:36] all this is telepathy or telepathy
[2:02:39] all of his fortune telling it doesn't
[2:02:41] matter to me what they say
[2:02:43] i still believe if that gun is zero to
[2:02:47] the target
[2:02:48] it'll hit the target and i believe if if
[2:02:51] the believer is zero with
[2:02:52] with the word of god it'll hit the same
[2:02:54] thing if the word of god
[2:02:56] ever promised it he'll do it again i'm
[2:02:59] fully
[2:03:00] persuaded i'm fully persuaded this
[2:03:03] morning church
[2:03:04] that god will do what he said he'll do
[2:03:06] he does the impossible
[2:03:08] he does impossible math you may not have
[2:03:11] the answer but that's okay you don't
[2:03:13] have the end this is the time the only
[2:03:14] time
[2:03:15] that you're able to cheat on the test
[2:03:17] and look over on god's word
[2:03:18] and say oh hallelujah there's the answer
[2:03:21] when john looked past the curtain of
[2:03:23] time
[2:03:23] oh and the seals were torn off the book
[2:03:25] john looked at there's the answer
[2:03:28] i see my name and all heaven everything
[2:03:31] in heaven and under heaven and on there
[2:03:32] all things heard john shouted glory to
[2:03:35] god
[2:03:36] i've seen my name there i made it or the
[2:03:38] devil said i'm not good enough the devil
[2:03:40] said i'll never amount to anything but i
[2:03:42] made it i see my name there
[2:03:45] oh hallelujah see this can't take me
[2:03:49] because i see my name there depression
[2:03:51] can't have me
[2:03:52] i see my name there i see my name
[2:03:57] i see the answer time you're not of this
[2:04:00] world
[2:04:01] if you ever was a son of god you always
[2:04:03] was a son of god
[2:04:05] if you ever belong to god if you ever
[2:04:06] was a thought in the mind of god
[2:04:08] you always was a thought oh hallelujah
[2:04:12] church
[2:04:13] you need prayer this morning i'm here
[2:04:14] otherwise let's worship this god we
[2:04:16] serve
[2:04:18] hallelujah he's got it all
[2:04:21] in control
