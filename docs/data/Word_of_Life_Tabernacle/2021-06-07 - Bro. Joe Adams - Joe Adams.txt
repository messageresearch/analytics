gift you got boy i'd be platinum double platinum probably fine singing did you enjoy the specials this evening man god has got a talented people we are rich all right this message produces the cream of the crop we got excellent talent but it's one thing to have talent but another thing have talent that's dedicated to god that can be used gifts that are consecrated to him so we just without further ado we want to go ahead and turn to the word before we do that let's just pray father what a great honor great privilege we have once again to come back into your house into your presence and lord we know that this is not about man this is about you and we're asking father you would just take the vessel this evening lord you would set them aside and you'll be able to speak through him but not only speak through him but speak to the listener father we ask you to give us open hearts to receive ears that can hear lord what the spirit once said this evening we thank you for the congregation we thank you for this church brother ben his dedication to you into the service of the lord and father may you just not only blessed his church but bless the pastor lord what he has gone through in the past year coveted in different situations god i pray you'll continue to bless him pour out your spirit not on him only but upon the congregation the church lord continue to build them up and fortify them around your word fathers we see that the days are growing dark father now more than ever we need your hand upon our hearts and our lives so we just commit this service to you now lord we thank you in advance for what you're going to do tonight in jesus name amen go ahead and pull this off before we get started this evening amen you love the lord hallelujah we're going to look here in luke 1 as i spoke this morning we spoke on god does impossible math this evening we're going to do part two but i want this to subtitle to be nothing impossible with you i think a lot of times we find that there's nothing impossible with god as we spoke about this morning but we find we have difficulties placing ourselves in the promise we find difficulties placing ourselves there and say you know what nothing's impossible with me if i can believe so we look here in luke 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto the city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph and of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the lord shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is a six month with her who shall be called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her you can have your seats this evening as we look at this and we we draw our context and nothing is impossible with you i come here from the we're going to come out of the the message mary's belief and brother branham will begin to tell the story and paint the picture you know as only a profit candy said the spring sun was rising high in the judean skies and she started up the little street that morning with the water pot under her arm and her little youthful mom was thinking of the day before you know this was maybe a sunday she's reflecting back or a monday and she's reflecting back on the previous day of the service and brother brown would say her youthful mind was thinking of the day before how that at the synagogue where she and her espoused husband had sit and listen to the sermon from the rabbi and he would begin to talk and explain how the people while they were settled in the land and how he gave him a promise and god would be their father or the god with he was the father of abraham and he told them a hundred years before how they would inherit a land and how when god made the promise that he couldn't go back on that promise you know i want you to know tonight church he's still the same god when god gives the promise god doesn't go back on the promise just because it hasn't transpired immediately doesn't mean that god has given up on the promise god has given the promise he told abraham your your children is going to sojourn in a strange land for many many many years and it was 420 440 years but god remembered his promise and he's as much god for you tonight as he was for abraham as he was for isaac is he was for jacob is he was for brother branham he's as much god tonight as he was with mary said you're going to have a child behold and let me tell you he's the same god tonight as he was then and she began to contemplate and talk about this and wonder you know this rabbi was talking about all the great promises of god and how god made the promise how god didn't back up off the promise how they came through the red sea on dry ground and how before that god had promised he was going to deal with their enemy and the problem of god said god loves to deal with your enemy i say blessed be the name of the lord here's my enemy deal with my enemy tonight it's too much for me god but i'm asking tonight that you deal with my enemy he said how god loves to deal with the children of of of god's enemy right there and the rabbi no doubt may have taught about how god shut the mouths of the lions when daniel went to the den maybe he talked about the hebrew children how when they throw him in there was a fourth man there that met them in the fiery furnace maybe he began to talk about shamgar he was held year after year after year lived defeated he'd be overcome by the philistines and overcome by the blessings but one day he recognized that the god of abraham the god of jacob and the god of isaac was his god and he rose up in faith and he took everything that he had a knox gold in his hand and he slew 600 philistines oh he was telling her about the supernatural about how god is how david or yeah david took uh not david share now let me just find who i'm talking about now samson took a jawbone of an ass and beat down one thousand philistines and when he got done he was thirsty and took a drink out of that same jawbone began to tell about how there was a valley and had a bunch of dry bones and as we spoke about this morning and those dry bones began to come to life you know and how the enemy just god dealt with the enemy the whole time but brother branham would talk and he would just begin to tell he says but at the end of his message he ruined what he had been talking about when he said that those great days of jehovah dealing with the people like that it wasn't necessary no more oh my we don't have that same spirit here today oh the days of miracles is past god doesn't do those things anymore it was only for the prophet he says but you know she began to say he ruined his message because he said that god doesn't deal with with with people like that anymore it wasn't necessary no more they they become settled down in their homeland they didn't exactly need miracles no more they had good doctors for their sickness they were better off they had their homes they just didn't need a god of miracles anymore but somehow that didn't satisfy the thirst and hunger in joseph and mary and i pray tonight that it doesn't satisfy that hunger and that thirst inside your believing heart tonight oh let them say the days of miracles has passed that's fine for them but that's too late i've seen the god of miracles i've witnessed a god of miracles and he's as much god tonight as he will be tomorrow for your situation for your need he's very much the god of miracles but we find the same spirit today the same thing people say that the days of the supernatural are over they don't want prayer lines anymore they don't want altar calls anymore they don't want people coming to the lord anymore all they want is a dry-eyed confession all that they want is a letter an intellectual understanding of the message otherwise they camp down on formalism and they put the movement of the spirit out of the church because they don't want those whooping screaming acts 238 youngins but the prophet god said that's the only kind the word produces so if you ain't jumping you ain't shouting you ain't screaming it makes me wonder are you worried or not are you born of that same seed or not because that's the only kind that the word can't produce and i'm gonna tell you how bored of that same seed i got shouting inside my bones i got life inside my body i got something to shout about i know where i was headed and i'm here to tell you that voice came down and said turn your car around i ain't never been the same church and if god has done something for you i heard a brother the other day gave a testimony he said when he found out and realized that he was a son of god he said i could swing from the rafters and he looked out he says i don't understand how some of y'all ain't swinging from the rafters oh to realize you're sons and daughters of god got to know your place see they want to say that the supernatural was only for brother branham we shouldn't expect to see the same signs and wonders bingo so i ask you like what good is a god of yesterday if he's not god tonight what good is a god that can turn around and discern things with his back turn if he's not the very same god tonight now i'm not saying that we got to have that happen but i'm saying the god of miracles is still the same the prophet of god may be off the scene but god has never left the scene god has never left his people god is still here god is still in power god still has the authority and if you can believe that god tonight then there's nothing impossible with you he's the same god he's the same healer he's the same deliverer that he always has been so mary said you know talking to joseph since i heard the rabbi this great god that brought us here and made us what we are he doesn't have to do these things anymore like he did then she goes i've been thinking for a long time if this god was so great in the days of our fathers and in the days of our grandfathers then why isn't he just the same great god today and i asked you as believers you claim to believe god sent a prophet but more importantly you claim to believe that you're a son and daughter of god and if god was so great in the days of azusa if he was let's go even go further back to that if he was so great in the upper room and they staggered out like drunk men and three thousand gave their heart to the lord and we come down to our day in the restoration of the gifts and we sing souls after souls after souls receive the baptism our holy ghost if he's so great then why isn't he great today if he was so great in the 40s in the 50s in the 60s and blind eyes were open and the dead would raise and the sick were healed and situations were dealt with why isn't he the same god tonight it's because of the people's unbelief but i'm here to testify to you he's the same god and if you can believe tonight he'll bring forth your healing he'll bring forth your deliverance he'll come on the scene for your need he's still god he's still supernatural he still possesses authority and power over every demonic spirit oh hallelujah you know doubt she's pondering this my wife isn't god great why is it that we don't need him anymore why is it that we all have to just push play why is it we all got to get on the same scripture same verse same sermon and let's just do it at the same time i thought he was so good i thought every church was sovereign i thought this i thought that oh my oh brother joe you you you you're stepping out of your boundaries no sir i've been anointed i've been in order to preach the gospel the good news i'm going to tell you there's a good news tonight there ain't no headship over this bride the headship is jesus christ we're not looking at jeffersonville we're looking at the eternity we're looking to an eternal god and he's declared in his word i'm the same god i change not i'm the same yesterday today and forever if i ever heal once i'm gonna heal tonight if i ever delivered once i'll deliver you tonight and if the people can't believe nothing will stand before their prayer i said nothing will stand before your prayer if you can believe tonight if you can trust god tonight so she's walking going to the well to get some water pondering about the surface from the day before thinking about isaiah 9 for unto us a child is born a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace imagine this the days of miracles are passed right so how is god going to do this how is god going to bring this promised son what is god going to do we've been looking for it i guess we need to back off the promise when god ever gives a promise you never back off the promise she was thinking on this she raised up her little eyes she thought she saw a little flicker of light probably the guy was saying the little virgin perhaps rubs slowly you know how you do you think you see something and you maybe not a little reflection off of something and maybe it was her son reflecting off something and she just kept on walking pondering thinking about the scripture and when god put something on your heart he's ready to do something all right can i get an amen on him when god puts something on your heart he's ready to do something and maybe you're here this morning or this evening rather and something's on your heart maybe you have questions on your heart he's ready to do something maybe you're here tonight and you need healing or deliverance and it's weighing heavy on your heart he's here to do something maybe you're here this evening you've got a loved one on your heart in their way where maybe a son or a daughter or a situation but it's weighing heavy on your heart god is ready to do something because when god puts something on a believer's heart god is about to do something and i just wanted tonight if we can just press sin and believe that god will do what he declares he will do you will see the night the supernatural in our midst so bro joe i don't know how it's going to be mary didn't either she kept moving and walking and then she raised up her head again and all of a sudden stood this great light before and perhaps brother baby say the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel came walking from that light came this great art ain't our archangel gabriel and he said hail mary which means stop blessed are thou among women i mean god sent you an angel in this hour stop stop what you're doing stop where you've been going stop going to the denomination stop with all this out there because you're highly favored i got something special for you mary the present day mary i got something special for you i got a message for you inside of that womb is a promised son inside of you is going to bring forth life oh they said the days of miracles has passed but they don't know what i'm about to do let me tell you god has sent you a message and a messenger and he's about to do something one day these bodies are going to be changed well brother joe can you explain to me the scientific realm how my body is going to be changed no i can't but i know one thing god gave the promise and if god gave the promise god's got to keep the promise in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're gonna be changing and raptured in his presence so don't get so caught up in the things that's going on around us put your focus on the things above put your focus on the things of god so she saw this great angel and it started a little virgin and she stopped and he came closer and he saluted her and he gave her a message and he said that was a hard message for that child to believe for she wasn't nothing but a girl and he gave her something to believe that was more outstanding and hard to believe than anything that he had given anyone before oh brother joe you don't know my situation okay mary you're going to bring forth a child not knowing the man let's do the mathematics on that one oh that'll blow your mind you want to talk about immaculate conception but god dated the promise and if god gave the promise god's got to back up the word so he gave her something harder than anybody ever before her had to believe it's never been done before here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing a man no sarah was 90 years old before she can see but she knew abraham hannah she was old and waited for a child but she knew her husband but never before were there a woman to give forth life not knowing a man but yet god said it and god brought it to pass and he's as very much god tonight for your situation as he was for mary if you can just do what mary didn't say behold your handmaid lord be it unto me according to thy word i'll believe it i'll testify i'll proclaim this word though it may be strange to the ears of everybody else god i believe you tonight she didn't question it she said behold the hand made of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and if we could do just that that's the only thing that's what god loves that's the only way to get right with god is to take him at his word that's the only way that there is to please god is take him at his word don't trust in your knowledge your reason how can it be done it cannot be done he says and when you reason then you lose the victory how many you've ever reasoned yourself out of a promise well we don't want to admit that but we have what we all have we all have but it didn't mean that the promise is not there god gave the promise and a lot of times we allow a reason but the bible that's why he would put in there to cast down imaginations cast down every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god bring it into captivity every thought you got to bring that thought captive to the obedience of christ so mary took him at his word and he changed her whole course of her natural life he changed her whole course of her natural life and if he can do that for mary what can he do for this mary this marriage promised a rapture this marriage promised a body change never been done before but it don't mean that it's not going to be done oh but mary when is she beginning to testify what god what the angel just told her what about us oh we don't want nobody to know what we believe we don't want nobody know we're believing for a rapture we're believing for a body change we're believing like sarah she's going to be turned back and knowing all these things and yet god gave the promise and the bible to god said he will change the course of your life tonight if you'll take him at his word how many you gotta need tonight god will change the course of your life if you can take him at his word he says if you're a sinner he will straighten that crooked life of yours out if you're a vile immoral he will make you as pure as a lily if you'll just take him at his word if you got cancer tonight he will change that for you and give you health if you have tuberculosis or sickness or some kind of that the doctors cannot help he will change that for you if you'll take him and his word and this is his word i am the lord that heals all thy diseases that word all encompasses anything it encompasses cova 19 and it comes to anything they're going to throw at us in the future it takes care of everything sugar diabetes heart trouble high blood pressure i don't care what you want to put there he will cover all your diseases there's no reason for you as a son and daughter of god to back up off the promise when god declared he will do this for you if you can only believe if you will believe tonight you will see the supernatural you will experience the supernatural and if you can believe no matter how dark how despair your situation he will change your whole course of life if you can believe for healing you'll walk out of here a different person you don't have to walk out sick you don't have to walk out feeble you can walk out perfectly whole if you can believe for deliverance you can walk out no longer bound by oppression no longer living below your god-given privileges you can walk out victorious if you can believe if you can believe notice he says now how can cancer be cured when the doctors give it up it's not me to try to figure it out is take god at his word he was the one that made the promise and he's the one who has to confirm that promise he's obligated to the promise so god is obligated to the problems notice the problem god will tell us god doesn't have to heal just to heal but he has to heal to fulfill his word because his word declares him that he's a healer so why do we back off when our bodies are stricken in pain and agony and despair see mary she did not wait till she felt positive she did not wait till she felt life or some kind of physical sign you know how oh this just drives me nuts you know how these ladies these young ladies because some of you older ladies don't go through this anymore but when they get pregnant for the first time that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen let me tell you no fat lady sticks out her stomach like and says look at me but you let him get pain and get a little bump first thing they do is she didn't wait and stand in the mirror before she began to testify of what god was going to do she wasn't waiting for the baby bump she'd have been bumped by an angel that angel bumped into her on her road to the water and she said oh hell mary they are highly favored among women inside of you is going to bring forth life not knowing a man you're going to bring forth the supernatural and his name is going to be called jesus christ he's the king of kings the lord of lord he's a mighty god he's an everlasting father he's the brides i am and he's who i am tonight whatever your need is gotta meet that need tonight she didn't wait till she felt something she didn't wait till she saw a bump she went out testifying i bet an angel let me tell you i met a messenger oh i met a messenger let me tell you he came with a message not like anybody else to come before him oh he's not just a messenger he's a seventh angel and what did that seventh angel tell you oh he told me he took the seals off the back of the book i've looked in i see my name there he told me i come from god i'm going back to god i don't understand it brother joe all i see is generational curses but i'm going to tell you god buried those generational curses when they ripped the seals up and showed you your name you come from god you're going back to god god's word was good enough for her and she started rejoicing right away and if it was good enough for mary it's got to be good enough for us why wouldn't we want to believe the word why wouldn't we want our faith elevated notice now mary had to believe something that had never happened before no woman had ever brought a child like that into the world not knowing a man he said you take god at his word believe it anyhow no matter how impossible it looks to believe believe god he will bring it to pass and we find in mark 9 verse 23 through excuse me 23 jesus said unto him if thou canst believe then all things are possible to him that believeth and that's where i want to draw my context tonight all things are possible to him to him to him to him to him to him to him that will believe let me tell you this is not a man message this is not william brandon's message this is not brother ben's message brother joe's message brother tim donny put your favorite preacher there it's not their message this is god's message that he brought down we're just the angel we're just a servant that's bumping into the bride to tell her where she's going where she come from let me tell you and it's that today and if you can receive it like mary received it then you'll bring forth that same promised word and for your life problem said here in the possession the gate of the enemy said god is true to his promise no

mark 11 verse 24 what's everything you desire how many got desires on your heart tonight what's everything ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them now notice in this brother josh brought this out last night for those that were over brother jason's and i just couldn't help but steal it so i asked him this morning share it with me because it fit perfect in here and i was quoting it before he finished it i'm like oh why didn't you think about putting that in your sermon so i just stole it put it in here but he said now the word priest actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the conscience of men like a surgeon's knife he cut out diseases it set the captives free everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word with signs following not just jesus but everywhere those early believers went the word went with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out they spoke in tongues that was the word in action and he said that word has never failed in the mouth of believing christians let me tell you it ain't gonna fall tonight if i can get you to confess that word that god is able and he's bigger than your enemy no matter what you're going through if you can take that word on your lips tonight you'll see devils fall you'll see demons back up you'll see almighty god on display that word never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it has it is here stronger and greater than ever to the true word bride stronger and greater to the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to that word fill your mouth and your heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom oh be it unto me lord be it unto me lord i don't understand everything i don't know how you're going to figure it all out god but that word has never failed it's never failed now listen in the message the resurrection of lazarus brother would tell us he says now if we become in the spirit sons of god then deity dwells in the man you look at yourself in the morning you didn't get how many you looked in the mirror when you got ready y'all didn't we can tell it's okay you may want to buy one of those and look at mama that's me yeah but you get up in the mirror and you look when you got up and looked at it you wasn't thinking man look at that deity no you were looking oh man i'm losing my hair i can't get this thing to lay down you thinking man i don't put on some weight this dress honey doesn't stretch don't even answer and get yourself in some serious trouble oh we look at these things we don't think but the problem of god will tell us he said if we become the spirit sons of god deity dwells in the man then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible with god but god said nothing impossible with you that's a quote from your prophet we want to put it on god but god is putting it back on you tonight if you can only believe nothing is impossible tonight or we look at god and we see the supernatural but god is looking at his bride and he wants to see the supernatural oh hallelujah you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible with god god said nothing impossible with you if you believe not with god but with you deities in the man so next time when you get up in the morning i want you to look in that mirror and say good morning deity i got this covered my brother joe i don't want to i don't want to lift myself up no you didn't make yourself that now god made you what you are he said the very god that stood back there on the mystical or the mythical platform of the eternity and he's rolled the world off his hands and he created these things he give you the privilege to be his son oh and you're part of him and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity so i want you to look at your neighbor say hey deity oh you just felt uncomfortable didn't you because you didn't see deity you saw the natural but see if you can see the way god sees you can look through the eyes of of the spirit and not through the eyes of your flesh and not through the eyes of a finite man you look and look at your neighbor and your brother say you know what they've gone through a lot of hardships but that's deity because they're still standing when the devils threw this set up and they do that at them he told them they wasn't going to make it he's going to give up and just throw in the towel they're still there why because then he's in the man and that word holds on to the word and it trusts god no matter how they feel no matter what they're going through it hangs on to the problem and says being unto me god i don't understand why i'm here i don't understand why i'm going through this trial but oh god be it unto me tonight let the word be formed in me he says that same power that same christ hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them the people that deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost let that drop in your mind you think you're a little nobody you think you're a little coward down something you think well i don't know my position i don't know my place god said the same power that was in the creator that formed the world he said that same deity that did that is in you right here tonight so if that same power's here that same person is here that same deity is here then can't we create an atmosphere tonight can't we create an atmosphere tonight oh brother joe you don't understand i'm tired that's all right push through tonight deity's here it's here in your life it's here in your situation that i'm gonna press through tonight and gotta expect god to do the supernatural he said deities and man the very god that stood back there on that mythical platform of the attorneys rolled off of his hands and created those things he give you the privilege to be his son what a privilege we are given and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity and that same power that same christ hallelujah let the fundamentalists let the people who deny the power of god let them say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost men and women it's time that you found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back trying to tell you that you're some little coward down something you're not you're sons and daughters of god did he's not in heaven then he's in you tonight oh quit looking up to heaven looking at the next church great looking at your favorite preacher and look to you tonight did he's in hell it's in you tonight that same god that spoke the world he's living right there brother john he's in your heart so if that did he's there then we got a responsibility to take god at his word to believe and to call those things or not as though they are inside of each of you that's here tonight is the ability to change the situation how do i do it you pray and you hold god responsible to his word he wants you to pray and the prophet of god said he wants you to ask for big things because big things are just as easy to come to pass is small things he said don't limit your faith to these little mustard seeds oh let your faith loose tonight church notice now did he's not in heaven it's in you when you realize that almighty god lives in you he stood back there this is in the messenger deity jesus christ he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs oh bees ducks chickens animals created everything nothing was made but was made by him who christ the deity he brought down plagues everything in the days of egypt who christ he stopped the mouse of line he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword said they raised the dead from the grave who christ oh my what will it be who is he christ identity and he said brother sister that deity is in you that deity is in you tonight the ability to create he said it lays within every believer right now is the power to create another world and go live on it to create another world and go live on it remember god has a purpose you and that problem is going to get the answer that he's looking for you may not understand it god's not asking you to understand it god is asking you to believe it notice the bible tells us colossians 1 26 even the mystery which has been hidden from the ages from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god will make known his riches of his glory among the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you there's the mystery i'm afraid that the denominations don't get this oh because it's not for everybody it's for the predestinated for the ones that god foresaw god for knew the ones that god placed a seed on the inside before there was a foundation in the world that's the mystery but the bible tells us now that mystery is being made manifest because how because they can take that word through the seventh angels message and make that word manifest and say lord that's nothing but the truth how can we create squirrels it's not for you to create growth but hanny wright had the right answer oh i believe it that's nothing but the truth and when she said that the angel of the lord came down and said tell her she can have anything that she has she could have had money she was poor she could have had her sister here she was sick but what did she ask for the salvation of her boys because god knew that she was she was going to do with the promise and god knows what you're going to do with that same promise but come on hattie you got to have the right response to the word recognize the mystery of christ is in you almighty god to create our heavens and earth the universe is dwelling in you christ in you can overcome anything and everything that you face so if there is in you tonight then i say it's time we start believing i say it's time we start expecting i say it's time we start speaking you know how many we we we got a lot of negativity don't we well we found ourselves bumping into some kind of situation the first thing we don't go right straight to god no we go straight to our own flesh and we deny why me why did this happen and it always happens if i had any luck it'd be bad luck you know what i mean we how many has ever said that don't raise your hand you raise your hand back here don't do it let me finish i'll give you opportunity respond but that's our human nature some of us are more negative than others but god is asking you tonight put that negativity aside look to the word look to the promise look to what he's declared in this hour god is sending us the seventh angel look that's to do something for you to change your body to give you rapture and faith for rapturing grace because we're in the extreme hour and god is about to turn this thing loose and this bride is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye one day they gonna come knocking on your door and we ain't gonna be there oh what between six and nine in the morning they're gonna be calling you oh you're late for work no sir no where i'm going i ain't working out walking on streets of gold i'm dancing i'm praising god why because i met god on this side i received the message from the angel and it's impossible but i believe it anyway oh first john 3 and verse 1 says behold what manner hope y'all don't mind this kind of preaching tonight it's only kind of preaching i can do i'm not a teacher you realize that and he said yep behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now brother joe i don't feel like i don't care how you feel i'm not putting down what you're going through i don't care how you feel i'm telling you what the word says about you if you can take your mind off with how you feel take it off your situation and look to what the word says beloved now how many of you beloved when i don't fear beloved i'm going through this trial beloved now ephesians will tell you that you've been accepted in the beloved that's where you're accepted you may not be accepted in who's who in the greatest society oh the oh you'll be on the the chamber of hardy i mean really who cares to be on the chamber board of hardy who cares to be the most famous one in hearty ark so i don't care you shouldn't care but i'm gonna tell you tonight your name has been engraved on the palms of his hand he puts you in the lamb's book a lot and ain't no devil ain't no treatment ain't no temptation ain't no situation can't remove that name if you just recognize your sons of god beloved now you are the sons of god he ain't just putting anybody's name there he's putting sons and daughters name there and as a son you have the authority over the devil he says now the sons and daughters who has the most power before god what is an angel an angel is a servant but when i read this of course i read it many years ago and i was young in my faith how about did a cartwheel could have broke my neck but you realize you realize man god has made you a son brother dale i didn't make you a son you didn't make me a son you and i could have a fallen out you could put me in one day and put me out the next but god doesn't do that god doesn't operate the way we operate god doesn't draw the short end of the stick and say well i guess i'll take the leftovers no god before there ever was a world before there ever was a foundation god saw you he saw your need he knew that you'd be saved so he put your name there and now you are the sons and daughters of god and ain't nothing can remove that name ain't enough demon ain't enough trials ain't enough disappointments can't take your name off of that book he says now sons and daughters has some who has the most power before god an angel an angel is a servant that's right there is service what are you you're his son and his daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing beside him he said the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son a son has more authority than the servant of course but he says sometimes we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are after we become what we are then we forget how we got there well if you don't get anything out of this message tonight i want you to take home i'm a son and i'm a daughter of god i didn't put my name there no preacher put my name there the prophet didn't put my name there god put my name there and if god saw fit to put my name there that's declaring to me that no matter what i face on this side of attorney no matter what devil he throws against me no matter what sickness comes against me no matter what torment and spirit will come against me or my home or my family there's no way that i'm gonna be defeated i can't lose because god can't lose and god put it there and god don't make mistakes god knew what he was doing he didn't put your name there to lose you he didn't save you to lose you he didn't fill you with the holy ghost salute god knew what he was doing and so i say blessed be the name of the lord be unto me tonight father let that word be formed in my heart let the word have its way through my life let me manifest the true word of this hour so no matter how you feel no matter how significant you may think you are won't you ever forget your bride your bride bright bright bright bright bright bright and bright not just anyone can receive that distinction it's only for the predestinated and god has given you that's here tonight power over your enemy i don't know about you but there were some raptors in here i think i'd be swinging right now i got power i got power over complexes i got power over depression i got power over fears i got power over situations i got power over torment and spirits i got power oh brother joe well you know why is because you go to 10 pruitt's church it had nothing to do with tim pruitt tim pruitt didn't give me power jesus christ gave me the power jesus christ put my name on the book jesus christ declared me a son let me tell you that shame jesus is here tonight making the same declaration and if you can believe that same word of promise nothing will be impossible to you the problem says now we must believe he says you must believe what you asked for if you are a believer recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will if you have god the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe god because it's god and it's inseparable he says then if you have god's word in you and you have god's life in you you have god and you and whatsoever god's word speaks forth out of you it has to come to pass just like it was spoke from god when the believer takes that word places it upon his lips and speaks it's the same as jesus speaking oh come on church we talk about word of life oh you're talking about power over the enemy the authority over the enemy god has placed inside of you tonight that's hearing the sound of this voice god has given you that power and if you just take that name and you take that word and you take that promise and you're going to speak to your mountain your mountain has to move your mouth and has to hear your voice what's everything you desire when you pray you'll see god back that up he'll bankrupt heavens and earth just to make sure that that word don't fall to the ground he said do you realize if we go before god in the name of jesus is just the same as jesus himself praying oh my as far as i know everything that jesus asked for in the bible he got it's time we start asking but before you can ask you got to believe and before you can believe you got to expect so there's there's a there's a process we got to go through church but if i can get your faith to believe if i can raise that faith to yours up tonight to get you past what you're going through and you can look beyond at the end of your trial you'll see a supernatural you'll see a victorious son and daughter of god he says now and then we got to receive what we asked for because he said it and if god's own word it can't do nothing else but produce what it said god's word can't do anything else but produce exactly what it said but it takes having the mind that was in christ so mary didn't wait till she felt something positive she began to testify i'm gonna have a child you and joseph are not married yet i know that imagine the shame that was she was willing to bear for the promise imagine the shame my joseph and you decided to keep her joseph had to walk by faith as well because he was much tied to the promises mary was i had a brother write me soon after i preached that first message that i preached this morning but this was of course a while back he said brother joe i just had to write you to give you my testimony after watching the message impossible math he said i've received my healing from parkinson's disease which i've had for over three years yes the doctors proclaim that there is no cure for the disease look how simple it came when i viewed the complex math problem on the wall behind you i knew i couldn't touch it yet i knew and i believed that there was an answer to the problem it was then that i realized in my finite puny mind that just because i didn't have an have or understand the answer to the problem didn't mean that one didn't exist how great is our god that he loves to take the most difficult problems and saw them how that ought to increase our faith he says share this with the congregation because i'm about ready to dance my brother joe we don't like dancing in the church we don't believe in all that shouting we don't think you got to do all that we need to have church order now probably god said that you know what we need church order but we need to get out of order long enough to get saved so i'm telling you we don't went so far in that ditch of formalism that we can't shout we can't say amen we can't even nod our heads to the word of god let me tell you this man been delivered from parkinson's disease for three years the doctors gave him up they said he'd get to live the rest of his life but god supernaturally came down because he believed he believed that the word was for him and if you can believe tonight that same work is for you it can heal parkinson's it can heal cancer it can heal brain bleeds nothing's impossible with you if you can believe abraham says i believe every patient in the building right now would accept it upon the grounds of god's word and believing and start testifying and praising god for healing this meeting went close with one crippled person in here that's right god is under obligation let me begin to wind this up that first picture of sister atlanta have i ever showed y'all this picture i don't know if i have this is sister atlanta buzz you see the right side of her chest her lung stage four stage four non-hodgkin's cancer stage four see the date on the bottom of the picture is the pet scan 12 27 2017 stage four the pro the family was pairing are preparing for a long hard road that they didn't know should survive they were making preparations the father brother david happens to be my one of my very good friends here was he's got five children he's planning what happens if my wife doesn't make it next picture that's a mighty god that heals right there you see that the first one was 12 17. the second picture is 19 18. within two months our god came down and delivered stage four non-hodgkin's cancer next picture look at her now that's today her hair's grown back out a healthy a healthy daughter got why because she took god and his word and said yes i believe i'm leaning on the everlasting arm and if i can get you to lean on that arm tonight nothing will stand before you not even cancer he's still god he's still god next picture here's her sister mariah pruitt alopecia stripped all the hair off her head but she came with a little barrette oh and in a youth meeting that camp came through the prayer line she said uncle tim you see these barrettes i'm gonna wear these when i come through the other side oh she don't went to every doctor they couldn't help her they say it's incurable but let me tell you they hadn't met jesus because when she met jesus the next picture you'll see what god's able to do he's able to put hair back in the little girl's head why because she believed she believed the word of promise she believed nothing is incurable with god next picture look at her hair's growing out beautiful smile because she met god oh next picture this one may be hard to see this is sister karen pruitt she woke up to go to the restroom and experience had a severe headache brother tim decided to take her to the er because she already had a couple of brain bleeds before then and on the way to the hospital she began to vomit and get worse george she couldn't talk and she was unresponsive and due to cover 19 they wouldn't let brother tim back with her so brother timothy he called me said brother joe you work at the hospital do you mind getting up and going and praying for mom and you know just checking on and seeing what's going on so i decided to get up and i went and i stayed with her until they transferred to a bigger facility and i went to the doctor an er physician i said doc i said you know how bad is this how bad is this situation because she's already had two and his response to me was brother joe or not brother joe but he said joe he says she can live another five minutes or she can live another five years but if she does she will not have a quality of life pretty much at this moment she was in a vegetable state i went in and i laid my hands on and began to pray for uh not notice him but i put my hand on her head and it happened to be the side that had the brain so what happened she had a midline shift she had a brain bleed on one side and it filled up and pushed her brain over to the other side of her head and it made her unconscious or made her in the vegetable state but the family began to pray so we finally looked and the night before that i preached on the message god does impossible math and she told brother tim on the way home that night he said brother joe preached that for you not knowing what they were about to go through but god knows god knows how to elevate your faith god knows the deepest darkest hours that you're going to face and god's already provided and we find here after a few short days sister karen they did an emergency surgery brain surgery they removed all the blood from her and yet she was still unresponsive but within two or three days brother tim came in and he prayed he said god when i walk in that room i want her to respond to me and they have a little code they squeeze each other's hand three times i love you and he goes in there and he begins to talk to her karen can you hear me karen do you know i love you she's again squeezing his hands she was supposed to be in a vegetable state she was supposed to be unresponsive she was not supposed to have a quality of life but god began to move because they believed that the promise was for them and if you look at the next picture you'll see what god's able to do there she is at the virginia meetings shouting and praising god she wasn't supposed to walk she wasn't supposed to talk she's in her right mind no memory loss no motor is still not god is able to like church and he's just as much god for you and for your situation as he was for sister karen there's nothing that our god can't conquer let me say it like there's nothing our god hasn't conquered he's able he is able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or three and the greatest compliment that you can give god tonight is to take him at his word you don't have to figure it all out church god's not asking you to he's just asking you to believe mary couldn't figure it all out but she said lord be it unto me be it unto me according to your word and the prophet of god will say as soon as you hear the word of god that says you can be free believe it rejoice with it god will show the evidence after you've accepted it but first you got to accept i want the musicians come back god told the children of israel that they would he would take them out of egypt and take them to a promised land and notice 2 million people man when you got 2 million people you got a lot of you got a lot of personalities and you've got a lot of comments and you've got a lot of drama i mean we've got a church this size there's maybe 40 50 people here there's a lot of opinions floating around right now i wish he'd shut up i wish he'd be done i mean come on we already had one service we heard this this morning and when you got this but others are saying come on be it unto me lord feed it unto me lord and here moses goes out with 2 million not only 2 million women and children and men he's got animals and this that and the other you imagine trying to get all that and stay in a straight line and get to that destination and here they are they get down there and they get right to the red sea what a place to bring the children of god but i want you to know god knows what he's doing god had a trap set for your enemy god had a trap set for pharaoh and for all those that were following after him here they were they had mountains on this side and mountains on that side and pharaoh's army coming behind them and had a red sea in front but god already drawn a path he knew that one day he's going to bring his shooting right through here and if they can only believe i'm going to open up this sea and they're going to walk through on dry ground and god did just exactly what he said he would do god parted the seas he looked down through angry eyes i said god looked down through angry eyes tonight parts of season i met lord i'm at a place right now i can't go this way i can't go that way the enemy's behind me god i'm asking you to make a way i go through it god knows church god knows why you're here tonight he knows what you've been going through god's not surprised he didn't get to laodicea and it's all of a sudden say oh what am i doing but you know what happened they got on the other side of that red sea you know and there were some of those that tried to be all dignified well blessed god we made it oh that was a i was worried them walls were going to come crashing down you know how people get unbelief but all you know mary she was once she looked back all those taskmasters all those lies all those sleepless nights what is work gonna be tomorrow will i get beat like i've been beat today beat down depression oppression anxiety fears all these things but when she crossed to the other side and god said moses stretch out your hand now may the waters come coming back and mary began to see all those taskmasters that threatened her all these years oh said brother green you're not going to make it you might as well give up brother joe you might want to throw in the towel brother dale you might as well you know what it doesn't fit for you this message ain't for you she got on the other side and she saw those those task measures drowned in the seat she grabbed the tambourine and began to shout and begin to praise god why because she took god in his word she said god threw a path i'm walking down that path god made a way i'm gonna go god's highway i'm gonna i can't understand it how in the world these walls gonna open up but god provided because she believed and moses believed and they began to shout and they began to praise god he's a god of supernatural tonight church only if you can believe god he'll open up your red seat i said sister carla he'll open up that red sea you don't have to live in that condition god is able i'll tell you god is able tonight he's able to bring back your joy he's there to bring back to heaven he's able
