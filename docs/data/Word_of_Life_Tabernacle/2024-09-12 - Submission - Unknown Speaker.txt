praise in Jesus name amen amen James chapter 4 and verse one James chapter 4 and verse one we're going to won't be here on Sunday brother Joe Reynolds will be here we we will have two Services the Lord willing uh but brother Joe's going to be preaching and so I'm sure you're looking forward to that and some if you get a chance to go to to Oklahoma we'd sure be glad to have you up there as well at brother windows and pony Oklahoma looking forward to that meeting James chapter 4 and verse one from whence come Wars and fightings among you maybe you had a a war to get to church tonight and it was a little bit of a fuss and was hard to come where does that come from he said come they not hence even of your lust or your desires that war in your members said you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lust it gets pretty hard here in verse four you adulter adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US Le lusteth to Envy I love verse six but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble and this is a great verse for verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight on submission submission the word submission in the Greek is not uh to be conquered by an enemy and to give up that's not what submission is submission is voluntary it is a military term it means I put in a lower rank or I rank under I subject I put into subjection I subordinate myself I put myself into subjection so James is telling us you need to put yourself in the proper relation to God and then you begin to resist the devil and he will flee from you there's got to be something bigger than our thoughts there's got to be something bigger than what we think it's got to be there's got to be a higher or there's got to be an absolute there's got to be a reality of something that we can submit ourselves to and we find ourselves in in a great battle of of life and we find ourselves uh needing uh needing to to win that battle and we must win that battle the only way we can do that is by submitting ourselves to those that are above us and I'll say what I'm preaching about tonight is not submitting yourself to a man but submitting yourself to Jesus Christ who is our Major General and he's the one that's going to make help us make it through do you believe that tonight he he is the one that we submit to when uh General uh Eisenhower was in the second world war Eisenhower was a death jockey he he spent all of his time behind a desk he was never Under Fire actually until after he was a fourstar general he he never fought in the ranks he never he never come up that way Patton was very different Patton had fought and he had he'd come up the hard way and he he'd been right there with his men and he had much more experience in the field and Eisenhower did but when it come time to invade France to go on into Germany Patton had to submit himself or subordinate himself to Eisenhower not because Eisenhower had better ideas or or because Eisenhower was a greater person or because he was smarter or anything else you know why he submitted to him he had one more star on his shoulder than Patton did and we do not submit ourselves to God because because we understand God we don't submit ourselves to God because everything makes sense we don't submit ourselves to God because we can figure it all out we don't do that we submit ourselves to the word which just submitting ourselves to God and the reason we do it is because he outranks us he know he he he is God because of who he is that's why Patton submitted himself or subord himself subordinated himself to Eisenhower is because of who Eisenhower was and we ought to submit ourselves to God not because we understand what he's doing because many times we won't understand right we'll go through things that are seem like seem like torture and seem like there's no explanation and and I thought about the Joe was coming to preacher Sunday and how I think it's been 5 years since cherith passed away and I I I think about that tonight and I thought there's no explanation for that right you you don't understand it there's no way to wrap your mind around it why a 16-year-old girl would would pass away like that but yet we submit ourselves to God we said Lord though he slay me yet I'll trust him though though I don't understand what's going on in my life though it may look like it's a strange happening yet I know he outranks me and he outranks me for a reason if he made you that means he's got one more star on his shoulder than you've got now look he's got he he outranks me he outranks you he outranks prophets he outranks all of us so we submit though we do not understand always we voluntarily submit to God and fight our battles that way now Paul when he begins to talk about submission I want to lay a little bit of a groundwork here tonight but Paul said that the Jews had not submitted to the righteousness of God in Romans 10:3 for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness we've all known people like that that's legalism that's what the Jews were trying to do he said have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God so they're they're trying to in their by their own efforts to secure God's favor and there's no submission in that we're to submit to God and Paul tells us also in 1 Corinthians 16:15 we're to submit to those who God is using in verse 15 he said I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stefanus that it is the first fruits of aayah and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints I I wish that was written about me I really do I I want that to be my family I I want that to be us as a church that we've addicted ourselves to helping the Saints which is what Ministry is and verse 16 says that you submit yourselves unto such so if you see someone that is giving their lives for the gospel it's okay to be subordinate to that person listen to that person and and find out if there's a way you can help that person because they're doing that not of themselves but God has led them to do that and so he says to and to everyone that helpeth with us and labor so in other words it's not just to the pastor or somebody else but also those that help now we're to sub submit to the law of the land and this going to get touchy real quick but but we are supposed to submit to the law somebody said amen the Bible says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man an ordinance is a law for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king of supreme or unto Governors unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well he said for so is the will of God that was well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free he said not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness best the Servants of God I watched a a young man here this week get uh I saw it on the internet where he got uh stopped a young athlete he got stopped and and he couldn't figure out why they took him out of the car and put him on the ground well the truth is they did that CU he would not submit right he refused to roll his window down so they dragged him out of the car and everybody saying oh it's it's something bad going on some evil cops doing that no he just refused to submit to a lawful Authority and as Christians we have a responsibility to submit to lawful Authority now look brother Brandon's speaking about fire marshal laws and and he says this if we will not obey Caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey God that's pretty strong isn't it as long as Caesar's laws don't interfere with Gods he said we must must obey God first right we must obey God first but when when we can obey Caesar's law because it doesn't conflict with the law of God we obey Caesar's law random dealt with this in relation to game laws and I know it's the wrong time of year to talk about this but but maybe we should go ahead and and brother brand said this certain brother BR was talking about a young man he went squirrel hunting with I think this was Charlie Cox I'm not I'm not sure I think that's who he's talking about here brother brandom took six uh that he took six squirrels that day because that was the limit this young man this certain person said I got nine he said a chrisan boy fine kid I said you done wrong you did wrong I said if I come to this country preaching to you boys you people here the thing that's right he said I've got to live that example Christianity Christianity ain't what you say it's what you live what you do how many can say Amen to that today it's an example you're the salt of the earth again we're just kind of giving a background for where I want to go tonight night but he said then the law says Jesus said you give Caesar them things that belong to Caesar you break that speed law out there he said what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin give Caesar what's Caesar's and God what's Gods I don't always understand the speed law I don't understand why it's 55 out here at the highway when it ought to be lower because uh because of the trucks and things going down that Hill I don't understand that but we obey the law right there's places I don't understand why it's 55 when it should be 75 amen that's right but we obey the law right now look I I know I know that's the one thing you can preach and everybody's guilty but brother Brandon said well you say well the law is wrong I can't help what wrong it is he said it's wrong to break jesus' commandment and if you don't give Caesar the thing that Caesars and you did what Jesus told you not to do and the transgression of the law is sin and and I like this he continued on he said we're all guilty we do it right he said but when you see yourself wrong stop it the words don't do it on purpose submit yourself to the to the law of the land he said people are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you and see what you do or see your name in the paper right Romans 131 let every soul be subject to the higher powers for there is no power but but of god the powers that be are ordained of God you young people you children need to listen to this the powers that be whether they're parents whether they're School teachers whether they're deacons in the church those powers are ordained of God in other words God allowed them to be there because he could remove them in an instant if he wanted to so he said whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation he said for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wil thou then not be afraid of the power he said do that which is good and thou shall have Praise of the same for he is the minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the Minister of God Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil he said wherefore you must needs be subject that's the same word submit you must needs be in submission he said not only for wrath but also for conscience sake in other words because it's the right thing to do not just because of the penalty and you say brother man why are you preaching on this well Paul told Titus to preach on it Titus 3:1 he said put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no Brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men I think it's about time we preach the Full Gospel right you won't get as many amens or shouts preaching something like this but it's still the truth right we we know that there's a headship in the home wives are to submit to husbands Ephesians 5:2 two wiv submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the of the church and he is the savior the body therefore is the church is subject unto Christ so that the wives be to their own husbands in everything 1 Peter 3:1 likewise you wise be in subjection to your own husbands that word subjection again is submission he said that if any obey not the word they also may be without the word be won by the conversation of the wi so the husband's an unbeliever he said even if you never never tell them the word they can be won by the way you act according to the word he said well they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear fear there is not a terror but it's a respect yes brother Brandon follows that up and I always use this because I think it's an important quote brother brandom says a man's not supposed to use that authority over over a woman just because he's her ruler so he has Authority but he's not supposed to use it he's not supposed to use it in that way right just because he's her ruler it has to be an agreed thing submission is voluntary right and so it's got to be it's got to be going both ways now look he said if your wife he said God is her ruler above you brother he said if your wife is doing something wrong he said you got a right to tell her and she's supposed to listen to you but you haven't got got no right to beat her or drag her around or do those things he said no he said God Made Men a help make not adore can we say Amen to that tonight remember she was your sweetheart she should always be that oh God help us as men tonight to keep that word we want to see the word manifested in every way in our lives let that word be manifested husbands love your wives as Christ love the church if we want them to manifest submission we need to manifest loving he talks about servants to Masters so I move real quickly off of that we he talks about servants to Masters in 1 Peter 21:18 servants be subject to your Masters be subm in submission to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward words you're going to have bosses that aren't any fun you're G to have bosses a frow word man is a jerk whenever you see forward in the Bible that means he's a jerk that's right that's basically what it means it's a biblical term it's a it's or it's a it's a King James term for jerk and and sometimes bosses are jerks but you're supposed to still subordinate yourself to them my pastor used to tell me and and it was great advice he said your job is to make your boss Rich he said if you think like that you you you'll you'll be okay that's your job and so uh so we have to we we have to subordinate ourselves to what's going on in the company what's going on at work he he tells the younger to submit to the Eld he said likewise you younger submit yourself unto the Elder and I'll let you decide who's younger and who's Elder he said younger submit yourself subordinate yourself to the Elder he said yay all someone say all now here here's an interesting uh scripture he said all of you be subject one to another so in other words subordinate your interest to the interest of somebody else he said eternal life is living for others how many believe that tonight so subordinate your interest oh what kind of a church could we have if we submitted ourselves one to another subordinated our interest one to another he said all of you be subject to one another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble he talks about the church in Ephesians 5:21 right before he talks about he talks about women and submitting to their husbands and how men should treat their wives he says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God brother random interprets that this way he said submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor submit yourself to your congregation he said if a little click Rises up he said don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation right congregation maybe a good example of that would be if we were going to build a new building and we took a vote and the church voted it down right I wouldn't I wouldn't suddenly get with those who agreed with me and try to overturn it right that's not my job my job is to submit myself to the will of the congregation right that's what he told us to do submit yourself congregation he said if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God oh church and you say well why would I do that because God said to right and at some point it's got to become that it's got to be obedience because he's God yes all right are you with me now we're told that prophets submit to prophets right prophets just don't get to do what they want to do preachers just don't get to do what they want to do they have an area of authority and if they move outside that area of authority they're under someone else's Authority right if I go to brother wendles this weekend and preach a service I don't get to pick how many services I preach or or what kind of color the carpet's going to be or or whether they put Gatorade water on the pulpit or how loud the sound system is I don't get to pick that why because I subordinate myself to the the pastor that's there brother brandom talks about that in several places I didn't bring the quotes brother brandom actually talks about that we submit ourselves one to another I'm there I'm not there promoting our church I'm there to help his church and when he comes here he's not here to to promote his church he's here he's coming here to help us and and that way we all help one another right so we find that in that that Jesus is our example how many believe that tonight Jesus is our example in these things he submitted to his Earthly parents in Luke 2:51 it says he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them that's that word submit but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and and here's a remarkable scripture in 1 Corinthians 15:28 and if you ask for an explanation of this I may not be able to give you one or at least one that'll satisfy you but listen what he says about Jesus when all things should be subdued unto him he said then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all so even the son right which is the body Jesus is subject to God that's what he said in fact when he was here he said I do nothing L the father tells me right right and so we must submit ourselves to God and I know you're sitting there maybe thinking and and and I thought this is what occurred to me well how how would I submit myself to God well it begins in our thoughts we've got to subordinate our thought life to his thoughts and that could be uh subordinating oursel to the way way we dress the way we act the way we talk it could be subordinating oursel to his idea of what we are we could say I'm a loser but what does God say we can say I'm a sinner but what does God say we can say I I'm I'm never going to make it but what does God say submission is is subordinating yourself to the word of God I may not feel like I'm saved but I come God's provided way I know I'm saved not because I have a good feeling not because I shouted and run the aisles but I I I know I'm saved because I know I follow his prescription I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I know I've been born again I'm can say Amen to that tonight I don't know that because I feel like it tonight right cuz I may not feel like it every night we subordinate our thoughts to his thoughts oh that's what we ought to be doing tonight subordinating our thoughts to the word now look we might come into church and say well you know I I I I think that church would be better if we do this or I think that it'd be better if we were more like the denominations but we subordinate oursel to the thoughts of God that he expressed through a prophet in our age what are we doing we're submitting to God's word we're submitting to God's program you might say well I I wish something was different but what do we do he said the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds he said casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what is that that's subordinating our thoughts to his thoughts it don't mean we don't have any thoughts just means they're subordinate if we pick one to follow we pick his oh my look there's there's power in submission how many have heard the story of Georgie Carter yes Georgie Carter was one of the earliest miracles in brother bram's Ministry she was a woman who had TB there was no cure for it at that time and she had as actually as a little girl and and there are people you can find testimonies on the internet of people who knew her who who were not even Believers but who testified to that miracle and she was as a little girl she became bedridden and she was there as a young woman for nine years she was bedridden and she weighed somewhere between 40 and 60 pounds something like that and she was just a little sticks for legs and arms and she you know she was just barely hanging on and she couldn't get up she couldn't they brother brand said they couldn't even they had to lift her up to change the sheets because she couldn't even raise herself from the bed brother Brandon went and prayed for her he actually prayed for her twice and there's a long story associated with that but when he prayed for her the second time she got up out of her bed and she walked to the piano and began playing the piano and brother Brandon would tell that story he said she's my piano player at the mtown Baptist Church which is a little church that brother brandham come to one day and knocked on the door and there was no one there brother brandham actually opened a church in miltown Indiana and become the Midtown Baptist Church but that church that was there the building was already already there but he he reopened it but but here that miracle that happened it brought many people brought many people to God and some of them he said ask about Georgie Carter how did she walk brother brandom because he said it was impossible for her physically to walk how did she walk I said the power of the Living God held her up she just come listen submitted to the power of God now come on church sometimes we we wonder what's wrong why we don't get anything out of the services we wonder why sometimes the service seems like service after service say well I I have this need and I never got anything and maybe we're just holding on like Abraham and it could be but maybe we're just haven't completely submitted ourselves to the will of God yet right and if it is that maybe tonight could be the night you see it doesn't have to be a great big uh Revival or a meeting but tonight could be the night that I just fully submit myself to the word of God and when I do look what can happen I can have power that I didn't have to raise myself up Sir she had the power to raise herself up simply because she submitted to the power of God he said that's what's the trouble friends he said at night time when you see me your brother under Vision that's nothing else in the world but submitting myself to the Holy Spirit oh church when you look at that great gift and or great thing that was in brother brandom's life and you look at the calling that he had he said the only way I can operate that is by submission he said you that sick can submit yourself how many sick we got here tonight you got some illness in your body there's there's several of you I I think all of all of us old people could say that we're sick most of the time but but that's he said he said you sick people he said can submit yourself to the holy spirit so completely that you'll forget your sickness Hallelujah you can comp completely submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and no Affliction can hold you you thought I was going to talk about husbands and wives tonight didn't you I'm talking about submitting to God you can so completely oh church that's what I want to be every time I'm in the Pulpit every time I come and talk to somebody every time I get up in the morning I want to be brother Jeremy I want to be so full of the holy spirit so submitted to his will wherever he tells me to go I'll go whatever he tells me to do I'll do let me submit subordinate my own thoughts my own thinking to the thoughts of God he said you can be so so submitted to the Holy Ghost no Affliction can hold you he said you walk by the power of the Holy Ghost you're well you give your testimony everything else you're healed by the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he said you that's sinful we won't take a show of hands here he said maybe drinking smoke and Gamble and do things like that you'd say I can't give them up brother brandom huh you sit there at night late at night when you think nobody's watching and gamble on Sports say brother Ben is somebody doing that I have no clue if anybody's doing that I know people do that huh you're the sinful maybe drink and smoke you think nobody's watching and gamble do things like that you'd say I can't give them up brother brandom yes you can you want to know how just submit yourself to God one time one time is all it takes all it takes is one time in the presence of God and you can submit yourself to God and yield your whole self to God and watch what takes place one time you want to change what's going on in your life you want to change how it feels at home you want to change what's going on in the church submit your yourself to God one time and watch what takes place he said there's no secret in it it's not a Hocus Pocus see we don't have to work ourselves up into a frenzy we don't have to get all excited and run around the church that's wonderful if we do but let's do it because God's moving not not to try to make God watch us or see us no he already sees us he already cares he's already looking at your condition he just wants you to submit yourself to his word hallelujah he said that's the whole thing there's no secret in it it's not a Hocus Pocus the only thing it is is submit yourself to God hallelujah he said listen friends don't come saying well now if I feel real cold at one time they thought that was a sign of the Holy Spirit what it is is the air conditioner here well the Harvey's real cold right now I imagine but that's not because necessarily because because of the Holy Spirit you say the Holy Spirit could do that absolutely but that's not what we look for you come saying well if I feel real cold and if I get it the way sister got it he said that way sister got it don't you look for it that way you just come with a pure heart believing that Jesus Christ is the savior and you've accepted him and you believe God will keep his word and you're looking to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he'll give it to you how many believe that tonight he'll give it to you if you're looking to receive it you say Lord I I'll just anyway you pour it into me just so I get the Holy Ghost that's all I want is the baptism of the Holy Ghost give me something that will take this selfishness away give me something that will take all this fear and doubting away he said my Lord don't make me he said if you make me shout I've seen others shout and didn't live it don't make me speak with tongues Lord I've seen others speak with tongues and didn't live it but Lord put something in me that'll live in me that'll make me walk every day as a Christian is that your desire tonight he said that'll make me love my enemies yeah all right if you can't love your enemies it's a lack of the Holy Ghost yeah right that's right you say well I I got the Holy Ghost I know I was baptized the Holy Ghost but you need a refilling then till you love your enemies said that'll make me speak good of those who speak evil of me that'll make me ready to repent of anything that I do wrong come right up and confess it I'll say I'm wrong forgive me God he said that's the kind of Spirit you want isn't it he said yes sir make me humble when my pastor sees something wrong in me he walks around and says now brother or sister you ought not do these things make me humble say yes my brother you help me now to pray I don't want that kind of spirit on me he said you don't want that kind of a spirit do you you don't want to go around with a puff up saying well huh he had no business telling me I know where I'm standing oh he said oh when you do that friends you can see right then you're not you're out of the will of God you can see you're wrong to begin with why you didn't subordinate yourself to God you say Lord I can't see it but maybe there's something there I'll go check it out right you don't have to you don't have to uh do things that aren't in the word of God but submit yourself to the word right he said why not be humble and submit yourself to the Holy Spirit some of our young folks you know sometimes you just have to be told and there's no other way to know unless somebody tells you and you can't get mad at somebody for telling you right that's the only way you're going to know you have to learn right and so I would say just look at it like this Lord help me to be humble help me not to to to respond in a way that that that well I think well I just discount that that was just that guy but Lord help me to help me to examine myself and see is there's something there why not be humble and submit yourself to the Holy Spirit yes I'm going to lock armed with the whole Church of the Living God I'm going to move on with the whole Church of the Living God I'm going to move on Hallelujah brother BR said God could ever get a man or woman today in this Tabernacle or anywhere else that's us tonight anywhere else that'll pay no attention to what's going on around them but submit themselves to the Lord as an individual unit right then that don't matter what everybody else does but for me in my house I'm going to submit myself to the word of God that's what Abraham had to do when lot left him when everybody around him left him he said I'm going to submit myself to the word I believe even though the years get longer and longer I believe I'm going to have a baby cuz God said so he submitted himself to the word and that was identified as faith in his life he said God could ever get a man or woman in this Tabernacle or anywhere else that'll pay no attention what's going on around them is submit themselves to the Lord as an individual unit God will lead the same man to today that he led then he said he proves that he's with us hallelujah what we need today is a humble submitted life submit yourself church when we when somebody criticizes us where our first our first answer isn't to hit back at them but to say Lord help me to examine myself and see is that right if it's not I'll just let it go but if it is right help me to correct myself because I want to be right said well I'll wait and find out what this is and he said what he said I mean back up a little bit he said submit yourself don't don't squeeze yourself back don't do nothing but lead straight with the Holy Spirit what the spirit says do do quickly you know why because you may not ever get another opportunity to do it if the Holy Spirit leads you to do something do it quickly right make sure it's the Holy Spirit but if he leads you to do it do it quickly don't say well I'll wait and find out what this is and that is what the holy spirit says do go do it he said what if I hadn't went to Finland when the Holy Spirit called me over there what if I hadn't went to the hospital yesterday that little baby was laying there dying hadn't went and I love the fact that this is before brother brandham goes beyond the curtain of time but when he does they tell him this they said if you hadn't have went we wouldn't be here oh Church we don't realize what obeying the Holy Ghost can do just obeying the holy ghost in a service just to to say Amen to lift our hands to worship God to do what God says do maybe to come to an altar maybe you don't need to be saved maybe you don't even need to be filled but there's something in your heart drawing you to come to the Altar and you come what it might break open the whole service why because there's a power in obedience brother Brandon said obedience is better than sacrifice do what the holy spirit says do yes yes how many of us could use more peace in our lives well the rest of you doing good I'm going come to your house we live in a chaotic age listen what brother brandham says about that he said what a peaceful day it'll be for the brandham Tabernacle or any other church or any individual when they'll forfeit their rights to become a lamb come back to a lamb come back to be gentle come back to know nothing that's hard to do isn't it knowing everything we know about the message but knowled knowing the message is not going to get you in right you don't get a free go to jail free or get out of jail free card you go to jail free you can't get out of jail free you don't get a get out of jail free card get out of hell free card because you because you uh know more about the message message and everybody else that's not how it works the devil knows the scriptures all right he knows this message he wouldn't be able to twist it like he does all right he knows the message he knows the scriptures but what is it he can't submit himself to it oh church he said don't try to know nothing he said just walk me meekly quietly humbly gently and the dove will lead you he said but whenever you go to listening to that gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up when it's amazing what we I identify as godliness and it's not at all all right just temper yeah all right you so I had a man say one time said I'm like Moses I smoked the Rock and Moses didn't enter the promised land because of it too Jesus was the only one who ever did something like that he took the Whip and and fogged them but I've said it before I'll say it again if I tried to do that I'd be in the flesh there'd be somebody there I fogged a little bit harder than everybody else but Jesus didn't do that he did what the father told him to do he never sinned because he was perfect amen I'm not perfect and so I'm not going to blame it on God when I get mad are you are you listening to me now whenever you go to thinking you got a right to do this and do that the dove just takes their flight and goes on away he said then you don't have it anymore right that's a striking statement but your life is as if the Holy Spirit was not there it's not that he leaves you but brother brand said he waits in the Gable end of your soul it loses its effect on you he said then you don't have it anymore now she's not very far from you this morning church she's sitting right out there on the limb of Peace waiting for your nature to be changed he said what you need today is to submit all your rights is to let God lay you down oh I say God lay me down today and shave all your rights off of you he said could you imagine how a little old lamb old fleece oh fleece hanging over him imagine a lamb's pretty skinny when you see a lamb that looks really fat usually it's just the wool right and that's his job to Bear wool but he's got to let himself be shorn somebody's got to shave it off and so he said the fleece hanging over him that's his rights right the wall is his right he says he said uh he said yeah he said pant pant pant it's a little old sheep you can't hardly walk I got my rights brother Ben yeah you do but You' be a lot more comfortable if you give some of them up we don't like to hear that as Americans do we but what about his rights see we're subordinate to Christ old lamb walk around I can't hardly breathe I got my rights eventually your rights are going to kill you it's going to get so hot you're going to fall down not be able to to move anymore because you got so many rights that you've kept I got my rights to do yeah you're within your rights burning up he said and then just lay up on the shearing table they know what's best for him amen take all of his rights away from him Shear it all off how cool and light he runs oh it's easy to get to church the next service why he let all his rights be shaved off oh church that's what we need you say well I want my rights no I want his rights I want to stand for his rights the rights of the Lamb the the Lamb of God not my rights oh my take all his rights away from shear it all off how cool and light he runs my my he's happy jumps around and has a big time it's hard church it's hard to to you said out here in the world I saw a person the world's gone crazy we saw a person riding a bike today and Peter told me he said that I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman Peter said that's a boy he said he come to my class when I was in high school wearing a dress and I and my first thought I can honestly say today and sometimes it's not God forgive me but my first thought today was to have compassion on the kid probably Peter's age and I thought you know just the world that we live in they don't even have a chance and you know what could help them yeah but they won't listen to laugh you out of the room church we don't want to be like that so arrogant that we think we know what's best for us God knows what's best for us he knows what he knows it's best for us to lay down on the table but we fight it and that's how we end up in those kind of situations that's how the world ends up in that kind of situation not because they don't know not because they never heard the gospel many times but because because they refuse to submit to the gospel and the world has refused to submit to the gospel and I say today it'd be worse actually to be in church and be somebody maybe you look good on the outside but you got a hard heart I'm preaching to myself tonight but I I'm preaching to all of us you got a hard heart and you're unwilling to submit to God's word you'd be better off to be out there and have never known than to be in here and be hard about it all right I say God help us tonight yes I don't want to be hard I want to submit myself to God yes amen he said you become a he said Ma's happy and jumps around has a big time yes sir if you'll forfeit your rights that's what you get but you got to forfeit your rights let the word of God shave all the world off of you take all the habits of the world away you become a new creature in Christ brother BR said to know the word's not life but to know him is life to know him you don't have to be a scholar you have to be a submitted person I know and we're going to have a questions and answers at some point because I know some of the things I preach on is hard for the young people to grasp and I don't want it to be that way I want you to understand what I'm saying maybe sometimes I say things wrong I realize that I do that but if I do and you have a question just write that into me I'd be glad to try to answer that the very best that I can maybe we'll gather some of them up and answer them because other people may have the same question but but now he he talks about uh being submitted to Christ and to know him it's not what you know whether or not you can understand everything we talk about whether you know the ins and outs of the third poll whether you know the ins and outs of the Seven Seals that's not what gets you closer to God what gets you closer to God is actually your submission to the word of God it's what you do know so Mark Twain said he said it's not the parts I don't understand about the Bible give me trouble he said it's the parts I do understand right it's the ones we don't submit to that's what gives us trouble brother brandom said you have to be a submitted person when you submit yourself to Christ Christ is obligated to fill that vacancy that you poured out on the altar to him so don't think you won't have anything when you leave but he's obligated to feel that vacancy he said he's obligated to fill that vacancy that you poured out on the altar to him he's obligated to his word to do it I love this he will not fail you how many believe that tonight you can say I know he will never fail me he will not fail you Hallelujah he wants to partner with you he wants to be one with you brother Brown said the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life is just submit yourself to God and walk in the spirit see just day after day how he will lead you and do things the Bible says to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity it's enemies of God it's enmity against God it's fighting with God right he said and it is not subject to that same word submit it's not in submission to the law of God neither indeed can be right so then they that in the flesh cannot please God yeah so how can I please God then how did Noah please God by faith yes how did Abraham please God by faith yes sir the BR said Abra if you can catch it he had faith in God which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man right I love that it's so simple but faith is what unites the spirit of God with the Flesh of man he said there's where the faith come there's why he could be the Abraham SE said not all flesh but the uniting of spirit and flesh together god making himself tearing out rooting out all evil don't you want that tonight bringing in into submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner oh church that's what I want that's what I want I want I want him to live with I I can't make it on my own I can't be in submission the carnal mind cannot submit itself to God but if I have his Spirit if I believe that that brings the spirit and the flesh together the uniting of the spirit and the flesh until I'm in submission until there's a control tower in my soul that tells me what to do and I learn to obey it even Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered I wonder if we couldn't learn a little bit of obedience he come to the world sinless and he never sinned while he was in it oh church yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered I don't think we ought to kick too hard against the Pricks say Lord I submit myself to you I you said brother Ben you don't know what I've been through well none of us know really what the other ones been through right but we know who God is we know who Elohim is we know who the creator of the universe is and if we submit ourselves to him he'll take care of us yes it'll be okay as the musicians come in 1873 there was a lady by the name of Phoebe nap played a tune for Fanny Crosby who was blind she asked her she said 'what does this music say to you and Fanny Crosby was submitted to the spirit of God and she immediately and she remember she's blind she had it hard in life they her and her husband were both blind they lost a baby because they couldn't see and it got covered up by blankets and died that's tough be hard to get over that but she was submitted to the Holy Spirit and she said' whatat does this music say to you and Fanny Crosby immediately says Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine heir of Salvation purchase of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood what was that submission to the will of God for her life oh my one time she said if I could get my eyes back she said if I was offered my eyesight wouldn't take it because I wouldn't be who I am oh Church she looked at it as a blessing in the end perfect submission is the next verse perfect Delight visions of rapture now burst on my sight a blind woman but she was seeing with some other sense beyond the five senses beyond the Sens of sight Angels descending bring from above Echoes of Mercy Whispers of Love perfect submission all is at rest I in my savior am happy and blessed watching and waiting looking above filled with his goodness lost in his love and she cried out this is my story this is my song praising My Savior all the day long she could do that can't we do that tonight can't we submit ourselves as the scripture says to the father of lights and live you hold on to that Grudge you'll die hold on them rights you die you get too hot you won't be able to make it you'll just fall over but if you'll just let yourself be sheared of those things say this is my story I'm going to I'm determined to to repeat what God says about me no matter what circumstances going on in my life I wonder if there's anybody like that here tonight I I'm determined not to give in to the moly grubs I'm determined not to give in to what Satan is whispering in my ear I'm determined why perfect submission brings me to a place that I can hear from God and God will tell me you are my the heir of Salvation the purchase of God born of his Spirit washing his blood they we play that softly while we bow our heads together [Music] oh [Music] God looking at that boy today and I thought oh if I could only tell him there's a God who can change you but people don't they don't want to hear the fact it becomes hate speech if you tell them you need to [Music] change it becomes a a culture where the word of God is absent submission to God is rare but let me be the outlier tonight let me be one who can who can say I believe help thou my unbelief and I believe Lord that you want to unite yourself with me and in doing that I can be your servant and I can submit myself to others submit myself to church and and when you go to church I'm not telling you to submit yourself to me as a person but when you go to a church you're submitting yourself to that church and that Pastor when you go into the deacons and the leadership of the church when you when you believe this message you're submitting yourself to the leadership of the message of the hour when you're a Christian you're submitting yourself to the leadership of Christ that's what we really want cuz everyone else can be be wrong but Christ will never be wrong always be right
