[1:02:10] morning isn't he good to
[1:02:12] us he just done so much for us in the
[1:02:15] meetings and we just uh I want to say
[1:02:20] thank you to everyone who helped and uh
[1:02:23] we heard uh brother Daryl Ward on
[1:02:26] Thursday night preached God's
[1:02:27] undefeatable Eternal purpose yes my
[1:02:31] goodness brother Andrew preached on the
[1:02:33] Vindicated method of
[1:02:35] God brother Shawn preached on possessing
[1:02:38] our inheritance by our words brother wle
[1:02:41] preached on the authority of the sons of
[1:02:43] God last night wasn't that wonderful
[1:02:44] last night my goodness
[1:02:47] I I think we ought to be able to just
[1:02:49] speak and see it happen right in front
[1:02:51] of us we should be able to tell that
[1:02:54] mountain to move and we are able are we
[1:02:59] willing just do it that's all we've got
[1:03:01] to do and I believe the Lord really
[1:03:04] helped some people last night in the
[1:03:06] prayer lines I I just really believe
[1:03:08] that I you say well brother Ben why is
[1:03:11] that necessary I don't have to go to a
[1:03:12] prayer line to get help that's true but
[1:03:15] we're human beings and sometimes we need
[1:03:17] to feel that presence and we need to
[1:03:19] know somebody's praying and and there's
[1:03:21] a reason why he said lay hands on the
[1:03:23] sick sometimes you need that touch and
[1:03:26] God uses the hands of men brother
[1:03:27] brandom even talked about how anointed
[1:03:29] men had that that they showed that there
[1:03:31] was light in in their hands and that we
[1:03:34] don't understand all of that but we know
[1:03:36] that God uses that so we believe that
[1:03:39] people were helped last night we're
[1:03:41] going to have a a baptism at the end of
[1:03:43] the service today uh brother uh Jaden
[1:03:47] Jones is going to be baptized this
[1:03:49] morning and uh so right after the uh
[1:03:52] service what we do here our baptistry is
[1:03:55] in the fellowship hall so at the end of
[1:03:57] the service once we're through
[1:03:59] worshiping and everything we'll just go
[1:04:01] straight there and do that and then of
[1:04:03] course we'll have lunch at the
[1:04:04] fellowship hall um I just want to thank
[1:04:08] all the churches for coming and and uh
[1:04:11] brother brother Ben's brother Ben beard

[1:04:35] people from Brother Wendell's that come

[1:04:52] good what a masterpiece of a sermon we

[1:05:00] sister Mariah and Malachi coming we're
[1:05:02] glad to have them with us and each one
[1:05:05] I'm sure I've forgotten people folks
[1:05:07] here in the
[1:05:08] church listen the scripture says by this
[1:05:12] shall all men know that you're my
[1:05:13] disciples if you have love one to
[1:05:15] another and I believe you've shown this
[1:05:18] week that you are the Disciples of
[1:05:21] Christ and and by your love for the
[1:05:23] people of God and thank you for that the
[1:05:25] deacon trustees ushers parking
[1:05:27] attendants prayer line helps some of
[1:05:30] y'all worked hard last night and and
[1:05:32] Cooks cleaning everyone who pitched in
[1:05:34] the whole church thank you for that
[1:05:37] brother brandom said if there's anything
[1:05:38] I can contribute to the success of my
[1:05:40] meetings too he said is to know that
[1:05:43] people have a conscience to know that I
[1:05:45] love people so I think the success of
[1:05:47] this meeting is that the people know
[1:05:49] that you as a church love them and so
[1:05:51] they feel that they want to come and God
[1:05:53] bless you for doing that the church up

[1:15:02] unto them he was received up into heaven
[1:15:06] and sat on the right hand of God and
[1:15:09] they went forth somebody say they went
[1:15:11] forth they can I tell you who those they
[1:15:14] are the disciples and they went forth
[1:15:19] and preached everywhere now watch this
[1:15:22] the Lord working with them and
[1:15:25] confirming the word with signs following
[1:15:29] aen now if we go to the book of St Luke
[1:15:32] the 9th chapter St Luke chapter 9 and
[1:15:35] verse one we're going to identify who
[1:15:38] the they are of this St Mark 16 in Luke
[1:15:42] chapter 9 and verse number
[1:15:44] one the Bible said then he called his 12
[1:15:47] disciples together and gave them power
[1:15:51] and authority over all devils and to
[1:15:53] cure diseases
[1:15:55] and he sent them to preach the kingdom
[1:15:58] of God and to heal the sick now they are
[1:16:03] disciples who have been commissioned or
[1:16:05] they've been sent now if you're going to
[1:16:07] be sent you got to have something to say
[1:16:10] when you go in the book of St Luke the
[1:16:12] 17th chapter we will find what those
[1:16:15] disciples have been commissioned Amen to
[1:16:17] preach and St Luke chapter
[1:16:20] 17 and verse number 26 the Bible says as
[1:16:24] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[1:16:27] be also in the days of the son of man
[1:16:30] they did eat they drink they married
[1:16:32] wives they were given in marriage until
[1:16:34] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[1:16:37] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:16:39] all now likewise also as it was in the
[1:16:42] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[1:16:44] bought they sold they planted they
[1:16:46] builded but the same day that lot went
[1:16:49] out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:16:51] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:16:53] all now here it is even thus shall it be
[1:16:57] in the day when the son of man is
[1:17:01] revealed so the disciples will be
[1:17:03] preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:06] we ask Lord this morning to add the
[1:17:08] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:17:10] you can have your seats this morning I
[1:17:11] want to uh by the help of the Lord for
[1:17:13] just a few moments to speak to here and
[1:17:16] if I title this today I just want to
[1:17:17] speak to you on disciples clothed in the
[1:17:21] son of man
[1:17:22] Revelation disciples uh clothed in the
[1:17:26] son of man Revelation now uh you all
[1:17:28] know this morning that another word for
[1:17:30] clothes amen would actually be the word
[1:17:33] garment the prophet of God comes in the
[1:17:35] seventh seal 1963 and he says now we can
[1:17:38] see the elements are ready to bring the
[1:17:41] church into the presence of Christ he
[1:17:44] said we can see the bride taking form
[1:17:47] amen putting the wedding garment on
[1:17:49] making ready amen we can see the bride
[1:17:52] taking on the form she's putting on the
[1:17:55] wedding garment she's making ready I'll
[1:17:58] say this it took a prophet to identify
[1:18:01] amen the wedding garment to the church
[1:18:04] and he says it like this he said now see
[1:18:06] the wedding garment is the baptism amen
[1:18:09] of the Holy Spirit now you all know amen
[1:18:12] that when a prophet comes he is a
[1:18:14] bringer amen or a Divine revealer of the
[1:18:17] word so when a prophet comes he will
[1:18:19] bring word but he will not bring any
[1:18:21] kind of word but rather he will bring
[1:18:24] authoritative word now when you look at
[1:18:26] that word authoritative it means able to
[1:18:28] be trusted as being accurate or true it
[1:18:31] is reliable it is very likely to be
[1:18:34] respected and obeyed so in other words
[1:18:36] amen whatever a prophet brings among the
[1:18:39] church amen it's not going to have a
[1:18:41] question mark over it but it's going to
[1:18:43] have an assurance with it that what's
[1:18:45] being brought and what's being said and
[1:18:47] what's being taught amen is able to be
[1:18:50] trusted now brother B tells us that
[1:18:52] there's actually two kinds of word among
[1:18:54] the church he said there is
[1:18:55] authoritative word he said then there's
[1:18:57] unauthoritative word he said if we got
[1:19:00] God's word and know that it's the truth
[1:19:02] then we can be persistent Amen brother
[1:19:05] and move right on in because God said so
[1:19:08] that's the reason I've always depended
[1:19:09] on that I don't go in myself I go when
[1:19:12] he tells me amen I stay right with his
[1:19:15] word I don't go to the right or to the
[1:19:18] left I stay right with it amen and
[1:19:20] that's the reason he blesses it amen no
[1:19:23] matter how the devil tries for
[1:19:25] everything in front of you amen you say
[1:19:27] you put your church if you be this but
[1:19:29] you stay with it amen because God
[1:19:32] promised it it's his word amen stay with
[1:19:35] it it's authoritative word amen of
[1:19:37] almighty God can I say this to every
[1:19:40] believer Amen in every assembly
[1:19:42] represented amen stay with the word amen
[1:19:46] stay with the word and stay on the word
[1:19:49] amen don't move to the left or to the
[1:19:51] right or to the back or to the front
[1:19:53] amen stay on the word of almighty God
[1:19:56] and anything that's an authoritative do
[1:19:58] not believe it he said I don't care who
[1:20:01] said it amen do not believe it now amen
[1:20:04] I believe that one of our scriptural
[1:20:05] promises for this age amen is that the
[1:20:08] son of man would be revealed according
[1:20:10] to Luke 17:30 he said the day when the
[1:20:13] son of man is revealed now when you look
[1:20:15] at that word revealed amen it means to
[1:20:18] uncover or to lay open what has been
[1:20:20] veiled or covered Amen to disclose to
[1:20:23] make known to make manifest Amen to
[1:20:26] disclose what was before unknown amen so
[1:20:29] at one time the revelation of the son of
[1:20:32] man was disclosed amen it was unknown
[1:20:36] rather it was covered up amen but this
[1:20:39] is the age of the unveiling amen it's in
[1:20:42] the Book of Revelation that the time is
[1:20:44] at hand Amen to unseal the Saints of
[1:20:47] this book brother said we want to keep
[1:20:49] it right as close as we can with the
[1:20:51] Lord amen and with his word amen because
[1:20:54] we see his word is unveiling itself amen
[1:20:59] day by day day by day in the church age
[1:21:03] book he said now the Greek word for
[1:21:05] Revelation amen is apocalyps which means
[1:21:09] unveiling he said now this unveiling is
[1:21:11] perfectly described Amen in the example
[1:21:14] of a sculpture who is unveiling his work
[1:21:17] of staty Amen exposing it to the
[1:21:20] onlooker it is an uncovering it is a
[1:21:23] revealing amen of what was previously
[1:21:25] hidden he said now the uncovering is not
[1:21:28] only the Revelation amen of the person
[1:21:31] of Christ amen but it is the revelation
[1:21:34] of his Future Works Amen in the oncoming
[1:21:36] seven Church ages amen so this
[1:21:39] Revelation amen is moving from the head
[1:21:43] amen into the body amen as God unveils
[1:21:46] his word he is bringing the authority of
[1:21:49] the holy word into the Church of the
[1:21:51] Living God let me say this I refuse Amen
[1:21:54] to back off of the preaching amen of the
[1:21:57] revelation of the son of man I know guys
[1:22:00] have gone out in left field and they've
[1:22:02] taught things that should have never
[1:22:03] been taught they said things that should
[1:22:05] have never been said amen but listen
[1:22:07] because there's a hypocrite at Walmart
[1:22:09] you don't stop going to Walmart and
[1:22:11] because there's a hypocrite at
[1:22:13] McDonald's you don't quit going to
[1:22:14] McDonald's and because there's been
[1:22:16] scarecrows around amen the Glorious
[1:22:19] divinely revealed mystery truth it will
[1:22:22] not stop the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:25] from moving into her inheritance as the
[1:22:27] Sons and Daughters of God listen what
[1:22:29] we're preaching is not backed up by a
[1:22:31] seminary it's not backed up by
[1:22:34] denomination amen as a matter of fact if
[1:22:36] the denomination had their way amen they
[1:22:38] would silence every message preacher
[1:22:41] they would lock the doors of every mes
[1:22:42] church amen but I want to say it's been
[1:22:45] 50 years amen and there's still a voice
[1:22:48] amen of the message of the hour because
[1:22:50] heaven backs up this message the Angels
[1:22:53] back up this message the power of God is
[1:22:56] with this message that's why we stand
[1:22:58] here this morning and say this is more
[1:23:00] than just a religion this is more than
[1:23:03] just an idea amen this is amen the
[1:23:07] disclosing of the mind of God in the age
[1:23:09] you're living in now 1964 brother Ram
[1:23:12] comes along and he preaches a sermon
[1:23:14] called the unveiling of God he said now
[1:23:17] my subject this morning amen is to
[1:23:20] reveal or unveil that God he said now
[1:23:23] see he come you all know these things
[1:23:25] you've heard them all weekend amen he
[1:23:27] comes in three sons names amen the son
[1:23:30] of man the Son of God and the son of
[1:23:32] David he said he came first as the son
[1:23:35] of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel
[1:23:37] and the prophet son of man he never
[1:23:40] referred to himself amen as Son of God
[1:23:43] he referred to himself as the son of man
[1:23:46] amen because the scriptures cannot be
[1:23:48] broken in Deuteronomy 18 the Bible says
[1:23:52] amen that God would raise up a prophet
[1:23:55] amen Laing unto Moses now I know it's
[1:23:57] such a debated subject anymore amen but
[1:24:00] let's just go ahead and give the devil a
[1:24:01] black eye amen we are not following a
[1:24:04] man we are following the God of all
[1:24:06] prophets amen now the Bible said that
[1:24:08] Jesus was a prophet amen raised up
[1:24:11] likeing into Moses right okay then let
[1:24:13] me ask you this amen the Bible in
[1:24:16] Revelation 19 says that the spirit or
[1:24:18] the testimony of Jesus Amen is the
[1:24:21] spirit of Prophecy you know why we got
[1:24:23] so much confusion is because people amen
[1:24:26] have made the prophet the God Amen and
[1:24:28] they've got God following the man amen
[1:24:31] but let me reverse that for you this
[1:24:33] morning amen the pillar of fire amen was
[1:24:36] not following William brandham amen
[1:24:38] William brandham was following the
[1:24:39] pillar of fire because it was the return
[1:24:42] of the unveiling of the Living God come
[1:24:45] on we ought to be the happiest people on
[1:24:47] the face of the Earth this morning for
[1:24:49] the first time in 2,000 years we can
[1:24:52] preach every verse in the Bible and not
[1:24:54] have to dismiss one line we can read
[1:24:57] acts and Genesis and exodus and Hebrews
[1:25:00] and we can say it's the truth come on
[1:25:02] somebody say Amen somebody say well
[1:25:04] y'all are falling a man amen I'll prove
[1:25:06] to you the nominations is Fallen a man
[1:25:08] amen cuz you ask them why the women are
[1:25:10] cutting their hair and they'll tell you
[1:25:12] because some Theologian amen told them
[1:25:15] Corinthians didn't have no value today
[1:25:17] so they're following a theologian go ask
[1:25:20] them why they're baptizing in titles and
[1:25:22] they'll tell you because some man said
[1:25:24] said you ought to baptized according to
[1:25:26] Matthew
[1:25:27] 28:19 but there is a bride on the earth
[1:25:30] this morning who is following every word
[1:25:32] of God with an authority behind it
[1:25:36] remember between the Son of God and the
[1:25:38] son of David he would come as the son of
[1:25:40] man amen fulfilling the rest of the
[1:25:42] scripture now I just want to take a
[1:25:44] moment here and read to you some quotes
[1:25:46] Amen in a yearly order amen of the
[1:25:49] prophet's Ministry concerning the
[1:25:50] revealing of the son of man 1958 if you
[1:25:53] get time to listen listen it's a very
[1:25:55] powerful tape he's called the called out
[1:25:58] he said now Jesus said when the son of
[1:26:01] man is revealed from
[1:26:03] Heaven the son of man is now being
[1:26:06] revealed from heaven will it come after
[1:26:08] a while brother brandom it is now he
[1:26:11] said the son of man has already come
[1:26:14] from glory and is revealing himself for
[1:26:16] the past few years Amen to his church in
[1:26:19] Mercy amen showing them his great
[1:26:22] presence doing the same things that he
[1:26:24] did when he was here on the earth amen
[1:26:27] revealing himself like he did to Abraham
[1:26:30] amen before the destruction it is the
[1:26:32] rising of the sun he said now who is the
[1:26:35] son of man in the beginning was the word
[1:26:38] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:26:40] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:26:42] dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching
[1:26:45] that we have Amen in confirmation of the
[1:26:47] word of God by word of God by Signs by
[1:26:50] wonders we see today in Luke 17:30
[1:26:53] Malachi for and the different scriptures
[1:26:56] we are acquainted with amen that the
[1:26:58] word again is waved over the people so
[1:27:01] the revelation of the son of man amen is
[1:27:04] the waving of the word over the people
[1:27:07] that the Dead traditions of man is dead
[1:27:10] and the Son of God is alive again with
[1:27:13] the baptism of the holy spirit amen and
[1:27:16] he is right Among Us and he is giving us
[1:27:19] life 1964 when their eyes were open he
[1:27:22] said when you see the sun of man
[1:27:25] revealed amen the word come back in
[1:27:28] human flesh 1964 the voice of the sign
[1:27:31] he said the son of man is prophesied to
[1:27:34] be revealed and what kind of a
[1:27:36] revelation will it be it will be the
[1:27:39] revelation of his living after being
[1:27:41] crucified for 19900 years that he is
[1:27:45] raised from the dead and is alive with
[1:27:48] us amen revealing Christ in the promise
[1:27:51] of the age can I give you one more amen
[1:27:53] now watch in the day when the son of man
[1:27:55] is being revealed amen a son of man amen
[1:27:59] Jesus Christ made manifest among his
[1:28:02] people if you are looking for the
[1:28:05] revealing of the son of man then you've
[1:28:07] missed it because we're not looking for
[1:28:09] it amen but we're looking at it amen can
[1:28:12] I say this amen when you come to this
[1:28:15] prayer line last night you were not
[1:28:17] coming to be touched by a man but it was
[1:28:19] a manifestation of the revelation of the
[1:28:23] son of man in the age you're living in
[1:28:25] listen if you're looking for something
[1:28:27] then that means you ain't found it but
[1:28:29] if you found something you quit looking
[1:28:31] for it and you start looking at it well
[1:28:34] we might as well preach it Sunday
[1:28:36] morning amen you quit looking for it and
[1:28:38] you start looking at it somebody say
[1:28:40] well amen I'm looking for the bride's
[1:28:42] Revival well I'm sorry I'm looking at it

[1:28:53] looking for the message I'm looking at
[1:28:55] the message come on Church you all know
[1:28:57] I'm in the message I'm in the message
[1:28:59] recognizing your day and its message and
[1:29:01] the prophet of God said he said now
[1:29:03] listen they're saying fast and pray amen
[1:29:06] fast and pray amen you all realize that
[1:29:09] they're good people
[1:29:11] right amen they're good people but a
[1:29:13] prophet said the reason they're in the
[1:29:15] condition they're in is they have missed
[1:29:18] the Awakening of the Bride I was just
[1:29:20] out the other day in California and we
[1:29:22] actually went down Los Angeles down
[1:29:24] there to the isusa street and you go
[1:29:26] down there and actually we went over
[1:29:28] there about I think it's about 5:00 in
[1:29:29] the afternoon and brother Jesse they had
[1:29:31] a building there and we went knocked on
[1:29:33] the door about 459 they had already
[1:29:35] locked the door you know well I thought
[1:29:37] it was a zza street Museum and I really
[1:29:40] wanted to see it you know so we knocked
[1:29:42] on the door and the guy come the door
[1:29:43] and he said now hey he said y'all want
[1:29:45] to come in I said yeah so we go in there
[1:29:47] brother Joe Adams and some PE some
[1:29:49] Believers from St Marcos was with us so
[1:29:51] we walk in there well I'm thinking we're
[1:29:53] going in the museum him and brother Ben
[1:29:55] little and I know we was going in a
[1:29:56] Prayer Tower now they had three they had
[1:29:59] three banners at the front door they had
[1:30:01] a sign that said the first Pentecost
[1:30:03] which was Acts two they had another sign
[1:30:05] that said the second Pentecost which was
[1:30:07] 1906 OFA then they had another banner
[1:30:11] and it said we are building this prayer
[1:30:12] tower for the prayer of a third
[1:30:14] Pentecost he said now look it will come
[1:30:17] out of Asia and they had this board
[1:30:19] there and they had all these people
[1:30:21] screaming and hollering and praying so
[1:30:23] we signed in you know and amen a few
[1:30:25] minutes later he said now there's a
[1:30:27] restroom here and there's a water
[1:30:28] fountain here and The Prayer Tower is
[1:30:30] back there you know and I thought there
[1:30:32] Lord what have I got myself into amen so
[1:30:34] we walk in there and I'll be honest with
[1:30:36] you brother Caleb you walk in there
[1:30:37] they've got a they've got a building
[1:30:39] just like this they got a platform they
[1:30:41] got instruments and they have somebody
[1:30:43] around the clock amen playing and
[1:30:46] singing and they're praying for another
[1:30:48] Pentecost listen brother Joe I'm not a
[1:30:50] crazy man but as I sat there in that
[1:30:53] building and watch that I heard the
[1:30:55] voice of brother random in the back of
[1:30:57] my mind say they're good people and
[1:30:59] they're Christians and they feel the
[1:31:01] pull of the hour but the reason they're
[1:31:03] in this condition is they were looking
[1:31:05] for a prophet but a prophet was standing
[1:31:08] in front of them listen and here we are
[1:31:10] in
[1:31:11] 2024 and they've gone back to isusa
[1:31:13] Street and they're trying to pray up
[1:31:15] another move of God but over here on the
[1:31:17] side of the road in Hardy Arkansas it's
[1:31:20] some Holy Ghost Field fire baptized
[1:31:23] believer and there's Revival fires and
[1:31:26] they're burning this morning I want to
[1:31:28] say the Revival is not coming the
[1:31:30] Revival is here and the Revival is in
[1:31:33] the revelation of the son of man in the
[1:31:36] power of his resurrection yes sir it's
[1:31:40] not an angel it's Jesus Christ he's the
[1:31:43] one you're feeding
[1:31:47] onen the son of man is cist see you're
[1:31:50] not feeding on a man his words will fail
[1:31:53] but you're feed meing on the unfailing
[1:31:55] body word of the son of man brother man
[1:31:58] preaches this sermon and he says Christ
[1:32:01] is revealed in his own word he said so
[1:32:04] the whole Bible somebody say the whole
[1:32:07] Bible it's not the word of the man isn't
[1:32:10] that good neither was it wrote by man or
[1:32:14] brought by man and neither can it be
[1:32:17] revealed by man that's powerful right
[1:32:20] there the Bible wasn't wrot by man it
[1:32:23] was brought by man and neither can it be
[1:32:27] revealed by man it's God's word revealed
[1:32:30] by God himself his own interpreter amen
[1:32:34] Christ revealing himself in his own word
[1:32:37] see then what is it the interpretation
[1:32:40] amen belongs to God he said may God open
[1:32:43] our blinded eyes to a scripture promise
[1:32:46] to know that we are living in the last
[1:32:48] days you say preacher I bet that felt I
[1:32:51] bet seeing that made you feel pretty
[1:32:52] high and mighty as a matter of fact it
[1:32:54] made me want to find somewhere and cry
[1:32:57] my eyes out Amen to thank my God that he
[1:33:00] would come to the hills of East
[1:33:02] Tennessee and claim an old come on
[1:33:05] church he would claim a Kentucky boy in
[1:33:07] the hills of Kentucky and that message
[1:33:10] would come to Tennessee it would come to
[1:33:12] Arkansas sister Roberta it would come to
[1:33:14] Missouri it would come to Virginia it
[1:33:16] would come to Ohio it would go to
[1:33:18] Louisiana listen there is a bride of
[1:33:20] Believers around the world and a man has
[1:33:23] not gathered us a preacher has not
[1:33:25] gathered us but the son of man revealing
[1:33:28] has gathered a body of Believers come on
[1:33:31] Amen I'll just goe and say it amen the
[1:33:33] day you don't think you need this
[1:33:34] message is the day you might as well go
[1:33:36] to a Baptist Church because without this
[1:33:39] message we're another group of people
[1:33:41] with another building another tithing
[1:33:43] account another musician but if we have
[1:33:46] this message we got a right to shout the
[1:33:48] shills heart we got a right to praise
[1:33:51] God because the message of the hour
[1:33:54] is our
[1:33:56] Authority let me say it like this I
[1:33:58] wouldn't know Ben prit and Ben prit
[1:34:00] wouldn't know me if it wasn't for this
[1:34:02] message have you ever thought about that
[1:34:05] Amen brother Ben you wouldn't know me
[1:34:06] and I wouldn't know you if it wasn't for
[1:34:09] this message but one message has brought
[1:34:12] the East to the West it's brought the
[1:34:14] North to the South it's brought
[1:34:16] continents together what is saying to oh
[1:34:19] I feel good right now I'm saying don't
[1:34:21] you ever forget the message message of
[1:34:24] the hour is the reason we're here the
[1:34:28] message of the hour has United us and
[1:34:30] you know what I say I say devil get out
[1:34:32] of the Church of the Living God get out
[1:34:36] of our fellowship get out of our
[1:34:38] Brotherhood get out of our meetings get
[1:34:40] out of our homes you didn't do it so you
[1:34:43] can't stop
[1:34:45] it yes sir God does the revealing now I
[1:34:49] say to you like this God does the
[1:34:50] revealing and we do the following in
[1:34:54] other words if there's something amen
[1:34:56] done then there is a reaction to the
[1:34:58] action can I say this Christ is the
[1:35:01] revealer and we are the followers the
[1:35:04] prophet of God said you have to do
[1:35:05] something to cause something to follow
[1:35:08] it now listen we're not just following
[1:35:10] something because everybody else is
[1:35:12] going this way we are following this
[1:35:15] word amen because the action was the
[1:35:18] revealing of the son of man and the
[1:35:20] reaction was the quickening of a seed
[1:35:23] amen to follow the Revelation in the age
[1:35:25] you're living that's why Jesus stood
[1:35:27] there and he said these very powerful
[1:35:29] words he said if a man will come after
[1:35:32] me then let him deny himself and take up
[1:35:35] his cross amen and follow me look at
[1:35:38] this word follow it is to join one as a
[1:35:42] disciple amen or to become or to be his
[1:35:45] disciple so when Jesus Christ
[1:35:48] commissioned you amen and called you to
[1:35:50] follow him he was not asking you amen
[1:35:53] just to be a church member he was not
[1:35:55] asking you just to be a campground
[1:35:57] Christian he was not asking you just to
[1:35:59] hold an office in a local assembly but
[1:36:02] he was calling you Amen to join him in
[1:36:05] the Great Commission of Mark 16 and to
[1:36:08] become one of his disciples brother said
[1:36:12] the leadership of God is amen follow the
[1:36:15] Vindicated word of the hour amen by the
[1:36:18] Holy Ghost can I say this to you we have
[1:36:21] been made amen Disciples of Christ in St
[1:36:24] John 8:31 Jesus said if ye continue in
[1:36:27] my word amen then are ye my disciples
[1:36:31] indeed brother R comes along and says
[1:36:33] the disciples today is a lot different
[1:36:36] from the Disciples of old amen the
[1:36:38] Disciples of old amen they brought the
[1:36:41] Seeker into the presence of God but the
[1:36:44] Disciples of the day amen bring them in
[1:36:47] the presence of the church or some
[1:36:49] organization or some affiliation or some
[1:36:52] Creed or some Doctrine instead of
[1:36:55] bringing them into the presence of
[1:36:57] Christ now can I stop here and say this
[1:36:59] I know there's been a lot of contention
[1:37:01] Amen on the point of a prophet's quote
[1:37:04] where he said my Ministry is to declare
[1:37:06] him that he is here but can I say the
[1:37:09] only reason why there's contention on
[1:37:11] that quot is because in his presence is
[1:37:14] where his promises are fulfilled so if
[1:37:16] the devil can get you in the presence of
[1:37:18] a Creed or a Doctrine or an affiliation
[1:37:22] then you'll just be another lukew leoty
[1:37:24] and church member but if you can by the
[1:37:27] message of the hour move into the
[1:37:29] presence of Jesus Christ in his presence
[1:37:32] is the fullness of joy in his presence
[1:37:35] is the power of God under salvation I'm
[1:37:38] talking about the presence of Jesus
[1:37:40] Christ in the reality of his
[1:37:42] resurrection that's why I say to you we
[1:37:45] oh god well it's here I might as well
[1:37:48] preach that and then guys take quotes
[1:37:50] and they just twist them and use them
[1:37:52] however they want to and they say well
[1:37:54] we're getting people to Christ or to the
[1:37:56] message and not to Christ y'all know me
[1:37:58] well enough to know that I'm just a
[1:38:00] country boy and don't really know how to
[1:38:01] say things right so I'm just going to
[1:38:02] say it the way I think about it that's
[1:38:04] the dumbest thing I've ever
[1:38:06] heard we're getting them to the message
[1:38:08] and not to Christ that's like saying
[1:38:10] we're getting them to McDonald's and not
[1:38:12] showing them Ronald
[1:38:14] McDonald come on Church he's the focus
[1:38:17] of the
[1:38:18] restaurant and if you made something
[1:38:20] else the focus of this message it's not
[1:38:23] the message the problem you're the
[1:38:25] problem this message is not William
[1:38:27] Brandon it's not any preacher this
[1:38:30] message is Jesus Christ then how can you
[1:38:32] get somebody Amen to the message of the
[1:38:35] hour and not get them to Jesus
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:39] Christ well it's a truth anyhow so that
[1:38:43] makes two types of disciples that makes
[1:38:45] a true disciple and a false disciple I
[1:38:48] want to I want to read you something
[1:38:49] here in Christianity disciple primely
[1:38:52] refer primarily rather refers to a
[1:38:55] dedicated follower of Jesus this term is
[1:38:58] found in the New Testament only in the
[1:39:01] gospels and the acts in the ancient
[1:39:04] world Amen a disciple is a follower or
[1:39:07] an adherent of a
[1:39:10] teacher discipleship is not the same as
[1:39:14] being student in the modern sense listen
[1:39:17] here a disciple in the ancient biblical
[1:39:19] World actively imitated both the life
[1:39:23] the teaching of the master are you ready
[1:39:25] for this it was a deliberate
[1:39:28] apprenticeship which made the fully
[1:39:30] formed disciple a living copy of the
[1:39:34] master oh Church of the Living God so a
[1:39:37] disciple amen was a fully formed
[1:39:40] disciple but they were a perfect amen
[1:39:43] copy of the master so however the master
[1:39:46] acted was the way the disciples would
[1:39:49] act however the master conducted himself
[1:39:52] it's the way the disciples will conduct
[1:39:55] themselves can I say this amen if the
[1:39:57] master went to church the disciples will
[1:39:59] too if the master believed in preaching
[1:40:02] the disciples will too if the master
[1:40:04] believed in the Supernatural then the
[1:40:06] disciples will too I might as well
[1:40:08] preach if the master believed in
[1:40:10] forgiven then the disciples will too if
[1:40:13] the master could go through hard times
[1:40:15] and still stand as a fully formed amen
[1:40:19] stature of the Living God then so can we
[1:40:23] as disciples can I say this disciples
[1:40:26] are to be leaders amen that how do we
[1:40:29] lead amen we lead by what we're
[1:40:32] following the Bible said be ye followers
[1:40:34] of me amen even as I also am of Christ
[1:40:38] brother picks this up and he says before
[1:40:40] me amen believe me as I teach you of
[1:40:43] Jesus Christ Paul said be followers of
[1:40:46] me as I am of Christ there might be man
[1:40:49] come through here everything drops
[1:40:51] through here these critics not only here
[1:40:53] but everywhere they have all kinds of
[1:40:55] this and that and the other I know it
[1:40:57] Christian friend but that don't take
[1:40:59] away from the real if a man speaks and
[1:41:02] God confirms what the man said you
[1:41:05] haven't got any right to doubt him if a
[1:41:08] man speaks and God doesn't speak with
[1:41:10] him then you got a right to doubt the
[1:41:12] person amen because that's just a man
[1:41:16] can I say this we are not denominational
[1:41:19] disciples the Disciples of Jesus Amen
[1:41:22] took them to Jesus a Methodist disciple
[1:41:25] takes him to the Methodist a Baptist
[1:41:28] disciple takes him to the Baptist a
[1:41:30] Pentecostal takes him to the Pentecostal
[1:41:32] but a disciple of Christ amen will take
[1:41:35] them to Christ and Christ will take them
[1:41:37] to Calvary amen there's the real thing
[1:41:40] let me just go ahead and knock another
[1:41:42] devil out the message of the hour was
[1:41:44] not the replacing of Calvary it was the
[1:41:47] revealing of
[1:41:49] Calvary come on church amen they had so
[1:41:52] watered down Calvary and denomination
[1:41:54] last Calvary it almost lost any effect
[1:41:57] over the human life but a Prophet come
[1:41:59] Among Us and he said now this may be a
[1:42:01] strange sermon in the middle of
[1:42:03] September in the year of 1960 and it's
[1:42:06] not even Easter morning but I'm going to
[1:42:08] preach to you on that day at Calvary and
[1:42:10] I'm going to tell you what Calvary did
[1:42:12] it whipped every devil it brought
[1:42:14] eternal life into the reach of every
[1:42:17] Christian you know what I say I say say
[1:42:19] what a prophet said about Calvary he
[1:42:21] said it's a place of trans
[1:42:24] it's a place of death it's a place of
[1:42:26] killing self- desires and receiving the
[1:42:29] revelation of who God is yes sir amen a
[1:42:33] disciple of Christ will take him to
[1:42:35] Christ and Christ will take him to
[1:42:37] Calvary that's the real thing I love
[1:42:39] what David says he said blessed be the
[1:42:42] Lord amen who daily Loth us with
[1:42:44] Benefits amen even the god of our
[1:42:47] Salvation now you all know that another
[1:42:49] word amen for benefit is privilege right
[1:42:52] amen and privilege is a special right it
[1:42:55] is an advantage it is an immunity
[1:42:57] granted or available amen only to a
[1:43:00] particular person or group it is a right
[1:43:04] it is an advantage it is an entitlement
[1:43:06] it is a Birthright it is freedom it is
[1:43:09] Liberty can I just take a moment and say
[1:43:11] something to you church it's time to
[1:43:14] remember the
[1:43:16] benefits listen it's time to remember
[1:43:19] the benefits you say benefits yes sir

[1:43:24] we're not looking for but we have the
[1:43:27] revealed word can I say this we don't
[1:43:30] just have it amen but we are following
[1:43:32] it and you all know right now we're
[1:43:34] living in a nation where they're divided
[1:43:36] on who has the most privileges do the US
[1:43:39] citizens or the illegal immigrants or
[1:43:41] does this race or this denomination am

[1:44:13] foundation of the world if anybody got a
[1:44:16] liberty if anybody got an advantage if

[1:46:17] is behind that name well sometimes I
[1:46:20] think we ought to remember what a
[1:46:22] glorious Revelation our water baptism

[1:46:27] of the name of God on the redeemed flesh
[1:46:30] of the human and put him in position to

[1:53:28] From the days of guest workor are over
[1:53:31] we're not guessing about our
[1:53:33] destination neither are we guessing
[1:53:35] about what we're
[1:53:38] wearing neither are we guessing about
[1:53:40] what we're
[1:53:42] eating neither are we guessing about
[1:53:44] what we're doing come on Church there's
[1:53:47] been a message come among the church and
[1:53:49] it has broke the backbone of the
[1:53:51] confusion about heaven and a prophet
[1:53:53] stood on a platform and he said Heaven
[1:53:56] is a real
[1:53:57] place brother Ben Heaven it's a real
[1:54:00] place let me say to you tonight amen
[1:54:03] Heaven is a real place let me say this
[1:54:06] but the revelation of Heaven did not
[1:54:08] come into existence until the opening of
[1:54:11] those Seven
[1:54:13] Seals now come on somebody say well amen
[1:54:16] stay away from preaching that Rapture
[1:54:17] Amen brother Joel why would we stay away
[1:54:20] from preaching the Rapture you know why
[1:54:21] if we was a bunch of Pentecostals and we
[1:54:24] were preaching the Rapture brother Tim
[1:54:25] it would shut the meat and Plum down
[1:54:27] those people have all kinds of fear and
[1:54:30] all kinds of scare I don't know if I'm
[1:54:31] going to make it I don't know if I'm
[1:54:33] good enough amen but you watch an eagle
[1:54:35] meeting you watch a bride meeting amen
[1:54:38] you start preaching about the Rapture
[1:54:40] and you watch the praise going into
[1:54:42] another level you watch the shouting and
[1:54:45] the rejoicing you say preacher amen why
[1:54:47] does the preaching of this message take
[1:54:50] the Rapture oh God take the Rapture
[1:54:53] subject and move the church into a
[1:54:54] higher praise because we're not
[1:54:56] worshiping and believing under
[1:54:58] condemnation but a prophet has come
[1:55:01] among the church and said you are the
[1:55:03] sinless you are the Spotless you are the
[1:55:05] Justified bride of Jesus Christ it's as
[1:55:09] though you'd never even done it in the
[1:55:11] first
[1:55:12] place have we forgot who we are have we
[1:55:15] forgot we're not going back to some
[1:55:17] beerly amen ralistic elements of
[1:55:20] corruption we have come from the ch of

[1:58:21] there when up CH got out of the
[1:58:23] wheelchair I was there when he preached
[1:58:25] the Seven Seals and because I was there
[1:58:28] is why I'm here and because I'm here is
[1:58:31] why I'm going back
[1:58:33] there and there ain't no devil going to
[1:58:36] stop me
[1:58:37] now yes
[1:58:41] sir I'm carrying authoritative
[1:58:44] word now look when this authoritative
[1:58:47] word affects your life when this
[1:58:49] authoritative word affects your life you
[1:58:52] become a disciple of
[1:58:55] it you lo you lose everything you leave
[1:58:58] everything else brother Daniel to follow
[1:59:01] the revealed authorita word you become a
[1:59:05] mouthpiece for Vindicated word you
[1:59:08] become a voice for the voice of the word
[1:59:10] of God why because you're a disciple now
[1:59:14] listen how do you become a disciple you
[1:59:16] became a fully formed disciple of what
[1:59:19] you're following can I say this Lazarus
[1:59:22] in John chap 11 he was sick and he died
[1:59:25] and the Bible said that Jesus come and
[1:59:28] said these words he said now he's
[1:59:31] dead and they thought he was taken
[1:59:33] asleep but Jesus said he's dead for your
[1:59:36] sake and I'm glad I wasn't
[1:59:40] there brother Sean I'm going to go down
[1:59:43] there and see if I can get him
[1:59:46] up I'm going to go down there and see if
[1:59:48] I can say something loud enough to wake
[1:59:50] him up I'm going to see if the revealing
[1:59:53] of those seven Thunders will wake the
[1:59:55] bride
[1:59:57] up no he didn't walk down there under
[2:00:01] guesswork he walked down there and
[2:00:04] brother Miguel he said I go wake
[2:00:08] him brother find me one bit of guesswork
[2:00:11] in that statement find me one ounce of
[2:00:13] psychology in that statement find me one
[2:00:16] ounce of I hope I think I feel find me
[2:00:18] one evidence of it you won't find it
[2:00:21] because it's not there
[2:00:22] the only thing that's there is the
[2:00:24] authority of the name of Jesus Christ in
[2:00:27] the power of the resurrection and Jesus
[2:00:30] walked down there and the pr of God said
[2:00:31] he didn't say I'll go and see if I can
[2:00:34] I'll go and make a Triad it but I'll go
[2:00:37] and wake him for he knew come on
[2:00:41] disciples if you're going to be a
[2:00:43] disciple of the revealing of the son of
[2:00:44] man you got to stop walking with I think
[2:00:47] it'll work I hope it'll work I'm going
[2:00:49] to take a guess at it hey this is
[2:00:51] another meeting so I'm going to go and
[2:00:52] see if I can keep the victory this time
[2:00:55] no you are a disciple which means you
[2:00:57] are fully formed in the image of the one
[2:01:00] you're following and when he walked down
[2:01:02] there he said come out of the Grave
[2:01:06] Lazarus listen because God had showed
[2:01:08] him by Vision that Lazarus was going to
[2:01:11] come forth amen out of the Grave there
[2:01:13] wasn't no guesswork and any time that
[2:01:17] God shows a vision of what's going to
[2:01:19] happen it's going to be exactly the way
[2:01:22] if the vision's from God it just has to
[2:01:25] be let me just go ahead and drop this in
[2:01:27] here you have already been seen in a
[2:01:31] vision come on now amen can I show you
[2:01:34] something remember remember Friday night
[2:01:36] that Mark 16 came after the resurrection
[2:01:39] remember those words came after Jesus
[2:01:42] had lived died buried and raised again
[2:01:44] now watch Lazarus amen can I can I can I
[2:01:47] just can I just break something into to
[2:01:48] you you imagine Jesus Walks down there
[2:01:51] and here's a man fellowshipping maybe
[2:01:53] with Abraham with Ezekiel with Sarah
[2:01:56] with some of the old Patriarchs and here
[2:01:58] the Lord walks down there and brother
[2:02:01] said he had to say Lazarus because there
[2:02:03] was so much power and authority in that
[2:02:05] voice that if he would have just said
[2:02:07] come forth he said he would have called
[2:02:09] the entire graveyard forth so here I
[2:02:13] felt that one too Miguel are you hearing
[2:02:15] me here's Lazarus and Abraham and
[2:02:18] they're talking and they're
[2:02:19] fellowshipping and all of a sudden oh
[2:02:22] are you hearing me if he would have said
[2:02:23] come forth Abraham would have got Sarah
[2:02:26] and Lazarus and they would have all
[2:02:27] walked out of there but it wasn't time
[2:02:29] for a chance so he specifically reveals
[2:02:33] one name and says Lazarus come forth and
[2:02:36] the prophet of God said a body that had
[2:02:38] been laying there for 4 days he said
[2:02:41] death knew its master and Corruption
[2:02:43] knew its maker and he said life came
[2:02:46] back in that body and Lazarus caught up
[2:02:49] and he come walking out of the Grave can
[2:02:51] I tell you what Lazarus become he became
[2:02:53] a fully formed disciple of the
[2:02:56] resurrection and the life come on Church
[2:02:59] am me you imagine you imagine everybody
[2:03:02] wanted Lazarus around their place
[2:03:04] because if anybody could talk about
[2:03:06] believing for the impossible Lazarus
[2:03:08] could you imagine sitting around brother
[2:03:10] Sean amen amen you imagine sitting
[2:03:12] around talking with Lazarus and you tell
[2:03:14] Lazarus how about it bad day you had all
[2:03:17] these things are going on and Lazarus
[2:03:18] said well let me tell you I was dead and
[2:03:20] come back to life
[2:03:22] so no matter what you're going through I
[2:03:24] am a witness you imagine shaking hands
[2:03:27] with Lazarus outside the church you
[2:03:29] imagine what kind of services they had
[2:03:31] when Lazarus come to church because now
[2:03:34] we don't just have the word that he is
[2:03:37] the resurrection but now we have a fully
[2:03:40] formed disciple who is
[2:03:44] walking glory to God he is walking
[2:03:47] manifestation that God is a resurrection
[2:03:50] will devil hear me and hear me well this
[2:03:53] ain't a bunch of church members these
[2:03:54] are disciples who have been saved and
[2:03:57] they know God Saves they have been
[2:04:00] healed and they know God heals they've
[2:04:02] been delivered and they know God
[2:04:04] delivers they've been redeemed Brother
[2:04:07] Bruce and we know God
[2:04:11] redeems we ain't just church members
[2:04:14] we're
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:16] disciples go tell Lazarus about your bad
[2:04:19] day right go Shake Lazarus hand
[2:04:23] out brother Jo brother Joel you imagine
[2:04:26] working with
[2:04:28] Lazarus you
[2:04:31] don't you imagine being on the job of
[2:04:34] Lazarus he is over there singing I'm
[2:04:37] going to
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:39] rise he's over there talking about the
[2:04:41] goodness of God you know why because
[2:04:44] it's now become more than just a word
[2:04:47] it's become a manifested word it's now
[2:04:50] in the flesh of a human are you all
[2:04:52] hearing me are you hearing me you know
[2:04:55] why you're shouting like you're shouting
[2:04:57] is because what you've heard and what
[2:05:00] you've read has now come into your flesh
[2:05:03] and you're now walking with authority
[2:05:05] you're not guessing you're now knowing
[2:05:08] well I might as well say it amen when
[2:05:10] Lazarus got out of the Grave he did not
[2:05:13] just become a fully formed disciple of
[2:05:15] the Resurrection can I tell you what he
[2:05:17] become he become a fully formed disciple
[2:05:20] of praise and worship
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:24] well we might as well preach for here he
[2:05:26] become a fully formed disciple of what
[2:05:28] it means to praise God Lazarus has just
[2:05:32] been dead but he heard his name and he
[2:05:35] came out and brother Ben he was bound
[2:05:37] hand and foot he was bound over his
[2:05:39] mouth he was bound over his eyes come on
[2:05:42] somebody you know what the Bible says
[2:05:45] the Bible said he wanted to praise God
[2:05:47] amen amen I feel good right now amen I
[2:05:49] think I'm talking to some Lazarus here

[2:05:53] situations you've come out of some dark
[2:05:55] days you've come out of some trials
[2:05:57] you've come out of some pressures hey
[2:05:59] and God brought you out but he didn't
[2:06:01] bring you out to be a statue he didn't
[2:06:04] bring you out to be some old cold
[2:06:06] ritualistic ungodly formal ritualistic
[2:06:08] Christian he brought you out to be a
[2:06:11] fully formed
[2:06:15] disciple so Jesus looked at Lazarus and
[2:06:18] he said Lazarus come forth Lazarus come
[2:06:21] forth Jesus said Lazarus Amen Let me let
[2:06:24] me see there stands Lazarus he's all
[2:06:26] tied up he said now Lord you've done too
[2:06:29] much for me I just want to praise you I
[2:06:32] just want to bless your name I just want
[2:06:34] to give you some worship but I'm all

[2:06:46] clothes thank you Lord Jesus thank you
[2:06:49] my father he was no longer Bound in the
[2:06:52] grave he was bound in the clothes so the
[2:06:55] clothes he was wearing was a
[2:06:57] representation of where he had been but
[2:07:00] it wasn't take him to where he was
[2:07:01] ordained to go so he had to be

[2:26:07] for the occasion okay but here was her
[2:26:09] old Holiness grandfather and he was one
[2:26:11] of them shouting hollering tongue
[2:26:12] talking spitting sweating crazy
[2:26:14] Believers she said now I got to do
[2:26:16] something with Daddy I'll put him up in
[2:26:17] the attic and I'll take his Bible away
[2:26:20] Judah I'll take his Bible away I'll put
[2:26:23] him up there in the attic and he won't
[2:26:24] be able to shout he won't be able to
[2:26:26] dance he won't be able to praise
[2:26:29] God so they're down there drinking their
[2:26:32] tea and and eating their own food and
[2:26:33] talking about their doctrines and their
[2:26:35] Creeds and and how they follow this
[2:26:37] bishop and they follow this idea and
[2:26:39] they're just having a real nice fine
[2:26:40] denominational time but then all of a
[2:26:42] sudden they start hearing some stomping
[2:26:45] they start hearing some stomping they
[2:26:47] start hearing some shaking they start
[2:26:49] hearing some noise

[2:27:05] what are you shouting about he said

[2:27:09] me up here in this attic and I got to
[2:27:11] reading over here in this geography book
[2:27:13] about the sea she said Daddy what are
[2:27:16] you shouting about the sea he said I got
[2:27:18] to reading about the sea how they've
[2:27:20] been trying to find the bottom of the
[2:27:23] sea she said Daddy what are you shouting
[2:27:25] about that for he said because the Bible
[2:27:27] says listen when you are the word you
[2:27:31] can't hide the word from the word you'll
[2:27:33] find the word in a tree you'll find the

[2:27:57] said so let me ask you why you shouting

[2:28:02] Lord Jesus he took my sins and he threw
[2:28:05] them in the bottom of the sea she said
[2:28:08] what are you shouting about that for he
