[0:00] but what altar calls what do we do with
[0:02] an altar call
[0:04] are they necessary
[0:05] i've got good friends good friends in
[0:08] this message that would never make an
[0:09] altar call because they believe brother
[0:10] branham was against them
[0:12] brother brown was against altar calls
[0:15] and there are quotes that and i'll read
[0:16] some to you that make it sound like that
[0:19] but you know if you go back to the
[0:20] scripture let's go back to acts chapter
[0:22] 2
[0:23] and verse 36
[0:25] you know the call at pentecost
[0:29] and think with me for a moment the call
[0:31] was the sermon
[0:33] right it was not peter saying
[0:36] to the people
[0:37] you know begging them to come to an
[0:38] altar but the call was the sermon itself
[0:42] peter
[0:43] magnificently and during that sermon
[0:45] proved who jesus was
[0:47] and that they
[0:48] were guilty
[0:51] now if you have more preaching like that
[0:52] you'd have more altar calls
[0:54] just spontaneously
[0:57] right because he proved who jesus was he
[0:59] said this is the messiah
[1:01] and you crucified him
[1:04] that's a hard thing to take isn't it
[1:06] this is the messiah this is the god
[1:11] i think our kids need to hear that
[1:14] i think us adults sometimes need to hear
[1:16] it
[1:17] this is the messiah here's the word
[1:22] and with your life the way that you live
[1:23] you crucify
[1:26] oh god aren't you glad for a bride who
[1:28] lived the word aren't you glad to be the
[1:30] bride that will live the word
[1:32] amen no we're not perfect in our own
[1:34] sight but we're perfect in his eyes
[1:36] but people
[1:38] need to be proved who jesus is and and
[1:41] or prove to them who jesus is and that
[1:42] they are guilty of his death
[1:45] and so in acts 2 36 peter says therefore
[1:48] let all the house of israel know
[1:49] assuredly that god hath made that same
[1:52] jesus whom you have crucified both lord
[1:55] and
[1:56] christ
[1:58] now when he said that now isn't that a
[2:00] powerful statement
[2:02] my goodness and look what they did when
[2:03] they heard this
[2:05] they were pricked in their heart they
[2:08] felt conviction and they said to peter
[2:10] and the rest of the apostles men and
[2:11] brethren what shall we do
[2:14] now
[2:15] i imagine that they probably come to the
[2:17] front to ask that there may have been in
[2:19] the back i don't know but there was at
[2:21] least 3 000 people there because 3 000
[2:23] people got saved and so you might have
[2:25] had somebody hollering from the back men
[2:26] and brethren
[2:29] what shall we do
[2:31] right it could have happened
[2:33] but i imagine that many of them come to
[2:34] the to the soapbox
[2:37] right peter's standing there on his
[2:38] soapbox and the people run up to him and
[2:41] they said brother peter what shall we do
[2:43] to be saved give us instructions what
[2:45] shall we do to be saved your name's joel
[2:47] not peter but what shall we do to be
[2:49] saved what can i do about my condition
[2:53] that's a real altar call
[2:56] what can i do about it it's people
[2:58] getting convicted enough that they know
[3:01] what they've been doing is wrong i tell
[3:02] you what sometimes we christians need to
[3:05] be convicted about what we've been doing
[3:08] and we need to find ourselves on an
[3:09] altar of prayers sometimes
[3:14] convicted
[3:16] are y'all with me this morning
[3:19] men and brethren what shall we do
[3:22] they came and asked for instructions and
[3:23] peter gave it to him he said repent and
[3:25] be baptized repent and be baptized every
[3:28] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[3:29] for the remission of sins and you shall
[3:31] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[3:35] now many people kneel at an altar we
[3:37] don't we don't actually have an altar
[3:39] here this is a platform
[3:41] and but we have a place here where
[3:42] people can kneel and if you want to
[3:44] kneel you don't have to kneel
[3:46] but kneeling is an act of submission it
[3:48] isn't required but there's plenty of
[3:50] biblical examples in daniel chapter 6
[3:52] and verse 10 when daniel knew that the
[3:54] writing was signed he went into his
[3:56] house and his windows being opened in
[3:58] his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled
[4:00] upon his knees three times a day and
[4:02] prayed and gave thanks before god as he
[4:04] did
[4:05] of four times so we know that when
[4:06] daniel prayed he knelt now most jews in
[4:08] the old testament when they prayed they
[4:10] prayed standing up
[4:12] but the altar call that we know as we
[4:14] know it
[4:15] came into being in the second great
[4:17] awakening around 1830 it was a man named
[4:20] charles finney
[4:22] and finney at that time was persecuted
[4:24] by the presbyterians and the baptist for
[4:26] having altar calls for calling people to
[4:28] the front
[4:29] this is what brother branham said about
[4:31] charles finney
[4:32] he said charles g finney to my way of
[4:34] thinking he said was one of the greatest
[4:36] ministers since saint paul
[4:38] he claimed to have won a million souls
[4:40] to christ again in in 1965 brother
[4:43] branham said so therefore we know that
[4:45] luther could not get to it wesley and so
[4:47] forth the reformers knox finney calvin
[4:49] on down and so forth they didn't get it
[4:51] all but what they had was the gospel
[4:53] truth
[4:55] all right so they did some things wrong
[4:56] but what they had was the gospel truth
[4:59] they didn't get it all now
[5:01] again brother branham says this in 1954
[5:03] he said now we have an old-fashioned
[5:05] custom of altar call bringing the people
[5:07] up to the altar now that's a long time
[5:09] ago 1954 it was old-fashioned then
[5:12] in fact today but but it was coming back
[5:14] into vogue that that was what the
[5:16] pentecostals would do and that's what
[5:18] billy graham during his crusades would
[5:20] have an altar call and the people would
[5:21] all come to the front but it hadn't been
[5:24] done it had only been done since 1830.
[5:26] before that they didn't didn't have
[5:28] altar calls the way we do it today but
[5:30] people would just come voluntarily but
[5:32] now billy graham
[5:34] had altar calls and all the people had
[5:36] revived the altar call and most mostly
[5:38] as a method to count how many people
[5:41] were there and also to receive them into
[5:43] a church of some kind sign them up
[5:45] so and that's not why we have altar
[5:47] calls around the message by the way
[5:50] not to sign people up
[5:52] right but it's providing a place for
[5:54] people to pray now
[5:56] brother branham says it's an
[5:57] old-fashioned custom he said he said
[5:59] bringing the people up to the altar god
[6:00] be praised for that he said that's a
[6:02] good old-fashioned thing that the
[6:03] methodist church started years ago it
[6:05] was good it's still good today but it
[6:07] ain't necessary that you come to the
[6:08] altar to become a christian
[6:10] they never had it during the bible days
[6:12] they just counted them as believers
[6:15] now if you've been convicted to come to
[6:16] the altar and you sit there and say oh
[6:19] good i don't have to go you probably
[6:20] need to
[6:25] right because you felt the conviction
[6:27] you something was told you always listen
[6:29] to that
[6:31] always listen to that if something
[6:33] inside of you wants to shout listen to
[6:35] that
[6:36] something inside of you wants to cry
[6:38] after god listen to that obviously the
[6:40] spirit of the prophet is subject to the
[6:41] prophets there's a place and a time for
[6:43] that that's why we say at the end of the
[6:44] service the altar is open it means that
[6:47] that's the time for you to come for
[6:48] prayer whether you stand or whether you
[6:50] kneel whatever it is that you do but it
[6:52] is open for you you don't have to be a
[6:54] sinner to come to the altar
[6:57] you know in fact i've found many times
[6:59] when i preach a really convicting sermon
[7:00] that is many of the elders that come
[7:02] it's those that maybe have walked with
[7:04] god for many many years that come to the
[7:06] altar and ask for prayer want to be
[7:08] closer to god because sometimes we as
[7:10] younger people i'll identify myself with
[7:12] you we don't realize how much we need
[7:16] amen
[7:17] to to feel god to know he's there to
[7:20] have his presence in our lives once you
[7:22] live long enough you begin to realize i
[7:23] need god i need him in the morning i
[7:25] need him at work i need his presence in
[7:27] my life
[7:29] and if i'm doing something that drives
[7:30] him away in some way grieves him then i
[7:32] need to be in an altar
[7:35] but you don't have to come to an altar
[7:36] to become a christian
[7:38] you have to believe
[7:40] right and now they just counted them as
[7:42] believers he said they never made altar
[7:43] calls all the time in the apostolic age
[7:45] there was no altar calls
[7:47] they said as many as believed was
[7:49] baptized he said that right they become
[7:52] believers
[7:53] but branham did not believe in
[7:55] persuading unconvicted people to come to
[7:57] the altar
[8:00] and my answer to that let's let's preach
[8:02] more convicting sermons
[8:06] right because if you never hear a
[8:07] convicting sermon you're not going to be
[8:08] convicted that's god's method
[8:11] and so i don't do that and and you can't
[8:13] make every service an altar call but
[8:14] sometimes we need to be shook up
[8:17] right i'm not just defending myself here
[8:20] because of last week but we need to be
[8:22] shook up sometimes
[8:24] sometimes we need somebody to grab a
[8:26] hold of us and i i pray it's the holy
[8:27] spirit today and just take us and shake
[8:30] us a little bit
[8:32] and say hey you're not doing what you're
[8:34] supposed to be doing i know i need that
[8:35] many times
[8:37] many times i feel the convicting power
[8:39] of god before i even come out here on
[8:41] the platform why because god wants me to
[8:43] do something else
[8:44] he wants me to do something different he
[8:46] wants me to put my heart into it
[8:49] so i feel convicted when i don't
[8:52] because i know it's the right thing to
[8:53] do now brother branham says this he said
[8:55] i've always been against an altar call
[8:57] might as well say it he said i don't
[8:58] believe in them no such thing in the
[9:00] bible how can any man come lest god
[9:02] calls him
[9:04] watch he wasn't against people coming
[9:06] and praying
[9:07] he was against persuading people to come
[9:10] without conviction look how he continues
[9:13] he said how can any man come lest god
[9:15] calls him you couldn't keep him away
[9:18] you don't have to call anything god has
[9:20] called him altar call he said it was a
[9:22] methodist idea he said they get a hold
[9:23] of them and say john you know your
[9:24] mother died a long time ago ooh oh yes
[9:26] brother oh he said that's not conversion
[9:28] now watch where he takes this he said
[9:30] here a few nights ago we had a display
[9:31] in louisville of a woman brought in a
[9:33] casket laid upon a platform in the
[9:34] armory hundreds of people that run to
[9:36] the altar the gospel is not a scare it's
[9:38] not a sympathetic feeling it's a
[9:40] conversion of conviction
[9:44] and that's what they do i know the
[9:45] assembly of god church some years ago
[9:47] they had these uh
[9:48] they had these shows that they would put
[9:50] on and it would be hell
[9:52] and you'd go through this and you'd
[9:53] learn what hell was like and then give
[9:55] an altar call at the end
[9:57] well that you scared people
[10:00] right you make it scary enough you go
[10:01] through a haunted house you might get
[10:03] down on your knees and pray
[10:06] if you're scared by that kind of a thing
[10:08] but that's not a real altar call that's
[10:10] not that's not really a conversion he
[10:12] said that's not a conversion he said
[10:13] here a few nights ago we had a display
[10:15] of a woman brought in a casket laid up
[10:16] upon a platform the armory hundreds of
[10:18] people said run to the altar the gospel
[10:20] is not a scare it's not a sympathetic
[10:22] feeling it's a conversion of conviction
[10:24] watch these meetings he said these great
[10:25] evangelists he said even in my humble
[10:27] little ministry not excluding me he said
[10:29] sometimes i feel like a shame going out
[10:31] he said that's right what are we to do
[10:33] stand and make alter calls and persuade
[10:35] them
[10:36] little girls coming up there chewing
[10:37] chewing gum
[10:41] you see where the problem was it wasn't
[10:42] in people praying
[10:44] it was in the p the ministry con
[10:46] compelling people to come because they
[10:47] wanted numbers
[10:49] and then when they convinced them to
[10:50] come by whatever means that they got
[10:53] them to come the people weren't sincere
[10:56] instead because everybody else does it
[11:02] look how brother branham
[11:03] because and again i've got friends good
[11:05] friends
[11:06] that would never make an altar call have
[11:08] never made one in their ministry
[11:10] and i don't condemn that brother
[11:13] are those brothers but i'll say this
[11:15] brother branham did
[11:17] in fact the last thing he did
[11:20] in a church in a regular service was
[11:21] make an altar call
[11:23] this is what he said about he said the
[11:24] old-fashioned altar calls are out of
[11:26] style today but god still moves in them
[11:29] it's before communion the last thing he
[11:30] took he took communion but before that
[11:32] in leadership he said can't you feel it
[11:34] moving on your church
[11:36] god still moves in them look again
[11:39] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[11:40] he said my husband brother said how can
[11:42] you get fish in the boat
[11:44] that's right
[11:45] but brother branham you're against altar
[11:47] calls
[11:48] you see some of us standing up and say
[11:50] brother bran i'm wait you're against
[11:52] altar calls don't do that you're making
[11:53] a mistake
[11:55] but we misunderstood
[11:57] in the same way that we misunderstood
[11:59] christmas trees
[12:01] and we misunderstood we misunderstood a
[12:04] lot of things i'll just stop there
[12:07] we misunderstood
[12:09] now look brother branham says now
[12:12] he says we have no place for an altar
[12:13] call this is in 1965 and i'm going
[12:15] backwards almost every sermon at the end
[12:17] of brother branham's life he gives an
[12:18] altar call or talks about it he said we
[12:21] have no place for an altar call but
[12:22] right at the table where you're sitting
[12:24] he said the place is packed and jammed
[12:26] overflow they were sitting at tables
[12:28] actually had a meal and then he preached
[12:29] to him he said i couldn't call you to an
[12:31] altar there's no altar here to call you
[12:33] to but the altar is in your heart
[12:38] you're not coming to an altar here
[12:39] you're coming to the platform you're
[12:40] coming up front but but there's nothing
[12:42] special about that but the altar is in
[12:44] your heart and sometimes you do need to
[12:46] get down and cry sometimes you need to
[12:48] get down here or you need to get down on
[12:49] your seat or you need to find a prayer
[12:51] closet at home you need to find a place
[12:54] where the altar is
[12:56] where your heart can get in touch with
[12:58] god again
[12:59] because you've gotten cold
[13:02] are you with me now
[13:04] i can't be the only one that ever gets
[13:06] cold
[13:08] i can't be the only one that ever feels
[13:10] the lukewarmness of the age begin to
[13:12] seep in
[13:14] it just begins to creep in and it creeps
[13:16] in among us until we get to where we
[13:18] don't care anymore and then every once
[13:20] in a while i have to shake myself and
[13:22] say this is not what i was born to be
[13:24] brother brandon said the bride would by
[13:25] no means be a lukewarm but they would be
[13:27] on fire for god
[13:29] this is not who i am and so i get a
[13:32] whiff when i realize what god is i begin
[13:34] to realize i need him there's a desire
[13:37] there
[13:39] now
[13:41] brother branham says
[13:43] won't you let that little conviction
[13:44] that jesus christ is real do you have
[13:47] that conviction today
[13:49] that's conviction you believe jesus
[13:51] christ is real that's conviction he said
[13:52] move right up close today and call the
[13:55] rest of his body to you
[13:57] think about it just that little
[13:58] conviction move right up and call the
[14:00] rest of his body to you major him in
[14:02] your heart
[14:03] if he isn't there would you raise your
[14:04] hand and assign to him saying lord fill
[14:07] me i got absolutely nothing wrong either
[14:09] because i've heard it preached on the
[14:10] other side well a person raising their
[14:11] hand doesn't mean anything well brother
[14:13] branham thought it did
[14:16] brother branham thought it did but what
[14:18] is it when you can't have an altar call
[14:19] when there's no room
[14:20] when when in a situation maybe at the
[14:22] end of a service where it's not called
[14:24] for there's a place
[14:26] for raising your hand but there's also a
[14:27] place for getting down to business with
[14:29] god
[14:31] are you with me now
[14:33] he says now he said if he isn't there
[14:35] would you raise your hand assigned to
[14:36] him saying lord fill me fill me with
[14:37] your word and with your presence that i
[14:39] might live by you
[14:41] now
[14:43] he said so i'm just gonna wait now this
[14:45] is in invisible union and i've literally
[14:48] just went back three or four services
[14:50] he said i'm just gonna wait
[14:52] because there's many many around the
[14:53] altar now
[14:54] he said see maybe one of them if i held
[14:56] just a little longer there might be
[14:58] another one out there
[15:00] might be somewhere you say brother
[15:01] branham you can't hold people at the end
[15:03] of a service for an altar call you can't
[15:05] hold people because you're against altar
[15:06] calls but he did
[15:12] yeah
[15:13] see it was the way they were doing it
[15:16] we did the same thing with fellowship
[15:17] halls one time in the message
[15:20] couldn't have a fellowship paul because
[15:21] brother branham preached about playing
[15:22] bunco games in the in the basement or in
[15:24] the annex
[15:26] so nobody could have a fellowship hall
[15:28] and it's not what he was saying at all
[15:31] just misunderstanding it's what you're
[15:32] doing with it
[15:34] what are you doing at the altar call
[15:36] is there a purpose for it
[15:38] is it real is it something that is a
[15:40] desire it's something in someone's heart
[15:42] that wants to come
[15:44] now look but brother man would hold them
[15:46] sometimes
[15:47] many times you can find examples of that
[15:48] but here in invisible union he holds for
[15:50] a long time at the end of that sermon
[15:53] after preaching a long time he held them
[15:55] for a long time he said see maybe one of
[15:57] them if i held just a little longer
[15:59] there might be another one out there it
[16:00] might be somewhere in new york might be
[16:02] somewhere because they were hooked up on
[16:03] the telephone line he said might be in
[16:04] philadelphia in california arizona
[16:06] somewhere there might be another one
[16:08] coming pastor wherever you are don't
[16:11] give the altar call up now
[16:15] i took that as a personal challenge
[16:17] oh god help me
[16:19] don't give the altar call up now
[16:21] again he says in jehovah jair in 1964 i
[16:24] believe god is going to do some great
[16:25] things tomorrow i'm hoping he is that's
[16:27] the reason i make altar calls do
[16:29] everything i can to find favor with him
[16:32] yes
[16:33] amen
[16:34] again
[16:35] he says i know we all come up around the
[16:36] altar and pray that's no methodist idea
[16:38] they never did do that in the bible the
[16:40] bible said as many as believed was
[16:41] baptized that's right no such thing as
[16:43] an altar call in the bible that's
[16:44] something we added which is all right
[16:46] anything god blesses it's all right
[16:49] he said like they anoint claws there
[16:50] never was such a thing in the bible
[16:52] i've got handkerchiefs under here i can
[16:54] give you a prayer cloth but that wasn't
[16:56] the way they did it in the bible
[16:58] they took it from his clothes
[17:00] so really you ought to take the one i
[17:01] had in my pocket
[17:07] if you really want to be scriptural
[17:08] about it
[17:09] i watched your brother david terrell one
[17:10] time i don't know if you know him he's
[17:12] an apostolic brother and he was
[17:14] preaching one time just preaching when
[17:15] he had a whole great big old stack of
[17:16] them and they would anoint them with oil
[17:17] then he'd take them and use that whole
[17:19] stack and wipe his face with it and and
[17:21] give them out
[17:22] but really i mean to be scriptural you'd
[17:24] take parts of my clothes
[17:26] right
[17:28] they taken from the body of paul
[17:30] and brother branham would explain that
[17:32] to the people and then he'd pray over
[17:33] the
[17:34] over the prayer claws
[17:37] and send them out because it was
[17:38] something god blessed
[17:41] right even maybe it wasn't exactly how
[17:42] they did it there but it was something
[17:44] god blessed the altar call was the same
[17:45] thing
[17:46] he said like the anoint clause there
[17:48] never was such a thing in the bible they
[17:49] taken from the body of paul
[17:50] handkerchiefs and aprons he said but
[17:52] anyway you want to do it it's all right
[17:53] in your seat at the altar wherever it is
[17:56] the only thing
[17:57] apply that token to you
[18:01] amen
[18:02] then look yourself over
[18:04] and look what kind of a life's going on
[18:07] see if it's been applied or not he said
[18:10] if it hasn't then lay it every what you
[18:12] got aside and come back till the token
[18:15] is applied
[18:16] you know what i like to see i like to
[18:18] see this at youth camps i like to see
[18:19] this in church you know what i love to
[18:21] see
[18:22] i love to see altar calls i love to see
[18:24] people come you know what i really love
[18:26] to see next sunday
[18:30] i love to see next sunday because next
[18:33] sunday they wash their face
[18:35] next sunday they quit wearing the
[18:37] clothes they used to wear next sunday
[18:39] they come and and you can tell there's
[18:41] something about them that's changed they
[18:42] showed up at church next sunday why
[18:45] because something happened at the altar
[18:47] they died to themselves
[18:50] and many might come to an altar and
[18:51] never do that and they'll still have
[18:52] that wearing the pain still still doing
[18:54] the things they always did next sunday
[18:58] right
[19:01] now we're gonna
[19:02] get into this a little bit and then
[19:04] we'll close
[19:05] he said now we all know he said to the
[19:07] birth he said i don't care where it is
[19:08] or where abouts he said if it's a mess
[19:12] if a baby's born on a shut pile on a
[19:14] hard floor or in a pink decorated
[19:15] hospital room it's a mess
[19:17] anyhow
[19:19] birth of a calf birth of anything else
[19:20] is a mess
[19:22] and the new birth is nothing less than a
[19:24] mess
[19:26] but people are so
[19:28] starchy
[19:31] you wouldn't believe how starchy people
[19:33] get and how easy it is for people to get
[19:36] starchy
[19:38] you get comfortable
[19:39] sitting back and doing a certain thing
[19:41] every sunday
[19:43] reacting in the same way to the word
[19:46] it's like this and i'm not i'd rather
[19:48] have that than this
[19:51] right
[19:52] but you get starchy
[19:55] right but a new birth is nothing less
[19:56] than a mess you're gonna have to break
[19:58] out of that starch to be born again
[20:01] that's true
[20:02] now he says
[20:03] he says if it's a mess he said nothing
[20:05] less than a mess but people are so
[20:06] starchy we'll go over where they shake
[20:08] hands we'll go over where they don't
[20:10] bawl and cry and beat on the altar and
[20:11] cry out he said you want to be too human
[20:15] what a powerful statement you want to be
[20:18] too human you're two i know preachers
[20:21] who are too careful about how they look
[20:24] well i'm not
[20:30] joel's got me going to the gym on monday
[20:32] so
[20:33] put me on a diet
[20:35] see if i last
[20:38] you'll know next sunday
[20:44] you want to be too human
[20:47] you you're stiff and you you look good
[20:49] and everything the time's just right and
[20:51] i admire some of you look really good
[20:53] but sometimes you just need to be a mess
[20:58] sometimes you need to get in a place
[20:59] where you're just a mess you can't keep
[21:02] the tears from coming you can't keep
[21:04] your hand from going up you can't keep
[21:06] from walking around like staggering like
[21:08] a drunk man you can't keep from
[21:09] worshiping that's what i want to see not
[21:12] because somebody worked it up not
[21:13] because the preacher got loud not
[21:15] because we had the music real loud but
[21:17] because somebody is dealing with
[21:19] something in their life and they feel
[21:20] victory over it and they feel that
[21:22] they've died to themselves and so
[21:24] they're getting in a mess
[21:29] you want to be too human
[21:31] what we need is birth said brother ben
[21:33] i'm not that way i'm not outgoing i'm
[21:35] not outspoken
[21:37] i'm not
[21:38] i'm not wanting to say a man real loud
[21:40] you want to be too human
[21:43] maybe you need to say man i recognize
[21:44] god has a place for that i realize
[21:46] there's a place for that but not
[21:48] everybody's that way
[21:50] some of y'all go to a ball game you get
[21:52] real loud
[21:54] mr allison's not here today they may be
[21:56] watching i don't know but if if they
[21:58] watch this you know she i heard she gets
[21:59] real loud at a ball game
[22:03] if you get real loud at a ball game and
[22:05] sister allison worships in church too
[22:06] but if you get real loud in a ball game
[22:08] it can't get loud in church something's
[22:10] wrong
[22:13] reason why you're comfortable getting
[22:14] loud at the ballgame because everybody
[22:15] else does it
[22:19] that's true
[22:21] maybe we need to start a trend brother
[22:23] joel
[22:24] what we need is birth dying out that
[22:27] brings forth life
[22:29] amen brother branham never quit teaching
[22:31] that
[22:33] amen he says a man or a woman
[22:36] can never have new birth until their
[22:37] intellectuals and their own self is
[22:40] rotten
[22:41] dead
[22:44] not just dead but rotten go look i'll
[22:46] see how many times brother branham says
[22:47] that in the message that you've got to
[22:49] die and rot
[22:53] die and rot you can never have new birth
[22:54] until they're intellectuals and their
[22:56] own self is rotten dead die out at the
[22:58] altar scream get all messed up to a
[23:01] place the starch gets out of your collar
[23:04] and you are born again by the spirit of
[23:06] god
[23:08] i don't care if you squall speak in
[23:10] tongues jump up and down flop like a
[23:12] chicken with its head off
[23:16] you're bringing forth new life
[23:18] but we substituted something for it we
[23:20] want the classical way
[23:23] he preached that in a sermon called a
[23:24] deceived church by the world you talk
[23:26] about being under conviction i challenge
[23:28] you listen to that sermon and see if
[23:29] you're not under conviction
[23:32] you get done
[23:34] listen the real altar is in your heart
[23:36] that's where the altar is
[23:38] and yet when jesus began to suffer with
[23:41] our sin
[23:42] he found a place of prayer
[23:45] he died on
[23:46] the altar
[23:48] he found a place to pray
[23:50] and look
[23:52] how would he subdue his own will to the
[23:54] will of the father an altar of prayer
[23:56] how would he wrestle with sin not his
[23:57] own but yours and mine at an altar of
[24:00] prayer luke 22 and 39 he came out and
[24:02] went as he was one to the mount of
[24:04] olives and his disciples also followed
[24:06] him when he was at the place he said
[24:07] unto them pray that you enter not into
[24:09] temptation he was withdrawn from them
[24:11] about a stone's cast and kneeled down
[24:13] and prayed
[24:14] saying father if thou be willing remove
[24:17] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[24:20] will but thine be done and there
[24:22] appeared an angel unto him from heaven
[24:23] strengthening him and being in an agony
[24:27] he prayed more earnestly
[24:30] what do we say fervently heated on fire
[24:33] he prayed more earnestly they began to
[24:35] if they were awake they could have heard
[24:37] him
[24:38] he prayed more earnestly his sweat was
[24:41] as it were great drops of blood falling
[24:43] down to the ground and when he rose up
[24:45] from prayer and was come to his
[24:47] disciples he found them sleeping for
[24:49] sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye
[24:51] rise and pray lest you enter into
[24:53] temptation prayer doesn't save you
[24:55] you're saved by faith but prayer is how
[24:57] you die that's how he died to his own
[25:00] will
[25:02] he died before they put the nails in his
[25:04] hands
[25:05] he died before oman he died before they
[25:08] they put the stripes on his back he died
[25:11] before they cut him and they bruised him
[25:13] and they placed him on her cross he died
[25:16] in the garden of gethsemane when he said
[25:18] father not my will but thy and in agony
[25:20] he cried out more earnestly
[25:23] amen he died carrying our
[25:26] sins when the blood separated from the
[25:29] water in his body and drops of blood
[25:31] fell from his face he died and brother
[25:33] branham told us and taught us that
[25:35] you've got to die like he died
[25:38] that's what he said
[25:39] the rich young ruler wanted another way
[25:41] in mark 10 21 and jesus looked at him
[25:43] and loved him and made his altar call if
[25:45] you could put it that way he said unto
[25:46] him one thing you lack let me tell you
[25:48] something that will convict you go your
[25:50] way sell whatever you have give to the
[25:52] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[25:53] heaven and
[25:54] come make a movement take up the cross
[25:59] die and follow me
[26:01] he knew what taking up the cross meant
[26:03] they saw many of cross many crosses
[26:06] he said to them all if any man will come
[26:08] after me let him deny himself take up
[26:10] his cross
[26:11] daily
[26:12] and follow me
[26:14] take up the cross
[26:15] it's difficult sometimes i know some of
[26:17] you it's hard even to come to church
[26:19] i've seen some of you come maybe your
[26:20] father went to this church or your
[26:21] mother it's difficult for you maybe to
[26:23] even sit through a service because you
[26:24] have memories and things that went on
[26:26] but you got to take up your cross
[26:29] you got to be willing to be identified
[26:30] with believers
[26:32] i know there's people that watch it
[26:33] we've got people that watch every
[26:34] service some
[26:36] there's people that have watched
[26:37] faithfully for two years now every
[26:39] service that we've had they watch but at
[26:41] some point you've got to be identified
[26:43] with believers you've got to be willing
[26:45] to take up the cross of making the drive
[26:47] and coming to church
[26:51] you've got to die to yourself
[26:53] i'm not telling you that'll save you but
[26:55] you got to die
[26:57] you're saved by faith
[26:58] but you've got to die if any man will
[27:01] come after me do you want to follow
[27:02] jesus and you've got to take up the
[27:04] cross
[27:07] i titled this
[27:10] about water
[27:12] can you smell the water i know
[27:14] joel's been wondering this whole time
[27:15] where i got that from
[27:18] the harvey has two
[27:21] brother branham tells the story of a
[27:23] duck in the barnyard
[27:25] you've heard the story there's a duck in
[27:27] the barnyard he was raised with the
[27:29] chickens
[27:32] he's raised with the chickens and he's
[27:33] out there scratching around the barnyard
[27:35] he don't he don't know he's born to swim
[27:38] has no clue
[27:40] has no clue he's out there in the dust
[27:41] in the dirt
[27:42] but brother brandon said one day the
[27:44] wind changed
[27:47] i think we need a wind change that's
[27:49] what a revival is a wind change
[27:52] that's what the message of the hour is
[27:53] just the bride revival it's a change of
[27:55] direction
[27:57] everything was blowing out all the wind
[27:59] was blowing out denominational
[28:00] ministries and and and preachers
[28:03] preaching and everything was what man
[28:04] could do but all of a sudden the wind
[28:06] changed
[28:08] and there were some ducks in the
[28:09] barnyard
[28:10] and as soon as they smelled the water
[28:16] they came alive
[28:19] they thought they were chickens but they
[28:21] had to die to their identity as a
[28:24] chicken
[28:26] i'm not what i thought i was
[28:30] oh i hope you're here you hear me today
[28:32] you young people you've got to die to
[28:34] your identity as a human being when it
[28:36] comes to everybody says well you need to
[28:38] find yourself you need to be yourself
[28:40] you can be whatever you want to be no
[28:41] god wants you to be a christian he wants
[28:43] you to be what he wants you to be you
[28:45] don't know what your future holds and
[28:47] you've got to die to your identity as a
[28:49] human being and say lord nevertheless
[28:51] not my will but thy be done
[28:54] you can't do that unless you can smell
[28:55] the water
[28:59] i hope you're hearing me now brother man
[29:00] i'm saying if there's any of you got a
[29:02] duck nature we got a great big pool of
[29:05] back pool back here see he said if you
[29:07] can smell if you've got a whiff
[29:10] that god remains god i wonder if any of
[29:13] us can smell
[29:16] duck gets out there and he sticks his
[29:18] bill up in the air
[29:19] kind of strange he's got a bill
[29:21] and not a beak
[29:24] he don't know what it's for
[29:26] he's got feathers they can pour water on
[29:28] him it's like water off a duck's back
[29:31] so you get that later and
[29:33] he'll you know he's just different than
[29:36] the others
[29:37] he don't know why
[29:39] but one day
[29:40] he smells the water
[29:42] and there ain't nothing going to stop
[29:44] him
[29:45] from going to the altar i mean the the
[29:47] pond
[29:50] you understand that's an altar call
[29:55] it's not just well well the the people
[29:57] are doing it there's an altar call today
[29:58] it's we've scheduled one
[30:01] i'm gonna go and i'm gonna get right
[30:02] with god
[30:03] no
[30:04] it's when you smell the water
[30:10] you find it hard to go to church
[30:13] hard to do what god requires you to do
[30:15] as a husband or as a wife it's difficult
[30:18] it's hard and i know the flesh fights
[30:20] you but it's so hard because something
[30:22] in you just makes you want you take
[30:23] every excuse you can make can you smell
[30:25] the water
[30:27] if you ever get in the water if you can
[30:29] smell the water today you can get that
[30:32] desire changed
[30:34] there's got to be something in you to
[30:36] smell the water
[30:37] if you've got a whiff from heaven
[30:39] tonight that god keeps his word how many
[30:40] believe that today
[30:42] and he's a miracle-working god do you
[30:44] believe it today
[30:45] if you get a whiff that he's a
[30:46] miracle-working god and you haven't
[30:48] received the holy ghost yet smell the
[30:50] water
[30:51] the first thing he said do
[30:54] hallelujah
[30:56] amen the holy ghost filled duck if we
[30:58] could put it that way the person who or
[31:00] we should say it this way the duck that
[31:02] is a real duck he smells the water he
[31:05] smells baptism and then he smells
[31:07] repentance and then baptism and then he
[31:09] smells the holy ghost and he just keeps
[31:11] on going you can't keep him away from
[31:13] church you can't keep him away from the
[31:14] things of god you can't just it's not
[31:16] easy to discourage him why he's a duck
[31:20] he was born to be in the water
[31:23] and anytime anytime he finds it if you
[31:26] make a muddy pool if there's a rain
[31:27] he'll be right there in the water you
[31:29] may have them out in the bar in your
[31:30] heart brother caleb for years but if he
[31:32] ever smells water he's going to be in it
[31:34] because he's a duck
[31:38] let's see he's got amnesia and lost his
[31:40] identity
[31:41] like our dogs
[31:43] dog was meant to be outside i got a dog
[31:45] that's a squirrel dog but he's lost his
[31:47] identity
[31:49] another dog is a rabbit dog but he's
[31:51] lost his identity let him out of the
[31:52] house the other day and they went and
[31:53] sat on the porch furniture
[31:59] he lost his identity not good for
[32:00] nothing
[32:03] he just wanted to lay on the porch
[32:05] furniture because he's just so used
[32:07] oh god
[32:08] don't you see why we need to have
[32:10] services where we have the spirit of god
[32:12] moving because we don't want to get used
[32:13] to being on the couch
[32:15] he just lays there on that couch of
[32:16] election and predestination oh
[32:18] everything's fine i'm good i'm the bride
[32:20] people feed me come feed me pastor and
[32:22] he waits on you to bring down something
[32:24] and feed him but you ever get that let
[32:25] that dog be a real dog he goes out there
[32:27] and he begins to hunt you train him to
[32:29] hunt you get him out there after the
[32:30] squirrels he'll go after him he'll do
[32:32] what he was born to do oh church that's
[32:34] what we need to be doing we need to be
[32:35] doing what we're born to do not not
[32:37] doing what the things for the world are
[32:39] but what we were born to do amen
[32:43] we're laying on the sofa
[32:48] i'm in trouble now
[32:49] with the joel bail me out tonight
[32:55] we need to quit laying on the sofa
[32:59] i want to be a real duck
[33:01] can you smell the water
[33:05] he said repent from the bottom of your
[33:07] hearts continuation of that quote lay
[33:09] yourself as a sacrifice on the altar and
[33:11] you will be consumed
[33:14] of the world and born again of the
[33:16] spirit and be baptized in the name of
[33:18] jesus christ he'll fill you with the
[33:20] holy ghost
[33:21] go through the right process
[33:23] not come shake hands with the preacher
[33:25] put your name on the book but die
[33:27] so dead that you don't know the world no
[33:29] more
[33:31] amen abel died on the same altar with
[33:33] islam and the only way you're ever going
[33:35] to get right with god is die on the
[33:36] altar with christ until everything
[33:38] becomes blackened around you die there
[33:41] when you raise again you'll be the new
[33:42] creature in christ
[33:45] hallelujah brother brahma said this he
[33:46] said when god's in a heart listen when
[33:48] god's in a heart do you have god in your
[33:50] heart today
[33:51] you believe you do by the holy ghost you
[33:52] have god in your heart he said if god's
[33:54] in you and god's in a heart it'll call
[33:56] you to an old-fashioned holy ghost
[33:58] meeting
[33:58] lord of god glory he said that's right
[34:00] brother he said i know it's my nature
[34:02] hallelujah unless your nature has been
[34:03] changed you'll still listen to the cluck
[34:05] of the old hen
[34:06] but when you smell water if you're a
[34:09] duck you're a gone gosling hallelujah
[34:11] because you're headed for the water
[34:13] thank you lord
[34:15] amen i tell you what that's my testimony
[34:17] that's what that's what brought me in it
[34:19] wasn't any certain preacher it wasn't
[34:21] any certain church but i smelled the
[34:23] water the message of the hour i felt the
[34:25] winds change and the revival of the
[34:27] bride it began to come my way i didn't
[34:29] understand it all at first but i felt it
[34:32] and i knew even though i was raised in a
[34:33] message home more or less i was brought
[34:35] up in the way i should be but i was
[34:37] raised that way but i had to get a
[34:39] revelation for myself one day i smelled
[34:41] the water and everything changed
[34:45] hey man i was a gone gosling hey man i
[34:48] know what it's like to be a gone gosling
[34:49] if that's how you even say that i know
[34:51] what it's like to be a gone gossiping
[34:53] because i smelled the water
[34:56] amen you're headed for the water
[34:59] hallelujah
[35:00] paul said it this way i am crucified
[35:02] with christ nevertheless i live
[35:04] oh i'm dead to my old identity as a
[35:06] chicken but nevertheless i live yet not
[35:09] i but christ liveth in me and the life
[35:11] which i now live in the flesh i live by
[35:13] the faith of the son of god who loved me
[35:14] and gave himself for me
[35:17] hallelujah listen to this before we
[35:19] closed he said no a lot of people don't
[35:20] want to get the birthright because they
[35:22] think it's just a little unpopular they
[35:24] don't want to get down at the altar and
[35:25] cry a little bit or go without a few
[35:26] meals or something another listen
[35:28] whatever happened to people seeking the
[35:29] holy ghost
[35:31] i don't hardly even hear of it anymore
[35:34] you've got to seek the holy ghost
[35:36] and what i mean by that he could feel
[35:37] you the minute you can die
[35:39] but you got to die
[35:42] and i got desperate
[35:44] i told the lord i'm not coming out of
[35:46] this room it's a good thing he brought
[35:47] me out when he did
[35:50] it didn't take long but i had to get
[35:51] that desperate
[35:53] so i was getting mighty hungry
[35:57] what happened to seeking god
[36:00] hey man
[36:01] he said they don't want it because they
[36:02] might have to go without a few meals
[36:05] he said they don't want to do it a lot
[36:06] of the women he said you know makeup on
[36:07] they think it if they'd cry they might
[36:09] wash it off have to put it on again
[36:13] they just don't want it
[36:14] they don't want the new birth because
[36:15] the new birth is kind of messy it's just
[36:17] like any other birth any birth is a mess
[36:19] i don't care where it's at if it's in a
[36:20] pig pen or in the barn if it's in a pink
[36:22] decorated hospital room it's a mess and
[36:24] so is the new birth of mess amen it'll
[36:26] make you do things you didn't think
[36:27] you'd do stand on the corner and be the
[36:29] tambourine sing glory to god hallelujah
[36:31] praise god glory to god while you act
[36:33] like a maniac
[36:34] he said that's what it done to the
[36:35] apostles that's what it done to the
[36:36] virgin mary she acted like she was drunk
[36:38] she was a mess in society but it takes a
[36:41] mess for life to come out of
[36:43] hey man you don't want that handkerchief
[36:44] now it takes a mess for life to come out
[36:46] of he said unless anything dies and rots
[36:48] life can't come from it do we believe
[36:51] that today unless a man dies and rots in
[36:53] his own thoughts christ can't get into
[36:54] his heart when you're trying to think
[36:56] for yourself now if i walk up to the
[36:58] altar and say yes lord i'm a fine fellow
[37:00] i'll take you i'll pay my tithes i'll do
[37:02] this he said you've got to die and rot
[37:03] right there to your thoughts let the
[37:05] holy ghost take over and just do
[37:07] whatever he wants to with you get kind
[37:09] of messy with him he said what was more
[37:11] of a mess than that dignified bunch of
[37:13] jews that day
[37:14] he said then to see those people coming
[37:16] out there with stammering lips you know
[37:17] what a stammer is he said other tongues
[37:19] acting like drunk people brother random
[37:21] demonstrated how a drunk person acted
[37:24] he said uh uh uh and he stumbled around
[37:26] he said that's exactly what they were
[37:27] doing they looked messy
[37:31] go listen to the tape i'm not making
[37:32] that up
[37:33] he said are these men full of new wines
[37:35] but after one kind of got to himself he
[37:37] said let this be known to you and
[37:38] hearken to my words these are not drunk
[37:40] like you suppose it is but he went back
[37:42] to the scripture this is that that was
[37:43] spoken about the prophet joel and it
[37:45] shall come to pass in the last day he
[37:47] says god i'll pour out my spirit upon
[37:49] old flesh that's the way the church was
[37:51] born first
[37:52] how many believes that god is infinite
[37:54] then he cannot change and if that was
[37:56] his idea of a church at the beginning
[37:57] that's the kind of church he'll have at
[37:59] the end he cannot change so how are you
[38:01] going to substitute shaking your hand or
[38:03] sprinkling or some other thing that
[38:05] didn't it didn't happen right there
[38:07] each one of the apostles went right back
[38:09] to that people today will tell you if
[38:10] you listen to tapes in church that means
[38:12] you have the token that's nonsense
[38:15] people will tell you if you listen to a
[38:16] certain preacher that means you have the
[38:17] holy ghost if you believe a certain
[38:19] doctrine it means you have the holy
[38:20] ghost it's nonsense you got to change
[38:23] you substituted something for it back
[38:25] then they substituted shaking a hand or
[38:28] sprinkling or adding your name on a book
[38:29] today we substitute going to a message
[38:31] church and appearing on the stream and
[38:33] letting everybody see that you're a part
[38:34] but you got to die to yourself
[38:38] and be born again
[38:39] in christ
