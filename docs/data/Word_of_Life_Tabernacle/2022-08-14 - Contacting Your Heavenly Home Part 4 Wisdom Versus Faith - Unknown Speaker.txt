mean you need to go and listen to it definitely just spoke to my heart and you look at when god's preparing something you know he prepares it from every angle he's not ever surprised you know he knows both sides and so just if you didn't get a chance to listen to that it's really just just a very good sermon just definitely touched my heart but i think in this day and time what we need to know is god will always make a way for us amen there seems to be no way god's already got away prepared amen blessing this if we invite our pastor to come god [Music] he works in a way we cannot see he will make [Music] he will be [Music] with love and strength for each new day [Music] he will make [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] he will make away for he will be [Music] [Applause] [Music] away [Music] amen heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your house today to thank you for the many wonderful blessings that you've given us the blessing of life to be able to serve you and worship you through liberty lord this morning lord we know that there's many around the world that don't have this privilege that we do we're thankful that we have it today i pray lord that you would help us lord to take advantage of this opportunity that we have and worship you with all that we are body spirit and soul i pray you'd grant that today bless lord the hearing of your word the preaching of your word hold my lips lord that i would only say those things that are right lord and may everything else go away lord we pray that you just bring your atmosphere of faith among us that the sick could be healed lord that the that the dead could be raised that those that are backslidden will be brought back to you we pray you would do it and we thank you for it we thank you in jesus name amen amen god bless you this morning turn with me to john chapter 10 and verse 1. we'll read down to verse 5. john chapter 10 verses 1 through 5. good to have all of our musicians back with us today enjoyed the song service this morning we're going to have prayer with our school children after the service this morning so remember that all of you parents and school school-aged children whether you're homeschooled or go to public school we'd like to pray with you as you begin the school year and and we believe that the lord can protect our children don't we believe that amen amen we believe that today amen now uh let's turn to john chapter 10 and verse 1. he said verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep i love the way it puts that his own sheep it goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice the stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we've been talking about contacting our heavenly home using the sixth sense which is faith and we've found that faith comes through the senses by hearing the word and yet faith is not based on the five senses but it's based on what god said it's it's based on those things that can't be seen yet god uses the sense especially of hearing to bring faith to us and we find that unbelief also comes from that same avenue that what you hear primarily is what the devil the way the devil is going to get through to you is by what you hear the same way that god gets through to you by what you hear and so that creates then an atmosphere so if you're listening to things that produce faith that creates an atmosphere of faith and then we know that an atmosphere means that things can be born there can a seed can come to life in the right atmosphere but in the wrong atmosphere the seed is stifled it cannot grow and so we know that in order for us to become what god wants us to be as as creatures of faith god don't want us to be some cold powerless kind of person that doesn't have any ability to reach out and grab a hold of the promises of god but he wants us to be somebody who can take advantage of the promises that he's given us somebody that can step out in faith and believe what god said how many want to be that kind of a christian today i want to step out and believe what god said i want to be everything that god wants me to be in order to do that you've got to have faith there's got to be an atmosphere of faith in your life and that comes to you by hearing what do we hear the word of god amen that's why the word always takes first place in our services the word takes first place in our lives everywhere we go the word becomes first yes but now we know this is the word of god and yet faith doesn't come by reading right faith comes by hearing not by sight but by hearing that is the sense that god chose to give us faith by is by hearing so there must be a living voice you think of of philip and the eunuch remember the eunuch was a jew he was a proselyte to the jewish religion he was traveling from jerusalem and he got down there in the desert he was reading the prophet isaiah in isaiah 53 where he said he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes were healed he began reading and he couldn't decide whether he was talking about himself speaking of the prophet isaiah or someone else he didn't know anything about jesus and so he's sitting there in the in the chariot he doesn't know and god brings supernatural he brings philip down from where he's preaching a revival brings him down and and causes him to join himself to that chariot puts him down in the middle of the desert and when he comes in he said do you understand what you read and the man said how can i accept some man show me and he didn't have any faith to be baptized because he had not heard but once he heard from someone who was a living voice then he could believe yes i don't say you can't you have faith in this but what gives you faith is somebody listen you don't understand the power of your testimony you need somebody to walk out and tell say i've taken i have believed it and it came to pass in my life right it's one thing to read it it's one thing to hear the story but it's another thing for somebody to walk out and say this works yes how many kids say amen to that this morning this works this message is not an abstract idea it's not a theology or it's not a supposition it's not something that a scientist a theory that they would make and put a with b with c and put it all together and it all works no it's not a theory it's a reality god didn't doesn't save us by theory he never does but he makes he he came as a reality he came in flesh and blood and when the word became flesh it worked it did what it said it would do oh how many are glad for that today the word did what it said it would do and when the word becomes flesh in you the word does what it said it would do it it'll produce a super church it'll produce a bride without spot or wrinkle it'll produce that in this age i believe you we are that yes that's right we have to be that to be the word in our day so the word comes now now watch you hear and you don't only hear faith you hear unbelief right it's everywhere you hear it all the time the devil telling you you can't make it how does he tell you by living voices that's right voices on television voices on movies voices in your car voices on the radio voices in your family voices everywhere constantly telling you and they're speaking against this faith they're saying it can't be done it's a cult if there's nothing good in it and and so it speaks constantly against you and so that comes in it enters your hearing but like i said you've got to take that thought then and arrest it if it's contrary to the word of god but now when we hear now watch what has to happen next we hear then we are what's called a free moral agent a free moral agent it's like someone who is not on either side he gets to choose which side he's going to be on and you get to decide whether you are on the side of unbelief or faith yes how many understand that this morning this morning in this service you get to decide what side that you're on believe how you get to decide am i going to be a believer or am i going to be an unbeliever now watch now god put something in you a seed that would make you make the right choice we all understand that we're predestined to make that choice but we are free moral agents and so when this comes in no there's unbelief and there's faith and we're not fatalistic we don't just have to follow whatever comes in right but here comes a word of unbelief here comes the word of faith and we've got to weigh that and measure it and see if it's with the word of god and if it's not we reject it and if it's if it is we accept it and it's a more powerful thing than what we realized this morning our gospel did not come into word only but in power and demonstration so when a living voice proclaims it when it's demonstrated before us then we get to accept it or reject it by free will and that will determine our eternal destination right now think about it now what is heard must be accepted this is where a lot of times people mess up this is where i mess up sometimes it's not enough just to hear it say well i listen to tapes that's wonderful so does the devil think the devil doesn't know what the prophet said of course he does i go to church i hear you brother ben i listen to your sermon so does the devil he's the most faithful member we got sits in every service sits on the front row right probably right next to brother joel over there the devil said he's the most faithful member but what is he he he's he's always there he believes and trembles the bible says and so you can do that but there's got to be an accepting of that word and a manifesting of that word so it becomes it comes through the five senses it comes to the senses of the spirit we either accept it or reject it and then whether we accept it or reject it if we accept faith faith manifests right we have the manifestation of faith which is works yes right you can't accept it without it manifesting itself if you don't do the works of god if you still live in sin you've never accepted faith because once you accept faith then the works will manifest they will predominate over your body over the senses of your body but if you accept unbelief that also manifests itself now watch what are you listening to this morning now but the random said in in and knoweth it not he said now he said that last man to the last man which is the soul there's only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency's free will to choose or to reject now watch you say well that's you know i i accept it sometimes i reject it some other times you got to watch what you accept and what you reject how many have heard of the mark of the beast right mark of the beast you see it everywhere and you'll see people they're scared they're going to put a chip in their hand or or a tattoo or put something on them you realize brother branham taught us the mark of the beast is already here he said now somebody said there's going to be a mark of the beast it's going to come someday he said let me tell you it's already come he said well when did it come as soon as the holy ghost began to fall the mark of the beast began to take place right because when you see the manifestation of the holy spirit i hope you hear me today that's why the unpardonable sin is to is to mock the holy spirit it's to it's to laugh at the holy spirit and it works for the holy spirit why because that's life or death to accept it or to reject it and jesus said i'll forgive you but there's coming a day it won't be forgiven that's right we don't we don't mock the things of god and that's why even if you're not sure if i'm not sure it's of god study it by the word don't mock it don't laugh at the gifts of god because to reject to reject it if it is god oh lord to reject it could be to take the mark of the beast now watch and someday he said now you see there's going to be a mark of the beast come some day let me tell you it's already come as soon as the holy ghost began to fall the mark of the beast began to take place he said you only have two things one of them is accept it takes the seal of god to reject it takes the mark of the beast oh don't you want to accept it today you realize how real and so many people have prepared themselves for that day and they're looking for it and they're saying oh when that day comes brother ben i'll never take a tattoo on my arm i tell you what i'll stand up and i i won't accept that that mark of the beast when it comes i won't accept that chip in my hand i'm not going to take that shot so many people will do that well i'm not going to do that that's wonderful but what about now what are you accepting this morning what are you rejecting this morning come on because since the holy ghost came what you accept and what you reject will tell your eternal destination see you've already been sealed away if you've accepted faith if you've accepted christ if you've accepted the word you've already been sealed away but to reject it is to take the mark of the beast he said you have two things is to accept it takes the seal of god to reject it takes the mark of the beast to reject the seal of god is to take the mark of the beast right everybody understand yes he said to reject the seal of god is to take the mark of the beast for the bible said all that was not sealed by the seal of god took the mark of the beast when the trumpet sounded and all wanted to go free could go and that didn't was marked he said now you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future now watch there is a future manifestation of it it's going to be made manifest but remember it's got to be taken in accepted or rejected and then it's manifested yes right that's the mark of the beast what we're talking about in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize it's what you've already done but he said so is the holy spirit oh my oh there's the positive side to it yes the mark of the beast is going to be manifested in those that believe not but so is the holy spirit going to be manifested in the bride amen he said when we see the lord jesus coming in glory oh how many are looking forward to that day feel that transforming power see the dead rising out of the grave and know that a second longer you can preach whatever you want to but this is what a prophet of god said he said a second longer will be changed and have a body like his but the bible puts it this way in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed what is that you'll be changed because you accepted the seal of god because you accepted the word of faith yes you heard god's word and you said lord be it unto me that's what mary did she accepted the seal the seed the seal of god because she said be it unto me according to your word that's what you and i are called to today are you with me this morning we are called to accept the word of god and to manifest the word of god like mary until one day we'll our bodies will change with it but you're manifesting it now but one day it'll come into full manifestation the same thing is true of the mark of the beast it's being manifested right now yes why they're doing the will of the church they're accepting the doctrines of the church right now one day it'll come into manifestation it's all around us church brother ben i'm waiting on the end times you better wake up if you're waiting on the end times you don't travel very much you say well in the big cities it's bad wake up our kids are fixing to go back to school and i i uh you know every year it's a struggle should we send them or not and our kids are in public school look at the culture's just full of it look all around us i went to walmart last night get the kids a few things they needed at the last moment because i'm that kind of a dad but jeremy's with me show a saturday night before school starts that's when you do school shopping so i took the kids and we're rushing them through walmarts you know and esther needed a shirt i think it was and i i looked at the shirts and i'm she i guess she's in a women's shirt now so we were looking through the the women's clothing there at walmart on the clearance rack and you're looking through those things because they outgrow them pretty quick and looking through those things and i saw one had care bears on it i took a second look at it it said love is love at walmart it's it's promoting that ideology i walked into i walked to the other side of the store in the ice cream all you'd think you'd be safe in the ice cream aisle they had something there that spoke to me it said fat man that's what it said fat man ice cream and i was looking at that i bought some by the way i was looking at that but in the same thing here's the fat man ice cream i'm looking at that and they're on the other side pride ice cream why do you need to show that through through ice cream but they're pushing an agenda walmart is walmart is they can't sell much of this stuff but i will say this in even in our area among the young people we're holding on by by you say well this is a good area it is in a lot of ways but the young people are not being raised like you were raised they're being raised in a godless society oh god but that's that's the world that's the way it is but we're being raised according to the word of the gospel what are you listening to if you're waiting on the end time to be here it's here but so is the power of the holy ghost yes come on amen so is the word of god so is an open book yeah amen if you're waiting on the end time there was an angel that stood on land and sea and took an open book and said time shall be no more time is no more when he did that there was no more delay that's the hour we live in we live in the fullness of the opening of the word we live in the fullness there's never been a time when it was harder to be a christian and there's never been a time when it was easier to be a christian it's the best of times for the believer it's the worst of times for the unbeliever are you with me this morning man now he said you see about the mark of the beast but when we see jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power will be changed and have a body like his he said it will be made manifest he said then to see those who rejected it will be left down and out he said now the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by five senses the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside men see taste feel smell and hear but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will he said you can accept what the devil says or accept what god says right oh god you can't accept this morning what the devil says well the devil says i'm sick of course he does the devil says i can't be healed of course he does but you can accept what the devil says or what god says and that'll determine he said what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of god it'll feed on the things of god it won't feed on anything of the world jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of god has not even entered this inner part satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god or aren't you glad you got something to live on in this day when there's death all around us when the world has gone crazy and and there's death everywhere the death angel has gone through the land and spiritual death is in every denomination on every church aren't you glad to have a savior aren't you glad to have a word a redeeming word that has come down in our day to keep you from that thing to keep you alive why we've got bread we've got light yes amen we've got fire aren't you glad for that we know what seed we are because we accept it yeah right and brother branham goes on later in his ministry and it makes it really clear that you can't get blood out of a tournament right you you can't you can't make a a seat of god non-seed aren't you glad for that yes you can't make the elect non-elect right you can't make the non-elect elect right they are what they are but whether you accept or reject the word of god tells what you are yes oh my i always want to accept it don't you yes but now you have to accept it from that inner man now only a seed of god can do that he said my sheep my sheep hear my voice my sheep hear my voice they've been pre-programmed yes you ever you remember back in the day we had windows and went different versions the windows came out i don't know if y'all mess with computers very much but i can remember in an office a different version of windows would come out and eventually the stuff you had because we used to have things called cds before that it was floppy disk you have to ask your parents what that is but we had cds you know and we put had a cd-rom some of you still do and you have all your programs on that right but the problem was that eventually the technology reached a place where it wasn't it didn't recognize it anymore there's just no recognizable there was there was no representation there it wouldn't work on windows 11 right it's just not going to work you're never going to get that old copy of of tetris that you've got on a cd to ever work on windows 11. it's never going to happen right because it's not compatible you realize that's the way non-seed are with the word it's just never compatible they may come to church they may sit around for a while and say well you know it seems like a pretty good theory like a good religion seems like it's wise seems good but then after a while something by and by they'll be offended because of the word but if there's a seed of god on the inside of you you've got compatibility you've got representation there's something inside of you that will always work with the word no matter how upgraded it is no matter how far we along we get you'll always work with the word amen why because you were built to do that you were pre-programmed to accept the word oh my you might as well give in to it this morning you're going to one day john 10 24 i love this jesus the jews come to jesus and then came the jews round about him and said to him how long does thou make us to doubt there was the greatest preacher of faith that had ever lived who had the greatest signs and wonders proving who he was and the jews come to him and said you're making us doubt you know why because he was veiled yes it was the word veiled in flesh and they said how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly that you're making us doubt you're hiding it jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me so jesus said i don't have to come out and say i'm the messiah because the works proof who i am listen to me you won't have to go out and and hold a sign say i'm a christian the works that you do every day and i'm not talking about having healing campaigns and running up and down the streets and things like that i'm not talking about that i'm talking about just what you do the way you live you'll be so different from the culture you'll be so different even even if you even if you looked alike to them and dressed in other things you would still be so different yes right and yet you are different in dress you are different in manners you are different in customs but when it comes to there's something inside of you people can tell there's a christian you're different you don't react like the world reacts you don't do what the world does and jesus said i told you and you believe not because the works that i do they bear witness to me if you're a christian today the works that you do will bear witness that you're a christian yes even if you're a child in school the works that you do will bear witness do you believe a child can be saved and be in school and bear witness to the word jesus did it wherever he was and jesus lives in us i tell you what though we better get them to christ yes because if we don't they'll just become what they're around right it's true oh god we better get them to christ now look he said my sheep hear my voice he said you believe not because you're not of my sheep as i said to you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i given to them eternal life aren't you glad for the gift of god today they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand now i want you as we continue on a little bit farther today and i may not get through all of this but we'll just go as far as we can now and then brother allen's going to preach to us tonight we haven't heard from brother allen in a while so it'll be good to hear him now satan's voice appears in the world now listen as the voice of reason yeah that's right satan's voice appears for the first time not as a voice of chaos not as a voice that was crazy some nut with some cult some jim jones that's not how satan's voice started it was the voice of reason yes it made sense right look genesis chapter 3 in verse 1 and we find that the serpent was more subtle that word subtle is crafty shrewd sensible we'll show it in just a moment he said it's more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden he starts out by quoting the word but he begins from a doubt from a doubting perspective it matters how you preach it how you say it because he said has god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden now that's all true but he said he was more subtle than any beast of the field now that word acceptable subtle is crafty shrewd sensible and i hear this a lot said brother ben we want to be sane and sensible with the gospel and that's true that's the quote brother branham said that we want to be insane and sensible with the word yes right right but what appears sane and sensible is often not with the word right and when it's not we need to get rid of it right yes we need to see the word will make sense if you believe but if you don't believe it'll be a strange document yeah it doesn't make sense to the unbeliever you realize you've got to accept it before you can understand it it don't seem like it makes any sense but it's true you've got to come with an attitude of faith and accept the word or you'll never be able to understand the word you've got to accept the author of the word before he can make clear to you what the word is you've got to believe so you can't come to church and and i know that you don't do this i know that you're believers today but just in case that satan would ever you can't come to church cynical you can't come saying well you know i'm going to sit back here and i'm going to wait and if god wants me to know something he'll tell me no you've got to believe what you're listening to right you've got to believe what you're listening to brother branham the angel told brother said if you can get the people to believe you yes sir it's what we talked about last week like if satan can get the ministry uh to perform in such a way uh immoral or something else in front of the people it'll make the people disbelieve ministry and if you can get the people to disbelieve the ministry he's got them right because faith comes by hearing and the worst thing you can do is sit and listen week after week to something you don't believe right because you've been hurt or somebody did it this way somebody did it wrong this way but but you know you may have excuses but you'll never grow from that you've got to be able to believe and you've got to be able to separate the human part from from the word because the human part is always fallible brother branham was fallible brother branham made mistakes moses made mistakes joshua made mistakes but he said as i was with moses so i'll be with you preachers make mistakes somebody said amen pastors make mistakes song leaders make mistakes but we're not we are not basing our eternal destination on the works of a man but on the word of jesus christ you've got to believe what you're listening to and who you're listening to you're never going to get anything out of it right sure you got to have some confidence and that's why sometimes we'll work for years to build confidence before we'll do anything it's like being on the job if you go in first off right away you start firing people then some of you know what i'm talking about if you just go and start firing people after a while i learned that the hard way after a while you know people don't trust you and they they won't work for you because they don't know if you have their best interest at heart but if you go in and begin working and working and working and they see that you've got the best interest of the company at heart they'll work for you well the same is true in preaching the same is true of living for that matter being a husband being a wife you got things under you've got people that you want to listen to you want your kids to listen to you i watch this i've seen some message homes where there'll be y'all forgive me this morning i'm just kind of getting off my notes but i won't go over time the lord will and we'll just stop but there there's some message homes where the kids get to 18 and they're preparing to leave and they just go as soon as they hit 18. i mean just the day and i'm not exaggerating that and you watch that and you know maybe one kid would be that way but but you watch that with kid child after child after child and i'm always wondering what in the world is going on in the home yeah there may be nothing right but more than more than likely there's something going on in the home where where it's not being presented to them in a way that they can grab a hold of it and there's something there that's not being they don't trust their parents because the parent sits back there and when the preacher is preaching about anger and temper and the parent sits back there's amen pastor amen pastor we should not be angry throws a fit on the way home brother alan you got some cleaning up to do tonight you know you're teaching your children not to trust you that's right well we believe we believe the word we shouldn't do these certain things and you go do them you're teaching them known pastors who lived like that and they taught the church not to trust them yeah because they didn't live what they preach we sometimes teach our children and it's not legalism by the way but we teach them forgiveness we teach them how because we say we're sorry it teaches our children to know that there's forgiveness that teaches our children to know that there's mercy you're going to fail you're going to mess up but teach your children that when you fall down you get back up when you mess up you don't quit going to church when you when you have problems you don't lay down and lay out and go out in the bars and get drunk but you come back to the altar you come back to christ come on i think sometimes our kids need to see us at the altar we pray over the children but i like to pray over the children and the parents before they go to school because sometimes it's the parents that need it but the matter said it wasn't child delinquency he said it's parent delinquency oh god help us today we need to find our place at the altar so the children can find their place there we need to find our place in worship so the children can find their place there they're never going to be what we're not are you with me this morning i know that's hard but we got to live it or we're just teaching our children the opposite of what we intend to teach oh my when they see somebody who falls somebody who fails but somebody who gets back up somebody who finds their place back at the altar they can say i want a god like that yes because you will make mistakes some of you haven't lived long enough to make mistakes but your parents can tell you you will make mistakes you'll mess up it has nothing to do with whether you're a seed of god or not now look yeah god help us today satan said let me tell you something oh yeah we say god is true we believe that word now he always starts that way doesn't he satan said i believe that real sure but listen let me tell you he didn't exactly mean that he did mean that he meant just what he said genesis 3 2 the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die or as brother branham said surely a good god wouldn't do that yeah you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened you shall be as gods knowing good and evil see there's some things god didn't want them to know i hope you hear me today i don't want my children to know what it's like to live in a broken home i don't want my children to know what it's like for their dad to be an alcoholic for their for their mother to be running around on the streets running the clubs i don't want them to know what that's like there are some things paul said i would that you were that you were wise concerning the gospel and that you were ignorant concerning the world sure some things god didn't want his children to know he didn't want them to know what it felt like to have heartache to lose a loved one to know what it's like to have murder or suicide god didn't want them to know what that felt like are you with me this morning he didn't want him to know there's some things you'd have been better off not knowing he said well i want to go out in the world so i'll know these things there's some things you'd be better off not knowing we don't want you to know what it feels like to come down and crash after a night of partying or a night of regret we don't want you to know what it feels like we want you to know what it feels like to come to the house of god and have freedom in worship we want you to know what it feels like to come and feel the presence of god moving in a mighty way through a soul that's not been scarred by all of those things that can still worship god that can still love god with all that they have we want you to know those things but if you do fall yeah if you do mess up and when you do i want you to know mercy i want you to feel what it's like to to know that there's mercy for you that's what god wanted for his children he knew they would mess up he knew that they would mess up he knew they would deny his word but he wanted them to know amen what mercy was like right hallelujah amen he said the devil said he said you don't have enough education he said but i've got wisdom i'll prove it to you he said now look you don't know what's right or wrong you know there is such a thing but you don't know what it is let me show you how it's done she said but we'll die he said surely god won't do that you know she'll be wise too he put his wisdom against god's word he said there's the wisdom i'm talking about but the brandon said wisdom as long as it agrees with the bible is right whenever wisdom doesn't agree with the word it isn't right listen to me this morning the word of god can be proven true god proves his own word it can be proven true but only if you believe it right yeah oh god it can be proven true it's proven true to abraham if you go to romans chapter 4 and verse 17 or verse 18 he said who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to also to perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness don't you see abraham believe god and it was imputed for righteousness abraham believed god and god proved it to be true you've got to believe god first right before it can be proved see that's that was the problem with with pilate that was the problem with herod they said to jesus prove to me that you're the messiah and i'll believe you that's what people say about the message today prove that the message is right prove that the cloud was a certain place at a certain time prove all these things then we'll believe no if you believe he'll prove it to you but if you don't believe you it can never be proven yes are you with me now he said no matter how there's no reasoning to it at all he just takes the word and holds on to it speaking of abraham he said now if this is the word of god if this is the word of god if you believe it then why doubt any word of it can we say amen to that this morning if this is the word of god and this is the word of god this is it folks you're going to find out what brother branham taught we believe what brother branham taught because he opened to us the scriptures how did they know who jesus was he opened the scriptures to them and showed him who he was we believe in the message of the hour that shine light on the scriptures this is the word of god this is what we hold to there's no other standard the standard is not what my family preaches what my church teaches the standard is not what other message people do this is it yes the word of god is the standard right and so he said there's no reasoning to it he just takes the word and holds on to it how many of you can hold on to the word this morning and he said why doubt any word of it any promise of it how can you say that this is part and this is no good so you take your bible and you say well i believe this part not this and this is no good and this is that pick out what you want can't do it right you can't take the the modern church today is trying to take romans 1 out of the bible you can't do it right many people try to take certain passages and i've heard this let me just nail this before i before i leave this morning i've heard this well the prophet said to a certain individual so i don't have to believe this part of the word if it's the word it's the word paul said those things you heard of me among many witnesses yeah teach that as doctrine yes right this is the word not a man's opinion not my opinion whenever a pastor's opinion becomes higher than the word of the church has a problem right yes you ought to be able these school children ought to be able to come to me and if i'm not on the word they ought to be able to challenge me on it why because the word is the word right whether the preacher believes it or not the word is right whether the church teaches it or not he said if this is the word of god you believe it don't doubt any word of it he said you can't pick out part of it it's either all good or there's none of it good he said as soon as you see that it's the truth you've got to believe it first take hold of it don't turn it loose no matter what circumstances how they try to reason why you can't don't do that he said it all stay right with it god promised it he said now faith simply trusts in his word that's what he wanted them to do he said now you get the background he said that's exactly what god wanted the human race to do to trust in every word he said and eve trusted a whole lot of it but one little thing she accepted she accepted unbelief in one word oh god he said well if i become full of wisdom maybe it was that way maybe it's supposed to be this way then right there is where she lost her hold that's where she started sinking right there this message you'll never be able to teach it in such a way as to make it psychology it'll never work because psychology has error in it it may be able to identify certain things but it has error in it science has error in it but the word has no error in it we don't understand why it's right but it's right we can't even see why it's right but it's right and then god reveals it to us yes and then right there is where she lost her hold that's where she started sinking right there that's where the whole human race went right down to the grave right there because she doubted one word some of them say well i believe this is true i believe that's true i believe god can say but i don't believe he heals i believe the holy ghost sure fell on the day of pentecost but there's no place where there's anything anything says the holy ghost fell after pentecost he said oh brother that's the way they say it call themselves the churches of christ having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof you must believe don't reason believe don't try to have wisdom believe the word and wonder how much of what we've attributed to pastoral wisdom is just unbelief i know when i say when i preach about pastors it's hard to say amen because i am one brother bennett we are we amen and against you but it's truth you can take that what you want it to but look the word is right if the pastor's wisdom goes along with the word then it's right but if the pastor wisdom said pastors wisdom says oh you can't fellowship with those people it's not what the word right that's true if the pastor's wisdom says well we're going to do things a certain way well they the holy ghost don't really fall like it used to stay with the word just believe the word you see god's going to judge by some standard it won't be by any message faster that's right right it's true all right and you're not going to be able to make it in because you said oh i accepted the pastor's word hallelujah every word he said every word he ever said across the pulpit brother ben was my pastor and i accepted it i went to such and such a church in the message and i accepted every word he said you're probably not going to make it because every word i say may not be thus saith the lord what do you accept the word the word are you with me this morning yes you have to trust me to believe it but you got to accept the word you must believe don't reason believe don't try to have wisdom believe the word not your pastor not the church not anything else the word yes believe the word because that's what god's going to judge the world by right see the bible says that no script no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation because the prophecy came not an old time by the will of men but holy men of god's fake as they were moved by the holy ghost but the branham said faith believes it is written and says the word has no flaws why don't we repeat that this morning the word has no flaws do you believe that the word has no flaws oh god he said he said well he was talking about his own word that's not what he said he said did you ever hear ministers say well i tell you the king james version or this revised version or this here it's just a little different really it don't really mean that have you heard that he said oh my the world is contaminated with it but faith don't believe that what's he talking about the bible faith believes a god that can make me you believe god made you brother wyatt god made you god made you the bible says we're fearfully and wonderfully made the god made you if god made you then he can keep the word right if god made me a god that can make me can keep that book in order for me to live by oh my if the god who made me is going to judge me can't keep his book in order then he's a very poor god he said there you are i believe every word of it is the truth yes sir what does this do to believe that it gives faith a perfect resting place in it he said see you cannot disbelieve that he said that that word is messed with in any way you've got to believe it just the way it is again you can come and try to prove it where it would make sense to people part of it's not right and part of it is there are many denominations to try to prove mark 16 is not in the original but if you take that tax you preach unbelief to the people and you end up with a lifeless morgue but if you preach faith to the people we believe what the word says what comes out of it is a church full of the holy ghost and faith because that's the power of the word he said if you try to use wisdom and say now look here it's not reasonable that god said it would do a thing like this but god did do it yeah see a preacher is not a philosopher a preacher is not a psychologist a preacher is a proclaimer what the word says that's what the preacher has to preach what he's inspired about the word you understand and so it's not we're not here to to try to reason with you and try to tell you it don't mean what it says he said now if you say well now if god did this if he took a man's life because he wasn't a levite but his hand on the ark one was about to fall no matter how much he was he said he took his life for it god said just levi shalom would touch that now i know that people have taken this and said well only a minister can handle the word and i don't see where brother branham taught that he did teach us that there were some doctrines and things that would be better if you left that to your pastor to explain right because god didn't call that god didn't call you to do that right but he didn't ever tell you not to touch the word listen what he said a levite nothing but a levite was supposed to touch the ark and here the ark was coming right back for revival one outside of that tried to handle the word he said it goes to show only the anointed of god has touched that word he doesn't say just preachers he said the anointed of god he said these creeds and denominations got no business tampering with it right so you don't put your hand on it the preacher's hand the person would lay at his hand we don't put our hands on it if you don't understand it don't try to explain it live it yes believe it yes are you with me this morning he said who has a right to the word the holy spirit does yes he said just the holy spirit has got a right to that word and it's death for any other to touch it yes or to disbelieve any of it or teach it amen he said the same will be taking his part out of the book of life don't put your hands on it stay away from it listen believe just what it says how many could do that this morning believe what it says take what it said stay right with the word it's death to do anything else to it what does faith do it believes it just the way it is amen that's the way god has preserved it down to the age and here it is it's the word of god for me how many believe that this morning it's the word of god for me god honors that he said it gives a perfect faith in its trueness how could you go out here and say here's a boat it's got a lot of holes in i'll put some grass sacks in it perhaps maybe it'll stem the tide to cross the river he said i wouldn't want to take a chance on it yes you remember being at the nile river in egypt and here we were waiting on a ferry and here come a bunch of taxis water taxis just a canoe looked like it had been made out of a log or something just a little a little wooden canoe and the great nile river there and here's come these guys with the canoe now they say the the river there is too polluted for crocodiles but i wasn't taking any chances plus i can't swim and i don't think joel can't either so he couldn't help me so we're standing there at the river and those guys come come on come on you know they sit there at the bank and want you to take their taxi across why would i take that taxi when there was a ferry coming made out of metal i think it was made out of better material anyway that it proved it could cross the river time and time again why would we take man's ideas why would we take some guy on youtube when there's a fairy when there's a book amen let's cross the river time and time again this word has proved itself to be true over and over and over again oh my i'm going to close now as the catholic church came along and tried to keep the word out of the people's hands by reasoning martin luther read the just shall live by faith and when he believed that word and accepted it a reformation shook europe the boat crossed the river when john wesley read without holiness no man shall see the lord and accepted it as sanctification in his life he accepted it as the word of god england and america shook under that revival the azusa street pentecostals read that god put nine spiritual gifts in the church and change the course of history god did it within less than 50 years and now pentecostalism's all over the world why because somebody believed god's word yes it took it took somebody to say it's true are you with me this morning brother branham read hebrews 13 and 8 luke 17 and 30. revelation 10 1-7 and stood there and said it's true and proved it to be true yes oh my we've seen the sign of the son of man the opening of the seven seals god proves his word he interprets his word by bringing it to pass but now it's our day yes or you hear me today and now that the fields have been opened we read not just part of the book but we can read any chapter in the book any word in the book he said the bible become a new book and now we look at it and say it's true yes what what's true all of it what's true all of it the bible said they'll lay hands on the stick and they shall recover it's true the bible said the holy ghost was to them they believed as many as the lord our god shall call it's true the bible said there would come a prophet in the last age we've seen it it's true the bible said that the church would be a spotless bride without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb i'm here to proclaim to you this morning it's true don't reason with it don't try to take wisdom and say well it's not what it was supposed to be it's true it has to be true or it'll never prove itself true to you yes well what do we do in this age revelation 10 and 8 amen he proves himself he said the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and went unto the angels and said to him give me the little book he said take it and eat it up it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey i took the little book out of the angel's hand what did i do with it i didn't reason with it i didn't cut it apart but i ate it yes i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter there were things in it hard to digest and he said unto me that must prophesy again thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings somebody's got to read that word and say it's true it's true we read that today and like the eagles scream we say mama that's me i've heard that somewhere before i identify with that it proves itself to be true musicians go ahead and come the bible says you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart you say well the people at school don't believe it let him prove it to be true by your life the people at work don't believe it let him prove it to be true the people at the church don't believe it let him prove it to be true by your life he proves his own word amen but we can't take satan's wisdom we must cast down reasonings accept the word in his fullness and let the word prove itself true would you bow your heads with me just before we we're gonna have prayer in just a moment for the school children and teachers and parents maybe satan's tried to come at you in some way to get you to disbelieve the word well maybe it don't matter did god say it is it in the word i'll go as far as this don't cross the message of the hour that's the light god sent on the word if you're knowingly living outside the message doing things you know brother branham taught from the bible wasn't right you sit there and you try to reason with it just just let it go let the word be proved true in your life let him prove himself true to your family to your children to your church one day they may never accept it but one day they'll stand on that day of judgment and say god you proved yourself to be true you proved it through my life let's just pray that way heavenly father i pray lord that you would work in the lives of each one of these people or maybe there's someone here who's just not living the word like they know they should i i pray you'd help them to live it today our gospel came not in word only but in power and demonstration of the spirit i pray it would be so lord i pray you would release us from all guilt all all shame all all of the things of the world help us to know that lord we've found mercy and grace at the foot of the cross lord if there's something of unbelief comes in and and lord it tries to take over our mind help us to arrest it to send it back to the borders where it came from another thought may come in but that one didn't ever take hold and build a house i pray and grant it today lord we ask that you come and lord bless these people lord that have heard the word today may it create an atmosphere of faith not of unbelief not of wondering oh am i seed of god lord may it be an atmosphere of faith lord i believe i believe there's a reason why i've responded to the word i believe that you're my savior believe that you're my god everything's gonna be okay i pray you'd grant that today we ask you in jesus name amen let's sing this together [Music] revelations nations [Music] oh yes overcoming sins [Music] amen you believe it today amen god bless you just before you come every year i struggle with whether to send my kids back to public school i'll just be open and honest with you i i do i worry about the influences i worry about the struggles that they'll have and every year we have because the lord has made a way and we're not very good teachers but i'll leave that up to you as far as what you do or some children probably shouldn't be in public school you as parents you know that better than anybody else and you know how to handle that god will give you wisdom to handle that but i know it's a scary feeling especially when there's been these these murders these mass killings that taking place in the school system and you look out and you think is there any place safe why would someone kill children what kind of a devil would motivate somebody to do that and i'm not scaring you this morning you know the possibilities of that you know if a person is determined to do something like that but we believe that the angel of god's protection comes down and protects our children takes care of them some of you the older ones going to school by the trip brother peter they're going to high school that's hard i never had to do that but some of the ones here by the levi knows what that's like sister noli they've come through the some of the public school system at least through part and they know what that's like but they made it and they're christians today some of you come through public school and you made it what you need is the holy ghost in your life you need that you need that reassurance you need to believe the word believe the word if someone asks you a question why do you do what you do i believe the bible i believe it's the word of god don't let anybody talk you out of that you can come keep coming to church you i know it's tiring when you get to that time and and it's tiring it's hard because your kids are in school that's the time to come to church because all during the the summer you've got them but now during the school year the school's got them now's the time to bring your kids to church let them be in that atmosphere where they can receive the holy ghost if you're a child or a parent the school age and you want to bring your children to the front or a teacher we have brother gabe here sister mary's not here today they had a death in the family a cousin of hers we need to be praying for them but if you're a school teacher or work in the schools if you're a parent or a or a child in school come to the front so let's just gather around the front we'll have prayer with you today i want us all to pray and you that are not you don't have children but you have grandchildren and things like that you pray you pray we want to lay hands on on these children before they go we don't know what tomorrow holds i'm telling you this area isn't the protection it once was we can't say well i live in northern arkansas it'll never happen i've told you this morning it's here it's all around us it's on the internet it's everywhere it's among the people but there is a god who keeps us safe regardless aren't you glad for that today i want you to lay hands on one another your own children your own family you pray for them you're the ones that can do that best peter would you come peter and esther come up here where's melody she's over here let's let's come over here these kids work here in the church they're mean so much to me but i can't keep them the lord has to do that amen heavenly father lord jesus as a father lord standing here with my wife and my children i pray for them today lord lord i pray that you'd be with them lord as they enter the school place lord we know it's no place of godliness the lord we know that you can shine even as a light and i've seen you do it before through these lord children through these little ones lord that believed your word even when they were small or they believed you and they trusted you o god lord we believe that you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord has you kept them in past years would you keep them once again lord some of these children here in the church it
