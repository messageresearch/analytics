so thankful to be your bride Lord to be called lord out of the things that this world is coming to thank you for it Lord we love you and we thank you for your blessing Your Grace keep us now according to your word in Jesus name amen amen I'm going to read from Revelation chap 6 verse 12 we'll read down through verse 17 tonight we uh approach The Sixth Seal and my intention again with these uh first six seals to get you interested so it's not uh an overview by any uh means or comprehensive by any means there's so much here I'll say this uh I've gotten so much out of going back and listening to the sermons again so be it do us good just to do that you know we still believe the message around here and we still believe God sent a prophet and and he did that for a reason so it's for us to hear and and so uh we uh I really would encourage you to do that if you don't get one of these Wednesday nights maybe go back and listen to that then go back and listen to the tape I think that would do you good where brother brandom taught it because uh there's so much more than what we can get to in a 30 minute or 45 minute time frame but thank you for being patient with me as we go through this six seal tonight there's just so much here we're going to have our Bibles open because there's so much scripture he uses in this Revelation 6:12 I beheld when he open the six seal and oh there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together every mountain and Island were moved out of their their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated these things in the six seal happen after the bride is gone the bride cannot go through the tribulation the more I read about the tribulation the more I want to be a part of that bride but I realized I can't make myself a part of it he had to choose me to be part of it but I would say today that the fact that you've heard you're you're the chosen of the earth just to have heard heard and just to have known the message of the hour so I'd say you might as well put yourself in the in the bride group there ain't no point being a foolish virgin there ain't no point in being a gentile it's going to be a hard time for the Gentiles as well as the Jews after in the tribulation period and we know that that's what this six seal speaks of is tribulation the bride cannot go through tribulation but the brandom said cause she she has not one sin not one sin we can just stop there and preach for a while not one sin all right I go back to communion can I take communion brother the B not one sin against the bride that's past present and future right the the mistakes that we make you don't even see it are you with me now but you wouldn't want to break that for nothing right right you you wouldn't desire there's nothing in you to want to break that to want to go against his word but if you do something that was wrong there is there's not one sin that the bride has well that ought to set us on a solid place that that ought to put some Foundation underneath our feet and and something there are bad things don't happen to us because we sinned right because how could God judge us for something that he doesn't even see how can he put us through tribulation when we're already perfect brother Bram said a man doesn't marry a woman and then and then try to reform her and and put her through a bunch of hardship know he marries her so he can keep her so he can so he can protect her from every every evil on every hand I'm so glad that's where the bride is today sir not one sin not a thing against her the grace of God has covered her over and the bleach has took every sin so far away there's not even a remembrance of it he said not a thing but Purity perfect in the presence of God he said oh it ought to make the bride get down on her knees and cry out to God Amen such a wonderful thing we could preach that all night brother brandom in The Sixth Seal and and many of you are familiar with this he he tells a western love story so if you want to hear a good love story go to the six seal and listen to that I can't tell it like brother brandham did he tells about the the man from Chicago the the son of the owner of the armor packing company and how he he come down to a big shindig that they had going uh down in the west where they had the the the ranch and that they own and all the the the girl girls there the daughters of the foreman they were dancing and parting dressing up and getting ready trying to attract this young man's attention but one night he sees a young lady go out from the kitchen and she's carrying a dish pan of water she's Barefoot she doesn't have any shoes on and she's walking down to the coral to throw away the water he sees her and he goes around the coral to meet her and he he meets her out there runs into her and she's shy and he begins to talk to her and the next night he he finds a reason to go talk to her and the next night he finds another reason to go talk to her and he finds in her a character that those other girls don't have and he told her he said you know I found this character in you he said will you marry me and she said yes what else was she going to say she said yes and then but he he went away he said I'm going to come back at a certain time and and we'll be married and so he goes away to prepare her home and she said I've never had a home he said I'm going to make you one oh is that the way you feel tonight and uh she never had a home he's going to make her a home and so what does he do he goes out and uh or she goes out and she starts saving her pennies and preparing herself brother the brand said it was a perfect type of the Bride trying to prepare herself trying to get her wedding garment ready and and and sew it or whatever she had to do to put it on and she said all her all her cousins laughed at her and made fun of her and said you said today was the day and you said this was the hour and he hasn't come yet she said I got five more minutes and she said about the time that five minutes was up you could you could hear the sand under the wheels of the Buckboard here he come driving up and he put her up on there she left her denominational cousins behind oh I love this story she left her denominational cousins behind and went home to be with him I tell you that's where we're at church before the tribulation Falls we're going home to be with him right we've been chosen for our character not because we were rich not because we had anything else but God saw a character in us not even a character that was for here on the Earth but something before the foundation of the earth he chose us above everyone else in the world I just have to be grateful that don't make me arrogant or hotty just makes me grateful now brother brandom in The Sixth Seal he tells the people to take their Bibles and I want you to take your Bible tonight if you have one with you and we'll put it on the screen if you don't but and he tells them take their Bibles and open it to Matthew 24 and Revelation 6 take our Bibles and hold them like this and with your fingers in the Bible so you can see Matthew 24 and Revelation 6 and he's going to compare those two scriptures so we're going to do that as as we kind of lay a foundation and then go into the Sixth Seal remember this seal is the Judgment seal it's a tribulation period now Scholars have always said Matthew 24 Jesus is speaking of the coming judgment he's speaking of uh of of of uh the his second coming and and the tribulation period And so brother brand was going to compare that to the seals Matthew 24:1 Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down they they couldn't even imagine how that would happen as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of th coming the end of the world brother Bram said this happened on Tuesday afternoon April the 4th 830 and then Tuesday evening they came to him privately so he's at the temple and then he goes and sits on the Mount of Olives and they ask him three questions they say when shall these things be as one what shall be the sign of th coming that's two and of the end of the world that's three Jesus answers all three questions now brother Brandon begins to compare uh the seals to in Revelation 6 so go to Revelation 6 and then you're at Matthew 24:4 and Revelation 61 Revelation 61 I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given to him he went forth conquering to conquer we found out that was an antichrist deceiving Spirit right now most denominations teach that that is Christ in fact I I found almost all of them teach that but go back to Matthew 24:4 what did Jesus say Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I'm Christ and shall deceive many right so let's go to the second seal Revelation 6:3 Revelation 6:3 when he'd open the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that set there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another there was given unto him a great soar and compare that with Matthew 246 do you believe this message is scriptural it's absolutely it has to be because all of our foundation of our Doctrine has to come from the scripture so Matthew 24:6 what what does it say you shall hear of war and rumors of War see that you be not troubled all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet let's go to the third seal Revelation 6:5 when he'd opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see I beheld in L Black Horse He that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny I love the voice speaking saying see thou hurt not the oil and the wine right and compare that to Matthew 24:7 the first part of the verse Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be what famines famines what kind of famine spiritual famine for the word of God as well as natural famines but it was spiritual famine that the seal was talking about because the Catholic church had it all locked up okay the fourth seal Revelation 6:7 Revelation 67 are you with me so far it says and we need open the force still I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and beheld a Pale Horse and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth kill with sword and with Hunger with death and with the Beast of the earth and compare that with the last half of that seventh verse again nation will rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences earthquakes in diverse places pestilences diseases death right we' we've seen a little bit of that haven't we diseases death pestilence is brother BR said that Pale Horse He was spiritual death if you look up that word pestilence it's a plague it's a plague and the last plague that that strikes this nation is not coid right right it's spiritual death spiritual death is the LA we see it everywhere today it's the last plague that strikes the nation so so it says in Matthew 248 all these are the beginning of Sorrow so there's your four seals now the fist seal Revelation 69 Revelation 69 when he' open the fist seal I saw on the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and Aven our avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them it was said unto them they should rest yet for a little season until the fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now let's go to verse 9 Matthew 24:9 now what does it say then they shall they deliver you up to be afflicted shall kill you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake now we know there are Christian Martyrs he's speaking of but now look and then shall many be offended shall betray one another shall hate one another if you didn't if the Nazis weren't a that people that hated people I don't know who was right ikan and Hitler and those people that did that Stalin what there was hate on the earth for people why because the Bible said there would be right it it was it was there's something coming and God knew about it doesn't that give you faith and courage you know if he knew about that didn't doesn't he know about your life doesn't he know about what would happen in your life and the things you've been going through he knew that before it would come if he knew this this many years before it came thousands of years before it came to pass now look six seal Revelation 6:12 now we get down to where we're at I beheld we need to open the Sixth Seal we'll just read 12 and 13 when he opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sacko of hair the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she shaken of A Mighty Wind let's compare Matthew 24:29 remember there's there's many things Jesus says between that but now look at verse 29 it says immediately after the tribulation of those days what was the tribulation of those days Hitler and ikan World War II right shall the sun be darkened huh that's coming up the sun will be darkened the moon shall not give her light what did it say over in Revelation there was a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth of hair the moon became as blood it's the same thing yeah right that's the tribulation and so he says and the Stars shall fall from Heaven the powers of the heaven will be shaken that's exactly the same thing he says in Revelation 6:13 he said that the stars of Heaven fell to the Earth like a fig tree casting her untimely figs when she shaken of A Mighty Wind so then brother brandom tells us that he omits the seventh seal right but he goes and he says this he said verse 32 Matthew 24:32 and that's the last that we'll deal with there in comparing those twoo he said now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is n now who is the Fig Tree how many know Israel Israel's the Fig Tree what happened in 1948 I think sometimes we need to go back and learn our history something happened in our in our time if you could say it that way people that are alive maybe here in this building in 1948 I don't want to date you but uh I know there's folks that are listening on tonight that we're alive but I know brother sister Curtis you guys were alive in 1948 there's probably several others that were too I think about you were you were alive when this scripture came to pass right this is recent this just happened oh my when his branches yet tender and put us forth leaves you know summer is not something coming yes so we've seen that now in during the the purpose of the sick seal and you think about it what what what's the purpose of theur tribulation period it's not just although it is God punishing the Earth but it's not just that the SI what the sick seal does is it purifies the Earth for the Millennium but it also it also takes the uh foolish virgin and they're killed during that time because they have to be purified right and that's those who didn't have the fullness of the atonement they were not the bride but they were good to the bride or they had uh they they had some there was some way that they make it in and then that's maybe a denominational believer somebody like that I'm not sure exactly how that'll work but God knows who those people are so then uh there's another group though and this is the main reason for the sick seal is the Jews because there's 144,000 Jews I want to watch want you to watch this brother Brown types it to Jacob Jacob he calls it Jacob's trouble Jacob wrestling and if you if you go and and study the Jewish Nation you find that they wrestle with God with the concept of being the chosen people they're wrestling with the idea of being God's people and and the fact that they are God's people hasn't done them much good right think about that they've been they've called themselves God's people and so people persecute them people make fun of them people hate them and all they'd have to do is give up their testimony and they wouldn't hate them no more that sounds familiar doesn't it so it it seems like it' be so much easier to not be God's people and I've heard Jewish people actually Express that we were chosen for what right chosen for persecution chosen for uh for misery chosen to to be killed but there's more than that that we're also chosen to be delivered right because Israel will be saved as a nation all of predestined Israel be saved as a nation now so he said Jacob wrestling with God until they see something real that something real will be the two prophets of Revelation 11 we'll get to that in just a moment but brother BR said there stands Moses there stands Elijah he said and they'll wrestle with God until 144,000 of the tribes of Israel are called out right there and he said these come preaching repentance he said like John the Baptist they preach repentance to go back to the word of God to Believe In Christ and and I like the fact that they preach repentance people say well preaching's over I don't think so come on because even after the Gentile age the two prophets are going to preach they preach repentance it's amazing to me that God's not going to take a tape player and preach to him but it's going to be prophets right men I'll have to stand there Anointed with the spirit of Moses and Elijah or however it'll be brother brand said he he thought that it would be men Anointed with that spirit so they come and they preach and the sun becomes black right refuses to give her light now that's happened before right so brother Bram goes back into Exodus chapter 10 and we find when the Lord said to Moses stretch out thy hand toward Heaven that there may be Darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be felt what was this the Deliverance of Israel the Deliverance of the nation of Israel at that time the sun is darken Moses stretched forth his hand toward Heaven There was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days they saw not one another neither Rose any from his place for three days but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings he said' now God was about to deliver Israel there all right bring them out of their enemy hand which was Egypt at that time he said now here he is bringing them out of the Roman hand where they made their Covenant remember they make a covenant with with Rome and then the Covenant is broken and then all nature lets loose right at the preaching of those two prophets Daniel 121 this is the time frame at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people there shall be a time of trouble such as never ever was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book amen the BR said the predestinated you see that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be delivered at that time he said here God is about to deliver his second son Israel after the tribulation he had his only begotten son was Christ his second son was Israel and those he delivers them by the ministry of the two prophets Revelation 11:3 is where the two prophets prophets are are in the scripture he said I will give power un my two witnesses they shall prophesy 1,2003 score days as three and a half years clothed in sackcloth east of the two olive trees the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies BR said that's the word you think the word's not powerful yeah he said that's Holy Ghost Fire God's word expressed through a prophet's lips yes brother BR takes that he said when Moses he said that it was a thought that God that came to Moses he said it was God's thought that you put in moses' heart he said and then Moses spoke it it became the word of God right all right so that's what these prophets are going to be they're going to preach the word of God but they will not be Gentiles so someone comes to you and says well I'm one of those two prophets whether they're not right they're not number one they wouldn't be coming to you and telling you they got a people to preach to and it's not us right and I got personal history with that my dad thought that he was one of these two prophets so I've studied this man I but I've known several and that come popped up from time to time be one of these two prophets they're Jews right they they come to Israel they speak Holy Ghost fire nature is erupted at their message right it's not some preacher out here somewhere making tapes and calling themselves Moses or Elijah but they have Holy Ghost Fire Revelation 11:6 these have power to shut Heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy who did that Elijah did that power over Waters to turn them to blood to Smite the Earth with plagu often as they will who did that Moses did that so we know who these two prophets are brother brandom picks that up he said what is it what can bring these things but the word amen oh if the word of God's going to change nature what do you think it's going to do what do you think brings the Rapture you realize it won't be emotion it won't be sensation it won't be a church it won't be it'll be the word if the word spoken by a prophet could bring Make nature stop then the word already spoken by a prophet in this generation will say one day your bodies will be changed the word spoken by a prophet the Apostle Paul when he spoke we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and then brother brandom stands there at the the time of the Rapture he said and it shall come to pass where are we at church the word is going to change us amen hallelujah he said what is it what can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on this six seal sir they uncover and open it up it's the power of God to interrupt nature see the sick seal is completely an interruption of nature there's your seal who does it it's the prophets on the other side of the Rapture and now here is these two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to Nature they want to and they shake the Earth he said they open that Sixth Seal they have power to do it there's your Sixth Seal coming open if you listen to brother brand preaching this it means a lot to him why because it tells us what God's doing here was these are men but God's going to use them to shake the Earth but he already used a man in this generation to shake heaven and we are going to go in a Rapture because God spoke it he used a man yes the man made mistakes yes the man was a man was human being right and many times God's prophets make mistakes and are misled but when they grab God's thought right and they speak it it becomes the word of God and he said the move is on for the bride I say that's the word of God he said there's a Rapture coming he said I'm going to speak it he said it's coming and th sayith the Lord I say I believe that word is going to change our bodies going to change nature I could go run around your room come on you know what that means to me the word is going to change nature I don't mean means I'm not subject to your opinion I already have a word I don't need another Prophet I don't need another I don't need somebody else to come along and tell me what's going to happen I've got a word that's going to change my body I I got a word nobody can put me out you didn't put me in you can't put me out I got a word word is going to change my body ought to make us happy shouldn't it it ought to make us joyful it ought to make us love God with all of our heart I'm a part of something that's going to change me yes sir going to deliver me from these times Amy man I don't think we should get too caught up I know everybody's worried about everything going on and now we all get a alarm on our phone today and and uh everybody's worried about that but I I said you know it is an hour if you knew what they could really do with your phone fact they can push an alarm to your phone is nothing compared to what they can actually do with your phone you ever talk about something and and it shows up on Facebook you get the ad for it you realize they can listen to you at any moment that's not a conspiracy theory that's just a fact brother that's creepy isn't it you think about it your TV listens to you if you have one they turn it off man even if it's turned off they can turn it on if is plugged in that's actually go look it up they can do that but I wouldn't get too worried about it I wouldn't get too caught up in it all right because that's not our promise our promise is not tribulation our promise is not what is the government going to do to me that's not my promise my promise is going home I'm going home I'm going to leave this world I'm going to buypass all of it amen amen he said here's the secret of it the prophets the Bible said so here they can open anytime they they can do anything in nature they want to they do the same thing they did do cuz they know how it's done he said here God is about to deliver his son Israel again I'm skipping through this sick seal you'd have to go back and listen to the whole thing because it's it's almost three hours long he said after the same manner of the tribulation he did down there he sent Moses down there and delivered Israel is that right he done these very same things he sent Elijah to Ahab and 7,000 came out is that right he said sends them right back over here again in the time of the the tribulation and calls out the 144,000 now look what happened again we're going to go back in scripture and look what happened when when he called his only begotten son he's about to deliver him what happened Matthew 27:45 now from the sixth hour there was what Darkness over the land to the ninth hour the same thing happens every time he delivers his son Israel is his son yes look at Isaiah chapter 13 and verse 6 brother the Brenham ties this in as well and he reads this during The Sixth Seal Isaiah 13:6 how ye for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt what did Jesus say men's heart will be failing for fear verse eight they should be afraid is that come on we're we're nearing that time right now but they're going to be a whole lot more afraid than they are now pains and Sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it the stars of the heaven now listen and the constellation thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened there it is again the six seal the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of The Proud deceased I will lay low the hotess of the terrible brother the brand said see there just exactly Isaiah saw the same thing that Jesus spoke of that the seventh seal reveals he said when he is cleansing the land with tribulation that's the tribulation period this Sixth Seal brother brandham goes into if you've listened to the six seal you know he goes into a talk about the American Indian how many have heard it he talks about gono right he talks about jono he talks about the American Indian he talks about how uh that when the American Indian on the land that there was it was peaceful there wasn't anything going on just a he he had a Cherokee out here hunting Buffalo and and there was no sin in the land but all of a sudden all of a sudden the man came in the white man our ancestors came in many of our ancestors anyway they come in and they start polluting things they start building civilization right now why is brother BR doing this not because he's an environmentalist he's telling us something God's going to redeem the Earth you realize the Earth is an attribute of God it's an it's a spoken word of God it's a thought of God's not going to do away with it completely renovates it he's he's going to amen it it's got to be redeemed and so he's done that with water blood and spirit the same way he does the believer brother BR says that in future home brother BR talks about the American Indian in gono how he was a red-blooded American he called him and he talked about how the Earth was in birth pains and you'll find whenever and talking about the second coming of Christ whenever Jesus talks about that he uses the illustration or the illusion of he talks about woman bringing forth talks about travail whenever he talks about the end times he talks about travail talks about a woman uh in travail and brother Brown talks about the Earth being in travail and then he said we're in travail Christ to bring forth the bride he said that's why we're in travail yes oh you ever wonder why you have trouble sometimes you you struggle seems like everything's a struggle what are you doing it's just like Jacob he's struggling until he gets a hold of something real and you're struggling because there's something more real than this there's a world more real than this oh I wish I could show it to you today I wish you could see by the eyes of Faith there's a world more real than this one it's bigger than our little problems it's bigger than our situation it's bigger than our bills it's bigger than what we're going through through the week There's a world Beyond this one that we're going to just in another dimension brand said it's not three feet from where you are now oh my one day that world and this world will come together sir amen he said we're in travail to bring for we're not happy here something about it sister Jackie we're ready to go home there's something we've got loved ones over there we we've got we've got there's something inside of us as much as we love our our the people here we want to go home we want to be that's that's those birth pains that's there everything is travailing and groaning he said see there's something fixing to happen he said brother the earthquake bursts open and the Stars shap volcanics will come forth the Earth will renew itself new lava will break from the center of the earth she'll crumble all around and around and around he said when she spins out yonder he said I tell you one morning when Jesus and his bride come back to the Earth there will be a paradise of God there he said oh my them old Warriors of the battle walk down through there with their friends and loved ones amen this is the reason for the sick seal so the Earth can be renovated so we can live on it yes sir amen so we can so we can make it our home again but it won't be like this one there'll be nothing evil there there the lion will lay down with the lamb there there'll be nothing there'll be nothing that hurt or destroy he said an all my Holy Mountain listen he said and there will be a paradise of God there oh my them more Warriors of the battle walk down with their friends and loved ones the anthems will fill the air of an Angelic host oh is well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you like you should have had back there before Eve started the ball rolling in sin he said the sick seal is going to do something yes sir truly the whole world is groaning and painting for the Millennium age yes he talked about the world falling apart he talked about materials being pulled out of the Earth right they pulled all the metal out and all the coal out and all the oil out and you know what I like living the way we do I like our standard of living but there's a cost there's a price and the Earth isn't isn't happy now how many of you have heard of something called fracking that's that's the thing where they take the they take the water if I understand it correctly and they shove it in under the Earth and then it they get more oil that way they can get the oil they couldn't get to otherwise they're forcing it with water Force breaks in the Earth with water and suddenly uh here a few years ago I was sitting in pigot Arkansas laying back preach my battery out I was laying back in pigot Arkansas and I'm laying back in my chair and and you know how you kind of in the chair you're kind of suspended Between Heaven and Earth you know it's early morning time and I I just really enjoy that my wife wasn't up yet and my kids weren't up yet so there was nothing to do you know and so I'm just laying there like that and my chair starts going like this who and uh I it's like I was on the ocean I'm swiming I thought something was wrong with me and I went and checked Facebook because that's what you do when you want to know something's wrong you know you check Facebook some people be checking Facebook for the Rapture you know see who's on there who has a little green light next to him say Well I know it was marked safe so I was sitting there and I started going like this you know I checked Facebook and it said there had been a there had been a uh six something earthquake in Oklahoma and had come all the way across there Oklahoma never had earthquakes before and brother brandom talks about that in the Sixth Seal he said said they're taking the materials out of the earth he said there's places never had earthquakes before have earthquakes and now they didn't even know that until just a few years ago and they realize that when they do that process in the earth I'm not making a political statement I'm just saying when they do that it causes earthquakes right well the brand said he talking about the world he said his politics are so polluted there's hardly an honest among them see it system its morals is so low it just don't have any he said this religion is cankered it's time for the sick seal pretty soon to be opening up and when she does he said oh my it ends remember the bride has been married Israel's Remnant is sealed right and then nature lets go at the word of the two prophets Revelation 6:15 I want you to look at this now as we've made good time tonight and again I'm just trying to trying to cover this the the very basics of it so you can see it and make you maybe want to go back and study it Revelation 615 and the kings of the Earth the Great Men the rich men the chief captains Mighty Men every Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne from the Wrath of the lamb from the face of him what does that mean I never realized that brother the Joel it means he was he came back in his body form they saw him right he was the word and now he become incarnate Christ com back on the Mount of Olives in a body right and they'll see him yeah and they said hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne from the Wrath of the Lamb he said those who had laughed at the preaching of the word think about it Church of the Vindicated word of the Living God when them prophets had stood there and performed miracles remember this is only three and a half years after the bride is gone there'll be people living who attended message churches who started websites I say God have mercy today while there's Mercy while there's Mercy let's ask for it let's take advantage of it said see they cried for the rocks and the mountains to hide them see to hide them from the word that they had laughed at the word's going to be right there in front of them it's one thing to laugh at in this form but when he comes in body form they'll have a difficult time laughing yeah look what they do Oh my he said the word of the Vindicated word of the Living God with them prophets that stood there and perform Miracles close the sun everything else he said and all down through the age he said see they cried for the rocks and the mountains to hide them see to hide them from the word that they had laughed at cuz they seen him come hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb he is the word see they had laughed at the word and here the word was incarnate they had made fun of it laughed at them made fun of them why didn't they repent they couldn't remember the word came back with his Vindication us we are his Vindication and he come back with his Vindication a resurrected Church a resurrected bride he comes back riding on a white horse with his Vindication he said and then they laugh or they quit laughing they begin to cry out but they did not repent yes they couldn't repent that's right Mercy's over oh my so how do you know Mercy's still still going because you can repent as long as you can repent Now's the Time to do thaten Oh my he said they couldn't uh Church don't don't ever turn him down if there's just a a pole of conviction in your heart we're living in an age when there's no conviction anywhere right but you you can preach you can preach about the things of God people just people just don't move and that's not us I'm not rebuking you in any way that's the world that's everybody it's just there's no conviction I say if you feel a pull of God in your heart you better run and that's what brother BR says at the end of The Sixth Seal he said if you feel the tug of God in your heart you better run to the altar he said you shouldn't have to pull on people to come he said they should run they see the time that they're living in why didn't they repent they couldn't was too far then so they knew that the punishment they hear it theyve set in meetings like this and knew about it and they knew that the things that those prophets had predicted was looking them right in the face the thing that they had rejected they' spurned Mercy for the last time they tried to repent but the lamb had come to claim his own see and they cried to the rocks and the mountains prayed but the prayer was too late Israel blinded 2,000 years to give us a space to repent I say we ought to use it we ought to use it church we we should be down on our knees thanking God to be the bride right well who else who's going to escape from the from the transgender Revolution yeah who's going to escape from from the liberal theologies of today who's going to escape from the from the uh from the Roman Catholic Church who's going to escape from the world order that's coming only one people the bride that's it it's the only one that's going to stand the Republicans aren't going to stand the Democrats aren't going to stand the people aren't going to stand the cities aren't going to stand but the brid will stand because we're going home he gave us a space to repent brother Brandon said so if God did that for you you believe he did it for you tonight could you raise your hands he did that for me he did that for me he blinded his own children for 2,000 years for me he said the least thing we could do would be accept what he's done that's all he asked us to do that's all he didn't ask you to jump through a bunch of Hoops he didn't ask you to go through a 12ep program become a better person he said just accept What I've Done yes we bow our heads together musicians come if you've never given your heart to him why say brother man why do you do that we're all Christians I'm prone to making altar calls I realize that I'm prone to giving people a chance at the end of every sermon there's a reason for that because I preach to people who never made another service I know every preacher has but I've had a couple of instances in my my life that I preach to people and had people in my home and counsel with them and talk to them those people ended up either changing the lives of other people in such a way that they ended up in prison for the rest of their life I can think of two distinct cases like that one case where someone that I had prayed for talked to and preached the last sermon that they ever heard died by the hand of their own husband I don't say that that'll be you there's no fear in that I'm not trying to make you afraid I'm just giving you an opportunity a chance if you've never given your heart to him why don't you why don't you do that it's not that hard if you haven't rep if you're a Christian but there's something in your heart that maybe something that you you know it's wrong but you just do it anyway and you tell well Lord will let me buy with it just just repent he's done so much for you he don't even see it but just just repent you don't want it that that in your your life you don't want nothing between you and God something you know it's right to do just just do the right thing he did so much for us the least we could do is just accept what he's done for us Heavenly Father oh Lord Jesus how we need you today Lord I I want to fully accept and embrace what you've done for us in this hour Lord I accept you as My Savior My Healer my God my leader my Lord I accept you Lord in the message that you brought in this hour I realize the message was more than a man we don't pray to a man we don't set tapes up and call that the token that's not our token but our token is you lord it's the very literal Life of Christ coming back on the believer but we accept that today Lord we accept the message that that you brought we accept the word that you've taught us we accept your love and your kindness and your mercy that's been extended Lord even beyond the age that the prophet could see it he couldn't even see it was so dark past 1977 he couldn't even see in an hour of Darkness the Bible said an hour of gross Darkness but he spoke to the bride he said arise shine thy light has come oh God I pray you'd help us to embrace that light today to walk towards it to be that light I pray you to help us today oh how we need you Lord I trust that every heart is clear Lord we're right where we're supposed to be Lord then we should praise you and worship you and adore you for
