Abraham this morning Genesis chapter 18: 9 through 15 there's going to be a uh a coat and blanket drive for uh the victims in North Carolina Tennessee brother Donnie Reagan's church is is doing that and so they're they just let me know about that so we're going to participate in that uh from this area so if you've got something I'm going to put more details on the WhatsApp group so you'll be able to know what what all they can take and what they can't but we will have a a chance to give uh I know you don't always have money but if you have something laid around the house that's nice that you'd want to give to somebody uh because uh Winter's coming on especially they're in the mountains and they're very uh they they need some things like that so well coordinate with them but uh we we'll try to do that by next week next Sunday morning Genesis 18 and verse 9 remember communion tonight as well and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assurity bear a child which I'm old and verse 14 I want us to pay attention to today is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated Abraham's faith is legendary he believed when all he had was a voice telling him to leave his Kindred and go into a strange country and the Bible puts us puts it this way in Hebrews 11:8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God and we've discussed that to do that it takes big faith it takes brwy faith it it takes Faith with muscles brother brandom puts it this way he said shame on you Christians that call yourself Christians and go around with a weary well I don't know if I go to church he said oh you're a poor excuse he said let me tell you lift up your heads straighten up your chest he said oh my use Faith he said faith is the boss that's right faith has hairs on its chest brother I mean it's got big muscles when it speaks all the worries drop from one side to the other When Faith speaks the devil says now you just can't make it you can't do this you're ashamed to testify but Faith raises up and says shut up I got the floor amen sure Faith takes the initiative that was Abraham Abraham believed God and he and he and he walked in that direction that God showed him he obeyed God Sarah also had to have faith the Bible says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised have you judged him faithful today have you judged him faithful because she judged him faith faithful she had Faith now though she laughed initially in the end she judged him faithful her body was changed and she had the child now brother bandam taught us and I'm trying to kind of hurry and lay lay a background to get where I want to go this morning but brother bam taught us that the reason Sarah laughed is because she didn't understand that the hungry stranger with dust on his clothes was God in flesh because she did not have that Revelation that Abra abam had of who that was that was speaking to them that's the reason she laughed that's the reason she tried to deny laughing because she didn't understand that that was God in flesh and it's important today we understand what happened in our day because if you don't understand the revealing of the son of man you won't have the faith to believe what that son of man spoke and what he said because it was the revealing of the son of man that opened up the Mysteries opened up the seals to us showed us where we're at in this age and so if you're looking for something else to come or or something else you what is it you you don't really understand who came in our day you don't really understand there was Christ standing there that revealed the Myst wasn't wasn't brother Brandon but it was Christ that did that so was Christ borrowing a body amen just like he wants to borrow your body today he wants to borrow my body he wants us to be his body on the Earth right so brother bandam taught us that she laughed because she didn't understand and when then she laughed she should have died right there oh my she should have been killed right there it should have that was Elohim sitting there right in a body that he just blew into dust and created and he was sitting there and she laughed at him but and she should have died but she didn't die brother Brandon said let me give you a little Grace here Brethren that minute God would have killed Sarah for disbelieving that Angel he didn't right look at that angel went down and told Lot's wife not to look back see what happened to her remember Lot's wife what happened to Lost wife the minute she looked back she was turned into a pillar of salt but there was a measure of Grace for Sarah that wasn't there for Lot's wife because Lot's wife was married to lot right that's why she was called Lot's wife because she was married to lot that's a revelation isn't it some of y'all never realize that she's called Lot's wife we don't know her name she just lost wife she was married to lot but let me tell you this morning I'm not married to lot I'm not married to a denomination I'm not married to the world I'm not my old husband is dead and I'm married to Christ the word we are Mrs Jesus Christ so when we laughed when we disbelieved when we did things we shouldn't come on church you've not been perfect since you got the Holy Ghost you've not been perfect since you come to church you've not been perfect since you heard the message but why were you not done away with why did he have mercy on you because you belong to Abraham you belong to Jesus Christ and that's why he couldn't kill you he couldn't take you out yes sir glory to God we just sto there and preach for a while God could have killed her but he didn't do it Oh my he said he couldn't take Sarah because she was part of Abraham and today the unbelief of the real true church she has unbelief but he can't touch her we're in Jesus he said you can't take the church without hurting Christ he couldn't take Sarah without hurting Abraham so Grace covered him well I'm so glad for his grace today but he did call her out on it amen said why did Sarah laugh why did Sarah laugh now again Sarah laughed because she didn't understand and she didn't understand because Satan had done everything he could to prevent her from receiving that visitation just like he does everything he can to prevent you from receiving a visitation now Satan was trying to block Abraham and Sarah brother Brandon said because he knew that there was an Angelic visitation coming Oh my he said then when everything Rises all out of order and we know something is wrong in other words we know something's up God's doing something or the devil's trying to trying to mess things up and you wonder what's going on look what's look what's happening he said now I believe maybe if we would listen to Satan we might miss seeing it like Sarah did right so when things begin to get stirred up and things begin to get people begin to get fussy and people begin to get uh begin to be at odds with one another we can look at that one or two ways we can say Well it must be that the devil's just had his way and and he's just but why is he so mad why is he so upset well it's because God is about to do something he's about to he's about to visit them oh my he's about to reveal to them the secrets of their hearts now look so Sarah got fussy because Satan was trying to stir her up before the visitation of the Angel that's right so brother brandom said let's think that Sarah being that she done what she did let's think that she was kind of a little fussy that morning that she might have said Abraham you know the supplies are getting low here and the herdsman say the pasture is all dried up in the water holes I think you made the wrong decision when you chose to come up here and let lot and Mrs lot and their family live down there with plenty that's easy to look at lot making the wrong decision in hindsight right but but right then Sarah looked at it it looked like lot's decision was pretty good yeah because Mrs lot got to do pretty much whatever she wanted to do right he said when why the other day sometime ago when I went to the city why Mrs lot had on one of the the prettiest dresses I ever seen it was oh church we get in trouble when we got get to looking around don't we what other people have and we we get to coveting what other people have he said I he said it was styled by the Egyptians why a camel Caravan come through and she got the new Styles there's no such thing as them Caravans and styles coming throughout here oh but brother BR said there was more than a caravan coming it was an Angelic visitation but he said I might have heard her say something like this you ought have seen the new hairdo she had you know a woman 60 years old trying to look 20 well praise the Lord and poor old Abraham I love this you remember Abraham was sitting in the tent door do you ever think about why he was sitting in the tent door he didn't want to be in the house poor old Abraham faithful old brother he said that didn't Shake him one bit he just walks over and gets his chair sits down in the door of the tent oh my when everybody's fussing everything's going on remember it's just the devil trying to get you upset where you can't receive nothing from the service it's just the devil trying to prevent a breakthrough I say it's time we get our chair and sit in the door of the tent and wait for God to do something yes sir hallelujah amen again brother BR said here he is now and Sarah he said let's just break in on her for a minute there she sit back there say I wonder how many Fanatics my husband can entertain a she saw the dust on the clothes she saw the that they were Travelers she said there just another fanatic claiming to have a word from God but this was God himself yes sir oh church he said well I see the Angel takes his chair maybe and leans back his back towards the tent and Sarah listening through the tent you know kind of eavesdropping and she was kind of in an awful mood that morning he said you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood he said you just no need to trying it you might as well stay at home yeah right right just change your attitude you can come to church he said when you come to church come prayed up come in the atmosphere come expecting amen Abraham knew at the time of the promise was coming close it had to be he was hundred years old he was expecting at any time he watched every minute when he run in and told Sarah this I believe is our day of visitation and she kind of looked at him with them big eyes and thought well Abraham You' said that a long time but you know there will come a time when it'll be so if God said so oh she had Faith but it was just her mood that she was in and I think a lot of us have more faith than we know that we have but it's just the mood that we're in sometimes and you got to break out of that mood or you're never going to receive a visitation from the angel you said well I'm just not getting nothing out of church anymore why don't you break out of that mood and let God begin to speak to you again let God begin to wash over you again let the word begin to have an impact in your life again she was kind of in a halfway upset mood he said from her condition that morning she thought in her heart isn't that a silly thing think in our day me an old woman as old as I am here I am 90 years old there since my husband Abraham 100 years old not been with me as a woman for 50 years Abraham well we've been married since we were about 177 him about 27 said how could that be how could it be he said see she had herself all out of condition to receive it when God brought him he said oh my don't never get that in your heart be open be open how can you receive from God if you're not open it Lord be ready said she missed it she failed to see it here she was in that shape saying now how could that happen in our modern time how could it happen to me in my condition but it happened just the same Abraham out there waiting with anticipation you see he said it wasn't made known to her it was made known to them that was looking for it yeah so look at the difference here she is in the tent all in a bad mood and she laughed but Abraham was in the door of the tent and he was waiting with expectation for God to do something he said Abraham waiting out there with expectation he said that's the way it comes yet to those who are looking so he was watching Abraham was he said yes my Lord yes that's right the promise was I believed it all along he said now Abraham just about the time of life it'll be each month when I'm going to visit you and you're going to have that baby and Sarah you know to herself went hump laughed kind of to herself he said now watch Abraham gets the sign now Sarah was too flustrated watch Abraham gets it immediately yeah so let me wash your feet Let Me Entertain You and Sarah s back there in the tent said not me come on Church how many times we sit in church like that if we just really honest that's true right we sit back there and and we see somebody just really get blessed the preacher is under the anointing and the people are being blessed and we're sitting there going well you know that's kind of In the Flesh I used to do that too back when I was new you know well maybe you need to bring back the new again come maybe you need to go back and get another dip of the out of the fountain get another drink out of the fountain oh my now watch she sat there criticizing brother BR said sometimes we're too frustrated about the fellow the other fellow that's got the biggest denomination or his congregation dresses better than mine they've got a bigger Church Down on the Corner than we got he said what difference does that make I want God I don't care if I have to worship him on the street corner and come here with me this morning I want God he I I let me have in my heart and condition if I wear overall so I can watch God and see his move and recognize him not pass it by he said Abraham where is your wife Sarah stranger never seen him before where is your wife Sarah how did he know that he had a wife how did he know her name was Sarah said she's in the tent behind you and when Sarah laughed he said why did she laugh he caught the sign he knew what it was Sarah didn't get it she even come forth and tried to deny it he said God would have destroyed her upon that if she hadn't been a part of Abraham a lot of times our unbelief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us we are a part of Christ just as Sarah was part of Abraham for we are the bride of Christ amen and we people who's born of the spirit of God ought to wake up right get out of our stews church and watch for the supernatural sign of the coming of the Lord Jesus his signs that he promised now now that's the background for what we want to say this morning yeah now he said to Abraham he said is anything too hard for the Lord is anything too hard for the Lord the word hard actually means wondrous wonderful Miracle is there anything too wonderful for God it's something that is inexplicit aable and Indescribable according to human standards brother Brandon would call it a paradox something that's true yet you you can't even imagine it being true it just is yeah right so is anything too wonderful for God now if you go into the scriptures as I begin to study on this word begin to look at what it was and what it what it meant it's speaking of God being Elohim the Lord LD the Lord being Elohim being the creator of the universe we'll get more into that in a moment and and we've got to trust him and Abraham trusted him for who he was he trusted him because of who he was and so what faith in God is it means that when everybody else is selling out if if you would say that God was a corporation we could put it like that and everybody else is selling stock in God right Abraham is buying Abraham is actually he's actually investing in God when everyone else is selling everything off in a panic are you with me now when Sarah and and and everybody else that that hears it they're saying oh that can't be true there's nothing but but Abraham and those who are the Seed of Abraham I believe today when things begin to look like it can't be possible we reinvest in Elohim yes right because he's the only one who's going to make it through now and and the only way that we can make it through now now when if you go back to Jeremiah I want you to go to Jeremiah chapter 32 there was a time when the Babylonians were getting ready to carry the people of Jerusalem captive and I can imagine at that time now I want you to think carnally for just a moment because I want you to think about the real estate and during that time the real estate market in Jerusalem would have been really bad yeah like worse than Cherokee Village right we all went through the time when everybody's buying Cherokee Village and now the real estate signs start to you know during covid now all the signs come up and and and the Market's up and down right so so Jerusalem the market was down when I'm talking down I mean really down because your faith in what you're buying if you buy if you buy land say if you buy real estate if you buy stock in a company you're putting trust in that company or that real estate or or or that government to be able to back up your claims I found out when I went to Africa that the people don't really own anything because it's kind of first come first sered because people just squat on the land if you're able to build a house on it the government will honor your claim because you're able to do what most people aren't so if you can get a piece of property and build a house on it or build walls around it then you own it and that's not the way we are here why because we trust that the law is going to back us up right if we have a deed to property so during that time when the Babylonians were coming in it looked like that Judah was about to be destroyed Israel had already been taken captive Judah is about to be taken captive and it looked like there was no hope for the real estate market to ever come back and you say brother Ben what in the world are you talking about well I'm about to read something to you we find during that time that God spoke to a prophet named Jeremiah and he said I want you to buy a piece of land in a down Market I want I want you to think about this now I want you to buy a piece of land in an extreme fear market and Jeremiah's nephew happened to be selling some family property of course they had to offer it to someone in the family first the Lord told Jeremiah he said buy it pay full price for it right don't don't pay him a reduce pay full price for it and bury take take a deed sign the deed and bury a sealed copy of the deed on the land oh my so Jeremiah 32:14 thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences that would be a deed the evidence of the purchase which is sealed and this evidence which is open so they would seal one and another one that everyone could read put them in an earth and vessel that they may continue many days for thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land now watch what kind of Faith you would have to have what kind of obedience you'd have to have because money was scarce right it's hard to come by who buys when a foreign army is at the gates and people are starving in the city right and the government's about to be overthrown and from that time they never had another stable Jewish government until 1948 so for literally thousands of years there was not a stable Jewish government in that land after the Babylonians came right they were always a vassel state or or under the Persians under the Romans under somebody else but there was no no guarantee that that deed would ever be honored but God told Abraham or God told Jeremiah rather he said go and buy land and Jeremiah's like today Lord people are going to think I'm weird people going to think it's strange why are you buying land when everybody else is selling oh my because when everybody else gave up on the land God never did listen to me church and I just think spiritually when everybody else gave up on you God never did so when you were in your lowest condition when you were in your worst spot of life when you were going through the darkest moment of your life you were really going through it that's when God said I want to invest in them I going to build on them I want to preach the word to them I want to I want to help them I want to heal them thank you Lord he didn't cast you away when you were in your darkest moments you remember before you got saved you remember what some of the things you did you don't even want to think about them now but in your darkest moment he already knew you you were already his child he was already thinking about you he was already reaching out for you and in your darkest moment God didn't give up when everything was contrary now go back to Abraham what did Abraham do Abraham made an investment in the promises an investment in the promises when everybody else gives up I'm going to say yes Lord I believe when it's impossible I'm going to say Lord I believe that you now listen there were hundred hundreds of tribes there have been many kingdoms much much greater than than Israel in the world Israel is a very small nation a really a relatively small group of people compared to the ones in China or in India or even the civilizations here in the US there were much greater tribes here in the US if you go over to uh to Illinois or over by St Louis you can find where the mound builders were there and had huge cities uh maybe a thousand years ago or something like that and so the the uh uh the people there there have been many groups of people who' just passed off the face of the Earth right just left the history books go try to find an amalaki right or a Philistine right or or any of them guys right any of the people that were in the land before Israel was that were that were greater excuse me that were greater than Israel was that had more money than Israel did that had more land than Israel did that had better land than Israel did who still exists today think about it very few if any have continued till today and yet the Jews have been persecuted like no other people they were driven from their land they were they were slaughtered listen the Hool caust wasn't the first time it happened it happened in under the Romans it happened it happened all down through history it happened under the Spanish it happened it happened under different empires in different places at different times they were run from one country to another under the Russians they were they were driven from place to place to place to place and it seemed like they would never be able to be a people again but God has told Jeremiah buy land buy some property in the land because one day it's going to be a land again it's going to be a place again where there's laws it's going to be a place again where there's people sir I hope you hear me this morning houses this is the word of the Lord houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed again they won't be owned by a foreign Nation they'll be owned by Israelites yes Jewish people are you with me now and Satan's still trying to knock them off that land but in 1947 or 8 whenever they become a nation the Star of David was raised it took thousands of years but God kept his word right Hallelujah now listen what Jeremiah says when he buys this land he said now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baric the son of Niah I prayed unto the Lord saying oh Lord God behold thou has made the Heaven and the earth now watch what he's doing he's properly orienting himself toward God this is important church I don't want to take too long but it's important yeah you don't want to get to where you look at God like a man all right or you look at God like even a preacher yeah or even a prophet yeah that's not who God is right God is the god of the prophets right Elohim created the dust on the prophet's clothes right Elohim created all the things that that exist today he was before there was anything he was the self-existing one and so and so here Jeremiah calls out during this time of extreme fear during this time he said I'm going to obey your word because of who you are because I believe I wonder if there's anybody like that this morning no matter what's going on in your life it still don't keep you from Amen in the word it don't keep you from praising God it don't keep you from worshiping in the house of the Lord why because you know within yourself I I am I I realize who God is and he's not going to be thrown off by some bad decision somebody makes he's not going to be thrown off because my pastor's not perfect he's not going to be thrown off because the deacons aren't perfect he's not going to be thrown off because somebody else not perfect God is God he created all the he existed before this church he'll exist after this church are you with me now this building will pass away one day even this these words on the page of this printed book will pass away one of these days but he said my word will never pass away why it's an attribute of who he is all right TR so when you go through things you need to properly Orient yourself towards God right and it gives you a confidence right and you don't have to give up so you don't give yourself exits right you say I'm GNA make it yes it's not I'm gonna make it if the church does okay or I'm gonna make it if the if the pastor does this or I'm going to make it if things are going good in the message that's not what we go by right but we say oh Lord God yes behold thou has made the Heaven and the Earth by thy great power and stretch out arm and there is nothing too wonderful all right sir are you with me that's the same Hebrew word nothing too wonderful so he asked the question the angel asked the question all the way back to Abraham he said is there anything too hard for God and Jeremiah answers during a time of extreme difficulty when it seemed like there was no right answered to give and he said there is nothing too hard for thee do you realize what time that that Jeremiah Was do I don't want to get too deep into this today but the time he was doing that in was the time oh my when the seals were open amen when the land was claimed amen that's the time we're living in today he said there's going to be a time of claiming there's going to be a time of possessing that's the hour we live in today that's good Hallelujah there's nothing too hard for thee can we believe that today he said thou show us loving kindness under thousands recompenses the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the Mighty God the Lord of hosts is his name yeah great in counsel Mighty in work for Thine Eyes Are Open upon all the ways of the sons of men listen we didn't sing Open Your Eyes Lord we we said open our eyes Lord his eyes are open he sees he said which has set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even unto this day and in Israel and among other men and has made thee a name as at this day and has brought forth thy People Israel out of the land of Egypt with son what's he doing he's encouraging himself in the Lord he's crying out to God and saying God I know you're God it may look dark around me I may be dodging Babylonian arrows I might they might be taking over over but I know God and who you are and so I'm investing right now I'm investing in the house of God this is the time I'm going to go to church I'm not going to quit church because things are tough I'm going to go to the house of God I'm going to believe godall thank you Lord Lord thank you Lord oh my you love him this morning amen he said you brought forth your people with a strong hand with a stretched out arm has given them this land look it's given them this land oh my which thou did swear to their fathers to give him oh my a land flowing with milk and honey and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they've done nothing of all that thou commandest them to do I love this Jeremiah is honest about it they were in the situation they were in for a reason he said they messed up therefore thou has caused all this evil to come upon them behold the mounts there coming the city to take it and the city's given the hand of the calans that fight against it so he sitting there watching he's looking at the the mounts that would be the instruments of warfare the great machines that they moved up to the edge of the city to walk to to go over the wall of the city the ladders that they pulled up and the things that they built this Machines of Siege Warfare that they had built to bring close to the wall so they could shoot down into the city he said behold the mounts and and behold the the calans that fight against it because the Sword and the Famine of the pestilence and what thou has spoken has come to pass and behold thou seest it and thou has said unto me oh Lord God buy Thee the field for money yeah you probably could have got it for free yeah he said buy it for money and take Witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the calans then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah said behold oh listen to what he answers back behold I am the Lord the God of All Flesh is there anything too hard for me what do you do in your darkest moments just want to talk to you for a minute because we all go through it you can give up if you give up you fulfill the devil's prophecy or do you invest right invest amen do you invest or distance yourself do you buy or do you sell I I read a profile one time with Warren Buffett and listened to him speak and he was the man who they called The Oracle of Omaha he's famous just for making money nothing else but he just made a lot of money at one time he was the richest man in the world and the reason that he did he this it was very simple he would not he refused to judge a company by the current climate but he judged it by its fundamentals and he asked himself if the stock market doesn't exist for the next 10 years would this company still be worth buying would it still exist would it still Thrive is the product good right so I want to ask you this morning is the product good oh Church well the are God's blessings real as as he really healed you as he really saved you it's a product that tells you that the that the company is good it tells you that that that God is good that him is good right so he he famously invested billions in cocacola he said oh you can't make any money in Coca-Cola because it looked like during there was a time there you remember New Coke man I'm I'm old aren't I they put out a different flavor of coke and nobody liked it and and they they did a bunch of other stupid stuff but Warren Buffett looked at that and he said when everybody else is selling I'm going to buy more and he made billions of dollars off of for Coca-Cola why he has faith in the company now Coca-Cola could go broke tomorrow won't be my fault I do my part but they could go broke tomorrow but God will always keep his word we serve a God that's bigger than coca colola he's bigger than these big Corporation he's bigger than the Babylonians he's bigger than the Russians he's bigger than the Iranians he's bigger come on don't lose your faith now don't lose your hope now now's not the time to give up Now's the Time to invest yes sir your kids start to act up and go crazy that's not the time to give up on them how the time to invest your time invest your invest your your your presence in in their lives invest your your ability to be there with them and to pray for them if that's all you can do is pray then pray like never before now's not the time to give up because you believe God gave me those children Elohim gave me those children they belong to me that's right marriage on the Rocks I'm just preaching this morning you forgive me but something going on in your marriage and you can't seem like things are tough it's not the time to start looking around looking for somebody else come on church God gave you your wife God gave you your husband Now's the Time to invest in your marriage that's right now's the time to take her out to dinner that's right I'm going to get myself in trouble here Now's the Time to invest you said well brother Ben that's because you've always had a perfect marriage nonsense if just my wife had been married it would have been fine but I was married too you know right all right I had all my complexes and all my troubles and all my struggles are with but somebody wrote me something that that really struck me because they said brother Ben I want to hear your testimony I thought well maybe some of it but no I thought about that and I thought you know I don't like talking about myself but but we you know we've had our share of problems just like everybody else and and you're going to wake up mad sometimes and preachers do that more often than most people I think because just because of the nature of you just spend yourself you ever get a really hard day of work and then you get you get hit with problems when you get home some of you men know what I'm talking about some of you ladies know what I'm talking about you had a really bad day and you just get hit with everything when you get home and that's a bad time amen right and that's Mondays right for preachers you just get hit with that you think you're not going to snap at your wife or there's gonna be right come on commitment isn't perfection it's not agreeing on everything we still can't agree on when to leave been married almost 20 years and I still can't we still can't get together on when to leave the house but God gave me my wife are you with me church and I believe God gave her her husband and so we believe in God we trust God it's not that we trust that person that we do but we trust God more than we do a person more than we do a church more than we do anything else I know it would be hard bringing my children here and at the time there's only young people at their age in the church and it was difficult but we trust God right and God built and caused that situation to change I thank God for that but we trust God and I trust God for them today as they start driving and a little older I have to trust God we believe in God around here we say oh Lord God thou who's made the heavens and the Earth you're able to keep my kids safe you're able you're able to to take care of them it's hard when they start to leave the house they get a little bit older and and they and they begin to question everything you do that becomes a difficult time of life but God gave me those children are you with me now Abraham trusted God because of that he submitted himself to the promise listen Church you might be in an impossible situation right now but God Specializes in those you say how do you know he specialized well it's in his title it's part of his name did you know that unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government should be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful I can do hard things that's literally his name wonderful I do things beyond your comprehension wonderful I do things you couldn't dream of doing it wonderful I bring things to pass that you couldn't even bring to pass yourself you couldn't even have a part in it but I do it anyway he said I'm wonderful oh hallelujah hallelujah his name is wonderful how could anything be too wonderful for him he is wonderful Jesus is called wonderful because his very existence is beyond our capability of knowing Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that's God With Us what was that wonderful we could there's no way that his a very birth we couldn't even describe how it takes place and we need to remember who he is and and I've talked about job as we've talked about Abraham but job had great faith and great patience when when all job could see was problems God didn't show him a way out he just showed him who he was go back to job you need to read the book of job again Job chapter 38 and verse one the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge GT up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me he said no I'm going to job you've talked long enough that's right let me talk for a minute that's right oh maybe we need to let the Lord speak for a minute into our situation he said g up now th Lo's like a man he said where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who has laid the measures thereof if thou knowest in other words wh which Carpenter was it that that measured it because even really good Builders and Carpenters get uh the wrong distance on the tape measure sometime call out the number wrong but the heavens and the Earth were framed by the word of God and there's not one mistake if we were just just a little closer to the Sun we'd all burn up if we were just a little bit further from the Sun we'd all freeze to death but we're right in habitable zone and it's the only planet they found that can sustain life why because God made the heavens and the Earth God made the Earth God laid the foundations he said who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fasting who laid the Cornerstone thereof amen when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy oh it's a great it's a great Revelation there where were you job you were there there but you don't remember you were there but you can't you can't remember it but I'll tell you this job if you were there you're going to be there again if you were in my mind you're going to be in my city notice the question is anything too hard for the Lord for Elohim do you remember who I am Abraham Abraham let me remind you so all I want to do this morning just remind you brother brand called him elw Elohim we could go read many things brother BR said about him he talked about him how that he how that he caused the Stars to go into space and he and he held the earth and its ball of ice in his hand and and let it go and and how the the spirit the Holy Spirit brooded over the face of the deep all those things that he told us and what was it it was Elohim he was teaching us what is the message tell us the message tells us that God was not only a great God but he was still God that's the revealing of the son of man in simple layman's term God is a great God and he's a good God but he's also a god of today he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a god of your situation not just of of Abraham's situation or Isaac's situation not just of the situations of the Bible he's a god of your situation this morning and you say brother Ben well why don't you preach on this side or the other but I I found if I can get you to believe in who God is if we can get you to have faith and believe nothing is impossible for God and what happens things begin to clear up in your life you begin to follow the word you begin to obey the word why because you believe God is able to keep it God is able Paul said I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm certain that he's able to keep me I know that he's able I'm persuaded fully persuaded he's able to keep what I've committed against that day he's able to keep me he's able to he's able to help me amen look what he says in Psalms 981 is very similar to Jeremiah he said oh sing unto the Lord a new song right now come on church it's going to get real light here at the end just just just hang with me for a minute sing unto the Lord a new song not some not some song you've always sing he say well we can only sing these 13 songs sing a new song right for Heath done Mar marvelous things wonderful things hard things glory to God how many believe that this morning his right hand and His holy arm ha gotten him the victory the Lord hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the Heathen Heath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel all the ends of the Earth have seen the salvation of our God this what he says verse four Make a Joyful Noise amen Hallelujah I know I realize you can make noise and not be saved but the saved are going to make noise at least some of them right there's going to be some noise because wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a oh no brother Ben is too loud well you know I think that's what that says right make a l o u d loud noise so he said make a happy noise Make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise Hallelujah well we'll do that but you know we need to do it when there's no instruments verse five sing unto the Lord with the harp with the with the voice of a song with trumpets you know what trumpets are loud and the sound of cornette Make a Joyful Noise before the Lord the king Let the Sea Roar and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein let the floods clap their hands listen if the flood claps its hand I can clap my hands said let the hills be joyful together before the Lord for he cometh to judge the Earth listen with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with Equity listen to me and I'm going to close in just a moment I'm not going to keep you long cuz we got communion tonight but Mary was told she would have a baby and this time it wasn't like with Sarah they she was told said there won't be any human involvement at all right no human involvement at all you talk about something wonderful you talk about something hard to believe she said how will these things be he said with God nothing is impossible with God nothing is impossible she said be it unto me according to Thy word let us have that attitude this morning if you'll have that kind of attitude it'll change your life it'll change your situation take the word of God for your hour whatever word it is that you have to live and say Lord I can't do it on my own but be it unto me according to Thy word let me be a Sarah let me be a Rahab let me be a Ruth let me be an Abraham let me be somebody who survives and makes it let me be somebody come on Church didn't give in to Leo toia let me be somebody who loves with all my heart let me be somebody who tells the truth let me be somebody who's not Bound by my path let me be somebody who loves God with all of my heart Thank You Lord if he could give Sarah a child at 90 we take that for granted because it was her what if it was you if he could give his Israel back their land after more than 2,000 years Jeremiah still had a deed to it you imagine you know he got the graves were emptied I like to think that Jeremiah got up I don't know if you can dig in a theophany body don't don't come at me over that I I don't know I like to think Jeremiah got up and went looking for his deed looking for his deed and maybe he dug it up he looked at that still there still in that Earth and vessel let me bury it again because one day one day Church where there's GNA be a great City there and you and I are going to be in the city a a and those the the the servants and the Jews and those are not they're God's people God's chosen people they're going to be around that city they're going to be right there with us they're going to be right around the city well I like to think that Jeremiah is going to dig up that deed and say here it is here here's the land that God promised if that's possible you understand here's what God promised us this is it this is it he keeps his word he keeps his word after thousands of years and Government after Government after government and war after war after war and extermination oh Church no matter what trial you've been through what battle you've been through remember he still keeps his word if you if you shouted in the mind of God before the foundation of the earth you are still God's child today if he could form himself as a germ in the womb of Mary if he could lay the foundations of the earth musicians go ahead and come he can do all things why don't we just bow our heads together you can take away that condemnation he can take away what's causing that condemnation he can destroy that sin in your life say how do you say that brother Ben because he's God he created the heavens and the Earth see well it's an impossible situation I don't see it as that not because I'm arrogant but because I [Music] see I see God had his hand on my life and I was an impossible situation I shouldn't have come out of what I come out [Music] of but God rich and Mercy with that great love that he loved me with pull me out is anything too hard for the Lord we have to ask ourselves that question as a church what do you believe in about the church are you based it on people God put you here God put the pastor here God put the the people here I don't believe that's necessarily a life sentence if God moves you somewhere God bless you I won't fight you but while you're here invest I don't mean financially I mean in in in what God has has done here at the church he's done great things because he's God invest in that your children invest in your children now it's not the time to say well you know it's a hard age we'll probably lose them nonsense we have a word that can keep our children invest in your children Now's the Time to buy Now's the Time To Worship Now's the Time say well I'm waiting for a breakthrough this this is the time might as well break through now well how do I do that just begin to worship him just begin to praise him you begin to lift your hands to and say Lord I know I'm in a difficult situation but I also know you're still God you created the heavens and the Earth just talk to him like that for a minute if you would and every one of us together we just want to we want to reinvest want to reinvest in God's promises I don't know how to do what I'm doing I think like Moses he said Lord he said I don't know how to go into this land I don't know how to lead this people this great people he said but [Music] Lord he said if your presence goes with us it'll all be okay he said if your presence don't go with us don't send us but if your presence goes with us I believe he's here this morning I believe his presence is with us let's invest in God's promises God I know you are God and you're able to keep what I've committed against that day Heavenly Father are Jesus I pray you wouldd move on every heart help us Lord to to reduce our unbelief Lord if we find oursel in a situation like Sarah and we're fussy oh God take it out of us this morning Lord we want to be expecting we want to be
