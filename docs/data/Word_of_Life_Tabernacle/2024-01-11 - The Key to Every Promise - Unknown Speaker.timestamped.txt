[40:54] once again to meet us here tonight and
[40:56] speak to us through Thy word we pray ask
[40:59] in Jesus name amen
[41:03] amen I want to to turn to Hebrews 116
[41:07] Hebrews 11:6 and Mark
[41:11] 9:23 Hebrews 11:6 and Mark
[41:16] 9:23 we need to keep be praying for uh
[41:19] Gabe and mil they have a a very special
[41:22] unspoken request some things that
[41:24] they're going through and as a church we
[41:26] just need to be praying for them right
[41:28] now gone through a lot lately and and uh
[41:31] sometimes it just seems like one bad
[41:33] thing happens and other bad things come
[41:35] with it but we know that God is in
[41:38] control of all of those things and so
[41:40] we're praying for them uh today tonight
[41:43] and U there's some weather coming in
[41:45] this weekend but we're planning on
[41:47] having church we'll just see what the
[41:49] weather does so we'll wait a little bit
[41:50] closer if you ever wonder whether or not
[41:53] we're having Church all you have to do
[41:54] is is contact me me or one of the
[41:57] deacons and we'd be glad to tell you
[41:59] whether or not we've called off church
[42:00] but we'll try to get a hold of everybody
[42:02] if we have to do that Lord willing we
[42:04] won't have to weon be able to have have
[42:06] service this weekend Hebrews 11:6 but
[42:10] without faith it is impossible to please
[42:13] him for he that cometh to God must
[42:16] believe that he is and that he is a
[42:19] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[42:23] him and then Mark 9:23
[42:27] Jesus said unto him if thou can't
[42:31] believe thou can
[42:34] believe all things someone say all
[42:37] things are possible to him that
[42:41] believeth amen Let's uh you may be
[42:45] seated Lord have his Blessing to the
[42:47] reading of the
[42:48] word there's a great Chasm between faith
[42:52] and
[42:53] doubt brother Peter these uh answer are
[42:56] just a little bit loud there's a great
[42:58] Chasm between faith and doubt and it's
[43:01] so great that he says with faith all
[43:05] things are possible yes if you can
[43:08] believe there's no limit but Paul's good
[43:10] to see it tonight if if you can believe
[43:12] there's no limit to what you can you can
[43:15] have that's right do we really
[43:18] understand that tonight unlimited the
[43:21] the the the power that you you can
[43:24] access the the promis that you can grab
[43:27] a hold of are unlimited if you can
[43:30] believe and on the other side is
[43:33] unbelief or or doubt and if you doubt
[43:37] nothing is possible right because it's
[43:41] impossible to please God without faith
[43:44] so the difference is night and day the
[43:47] difference is life and death you can't
[43:49] do anything without faith and I think
[43:52] that's true just in a general sense in
[43:54] in society in the world that we live in
[43:56] I I I was watching something recently
[43:59] where a man was dropped off uh he was a
[44:01] billionaire and he changed his name and
[44:04] and they give him $100 put $100 in his
[44:06] pocket dropped him off in a strange city
[44:09] and within 90 days he had $5
[44:11] million because there was something
[44:13] about him that he believed he could make
[44:15] money and because he believed he could
[44:18] make money he went out and made money
[44:20] and if that works like that in the
[44:21] natural I wonder what would happen if we
[44:23] could ever believe the word that we know
[44:26] if we could ever grab a hold of it and
[44:27] say Lord today I'm going to have faith
[44:30] I'm going to believe your word I'm not
[44:32] going to doubt it I'm not going to look
[44:34] back and say it's for another age I'm
[44:36] not going to say it's for some other
[44:37] group of people I'm not going to say I'm
[44:39] not worthy of it I'm just going to say
[44:41] Lord I believe I wonder how many of us
[44:44] can say that tonight Lord I believe help
[44:47] thou my unbelief let me be a believer
[44:49] let me be somebody who can believe God
[44:52] and take him at his
[44:54] word so we we know then that there's
[44:57] such a difference yeah so we also know
[45:01] that Christ is the door to all the
[45:04] promises of God so it's as if there's a
[45:07] room and in that room are all the
[45:10] promises in that room is healing in that
[45:12] room is salvation in that room is your
[45:14] your children your grandchildren in that
[45:17] room is everything you have need of an
[45:19] Abundant Life peace Joy all the things
[45:21] that you need is inside of that room and
[45:25] then that room has a door on it and the
[45:27] door is Christ and he is the word so
[45:31] then he is the door he tells us that in
[45:33] John 109 he said I am the door by me if
[45:37] any man enter in he shall be saved and
[45:39] shall go in and out and find pasture and
[45:42] so we know he is the door and in him lay
[45:46] all someone say all all the promises of
[45:50] God Amen yeah are in Christ yes he is
[45:54] the land where all the promises slay he
[45:57] is the third pole if we can say it that
[45:59] way he is the seventh seal he is the one
[46:02] who can open the book and and loose the
[46:04] seals he is also the book he said well I
[46:07] thought we were the book yes we are
[46:09] because we are him he He Is We Are flesh
[46:12] of his flesh bone of his bone
[46:15] amen so he is the one who looses all
[46:18] these things the Bible says all the
[46:20] promises of God in him are yay and in
[46:24] him amen nothing negative about him unto
[46:26] the glory of God by us so I want to
[46:30] build your faith tonight because Satan
[46:31] does so much to try to destroy it he
[46:34] does so much to try to bring it down and
[46:36] bring you to a place where you can't
[46:38] believe but if you can believe I don't
[46:39] care what your past has been I don't
[46:41] care what's going on in your life I
[46:43] don't care what's happened this week if
[46:45] you can believe all things are possible
[46:48] if you can believe for healing you can
[46:50] be healed if you can believe for
[46:51] salvation you can whatever it is that
[46:53] you're wanting that's you you've already
[46:56] seen God do it before you can look in
[46:58] the scriptures and see he a God who does
[47:00] that and you can say Lord I believe you
[47:03] can have it if you can believe
[47:06] it 2 Corinthians 1:20 again all the
[47:10] promises of God in him are yay yes he is
[47:13] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[47:17] all the promises are unlocked by faith
[47:21] in him he is the door so faith is the
[47:25] key and I titled this tonight the key to
[47:28] everything yeah the key to everything
[47:32] yeah faith is the key to everything yes
[47:36] so it doesn't matter the specifics of
[47:38] that faith is the key to it if if I want
[47:42] if I want to prosper in my business and
[47:44] I believe I want to do that for the
[47:46] right reasons faith is the key to that
[47:48] if I want to prosper in my home in my
[47:51] family and I'm doing that for the right
[47:52] reasons with the right motives then
[47:54] faith is to keepy to that if I want to
[47:57] be healthy faith is the key to that are
[48:00] you with me now Faith is the key to all
[48:02] of these things and so the door is open
[48:05] to me if I have faith I have the ability
[48:09] to unlock the door and in the room that
[48:13] is behind the door is everything that I
[48:16] need in Christ so the door is open to me
[48:20] if I have faith and everything in the
[48:21] room is mine but if I do not have faith
[48:24] the door is closed and the word actually
[48:26] becomes a hindrance to me as a door
[48:28] would be if it was locked that we cannot
[48:31] we cannot go in all we can do is stand
[48:33] outside and say well I wish I was a
[48:34] better Christian I wish I was a better
[48:36] person I wish I I I wish that I could
[48:39] get over my depression I wish I could
[48:41] overcome anxiety I wish I could overcome
[48:43] these things in my life what you don't
[48:45] recognize is the answer that you need is
[48:47] on the inside of the door and all you
[48:49] need to do is believe and the belief is
[48:51] the key to get you through the door and
[48:55] you say well I've tried before and it
[48:57] didn't work but that's not the kind of
[48:58] Faith we're talking about we're talking
[49:00] about a kind of Faith like Abraham had
[49:02] that every day his faith got stronger
[49:04] his body got weaker but his faith got
[49:06] stronger and he did that for 25 years
[49:09] and one day the promise came what was it
[49:12] the faith he believed it and it was
[49:14] behind the
[49:15] door good are you with me so far yes so
[49:19] if I do not have the faith the door is
[49:21] closed and the word becomes a hindrance
[49:23] to me receiving my promise just like the
[49:25] sop phenician woman was standing there
[49:27] and the word stood there and said it's
[49:29] not mean for me to take the children's
[49:31] bread and give it to
[49:32] dogs but she said even the dogs eat the
[49:36] crumbs that fall from the master's table
[49:38] she would not even let the word be a
[49:40] hindrance she took the key of faith and
[49:42] unlock the door oh that we could do that
[49:44] tonight you young people could do that
[49:46] tonight grab that key of faith and
[49:48] unlock the door to the promises of God
[49:50] but my family does things this way let
[49:52] me unlock the door and do things
[49:54] differently
[49:56] and we know that knowledge doesn't
[49:58] unlock the door right yeah you can know
[50:02] everything about the message and walk up
[50:03] to the door and say I'm a PhD lld
[50:07] equivalent and whatever that would be in
[50:08] the message of the
[50:09] hour and the door just it's just there
[50:13] that doesn't move the door it doesn't
[50:16] unlock the door the only thing that
[50:17] unlocks the door is the
[50:19] key right and the key according to the
[50:21] message of the hour is
[50:23] Faith so if you can get nothing
[50:26] according to the scriptures you get
[50:27] nothing without faith without faith is
[50:29] impossible to please God and you get
[50:31] everything with faith because if you
[50:33] believe you can have what you ask for so
[50:35] then everything the the the key is the
[50:39] faith is the key to
[50:41] everything and and I want to do this
[50:44] because we believe in Holiness but
[50:45] Holiness doesn't unlock the
[50:47] door right and that's why sometimes
[50:49] somebody can come in brand new and come
[50:51] off the street and begin to receive
[50:53] blessings from God and somebody sit in
[50:55] church for decade after decade and do
[50:57] everything right yeah but never come
[51:00] never come into the promises of God
[51:01] never receive the promise why because
[51:04] the promise is not unlocked by good
[51:06] living yeah all right and I that
[51:08] shouldn't discourage us from good living
[51:09] that's the action of Faith but the Joel
[51:11] preached about last Wednesday night but
[51:12] it ought to encourage us to live right
[51:14] it ought to be something in us why
[51:16] because we believe the word of
[51:18] God so knowledge doesn't unlock the door
[51:21] Holiness doesn't unlock the door begging
[51:22] doesn't unlock the door right yeah you
[51:25] can stand outside the door and say well
[51:28] I've been a good person I've served the
[51:29] Lord all my life I've done everything
[51:32] right and somebody else walk up the door
[51:34] and say I've done everything wrong but I
[51:39] believe what was the difference in the
[51:41] two thieves one was on his right one was
[51:44] on his left but one said that one said
[51:47] oh you know we're just here and they're
[51:49] going to kill us and we're going we're
[51:51] going to hell anyway and we might as
[51:52] well just go and the other one said Lord
[51:55] remember me when you come into your
[51:56] kingdom that was the only difference the
[51:58] one unlocked the door to Salvation and
[52:00] the other one went by the place where he
[52:02] was going don't you realize that's the
[52:04] only difference in you and The Sinner is
[52:06] Faith that's the only thing that's
[52:08] standing between you and the world is
[52:10] Faith oh I say God Give Me Faith tonight
[52:12] to believe your
[52:14] word let me believe that I'm a Christian
[52:16] let me believe that I'm I'm a I can I
[52:19] can understand the things of God let me
[52:21] believe these things begging doesn't
[52:24] unlock the door
[52:26] only faith can unlock the
[52:28] door got to believe it
[52:32] right if I had a million dollars to give
[52:34] you if you didn't believe I had it it
[52:36] would not do you any
[52:38] good because you would never ask of
[52:42] it right I could have all the I could
[52:45] have everything that you need you know
[52:47] they say that's the difference in in uh
[52:50] being successful and and not being
[52:51] successful it's like did you ask
[52:55] right you have to ask they teach you
[52:57] that in sales you got to ask if you
[52:59] didn't ask that's why you didn't
[53:01] sell I I think it was Charles Spurgeon
[53:04] one
[53:05] time there was a man a young Minister
[53:07] come to him discouraged he said brother
[53:09] Spurgeon he said I've I've worked all
[53:11] year and he said no souls were saved and
[53:14] nobody could nobody came to the house of
[53:16] God no one was baptized he said I'm so
[53:17] discouraged he said well at the
[53:19] beginning of the year how many did you
[53:20] expect to
[53:21] come he said well I I I didn't really
[53:24] expect anything anybody to come he said
[53:26] well there's your problem that's
[53:28] right yeah only faith can unlock that
[53:31] door you got to believe it or you're
[53:32] never going to see it you've got to take
[53:35] the action of Faith you're not going to
[53:36] baptize anybody with an empty Baptist
[53:38] tree you're not going to you're not
[53:40] going to unless you unless you prepare
[53:43] for wealth unless you prepare for growth
[53:46] unless you prepare for godliness to
[53:48] increase in your life unless you prepare
[53:50] for Faith to increase it'll never happen
[53:52] right you got to make room for it yeah
[53:55] so you have to believe it now we know
[53:57] when Christ was on Earth he had perfect
[54:00] Faith how many believe that tonight and
[54:03] the disciples could see the difference
[54:06] in their faith and his faith because
[54:10] their faith was limited they believed as
[54:13] long as it was something simple but when
[54:15] it was a hard case they wondered whether
[54:17] it could be done I think about the old
[54:20] song that was talking about the four men
[54:21] that brought the crippled man to Jesus
[54:23] and they brought him up and and each one
[54:26] began to introduce himself said well I
[54:27] was healed I was lame and I was healed
[54:29] but this man's too far gone the other
[54:31] one said well I I was blind I was healed
[54:33] but this man's too far gone and the
[54:35] fourth one finally says my name is
[54:36] Lazarus yes amen right what do you say
[54:39] to Lazarus he's he's already been
[54:41] brought back from the dead he he's
[54:43] already been as bad as he could be I'd
[54:45] like to say I'm like Lazarus tonight
[54:47] I've been I've been dead in trespasses
[54:49] and sin but I come out of it one day yes
[54:52] sir and so the disciples could see his
[54:56] faith was something that could make a
[54:58] difference in people's lives in a way
[55:00] that theirs couldn't and so the apostles
[55:03] come to him and they said Lord increase
[55:06] our
[55:07] faith and Luke 17:16 and the Lord said
[55:10] if you had Faith now look what he's
[55:12] saying he said you don't need an
[55:13] increase of Faith you need to use the
[55:15] faith you
[55:16] have he said if you had Faith as a grain
[55:20] of mustard seed have you ever seen a
[55:22] mustard seed it's one of the tiniest
[55:24] seeds that there
[55:26] is and so he said if you had Faith as a
[55:29] grain of mustard seed it's tiny but it's
[55:31] pure it can't be mixed he said if you
[55:33] had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed
[55:36] you might say to this sachine tree be
[55:38] thou plucked up by the root be thou
[55:40] planted in the sea and it should obey
[55:42] you boy make Landscaping easier wouldn't
[55:45] it wouldn't it be nice if in the spring
[55:47] of the year we just come out here and
[55:49] instead of doing all this Landscaping
[55:50] that we want to do in the spring if we
[55:52] just come out here and say now you move
[55:53] there and you move there and you'd be
[55:55] planted there and but if we had the
[55:57] faith he said we could do it right if we
[55:59] really believe that we could do it we
[56:01] could do it maybe it'd be better for us
[56:03] if we did it ourselves but but but if we
[56:05] had the faith we could do those things
[56:07] but they could not take the hard cases
[56:09] now Matthew 17:19 I believe brother Joel
[56:12] read this last week but he said then
[56:14] came the disciples to Jesus apart and
[56:16] said why could we not cast him out so in
[56:18] other words there was a an epilepsy case
[56:20] that was a demon that would that was a
[56:22] very hard demon it wasn't just a a maybe
[56:25] some you didn't hear very well and now
[56:26] you can hear better or something like
[56:27] that this was a hard case and they could
[56:30] not cast him out and Jesus said unto
[56:32] them because of your unbelief for verily
[56:35] I say unto you if you have faith as a
[56:36] grain of a mustard seed you shall say
[56:39] unto this mountain remove hence to place
[56:41] so now not just a tree but a mountain
[56:44] and it shall remove and nothing someone
[56:46] say nothing nothing shall be impossible
[56:49] unto you that's the difference in faith
[56:52] and and doubt that's the difference in
[56:54] believing in
[56:56] disbelieving Jesus had perfect faith
[56:58] brother brand said he had it and it come
[57:00] because he was the word and you become
[57:03] the word amen I like this this is not
[57:06] the age of halfway Faith this is not the
[57:08] age of of Faith well just to do a former
[57:11] denomination this is the age of
[57:12] rapturing Faith this is the age of
[57:15] perfect Faith so he said you become the
[57:17] word that's why the word was opened in
[57:19] our days so we could become the word and
[57:21] he said you become the word as you
[57:23] receive the word he said if you abide in
[57:25] me and my words in you my words which he
[57:28] said this word abides in you then ask
[57:30] what you will and it'll be done for you
[57:32] you don't have to make compromises with
[57:34] the devil you don't have to live like
[57:36] the world you don't have to make your
[57:37] business work or to make something else
[57:39] work you can just believe God you don't
[57:41] have to give up going to church to have
[57:44] to have enough to feed your family you
[57:45] can believe God and God will give it to
[57:48] you why by faith everything is is
[57:50] possible to
[57:52] you if you say to this mountain
[57:55] I think some of us that have been on the
[57:56] road for a while we can testify that by
[57:58] the bill I know that God has moved
[58:00] Mountains for me it might have moved one
[58:02] set grain of sand at a time but he moved
[58:04] the mountain why because I believed he
[58:08] could Hallelujah he said if you say to
[58:11] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[58:12] but believe in what you said you shall
[58:14] have what you said when you pray believe
[58:16] that you receive what you ask for you
[58:17] shall have it it'll be given to you time
[58:20] space nothing else will ever change it
[58:22] you know it's done it's already over
[58:24] with how me Amen to that today he said
[58:27] now he said to us if you abide in me in
[58:28] my word and you St John here you can ask
[58:30] what you will to be done he said then
[58:32] recognize your position in the scripture
[58:35] as a
[58:37] Believer right now how do you do that
[58:40] well you look in the scripture and you
[58:42] see what a Believer what happened to a
[58:44] Believer and now say you have a need and
[58:46] there was some there's a believer in the
[58:48] scripture and you can see that that
[58:50] believer maybe you just need some more
[58:53] uh loe's and fishes and you realize
[58:55] there was a young boy who gave Jesus his
[58:58] lunch and when he did he multiplied it
[59:01] fed 5,000 you say Lord I just need the
[59:04] groceries to last a few more days you
[59:07] ever been in that situation Lord I just
[59:10] need the groceries to last to the end of
[59:11] the week then you can ask what you will
[59:13] I'm not talking about Voodoo I'm not
[59:15] talking about some kind of a
[59:16] supernatural thing or or or guessing or
[59:19] something like that I'm talking about
[59:20] believing God and many times God will
[59:23] use natural means many times he'll use
[59:25] your own job your own work many times
[59:27] he'll use somebody around you the
[59:29] natural means that you don't even
[59:30] understand what it is but God's
[59:32] providing
[59:33] it I heard a story about a old lady that
[59:37] was a widow woman and she she was always
[59:40] saying that God was going to provide and
[59:42] she had an atheist to live next door so
[59:45] he thought he'd play a trick on her and
[59:46] and he put a uh one day he put a bunch
[59:49] of groceries by her front door and he
[59:50] hid behind the bushes and he watched her
[59:53] and here she come out the door to the oh
[59:54] God you're going to provide for me today
[59:56] she walks out she sees the groceries and
[59:58] she just so happy she said Lord you
[1:00:00] answered my prayer and he jumps out from
[1:00:02] behind the bush and he said hi he said I
[1:00:04] caught you he said that was he said that
[1:00:06] wasn't God that was me and she said oh
[1:00:09] Lord I Thank you for answering my prayer
[1:00:11] and letting the devil deliver the
[1:00:16] groceries sometimes he'll use just
[1:00:18] natural things but he it still gets done
[1:00:21] somehow it still happens why because you
[1:00:23] believed it
[1:00:25] am you believe it you can have it so you
[1:00:29] got to recognize your position in
[1:00:30] scripture as a Believer if Hannah
[1:00:32] received a baby because she cried out to
[1:00:35] God and she and she prayed and asked for
[1:00:37] it and God gave her the desire of her
[1:00:39] heart then if I was in need of that
[1:00:41] that's what I don't need any more kids
[1:00:43] but if I needed that God would provide
[1:00:45] it and if you needed if you needed a job
[1:00:48] God would provide a job because you see
[1:00:50] others he's provided a job for you can
[1:00:52] look in the scripture and find that God
[1:00:54] commanded us to work as men then if you
[1:00:57] need a job God will provide provide a
[1:00:59] job if you need healing God will provide
[1:01:01] healing he said I'm the god that heals
[1:01:03] all your diseases if you need eyesight
[1:01:05] he'll provide eyesight if you need
[1:01:06] whatever you have if you need more oil
[1:01:08] in the cruise in the tank there there
[1:01:10] will be a place for that it won't fail
[1:01:13] until the time comes listen whatever you
[1:01:15] have need of he'll provide for you now
[1:01:19] watch he said you got to recognize your
[1:01:22] position in the scripture as a believer
[1:01:24] you got to recognize your position as he
[1:01:26] recognized his position you got to see
[1:01:28] now he could look at the word and say
[1:01:30] this is what it says about the Messiah
[1:01:32] this is who I am this day this scripture
[1:01:34] is fulfilled you realize that's how
[1:01:36] Jesus knew who he was in the word he
[1:01:38] looked at the scripture and this the
[1:01:40] anointed word the word spoke to the word
[1:01:42] and he said that's me yes and you and I
[1:01:45] have to be able to look at the scripture
[1:01:46] and the word speak back to us and say
[1:01:48] that's me I was the widow woman in need
[1:01:51] I was the bride I was the I was I was
[1:01:54] the the one there in Jericho I was Rahab
[1:01:56] in Jericho but God saved me and my
[1:01:59] family I was David facing the Goliath
[1:02:02] but God brought down
[1:02:04] Goliath you got to recognize your
[1:02:06] position in the
[1:02:07] scripture as a believer I'm not Saul I'm
[1:02:11] not going to shake when the enemy comes
[1:02:13] I'm a Believer I recognize that I'm not
[1:02:16] someone that's going down I'm someone
[1:02:18] just going up I'm not an unbeliever I'm
[1:02:20] a Believer I've cross the chasm I have
[1:02:23] the key to the door yes so he he knew
[1:02:27] who he was now the BR said you must
[1:02:30] believe what you asked for if you are a
[1:02:33] Believer recognize yourself as a
[1:02:36] Believer you need to look in the mirror
[1:02:39] and say there's a
[1:02:42] Believer there's not a halfway there's
[1:02:45] not a cold lukewarm leoan uh
[1:02:49] denominational chicken there's an eagle
[1:02:52] I wonder how many of us could look and
[1:02:53] honestly say that there's a Believer you
[1:02:55] need to believe that there's a Believer
[1:02:58] standing in front of me I'm not some
[1:03:00] person that's not going in the Rapture
[1:03:02] I'm going to make it there's a believer
[1:03:04] in the
[1:03:05] mirror there's a Believer I can overcome
[1:03:07] with my family I don't have to
[1:03:09] compromise I don't have to give in I can
[1:03:10] believe all the word of God there's a
[1:03:12] believer in the
[1:03:14] mirror your heart has got to be assured
[1:03:18] that you're a Believer assure your heart
[1:03:21] and and and it talks about that in first
[1:03:23] John I'm trying to say time tonight so I
[1:03:25] didn't I didn't get the scripture but
[1:03:27] John goes and he says he said your heart
[1:03:29] must be assured said if your heart
[1:03:31] condemn us not then you can believe and
[1:03:33] brother brandom picks that up and he
[1:03:34] says you can't have condemnation in your
[1:03:36] heart but if you go down in the
[1:03:37] scripture uh John begins to speak he
[1:03:40] said we know our hearts condemn us not
[1:03:42] if we do his Commandments he said what
[1:03:44] are his Commandments he said to
[1:03:47] believe to believe that's his
[1:03:49] commandment believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:03:51] Christ and he said to love the Brethren
[1:03:53] well I can do that
[1:03:54] how many could say you could do that
[1:03:56] tonight then you can you can keep his
[1:03:58] Commandments not by keeping every letter
[1:04:00] of the law but by Believe by being a
[1:04:02] believer in who he is and by loving the
[1:04:05] brethren we can all do that tonight
[1:04:07] believe that's why you're here because
[1:04:09] you believe now Faith we know is a
[1:04:13] revelation that comes to you it's not
[1:04:16] you building yourself up into a place
[1:04:18] where you can believe but it's something
[1:04:21] you
[1:04:21] know you just know it
[1:04:24] I'm a Christian and I know it I don't
[1:04:27] know it because I cried I don't know it
[1:04:28] because oh my I don't know it because I
[1:04:31] spoke in tongues I don't know it because
[1:04:32] I run the a I know it because I just
[1:04:34] know it it's a revelation to me I belong
[1:04:37] here I'm an eagle not a chicken I belong
[1:04:40] in the house of God it's a
[1:04:42] revelation now he said you must believe
[1:04:44] what you asked for and and so now he he
[1:04:49] he said the uh we know that Faith being
[1:04:51] a revelation the Bible says by faith
[1:04:54] Faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:04:55] excellent sacrifice than Cain so we
[1:04:57] could say by
[1:04:58] Revelation that he recognized that the
[1:05:01] antidote for original sin that become a
[1:05:03] revelation to him that there was a way
[1:05:06] out and he knew that that Revelation
[1:05:09] told him that to go and take the action
[1:05:12] of Faith slay the lamb and offer Blood
[1:05:13] on the altar because it was a revelation
[1:05:16] of faith and we know that when the
[1:05:19] finished work becomes a revelation to
[1:05:22] us so he recognized that a lamb died for
[1:05:25] the sins of his parents so a lamb had to
[1:05:28] die for his sins and if you could
[1:05:30] recognize if it become a revelation to
[1:05:32] you today that Christ died for me yeah
[1:05:36] everything else would fall into place
[1:05:39] Christ didn't just die for the preacher
[1:05:41] he didn't just die for my neighbor he
[1:05:43] died for
[1:05:44] me he came to get me if there would only
[1:05:47] been one he would have come for me oh
[1:05:50] aren't you glad for that today the
[1:05:52] finished work becomes a revelation a you
[1:05:55] recognize that he died for you and you
[1:05:57] really see that and you begin to act on
[1:05:59] that
[1:06:00] Revelation now we know that behind this
[1:06:03] door Christ is God's
[1:06:07] treasure brother brandom said there's
[1:06:09] something behind the door
[1:06:12] worthwhile or it would not be a key to
[1:06:15] it it wouldn't be locked unless there
[1:06:18] was some treasure behind the door so he
[1:06:22] talked about the polio vaccine and he
[1:06:25] talked about the how polio had come
[1:06:26] through Jeffersonville and how it had
[1:06:28] just destroyed all the children and
[1:06:30] things and that it was and he said the
[1:06:33] firemen stood out on the corners and
[1:06:35] took up money to try to do away with
[1:06:36] polio but one day the vaccine it become
[1:06:40] a revelation to Dr Sul that there could
[1:06:43] be a vaccine for polio and it become a
[1:06:46] key he had the key and when he had the
[1:06:49] key he could unlock the healing or the
[1:06:52] prevention of polio he talk talked about
[1:06:54] uh the light bulb Edison with the light
[1:06:56] bulb that seems like it it's so common
[1:06:59] to us now you realize that I saw
[1:07:01] something the other day they said for
[1:07:03] for thousands of years people people
[1:07:07] traveled by
[1:07:08] horse right thousands of years the mode
[1:07:12] of transportation wasn't any faster or
[1:07:14] better for the people in 1890 than it
[1:07:17] was in in year
[1:07:21] zero right it just it just wasn't that
[1:07:24] much different but between then and now
[1:07:27] we've gone from a horse to a
[1:07:30] spaceship what what's happening is that
[1:07:33] once the door was unlocked to
[1:07:36] Transportation then it just kept
[1:07:38] unfolding and kept unfolding so once you
[1:07:40] had the combustion engine then
[1:07:42] everything else kind of fell into place
[1:07:44] and that's the way it is with a
[1:07:46] Christian if you can ever get behind
[1:07:48] that door if you can unlock the door for
[1:07:49] your salvation you can unlock the door
[1:07:51] for your healing if you can unlock the
[1:07:53] door for your healing you can unlock the
[1:07:55] door to peace you can unlock all
[1:07:57] everything
[1:07:58] else so there's got to be something
[1:08:01] worthwhile behind the door now brother
[1:08:02] brand said we read in St John the 10th
[1:08:04] chapter Jesus said I'm the door to the
[1:08:06] Sheepfold I am the door not a door the
[1:08:09] door the only door I'm the way the only
[1:08:11] way the truth how many believe that
[1:08:13] tonight no man cometh unto the father
[1:08:15] but by me I am the door to the Sheepfold
[1:08:18] and all that comes before me is enemies
[1:08:20] thev and robbers he is the door of the
[1:08:21] Sheepfold he is the door to salvation
[1:08:24] there's not another name given under
[1:08:26] heaven whereby you must be saved only
[1:08:28] through the name of Jesus Christ no
[1:08:29] church no denomination no Creed no
[1:08:32] doctrines of anything only through Jesus
[1:08:34] name that is the key he said no wonder
[1:08:37] Peter could use one of them on the day
[1:08:38] of Pentecost they wanted to know how to
[1:08:40] get into that door he used the key and
[1:08:42] there's only one key cuz there's just
[1:08:43] one door he said I am the door and Peter
[1:08:46] had the key to it he said repent every
[1:08:48] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:08:49] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:08:50] your sin you shall receive the treasures
[1:08:52] of God it's the the key to the door and
[1:08:54] Jesus is the door there's only one door
[1:08:56] to Healing Jesus is that door there's
[1:08:58] only one door to peace how many believe
[1:09:00] that tonight only one door to peace you
[1:09:02] may go through all the all the training
[1:09:04] and all the psychi psychiatrist and
[1:09:06] everything else but there's only one
[1:09:08] door to peace and he stands here today
[1:09:10] and says I am the door amen if you could
[1:09:13] have the faith to unlock that door he's
[1:09:16] the only door to genuine peace you might
[1:09:18] think you got peace you might accumulate
[1:09:19] enough money to buy your home you might
[1:09:21] accumulate enough money to get your
[1:09:22] children clothes half deep you might
[1:09:24] have accumulated enough popularity to be
[1:09:26] popular amongst people but when you slip
[1:09:28] off your shoes at night get ready to lay
[1:09:29] down there's only one thing can give you
[1:09:31] peace that is if you know you were dying
[1:09:33] that night there's only one peace and
[1:09:35] that's Jesus is the peace he is our
[1:09:40] peace he is our healing I'm the Lord thy
[1:09:43] God that heals all of your diseases
[1:09:45] someone say all all of your diseases he
[1:09:47] is the door to heaven and there's no
[1:09:49] other door no other way but through
[1:09:51] Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven
[1:09:54] and now Jesus he said is the door to all
[1:09:56] these things and faith is the key that
[1:09:59] unlocks the door now if Jesus is the
[1:10:02] door to all these promises of God faith
[1:10:04] in his finished work unlocks every door
[1:10:07] someone say every door to every
[1:10:11] treasure amen every door to every
[1:10:14] treasure Hallelujah there is inside the
[1:10:17] kingdom of God faith is the key that
[1:10:21] unlocks every promise he
[1:10:25] makes F then if we have a promise of a
[1:10:28] Rapture in this day Faith is the key
[1:10:30] that unlocks that all faith is the key
[1:10:33] that unlocks every promise he makes the
[1:10:35] key of Faith does that Faith what in
[1:10:36] what faith in his finished work a
[1:10:39] revelation that it was for me a
[1:10:40] revelation that it took blood that there
[1:10:42] was a lamb offered for
[1:10:44] me Faith being a
[1:10:48] revelation now we we have confidence in
[1:10:51] the key and in the lock because every
[1:10:54] time we put the key in the door it works
[1:10:57] yes right now you'd think it was funny
[1:11:00] if you got home now my wife the other
[1:11:04] day she had to leave and and she ended
[1:11:07] up taking the kids to Sonic but she she
[1:11:09] left went home and there was an ulterior
[1:11:11] motive to her being chaperon on that
[1:11:12] trip because she forgot her key to home
[1:11:16] and so when she left the house she left
[1:11:18] my shirt there for the night service and
[1:11:20] so she had to go back but she didn't
[1:11:23] have the key so she borrowed got my key
[1:11:25] and went back and with with the key she
[1:11:27] could get to anything in the house
[1:11:30] without the key she couldn't get in now
[1:11:32] me I could probably find a way in but we
[1:11:34] might have to repair
[1:11:37] something but but she couldn't find a
[1:11:39] way in unless she had the key with the
[1:11:40] key was so easy she just walked up to
[1:11:43] the door and turned it and you know what
[1:11:45] something funny about a key you never
[1:11:46] expect it not to
[1:11:49] work you stick your key in your car and
[1:11:52] you don't ever think about it not
[1:11:53] working brother Mark it just it just
[1:11:55] works that's right stick it in turn it
[1:11:57] and if it ever doesn't work boy you get
[1:12:00] mad cuz you you're disappointed you
[1:12:03] expect it to work oh if we could only
[1:12:05] believe in God like that if we can only
[1:12:07] believe in God like we believe in our
[1:12:08] Toyotas or our Hondas or our Fords or or
[1:12:11] our yugos or whatever it is if we can
[1:12:13] only believe in God like we believe in
[1:12:15] our cars if we can only believe in like
[1:12:17] we believe in Arkansas Department of
[1:12:21] Transportation think about it for a
[1:12:23] minute you put more trust in these
[1:12:25] Bridges out here built by man than you
[1:12:29] do in
[1:12:30] Jehovah God help me tonight we put more
[1:12:33] trust and brother B said faith is like
[1:12:35] crossing a bridge you don't expect it to
[1:12:37] fail you expect it to hold up and we
[1:12:40] expect God to keep his promise yes sir
[1:12:43] that's that's good but it's because we
[1:12:45] know that this key moves the levers of
[1:12:48] the word now lock has levers on the
[1:12:51] inside but the any correct m key has
[1:12:52] levers on the the inside of the lock and
[1:12:54] it takes a certain form a certain shape
[1:12:57] and keys to turn those levers he said
[1:12:59] and just one little lever out of the way
[1:13:00] will mess the whole thing up he said
[1:13:02] therefore I believe in the Full Gospel
[1:13:04] every word of God that turns the power
[1:13:07] of God loose that turns his blessings to
[1:13:09] the people it's the key to the door that
[1:13:11] unlocks it oh he said those great Heroes
[1:13:13] those prophets and great men of the
[1:13:15] Bible that had that key he said that's
[1:13:16] the reason they can stop the mouths of
[1:13:18] lions quench the violence of fire escape
[1:13:21] the edge of the sword bring the dead
[1:13:22] back to life again do all kinds of
[1:13:24] Miracles he says because they held that
[1:13:26] key and they knew it worked because it
[1:13:29] was a scripture born key he said now if
[1:13:32] I'm progging with a Creed key I don't
[1:13:35] know what it's going to do if they say
[1:13:37] my church teaches this I don't know
[1:13:39] about that now Pop Quiz what is
[1:13:44] progging never did find out how to lay
[1:13:46] down your windshield but I did find out
[1:13:47] what progging was and I thought it was
[1:13:50] brother brand trying to say something
[1:13:52] else but it wasn't there's actually a
[1:13:53] word progging brother Joel did you know
[1:13:56] this find out something you didn't know
[1:13:58] I finally taught him
[1:13:59] something progging is British dialect
[1:14:03] means to prowl about as if for food or
[1:14:05] plunder not be sure where you're going
[1:14:07] be like a a like a like a bum we would
[1:14:09] say today somebody just wanders around
[1:14:12] he's progging he's always begging he
[1:14:14] said if you're just progging around if
[1:14:17] you're just if you're just trying to
[1:14:19] make it work he said that's not that's
[1:14:20] not going to work he said that's like a
[1:14:22] Creed he said you take it and you're
[1:14:23] just sticking in the hole but you don't
[1:14:25] know if it's going to work but if you
[1:14:26] could ever get the right key and the
[1:14:28] right lock what is that the word of God
[1:14:30] and we have the fullness of the word in
[1:14:31] our day yes sir we don't have to prow
[1:14:33] about we don't have to beg we don't have
[1:14:35] to sit on the corner and and put a will
[1:14:38] work for correct Doctrine sign out we
[1:14:40] know what the word says we know the
[1:14:42] light's been shining shined in our day
[1:14:44] we know we the book is open and what
[1:14:46] does that mean to us it means I can have
[1:14:48] faith in all the promises of God I don't
[1:14:51] have to question the message of the hour
[1:14:52] I don't have to question the Bible I can
[1:14:54] have faith and know that it's right I
[1:14:56] can look at it and say Lord that's for
[1:14:58] me help me live it help me to become it
[1:15:01] help me to believe
[1:15:02] it he said but when the Bible teaches it
[1:15:05] and I hold the faith key in my hand or
[1:15:07] in my heart it says that's God's word
[1:15:11] that'll quench the violence of fire
[1:15:13] it'll unlock healing for the sick it'll
[1:15:15] unlock salvation to the Lost he said I
[1:15:17] have to come to the door everything's in
[1:15:19] his name whatever you do in word or deed
[1:15:21] do it all in his name knowing that the
[1:15:23] key that you got his faith because it's
[1:15:25] a scripture made key he said enough it's
[1:15:26] a Creed key a denominational key I don't
[1:15:29] know what it'll do but if it's a
[1:15:30] scriptural key it'll unlock why because
[1:15:32] God said so how many believe that today
[1:15:35] it'll unlock because God said so that's
[1:15:39] good you hold the key to the door
[1:15:43] because the Revelation Faith came to
[1:15:46] you you saw yourself in a vision brother
[1:15:50] BR said you have to see yourself in a in
[1:15:51] a well body and then walk in into
[1:15:54] that that's good so brother brandom is
[1:15:57] constantly if you go back in the prayer
[1:15:58] lines he's telling us people go and be
[1:16:01] well go eat your supper go be happy go
[1:16:04] rejoicing go and be well now he's not
[1:16:07] giv them a prophecy but a statement of
[1:16:09] faith because someone went out went to
[1:16:12] the prayer line one time and left and
[1:16:13] died and and brother random had said
[1:16:16] you're healed and they told him they
[1:16:18] said they said well you're a false
[1:16:20] prophet you they come through and died
[1:16:22] he said no he said I'm understand what
[1:16:23] the word
[1:16:24] says see when they come through the he
[1:16:27] said the the Visions don't heal you the
[1:16:29] vision just increases your faith that
[1:16:31] you believe that there's a real God that
[1:16:33] can know those things and do those
[1:16:34] things but but it's actually you that
[1:16:36] holds the key to your own healing
[1:16:38] because that faith has got to come to
[1:16:40] you you've got to see yourself in the
[1:16:42] vision right and that's why it increased
[1:16:44] Faith so much is because by the Danny
[1:16:46] they could look and he' say now you're
[1:16:47] from a certain certain city and you're
[1:16:49] you have a nephew who who wears a
[1:16:51] certain color of coat he lives on a
[1:16:53] certain Street and he's been up to the
[1:16:55] doctor and certain things and you take
[1:16:57] that prayer call to him you'll be well
[1:16:58] and when they begin to see themselves in
[1:17:00] the vision they recognize that's me what
[1:17:03] happens is it increases their faith now
[1:17:06] we don't have that that gift on the
[1:17:07] Earth today I I challenge that people
[1:17:10] say we have gifts like that today we
[1:17:11] don't have gifts like that today because
[1:17:13] it was one to a generation one to an age
[1:17:16] that was a prophet I believe we have
[1:17:17] gifts but not like that one because it
[1:17:20] was the sign of the son of man God don't
[1:17:21] need to do it twice but the r said God
[1:17:23] didn't need to do it even more than
[1:17:25] once and he did it thousands of times so
[1:17:28] we don't we're not looking for that gift
[1:17:30] but we can still see ourselves in the
[1:17:32] vision right brother brandom said that
[1:17:35] there was a missionary in Africa and or
[1:17:37] going to Africa and he went before the
[1:17:38] mission board and they began to tell
[1:17:40] about the dangers and early on many
[1:17:43] years ago in Africa there was many
[1:17:44] dangers going there there still is but
[1:17:46] the dangers have changed but there there
[1:17:48] was there was a lot of danger in going
[1:17:51] there and and he was going to take his
[1:17:52] family be there for years and they told
[1:17:55] him about the disease they told him
[1:17:56] about the natives and they told him
[1:17:58] about the trouble and they said all of
[1:18:00] these things this is what's going to
[1:18:01] happen to you and he begin to cry he
[1:18:04] said but but I know what my calling is
[1:18:08] he said I know I'm called to do it he
[1:18:10] said if if I'm in the will of God he
[1:18:12] said the safest place I can be is in the
[1:18:15] will of God am oh I wonder if we got a
[1:18:18] revelation of that and brother BR said
[1:18:19] he had the key to his calling he had the
[1:18:23] key to his calling he said when you got
[1:18:25] the key there's no fear there's no doubt
[1:18:27] there's no question amen you you know I
[1:18:30] was born to do this I was born to be a
[1:18:32] Christian I was born to be a child of
[1:18:34] God I was born to be a mother or father
[1:18:36] whatever you do you got the key to that
[1:18:39] yes you don't have to question it he
[1:18:41] said you got the key there's no fear
[1:18:42] there's no doubt there's no question you
[1:18:44] don't have to ask anybody else about it
[1:18:46] you know exactly you've got it in your
[1:18:48] hands you know what to
[1:18:50] do he said you know what the score is
[1:18:53] amen hallelujah you know what the score
[1:18:56] is brother Daryl Ward tells the story of
[1:18:59] of the baseball game they were all up to
[1:19:01] bat and they they begin to hit the hit
[1:19:03] the ball and pretty soon I think it was
[1:19:04] 11 to nothing and and uh and somebody
[1:19:07] asked one of the team somebody was up on
[1:19:09] the up on the scoreboard and they asked
[1:19:10] the outfielder they said how's the game
[1:19:13] going he said well we don't know yet we
[1:19:14] haven't come up to
[1:19:18] bat it might be 11 nothing but we
[1:19:20] haven't batted yet oh Church if you only
[1:19:23] know if you only realize what the score
[1:19:26] is Jesus already already won for us and
[1:19:30] so we know that the door is going to
[1:19:32] unlock he said you've checked the levers
[1:19:34] you know it's strictly the right thing
[1:19:36] the door is going to fly open when you
[1:19:37] throw the key in it he said oh if the
[1:19:40] church only possessed the keys if the
[1:19:42] church only possessed that key of faith
[1:19:43] we could unlock any door someone say any
[1:19:46] door any sickness any plague any case
[1:19:49] any plague that includes Co I believe it
[1:19:51] any plague any any any case say well
[1:19:54] it's coming back there'll be another
[1:19:55] plague or whatever any plague if we had
[1:19:57] the key of faith we could unlock that
[1:19:59] amen said it could be unlocked to us if
[1:20:02] we could only possess this key he said
[1:20:04] this man speaking of that that African
[1:20:06] missionary he said he had the key to his
[1:20:09] calling now brother brandham spoke of
[1:20:11] his own life he said he had the key to
[1:20:13] that Divine Healing Ministry he said no
[1:20:16] one was doing it like that but he had a
[1:20:17] key why the angel met him he was there
[1:20:22] the Angel spoke to him and everything
[1:20:24] was against him and we don't realize how
[1:20:27] hard it was at the beginning because now
[1:20:29] there's a Divine healer on every every
[1:20:31] channel on TV if you go late at late
[1:20:33] enough at night at the right place right
[1:20:35] places in the country when we were in
[1:20:37] Corpus Christie if you kind of let it
[1:20:40] get late and turn on the television
[1:20:42] maybe I shouldn't admit I did that and
[1:20:43] you turn on the television you go from
[1:20:45] channel to channel it's crlo dollar or
[1:20:47] or Benny hen or and there's one on every
[1:20:50] channel they've all got
[1:20:51] healing
[1:20:53] and I begin to look at that and think
[1:20:55] boy it's today you know Baptists believe
[1:20:56] in healing they didn't back in the day
[1:20:58] that's right when brother brand come
[1:20:59] along there' been a great liberal
[1:21:01] movement had come into the church and
[1:21:03] they'd said that God don't do those
[1:21:05] things no more and and so they begin to
[1:21:08] say well it's just all social programs
[1:21:10] and things like that so when brother
[1:21:11] brandham comes in in the early 40s and
[1:21:13] then in the late 40s when he began his
[1:21:14] ministry I think in 47 it was something
[1:21:17] that people didn't do they just didn't
[1:21:19] do that and brother brandom begins his
[1:21:21] ministry and he had much position he
[1:21:23] said how are you going to face he said
[1:21:24] preachers told him how are you going to
[1:21:25] face with no denomination or nothing
[1:21:27] else to back you up what are you going
[1:21:28] to do Bill he said somehow another it
[1:21:31] didn't phas me one bit for I held in my
[1:21:33] hand a key they said nobody will believe
[1:21:36] you you won't be able to do it nobody
[1:21:37] will believe you I said I don't care
[1:21:40] there's one thing sure God called me or
[1:21:42] do we believe that tonight God called me
[1:21:44] and I must go because God called me I
[1:21:46] held the key he said he had called me he
[1:21:50] had showed me he had told me and I saw
[1:21:52] his PR presence when he commissioned me
[1:21:54] and the key was there I want to tell you
[1:21:56] today I hold the key to my salvation I
[1:21:58] was there when it happened I hold the
[1:22:00] key to my healing I was there when I
[1:22:02] read the word and he quickened it to my
[1:22:03] heart I hold the key what is it to the
[1:22:06] Salvation of my children because I
[1:22:08] believe he promised
[1:22:09] it I have the key I can see myself in
[1:22:12] the
[1:22:13] vision so brother brandom tells about
[1:22:17] thank you for for bearing with me
[1:22:18] tonight just got a few more minutes
[1:22:19] we'll close brother brandom tells about
[1:22:21] the Silver Tip Grizzly why did Brother
[1:22:24] Bram always tell that story well it's a
[1:22:25] great example of
[1:22:27] faith and you know he's he's hunting and
[1:22:32] he told Bud Southwick who was with him
[1:22:34] he said now we're going to go and we're
[1:22:35] going to come back we're going to get
[1:22:37] this uh this Caribou I believe it was
[1:22:40] and and yeah it's a 42 inch I believe
[1:22:42] Caribou he said and we're going to go he
[1:22:44] said we're going to get that we're going
[1:22:45] to pack it back out he said on the way
[1:22:46] back out we're going to see that Grizzly
[1:22:48] a silver tip Grizzly that's the way the
[1:22:50] vision was my brother brand had seen
[1:22:53] himself take the grizzly the grizzly
[1:22:57] didn't eat
[1:22:58] him right the grizzly was dead he saw
[1:23:02] himself in the vision but Bud Southwick
[1:23:05] had to rely on secondary instructions
[1:23:09] right so they get out and they they get
[1:23:13] the the caribou and they and they come
[1:23:15] back into the camp where the story
[1:23:18] brother Bisal there and all those things
[1:23:20] and you you've all heard the story but
[1:23:21] as they come back in he said they got
[1:23:24] back in they come up over the mountain
[1:23:25] he said You Could See For Miles and they
[1:23:27] had the the the glass and the the scope
[1:23:30] or whatever they were using to hunt with
[1:23:31] binoculars and they looked and and they
[1:23:33] didn't see anything and brother southw
[1:23:35] started to get nervous and they begin to
[1:23:38] come down the mountain and and he being
[1:23:41] reminded brother Brandon he said didn't
[1:23:42] didn't you say we were going to get on
[1:23:43] the way he said we're going to have to
[1:23:44] hurry because there ain't one out here
[1:23:46] and brother BR said God provided a ram
[1:23:48] for
[1:23:51] Abraham and as they were coming down
[1:23:53] brother BR said we were almost within
[1:23:54] about 500 yards of where the horses was
[1:23:56] he said we had to rest again with the
[1:23:57] heavy horns and things on our back he
[1:24:00] said he looked around again I seen his
[1:24:01] face as he looked at me as if down in
[1:24:04] his heart he was wondering oh I've seen
[1:24:06] that face
[1:24:09] before in church we wonder sometimes
[1:24:11] don't we was because we didn't see the
[1:24:13] vision somebody else saw it and somehow
[1:24:16] that has to move as there's that great
[1:24:18] Chasm between faith and doubt there's a
[1:24:19] great difference in the one who saw the
[1:24:21] vision and the one who has to believe it
[1:24:22] but somewhere you got to see yourself in
[1:24:24] the vision
[1:24:26] right so now brother brandom seeing the
[1:24:28] vision he believed it but here this man
[1:24:30] didn't see the vision he said I I saw
[1:24:32] his face as if down in his heart he was
[1:24:34] wondering see he had hoped it would be
[1:24:36] there but he didn't have the
[1:24:38] key now that's where a lot of us stop
[1:24:41] right there we hope it'll be there we
[1:24:43] hope if we go to church it'll be a great
[1:24:45] service and we'll get prayed for it
[1:24:47] everything will turn out okay but I
[1:24:48] wonder if we could ever move from that
[1:24:50] to seeing ourselves well
[1:24:53] or seeing the the Fulfillment of that
[1:24:55] promise that God made to
[1:24:56] us if we could ever see ourselves there
[1:24:59] it wouldn't matter how many years how
[1:25:00] many months how many trials how many
[1:25:02] things comeing our way you said Lord I
[1:25:04] believe help my unbelief I'm going
[1:25:06] forward I don't care if I'm all the way
[1:25:08] back down the mountain God said he would
[1:25:10] do it he'll do
[1:25:12] it and he said he was wondering but he
[1:25:15] didn't have the
[1:25:16] key he said but somehow by the grace of
[1:25:19] God he's never failed me when he told me
[1:25:22] there would be a silver tip there I had
[1:25:24] the key I didn't doubt it not one bit he
[1:25:28] said I turned to him and I said Bud
[1:25:29] it'll be there and just as I turned
[1:25:32] there was the bear standing right above
[1:25:33] us about half a mile he throw the
[1:25:36] glasses on he said Billy so help me it's
[1:25:38] a big Silver Tip see the key of vision
[1:25:40] the word of the Lord listen there's
[1:25:43] nothing can change it or stop it I hope
[1:25:46] you're listening to me I want you to
[1:25:48] just listen for a moment and we'll close
[1:25:50] but but this this is very important
[1:25:52] nothing nothing can change or stop the
[1:25:54] vision he said what the church needs
[1:25:56] tonight is not an education what the
[1:25:59] church needs tonight is not a
[1:26:00] denomination what the church needs
[1:26:02] tonight is not Creed what the church
[1:26:04] needs tonight is the key to the
[1:26:05] scriptures the door which Christ is the
[1:26:07] door and he is the word and faith in the
[1:26:10] word of the Living God unlocks every
[1:26:12] door right amen we've got to see
[1:26:15] ourselves in the vision now watch me for
[1:26:17] just a moment Elisha needed the key to
[1:26:21] the portion of Elijah's spirit in 2
[1:26:25] Kings chapter 2:9 it come to pass when
[1:26:27] they were gone over Elijah said to
[1:26:28] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[1:26:30] before I be taken away from thee and
[1:26:31] Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[1:26:33] portion of thy Spirit be upon me so it
[1:26:37] was it was a hope it was something he
[1:26:38] wish it was something he
[1:26:39] wanted but Elijah said he said thou has
[1:26:42] ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou
[1:26:45] see me when I am taken from thee it
[1:26:48] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[1:26:50] shall not be so and it came to pass as
[1:26:53] they still went on and talked and behold
[1:26:54] there appeared a chariot of fire and
[1:26:56] Horses of fire and parted them both
[1:26:58] asunder and Elijah went up by a
[1:26:59] whirlwind into heaven so Elisha knew
[1:27:02] that the promise was if he could see the
[1:27:04] vision that it oh my if he could see
[1:27:06] through a prophet's eyes and see what a
[1:27:09] prophet saw that he could actually have
[1:27:11] a double portion of that prophet's
[1:27:13] Spirit now brother brandom taught us
[1:27:15] that Elisha was a type of the Bride how
[1:27:17] many knows that that if we can see
[1:27:19] through a prophet's eyes if we can see
[1:27:22] but a prophet Saul we can actually be a
[1:27:24] partaker be a participant in the
[1:27:27] vision and so now you fast forward years
[1:27:30] later and Elisha is a prophet and gesi
[1:27:33] his servant is standing there with him
[1:27:36] and Elisha knows that God is real and
[1:27:40] and he knows something about God that
[1:27:42] God keeps his word even though he didn't
[1:27:45] see a vision maybe in this particular
[1:27:47] instance he may have but because in some
[1:27:49] places brother BR say he did and some
[1:27:50] places it he talk like he didn't but he
[1:27:52] may have seen the vision or it may have
[1:27:54] been just a Reliance on the word but
[1:27:56] elij Elisha knew God kept his word
[1:27:58] because when Elijah left he saw through
[1:28:00] a prophet's eyes right so in 2 Kings
[1:28:04] 6:15 the servant of the man of God got
[1:28:06] worried because he Lo he looked out
[1:28:09] there and the host Compass the city with
[1:28:11] horses and chariots and they come down
[1:28:13] there with one purpose to take Elijah
[1:28:15] back with them Elisha back with them is
[1:28:17] that right because remember they went
[1:28:19] down there and every time they went into
[1:28:21] is their plans were thwarted and I said
[1:28:23] what's doing it they said well there's a
[1:28:25] prophet in the land of Israel that knows
[1:28:27] what the king is saying in his bed
[1:28:29] chamber so they go down there to take
[1:28:31] out this Prophet can you imagine an army
[1:28:33] coming down to take out a prophet and
[1:28:36] his servant said to him alas my master
[1:28:38] how shall we do and he answered fear not
[1:28:41] for they that be with us are more than
[1:28:43] they that be with them and Elisha prayed
[1:28:46] and said Lord I pray the open his eyes
[1:28:50] that he may see and the Lord opened the
[1:28:51] eyes eyes of the young man and he saw
[1:28:53] and behold the mountain was full of
[1:28:54] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[1:28:57] Elisha brother brand said it this way we
[1:28:59] need to opened his eyes around that old
[1:29:01] Prophet was angels of fire and Chariots
[1:29:03] of Fire he said then there's more with
[1:29:05] us than there is with them he said and
[1:29:07] that's the dimension Now by being born
[1:29:09] he said maybe you never will see such
[1:29:11] but you believe it anyhow how many
[1:29:13] Believers we got the building tonight he
[1:29:15] said how much greater is their reward
[1:29:16] who've never seen and yet believe he
[1:29:19] said but some of us were born for that
[1:29:20] God places that in the church from baby
[1:29:22] birth he said prophets are not just put
[1:29:24] in by man it's a gift born all through
[1:29:26] the scripture born from
[1:29:28] childhood so now we could say I have not
[1:29:32] seen what he saw but I
[1:29:35] believed I have not seen what he saw but
[1:29:37] I believed now watch brother BR said
[1:29:39] gesi was a lukewarm church member he had
[1:29:42] not seen what Elijah had seen because
[1:29:45] Elijah was used to walking by faith and
[1:29:48] he was looking at the Unseen all the
[1:29:50] time and he knew that God had said in
[1:29:52] the Psalms the angels of God are
[1:29:54] encamped about those who fear Him so
[1:29:55] when he's praying open his eyes he's
[1:29:57] going by the word God said that the
[1:30:00] Angels encamp round about him so Elisha
[1:30:02] knew they were there so he didn't say
[1:30:04] Lord open my eyes he said Lord open his
[1:30:06] eyes so he can see himself in the
[1:30:09] vision amen the miracle wasn't for
[1:30:12] Elisha the Bible said these signs will
[1:30:14] follow them that believe and if you can
[1:30:16] be a believer in the word of God if you
[1:30:17] can believe that God still has Angels
[1:30:19] surrounding his people today then you
[1:30:21] can say Lord open their eyes let them
[1:30:24] have a miracle because I believe the
[1:30:26] word how many can say Amen to that
[1:30:29] tonight amen well the miracle wasn't for
[1:30:31] Elisha it was for his
[1:30:33] servant he said but gesi had halfway
[1:30:35] believed it he was just a church member
[1:30:38] so Elisha said to the Lord he said Lord
[1:30:40] God give a sign here open this man's
[1:30:42] eyes let him see what's around him hope
[1:30:44] we can only see tonight when God opened
[1:30:46] his eyes he saw horses of fire drawn by
[1:30:48] Chariots of Fire they were all around
[1:30:50] that old Prophet they were there all the
[1:30:51] time but he just didn't see them and
[1:30:53] tonight he said I'd say the same thing
[1:30:55] that the God who stood Yonder in the
[1:30:56] first chapter of the book of Acts as he
[1:30:58] was taken up the Skies come under his
[1:31:00] feet he said that same Jesus said Lo I'm
[1:31:02] with you always I will never leave you
[1:31:03] do we believe it tonight I will never
[1:31:05] leave you or forsake you the works that
[1:31:07] I do shall you do always I'll be with
[1:31:09] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:31:12] that's a promise can you see yourself in
[1:31:14] the vision can you see the Chariots of
[1:31:17] Fire angels of
[1:31:20] fire now I want say this and musicians
[1:31:23] can go ahead and
[1:31:24] come brother brandom we know he was
[1:31:27] allowed by God to go beyond the curtain
[1:31:28] of time we know Paul was he said he went
[1:31:30] into the third Heavens he wasn't even
[1:31:32] able to describe what he saw where
[1:31:35] brother brandom went he was allowed to
[1:31:36] describe it but he said it was beyond
[1:31:39] description that it just no description
[1:31:41] that could ever hold how beautiful it
[1:31:43] was and how wonderful that it was I want
[1:31:45] to go to that place don't
[1:31:47] you he was ordained to do that he he had
[1:31:50] the key to his call calling he
[1:31:54] believed but can I be honest with you
[1:31:57] about something can I just can I confess
[1:32:01] something that Vision has given me great
[1:32:05] comfort because the Bible says or
[1:32:08] brother Brandon says he he said when he
[1:32:09] went Beyond curtain of time he said
[1:32:11] there were millions that cried out were
[1:32:13] resting on
[1:32:15] that and I've always taken Comfort
[1:32:17] brother Joe if there were Millions there
[1:32:18] maybe I was one of
[1:32:20] them
[1:32:23] he said these were the converts under
[1:32:24] his ministry but I believe this message
[1:32:26] is still making converts today you're
[1:32:28] not here because of me you're here
[1:32:30] because of the
[1:32:32] message right you're not just here
[1:32:33] because well we we got a pastor no
[1:32:36] you're here because of the message of
[1:32:37] the hour that's what you that's what's
[1:32:39] kept you steady all these years amen and
[1:32:41] so under a prophet's Ministry he I've
[1:32:44] always been able to do this that I could
[1:32:46] look I could see that Vision in my mind
[1:32:48] man I could see that I could see it and
[1:32:51] and I can see those that are standing
[1:32:53] there in that crowd and he and and he
[1:32:54] said well I have to be judged like Paul
[1:32:56] was judged he said he said I I'll have
[1:32:58] to be judged in the same way if Paul he
[1:33:00] said if Paul taught Divine Healing I
[1:33:01] believe in Divine Healing he said
[1:33:03] whatever Paul taught that's what I
[1:33:05] taught and he said the millions cried
[1:33:07] out we're resting on that and I've
[1:33:10] always pictured myself in that crowd
[1:33:12] crying out saying well I'm resting on
[1:33:14] that I can see my face there I'm there I
[1:33:18] I may not have made it yet but I'm there
[1:33:20] I'm in the vision I wonder tonight if
[1:33:22] you can see yourself in The Vision by
[1:33:24] faith faith is the key that unlocks
[1:33:25] everything if you can see yourself
[1:33:28] inside that paradise if you can see
[1:33:30] yourself you said well if I go by way of
[1:33:31] the Grave well that's where you'll go if
[1:33:34] you can see yourself one of those faces
[1:33:36] they not just nameless faces they're not
[1:33:38] just Blobs of people they're
[1:33:41] individuals all those millions are
[1:33:43] individuals and I'd like to thank
[1:33:44] tonight that every one of us can see our
[1:33:46] faces right there in that crowd and we
[1:33:48] can see ourselves say Lord I didn't see
[1:33:50] the vision but I believe the vision and
[1:33:53] I can see myself in the vision and the
[1:33:56] faith has become a revelation to me that
[1:33:58] there's nothing's going to keep me back
[1:33:59] nothing's going to keep me back from my
[1:34:01] promise I believe if the Rapture happens
[1:34:03] in my generation I'll go if it doesn't
[1:34:05] happen while I'm living I'll go by way
[1:34:07] of the grave but I'll still be there the
[1:34:09] dead in Christ will rise first listen
[1:34:11] nothing can stop you when you see
[1:34:14] yourself in The Vision by faith in the
[1:34:16] word what did he tell brother brandom
[1:34:18] the angel he said he had the key to his
[1:34:19] calling he said if you can get the
[1:34:21] people to believe you
[1:34:25] nothing
[1:34:27] nothing oh we need to hear that tonight
[1:34:31] nothing can stand in the way of your
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:38] prayer faith will unlock the door and
[1:34:42] there's Miracles behind the door there's
[1:34:45] healing behind the door there's joy
[1:34:47] behind the door there's peace behind the
[1:34:50] door the door is the word and Faith
[1:34:53] unlocks the
[1:34:55] door can we believe that tonight can we
[1:34:59] just grab a hold of that say Lord I see
[1:35:01] myself there others may not have seen me
[1:35:04] there my mama may not have seen me there
[1:35:05] my daddy may not have seen me there my
[1:35:07] family men but I see my face I see
[1:35:09] myself in that crowd I believe I'm there
[1:35:14] I believe it's become almost a memory to
[1:35:16] me I know I'm there I know I'll make it
[1:35:20] because I'm resting on the same promise
[1:35:22] they were resting on that this Prophet
[1:35:24] preached what Paul preached and we
[1:35:26] believe that same word today will take
[1:35:28] us all the way home do you believe it
[1:35:30] Heen let's bow our heads together if you
[1:35:33] can get the people to believe you
[1:35:34] brother brand said you have to believe
[1:35:35] in your pastor you won't you won't
[1:35:37] accept healing you won't accept
[1:35:39] salvation he said you got to believe

[1:35:42] believe in any man that stands behind
[1:35:43] the sacred desk or he shouldn't be there
[1:35:45] if you can't believe or else you need
[1:35:47] somehow to increase your
[1:35:49] faith but I'll say this you got to
[1:35:51] believe in Jesus Christ if you can

[1:35:56] as the door to everything that you have
[1:35:57] need of you can have whatever you ask
[1:35:59] don't ever get discouraged and think

[1:36:26] find it again but he threw it away
[1:36:29] because he knew he would never need it
[1:36:31] again there was something about it he
[1:36:33] knew if he could ever get to you Lord
[1:36:35] that was the door to his healing Lord
