[39:58] touch of the Holy Spirit I pray that

[40:08] out of the way as our brother prayed
[40:09] earlier Lord that you might be able to
[40:11] speak today we ask it in Jesus name amen
[40:16] let's turn to Isaiah chapter 8 and verse
[40:18] 22 we'll continue reading chapter 9
[40:21] veres 1 and two and then in chapter 60
[40:26] of Isaiah vers 1 and
[40:28] two I want to title this this morning
[40:31] the shadow of his
[40:35] wings says and they shall look unto the
[40:38] Earth and behold trouble and darkness
[40:43] and dimness of
[40:44] Anguish and that word dimness in the
[40:47] original is is uh
[40:51] actually that word means
[40:53] Gloom
[40:55] dimness of Anguish and they shall be
[40:57] driven to Darkness isn't that the world
[41:00] that we live in
[41:01] today it says nevertheless the dimness
[41:04] shall not be such as was in her vexation
[41:06] when at the first he lightly Afflicted
[41:08] the land of zebulun and the land of
[41:11] Napal afterward did more grievously
[41:13] afflict her by way of the sea Beyond
[41:15] Jordan in Galilee of the
[41:18] Nations the people that walked in
[41:20] darkness have seen a great
[41:23] light they that dwell in the land of the
[41:25] shadow of death upon them the light
[41:28] shined and then in Isaiah 60 and
[41:31] 1 Isaiah 60 and
[41:35] verse1 arise that word is stand
[41:40] up stand up
[41:43] shine it means to be on
[41:46] fire stand up Let Your Light Shine for
[41:50] thy light is come and the glory of the
[41:53] Lord is risen upon thee for behold the
[41:57] darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[42:00] darkness and that word is the same word
[42:01] it's Gloom shall cover the people but
[42:06] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[42:09] glory shall be seen upon thee I pray the
[42:13] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[42:14] you may be seated this morning thank you
[42:18] to those of you the ministers here whove
[42:20] helped me over the last few weeks I feel
[42:22] a whole lot better today and and it's
[42:24] good to have some rest but it's good to
[42:25] be back in in the saddle
[42:28] the English word Gloom comes from the
[42:30] word Gloom or gloaming it's an old word
[42:33] that's only kept alive in poetry today
[42:35] but means the time after Sunset and
[42:38] before dark we would call it
[42:41] Twilight it's where we get the word
[42:43] Gloom it means total or partial Darkness
[42:47] dimness also means a state of melancholy
[42:50] or
[42:51] depression Low Spirits and I think we've
[42:55] all been in that state of Gloom have
[42:57] don't we at some point or another in our
[42:59] lives we've been there and it it's
[43:02] dimness and and that's what it we in the
[43:04] verse we read it was dimness translated
[43:06] dimness Gloom or gross Darkness a Gloom
[43:10] a lowering Sky a thick dark
[43:13] cloud and it's mentioned zebulun and
[43:16] Napal that's two tribes of the 12 tribes
[43:18] of Israel and if you look at a map of
[43:20] the 12 tribes but David there's uh at
[43:23] the top is zebulun and Napal or Napal at
[43:26] the top to and then zebulun and you look
[43:29] and there's the Assyrian Empire on the
[43:31] other side and the Assyrians would come
[43:34] down through those two tribes every time
[43:37] they wanted to attack Samaria or
[43:39] Jerusalem that was the way that they
[43:41] would come it was their Road and so
[43:44] Living On the Border they were always in
[43:47] a constant dread of invasion there was
[43:50] always a fear that that there was
[43:53] something coming they they could they
[43:55] could sense it that there was
[43:56] destruction coming there was a a sense
[43:59] of that destruction and isn't that like
[44:01] the country that we live in today there
[44:03] there's a sense of Destruction on the
[44:06] people there's an expectation of Doom
[44:09] and so it brings Gloom on the people it
[44:12] causes them to be in a state of
[44:14] gloominess a state of Darkness because
[44:17] they don't understand uh what it is that
[44:20] they're what's coming and and that's why
[44:22] the dark is so much scarier than the
[44:24] day because you can't see what's out
[44:27] there you don't know what's coming but
[44:30] he said during this time he said your
[44:32] light has come because you see you're
[44:36] able to see and if you're able to see
[44:38] you're able to get away from
[44:40] it right and so but the world is gloomy
[44:44] today and it's kind of a little bit of a
[44:46] gloomy day today outside in the weather
[44:49] but when it happens it it makes you feel
[44:51] a little bit gloomy and it's kind of
[44:53] that way in the world just in general
[44:56] you get around people you feel gloomy
[44:58] you begin to look at the things that are
[45:00] happening in the earth and the way
[45:01] people live it makes you gloomy if
[45:03] you're not
[45:04] careful but remember they have an
[45:07] expectation to be destroyed but that's
[45:10] not our
[45:12] expectation you see he said to those who
[45:14] lived in darkness those who lived in the
[45:16] shadow of death those who lived right in
[45:18] that line where the Assyrians would come
[45:20] in those who live maybe in this country
[45:23] where we know it's bound for Doom but he
[45:25] said they saw a great light and when
[45:28] Jesus come he went to that country and
[45:31] begin to heal the sick and begin to
[45:32] manifest the word the light to those
[45:34] people and it said that fulfill that
[45:36] scripture we'll get to that later but it
[45:39] but it talks about that and how and see
[45:41] we've lived in a time when the word has
[45:43] been manifested in our midst and we've
[45:45] seen that the Gloom has been dispelled
[45:48] but what they needed they they were
[45:49] looking for Destruction but what
[45:51] happened is Messiah came and he did not
[45:54] deliver them in a political way
[45:58] right and our deliverance today is not
[45:59] in a political sense it's not in a
[46:01] political realm we're not looking for
[46:03] deliverance from the Democrats or the
[46:05] Republicans what are we looking for
[46:06] deliverance from from our King coming
[46:09] back right and we've seen the light of
[46:11] the hour to be able to know that we're
[46:13] not looking for these other things we
[46:15] we've seen God come down and walk among
[46:19] us right now they were constantly
[46:21] expecting to be destroyed and I think
[46:24] that Spirit gets on people in the
[46:25] message sometimes
[46:27] it gets on us sometimes if we'd be
[46:29] honest about it a constant expectation
[46:32] of Destruction a constant expectation
[46:35] well there's there's hard times coming
[46:37] there's tribulation coming yes there is
[46:40] but that's not your
[46:41] message brother Brandon preaches the
[46:43] message Shalom and he talks about peace
[46:46] he said I'm going to speak to the elect
[46:47] now I'm going to speak to that group
[46:49] that's going to escape these things I'm
[46:51] not going to speak just to the world he
[46:53] said but I'm going to speak to you
[46:54] there's gross Darkness on the people but
[46:57] Rise and Shine for your light has
[47:00] come you're expecting something
[47:02] different our expectations are not of
[47:04] Doom and Gloom but our expectation is of
[47:08] of Christ returning in our midst amen
[47:11] the word being manifested where right in
[47:14] our own
[47:16] midst random says this in the breach he
[47:18] said our national spirit is frolic jokes
[47:21] he said you know why we were founded
[47:22] upon the doctrine of the Apostles we
[47:25] were founded upon leadership of great in
[47:27] like Washington and Lincoln we have
[47:29] moved off that foundation and we know
[47:31] that we've got it coming we know that an
[47:33] atomic bomb has got our name wrote on it
[47:36] we know that slavery lay lays ahead of
[47:38] us he said no need of fooling yourself
[47:41] he said It reminds me like some of these
[47:43] comedians going down and telling these
[47:45] jokes and carrying on women carrying on
[47:47] the way they do and Men together he said
[47:49] it just reminds me of a little boy going
[47:51] through the graveyard whistling trying
[47:53] to make himself believe he's not scared
[47:56] sure he's
[47:58] scared he said see he ain't fooling
[48:01] nobody that's why he's whistling he's
[48:04] trying to say that he's not scared but
[48:05] he is he said and that's what's the
[48:08] matter today but oh what a blessed hope
[48:11] for the believer that's lifting up hands
[48:14] for our Redemption is drawing nigh he
[48:17] said when he sees these things appearing
[48:20] it's a great time for the
[48:22] believer why because he doesn't have an
[48:24] expectation of Destruction has an
[48:26] expectation of
[48:29] life let me tell you that's why it's so
[48:31] important to go to the house of the Lord
[48:33] that's why it's so important we need to
[48:34] be reminded of what our expectation is
[48:37] we need to be reminded of what our hope
[48:39] is we need to be able to give an answer
[48:41] for the hope that lays within us it's
[48:43] important to be in the house of God it's
[48:44] important to hear the word of the lord
[48:46] it's important to hear the message of
[48:48] the hour and to read it and to find out
[48:50] what God said why because we know we're
[48:52] living in a time of Doom and Gloom and
[48:54] destruction and that spirit will get on
[48:56] you
[48:58] and we got and I'm not preaching at any
[48:59] of you this morning I'm preaching at me
[49:01] that spirit will get on you to where you
[49:03] feel like everything's going wrong
[49:04] everything's bad and you're constantly
[49:06] in a state of uh drama and a state of of
[49:09] trouble and a state of confusion but we
[49:12] know where we
[49:14] stand I got to reading about what
[49:17] brother said about gloomy he said it was
[49:18] a gloomy morning when the uh when the
[49:21] three Hebrew children were taken there
[49:23] to be put in the fiery furnace but they
[49:25] found out there was was an Fourth Man In
[49:27] The
[49:29] Fire amen they didn't have an
[49:31] expectation of Destruction they said our
[49:33] God is able to deliver us but even even
[49:35] if he doesn't says we're not going to
[49:37] Bow of your
[49:40] image their expectation was of
[49:42] Deliverance that's what our expectation
[49:45] has to be
[49:46] today
[49:48] amen if we go back into Genesis
[49:51] 1 we see a world
[49:54] created and then something happen
[49:56] happens now Genesis 1:1 says in the
[49:59] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[50:00] Earth
[50:02] period now something happens because
[50:06] then in verse two it says and the Earth
[50:07] was without form and void and darkness
[50:10] was upon the face of the deep the spirit
[50:13] of God moved upon the face of the
[50:16] waters notice how gloomy it must have
[50:20] been and yet the spirit of God was
[50:23] moving
[50:26] in that darkness and I want you to think
[50:29] about this some of you have been through
[50:30] some tough times but JT but in that
[50:33] Gloom there there's light the the the
[50:37] logos was
[50:39] there are you hearing me today the logos
[50:42] was there in that Gloom the word the
[50:44] Loos the Son of God moved the Holy
[50:47] Spirit moved across the face of the
[50:49] waters in in amongst that Gloom he was
[50:52] moving for some
[50:55] purpose amen
[50:57] now brother Bram says I was talking to a
[50:59] person not long ago was trying to
[51:00] discuss with me and saying aren't you
[51:01] ashamed to say that God created the
[51:03] heavens and earth in three days dur in
[51:05] six days I said that's what the Bible
[51:06] said he said well we got evidence to can
[51:09] prove the world is millions of years old
[51:11] I said that didn't have anything to do
[51:12] with it in Genesis 1:1 he said in the
[51:15] beginning God created the heavens and
[51:17] the Earth period That's all see he said
[51:19] now the world was without form and void
[51:22] and I said I believe every seed was
[51:23] laying right there from some other
[51:26] civilization or something and as soon as
[51:28] the water lifted off and the light
[51:30] Struck it up come the trees and
[51:34] everything it was there but it was in a
[51:37] gloomy
[51:38] condition and brother Brandon makes a
[51:40] statement he said I was in a gloomy
[51:43] condition until I met
[51:45] Christ why because he is the
[51:48] light without the presence of the light
[51:50] there's
[51:51] chaos now the light was the manifested
[51:55] word of God brother Bri and SS it is the
[51:57] rising of the sun he said well there was
[51:58] a time when the world was laying in
[52:00] utter Darkness it was without form and
[52:03] was void was all covered with water was
[52:05] laying there in the dark dismal gloomy
[52:10] atmosphere huh listen that's the natural
[52:14] state of people who are waiting on
[52:17] destruction and here was a world that
[52:20] somehow there had been destruction there
[52:22] was there was trouble there was
[52:25] Darkness it was
[52:27] bloomy but there was a light
[52:29] coming
[52:31] amen it be it was manifested at the time
[52:34] of the spoken word now look it was
[52:36] without form it was covered in that
[52:38] gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God
[52:40] moved upon that water and said let there
[52:41] be light he said God had a reason to do
[52:44] that for down beneath that water there
[52:46] was seeds that he had
[52:48] planted amen and it had to have that
[52:50] sunlight to make it live don't you
[52:52] realize that's what he's done in our
[52:55] hour amen
[52:57] we're not just waiting on the
[52:58] manifestation of the light but the light
[53:00] is come in our hour right Shine for your
[53:02] light has come why is it come the
[53:03] message of the Hour come be for a
[53:05] purpose why because there were seeds
[53:08] that he had planted that was in this
[53:10] gloominess in this darkness of
[53:12] denominational ages brother B said where
[53:14] they just had enough to join a church
[53:16] just enough light to be able to form a
[53:18] denomination he said but in that Gloom
[53:20] in that Darkness God began to manifest
[53:22] his light when he manifested the light
[53:25] all of a sudden all the season that had
[53:26] planed begin to
[53:28] grow it had to have the sunlight to make
[53:31] it
[53:31] live let me tell you something I you
[53:34] know there are people who will make it
[53:37] and good people and I believe this that
[53:39] will make it some perhaps even just by
[53:43] the way they treat
[53:45] you there will be people who will make
[53:47] it just that way but that's not for
[53:51] us now look we need the message of the
[53:55] hour we've heard
[53:57] heard so there's people that'll make it
[54:00] in but the Skin of Their Teeth whatever
[54:02] maybe at that raised in that that second
[54:05] Resurrection where they're you know they
[54:07] stand there at the judgment and and
[54:10] maybe some a member of the Bride will
[54:11] say something for them stand for
[54:14] them but I don't want to be
[54:17] there I I want to be in the first
[54:20] resurrection now how do I get in that
[54:22] first resurrection this sunlight that
[54:24] has come
[54:26] I can't do without the message of the
[54:29] hour as the bride I have to have it
[54:32] because it is the the manifestation of
[54:34] the word now let me tell you it's more
[54:36] than just words on a page but the
[54:39] message when it becomes material when it
[54:42] becomes a life when it really gets in
[54:45] your heart it becomes a life and when it
[54:49] does it manifest the word so you become
[54:51] the manifestation of the
[54:53] light are you with me now now
[54:57] he he said let there be light and God
[54:59] had a reason to do that Genesis 1:3 God
[55:02] said let there be light and there was
[55:03] light and God saw the light that it was
[55:04] good and God divided the light from the
[55:07] darkness God called the light day in the
[55:09] darkness he called night in the evening
[55:11] and the morning were the first
[55:12] day now that was what the word did when
[55:15] it was manifested divides light from
[55:19] darkness no Gloom in
[55:21] that right because the Gloom is that
[55:23] time when you can't tell if it's light
[55:24] or dark but it divides the light in the
[55:29] darkness now when the word was made
[55:32] flesh and I'm laying an extensive
[55:33] background to get to a simple thought
[55:35] this
[55:36] morning but when the word was made flesh
[55:39] the darkness had to
[55:41] go Matthew 4:12 when Jesus had heard
[55:44] that John was cast into prison he
[55:45] departed into Galilee leaving Nazareth
[55:47] he come and dwelt in capernium which is
[55:49] upon the Sea Coast in the borders of
[55:51] zabulon and nephalem that it might be
[55:54] fulfilled which was spoken by is the
[55:56] prophet saying the land of zebulin and
[55:58] the land of nepon by the way of the sea
[56:01] Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles
[56:03] the people which set in darkness saw
[56:04] great light to them which said in the
[56:06] region and shadow of death light is
[56:09] sprung up in the region of death in that
[56:11] place where there was an expectation of
[56:14] Darkness light sprung up from that time
[56:17] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[56:19] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[56:22] brother Rand said when he come he was
[56:23] the light of the
[56:25] day there was supposed to come a messiah
[56:27] and he came just exactly like God said
[56:28] he did would come when he did what was
[56:30] he the light of the day and it pressed
[56:33] the darkness so against
[56:35] him it pressed the darkness so against
[56:38] him the devil hated him he was
[56:40] persecuted why because he was so much
[56:43] light it pressed the
[56:46] darkness amen we talk about the darkness
[56:49] pressing us but it's actually us
[56:51] pressing the
[56:53] darkness the light presses the darkness
[56:55] now look he said he had to give his life
[56:59] that the light continue could shine he
[57:02] was the light of the day but why why was
[57:04] he the light of the day he was the
[57:06] Vindicated word that had been spoken
[57:09] made
[57:11] manifest amen God said over this dark
[57:15] gloomy dismal Mossy world that stood
[57:19] here without light he said let there be
[57:23] light amen and it wasn't light until
[57:26] that word was
[57:28] manifested and then it was
[57:32] light now this happens in every one of
[57:35] our Lives when the word begins to be
[57:36] manifested in our lives then it's light
[57:39] there darkness and gloomy and dismal and
[57:42] mosy let there be light and there's
[57:44] light
[57:45] manifested
[57:47] now he said there will come a savior a
[57:51] messiah it still wasn't manifested until
[57:53] he come to manifest that promise and
[57:54] when he Vindicated that promise
[57:56] he said search the scriptures for them
[57:58] you think you have eternal life they are
[58:00] they that testify of me and they said we
[58:03] not we know not when th comest we are
[58:04] moses' disciples he said if you were
[58:07] Moses disciples you would know me for
[58:09] Moses wrote of me see he was the
[58:11] manifestation he was the Vindication of
[58:14] the spoken word of God by
[58:19] Moses now look God spoke a word in
[58:22] Malachi 4 he said behold I sent you
[58:24] Elijah the prophet
[58:26] that word didn't become light until
[58:28] Elijah
[58:29] came right and when Elijah came then
[58:32] what do we have we have a manifestation
[58:34] of the
[58:36] word said let there be light and there
[58:39] was light there was light that's the
[58:41] manifestation let there be light it's
[58:43] the spoken word there was light that's
[58:44] the
[58:45] manifestation behold I sent you Elijah
[58:47] the Prophet Elijah the prophet
[58:49] came now Elijah the prophet said there
[58:52] will be a
[58:53] bride right he said you had a a wedding
[58:57] band of Grace slipped on you over there
[58:59] he said that you're the pure virtuous
[59:01] sinless bride of Jesus Christ the word
[59:03] was spoken when does it become light
[59:07] when it's
[59:09] manifested every time we go to church
[59:12] every time we go to the grocery store
[59:14] every time to the S we work in in the
[59:16] factory whatever it is that you do every
[59:18] time you go over the Harvey around
[59:20] people you become the manifestation of
[59:22] the light of the hour you become the
[59:25] answer to God's question or the answer
[59:27] to the to the statement that was made to
[59:29] the prophecy you become the Fulfillment
[59:31] of the prophecy when he says let there
[59:33] be light and there was light let there
[59:35] be a bride and there is a
[59:37] bride see there's got to be one and
[59:40] that's why we don't take the Doom and
[59:41] Gloom of people say well the bride's
[59:43] washed up well it was good 30 years ago
[59:45] it's not good no I don't believe that
[59:47] because if it was ever going to be a
[59:48] bride it's got to be one today he did
[59:51] not fail to produce a bride without spot
[59:53] or wrinkle but see so many times we look
[59:55] at the outside we look at the flesh we
[59:57] look at what's going on on the outside
[59:58] and we don't see but the steward that he
[1:00:00] is still produced the bride and it may
[1:00:03] not be perfect to the world but it's
[1:00:05] perfect to
[1:00:06] him amen
[1:00:10] amen you are the
[1:00:12] manifestation he was the manifestation
[1:00:14] he was the Vindication of the spoken
[1:00:15] word of God by Moses he said today that
[1:00:18] we're now living in God has come on the
[1:00:20] scene to vindicate and prove his
[1:00:22] promises so it's the light of the hour
[1:00:25] listen so we can rise and
[1:00:28] shine amen it's the light of the hour
[1:00:32] what did he say rise and shine for your
[1:00:34] light has come your light not not
[1:00:36] Wesley's light not Luther's light your
[1:00:38] light has come the people that lived in
[1:00:41] darkness saw a great light your light
[1:00:43] has come what was it the
[1:00:45] word amen the word Christ has come that
[1:00:49] same logos that was there in the
[1:00:51] darkness but one day it become
[1:00:53] light that word became alive when was
[1:00:56] revealed in our day not a man but a word
[1:00:59] that become
[1:01:00] alive amen so it's the light of the hour
[1:01:03] so we can rise and
[1:01:06] shine
[1:01:07] amen as song say rise and shine there's
[1:01:10] a new day of
[1:01:13] dawning amen the voice that you hear is
[1:01:16] your voice
[1:01:19] calling what is it rise and shine it's
[1:01:21] your turn it's your time to be made
[1:01:24] manifest and we know that we've heard
[1:01:27] that now so the word of this day
[1:01:30] manifested in you is the light that
[1:01:32] dispels the Gloom of the
[1:01:33] hour in Zechariah 14:6 it speaks of this
[1:01:36] said it shall come to pass on that day
[1:01:38] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:01:39] dark and it shall be one day which will
[1:01:41] be known to the Lord not day nor night
[1:01:43] but it shall come to pass that at
[1:01:44] evening time it shall be
[1:01:48] light he said well we're looking for
[1:01:50] that no we've seen
[1:01:52] that brother brand says watch the same
[1:01:55] son that rises in the East it's the same
[1:01:56] Sun that sets in the west Su the same
[1:01:59] holy spirit that fell on the day of
[1:02:00] Pentecost in the East he said now it's
[1:02:02] been a day it could not be called a day
[1:02:04] it's a Gloom a gloomy day rainy said you
[1:02:09] see it here in Kansas rainy
[1:02:12] gloomy wintertime darkness when it
[1:02:16] shouldn't be dark Twilight
[1:02:19] Gloom gloaming a time when it's not
[1:02:22] light or dark and you just have enough
[1:02:24] light he said we've had enough light to
[1:02:25] join Church Church do these things like
[1:02:28] to get around
[1:02:30] in listen if if this message doesn't
[1:02:33] become alive to you if you don't receive
[1:02:34] the baptism of the Holy Spirit if it
[1:02:36] don't become real to
[1:02:38] you that's where you
[1:02:40] live right you you'll live even though
[1:02:43] the light's there but if it doesn't
[1:02:44] become real and become manifested to you
[1:02:47] you'll live in that darkness in that
[1:02:49] Gloom in that evening time though he
[1:02:51] said it would be
[1:02:53] light he said and the sun would return
[1:02:55] again
[1:02:56] he said and the Holy Spirit returning in
[1:02:58] this last days with the fullness again
[1:02:59] of God's power he said the word made
[1:03:03] manifest the word being made manifest
[1:03:06] now we know that happened in a prophet
[1:03:08] but it happens in The Bride it has to
[1:03:10] brother Brown said we become light of
[1:03:12] the air now in this
[1:03:14] time the understanding of the people of
[1:03:17] the world is darkened we know that you
[1:03:20] know when it's dark you can't get around
[1:03:21] very
[1:03:22] well I like to sleep in the dark I don't
[1:03:25] like to walk around in
[1:03:28] it right now I like it to be dark when I
[1:03:32] sleep I had a brother older brother and
[1:03:34] we had a a chair to room and and uh Sam
[1:03:37] always wanted the dart or the light on
[1:03:39] and I always wanted it off so we for for
[1:03:42] several years we fought about that every
[1:03:44] night he'd turn it on I'd turn it off
[1:03:46] he'd turn it on I'd turn it off he'd
[1:03:49] wake up and it was dark and he'd get up
[1:03:50] and turn back
[1:03:52] on but I don't like walking around in
[1:03:54] the dark if you got to get up and and
[1:03:57] and your wife's rearranged the furniture
[1:03:59] you're going to stub your toe in the
[1:04:02] dark why because the dark there there's
[1:04:05] no Revelation in the
[1:04:07] dark right it's hard to get around in
[1:04:09] that that's where people live just
[1:04:11] enough light to join Church enough light
[1:04:13] to to do that but not enough light to
[1:04:15] actually make it live make it real but
[1:04:18] there's one day but the PA that word
[1:04:20] becomes alive you begin to realize this
[1:04:22] is for me
[1:04:26] amen and when that light comes all of a
[1:04:28] sudden the the things you couldn't have
[1:04:30] lived through before you find yourself
[1:04:32] making it
[1:04:33] through all of a sudden it don't seem
[1:04:36] like it's so
[1:04:37] gloomy why you go through the same
[1:04:40] things you have the same troubles you
[1:04:42] have the same trials the world does but
[1:04:45] there's something inside of you
[1:04:47] something that keeps holding you
[1:04:48] something that keeps working in you what
[1:04:51] is it you're becoming the manifested
[1:04:52] word of the hour but the world out here
[1:04:55] is darkened to
[1:04:57] that now Ephesians 4:17 he said this I
[1:05:00] say therefore and testify in the Lord
[1:05:01] that you henceforth walk not as other
[1:05:03] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[1:05:05] mind now you look in that darkness and
[1:05:09] Chaos in the beginning the word of God
[1:05:11] couldn't take
[1:05:12] shape or form so we didn't know what a
[1:05:16] family looked
[1:05:18] like
[1:05:19] right because it was just seeds laying
[1:05:22] out there we didn't know what a lion
[1:05:25] would look like or tiger even what light
[1:05:27] would look
[1:05:29] like there just nothing there but it was
[1:05:32] in God's mind now God has a very
[1:05:35] specific way and we call them the laws
[1:05:36] of God it's just like the law of gravity
[1:05:40] that's a law of God a natural
[1:05:42] law right God created it and if you pick
[1:05:45] something up it's going to fall because
[1:05:47] it's the law of gravity or certain laws
[1:05:50] that are things that are
[1:05:51] true right we live in a world that's
[1:05:54] been influenced by something called post
[1:05:56] postmodernism which means that they
[1:05:58] believe that there's nothing that you
[1:05:59] can really say is true everything is
[1:06:02] relative there's no no nothing better
[1:06:05] than something
[1:06:06] else well there's a reason why we put
[1:06:09] benches on the ground not hung up in the
[1:06:14] air right because you can't just float
[1:06:17] up to them there's a law holding you
[1:06:22] down you rely on that law all the time
[1:06:26] there's a law that says that if you get
[1:06:27] in your car if you turn the key a
[1:06:30] certain thing happens an electrical
[1:06:32] charge goes somewhere and certain
[1:06:34] Pistons do a certain thing and and they
[1:06:36] figured out how to make that law work to
[1:06:38] move a car down the road they didn't
[1:06:41] create that they're just harnessing the
[1:06:44] laws of
[1:06:45] God right this electricity was already
[1:06:47] in in the atmosphere but they harness
[1:06:49] that and made
[1:06:51] light right even when it's gloomy
[1:06:53] outside and so those are IM mutable laws
[1:06:56] of God we live in a in a time when the
[1:07:00] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[1:07:01] mind in other words they just make it
[1:07:03] up they imagine it well you don't have
[1:07:07] to be married to a
[1:07:09] woman you can marry who whatever you
[1:07:13] want well it's against the laws of God
[1:07:16] number one it don't
[1:07:18] work you can't have
[1:07:21] children
[1:07:23] right it's impossible
[1:07:26] you you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:07:28] impossible for it to work you said well
[1:07:31] we'll just make a society where
[1:07:32] everybody loves everybody you can do
[1:07:33] whatever you want no it don't work like
[1:07:36] that right because it's in the vanity of
[1:07:39] their mind it says having the
[1:07:41] understanding
[1:07:42] darkened the understanding the ability
[1:07:45] to even see the laws of God and how they
[1:07:48] operate and so it's a world that's so
[1:07:50] Twisted that it makes you
[1:07:52] look like you're strange
[1:07:57] right and you've even got family some of
[1:07:59] you have been around family this week
[1:08:01] you got family who make fun of you for
[1:08:02] being a Christian who mocked you because
[1:08:05] you don't want to listen to that you
[1:08:06] don't want to hear that you don't want
[1:08:07] to see that you don't want to dress like
[1:08:10] that and and there's people that will do
[1:08:13] that and in the world there's people I
[1:08:15] don't know how many times my wife has
[1:08:16] been maybe to a yard cell or something
[1:08:18] and some lady will sit there and usually
[1:08:20] an older lady will sit there and say
[1:08:23] well why don't you just cut that hair
[1:08:25] off it's too
[1:08:27] hot it just bothers
[1:08:31] them why but it's the way it's supposed
[1:08:33] to
[1:08:34] be right but it's odd to the world
[1:08:36] because their understanding is darkened
[1:08:39] they're living in that sense that chaos
[1:08:41] they're living in that Darkness being
[1:08:44] alienated from the life of God through
[1:08:46] the ignorance that is in
[1:08:50] them Paul said it this way in Romans he
[1:08:52] said professing to be wise they become
[1:08:54] fools
[1:08:57] and they're educated
[1:08:59] idiots educated ignor animus but they're
[1:09:02] still ignoramuses that's a
[1:09:05] word they're still ignorant right
[1:09:08] because of the blindness of their hearts
[1:09:10] they don't feel bad about that and and
[1:09:11] brother random in Shalom he says
[1:09:13] something that really struck me he said
[1:09:15] you know he said I don't he said I used
[1:09:16] to feel bad about those people he said
[1:09:18] but I realize they're in darkness he
[1:09:20] said they don't know any
[1:09:22] better but thank God for the light
[1:09:25] he said through the ignorance that is in
[1:09:26] them because of the blindness of their
[1:09:29] heart don't you see that and and see
[1:09:31] people young people grow up in the
[1:09:32] message and say well if I just had if I
[1:09:34] could just go and that Satan tells you
[1:09:36] the same lie he does Eve if I could just
[1:09:38] go in the world and experience those
[1:09:39] things I would have more
[1:09:41] light I'd be happier I would be less
[1:09:44] gloomy and not realizing that it
[1:09:46] actually is what brings
[1:09:51] Darkness who being now look past feeling
[1:09:55] other words God can't even touch them
[1:09:57] anymore they can't be affected by what
[1:10:01] they're doing they have no conscience
[1:10:03] being past feeling have given themselves
[1:10:06] over unto
[1:10:08] lusciousness to work all uncleanness
[1:10:10] with
[1:10:14] greediness brandom uses the example of
[1:10:16] people not knowing what gender they
[1:10:18] belong to and Shalom he said I've
[1:10:20] noticed amongst men he said look out on
[1:10:22] the streets and he said most amongst the
[1:10:24] women watch their desires what they like
[1:10:26] to
[1:10:27] do he said and they're changing
[1:10:29] attitudes all the
[1:10:31] time
[1:10:33] amen men are becoming more like women
[1:10:36] women are becoming more like men and it
[1:10:37] seems like there's no way to stop it he
[1:10:40] said I cross a nation preaching against
[1:10:41] the thing come back the next year and
[1:10:42] it's worse than it was when I started he
[1:10:45] said it's then people want to do right
[1:10:47] but there's something about it won't let
[1:10:49] them do right he said it just presses
[1:10:52] down on them forces them it's like a
[1:10:55] heavy dark fog over the whole earth he
[1:10:57] said not only in Phoenix but all over
[1:10:59] the world there seems to be just a
[1:11:01] grouping Darkness that's Gathering
[1:11:03] getting more dense and dense all the
[1:11:05] time just smothering out real manhood
[1:11:09] real
[1:11:13] Womanhood we've seen that grow up and
[1:11:15] become
[1:11:16] mature where now they allow a man to
[1:11:19] marry a
[1:11:20] man woman to marry a
[1:11:23] woman there's no hope for this country
[1:11:25] for this world Darkness on every
[1:11:27] side he said but arise and shine for
[1:11:29] your light has
[1:11:31] come he said Shalom to the bride for the
[1:11:34] elect there is
[1:11:36] peace you say well I love this he said
[1:11:39] you say well I just tell you brother
[1:11:40] bandam I can't look
[1:11:42] ahead you ever felt like that I can't
[1:11:45] see anything ahead that's going to be
[1:11:48] good you see baby's born Victoria Jane I
[1:11:51] got that name right three times this
[1:11:53] morning

[1:11:58] born into a world of
[1:11:59] Darkness you look at that you begin to
[1:12:01] look at what's going on you think I
[1:12:04] don't know if we can make it I don't
[1:12:05] know what kind of world to be raised in
[1:12:06] it's
[1:12:07] discouraging you can't look ahead he
[1:12:10] said then look
[1:12:12] up
[1:12:13] amen the promise for your children
[1:12:16] didn't go away because of the
[1:12:18] darkness are you hearing me this morning

[1:12:23] promised if you look up see him
[1:12:26] amen you said if I could just see a
[1:12:28] bunch of people in the church if I could
[1:12:30] just see a pastor if I could just no
[1:12:31] don't look at that look up God promised
[1:12:34] if you look up and see him Shalom peace
[1:12:37] God's peace rests
[1:12:39] you amen but this gloominess this
[1:12:43] constant gloominess on the nation on the
[1:12:45] world affects us just like we're
[1:12:47] affected by the weather outside we feel
[1:12:49] the spirit of gloominess caused by the
[1:12:52] deformity of Satan's
[1:12:53] Eden gloomy that Darkness Brandon
[1:12:57] ministered to people affected by this I
[1:12:59] want to talk about it in the natural for
[1:13:00] just a
[1:13:02] moment in 1950 the R's in a prayer line
[1:13:06] he talks to a man then we'll talk about
[1:13:08] a woman as well he spoke to he said but
[1:13:11] he said Do You Believe Me Brother he
[1:13:13] said you believe it will you obey me as
[1:13:14] this servant now he said you want to be
[1:13:17] healthy have all that weary and gloomy
[1:13:20] and crazy feeling like you're losing
[1:13:22] your mind things like that
[1:13:26] he said no I tell you where that started
[1:13:27] on the prostate now we could get very
[1:13:31] involved in this but I just tell you
[1:13:33] that if you've had something traumatic
[1:13:34] in your life especially
[1:13:37] sickness or a loss of someone that you
[1:13:39] love it can
[1:13:40] produce a feeling of
[1:13:44] gloominess can produce a a crazy
[1:13:47] feeling that's
[1:13:49] natural you you take a woman after she's
[1:13:52] had a baby she kind of gets that a
[1:13:53] little bit it's just natural or
[1:13:55] something in their body you take a woman
[1:13:56] that's lost a
[1:13:58] baby how much more gloomy feeling a
[1:14:02] crazy feeling like you're losing your
[1:14:05] mind and that's why sometimes I don't
[1:14:08] know why I'm talking about this this
[1:14:09] morning but you just bear with me a
[1:14:12] woman brother BR talked about the
[1:14:13] adopted baby route he said that if if
[1:14:16] you would adopt a baby he said you let a
[1:14:18] woman adopt a baby that can't have one
[1:14:20] after a while she'll have
[1:14:22] one because there's something about it
[1:14:24] that them and calms them and plus
[1:14:26] they're busy taking care of the
[1:14:29] baby right and so he said you get that
[1:14:31] gloomy crazy feeling usually that stems
[1:14:33] from something with this man was
[1:14:34] prostate
[1:14:35] trouble but yet what it did it didn't
[1:14:38] create it it but it made it those things
[1:14:40] that he'd always been dealing with maybe
[1:14:41] it always dealt with depression
[1:14:44] gloominess but it made it
[1:14:46] worse right it just things bad that
[1:14:49] happened to you make you more the way
[1:14:50] you
[1:14:51] are not
[1:14:53] less right it brings out more of what
[1:14:56] you
[1:14:57] are good and bad things many
[1:14:59] times and so when you get gloomy and you
[1:15:03] begin to feel like that and you get
[1:15:05] certain things that run in families and
[1:15:07] I'll say that for my family not I got
[1:15:10] several family members here this morning
[1:15:11] but we get that we we struggle with
[1:15:14] depression just my dad did and and going
[1:15:16] back but if there's something that
[1:15:18] happens then traumatic in your life it
[1:15:20] just makes that that much
[1:15:22] worse and and then it just keeps going
[1:15:24] down H but brother Brandman I'm not
[1:15:27] reading this whole quote you can go back
[1:15:28] and read it he deals with this man at
[1:15:30] length he said but what really is doing
[1:15:32] it it's a
[1:15:34] demon he said it haunts you he said
[1:15:36] isn't that right you have no peace at
[1:15:37] all day and night it's after you seems
[1:15:40] like you just skip gloomy feelings in
[1:15:42] there is that right yes they're weary
[1:15:43] don't sleep nervous getting up at
[1:15:48] night brother BR prays for the man he
[1:15:50] tells him about an incident in his teens
[1:15:52] that happened and then he tells him
[1:15:54] about something he tells him off the mic
[1:15:56] and he tells him something about when he
[1:15:58] was a child he said when you was a child
[1:16:00] a little boy with knee pants on you've
[1:16:01] got problems with something he said I
[1:16:03] believe it's a dog that chased
[1:16:05] you a big dog he said you run to a
[1:16:10] porch you think God didn't speak in our
[1:16:13] day all the videos on the internet they
[1:16:15] don't deal with stuff like
[1:16:18] this they get on there and say oh
[1:16:19] brother Bron missed it here and he
[1:16:20] missed it there and they can't prove
[1:16:22] anything but what they try to do is make
[1:16:23] you doubt
[1:16:26] huh but but they don't go to stuff like
[1:16:28] this because you know well brother
[1:16:30] brandham someone even say brother
[1:16:31] brandham was a prophet well why would
[1:16:33] God call the the gift the ministry that
[1:16:35] was unique to him since as far as we
[1:16:39] know since the time of Christ that that
[1:16:41] had not come on a man and God called him
[1:16:44] and he was
[1:16:45] false it doesn't make any
[1:16:47] sense even the reasonable explanation is
[1:16:49] that God must have had something to
[1:16:52] say right he said I believe in it's a
[1:16:55] dog that chased you or something a big
[1:16:56] dog you run to a porch that's right I
[1:16:58] see it as a little boy is that the truth
[1:17:00] he said now he goes on he said now look
[1:17:03] here sir it's gone now you're free you
[1:17:06] go out of here testifying you feel all
[1:17:09] right now fine wonderful he said that's
[1:17:11] go out of here rejoicing testifying he
[1:17:13] said now if I could tell you what
[1:17:15] happened to you when you was a little
[1:17:16] boy down to the age down to where you
[1:17:18] are right now the life that you live the
[1:17:21] things that you've done that was true
[1:17:22] wasn't it every word true he said now I
[1:17:25] will tell you what will be the results
[1:17:28] in the coming
[1:17:30] future
[1:17:33] amen but now listen the the results
[1:17:36] hinged on his
[1:17:40] faith right it hinged on his ability to
[1:17:44] shake
[1:17:45] that but the thing is he had the ability
[1:17:47] to shake it but the light needed to be
[1:17:50] shined on it are you hearing me now
[1:17:53] because the light dispelled the
[1:17:55] Gloom amen you want to quit being gloomy
[1:17:59] look into the word of God we get to look
[1:18:01] at the word and we get to see what the
[1:18:02] word says I can't tell you I can say
[1:18:05] shake it off go you can't tell somebody
[1:18:07] that because you don't know what they've
[1:18:09] been
[1:18:10] through you can't feel what they're
[1:18:11] feeling but if you look at the word of
[1:18:13] God the word of God is always true and
[1:18:16] it's a seed that'll produce something in
[1:18:17] your life it'll manifest in your life
[1:18:20] and here the word of God is the
[1:18:22] discerner of the thoughts and tense of
[1:18:24] the heart it says I will tell you what
[1:18:25] would be the results in the coming
[1:18:26] future go out of here happy singing
[1:18:29] testifying telling people God healed
[1:18:34] you how many of us are prayed for like
[1:18:39] that because it's always
[1:18:43] true right brother Bram was say you're
[1:18:45] healed you're healed what he said I was
[1:18:46] just telling him what the word
[1:18:49] says some of them may have left the
[1:18:51] platform and died brother Brown says
[1:18:53] you're healed because that's what the
[1:18:54] word says
[1:18:56] by Stripes I'm Healed so when I come to
[1:18:58] be prayed for I don't leave and say well
[1:19:00] I wish I'd had been healed while I was
[1:19:02] up there you already
[1:19:04] healed right you come and and stood
[1:19:06] according to the word of God the prayer
[1:19:07] of faith shall save the sick you believe
[1:19:08] that and you leave rejoicing happy
[1:19:11] testifying telling people God healed you
[1:19:13] he said you he said forget you ever was
[1:19:17] nervous amen amen 30 days from
[1:19:21] now I love this this isn't just just
[1:19:25] positive thinking but it's actually
[1:19:27] something that works according to the
[1:19:29] law of God and in that light you can see
[1:19:32] a tree right in that light you can see
[1:19:35] that the seeds are becoming what they
[1:19:36] are in that light you can see what the
[1:19:39] holy spirit is doing but as long as that
[1:19:42] Gloom is there you can't see nothing but
[1:19:44] when you begin to look at it by the
[1:19:46] Light of the word I'm already healed I'm
[1:19:48] already I'm already saved God's already
[1:19:50] he's elected me to be a part of his
[1:19:51] bride when you begin to see things
[1:19:53] according to the light of the word
[1:19:54] there's no Gloom that can stand against
[1:19:56] that
[1:19:58] light forget you ever was nervous 30
[1:20:01] days from now you will be a different
[1:20:03] man alt
[1:20:07] together see Darkness spreads Gloom
[1:20:09] spreads but so does
[1:20:11] light brother R was asked a question
[1:20:13] about a lady who has a dream you all
[1:20:15] know the the the where I'm referencing
[1:20:17] in questions and answers she's lost in
[1:20:19] White
[1:20:20] Sands dream troubles her and she thinks
[1:20:22] she's lost because of the dream
[1:20:25] and the dream was actually God telling
[1:20:27] her she was
[1:20:30] fine
[1:20:31] huh and brother BR said I don't know the
[1:20:34] lady but I just feel if you're here lady
[1:20:35] that here is your trouble you've let
[1:20:37] something happen to you that's made you
[1:20:39] nervous because being in White Sands
[1:20:42] represents Purity and
[1:20:44] righteous and you're just letting Satan
[1:20:46] put one over on you your dream proved
[1:20:49] that there's nothing wrong you're only
[1:20:52] nervous and see when when you're in in
[1:20:54] that condition when you're in that
[1:20:55] gloominess everything looks like
[1:20:57] something is
[1:21:00] wrong he said you're only nervous and by
[1:21:02] doing this and thinking this you're
[1:21:03] making the rest of your family nervous
[1:21:05] stop doing it claim your god-given
[1:21:09] rights amen you may have been through
[1:21:11] hell and back but you've got
[1:21:13] rights huh you may have been sick but
[1:21:16] the problem but you've got rights you
[1:21:17] can claim those
[1:21:20] rights you can claim those rights I have
[1:21:24] a right to be healthy I have a right to
[1:21:25] be happy I have a right to live
[1:21:27] according to God I wasn't born brother
[1:21:29] brother said you were not born to be
[1:21:31] miserable you were born to be happy and
[1:21:35] free he said you stop doing it claim
[1:21:37] your god-given rights you have rights
[1:21:39] you say well I'm just a a little
[1:21:40] insignificant person you have
[1:21:44] rights some people in Boston one day
[1:21:46] woke up about 250 years ago however long
[1:21:48] it's been they woke up one day and
[1:21:50] realized I got some rights I don't have
[1:21:54] to live under this taxation I don't have
[1:21:56] to live under this with no
[1:21:58] representation at all I don't have to
[1:21:59] live under this I've got a
[1:22:01] right and then so they wrote a document
[1:22:04] called the Declaration of Independence
[1:22:05] that said we've been created with
[1:22:06] certain inalienable rights it's about
[1:22:09] time the people of God realize they've
[1:22:10] got
[1:22:12] rights not a right to live like the
[1:22:14] world and do things like that but a
[1:22:15] right to live for God and a right to be
[1:22:18] happy and a right to claim every promise
[1:22:20] of
[1:22:21] God are you with me now you have God
[1:22:24] given
[1:22:26] rights brother BR said your dream proves
[1:22:28] by the interpretation that you're in
[1:22:30] white sand everything's all right it's
[1:22:33] you yourself
[1:22:34] nervous he said you let one member of
[1:22:36] the family get nervous it goes to the
[1:22:38] next member and the next member and the
[1:22:39] first thing you're all fusting and going
[1:22:40] on one member of the family gets kind of
[1:22:42] upset about something it upsets the
[1:22:44] other and the other and the other first
[1:22:46] thing you know the whole family is
[1:22:50] upset it's hard to enjoy that turkey
[1:22:52] when everybody's upset
[1:22:57] now that didn't happen at our
[1:22:58] Thanksgiving so I'm
[1:23:00] not I enjoyed my
[1:23:06] turkey but brother BR said it's
[1:23:08] Satan he said then if one member of the
[1:23:10] family rejoices I love this let the rest
[1:23:13] of them Rejoice with it he said so every
[1:23:16] one of the family try to do that he said
[1:23:18] try each one of you children to help
[1:23:21] your papa mama mama you papa you try to
[1:23:24] help the children don't let that gloomy
[1:23:26] unbelieving Spirit get around you you
[1:23:30] are Christians you are born to the
[1:23:32] spirit of God you're the salt of the
[1:23:35] earth you have god-given
[1:23:38] rights amen am man you're you're in
[1:23:41] White Sands you you've been made pure by
[1:23:43] the blood of Jesus Christ don't let the
[1:23:45] devil tell you of course he's going to
[1:23:46] tell you you're not going to make it
[1:23:48] what do you think he's going to tell
[1:23:50] you of course he's going to tell you
[1:23:52] that you're no good of course he's going
[1:23:54] to tell you to be gloomy of course he
[1:23:56] wants you to not let the light shine
[1:23:57] through your life of course he wants you
[1:23:59] to be that way but you don't have to be
[1:24:01] that way you have rights you're the salt
[1:24:04] of the earth you have god-given rights
[1:24:06] and the Bible said if there be any
[1:24:08] praise if there be any virtue think on
[1:24:10] these things don't think about the wrong
[1:24:13] thing he said and sister I think that's
[1:24:16] your
[1:24:19] trouble each one of us men and women
[1:24:21] could benefit from thinking about the
[1:24:23] right things
[1:24:26] brother BR preached Shalom he read two
[1:24:29] scriptures he read Isaiah 61 and2 and he
[1:24:32] read Psalm
[1:24:33] 62 1-8 which doesn't seem to really
[1:24:36] connect I'll get to my sermon after a
[1:24:45] while and and it says this it says truly
[1:24:47] my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh
[1:24:50] my
[1:24:51] salvation he only is my rock and my
[1:24:53] salvation he is my
[1:24:55] defense I shall not be greatly
[1:24:58] moved he said how long will you imagine
[1:25:00] Mischief against a man you should be
[1:25:03] slain all of you as a bowling bowling I
[1:25:06] said a bowling ball a Boeing
[1:25:11] wall that if that was true that would be
[1:25:13] quite a prophecy for me a bowling ball
[1:25:15] shall you
[1:25:18] be you can relax in church it's
[1:25:22] okay a bowling wall shall you be and a
[1:25:27] boing wall shall you
[1:25:30] be a Boeing
[1:25:33] wall one has fallen
[1:25:36] down a tottering
[1:25:38] fence go that next
[1:25:40] verse they only consult to cast him down
[1:25:43] from his Excellency he speaking of these
[1:25:45] these out here in darkness they Delight
[1:25:46] in lies they bless with their mouth but
[1:25:48] they curse inwardly the next verse my
[1:25:51] soul wait thou only upon God for my my
[1:25:54] expectation is from
[1:25:56] himen remember they were expecting
[1:25:58] judgment but my expectation is from God
[1:26:01] he only Is My Rock Amen and my salvation
[1:26:05] he is my defense I shall not be
[1:26:08] moved I don't have I got a right to stay
[1:26:11] here I've got a right see David when he
[1:26:14] went to Jerusalem he realized that was
[1:26:16] that was going to be David's City he had
[1:26:17] a right to that land Joshua had given
[1:26:20] them that land but the jebusites had
[1:26:21] built a defense there a strong tower and
[1:26:24] what did David do he didn't sit there
[1:26:26] and say well it's too strong we can't do
[1:26:27] it he said let me find a man that can
[1:26:29] figure out how to get in because we know
[1:26:31] it's
[1:26:32] ours and so they found a way to get in
[1:26:35] and they and they tore down the city
[1:26:36] what does the New Testament say casting
[1:26:38] down
[1:26:39] imaginations every stronghold of the
[1:26:42] enemy everything every High thing that
[1:26:43] would exalt itself against the the the
[1:26:45] word of God what is it he is the rock of
[1:26:48] my strength my refuge is in God I have a
[1:26:51] right to to be here a right to
[1:26:55] stand he
[1:26:57] says in God is my salvation and my
[1:27:02] glory and he says he only is my rock and
[1:27:06] my salvation he is my defense I shall
[1:27:07] not be moved and God is my salvation my
[1:27:09] glory Rock of my strength and my refuge
[1:27:11] is in God trust in him at all times you
[1:27:15] people pour out your heart before him
[1:27:18] God is a refuge for us a
[1:27:22] refuge now
[1:27:25] the idea is that during this time of
[1:27:27] Darkness we're
[1:27:29] protected he's preaching Shalom peace
[1:27:32] your light has come and this Psalm was
[1:27:35] actually when David is
[1:27:38] waiting he's waiting there to be uh in
[1:27:41] the cave to be for Saul to come and get
[1:27:43] him Saul's after him but he said trust
[1:27:46] in him at all times you people pour out
[1:27:49] your heart before him David didn't
[1:27:52] anticipate destruction but life
[1:27:56] the Gloom for you is not the coming
[1:27:59] Darkness but the coming
[1:28:01] light are you hear me this morning it's
[1:28:03] the coming light but the Brom says this
[1:28:06] he said and and watch this real closely
[1:28:09] he said you might have lost your health
[1:28:11] you might have lost your
[1:28:13] fellowship he said but take him at his
[1:28:16] word amen be certain that he's God the
[1:28:20] gloomy times that's looking now may not
[1:28:23] look so Gloom bloy if you'll just take
[1:28:25] his word and be certain that he's
[1:28:30] God and he goes and gives us this
[1:28:32] illustration he said in Germany once I
[1:28:34] saw a picture and always stuck with me a
[1:28:36] German painter has painted a picture
[1:28:38] that's called the Cloudland when you see
[1:28:41] it off at a distance it's the horriblest
[1:28:43] looking Gloom you ever seen just clouds
[1:28:47] matted together when you're looking at
[1:28:49] it from a long distance but when you get
[1:28:51] real close to it it changes
[1:28:54] it's angel's wings beating together
[1:28:59] singing Hallelujah to the Lord he said
[1:29:02] so that's what Gloom is
[1:29:06] sometimes if you look at it a long
[1:29:09] distance it looks gloomy and dark but
[1:29:12] take God at his word and be certain that
[1:29:16] he's God and listen and move up close to
[1:29:19] it don't be scared of it move up close
[1:29:23] to it you'll find out it's just Angels
[1:29:26] Wings beating
[1:29:29] together I got to studying on this
[1:29:32] yesterday and I and I was trying to find
[1:29:34] the Hebrew word for
[1:29:35] gloom and it's that word dimness that we
[1:29:38] read in the first scripture dimness it
[1:29:41] it's translated several other ways but
[1:29:43] the same Hebrew word for gloom is also
[1:29:46] angel's
[1:29:48] wings it's the same
[1:29:51] word and the reason is because in the in
[1:29:54] the Hebrew language it doesn't see a
[1:29:57] distinction because it's the Gloom cast
[1:29:59] by being under the shadow of
[1:30:05] wings I hope you hear me today I just
[1:30:08] blessed my heart I thought God here's a
[1:30:10] prophet telling us that if we just get
[1:30:12] up close to it we'd see that those wings
[1:30:15] are are just Angels Wings it looks like
[1:30:18] clouds but it's just Angels wings and
[1:30:19] here in the Hebrew it means the same
[1:30:21] thing the cloudiness the Gloom the
[1:30:24] darkness is comes but you're protected
[1:30:27] in that see you may not be able to see
[1:30:31] down the road a long ways it looks
[1:30:32] gloomy and dark but take God at his word
[1:30:35] be certain that he's God you're
[1:30:39] protected so you see the gloominess that
[1:30:42] covers the earth don't you see that's
[1:30:43] why the Holy Spirit was moving on the
[1:30:45] face of the waters and it was still dark
[1:30:47] but he said let there be light and there
[1:30:50] was like but what was he doing in the
[1:30:51] dark protecting the seed
[1:30:56] brooding over the
[1:30:57] seed so in the Hebrew they they don't
[1:31:00] take wings as being just for flight but
[1:31:04] the primary purpose of wings and you
[1:31:07] look at birds being in the desert the
[1:31:09] primary purpose is protection for their
[1:31:12] young and so they looked at Angels when
[1:31:14] they talk about the sarpam and the
[1:31:15] cheram having wings the primary purpose
[1:31:18] of those wings was not to fly but the
[1:31:20] primary purpose was protection
[1:31:25] amen remember he had six wings you only
[1:31:27] used two of them to fly but the primary
[1:31:30] purpose of the Wings was protection
[1:31:32] where are the wings the chair and wings
[1:31:33] is Over The Mercy Seat the wings cover
[1:31:36] it's the
[1:31:37] covering amen amen it covers over The
[1:31:40] Mercy Seat
[1:31:43] Hallelujah in there you have the
[1:31:44] covering of his wings and brother Bram
[1:31:46] talks about that Gloom he said if you're
[1:31:47] on the outside he said you're Justified
[1:31:50] he said you're in that outer Court he
[1:31:52] said you're Justified but you're subject
[1:31:54] to the weather he said if it's gloomy
[1:31:56] you're
[1:31:58] gloomy if it's gloomy you're gloomy
[1:32:01] because it's just you're subject to that
[1:32:03] but if you could ever get inside the
[1:32:04] holy of holies on the insides where
[1:32:07] those wings are covering where that
[1:32:08] presence covers the the mercy see what
[1:32:10] happens in there there's always
[1:32:18] light it's
[1:32:21] protection and so that same word when it
[1:32:23] says in the beginning when it talks
[1:32:25] about that the holy spirit moves that
[1:32:28] word moves is the word for brooding or
[1:32:31] hovering or fluttering then and and
[1:32:35] Moses uses it in Deuteronomy where he
[1:32:37] says as a hin stirreth her nest stirreth
[1:32:41] flutter over her
[1:32:43] young what is that that that's the same
[1:32:46] word
[1:32:47] brooding
[1:32:49] covering it looks gloomy but it's
[1:32:52] covering it's prot
[1:32:54] protection you see the world has to be
[1:32:56] the way that it
[1:32:58] is amen and while we're here yes we'll
[1:33:02] fly one day but while we're here we have
[1:33:06] to be
[1:33:07] protected and the things that you think
[1:33:09] in your life are gloomy are actually
[1:33:11] given you for your
[1:33:15] protection it looks like Gloom but it's
[1:33:18] actually his
[1:33:21] wings amen and he Broods over the
[1:33:25] darkness don't you see you go through
[1:33:27] times of Darkness yes you we've seen the
[1:33:28] light yes we have a message but there's
[1:33:30] times of darkness in your life sure
[1:33:32] there is there's times when you can't
[1:33:34] see a way out there's times when you're
[1:33:36] so sick that you can't see yourself well
[1:33:38] there's times when you're so hurt that
[1:33:40] you can't see yourself Ever Getting to a
[1:33:42] place of happiness again but remember
[1:33:45] it's during that time when those wings
[1:33:47] are overshadowing it's during that time
[1:33:49] you're still under the shelter of his
[1:33:51] wings
[1:33:54] it's angel's wings beating together it's
[1:33:56] the wings of God beating together it's
[1:33:58] not just
[1:34:00] Gloom the darkness is just another sign
[1:34:04] of his
[1:34:07] protection David says again when he fled
[1:34:10] from Saul in the cave in Psalm 57 he
[1:34:12] said be merciful unto me oh God be
[1:34:15] merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in
[1:34:19] thee yay in the shadow of thy Wings will
[1:34:23] I make my Refuge until these calamities
[1:34:26] be
[1:34:27] overpassed it's easy to tell somebody to
[1:34:29] get over it remember you've got
[1:34:32] Wings to protect
[1:34:35] you the darkness the
[1:34:37] gloominess it's just him protecting his
[1:34:41] children for the brandom tells us the
[1:34:43] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:34:44] signs of God's
[1:34:46] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[1:34:48] still water signs of his approval or his
[1:34:51] love but his approval of any of us is
[1:34:53] only in the Beloved his love is
[1:34:57] elective
[1:34:58] Amen brother B says the hour is pressing
[1:35:02] the darkness is a settling the end time
[1:35:05] is here one minute before midnight see
[1:35:08] the presence of the enemy the shaking
[1:35:10] the feeling the nervous condition don't
[1:35:13] you see that's where we live
[1:35:15] today see the presence of the enemy the
[1:35:18] shaking the feeling the nervous
[1:35:19] condition the tension of the world not
[1:35:21] knowing that you're Doom that's the
[1:35:24] world that's their Doom said oh my let's
[1:35:27] Mount up with wings as an eagle now fly
[1:35:30] into the arms of him that's the same
[1:35:32] yesterday today and
[1:35:34] forever brother brand was preaching on
[1:35:36] these things everyone during that time
[1:35:38] wanted to dig in the ground build a bomb
[1:35:39] shelter and the prophet told us he said
[1:35:42] we don't we don't can't dig far enough
[1:35:43] in the ground to escape what's coming he
[1:35:46] said we don't need a shelter made of
[1:35:47] steel we need one made of
[1:35:50] feathers Amen in the shadow of his wings
[1:35:53] yes yes it's a shadow but it's the
[1:35:54] shadow of his wings yes it's a trial yes
[1:35:58] it's hard but it's the shadow of his
[1:35:59] wings it's his
[1:36:03] Providence the tender hand of
[1:36:06] Jehovah bringing us to the place where
[1:36:09] we have to
[1:36:10] be amen so one day we can
[1:36:15] fight what is he doing he's covering us
[1:36:19] and all the time taking out the fur and
[1:36:21] taking out the softness of the nest
[1:36:24] so we get uncomfortable enough that
[1:36:27] won't want to
[1:36:29] fly you can't dig down enough can I say
[1:36:33] that in a spiritual way today you can't
[1:36:35] get down enough gloomy enough where you
[1:36:37] can protect yourself from being hurt you
[1:36:40] can't do that the only way to escape is
[1:36:43] to fly go above it that's the anointing
[1:36:45] of the
[1:36:46] hour look at the word what does the word
[1:36:49] say about it Fly Above it it'll be okay
[1:36:53] it's just
[1:36:54] wings but the brandom talked about going
[1:36:56] up Superstition Mountain musicians go
[1:36:58] ahead and
[1:37:01] come he talked about going up
[1:37:02] Superstition
[1:37:06] Mountain and he said he always wanted to
[1:37:08] go there there was a lot of spooky
[1:37:10] stories told about that
[1:37:12] place so he said they he said he tried
[1:37:15] to go up with a
[1:37:17] flashlight and he started his way up he
[1:37:19] said it just wasn't enough light he
[1:37:20] scared of what was out in the darkness
