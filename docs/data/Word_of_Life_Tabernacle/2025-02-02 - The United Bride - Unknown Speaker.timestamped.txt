[43:48] enjoy church with you today worship
[43:51] together with you around the word of the
[43:52] Lord amen Ephesians chapter 4 and verse
[43:55] 1 I want to
[43:57] kind of pick up on a thought that we had
[44:00] dealt with two weeks ago but I want to
[44:02] title this this morning the United bride
[44:04] we talked about the bride in the
[44:05] American
[44:06] church and so we want to talk about the
[44:09] United bride this morning again dealing
[44:12] with that Vision that brother brandham
[44:13] saw of the Bride the preview of the
[44:16] Bride in Ephesians 4:1 Paul writing he
[44:20] said I therefore the prisoner of the
[44:22] Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of
[44:25] the vocation where withth you are called
[44:27] all with all loneliness and meekness
[44:30] with longsuffering forbearing one
[44:32] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[44:35] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[44:39] there's one body and one Spirit even as
[44:42] you're called in one hope of your
[44:44] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[44:48] one God and Father of all who is above
[44:52] all and through all and in you all we
[44:55] thank the Lord for the word you may be
[44:56] SE seated this
[45:01] morning brother brandom sees that Vision
[45:04] on July 3rd 1964 the preview of the
[45:08] Bride he was taken to a review stand and
[45:11] you'll remember the bride came by uh the
[45:14] bride coming this way coming by the
[45:17] review stand and here uh they come and
[45:21] then come the churches separated by
[45:23] National Group each one of them uh uh
[45:26] coming along and he said the bride was
[45:28] marching by sweetly with an air with a
[45:31] character and attitude about them of the
[45:34] word and he sees the churches dressed
[45:36] immorally dancing to rock and roll Beach
[45:39] she's separated by National Group she's
[45:43] led by a witch uh remember there was no
[45:45] leader in front of the Bride but she was
[45:48] looking to the review stand that's where
[45:50] I want to be looking this morning we
[45:52] don't count success by Earthly man but
[45:55] we count success by the review stand the
[45:58] word of God and God sent a message in
[46:00] our day for a reason and so the bride
[46:03] was watching that and as she went by and
[46:07] uh but yet the church was led by this
[46:09] witch and and and the church would go up
[46:12] to the crest of a hill and brother Rand
[46:15] saw in the vision as they marched by
[46:17] that the church would go like they were
[46:19] going up but then when they went to the
[46:20] crest of the Hill they went down uh
[46:23] though they thought perhaps that they
[46:24] were going up but they actually went
[46:26] down but he said the bride when she
[46:28] marched off she just kept on going up
[46:31] she never went down I'm so grateful for
[46:34] that today I believe that's the preview
[46:36] of where we're at and as we're as we're
[46:38] moving up and going forward so uh he
[46:41] said that uh they they there was no
[46:43] leader again they were just watching the
[46:46] review stand and there was no disunity
[46:49] in the bride group uh yet there was one
[46:51] from every nation right there was one he
[46:55] talked about different kinds of and and
[46:58] different nations that they come from
[46:59] not separated by National Group all
[47:02] marching together he said these started
[47:05] marching right up into the skies he said
[47:07] and when they went to marching I noticed
[47:09] a couple of little girls in the back he
[47:11] said look like uh it might be some
[47:14] foreign girl like Sweden or Switzerland
[47:16] or somewhere he said they started to
[47:18] look around and I I said don't do that
[47:21] don't get out of that step right don't
[47:23] get out of that step and he said that
[47:26] might happen happened after he was gone
[47:28] and then he he comes down here he said I
[47:30] heard something like Onward Christian
[47:32] Soldiers and I looked and here come that
[47:35] s a bunch of little girls remember they
[47:36] come by once and then the church come by
[47:39] and he was just smitten in his heart he
[47:40] said is this all we've produced for God
[47:43] and then suddenly here comes he said the
[47:45] bride must come again and when she come
[47:47] by she was the Omega bride she was the
[47:51] the just like the first bride the alpha
[47:53] bride the beginning bride the Bride of
[47:55] the end was just like the first bride
[47:57] yes and brother M said she was smooth
[48:00] clean marching like this to the step of
[48:02] the Gospel she was the word yeah she was
[48:07] the word she might have had different uh
[48:09] worship Styles or different there might
[48:11] have been differences in culture and
[48:13] differences in he's talked about the
[48:15] differences the way she wore hair and
[48:17] different things but yet they were all
[48:19] the bride they were all Church they were
[48:21] all a part of the Bride they were all
[48:23] marching to the beat of the word and he
[48:26] said she was the word they look like one
[48:28] out of every nation he said I was
[48:30] looking at it as they passed by and I
[48:32] seen them pass by instead of going down
[48:34] they started going up he said I noticed
[48:37] one of them trying two or three of them
[48:39] trying getting out of line and I
[48:40] screamed stay in line and the vision
[48:44] left me and I was standing in the room
[48:45] screaming stay in line oh that's what I
[48:48] want to do brother Justin stay in line I
[48:50] want to stay right in line with the word
[48:52] of God sent for our
[48:54] hour each one of them dressed different
[48:56] but decently each one of them keeping
[48:59] their eyes on the voice and the voice
[49:01] behind the voice the message of the hour
[49:04] as they passed by we found that we all
[49:08] want to be in that bride group and I've
[49:09] been struck by that over the past couple
[49:11] of weeks as I haven't been able to
[49:13] remove myself from this thought I want
[49:15] to be part of that bride because
[49:17] remember that's the bride that lives in
[49:18] the city right that's the elect the ones
[49:21] that are going to live in the city is
[49:23] the bride they're the ones and I want to
[49:25] live there I want to be there I want to
[49:27] be a part of that I want to do whatever
[49:29] it takes to be a part of that bride
[49:31] group yet recognizing I can't put myself
[49:33] into that by effort but it takes the
[49:35] election of God and and to give me even
[49:38] a desire to serve God it's got to be his
[49:40] election that does that and his calling
[49:43] so you can't put yourself in nobody can
[49:46] take you out if you're ever a part of
[49:48] that bride group you come out of the
[49:50] mind of God and you're going back to God
[49:53] so you can't be taken out it's Eternal
[49:56] so no one can take you out and so uh and
[49:58] we talked about that and now uh we are
[50:01] the ones who've been called who been
[50:02] chosen to come out of Babylon who have
[50:04] heard the voice of Revelation 18 and
[50:07] obeyed that voice and we're the ones
[50:08] that he spoke to in Luke 12:32 when he
[50:11] said fear not little flock I wonder if
[50:13] that's us this morning if we could be
[50:15] counted as that little flock as a part a
[50:17] portion of that little flock fear not
[50:19] little flock for it is your father's
[50:21] good pleasure to give you the kingdom oh
[50:24] I'm so grateful for that today yeah so
[50:27] you can't put yourself in or out if
[50:28] you're part of the bridegroom that city
[50:31] is your future home and the Bible says
[50:33] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[50:36] eyes aren't you looking forward to that
[50:38] he wipe away all tears from their eyes
[50:40] there should be no more death neither
[50:42] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[50:44] any more pain for the former things are
[50:47] passed
[50:49] away the bride makes herself ready for
[50:52] that
[50:53] place we talked about that Wednesday how
[50:55] that she the bride has made herself
[50:58] ready brand said God didn't push you
[51:00] through a pipe and pull you out the
[51:02] other end and say you're an overcomer
[51:03] but the bride is an
[51:05] overcomer and so there's something you
[51:08] have to do but you've been provided with
[51:10] what to do it with you've been provided
[51:13] with the message of the hour been
[51:14] provided with the word to dress yourself
[51:16] in that it's his righteousness not
[51:19] yours so the Bible said as wife has made
[51:23] herself ready he said at the end of the
[51:24] age he said how did she make herself
[51:27] ready becoming his wife what does she
[51:30] what kind of a garment she had on his
[51:32] own word she was dressed in his
[51:38] righteousness so the bride is Washed by
[51:42] the Water of the word I'm go I'm
[51:43] backgrounding this to go somewhere this
[51:44] morning so just kind of bear with me the
[51:47] word washes her dresses her makes her
[51:49] ready and she must be in step and stay
[51:52] in step with that word as she continues
[51:56] mark
[51:57] and I want you to understand today that
[51:59] the message is not is today to you that
[52:01] have been called out of Babylon the
[52:04] message is not calling you uh to a
[52:07] continual uh to a continual getting
[52:09] saved again or or receiving the Holy
[52:12] Ghost again although you we want to be
[52:14] refilled many times but if you're sealed
[52:17] you're sealed and if you're saved you're
[52:20] saved and nothing can take that away but
[52:23] what the message is calling us to today
[52:25] and what the messenger is calling
[52:26] calling us to what the preachers that
[52:28] are preaching are calling us to what we
[52:30] would call the five-fold ministry
[52:32] they're calling us to uh to a perfection
[52:35] in our walk to a place where we can walk
[52:39] in step with the word and a perfection
[52:41] in our walk is not a a a Perfection by
[52:44] the blood because that we can only be
[52:45] perfected by the blood sinless
[52:47] Perfection but it's a maturity to where
[52:50] we can when we walk we can walk in line
[52:52] with the word so it's calling us to a
[52:55] mature place a mature bride with a
[52:57] mature walk because the seed has got to
[52:59] become to a place of maturity before we
[53:03] can go home so if you go back to
[53:05] Ephesians
[53:07] 4 so I said all that as a background so
[53:10] the clock starts
[53:13] now if you go back to Ephesians chapter
[53:16] 4 Paul is saying the same thing that
[53:20] brother brandom says when he sees the
[53:21] vision get back in Step get back in line
[53:25] look how Paul word said I therefore the
[53:28] prisoner of the Lord beseech you I beg
[53:30] you that you walk worthy of the vocation
[53:33] wherewith you're called he's telling you
[53:34] walk worthy walk in Step yeah walk
[53:38] according to the word right and and
[53:40] brother Brandon was calling get back in
[53:42] line what did he say over what did they
[53:43] say over there he said I preach what
[53:44] Paul preached they said we're resting on
[53:46] that so as brother brandham the the
[53:49] messenger to our hour was calling us get
[53:50] back in Step Paul is saying walk worthy
[53:53] yeah of the vocation wherewith you're
[53:56] called yeah in other words get back in
[53:59] Step get back in line right so God has
[54:03] chosen us God has chosen you you're his
[54:06] elect and we need to understand that we
[54:09] need to believe that he speaks directly
[54:11] to you to you young people to your older
[54:14] folks to all of us he speaks directly to
[54:16] us sister Betty and says we are chosen
[54:19] by him and it's so wonderful to be
[54:20] chosen yeah but yet we must stay in step
[54:24] with the word right and I I'll confess
[54:27] that many times in the past that I've
[54:30] looked at that I I believe in
[54:33] Holiness I believe I preach Holiness I
[54:37] I've told people if you want to see what
[54:38] I believe about Holiness uh look at my
[54:40] family I we try to live a hus lifestyle
[54:43] try to do that the very best that we can
[54:46] and yet many times when I hear get back
[54:48] in step when I was younger I would hear
[54:51] that brother bill has wear your dresses
[54:54] a little longer maybe you're sleep a
[54:56] little longer or or not you know not to
[55:00] trim your hair or not to wear makeup and
[55:02] all that and I'll say this that should
[55:05] be Elementary to
[55:07] us at this point that should be
[55:09] Elementary and we'll keep preaching it
[55:11] because people still need it our young
[55:13] people still need it we still need to
[55:15] hear it we still need to hear those
[55:17] things and we'll preach those things and
[55:19] I do preach those things and yet when I
[55:22] see those things you see you know when
[55:24] you see a church that that that are all
[55:26] out of order in that way and I don't
[55:27] believe you are today but if we are get
[55:30] back in line but but that's the only
[55:32] thing I thought of when I thought get
[55:35] back in line get back in line with the
[55:37] Holiness standard of the word and yet
[55:40] that's not the only part of the word
[55:43] that we needed to get back in line with
[55:46] am right that was part of the word it is
[55:49] part of the word and we need to be in
[55:50] line with that when you see a church
[55:52] that's not in line with that cuz nobody
[55:53] ever preaches it right right that's not
[55:56] all there is to being a Christian right
[55:59] cuz you could wear long skirts and long
[56:01] hair and and look ever so Godly yeah and
[56:05] and and talk to you for five minutes you
[56:06] got a rotten
[56:08] attitude right and a rotten disposition
[56:11] and and treat people rotten and and God
[56:13] don't do
[56:14] that are you with me this morning so we
[56:17] want to come back in step with the word
[56:19] we want to increase our faith that's
[56:21] being in step with the word believing
[56:23] What God Says over everything else
[56:24] that's being in step with the word and
[56:26] coming to a place of maturity in our
[56:29] relationships and how we treat people
[56:31] and the way that we Fellowship together
[56:33] or not whatever it is that we do we we
[56:36] got to come to a maturity in that in
[56:39] order to reach the place that we're
[56:40] going to because when we get over there
[56:43] we're going to live in one city when we
[56:45] get over there we're not going to be
[56:46] separated by National Group when we get
[56:48] over there so we can't be separated in
[56:50] our hearts by that today right are you
[56:54] with me so far
[56:56] so I I I've come to see a little bit
[56:59] deeper meaning in getting back in
[57:03] step and this is what Paul is dealing
[57:05] with in Ephesians 4 he deals in
[57:09] Ephesians with how we walk in the sense
[57:12] of our morality and things like that but
[57:15] then he goes deeper he goes deeper
[57:18] because many of us most of us walk in a
[57:20] moral lifestyle in a way that's right in
[57:24] that way and yet many times and even
[57:27] before immorality shows up many times it
[57:29] shows up in character
[57:32] first and we don't put as much stress on
[57:35] that and really if we could if people
[57:37] would would recognize that a person who
[57:42] mistreats people maybe mistreats his
[57:45] wife or mistreats his children or
[57:47] mistreats a church or mistreats uh the
[57:50] center the person on the street yeah
[57:53] right there's something wrong with that
[57:55] person
[57:58] right we don't mistreat
[58:00] people and sometimes you say well people
[58:02] might take advantage sometimes they do
[58:04] but we don't mistreat people they took
[58:07] advantage of Jesus they took advantage
[58:10] of his silence on the cross didn't they
[58:13] they took advantage of of the fact that
[58:15] he stood there and let himself be beat
[58:17] to an inch of his life they took
[58:19] advantage of the fact they didn't call
[58:20] 10,000 angels they took advantage of him
[58:24] but he stood there and took it yes
[58:26] brother Bruce why he was paying for our
[58:28] sins but he said let this mind be in you
[58:31] which was also in Christ Jesus he left
[58:34] an example for you to follow in his
[58:39] steps now when you're in step with the
[58:43] word you're in harmony with one another
[58:47] I know I'm going to address something
[58:50] because we've all been trained like well
[58:51] that's not being one is not being one
[58:54] with one another and that's true and
[58:56] that's important it's being one with the
[58:58] word yeah right right being one for us
[59:02] is not being one with one another it's
[59:03] being one with the word yeah but that
[59:06] makes you one with one another when
[59:09] you're one with the word because to be
[59:12] one with the word to be in step with the
[59:13] word is to be in harmony with the other
[59:16] members of the Bride don't mean you all
[59:17] see eye to eye in in every little Iota
[59:20] and every little thing we're not
[59:22] producing a cult right God's not looking
[59:25] for a bunch of people all identically
[59:27] dressed and all
[59:29] identically know God's a god of variety
[59:32] yes right and but it's learning how to
[59:35] uh if I could say borrow from our
[59:36] Wednesday nights learning how to till
[59:38] our own plot of land yeah right learning
[59:41] how to learning how to work our own corn
[59:43] and field and and learning how not to
[59:45] look at over what everybody else is
[59:47] doing and and doing what it takes to
[59:50] just take care of what God has given us
[59:53] right so in first John 1 and 7 the bible
[59:57] says if we walk in the light so I you
[1:00:00] know I I appreciate that song bringing
[1:00:02] me out on that song with Alan because
[1:00:04] this is part of what I'm preaching about
[1:00:05] today is Walking In The Light yeah right
[1:00:08] Walking In step is walking in the light
[1:00:10] of the word he said if we walk in the
[1:00:12] light as he is in the light we have
[1:00:14] Fellowship one with another what is our
[1:00:18] fellowship based on the blood of Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ his son cleanseth us from how
[1:00:22] much sin come on Church how much sin
[1:00:25] your sin my sin his sin her sin come on
[1:00:29] church all sin all sin now you say well
[1:00:32] you don't understand what they did to me
[1:00:34] all sin right right and we can have
[1:00:36] fellowship with one another because we
[1:00:38] have fellowship with God and the blood
[1:00:40] of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all a
[1:00:44] every sin that we've committed good so
[1:00:49] this is not an artificial Unity yeah as
[1:00:53] the church was kept in line by nation
[1:00:57] and kept in line by politics and kept in
[1:01:00] line by a witch which brother B said was
[1:01:02] the World Council of
[1:01:04] churches right a false
[1:01:07] Unity but it's not an artificial Unity
[1:01:10] but Jesus prayed we might be one with
[1:01:12] the father United with the word yes as
[1:01:16] he and the father were
[1:01:18] one now we know that artificial Unity
[1:01:21] brings the Tower of Babylon if the Lord
[1:01:23] lets me tonight I want to preach a
[1:01:24] little bit more about that
[1:01:26] about that Tower of Babylon some things
[1:01:28] on that but in John
[1:01:31] 17:1 he said now I am no more in the
[1:01:33] world but these are in the world and I
[1:01:35] come to thee Holy Father keep through
[1:01:37] thine own name Those whom thou has given
[1:01:39] me that they may be one as we are he
[1:01:42] wasn't talking about natural Unity but
[1:01:44] spiritual Oneness with god brother
[1:01:47] brandham says this and he had the people
[1:01:48] repeat it he said Oneness with God is to
[1:01:52] have God's spirit in you agreeing with
[1:01:55] the word
[1:01:56] all the
[1:01:59] word huh the whole word and to make it
[1:02:04] manifested in power that's a challenge
[1:02:06] right there if we just take that quote
[1:02:10] and live it that that that'd be that'd
[1:02:11] be about all we ever needed yeah think
[1:02:14] about it Oneness with God is to have
[1:02:17] God's spirit in you agreeing with the
[1:02:19] word all the word cuz all of us can
[1:02:21] agree with some of the word right right
[1:02:25] but the bride agrees with all the word
[1:02:27] the whole word to make it man you say
[1:02:28] well I don't walk in step with every
[1:02:30] word but the bride is trying to get back
[1:02:32] in step right even in a late hour even
[1:02:35] in a difficult time even after the
[1:02:37] prophets left the scene are you are you
[1:02:39] with me the bride's the ones trying to
[1:02:41] get back in Step as she's going up yeah
[1:02:45] and so the Oneness is to make it
[1:02:48] manifested in power he said there you
[1:02:50] are that's oness with God when that
[1:02:51] power Works in me and works in you he
[1:02:54] said We Are One
[1:02:56] Hallelujah he said Amen brother kid he's
[1:02:59] talking to an old brother there old
[1:03:01] preacher I believe he said when the
[1:03:02] power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in
[1:03:03] you there's no disagreement the words
[1:03:07] there it works it makes it what it is
[1:03:11] yeah God made flesh in You by his word
[1:03:15] are you with me so far the word made
[1:03:18] Power among you every
[1:03:22] word so I want to focus down now as we
[1:03:26] focus broadly on walking and step with
[1:03:29] the word I want to focus down now uh so
[1:03:32] take out your spiritual binoculars let's
[1:03:34] just focus on one area and recognize
[1:03:37] this isn't all there is but this is what
[1:03:39] Paul deals with in Ephesians 4 which is
[1:03:41] important because of what else he deals
[1:03:43] with in Ephesians 4 so in Ephesians
[1:03:47] 4:2 so he says I want you to walk worthy
[1:03:49] of the vocation where with you're called
[1:03:51] get back in line stay in line stay in
[1:03:54] Step look with with all lonliness and
[1:03:57] meekness yeah with
[1:04:00] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:04:06] love I know I I I've been accused of
[1:04:10] being a kind old priest and and I guess
[1:04:13] it's okay to be accused of being kind
[1:04:15] but I don't like the priest
[1:04:17] part but I've been accused of being too
[1:04:19] soft and things and I you know what what
[1:04:22] if this is what we're
[1:04:24] lacking the whole word's been revealed
[1:04:27] yeah right right the whole word is here
[1:04:30] the opening of the word revealed all the
[1:04:32] Mysteries yes it's all here yeah but
[1:04:36] what if what we're lacking is that final
[1:04:39] little bit
[1:04:40] of of of of
[1:04:45] refining that makes us treat one another
[1:04:49] right as I've mentioned to you before
[1:04:51] that the brid tree goes comes back up in
[1:04:54] reverse order from the way it was eaten
[1:04:56] away and so the last thing to be
[1:04:59] restored before the coming of the
[1:05:01] Capstone love was brotherly
[1:05:04] kindness right so the last two are
[1:05:06] closely identified with what we're
[1:05:07] talking about today so when you look at
[1:05:10] that and look at the unity that we
[1:05:12] should have one with another Paul's
[1:05:14] saying this is how you have it by being
[1:05:16] in step with the word not just in our
[1:05:19] dress or not just in our in the way we
[1:05:22] have church I believe we should be in
[1:05:24] unity with the word in those ways but in
[1:05:26] how we treat one another how we treat
[1:05:28] one another within the family how we
[1:05:30] treat one another within the church
[1:05:31] family amen come on Church it
[1:05:34] matters and if you think I'm I'm
[1:05:36] especially sensitive to this I am
[1:05:39] because I grew up in a home where my my
[1:05:41] and my dad's passed away and gone on to
[1:05:43] his reward and and and he made some
[1:05:46] things right with me before he passed
[1:05:47] away but I grew up in a home where this
[1:05:49] wasn't done yeah and it was all about
[1:05:52] the word and being right with the word
[1:05:54] and all of this thing but but they
[1:05:56] failed to recognize that part of that is
[1:05:58] being right with one another and loving
[1:06:00] one another and treating your family
[1:06:02] right and treating your your wife right
[1:06:03] come on
[1:06:05] church that's part of the word too and
[1:06:09] if you can't do that how you ever going
[1:06:10] to do the other on and we're we fuss and
[1:06:14] fight and fought and and squabbled and
[1:06:18] and and and lashed and and and devoured
[1:06:21] one another what did it get us yeah huh
[1:06:26] what what it get us in the end come on
[1:06:28] tell me allall live through those times
[1:06:30] everyone to be a defender of the word
[1:06:32] and pull out a sword and I believe in
[1:06:34] defending the word but what did it get
[1:06:35] us being separated and and and in this
[1:06:38] area what did it get us being like that
[1:06:40] got division among churches and division
[1:06:42] among preachers and division among
[1:06:44] people and and division among families
[1:06:47] and people separating from one another
[1:06:49] because I believe this about the message
[1:06:51] and I believe that about the message why
[1:06:52] don't we just come back and believe what
[1:06:53] a prophet said and and have church and
[1:06:56] love
[1:06:57] people because the children are
[1:07:00] watching and they're affected more by
[1:07:02] your attitude than what you say they may
[1:07:04] not always remember everything you say
[1:07:06] but they remember the attitude you said
[1:07:08] it in and they remember how how you
[1:07:10] dealt with things and how you deal with
[1:07:15] things and they know what you're like at
[1:07:17] home I know what I'm like at home I'll
[1:07:20] be the first to admit I need a little
[1:07:22] refining and I think all of us do when
[1:07:24] it comes to this this
[1:07:26] area loneliness is
[1:07:29] humility humility humility is not how
[1:07:33] how you dress you know you can dress
[1:07:36] like never thought I'd say you can dress
[1:07:37] like brother Landon this morning and
[1:07:39] still be humble that's powerful man I I
[1:07:42] almost ask you if you wanted to
[1:07:45] preach I I like a good suit and tie I'm
[1:07:48] I'm just you know you want to get in
[1:07:50] good with me that's how to do it right
[1:07:52] there oh that's just you know I like to
[1:07:55] see a person that looks like they you
[1:07:57] know boy I got myself in trouble
[1:08:01] there I do like to see a suit and tie
[1:08:03] and that right
[1:08:04] Jaden so these young men starting doing
[1:08:06] that man that's that's nice but that's
[1:08:09] not you know humility you could you
[1:08:10] could be proud of that humility is not
[1:08:12] just wearing uh uh wearing
[1:08:16] uh I started to say something else but
[1:08:19] that's not what it wearing the rags they
[1:08:20] used to wear you know when they
[1:08:21] sackcloth and
[1:08:22] Ashes right you could have sackcloth and
[1:08:26] Ashes and be proud of
[1:08:29] them but what's humility humility of the
[1:08:32] heart yeah humbling yourself to the word
[1:08:35] saying Lord what you want for my life
[1:08:37] that's what I you want me to wear a suit
[1:08:38] I'll wear a suit if you want me to wear
[1:08:40] overalls I'll wear overall if you want
[1:08:42] me uh to work a certain job I'll do it
[1:08:45] if you want me to have a certain office
[1:08:46] I'll do it whatever it is you want me to
[1:08:48] do Lord I'm humbling myself to you
[1:08:52] amen meekness meekness in this place in
[1:08:55] the script scripture now there's
[1:08:56] different words that are used for
[1:08:57] meekness but in this place in the
[1:08:59] scripture this word for meekness is
[1:09:02] gentleness courtesy yeah
[1:09:06] on and you think well C you know I can
[1:09:09] be as discourteous as I want to be I can
[1:09:11] be as rude as I want to be and still
[1:09:13] follow the word not according to
[1:09:15] Paul not according to brother
[1:09:19] brandom right you you can't do that we
[1:09:21] treat one another with courtesy courtesy
[1:09:24] and that's more than just being nice and
[1:09:25] saying please and thank you although our
[1:09:27] young people ought to learn to do that
[1:09:30] right treat one another with courtesy
[1:09:31] even on the youth group
[1:09:34] chat thinking about one another and what
[1:09:37] we say and what we do come on church and
[1:09:39] how we treat one another and how you
[1:09:41] treat one another listen to me if you're
[1:09:42] treating one another badly now uh that
[1:09:45] they don't bode well for the future you
[1:09:46] need to be one and our young people
[1:09:49] don't treat each other badly but I just
[1:09:50] thought I'd Dro that in there because
[1:09:52] the devil gets in those things you young
[1:09:55] you young ones you you know you get to
[1:09:57] the point where you you feel like well
[1:09:59] I'll just pick at this one because of uh
[1:10:00] their size or their height or how
[1:10:02] they're dressed or something like that
[1:10:04] don't do that be courteous to one
[1:10:06] another uh get get in a habit of being
[1:10:09] nice to one another
[1:10:11] now so you can so you can later on it
[1:10:14] won't be difficult for
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:19] courtesy you say what does that mean
[1:10:21] well we need to be courteous with one
[1:10:22] another with the Holy Spirit
[1:10:25] courteous with one another when Paul
[1:10:28] when he said how we should take
[1:10:29] communion he said we should carry one
[1:10:31] for another there's a great lesson in
[1:10:34] that I don't just take it and rush off
[1:10:36] by yourself but communion is
[1:10:40] Oneness are you with now we Terry one
[1:10:42] for another we pray one for another and
[1:10:45] so maybe one part of the body maybe you
[1:10:46] didn't get nothing out of the service
[1:10:48] and the service goes a little bit long
[1:10:50] cuz somebody's here at the altar praying
[1:10:51] I said we ought to be courteous to one
[1:10:53] another a courteous another maybe you
[1:10:56] got something to do but you can wait 5
[1:10:58] minutes maybe and and if you have to
[1:10:59] leave and slip off courteously and
[1:11:01] nicely we we should be courteous gentle
[1:11:04] with one another cuz you never know who
[1:11:07] you might have to live next to in that
[1:11:10] city right might be that person you
[1:11:13] couldn't stand but they might be a
[1:11:15] Christian yeah come
[1:11:17] on longsuffering is patience yes
[1:11:22] patience with each other and patience
[1:11:23] with God
[1:11:26] patience forbearing and brother B talks
[1:11:28] about these things we could go back and
[1:11:30] tie it into the to the virtues to the
[1:11:33] stature of a perfect man which is
[1:11:35] essentially what we're talking about but
[1:11:36] approaching it from a different
[1:11:38] direction forbearing is accepting
[1:11:42] complaints Welly there's a hard
[1:11:45] one accepting complaints yeah I had to
[1:11:49] think twice about that one it means that
[1:11:52] when somebody
[1:11:53] complains about you
[1:11:55] to you or you hear about it you're just
[1:11:59] willing to say
[1:12:00] okay it's all right maybe I do need help
[1:12:04] amen maybe I do need to
[1:12:07] change that's tough isn't
[1:12:09] it accepting
[1:12:14] complaints a lot of pastors would have a
[1:12:16] whole lot more people in their churches
[1:12:18] if they just accept
[1:12:22] complaints but they fight it
[1:12:25] and then and then end up people leaving
[1:12:27] and getting hurt and I'll be honest with
[1:12:29] you not everybody's bride I know that I
[1:12:31] don't know who is and who isn't so I
[1:12:33] want to keep y'all around as much as I
[1:12:35] can yet I realize people leave people
[1:12:38] will people there are people you just
[1:12:40] can't help but I pray they get help
[1:12:42] somewhere
[1:12:43] else I don't want bad for them God help
[1:12:46] me if I'd ever had that kind of an
[1:12:48] attitude
[1:12:50] yeah accepting complaints maybe we do
[1:12:53] need to look at that and examine that
[1:12:55] and see
[1:12:58] yeah and then if you complain too much
[1:13:00] that's on you you
[1:13:03] know come on church that's not me I
[1:13:07] don't have to deal with that just let me
[1:13:09] forbear accept a complaint Ephesians 4:3
[1:13:13] endeavoring or being zealous to keep the
[1:13:16] unity of the spirit to keep the unity of
[1:13:18] the spirit because we have the unity of
[1:13:20] the spirit but we have to keep the unity
[1:13:22] of the spirit in the bond of peace yeah
[1:13:25] verse four there is one body and one
[1:13:28] Spirit even as you're called in one hope
[1:13:31] of your calling said we're all one one
[1:13:34] Lord One Faith one baptism yes one God
[1:13:39] and Father of all who's above all
[1:13:41] through all in you all but unto every
[1:13:43] one of us now see he says we're all one
[1:13:45] but we're not all the
[1:13:47] same we're all one but he gave he unto
[1:13:50] every one of us is given Grace according
[1:13:52] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[1:13:55] we're all one but we're not all the same
[1:13:57] if you go down to verse 11 Paul begins
[1:13:59] to deal with the five-fold ministry in
[1:14:01] Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles and
[1:14:04] some prophets and some evangelists and
[1:14:05] some pastors and teachers I'm so glad
[1:14:08] we're not all the same because I would
[1:14:10] hate to hear me all the
[1:14:12] time that would just kill me I don't
[1:14:14] listen to myself preach I would just
[1:14:16] kill me to to have to hear me all the
[1:14:18] time I want to hear somebody that's got
[1:14:19] a different kind of a gift are you with
[1:14:22] me now I want to hear Brother Joel and
[1:14:24] brother Stewart because they got a
[1:14:25] different gift than I do but it blesses
[1:14:27] my heart to hear them and other brothers
[1:14:29] that come through just brother Andrew
[1:14:31] and different ones we use all the time
[1:14:32] and we we we just want to hear that gift
[1:14:34] but it don't mean everybody should be
[1:14:36] the same we're not supposed to be the
[1:14:38] same right but we're supposed to be one
[1:14:41] yes are you with me now so he said he he
[1:14:45] said for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:14:46] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:14:48] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[1:14:50] all come in the unity of the faith where
[1:14:55] brother Ben when are you going to quit
[1:14:56] preaching this when we all come in the
[1:14:58] unity of the faith when is that going to
[1:15:00] be I believe it'll be right then when we
[1:15:02] go home it' be right at that moment when
[1:15:05] we go home we may not come in unity of
[1:15:07] of which pie we like we may not come in
[1:15:09] unity of preference right on we may not
[1:15:12] come in unity of opinion yes but we've
[1:15:14] got to come in the unity of the faith
[1:15:16] yes what is that the message of the hour
[1:15:19] what God has revealed to us in the hour
[1:15:21] we come in unity to that come in the
[1:15:23] unity of the face of the knowledge of
[1:15:25] the Son of God unto a perfect man a
[1:15:27] mature man unto the measure of the
[1:15:29] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:15:31] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:15:34] to and fro and carried about with every
[1:15:35] wind of Doctrine by the sight of men and
[1:15:37] cunning crafs whereby they lie and wait
[1:15:39] to deceive I'm I'm ready to give up my
[1:15:41] come on Church there comes a time when
[1:15:43] you become knowledgeable when you be get
[1:15:45] ready you're ready to give up your

[1:16:42] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:16:45] all things which is ahead even Christ
[1:16:47] right from whom the whole body fitly
[1:16:50] joined together and compacted by that
[1:16:51] which every joint supplieth according to
[1:16:54] the effectual working in the measure of
[1:16:56] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:16:59] unto the edifying of itself in love so
[1:17:02] he's talking he begins to talk about the
[1:17:03] different parts of the body and how
[1:17:05] everyone fits one with another yeah
[1:17:08] Oneness with the word I believe will
[1:17:11] produce clean living how many believe
[1:17:13] that it'll produce Godly dress good
[1:17:18] marriages beautiful
[1:17:21] families wonderful local churches yes
[1:17:24] it'll also produce Unity yes right as
[1:17:29] more and more the bride becomes one with
[1:17:32] the word a United bride now you can all
[1:17:34] be in one place and be what brother
[1:17:38] brandom called disunified
[1:17:41] together or be scattered all over the
[1:17:43] face of the Earth and yet be United
[1:17:47] under one message yes good see the unity
[1:17:51] never took away our individual
[1:17:53] characteristics
[1:17:55] but each one of us were predestined to
[1:17:58] manifest some portion of the promise
[1:18:01] which is our allotment in that promise
[1:18:04] brother brand talks about the American
[1:18:05] Indian and it is a Marvel because if you
[1:18:07] think about how few of us Europeans
[1:18:10] there
[1:18:11] was uh around and how little of brother
[1:18:14] Wendell's
[1:18:15] kind that there was in the country you
[1:18:19] know there weren't very many there
[1:18:20] weren't very many of us there was a
[1:18:22] whole lot of little Josh Martins running
[1:18:23] around you know
[1:18:26] and and there wasn't very many of us and
[1:18:29] yet today the white man is kind of taken
[1:18:31] over and the Indian lives on a
[1:18:34] reservation why did that happen if you
[1:18:36] go back and study it at first there was
[1:18:38] hundreds of thousands maybe millions of
[1:18:41] Indians it wasn't an uninhabited land
[1:18:45] but they couldn't work
[1:18:47] together they they they had tribes and
[1:18:49] disputes and
[1:18:51] wars and every time there was a war half
[1:18:53] of them would align with this one this
[1:18:55] European power and half of them with
[1:18:56] this European power by the time they got
[1:18:58] done they slaughtered one another that's
[1:19:00] right they just couldn't get
[1:19:03] along with one another and brother
[1:19:06] brandom identifies that as like the
[1:19:09] denominations yes he said how did the
[1:19:11] American in lose he said they were
[1:19:13] Superior in numbers yeah and even they
[1:19:16] were Superior in tactics and at first in
[1:19:20] Weaponry but they failed to get United
[1:19:23] until hundred hundreds of years later
[1:19:26] and they finally United themselves and
[1:19:28] want a great victory over kuster but it
[1:19:30] was too late right cuz the war the the
[1:19:33] the the uh culture and and and the the
[1:19:35] settlement had Advanced too far they let
[1:19:38] it go too long and brother Brandon when
[1:19:41] he talked about that he said this he
[1:19:42] said we dis unify the body of Christ we
[1:19:45] should never be divided yeah we might
[1:19:50] differ in ideas but let's be heart in
[1:19:53] heart Brothers
[1:19:55] God wants us to be he died for the
[1:19:58] entire Church of God and we do not want
[1:20:02] to be disunified now brother Randon
[1:20:04] would always talk about how he wanted
[1:20:06] the denominations to work together right
[1:20:09] and if you've ever been around a
[1:20:10] denominational Church some of y'all were
[1:20:12] raised in message churches and I was too
[1:20:15] but I spent more time around
[1:20:16] denominational people than I did message
[1:20:18] people and I come to realize this you're
[1:20:20] not going to get a whole lot of unity
[1:20:22] between uh the Pentecostals and the
[1:20:23] Baptist I've noticed curiously the one
[1:20:25] thing that brings Unity now is music
[1:20:28] right they all kind of worship the same
[1:20:31] way whether wherever you go but that
[1:20:33] wasn't the case even when I was a kid
[1:20:35] everybody had their own liturgy and
[1:20:36] their own worship and their own way of
[1:20:38] doing things but you couldn't even get
[1:20:40] we come out of the uh Holiness movement
[1:20:42] and you had you had uh a hundred
[1:20:45] different denominations and some of them
[1:20:46] only had 10 15
[1:20:48] churches and and their General Camp
[1:20:50] would be attended by 100 people and yet
[1:20:53] they had a denomination the only
[1:20:54] difference in one denomination another
[1:20:55] was this one would wear a tie and that
[1:20:57] one wouldn't that's right or this one
[1:21:00] believed in open toed shoes and this one
[1:21:02] didn't yeah and that was the whole
[1:21:04] difference Y and thank God for a prophet
[1:21:08] in our age because there's something we
[1:21:09] can come back to because each one of
[1:21:12] them any little guy can come up with his
[1:21:13] own interpretation of the word and just
[1:21:15] run off and do his own thing right right
[1:21:18] so that's what why God had to call a
[1:21:20] prophet because with different men you
[1:21:21] got different opinions right about how
[1:21:23] to do things
[1:21:25] right so God had to call a prophet in
[1:21:26] our hour but brother brandom talked
[1:21:28] about that and how that he wished they
[1:21:29] would come together but they never would
[1:21:32] he said but my Ministry he said is a
[1:21:33] Ministry trying to unite the body of
[1:21:36] Christ together trying to unite the body
[1:21:40] of Christ together not unite
[1:21:42] denominations to one denomination listen
[1:21:45] but unite brothers and sisters as one
[1:21:48] group of people one in purpose so could
[1:21:51] we be that today one in heart one in you
[1:21:55] to see the coming of the Lord
[1:21:57] Jesus oh my so brother brand never
[1:22:01] looked at the denominations and said you
[1:22:04] have too much Unity come on now yeah
[1:22:07] yeah he looked at them and said you're
[1:22:09] getting a false Unity right but he never
[1:22:12] looked at them and said you got too much
[1:22:14] Unity what he said was we must first be
[1:22:17] United with the
[1:22:18] word and that word breaks down the walls
[1:22:21] that hinder fellowship with those of
[1:22:23] like Precious Faith you remember the
[1:22:25] story of the Ducks brother BR said the
[1:22:27] Ducks were all on the pond but they were
[1:22:28] separated by fences yeah but once the
[1:22:31] water came up what happened the Ducks
[1:22:34] floated over the fences and began to
[1:22:36] Fellowship him what was keeping the
[1:22:39] ducks apart the fences what kept people
[1:22:42] apart denominationalism idolatry as it
[1:22:45] as it relates to that the Babylon system
[1:22:48] which was a confusion of language right
[1:22:50] where they all spoke different things
[1:22:53] and so they all they all begin to group
[1:22:55] off in different places and and so it's
[1:22:58] like ducks on the pond brother brand
[1:22:59] gives another illustration involving
[1:23:01] Ducks he talks about a leader he talks
[1:23:04] about this United time and sign he talks
[1:23:05] about in different places he talked
[1:23:07] about a ducks that had to have a leader
[1:23:10] and if you got a good leader the leader
[1:23:12] at a certain time he's stirred to be
[1:23:14] raised up he feels that maybe that first
[1:23:17] chill in the air and and he stirred to
[1:23:20] be raised up and to fly up into heavens
[1:23:22] and begin to call for the other d to
[1:23:24] join him and then pretty soon they're
[1:23:27] all together and they fly off to a
[1:23:29] southern land where they won't freeze to
[1:23:31] death right ain't type that to us but he
[1:23:33] said if you follow the wrong leader you
[1:23:35] end up in the wrong place right so they
[1:23:38] all fly to the rice fields of Arkansas
[1:23:40] or Louisiana and they they can they can
[1:23:42] spend the winter there if the hunters
[1:23:44] don't get them they they can spend the
[1:23:46] winter there but he talked about how
[1:23:48] that this certain duck he said was got
[1:23:50] so off course he got to look at at the
[1:23:52] wrong thing he got the following the
[1:23:55] wrong leader and he ended up in
[1:23:57] England all the way across and probably
[1:24:00] never made it back to their Homeland
[1:24:03] because of where they were there's death
[1:24:04] in that Journey that he he just ended up
[1:24:07] in the wrong place I say this today
[1:24:09] we've got a leader taking us back to our
[1:24:11] future home that leader we know is the
[1:24:13] Holy Ghost but it's in the message of
[1:24:15] the hour that's his way of doing it we
[1:24:17] have a leader taking us Back to Future
[1:24:19] Let's Stay with that leader under the
[1:24:20] banner of the message of the hour let's
[1:24:22] fly home
[1:24:25] together
[1:24:28] good now why is that so difficult for us
[1:24:31] it's because we Elevate our personal
[1:24:32] opinions to word status on come on now
[1:24:36] and every little honk we hear we like
[1:24:37] well that may be
[1:24:41] right we get our brother BR said we have
[1:24:44] to
[1:24:45] focus listen what he says here it's
[1:24:47] really important he said we got to get
[1:24:49] ourselves focused till whether we live
[1:24:50] or die sink or drown it's Calvary Christ
[1:24:54] that's the thing that God wants us to
[1:24:55] come back to and men in the focus of
[1:24:58] God's word instead of bringing it
[1:24:59] together and making it say the one thing
[1:25:02] that God makes it say we look at the
[1:25:05] natural side now he's explaining how
[1:25:07] denominations organizations get started
[1:25:10] he said we look at the natural side
[1:25:13] therefore it man doing that he gets
[1:25:15] himself into a place that he just takes
[1:25:18] off after the thing that's
[1:25:21] presented now here's it's a great
[1:25:23] teaching if we can ident identify this
[1:25:25] is how you identify somebody that's
[1:25:26] getting off an error or a group that's
[1:25:28] becoming organizational in their
[1:25:30] mindset because listen what he says
[1:25:33] happens he said he said if a man doing
[1:25:35] that he gets himself into a place he
[1:25:36] takes off after the thing that's
[1:25:38] presented he said here's an opportunity
[1:25:40] now he's quoting this these people that
[1:25:42] we us little group we can do this and we
[1:25:46] won't have nothing to do with the rest
[1:25:47] of
[1:25:48] them it's how denominations get
[1:25:51] started he said on that see that's the
[1:25:53] first thing is presented now watch this
[1:25:57] the first thing is presented so if you
[1:25:59] go to a church and the and and the very
[1:26:02] first thing that's presented that's
[1:26:03] their Doctrine so if you go to a church
[1:26:06] you've never been to even a message
[1:26:07] church maybe and you go there and the
[1:26:09] first thing they they tell you they look
[1:26:11] at you and they say what do you believe
[1:26:12] about brother brandom whether whether or
[1:26:14] not he fulfills certain Visions yeah
[1:26:17] come on now that's the very first
[1:26:19] thing right or what do you believe
[1:26:22] about what the
[1:26:24] Ria right what do you believe about this
[1:26:28] certain Doctrine and that becomes all
[1:26:31] they preach yes right right it's the
[1:26:34] thing that's presented right that they
[1:26:36] rally around and become an organization
[1:26:39] around though there may even be truth in
[1:26:41] what they're saying yeah and there's not
[1:26:44] truth in all of it some of it's just
[1:26:45] stupid
[1:26:47] right but some of it there's some truth
[1:26:50] to so it's a little more you know you
[1:26:52] lean towards it a little bit more right
[1:26:54] cuz there's a little element of truth to
[1:26:56] it but it's the only thing they present
[1:26:59] right and so they present it over and
[1:27:01] over and over again and I say if you go
[1:27:02] to that church you'll starve yes right
[1:27:05] right because that's all they're
[1:27:06] presenting it's one thing yeah and and
[1:27:10] it's not the message Noah presented one
[1:27:12] thing but it was the message of the hour
[1:27:14] yeah what we present is the full word
[1:27:16] yes right we have access to the full
[1:27:18] word that's what we present and our
[1:27:20] Focus ought to be on a Rapture going
[1:27:22] home right
[1:27:24] right so so brother say the first thing
[1:27:27] is presented instead of focuses in to
[1:27:29] know that it's brotherly love that we
[1:27:31] should have one for another and to
[1:27:34] understand one another and to love one
[1:27:36] another and to worship with one another
[1:27:40] they degrade a man because of his
[1:27:41] clothes he wears or the education he has
[1:27:44] or the color of his skin or something
[1:27:46] like that he said and it separates the
[1:27:48] people and man takes off after that yeah
[1:27:51] that's
[1:27:52] right so brother talked about us and he
[1:27:55] talked about even in that quote he
[1:27:56] talked about us being a three-part being
[1:27:58] he said men cater to the
[1:28:00] natural right they cater to the Natural
[1:28:02] and so two-thirds of you as I heard a
[1:28:05] brother say it I believe it was brother
[1:28:06] Donnie he said this he said two-thirds
[1:28:08] of you are fighting with two-thirds of
[1:28:09] them and that's why you have church
[1:28:10] problems there's a lot of Truth to
[1:28:13] that right I put that in my own words
[1:28:15] but there's a whole lot of Truth to that
[1:28:17] because we cater to the Natural that's
[1:28:19] why we have divisions yes we cat well
[1:28:22] I'm aul I'm of apollis right and that's
[1:28:24] what the Corinthians Church did and said
[1:28:26] for you yet
[1:28:27] carnal you're yet carnal you're not
[1:28:29] spiritual yet you're not where you're
[1:28:31] supposed to be he said for as there's
[1:28:32] among you envying and strife and
[1:28:34] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[1:28:37] men he didn't say you're yet carnal I
[1:28:38] see short short hair and slacks and
[1:28:41] things look that obviously that would be
[1:28:43] carnal yeah but that's not what he said
[1:28:46] yeah he said you're yet carnal not
[1:28:48] because you don't look like a church not
[1:28:50] because you don't look like message
[1:28:52] people but because there's en being
[1:28:54] among you in strife and divisions yes
[1:28:56] sir so you're carnal
[1:29:00] yeah God help me never to go to that
[1:29:02] place amen you're yet carnal I spoke
[1:29:06] here and again we all fight with
[1:29:09] that every one of us fight with it when
[1:29:12] are we going to stop fighting with it
[1:29:13] brother man when we get a new body yeah
[1:29:15] cuz this one never gets converted right
[1:29:18] and I've preached that for years
[1:29:19] something God showed me early on in my
[1:29:21] Ministry we never this never gets
[1:29:23] converted this flesh never does yeah it
[1:29:26] gets controlled yes but never converted
[1:29:29] till we go home the fullness of adoption
[1:29:31] true is the Redemption of our body yes
[1:29:35] oh my but the soul is
[1:29:37] redeemed now listen what brother BR said
[1:29:42] and and I want to take this and I know
[1:29:44] some people say well brother BR preached
[1:29:45] about love in the 50s but not after the
[1:29:48] opening the word that's wrong right you
[1:29:50] just haven't looked enough at the
[1:29:52] message brother brandom all these quotes
[1:29:54] now I'm going to read here at the end
[1:29:56] the the the ones I have remaining are
[1:29:59] from the opening of the word he said as
[1:30:00] I spoke here not long ago I believe was
[1:30:02] at the Tabernacle God is so great he can
[1:30:04] become so simple he said now when we get
[1:30:06] so great we can't be simple we know too
[1:30:08] much and we get to oh it's just got to
[1:30:10] be this way the way we say it or it
[1:30:13] isn't at all come on now well that way
[1:30:16] we miss God come
[1:30:18] on I wonder how many times we've missed
[1:30:21] God cuz we thought it has to be this way
[1:30:24] the way we say it or it isn't at all
[1:30:29] that oh I don't want to miss God I need
[1:30:31] God I need him we need him for the
[1:30:33] healing of our children we need him for
[1:30:35] the healing of our elders we need him
[1:30:37] for uh to move among us we need sou come
[1:30:39] on church we need the shout of the king
[1:30:41] in the camp we need the presence of God
[1:30:43] Among Us how we going to have it we we
[1:30:45] miss God when we begin to say oh it's my
[1:30:47] way or the highway come on right we miss
[1:30:50] him yes we don't see his presence
[1:30:54] working his control his love for the
[1:30:56] church good yes like balum we see the
[1:30:59] hinder parts and we don't see the shout
[1:31:01] of the king we don't see a brass serpent
[1:31:04] yeah we failed to see an atonement yes
[1:31:06] oh God help me today brother brandom
[1:31:08] talked about how he got so critical as a
[1:31:09] minister he got to the point where he
[1:31:11] couldn't he couldn't he couldn't treat
[1:31:14] the people maybe in in just the right
[1:31:16] way in his heart he still treated people
[1:31:18] right even during that time but he got
[1:31:20] in his heart he got he got up he got
[1:31:23] upset almost was angry he got he got a
[1:31:26] complex he said because people he kept
[1:31:28] preaching and people kept doing it he
[1:31:30] called him Ricky and retes and the angel
[1:31:32] told him not to do that not to do that
[1:31:35] why he said those are there's some of
[1:31:37] God's sheep in there yeah and you've
[1:31:39] been called to be a prophet not a
[1:31:40] prophet St out of the woods somewhere
[1:31:42] but a prophet among the people a prophet
[1:31:45] a prophet that preaches I'm so glad that
[1:31:47] he sted among the people and he preached
[1:31:49] the opening of the word to us what would
[1:31:52] we do without it but but even he got in
[1:31:54] that condition and I have to remind
[1:31:55] myself I don't want to get cynical I
[1:31:57] don't want to get critical come on
[1:31:58] church leaders we need to
[1:32:01] remember what we're doing
[1:32:03] here sometimes you just got to get back
[1:32:05] to the simple joy of a church service
[1:32:08] where the presence of God is moving and
[1:32:10] the people of God are blessed and people
[1:32:12] love one another just a simple joy
[1:32:14] seeing our children at the altar our
[1:32:16] young people getting saved getting
[1:32:18] filled with the spirit the simple joy
[1:32:19] seeing God heal the sick sometimes you
[1:32:21] just got to get back to that and
[1:32:23] recognize said he is able he is able to
[1:32:26] take care of every situation he is able
[1:32:28] we don't want to miss God and all of our
[1:32:31] all of our division and strife and
[1:32:33] everything else we want to be so simple
[1:32:35] that we can understand when God
[1:32:39] comes brother BR said surely after all
[1:32:41] these years on the field around the
[1:32:43] world and seeing different people I
[1:32:44] ought to know I ought to
[1:32:47] know Oh my he said a little bit about
[1:32:49] the gate to enter in at and if you want
[1:32:51] to get somewhere with God never let an
[1:32:53] arrogant spirit Spirit ever come around
[1:32:54] you don't let No Malice come in no
[1:32:56] matter what anyone has done if they're
[1:32:58] wrong don't you never build up a complex
[1:33:00] against that person you'd be sweet and
[1:33:02] kind yeah oh church we don't always
[1:33:06] understand one another we're not always
[1:33:07] going to understand one another but we
[1:33:09] try to we make an attempt and we and we
[1:33:13] commit them to God when we don't
[1:33:16] understand what's going on we commit
[1:33:17] them to God he said remember God loved
[1:33:19] you when you were in sin and the spirit
[1:33:21] of God is in you you love the other
[1:33:23] person when he's in wrong just pray for
[1:33:25] them and love one another above
[1:33:28] everything come on Church what have we
[1:33:30] made the big deal the big thing yeah you
[1:33:34] think about it what have we made a big
[1:33:39] deal I hope you're listening to me now
[1:33:41] yeah well is it how we have
[1:33:45] church or how many songs we sing what
[1:33:48] kind of songs we sing huh I know in
[1:33:51] churches that that's the main thing and
[1:33:54] if you come there and sing a little bit
[1:33:56] different song than what they sing you
[1:33:57] get blasted right right but do that
[1:34:00] become our main focus that ought to be
[1:34:03] part of what we do is sing right songs
[1:34:06] but is that our main focus how you dress
[1:34:09] what you
[1:34:10] do come on church what do he say

[1:34:25] but love one another and be humble with
[1:34:28] God and around one another and God will
[1:34:30] bless us and it's hard telling what he
[1:34:32] will do or if you have a need this
[1:34:34] morning if you just humble yourself
[1:34:36] under the mighty hand of God he will
[1:34:38] exalt you in due time he will provide
[1:34:40] for you he will help you yes Hallelujah

[1:36:20] preaching and and uh and he'd just
[1:36:22] Mumble and and brother Billy Paul
[1:36:24] finally told brother brandom he said you
[1:36:25] know he said every time you preach
[1:36:27] brother Bosworth mumbles the whole
[1:36:28] service and what what he said I don't
[1:36:30] know what he's doing and and brother BR
[1:36:32] said I'll ask him and so he asked him
[1:36:34] said brother Bosworth he said why do you
[1:36:35] why do you Mumble while I preach and he
[1:36:37] said oh he said I'm not mumbling he said

[1:36:51] he'd be cast out and that's what brother
[1:36:53] bosw was saying is that he knew every
[1:36:55] time he come across the platform he'd be
[1:36:57] he'd be cast out oh the old Devil's dumb
[1:36:59] isn't he we don't want to be dumber than
[1:37:01] the devil we want to know we can make it
[1:37:04] we are going to make it would you ever
[1:37:06] think anything else
[1:37:11] yes let no evil come in your mind and
[1:37:13] you're thinking just dismiss it if it
[1:37:14] knocks on the door take it away just
[1:37:17] show your token just keep walking I am
[1:37:19] under the blood keep walking keep in
[1:37:21] stamp he says I am under under the
[1:37:24] blood we ought to honor one another
[1:37:27] respect one another brother sister and
[1:37:28] love one another with Undying
[1:37:30] Love now I've heard this
[1:37:33] before and you don't have to raise your
[1:37:35] hand but I know some of you have said it
[1:37:36] well I just
[1:37:38] can't and to the Millennials that became
[1:37:40] a full
[1:37:42] sentence well I just
[1:37:46] can't and then now the the Next
[1:37:49] Generation you know they have their own
[1:37:51] language but this was something that we
[1:37:54] said you know when I was younger and
[1:37:55] those a little bit younger than me we
[1:37:57] just
[1:37:58] can't and it just meant you were
[1:38:01] done well brother brandom said well I
[1:38:03] just can't well just stay
[1:38:06] here a little longer if you go back in
[1:38:09] that sermon you'll find out I think
[1:38:10] context is important you'll find out
[1:38:12] brother Brand's preaching about being in
[1:38:13] the presence of God he's preaching the
[1:38:15] sermon God in his
[1:38:17] presence or being in the presence of God
[1:38:19] come about Isaiah how he was in the
[1:38:21] presence of God and you say you say I
[1:38:23] just can't love one another we just
[1:38:25] can't love one another with undying love
[1:38:26] I just can't I just can't brother Ben I
[1:38:28] I just can't I can't do it well just
[1:38:31] stay
[1:38:32] hereen why cuz in the presence of God
[1:38:35] you begin to be like Isaiah and you
[1:38:37] begin to realize I'm a man of unclean
[1:38:39] lips and I live among a people of
[1:38:40] unclean Li Lord cleanse us and set us
[1:38:42] aside for
[1:38:44] service said stay here in the presence
[1:38:46] of God stay here in the in the sanctuary
[1:38:49] for a minute and find out you begin he
[1:38:51] said then you will like people too
[1:38:57] you'll love those who doesn't love you
[1:39:00] said that's really a good sign of
[1:39:01] Christianity when you can from your
[1:39:02] heart love those who does not love you I
[1:39:05] know people are making degrees of of
[1:39:07] love you love this one this much and
[1:39:08] this one that much and I understand we
[1:39:10] have different obligations we love our
[1:39:12] families maybe in a little bit different
[1:39:13] way than we love everybody else but we
[1:39:16] ought to love the
[1:39:17] unlovable with a gape love and you can't
[1:39:19] get any higher love than that
[1:39:24] we should long to be
[1:39:26] together uh this is a prophet teaching
[1:39:28] towards the end of his ministry he said
[1:39:31] as we see the great end time signs in
[1:39:33] the earth warning us the time is at hand
[1:39:36] we should love one another
[1:39:39] more someone say more than we ever did
[1:39:43] in all our
[1:39:47] lives you said brother Ben you preach it
[1:39:49] but but I want to see it I want to see
[1:39:51] it too but if we don't preach it how we
[1:39:54] ever going to see it
[1:39:55] yeah I believe we see some of it I
[1:39:58] believe you're a church that loves one
[1:39:59] another but we want to see more we want
[1:40:01] to encourage you in that I want to
[1:40:03] encourage myself in that
[1:40:05] yes we should love one another more
[1:40:08] there should be such a hunger to get to
[1:40:13] church let me just deal with this a
[1:40:15] little bit because in our hearts
[1:40:16] sometimes we we get well it doesn't
[1:40:19] matter we come in when it's convenient
[1:40:21] yeah but I I'm not preaching at you for
[1:40:23] not coming to church but there we should
[1:40:25] examine ourselves ourselves and see is
[1:40:29] there a hunger to be there cuz some
[1:40:30] people can't ever come yeah they have a
[1:40:33] difficult time even getting through the
[1:40:34] door and yet they want to be yeah they
[1:40:37] want to be in church I know there's
[1:40:39] people that stream the service that
[1:40:40] would love to be here and sit where you
[1:40:42] sit and they just can't do it and
[1:40:44] there's people in all different parts of
[1:40:46] the world that sometimes watch churches
[1:40:48] in America and they would love to be
[1:40:49] there maybe in their part of the world
[1:40:51] there's no church or nowhere to go and
[1:40:52] they do that that's their way or or they
[1:40:54] just listen to tapes and that that would
[1:40:55] be fine that's all they can do but when
[1:40:58] we can get together that we should get
[1:41:01] together that's a prophet of God saying
[1:41:04] this not me right look what he said
[1:41:06] there should be such a hunger to get to
[1:41:08] church and you say Well church can be
[1:41:10] just me and myself and my family that's
[1:41:12] not what he said there should be such a
[1:41:14] hunger for us to get to one another
[1:41:17] right
[1:41:18] amen it should be a love affair right
[1:41:22] and Illustrated that about how he wanted
[1:41:24] to be in Tucson with his wife and the
[1:41:27] longing and the hunger that he had to be
[1:41:28] with his wife in Tucson because they
[1:41:31] didn't he didn't like to be apart from
[1:41:32] her for a long period of time he said
[1:41:34] that's the way the church ought to be
[1:41:36] just seeing that the power of God what
[1:41:38] it's done for us we should be counting
[1:41:40] the moments yes getting together in love
[1:41:44] yes oh it's three
[1:41:48] days 10 hours 29 minutes and 13 seconds
[1:41:53] till we get together do you know these
[1:41:54] kids have more of a revelation of that
[1:41:55] than some of us adults
[1:41:58] do now you know that some of y'all are
[1:42:01] here cuz your kids kind of drive you you
[1:42:03] know they want to be together God help
[1:42:06] us to be like little
[1:42:08] children in this way to want to be
[1:42:11] together right we get older we get our
[1:42:13] routines and it's okay to have aone time
[1:42:15] I'm not telling you you can never have a
[1:42:16] long time but when we do have an
[1:42:18] opportunity to come together shouldn't
[1:42:20] we hunger to be together shouldn't we h
[1:42:23] to be something in our hearts that says
[1:42:24] God I just want to be around those of
[1:42:26] like Precious faith I just want to
[1:42:28] fellowship with them for a minute what
[1:42:30] is that hunger it's a it's a desire for
[1:42:32] Fellowship that was in the mind of God
[1:42:34] it's an attribute of the Divine that was
[1:42:36] in God before the foundation of the
[1:42:38] world by the that you want to be around
[1:42:40] God's people there's something you just
[1:42:42] want to be and sometimes we can't be in
[1:42:45] modern society it gets very difficult I
[1:42:47] understand that but we want to be
[1:42:49] together counting the moments getting
[1:42:52] together in love that we can fly away
[1:42:54] someday to meet
[1:42:57] Jesus said we have assembled
[1:43:01] here no I'm I'm closing here in just a
[1:43:03] moment but I just want to deal with this
[1:43:06] and let you know what a prophet taught
[1:43:07] about these things he said we have
[1:43:09] assembled here no Lord not for some
[1:43:12] great glory to be known as Leaders or an
[1:43:14] official of something great we're just
[1:43:16] here as humble Believers we're here
[1:43:18] because we love you how many come to
[1:43:20] church because you love the Lord we're
[1:43:21] here because we love you and we love one
[1:43:24] another and as we see each other and as
[1:43:27] we congregate together we find that it
[1:43:30] seems to be more of God don't you want
[1:43:33] more of God I want more of God not less
[1:43:35] of God why would I tell people to
[1:43:37] separate come on why would I tell people
[1:43:39] not to congregate yeah I want more more
[1:43:44] that's why it's such a hard decision
[1:43:45] sometimes for safety reasons we have to
[1:43:46] cancel church or maybe a bunch of people
[1:43:48] are going to be out of town we want to
[1:43:49] be considerate to one another right and
[1:43:51] sometimes we cancel we have to cancel
[1:43:53] but as a pastor I want us to be together
[1:43:55] more more what did Paul say assemble
[1:43:57] yourselves together more as we see the
[1:43:59] day approaching I'm not going to have a
[1:44:00] bunch more services but let's when we do
[1:44:02] come together let's take advantage of it
[1:44:04] Church be together
[1:44:06] more and when we are it be it brings
[1:44:09] more of God yes I want more of God not
[1:44:11] less of God that's simple math
[1:44:15] [Laughter]
[1:44:18] right Jesus said if you'll do this in my
[1:44:20] name I'll be in your midst sister Betty
[1:44:22] was telling me the birthday party
[1:44:23] yesterday how that she longs to be in
[1:44:25] church she always wants to be in church
[1:44:27] and her kids her children testified to
[1:44:29] me of the faithfulness in her heart to
[1:44:30] be in the house of God when she can't be
[1:44:33] here she she sits at home and streams
[1:44:34] the service I say thank the Lord for
[1:44:37] that thank the Lord for those that want
[1:44:39] to be to have a hunger maybe you can't
[1:44:41] always be here but there's something in
[1:44:42] your heart hunger to be in the house of
[1:44:45] God oh that's what draws us together but
[1:44:47] JT we've had many differences and things
[1:44:49] that have come up over the years there's
[1:44:50] been many things maybe we we didn't see
[1:44:53] I eye or disagreed about but one thing
[1:44:54] was the same we wanted to be together
[1:44:56] because we're the same Faith one Lord
[1:44:58] One Faith one baptism there many things
[1:45:01] we might disagree about but we still
[1:45:02] come
[1:45:03] together why there's something Divine in
[1:45:07] that in the unity of the bride all
[1:45:10] marching together marching to one step
[1:45:12] of the
[1:45:13] word oh my see each one believer symbols
[1:45:17] in one certain place what did that say
[1:45:20] it seems to be more of God gathers
[1:45:22] together as each believer assembles
[1:45:25] himself in one certain place yeah well
[1:45:30] we can't do that every week we can't
[1:45:31] have meetings with all the churches but
[1:45:33] we can go to our church
[1:45:35] yeah right when we have meetings we love
[1:45:37] that we love the fellowship but we can
[1:45:39] go to our
[1:45:40] church in one certain place and Jesus
[1:45:44] said if you'll do this in my name I'll
[1:45:46] be in your midst and we know that you
[1:45:49] are here hallelujah brother Brandon said
[1:45:52] this he said we should love one another
[1:45:54] during this time all right the church
[1:45:57] and the believer should be unseparable
[1:46:00] that's good
[1:46:03] unseparable again brother BR said my
[1:46:05] little children as Paul would have said
[1:46:06] not trying to impersonate him but the
[1:46:08] love I love you I storm the roads and
[1:46:10] everything else to get here to get to
[1:46:11] speak with you come up out of the desert
[1:46:13] across the snow drift to get here we fly
[1:46:15] in Planes you drive across the country
[1:46:17] we can get together we love one another
[1:46:19] uh someone asked me I think it was
[1:46:20] Melody asked me if brother Brandon was
[1:46:22] here
[1:46:23] and was had a meeting how far would you
[1:46:25] go to hear him preach I said well it
[1:46:26] wouldn't
[1:46:29] matter is there anybody else here like
[1:46:31] that yeah for me it wouldn't matter like
[1:46:34] that'd be my one opportunity right to
[1:46:36] hear him preach and In the Flesh and I
[1:46:39] would just go I'd drop everything and go
[1:46:41] I'd sell everything I had to sell and
[1:46:42] and I'm being honest with you yeah I'd
[1:46:44] go yeah huh I would go and so I I I
[1:46:49] would I would want that and maybe that's
[1:46:51] why God he had to leave the seen we had
[1:46:53] to become a mature bride and all over
[1:46:56] the world and be Witnesses in our own
[1:46:58] communities maybe we'd all just gathered
[1:47:00] around him but I would want to I I would
[1:47:02] drive across the country I I'd do
[1:47:04] everything I could just to honor him him
[1:47:07] being there yeah everything I could it
[1:47:09] wouldn't matter the distance right but
[1:47:11] should shouldn't we love one another
[1:47:13] yeah shouldn't this message bring more
[1:47:15] we I love the messenger but shouldn't it
[1:47:17] bring more than just a love for the
[1:47:18] messenger shouldn't it bring a love for
[1:47:20] one another yeah
[1:47:24] he said we love one another he said
[1:47:25] we're part of one another don't you
[1:47:27] never let Satan tell you anything else
[1:47:29] listen to me Church he'll try to but
[1:47:31] don't you never let Satan tell you you
[1:47:33] don't need to be together right that's
[1:47:35] what he's telling us don't you never let
[1:47:37] Satan tell you anything else being a
[1:47:40] part of one another we're part of him
[1:47:41] and we are fellow citizens of the
[1:47:43] Kingdom enjoying these blessings
[1:47:44] together of the
[1:47:46] Resurrection again he said don't take
[1:47:48] some new thing they're flying everywhere
[1:47:50] there'll be more than that come don't
[1:47:52] take these new things but the Lord God
[1:47:53] has declared to you what is truth the
[1:47:54] Lord your God has Vindicated what is
[1:47:56] Truth by his word and by his Spirit not
[1:47:58] by power not by mind but by my spirit he
[1:48:01] said God seeks those who worship Him in
[1:48:02] spirit of truth I'm hurrying now to
[1:48:03] close he said Thy word is true and he
[1:48:05] has thoroughly Vindicated that Jesus
[1:48:07] Christ is the same yesterday day and
[1:48:09] forever he has showed the evening seeds
[1:48:10] to you he's revealed it to you in the
[1:48:12] word he's proven it to you by his Spirit
[1:48:13] don't never start or try an organization
[1:48:16] don't try to build upon anything else
[1:48:17] but stay humble before the Lord your God
[1:48:19] for it looks like the gates may open
[1:48:21] into the Promised Land soon then let us
[1:48:23] go in with true singing and rejoicing
[1:48:26] when the bride and the groom takes its
[1:48:27] place at the
[1:48:29] throne live humble live loving love one
[1:48:32] another don't ever get nothing among you
[1:48:33] if you see something coming up in your
[1:48:35] heart against somebody get it out of
[1:48:36] there right then Satan will do his best
[1:48:38] to get among you you let that happen
[1:48:41] some sick Tong fellow might come along
[1:48:42] try to take you away from it said but
[1:48:44] you think they could talk Moses out of
[1:48:46] the presence of God we had stood there
[1:48:47] and seen it no sir said we don't take
[1:48:51] from it or add to it just keep it the
[1:48:52] way the Lord said we don't want no
[1:48:54] denomination we don't want no
[1:48:55] organization we don't want no malice we
[1:48:57] don't want no Strife we want God how
[1:48:59] many wants God today and he is the
[1:49:02] word as I've already said what if this
[1:49:05] is what we're waiting on yeah I don't
[1:49:09] say that it's all I think all of us
[1:49:11] maybe are at a different place but as a
[1:49:13] whole what if this is
[1:49:16] it what if that next step we just step
[1:49:20] on
[1:49:21] out it may not appear like it but we've
[1:49:24] been going up cuz the bride doesn't go
[1:49:27] down we passed the review stand going up
[1:49:31] yes
[1:49:33] amen what if this is the
[1:49:36] last step
[1:49:39] yeah and we finally get
[1:49:43] it and we get it and suddenly there it
[1:49:47] is sweep comes over you
[1:49:51] and you you're you're you're
[1:49:53] predestinated to the Rapture the Rapture
[1:49:54] may be on any day it could be you
[1:49:56] washing the dishes or yelling at your
[1:49:58] kids
[1:50:01] and doing figures at the bank Could
[1:50:04] Happen anytime yes but maybe you don't
[1:50:08] even realize it but in the under the
[1:50:09] preaching under the washing of the water
[1:50:11] of the word under the message of the
[1:50:12] hour suddenly you get it
[1:50:17] yeah see part of the process of maturity
[1:50:20] and ripening is tindering
[1:50:22] yes
[1:50:24] tendering getting tender the the seed
[1:50:27] have you ever noticed that the shuck
[1:50:29] gets brittle hard divides from the grain
[1:50:34] right but the but the wheat gets more
[1:50:37] tender the more ripe it is so when it's
[1:50:41] perfectly ripe any kind of seed or any
[1:50:43] kind of any kind of uh plant any kind of
[1:50:46] fruit what do you want you want that
[1:50:48] ripe orange I like oranges I like
[1:50:50] mangoes but I don't like unripe mango
[1:50:53] mangos that they're terrible a right
[1:50:56] mango is some of one of the best things
[1:50:58] in the world but but an unra mangle
[1:51:01] terrible just awful what is it it's the
[1:51:04] same thing with god with with the word
[1:51:07] with the bride listen an unrip Bride Can
[1:51:10] can actually make God sick look at what
[1:51:13] happened to leosia he said you're
[1:51:14] lukewarm and I'll spew you out of my
[1:51:16] mouth but we want the message to bring
[1:51:19] us to
[1:51:21] ripeness and part of that is tenderizing
[1:51:24] yeah brother said Church we're teaching
[1:51:26] now but remember when you leave here
[1:51:27] start moving out of the shuck you're
[1:51:29] going into the grain but lay in the
[1:51:31] presence of the son don't add what I
[1:51:33] said don't take away what I said I speak
[1:51:34] the truth as far as I know it his father
[1:51:36] has given to me don't add to it just say
[1:51:38] what I said the thing of it is just tell
[1:51:39] the people to come seek the Lord Jesus
[1:51:42] is that what we want to do we don't want
[1:51:44] to present one Doctrine or another let's
[1:51:45] tell them to come seek the Lord Jesus
[1:51:48] and then you yourself lay right in his
[1:51:49] presence just make love to him oh Lord
[1:51:51] Jesus Son of God I love you tender My
[1:51:55] Heart Lord take away all the filth and
[1:51:57] the love of the world let me live holy
[1:51:58] in this present world before you can we
[1:52:00] do that this morning
[1:52:02] church
[1:52:03] Hallelujah musicians go ahead and come
[1:52:06] brother said I believe the church is
[1:52:08] beginning to hear the message begin to
[1:52:10] understand begin to understand but
[1:52:14] friends listen we've got to lay in the
[1:52:17] presence of the
[1:52:18] sun we've got to be ripened our faith
[1:52:21] isn't ripe
[1:52:23] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:52:24] that God has given us and seeing the
[1:52:26] signs that he showed us proving it by
[1:52:29] the Bible is there but oh how the church
[1:52:32] needs to lay in his
[1:52:34] presence till it tenders
[1:52:37] up and get sweet in the spirit yes so it
[1:52:41] can bathe
[1:52:42] down we love Revival we want to be in
[1:52:45] Revival we believe in the bride's
[1:52:47] Revival we can participate in all the
[1:52:49] time yes we believe in that yeah but
[1:52:52] many times when you're in an outward of
[1:52:54] Revival you know that that's joy and
[1:52:57] rejoicing and we want that but that's
[1:52:59] not what tenders you it's the heat of
[1:53:01] the word that's to go along with the
[1:53:04] moisture of the latter rain and the and
[1:53:06] the spirit of God that comes down but
[1:53:08] it's the heat of the word that brings
[1:53:09] you to that full maturity and sometimes
[1:53:12] I know and it just this thought occurs
[1:53:15] to me but I know you struggle with
[1:53:16] things and you go through things and and
[1:53:18] and you have real trouble yeah real
[1:53:21] trouble
[1:53:23] he said God why did you do this to me
[1:53:25] why why
[1:53:27] me and how many times would I look at
[1:53:30] that little baby and pray for them as I
[1:53:31] did for gab millenia's little baby Lizzy
[1:53:34] Joe and hold her in my arms and it's
[1:53:35] hard not to feel for that family as I
[1:53:38] holding her in my arms and praying for
[1:53:41] her and thinking what if that was us and
[1:53:44] dealing with that how and thinking my
[1:53:46] own babies and how we used to check make
[1:53:48] sure they were
[1:53:49] breathing and I'm I'm sitting there
[1:53:51] thinking about that that and wondering
[1:53:53] God why you know I went and prayed for
[1:53:55] her she got better it seemed like and
[1:53:56] then and then they had to go to the
[1:53:58] hospital anyway and it seemed like she
[1:53:59] had another episode this morning she was
[1:54:02] better and I thought God why why don't
[1:54:05] sometimes you just take these things
[1:54:06] away from me I believe he can do that
[1:54:08] how many believe in the Supernatural
[1:54:09] power of
[1:54:10] God but sometimes he's I think he's
[1:54:13] working on
[1:54:15] us he's working on us we get tender when
[1:54:19] we go through some things
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:24] and I look back and I there was a time
[1:54:25] when I would have traded my life with
[1:54:27] just about anybody but I look back
[1:54:29] brother Daniel now and I think about
[1:54:31] what I've been through and I think I'm
[1:54:32] glad that I went through what I went
[1:54:34] through and come the path that I did and
[1:54:36] every one of you got your own story you
[1:54:38] got your own background you got your own
[1:54:40] life and someday you're going to be able
[1:54:42] to see past some clouds and be able to
[1:54:44] see that was God working all you could
[1:54:46] see was the clouds but there were angel
[1:54:48] wings beating together in the background
[1:54:52] and you look at those moments when you
[1:54:53] lost a dear loved one or something
[1:54:55] happened somebody died too young
[1:54:56] somebody got sick or you lost everything
[1:54:59] went bankrupt everything went wrong
[1:55:01] you're going to look back at that one
[1:55:03] day and you're going to say God I thank
[1:55:04] you for those moments I thank you for
[1:55:07] letting me trust you a little bit I
[1:55:09] thank you that the answer didn't come
[1:55:10] too soon because that's what made me
[1:55:13] tender that's what made me
[1:55:16] sweet so what made me
[1:55:19] love I didn't understand what people
[1:55:21] were going through until I went through
[1:55:22] some of it
[1:55:24] myself and then suddenly I I got
[1:55:28] it I'm not I'm not preaching the days of
[1:55:30] Miracles of past or anything like that I
[1:55:32] believe in miracles but sometimes God
[1:55:34] lets us tender up and just said are you
[1:55:38] going to believe me like you did to
[1:55:39] Abraham are you going to believe me are
[1:55:40] you going to believe me when your body's
[1:55:42] dead are you going to believe me no
[1:55:43] matter what happens when your wife is
[1:55:45] old are you going to believe me Abraham
[1:55:47] and Abraham said though he slay me yet
[1:55:48] I'll trust him job said though he slay
[1:55:50] me yet I'll trust him I
[1:55:54] believe
[1:55:56] Hallelujah thanks for that
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:01] Buddy b said sometimes in speaking the
[1:56:03] message you get harsh there's time for
[1:56:06] that there's time we have to say things
[1:56:09] you have to break it in like that
[1:56:10] because you got to clinch a nail to make
[1:56:11] it hold but when the church wants gets
[1:56:17] it the elected is called out and
[1:56:20] separated then in the presence of God I
[1:56:24] know it'll be something like the people
[1:56:26] was there when it takes the Rapture what
[1:56:29] was it there go back and look he said
[1:56:31] only perfect love only perfect love can
[1:56:34] enter there he said whatever you
[1:56:36] do get that perfect
[1:56:39] love perfect love for God perfect love
[1:56:41] for his word perfect love for one
[1:56:44] another
[1:56:45] maybe that's what God's doing now maybe
[1:56:47] we're being perfected now maybe he's
[1:56:49] doing more than we realize right now
[1:56:52] he's working just let him work let's be
[1:56:55] humble little children as John said love
[1:56:58] one another lay in the presence of the
[1:57:00] Sun the brother brand in one place said
[1:57:01] the wheat is here the fullness of the
[1:57:04] word is here the seals have been open
[1:57:06] let's cry out in humility Lord manifest
[1:57:08] the word in my life let me be a portion
[1:57:11] of that United bride I want so badly if
[1:57:14] you just see it in my in my mind and my
[1:57:16] heart like I I've been seeing it myself
[1:57:19] I want so badly to be represented by
[1:57:21] that bride that he saw I want to be one
[1:57:23] that was walking in harmony I don't want
[1:57:24] to be one that was out of Step I want to
[1:57:26] be one that was watching the message of
[1:57:28] the hour walking in harmony with the
[1:57:30] word going up that's what I want to be
[1:57:33] every day getting better every day
[1:57:35] getting more tender every day getting
[1:57:36] more mature oh granted Lord would that
