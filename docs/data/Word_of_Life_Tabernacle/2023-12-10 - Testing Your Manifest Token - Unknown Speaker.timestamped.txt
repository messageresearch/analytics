[36:18] him if he's been good to you and if he's
[36:21] worthy of it then we ought to do it do
[36:23] you believe that this morning you know I
[36:25] I think sometimes we we we think that
[36:27] lifting our hands is for other people to
[36:29] see but it's not that at all lifting
[36:32] your hands is a sign of
[36:34] surrender all that I am I give to you I
[36:38] don't care what anybody thinks about me
[36:40] I don't care if they laugh at My Worship
[36:43] I'm worshiping God it doesn't matter
[36:44] what anybody else says so I wonder this
[36:46] morning if we could really just Worship
[36:49] the Lord I know sometimes it's hard to
[36:51] break through because you've had a long
[36:52] week and you get tired but sometimes I
[36:55] think we need to just realize that he's
[36:58] worthy he deserves us just putting aside
[37:00] our daily our daily worry and and things
[37:04] and just giving it All to Jesus this
[37:05] morning I wonder if we could do that

[46:00] morning amen let's just turn the
[46:02] scriptures to First John 2 and 14 just
[46:05] kind of a privilege to be here to speak
[46:07] this morning and it's been a little bit
[46:09] so we'll just try to try to get back in
[46:11] the groove here this
[46:13] morning just kind of pick up a thought
[46:15] that we had uh a while back just still
[46:18] kind of um looking at worship under
[46:20] Redemption and just the thought that I
[46:23] that I had of of rejecting and then
[46:25] overcoming the LIE of the
[46:28] devil amen 1
[46:31] John 2
[46:33] and4 I have written unto you fathers
[46:35] because you have known him that is from
[46:37] the beginning and I have written unto
[46:39] you young men because you are strong and
[46:41] the word of God abideth in you and you
[46:44] have overcome the wicked one amen it
[46:47] says here love not the world neither the
[46:49] things of the world that are in the
[46:51] world if any man love the world the love
[46:54] of the father is not in him for all that
[46:57] is in the world the lust of the Flesh
[46:59] and the lust of the eyes the pride of
[47:01] life is not of the father but it is of
[47:03] the world the world passeth away in the
[47:06] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[47:08] of God abideth forever amen you could be
[47:12] seated this morning just pray that God
[47:14] would add His blessings to his word here
[47:19] today brother random said he said what
[47:22] is a lie it's the truth misre presented
[47:26] it's a perversion of what is true right
[47:30] right yes and so amen we've been called
[47:33] to be Overcomers in this age and and the
[47:36] word the word here says that they had
[47:40] overcome the wicked one the word of God
[47:42] uh uh was abiding in them and they were
[47:45] strong and that they had overcome the
[47:48] wicked one amen and and when the word is
[47:51] in you that's where your strength comes
[47:54] from yes amen minute and that's what it
[47:56] takes to overcome the world that's what
[47:58] it takes to to overcome daily struggles
[48:01] and it takes not just just taking uh a
[48:04] scripture though though that's that's
[48:06] that's part of it but that that's
[48:09] something that word has to be in you
[48:11] come on Amen you have to be a part of
[48:14] the word or you can never really fully
[48:16] benefit you can never really take it and
[48:19] use it the way you're supposed to and
[48:21] that's the purpose of of being borned
[48:24] again because this old nature will never
[48:27] overcome the world so this old Nature
[48:30] has to die out and me there has to be a
[48:33] birth that takes place it's a word birth
[48:37] and me the word has to abide in you it's
[48:39] not just something that you read and
[48:41] something that you can intellectually
[48:43] understand amen but you are a part of
[48:45] the word because you're born
[48:48] again and so this world Amen love not
[48:52] the world nor the things of the world if
[48:53] you love it the love of the father is
[48:55] not not in you amen there has to be a
[48:57] love for the truth there has to be a
[48:59] love for the things of God can you say
[49:02] am man it has to be it has to be greater
[49:04] than than this world and and the things
[49:06] that it
[49:09] offers and you look at you look at this
[49:12] world and the confusion that it's in and
[49:15] so the word takes away the confusion the
[49:18] word takes away the error it takes away
[49:21] amen any any doubt any unbelief amen it
[49:25] takes away that confusion that that this
[49:27] world is in this present world that
[49:29] we're in amen that's good so you you
[49:32] have to be you have to be changed you
[49:35] have to be there has to be something
[49:37] that takes place to be able to overcome
[49:40] the world because we're born in sin
[49:43] we're shaped in iniquity and and then
[49:46] the Bible says that we come into the
[49:47] world speaking lies right so there has
[49:50] to be something Amen to that that
[49:53] overrules amen where where we would
[49:55] speak lies where we would speak negative
[49:58] amen the word has to take place amen
[50:00] that it can come
[50:02] forth amen and give us the victory
[50:04] because faith is the victory that
[50:06] overcomes the
[50:10] world Amen you're a new creation the old
[50:13] things are passed away and all things
[50:15] are become new that that's what it takes
[50:17] to overcome the LIE of the devil this
[50:20] old nature that we were borned in we
[50:23] didn't have no say in it come on and
[50:25] brother said we we read that quote that
[50:28] that Adam sold us out yeah Adam sold us
[50:31] out and we were in the pawn shell but
[50:33] but it took Christ to come and redeem us
[50:35] amen so so that that Redemption has to
[50:38] take place you come here you you were
[50:40] born in sin there's nothing you could do
[50:41] about it but God has made a way for us
[50:44] to have the victory here today I believe
[50:47] that I don't believe we have to succumb
[50:49] to the to the confusion of lead DEA I
[50:52] don't believe we have to live Amen in a
[50:54] state of mind where we don't we don't
[50:55] know who we are but the word has come
[50:58] there's a birth that can take place and
[51:00] if you'll just surrender to it amen
[51:03] don't go on don't go on in this life
[51:05] trying to do it yourself you'll never
[51:07] have victory in this life unless that
[51:09] word Birth has taken place
[51:13] good so we look at
[51:16] Jesus Jesus overcame by the
[51:19] word and we we've been kind of looking
[51:22] at that that Redemption is bringing us
[51:24] at what Adam and Eve fell from
[51:26] Redemption is bringing us back to the
[51:28] position that they fell from but we see
[51:31] here Jesus overcame by the word and
[51:33] brother Ram says here he says Eve fell
[51:35] to the personal Temptation Of Satan by
[51:38] failing to use the word she was
[51:41] fortified Satan came but she failed to
[51:44] use the word the fortification that God
[51:47] gave her and so Adam not being deceived
[51:50] in the transgression stepped out he fell
[51:53] in direct Disobedience to the the word
[51:56] he stepped out right so God wouldn't
[51:58] destroy Eve he took her sin upon
[52:01] himself he was not deceived he was a Son
[52:03] of God but Jesus overcame by the word
[52:06] and he says and right now let me say
[52:07] that is the only way to be an overcomer
[52:10] also it is the only way to know that you
[52:12] are overcoming because the word Can't
[52:15] Fail amen heavens and earth will pass
[52:18] away amen our ideas our doctrines and
[52:21] our our good Solutions and amen and and
[52:24] and our our best efforts it's going to
[52:26] pass away but if you'll take the word if
[52:28] you'll take it in your heart amen and
[52:30] you'll bind it amen and and let it not
[52:32] forsake you amen but you'll take that
[52:34] word amen it will
[52:36] conquer every enemy here
[52:39] today good so we're being under
[52:43] Redemption we're going back we're being
[52:44] restored back we're being redeemed back
[52:47] Amen to our original
[52:49] position ad Adam and Eve disfellowship
[52:53] themselves by the believing the LIE of
[52:56] the devil right they separated
[52:58] themselves from their Union with God
[53:02] they were in a position to never die
[53:04] yeah right to never be sick to never
[53:06] have to worry amen but under Redemption
[53:09] don't make me just amen myself here
[53:11] today okay and you're not I'm just Lord
[53:15] help
[53:17] me they were in a position to never die
[53:20] never be sick never have to worry but
[53:23] under Redemption under the fullness of
[53:25] the word amen we are restored to our
[53:29] position by an atoning bleeding word you
[53:33] have an atonement this morning and that
[53:35] word atonement means to make you one
[53:38] again there's something that that
[53:40] destroyed that
[53:42] cm it's not just a blood of a of a of a
[53:45] natural lamb but there's a bleeding word
[53:47] here today there's a bleeding word
[53:50] that's been made available Amen to make
[53:52] you and God want again to restore that
[53:54] Union that Fellowship back if you can
[53:57] reject the LIE of the devil here today
[54:00] don't let him put nothing on you don't
[54:02] let him don't let him take away the
[54:04] effect of the word today amen don't
[54:06] don't don't con let your mind be
[54:08] consumed with with the confusion and the
[54:10] thoughts of this world that he would try
[54:12] to inject because there is a word here
[54:15] today and you'll surrender to it not to
[54:17] a man not to a preacher amen but if
[54:19] you'll respond to the presence of God
[54:22] here today as the word Goes Forth amen
[54:24] you can you can be
[54:28] changed amen we can say Amen though
[54:31] those that have been born again you knew
[54:33] you couldn't do it on your own you knew
[54:35] you tried but when you surrendered when
[54:38] you surrendered Amen to what you knew
[54:40] was right and thank God there was a
[54:43] there's been some men of God that's put
[54:45] forth the word of God Amen that's
[54:47] preached salvation amen correctly let's
[54:50] preach amen the message of the hour amen
[54:52] and and and and not try to interpret it
[54:55] themselves amen because that's what it's
[54:57] going to take amen we we don't want no
[54:59] water down amen man interpreted gospel
[55:02] message amen but God has given us amen a
[55:05] message amen a revealed word sir Lord
[55:08] help me to keep my voice here today amen
[55:11] he's given us a word that will correct
[55:13] every error that will remove the LIE of
[55:17] the enemy off your life
[55:19] right to bring us
[55:23] back amen and so just as that Eve we've
[55:26] said this before just as that Eve was
[55:28] predestinated to fall there's a bride
[55:30] here today that will take the word that
[55:33] will surrender to everything that God
[55:35] has for her me because she is
[55:38] predestinated to stand predestinated to
[55:40] not fall amen and take what the word
[55:45] says reject the LIE of the devil yes cuz
[55:49] he's going to try to put something on
[55:50] you he going to try to put whatever he
[55:53] can upon your life yeah
[55:55] right to try to if he can just cause you
[55:58] to doubt just a little bit he just wants
[56:01] you to disbelieve just one little
[56:03] bit and then and then he's not going to
[56:05] stop there if he can cause you doubt
[56:08] just a little bit he'll consume you with
[56:10] doubt he'll consume you with unbelief
[56:12] but the objective is is to stay
[56:14] fortified behind the word to stay stay
[56:17] in your position we've been brought back
[56:20] we've been brought back under the
[56:21] revealed word amen we're not we're not
[56:23] walking in darkness we're not walking in
[56:25] confusion amen but there's been a voice
[56:27] to call us out of that confusion come
[56:29] out of the world come out of her my
[56:31] people and I say this morning amen we're
[56:34] we're not just listening to the voice of
[56:36] brother brandom when you hear that voice
[56:38] that is God speaking to you you've got
[56:40] to look Beyond the Veil of that man you
[56:44] got to look Beyond the Veil of brother

[57:19] that secret place amen it's just you and
[57:22] God than you Lord all other voices are
[57:24] bed out every every voice of Satan every
[57:28] devil every
[57:30] imp everything that he would try to put
[57:32] on you in that place if you can come
[57:34] into that place into that Fellowship
[57:36] that God has given us takes away the
[57:39] confusion right
[57:43] Hallelujah just a maybe just a little
[57:46] bit different direction here John 8 and
[57:51] 12 8 and
[57:53] 12
[57:55] let's look at this just for a little bit
[57:57] then spake Jesus again unto them saying
[58:00] I am the light of the world he that
[58:03] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[58:05] but shall have the light of Life the
[58:08] Pharisees therefore said unto him thou
[58:10] bearest record of thyself that record is
[58:13] not true so they're basically they're
[58:15] calling Jesus a
[58:17] liar but Jesus answered and said then
[58:19] though I bear record of myself yet my
[58:21] record is true for I know whence I came
[58:24] and with I go but ye cannot tell whence
[58:26] I came and whether I go ye judge after
[58:30] the flesh I judge no manen and yet if I
[58:33] judge my judgment is true for I am not
[58:35] alone but I am the father that sent me
[58:38] it is also written in your law that the
[58:40] testimony of two men is true I am one
[58:43] that bear witness of myself and the
[58:45] father that sent me beareth witness of
[58:48] me and they said unto him where is thy
[58:52] father and Jesus answered ye need
[58:54] neither known me nor my father if you
[58:57] had known me you should have known my
[58:59] father also so they had just they had
[59:03] just brought a woman caught in in the
[59:06] very Act of adultery to him right always
[59:09] trying to get Jesus to slip up always
[59:11] trying trying to work him up on who is
[59:14] your father right and and and they had
[59:18] brought to him this woman saying Master
[59:21] the law of Moses commands us that she
[59:23] should be Stone what sayth thou
[59:25] always trying to catch him right and
[59:27] under religious spirit they did this to
[59:28] tempt Jesus that they might have
[59:31] accusation against him and he stooped
[59:32] down and he rode in the sand as though
[59:35] he heard him not yeah and they continued
[59:38] to ask him and he stood upon his feet
[59:41] and he said he that is without sin Let
[59:43] Him cast the first stone at her and then
[59:45] being convicted the Bible says from the
[59:47] from the eldest to the youngest they
[59:49] begin to leave one by one and then Jesus
[59:53] asked the woman where are your accusers
[59:56] yeah all
[59:58] right where are your accusers where is
[1:00:00] he that condemns thee see they had
[1:00:03] brought her under the law of Moses but
[1:00:06] they had brought her to the one that was
[1:00:08] the law of Moses amen under Moses law
[1:00:11] was condemnation you never got delivered
[1:00:14] from your sin but in him Jesus all right
[1:00:16] in him Jesus was forgiveness and life
[1:00:19] and the power to change a person from a
[1:00:22] life of sin and the per version of the
[1:00:25] LIE of the Devil in him was the power of
[1:00:29] redemption in him in this man was the
[1:00:32] ability greater than the law but in this
[1:00:34] man was the ability to fulfill the law
[1:00:36] to pay to pay the price of redemption
[1:00:40] amen thank you Lord he told the woman
[1:00:42] don't go on and and do the same thing
[1:00:44] you did again but go you're forgiven
[1:00:46] you're going sin no more amen
[1:00:50] amen but here the the Pharisees are
[1:00:52] calling Jesus a liar always trying to
[1:00:54] get him riled up always trying to trying
[1:00:57] to get him and that's what the devil
[1:00:59] does he's trying to bring out the worst
[1:01:01] in you but just stay in your position
[1:01:05] stay in your position know who you are
[1:01:08] know why you're
[1:01:11] here they calling Jesus a liar that his
[1:01:14] record what he was bearing witness of
[1:01:15] wasn't true and that which he was
[1:01:18] bearing witness of was that he was the
[1:01:20] light of the world and that he that
[1:01:22] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[1:01:24] but shall have the light of light he
[1:01:26] said though I bear record of myself my
[1:01:28] record is true I like what he said there
[1:01:31] he said he said I know from whence I
[1:01:33] came and whether I go and if you look at
[1:01:36] that there from whence he says it means
[1:01:38] from where from what how and why so he's
[1:01:41] saying I know where I came from I know I
[1:01:45] know what I came from you asked me who
[1:01:47] my father was and I I'm not moved by
[1:01:50] that I know who I am I know I know where
[1:01:53] I came from I know why I'm here I know
[1:01:56] my purpose I know my how and my why amen
[1:01:59] because see Jesus had a perfect Faith he
[1:02:02] wasn't moved yes all right he knew where
[1:02:05] he was going Jesus was not confused but
[1:02:08] he knew what he believed and that's what
[1:02:10] it takes for the bride in this time of
[1:02:12] deception Amen in this time of darkness
[1:02:15] in this time of confusion Satan will try
[1:02:17] to get you to doubt this morning who you
[1:02:20] are he'll try to get you to doubt amen
[1:02:22] that why why did God bring God bring you
[1:02:25] to this message you can't live it you
[1:02:26] can't produce it but yet God has
[1:02:28] identified himself here today with you
[1:02:31] and I say we're still here we're still
[1:02:33] here Satan we're still here you you you
[1:02:36] haven't shaken us off yet we've been
[1:02:38] through hell we've been through this and
[1:02:40] we've been through that we're still
[1:02:43] here but he'll try to get you to turn
[1:02:46] back he'll try to get you to doubt and
[1:02:49] that's when you got to be as sure as
[1:02:50] Jesus was amen you got to know in whom
[1:02:53] you have believed you've got to know
[1:02:55] what's right you've got to understand
[1:02:58] who you are you've got to understand
[1:03:00] what you believe amen that's I believe
[1:03:02] we do here today don't let Satan talk
[1:03:04] you off of it
[1:03:06] amen that's good know what the scripture
[1:03:08] says about
[1:03:10] you amen and we've been identified with
[1:03:13] a message and not just not just we're
[1:03:17] walking along and we're identified I
[1:03:19] believe the message but the message came
[1:03:21] to you that's right that's the message
[1:03:24] came identified itself to you it
[1:03:26] bypassed certain ones it bypassed great
[1:03:29] people and it came to the lowly such as
[1:03:32] you and I we're nothing here today but
[1:03:34] God came and identified himself with the
[1:03:37] with us with with the truth amen that's
[1:03:40] right that we could overcome the lie
[1:03:42] that's good I know this is a little
[1:03:44] different here
[1:03:50] today so brother Ram says here he said
[1:03:52] but when Jesus when he was born he was
[1:03:54] born with that Mark of being an
[1:03:56] illegitimate child and that his father
[1:03:58] was Joseph and that he was born in other
[1:04:00] words a bastard child born of a father
[1:04:04] by a mother which he was conceived
[1:04:06] before they were married and they would
[1:04:08] ask him where's your
[1:04:10] father throwing it up at him but see
[1:04:13] Jesus had dealt with this lie about him
[1:04:15] ever since he was a
[1:04:18] child
[1:04:19] amen he had dealt with us his whole life
[1:04:22] that's right brother Brown says here he
[1:04:24] says look at Jesus they said away with
[1:04:27] that guy we know he's a Samaritan he's
[1:04:29] crazy will you teach us will you show us
[1:04:32] who the father is you was born in
[1:04:34] adultery you wasn't nothing but an
[1:04:36] illegitimate child to come who's your
[1:04:38] daddy you say God's your father you
[1:04:40] blasphemer while you mean to tell us
[1:04:42] we've been preachers we've been Bishops
[1:04:44] our great great grandfathers was
[1:04:45] preachers and Bishops we were born and
[1:04:48] raised in the church we've been through
[1:04:50] the highest of seminaries we know every
[1:04:52] word to the letter and you try to teach
[1:04:54] us where did you ever go to school at
[1:04:57] where did you get this learning that's
[1:04:59] right and Jesus would tell him said why
[1:05:01] do you not understand my speech even
[1:05:03] because you cannot hear my word and he
[1:05:06] said ye are of your father the devil and
[1:05:09] the lust of your father will you do and
[1:05:11] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:05:13] a bold not in the truth because there is
[1:05:16] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[1:05:18] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:05:21] and the father of it and you look these
[1:05:24] men these men were were clean men you
[1:05:27] couldn't put a finger on their lives
[1:05:29] they could trace their lineage all the
[1:05:31] way back to Abraham their lives were
[1:05:34] without blemish but Jesus told them you
[1:05:36] are of your father the devil because you
[1:05:38] cannot accept me because you cannot
[1:05:40] recognize who I am and brother R says
[1:05:43] why he said because they couldn't see
[1:05:45] the message the word was right there
[1:05:48] right there in front of them but they
[1:05:49] rejected
[1:05:52] him on it was right there there before
[1:05:57] him 2 Corinthians 4 said but if our
[1:06:00] gospel be hid it is hid to them that are
[1:06:02] lost that's right in whom the God of
[1:06:05] this world have blinded the minds of
[1:06:07] them which believe not lest the light of
[1:06:09] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:06:12] image of God should shine unto them for
[1:06:16] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:06:19] the Lord and ourselves for your
[1:06:21] ourselves your servants for jesus' sake
[1:06:23] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:06:25] out of Darkness has shined in our hearts
[1:06:28] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:06:30] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ aren't you thankful this morning
[1:06:35] that the gospel has not been hid to you

[1:14:41] Satan's Eden he's he created his perfect
[1:14:43] Eden amen but there's a people here

[1:14:53] with the marks and the claims and the
[1:14:55] black the black
[1:14:58] marks all the way from the child even to
[1:15:00] his death he had to deal with it that's
[1:15:03] true when he was a child Mary and Joseph
[1:15:05] went off without him when they found him
[1:15:08] teaching and confounding the leaders of
[1:15:10] that day amen by the things that he
[1:15:12] taught Mary said I and your father have
[1:15:14] sought thee with tears and him being the
[1:15:17] word corrected the error he said I must
[1:15:21] be about my father's business
[1:15:24] where he was the Virgin born son of God
[1:15:26] Jesus rejected the idea of him not being
[1:15:29] the word yes we've got to do the same
[1:15:31] thing when he was led away in the
[1:15:34] wilderness to be tempted the tempter
[1:15:35] came and said if thou be the Son of God
[1:15:38] he knew who he was but he he threw that
[1:15:41] doubt of if thou be the Son of God turn
[1:15:43] these stones to breath Satan tried to
[1:15:45] make him question who he was and at the
[1:15:48] same time knew who he was and tried to
[1:15:51] get him to display his power to should
[1:15:53] create bread but Jesus didn't buy it
[1:15:55] that's right he didn't he didn't take
[1:15:57] the bait and that's what we've got to do
[1:15:59] as Sons and Daughters of God don't take
[1:16:01] the bait don't take the bait when Satan
[1:16:04] you know something's working against you

[1:16:17] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:16:19] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:16:21] God even when Jesus was was on the cross
[1:16:26] that same devil that if thou be the Son
[1:16:29] of God come off the cross that's so from
[1:16:32] all the way from from a child up until
[1:16:36] he died yeah he dealt with that that
[1:16:38] death if thou be who's your father where
[1:16:42] did you come from who who really is your
[1:16:44] father prise Lord but I I'd like to I'd
[1:16:47] like to throw this in here that what
[1:16:50] what Jesus what he battled his entire
[1:16:52] life and what he rejected he took to
[1:16:55] hell with him and there he defeated
[1:16:58] death hell in the

[1:18:55] is is have faith in in what you are have
[1:18:58] faith in what the word says you are
[1:19:00] that's so simple isn't it but that being
[1:19:04] in its Simplicity that's what it takes

[1:19:10] child can understand it right yes just
[1:19:13] take the word in faith take what the

[1:19:27] that perfect faith that he was the
[1:19:29] anointed Messiah that the spirit of God
[1:19:31] was upon him he said I I do nothing in
[1:19:34] myself but it's my faith in God Amen
[1:19:38] thank he had power within himself to to
[1:19:40] call 10,000 angels to come off the cross
[1:19:42] but he had to fulfill what God what the
[1:19:45] father had for him Jesus understood his
[1:19:47] position in the scripture he knew his
[1:19:48] place he understood his why he
[1:19:51] understood his his how and is why and
[1:19:53] and where he came from and where he was

[1:23:00] got to be about the father's
[1:23:02] business and that that's what the
[1:23:04] difference is a real real believer
[1:23:07] somebody's got perfect Faith yeah in a
[1:23:10] perfect word yeah they just want to do
[1:23:12] what father says
[1:23:15] yes so you don't take you don't take

[1:23:24] here he says we are taught to resist the
[1:23:26] devil and he will flee from us now to
[1:23:29] resist the devil is just simply turn him
[1:23:30] down resist resist him is that just walk
[1:23:33] away from it God said a certain thing no

[1:23:50] attack of the
[1:23:51] enemy
[1:23:53] amen yeah that's good yes
[1:23:57] sir Jesus said let every man's word be a
[1:23:59] lie and mine be the
[1:24:03] truth right yes he goes on in the church
[1:24:06] ages here he said notice the harmony of
[1:24:08] the father and the son Jesus never did
[1:24:11] anything until it was first showed him
[1:24:13] by the father he said that Harmony is
[1:24:15] now to exist between the groom and his
[1:24:17] bride he shows her what his Word of Life
[1:24:20] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:24:23] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:24:25] death for if the sea be planted the
[1:24:27] water will raise it up again and he said
[1:24:29] here's the secret of this the word is in
[1:24:31] the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[1:24:34] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:24:36] what he wants done with the word she
[1:24:38] performs the command of the word in his
[1:24:41] name for she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:24:44] now I didn't come up with that but a
[1:24:46] Prophet come up with that that she has
[1:24:48] thus said the Lord as the word was in
[1:24:50] Mary so is it in her her so when the
[1:24:54] angel came to Mary the angel came with
[1:24:56] the message and the message wasn't just
[1:24:59] for the angel but the message was to
[1:25:01] Mary that she would receive that word
[1:25:04] and produce that word and it doesn't it
[1:25:06] won't come in a doubting heart but it's
[1:25:08] got to coming a prepared people it's got
[1:25:10] to be coming coming a a a a virgin
[1:25:13] virgin bride yes it can't be muddled up
[1:25:16] with the world it can't be in the
[1:25:18] confusion of the world but to to accept
[1:25:20] that word amen as marriage we've got to
[1:25:22] be clean we've got to be set aside
[1:25:25] right we've got to have the heart that
[1:25:27] says be it unto me according to Thy
[1:25:31] word it didn't just stay with the angel
[1:25:33] the angel spoke it a prophet came in
[1:25:36] this day Angel messenger came in his day
[1:25:40] the message wasn't for him just for him
[1:25:43] but it was to a bride from the throne
[1:25:46] from from the mind of God to a bride to
[1:25:48] accept amen and take that word and stand
[1:25:51] on thus sayith the Lord Lord
[1:25:53] amen amen we have thus sayith the Lord
[1:25:56] this morning or we keep still that's
[1:25:59] wonderful yes he goes on he did not
[1:26:01] complete all his his work while in his
[1:26:03] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:26:06] through the bride she knows that for she
[1:26:08] was for it was not yet time for him to
[1:26:11] do certain things that he must do now
[1:26:14] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:26:16] bride that which he left for this
[1:26:19] specific time amen do you believe that
[1:26:22] amen you believe you got something to do
[1:26:25] you believe that you're not just
[1:26:26] floating along am that you're not just
[1:26:29] coming to church is that what if that's
[1:26:31] what we're
[1:26:32] doing we're not fulfilling the word if
[1:26:35] we're just floating no long brother Matt
[1:26:37] McGary talked about that when he was
[1:26:39] preaching are we just going to work and
[1:26:41] and and doing everyday normal things and
[1:26:43] just dragging along or do we have a
[1:26:45] purpose and that purpose amen God has
[1:26:48] placed specifically upon this bride that
[1:26:51] she will be the word that she will be
[1:26:53] the bride that doesn't fall the bride
[1:26:55] that stands there behind thus sayith the
[1:26:59] Lord amen amen that's good John

[1:27:26] truth coming back amen maybe even more
[1:27:30] of the truth and greater truth right not

[1:28:00] have been released we couldn't just do
[1:28:02] it on the message of Luther on on the
[1:28:05] message of Wesley but we had to have a
[1:28:07] restored word we had to have something
[1:28:10] amen that would bring us to the fullness

[1:30:52] you want all right we've got to take
[1:30:55] every bit of it I've got to take what
[1:30:58] what it takes to to produce a real Son
[1:31:01] of God right not just a good church
[1:31:04] member I pay my ti I come I raise my
[1:31:06] hands I play the drums I preach every
[1:31:08] now and then but you've got to take

[1:31:15] Christ
[1:31:18] amen I'll try to try to skip some of
[1:31:26] this
[1:31:28] so Satan Satan by his wisdom caused Eve
[1:31:33] to break down the barrier caused her to
[1:31:35] come out from behind what she was
[1:31:37] fortified and Satan Satan admitted that
[1:31:40] the word was right but just one little
[1:31:42] bit right surely you won't
[1:31:45] die and that was a loophole and that's
[1:31:47] how he got Eve out with one little doubt
[1:31:50] see that's Satan's purpose is to to
[1:31:51] cause doubt and unbelief and when she
[1:31:53] fell she lost her position she lost her
[1:31:57] fortification and Satan only
[1:31:58] misconstrued one word he caused one
[1:32:00] little doubt and since then Satan has
[1:32:03] had his
[1:32:04] bluff he he's had his bluff on us
[1:32:08] right just one more time lord and the
[1:32:12] devil put you in the pawn shot but Jesus
[1:32:14] came and redeemed you open up the doors
[1:32:17] and the only thing you have to do is
[1:32:18] walk out and claim your Liberty amen

[1:32:54] blessing was completely finished God's
[1:32:56] Great wrath on sin when he became sin
[1:32:58] for us it was the debt was settled Satan

[1:33:04] it if he can Bluff you into it all right
