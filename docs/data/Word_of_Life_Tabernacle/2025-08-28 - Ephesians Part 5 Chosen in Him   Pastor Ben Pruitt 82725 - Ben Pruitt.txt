The most important part of your day is going to be right now when the word of the Lord comes forth because the word can change you. How many believes that? I believe it does change you. Brother Brandon would say it like this. He said, "You either leave better or you leave worse." Let's leave better here tonight. Can we do that? Amen. Let's just get behind the word as he preaches tonight. Let him pour his heart out to us. And I believe I I I know there's something for us.

If that's your desire, I want you to just put a hand up to him as we sing it now. Oh, fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up Lord. Oh come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Oh bread of heaven, won't you feed me till I want no more? Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. One more time with all your hearts now. Here's my cup, Lord. Oh, here's my cup, Lord. Won't you come and quench this thirsting of my soul? Oh grant it Lord. Oh bread of heaven. Won't you feed me till I want no more? Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, just so grateful to be in your house once again. Lord, I pray you'd move me out of the way and speak to your people as only you can. May you speak lifegiving revelation, Lord, to every heart. Oh God, open up our hearts today. Lord, we want to know, not only know your word, but to know you better, oh God. I pray you'd grant that tonight. May your Holy Spirit come down, meet every need. God, I pray that there would be a a moment in the house of God tonight that we could go and we could say it was good to be in the house of the Lord and how our hearts burn within us, Lord, as you spoke to us. So, I pray you'd remove all the humanity, Lord, and may you speak directly to us tonight. I pray, God, that your word would be true and clear to us, Lord. Bind my lips so I wouldn't say anything that wouldn't be right. Pray if there's one here that's sick or in need, I pray that you'd meet that need, heal that sickness, Lord, pray that you'd do it now. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you tonight. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4. We've gotten down to the fourth verse. I love uh going through the scriptures like this because it it causes you to deal with things maybe you wouldn't otherwise deal with uh as a complete sermon. But I believe the Lord is just going to help us tonight. Uh I want to speak about chosen in him. Ephesians 1:4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. I pray the Lord would add his blessings to the word. You may be seated. This weekend's a holiday weekend, so we'll just have one service this weekend. Looking forward to our Sunday morning service. Paul tells the Ephesians that our redemption is not by chance. It's not because God is feeling sorry for us, but we have been chosen in him. And the Bible is very clear that salvation is not our choice, it's God's choice. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to go into that tonight. And and and we're going to talk about that that and it it kind of takes all the uh the the boldness out of you in the sense of well, I did something to to be here. I I earned my way into the kingdom of God. And and that's not biblical at all. It's a very modern construct, but the Bible is very plainly teaching that salvation is of God alone and not uh not of us. You find a good example of that in the scripture in the Old Testament with Abraham. And if you'll turn to Genesis 12 and verse one, we're going to be using a lot of scripture tonight, so keep those Bibles open. Genesis 12 and verse one uh speaks of Abram and how God called Abram. He said, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, from thy kindred, from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee." &gt;&gt; It doesn't say that the Lord talked to Joe and John and Bill and and Steve and they turned him down and so he went to Abram, &gt;&gt; right? It's not as if God came down into and started an evangelistic campaign and passed tracks out at every house and and then found Abram was willing to go and so he went &gt;&gt; called him. That's not what he did at all. He only spoke to one individual &gt;&gt; right in in the whole world at that time. One individual. Think about that for just a moment. You realize what the odds are? You realize what God has done for you and for me. What are the odds of being born into a message home? Think about that just for a moment. How many of you grew up in a message home? Most of us did. If you grew up in a message home, the odds of being born in a message home in the US is somewhere between 1 in4,000 and one in 7,000 in the US. If you go to the Congo, it's 1 in 17. So there's a big difference depending on where you live. But here in the US, it's very it's very uncommon. In fact, it's more common uh to be a Southern Baptist or something like that. If you were the odds of being a Southern Baptist in in the US right now is one in 26 people just born into Southern Baptist homes. The fact you were born into a message home, you defied the odds to get there, &gt;&gt; right? God didn't just bring everybody into a knowledge even that God sent a prophet. He didn't tell everybody about it. And yet you're here and yet you believe it and you grabbed a hold of it when some of your siblings didn't and other people in the church didn't and and to Abraham and he's telling him I'm going to make you a great nation and there's no reason for it &gt;&gt; that Abraham can see &gt;&gt; right there there's no compelling reason why should God speak to me but there was a receiver inside of Abraham that could talk to God. There was a God consciousness in Abraham that didn't exist in any of his family, in any of his country. Listen, there was no such thing as a Jew in them days. There was no such thing as a Hebrew. Abram was the first one. And so, he was a gentile. He was just another normal person, just an everyday person. Brother Brandham said his his father was an idol worshipper. He said Abraham was out there one day picking berries. And when he was out there picking berries, the Lord began to speak to him. And there was something about Abraham that he would listen to the voice of the Lord. I believe there's a quality in the elect of God that we will listen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I I don't mean to preach this. I want to teach it to you tonight, but I just it just blesses me to see it. &gt;&gt; Listen, he said, "I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee, make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing." And and Abraham, if you'll do everything I tell you to do, and if you don't mess up, and if you don't disbelieve me if you don't do this, that, or the other. That's not what he said. But I will bless them that bless thee. &gt;&gt; Curse him that cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth &gt;&gt; be blessed. &gt;&gt; So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Lot went with him, but God did not call Lot out of, right? But Lot went with him. And Lot was blessed to be Abram's family, but he was not the elect of God. Abraham was. &gt;&gt; So he was 75 years old when he departed out of Herod. So God, he did not speak to a thousand people. And then the first one that said yes,
