Jehovah sea. Oh, you reign in victory. Jehovah Shalom. You are my prince of peace. Oh, I worship you because of who you are. Oh yes, I worship you because of who you are. We bow our heads together for just a moment. Maybe you've got a special need you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand tonight. God sees those needs. We think of Wednesday night as prayer meeting tonight. So let's just have a little prayer meeting here at the beginning of the service. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you as our father, the one who made the heavens and the earth, the great one, Lord, and we thank you for all that you've done for us. We thank you for your goodness to us, Lord. I pray that you would just help us today. I pray that you'd help us, Lord, in our worship, Lord. That we would worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, if we've committed any sins or done anything that's wrong, I pray you'd forgive us of it, Lord. these needs, Lord, that were represented by way of uplifted hand. I pray you'd meet every need. Lord, you know what they are and you're able to come and meet those needs. I pray you'd do it now. We thank you for doing it, Lord. We ask you to come and just move me out of the way and speak directly through your word to the people, Lord, to the eagles, Lord, that want to eat eagle food for you to grant it now. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three. Ephesians 1 and 3. Peter, those house mics are really loud in my monitors. Ephesians 1 and 3. We're going to uh approach this same verse again. I hope you're not bored with it already, but it's just something else that the Lord had impressed on my heart about this verse. And then we'll move on. And as we get into the book of Ephesians, we'll move a little bit faster. It won't take us 10 years to do it because we'll have gone over some of the the territory. But don't you love the word of God? &gt;&gt; Doesn't it feed your soul? I pray that it does. And and I wanted to say tonight as you're turning there that how much I appreciate you coming tonight on a Wednesday night. I know it's the first week of school and for those of you that go to public school, that's a traumatic kind of thing. and and uh you're going and maybe to a new school or a new place and a new class and new teacher and uh so especially for you kids. I know that's hard, but you're here tonight and I appreciate that. I I really do. And for you teachers, just praying for a good year for you. I know brother Joel prayed with you Sunday. We're praying that the teachers and the students and you homeschooled families, I'm praying that you just have the best year you've ever had and that the kids will learn and and uh we just and that they'll be protected. We we want our children to have God's protection on them, don't we? We can only do so much. &gt;&gt; It takes him to provide real protection for our children. So, we want to do that. And we so thankful for you being here tonight. It just blessed me to you here tonight. Ephesians 1:3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. Paul is telling us what we have when we are in Christ. If you are in Christ, you have all someone say it with me, all spiritual blessings. If you are in Christ, you have all spiritual blessings. And then he says where you have it, you have it in heavenly places. In the Amplified Bible, this verse is is uh is this way. It's May blessing, praise, ludation, and eulogy be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual given by the Holy Spirit blessing in the heavenly realm. So these spiritual blessings are Holy Ghost blessings, as we would say, Holy Spirit blessings in heavenly places or a heavenly realm. In heavenly places is not just necessarily this building. This could be a a place where we meet in together, but we're meeting not just in a building, but our our spirits have lifted us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And that's why it's so important to come together because when you come together, you're actually in a in a different assembly. You're not just assembling here in the flesh, but you're assembling on a spiritual level. You're assembling together. And and when we get all of our licks of fire together, it does something for us. Now, brother Brandham says in heavenly places. Now, just not out anywhere. In heavenly places, we're assembled in heavenly. It means that the position of the believer that if I'm prayed up, how many come prayed up tonight? If I'm prayed up, well, not very many of you. I guess maybe we do need to have a prayer meeting. How many come prayed up tonight? That's all right. You say, "What do I need to pray up?" Sometimes you just be that quick and say, "Lord, forgive me. Help me. And and and let me my spirit be right to hear the word of God." He said, "If I'm prayed up, you're prayed up." The church is prayed up, and we're ready for the message, and we have assembled ourselves together as saints, called out, baptized with the Holy Ghost, filled with God's blessings, called, elected, set together in heavenly places. Now, he said we are heavenlies in our souls, &gt;&gt; right now. We know we're not heavenlies in our bodies because some of you are hurting tonight. Some of us, we we have sicknesses and things that you deal with and and and there's things that come up. Maybe you're stressed out about something. Maybe you've got a a situation in your family or a situation at work that you're worried about. But but the thing is when you come together, you can come together in heavenly places no matter what's going on in your body because it's heaven's in our souls. Our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere. He said, "Oh, brother, there you are, a heavenly atmosphere." He said, "Oh, what could happen tonight? What could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus." He said, "All sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted, sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, worshiping together in the heavenly places." So again, it's something more than just sitting here, but it's something about sitting together with our spirits united together in heavenly places. He said, "Did you ever sit in one?" He said, "Oh, I have set till I would weep for joy and say, God, never let me leave here." Have you ever been in a service like that? If it's been a while since you've been in the house of God and you said, "Lord, don't let me ever leave here. I want to feel this presence." And you need to get back to that. We need to get back to that moment when we realize, "Lord, I just want to be here. I want to enjoy church." And for some of you new Christians, there's just that special feeling about it. I'm glad I'm in the house of God. I I feel that the condemnation is gone. I feel that my load of sin is gone. But for some, it's been a while since you've really realized you were sitting in heavenly places. But if you come and your sins have been forgiven and you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost, that's where you're sitting tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are we're born, listen, we're born by natural birth into an earthly place. &gt;&gt; How many realize that tonight? We were not born into heavenly places by natural birth, but we're born into heavenly places by spiritual birth. So, we must have a there must be something that takes place to make us worship together in heavenly places. Now, so we're born by natural birth into earthly places, an earthly realm, and an earthly atmosphere. And when the natural seed, I'll just say it like this, was quickened to life. &gt;&gt; When we were conceived, and then when we took the breath of life, when we come into the world, &gt;&gt; our birth places us into this earthly realm, &gt;&gt; right? That's what placed us here. We were placed, we didn't have to fight to get into it or or or try to get into it. We didn't get to choose where we would come, but our birth just placed us right into a heavenly realm in a certain family be based on the seed that we were &gt;&gt; right. We we become a part of a certain family. I want you to think with me tonight. And that place you in a certain place in the earth. &gt;&gt; So, and and and brother Brandham even tells us that God ordained that. &gt;&gt; How many know your natural birth was pre-planned? &gt;&gt; Right? Go listen to things that are to be. Our natural birth was pre-planned. We're not here by accident. We're not here by chance. But God places us here for a reason. Now, but God will place you sometimes. I know there there's a lot of question about that. They said, "Well, why if God placed me somewhere did I ever move away from there?" Well, let me say this. God placed Abraham. His place was in the land of Canaan. But his birth birthed him into &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of the Cales, right? His natural birth put him in an earthly realm of the Cales. But the realm he was supposed to be in, come on, was hundreds of miles away. &gt;&gt; But he was purposely put into so he could make a journey of faith. &gt;&gt; And many of us have been purposely placed in our the family we were in in the place where maybe we weren't born in a message family. Maybe there was trouble in our family. Maybe we were born into a message family, but there was a lot of struggle and maybe we had reasons to even uh maybe blaspheme or deny the message, but there just something in us wouldn't wouldn't let us do it. Why was that? Because though we were born in a certain place, God knew that that that faith would carry us. There's something in our hearts that would carry us to another place. Aren't you glad for that tonight? He wanted Abraham to be in the land of Canaan. So, you were born into a natural realm. Now, think about it for just a moment. God wants every one of us who were in his mind. And he knows he he has determined that every one of us that were in his mind before the foundation of the world would actually come into this spiritual adoption, this spiritual land, this spiritual place, these heavenly places that we would come into that. He is he has predetermined that we would. But yet we have to we have to move our way there. We are we are transported from one realm to another &gt;&gt; because you were not meant to be down here. You're meant to be in heaven. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you go back before your natural birth, &gt;&gt; you were a child of God. &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that, church? &gt;&gt; If we really believe that we were in the thoughts of God, it means that he had us in his mind before the foundation of the earth. And so what happened is that we were we were meant to be in heaven, but sin came in and we were we we had there was a fall and we were born in sin shaped in iniquity. But God called us out of that earthly atmosphere, that earthly realm into a heavenly realm or heavenly place. &gt;&gt; And in our souls, we're sitting there already. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In our souls, we've already made it. &gt;&gt; In our souls, we're already in heaven. But in our bodies, we haven't made it yet. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show it to you in just a moment. The Lord willing now. So, the natural seed was quickened to life and its birth placed it in an earthly realm. But as sinners, we were like all other sinners, right? Or mostly we did a lot of things we shouldn't have done because our position was earthly, &gt;&gt; right? Our position was earthly. Now, Brother Brandham says this, "And and yet there was something in us that wanted God, but we didn't know that. And so, we drank, smoked, maybe sat on a church pew board to death." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The word didn't mean nothing to us. &gt;&gt; But one day, &gt;&gt; an eagle flew overhead. &gt;&gt; Come on. We heard a scream. What changed? Come on, church. Listen. It's not so much where you were sitting. But when you heard it, it was your time. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit, but our position has to change then from earthly. Just like the chicken coming up from an earthly position to a flying position, to a heavenly position. Romans chapter 3 and verse 9, it says this about us. This is the way we come to the earth. He said, "What then? Are we better than they? know we know wise. For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin. As it is written, there is none righteous, know not one. There is none that understand it. There's none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way. They are together become unprofitable. There is none that doeth good, know not one. Romans 3:23 says, "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." Psalms 51 and5 said, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity. In sin did my mother conceive me. Psalms 58:3 says, "The wicked are estranged or separated from God from the womb. They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." &gt;&gt; Proverbs 20:9 says, "Who can say I have made my heart clean? &gt;&gt; I am pure from my sin." &gt;&gt; Now, we can stop there for a while. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 7:20. There is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinnth not. Come on, church. We want to judge everybody and look down our noses at everybody and and talk about how, oh, we were different. We can't think of any reason why we wouldn't be saved, you know, and and and boy, we just always been pretty good. I tell you what, that's that's probably the worst spirit that you can have is a religious spirit. I've told my kids that. I know they haven't experienced what other people have because we've held them in a place where they didn't have to. But that's the worst spirit you can have is a judgmental, critical, religious spirit that tries to say, "Well, I don't need to change. I don't need to repent. Every one of us do. There is none, he says that that that that that can say I've made my heart clean. &gt;&gt; Pure from sin. Who can say that? You're born in an earthly realm, under earthly conditions, under the king of the earth, who is Satan. &gt;&gt; The prince of the power of the air. Born into that realm. This is Satan's Eden. We weren't born into God's Eden like Adam and Eve were. were born into Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinth not. We can't change our spots. You young people, you remember a few weeks ago I told you about how, you know, a leopard can't can't wash his spots. Brother Brandham was in a quote. He said a leopard can't lick off his spots. Well, the Bible says that Jeremiah 13:23, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin?" In other words, if you're God made you a certain color, can you change that? I guess you could &gt;&gt; Michael Jackson tried but it didn't work. &gt;&gt; Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard is spots? Then may you also do good that are accustomed to do evil. In other words, if you come in the world speaking lies, how can you get rid of that? How do you get rid of them spots? Is what Nicodemus wanted to know when he come to Jesus one day. He was a righteous man. A man who kept the letter of the law. And he was a he was a man who had had everything from his childhood ordered just right. Just like some of our children that we've tried to keep them from all kinds of things and help him out any way that we can. And it says in John chapter 3, there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God." Rabbi means teacher, but it's a very respectful term. Rabbi, we know thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him. And Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see. That word see is to understand the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Why? You were born in an earthly realm. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You were born in earthly places. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You didn't sit in heavenly places when you come to the earth. So Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he's old, can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" And Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. So if you're flesh born, you're bound in earthly places." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And and if you're spirit born, you are in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Do you see it tonight? They You can't be spirit born and not be in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't slip out of heavenly places &gt;&gt; when you face trials, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When you get discouraged, &gt;&gt; right? When when you're when when you struggle in some way. You don't just slip out of heavenly places. It doesn't suddenly become a something that said, "Well, he was in heavenly places, but now, you know, now he he he just he can't get back there. He's just unable to." doing. No. If you've ever been in heavenly places, you can be in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You're born into heavenly places. See, once they crossed over, they were in the land, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were in the land. &gt;&gt; Now, some chose not to cross over. &gt;&gt; They stayed on the other side. Right? They come twothirds of the way there and didn't go on all the way in. But those who crossed over were there. &gt;&gt; Right? Once you've heard it, you can't unhear it. Once you receive the revelation, you can't you can't get it. You can't give it back. &gt;&gt; Right? You're here, &gt;&gt; but now you got to fight, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Now you got to go to war. Now you got to now you got to fight to pay attention on a Wednesday night. Now you got to fight to to through through struggle and heartache and worry and fear, all of those things. But what is it there for? You were you were born into heavenly places. You were put in that realm to fight. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ahead of myself in in a major way, but let's let's go on. Listen. He said, you can't you can't be b placed in heavenly places by family, &gt;&gt; right? You're not born into it by natural family, by your last name. You can't you're not born into it by effort, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. You could go and and go to the youth camp and jump and shout and run. And I'm so thankful that we can do that. I'm thankful for the freedom to do that. &gt;&gt; I'd like to see more of it. But but you don't get into heavenly places by effort, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You don't get in by money. You can't buy your way in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's only one way to have heavenlies in your soul, and that's to be born again. &gt;&gt; You've got to be translated from an earthly desire to a heavenly desire to from a carnal desire to a spiritual desire. This is why so many people struggle. It's why so many people can't keep the victory. It's what brother Brandham talked about. Satan deceives them that well, I felt a good feeling one time. I had this going for me one time. I was doing pretty good. But if you find yourself up and down and in and out and you can't seem to serve the Lord, maybe it's time to come back and say, "Lord, I want to be translated into heavenly places." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The word delivered. Colossians 1:13. I I my mind is on the end of this and I'm just keep I keep going ahead of myself. But Colossians 1:13, he says, "Whoath delivered us from the power of darkness?" Aren't you glad to be delivered? &gt;&gt; The word delivered means rescued. &gt;&gt; He's rescued us &gt;&gt; from Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the power of darkness, &gt;&gt; which we couldn't fight on our own, by the way. &gt;&gt; And hath translated us, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son. So translated is uh the word it's I cause to change its place. I move out of its place. Notice this is not what we did. It's what he did. &gt;&gt; Right? You did not translate yourself, your soul into a heavenly place. He had to translate you from an earthly place into a heavenly place. Are y'all is Are we okay so far? &gt;&gt; I know I started out deep and y'all thinking, "Boy, he's gonna take all night." But I I purposely did tonight because I I knew that you'd be tired and I purposely kept it short. So, you know, unless you just pull it out of me, we're we're not going to be long tonight. But, but he said, "I caused to change its place." That's what translation means. Move from one place to another. Moved by something. What are we moved by? What are we rescued by? &gt;&gt; What are we translated by? By quickening power. &gt;&gt; Quickening power. Ephesians 2:4. And this where we're kind of jumping ahead and so we won't have to spend as much time when we get there later on. He said, "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Now, &gt;&gt; I'm trying to change our thinking because many times we're brother Brandon talked about Johnny Crow and he talked about how that uh Johnny Crow was a a bound crow. He he was bound to a certain circuit and he had to do the same thing over and over again and and and he just kept flying, but he had a he had a string attached to his leg and he was didn't have the power to break it and so he just kept flying in circles. You ever felt like that? just flying in circles over and over and over again. Johnny Crow flew over that same route over and over and over again. Brother Ram said, "One day a good man come by and he released him from that from that string." &gt;&gt; He let him loose. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But guess what Johnny Crow did. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He just kept flying that same circuit cuz he was Oh, church. &gt;&gt; He was so used to it. It's just like cows you put in the pasture. If you get them used to there being electric fish, you don't even have to turn it on. &gt;&gt; Why? because they're used to that. They're used and for a while they'll stay right in that same area because they perceive that they have to be there. But if they could just get a revelation, he said that here come the crows flying over. Johnny Crow goes south. He couldn't do it when he was tied up, but the good man released him to do it, but he still didn't do it because in his mind, he was still bound. That's where many people are. Your heavenly in your soul, but in your mind, you're still bound. And so, you don't recognize who you are or where you are. And it's why it's hard to worship. And it's hard to get above the things of the world. And it's hard to move on in your life because you you just haven't recognized it yet. I think we ought to get into such a place. Come on, church. We ought to get to such a place where we realize it don't matter what's going on in my life. I've been translated into the kingdom of his dear son. I've been born again. I've been changed. Things are different. I can worship God with all of my heart. We're translated into this place. Now notice where we're translated to. Out of earthly places. Now where was Jesus when he was raised? In the belly of the earth, &gt;&gt; right? The son of man be in the belly of the earth for three days and three nights. He was taken out of earthly places and taken up before them into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Right? And so Paul says you are raised with him &gt;&gt; in his body &gt;&gt; because the bride is a part of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So brother Brandon says you died with him. That's such an important thing. Brother Brandon preaches identification. He says that I I'm identified with this nation. If I'm a part of this nation, I'm identified with Gettysburg. I'm identified with Valley Forge. What's he telling us? I'm identified with it. He said I'm identified with Christ in his resurrection. I'm identified with him in in the death, burial, and resurrection. I died with him on Calvary. I was raised with him on the third day. I know people make fun of that and say, "Well, Brother Brandon didn't know what he was talking about." No, he knew what he was talking about. He was saying the same thing that Paul was saying. You've been translated from an earthly thing to a heavenly thing. From an earthly realm to a heavenly realm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so, we've been raised by the same quickening power &gt;&gt; that he was raised by. &gt;&gt; Into the same place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good. &gt;&gt; That's where he wants us to be, right? That's what we're supposed to manifest is is the same things. To do the same things that he did, &gt;&gt; right? We weren't called here just to be church members. &gt;&gt; We weren't called in this age just to be another group of people. We were called to do the same things that he did. Wow. We've been quickened into the same place he was quickened to. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Let me use an example. Brother Brandham talked about God's attribute earth and and in the future home and I just kind of give a brief synopsis here. You know the earth will not be done away with after the millennium. How how many understand that &gt;&gt; right? But it'll be changed. &gt;&gt; It its atmospheres will be changed. &gt;&gt; It it'll even melt. The Bible says with a fervent heat, &gt;&gt; right? It'll be changed. Everything about it will be changed. But heaven will be on earth. The new heavens and the new earth is the old heaven and the old earth regenerated. &gt;&gt; So much so that there's not one speck or one atom that remains the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize what the Holy Ghost means to us? &gt;&gt; It's a regeneration &gt;&gt; of the soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in 2 Peter chapter 3 and:e 10 says, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise and the elements that the the heavens will have an altar call, an altar service, &gt;&gt; a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. The earth also and the works of their end shall be burned up." Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Revelation 21:1 I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea. That word pass away. I like that Dake's topical Bible if you have one. You look in Dake's Bible and he says this. He said pass away. Pass from one condition to another. That word never means annihilation. &gt;&gt; Right? Isn't that what brother Brandham taught us in future home? He said it wasn't annihilated. It it's passed away. &gt;&gt; Right? And Ecclesiastes 1:4 tells us that the earth abides forever. &gt;&gt; Right? So we know the earth is an attribute of God. The earth is regenerated. Titus 3:5 tells us, "Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost." Brother Brown uses that as an example of what happens to the earth. The earth is actually loosed from its bondage &gt;&gt; of sin by being changed into a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; So he talks about the earth being loosed. He talked about Lazarus. When Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus, he said, "Loose him and let him go." And that word is the same as pass away. Change him from one place to another. Set him free. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. See, brother Ram says, "You were made for an eternal purpose." Brother also talked about the cult. Remember, it was tied up &gt;&gt; and they told him, they said, "Tell him to loose the cult and let him go. My master has need of him." Because in the mind of God, that cult had a purpose. And in the mind of God, this earth has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you believe, church? In the mind of God, you had a purpose. You may not feel the purpose. You may not be able to see it right away, but it's there. There's a purpose for you. Listen, if you're watching tonight, maybe you got down and depressed and you've gotten discouraged and worried and you think, "Well, there's no need even going to the house of God anymore." Remember, you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. You're an attribute of God. And he come, the new birth comes to loose you for that purpose. &gt;&gt; See, you were made for an eternal purpose because you were the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being. Sin come along and perverted his way. He said you come anyhow, but you was lost with the world. So he come and redeems you. The expressed attribute also redeems this earth by the same way. He said then his purpose rolls on. Ephesians 1:10 says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times. &gt;&gt; So it tells us when it's going to happen. He said in the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which were on earth even in him. Listen, brother Brown said taught us that the earth had a fullness of times. You had a fullness of times. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In that sermon he teaches us that that the the the prophet the people said don't let God speak. Let a let the prophet speak. Let Moses speak. So a prophet's words became God's words. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Because the people said, "Don't let God speak. Let Moses speak." So God veiled himself behind Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And spoke things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "There will be a prophet like unto me. Isaiah the same way. Isaiah stood there said, "A virgin shall conceive." Brother said, "That word circled the earth &gt;&gt; until the fullness of times." that that word was meant to sink into the heart &gt;&gt; of Mary at the right time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm enjoying myself tonight. I don't know about the rest of you, but &gt;&gt; I know for some of us it's just old hat. You say, "Brother Ben, I knew all of that." But have you thought about it lately? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I think it would change the way we look at things &gt;&gt; and the way we look at people. You say, "Well, that person hasn't moved in 20 years." But we don't give up on people. Why? Because that word will circle the earth until the fullness of time comes in. And when the fullness of time comes, that that word was meant to strike the heart. That person will change. Sometimes you see them sit in church for years. Sometimes they'll sit at home for years. One day they show up at the house of God and things begin to change for them. Why is that? Because in the fullness of times, &gt;&gt; God came down and loosed them from their bondage. &gt;&gt; Glory. Aren't you glad you had a moment and a time when God released you, &gt;&gt; changed you? The Brandon said that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire. He can come and dwell with you and we can sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him. Hallelujah. Not we will be. We are now sitting in Christ Jesus. How do we get into it? By one Holy Spirit baptism. By one spirit. We're all baptized into Christ, which we are now. He said, won't be won't be in Christ. We are. &gt;&gt; He is the great spiritual king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Over the spirit that's in us. &gt;&gt; That's why he said our spirits can be lifted up into heavenly places. Because though our spirit realm, our spirit realm is not converted. Our flesh realm is not converted. But the king controls it. &gt;&gt; Right? As long as you let him control it. &gt;&gt; As long as you surrender to him, the king controls it. The king is in residence. And the fruits of the spirit can be displayed. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, kindness. All those things can be displayed in your life because the king is in residence. Oh, I think if I didn't have the Holy Ghost tonight, I'd be look I'd be seeking with everything I had in me, I'd be looking for it. I'm always amazed by sometimes you'll take ask for a show hand. How many don't have the Holy Ghost and people will be honest and they'll tell you and I I say you ought to be honest if you know you don't have it or if the devil's fighting you on that. You need to find assurance of that because the devil use that against you. So, you need to find an assurance. Sometimes he'll try to make you think you don't have it when you do have it. But if you don't have it, you ought to be looking for it &gt;&gt; because it's a promise to us. It's not something that well, it's not something God holds on a like a carrot on a stick and said, "When you behave, I'll give you the Holy Ghost." No, he said he'd give it to those that asked for it. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he wanted to give it to you more than you wanted it. I'd say it's about time to let our let our atmospheres be changed. Let let our in let our inner being be changed. Everything about us be changed. Be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Good. It's a great spiritual king over the spirit that's in us. But the RA explains that and who is this Melzdc. You don't have to quit smoking, quit drinking, quit doing those things. Let him become king. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All those things will go away. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself unable, well, I just can't do it. I can't do it. It's because you're trying to do it and you're not letting him be king. Look, every one of his attributes, including the earth, will receive the baptism of fire. Right? You might as well might as well be now. Why struggle at it? Worry about it. Brother said, "What will it do?" It this earth couldn't be a place for heaven to sit now. See, you you weren't a candidate for heavenly places before because of sin. How much sin does that take, brother Ben? Any sin. &gt;&gt; The nature of sin, &gt;&gt; even if you never acted on it, was enough to keep you out of the presence of God. &gt;&gt; But what also that means is that if you're sitting in heavenly places, if you've been born again and redeemed, brother Gabe, there's nothing there. Are are you hearing me? There's nothing there. No wonder a prophet could stand up and say and say you're the sinless, spotless bride of Jesus Christ. You never did it in the first place. If you have been transported, te teleported, we might say translated from one from earthly to heavenly. If you've been changed, it means there's nothing there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says the sin will have to be cleansed. The earth couldn't be a place for heaven to sit. Now the sin will have to be cleansed. No man, no person, no woman, boy, girl, I don't care who he is, is fit to go in the pulpit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled by the Holy Ghost. Filled with the Holy Ghost. See, you have no right to the Lord's supper or any communion, feet washing, or anything until you've been cleansed by the Holy Fire of God. He said, "No man has a right to preach unless it's you like Moses meets him out there on that sacred grounds." Hallelujah. That pillar of fire hanging there where he knows where he's at. &gt;&gt; He said, "Notice how we go after the world's fire baptism, all germs is gone." Well, praise God. Listen, we don't have to make some kind of strange incantation over COVID 19 or however many more COs there have been. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It'll it'll just get burned up with the earth. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. With the atmospheres, the germs makes it a fit place then for heaven to dwell here on earth. &gt;&gt; He said a type now of sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus passed from this dirty like the little woman was. He was talking about the woman at the well, &gt;&gt; right? She was dirty. She was black in her in her in her heart, in her soul. But he said there was representation there. Hallelujah. But but these priests though they lived godly lives &gt;&gt; had no representation &gt;&gt; cuz they couldn't see the manifested word of the day. But the little woman when she when it was revealed to her, she saw it. She grabbed a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, he he said he said that like this little woman was into the expressed attribute of God. Now we're the sons of God, not we will be. We're the attributes of God's thinking. Right? &gt;&gt; What is it? You're sitting in heavenly places. Now, how did we get here? We've been translated change. Move from one state to another, from one desire to another, from one condition to another by quickening power. In Colossians 2:13, you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all. Someone say all, &gt;&gt; all trespasses. &gt;&gt; Again, he said, now notice when this great moving power of God comes into a son of God, it quickens him. The spirit of life enters into him. And what does it do? It seats them in heavenly places right now. Not they will be. We are now. &gt;&gt; Now we've already resurrected. The dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work. I know people tell you that you got to go to their church to get the dynamics. You ought to throw that right back in their face. Listen, you don't have to go to a certain church to have the dynamics. You don't have to hear a certain preacher or or be in a certain service to have the dynamics. If you're born again, the dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work in your heart. quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is. &gt;&gt; And now we are seated together. And aren't you glad to be seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? Listen, I wouldn't want to give up church for nothing because it's my chance to come together in heaven. I'm in heavenly in my soul, but when we get together, we're in heavenlies together, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Seated together in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "In Christ sitting there, that great seat's already already fired up." Boy, I can stop and preach for a while and I don't have time. &gt;&gt; Preacher don't have to fire you up. &gt;&gt; The light show doesn't I know that's &gt;&gt; that's creeping into the message. I see that overseas if you some of you brothers. I've been to Africa a couple times and I've noticed boy they have such a simple wonderful faith. But I've noticed in some of the bigger countries that they brought in light shows and LED walls and and and and and loud music and things. I don't I'm not nothing against loud music, but it just seems like it's become a stage show. &gt;&gt; God help us today. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to fire up, a child of God. &gt;&gt; You're already fired up. If you're not, then the place is at the altar. &gt;&gt; Uh it won't I won't be able to fire you up. It'll take a quickening of the Holy Ghost. It'll take a refilling of the Holy Ghost to fire you up. Not a dynamic preacher or a dynamic service, but a quickening power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for just preaching tonight. But it's just &gt;&gt; something is on my heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Already fired up. Been raised from the dead. He said we're part of it. If you're a part of the bride, you are because the bride is part of the groom, you know. So, we find out that it's the same thing. And she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day. She won't be a Leodysian. not by no means a lukewarm, but she'll be on fire for God. She'll be moving on in the spirit of God. I believe that tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This quickening power has translated us into the land where all the promises laid, where we have all spiritual blessings in Christ. I know sometimes we get, you know, and I I don't want to take away I don't want to lose my feeling for you. I I know many times people will come and and and they have real needs and things on their heart and I don't want to lose the ability to to empathize with that. But sometimes we can be sympathized right out of the kingdom of God and we just people that feel sorry for us so much. And I tell you, you don't really need somebody to feel sorry for you. What you need is another dip of the Holy Ghost and and another revelation of God's word and and to get deeper into him. You need to be in Christ because you say, "Well, brother Ben, you always make me feel good when you're around, but there will come a moment I'm not around." The devil makes sure he attacks you in a moment you can't get a hold of me or you can't get a hold of Brother Joel. He'll make sure that he attacks you in that moment and try to make you think people don't love you and don't care about you, but you still got heavenly in your soul. You can still reach out by the power of the Holy Ghost and overcome that thing. &gt;&gt; I want you to reach out. I want I want to care for you. But remember, he cares. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us that heavenly places are full of Pentecostal blessings. I got three minutes. He said what Jesus ordained in Mark 16, Paul ordained the same thing 30 years later. &gt;&gt; Said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other thing, let him be accursed. &gt;&gt; Brother said, I believe that Pentecost began without an ending. I believe it's to be to every creature, all times, at all places. &gt;&gt; So, excuse me for being a little Pentecostal on a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ben, I'm just not feeling it tonight. Well, that's just the the part that hasn't been changed yet. But let him be the king over that tonight. &gt;&gt; Let him sit in residence over that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let him rule over that body and that spirit. &gt;&gt; He said the Pentecostal blessing should always remain. The Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people. He said, "Now, what is this Pentecostal blessing?" It's the confirmation of the resurrection. What was it that they went across and got when they went into the land? They come back with grapes. What was the grapes? A confirmation that there was a land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is the Pentecostal blessing? It's a confirmation that the land is there. We've entered the land. In the land is all good things in the land. Hallelujah. Every every promise of God is in the land. He said no wonder. He said the gospel itself means good news. Good news of what? He has raised from the dead. And because I live, you live also. Ye which were once dead in sin and trespasses, God has quickened us together by that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead. And we are now, someone say, now sitting in heavenly places with him, communing with him, talking with him. What a joy to tell people that story that believes it to be the truth. I'm going to stop right there. Sister Joanna, musicians, go ahead and come. What a joy it is to preach to people that believe that they're sitting in heavenly places in Christ. that every Pentecostal blessing is available to them. You may not feel Pentecostal tonight. You may not I'm not talking about uh 1906 Pentecost. I'm talking about the Pentecostal blessings that fell on the day of Pentecost. You may not feel like it tonight, but there's a Pentecostal blessing for you. There's a spiritual blessing uh in heavenly places for you. Why? You've been translated from what you were to what you are now. &gt;&gt; Oh, you become the target of the devil. The devil's got his target trained on you. And we'll talk about that more maybe in the future. Uh maybe next week if the Lord carries, we'll talk about that. But when we're seated in heavenly places, it's in those heavenly places. That's where we fight our battles. The devil's got his every gun trained on us. He's got every weapon trained on the believer who's seated in heavenly places. But this is our position, and we'll fight for it. We will be like Caleb who he was a type of the bride. He said, "Give me my mountain. Let me take over depression. Let me take over superstition. Let me take over cancer. Let me take over what belongs to me. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] The word spoken by prophets is only waiting for the fullness of times. Have great hope in that. [Music] Because if I'm not at peace now because I'm in heavenly places, my peace is coming. You may not have your healing tonight or at least the the symptoms may not have went away, but because you're seated in heavenly places in Christ because he rose, brother Paul, that's the story of the gospel. The good news of the gospel is because he rose. I rose with him. And we've been quickened together into heavenly places. And because I know I'm in heavenly places, I know that my healing's coming. I know that the salvation of our children's coming. Hallelujah. I know they'll be filled with the Holy Ghost cuz every attribute of God will be baptized by fire. I know that I'm going to make it. Brother Ben, you're always trying to encourage people. That's because the devil's always trying to discourage people. Listen to me, church. Some of y'all know, yeah, I know there's people people here in the church maybe don't do everything they should do. I I know there's people get involved in things they shouldn't, and it's my job to preach about those things. But let me say this, the devil's going to come and he's going to condemn you. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know there's a word that can wash you of that thing. You don't have to bow down to that. You don't have to give in to it. You don't have to give in to desire to fit in with the world. You don't have to give in to to to lust. You don't have to give in to filth of the world. Why? You can be changed. Hallelujah. Wash. You said, "What happens if I get dirty? If I get dirty, I know I'm a Christian. I know I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. What happens if I make a mistake?" Listen, you can be washed by the water of the word. Even tonight, Brother Brand said, "But how are you going to be washed if you won't stay under the fountain?" Lord, help me to stay under the word and listen to what he has to say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe your peace has come. your joy cuz it's been spoken by a prophet in our day by the prophets that wrote the Bible. It's been spoken. So shall it be. [Music] Brother Brandham gets to the end of the rapture sermon. Hallelujah. He preaches about a rapture. I just love this. He comes like this. He said, "It's been spoken, so it shall be. He was sure what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I believe it, church. I'm just simple to believe it. The word comes to the prophets. &gt;&gt; It's been spoken. So shall it be. Think about it. And and it's not just that. We're not just relying on the word of a man, but the reason it works is because you were in the mind of God, a thought of God before the foundation of the world. God knew you. That's why he spoke over you. Aren't you glad for that today? Hallelujah. H. Would you bow your heads with me? Oh, thank you, Lord. Maybe maybe you just talk to him for a minute. Lord, translate me. Oh, God. Translate me, Lord. Maybe you're doing things you know is wrong. Maybe some that are watching, some that are here. I don't know. How do I get rid of that? How do I let go of that? Get in Christ. Let him be king. [Music] Are you tired of fussing and fighting and carrying on and no peace in the home? Let him be king in your home. You're tired of worry and depression taking you over and until it immobilizes you. Let him be king over that. Let him be king in your mind. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You just talk to him right now. Wherever you're sitting, if you you want to come pray, you're welcome to come. God knows your hearts. He knows my heart. Lord, Lord, I want to sit in heavenly places. How long's it been since you've been in a service that you really enjoyed being in that you knew everything was clear between you and God? Not because you're a good person, but because he took it away. It only takes a moment. Just a simple prayer. Lord, forgive me. And you really mean it. If you really mean it, he'll forgive you. Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're Lord, I see Lord, I I can see it on people's faces tonight. And I know my own heart is stirred. And Lord, we've not been stirred by the preaching of a man. We've been stirred by your word tonight, Lord. That we are sitting in heavenly places in Christ. Lord, would you take away all the dross, all the all the elements of sin, all the atmospheres of sin, oh God. Lord, I know I've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I know I've been changed, but Lord, change me again tonight. Refill me with the Holy Ghost. Oh God, if there's anything left that's unlike you, take it out of me, Lord. Let me be right. Oh God, let me be holy. Let me live according to your word. I pray you grant it, Lord Jesus. I pray for each one here tonight. Lord, that you just move in their homes, move in their lives, Lord. if they're tired of just up and down and in and out. Lord, may tonight be the night they get in their prayer closet and and and not give up, Lord, until you baptize them with fire. I pray you grant it, Lord. Oh, we thank you for these heavenly places. We thank you, Lord, for the an assurance that our peace is coming. Our our joy is coming and it's already in the land, but already belongs to us, but it's just waiting until the word, the moment, the fullness of time for us to enter into it. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I thank you for all that you've done. Thank you for these people who have waited patiently tonight and listened. I pray you'd bless them abundantly. Bless our mothers and fathers and students and teachers, Lord. Everyone, I pray you'd bless them. The leadership of the church. I thank you for them, Lord. I thank you for our deacons and our associate pastor and all everyone, Lord, that takes up the slack. Lord, when when things are maybe when I'm not here or something, Lord, I thank you for them. Lord, I pray you bless these young people that are coming to the banquet. Lord, may you protect them, Lord, as we were reminded again over the weekend how quickly things can change. I pray you'd protect our young people on the roads to the banquet. Lord, some coming from quite a ways, I pray that you'd bless them, Lord. I pray you'd fill them with the Holy Ghost, Lord, each one of us as well. We s we're so thankful for your love and your goodness. We thank you, oh God, in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Already done. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, it's already done. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; The battle is over.

Let's sing together. Oh, it's already done. Oh, why don't you praise the Lord? The battle battle is over. Oh, I'm glad the victory is won. It's already done. I want us to pray especially as they continue to play and I'll turn it over to brother Joel. But I I want us to pray especially for our young people. I was in the meetings this weekend and there's probably 4 or 500 young people there and kids and of all ages. I preached to the older group, probably somewhere maybe 80 or 90 kids over 21. And uh on uh Friday, talk to them just to give them some time because sometimes the devil when you get a little bit older with Ryan, it seems like the devil just attacks you that much more. Why haven't you done this or that or that with your life? And you want to give them let them know we care about them. So we're doing this banquet for that reason, too. But I was just struck by I was struck by how much trouble there is in the minds of our young people. They're they're good pe young we have the best young people on the face of the earth. But I there's so much trouble and I know some of you elder people struggle. I know you do. Especially as you get older and the devil battles your mind as you you get old enough where you can't it's harder to take care of yourself and you really struggle with that. But our young people struggle too tremendously in a way maybe that we didn't. Even I didn't. And there's a spiritual warfare going on. Many of them are sitting in heavenly places but they're fighting spiritual battles. And so constantly devil's telling them and we prayed for maybe a thousand young people over the weekend by the time we got done because they all come through the prayer line and they all they all come up and they they just kept coming up and by the time we got done praying for everybody I I realized some of the devil's fighting every one of them just like he's fighting you tonight trying to tell them they're not worthy and they don't have it and or or maybe they never get it. And then you got real serious needs. parents, if you if you don't know what's going on with your young people, you need to know what's going on. You need to be a part of their lives. &gt;&gt; Especially if they're in public school or if they're got friends that are worldly or even even in the church, you need to know what's going on. You need to ask them, talk to them, be a part of their lives because we there's just some awful things. I sat back there with some preachers behind the platform after the prayer line at about midnight after a 6-hour service and cried because of some of the things that we'd heard come across there. Oh God. Oh God. Some of you young people with desperate needs, we need to get them in the presence of the Lord. We should never surrender a service to the enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let a critical spirit come over you and say, "Well, I I just won't go to church. I I won't I'll sit there with a critical spirit cuz somebody did me wrong or somebody said something about me. Just let it go. Our young people are worth it. Our elders are worth it. Those that are out of the ark of safety today, and there's hundreds in this area that used to be in church at some point. You remember many of them used to be in the house of God. They're not there today. I believe God's going to go get them. But we got to get the atmosphere right. We need to be sitting together in heavenly places. Let's just do that. Can we do that? If we're asked to do something at work, let's just do it. If we're not asked to, maybe be a little bit offended, that's okay because maybe we were meant to just pray in that situation, right? So, let's just let's just get behind our young people. Do everything we can do. And above all, pray for them. Pray for my kids. Pray for these older ones. Pray for these younger ones. We got a bunch more coming up. Let's be in prayer for them. Not just in the school year, but every day of their lives. Amen. I We're going in a rapture one of these days. We might as well. We don't want to leave one hoof behind. As Moses said, we won't leave our children. We won't leave our cattle. We won't leave nothing. He said, "We're going to make a sacrifice of praise to God." Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight, Brother Joel, if you can come. I love you with all my heart. Thank you for putting up with me being gone. I believe it meant something to the kids that win and and those over there. God bless you now. Oh, it's already done. Oh yes, it's all already done. Hallelujah. It's all done. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. The victory. Oh, you believe that tonight? Yes, it's already done. Well, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. For my Lord. Oh, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Well, I promised him that I would serve him till I die. And I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Oh yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. For my Lord. Yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Well, I promise that I would serve him. Well, I'm on the battlefield. All clap your hands and sing them one more time. Oh yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Oh my Lord. Yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Well, I promised him that I would serve him till I die. And I'm on the battlefield. Let me hear you sing it one time before we go. Till I'm on the battlefield. For my Lord. Oh my Lord. Yes, I'm on the battlefield. Yes, we are. Well, I promise would serve him and I'm all for my Lord. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise. Amen. Aren't you thankful for the word of the Lord? Did you enjoy the message tonight? Amen. Give the Lord another hand clap and praise. Amen. Amen. I want to say, are you washed in the blood as we go? Amen. You're God bless you. I won't hold you any longer. Amen. Don't forget to be in prayer for our banquet for our young people and those of you that have uh that we we've texted and stuff about helping. Uh just be sure and make sure if you've been texting, haven't responded that you respond to Sister Virginia or myself and we'll sure put everybody we can to work. God bless you. Amen. We'll see you Sunday morning. Amen. God bless you. Be in prayer for our young people this weekend. Let's sing this as we go. Well, have you been to Jesus for the pleasing power? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you fully trusting in his grace this hour? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Oh, are you washed in the blood in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb? Are your garments spotless?
