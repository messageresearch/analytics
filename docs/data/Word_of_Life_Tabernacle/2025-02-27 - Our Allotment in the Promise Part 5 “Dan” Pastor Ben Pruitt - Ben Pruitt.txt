amen amen thank the Lord amen turn with me to Genesis chapter 49 it's good to have everybody out tonight on a Wednesday night I we've got some gone and some out on Wednesday but it's good to have you here tonight and good to have brother the Hatfield back there God bless you thank you for coming and brother Wendell and sister Fresca thank you all for coming tonight appreciate you being here it's hard to preach in front of some people but we just do our best amen Genesis chapter 49 it says dan shall judge his people verse 16 as one of the tribes of Israel for those of you that are uh thinking I'm out of order here I'm taking these tribes in birth order not order of blessing in birth order Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his writers shall fall backward I have waited for thy salvation oh Lord I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated as we get right into it tonight each one of Jacob's sons was named by the Holy Spirit through the pain of childbirth brother brandom taught us that names mean something in fact even titles mean something he said your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church the messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place so that's our desire tonight is to stay right with the word and feed in the shepherd's place he said because the word pasture means Shepherd look it up and find out if that ain't right Pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them with the word of God he said watch all those names they mean something every name in the Bible when you see one name in the Bible means something he said Israel's wives when they gave birth to the 12 Patriarchs each one of those mothers when they were having the baby the baby was being born and them groaning right they were groaning from the pain of childbirth and he said the very groans that they gave signified the nature of the child and the place they'd make their final resting place he said every groan amen under the power of the Holy Ghost brother Bram goes on to tell us that that we should Gran under the power that it's necessary for us to groan under the power of the Holy Ghost and he even says that real tongues and interpretation will come from that he said real speaking in tongues comes from groaning under the power of the Holy Ghost and God does that many times through pain in our lives through difficult situations through hard times in the church and hard times in our families that God actually causes us to speak speak during that time and and it's that speech that is inspired not when we're on the mountain but the inspired speech was actually actually came through pain and and so we we should say thank you for the pain Lord thank you for the hard times thank you for the trouble thank you for the struggle in my life because it's during those moments mother Danny that I could actually speak what God wanted me to say Amen so the inspiration come during the hard times and I found that that's true amen so we're dealing tonight with Jacob's fifth son the seventh in blessing order who was Rachel's uh by her proxy BHA her handmade and his name was Dan Genesis 30 and5 says billal conceived and bear Jacob a son and Rachel said God hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore she called his name Dan Dan means judge so when Jacob uh says in Genesis 49:16 Dan shall judge his people he's just using his name uh the name that was given him now the tribe of Dan was given an important spot in the land and remember that this parallels with our placing and our election so we want to pay a particular notice to this because sometimes we're given a spot that's very difficult we've talked about that already we're given a spot that's difficult to defend or a spot maybe that's got more Giants to face they were given a very difficult spot it was actually the spot on the coast if you can see that it's all the way on the Mediterranean Coast very close to uh the Philistine territory it was actually originally the land of the amorites it was the place where the amorites came from and they were the great enemies of God's people and so they would have to fight for that land and we got to fight for every inch of our land but there was a special fight that was given to them and and we got to remember what we fight is not always what somebody else fights right every family every individual every church every area of the country we all fight something different we're all fighting for the same thing our position in the land and you say well I could go somewhere else and and you'll find out that's actually what Dan did just to give you kind of a sneak preview they actually tried just to move somewhere else and and it would be better but that don't always fix things sometimes you just got to fight and win where you're at and you have the ability to win we've got the ability to win it's not time to jump ship it's time to fight the battle and keep on CU all he asked us to do is be faithful and his the results would matter with him he'll bring the results I'm so glad for that today cuz sometimes you can't see a way out you don't know why you're doing what you're doing yeah right when when when uh we've talked about it before but when they moved to Bethlehem when Rahab and her husband went to bethleem and founded that City they didn't know why they were digging a well they didn't know why they were uh maybe making a stable in a cave but the well would be one oh my the well would be one that David would long for the water from Hallelujah and the cave would be one maybe that that they had maybe dug it out by hand it would be maybe the one that Jesus was laid in and it happened hundred of years later so don't give up what you're doing keep digging keep working keep coming to church on Wednesday night cuz you never know what you might be doing for future Generations if the Lord terries so Dan was placed in a very particular uh situation to judge the enemies of God yeah and so in Genesis 15:16 uh God speaking to Abraham and saying how long of a time that the Israel ites would be in Egypt he said but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full brother Brown says it this way he told Abraham over in that land of the amorites their iniquity they were Gentiles now he said I can take you in there right now or I can't take you in there right now cuz the iniquity is not fold fold up yet he said but I will judge them I'll come in that fourth generation and I'll judge that Nation with a rod of iron this was the task given to Dan he was born in place to judge the amorites and his standard was the Flying Eagle he was the seventh in the blessing order so I think it has a lot to do with the age that we live in and the time that we've come to now uh he he could he should have soared above and and overcome and did all that but he couldn't do it and I think it was because as a tribe they just never could get over or conquer themselves and so they never did and we know that these things are written for our admonition because we have a Helper and remember that they didn't have the helper that we have we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to help us to take our land so I don't want us to get discouraged by each of these tribes as they didn't do what God called them to do or didn't take their land they were only a type of what we're supposed to be the reality of that we're supposed to actually move in and take our land there will be somebody that takes a Rapture somebody is going to do that there's going to be a people we might as well be us we might as well be the ones and believe that there's a possibility we can do that so they they should have done it now uh in Joshua 1940 when Joshua was dividing up the land it says the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families and the coast of their inheritance was Zora and ishall and erimish I have no idea if that's how you pronounce it but you don't know either so we'll just move on and if you go on down all the way to verse 47 he goes on to name about 17 cities if I counted correctly used all my fingers and toes to do that in Joshua 1947 it says the coast of the children of Dan and so they had all these cities that were in their territory went out too little for them so with all of that they still needed more yeah therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against leim and took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and dwelt therein and called leim Dan after the name of Dan their father so they have a territory given to them and a city that they've taken and called Dan now if you fast forward 300 years from the time of Joshua to the time of the judges you'll find that they did not possess even the city they named Dan in fact the Bible says that the amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley they were actually a tribe that was forced to camp out in the mountains I know some of y'all like to camp out but and you like to burn up the woods and stuff like that but but but but some of us you know my wife you can't hardly pay her to Camp she wants to camp in with a bed she wants to Camp with a an RV or something like that she don't want to camp in a tent but these people weren't doing it voluntarily they were forced to camp and they were camped out in the mountains because they could not take their land right and so you know and it affects your life because you you've got to be able to walk on the Promises you got to be able to take the land that's been given we have great and precious promises this day but you got to be able to walk out and take it you got to have something about you some Faith to be able to do that come on and some some purpose and some perseverance and some and some willingness right you can't just sit back and say well I'm predestined they were predestined to that land too but you got to be able to go out and take it but he said there would be a people in this age that would go out and take it so so they were forced to camp out in the mountains now during that time remember Dan means judge and there was an angel who appeared to a danite couple to tell them of a special birth and you've all heard the story and I won't go through it all tonight but the child was Samson the woman bear a son in in judges 13:24 and called his name Samson and the child grew and the Lord blessed him and the spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan right they don't have any place to call home just a camp between Zora and Esa and so brother Bram tells us about Samson and I won't get too deep into that tonight I want to save it for another time but he said we find that this Samson was a Nazarite he had seven little curls that hung down his back he said when the spirit of the Lord came upon him he feared nothing oh come on I like that brother BR tells us he was just a little shrimp but when the spirit of the Lord came on him he feared all that we could be like that tonight he feared nothing he said and and he said why he was persistent as long as he could feel that Nazarite vow with him he said as long as he could reach back here and feel those locks he knew he was in the will of God and nothing could bind him the city couldn't bind him a lion couldn't kill him he took the Jawbone of a mule and it dry and beat down a thousand Philistines with it he said on down he said how much ought the church tonight that claims that you're born of the spirit of God stand in the meeting see the Vindication of the resurrected Jesus Christ and claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost could sit still and let Satan push you around like he does you say well I haven't seen much I tell you what I've seen enough to tell me that God's real that he's the same yesterday today and forever I've seen the Vindication of God in this hour and so I have an obligation to stand for that word to stand up for what I believe and and to be more than just a a a push around for the enemy right we got to stop doing that you young men you got to get to a place where you push the devil around come on now where he pushes you around all the time our young families we you know we get pushed around everything the devil brings on us we say well I'm scared of this I'm scared of that we got to quit letting the devil push us around and begin to push the devil around he said it's a strange thing as long as you could Fe as long long as you can feel the presence of the Holy Ghost know that it's his word and his promise for this day you should be be persistent oh I think every service when we feel his presence here among us we ought to be persistent to press in until it's over oh if we could only do that perseverance stay with it God promised it it's not you it's God he reach back there and feel his locks but you remember what happened he lost his locks right gave the key to his locks to Delilah and gave her his secret yeah laying in the lap of Delah a type of the world he never does deliver the people the way Gideon did or Jeff or Deborah right or any of the other judges he never does deliver the people like the others he couldn't win the battle with himself and his greatest Victory comes when he finally he finally gets past himself and he dies in his greatest Victory right but the people are never delivered in the way that they are with Gideon or jeffa and Genesis 49:16 it says again I want to just read this so you'll understand this is I believe a prophecy of of of Samson as well he said Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel but then look at the next verse Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels yeah so that his rider shall fall backward and I want to challenge you young men just to kind of use a a play on words we know the head of the serpent was to be crushed by the woman se but Samson couldn't deal with himself right and and no matter how strong you are how anointed you are how predestined you are what family you come from now some of you know what I'm talking about tonight no matter what what how many times you've been in church maybe you're raised on a church pew and laid under it as a child maybe you broke your leg with somebody shouting on the church pew I know of somebody that actually had that happen you know and and and you you might have been in church all of your life and people may have think well you're a wonderful person but you got to have a new birth you've got to be able to take advantage you got to have the one who crushed the head of the serpent living in you or you'll never be able to overcome that part of you that will cause you to lose right to give in to give up and to not be able to fulfill your potential there's a part of you that it's like a snake you're born that way with that in your heart and it's got to be overcome by the New Birth the Holy Ghost brother BR said is a gift of God that comes upon you that changes you and I as I read this brother Stuart I got really burdened for our young people especially for our young men you know you got to have the Holy Ghost you got to have it you can't you're not going to be able it's going the persecution as far as the world goes the the Easy Living you'd say well I'm waiting on persecution to come we're living it it's all around us waiting on a squeeze you're living in the squeeze it's hard for people to go to church it's hard for them to be be a message believer and the devil's trying to tell you the little things don't matter anymore that's what brother Brown taught us about discre and those things how that those things wouldn't people wouldn't matter to people but but you got have the Holy Ghost to stand for the message when it doesn't make sense right when the preacher don't make sense and when Church don't make sense and it doesn't make Financial sense to go and it doesn't make the sense to you in any way and yet you there's something in your heart it says I'm going to live for God anyway I'm going to I'm going to touch I'm going to cry out to God anyway I'm going to pray anyway in spite of everything so you got to have that brother s gift of God that comes upon you that changes you makes you allog together different from what the world is and what the other people are you are different you don't have to dress any different you don't have to put on a round collar and a long robe you live different you act different the power of God is with you the people know you are marked whever you go so your girlfriend knows if you're a Christian your boyfriend knows if you're a Christian the people at work know if you're a Christian the people at church they may be the last ones to know but they probably know look why because you act different the power of God is with you the people know and you are marked brother said what was that in that Samson what was in that Samson a woman Chaser sure he said he was arrogant disobedient to his father and mother they told him not to go down there with that woman at Jezebel but he wouldn't listen to him what was it Samson had strength oh church I I hope you're hearing me tonight just because we can play in church play a m instrument doesn't mean we're where we're supposed to be come on just because we can take up an offering doesn't mean that we're where we're supposed to be just because we can look good and act good around the church doesn't mean we're where we're supposed to be Samson gave gave God his strength but he gave his heart to Delilah so I want to challenge you tonight and ask you as we're talking about this tribe of Dan that never did fulfill what God wanted them to do have you given your heart to God have you given him your heart have you surrendered your heart to him or have you just given him your maybe lip service maybe you just gave him well I was baptized maybe you maybe a giv well I I I've been in the church for a while and everything seemed to be going good so I I think I'm probably a Christian what are you giving him tonight you might as well give him your all you young men might as well give him your all you young ladies might as well give him your all older folks All Of Us Together We ought to give him everything that we have he said but it's just Wednesday night brother Ben we ought to give him all of her heart on a Wednesday night he wouldn't give his heart to God he give that to Delilah brother Bron said God has an awful time getting a fellow to yield to him right and that's what it is is just yielding just yielding that that that that will entitle You full obedience yielding to the word of God entitles you to the Token God has an awful time getting a fellow and if you're that fellow sitting here tonight you might as well give in amen might as well just let him have full control all right yes get fell a yield to him like Samson Samson was kind of a ladies man he yielded his strength to God but wouldn't give his heart to God right he give that to the and that's all God could use was his strength and just as much as you'll give to him that's what he can use of you and so many people are fooled by that because Samson could look at his life and say well I picked up door the gates of the city yes sir and I was anointed to do it and he was and then go and go down with a prostitute yeah right I felt good in church I've been told that in counseling that someone commit an awful sin and then then come say well I I I thought it was okay because I I still raised my hands and felt the presence of God in church but just because you're anointed doesn't mean you're saved just because you can do play music and and and gifts and callings are without repentance just because you can preach doesn't mean you're saved but you got to give your heart to God hallah do it with all your heart and you might as well well because you you can't exist in that in between place where you're back and forth and waffling and you cause problems in the church and problems everywhere you go problems in a marriage problems at home why because you just can't decide who you are what you want to be you might as well give up and let God take him that part was free good just as much as you'll give to him that's what he can use of you he said let's just give all to him could we do that tonight say here I am Lord just take me because Samson wouldn't give him his heart he ended up a blind prisoner standing between two pillars can you imagine what he must have been thinking God raised Samson up to destroy that nation that was the very purpose of bringing him on brand said if God can only find one man that's all he needs one man that can fully surrender someone say it with me fully surrender one man I want to be that man tonight I want to be that man if I haven't been that man let me be that man amen I can fully surrender Oh my he said and everything fully surrender to him he don't take an army he never did use that he only uses a man now Samson gave God his strength to use but he didn't give God his heart he give his heart to Delilah give his strength to God but you got to surrender soul body Spirit strength everything you are to the will of God become a prisoner to him you're going to be somebody's prisoner see Samson ended up being the philistine prisoner but when he surrendered himself oh church when he surrendered himself completely to God he was no man's prisoner anymore but he committed himself over to God you don't belong to yourself you're either the devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's prisoner to righteous you're one or the other but Samson never gained that complete Victory and the danites never did possess the ground that God gave them in Moses blessing in Deuteronomy 33 he speaks of the danites he says of Dan he said Dan is a lion's welp he shall leap from Bashan he's a church Hopper that's not inspired come on just me man leaped what's actually what they did they actually moved from their land and you see where their land was it's down about the middle over on the coast and so they they just couldn't take and so they moved all the way to the northernmost part of Israel and until their name actually becomes synonymous with the farthest reaches of Israel in First Kings 4:25 it says and you've heard this expression before Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his Vine under his fig tree from Dan even to beerseba that's the northernmost part of Israel to the southernmost part of Israel all the days of Solomon so the the story of their move is found in judges 18 and you remember Samson was in chapter 16 and then in chapter 17 there there's a a man named Micah it's a really strange and kind of funny story uh of a man who uh who uh was a levite and and he come by a house the house of a man named Micah so basically Micah bought himself an evangelist I'm a pastor so it's easy to say that you know Micah bought himself an evangelist go read the story when you have time and and he bought him for 10 shekels and a suit 10 Joel's about to get up and go you know 10 10 shekels in a suit you know he's going to just and in judges 17:13 he said then said Micah now know I that the Lord will do me good seeing I have a levite to my priest he made him a house Church set up church and just said we're going to start our own denomination we got a levite and he gathered some Idols he put them there with the levite see we are not hirelings we've not been hired to preach we've been called to preach in Judges chapter 18 it says and so that happened in chapter 17 in chapter 18 in those days there was no king in Israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell For unto that day all their inheritance had not Fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel and the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their Coast Men of Valor from Zora and from eall remember that's where Samson was despy out the land to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah they lodged there they come by this same house church when they were by the house of Micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite Evangelist and they turned in thither and said to him what who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here and he said unto them thus and thus dealth Micah with me and hath hired me and I am his priest and they said unto him ask counsel of God that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous and the priest said unto them go in peace before the Lord is your way wherein you go I don't think he consulted the scripture I don't think he consulted Joshua's they were not meant to be placed in that land in fact the land they were going to was part of another tribe's territory come on it wasn't supposed to belong to them but they were going to go take it or so they thought they were and so on the way there they go by Micah's house and and he his priest tells him what they want to hear so they steal his images and and his priest and so the priest the left for a bigger Church I mean he did the Bible says these went in Micah's House fetch the carved image and the ephod and the ter from the molten image and said to the priest to them what do you and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth quit preaching for a minute go with us be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest into the house of one man or that thou be a priest to a tribe big church come on family in I'm goingon to get myself in trouble tonight well Wendell I'm sorry and and the priest's heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teram and the Graven image and went in the midst of the people he's just oh I'm so happy I got to go to this bigger group but look at verse 27 they took the things which Micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto leish unto a people that were quiet and secure and they smoke them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire just because you can possess a territory now listen there's a scriptural principle here just because you can do something doesn't mean you should they could not possess what was given them so they went to possess someone else's and they were able to do it right but it didn't make it right and the Bible says that there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and and and they had no business with any man it was in the valley that lth by Beth Rob and they built a city and dwelt therein they called the name of the city Dan after the name of Dan their father who was born unto Israel how be it the name of C the city was leish at the first and the children of Dan set up the Graven image and Jonathan the son of gersam the son of Manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the Captivity of the land and they set them up Micah's grave and image which he made all the time that the house of God was in shoh it looked L like they were very prosperous in what they did and the tribe of Dan did well in their new territory but they were the very first Israelite tribe to embrace idolatry okay the very first now fast forward a few hundred more years there's a king named jeroboam remember the kingdom split between north and south and there's a king named jeroboam over over the northern part Israel the 10 tribes 10 Northern tribes including Dan and jeroboam said in his heart he said now shall the kingdom return to the House of David he's thinking how can I keep my kingdom how can I build my kingdom and make it last okay so this is what he says in his heart he says if they go up to this Jerusalem then the heart of the people will return to the Lord even to rabom King of Judah they shall kill me and go again to rabom King of Judah so it's a political move right yeah we shouldn't think like that church and I know I know it's done but we shouldn't do things out of politics but because it's the right thing to do God don't move by politics but too many times preachers move out of politics we shouldn't do that God help us amen and the King took counsel made two calves of gold and said to them it is too much for you to go up to to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods so I love that he makes it easy for them you and you see the the way that they're going you young people see that here what was it Samson took the easy route ended up a prisoner right it was too hard for him maybe to not not do what he did and so he he took the easy route and ends up a prisoner the danites took the easy route and instead of taking their land they moved off and took somebody else's right Jobo takes the easy route and tells the people he said hey it's so far to go to Jerusalem it it's too much to have a move of the Holy Ghost in the church on it's too much to to preach the new birth it's too much to preach the the presence of God and and that we need Holiness in our lives and that the message is still the same and that that we don't get the opportunity to change it's too much come on now right so why don't you go up to he said behold thy Gods it's too much yeah to preach things the way brother brandham taught them it's too much to stay with the law of Moses so let's just let's just make a new God come on Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set the one in bethl that's in Ephraim and the other put he in Dan and this thing become because the northernmost tribes could go there yeah made it easy on them this thing become a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan so the idolatry that was had already been introduced and then Jobo brings it in and sets it up a pagan form of of Judaism a pagan form of of their religion and God never did forget it right so brother Brandon come we we come all the way around now you think well brother BR are you just preaching this without any backup in the message no because brother brandom in the seventh seal deals with these tribes now if you go to and I don't have time tonight to to go there and read it but Revelation 7 you'll find two tribes are missing from the list of tribes that are represented in the 144,000 Jews now how many know what the 144,000 Jews are are they are the ones who are uh saved during the tribulation period right that that Israel saved as a nation during that time right that that see his nail scars and Christ appears all of those things that happened during the tribulation period after the gospel goes back to the Jews so the 144,000 Jews are represented by tribe but God actually takes out Dan and Ephraim out of the Revelation and puts in uh puts in Joseph and Levi now brother brand tells us why he said Revelation 7 Dan and Ephraim is missing and not numbered with them did you notice that Joseph and Levi were substituted in their place why the ever remembering God remembers every promise amen of his word so in the seventh seal brother Bram takes us to Deuteronomy chapter 29 are you still with me tonight I I don't want to bore you on he said he said for you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how he came through the Nations which you passed by you've seen their Abominations you've seen their denom nationalism and their idols and wood and stone and silver and gold oh which were among the church we don't want to go back we don't want to go back we want to go forward we want to go up so but you said you saw the idols he said L there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day notice what turned the heart brother B said that Samson gave God he gave God his strength but he gave Delilah his heart and he said if there if idolatry starts in the heart listen don't you put nothing in front of God amen amen don't let anything else have your heart amen hallelujah L there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turth away yes a heart turn away you don't you just don't want it anymore the desire the heart is your desire you just don't want the things of God you just you begin to want the things of the world whose heart turneth away they stay from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gall and warmwood and it come to pass when he hear the words of this curse he bless himself in his heart like some people hear preaching and they never get it right it just he hears the word but He blesses him self he hears the word about idolatry he says it's not me but it is yeah and and and that he bless himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst brother BR said even even they'll drink and not think anything about it yeah drink alcohol and claim to be Christian go to church claim to have the Holy Ghost he said the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven and the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the Covenant that are written in the book of the law I know it's heavy right now but we're coming to A A better part A glimmer of hope but brother Brown said did you notice it was to be blotted out why under Heaven there was no immediate sacrifice that could give him the Holy Spirit he said to let him see these things you realize what a blessing it is to have the Holy Spirit and conviction in our hearts what a blessing it is to know when you're wrong what a blessing it is to be able to go on a Wednesday night and feel that conviction in your heart don't don't just bypass that that's important yes sir it's the Holy Ghost it's the work of the Holy Ghost In Your Heart yeah you're going to do some things that aren't right you're going to fall along the way make mistakes and things like that but there's something in your heart you immediately repent why you have the Holy ghostless hallelujah amen good if you don't have him you can't see right so true so true you can't see your own heart you can't see your own attitudes you can't see your own motives amen it could give him the Holy Spirit to let him see these things but he did it anyhow in his own selfish mind right but Ezekiel in his vision in the Millennium he sees him again in perfect order that's in Ezekiel 48 and also in Revelation 14 John seen them again in tribal order that's right every tribe to his place what happened you remember he said under the heavens his name would be blotted out of the tribal Affair as long as he was under the heavens there would be no more and this going to get sticky for just a moment he said this 144,000 is down here in the tribal part yet so he's telling us they didn't have an opportunity said you see they'v been blinded they they had only the sacrifice of of BS and goats see I notice he blotted them out under the heaven right under the heaven come on but there was hope in the in the Millennium it turned out right but the Gentile in the days of the Holy Spirit against that your name was taken completely off The Book of Life could never have forgiveness in this world or the world to come that's right so there is where we stand now that's pretty that's pretty serious isn't it right I think we ought to take it serious because we have no excuse right because the Holy Ghost is to us to our children to them that are far off it's a promise to us listen to me church if you don't have it and you know you don't have it you need to be seeking it come on come on we have no excuse amen Hebrews 6 and4 tells us it's impossible for those who are once enlightened have tasted the Heavenly gift were made partakers of the Holy Ghost have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing They Crucified themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame it's impossible but I I'm so glad that he didn't stop there CU if you go down to verse n he said but beloved we are persuaded better things of you all right yeahall come on right so in the Gentile age you one word against the Holy Ghost you could be you could be taken off the book of life and never have a chance to come back right right yeah right but look what brother brandom says about this verse in Hebrews he said see what he's talking about he's not talking about Christians Falling Away impossible to come back oh Church there's a there's hope for Christians There's Hope for you why because you didn't just Taste of the things of God and then walk away from it you weren't a carnal believer you received him and so if you have the opportunity today listen it's a dangerous thing to be a carnal believer but if you've received him and I trust that we have tonight here on a Wednesday night I trust we've all received him if we've received him if we if we've we walked in the spirit if we've become if he's lived his life in us we might fall but look he said he's talking about carnal believers who go through the form of reformation yeah they find themselves with no atonement oh church but he said to you who was born again you who are Christian beloved we're persuaded better things of you oh church I'm persuaded better things of Word of Life Tabernacle tonight right uh things that accompany salvation why because I believe God called me to preach to you and if God called you to this message there must have been a reason for it there must have been a reason why I called me must have been a reason why I called you must have been a reason you found out about the message of the hour what was it you were not of those who go back you are of those who believe sir oh I'm so glad to be one of those number that what couldn't be blotted out all right though we had all those things in our heart that serpent in our heart are you with me now now but yet there was some way that we overcame it what was it he crushed the head of the serpent Hallelujah he died for my Redemption it all comes back to the Cross Church have you noticed how almost every tribe it comes back to the Cross comes back to he died for you to make you new you're one of those people you he said you don't say those things you don't live that type of life you're secured with Christ as I'm closing as the musician has come he said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of Redemption how could you fall away it's impossible for you to fall away and yet he tells us don't grieve him I want to take all my land I don't want to be a danite I want to be I want to be of the tribe of Judah the tribe of Judah Lion of the tribe of Judah he overcame he prevailed Dan didn't Prevail Samson couldn't Prevail even David of the tribe of Judah didn't Prevail over himself but Jesus did aren't you glad that he did that gives us hope tonight that gives us Faith to believe we can make it we're going to make it it's not the end of the story you might have made a mistake but that's not the end of your story there's more for you there's a way to come back back would you bow your heads with me as they begin to play how did Samson finally get the victory he died to [Music] himself only the woman's seed could crush the head of the serpent only his spirit in you will make it where you can never fall away oh I want that Assurance tonight I trust that you do if you don't have it and you're here tonight I pray that it just burn inside of you do you get it you young men if you're battling you battle things we do as men and young women battle things married couples battle things remember it's not the end you were you're not of those who go back you're fighting a battle but but learn to win the object is not to remain that way the rest of your life the object is to win and you can't do that without the Holy Ghost you can't even see where you're wrong without the Holy Ghost so I say tonight that's what we need that's what we need so we don't follow the example of the tribe of Dan but we can by his Spirit living in us follow the example of the Lion of the tribe of Judah who overcame by becoming a lamb when John looked he said the lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed but when he looked he saw a lamb the lion of the tribe of Judah overcame by coming a lamb you overcome I overcome by surrendering ourselves would you just do that tonight brother brand taught us that raising our hands was a form of surrender we just do that to him all of us tonight Lord I give everything to you I give you everything I give you my heart and all of his deepest darkest Secrets I give you my mind I give you my body my soul I give you everything Lord I want you I want to be all the way Lord I don't want to be a halfway believer I want to be on fire for you I want to give you my heart Lord so I wouldn't fall in that way Lord I don't want to fall away I believe that you can keep me Lord and I want to be serve you with all of my heart Heavenly Father Lord with our hands raised to you and our hearts raised as well I pray God that we would surrender everything we surrender our mind surrender our heart surrender our vessel oh God surrender our money surrender our our talents surrender everything Lord not to a man but to you oh God take it oh Lord whatever I think I am whatever I think I have Lord let me surrender it to you oh God lord I don't want to follow the example of a tribe that didn't take their land but I want to be one who takes every promise that you've given in this age I pray you grant it Lord I don't want to be find myself in the trash heap of ministers along the way but I want to be one Lord who follows you all the way though though it may not look to the world like much happens in my life but let me be in your will Lord that's what what I want that's what we want Lord we want to be in your will it may not look like much on a Wednesday night but we're in your will
