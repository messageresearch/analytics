[33:39] what it is. I pray you would meet that
[33:41] need tonight, Lord, that you would
[33:42] completely change the situation as only
[33:46] you can. I pray you'd grant it now in
[33:48] Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[33:54] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Appreciate the
[33:56] presence of the Lord tonight in our
[33:58] service. We just uh love each one of
[34:01] you. Good to be here on a Wednesday
[34:03] night. Ephesians chapter 1:es 3-6.
[34:06] Tonight, Ephesians 1 3-6.
[34:09] U this Sunday, we'll have our regular
[34:12] service on Sunday morning. Sunday
[34:14] afternoon, we're going to have church at
[34:16] 3:00, but what we're going to do is a
[34:18] little bit different. We're going to
[34:19] lean into our youth a little bit. And uh
[34:22] we're going to have a youth service, but
[34:23] it won't be quite like what we've done
[34:26] in the past. We're going to have a youth
[34:28] service for the youth. So, what that
[34:31] means is you old people don't have to be
[34:33] here if you don't want to be. But, uh
[34:35] you if you do come, welcome to sit in
[34:37] the back and watch and partake in the
[34:39] service, but the uh young people, we're
[34:42] just going to lean into that for all of
[34:44] our young people Sunday school age and
[34:46] up. Uh we sure want you to be a part of
[34:48] that. And so, that'll be at 3 o'clock
[34:50] with the Joel's going to be preaching to
[34:52] them, something specific for them. And
[34:54] we're going to try to get feedback from
[34:56] them and and just have a a real youth
[34:59] service. They're going to be playing the
[35:00] instruments and and uh doing taking
[35:03] every part of the service. So have a
[35:05] youth song leader and everything. So
[35:07] we're looking forward to doing that. And
[35:09] how many love our young people? I I know
[35:11] that you do because you put so much
[35:13] effort and work into into them this last
[35:16] weekend. But that was our older youth
[35:19] especially got to benefit from that. But
[35:21] this we want to be for all of our young
[35:23] people, even our school age children.
[35:25] And so we're looking forward to that.
[35:26] But we'll have our regular service on
[35:28] Sunday morning as usual and our our
[35:30] dinner as well. Amen. Ephesians chapter
[35:33] 1 and verse three.
[35:36] It says, "Blessed be the God and Father
[35:39] of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
[35:42] blessed us with all spiritual
[35:44] blessings." Aren't you glad they're here
[35:46] tonight? All spiritual blessings are
[35:49] right here among us. Amen. Because we
[35:52] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now
[35:54] he said in in heavenly places in Christ
[35:58] in heavenly places in Christ that's
[36:01] where we are according as he hath chosen
[36:03] us in him before the foundation of the
[36:05] world that we should be holy and without
[36:07] blame before him in love having
[36:09] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[36:12] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[36:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[36:17] will to the praise of the glory of his
[36:19] grace wherein he made us accepted in the
[36:23] beloved. Aren't you glad to be accepted
[36:25] tonight? God bless you as you have your
[36:27] seats. Forgive me. My voice is not good
[36:29] at all tonight. I've been struggling
[36:31] with the same thing that many of you
[36:33] have been struggling with. So, y'all
[36:34] just pray for me tonight. When we think
[36:36] of heavenly places, we think of heavenly
[36:39] in the sense of experience. And I want
[36:42] to deal with heavenly places again
[36:44] tonight because I think it's important
[36:46] to us to understand that there is not
[36:49] just a place that we are that is
[36:51] heavenly place. It's a heavenly in the
[36:54] sense of experience, but it's a heavenly
[36:56] place in the sense that uh it's it's
[36:59] what God has called us to the position
[37:02] he's called us to be in. And in that
[37:04] heavenly place is actually where we
[37:06] fight our battles here on the earth. And
[37:09] that's what I want to title this tonight
[37:10] is the battle in heavenly places. So, a
[37:14] heavenly place. If I if you were to tell
[37:15] me uh that you went on a trip and it was
[37:18] heavenly, I wouldn't expect you to then
[37:21] tell me that you fought a battle while
[37:23] you were there.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Because a battlefield would be what we
[37:26] would think of as the opposite of a
[37:28] heavenly place.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; But a heavenly place would be in in our
[37:33] vernacular would be something that would
[37:34] be a beautiful place, perfect weather,
[37:37] everybody treats you nice and everybody
[37:40] does what they're supposed to do. But
[37:42] that's not at all what Paul was
[37:43] referring to. The word heavenly simply
[37:46] means in heaven or of heavenly things
[37:48] relating to heaven or the sky. And and
[37:52] it's the place where God dwells.
[37:53] Heavenly places, spiritual places, a
[37:56] spiritual realm. Look how Paul uses that
[37:59] in chapter 3 of Ephesians.
[38:02] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 10. He
[38:05] says to the intent that now unto the
[38:08] principalities and powers in heavenly
[38:11] places. So he says there are
[38:13] principalities, there are rulers and
[38:15] there are powers in heavenly places. He
[38:18] might be known by the church the
[38:20] manifold wisdom of God. Uh in another
[38:23] version it says so that through the
[38:25] church the manifold wisdom of God might
[38:29] now be made known to the rulers and
[38:32] authorities in the heavenly places. So
[38:34] it God is going to use the church to
[38:37] show the plan of God and the wisdom of
[38:40] God to these authorities and rulers in
[38:44] heavenly places. Who are these
[38:46] authorities and rulers? Ephesians
[38:48] chapter 6 and verse 12, Paul says, "We
[38:51] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[38:54] against principalities." There's that
[38:56] word again. Rulers against powers
[38:58] against the rulers of the darkness of
[39:00] this world against spiritual wickedness
[39:03] in high. And that word high is the same
[39:06] word used that Paul uses for heavenly in
[39:09] heavenly places. Spiritual wickedness in
[39:12] heavenly places. So it's actually a
[39:15] place of contest, a place of battle.
[39:18] It's a place. It's a position, but it's
[39:20] a position that we know we can win
[39:22] because remember, we have been raised
[39:24] with Christ into this battlefield, into
[39:27] this place. So, we know not only can we
[39:30] win, but we've already won the battle
[39:32] because he overcame for us.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; But we're not going to be able to just
[39:36] sit there and take it and say, "Well,
[39:39] you know, I've been I've been filled
[39:40] with the Holy Ghost. Everything's going
[39:41] to be good now." But it's actually a
[39:43] time of battle. Brother Brandham uses
[39:45] this scripture in a in a message called
[39:47] the contest. And he he likens the
[39:50] struggle that we're in to a great tug of
[39:52] war where the Indians would try to pull
[39:55] their opponent by brute strength across
[39:58] a fire. And it's kind of a brutal game,
[40:02] but that's what they would do. They
[40:03] would pull each other across the fire
[40:06] into the fire. And he said, "The devil's
[40:07] trying to pull us into the fire and and
[40:11] using his strength to do that." That's
[40:13] the battle that we're in. And he taught
[40:16] us that we must train for this battle by
[40:18] using the word. And he said we begin
[40:21] training. He said with John 3:16,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; right? That's where we begin training.
[40:27] God so loved the world, he gave his only
[40:28] begotten son. He said begin right there.
[40:31] Begin your training. He said, then you
[40:33] can go out and begin to fight the devil
[40:36] with the word. So, if you haven't ever
[40:38] entered into this contest, you begin
[40:40] with John 3:16 and you follow that with
[40:43] Acts 2:38 and you follow that with
[40:45] Ephesians 1. You you keep going with the
[40:47] word and you keep fighting your battle.
[40:49] And as you become trained, then you
[40:51] begin to use that in the battlefield
[40:54] that you're in in heavenly places in
[40:56] Christ. So the battlefield that we're
[40:59] fighting in in heavenly places, it
[41:02] actually takes form and the battle is
[41:05] joined in the mind. Brother Brandham
[41:07] said that was the no man's land that was
[41:09] given for the battle between good and
[41:11] evil. It's a battle between good and
[41:13] evil and and the mind is the no man's
[41:15] land. So it's a battle between faith and
[41:17] doubt, a contest of strength and it's a
[41:20] battle to control our thoughts.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Right. And whoever controls the thought
[41:26] life controls the battlefield,
[41:30] &gt;&gt; right? So that's the the land that's
[41:34] being fought over is the your thoughts.
[41:37] So it's it's for a person
[41:40] for who is sitting in heavenly places
[41:43] that you know you you sit there and
[41:45] think well if I'm in heavenly places if
[41:47] I'm the elected of God if I've been
[41:49] chosen by God if I am in Christ why is
[41:53] it that I I struggle in my thought life.
[41:57] Well, that's actually when you would
[41:59] struggle
[42:00] &gt;&gt; in your thought life,
[42:02] &gt;&gt; right? Because before you you maybe
[42:04] never even thought about those things,
[42:06] but now the devil's trying to get you to
[42:09] think the wrong things and then to act
[42:12] on those thoughts. And so and so that is
[42:15] actually when you would have it when you
[42:16] are in heavenly places. You've taken
[42:18] your position on the battlefield. You're
[42:21] now a warrior for the king. So, so that
[42:25] is the kind of person that actually
[42:27] would begin to fight in those ways. Now,
[42:30] if you just give into it, you don't
[42:31] fight. But as long as there's a battle,
[42:33] it means that means you haven't given
[42:35] in. It means you haven't been run over.
[42:37] It means that that it's possible. You
[42:39] know, somebody asked me said, "Well,
[42:41] have I blasphemed God?" If you had
[42:43] blasphemed God, there would be no
[42:44] battle. It would be over. You the devil
[42:47] would have won. But if you still
[42:49] fighting the battle, it means if those
[42:51] thoughts are still there, I want to be a
[42:52] Christian. and I want to be right. I
[42:54] want to do the right thing. It means
[42:55] that God still has a place for you.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; There's still a battle to be fought.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; So,
[43:05] it's possible, and I want you to listen
[43:07] to me. I want you young people to listen
[43:09] to me. And every one of us need to hear
[43:11] this. It's possible for a person sitting
[43:14] in heavenly places who is a born again
[43:17] Holy Ghostfilled believer
[43:20] who is that the person that we're
[43:21] preaching to tonight. It's possible for
[43:24] that person to be to say or do things
[43:28] that do not reflect the state of their
[43:31] soul.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Because that it would be just a
[43:36] moment of weakness in the battle. But it
[43:40] doesn't I'm so glad that doesn't mean
[43:43] that he got me right. If I make a
[43:45] mistake, I know I have an advocate with
[43:47] the father that he's able to forgive me
[43:50] in a moment of time
[43:52] &gt;&gt; and we just move on. And a lot of
[43:53] maturity is learning how to deal with
[43:56] our mistakes
[43:58] &gt;&gt; and not just wallowing in them.
[44:01] So, brother Brandham is asked the
[44:04] question. And he said, "Is it possible
[44:05] for a Holy Ghost filled person to be
[44:07] influenced to do minor things he doesn't
[44:09] want to do?" And he said, "Oh yes, yes,
[44:12] sir. Yeah, a Holy Ghost filled person,
[44:13] you're right in the place then to be
[44:16] drove by these things. You just put
[44:18] yourself up a target." I know that
[44:21] doesn't feel very heavenly, but it's
[44:23] it's the place where uh you you've been
[44:25] put into a position for a reason. you've
[44:28] been put in this and I mean position by
[44:30] position I don't mean this instance of a
[44:32] pastor or something like that I mean the
[44:34] pos your position in Christ
[44:37] &gt;&gt; right all of us have a position in
[44:39] Christ in heavenly places and we've been
[44:41] put there for a reason to fight now he
[44:44] said when you're down there serving the
[44:46] devil he just lets you slouch around any
[44:49] way you want to
[44:51] right the devil don't care but once you
[44:54] take a stand for Christ you've got on
[44:56] the other side. Then he trains every gun
[45:00] right around on you right now and you
[45:04] put on the uniform right and now you
[45:07] become a target. He said every
[45:10] temptation, everything that could be
[45:12] throwed to you, then you got it. But
[45:16] what have you got? What do we have
[45:18] tonight, church? What do we have? We've
[45:20] got greater is he that's in you than he
[45:23] that's in the world. So we know going in
[45:26] that our team, our captain, our king is
[45:30] stronger than Oh, hallelujah. When the
[45:32] devil's trying to pull you through the
[45:34] fire, remember the one on your side is
[45:36] stronger.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he every
[45:43] temptation now to be tempted is not to
[45:46] sin.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; We need to understand that. Brother
[45:49] Brandon in one place even said that
[45:51] Jesus endured sexual temptation.
[45:54] because he was tempted, the Bible says,
[45:55] in all manner like we are,
[45:59] &gt;&gt; right? He endured all kinds of
[46:00] temptation like we do, but he didn't
[46:03] never give into it,
[46:05] &gt;&gt; right? He was sinless. Now, we've given
[46:06] into it at times,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; right? In different ways and different
[46:10] kinds of temptation, but yet there is a
[46:13] victory that we can have,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; but to be tempted is not to sin.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Now, he said every temptation will be
[46:20] thrown at you. He said, 'Now, you wasn't
[46:22] in no battle here. You was just slopping
[46:24] along. But now, you've cleaned up.
[46:26] You've dressed up. You've shaved. You've
[46:28] combed your hair. You put on a uniform.
[46:30] You got a gun in your hand. Let's go.
[46:32] See, you're in battle. Not to show off,
[46:34] but to fight.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Fight. Fight."
[46:40] Said that before Trump did.
[46:44] He said, "Sure. When the temptations
[46:46] arise with the spirit, the shield of
[46:48] faith," he said, "buck it off and move
[46:51] on." See, that's right. Put on the whole
[46:53] armor of God. Why do you put on an armor
[46:55] if you're not going to fight? All
[46:57] soldiers are dressed to fight, not to
[46:59] show off. Walk out and say, "I'm so and
[47:01] so. I'm a Christian. See who I am. I
[47:03] belong to so- and so. Hallelujah. I got
[47:05] the Holy Ghost the other night. Sure.
[47:06] Nothing bothers me anymore." He said,
[47:08] "Uhuh. Oh, brother. I believe you better
[47:10] go back and try again."
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You're going to have plenty of
[47:13] trouble. But remember, can we remember
[47:16] tonight? You're I'm trying to bring it
[47:18] to your reme to your remembrance, to
[47:20] your memory. Greater is he that's in you
[47:22] than he that's in the world.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to face opposition.
[47:30] Now, how do you deal with the opposition
[47:32] that you face? You say, "Well, I'm
[47:34] overwhelmed."
[47:36] Well, the only way you see because this
[47:40] is why Jesus said, "Sufficient to the
[47:41] day is the evil thereof." Because if you
[47:43] face opposition all at once, you're
[47:46] going to feel overwhelmed.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; But what do you do? What you have to do
[47:49] today,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; right? That's the only thing you can
[47:52] face is what you have to deal with
[47:54] today.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; What do you face? What's in front of
[47:57] you?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Right? What's hindering you? What's
[48:00] stopping you? That's what you fight.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; You fight that. Well, I can't fight the
[48:04] whole army, right? And that's where so
[48:06] many battles are lost because individual
[48:08] soldiers look out at the the state of
[48:11] the entire battle and say, "Well, I
[48:13] might as well give in because we're
[48:14] losing." Right? Now, we know we can't
[48:17] lose, but it might appear that way
[48:19] sometimes. So, but if we could hone that
[48:22] down to just what we're facing, whatever
[48:24] you're facing, if the devil's trying to
[48:26] bring depression on you or anxiety or
[48:28] maybe there's some besetting sin or
[48:30] something that you're facing, fight
[48:32] there. Yeah,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; right. Overcome there. Take care of that
[48:36] situation. Don't try to solve everybody
[48:38] else's problems. You can't solve
[48:40] everybody's problems. You can't deal
[48:42] with everything going on in the message.
[48:44] You can't deal with everything going on
[48:45] in the church. Fight what's in front of
[48:47] you.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham talked about that.
[48:53] He illustrated that by giving us the
[48:55] illustration of Peter Cartrite and the
[48:56] drunkard. You've heard the story. Peter
[48:58] Cartwright goes to have a meeting and
[49:00] he's fixing up the the hall where he's
[49:02] going to have the meeting and painting
[49:04] it and doing fixing it up and he goes in
[49:06] there to uh to do that and a drunkard
[49:09] comes in. He swore he wouldn't let him
[49:10] have the meeting and he come in there
[49:12] and he said I've told everybody I'm not
[49:14] going to let you have this meeting. He
[49:16] said he said I I'm going he said uh he
[49:18] said I'm going to stand in the way. I'm
[49:20] not going to let it happen. And and and
[49:21] and Peter Cartwright said okay. He said
[49:24] well I guess I'm going to have to whoop
[49:25] you first,
[49:26] right? because the drunk wasn't going to
[49:28] let him have it. So what's he got to do?
[49:30] Whoop the drunk,
[49:33] &gt;&gt; right? That because that what was what
[49:34] was standing between him and having the
[49:36] meeting, doing what God called him to
[49:38] do. And so he said he rolled up his
[49:40] sleeves and he said if I he said if I if
[49:42] I should rain, I must fight if I should
[49:44] reign increase my courage, Lord. And
[49:46] said he went to pounding on him. And
[49:48] pretty soon the drunk said enough. And
[49:49] he come that night and got saved.
[49:53] But now, Brother Brandham tells us, he
[49:55] said, "Don't use your fists." It's an
[49:58] important caveat there.
[50:00] He said, "Don't use your fist." But he
[50:02] he says, "There you are. See, it's take
[50:04] the word of God. Cut your way through
[50:06] every doubt.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; See, sure. That's it." He said, "That's
[50:10] the next job."
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Let's get it done.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Instead of worrying about what
[50:16] everybody else is doing and what
[50:17] everybody else is facing and let's just
[50:19] get it done. Let's get this next job
[50:22] done. Lord, whatever I'm in need of
[50:24] tonight, whatever I'm facing, let me get
[50:26] that done.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Then we'll move on to the next job.
[50:29] Maybe we can help somebody else.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; But take care of that demon in front of
[50:33] you first. Let's get rid of that doubt
[50:34] that you're dealing with first. He said,
[50:36] "That's the next job. Let's get it done.
[50:38] Next thing I'm going to do is get away
[50:40] from my doubts. Cut it down. That's my
[50:42] next job. Is get all my frustrations
[50:44] away."
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Frustrations keep us
[50:48] from serving God like we ought to. So we
[50:50] who are in heavenly places ought to
[50:52] fight against frustration.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Fight against that. If my senses tell
[50:57] me, "Well, you feel bad." The next thing
[50:58] to do is cut that thing away. What are
[51:01] we doing? We're fighting, church. I'm
[51:03] fighting tonight. I've got senses, too.
[51:05] I've got I got a body that's been sick,
[51:08] too. But I'm fighting that feeling. I
[51:10] feel bad. Say, "Lord, I can do it by the
[51:12] power." I believe we can all do that
[51:14] tonight. We can fight against that.
[51:15] Well, I'm tired. I feel bad. It's just a
[51:18] Wednesday night service. Let's fight
[51:19] through that thing.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; That's what's keeping you from what you
[51:22] need tonight.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Cut that thing away. You say, "Well,
[51:26] they tell me that, you know, my
[51:27] conscience tell me, Brother Brandham,
[51:29] that's what gets a lot of people." See,
[51:32] they they would worship God, but their
[51:33] conscience gets in the way. You know,
[51:36] we're taught by Disney to always follow
[51:37] our conscience,
[51:40] &gt;&gt; right? Walt Disney said, "Let your
[51:42] conscience be your guide." But did you
[51:44] know that's not entirely true? You
[51:47] &gt;&gt; should only follow your conscience if
[51:49] your conscience lines up with the word.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Right? So if that little cricket gets to
[51:55] Excuse me for using Walt Disney
[51:56] references. I know none of you have ever
[51:58] seen Pinocchio, but
[52:01] you know that little cricket gets to
[52:03] saying something that's not right with
[52:04] the word. What do you do?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Smash the little thing.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Get rid of him. He's just a bug.
[52:16] If you don't line up with the word, he's
[52:18] not right.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; See, a lot of times your conscience
[52:21] because you put something under the
[52:22] blood, but your conscience will tell you
[52:23] it's still there.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven be because the word
[52:28] says you're forgiven and you know you
[52:30] experience the grace of God and and and
[52:32] and you ask him for forgiveness. He
[52:34] forgave you. And yet you stand there and
[52:37] you say, "Well, here I' I've done this
[52:39] awful thing and your conscience get in
[52:40] the way." Well, that's what's standing
[52:42] between you and the promise. He said,
[52:43] "You might as well cut that thing away.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get no further than
[52:48] that."
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Just get your next job done.
[52:52] Take off your coat and bear right into
[52:54] it. Just keep on going. One objective.
[52:57] I'm going to win." How many can say that
[52:58] tonight? I'm going to win. Amen. I can't
[53:01] lose. I'm going to win. Hallelujah.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:06] So, we know there's a battle that takes
[53:08] place in heavenly realms, in heavenly
[53:10] places, and other dimensions that has an
[53:13] effect on us. And it's illustrated
[53:15] perfectly by Daniel chapter 10. We'll
[53:17] just read through that really quickly as
[53:19] we go tonight. Daniel chapter 10, this
[53:22] is where the angel comes, the vision
[53:24] comes to Daniel and he's troubled by it
[53:26] and he prays and the angel comes to him.
[53:28] Daniel 10:1, in the third year of Cyrus,
[53:30] king of Persia, the thing was revealed
[53:32] unto Daniel. The thing was true, but the
[53:34] time appointed was long. And he
[53:35] understood the thing and had
[53:38] understanding of the vision. In those
[53:40] days, I Daniel was mourning. Three full
[53:43] weeks.
[53:45] Now look,
[53:47] for 21 days, three weeks,
[53:50] Daniel is mourning like he had lost a
[53:52] loved one because he he doesn't know
[53:56] what God's going to do. He's not sure
[53:59] what the vision means and he's not sure
[54:02] what's going on and and and so there's a
[54:06] maybe he can't even fully explain why
[54:08] he's so upset, but it's because there's
[54:11] a battle going on in heavenly places.
[54:15] Now, he's not directly involved in this
[54:17] battle, but yet he is by by fact by the
[54:21] fact that he's waiting on an answer to
[54:23] prayer and it doesn't come immediately.
[54:26] And so he's waiting on the answer. And
[54:28] so he's praying and he didn't give up,
[54:31] but he was mourning three, four weeks.
[54:32] He said, "I ate no pleasant bread,
[54:34] neither confession nor wine in my mouth.
[54:36] Neither did I anoint myself at all till
[54:38] three whole weeks were fulfilled." Other
[54:41] words, he didn't even he didn't even
[54:42] take a bath. He didn't he he couldn't
[54:45] even get up. He was just stricken by
[54:47] grief and by worry and by stress and and
[54:51] he's his his anxiety, we would say
[54:53] today, is through the roof. and he don't
[54:55] understand what's going on like he's
[54:57] having a mental breakdown.
[54:59] And then the four and 20 20th day of the
[55:02] first month as I was by the side of the
[55:04] great river and I lifted up mine eyes
[55:06] and looked and behold a certain man
[55:08] clothed in linen whose loins were girded
[55:10] with fine gold of Ufaz. His body was
[55:13] also was like the barrel. His face is
[55:14] the appearance of lightning and his eyes
[55:16] as lamps of fire. His arms and his feet
[55:18] in color like in color and polished
[55:20] brass. the voice of his words like the
[55:22] voice of a multitude. And I, Daniel
[55:24] alone, saw the vision. But the men that
[55:27] were with me sown off the vision. If you
[55:29] go back and take the visions that Daniel
[55:31] saw and look at what brother Brandham's
[55:33] visions were like, they weren't
[55:34] different. They were very similar.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; The way Brother Brandham saw visions and
[55:39] the angels that he saw and things, if
[55:41] you compare that to modern charismatic
[55:43] circles, it's it's completely different.
[55:45] They're talking about things the Bible
[55:46] doesn't talk about. But brother Brandham
[55:48] talked about things in in a scriptural
[55:50] way because what he saw was the same
[55:52] things that Daniel was seeing, John was
[55:54] seeing in the book of Revelation. So he
[55:56] said, he said, "They fled to hide
[55:59] themselves. Therefore, was I left alone.
[56:00] Saw this great vision. There remained no
[56:02] strength in me for my clanliness was
[56:04] turning me to corruption. I retained no
[56:06] strength. Yet I heard out of the voice
[56:08] of his words. When I heard the voice of
[56:09] his words, I was in a deep sleep on my
[56:11] face and my face toward the ground. And
[56:14] behold, a hand touched me which set me
[56:16] upon my knees and upon the palms of my
[56:18] hand. He said unto me, "Oh, Daniel, man,
[56:20] greatly, beloved. Understand the words
[56:22] that I speak unto thee." Notice what the
[56:24] angel does. The angel understands the
[56:26] frame of mind that Daniel's in. In that
[56:29] frame of mind, in that upset condition,
[56:31] he can't even even accept the word of
[56:34] the Lord. He can't even hear the word of
[56:35] the Lord. And now his answers come. But
[56:38] first, the angel has to settle his
[56:40] spirit. Like the way we come to church a
[56:43] lot of times on Wednesday night or on
[56:44] Sunday morning. We're so upset by what's
[56:47] going on. We're so upset by what we've
[56:49] heard or what we've experienced or what
[56:50] our job was like that week or what what
[56:52] our kids or our grandkids or something
[56:54] else that it's hard for us to get. And
[56:56] so what does the angel first have to do?
[56:57] Settle our spirits.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Encourage us.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Oh man. Amen. Greatly beloved.
[57:05] Understand the words that I speak unto
[57:06] thee. Stand upright for unto thee am I
[57:08] now sent. When he had spoken this word
[57:11] unto me, I stood trembling. Then said he
[57:14] unto me, "Fear not, Daniel. For from the
[57:16] first day," oh, I love this. Daniel
[57:19] didn't know it. But from the first day
[57:21] that thou set thine heart to understand,
[57:23] and to chasen thyself before thy God,
[57:25] thy words were heard, and I am come for
[57:28] thy words.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[57:33] withtood me one in 20 days. See, we
[57:36] don't even comprehend the battle that is
[57:38] going on.
[57:40] between angels, fallen angels, right?
[57:43] And God's angels. The fallen angels
[57:46] retain their authority,
[57:49] right? Although they've left their first
[57:50] estate, but they're not weakened,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; right? They still have power, but it's
[57:56] only under under permission under Satan.
[58:00] But now they but they still are able to
[58:03] battle. They're able to war. And so he
[58:07] said the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[58:09] withtood me one and 20 days below
[58:10] Michael one of the chief princes came to
[58:12] help me. Hallelujah. I remained there
[58:14] with the kings of Persia. He said now I
[58:17] am come to make thee understand what
[58:19] shall befall thy people in the latter
[58:21] days. For yet the vision is for many
[58:23] days. So in other words, he's telling
[58:25] him if you got a long ways yet to wait.
[58:28] And when he spoken such words unto me, I
[58:30] set my face toward the ground, and I
[58:31] became dumb that he couldn't speak.
[58:35] Behold, one like the similitude of the
[58:36] sons of men touched my lips. Then I
[58:39] opened my mouth and spake and said to
[58:40] him that stood before me, "Oh my Lord,
[58:42] by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
[58:44] me. I have retained no strength. For how
[58:47] can the servant of this, my lord, talk
[58:48] with this, my lord? For as for me,
[58:50] straightway there remainth no strength
[58:52] in me, neither is there breath left in
[58:54] me." Then there came again and touched
[58:56] me one like the appearance of a man and
[58:58] he strengthened me and said, "Oh man,
[59:00] greatly beloved, fear not. Peace be unto
[59:04] thee." He said, "And be strong. Yay, be
[59:07] strong." And when he had spoken unto me,
[59:09] I was strengthened and said, "Let my
[59:11] Lord speak, for thou hast strengthened
[59:12] me." Do you see how this spiritual
[59:14] battle is going on, but he needed to be
[59:16] strengthened so he could hear the word
[59:18] of the Lord. I think, man, that's what's
[59:20] going on in our day and age that we live
[59:22] in many times in Leodysia. We just all
[59:24] our strengths been sapped out of us. We
[59:26] find ourselves like Daniel unable to
[59:28] comprehend and understand the word of
[59:30] God. And we need to be encouraged by the
[59:33] angels of God. That's why we need to
[59:35] spend time with God. We need to spend
[59:37] time in prayer. Not just spend time with
[59:39] our news and things of the world, but to
[59:41] spend time with him.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Daniel was praying, that's
[59:46] when the angel came. Uh, brother uh uh
[59:49] Joshua Josh uh uh Bennett was speaking
[59:52] on that in the in the meetings that we
[59:54] were at at True Word Tabernacle and it
[59:56] just touched my heart. It's when they
[59:57] were praying while they were praying. It
[59:59] was the title of his sermon. He brought
[1:00:01] how Daniel was praying. Each one of
[1:00:02] these men of God were praying and that's
[1:00:04] when the angel came. I want to be found
[1:00:06] praying. I believe the answer to prayer.
[1:00:08] I believe he's already heard my prayer
[1:00:10] but let me pray till the answer gets
[1:00:11] here.
[1:00:14] Now
[1:00:15] he said when he had spoken to me I was
[1:00:17] strengthened. He said let my lord speak
[1:00:18] for thou hast strengthened me and said
[1:00:20] he knowest not knowest thou. Wherefore I
[1:00:22] come unto thee. Now I will return to
[1:00:23] fight with the prince of Persia. When
[1:00:25] I'm gone forth lo the prince of Grecia
[1:00:27] shall come. But I will show thee that
[1:00:30] which is noted in the scripture of
[1:00:31] truth. There is none that holdeth with
[1:00:34] me in these things but Michael your
[1:00:35] prince. We know Michael is Jesus. So we
[1:00:38] believe that's enough.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That's enough.
[1:00:43] Brother Brandon always takes this Daniel
[1:00:46] praying for 21 days. And thank you for
[1:00:48] bearing with me as we read the whole
[1:00:50] chapter.
[1:00:52] But he he takes this to the two women
[1:00:54] you remember who got healed in his
[1:00:57] meeting. He said and and he said he
[1:00:59] there were words of blessing spoken over
[1:01:01] each one of them in the same meeting and
[1:01:04] they happened to live in the same
[1:01:06] neighborhood,
[1:01:08] right? And there was six weeks between
[1:01:11] the time of the meeting, he said, when
[1:01:13] the words were spoken and the time of
[1:01:16] their healing.
[1:01:18] And he always liked that. He said,
[1:01:20] "Remember Daniel prayed and it was 21
[1:01:21] days before the angel could get to him."
[1:01:23] He said, "How many knows that when the
[1:01:25] angel of the Lord pronounced that
[1:01:26] blessing, he's talking about the women."
[1:01:28] He said, "What if she would have give
[1:01:29] up? Satan would have come right in, but
[1:01:32] she held right on." Remember the two
[1:01:34] women, one of them had a bad stomach and
[1:01:36] couldn't eat. And brother Brandham saw
[1:01:38] her going away eating.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Right. And so he says, "You're healed."
[1:01:44] And she goes away. The first day,
[1:01:46] nothing. She's still sick every day. The
[1:01:48] second day, the third day, six weeks,
[1:01:51] she does that.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Until her husband tells her, "You need
[1:01:54] to quit testifying of your healing. It's
[1:01:56] embarrassing because you still can't eat
[1:01:58] nothing."
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Right? And she said that she had gotten
[1:02:02] made the kids breakfast one day and she
[1:02:04] saw a piece of toast there and she
[1:02:05] thought, "Well, I'm going to get sick,
[1:02:06] but I'll try to eat it anyway." And she
[1:02:08] went to eat it. When she did, she didn't
[1:02:10] get sick. And pretty soon, she made
[1:02:11] herself some bacon and eggs and she
[1:02:13] didn't get sick and she got so excited
[1:02:15] and she said she run down the street and
[1:02:17] there was the other woman had been
[1:02:18] prayed for had an external uh not a
[1:02:21] cancer but had an external like a growth
[1:02:24] on her and and she had been told she was
[1:02:26] healed and she was waiting. He said she
[1:02:28] run down there. She heard her hollering
[1:02:29] and she was shaking the sheets.
[1:02:31] Remember, because she was looking for
[1:02:33] that growth cuz it had fallen off. He
[1:02:35] said, "What had happened is the angel of
[1:02:36] the Lord came through the neighborhood."
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't even explain that.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how that works, but I
[1:02:46] know there's a spiritual battle going on
[1:02:48] in heavenly places. Lord, help me to be
[1:02:50] patient. Help me to wait. Help me to be
[1:02:53] ready at the moment. Help me to keep my
[1:02:55] testimony. Even when it seems like I
[1:02:57] don't understand what's going on, let me
[1:02:59] be strengthened by the words of the
[1:03:01] angel. I believe we have words spoken by
[1:03:03] the by the seventh angel on this day. We
[1:03:05] can be strengthened by those words.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] He said she held right on and he passed
[1:03:12] through the neighborhood that morning.
[1:03:14] He knows where you live
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; all about you.
[1:03:19] If there's anything we should have
[1:03:20] learned from brother Brandham being able
[1:03:23] to stand up there and he would tell
[1:03:24] brother Paul he would tell them their
[1:03:25] names and their addresses.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Why did he do that?
[1:03:31] They had to know he knew where they
[1:03:32] lived.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz the healing always wouldn't be
[1:03:37] immediately. Sometimes the angel had to
[1:03:40] visit their house.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:45] Look,
[1:03:47] brother Brandham says if he if he knows
[1:03:49] you here, he knows where you're at. So
[1:03:52] in other words, if he knew who they were
[1:03:54] in the prayer line, he knows where
[1:03:56] they're at. When he gives you the
[1:03:58] blessing, he will confirm it if you'll
[1:04:01] just stay with it.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So our part of that battle. So it's not
[1:04:06] like we're out here fighting. You know,
[1:04:10] um I know the charismatics today, they
[1:04:12] they have um uh battle flags and they
[1:04:16] they wave flags back and forth and
[1:04:18] they're fighting demons and and some of
[1:04:21] them get actual swords and pass them out
[1:04:23] and and I guess I don't want to mock
[1:04:26] that because may maybe that helps their
[1:04:28] faith. I don't know. But a little
[1:04:29] plastic sword from Kmart or Walmart or
[1:04:32] wherever doesn't help my faith at all
[1:04:34] because I understand that spiritual
[1:04:36] battles can't be fought that way.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Right? That's not how we fight battles.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; We don't fight them like that. We fight
[1:04:43] them on our knees.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Our job is to stay encouraged, to
[1:04:49] stay with it, to to hold on, to to to to
[1:04:53] surrender to his will and say, "Lord, I
[1:04:56] know there's a battle going on, but
[1:04:57] Lord, I'm going to be right here on my
[1:04:59] knees, ready and waiting when the
[1:05:01] promise comes."
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; See, the battle is in between the
[1:05:06] promise and the fulfillment. And that's
[1:05:08] where we are in heavenly places
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; in Christ because we're on our way to
[1:05:15] the fullness of our adoption, to the
[1:05:16] change of the body. So in the land of
[1:05:18] adoption, we're gaining the maturity to
[1:05:21] believe for the fullness of our
[1:05:22] adoption. Are are you with me now? So
[1:05:25] anyone can believe in an instant
[1:05:26] miracle, but Abraham's seed believed the
[1:05:29] promise,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; right? Even if it takes 25 years.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; We're in a journey. We're in a journey
[1:05:35] to our destination. Our destination is
[1:05:37] the millennium. That's where we're
[1:05:39] headed. It's the marriage supper before
[1:05:41] that. That's where we're headed. It's
[1:05:42] the rapture. But what Paul is trying to
[1:05:44] make us understand in Ephesians is that
[1:05:47] we're already there
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; in the mind of God. And and not only has
[1:05:53] our birth been predestinated, but our
[1:05:56] adoption, our placing, our future home
[1:05:59] has been predestined. Amen. We've been
[1:06:01] predestined to the adoption of sons.
[1:06:03] We'll get into that. We've been
[1:06:04] predestined to heavenly places. We've
[1:06:06] been predestined to win the battle. I
[1:06:08] wonder if we can understand that tonight
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; if we can by faith order our thoughts.
[1:06:15] Now listen, why write the book of
[1:06:17] Ephesians? Because if you think about
[1:06:20] it, well, if you're predestined, you
[1:06:22] know, what's the point of writing it
[1:06:24] because it's going to happen anyway. And
[1:06:26] if you take that view and you go off on
[1:06:28] extreme Calvinism, then there's no real
[1:06:30] point doing anything,
[1:06:32] right?
[1:06:34] But God predestines us to a place for a
[1:06:38] purpose. Hallelujah. So what happens is
[1:06:42] we've been placed in in a in in a in a
[1:06:45] battle and God says you're going to win,
[1:06:49] but you got to fight,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; right? For every inch of the ground. So
[1:06:53] what how do we fight? We by faith we
[1:06:56] order our thoughts
[1:06:59] to align to line up with what has
[1:07:02] already happened in our souls.
[1:07:06] And when our when our mind when we are
[1:07:09] renewed in our minds by what has already
[1:07:12] happened in our souls, we begin to win.
[1:07:15] We begin to be victorious in every
[1:07:18] battle against the devil and the flesh.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Right? bec but we've got to that's where
[1:07:23] the battleground is and you have control
[1:07:25] over that even as predestined sons and
[1:07:28] daughters of God. You have control over
[1:07:29] that mind, right? The battleground. So,
[1:07:34] uh we we will be victorious in every
[1:07:36] battle if we line our thoughts up with
[1:07:38] the word of God. 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:07:40] 10 and verse three, it says, "Though we
[1:07:42] walk in the flesh, we do not war after
[1:07:44] the flesh. For the weapons of our
[1:07:45] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:07:47] through God to the pulling down of
[1:07:50] strongholds." I love that. Casting down
[1:07:52] imaginations. Listen, Paul's not dealing
[1:07:55] with some kind of a foam sword. He's not
[1:07:58] dealing with some kind of flag. He said
[1:08:00] it's imaginations you're waring against.
[1:08:02] It's a high thing, a heavenly thing that
[1:08:04] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[1:08:07] God
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; and bringing into captivity. We preached
[1:08:11] on that before, how that you have
[1:08:13] control over your borders,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; right? you that that the the the mind.
[1:08:17] We should not give the province of the
[1:08:19] mind over to the to Satan. We we have a
[1:08:22] right to guard our minds
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and to protect it, not to just leave it
[1:08:26] open, but to protect it from the enemy
[1:08:29] and say, "I'm not going to let you in.
[1:08:30] I'm going to cast down imagination. If
[1:08:33] if he tries to sneak in in some way and
[1:08:35] tell me a certain thing about myself
[1:08:37] that's not in the word or a certain
[1:08:39] thing about somebody else that's not in
[1:08:41] the word, I'm going to cast that thing
[1:08:42] out.
[1:08:44] I'm going to bring into captivity every
[1:08:46] thought to the obedience of Christ.
[1:08:52] See, when we enter into the land, Satan
[1:08:54] will do everything he can to give us
[1:08:56] thoughts
[1:08:57] like the giants are too many, right?
[1:09:01] That's what he did to them. He won the
[1:09:04] battle the first time they went in.
[1:09:06] Remember when the 10 spies went into 12
[1:09:08] spies went into the land, 10 of them
[1:09:10] come back with a bad report? How did he
[1:09:13] win the battle in the mind?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to fire a shot physically
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; for them to lose. They said, "We're
[1:09:20] grasshoppers in front of him."
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It felt like, "Brother David, you you
[1:09:25] missed out on brother Nathan Sunday. We
[1:09:27] were going to have you all stand
[1:09:28] together and take a picture." But but
[1:09:30] that's what it must have been like,
[1:09:31] right? Like looking up like this,
[1:09:35] right? And and it must have been like
[1:09:37] that when they went into the land like,
[1:09:39] "Well, there's just no way." and they
[1:09:41] were right
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; humanly speaking. Joshua and Caleb said,
[1:09:45] "We have a promise." So, he's going to
[1:09:47] give us thoughts. He's He's gonna say,
[1:09:49] he's gonna tell you, "I'm not forgiven."
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Right? That that's a thought of the
[1:09:55] enemy. I'm not forgiven.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; We'll say, "Well, is it sometimes a
[1:09:59] thought from God?"
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; What do you think?
[1:10:02] Would God ever tell you you're not
[1:10:04] forgiven?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He would reach out in mercy and
[1:10:07] forgiveness.
[1:10:09] He wouldn't tell you you're not
[1:10:10] forgiven.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; See, that's something you're forgiven
[1:10:14] because we're looking at I know young
[1:10:16] people a lot of times will tell me, "So,
[1:10:17] I just hope God could forgive me.
[1:10:18] Forgive you 2,000 years ago."
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Your sins were judged in his body on the
[1:10:24] cross. How could you be more forgiven
[1:10:26] than that?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; You just have to accept that,
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; right? So a thought could be I, you
[1:10:32] know, maybe I could never be a Christian
[1:10:34] like this other
[1:10:36] person. I I could never be a deacon like
[1:10:41] this other deacon. I could never be a
[1:10:42] preacher like this other preacher. I
[1:10:44] could never be a young person like this
[1:10:46] other young person. You don't know what
[1:10:48] that other young person has fought.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; But the devil bring those thoughts,
[1:10:55] right? I I'll never be healed.
[1:10:59] Huh? We're we're closing in just a few
[1:11:01] minutes, but I I know you all have
[1:11:04] fought this battle, too.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I'll never have peace.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I'll try to tell you young people, I
[1:11:12] I'll never be able to have a home. Never
[1:11:15] be able to have a wife or a husband. I I
[1:11:18] I'll never be able to do things right. I
[1:11:20] make so many mistakes.
[1:11:22] I I'll always act this way.
[1:11:27] I I made this mistake before and here I
[1:11:29] made it again. I'll always do it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; I just make too many mistakes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; I could never be. See, but but we limit
[1:11:38] I think brother Nathan talked about that
[1:11:40] maybe Sunday or Saturday night. We we
[1:11:42] tend to limit God by what we we we limit
[1:11:45] ourselves and what God can do with us.
[1:11:48] But these thoughts will always come to
[1:11:50] us. That's the thing. They will never
[1:11:51] quit. Yeah,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Satan's got a punch at us.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; He does. Brother Brandon talked about a
[1:11:57] young minister and his wife. He said, I
[1:11:59] was talking to a young minister and his
[1:12:00] wife in the room. He said, both of them
[1:12:01] are nervous just like the rest of the
[1:12:04] world, rest of the human beings on
[1:12:06] earth. And I said, remember, Satan's got
[1:12:08] a punch coming at you. Don't care who
[1:12:10] you are. He's got a right for that one
[1:12:13] punch. He said, which would you rather
[1:12:15] be, that punch? Be blind or be arthritic
[1:12:18] sitting in a chair or be nervous? See, I
[1:12:20] know a lot of people would love to be
[1:12:21] wealthy, but if you were wealthy, there
[1:12:24] would be something
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; that you have to deal with.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I I knew a man, it comes to my mind
[1:12:30] because his son just got married, but I
[1:12:32] knew a man that that uh had retired
[1:12:35] wealthy and his dad had worked and his
[1:12:37] granddad in a farm and they by by their
[1:12:39] own labor they built up a huge farm and
[1:12:41] retired with a lot of money and he was
[1:12:43] going to go live it up. He was about 50
[1:12:45] years old, able to retire at that age
[1:12:47] and moved to Tennessee and was going to
[1:12:50] going to just live the and and he had
[1:12:52] earned it. He deserved it. He'd worked
[1:12:53] hard all of his life and immediately got
[1:12:56] cancer
[1:12:58] and died. See, there's something there's
[1:13:00] something that is going to affect your
[1:13:02] life,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; whether you got money, whether you got
[1:13:05] health, whether you whatever it is. So,
[1:13:07] brother Brandon said there's a punch
[1:13:08] coming at you. He's got somewhere he can
[1:13:10] punch you. He's got a right to that open
[1:13:13] place.
[1:13:14] Now, that's the spot you got to keep
[1:13:17] covered all the time,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; right? So, there's something you're
[1:13:22] prone to. Whether it's sickness, whether
[1:13:24] it's disease, whether it's whether it's
[1:13:26] evil thoughts, whether it's carnal
[1:13:29] thinking, maybe maybe gossip, maybe
[1:13:32] maybe struggling in in in how you deal
[1:13:34] with people or or how you treat people
[1:13:36] or things like there's something. I know
[1:13:38] what my weaknesses are
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; and so do you know what yours are.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Right? But it's not that we have to give
[1:13:47] into that. He doesn't tell us we have to
[1:13:49] give into it.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He said keep it covered.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Keep it covered. Watch yourself in that
[1:13:54] area. Put an extra an extra uh brigade
[1:13:59] of soldiers in that area
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; to keep that spot in the wall.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; See, Satan is a student of psychology.
[1:14:08] He started that with Eve. He knew where
[1:14:09] Eve's weaknesses were. He knows your
[1:14:12] weaknesses like a boxer. Knows where to
[1:14:16] where to punch, right? He he studies
[1:14:18] like a boxer. Brother Brandon said we
[1:14:20] should do that. Study our enemy,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; right? But he the Satan studies like a
[1:14:25] boxer or a pitcher who knows where to
[1:14:27] throw the ball, right? Like a Greg
[1:14:30] Maddox. And some of y'all know what I'm
[1:14:31] talking about. See, Greg Maddox couldn't
[1:14:34] throw very hard, but he knew exactly
[1:14:35] where to throw the ball,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; right? And if you get it in the right
[1:14:39] spot, even the best hitter can't hit it
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; because every hitter has a weakness,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; right? And so he studied those
[1:14:47] weaknesses here recently, last year,
[1:14:50] excuse me for a minute, but they they
[1:14:52] banned the shift in baseball. And what
[1:14:55] the shift was is for you non- baseball
[1:14:58] people is the the shift was they would
[1:15:00] put all the infielders on one side of
[1:15:02] the infield because they knew this
[1:15:04] batter cannot hit to the left or to the
[1:15:08] right. They knew that he had a weakness.
[1:15:12] So what they did is they loaded up one
[1:15:13] side and left the other side open and no
[1:15:15] matter how hard he tried, he had a
[1:15:16] weakness.
[1:15:18] He couldn't do it. So what they do? They
[1:15:20] studied his weakness.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Right? I think we ought to, if the
[1:15:24] devil's going to study our weakness, we
[1:15:25] ought to study the devil's weakness.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; What is his weakness? The blood of Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ. He's already been overcome by
[1:15:31] the word of your testimony. By the blood
[1:15:33] of the lamb and the word of your
[1:15:34] testimony. That's his weakness.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But see, he he studies your weakness.
[1:15:40] That's the spot. He knows exactly where
[1:15:42] to throw that pitch to get you to hit
[1:15:44] into the shift.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Hit it right to the person. And
[1:15:50] you think, well, I just do it every
[1:15:51] time. Well, that's where you got to
[1:15:54] train yourself. I knew a guy who he was
[1:15:57] a great big home run hitter. But what he
[1:15:59] learned to do was bunt. And he bunt it
[1:16:02] against the shift. And after a while,
[1:16:03] they quit doing that to him because he
[1:16:06] learned that it all he didn't have to
[1:16:08] hit a home run. All he had to do was
[1:16:09] bunt his way on because they left his
[1:16:11] way open the other direction. So, you're
[1:16:14] always going to have your strong places
[1:16:15] and your weak places. You're in a
[1:16:17] battle. Everyone's fighting a battle.
[1:16:20] Don't let condemnation ruin your
[1:16:22] effectiveness because that's what
[1:16:24] happens to a lot of a lot of times to to
[1:16:26] batter to hitters who they get a
[1:16:28] weakness and once pitchers start start
[1:16:30] exploiting that instead of covering that
[1:16:32] up and you seeking an area of strength
[1:16:34] they get so worried about it and so
[1:16:36] concerned about it that they end up not
[1:16:38] being able to do anything and they end
[1:16:39] up getting put out of the major leagues
[1:16:41] because they can't hit it all. But
[1:16:43] you're fighting a battle. Don't Don't
[1:16:45] let condemnation ruin your effectiveness
[1:16:47] because you're in a battle.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone fights a battle. The Bible said
[1:16:51] there's no temptation taking you but
[1:16:53] such as is common to man.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; But God is faithful. How many are glad
[1:16:57] he's faithful tonight? Who will not
[1:17:00] suffer you to be tempted above what
[1:17:01] you're able, but will with the
[1:17:03] temptation also. Someone say also.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Also, hallelujah. Also make a way to
[1:17:10] escape that you may be able to bear it.
[1:17:13] I've told you many times, but that way
[1:17:15] of escaped, if you look in the original
[1:17:17] Greek, is in other words, there will be
[1:17:18] a place that you can swim to.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; There will be land. You won't be
[1:17:23] shipwrecked without land in sight that
[1:17:25] you can swim to. If you're willing to
[1:17:28] swim, you're going to make it. It's
[1:17:30] close enough that you can make it.
[1:17:32] You've got the strength to do it. You
[1:17:34] just got to be willing to swim.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; You won't drown. There's land in sight.
[1:17:39] Swim with all your might.
[1:17:41] But the battlefield of the mind is
[1:17:43] populated
[1:17:45] with thoughts.
[1:17:47] And thoughts are created by what comes
[1:17:48] into the five senses primarily by
[1:17:51] hearing and seeing, but even sometimes
[1:17:53] by smelling or or or something like
[1:17:56] that, touch,
[1:17:58] but especially by hearing and seeing.
[1:18:01] And these senses then feed the five
[1:18:03] senses of the spirit. So you see
[1:18:06] something or you hear something, it
[1:18:07] feeds your memory and your imagination,
[1:18:10] right?
[1:18:11] And so what you see or hear might make
[1:18:14] you imagine a thing. There's a
[1:18:17] illustration. I'm real close to done. So
[1:18:19] just hang with me for a minute. Are
[1:18:21] y'all with me so far?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; There was a illust I illustration that I
[1:18:25] like that that talked about a preacher's
[1:18:26] car because I've actually done this that
[1:18:28] a preacher didn't have anywhere else to
[1:18:30] park. So he parked in front of a liquor
[1:18:31] store. And of course the church gossip
[1:18:34] figured it out and she's telling all
[1:18:37] about it. And so that night, the
[1:18:39] preacher parked in front of her house,
[1:18:40] left his car,
[1:18:45] but
[1:18:46] but I I had to I did that one time. I
[1:18:48] was uh I was trying to get some Cajun
[1:18:51] food and the Cajun food was in the in uh
[1:18:53] the liquor store parking lot and I
[1:18:55] didn't think about it. I just parked in
[1:18:56] the parking lot, went over and got the
[1:18:58] Cajun food. As I'm standing there
[1:18:59] waiting on my food, I thought, "Oh no,
[1:19:04] everybody knows my truck by now.
[1:19:05] everybody, you know, oh no, I'm in
[1:19:09] trouble. Nobody ever said anything. But
[1:19:11] what if you seen that
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; right now? You might dismiss that.
[1:19:17] But what if you previously had a pastor
[1:19:19] who was a drunk,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; right? Or what if you'd struggled with
[1:19:24] that? See, there might that's a then
[1:19:26] memory start to come.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Imagination feeds on memory,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes that memory is so
[1:19:33] deep you don't even know it's there.
[1:19:35] until something triggers it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So, you would never remember it until
[1:19:40] something like that happens. You see
[1:19:42] something or you hear something, it
[1:19:44] triggers a memory and you think, "Oh,
[1:19:46] he's just like that." Right now, just
[1:19:50] we're just human beings here tonight,
[1:19:52] right? But now, the modern method of
[1:19:55] dealing with that, if you go to a
[1:19:56] college today, they try to avoid the
[1:19:57] triggers,
[1:19:59] right? So, you just avoid, it's kind of
[1:20:01] like allergies, you I know our young
[1:20:03] people get allergies today and I have
[1:20:04] allergies to things and but you know
[1:20:06] that what they found out recently there
[1:20:09] are no allergies in the Amish community
[1:20:12] and the reason is because they're
[1:20:14] exposed to dirt.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's what they found out. And I don't
[1:20:17] I don't we're not going to go back and
[1:20:19] live like the Amish, but they found
[1:20:21] there's no allergies in the Amish
[1:20:22] community.
[1:20:24] Almost almost immune from it. And but
[1:20:27] it's just the they're so exposed to
[1:20:29] dirt. Now they may get some other things
[1:20:31] but but they don't get allergies but but
[1:20:34] the modern method is just avoid the
[1:20:36] triggers but the gospel method is not to
[1:20:38] do that but to cast down the stronghold
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; right take the if we find we have a weak
[1:20:44] place and that memory starts to come up
[1:20:46] fight that thing
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; right stand against that thing
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; you can't help but think things
[1:20:52] especially if you've been through some
[1:20:53] things
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; but we don't have to act on those
[1:20:56] thoughts
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; but the answer for anxious thoughts or
[1:21:00] thoughts contrary to the word. It's not
[1:21:02] to quit thinking,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:06] That tickled Peter for some reason, but
[1:21:09] we don't quit thinking. We think
[1:21:10] different thoughts,
[1:21:13] right? Fill the battlefield with
[1:21:15] soldiers. You remember the the the war
[1:21:17] in Iraq? You remember what happened in
[1:21:20] in Iraq? They had it was falling apart
[1:21:22] and they they were losing
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and General Petraeus went over there and
[1:21:25] he they called it the surge. What did
[1:21:28] they do? Just put bodies in there. They
[1:21:31] just didn't have enough soldiers to fill
[1:21:33] the place up to make it and they quelled
[1:21:36] the violence. And Iraq is a is a better
[1:21:38] country today. And we don't hear that
[1:21:40] much about it because there's not that
[1:21:41] much going on in Iraq now because of
[1:21:43] that surge that they did. What do you
[1:21:45] got to do? Surge thoughts, good thoughts
[1:21:49] into the battlefield. How do you do
[1:21:51] that? By hearing the word. Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] By reading the word. by taking in the
[1:21:56] word into those senses.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And what do you do? You surge. What what
[1:22:01] kind of thoughts do you surge? He said,
[1:22:03] "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
[1:22:05] are true, whatever things are honest,
[1:22:07] whatever things are just, whatever
[1:22:08] things are pure, whatever things are
[1:22:10] lovely, whatever things are of good
[1:22:11] report, if there be any virtue, if there
[1:22:13] be any praise, think on these things.
[1:22:15] What are you doing?" Filling the
[1:22:16] battlefield of the mind that that the
[1:22:18] battle of heavenly places, you're
[1:22:20] winning it by surging the right kind of
[1:22:22] soldiers into it.
[1:22:26] Look at the next verse. Verse nine.
[1:22:29] He said, "These things which those
[1:22:30] things which you have both learned and
[1:22:31] received and heard and seen in me do." I
[1:22:36] love that he didn't just tell you to do
[1:22:39] it. He said, "I want you to do what I've
[1:22:40] done."
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you right then, Paul
[1:22:43] had to fight that battle.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; He knew how to tell us how to fight the
[1:22:47] battle of the mind because he had to
[1:22:48] fight the battle of the mind.
[1:22:51] He was in prison when he wrote that
[1:22:53] about to have his head chopped off.
[1:22:56] He was nearly blind, only had one coat.
[1:23:00] We know that because he asked for it cuz
[1:23:01] he was cold.
[1:23:05] In a letter to Timothy, he says, "All
[1:23:07] men have forsaken me."
[1:23:10] What a tragic thought. Brother said they
[1:23:12] thought he was washed up. The Christian
[1:23:15] churches wouldn't even receive his
[1:23:16] letters. Many of them all men had
[1:23:20] forsaken him. His head was about to be
[1:23:22] chopped off, nearly blind, only had one
[1:23:24] coat. And he sat there and wrote the
[1:23:27] book of Ephesians
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; and said, "We are we have all spiritual
[1:23:33] blessings
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ."
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been blessed and
[1:23:38] all. What was he doing? He was fighting
[1:23:40] that battle.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "When you think on these
[1:23:42] things," he said, "What you've seen me
[1:23:44] do," said do that. Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Satan fought him like no other because
[1:23:49] he was that first church age messenger.
[1:23:52] Satan fought him like he did our
[1:23:53] messenger in the se the seventh
[1:23:55] messenger. Those two prophets who
[1:23:56] bookended the church ages. Satan fought
[1:23:59] Paul. We know he had a thorn in the
[1:24:01] flesh. But this was his testimony. 2
[1:24:03] Timothy 4:7. I have fought a good fight.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. He could have went
[1:24:09] back and said, "Well, I failed here and
[1:24:10] I failed there and I messed up here and
[1:24:12] I messed up there and I and I didn't do
[1:24:14] right here because there he was a human
[1:24:16] being. There was many things he could
[1:24:18] have looked at, but he come back and he
[1:24:19] said he won the battlefield to the
[1:24:21] mind." He said, "I have fought a good
[1:24:23] fight. I have finished my course. I have
[1:24:26] kept the faith.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Henceforth, there is laid up for me a
[1:24:30] crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
[1:24:32] the righteous judge, shall give me at
[1:24:33] that day, not to me only, but unto all
[1:24:36] them also that love his appearing." What
[1:24:37] was he doing? Calling the symptoms
[1:24:39] around him lying vanities. And he said,
[1:24:41] "I may be in a smelly prison. Rats might
[1:24:44] be running across my feet, but I fought
[1:24:47] a good fight.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Ready to go home."
[1:24:53] Musicians go ahead and come. Reading
[1:24:55] Paul's prison epistles.
[1:24:57] It's like interviewing someone who
[1:24:59] fought on D-Day
[1:25:02] or Normandy
[1:25:05] or Ewima.
[1:25:10] Some of y'all old enough to have known
[1:25:11] people who fought in the Second World
[1:25:12] War or even in Vietnam, some of the
[1:25:15] great battles there.
[1:25:18] If you ever have you ever seen one, you
[1:25:21] go down the street and I hate it that
[1:25:24] they're passing on. They're getting
[1:25:25] older. Go down the street and you'll see
[1:25:27] a bumper sticker says EEOima survivor,
[1:25:31] hero of Eoima.
[1:25:34] And I
[1:25:36] I can't chills run up my back when I
[1:25:38] hear because I know what that battle
[1:25:39] I've heard what that battle was like.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I've never been there. I'd like to go.
[1:25:48] I've been to the battlefield at Shiloh
[1:25:52] here in Tennessee. And just awful the
[1:25:55] killing fields. I stood there by the
[1:25:56] pond, the bloody pond. It was filled
[1:25:59] with blood
[1:26:01] and looked at it and by the church where
[1:26:03] they so many men died.
[1:26:06] I stood there and thought, "Oh, to talk
[1:26:08] to a man who had been there
[1:26:10] and been through that. What a I've been
[1:26:12] watching on on the internet, you can
[1:26:15] watch videos of survivors that they've
[1:26:18] done and they'll tell their story and
[1:26:20] you get to listen to them and it's like,
[1:26:22] how did you do that?"
[1:26:24] But they just did what had to be done.
[1:26:28] Right? It was either that or die,
[1:26:30] right? They just did what they were just
[1:26:32] men, but they did what had to be done,
[1:26:35] right? And they they run right in the
[1:26:37] face of gunfire and everything else and
[1:26:39] and and and and changed the b the course
[1:26:42] of the battle and the course of history.
[1:26:45] But I want you to know there's been a
[1:26:46] spiritual war going on. There are
[1:26:49] battlefields in that war. And you and I
[1:26:53] fought in the battlefield of
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Leodosa,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; right? in in this great war that's going
[1:26:59] on when it's saying when 200 million
[1:27:01] demons have been released from the river
[1:27:03] Euphrates
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; in our day where brother said released
[1:27:07] on who? Released on the bride. We fought
[1:27:10] that battle.
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] Paul fought his battles but we fought
[1:27:16] the battle of Leodysia.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Think about it church. We ought to have
[1:27:21] grace for one another. When you see
[1:27:24] those old men who fought those battles,
[1:27:26] some of them you can see a spot in their
[1:27:27] head where they got shot. I remember a
[1:27:30] man coming in a flea market I was in
[1:27:31] years ago and he'd come in there and
[1:27:33] half of his face was cut out, his skull,
[1:27:36] and he just had a sunken place right
[1:27:38] there. And he told me he was a foreign
[1:27:39] observer in Korea and he'd been that had
[1:27:42] been shot away. And he said the average
[1:27:45] lifespan was like five minutes or some
[1:27:47] ridiculous thing and he had lasted for
[1:27:49] years, but he had been wounded many
[1:27:51] times. He would show me his scars and
[1:27:53] things and I was stood there in such awe
[1:27:56] because of the battlefield he was on.
[1:27:57] Listen, he wasn't nothing great. He was
[1:27:59] just an insignificant man who was
[1:28:02] drafted in the military. But he happened
[1:28:04] he was his exploits were great because
[1:28:06] of the battlefield he was on. Listen to
[1:28:08] me. I want to say this to encourage you
[1:28:09] today. There will be exploits uh people
[1:28:12] who were in a battle of Leodysa.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Now I want to go a little bit further
[1:28:17] than that tonight. We've been in a
[1:28:19] battle.
[1:28:21] We fought the battle of Hardy, Arkansas.
[1:28:27] Come on, church. Some of y'all know what
[1:28:29] I'm talking about. Brother Hardy, you
[1:28:31] fought that battle. I've been fighting
[1:28:33] in this battle. That's not nothing
[1:28:34] against our area, but this is a place
[1:28:36] where the message, for whatever reason,
[1:28:38] there's a lot of message people. And and
[1:28:40] God chose this area of the earth to be a
[1:28:43] battlefield.
[1:28:44] We fought the battle when there wasn't
[1:28:47] no money. and huh it's hard to get make
[1:28:51] a living yet you brought your kids to
[1:28:53] church
[1:28:56] when everything it seemed like there was
[1:28:57] no point in it but you did it anyway I'm
[1:29:00] taking a little bit of extra time but I
[1:29:02] want to encourage you tonight you
[1:29:03] there's been a battlefield right here
[1:29:06] you say how can you say that brother Ben
[1:29:08] is what brother Brandham says he says I
[1:29:10] pray on that day when the crowns are
[1:29:12] given out to the saints
[1:29:16] he said that I will be standing back.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "When I see the
[1:29:22] Jonesboro group,
[1:29:28] I I just want this to encourage you.
[1:29:29] When I see the Jonesboro group come up
[1:29:32] there," he said, "I will be awful
[1:29:34] noisy."
[1:29:37] Because brother Brandham had been in
[1:29:39] this area and knew what some of our
[1:29:41] grandfathers and great-grandfathers and
[1:29:42] people fought in this area, the battle
[1:29:45] that they had fought to even make it,
[1:29:48] but they believed. They were simple
[1:29:50] people, but they believed. Brother
[1:29:52] Nathan and I were talking about that.
[1:29:53] And then when I found this this quote, I
[1:29:55] thought, "Oh, God, Lord, let me be a
[1:29:57] good soldier on the battlefield
[1:30:00] on the Jonesboro battlefield, on the
[1:30:02] Hardy battlefield, on the battlefield of
[1:30:04] our area." Cuz brother Brandon said,
[1:30:06] "When I see that group," he said, "I'm
[1:30:07] going to be awful noisy. I can see
[1:30:09] Brother Brandon when when when maybe if
[1:30:11] we're I don't know if that's the way
[1:30:12] it'll be, but if we go up by geographic
[1:30:14] area and we come up before the place
[1:30:16] where the thrones where the where the
[1:30:18] crowns are going to be given out and we
[1:30:20] walk up there and I can just see brother
[1:30:22] Brandham when he sees the Jonesboro
[1:30:24] group, he said, "I'm going to be awful
[1:30:25] noisy." He sees some of those he
[1:30:27] ministered to. Brother Logan was in Jo
[1:30:30] Jonesboro near there in Truman a little
[1:30:32] while ago and I'll share the whole
[1:30:33] testimony with you later or have brother
[1:30:35] Logan do it. But he met a man who was
[1:30:38] prayed for whose aunt was prayed for by
[1:30:40] brother Brandham and during those
[1:30:43] meetings he volunteered that information
[1:30:44] to him and he become a preacher. I
[1:30:48] wonder I don't know why brother Logan
[1:30:49] met him. Maybe maybe it was to encourage
[1:30:51] brother Logan, but maybe that man is
[1:30:53] part of that Jonesboro group. Maybe even
[1:30:56] sealed into another age, but part of
[1:30:58] that Jonesboro group. Brother Brandon
[1:30:59] said, "When I see that Jonesboro group
[1:31:01] come up, I will be awful noisy."
[1:31:06] I can just see Brother Brandon back
[1:31:07] there going, "Hey, hallelujah. Thank the
[1:31:10] Lord." We know he was prone to to be
[1:31:12] noisy when he got excited. He talked
[1:31:15] about running around the tree and we
[1:31:17] know he jumped up on the on the pulpit
[1:31:18] at times and he said, "I'll be awful
[1:31:20] noisy, I'm afraid, when I see him
[1:31:23] place." He said, "I think of what it'll
[1:31:25] be when the Last Supper is set there in
[1:31:27] glory and we've all overcome set across
[1:31:30] the table from one another. I will look
[1:31:33] across the table and see old battlecar
[1:31:36] saints sitting there, tears of joy
[1:31:38] running down their cheeks. What is it?
[1:31:40] We've been in a battlefield, church, but
[1:31:42] we're overcoming. We've been in a
[1:31:44] battlefield, but we're on the winning
[1:31:45] side. Don't give up now. Let Let the Let
[1:31:48] there come a an assurance in your heart.
[1:31:51] I'm going to think on these things. I'm
[1:31:52] going to do what's right. I'm going to
[1:31:54] keep coming to the house of God. I'm
[1:31:55] going to keep working for the for the
[1:31:57] Lord. I'm going to keep spreading the
[1:31:59] message. I believe I'm part of that
[1:32:01] group. It's going to come up. Prophet
[1:32:05] will be so excited to see. I believe
[1:32:07] most of all I'd like to hear our Lord
[1:32:10] say, "Well done." A good and faithful
[1:32:13] servant. Brother Brandham talked about
[1:32:14] the the soldier that got put into
[1:32:16] Pharaoh's chariot or into Caesar's
[1:32:19] chariot rather. He said he didn't pull a
[1:32:22] shined up soldier that had never been in
[1:32:24] battle, but he grabbed a a soldier that
[1:32:28] was had battle scars on him. Been
[1:32:30] through some things, Brother Bill. He'd
[1:32:33] seen some things, maybe made some
[1:32:34] mistakes, but he was a battlecar
[1:32:37] veteran. Oh, I'm so glad to be standing
[1:32:39] with you battlecar veterans. Be part of
[1:32:42] that group. When we've gone the last
[1:32:44] mile of the way and we've reached the
[1:32:46] end of everything we're doing here, I
[1:32:49] pray that it can be said about us. I've
[1:32:51] fought a good fight. I've kept the
[1:32:54] faith. How many want that to be your
[1:32:56] testimony?
[1:32:57] Hallelujah. Do you love him tonight?
[1:33:01] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Sorry I
[1:33:04] was stirred tonight, but I just don't
[1:33:06] have the voice to
[1:33:08] do what I wanted to do. But let's pray
[1:33:11] the Lord will somehow bless it. And
[1:33:18] there's a battlefield in heavenly
[1:33:20] places,
[1:33:22] but we are equipped and predestinated to
[1:33:25] win that battle.
[1:33:28] Let's win victoriously
[1:33:30] with joy in our hearts with our hands
[1:33:32] raised to God.
[1:33:35] Oh Lord, today I'm going to win. I'm
[1:33:37] going to I'm going to take what's in
[1:33:39] front of me. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:33:41] fight that and I'm just going to believe
[1:33:44] for the rest. How many would say amen to
[1:33:46] that tonight? I'm going to do that.
[1:33:47] Heavenly Father,
[1:33:50] Lord Jesus, I thank you for your love
[1:33:52] and your goodness to us.
[1:33:55] I pray God that you just move in a
[1:33:56] mighty way.
[1:33:59] Lord, I I think of that Lord when I saw
[1:34:02] that quote about your prophet, how he
[1:34:03] said I'd be noisy.
[1:34:08] I had no part as a prophet, but as a
[1:34:10] pastor and a preacher here in this area,
[1:34:14] Lord, though I've not had a great
[1:34:15] ministry, but Lord, I I I've stood in
[1:34:18] this area and watched these people as
[1:34:19] they've gotten older.
[1:34:21] Lord, some of them I've been fighting
[1:34:23] beside for many years.
[1:34:26] Lord, I pray you'd help us tonight.
[1:34:29] Lord, those that are watching, some of
[1:34:30] them are sick right now, but this is
[1:34:32] just another phase of the battle. Lord,
[1:34:35] may we be victorious today. We believe
[1:34:37] that we will. Lord, when we get to the
[1:34:39] end of the way, Lord, may we be able to
[1:34:41] stand there with the hearty group, Lord.
[1:34:44] and shout for joy. The battle scarred
[1:34:46] veterans as we look in at one another
[1:34:49] and recognize that we've been given a
[1:34:52] crown of righteousness that you're
[1:34:55] appearing. We thank you for that, Lord.
[1:34:57] We couldn't earn that, but Lord, you
[1:34:59] gave it to us because we were put in a
[1:35:02] battle of heavenly places and we we won
[1:35:04] because of you. We were raised with you
[1:35:07] and we thank you for that. I pray you'd
[1:35:09] help us now encourage us, Lord, through
[1:35:10] the week. I pray you'd help us to lay
[1:35:12] aside every weight and the sin that does
[1:35:14] so easily beset us and run the race with
[1:35:17] patience. I pray you grant it now. We
[1:35:19] ask in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you Lord
[1:35:24] Jesus. Amen. Let's just worship him. If
[1:35:26] you need prayer, the altar is open
[1:35:28] tonight. Let's stand together. Oh,
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; we will not be defeated.
[1:35:40] Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; we've got the power.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord.
[1:35:53] Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Give me your hand.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it now. Let's agree
[1:36:01] together.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Let's agree
[1:36:04] together.
[1:36:06] Oh, that all of our enemies, oh that all
[1:36:10] of our enemies,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, will crumble at our feet.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Let let it give you courage for the
[1:36:20] paddle church.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; For whatever we b on earth, oh shall be
[1:36:29] bound in heaven.
[1:36:33] Thank you, Lord. is at the name of
[1:36:37] Jesus.
[1:36:41] Oh, Satan has to flee.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Sing it now. We've got the power. We've
[1:36:48] got the power.
[1:36:52] Thank you, Lord. Oh, in the name of
[1:36:56] Jesus.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:07] In the name of the Lord.
[1:37:13] Oh, though Satan raes,
[1:37:19] we will not be defeated.
[1:37:26] We've got the power
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:32] in the name of the Lord.
[1:37:39] Oh, for many years
[1:37:43] now,
[1:37:45] Satan's tried to stop us.
[1:37:51] Oh, but the bride
[1:37:54] of Jesus,
[1:37:58] Lord, were still alive.
[1:38:04] Oh, like a mighty
[1:38:07] army,
[1:38:11] we keep marching
[1:38:13] onward.
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:17] We're winning every battle
[1:38:24] cuz the Lord's on our side.
