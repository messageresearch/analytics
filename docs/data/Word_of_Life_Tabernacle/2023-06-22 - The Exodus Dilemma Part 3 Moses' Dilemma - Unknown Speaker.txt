for the music tonight we always always challenging when we use the backups and then the backups of the backups but tonight we had uh sister Allison and sister Noli up here and just good to see that God's got more people than just uh just a few that can do those jobs and I'm thankful for that and we want to encourage our younger ones to come along I really see a great future in our music and the things that we're doing we lost or we had some speakers that messed up so just bear with the sound tonight as they try to work that out and we'll have to get some new house speakers you know we could do without electronics if we wanted to bad or nothing it'd be okay be okay I'm loud enough and you could listen close enough but we won't we won't do that tonight Hebrews 11 24 is it good to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night Hebrews 11 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter to oozing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word I want to continue to talk to you as you're seated I want to continue to talk to you about the Exodus family and we're going to talk about Moses dilemma so we talked about amram's dilemma his dilemma was would he work or would he uh would he pray and he did both and and that's what Satan tries to do today is get us so involved in our work and the things that are going on we don't have time to pray we don't have time to work for the Lord but amram did both because the situation required that we found that djokabed had a dilemma that her dilemma was she had to give up her child she had to commit it to the Lord It's safety and and in rearing the child and yet we found that God had a plan for Moses and and we believe our children God has a plan for them and we've got to give them up sometimes to let God do what he does but aren't you glad he's a big God and and we found even that the Angels lined the sides of the river and and god Jehovah himself at the end waiting on the little ask it to get down to that place because it was a predestined a child that was in the boat and I believe that our children are the same so God's going to keep them God's going to help him and and so that was her dilemma though was whether to give him up and and now Moses says he began to grow how to dilemma he had a choice to make and I want to speak to you tonight and and especially to you younger ones because your choices impact more of your life but even the older ones if we can make good choices today to make up for some of the bad choices we've made in the past and and it'll still have an impact but especially when you're young your choice that you make when you're very very young has has such an impact because if the Lord tarries and you continue on eventually eventually that that's gonna that's gonna impact a great portion of your life you got to make a choice I read somewhere that the great tenor Pavarotti I don't know if anyone's heard of him but I like to listen to him sing just a an admission there he's a classical tenor and he at one time he didn't know what he was going to do with his life and and his father had actually encouraged him to uh to go to school and so he enrolled in in music school and then he also enrolled in a teacher's college and when he did that he he graduated from both and he asked his father he said should I be a teacher or a singer and his father replied son if you try to sit on two chairs you'll fall between them isn't that true if you try to sit on two chairs you'll fall between them he said what you choose now would will determine what you'll be he said for life you must choose one chair and we've got to choose today what God God's way or the Devils we've got to choose the word or the world and and I trust that you'll choose and that you have chosen the word today and that's why you're here brother Branham tells us this he says you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today I see people sometimes in in a terrible circumstance of life and they're struggling to make it they're struggling to to make ends meet maybe and they're struggling and it's choices and and maybe if they would if they could just make the right choice today and I see them pass by that choice and you think oh God if they would just make a move for God we see young people come up in the church and you think if they would just make a move how different their life could be and when you see them refuse to make that move then eventually they they end up out in the world and and you see the the struggle in their life and you see the trouble you think oh if you'd have just moved for God at a young age if you just got to bid down the business with God if you'd have just got serious while you were young things might have been different so this is especially true as I said for young people think about a teenager right we've got a few teenagers here tonight and and I'm not don't want to pick on you because there's only a few but when you were when you're 16 years old some of you are not even 16 yet but Peter's 16 and when I was 16 I was living at home I was didn't have a driver's license didn't never had a job in my life as far as in the public and a lot you know life looked you know pretty simple it was pretty simple and five years later when I was 21 I was married so life got complicated I was pastoring a church I had started my career in real estate title and I had a baby boy five years now think about that real carefully just a moment because that's where think about where you could be and how much could change in five years everything could change for that matter everything can change in five minutes but even absent some cataclysmic event or or some tragedy happening in your life things could be completely different five years from now than they are right now look how much the world changed over the last 5 10 15 years you don't have to go back very far to find that things were different and some of you could testify to that tonight things were different just a few years ago what could we be in five years in five years you could be a missionary or a bartender brother Branham tells the Sadi you could be a Godly mother or a prostitute you could be in the tribulation or the rapture you're going to be in one one or the other and Moses had that choice to make he had to he had to make his own choice his parents had kept him Alive by faith and I think some of us were kept Alive by the faith of our parents his parents literally kept him Alive by Faith by faith they hid him from Pharaoh by faith they kept him alive and many of us owe our spiritual life growing up to the godliness of our parents and the work of our parents and and the things that they did and they had kept him alive in that way their choices had given him an opportunity to make his own choice but now it was his turn it was his turn to make a choice and in Exodus chapter 2 we find where we left off last week in verse 5 the daughter of pharaoh come down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked Along by the river's side when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it so this is God's provision for Moses life and verse 6 when she had opened it she saw the child Behold The Babe wept and she had compassion on him even a crying child was in the mind of God was in the plan of God so that she would have compassion on him and said this is one of the Hebrews children God arranged it and then verse 7 then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter shall I go and call the uh to the nurse of the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and Pharaoh's daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the child's mother and Pharaoh's daughter said unto her take the child away and nurse it for me and I will give thee thy wages and brother Brown says here here was his own mother she was going to get paid to watch him he said she gonna get paid 300 a week it's probably a lot of money back then and brother when brother Brandon said that but say a high sum of money she was going to get paid to be a nanny to her own child God's able to do that kind of thing and so and the child the woman took the child and nursed it and the Bible says the child grew as all children do and she brought him into Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and what that means is he was formally adopted into Pharaoh's family uh this is this is important to understand the the saddest that Moses would have gotten from being adopted into this family it'd be like winning the lottery you think about it he he had nothing he was a come from a slaves family I mean joke about we're just trying to make it work they were doing the very best they could to try to make it work and they had nothing but here he had been adopted into the family of pharaoh and when he was adopted into the family he had everything everything he could have ever wanted now and it says he become her son she called his name Moses she said because I drew him out of the water for Moses mother I'd like to say this must have been almost as hard as committing him to the river because now she had to give him back to Pharaoh's house and he was young we don't know how old some commentators say three years old some say he was older but I think he was old enough to know who he was I think his mother had something to do with that that she taught him when he was young who he was and that he was not just an Egyptian but he was a child of the King and I think we ought to teach our children that way that they're not just an Egyptian they're not just a an American they're not aware of a different culture a different world and so she's constantly maybe finding ways to point out to her child you are not who they say you are you don't belong to the world you belong to God and so if they as he grew older and and he was in Pharaoh's house it come to pass it says in those days when Moses was grown when he was grown he went out into his brethren and see that this tells us that she taught him something about who he was or somehow he found out because he went to his Brethren he knew they were his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren now at this point Moses would have been almost 40 years old but he's still considered a young man thank the Lord he but he made he made a choice at that age made a choice to be identified oh church it's not too late for you if you're almost 40 or if you're almost 50 for almost 60. you're still young enough to make a choice to follow Christ and he was young enough to make a choice he made a choice a conscious decision that's what the Bible says by faith Moses chose the affliction shows he had the opportunity to be an Egyptian prince he had the opportunity to have everything handed to him on a silver platter to live better than billionaires do today to be in among the family and among the people that ruled the world he had an opportunity to rule or an opportunity to be a safe and he chose to be a Slave oh God he made a choice to be identified to look on their burdens to be identified with slaves oh church can you hear me tonight that's the choice that the world thinks you're making they see what you do and how you come to the house of God on a Wednesday night and they say how could you possibly make that choice to be identified with the message of the hour how could you possibly make that choice to be identified with the Holiness lifestyle how could you possibly make that choice to be a son or daughter of God are you hearing me tonight how could you possibly make that choice but brother Randall said he was looking at something else he wasn't looking at the what they could see he was looking at the Unseen he was looking for the downstairs in one place he was looking at tomorrow oh my well if we could lift our eyes tonight and look at tomorrow you young people your children look at tomorrow I'll just look at today look what you're going to be tomorrow look what's coming down the road don't just look at the pleasure of sin for a season look at tomorrow we want to go to heaven we want to spend some time together in eternity don't just look at the at the world the way that it is or it has a lot to offer but there's so much more if you can look at tomorrow made a choice to be identified with slaves rather than as a prince brother Brandon says my advice to you is don't look at the Modern things around you the popularity and the glamor that you could be but choose rather by faith oh my how many want to choose my faith tonight choose by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will right all wrongs and he will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take the despised way with the Lord's few make that choice if there's troubles in the land if there's troubles in the church if there's troubles in the home no matter where it is make your choice by faith I'll serve God and this is why the devil will bring trouble he'll bring trouble he'll he'll bring trouble in your mind because he has access to that it'll bring trouble in your spirit I mean trouble in your family bring trouble in the church why he's trying to make you make the wrong choice he's actively working today to get you to make the wrong choice and to look to the world and to and to go back and say well it would have been easier if we'd have just moved off somewhere and lived our own life and forgot about the church forgot about the people of God but I'd rather be identified with the people of God tonight I'd rather be identified with what the world goes crazy Paul says in the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers I'd rather humble my heart he says I'll humble my heart in his presence by faith I'll serve God I'll humble my heart and his presence oh could we say that tonight I'll take the way with God's children I see them despised and rejected drove out and made fun of but I'll take my post of Duty I'll stay right by and when they cry I'll cry with them when there's sorrow I shall sorrow with them the way they live I'll live oh my what a commitment that was Hebrews 11 24 by faith Moses when he was come to ears refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season is steaming the reproach or valuing the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt we had respect unto the recompense of the reward we find a young man another young man in the scripture a rich young ruler who made the opposite choice in Mark chapter 10 and verse 17 it says when he was gone forth into the wave there came one running I want you to notice the Rich Young Ruler wanted to be a Christian as long as being a Christian didn't cost him his status he wanted to be a Christian as long as being a Christian man he could still do what he always did in fact he was he was willing to live morally but he was not willing to sell out he was willing to keep the Commandments but he was not willing to be identified with Jesus and his disciples who were actually if you think about it a bunch of homeless people wandering around that's what it would have been look what it looked like wandering around Israel cast out made fun of the gospel's always been that way don't think it's strange today people make fun of the message of how they've always done that the gospel's always been downtrodden always been looked bad on it's always been a low class of people brother Branham talked about going into this great big Auditorium and he said that this one man had a meeting there and they let out right before his meeting he said I'm coming out of that meeting was doctors and attorneys and lawyers and everything else there's nothing against those people but that's the class of people this man attracted he said and then my people were waiting to come in he said there were stretchers and insane cases and and all kinds because the sick need a physician yes sir he said I looked at that that's the kind the gospel attract Jesus he thanked the father he said Lord he said I thank you that you've hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and you've revealed it to babes such as would learn that's what I want to be tonight a baby that will learn from God but the Rich Young Ruler didn't want to make that choice I want you to listen to me I know this is simple but we've got children better to make the choice at five or six or seven or ten or 15 then to wait till you're 40. better to make the choice when you're 40 than when you're 50. that's why the scripture said today is the day of salvation now is the accepted time oh how we ought to come to Jesus wherever we see the word revealed in front of us we ought to run to him the Rich Young Ruler ran to him but he wasn't willing to give anything up we ought to run to him and say Lord take away everything that's unlike you strip away anything that I need I don't need Lord take it take it away from me make me totally dependent on you he run he said good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life Luke said this this young man was a ruler another Young Prince and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there's none good but one that is God I Think Jesus is trying to make him think here why are you calling me good because you don't evidently the young man didn't recognize fully who he was coming to or he'd have did what he told him to do verse 19 says Thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness the fraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have observed from my youth been a good boy stayed in church I did all the right things and Jesus beholding him loved him we thought well that that he's in now Jesus loves you but you've got to love Jesus Jesus Loves You Jesus loved the world for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son Jesus loves you you gotta love him he cares but you've got to care one thing you lack he said go your way sell whatever you have give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me you had a choice to make and he made the wrong one Mark 10 22 he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions brother Branham says this he said now just religion won't work this one Young Ruler here he said good Master he said now remember before I say it he'd been taught to walk right he had a good education he had been taught business and was rich and was a ruler and had religion but he was confronted with another problem and it confronts all of us eternal life religion doesn't give us eternal life are you hearing me kids maybe some of the young people can say Amen religion doesn't give us a thank you religion doesn't give us eternal life religion doesn't give us eternal life religious is a covering but it doesn't give us eternal life [Music] and yet him taught with the best teachers there was he was yet lacking something I believe that you've got the best teachers that there are Godly Parents I believe he got the best Ministry I'm not talking about myself but I believe the ministry in the Earth today is the best it's ever been I believe we have the best message that we've ever had I believe this end time message is the fullness of of God expressed to the people he showed himself to us but we've got to make a choice your teacher isn't enough you're who you say you believe in isn't enough religion isn't enough religion is a covering but it doesn't give us eternal life him taught what the best teachers there was he was yet lacking something and the young man knew it because he said good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life but the Brotherhood said he was well equipped for life now we want our children to be equipped for life don't we that's a constant it's constantly in the back of my mind I want my children to be equipped for life I want them to be able to do better than I did And yet when it comes to the gospel you can't do any better than I did because I Found Jesus right but I want to equip them for life this young man was equipped for life and he said the way his father and mother and the priests and all them had equipped him but still he knew he was lacking something and brother Brown said now I'm talking to the adults I wonder sometimes if we're lacking something we found Something to Believe In but have we found eternal life we found a Doctrine but have we found life we may have even found a prophet but have we found life religion won't cut it we need life religion won't produce eternal life he said forms Sensations you feel something he said you could get scared and feel something crying that's good shouting that's good but that still ain't it you are confronted with eternal life you say well I've been a staunch Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterian or Pentecostal he said that still isn't the question I've been a good member of Word of Life Tabernacle that still isn't the question do you have eternal life I think of the question I think of the the story rather of of the the one who's coming Christian who's coming in in the book A pilgrimage progress as he's coming out of the city where he was born in the city where his wife and children were and behind him there was his children crying out to him saying come back and it's business associates crying out to him saying come back come back here you're crazy why are you setting off on this road and behind him was his own wife crying come back why are you why are you sitting on this road and and it and it it made it where he couldn't hardly stand it so he covered up his ears and he ran towards the Gate of salvation and he said life life I must have life I must tell God if we can only do that tonight if we could only when we're young while we have time while we have a future that we can we can run towards the Gate of Salvation I must have life I don't care what people think about me I don't care what they're going to say about me tomorrow I don't care what they say about me down the road I must have life you run screaming life I must have life amen this young man was taught the religion of the day but he still didn't have eternal life so he wanted to know what to do brother Brown said he had been guided successful to this and I believe that we successfully many times guide our children to eternal life that's we have the tools to do that we had been guided to the one who could help him who could give him eternal life but when he was confronted with it he refused to be guided to eternal life or to be led you're always going to be led by something right you led by your teacher you led by your parents you're led by your pastor but they can only take you so far you got to be led ultimately by Christ I can only do so much for you by counseling with you I can only affect your future so much by standing here in the pulpit and trying to be the model of what a pastor ought to be I can do my very best and be successful in that but you have got to be led by Christ brother Brown making such a powerful statement in the message leadership you you ought to go listen to it sometime because he's standing in a place where the leadership was bad and he's standing telling those people you don't you can't accept human leadership you've got to accept Christ in just a few a couple months after that he would go off the scene we must have Christ he said you've got to face one thing he said he'd been guided successful to this he got to face one thing eternal life there's only one person who can give that to you mama can't give it to you Papa can't give it to you because if we could we would right if I could take and hand my children eternal life by handing them a Bible I would do it I've given them a Bible if I could hand them eternal life by hand them a tape I would do it I've given them a tape if I could do it by handing them a book I would do it I've given them a book but Jason it's got to be more than that huh it's got to be something in your soul it's got to mean something to you it's got to be a reality in your life to be led it's not just children Church we all sometimes refuse to be led what is Christ here's the word are we willing to be led by the word when it comes to a decision in her life a dilemma that we have to face are we willing to take what the word says huh and say I have to have life I must have life he said he said mama can't give it to you papa can't give it to you your pastor can't give it to you how I wish that I could but we every chair in here would be full if I could give people eternal life if I could give eternal life there'd be no lost loved ones out there can't do that say Well it goes from bride to bride it does by the preaching of the Gospel Peter had the keys and he told them how to how to come but they still had to come they have to have their own experience and if I could hand you eternal life I would do it he said Your Leader here can't give it to you everybody that gets eternal life has got to come to Jesus Christ someone say Amen everybody that gets eternal life has got to come to Jesus Christ he is the only one who can give that part the Bible says there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus your teacher can give you an education she can teach you you have to learn it your mother can teach you to walk but you have to learn how to walk your father can teach you how to be a businessman or what you have to learn that he said but only Jesus can give you eternal life your priest your leader and so forth can teach you your religion you can learn the message you can learn the message that we are trying to teach but still that won't give you eternal life you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ he said you understand that all of you you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life he said now but sometimes other leadership listen this is key sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don't know what to do then when that time comes other leadership gets so much influence on us that we think we're okay we turn away from Christ we should never do that but turn to Christ it was Lot who chose the well-watered plains of Sodom imagine that that was a no-brainer to lot I mean he's been struggling up here with Abraham for a while he doesn't think Abraham's got it a very good thing going on all the people are fighting and fussing and having a hard time with their flocks and their herds and he looks down here and and all these years Abraham refused to compromise and go down to Sodom and Sodom the Bible says Sodom was like the Garden of Eden we live in Satan's Eden today Sodom was like the Garden of Eden it was well watered everywhere you imagine living in a place like Arizona and you look down there and you see a Great Plain and it's filled with it's well watered and it's beautiful in its green and so well I got I got herds I've got I could plant crops or whatever I I could all I had to do is go down there and Abraham never went and so Abraham gives lot his choice he said you can go one place to the other wherever you go I'll go the opposite way and law says well that's a no-brainer I'll go down to Sodom yeah I'll be all right yeah there's some there's some stuff going on down there I've heard about some stuff but yeah you know I'm a good man my family is a good family we can handle it that's a dangerous place I've had people tell me brother Ben I can handle it and I always grieve when they tell me that I can handle it no you can't you think you can but you can't handle it if it's if it's against the word see Abraham looked at the land and he's something different he saw that that that judgment would come on the land of Sodom but in the land of Israel there was a future oh we've got to see the same thing someone said to choose the beginning of a road is to also choose its end right right but you can't choose just based on what it looks like at the beginning well this looks like a better Road it might look like a better road but what is it at the end what's at the end of the road and the end of sodom's road was fire and brimstone the end of sodom's road was a pillar of salt saw himself becoming mayor of the city but brother Branham taught us he could not see the destruction of his family oh God oh if we could as as men as as husbands if we could stand and begin to look what what is our family going to be like what's it going to be like if we go this way he did not see his wife becoming a pillar of salt he could not see his daughters getting him drunk when you look at the future of America what do you see there ain't much I think we can see with prophetic eyes today I think a prophet is coming to state has lifting us he's gone over the fence and looked and said there's destruction coming to the land of America nothing he said but but chaos nothing but Atomic fodder we look at the future of America we see judgment because we look through the eyes of a prophet in this day with eagle eyes we see judgment but what can you see when you look at your future you look at your future and say well I'm going to be a basketball star I'm going to be a quarterback in football and and the odds of that are pretty low someone ran the odds of that the odds of your child becoming a famous or a like an NFL player or something like that you'd be much better off playing the lottery and uh well maybe Jason though he's pretty good at baseball Matt and he's probably pretty good at some sports and some some of the rest of you kids you're probably pretty good but you got the odds of doing that not breaking your bones or or tearing something and and failing at that many more people try and fail than ever make it you may see money and fame but God knows your future can you see beyond that I look at some of these I know I'm going slow tonight but I just wanted to sink in and can you see beyond it I look at some of the you know a lot of people see their future as an Instagram star I have people tell me what are you gonna do when you grow up I'm being influencer okay that hasn't been a thing for very long and I don't want to laugh at you because you might make money doing that what do you have to give up well you have to give up what do you have to wear well what do you what do you have to do to sell yourself on Instagram what do you have to do because you are selling yourself that's what an influencer is salesperson and you're selling yourself when you look at your future what do you see well I'll be a I'll be a star I I'll have a viral video I'll I'll have a breakthrough I'll I'll get some stuff done I'll I'll be the next Chef or I'll be the next what do you see in your future some of y'all don't have enough future you don't even know what I'm talking about you sitting there like my future looks like an old Folk's home but choices still matter you can choose to have a good attitude you can choose to love the Lord with all of your heart you can choose to be an example to the young people and show up at church right you can float in on a fire bed of ease or you can choose to pick up pick up your cross and follow Jesus you look at your future what do you see can you see beyond the the fame of today I I'll be honest with you I look at some of these people I see pity I have pity for them I I wouldn't trade my place I wouldn't want my daughter to trade her place if my daughter ends up just being a housewife and she may she may not ever get married I pray that she doesn't actually just in case anybody was wondering I'm praying that she doesn't get married saying that for the for the listening audience my daughter is is only 14 years old but you know what if she if she does and becomes a housewife and that's all she ever is I say that's a big job I say it's a pretty rare job I wouldn't want her to trade places with Kim Kardashian some of y'all know who that is I wouldn't want her to trade places with one of these country stars or or rock and roll Stars it's empty fake the whole world's gone that way but here we have love and joy and peace I want them to I want them to have the kind of life I've had and how can they have that only by accepting eternal life see can you see beyond see the Bible says that the works the day of the Lord will come as the thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away the great noise and the elements you met with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein that's all the social media all the sports all the stuff that you might want to be in your life is going to be burned up all of it is all the works are getting burned up he said seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved someone say all all these things should be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation lifestyle and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat with Ruth who also made a right choice when she told Naomi she said don't even treat me not to leave thee return from following after thee whether thou goest I will go where thou largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people that God will be my God where thou will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death party in me listen she didn't go with the majority there is not a book of orpha in the Bible right there's a book of Ruth and there's a reason why there's not a book of orpa Ruth took the harder Road Ruth chose to go with Naomi don't look what the majority does following the crowd is easy cattle move in herds we're not cattle that's the Psalm of Life the old poem says don't be like dumb driven cattle driven by every every wind of of desire and every every fear or desire cattle are driven by fear and desire for food and they all move together and that's the world that we live in people are driven by their basis desires but somebody has to be different somebody's got to be driven by their their desire for God you know they found that when you take sheep are you still with me tonight if you take sheep and you put them in a pasture that their sheep herders have found that coyotes will come and they'll just wait and because the Sheep always stay in a herd and what they'll do is they'll they'll pick them off one at a time because what sheep do is they're driven by Fear And when they see the coyote they have no natural defense so they kind of bunch together and and and and and and it's good that they Bunch together but every once in a while straggler will come along and the coyote just eats it and and he he just hangs out with the Sheep eating little sheep but you know what they did to fix that they put llamas in the herd and a llama doesn't run from a coyote the coyote can't keep him herded up coyote will come after sheep and actually hurt the Sheep and get them to go in the wrong direction but uh but a llama will actually walk up is what I've been told we'll walk into the face of the county and look at it and the coyote not being a very big or impressive dog he he don't even want to try it the coyote might be able to hurt Aloma but he don't even want to try because Alum is different you don't go with the hurt he just walks right up and face him he don't have any fear that's the way we ought to be we ought to walk right in the face of the devil the Bible says resist the devil he'll flee from you resist the devil that's the way we ought to be listen Daniel made a choice to either diet of vegetables and water that's a choice right there that's difficult he had a opportunity to drink wine and eat red meat and you chose vegetables and water because it was God's word for that day I'm glad it's not today but he had a choice to feed on the world or on the message we could put it that way Daniel saw that he would be better off doing things God's way he's soft tomorrow the three Hebrew children made a choice to not bow to the image they chose fire over the worship of a false god because they saw it tomorrow and they said in Daniel 3 16 Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king old Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter said we don't even have to think about it if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us do you believe that tonight he's able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto the O King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up the Fourth Man showed up in the fire because they looked at the Unseen most people choose pleasure over suffering I do you know what I choose pleasure over suffering many times you know why we do that how we do that we choose our easy chair right that's the Natural Choice the easy chair not go to the gym or walk right the Natural Choice is to choose pleasure over suffering but when it comes to the things of God we're going to choose differently what a foolish thing the young men of his day must have thought when Moses chose to take his place with The Afflicted and suffering people of God why did he do it by faith when he lifted up his eyes he looked beyond the glamor of this world he looked beyond the pleasures of sin and the Bible said that he endured seeing him who was Invisible by faith and he made a choice to serve that God regardless what took place he said it has not changed many of us could go to what we would call a better building we could enjoy the fellowship and pleasures of sitting in a better Pew we might be more popular to drink and to smoke and to dress and act like the world but what's the matter you've lifted up your eyes and by faith you see him who is invisible and have took your stand with the rejected and so-called Holy Rollers of the day for by faith we see him who is invisible choosing to suffer the persecutions and the affliction brother bear said I wouldn't say to people they should choose to be afflicted I don't say that you should choose suffering it would not be the human thing to do but if suffering lays in the path of Duty let's take it as it comes I wouldn't say for you to get out here and carry on do something that was Radical I wouldn't want you to do that he said so that somebody would say you're a fanatic you bring that on yourself but if it lays in the path of your duty towards God let the world say what they want to say you live on what a pharaoh could have saw what Moses saw he saw the sufferings of the people he knew that what the price was to pay but by faith he chose it rather than to have the pleasures of sin he said and in this Faith walk there Comes A Time there has to be a choice lot made that sad mistake that we make a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose things that would be better listen he said sometimes if there's a little squabble comes in the church someone would say well the Deacon or the pastor is on this side he said don't look at that boy it got quiet we got to choose right what do you choose eternal life what's eternal life the word amen there's a choosing Oh my he said the Deacon of the pastors on this side don't look at that look at what's righteous oh my oh hopefully we would all do that tonight get that thing out he said and bring them both together that's Godly yeah right in other words don't take sides bring them together it's a choosing that we choose for ourself we choose something that's for our own good Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace and he might walk with the people of God every one of us are going to meet God one day I'm closing with this there's a famous poem I probably read it to you before I love it I like Robert Frost is my favorite poet but you did a poem called The Road Not Taken it's misunderstood because he meant it as a joke but it has powerful words and he wrote it though as a joke for another poet by the name of Edward Thomas whenever they would be out walking in the countryside Thomas would never could decide what road to take you ever met anybody like that just just always to always couldn't make up his mind and then if you start down a certain Road he didn't find you know something to look at he'd gripe the whole time he was walking down the road man if we went down the other way we'd have found something he never could decide what road to take and so the famous poem is two roads diverge in a yellow wood and and he began to look at him and compare them and and then he says it in the end he said I shall be telling this with a sigh some were ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood I took the One Less Traveled by that has made all the difference when he wrote this poem it was 1917 or 1916 when when the world was at War the world rushed to war not the first world war was maybe the stupidest War all wars are fairly stupid but it was maybe the most insane War if I could put it that way that there ever was was World War One because it was just people fighting over power and some of them didn't even know why they were fighting because of alliances and things that they had with other countries and the p and people were just slaughtered because technology had went beyond tactics and people were just being slaughtered on the in no man's land in The Killing Fields and he sent this poem to his friend Edward Thomas and it wasn't but just a little while later two months after he received it that Edward Thomas was killed in battle and the World wishes that it would have taken a Less Traveled Road and just not showed up for the war I wonder today if we just because the culture is doing it if we just all run towards something and we we all just well I got to partake in it I got to be a part of it what if we just stood back to Less Traveled Road all of us have to meet God at some point and what road we take will have made all the difference and where we end up when you choose the beginning of the road you choose the end of the road choose in heaven you're choosing peace you're choosing Glory you're choosing that rather than hell and hardship take the Less Traveled Road not not Guided by impulse or whim which is kind of the way it is in the poem but by faith in the word of God I'll take the road that God chooses and you bow your heads with me I wonder if we could just think about it for a moment I want you kids to think about it where will you go if you continue down the road you're on if you've never given your heart to Christ where will you be if you've never come to the one who is eternal life maybe some of you older ones need to think about it what are you going to what's the end of your current road if you put your trust in theology if you put your trust in what a man says or have you put your trust in the Eternal God you can trust the word that's the only thing you can trust sure can't trust your own mind over the word how could we do that trust the word if you've never given your heart to Jesus that would be a good time to do that you say you can you do that on a Wednesday night absolutely absolutely you can if you've never chose Jesus if you've never maybe you face a decision today a quandary problem a dilemma I don't know what to do it seems like the Bears in the cave and the bears under the tree I I don't know which way to go there's a way there's a way that seems right to a man the end thereof is the way of death but there is a way truth in life and that is Jesus follow him follow his word it'll be okay into the road when you choose this beginning the end of the road will be okay maybe you liked it with every head bowed and every eye closed maybe you'd like to slip up your hands say brother Ben pray for me I've got choices to make I I want to make the right choices I want to live for God God bless those hands I got choices to make I I want to do the right thing I want to live for God oh God I want to I want to choose I want to choose the people of God over the pleasures of each I've got my hands raised as well God bless those hands Heavenly Father Lord as we come in this solemn moment Lord we think about what you mean to us and what you've done for so God [Music] and how much Lord that that you've taught us in bringing us to this decision but Lord today we we must make a decision for you I pray or that you'd help us to take the Less Traveled Road to press on Lord maybe there'd be someone here Lord maybe one that raised their hand would be discouraged not knowing what to do what what decision to make oh God would you help them Lord would you just help them to make the decision that is according to the word lead them and guide them oh God by your spirit of Truth I pray you granted today Lord I pray for these young people that are here and those that are watch Lord I pray that you'd move in their lives Lord I want you to move in the lives even of the young ones Lord I see some of the little ones Lord that we're listening tonight as I was preaching I pray God you'd help them to make that decision that Moses made not the decision of the Rich Young Ruler but the one that Moses made I don't want to be a sports star if that'll lead me away from you I don't want to be a business a big business man if that'll lead me away from you or if I can do business and and stay with you I'll do that but Lord I want what you want for my life I pray you granted Lord I pray you'd move in their lives today or we thank you for them I pray you'd build them up encourage them Lord for you to encourage all of us to follow you in every area of our life
