for [Music] [Music] [Music] J [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] there [Music] [Music] [Music] Church [Music] that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good how are you [Music] [Music] [Music] he said there see [Music] [Music] there e [Music] [Music] [Music] you fire [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] time [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] Once Upon a Mountaintop near Jerusalem three little trees stood and dreamed of what they wanted to become when they grew up I went to hold treasure I want to be covered with gold and filled with precious stones I've always dreamed about that that I'll be the most beautiful treasure chest in the whole world the second little tree looked out at a small stream trickling by on its way to the sea I love the water when I grow up I want to be a huge ship traveling Mighty oceans and carrying powerful Kings I'll be the biggest and strongest ship in the world the third little tree looked down into the valley below where busy men and women worked when I grow up I want to grow so tall that when people stop to look at me rise their eyes to heaven and think of God I will be the tallest tree in the world years passed the rain came the sun Shone and the little trees grew tall one day three wood cutters climbed the [Music] mountain come on guys let's cut some wood hey h time frame dude those AR invented yet [Music] this tree is this tree is beautiful it is perfect for what I'm going to do with it with a swoop of his axe the first tree falls this is wonderful now I shall be made into a beautiful glittering box I will hold wonderful treasure the second wood cutter looked at the second tree and said wow this tree is perfect it's perfect for my building project just the kind of wood I need with a swoop of his axe the second tree falls the third tree felt her heart sink when the last wood cutter looked her way she stood straight and tall and pointed bravely to heaven and your tree would do for me with a swoop of his axe the third tree falls the first tree rejoiced when the wood cutter brought her to a carpenter shop but things did not happen how she had hoped the busy Carpenter was not thinking about treasure chests Shalom I'm in need of a carpenter are you for hire um maybe I already had plans for this wood I wasn't expecting visitors today I'm sorry the Sheep followed us here they follow us everywhere they followed you they seem a bit wild it's just the way I train it's just the way I train them they follow us everywhere don't worry sheep don't bite well actually they do but ours don't at least I don't think they will don't come the Angels told us we had to hurry H I need you to build me a major for my sheep they eat a [Music] lot oh oh there you are phw that was a long trip way back down to the old village and back here's your coffee they had a special today on cinnamon and goat milk lattes goat milk latte yum I got an extra one just for me since we're the one that made the Run don't forget to pay him hey guys I didn't think Starbucks was invented yet oh hey do you deliver the Angels told us we had to hurry Angels whoa you heard from Angels yes tonight the Angels told us in the city they would a sa would be born come on guys let's get [Music] going the once beautiful tree was not covered with glittering gold nor was she filled with riches diamonds and rubies she was just coated with saw dust and filled with hay for Hungry animals [Music] [Music] his name is Jesus it means savior he will be the Lord of our Salvation I will never forget when the angel revealed this to me on that night golden Starlight poured over the first tree as Mary placed her newborn baby in the manger and suddenly the first tree knew she was holding the greatest treasure in the world [Music] if I were there on that Silent Night would I hear Angels Sing Praises in the sky if I were there would I go with haste with humble Shepherds to seek his holy place if I were there i' find the manger and bow before the tiny savior I sense the peace that filled the air if I were there if I were there if I were there on the silent [Music] knock men who Journey from a far if I were there would I gladly breathe my finest treasure to laay before for my king if I were there I find a manger and bow before the tiny savior I sense the peace that filled the air if I were there if I were there I was not there but inside I know that precious baby who came so long ago was Jesus Christ Lord of Heaven and Earth I sing his Praises as I Cate his birth if I were there I'd find the manger and bow before the tiny savior I sense the peace that fill the air if I were there if I were there [Music] the second tree smiled when the wood cutter took her to a shipyard but no Mighty sailing ship was made that day instead the one strong tree was hammered and sawed into a simple fishing boat she was too small and too weak to sail on an ocean or even a river instead she was taken to a small Sea called Galilee [Music] e what we need we need need your boat we need your boat sure go ahead but be careful it looks like rain those clothes are terrible I think a storm is bre I think it's a hurricane it's okay it can't get any worse just start rowing a storm is coming we should name it hurricane herodias oh brother keep rowing Jesus needs his rest Jesus needs his rest I feel sick I feel like I'm going to be sick the waves are getting higher you'll be fine keep rowing the thundering and thrashing storm got worse the little tree shuddered she knew she did not have the strength to carry so many passengers safely through the wind and the waves and the rain this is getting serious shall I wait Jesus shall I wait Jesus Jesus will help us then Jesus awakened he stood up stretched out his hand and said peace be still the storm stopped as quickly as it had begun and suddenly the second tree knew she was carrying the king of heaven and of [Music] Earth peace be still [Music] still still on this night Heaven's light peace peace Prince of Peace healer of men peace again peace peace is here Angels near shers make wise men seek peace peace Prince of Peace healer of men peace again peace peace peace on Earth savior birth Heavenly peace we will keep hallelujah hallelujah Prince of Peace healer of men [Music] Prince of [Applause] Peace the third tree was confused when the wood cutter cut her strong beams and left her in a Heap what happened all I ever wanted was to St stay on mountain top and point to God [Music] I have orders to you from Rome but now I have my un Rock to do don't get smart with me we have a crucifixion do now get busy and report back to me H Shea one Friday morning the third tree was startled when her beams were yanked from the Forgotten wood pile she flinched as she was carried through an Angry jeering Crowd she shuddered when soldiers nailed a man's hands to her she felt ugly and harsh and cruel but on Sunday morning when the sun rose and the Earth trembled with joy beneath her the third tree knew that God's love had changed everything and every time people thought of the third tree they would think of God and his perfect love gift to mankind that was better than being the tallest tree in the world stand okay stand [Music] [Music] it's not about the manger where the baby lay it's not just about the Angels who sang for him that day it's not all about the Shepherds or the bright and shining star it's not all about the wise men who Trav B from afar it's about the cross it's about my S it's about how Jesus came to be born so that we could be born again it's about the stor that was rolled away so that you and I could have real life somay it's about the cross it's not just about the good things in this life I've done
