[0:14] foreign
[3:45] you
[4:16] welcome to our study on first
[4:18] corinthians today
[4:19] um we're on part seven and we're going
[4:22] to go from there i'll give you just a
[4:24] minute while we kind of go over what we
[4:27] looked at last time and it's been a
[4:29] couple of weeks since we've done this
[4:30] and just bear with us we'll do this as
[4:33] we can from time to time i try to do it
[4:34] every week on tuesdays around
[4:36] noon or 12 30 today starting at 12 30
[4:40] and i will give you just a minute to
[4:42] join if you want to watch live and then
[4:43] you can watch
[4:44] later of course on youtube or facebook
[4:47] and these are usually about 20 minutes
[4:49] long but uh we
[4:51] don't really put a time limit on it but
[4:52] that's usually what it comes out
[4:54] to and today we'll go through nine
[4:56] verses
[4:58] but i want to go over a little bit of
[5:00] what we talked about last time
[5:02] in chapter two of first corinthians we
[5:05] talked about
[5:06] how paul preached the hidden things of
[5:08] god and so he said i come to you
[5:10] not with excellency of speech or of
[5:12] wisdom so he's saying i didn't
[5:14] come with the wisdom of the world
[5:18] but i did preach to you hidden things i
[5:20] did preach to you
[5:21] things that you would need to know that
[5:24] you do know
[5:26] uh that are the mysteries of the gospel
[5:28] the good things of the gospel i
[5:30] i preached to you those things but
[5:33] i did not come to you i did not present
[5:35] it in a worldly manner it did not
[5:37] present
[5:38] it according to the manner of men but it
[5:40] did preach the hidden things of god
[5:42] and he taught us that those hidden
[5:43] things are revealed only by the spirit
[5:45] of god those hidden things are not
[5:46] revealed by
[5:48] me just sitting down and teaching you
[5:50] something but it's by the spirit of god
[5:52] it takes the spirit of god because what
[5:54] man knows the things of a man except the
[5:56] spirit of a man
[5:57] paul says what things knows the things
[5:58] of what man knows the things of god
[6:00] except the spirit of god
[6:02] and so he said the spirit reveals these
[6:05] things to us
[6:06] and he taught us that we should compare
[6:08] spiritual things together we should
[6:10] compare
[6:10] not scripture with the world not our
[6:13] ideas
[6:14] with scripture but scripture with
[6:16] scripture compare spiritual things
[6:19] with spiritual not with worldly wisdom
[6:22] but not the way people think in the
[6:24] world but according to the scripture
[6:26] according to the word of god
[6:28] and then he taught us that we have the
[6:30] mind of christ and what a comfort that
[6:31] is to know
[6:33] that we it's not up to us to try to
[6:34] figure these things out
[6:36] but we have the mind of christ as the
[6:38] bride of christ to know what he wants
[6:40] done with the word and how to put into
[6:42] action
[6:42] how to live the word and that's the
[6:45] important thing is how do we live the
[6:46] word it's not
[6:47] so much what we say but what are we
[6:50] going to do
[6:51] what are we going to do with the message
[6:53] that we've been given
[6:54] and i think that's a challenge to us
[6:56] today what are we going to do with it
[6:58] we have it we have the spirit we have
[7:00] the word we have all these things but
[7:01] what are we going to do with it how are
[7:02] we going to put it into action
[7:04] and so brother branham says something to
[7:06] the effect of that when he says
[7:09] don't jump any higher than you can live
[7:14] so let's go into first corinthians
[7:16] chapter three and paul really gets down
[7:18] where they live and
[7:19] and to the root problems root causes of
[7:22] the problems that they're having in
[7:23] corinthians
[7:25] and so chapter three is a very important
[7:27] chapter in the
[7:28] in the book of first corinthians i'm
[7:29] sure you've heard it preached on many
[7:31] times but let's get into it
[7:32] verse 1 says and i brethren
[7:36] let's stop for a moment i'm going to go
[7:37] ahead and pray i want to do that before
[7:39] i get into the word i
[7:41] forgot that let's pray heavenly father
[7:43] we thank you for
[7:45] letting us come together once again i
[7:47] ask you lord to
[7:49] uh come and and just speak to us through
[7:51] your word today
[7:52] and those that would listen i pray that
[7:54] they would be blessed and those who
[7:55] would listen later
[7:56] i pray that they would be blessed as
[7:57] well we ask in jesus name
[7:59] amen all right let's go out kind of
[8:03] a little antsy today to get into this
[8:06] first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 1
[8:09] and thy brethren could not speak unto
[8:11] you as unto spiritual
[8:13] but as unto carnal even as unto babes in
[8:17] christ so paul identifies two different
[8:19] types of people
[8:20] one on that next slide is spiritual and
[8:24] spiritual people if you underline that
[8:25] in your bibles as i'm doing
[8:27] spiritual people are people
[8:32] and one of the definitions of that and
[8:34] there's a whole list of definitions but
[8:35] one was
[8:36] one who is filled with and governed by
[8:39] the spirit of god i like that a
[8:41] spiritual person is one who is filled
[8:43] with
[8:43] and governed by the spirit of god
[8:46] it's someone who thinks spiritually who
[8:49] acts
[8:50] spiritually that's the greek word for
[8:53] spiritual
[8:54] and then he contrasts that with carnal
[8:56] so he says i could not speak unto you as
[8:58] if you were
[8:59] spiritual governed by the spirit of god
[9:01] filled with the spirit of god
[9:03] he said but i had to speak unto you as
[9:05] if you were carnal
[9:07] and now they were believers as we found
[9:10] out they were saints
[9:12] sanctified ones they but they were not
[9:15] walking by the spirit of god they were
[9:17] babies in christ
[9:18] instead of being grown uh adults and
[9:21] then being governed by the spirit
[9:23] and so we see that there's an increase
[9:26] as we live
[9:27] and as we go and as as we become mature
[9:31] in christ there should be an
[9:32] increase in the power of the spirit in
[9:34] our lives and
[9:36] the manner in which we're governed by
[9:38] the spirit if we remain
[9:40] in a place where we're believers but our
[9:42] lives are not governed by the spirit of
[9:44] god and are not governed by the word of
[9:45] god there's a problem
[9:47] we're stunned and so he says carnal
[9:51] then would be the opposite of that so he
[9:52] sets that as a contrast
[9:54] spiritual and carnal and to be carnal is
[9:57] to be governed by mere
[9:58] human nature and not by the spirit of
[10:01] god
[10:02] so we want to be spiritual not carnal
[10:07] so paul says i could not speak unto you
[10:09] as as in the spiritual but as the carnal
[10:11] now that next slide
[10:13] in hearing receiving and acting on
[10:16] hearing receiving and acting brother
[10:17] preaches that sermon in 1960
[10:20] and he deals with the difference between
[10:22] esau and jacob
[10:23] and he types one as a carnal believer
[10:25] and the other is spiritual believer
[10:27] and i want you to recognize that even as
[10:30] a spiritual believer born again
[10:32] of the spirit of god if we were born
[10:34] again of the spirit of god we have to
[10:36] walk
[10:36] by the spirit of god and there are times
[10:38] when a born-again believer will act like
[10:40] a carnal believer
[10:42] and there's times when a carnal believer
[10:44] will do certain things that may maybe a
[10:45] spiritual believer would do
[10:46] but if you look at it through the
[10:48] entirety of what what it is that they do
[10:51] and who they are
[10:52] you'll see one's a carnal believer
[10:54] another is a spiritual believer
[10:56] so brother branham says we find out in
[10:57] every revival that's ever been born in
[10:59] the world
[11:00] it produces twins he said every revival
[11:02] has twins they have a bunch in there
[11:04] that's carnal believers and a bunch of
[11:05] spiritual believers
[11:07] he said every revival produces that an
[11:10] esau
[11:11] and a jacob
[11:15] and as they go along he said first thing
[11:17] you know the colonel begins to think
[11:18] well
[11:19] these guys are getting off the deep end
[11:21] he said i better separate myself from
[11:23] them
[11:24] he said they go back to the intellectual
[11:26] part and why is that because that's how
[11:28] they were born
[11:29] that's who they are they're carnal
[11:31] believers so they go back to the
[11:32] intellectual part
[11:34] and brother madam then identifies a
[11:36] carnal believer
[11:37] as this and i think it'd be good for us
[11:39] while we're studying this to remember
[11:41] this
[11:42] he said they want a pastor that will
[11:43] speak to them of pleasant things
[11:46] they don't want that spirit-filled
[11:48] pastor that will obey the holy spirit
[11:50] from the platform
[11:52] just preach the word just like it is
[11:55] and so you identify a carnal believer or
[11:59] a spiritual believer
[12:00] based on the type of ministry that they
[12:03] want
[12:03] and that they feed from they don't want
[12:06] a pastor that'll
[12:07] speak to them the things of the lord and
[12:09] just preach the word like it is
[12:11] they want someone who'll speak to them
[12:12] of pleasant things and so we want to be
[12:15] spiritual believers today so
[12:18] again brother branham says in that same
[12:20] sermon he said as john said lay the axe
[12:22] to the root of the tree let the chips
[12:23] fall where it will
[12:25] he said most of the churches today will
[12:27] vote that out of their pulpit
[12:28] that's right it'll come a separation
[12:31] always does that
[12:33] it did it in the methodist age it did it
[12:34] in the bamboo stage it did it in the
[12:36] pentecostal age
[12:37] it'll do it in every age and so if it
[12:39] does it in every age it'll do it in our
[12:41] age
[12:42] that there will be a separation based on
[12:44] what people want to hear
[12:46] and i pray that we would always want to
[12:47] hear the word that's what we want
[12:49] regardless of how that word is presented
[12:51] or how it looks to us we want to hear
[12:54] the word of god and nothing else
[12:58] so in verse 2 he says i fed you with
[13:00] milk and notice he says i have fed you
[13:02] with milk
[13:03] and he uses the same language when he
[13:05] says i came to you when i came to you i
[13:06] came not with excellency of speech
[13:08] he says i have fed you with milk so he
[13:11] says i was there with you for a year and
[13:12] a half and i
[13:13] while i was there with you i fed you
[13:15] with milk i didn't give you any meat
[13:18] because he says hitherto you were not
[13:20] able to bear it
[13:21] but he says now there's a problem
[13:24] because
[13:25] it's one thing when you're new brand new
[13:26] in the gospel and you're not able to
[13:28] bear the meat
[13:29] he says but now you're supposed to be
[13:32] grown you've been down this road a few
[13:34] years
[13:35] it's been a while since i left you and
[13:37] he says you're still not able to bear it
[13:40] and you're lifted up you've heard great
[13:42] ministries
[13:43] you've had apollos and peter and and
[13:46] you've been influenced by all of these
[13:48] ministries
[13:49] you've had he was paul himself was their
[13:51] pastor for a year and a half
[13:52] but he said i fed you with milk
[13:55] i couldn't give you meat because you're
[13:57] not able to bear it
[13:59] it would have offended you and jesus
[14:01] said blessed is he was not offended in
[14:03] me
[14:05] he said neither yet now are you able
[14:07] what an indictment that is he said you
[14:09] haven't grown at all
[14:11] remember these are christians he said
[14:13] but you haven't grown
[14:15] you still want the milk in
[14:18] trying to do god of service without it
[14:19] being god's will brother branham speaks
[14:22] of that text that he's taking about
[14:24] david and how
[14:25] he made the difference between david and
[14:27] and
[14:29] and all the how what he should have done
[14:31] how he should have
[14:32] done things according to the word and
[14:34] consulted the prophet
[14:36] yet he had all uh the people excited and
[14:38] was a great revival but god wasn't in it
[14:42] and an innocent man died because of it
[14:44] and
[14:45] brother branham speaks of that he said
[14:46] now notice this it's a very treacherous
[14:48] text if you don't get it right
[14:51] he said and i feel that the hour is
[14:52] coming where we should be men instead of
[14:55] babies
[14:56] he said we should have strong meat
[14:59] instead of milk
[15:01] i would challenge us today in our church
[15:03] and that's what i'm speaking to today
[15:06] if you're listening today and you go to
[15:08] word of life tabernacle let's eat the
[15:10] meat of god's word let's not be offended
[15:13] because
[15:14] well we don't like the way it was said
[15:16] no we want to eat the meat
[15:18] we want what god we want something
[15:20] that'll put a reality in our lives of
[15:23] the
[15:23] that'll bring strength to our lives we
[15:25] can be mature christians
[15:26] we're too far down the road to still be
[15:30] drinking milk all the time we want the
[15:33] meat of god's word
[15:34] and if we're going to have the meat of
[15:35] god's word we're going to have to begin
[15:36] to put these things into actions not
[15:38] that we're not but we need to increase
[15:41] in that
[15:42] we need to grow up and i think in the
[15:45] message
[15:46] we have that you know and among us
[15:49] there's a vision believers there's
[15:50] corinthian believers
[15:52] i want to be an efficient believer i
[15:53] want to be one who can accept the meat
[15:56] and yet stays with it because we know we
[15:58] want another ephesian it's not another
[15:59] corinthians
[16:02] first corinthians 3 and verse 3
[16:05] says for ye are yet carnal now he's
[16:07] going to show them why
[16:09] he's saying he's called them babies and
[16:11] it's a big deal to call someone a baby
[16:14] i i know my kids never wanted to be
[16:16] called babies after they got a little
[16:17] bit bigger i'm not a baby
[16:18] well he says here's why here's why i
[16:22] called you a baby
[16:23] he said for year yet carnal fleshly
[16:26] if he said for whereas there's among you
[16:28] envying and
[16:29] strife and divisions those three things
[16:32] envying
[16:34] strife and divisions are you not carnal
[16:37] and walk as men or walk like the world
[16:40] walks
[16:42] there's among you envying strife and
[16:44] divisions i like what adam clarke said
[16:46] about this he said there's three things
[16:47] worthy of note
[16:49] these people were wrong in thought word
[16:51] and deed
[16:53] envying refers to the state of their
[16:55] souls they had inward grudgings and
[16:56] disaffection
[16:58] toward each other envying
[17:01] and and that's also the word is
[17:03] emulations that's the same word for
[17:05] emulations you find that in
[17:07] galatians and and i've talked to you
[17:09] before how brother branham talked about
[17:10] that that
[17:11] emulations was competition one with
[17:14] another especially among the ministry
[17:17] so and that's a problem today we're not
[17:20] in competition with each other we're in
[17:21] competition with the devil
[17:23] and that's the way we should keep it but
[17:25] they had
[17:26] envying which was inward grudgings and
[17:28] disaffection towards each other
[17:30] strife or contention now so the first
[17:33] thing is is thought and envy
[17:35] or an emulation the second thing is is
[17:38] a word or strife what they talked about
[17:41] he says
[17:42] strife refers to their words they were
[17:44] continually disputing and contending
[17:45] whose party was the best
[17:48] each one endeavoring to prove that he
[17:50] and his party were alone
[17:52] in the right that sounds familiar
[17:54] doesn't it
[17:56] divisions refers to their conduct so it
[17:59] manifested itself in
[18:00] their thoughts their words and their
[18:02] deeds divisions refers to conduct they
[18:05] could not agree they contended
[18:06] till they separated from each other and
[18:09] thus rent or tore the church of christ
[18:12] they tore it up they tore it apart thus
[18:14] the envying and grudging led to strife
[18:16] and evil speaking
[18:17] and this led to divisions and fixed
[18:20] parties
[18:23] and paul continues to explain to them
[18:25] why they why he was saying they were
[18:27] carnal and they were babies
[18:29] he says for while one saith i am with
[18:31] paul
[18:32] notice one says i'm of paul or i listen
[18:35] to paul
[18:36] i lean on paul paul's teachings
[18:39] another says i'm of apollos i lean on
[18:41] apollos's teachings
[18:43] he says are you not carnal now again you
[18:45] say well what's wrong with being of paul
[18:47] well paul even includes christ in this
[18:51] he said there was a party of christ that
[18:52] said i don't listen to any man i just
[18:54] listen to christ well
[18:56] the fact that they made that an issue
[19:00] means that it was wrong and the because
[19:03] god has
[19:04] men so there was a party of christ but
[19:06] there was a party of paul
[19:07] but paul is identifying that party is
[19:09] wrong too it's not just the party of
[19:11] apollos
[19:12] which was the major problem that he
[19:14] deals with in the book of ephesians but
[19:16] it's also
[19:16] the party of peter and the party of paul
[19:19] those are wrong too these are all men of
[19:20] god
[19:21] but what's wrong is the people who say i
[19:25] identify with that man that's the man
[19:27] that's going to make get me through i
[19:29] know if i listen to that man
[19:30] and i follow that man that that that's
[19:32] what's going to get me through no it's
[19:34] not
[19:35] what's going to get you through is if
[19:36] you believe the word if you hear and you
[19:38] act you recognize you act on the word of
[19:41] god and you are the bride of christ
[19:42] you're the seed
[19:44] germ of god from the beginning that's
[19:45] what gets you through not because
[19:47] of who you listen to on a regular basis
[19:52] so he says are you not carnal who then
[19:55] is paul
[19:57] who is apollos he says but
[20:00] ministers and that word in that day
[20:02] would have been understood as a servant
[20:04] we'll get to that in a moment he said
[20:06] ministers
[20:07] by whom you believed another word for it
[20:10] might be
[20:10] messengers who's paul who's apollos they
[20:13] carried a message
[20:16] by whom he believed even he said as the
[20:18] lord gave to every man
[20:21] that word ministers again is diaconos
[20:24] which is the
[20:25] same word used for a deacon and he's not
[20:27] saying that the office of a minister in
[20:29] the office
[20:29] of a deacon is the same thing but he's
[20:32] saying that they have a similarity in in
[20:34] this that they're servants
[20:36] they serve the people they're not served
[20:40] by the people they're cert they serve
[20:42] the people and so he says
[20:46] that word is one who executes the
[20:49] commands of another
[20:52] it's a master a servant or
[20:55] other master a servant an attendant of a
[20:58] master
[20:59] a minister if you go into old government
[21:02] theory if you've ever studied old
[21:04] old world governments they had kings and
[21:06] then they would have ministers and the
[21:07] ministers in many cases might be smarter
[21:10] and
[21:10] than the king and they might be more
[21:13] able but they had to carry out the
[21:14] commands of the king
[21:16] and and the person that got the glory
[21:18] was the king
[21:20] not the minister and so in some cases
[21:23] you had kings who were considered bad in
[21:25] history and kings who were considered
[21:26] good
[21:27] the only difference was the ability of
[21:29] their ministers
[21:30] but the king gets all the credit so he
[21:32] says you're like a
[21:34] you're like a minister a servant
[21:37] the servant of a king like a deacon
[21:40] someone who who serves food and drink a
[21:42] waiter
[21:44] you're carrying a message you're
[21:46] responsible to somebody
[21:48] but you don't get the glory for it
[21:52] there's a wonderful story that jesus
[21:54] tells a parable in luke chapter 17 and i
[21:56] won't read all of it because we're
[21:57] studying here on corinthians but
[21:59] go back and read it if you get the time
[22:02] and
[22:02] luke tells this story of how
[22:06] that he said you know he talks or jesus
[22:09] tells it
[22:09] and luke relates it to us how that these
[22:13] men
[22:14] if you're a master and the disciples
[22:16] would have understood this if you're a
[22:17] master and you have servants
[22:19] if your servant gets done in the field
[22:21] and he's out there plowing and
[22:22] does all these things all day you don't
[22:24] say oh okay go go sit down in the house
[22:26] and i'll i'll fix you dinner you don't
[22:27] do that he's a servant
[22:29] so when he gets done what happens you
[22:31] say fix me dinner
[22:33] why because he's still a servant when he
[22:35] gets done
[22:37] the field belongs to the master the the
[22:39] what he sowed the seed that he sowed
[22:41] belongs to the master the increase
[22:43] belongs to the master he said when when
[22:45] you get done
[22:46] there's just more work to do there's not
[22:48] a a
[22:49] a reward in this life for the things
[22:52] that you do and so
[22:54] when he gets the end of that story jesus
[22:56] says so likewise ye
[22:58] when you shall have done all those
[23:00] things which are commanded you
[23:03] say we are unprofitable servants
[23:06] we've done that which was our duty to do
[23:10] that's what we are as ministers
[23:13] we've done our duty if we do everything
[23:17] you know you know he said a dispute paul
[23:18] says a dispensation of the gospels
[23:20] committed to me we're stewards
[23:22] of the mysteries of god we should
[23:24] understand it that way
[23:26] it doesn't give us a right to form
[23:27] clicks and clubs and feel like we have a
[23:29] a right to live differently or uh not be
[23:33] exposed to the things that the people
[23:34] are exposed to no we we have the same
[23:36] requirements and more
[23:37] so because we represent a king
[23:43] brother branham speaks of this and he
[23:44] says in the message influence
[23:47] and i'm going through this slowly
[23:49] because it's very important it's very
[23:51] important to us today
[23:53] brother brown says we all know of men in
[23:55] the field today great men
[23:57] he says some of them gets to a spot till
[23:59] after they get their congregation all
[24:01] around them
[24:02] they feel so secure until they think
[24:05] they can even sin
[24:07] and get by with it and brother branham
[24:09] is speaking i believe
[24:11] he tells this a different way several
[24:13] times when he preaches on influence
[24:15] and i think he's speaking of a
[24:17] well-known evangelist of that time who
[24:19] had a drinking problem
[24:20] a healing evangelist and because he
[24:23] talks about it in different places and
[24:24] you get that idea
[24:26] but he says they think they can even
[24:27] ascend and get by with it he said we've
[24:29] been knowing of ministers taking the
[24:31] wrong road
[24:32] he said and many times that's because
[24:34] they feel secure
[24:37] security can be a danger in the ministry
[24:40] and it can be a danger to us to those
[24:43] who are in the laity
[24:45] what happens is you become secure
[24:47] because i'm a paul
[24:49] i'm off apollos i'm of christ you're
[24:51] secure in your party
[24:53] when you should have security in christ
[24:55] so it matters what you're secure
[24:57] in security is a great thing but don't
[25:00] feel secure because you have your
[25:02] congregation around you don't feel
[25:03] secure
[25:04] because everybody tells you you're doing
[25:05] the right thing because usually when
[25:07] everybody tells you you're doing the
[25:09] right thing it might be the wrong
[25:10] thing now he says
[25:14] they think they can even sin and get by
[25:15] with it he said we've been knowing of
[25:16] ministers taking the wrong road
[25:18] he said many times that's because they
[25:20] feel secured
[25:22] that all the people will let me get by
[25:23] with anything
[25:25] he says the people might my brother but
[25:28] god won't
[25:30] see you're going to answer to god he
[25:32] said you must never try as a minister to
[25:34] try to deceive the ears of your
[25:36] congregation regardless
[25:38] of how much they can scream or shout or
[25:40] carry on
[25:41] or pat you on the back and say the
[25:42] message is wonderful and i won't lie
[25:44] i like to hear that i love to hear that
[25:48] you know that was good it spoke to me
[25:51] but that doesn't help me any
[25:53] you understand it it helps me feel
[25:54] better but what really helps is knowing
[25:57] and seeing people
[25:59] receive the word of god and actually
[26:01] benefit from it
[26:03] but people pat you on the back many
[26:05] times for the wrong reasons
[26:07] he said regardless how much they would
[26:09] scream or shout or carry on or pat you
[26:10] on the back and say the message is
[26:12] wonderful
[26:13] he said you must be a servant to christ
[26:17] paul says who who are paul who is paul
[26:19] who is apollos but ministers
[26:21] servants and brother biola says you must
[26:24] be a servant to christ to stay
[26:27] honorable with that word because that
[26:29] word will reflect itself
[26:31] through you and you're going to
[26:33] influence somebody that's watching your
[26:35] life
[26:36] he said young people likewise
[26:38] businessmen the same way
[26:40] so each of us have a responsibility
[26:43] because of those that we influence
[26:46] one more quote on this we'll move on
[26:49] brother branham talks about
[26:52] how that and i'm running out of time
[26:54] brother brown talks about
[26:55] in the seventh seal how he had the
[26:57] vision of a little baby shoe
[27:00] and and the first pole in the second
[27:02] pull of
[27:03] fishing he's fishing and he talks about
[27:06] the first poll and
[27:07] he says when you do the fish will run
[27:09] after the lure he said and then watch
[27:10] your second pole it'll only be small
[27:12] fish and then the third pole will get it
[27:14] and then on that next slide and the
[27:15] seven seal he says a voice come and said
[27:17] you can't teach
[27:18] pentecostal babies supernatural things i
[27:20] think i skipped down one
[27:22] but he's talking about how that he
[27:23] always gets involved with a bunch of
[27:25] preachers
[27:26] and these preachers actually pat him on
[27:28] the back and say
[27:30] and if you go back a couple of slides
[27:32] you can go back to that first slide in
[27:34] the seventh seal
[27:37] and or that second slide
[27:40] i skipped that second slide he says all
[27:42] the ministers that's 292.
[27:45] all the ministers got around me said
[27:46] brother branham we know you can do it
[27:48] you think that'd be a good thing but
[27:50] brother adam never said his problems
[27:52] come
[27:53] from people telling him he couldn't do
[27:55] it but from people telling him he could
[27:58] he says all the ministers got around me
[27:59] and said brother branham we know you can
[28:01] do it hallelujah
[28:02] brother branham he said that's where i
[28:03] always get tied up with a bunch of
[28:05] preachers he had cheerleaders
[28:06] we don't need cheerleaders we need
[28:08] people to speak the truth
[28:10] he said i always get tied up with a
[28:11] bunch of preachers see i love people
[28:13] they want you to explain everything this
[28:14] that and then he later on says a voice
[28:17] come and said you can't teach
[28:18] pentecostal babies supernatural things
[28:20] these were not mature christians
[28:22] so they couldn't receive the third pull
[28:25] paul says i couldn't give you meat
[28:28] because you couldn't see that i was just
[28:30] a servant
[28:31] you couldn't see that apollos was just a
[28:33] servant
[28:35] you wanted to lift these men up it's
[28:38] wrong
[28:39] whether it happened in paul's day or
[28:40] today first corinthians 3 and 6 i have
[28:43] planted apollos watered
[28:45] but god gave the increase it's not mine
[28:48] it's god
[28:50] so then neither is he that planteth
[28:52] anything verse 7 neither he that
[28:53] watereth
[28:55] but god that giveth
[28:58] the increase
[29:02] he says now he that planets and he that
[29:04] watereth are one
[29:06] they're one they they work for the same
[29:10] master
[29:12] he says and every man should receive his
[29:13] own reward according to his own labor so
[29:15] we are one but we receive our own reward
[29:18] there is a reward for service
[29:22] he says for we are laborers together
[29:24] with god
[29:27] and so he's saying that all the gifts
[29:29] are from god but each man
[29:30] will be rewarded for his own efforts and
[29:33] we'll get into that more when
[29:34] we get to the next teaching on this he
[29:37] says for we are laborers together with
[29:39] god i love the way paul puts this
[29:42] he says ye are god's husbandry
[29:46] you're god's building what does that
[29:48] mean
[29:50] it means that both the materials that we
[29:52] use to build
[29:53] and the finished product are gods
[29:56] the emphasis in the original greek is on
[29:58] god
[30:00] it says we are laborers together with
[30:02] god
[30:03] he says you are god's husbandry you are
[30:06] god's building they're you're not mine
[30:08] it's not my church it's not someone
[30:09] else's church where laborers together
[30:12] should respect one another we're
[30:15] laborers together with god he didn't say
[30:17] that
[30:17] you could only respect those with a
[30:19] large congregation your laborers
[30:21] together with god
[30:22] your god's husbandry your god's building
[30:25] both the materials and the finished
[30:27] product are gods and yet each one of us
[30:31] as ministers will be held accountable
[30:34] for how we used those materials
[30:37] you think the same way about your family
[30:39] and about the people that you influence
[30:40] in your life
[30:42] you're laborers together with god in
[30:45] that effort
[30:46] your family belongs to god the people
[30:49] that you have influence over in your
[30:51] life but they belong to god
[30:52] but you're a laborer together with god
[30:55] to get the glory for god
[30:58] both the materials and the finished work
[31:00] is god's
[31:03] and this is the way the cambridge uh
[31:05] commentary puts it he said the apostles
[31:07] that last slide
[31:08] the apostle now gives the argument
[31:10] another turn from man's point of view
[31:12] the preachers of the gospel are mere
[31:14] instruments in god's hands
[31:16] not so from god's he regards them as
[31:18] responsible
[31:20] so we're responsible to him but to the
[31:22] people we're just instruments in god's
[31:24] hands
[31:25] we're responsible he regards them as
[31:27] responsible beings responsible to him
[31:29] for the work they do
[31:31] but the results are still gods and gods
[31:33] alone
[31:34] the ministers of christ may be fellow
[31:36] laborers with god
[31:38] but the husbandry the building are gods
[31:42] and not theirs the responsibility is
[31:46] still there but when we all get
[31:48] completely done with all the work that
[31:50] we have to do in life
[31:53] he says you're unprofitable servants
[31:55] you've done what you were commanded to
[31:57] do
[31:58] go and finish the work
[32:03] i want to really if you're watching and
[32:06] following along with this go and read
[32:08] chapter three of
[32:09] first corinthians and especially the
[32:11] next verses it's very important
[32:15] what we do and especially those of us
[32:16] involved in the ministry
[32:18] it matters matters how we treat people
[32:20] it matters
[32:22] how we treat one another and it matters
[32:24] what we're building with
[32:26] the material is god's the building is
[32:28] god's the glory is god's
[32:30] but there will be a reward for our
[32:32] service on the other side
[32:34] i'm thankful for that let's pray
[32:35] heavenly father thank you for all that
[32:37] you've done for us today
[32:39] i pray the word would just be sewn into
[32:41] our hearts lord and
[32:42] you see lord that i'm an imperfect
[32:44] servant
[32:45] i'm not doing this to gain notoriety but
[32:47] lord i
[32:48] i just want to help our church in any
[32:50] way that i can and i pray god that you'd
[32:52] move and speak to each one
[32:54] if there's one that's sick or in need or
[32:55] has a need today
[32:57] i pray that you would meet that need we
[32:59] ask it in jesus name
[33:01] amen god
