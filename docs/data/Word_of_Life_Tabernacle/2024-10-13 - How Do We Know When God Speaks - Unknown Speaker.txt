don't let us pass up the opportunity of another service we don't know when might be our last one Lord but more than ever before I want to love you I want to I want to take my opportunity to worship you today we thank you and we love you in Jesus name amen amen so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we're going to uh read from Hebrews chapter 1 we're also going to read uh over in second Peter chapter 1 Hebrews chapter 1 verse one 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 16 while you're turning there I uh we're going to have a youth service tonight and we don't want to ever neglect doing that I had a little note given to me here a while back and it says can you do more Youth Services brother Ben please and that was one of the young girls here on the front and I'm I'm glad they want to have church so you girls want to have church we're going to have church so we'll do that this afternoon brother Joel will be speaking to us and so we're looking forward to that and of course we all want to come and support them uh in that we've got a new a member of the church aah Rose Andrews I believe I I said that correctly aah Rose and uh it's good to have Philip here today God bless you and all of you here and Grandma here and different ones and we're glad to have you all here and uh but that they're just thrilled I saw the baby last night and it's healthy and and Katherine's healthy so we thank God for that and uh brother Isaac is just thrilled you know to be a father so we just love those kids they're like kids to me because I was their Pastor when they were little and so just just like my own children and so we sure love we sure love the family and pray and the Lord will just bless them and that they'd raise that child in the fear and admonition of the Lord amen amen Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in time pasted unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds and then I want to go to 2 Peter chap 1 and verse 16 it says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard I just love Peter's testimony he said I was there on the mountain and I heard the voice that spoke when we were with him in the Holy Mountain we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed is unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word and you may be seated Peter is speaking here of when Jesus Took James and John to the mountain and he sees Moses and Elijah with Jesus and he says let's build three Tabernacles one to each of them and the Bible says while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son hear ye him hear ye him and brother Brenham says about that he talks about how that Moses and Elijah represented the law and he said I don't want his law it puts me in jail I don't want his Justice it condemns me I want Mercy we all want Mercy don't we he said God knows we all need Mercy I want his Mercy he said what did Jesus represent his Mercy his his love he said if you're without love hear ye him if the barrels empty at home hear ye him if the cruise has run dry hear ye him if you've got a broken heart hear ye him if you need joy in your soul how many can use more joy in your soul hear ye him who is he he is the word so if you need these things if you've got a need for Joy if you got a broken heart he said hear him if you need forgiveness of your sins hear ye him if you need healing for your body how many needs healing today hear ye him hear the word so it came from a part meral fulfillment to a a fullness God manifested In the Flesh and he said now I want you to hear him you've heard the law and the prophets you've heard Moses you've heard Elijah now hear him yes all right right now watch he said he represents all that God was the fullness of the God had bodily dwell in him hear ye him Justice Mercy met and paid the debt and God said this is my beloved Son hear ye him he said Methodist your church is all right but hear him Pentecost your church is all right hear ye him you're shouting wonderful but hear ye him they're speaking in tongues wonderful right but hear ye him your denomination wonderful but hear you him you can have all those things and still turn a deaf ear to him that's now just to kind of establish that as a background to what we want to say today now what I want to speak to you on is how do we know that it's God that's speaking how do we know that God is speaking and that the voice that we're hearing is God and if someone came to you today or someone does in the future and said God told me to tell you to do this right how do you know that what they're telling you is the truth how would you know that it was God speaking I want you young people to listen even your children to listen this morning as Elders I think and not just because it's me that's speaking but I come up a certain way and I've been through some things and I'm not old but I've I've got an old spirit and uh I I've seen some things and and I've been around and some of you all that have been around you you you'll understand and you'll be able to fellowship with me on this thought that we grew up I grew up under uncertainty and the kind of uncertainty that I grew up under was a man standing in the Pulpit that thought he had the ability to tell me whether I was saved or not whether I was going to heaven or not even if I was predestined or not based on gifts and based on signs and I and I'll never forget an instance in my life when I was 12 years old just about the age of these young men sitting here some of these girls and I was 12 years old and and a man my my pastor who was also my father spoke to me and and asked me if I'd seen a certain sign that he said it happened and I told him I didn't see it and he said well you must not be predestined and so I grew up under that uncertainty of whether or not I was predestined whether or not I was the elect based on whether or not I had seen a sign yeah huh some of you don't know what I'm talking about and so it creates it breathes uncertainty because it it it ties what we are and who we are and our election to what a man has to say about us but I want you to understand this morning your election has nothing to do with signs your predestination has nothing to do with what some man says about you I may not be able to see it but God can see it and and that's why we don't get too offended you know we may disagree with somebody somebody might somebody might come and say well uh you know uh you don't belong here or something and and you're not a Christian or whatever but that don't bother us too much because we have to make our calling and our election sure between us and God and if nobody else serve God I'm going to serve him anyway and if nobody else thinks I'm serving God I'm going to serve him anyway so I grew up under that kind of uncertainty of and I know I know some of y'all stories I know you've experienced some of the same things that some man could tell you whether or not you were saved that week right and you're not saved because the pastor thinks you're saved right because every time you miss church I doubt it you know I just like no I'm just kidding huh right CU I I might look at that and say my goodness what's that person doing wonder if they even have the Holy Ghost but you have the Holy Ghost because you come God's provided way you repented and were baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost not cuz I say you have it are you with me now not because somebody else says there some some gift spoke to you and we're getting to a point now where it seems like some gift has to speak to tell somebody if they've got the holy ghost or not you got the Holy Ghost because you come according to the word so I grew up under uncertainty my wife grew up under the same thing thing in a different Church different place in fact our parents almost met my dad talked to her pastor which was her uncle on the phone and they were going to meet and they never did and I ended up meeting her because I went to here by the Daryl Ward preach at her church and I'm thankful he went I'm thankful he did that that's the reason I have my wife today so if you're looking for a wife or looking for a husband go to church it's a good play you know that trat don't you so it was a good place to go and and so we went to church and and I went to her church and she come to find out she grew up under the same thing and my dad's passed away and to his reward and and her pastor her uncle had passed away to his reward as well but at you know he he would tell them something to do and he told a certain sister she had a dark cloud over her life and she still lives under that amen and and he he told a he he told a certain uh he told and I'm just being honest with you told her mother that she was all right to leave her husband and marry somebody else and later on says oops I was wrong I'm being very open with you today because I want you to understand where I'm coming from we don't go by that you go by the word right what does the word have to say about it cuz I could be wrong but the word will never be wrong heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away yes sir so I guess maybe Britney and I are are uniquely tuned to that because we grew up under that and she's got many stories of that and I do as well but I won't bore you with that this morning but you see when when you have that it breeds uncertainty in your life it's an uncertain sound you're just not sure what's being said if you're saved or not if you're able to make it or not it breeds un certainty and uncertainty breeds in action right because you're not sure if you're saved you're not sure what you should be preparing for you're not sure whether or not you're going in a Rapture you're not sure whether or not you can be healed so you're waiting on something and so it it causes you actually to be in a state of inaction look at 1 Corinthians 14 and8 where Paul is dealing with the gifts and he says this for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle because the same trumpet that sounds charge also sounds Retreat right and if you're not sure what the trumpeter is blowing if you're not sure of the tune if you've not been trained to hear the sound how are you ever going to come out see so if you just have people blowing horns all over the place and all kinds of stuff going on do you realize what it does it's just confusion we're living in a time of confusion we're living in a time when on every hand there's somebody who's going to tell you the Lord said this or the Lord said that and I say the Lord has spoken he has spoken and we ought to believe it I was so thankful when I left home and I was got out and I know my mother and sitting here my brother different ones we were so thankful to come around people that that their their standard was the word and some of the men I've been able to priv to fellowship with some of the churches I've been privileged to preach in and things all over the world and I found men that that believed the word and stood by it and and they didn't go by what how they felt and didn't go by uh some some little feeling or some emotion or some gift although those things are wonderful but that's not what we go by we go by the word and so I was so thankful to find people that would do that and yet I see that uncertainty coming back in the hearts and the minds of people and I want you young people to understand that you're not you don't get unsaved because somebody tells you you got some kind of a spirit on you or something like that you check that out with the word don't just take what that man says about it find out what God said you don't have to believe that the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits and see if they're of God right are you with me now brother brand said there never was a time that things was so uncertain as today and anything that's un un certain cannot be trusted right just remember that anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted if it ministers questions to you it cannot be trusted church if all it does is Minister questions then what good did it do you I've heard preachers preach sermons and all it did was create mystery I'm not here to create mystery I'm here to dispel and tell you the books been open and the mystery's been revealed if there's a question brother brand said anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted if there's a question don't do it at all right don't do anything that's uncertain I've said that before when covid come around people wonder should I take a vaccine should I not and now everybody's looking hindsights you know we can see that a little bit better what all happen but but at the time I told people I said if you can't do it in faith don't do it right because it's uncertain to you you don't do anything uncertainly so brother Randon when he preaches this the sign of the end sir I hope you'll you'll just allow me a little bit of time this morning to go through this and then but Joel can come preach us all happy tonight but brother BR said now I do not believe that there's anything that he has spoken this a remarkable statement he said I do not believe there's anything that he has spoken all these years of my life that I have spoke to the people but what come to pass he said and many people's come with dreams that he's L Me by his grace and interpret for the people now he's about to uh interpret these dreams that have come and he's about to give them to the people and tell them about them and say what they meant but he said there's many people come with dreams he said that he's let me interpret and many has come with dreams and with problems I was unable to interpret he said but I haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers I wish I could church I I really do there are times as a pastor I wish I could just sit here and say you know God showed me you should do such such and such and and I know there's a there's a certain element in the church that you would because you trust me and you love me you you'd want to do that brother Ben if God showed you I want to do that and it'd be easy to slip into that and start to say well God showed me that you should do that but you know you that have counseled with me and been in my office and talked to me or or you've dealt with me with problems you know what I tell you I I don't tell you God said I'm we careful with doing that I tell you this is what the word says and and this is my opinion but you make sure that you go back to the word because we don't want to introduce a gimmick that has all the answers he said I've tried to be honest and to tell you what was truth and I can only tell you as he told me and then as it come to me then I could tell you he said I want to warn you in this day that we're living in there's many not saying anything against people but when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word what' he say he talked about the many lepers in the days of uh of uh of Jesus many widows in the Days of Elijah many lepers in the days of nonon he said we find out there's many things that God does he doesn't reveal to his servants and no servant is greater than his Lord and then God will not share his glory with nobody he is God and when a servant becomes a place that he tries to take the place of God then God takes his life and moves him away somewhere or something he said we must remember that he said now in those visions and interpretations I cannot tell the interpretation of a dream until I see exactly by Vision what the dream was and he even goes as far as to say he told them what they left out of the dream when they told him the same as Joseph did right when he when he told pharoh's dream the same as Daniel did when he told Nebuchadnezzar's dream that's the pattern of the scripture said but all these Impressions we mustn't take them you don't have to take my word for it let's take what a prophet had to say we mustn't take them and say thus sayeth the Lord we mustn't do that we must have a direct voice an answer from God before we can say it's God not an impression not a sensation no matter how much it's pulsating I've been stirred to say things before that I've checked myself and the Holy Spirit has checked me because it wasn't with the word just because you're stirred to say it doesn't make it right so he said no matter how much it's pulsating you might say I believe it could be this way but when you speak thus sayith the lord it's not you all right right and again we want to get we want to get away from that church we want to grow up we want to grow up into him in All Things where we're not going by sensation or feeling we're going by what the word that's all we can go by as easy as it would be to run the church by dreams or by visions or by something else it's not how the church was meant to be run the church was meant to be run by the word and and when there was an open Vision that was a great thing and when the prophet was here on the earth that was a great thing but now we have more than an open Vision do you realize that this morning we've got more than an open Vision we've got an open book that's right go back to perfect faith brother brand said the the the word is greater than the vision that's right yes sir so he said he said when you speak thus sayi the lord it's not you watch on the platform have you ever seen it fail have you ever seen it fail there's a prophet right thus sayith the Lord is perfect never has failed and as long as it's thus sayith the Lord it can't fail but so far he's protected me because I've waited on him yes I haven't tried to seek popularity or vain Glory of men I've tried my best to live humble live the kind of a life I think a Christian should live he said and I haven't been able to do that within myself but he has done it until this day he said as I say he is the one that's led me we believe God speaks we believe God still leads we believe the sons of God are led by the spirit of God I'm not telling you God never spoke to you I'm telling you check it out with the word yes sir brother Brandon said if you have a strange feeling or want feel that to do something he said check it out with the word and consult your pastor why do you consult your pastor not because he's some super spiritual man that'll have a dream or a vision about it he might but but most of the time they don't most pastors are not also prophets but but did you know did you know that sometimes the pastor might know something you don't know about a situation that's why we check it out with the word and consult the pastor right and I don't mean you have to consult the pastor about every little detail of your life because I know I've told you before I know some things I know more about antiques than I do about modern things I don't know much about cars I have a terrible history with cars buying cars and then them breaking down on me so if you ask me which car to buy I'm probably not going to be able to give you that answer correctly I have an opinion but it's not very good right I don't mean I don't have an opinion but don't take that as thus sayth the Lord are you with me Church church so how how do we know when God speaks we want to know don't we he said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't fall we want to know that God has spoken I believe you're the elect I don't believe you'll be deceived but we don't want people to be misled we don't want because we see you know problems come and people come and speak things that that cause people to move in a certain direction and and maybe they wouldn't have done that at all if they just went by the word but they do it because somebody said so all right and so the first thing we want to know is when we want to know if God is speaking or when God speaks first of all does it come to pass not 99 times out of a hundred but a hundred times out of a hundred now see God told Moses he said he said I'm going to raise up a prophet like unto you I know I'm teaching this morning but just just hang with me God said I'm going to raise up a prophet like unto you and what was he telling Moses he was saying there's going to be someone come in the form of a son of man a son of man and he'll speak and that's what Hebrews 1 is saying when he speaks right that's what Peter's saying hear him right because what he says comes to pass and after he says that Deuteronomy 18 God tells Moses that in verse 21 if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him now what does that mean you don't have to follow him you don't have to listen to him right you don't have to right you you listen to a person that's a privilege to them you're the bride of Christ you don't have to listen to everything that comes down the pike everybody that tells you thus said the Lord or they got a vision or they got a feeling or they got a sensation or they've got something you don't have to listen to all of that don't make yourself vulnerable to all of that go by the word and then within your own self grow to a place of maturity maybe you could have a vision maybe you could have a dream maybe you could be led by God but don't let somebody lead you around by the nose cuz they say they're spiritual then you find out they're not even living it at all CU you know the life that you live you don't know anybody else now look he said Thou shalt not be afraid of him brother brandom says this he said I'm seeking the Lord now before the change of his ministry he said to find out a real straight message from God he said I by God's help I just aim to hold on until he comes he said that's till he makes some statement to me there's something that's fixing to happen around here and I want to know what it is I want to know directly from God so I can say it's thus sayeth the Lord he said and then you can the people then will know that it isn't me so I want to try to make it so that or hear from him first because if he puts his words in a person he said well then it's not the person anymore it's him and if the man is saying it in himself it won't amount to anything anyhow but if he's the word of the Lord is in the man it'll come forth and then it'll be just exactly right he quotes that scripture we read in Deuteronomy he said that's how God has he said he's got his regular program laid out here where in the Bible we know how to read that out but there's certain things he said to the church to the time and things he hasn't got written here in the Bible so he puts his voice into a person and they speak it Forward see speak it forth so then the way to judge that person find out whether it happens the way they say it he said then if it does then keeps hat then keeps happening that way not just it happened once but it keeps happening he said then we know that come from the Lord then we have confidence then to make ready for the things that's coming oh my so so the word speaks to make us ready but we cannot be made ready if it's an uncertain sound now so make sure it comes to pass what else we want to make sure it stands the word test right in other words it doesn't contradict the word right because if and then our example earlier if if someone told you go Mar go divorce your wife and marry somebody that else that's not the word go divorce your husband marry somebody else that's not the word the holy spirit will never tell you to do that right no matter how good you feel about it and how it just never will tell you to do that right it just can't do that because he will not speak against his word and so brother Brandon said if the gift won't be corrected by the word he said it wasn't a true gift right because if it won't take correction of the word if it won't come in the word order it's not a true gift Galatians 1:8 but we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse Revelation 22:18 he said I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man someone say any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so the word only comes who does the word come to Amos 3:7 a prophet brother brand said the word only comes to the prophet right and a prophet's credentials is that he stays with the word see that takes all the uncertainty out of it church and we can't brother brandom told the Pentecostal people he said I want to get you away from this fear and scare bring you up to where you're settled and you're not babies anymore you're growing up into the grace of God you you're not you're not just going by every wind of Doctrine and every little whim that comes along and you just change with this and change with that but actually it's got to be something that settles you and the word is what does that so if it isn't in Bible in the scriptures or in the Bible order it can't be received as God speaking I want to I want to bring this down real close if Paul said to do it a certain way and we don't do it that way it's not God yeah right yes it's not God right especially if it's corrected and it's still doesn't do it the right way brother brandom said it's not God and and you getting real close now right it now it's Believers brother BR he's talking by the prophet it's Believers watch for the Fulfillment of what their Prophet said that's what I'm looking for right CU anybody could tell you anything but I'm watching for the Fulfillment of what my Prophet said and my Prophet is William brandom right and and why do you say that not because the man was anything great but because God spoke through that man it never missed and he was proved and Vindicated to be a prophet so I'm waiting for the Fulfillment of what their Prophet said and that's identification that they are God's prophets because first he said they're inspired next they stay exactly with the word of the hour he said then that's his credentials see and it won't contradict what another Prophet previously said right so we know that a prophet can't come along and tell us we can't have preachers when a word Prophet told us we have a five-fold ministry right so the second prophet come can't come around and change that I think we all agree with that right well also a word Prophet can't come and tell us that no brother brand didn't know what he was talking about and he you know he didn't really know what he was talking about when he put the gifts in order Paul didn't really know what he was talking about we're just going to do it differently now how could he do that he can't do that are you with me now it can't be received as God speaking because you don't know if it's God or not right right and if it isn't in order it's not with the word right now one of the ways God speaks is by gifts and we're going to deal with that just a little bit and then then then I'll let you go because gifts are speaking something not written in the word right that's the purpose of the nine spiritual gifts if it's something written the word then I can say it as a preacher we don't need the gifts for that right we we've got men that can preach that that's our job is to rightly divide the word right because a gift could operate through a woman or through a man right they don't they don't come and bring the word right a woman doesn't come in then stand up in the in here and bring the word to us right we we we believe that's ordered of me the men do that men who are called of God right and and the same the same same chapter in 1 Corinthians 14 where Paul says I suffer not a woman to teach or you serve authority over a man it's the same chapter that he talks about setting the gifts in order right so one of the ways that God speaks in is by gifts now gifts have to be judged before they can be given to the church you ever ask yourself why because you don't know if it's God or not right no matter who's talking you don't know if it's God or not yes now again if it's the word if it's the word just the word just speaking the word then it is God right because God is his word but God don't need a gift to do that but the gift is something that comes and tells you there's something going to happen and you need to stay away from a certain place at a certain time so it's something specific to someone specific so so how how do you give a gift the word test you see if it comes in the order of the word because it wouldn't be something written in the word but it's got to come in the order of the word so if it won't come in order it's not the Lord Paul says let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge and I know people interpret this verse very differently in different ways but a prophet of God interpreted it over and over and over again for us the same way every time and he he talks about in speaking of Prophecy or tongues because tongues interpreted as prophecy we don't have to wonder how Paul would apply that in a church like ours because a word prophet in our day showed us how to apply it he said watch what Paul says if one speaks with tongues and the other one interpret whatever he said let it be judged first before the church can receive it in 1 Corinthians 14:29 we find out any gift in the church has got to be judged first that first one was in 1953 the second quote's in 1964 brother Bram never changes on this he said you have to watch because evil spirit slip in because remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that was sent to ripen the weat also ripens the weed the same water a church I want the gifts in operation I want them to move but when the gifts are operating correctly they're in the church like the Ephesian church when you didn't even know they were happening are you with me now they were in the Ephesian Church Paul don't even have to deal with it they were in order right but they could take the meat of the word because they had moved to a place of maturity that's where we're called to be in this hour we are not called to be a Corinthians church called to be an Ephesians Church not another Corinthians but another Ephesians so he said the same rain that was sent to ripen the wheat Rens the weed the same water God has a law now on this in the law of the spirit you have to watch because Satan slips in and Paul when something was revealed to somebody it had to have at least two or three judges before it could be told before the church right and that's not one or two places I read you two places it's dozens of places brother brandham says that so if it isn't judged by two or three with a gift of wisdom or deser ger of spirits it isn't right with the word and you shouldn't receive it as thus sayith the Lord right so the only gift that isn't judged is a sear right a prophet well the Brandon makes that distinction dozens of times he said every gift has to be judged except the word Prophet why because the word comes to the prophet right and and and the one we were promised in this day has already come we're not looking for another what they say when they were looking they said shouldn't Elias first come and Jesus said he already came right but Elias shall come and restore all things the one that promised that would come has come and he has restored all things and we're standing here with an open book that we have the word of God in our a we don't have to guess at these things church we don't have to be vulnerable to these things we don't have to be wondering whether I'm saved or whether I'm not whether I can be healed or whether I can't or whether I can be free or whether I can't no the word tells me I'm free the word tells me I'm safe the word tells me I can live that I'm going to make it in a Rapture the word tells me not because a man stood there and told me but the word speaking through men that's told me that I can judge it by the word so then if somebody says well I'm a prophet too that you have to be that Prophet or an impersonator there's no in between right it there just not church I'm not trying to be harsh but I got to clinch this in and and move on you know know me I don't just Hammer these things and move but it's just church you don't I'm living proof of overcoming that thing but I also know the damage it can cause I've been there I've seen it and some of y'all have too that's why we don't just jump on every bandwagon that comes down the street because we know these things this isn't the first time it's happened it's happened many times before and we just and again I'm not preaching any certain situation I'm just for us let's stay with the word let's believe what God says let's believe that we're healed because God says we're healed let's believe that we're saved because God says we're saved let's believe that how can I give these young people just a say well dream come to me they don't know if a dream come to me and I've told you I'm a I'm a dreamer I have dreams and I can tell my dreams and it may mean something it may not mean something but I'll tell you what what I can tell you I can tell tell you by the Landon that God is for you I can tell you that he's with you I can tell you that he loves you why because the word says that are you with me now the Bible tells you that I can tell you young girls that that he wants to save he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost he wants you to be free he wants you to worship he wants you to why can't I say that because God said so in his word you don't have to take my word for it take the word of the Lord you can read the same thing that I preach right in the Bible you can read the same thing that we preach right in the message of the hour are you with me now you can check it and see it's never failed it's never been wrong it's always the same we were not we're not going to be spoken into the Rapture by by fallible gifts by gifts with a margin of error we're going to be spoken into the Rapture by the spoken word of a prophet that begins to speak through a bride who becomes the final voice to the final age good another thing we could use to say is it the Lord and not is it specific right the Bible says when you pray use not vain repetitions see he said they think they should be heard for their much speaking the heathens do we don't just repeat ourselves right we should ask God for something in prayer and hold on to it brother BR said I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in interpretation but it must be something Direct ly to the church not the Lord is coming soon or something which is all right but don't use vain repetitions Jesus said as heathens do you say well that's not what that scripture means brother brandom said it did right the Divine the revealer of the truth in our day said it did again he said now you see but many times in our churches we permit people just to raise up even when you're preaching speaking tongues making an altar call somebody speak in tongues somebody too and give interpretations he said merily one of them I believe I believe the person is genuinely speaking in tongu T he said but I believe the other is more or less prophesying CU some will speak in tongues maybe for five minutes and the other one give four words of interpretation see it has to be at the same sound the same rise and fall of voice he said and then again if they say it and it doesn't come to pass then get that evil spirit away from you he said you don't want that in my Tabernacle he said when one speaks like that he better have it he said it's wrote down if it doesn't come to pass they get that evil spirit out of them I'll tell you well that was just for brother Brown's Tabernacle he's not preaching to his Tabernacle in this quote he's preaching somewhere else and and we've confirmed they actually did that at the Tabernacle just speaking to brother Kenny caps whose uh father is was brother caps who led songs brother Kenny's kind of a he may watch this brother Kenny's kind of a funny guy you know he's all over the place and excitable but I like brother Kenny but he he's just all over the place but but he uh he did tell me I asked him and some of the brothers were with him a couple weeks ago what did Brother brandham do about this in the Tabernacle cuz I had been told that it never happened brother Kenny told us that it did happen that they actually wrote Things in and they read it over the pulpit he said my dad read it he said and then if it didn't come to pass they come up got up and they told the people it's the evil spirit it didn't come to pass and brother BR tells us they did that at his church they actually did it and so he said it's got to be exact not some repeating Jesus said don't use vain repetitions as heathens do it's got to be something directly to somebody or to help the church or to help the cause he said that's wrote right down and the people who speak with tongues them great gifts help the body of Christ they meet hours before we ever get there and the Holy Spirit Works through them and it's put on the desk and we tell out what they've said here and if it doesn't happen right as it said it did happen then they cannot do that no more till that evil spirit is out of them now why does something have to be specific non-specific prophecy is dangerous so you have prophecy that's just somebody repeating something in scripture and they get up and they say they prophesy and it's it's read harmless because it's basically what a preacher would do right but it's out of place right but it's relatively harmless but then you have prophecies where it's specific or sort of specific right and so I know of a situation where two girls both thought they had to marry a preacher because a person spoke to their general area of the congregation and said uh you got to marry a preacher and and two girls both took that to heart now what do they do with that but if it was true but it was only meant for one of them prophecy has to be specific to not only specific in its nature but specific to a person that's why brother Brandon would say oh they're going to miss it Miss so and so right called them by name right if God can talk to your specific problem he can speak your name too all right right so now so again it's got to be specific does it glorify God God or the person speaking and we we could take that to Ministry too does the ministry glorify God or the person preaching does the prophecy glorify God or the person speaking what's the purpose of the prophecy is it to build a kingdom to build a church to promote a Ministry or is it to help the church 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity that's love I'm become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol oh I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I nothing so he said I'm going to show you a more excellent way a way that you can know whether things are right or not and that's when it's operated by love right and when it's operated by love it don't tear up the church don't tear up people's lives brother BR he taught us that now and and Paul taught us that now so we we must consider when we talk when we say and this goes for all of us when we say the Lord told me something if you ever tell your kids brother brandom said you know what you're telling that kid God said something because we believe God spoke through a prophet so you sit there and Hammer him over the head and say brother brandham said for you not to do that you better make sure brother Bram actually said that because I've been told some things we won't get into them this morning that brother brand said all my life and I can't find them so brother brandom said it doesn't always work and what you're putting the authority of a prophet behind something are you with me now so we must consider what the thing we are saying in the name of the Lord might do to the person who hears it we got to think before we tell say well I can't control it then it's not a you shouldn't you shouldn't be operating it then right it hasn't come to maturity in your life because the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophets there's many things that Jesus couldn't tell his disciples he says and I've used this to uh promote short sermons before but we won't use it that way this morning but this is in John 16:12 he said I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now you can see that how that would apply to a preacher but there's things that Jesus held back because they had not come to a place of maturity they could receive it and he said I see things that's coming up and you can't tell people he said you see different different things and you're forbidden them visions that they call on sometimes they'd be sorry if you did tell them and you know better than to do it yeah all right right it's not just being able to do something it's knowing when and how and and that goes for that goes for preachers and pastors and deacons doctors right first Do no harm right make sure you're mature enough to handle the message that you have and so he says I see these things and then visions that they call and sometimes they'd be sorry if you did tell them and you know better than to do it and you find out things about people that you wish you didn't know he said the people that desires these things to know these things they don't realize what type this type of ministry cost you don't know what goes with it he said then it throws into desperation Lord God I know I'm going to have to answer listen our preaching ought to be in desperation our prophecy our gifts whatever it is should be in desperation Lord I know I have to answer for what I say and I'd rather never speak than to speak something that would be wrong lastly does it edify the body Paul says I'd rather you use gifts that edify the body so he talks about unknown tongues that would be tongues and I believe in tongues I believe as Paul said I wish you all spoke with tongues I do speak in tongues I have brother brandham talked about it not something that happened all the time in his life but he spoke a several instances where he spoke in tongues and I have spoken tongues and I believe in it I I believe in it but it was not an interpretable tongue right it was a tongue that helped me because I believe the Lord was praying through me but I didn't know what it said right so he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church he said I would that you all spake with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying see what we're saying must edify the body therefore we must be sure when we're saying what we're saying that it's right because false prophecies destroy confidence in the body and so brother BR says God has set in the church God not the organization not the achievement of man to make Bishops and so forth presor but God set in the church first apostles that's missionary secondary prophets teachers pastors evangelists God set them in the church he said and every bugle will blow the same the same gospel see he said if he's a prophet he blows the bugle of a prophet so in God's five part if you can say it like this like a like a five piece Orchestra each one's playing a different instrument but each one's playing the same tune right and they compliment one another so if he's a prophet he blows the bugle of a prophet he foretells the things that is to come and hits every time so Brother brandom Talks to 12-year-old little girl my heart's to these young people today and and and also to all of us listen when a man tells you he stands it for God he's a preacher and he stands up here and preaches before you and then lives any kind of a life goes home and throws things cusses people out throws fits I've dealt with people for years because their fathers or their pastors did that kind of a thing and years later they're still scarred by that they don't know whether to listen to The Prophet or not they don't know whether they believe the message or not many times because of the way Dad acted because of the way the the pastor acted or whoever else it was in their life I say there's healing for that church how do you know where the been because I know I've been there I've questioned myself and I had to come to the realization that God did speak in our day and I'm going to believe that I'm going to believe in an open book I'm going to believe in a word that come to me that was true I'm going to stand on that somebody that represents God to you fails it shakes your confidence but look at those who haven't failed look at those who are preaching the truth look at those who do stand for the gospel and let that be a a reinforcement of your faith not just the man but the you believe that when they do speak that they speak sparingly they don't just say God said about everything but that you could have confidence if they did say it would be right God had a prophet we had a prophet in our day God sent a prophet behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen I I believe he's come he turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers brother Bram said he's talking to this 12-year-old little girl and she come to brother brandham and she brought him a dream and she come to me and she said why didn't you interpret my dream you know little kids have confidence in you and they believe that if you say let's have Youth Services you'll have youth services so we try to comply little kids have confidence how dare we abuse that these men you you just forgive me these men standing in prayer line speaking things to young people you better be sure you know what I speak to them most of the time when I'm praying up here you know what I'm going got you on a great Revelation you know when I'm praying for people and when I'm when they're coming through the prayer line and when I'm speaking to them you know what I speak to them most of the time in the name of Jesus because I know that's right in the name of Jesus lay my hands on him in the name of Jesus where do you get that from from a prophet it's what a prophet did when they come by him in the name not that you couldn't say anything else and even sometimes it'd be right listen church I'm not doing away with that God could speak in that way sure but let it be something that's right we got to make sure that it's right before we say it and and you that hear it take it back to the word and if the shoe Don't Fit Don't you wear that brother brandom said when you find a man that's got every interpretation just like this I got every just like that in the name of the Lord I said you be careful about that that's contrary to the scripture yes those gimmicks that's got every answer be careful he's talking to this 12-year-old girl when somebody stands up and speaks in the name of the Lord that must be true it must be exactly the truth he said you might in your mind be impressed I said now honey I believe I could tell you what I think your dream is but to tell you in the name of the Lord no sir I said have I ever spoke to you in the name of the Lord but what had happened I said thousands has come and said this that I cannot tell you what what your dream is till I see it over again and then he tells me then I can say the Lord told me until then I don't know look at the humility he had this is a major prophet he said I don't want to take listens important my own influence because a man has influence and when you say something you want to he says something you want to believe it because you have confidence in the man he said I don't want to take my own influence and my own opinion I can't say thus sayith the Lord because that's me thinking it that's best to my opinion he said we must be sincere because we've got the greatest thing in the world the greatest Treasure of Heaven is Christ Among Us do you believe that today Church why do we want a substitute of some little influence to try to make ourselves somebody big among somebody here why not be a humble servant to Christ so brother bandam uses the example now you kids listen 's the example of a crippled woman a Waterhead baby and a dead man so he says if I spoke to you and I told you you're going to go to the meeting and there's going to be a crippled woman and she'll be raised she she'll be able to walk and there's going to be a Waterhead baby and the head will instantly shrink down he said and there's going to be a man that dies in the congregation and will go back and pray for him he be raised from the dead he said now if I tell you those things he said and they happen you got confidence in it right he said and then I tell you he said so I tell you those three things about the meeting and then I tell you this he said your little brother is going to get run over by a truck but don't be afraid said he's he's not going to get he's going to get killed but don't be afraid right and you kids would hate to lose your sibling wouldn't you right you'd hate to well some of y'all would anyway he said don't be afraid right he said because I've already told you these things he said no I'm telling you your your little brother he just using this as an example he said but your little brother's going to raise from the dead he said then you could take that to the bank all right yes you believe it now now listen what he says about this he says now I said then if that taken place he said what if you went out there then of that woman arthritic whatever it was paralyzed woman wasn't there what if the Waterhead baby wasn't there right then you're all mixed up in your mind you don't know and I spoke to you and told you thus sayth the Lord I said then my influence is lost and you might need me sometime real bad I said but what if the woman is there oh Church you realiz what we have in this age what if the woman is there what if the Waterhead baby is healed what if the man is raised from the dead then if your little brother gets killed you wouldn't even cry you'd say Daddy let me have him I'm going to show you the glory of God he said why it was right here it was right there it was right there every time it's right then you know it's right I said that's the reason we want to believe the word of God now watch where he takes to he said that's the reason we want to believe the word of God he said everything someone say everything everything the Bible has ever spoke of the Bible says it here history says it happened I want you kids to have confidence in this book everything the Bible says it here the Bible said a virgin shall conceive and a virgin did conceive the Bible said there be four Gentile kingdoms and there were four Gentile King the Bible said it and we've seen it in history the Bible said there be seven Church agents we've seen seven Church agents the Bible said it and we've seen it happen amen oh what confidence that ought to give us today we've seen it here it was right there it was right there it was right now we can have confidence it's right brand said now we're at the time of the Rapture what else does the Bible say it speaks of future events it said in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump the dead in Christ shall rise why does it say that you got to have confidence in that you got to be able to believe that how can you believe it because the Bible was right about a virgin conceiving the Bible was the Bible was right about a flood coming and so you believe the Bible's right about the Rapture the Bible's right about oh the Bible's right about Malachi 4 the Bible's right about Revelation 10:7 how do we know because God manifested it he brought it to pass and we believe the same God who brought a prophet in our age the same God that did that same God that revealed his word to us and opened the book to us that same God will change our bodies one of these days it's a more sure word of Prophecy something we can hang our hat on brother BR said now at the time of the Rapture it's going to happen because it's been perfect every other time it's got to be perfect this time God is calling out a people see and it's the time we've got to be sincere he goes on to the same quote he says sometimes we find someone spoke in tongues the other wants to imitate him he'll speak in tongues too once he one give an interpretation the other one say I got it too and you go by Impressions and then say thus sayeth the Lord well that's wrong God Will Never Move you any further than what you are right now just an organization until you get out of that yes said be sure don't you say it unless God says so and you know that it is the truth that God said so not your opinion not some impression because you can be impressed anyway yeah all right can I have five more minutes I've got not been quite an hour Paul ends his teachings on gifts with this 1 Corinthians 13:8 charity never faileth but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which in part should be done away and I know people take that and say oh well praise the lord we can prophesy in part then wait for which is perfect but listen what brother Bram says about that again Paul continues on verse 11 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child I had a partial understanding when I become a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall know even as also I am known now brother brandom if you go early in his ministry he always interprets this as love that which is perfect is love and there's a truth to that because love is the Capstone right that's true that's that's the true thing but after the opening of the seals he he brings out a little bit more about it and he tells us that the that which is perfect is the perfect word the opening of the seals right and you go to questions and answers 1964 brother BR said 1 Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part should be done away with he say all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that was just perfect and we do have today if we had it then we've got it now by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child when I become a man I put away childish things I'm not I'm not trying to make something happen the gifts are the there but I don't have to make them happen you don't take a gift for me to have a good service I don't worship God cuz I feel like it I worship God cuz he's here Among Us and he deserves to be worshiped the feelings come the gifts come the things happen yes we praise God for that but that's not our emphasis in this hour that which is perfect has come he said that which is in part will be done away with then that which is perfect has come now this is three different places in questions and answers where he addresses this he says now I've got a question on that I hope to get it tonight listen about what happened when the seals opened something happened when the seals opened had to do with that which is perfect has come again he said please explain 1 Corinthians 13 8-12 the question now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled he said now I think I just went through that didn't I he said when that which is perfect has come that which is impartial should be done away with Paul said though I speak with tongue of men and angels do all these things here but when that was just perfect has come now is there anything perfect but God and we're almost done church can you say Amen to that there's nothing is perfect but God no sir he say it's God the perfect in the beginning was the the word right and the Word was with God and the Word was God he said the word still God hallelujah so that which was perfect is the word amen and the Word was God the word's still God all right when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with and and so I listen I have the opening of the word gifts are part of that but I don't have to manufacture gifts they'll come when God calls them to come when God makes them happen I I don't have to manufacture gifts to have a good I'll tell you this you ought to shout more for the opening of the word than you do for any gift because a gift could be wrong but the word is never wrong and the Pentecost is got to where they felt like that if somebody didn't speak in tongues they didn't have a good service and everybody was left mad ask me how I know right that's not what God has called us to we got something that lives with us we got something that goes over the opening of the word doesn't stop at church it goes with us to work it goes with us to school it goes with us to our homes it goes with us every every day he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you what is it it's Christ sir I don't have to manufacture gifts I believe they're there but God has G us something else to fight with right the Pentecostal age represented that again I'm quoting the prophet Pentecostal age represented that again but God has given us something now look as great as the second pole was right that was division right discernment the third poll brother brand said was much greater all right I look I said five minutes I've went over by zero minutes so far but look when David went out you remember when David went out to fight Goliath brother Joel told me something this morning I hope I'm not getting on your sermon tonight but he told me said when you go out to fight Goliath what was that huh leave it alone he saids but when you go out to fight Goliath someone say if you take a swing on the at the king you better not miss you know right you got to believe that that Goliath is is able to to fall right but now David went to fight Goliath now why was David why did David have to fight Goliath because Saul couldn't Saul was afraid right Saul represents the old Administration the denomination right Saul is the old Saul is what we would say the Pentecostal age or the lean age he's sitting there trembling right even though he's much bigger than David he got much better looking armor but now watch what Saul does Saul says okay David you're now the guy you've been anointed you can go fight him but put my armor on take the thing that I used to fight with you and David could have walked out with that armor on that old clunky armor and looked pretty good to the people but he didn't know how to fight with it because it's not what he was was given he represented something new that had come what was it the opening of the word are you with me now he had something that Saul didn't have you got something that Saul didn't have the Pentecostals didn't have that's why they had to get Saul out of order you got something it wasn't because they were bad people it's because they didn't know but you and I have an open book we've got something to fight with we got faith in the word of God so he said all I got to have is this sling because I know this worked for me before it worked for me with the lion it worked for me with the bear it worked for me with my sick children it worked for me and my family it worked and brought me out of Darkness it brought me out of leoda and I believe it'll work again take it to the test church every time in'll work it's he's always the same yesterday today and forever he does not change don't give up now you grab a hold of the sword of the word the slingshot God's giv you fight with it don't use yesterday's armor fight with the word this message is our protection musicians go ahead and come I'll just read this while you come BR said you can't manufacture salvation you can't manufacture the gifts you've got to Bear the gifts certainly see the Sheep doesn't he doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he's a sheep he just Bears wool the cherry tree doesn't manufacture cherries it just Bears cherries because the life of it that way and the Church of the God doesn't inject this to try to make themselves look like something they're already what they are by the grace of God and the word of God is joined with them and they're joined with the word you realize what's happened in this age of marriage between the bride and the word and the works that was brought forth in that perfect one Jesus Christ God manifest in flesh will produce itself through every Born Again believer he said so nothing else he said now that's something certain oh Church an hour of great uncertainty let's get back to the word let's go back to something certain an open book which is not just intellectual I defy that the teaching that the word is only intellectual the word is the but Jesus said my words are Spirit their life word has power to defeat every e every demon every evil in your life would you bow your heads with me we have a certain sound prepare yourself for Rapture make yourself ready a voice that cried out at midnight we don't need to go back to Saul's armor let God speak through his word getting us ready to leave this world if you're not ready this morning would you do that today how do I do that believe the word let the word produce an experience erience in your life we believe in the Holy Ghost experience we believe in the manifestation of worship and the gifts and all of those things but we don't believe in an uncertain sound we believe in a word that set things in order that lives and he wants to produce himself in your [Music] life I don't want to go [Music] back to uncertainty I don't want to go back to where men have control over my life I don't want to have control over your lives I want to preach the [Music] word let the chips fall where they may preach the word that don't mean there's no discipline in the church there has to be well we're not a body we're not a church we part of our job is to protect the church and help that don't mean there's no discipline but it just means it just means that it's not because it's not because because i' feel led or I had a vision or I had a dream no because we go by the word we go by the word and we try to we we Empower even the offices that we have are empowered by the word to do what they do so if a deacon asks you to do something you do it not because the man's a good man not because he's a Gifted Man but because he has an office of the word that God put in order the same thing with a with a pastor or something you should listen to your pastor you should listen to other men but always take get back to the word because he has a word office but he has to also speak the word do you love him this morning you love the word if you're not ready to meet him it's an uncertain [Music] time every time I go and I begin to pray and begin to talk to God say God it so much going on it it must be close I think about that song say count the years as months and the months as days and thank God it could be any day now some of you have been in this way for a long time you're Elders to me you've seen these things you know what I'm talking about I say hold on little church hold on little bride it won't be long you don't have to worry Don't Be Afraid trust in the word of God you don't have to be under some man tell you to do something not to do something you just believe God and if you've been hurt maybe you've been hurt by men you've been hurt by situations and I've known situations where men took their own lives CU they had false prophecy listen you don't have to listen to that you don't have to be bound by that you come to God you believe God God says you can be saved you can be saved you believe God no matter where you go to church or what you do you believe God's word and I trust that that you do this morning Heavenly Father Lord if there's one here that's never given their life to God I pray God that you'd help them today Lord if they've not completely surrendered your to your word I pray that you'd just move down Lord that you'd speak to them they'd be quick to be baptized in Christian baptism and and begin to do the things the word says and submit to the word Lord maybe there's people have been a hurt and they let that hurt become a lord a scab a scar the scar is never really healed it's still still right there it's right in their spirit I pray God that you just heal that [Music] today Lord I I don't want to be the cause of uncertainty I want to I want to preach certainty in the lives of people you are what the word says you are and if you go against the word you have to bear the the recompense of it but if you'll stay with the word follow the word and if you do something wrong repent of it quickly and Lord I believe that that kind of person can make it in a Rapture Lord that's me I Repent Lord of all anything I've done Lord would be wrong take it out of me Lord Lord if there's anything these people have done Lord we we repent oh God we want to be right Lord we offer our prayer for each one we want to stand in a place Lord where we can we can know with certainty we are your children we believe that today we love you and we thank you for it Lord I pray that there be no uncertainty in the gospel that we preach that you'd anoint these men that preach Lord with a certain sound Lord that we could declare the word of God I
