[44:07] foreign
[44:11] amen aren't you grateful for his Mercy
[44:14] today
[44:15] where would we be without the mercy and
[44:18] Grace of almighty God
[44:21] it's wonderful this morning hearing the
[44:23] wonderful the specials and the Psalms
[44:25] and the worship that was coming forth I
[44:27] I know our God loves our worship and he
[44:30] loves when we come and we give him
[44:32] everything that we have and I believe
[44:34] that that's ushers in his presence into
[44:37] this place and that's what we desire
[44:39] this morning because if he doesn't come
[44:42] then this is a meaningless Gathering
[44:45] but we have a word that says where two
[44:47] or three will gather in his name that
[44:49] he'll be there and I'm trusting in that
[44:52] this morning amen let's bow before him
[44:54] now talk to him our gracious Heavenly
[44:57] Father Lord we're just so thankful and
[45:00] humbled Lord to be in your presence
[45:02] Lord to once again be gathered with a
[45:04] portion of the purchase of your blood
[45:06] Lord not know that Within Myself
[45:09] Lord there's nothing that I can say Lord
[45:12] that would benefit these people that
[45:14] would free these people or help these
[45:16] people in any situation
[45:18] but Lord what I know is is that you've
[45:20] already provided for that situation that
[45:22] they're facing and for that sickness or
[45:23] that trial that they're in Lord that if
[45:26] you'll just come now and take control of
[45:28] the vessel take control of my mind my
[45:29] lips my thoughts
[45:31] Lord and that you'll Speak Lord that
[45:33] Words of Life can come forth Lord and
[45:36] deliverance can be in the house of God
[45:37] healing in the house of God's salvation
[45:39] in the house of God Lord because that's
[45:42] what your word brings Lord and we're
[45:43] looking to that and we're expecting that
[45:45] Lord we just invite you now to take
[45:47] complete control to bless the scriptures
[45:49] Lord anoint my lips and not only my lips
[45:52] Lord but every ear here to receive what
[45:54] you're saying Grant it now father we
[45:56] pray in Jesus name
[45:59] foreign
[46:02] musicians if you have your bibles if
[46:04] you'll be turning with me to Second
[46:06] Kings
[46:07] 25 and 9.
[46:10] I bring greetings this morning from from
[46:13] the home church and from my pastor
[46:15] brother Tim Pruitt there in Minden
[46:17] Louisiana and and
[46:19] he said to send his greetings and God
[46:21] bless you to the congregation and
[46:23] you know it's always good and and
[46:26] comfortable even to be amongst Believers
[46:29] because when you get amongst Believers
[46:31] what you'll find is a welcoming spirit
[46:33] and a welcoming presence but it also
[46:35] helps when those are people that you've
[46:37] known for a long time and that you have
[46:39] a lot of friends and I have a lot of
[46:42] friends here and I just I'm so happy to
[46:44] be back amongst you and and I got some
[46:46] home folks here with me this morning

[47:11] we're going to read just two verses
[47:12] there and we'll let you have your seats
[47:13] before we continue
[47:16] it says and he burnt the house of the
[47:19] Lord
[47:20] and the King's house and all the houses
[47:22] of Jerusalem and every great man's house
[47:26] burnt he with fire now what we're
[47:28] reading here
[47:30] is the account of the destruction of
[47:33] Jerusalem that that's taken place as
[47:36] Israel has been taken captive and
[47:37] they're being sent into Exile and and
[47:40] time after time they've risen up and
[47:41] rebelled against uh Babylon
[47:44] Nebuchadnezzar and those and finally
[47:45] he's had enough of it and he just comes
[47:47] in and wipes the whole place out this is
[47:49] the destruction of the walls and of the
[47:51] city and it says in all the army of the
[47:54] child Dees that were with the captain of
[47:56] the Guard Break Down The Walls of
[48:00] Jerusalem roundabout
[48:01] amen I pray the Lord alright his
[48:04] Blessing to this reading as you have
[48:05] your seats today
[48:10] how I was telling brother Joel there in
[48:12] the back that I I have a great love
[48:14] uh for the book of Nehemiah and the Book
[48:16] of Ezra and I spend a lot of time
[48:18] in my personal readings and things there
[48:20] in those books and that's where we're
[48:21] going to
[48:23] um to look at today we're going to spend
[48:25] a lot of time in Nehemiah the second
[48:26] chapter we'll be going through that a
[48:28] lot as we go and I'd like to speak to
[48:30] you for a moment today on on cold to
[48:32] finish the work called to finish the
[48:36] work and and Nehemiah two and one as we
[48:39] begin this it says and it came to pass
[48:41] in the month of Nisan in the 20th year
[48:44] of artist Xerxes the king that wine was
[48:46] before him and he took up the wine and
[48:49] gave it unto the king now I had not been
[48:52] Before Time sad in his presence you know
[48:55] if there's just a little something we
[48:56] can take even from that scripture I'd
[48:58] say there's no reason for us to ever be
[49:00] sad in the presence of God you know
[49:02] there's no reason for us to come in into
[49:04] the to the king's courts to do him
[49:06] service and sit there gloomy and sad but
[49:08] if there's ever been a people that had a
[49:10] reason to be happy and if there's ever
[49:12] been a people that has reason to Rejoice
[49:13] it's the people that have opportunity to
[49:16] be in the in the king's presence on a
[49:18] regular basis and and he says wherefore
[49:20] the king said unto me why is that
[49:22] counting it sad see thing that thou art
[49:24] not thick this is nothing else but
[49:26] sorrow of heart then I was very sore
[49:29] afraid and said unto the king let the
[49:31] King live forever why should not my
[49:34] countenance be sad when the city the
[49:36] place of my father's sepulchers lieth
[49:38] waste and the gates thereof are consumed
[49:41] with fire then the king said unto me for
[49:43] what Dost thou make request so I pray to
[49:46] the god of heaven and I said unto the
[49:49] king if it pleased the king and If thy
[49:51] servant hath found favor in thy sight
[49:53] that thou would Ascend me unto Judah
[49:55] unto the city of my father's sepulchers
[49:58] that I may build it and the King said
[50:00] unto me the queen also sitting by him
[50:02] for how long shall thy journey be and
[50:06] when wilt thou return so so it pleased
[50:10] the king descend me and I set him a time
[50:13] moreover I said unto the king if it
[50:15] pleased the king let letters be given to
[50:17] me to the governors beyond the river
[50:19] that they may convey me over until I
[50:22] come into Judah in a letter unto ASAP
[50:25] The Keeper of the king's Forest that he
[50:27] may give me Timber to make beams for the
[50:30] gates of the palace which appertained to
[50:32] the house for all for the wall of the
[50:35] city and for the house that I shall
[50:37] enter into and the King granted me
[50:40] according to the good hand of my God
[50:43] upon me now I like there back in verse
[50:46] six I love how the king is concerned
[50:49] about the details of this journey you
[50:52] know he doesn't just say to him you know
[50:53] what just go ahead and go back and I
[50:55] hope it works out in your favor good
[50:57] luck in this but what he shows is a
[50:59] great concern and a great care and he
[51:02] says how long is this going to take you
[51:04] and when are you planning to return and
[51:06] the reason that he wants to know how
[51:07] long and the reason he wants to know
[51:09] when he's going to return is because he
[51:11] plans to provide for him for as long as
[51:14] it takes he plans to give him the
[51:16] provisions that he needs to finish the
[51:19] job listen he didn't just send you on a
[51:21] journey down here and say good luck to
[51:23] you let me know how it works out but the
[51:26] King has provided everything you have
[51:28] need of the fact that we're still here
[51:30] in 2023 does not Shock him because he
[51:33] knew how long the journey would be and
[51:35] he said I'm going to provide for you I'm
[51:37] not just sending you but I'm equipping
[51:39] you you're gonna finish this work he's
[51:42] not just sending you haphazardly but
[51:44] he's sending you equipped for the job
[51:46] he's sending you with the provisions
[51:48] that you need wherever you find yourself
[51:52] at today I want you to know the King has
[51:54] already provided for the situation
[51:56] you're in for the battle that you are
[51:58] facing and then what I love about it is
[52:00] he takes it another step he doesn't just
[52:03] make it to where you have to take
[52:04] nehemiah's word for it but he puts it in
[52:07] writing there's a king seal that goes
[52:09] with this commission he doesn't know
[52:11] people you don't they don't have to just
[52:12] take your word for it he put it in
[52:14] writing he said there would be somebody
[52:16] that was going to overcome he said I'll
[52:18] have a bride without spot or wrinkle he
[52:21] put it in writing today so there's no
[52:23] question about it I didn't just say God
[52:25] sent a prophet he put it in writing he
[52:28] said I'll send you Elijah the prophet he
[52:31] put these things in writing
[52:33] verse 9 it says then I came to the
[52:36] governor's beyond the river
[52:37] and gave them the king's letters
[52:40] now the king had sent captains of the
[52:42] army and Horsemen with me I love this
[52:46] too because listen he don't send you
[52:47] unprotected if you could see this
[52:50] morning there's angels on every aisle
[52:52] there's angels that travel with you
[52:54] there's angels that go before you there
[52:56] are Angel armies around the Bride of
[52:58] Jesus Christ those the angels of the
[53:00] Lord encamped about those that fear Him
[53:02] you are protected people this morning
[53:05] you haven't been sent unequipped you
[53:07] haven't been sent unprotected the devil
[53:10] wants to bring fear and anxiety and
[53:12] worry and I'm telling you the King has
[53:14] sent his Horsemen with you this morning
[53:16] the King has come to protect you to
[53:19] provide to see you through listen I'm so
[53:22] thankful we've been brought out but it
[53:24] wasn't just a bringing out there's going
[53:26] to be a taking in and he's made sure
[53:28] that he's done everything he has to do
[53:30] to get us to the taking end
[53:34] thank you
[53:36] verse 10
[53:38] when send ballot the horror night and
[53:40] tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of
[53:43] it it grieved them exceedingly that
[53:46] there was come a man to seek the welfare
[53:50] of the children of Israel
[53:52] you ain't that just like the devil he
[53:54] doesn't like it when the welfare of the
[53:56] children of God is being attended to
[53:59] let God begin to move in a service
[54:02] but the Holy Ghost begin to move in the
[54:04] spirit of God to begin to deal with
[54:06] needs in the body and and let the spirit
[54:08] of God begin to manifest itself in the
[54:10] people and the devil began to get really
[54:13] upset with those people and really upset
[54:15] and the devil will begin to to to come
[54:17] and why is he getting upset because the
[54:20] spirit of God is there to attend to your
[54:21] needs and all of a sudden it's not so
[54:23] easy for him to Rob your joy it's not so
[54:26] easy for him to Rob your peace all of a
[54:28] sudden somebody is there attending to
[54:30] the needs of the people and it upsets
[54:33] the enemy it upsets him when you rise up
[54:36] to take back your peace it upsets him
[54:38] when you claim your family it upsets him
[54:40] when you claim your healing what are
[54:42] these people who do they think they are
[54:44] who do they why do they think they can
[54:46] do this because the king put it in
[54:48] writing I have it right here I have a
[54:51] right to my joy I have a right to my
[54:53] peace I have a right to my healing yes
[54:55] and the King has come to see to the
[54:58] needs of his people
[55:01] it grieved them that one came to see
[55:03] about the welfare of Israel
[55:09] I'm so thankful that in this day
[55:12] the king didn't leave us alone
[55:14] but in this day the mighty angel came
[55:17] down to see about the welfare of his
[55:19] children
[55:20] to check the condition of the walls to
[55:23] see what was being done to protect the
[55:25] people from the enemy to see that the
[55:27] word was being properly placed to see
[55:30] that it was put in the right place that
[55:32] it would still defeat the Devil any
[55:34] place at any time under any situation to
[55:37] make sure that the wall was just how it
[55:39] was when Paul preached it to make sure
[55:42] that the wall was restored to how it was
[55:44] and the devil didn't like that a message
[55:47] came to check on the welfare of God's
[55:49] people
[55:50] he didn't like that that a message came
[55:52] to restore what he had spent so much
[55:55] time tearing down
[55:58] and Nehemiah finds that
[56:01] there's great work to be done
[56:04] he finds that the walls have been
[56:05] completely destroyed just as we read
[56:07] there in our opening scripture
[56:09] and now those that are trying to make
[56:11] their home in Jerusalem
[56:13] trying to make their home in the
[56:15] Homeland
[56:16] for us the homeland of the word
[56:19] they're not protected properly
[56:21] there's breeches in the wall there's
[56:23] holes in the wall they're open to attack
[56:26] they're at the mercy of those that hate
[56:28] them
[56:30] and these people try to raise a crop but
[56:33] the enemy just comes in and steals the
[56:35] Harvest yeah
[56:36] they try to be fruitful but their fields
[56:39] are trampled down constantly by the
[56:41] enemy
[56:42] we know that the church would try to
[56:44] rise up and accept truth but they would
[56:45] be struck down by the false Vine as they
[56:48] began to teach the rulership of man the
[56:50] control over the people spiritual power
[56:53] taken away from the from the laity and
[56:55] placed only upon on an ungodly
[56:58] priesthood and they begin to take the
[57:00] the moving of the spirit was was
[57:02] stripped out of the services
[57:05] and then the people become victim of
[57:07] that Catholic system and her false
[57:09] doctrines and and they would use these
[57:11] false doctrines to beat down the people
[57:12] and beat down the church and brother
[57:14] Branham would even see it in a dream as
[57:17] he would they would have a Triune club
[57:19] that the man would beat the woman with
[57:21] and he says every time she started to
[57:24] rise up and he says that means the
[57:26] congregation began to accept truth he
[57:29] would drive her right down again with
[57:32] false Doctrine
[57:34] so what Nehemiah finds is that that
[57:36] there are still Stones there
[57:39] but they've been all jumbled up yeah
[57:41] they've been all misplaced they've been
[57:44] piled over here and some buried and some
[57:46] torn down and some set on fire and and
[57:48] some destroyed there was pieces of a
[57:50] wall here there was pieces of Truth
[57:52] scattered over there but with so many
[57:55] breaches in it
[57:56] so many breaches in it that the devil
[57:58] could just come and go as he pleased
[58:00] that he had control over the people
[58:02] instead of a people that are completely
[58:04] set free in that Liberty and protected
[58:06] listen God has called this people to be
[58:08] a free people not bound by depression
[58:11] not bound by anxiety not bound by the
[58:13] fear of what's going on in the world
[58:15] that's not what you've been called for
[58:17] and in This Day He restored your wall of
[58:19] protection He restored the Tower of
[58:22] Refuge you can have peace in this day
[58:24] because he came to attend to the needs
[58:27] of his people
[58:30] and he finds that the walls have been
[58:32] demolished and the stones are heaped up
[58:34] and burned to make sure that it would be
[58:36] very difficult
[58:38] for it to ever be rebuilt again
[58:41] you know that's just how the devil
[58:42] operates he doesn't just want to see you
[58:44] fall
[58:45] he doesn't just want to see you fail but
[58:48] he wants to come in and Scar you and
[58:50] smut you up in the mud of the world and
[58:52] he spend so much time working on you to
[58:55] where he thinks that one right there can
[58:56] never be rebuilt again oh that one right
[58:59] there can never be restored again I
[59:00] spent 30 years ruining their life I had
[59:03] them jumbled up I had them piled up I
[59:06] had them in drugs I had them in alcohol
[59:07] I had them with a lust spirit I had them
[59:09] with the pornography Spirit I've got
[59:11] them depressed that cycle right there
[59:13] follows that family time after time
[59:15] after time but there was a king that
[59:18] said I will restore he said I will
[59:20] restore and he put it in writing in One
[59:22] Moment One Moment In The Presence of
[59:25] that King can undo 30 years of what the
[59:27] enemy has done 40 Years of what the
[59:29] enemy has done listen he spent a lot of
[59:31] time into my life but One Moment In The
[59:34] Presence of the king he put a lot of
[59:36] time in the woman at the whale's life
[59:37] but One Moment In The Presence of the
[59:40] king he put a lot of time tearing up
[59:42] legion's life but one moment with Jesus
[59:46] and all of that was changed all of that
[59:48] was done away with all of that was gone
[59:51] and there was a restoration that took
[59:53] place
[59:54] all the time
[59:57] in one moment
[59:59] in the presence of the king it can be
[1:00:01] restored
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:05] so Nehemiah looks at the rubble
[1:00:08] what once was mighty
[1:00:11] what once was a fortress
[1:00:14] what once was a refuge and a strong
[1:00:16] tower
[1:00:17] and he says this wall must be restored
[1:00:20] this wall must be built back because a
[1:00:22] city with Broken Walls reveals the
[1:00:25] defeated people
[1:00:27] a city with torn down walls reveals the
[1:00:29] defeated people of people who are
[1:00:31] vulnerable
[1:00:32] in a church with partial word and some
[1:00:35] truth cannot withstand the enemy
[1:00:39] the first age had left its first love
[1:00:41] and it began its Decline and it soon it
[1:00:43] found itself going into Exile just like
[1:00:45] the children of Israel had done
[1:00:47] but that didn't satisfy the enemy yeah
[1:00:50] he didn't just want him to fade away
[1:00:51] from their first love a little bit he
[1:00:53] wanted to make the gospel unrecognizable
[1:00:57] he wanted to make it impossible to be
[1:00:59] rebuilt
[1:01:01] to have it rebuilt back to where it was
[1:01:03] in the first age when Paul first
[1:01:05] preached it
[1:01:06] so he goes to work dismantling the word
[1:01:09] Peace by peace and once that false mind
[1:01:12] was in control it began to crush the
[1:01:14] life out of the church yeah the True
[1:01:17] Vine tried to stand up but the power of
[1:01:19] the false Vine being backed up by the
[1:01:21] state is what brother Brown would say
[1:01:23] they're in the church age book
[1:01:25] backed up with the power of the state
[1:01:27] would beat it back down again Time After
[1:01:29] Time After Time and so the word is
[1:01:32] stripped down and torn down and mangled
[1:01:34] up and heaped up and and true baptism
[1:01:36] has done away with and false baptism is
[1:01:39] put in its place the mystery of the
[1:01:41] godhead is torn down and heaped up and
[1:01:43] jumbled up and then put over there and
[1:01:45] burned and hidden surely that'll never
[1:01:47] be restored and they began to teach the
[1:01:50] intercession of saints and and praying
[1:01:52] to the dead becomes normalized and
[1:01:54] Purgatory begins to be told and and
[1:01:57] worship begins to be formalized right
[1:02:00] now sometimes that's one of the attacks
[1:02:01] that we don't focus on enough but if you
[1:02:03] will go back and look at the first
[1:02:04] church age enough it was the key attack
[1:02:07] that caused the falling away from what
[1:02:10] they had on the day of Pentecost to
[1:02:12] where only 30 years later Jude is saying
[1:02:14] Brothers we must contend for the faith
[1:02:17] that was once delivered they've already
[1:02:19] slid they've already fallen they've
[1:02:21] already strayed and brother Branham
[1:02:23] begins to point to the doctrine of the
[1:02:24] Nicolaitans and he begins to point to
[1:02:26] nicolaitanism and to where he says the
[1:02:29] spirit was taken from the congregation
[1:02:31] and placed upon an Unholy priesthood and
[1:02:34] formal and cold worship began to be
[1:02:36] accepted in the church I'm telling you
[1:02:39] that's something that has the Bride of
[1:02:40] Jesus Christ we should never stand for
[1:02:43] is cold and formal Worship in the house
[1:02:46] of God you say but the word has been
[1:02:48] restored it's the word it's the word
[1:02:50] that's what we're excited about that's
[1:02:52] why I'm excited that's why I shout I
[1:02:55] don't care how good you can play the
[1:02:57] piano and sing that's not what gets me
[1:02:59] excited this right here gets me excited
[1:03:03] this makes me shout I'm thankful for the
[1:03:06] restoration of the word in this day it
[1:03:09] excites us so we can worship freely
[1:03:13] come on
[1:03:14] but those things began to be stripped
[1:03:17] away from the church yes
[1:03:20] the Supernatural is buried underneath
[1:03:22] Creeds and dogmas
[1:03:24] an ungodly priesthood is set up
[1:03:27] and they make it to where the word isn't
[1:03:29] even available to be read
[1:03:31] by the common people
[1:03:33] so that wall that used to be their
[1:03:35] protection is no longer even available
[1:03:36] to
[1:03:38] that wall that used to protect I mean
[1:03:40] got them they can't even have it in
[1:03:41] their language anymore
[1:03:45] all they have is misplaced stones
[1:03:47] misplaced Rubble a portion of Truth here
[1:03:50] a piece here
[1:03:52] it's where it looked just like the walls
[1:03:54] at Jerusalem
[1:03:56] but Nehemiah was commissioned rebuild it
[1:04:00] and there was a word from the King that
[1:04:02] said I will restore saith the Lord
[1:04:07] the word will once again protect the
[1:04:11] word will once again heal the word will
[1:04:13] once again deliver the word once again
[1:04:15] will be a fortress it once again will be
[1:04:18] a refuge the word once again will be the
[1:04:20] armor that you can put on and it won't
[1:04:22] just be a partial armor it won't just be
[1:04:25] a piece of armor but it's going to be
[1:04:26] the full armor of God restored in this
[1:04:30] day and he says I will pour out my
[1:04:32] spirit on All Flesh he looks down he
[1:04:35] says I started my church the way I
[1:04:37] wanted it and now I want my church the
[1:04:39] way I started it listen he started his
[1:04:42] church the way he wanted who are we to
[1:04:44] say how it's supposed to be well how do
[1:04:46] you think the church ought to be brother
[1:04:47] Branham says that there is only one
[1:04:49] pattern for how the church is to be and
[1:04:51] he says that's the book of that the
[1:04:53] church at the beginning he said that's
[1:04:55] how I want my church that's how I
[1:04:57] started it that's how I want it to
[1:04:58] finish so I say Lord if I ain't lining
[1:05:01] up to it if we ain't operating that way
[1:05:03] help me Lord let me be willing to repent
[1:05:05] and say I've been wrong this is the
[1:05:07] pattern let's get back to the word and
[1:05:11] what the word pattern says it's supposed
[1:05:13] to be
[1:05:17] and not to Discount in any way the moves
[1:05:19] of Luther and Wesley and Azusa
[1:05:22] I was removes of God
[1:05:25] absolute moves of God but but they
[1:05:28] didn't fully restore the wall
[1:05:31] they didn't bring the gospel back to the
[1:05:33] way Paul preached it it wasn't a full
[1:05:36] restoration but what they did do was
[1:05:37] uncovered some great stones
[1:05:39] they uncovered some great stones that
[1:05:42] needed to be put back in the wall
[1:05:43] justification was dug out from
[1:05:45] underneath that Rubble oh that just
[1:05:47] shall live by faith there's a stone
[1:05:49] right there oh and then sanctification
[1:05:51] came out from the rubble there's another
[1:05:53] Stone I know where that one's supposed
[1:05:54] to be placed and then the gifts and
[1:05:56] things like that began to be placed back
[1:05:59] in the walls and now but the problem
[1:06:01] with this was is there was still liens
[1:06:03] against the church
[1:06:06] they were still Bound by false baptisms
[1:06:09] they were still held by Creeds and
[1:06:11] dogmas and man's ideas now but what you
[1:06:14] began to see was there's a foundation
[1:06:16] I can see where the wall used to be I I
[1:06:19] can see where it had once been torn down
[1:06:21] and now it's starting to come up a
[1:06:22] little bit you can tell where things had
[1:06:25] once been but you needed somebody with
[1:06:28] the commission from a king
[1:06:29] you needed somebody who had spoke to the
[1:06:31] angel you needed someone not afraid of
[1:06:34] the corrupt systems you needed someone
[1:06:36] that was from outside of the
[1:06:38] establishments we needed someone with
[1:06:41] the saith the Lord that could come back
[1:06:43] and go this Stone goes here and this
[1:06:45] Stone goes here and this don't hear and
[1:06:48] the wall got higher and the wall got
[1:06:50] stronger and the wall got thicker and I
[1:06:52] got safer and I got free and I got
[1:06:55] healed and I got saved and I got filled
[1:06:57] with the Holy Ghost because the wall was
[1:07:00] being placed in its proper place
[1:07:03] we needed someone who could go out and
[1:07:05] face the Giants of formalism
[1:07:07] who could face the Giants of
[1:07:09] denominations who could face those
[1:07:11] saying the days a miracle was passed
[1:07:13] someone who would take Hebrews 13 8 and
[1:07:16] it wouldn't just be a slogan but it
[1:07:18] would be demonstrated before the people
[1:07:20] that our God is the same yesterday today
[1:07:24] and forever you know I'll never
[1:07:26] understand people that claim to believe
[1:07:28] the message and yet don't believe in the
[1:07:30] Supernatural when the most Supernatural
[1:07:33] message that ever struck the face of the
[1:07:36] Earth you're not reading what I'm
[1:07:37] reading you're not seeing what I'm
[1:07:39] seeing you're not feeling what I'm
[1:07:41] feeling because it is Supernatural
[1:07:43] through and through and through
[1:07:46] the very theme of the message is about a
[1:07:49] supernatural God
[1:07:55] we had to have someone who would stay
[1:07:57] faithful even whenever turned their back
[1:07:59] on him
[1:08:03] even when those benefiting from the gaps
[1:08:05] in the wall told him leave those gaps
[1:08:06] alone
[1:08:08] no no no don't deal with that Gap
[1:08:11] don't deal with that the rest of the
[1:08:12] wall is good but don't hit on that right
[1:08:14] there
[1:08:15] don't mess with that Doctrine
[1:08:17] no no no no leave that alone but this
[1:08:19] man had a commission from the King
[1:08:21] not a commission from a man
[1:08:24] brother Branham says in the church age
[1:08:26] book though he will not be popular
[1:08:28] he will be Vindicated by God
[1:08:30] as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy
[1:08:33] Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well
[1:08:36] expect this man will be first of all
[1:08:38] authenticated by the spirit working in
[1:08:41] his life in Acts of power that are
[1:08:44] indisputable and found nowhere else
[1:08:48] what did we find with Nehemiah Not only
[1:08:50] was he sent but he was equipped
[1:08:52] he was commissioned he was provided for
[1:08:55] and he was Vindicated Beyond debate
[1:09:00] you know I was I was talking to brother
[1:09:01] Jackson on the way up here and I said
[1:09:03] you know
[1:09:05] I understand it elect and non-elect and
[1:09:07] people can't see things and and I
[1:09:10] understand
[1:09:11] but in this day
[1:09:13] to to be falling away now I look around
[1:09:15] I say each and every day to me William
[1:09:18] Branham has Vindicated more than he ever
[1:09:20] was before
[1:09:21] every single day to me as we go into
[1:09:24] this Insanity as we push further into
[1:09:27] this Darkness some people are going well
[1:09:29] it hadn't happened this and they're
[1:09:30] falling away and each and every day I'm
[1:09:32] looking around going it's exponentially
[1:09:34] greater than it was yesterday and it's
[1:09:36] exponentially greater than it was the
[1:09:38] day before like every the farther I go
[1:09:41] the more sure I am this man was Elijah
[1:09:45] of Malachi 4 this man was the one sent
[1:09:47] to open the Mysteries this man was the
[1:09:49] sent to point us back to the faith of
[1:09:51] the fathers this was the one commission
[1:09:54] from the angel of the Lord to rebuild
[1:09:57] the walls this was the one I have no
[1:10:00] doubts I have no questions I have no
[1:10:02] shame to stand up and say I believe that
[1:10:05] William Branham was the prophet to this
[1:10:07] age a star in the hand of God
[1:10:09] Hallelujah
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:14] and God came to see about the welfare of
[1:10:17] his people
[1:10:19] God came to close up the breaches
[1:10:21] God came to pick up the stones and put
[1:10:24] them back in place to close the gaps
[1:10:27] and the enemy hated it
[1:10:30] then they hated the messenger
[1:10:32] because he dared to seek the welfare of
[1:10:35] God's children instead of go with the
[1:10:37] status quo of religion
[1:10:39] instead of following in with their
[1:10:41] denomination instead of falling in with
[1:10:43] their group listen if I want to be
[1:10:45] guilty of choosing sides
[1:10:46] I want you sides with the word
[1:10:50] if I ever end up standing against
[1:10:52] somebody I'm not standing against
[1:10:53] anybody I'm just making sure I'm
[1:10:54] standing with the word I want to be
[1:10:57] found standing on the side of the word
[1:10:59] in every situation
[1:11:02] Nehemiah 2 10.
[1:11:05] when sand ballot the horror night
[1:11:08] and tobiah the servant of the ammonite
[1:11:10] heard of it it grieved them
[1:11:12] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[1:11:16] seek the welfare of the children of
[1:11:18] Israel
[1:11:19] but the same thing that grieved them
[1:11:22] exceedingly
[1:11:23] brought me great joy the same thing that
[1:11:26] brought them great sorrow brought me
[1:11:27] deliverance and it brought me healing
[1:11:29] and it brought me hope and it brought me
[1:11:31] a restored family let me stop for just a
[1:11:34] second and give you a testimony because
[1:11:35] there's times in our life when we think
[1:11:37] it's beyond hope there's no way this
[1:11:39] could ever be done my son will never
[1:11:41] come back my daughter will never return
[1:11:43] I could never have the Holy Ghost this
[1:11:45] marriage can never be fixed I grew up in
[1:11:48] a dysfunctional home
[1:11:50] yeah I grew up in a home where my mom
[1:11:52] and dad did not love each other
[1:11:55] the majority of my life I can't remember
[1:11:57] them in the same room
[1:12:00] separate homes even it's where when I
[1:12:02] was 17 they finally divorced 19 and 99.
[1:12:09] my dad was diagnosed with cancer not too
[1:12:11] long ago put on hospice care some things
[1:12:13] you look at is awful and I look and say
[1:12:15] all things work together to the good of
[1:12:17] them that love the Lord
[1:12:19] and the other day I'm at home and all of
[1:12:21] a sudden brother Tim sends me a picture
[1:12:23] you know what I'm fixing to look it up
[1:12:25] this might be a little bit different but
[1:12:26] that's okay give me a second you bear
[1:12:28] with me my dad says brother Tim sends me
[1:12:30] a picture and I know you can't see this
[1:12:33] but it's my dad laying in a hospital bed
[1:12:36] and my mom's sitting next to him holding
[1:12:38] his hand
[1:12:40] and he says this is their wedding
[1:12:42] picture
[1:12:44] they just renewed their vows
[1:12:47] let me tell you something you don't know
[1:12:48] about miracles until you've seen this
[1:12:50] one
[1:12:51] you don't know about miracles till
[1:12:52] you've seen this one he said I will
[1:12:54] restore saith the Lord listen it got to
[1:12:59] the point to my shame it wasn't even
[1:13:00] something I prayed for anymore he was
[1:13:03] beyond hope it was finished it was done
[1:13:05] but he said no sir One Moment In The
[1:13:09] Presence of the king nothing is beyond
[1:13:11] hope I will restore the same message
[1:13:14] that brings confusion and anger the song
[1:13:17] brings me joy and restoration and peace
[1:13:23] poet Grieves Sam batlet and it grieved
[1:13:26] tobiah
[1:13:29] what did it do for the people
[1:13:40] 218 Nehemiah 218.
[1:13:43] then I told them of the hand of my God
[1:13:46] which was good upon me
[1:13:49] as also the king's words that he had
[1:13:51] spoken unto me
[1:13:52] and they said let us
[1:13:56] that's us
[1:13:57] let us rise up and build so they
[1:14:01] strengthen their hands for this good
[1:14:04] work the message that made tobiah and
[1:14:09] those angry and send ballot angry but to
[1:14:11] the people who it was for they said let
[1:14:14] us rise up let us begin to work let us
[1:14:17] take this with our own hands it wasn't
[1:14:19] just recognizing you're right Nehemiah
[1:14:21] that wall is torn down
[1:14:23] you're right there's gaps in it you're
[1:14:26] right there needed to be a prophet
[1:14:27] you're right this message is true it
[1:14:30] wasn't just that it was let us put our
[1:14:32] hands to the work let us begin to do the
[1:14:35] work let us rise up against our enemy
[1:14:37] let us go out to war let us conquer let
[1:14:40] us do our part let us overcome let me
[1:14:43] lay my hands on the sick can they be
[1:14:45] delivered let me witness to somebody let
[1:14:47] me beat the devil down today let me be
[1:14:49] an overcomer let me put my hands to the
[1:14:53] work of the Lord
[1:14:56] good
[1:14:58] to others maybe it was silly
[1:15:00] to others maybe that religion was fine
[1:15:02] yeah
[1:15:04] to others those things were for a for a
[1:15:06] day gone by to others the the
[1:15:08] restoration wasn't necessary but to an
[1:15:11] elect people
[1:15:13] to a people called to it for people who
[1:15:16] called for this moment called for a
[1:15:18] restoration
[1:15:19] it was a call for them to rise up out of
[1:15:22] the ashes they stole my crops but they
[1:15:24] won't do it no more they trampled my
[1:15:26] Fields but they won't do it no more
[1:15:28] they're taking my children but I'm
[1:15:30] taking them back they're taking the joy
[1:15:31] out of my home but I'm claiming it back
[1:15:33] I'm gonna rise up out of the ashes and
[1:15:35] I'm gonna do my part to restore
[1:15:38] Jerusalem
[1:15:39] listen it wasn't just it wasn't just a
[1:15:42] prophet coming and saying here this
[1:15:45] truth is a stone and placing it there
[1:15:47] and this truth is a stone and placing it
[1:15:49] there it's even more than people called
[1:15:51] to the restoration work but it's
[1:15:54] recognizing that you as a people are the
[1:15:57] restoration work it's recognizing that
[1:16:00] the master builder looked and he said
[1:16:01] there's a stone and that elect seed not
[1:16:04] on the inside of you matched up
[1:16:05] perfectly with a restored word and he
[1:16:07] said you go right there and you go right
[1:16:11] there and you go there and you go there
[1:16:12] this is your place you are a portion of
[1:16:16] the restored work you are the restored
[1:16:18] Church you are here in this last day as
[1:16:21] a testimony of the restoration of
[1:16:24] almighty God you for A Mighty Fortress
[1:16:26] you're a stone in the wall today
[1:16:32] yes sir why did some catch the vision to
[1:16:33] build
[1:16:34] if we had time to go into it you would
[1:16:36] find that
[1:16:37] so many had been carried away into
[1:16:39] Babylon
[1:16:41] and when this call Goes Forth very very
[1:16:43] few returns
[1:16:45] too many got caught up in the Comforts
[1:16:47] of Babylon
[1:16:48] they didn't see a need to go back
[1:16:51] they didn't see a need to leave
[1:16:52] denominations
[1:16:54] they didn't see that knee they were
[1:16:55] comfortable where they were
[1:16:57] but some felt an urge to go back yeah
[1:17:00] what was drawn them back why did it have
[1:17:02] to be restored
[1:17:04] because Jeremiah prophesied that they
[1:17:06] would return back to the land of their
[1:17:08] fathers
[1:17:09] Jeremiah 29 10 says for thus saith the
[1:17:11] Lord
[1:17:12] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:17:16] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[1:17:18] good word toward you in causing you to
[1:17:20] return to this place
[1:17:22] to the land of Abraham
[1:17:24] to the land of Isaac into the land of
[1:17:27] Jacob and this is the exact same thing
[1:17:30] in a spiritual that's prophesied there
[1:17:31] in Malachi concerning the church he
[1:17:34] prophesied that one's going to come
[1:17:35] that's going to turn your hearts back to
[1:17:37] the faith or the land of Paul of Peter
[1:17:41] and of Stephen and some people heard the
[1:17:44] call and they said no I'm good right
[1:17:45] where I'm at but others said no that's
[1:17:47] my land there's a reason I gotta go back
[1:17:50] there's a reason I got to go back there
[1:17:52] that Wall's got to be restored that
[1:17:54] City's got to be restored the New
[1:17:56] Jerusalem has got to be built oh come on
[1:17:59] somebody drew why did Jerusalem have to
[1:18:01] be rebuilt why did the wall have to be
[1:18:03] rebuilt there was a messiah coming there
[1:18:06] was a messiah coming why did you have to
[1:18:08] be restored why did Jerusalem have to be
[1:18:11] rebuilt in this day there's a messiah
[1:18:14] coming somebody's got to be ready to
[1:18:17] receive him oh he was going to ride down
[1:18:19] the streets of Jerusalem he was going to
[1:18:21] be tried in Jerusalem it had to be
[1:18:23] restored yes sir you had to be restored
[1:18:27] in this day he's coming back for
[1:18:29] somebody it's a restored people it's a
[1:18:32] people who have returned to rebuild and
[1:18:35] finish the work in this day
[1:18:37] Hallelujah
[1:18:45] the message
[1:18:47] called the people to finish the work
[1:18:49] yeah right a people
[1:18:53] now this isn't to indicate
[1:18:56] that brother Branham didn't finish his
[1:18:58] work
[1:18:59] we aren't looking for somebody to finish
[1:19:00] the message
[1:19:02] that's not the boat I'm getting in
[1:19:05] now that ain't my ship
[1:19:07] I promise you yeah we're not looking for
[1:19:09] that
[1:19:10] he ran his race yeah he finished strong
[1:19:14] he finished his course he played his
[1:19:16] part
[1:19:17] but the work didn't finish well how do
[1:19:19] you know that
[1:19:20] we're still here
[1:19:23] if we're still here then there's still
[1:19:25] work that must be done
[1:19:27] there's still seed that must be found
[1:19:30] they're still demons that will be
[1:19:32] conquered
[1:19:33] every demon will be under our feet
[1:19:37] every demon will be conquered I don't
[1:19:39] even know why I'm saying this but we
[1:19:41] think about it sometimes and we look at
[1:19:42] some of the ones that are the most
[1:19:43] despicable
[1:19:44] the most filthy in our eyes the most
[1:19:47] vile Sinners with spirits that we look
[1:19:49] at today
[1:19:51] that disgust us and turn
[1:19:53] our stomachs
[1:19:55] and we want no part of that
[1:19:57] matter of fact we don't want it sitting
[1:19:59] in our church in a sense of letting that
[1:20:02] Spirit remain on that person because
[1:20:04] then you become the cage of every
[1:20:05] unclean and hateful thing we don't mind
[1:20:08] them coming in the door as long as
[1:20:09] they're ready to change
[1:20:11] amen but what's my point
[1:20:13] if every demon is going to be conquered
[1:20:16] somebody's gonna have to face that demon
[1:20:20] that means somebody's going to be
[1:20:21] delivered of that spirit
[1:20:23] there's going to be homosexuals
[1:20:24] delivered
[1:20:27] there's going to be transgenders and all
[1:20:29] those others LBG barbecue letters
[1:20:33] that I
[1:20:34] the list has gotten so long it's
[1:20:36] basically the alphabet now
[1:20:39] there's going to be those people
[1:20:40] delivered
[1:20:43] so let's quit looking at them and you
[1:20:45] know what I what I see obviously I don't
[1:20:47] I ain't trying to hang out
[1:20:49] I'm not saying that but what I'm saying
[1:20:51] is I look at that as a potential victory
[1:20:53] God can say that one God can save that
[1:20:56] one because let me tell you what I know
[1:20:57] how vile I was I know how filthy I was
[1:20:59] and I don't put myself above no man if
[1:21:01] he could save me and he could deliver me
[1:21:03] he can deliver anybody anytime anywhere
[1:21:06] and they will be because every demon
[1:21:09] will be under our feet every spirit will
[1:21:11] be conquered the power of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:13] Christ is going to overcome and Conquer
[1:21:16] and cast out all so there's work to be
[1:21:21] done
[1:21:27] well
[1:21:28] that's good yes sir yes sir come on
[1:21:31] there's a broad body that has a work to
[1:21:33] do yes
[1:21:34] a work that she must fulfill
[1:21:37] and the message strengthened our hands
[1:21:40] it wasn't just the restoring of the word
[1:21:42] in this day but there's something that's
[1:21:45] supposed to be done with that word
[1:21:48] it's not just a collection of books and
[1:21:50] tapes
[1:21:51] how thankful I am for those things
[1:21:52] sometimes those statements get made and
[1:21:54] we get offended like oh well I'm happy
[1:21:56] about those things me too yeah
[1:21:58] right absolutely but books and tapes is
[1:22:00] not what what's taking us out of here
[1:22:02] it's the life of that word in those
[1:22:05] books and those tapes in this Bible it's
[1:22:07] the life of that thing coming into you
[1:22:09] and when it does brother Brown says the
[1:22:11] pillar of fire will put you in action
[1:22:14] yeah he said it will put you in action
[1:22:17] so if you've had an encounter with the
[1:22:19] pillar of fire it will put you in action
[1:22:22] well I'm just not geared that way stick
[1:22:25] your hand in a fire
[1:22:28] and you know what let me tell you what I
[1:22:29] fully understand that we're all geared
[1:22:31] differently we're all nature differently
[1:22:32] and I've said this so many times I'm
[1:22:34] gonna say it again so you may not act
[1:22:36] like I act when I put my hand in the
[1:22:38] fire
[1:22:39] but you're gonna act some way yeah
[1:22:43] yeah I was preaching one day about
[1:22:44] worship and I made the statement I said
[1:22:47] you know how people come up say hey
[1:22:48] where do you worship
[1:22:49] I say some of y'all couldn't say you've
[1:22:51] been like Tabernacle
[1:22:52] you might say that's where you go to
[1:22:54] church but it ain't where you worship
[1:22:56] and so I'm going along like that you
[1:22:58] have to know my dad he was a pretty girl
[1:23:00] fella and I and I said this I said I
[1:23:02] don't care what religion you are this
[1:23:03] ain't worship
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:13] he came up after church I was like oh
[1:23:15] this is going to be good I'm in trouble
[1:23:16] he said you got me you you got me it's
[1:23:18] true it's the truth because I don't care
[1:23:21] how you worship but this this God
[1:23:22] deserves worship this God deserves
[1:23:25] praise when he comes in the building I
[1:23:27] say give him your all whatever you're
[1:23:28] all his some may run some may that some
[1:23:31] may shout some may just raise their hand
[1:23:33] and say thank you Jesus but whatever it
[1:23:35] is give him your praise give him your
[1:23:39] worship don't let it be robbed from you
[1:23:42] and taken from you true worship has been
[1:23:44] restored in this day to the place where
[1:23:47] it's supposed to be
[1:23:49] Hallelujah
[1:23:51] there is a work to be finished yes
[1:23:54] and some would say but Jesus finished
[1:23:55] everything he said it is finished
[1:23:59] but there has to be an application of
[1:24:01] the finished work
[1:24:02] you have to apply the finished work so
[1:24:04] there's a part for you to play brother
[1:24:06] Branham says now you have to take what
[1:24:08] he did and defeat the Devil personally
[1:24:12] he said the work was finished at Calvary
[1:24:14] we only looked to that place and by
[1:24:17] faith we draw dividends off of our
[1:24:20] Eternal salvation
[1:24:22] what we know and what we what we were
[1:24:24] taught in the message is Jesus was a
[1:24:27] complete finishing
[1:24:29] or fulfilling of the Old Testament
[1:24:32] he fulfilled all the Old Testament
[1:24:35] but not the new
[1:24:38] brother Brown says the word is in the
[1:24:40] bride as it was in Mary
[1:24:43] he said the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:24:45] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:24:46] the word
[1:24:48] she performs the command of the word in
[1:24:50] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:24:53] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:24:55] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:24:57] planted and watered it comes to full
[1:24:59] Harvest serving its purpose those in the
[1:25:02] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:25:04] them do otherwise they have thus saith
[1:25:06] the Lord or they keep still they know
[1:25:09] that it has to be God in them doing the
[1:25:11] works fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:25:15] complete all his work while he was in
[1:25:17] his Earthly Ministry so now he works in
[1:25:21] and through the bride yes sir
[1:25:23] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:25:26] for him to do certain things that he
[1:25:28] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:25:31] through the bride that work which he
[1:25:34] left for this specific time
[1:25:38] he said there's still work to be done
[1:25:40] and Christ left it and he left it for a
[1:25:43] very important person he left it for
[1:25:45] somebody that he knew he could count on
[1:25:46] he left it for somebody and he equipped
[1:25:48] him and he called them and he sent him
[1:25:50] and he commissioned them these people
[1:25:52] are the Queen of Heaven who are you
[1:25:54] talking about who's going to finish the
[1:25:55] work you're gonna finish the work he
[1:25:58] called you to do it he said I trust you
[1:26:00] I commission you I send you you go to
[1:26:03] the works oh how am I gonna do it how am
[1:26:07] I going to make this happen all you got
[1:26:08] to do is let Jesus manifest out of you
[1:26:11] just manifest Jesus and when Jesus is on
[1:26:14] the inside manifesting out then the
[1:26:16] works that I do shall you do also and
[1:26:19] even greater than that shall you do just
[1:26:21] stop for a minute quit trying quit
[1:26:23] trying to manufacture we don't want
[1:26:24] nothing manufactured but just let Jesus
[1:26:27] manifest out of your life and that'll
[1:26:29] take care of it that'll finish the work
[1:26:32] that'll finish the job where he defeated
[1:26:34] the devil you'll defeat the Devil where
[1:26:36] he cast him out you'll cast him out
[1:26:40] it's good yes sir who me
[1:26:43] yeah you
[1:26:45] know
[1:26:50] we spend so much time arguing with God
[1:26:51] over our worthiness
[1:26:55] but you're
[1:26:56] you just don't know yes he does
[1:26:59] you don't know how bad I am how much I
[1:27:02] feel
[1:27:03] he does
[1:27:05] and I'm not gonna argue with you
[1:27:07] you fail all the time
[1:27:09] the club
[1:27:12] get in line
[1:27:14] quit crying
[1:27:16] what we do
[1:27:18] when we say we're not worthy and we're
[1:27:20] not good enough and we can't overcome we
[1:27:23] take and devalue the sacrifice
[1:27:26] we say your blood ain't enough your
[1:27:28] blood ain't strong enough your blood
[1:27:30] can't fix me listen I know how weak I am
[1:27:32] but I do know that I am justified I do
[1:27:35] know that I am Sanctified I do know that
[1:27:37] I'm filled with the Holy Ghost you're
[1:27:38] lifting yourself up no sir I'm saying
[1:27:40] the atonement works the blood works the
[1:27:43] blood's been applied the blood has never
[1:27:45] lost his power no it can take the
[1:27:47] weakest sinner the most filthy Sinner
[1:27:49] and it can make him an overcomer in this
[1:27:51] last day I'm a nobody oh but thank God
[1:27:54] for the blood of Jesus that saved me
[1:27:57] that picked me up and place me as I
[1:28:00] stole in the walls yes
[1:28:02] that's you too
[1:28:07] Nehemiah wasn't going to build this wall
[1:28:09] by itself yeah
[1:28:11] his message called a people and
[1:28:14] strengthened a people to work
[1:28:17] that's why we have to find ourselves in
[1:28:18] the scripture
[1:28:19] I understand that it's it's for
[1:28:21] Authority when you see who you are in
[1:28:23] the scripture and and who you are and
[1:28:25] where you are it gives you Authority but
[1:28:26] what it also does
[1:28:28] is it shows you which part you're
[1:28:29] supposed to fulfill
[1:28:31] I'm not going to read judas's part and
[1:28:33] go
[1:28:34] that's me
[1:28:38] and I read that and I go that's not for
[1:28:39] me to fulfill
[1:28:42] I read the part about Enoch and I go
[1:28:44] there's my part to fulfill
[1:28:47] that's what I'm gonna be
[1:28:49] too many times we take those scriptures
[1:28:51] and we automatically think of other
[1:28:52] people unfortunately even like the Judas
[1:28:53] ones too oh I know who that is
[1:28:57] but we're just as guilty of taking the
[1:28:58] Overcomer scriptures and going man that
[1:29:00] brother he's a good brother he's gonna
[1:29:01] make it yeah
[1:29:04] brother Tim used to always say this when
[1:29:05] I was a kid and I never could grasp it
[1:29:07] but he used to always say
[1:29:10] if you know that there's only one going
[1:29:13] you got to know that it's you
[1:29:17] if the Lord spoke in this service today
[1:29:19] in an audible voice that I'm only taking
[1:29:21] one
[1:29:22] you got to be to the place that you know
[1:29:24] I'm not worried about everybody else
[1:29:25] yeah I know that I've met the
[1:29:28] requirement
[1:29:30] and I know he has accepted it because he
[1:29:32] has filled me with his spirit and I'm
[1:29:34] the one that's going
[1:29:36] instead of oh I know who that'd be
[1:29:38] that's brother so and so he is a
[1:29:40] Christian
[1:29:41] the same blood that applies for him
[1:29:44] Applause for you today
[1:29:46] he said Jesus knew who he was and so he
[1:29:49] knew what to fulfill
[1:29:51] brother Brown says now he said suffer
[1:29:53] this to be so John that is right in
[1:29:55] other words John you are a mighty man
[1:29:57] you are a great great Mighty prophet and
[1:30:00] your revelation of me is exactly truth
[1:30:03] if we are the lights of this day we must
[1:30:05] fulfill all righteousness all God's word
[1:30:08] must be fulfilled by us for this day for
[1:30:11] it is becoming to us behooving it's
[1:30:14] becoming it's like us in other words for
[1:30:18] if we are the true Witnesses of God
[1:30:20] today John we are the lights of this age
[1:30:22] and if we are the lights of this age
[1:30:23] there's so much scripture that's got to
[1:30:25] be fulfilled during this age it's up to
[1:30:28] us brother Brown says hallelujah some of
[1:30:31] us would go it's up to us oh no
[1:30:34] but brother Brown says it's up to us
[1:30:36] hallelujah yes
[1:30:38] it's up to us to see that all God's
[1:30:41] righteousness is fulfilled and what is
[1:30:43] righteousness his word
[1:30:45] in other words John you know who I am I
[1:30:48] am the high priest that's true John and
[1:30:50] I have need to be baptized of thee but
[1:30:53] we've got to fulfill all righteousness
[1:30:55] and I have need to be baptized of thee
[1:30:57] now to fulfill the word of God because
[1:30:59] all the word has got to be fulfilled and
[1:31:03] we are the lights of the day and it's up
[1:31:05] to us to fulfill all this and I know
[1:31:07] that your righteousness and your desire
[1:31:08] is to fulfill the word you man this is a
[1:31:11] lengthy quote brother Brown was driving
[1:31:12] at home yes he's driving it home he says
[1:31:16] it's becoming to us we are the lights
[1:31:18] the light of every age should do the
[1:31:20] same thing all right we know what's to
[1:31:23] be fulfilled you who are spiritual and
[1:31:25] know the word of God you see what God
[1:31:27] has promised now the word will not just
[1:31:29] come easy but it comes by observation
[1:31:32] you've got to press your way in to do it
[1:31:34] but yet it behooves us it is becoming to
[1:31:37] us to fill all of God's word we must do
[1:31:41] it
[1:31:42] we must do it
[1:31:45] what are you saying I'm saying this
[1:31:48] bride Ministry is the continuation of
[1:31:51] the ministry of Christ
[1:31:53] the ministry of the groom and the
[1:31:54] ministry of the Bride must be the exact
[1:31:57] same thing if it's something different
[1:31:59] then it's not the bride
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:02] brother Brown says in one place that if
[1:32:05] Jesus Christ
[1:32:07] had stood up and said the days of
[1:32:08] Miracles were passed and that these
[1:32:10] things don't happen anymore it would
[1:32:12] have automatically disqualified him from
[1:32:14] being the Lamb of God
[1:32:17] and if that applies to him
[1:32:19] that applies to the bride
[1:32:21] it must be a perfect match
[1:32:23] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the
[1:32:26] very works of Jesus Christ continued the
[1:32:29] very very casting down of Satan
[1:32:31] continued the the very power is of Hell
[1:32:33] casting doubt being cast down continued
[1:32:36] doing works just like Jesus did in sand
[1:32:39] ballot and tobiah or Satan hates it
[1:32:43] he hates seeing the work being restored
[1:32:45] not just in a body called Jesus
[1:32:48] but in a multi-membered bride of Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ and Satan sees it happening
[1:32:55] see for the first time in 2000 years
[1:32:57] Satan sees the people on the face of the
[1:32:59] Earth that are walking and operating and
[1:33:02] talking just like the first age did
[1:33:05] just like that age did and he looks at
[1:33:07] it and he says what got the first age to
[1:33:09] fall
[1:33:11] formalism
[1:33:13] and so that's why the exact same attack
[1:33:14] that came against the first age is now
[1:33:16] being used again in the second at the
[1:33:18] end time when that when that grain of
[1:33:20] wheat is begin to come up once again
[1:33:22] because he says it worked in the first
[1:33:24] age
[1:33:25] I'm going to use it again in the last
[1:33:27] stage but what Satan failed to
[1:33:29] understand is he didn't really conquer
[1:33:31] that first age that age was
[1:33:32] predestinated to go into the ground
[1:33:34] intentionally because there was a crop
[1:33:36] gonna come up in the last days there was
[1:33:39] a crop that was predestinated not to go
[1:33:41] into the ground predestinated to go into
[1:33:44] the Garner predestinated to take a
[1:33:46] Rapture it doesn't matter what he comes
[1:33:49] against us with this broad will not fall
[1:33:52] because she's predestinated to make it
[1:33:54] she's predestinated to doing a Rapture
[1:33:56] he can't stop this bride but there's
[1:33:59] words to do there's Works to claim oh
[1:34:02] come on I'm ready to do whatever it
[1:34:03] takes to take that Rapture I'm ready to
[1:34:05] do whatever it takes listen he had seen
[1:34:08] prophets come anointed men and they had
[1:34:11] fallen David Fell Samson fell but he had
[1:34:14] never seen a man like Jesus there had
[1:34:16] never been one quite like Jesus and he's
[1:34:18] seen churches come and he saw Luther's
[1:34:20] Revival die and Wesley's Revival die and
[1:34:23] Pentecost go into air but he hasn't seen
[1:34:25] one like this bride she's bold of his
[1:34:28] bone she's flesh of his flesh she's
[1:34:30] walking and doing the works of Jesus
[1:34:32] once again on Earth he hasn't seen one
[1:34:35] like this before she's predestinated not
[1:34:38] to fall right
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:45] it's good
[1:34:51] you know the devil don't mind a church
[1:34:52] sitting there cold and form on backslip
[1:34:58] he don't mind you going to church
[1:35:01] no victory yeah
[1:35:04] no overcoming yes sir yes sir enemy
[1:35:06] coming through the walls at every Gap
[1:35:09] I bother him though build all the wall
[1:35:11] you want leave that Gap yeah
[1:35:15] but let them one time
[1:35:17] quit being just hearers
[1:35:19] and start putting their hand to the work
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:23] and listen to them Spirits begin to mock
[1:35:26] listen to the spirits begin to make fun
[1:35:28] Let The Works of Christ and the
[1:35:30] manifestations of the spirit begin to
[1:35:32] take place in the house of God and
[1:35:34] listen to them
[1:35:35] when the Dynamics begin to come to the
[1:35:37] mechanics brother Joe yeah when those
[1:35:39] things begin to happen and they start
[1:35:40] saying oh we don't need to preach that
[1:35:41] way no more back off that leave that Gap
[1:35:44] right there no we don't get the Holy
[1:35:46] Ghost the way they used to back off that
[1:35:47] right there you don't need an experience
[1:35:49] leave that Gap right there in the wall
[1:35:51] now the spirit don't move like that
[1:35:53] anymore that's all just worked up
[1:35:54] emotion we're gonna leave that Gap right
[1:35:57] there in the wall and they mock
[1:35:59] because the wall is being restored and
[1:36:01] once those walls are closed up
[1:36:03] they're on the wrong side
[1:36:06] and there's no more coming and going and
[1:36:09] coming and going
[1:36:11] make sure you're on the right side of
[1:36:13] the wall
[1:36:14] make sure you're on the building side
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:18] Nehemiah 2 19. but when sand ballot the
[1:36:21] horror night and tobiah the servant the
[1:36:23] ammonite and gesham the Arabian heard it
[1:36:27] they laughed us to scorn
[1:36:30] and despised us and said what is this
[1:36:34] that you do yeah
[1:36:35] what is all this freedom of worship
[1:36:38] what does all this you got to have the
[1:36:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know
[1:36:42] listen to the Token that's what the
[1:36:43] prophet taught
[1:36:45] yeah people act like preaching that you
[1:36:46] got to have the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:36:47] is a new teaching
[1:36:50] I thought it was pretty basic yeah
[1:36:53] yeah I thought that was pretty
[1:36:53] fundamental
[1:36:57] verse 20.
[1:36:59] then I answered them and said unto them
[1:37:02] the god of Heaven
[1:37:04] he will prosper us
[1:37:06] therefore we his servants will arise
[1:37:09] and we will build
[1:37:11] but ye have no portion nor right nor
[1:37:16] Memorial
[1:37:17] in Jerusalem in other words why are you
[1:37:20] worried about what we're doing this is
[1:37:23] our portion this is our inheritance
[1:37:25] that's my Rapture I ain't worried about
[1:37:27] how you like how I get to my Rapture I
[1:37:30] ain't worried about how you like when
[1:37:31] Deliverance come if you like how I act
[1:37:34] if you like how we preach if you like
[1:37:36] how we worship you don't have a portion
[1:37:38] in this anyway but to those that are the
[1:37:40] New Jerusalem we will build the wall
[1:37:42] this is our portion it's our inheritance
[1:37:45] it's our Rapture we're gonna take it ye
[1:37:48] have no portion
[1:37:55] Hallelujah
[1:37:57] it's good those that have no portion in
[1:37:59] Jerusalem mock
[1:38:00] and they make fun of
[1:38:02] but there's a people called to the work
[1:38:06] when you're called to the work you're
[1:38:07] not worried about the mockers
[1:38:09] you know you're not deterred by the
[1:38:11] naysayers you're not deterred by even
[1:38:13] your own family and let's bring it down
[1:38:15] to what most of us deal with
[1:38:17] you're not deterred by your own doubts
[1:38:21] listen let's be honest on most days
[1:38:23] we're not hearing voices out there
[1:38:26] we're hearing voices right here
[1:38:31] you're not good enough
[1:38:32] what is this what are you trying to do
[1:38:34] you think that little step matters yeah
[1:38:36] because that was a Pebble in the wall
[1:38:39] and it may not matter right now but when
[1:38:40] I put another cup
[1:38:42] and another Pebble and I take another
[1:38:44] step listen the devil likes to make fun
[1:38:46] of our steps
[1:38:52] why
[1:38:54] because he wants you to think that step
[1:38:56] was insignificant so you won't take
[1:38:58] another
[1:38:59] but if you recognize that that right
[1:39:01] there was huge
[1:39:02] and you recognize I can do that again
[1:39:05] and I can do that again and I can do
[1:39:08] that again and I can get a little closer
[1:39:10] you take a step towards God I promise
[1:39:12] you he's taking a step towards you and
[1:39:13] the Satan's going that don't matter that
[1:39:15] don't matter that don't matter but what
[1:39:17] he don't see is on the other side as
[1:39:19] Jesus is taking those steps right
[1:39:20] towards me and I promise you that
[1:39:22] matters every step he's getting closer
[1:39:24] and that breach is getting closed in and
[1:39:26] that wall is getting closed and it's
[1:39:28] sealing the enemy out don't let him
[1:39:30] minimize the steps you take don't let
[1:39:33] him minimize your prayer life in the
[1:39:34] morning or your prayer life in the
[1:39:36] evening or whenever it is you do it yeah
[1:39:38] don't let him minimize that to you it is
[1:39:40] a big thing it is an important thing
[1:39:42] repentance is important forgiveness is
[1:39:44] important getting rid of that root of
[1:39:46] bitterness in your heart is important oh
[1:39:48] that's not a big deal just hold on to it
[1:39:49] oh it's a big deal
[1:39:52] yeah it's a big deal I gave the analogy
[1:39:53] the other day I said this this right
[1:39:55] here doesn't weigh anything and I can
[1:39:57] stand right here and don't even know I'm
[1:39:58] doing it it's light
[1:40:02] but you know what I can handle this
[1:40:06] I can hold this
[1:40:08] but an hour from now it's gonna be heavy
[1:40:12] an hour from now
[1:40:14] it's gonna be real heavy but now my
[1:40:15] stubbornness is there well I can't set
[1:40:17] it down now
[1:40:20] because then what the devil will do is
[1:40:21] you hold something long enough and he'll
[1:40:22] start to convince you that's who you are
[1:40:24] yeah yeah oh you can't that's just who
[1:40:26] you are that's how God Made You God
[1:40:27] didn't make you that way God Made You
[1:40:28] free
[1:40:31] yeah and you hold this long enough and
[1:40:32] by the end of the day what it's going to
[1:40:33] do is it's going to get your arms so
[1:40:34] stiff and sore that it don't hardly want
[1:40:36] to move and it paralyzes your arm
[1:40:37] temporarily and you hold that Grudge
[1:40:41] you hold that hard feeling you hold that
[1:40:43] bitterness and it don't paralyze your
[1:40:45] arm it paralyzes your faith it paralyzes
[1:40:48] your Walt where you can't take another
[1:40:50] step and he's telling you this morning
[1:40:51] you've got work to do why don't you sit
[1:40:53] that thing down set yourself free set
[1:40:55] the thing down and walk away from it
[1:40:57] there's work for you to do quit holding
[1:40:59] that Grudge quit holding that bitterness
[1:41:00] you're only holding yourself prisoner
[1:41:02] you're only paralyzing your faith it's
[1:41:04] the enemy convincing you to hold on to
[1:41:06] that thing and he's saying just set it
[1:41:08] down this morning and do the work of the
[1:41:10] Lord there's work for you to do this
[1:41:12] morning you're called to it you're
[1:41:14] chosen for it you're equipped for it
[1:41:16] this morning
[1:41:18] brother Brown says in the carrying away
[1:41:21] of Babylon remember if God has a work
[1:41:24] for you to do all demons out of Torment
[1:41:26] can't take you they just can't startle
[1:41:29] you in any way God's got a purpose for
[1:41:31] the Holy Ghost Church and all the Devils
[1:41:33] of Hell will never be able to take it
[1:41:35] away God's got a purpose for it and it
[1:41:38] will never be destroyed until God lets
[1:41:40] it fulfill the purpose that he has
[1:41:42] ordained it to do and it will yes that
[1:41:46] doesn't sound like I hope so or maybe so
[1:41:48] he said and it will
[1:41:52] it's more than knowing there's a work to
[1:41:54] be done right
[1:41:55] right it's putting your hand
[1:41:58] s brother Branham over and over again
[1:41:59] when he's speaking on Jesus baptism
[1:42:02] he would emphasize that they both had
[1:42:04] the revelation of who both of them were
[1:42:07] oh I have the revelation of God sent a
[1:42:09] prophet I have these Revelations that's
[1:42:11] awesome you need to
[1:42:13] he says but he says they both have the
[1:42:15] revelation of who they were and but
[1:42:17] Jesus would tell John it's because
[1:42:20] of that Revelation yeah because you see
[1:42:23] because of who you are that's why we
[1:42:26] have to do what we have to do it's not
[1:42:29] just well I know who I am right good
[1:42:32] that commissions you to do the work that
[1:42:35] you're called to do
[1:42:36] brother Brown says let God live in you
[1:42:38] to vindicate the promises of this day
[1:42:40] just as John as Jesus said to John
[1:42:43] suffer it to be so John that's right but
[1:42:45] we are the messengers of this day and
[1:42:47] we've got to fulfill our righteousness
[1:42:49] and if we are the Christians of this day
[1:42:51] let's receive Jesus Christ into our
[1:42:53] heart and he is the word don't deny any
[1:42:56] of it say it's the truth and place it in
[1:42:58] your heart watch the fruit of the spirit
[1:43:01] upon you and fulfill every promise that
[1:43:04] he made in the Bible God wants to
[1:43:06] fulfill his word and he don't have any
[1:43:09] hands but mine and yours he don't have
[1:43:11] any eyes but mine and yours he has no
[1:43:14] tongue but mine
[1:43:16] and yours that's right listen I don't
[1:43:19] want to leave anything undone
[1:43:22] yeah I don't want to leave any promise
[1:43:23] unclaimed
[1:43:25] you know every other age came and they
[1:43:27] did a portion but they left a part of it
[1:43:29] unfinished they didn't claim every
[1:43:32] promise they left they left word
[1:43:34] unfulfilled
[1:43:35] because they operated under portions of
[1:43:38] the word
[1:43:39] that they operated under portions and
[1:43:42] gifts and manifestations but they were
[1:43:45] not under the anointing of the fullness
[1:43:48] that you and I have yes
[1:43:50] yes so let's key into this as we begin
[1:43:52] to bring this down
[1:43:53] it's not in this day good enough that we
[1:43:55] just work
[1:43:58] this is the day of the finished work
[1:44:02] we must finish the work because the
[1:44:05] fullness has come so they're in every
[1:44:07] other age there was always more to come
[1:44:09] they were right there's more to come
[1:44:12] and the ones who saw that moved on into
[1:44:14] the next age into the next messenger and
[1:44:16] they moved with it but now we come to an
[1:44:18] age where as far as Messengers go there
[1:44:21] is not more to come
[1:44:22] there is not another message coming
[1:44:24] this message is the finishing well how
[1:44:27] do you know that in the days of the
[1:44:28] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:44:30] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:44:31] should be finished it is a finishing
[1:44:34] message
[1:44:35] we've been called to finish the work in
[1:44:37] this day and so other ages operated
[1:44:39] under portions and they operated uh
[1:44:42] under anointings and gifts and things of
[1:44:44] that nature but this is this is a group
[1:44:47] that's more than Justified
[1:44:49] that's more than Sanctified that's more
[1:44:52] than just having that's having just
[1:44:53] gifts of the Spirit but she must be bone
[1:44:56] of his bones I know we've heard that
[1:44:58] flesh of his flesh I know we've heard
[1:45:00] that what does it mean until we're
[1:45:03] operating in that way then we need to
[1:45:05] keep hearing it because we got to hear
[1:45:07] it with more than this it's got to begin
[1:45:08] to resonate I am an overcomer I am
[1:45:11] manifesting Jesus on this Earth I am
[1:45:13] called to finish this work I am not just
[1:45:16] a part of him but she is him and it
[1:45:20] behooves us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:45:23] you know we've always heard it said that
[1:45:25] you'll look in the mirror of the word
[1:45:26] look in the mirror of the word and
[1:45:28] that's usually spoken in the context of
[1:45:30] lining up your life
[1:45:32] you know well if you you're acting that
[1:45:34] way you should look in the mirror of the
[1:45:35] word you know is that how a Christian
[1:45:36] should act and I'm not saying that in a
[1:45:37] mocking way I agree you should
[1:45:40] but what I'm telling you this morning is
[1:45:42] begin to look into the mirror of the
[1:45:43] word to see what kind of victory was in
[1:45:45] the word
[1:45:46] and see if that victory in your life is
[1:45:49] matching the mirror of the word where he
[1:45:51] faced Satan and used the word and said
[1:45:53] get thee behind me Satan I can do the
[1:45:55] same thing where he casted out Satan I
[1:45:57] can do the same thing oh you think
[1:45:59] that's for preachers no I think that's
[1:46:00] for everybody in these four walls you
[1:46:02] can take the word upon your lips you can
[1:46:04] face the devil you can cast him out you
[1:46:07] can stand Toe to Toe with him and you
[1:46:08] will be victorious how do you know
[1:46:10] because she is him she will match him
[1:46:13] she will do the works that he did and
[1:46:16] it's his work being manifested through a
[1:46:18] broad body it's what we're called to not
[1:46:20] just called but equipped how long's the
[1:46:23] journey going to be because I'm going to
[1:46:24] make sure you got everything you need
[1:46:26] when are you going to return I'm going
[1:46:27] to make sure you're not left fighting
[1:46:29] one day without everything that you need
[1:46:32] I know what I'm supposed to do because I
[1:46:35] see what the groom did look in the
[1:46:38] mirror there and let the victory match
[1:46:40] the victory today
[1:46:44] he says and as he being the groom the
[1:46:47] bride has to come forth because it's
[1:46:49] part of him and it can only be the
[1:46:51] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:46:53] the revelations any of the others has
[1:46:56] spoken of the Bride it can only manifest
[1:46:59] if it does something different from the
[1:47:01] groom it is at the bride
[1:47:03] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[1:47:06] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:47:11] his power so in this age it's no longer
[1:47:15] in portions like it was through the
[1:47:17] church ages under Luther and Wesley they
[1:47:19] couldn't finish the work that's right
[1:47:21] they couldn't fulfill the Great
[1:47:23] Commission they couldn't fulfill John 14
[1:47:25] 12.
[1:47:27] and you say well there's been other
[1:47:28] anointing men down Through the Ages that
[1:47:30] did that did Mighty Works absolutely
[1:47:32] sure there was there were other Mighty
[1:47:34] Men Who did the works but it says
[1:47:36] greater shall you do
[1:47:38] and the greater part of John 14 12 Finds
[1:47:42] Its fulfillment in the fullness of his
[1:47:44] coming
[1:47:45] the greater part Finds Its fulfillment
[1:47:48] in the fullness
[1:47:49] of his coming so so in the fullness of
[1:47:52] the manifestation of the son of man
[1:47:55] Ministry
[1:47:57] speak my language
[1:47:59] the third pool Ministry
[1:48:01] that's where we find the Fulfillment of
[1:48:03] the greater part of John 14 12. how can
[1:48:06] you do the works of Christ and greater
[1:48:09] to the fullness unless the fullness of
[1:48:11] the anointing of Christ is here so down
[1:48:13] Through the Ages they could not fulfill
[1:48:15] that you'll find time and time and time
[1:48:17] again we don't usually quote it most of
[1:48:19] the time when we you see people talk
[1:48:21] about end time scriptures we say Malachi
[1:48:22] 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 but almost
[1:48:26] every time brother Branham lists those
[1:48:27] scriptures he also lists John 14 12.
[1:48:30] that's right he always lists that or
[1:48:33] mentions that as an in time scripture
[1:48:36] one example he says remember in what
[1:48:39] time is it sir how many ever heard it
[1:48:42] say Amen was it exactly right then we've
[1:48:45] got the Revelation in the last days for
[1:48:47] the message of the Lord God to gather
[1:48:49] his bride together no other age has it
[1:48:52] been promised it's promised in this age
[1:48:55] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. Saint John 14 12
[1:49:00] and Joel 2 38. why now
[1:49:05] because it's the Omega Church
[1:49:08] and the wall is being built back exactly
[1:49:10] how Paul preached well I don't think
[1:49:12] it's going to be exactly the way it was
[1:49:13] there all I know is that the prophet who
[1:49:16] I believe when he went beyond the
[1:49:17] curtain of time
[1:49:19] said I preached it exactly how Paul
[1:49:24] preached it now not only did he say that
[1:49:26] but the numbers of thousands and
[1:49:29] thousands and thousands the ones that
[1:49:30] were there they didn't say well actually
[1:49:32] brother Brown there's going to be more
[1:49:34] there's going to be what you don't they
[1:49:35] said we're resting on that
[1:49:41] that the wall is being built back
[1:49:43] exactly the way it was before it was
[1:49:47] torn down down through the church ages
[1:49:52] brother Branham says it has to be
[1:49:54] because a woman and her husband become
[1:49:56] one they become one and so does the
[1:49:58] bride and the Christ and Christ become
[1:49:59] one the ministry of the bride and the
[1:50:02] ministry of Christ
[1:50:03] is the same
[1:50:05] a people in this last day driven to
[1:50:07] finish the work
[1:50:09] driven to finish the wall driven to work
[1:50:11] driven to get the wall closed in to see
[1:50:13] everything placed properly to see
[1:50:15] Jerusalem made ready and it has to be
[1:50:18] made ready this has to be something we
[1:50:20] do well no no we don't have to do it
[1:50:22] actually according to John 4 34 it says
[1:50:23] Jesus said unto them my meat is to do
[1:50:26] the will of him that sent me and to
[1:50:29] finish his work the Bible tells us that
[1:50:33] the bride hath made herself ready what
[1:50:36] has she done she's finished everything
[1:50:37] that he called her to finish she's done
[1:50:39] everything the enemy is under her feet
[1:50:42] she's closed in the gaps what is it in
[1:50:44] this day driving us to do the work we're
[1:50:47] called to it when others can stand back
[1:50:49] and say it doesn't matter to me it
[1:50:51] matters to us
[1:50:53] it matters to us
[1:50:56] but I'm tired brother Aaron

[1:52:10] heart it still heals the sick it still
[1:52:12] delivers the battle and one of these
[1:52:15] days

[1:52:29] there's a work to be finished
[1:52:33] don't get distracted by the mockers
[1:52:37] Nehemiah four and one
[1:52:40] it says but it came to pass that when
[1:52:42] Sam ballot heard that we build it
[1:52:44] he was Roth
[1:52:46] and he took great indignation and mocked
[1:52:49] the Jews
[1:52:51] and he spaked before his brethren
[1:52:53] in the army of Samaria and said what do
[1:52:57] these feeble Jews
[1:52:59] those people up in Hardy Arkansas think
[1:53:01] they're doing
[1:53:04] so Fable so weak
[1:53:06] build the wall
[1:53:09] he said what do these people Jews will
[1:53:11] they fortify themselves yes sir
[1:53:15] will they sacrifice yes sir
[1:53:18] sure will
[1:53:20] they make an end in a day will they
[1:53:22] revive the stones out of the heaps of
[1:53:24] the rubbish which are burned yeah
[1:53:27] and there's more to get
[1:53:29] I got loved ones that maybe you thought
[1:53:31] was too messed up but they're a stone in
[1:53:33] the wall too
[1:53:35] I've got victories I'm still going to
[1:53:37] win there's other stones
[1:53:38] I'm going to keep building you can mock
[1:53:41] all you want oh you think you're going
[1:53:43] to do the Greater Works yeah
[1:53:45] yeah we sure are
[1:53:46] right the king sent me and he put it in
[1:53:48] writing so I didn't even have to
[1:53:49] question he said I was going to do the
[1:53:51] Greater Works
[1:53:52] oh you think you can still receive the
[1:53:54] Holy Ghost absolutely
[1:53:56] I sure can
[1:53:57] there's a promise that says the promise
[1:53:59] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:54:01] many of them that's as far off as me as
[1:54:03] the Lord Our God shall call
[1:54:05] there's a promise there
[1:54:07] yes sir you think you can still be
[1:54:08] healed
[1:54:10] absolutely
[1:54:12] 100 percent
[1:54:15] you mind if I give a testimony real
[1:54:17] quick I promise the Lord I testify
[1:54:21] I battled some some real health problems
[1:54:23] for several years I was sent all over
[1:54:26] the place being tested in every hospital
[1:54:28] and neurological and they thought I had
[1:54:30] ALS and
[1:54:32] all kind of other things and these tests
[1:54:34] and that test they never could find
[1:54:37] the issue and I always said I don't got
[1:54:38] to know a giant's name in order to cut
[1:54:40] his head off so it's okay
[1:54:42] but I was at a youth camp in a prayer
[1:54:44] line praying for people last August
[1:54:48] brother Andrew Spencer is at the end he
[1:54:50] came down to my end where I was and he
[1:54:52] tapped me and he said your complete
[1:54:53] healing is in the room right now
[1:54:55] and I grabbed hold to that
[1:54:58] and I woke up that morning and I woke up
[1:55:00] and I didn't have a dream or anything I
[1:55:02] just woke up and it was just running
[1:55:03] through my head
[1:55:04] six months of improvement six months six
[1:55:07] I didn't know what it really was I began
[1:55:09] to apply it to my life
[1:55:11] and then that night that happened so I
[1:55:13] claimed it I've had the best six months
[1:55:17] of my entire life
[1:55:20] it's been wonderful let me tell you
[1:55:21] something I'm not testifying to the
[1:55:23] glory of the devil I'm testifying so you
[1:55:24] understand that when he comes you don't
[1:55:26] give in you don't quit you don't get off
[1:55:27] the wall

[1:55:31] and I've had about the two worst weeks I
[1:55:33] ever had brother Joe

[1:56:14] pool coming and the pool from up there

[1:57:06] we are chosen generation
[1:57:14] we are the generation
[1:57:18] with the culmination the final voice the

[1:58:28] amen do you believe that this morning
[1:58:30] yes the coming of the Lord is near
[1:58:34] you bow your heads with me for just a
[1:58:36] moment
[1:58:38] you know made a point while I was
[1:58:39] preaching that
[1:58:42] there's no step
[1:58:44] in the rebuilding and the restoration
[1:58:48] that's a small step
[1:58:49] every Pebble in the wall is important
[1:58:52] Every Soul that we listen
[1:58:55] it's an individual walk but it's a group
[1:58:58] Rapture and what I mean by that is I
[1:59:01] can't go till every single one that's
[1:59:03] called to go is ready
[1:59:05] I can't go without you if your name's on
[1:59:07] that book
[1:59:09] so it may seem like a small step but I'm
[1:59:12] just asking this
[1:59:13] if you've been struggling
[1:59:16] if you laid your sword down
[1:59:19] if you hadn't been on that wall building
[1:59:21] and doing the work that you've been
[1:59:23] called to do like you know you should
[1:59:25] in this morning you 'd say Lord I'm
[1:59:27] getting back on the wall
[1:59:29] but I'm picking back up right where I
[1:59:31] let off
[1:59:32] I'm getting a sword in one hand
[1:59:35] I'm getting my building materials in the
[1:59:37] other I know I'm part of that chosen
[1:59:40] generation I know I'm called for this
[1:59:43] I didn't come out of denomination I
[1:59:45] didn't come out of the world I didn't
[1:59:46] leave all that behind to quit and today
[1:59:48] Lord I just want to lift my hand to you
[1:59:50] and say I'm getting back on the wall
[1:59:52] this morning

[2:00:01] more for me I know there's more for me
[2:00:03] to do
[2:00:04] oh Hallelujah hands all across this
[2:00:07] place listen it was a group effort
[2:00:10] the Bible would say that they sent every
[2:00:12] man to his own place to build the wall
[2:00:15] so if we all built our part and you
[2:00:17] didn't build yours there was still a gap
[2:00:18] there I can't seal the wall up without
[2:00:21] you you can't seal the wall up without
[2:00:24] me we all got to do our part oh Father
