if you have your Bibles tonight let us turn to James chapter 2 James chapter 2 and verse 14 we'll start with verse 14 say Amen when you get it amen oh that was weak nobody's got any Bibles anymore do they amen James chapter 2 and4 you can follow along on there if you want to amen what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled not withstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what do it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me my show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works and thou believest that there is one God and thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know a vain man that hath faith without works is dead and he continues on there we'll go down to F uh verse uh number 24 ye see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works and when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead Also may the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated and if I could take for a thought tonight faith without works is dead and I would say you're pretty familiar with that scripture I know we've all we've all read it and I know also there in the book of James uh he talks about he talks about you could be hearers there's hearers not to be hearers of the word only but doers also y'all okay so far amen you're still there all right I know you've ate a lot and the dessert was good but give me 45 minutes and I'll quit and he said but but you know James tells us there that in the book there he says that uh he says you know you can't be hearers only that doesn't mean you shouldn't ever hear the message that doesn't mean you shouldn't ever read your Bibles but if that's all you do and you don't apply it or have a Works to follow that then uh it that doesn't do any good I mean why do you go to church to become a better Christian amen it doesn't do you any good to go if you're not going to apply what you learn at church to your daily life or amen apply what you read in the Bible to your daily life I mean there's got to be something to follow the faith that you claim to have and it's more than just saying I have faith or saying I believe the message or saying all the right things but you've got to have an action to follow up the faith can you say amen and so brother Brandon would say it like this he said there's one thing to teach something there's another thing for God to confirm it and say it's the truth there's one thing to say something it's another thing to do something it's not hearers it's doers and he quotes what we just read he said show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my Works he said if you believe it you'll act upon it that's it and then your faith becomes Works he said now notice he said I'll show you my faith by my works now now Abraham we know was the father of Faith Can you say amen I wish y'all would get with me just a little bit better y'all look like you're in a food coma tonight I wonder why amen but let me go ahead and tell you something without faith it is impossible to please God so you've got to have faith Works does not uh works works alone does not produce Faith but faith will produce works and then you can show your faith by your Works can you say amen and so Abraham remember he already had the faith when Isaac when the promise of Isaac was to come amen the the promise was there and the faith was there but then there had to be a work he had to hold on to the promise that was something that he had to do so it wasn't good enough for Abraham to say well am mean God's going to send us his son but we don't have to prepare for the sun no he had faith enough to put his faith into action and prepare PR for the son that was to come can you say amen amen so we're not looking we're not looking at the message and saying well the message is going to get me out of here in a Rapture no you need to live the message or the message ain't going to get you out of here right is that right amen so we say well the message is is powerful enough and and God loves me so I don't have to put any Works behind it amen if you love God you'll do what his word said I know we fall down I know we make mistakes and I know many times the flesh is getting in the way of us serving God like we should amen but if we're really sold out to the message of the hour and we're really sold out to being a Christian then our works will show what our faith is on the inside is that all right so far amen so faith is what God sees works is what your neighbor sees faith God knows if you have faith or not God knew if you had faith and amen he but he sent you a promise because he knew you would believe it he knew you would have the faith for it amen he didn't send just anybody a promised son but he sent Abraham a promised son amen but he knew that he would get an action and believe that what God had promised he was able to do also can you say amen and so tonight what we say is is is be it unto me according to Thy word amen I'm going to put your faith Lord the faith that he's put inside of me I'm going to put that faith in action how about you tonight amen he's given us the message of the hour amen he's given us the word of God it's time that we put it into action in our daily lives is that all right amen so in in order to you say well I have faith to move mountains and if you do that's fine but until you take the action of speaking to the mountain then you didn't show you had the faith right amen if there's something in your way that needs to be spoken to amen the faith on the inside of you will take an action to speak to that thing that's in your way do you believe that tonight amen so brother uh brother Brandon would say it like this in the story of Abraham being the father of Faith he said I'm going to call the seed from Isaac and he said I want you to take Isaac out there and kill him the only hope that he had was in Isaac and so he said you just imagine Abraham taken his his promise if you will up to the mountain to be killed amen and and and he knew that that was a miracle from God he knew that was a promise from God and he knew that God was able to also spare his life when he got up to the mountain amen can you say Amen today amen so God I'm turning to steart up here already I've said amen more than I've said anything else but amen what we what we've got to remember tonight is if God made the promise God is more than able to keep the promise and so what we have to remember in the scriptures is God he didn't give just everybody the promise he didn't just give everybody the gift of faith but when he gave them the faith he expected them to step out on the impossible and make it a reality amen I believe today that God has given Faith to you because you know how to use your faith amen it might just be a little bit of Faith but I believe a prophet said one time he said you've got more faith than you realize you've got amen you've got more faith than what you realize you even needed amen but when the devil puts something in your life to where you need faith you'll realize that on the inside of you is something that will raise up and it's something you may not even known that you had am me it'll raise up and say it'll say you know what just like my father Abraham just like he spoke his son just like he prepared for a baby that he knew he couldn't have amen but he spoke possible The Impossible and so I believe tonight we need to speak our faith and speak the promises over our lives and and be positive amen I believe we should never have a negative testimony but speak positive over your church speak positive over your family speak positive over that situation that's all around you listen Church the devil is always full of negativity and he wants to ruin your life with depression and anxiety and everything that'll come against you but we serve a god of the impossible we serve a God who is more than able and I say tonight we need to take a hold of the word of God and let our faith be shown tonight by the action we take I believe coming to church is an action of faith if if you believe in the word of God and the and when he says you know we should we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together we believe that there it's there for a purpose and so we put our faith in action and we show up at church amen so it's an action it may not be something we always uh enjoy it may not be something that's easy to do but it's an action of Faith that's right you come out here where there's a hundred other people with germs and things like that and you know you're you're just in this you're in this tube full of people and they breathe on you and they Shake Your Hand and and they look at you funny sometimes but you're here and you're you're putting your faith in action is that all right tonight so everything we do amen if it's according to the word is an action of faith when you're baptized it's an action of your faith amen when you receive the Holy Ghost it's an action that you believed and it's an action of Faith so faith without works is dead if you say you have faith and there's no Works to follow the faith then it is dead can I get an amen here tonight somewhere amen I believe that what we need to realize is we need to act on what we say We Believe come on you say I believe the message let's act on the message can we do that anden I believe the Bible let's act on the listen church we need our faith to become an action not just something we say we have but something that we can show the world that I really believe this message I would die for this message amen I'm going to go to church when I don't feel like going amen I'm going to show up and show the devil whose side I'm on why because we have faith that God is going to meet us right here in the house of God Amen if we do that we realize that it's not just our works that save us amen but it is the faith that is saving us but our works are showing that the faith is really there is that okay amen so Abraham went on a three days journey and he went into the mountain and remember he takes his son and he lays him there and he says Lord Brother random dramatizes the story and he said you know he said he said here's the Altar and here's the sacrifice and he said but where's the lamb amen but he knew that God was not going to allow he said brother brand said he knew that if he took Isaac's life God was able to raise him up again because he received him as one even from the dead and so he realized that he couldn't that his seed was going to come through Isaac even if he had to take his life amen that's the faith of Abraham and we are Abraham's seed amen that faith is in you but we need to recognize our faith tonight and act on the faith listen we was talking in the back room it's not a reckless Faith it's not something out outside the word we don't go speaking children into existence if the Lord didn't tell us to amen but if God has given you a word if God has shown you in the word where you are to believe the word of God and act on the word then you can take that to the bank and you can act on it and God will back up his word amen so we don't have Reckless faith we don't go go around creating mountains where there don't need to be mountains and we don't need to go go around creating things and amen calling things that that we've never really you know well we just like this to be over here I mean there there's a lot of things I would like to do I'd like to pick up Hardy Arkansas and move it south for the winter come on or move it to Tucson for the winter they come out here to experience the wonderful weather we have but you just think about it tonight we we all say we have faith if I ask you for a show of hands everybody in here says they have faith right how many's got faith everybody's got faith but now where the devil will challenge you the pastor even has faith the devil will challenge you on that Faith tomorrow morning man when you when you get a headache as as high heal with way too often when you get a headache and you realize that nothing is too hard for God and and you don't have to suffer with that thing but we allow the devil it seems like temporary residence in our minds and we allow the devil to do things because we really don't feel like standing for the word of God because it's too hard but nothing's too hard for God yes amen and so we realize that Abraham he already had the child it would have been really easy for him to stay home and be like I've already got the promise I don't need to go sacrifice my kid I've already been blessed I don't really need to go to church I've got a job I don't really need blessings from God but you know you really do because you're going to find out again that you really do need God you really do need God because it just because things are going good that's the time you need to remember where your blessings came from that's when you still need to act on the faith that brought you to the blessings you're experiencing now amen so we realize amen we we get cold on God we we uh we we let things happen because we we feel blessed we get we get into a leot of sin condition don't we we all do I I do and and you get into a leoty and condition you don't pray as much and you don't seek God as much and you don't really feel the fervency in your heart anymore but I want to tell you that's the time when you need to realize don't get cold on God because there's going to be another Val coming up where you're going to need the hand of God and don't just put him on the outside when times are going good but remember where your strength came from remembered where your help came from amen remember where the sun came from remember when the when the winters are cold and the ice is on the roads amen remember there is a sunshine coming amen and thank God for the good days because there's going to be some bad days when you got to call him on the scene amen I believe we need to let our faith become in action just more than we ever have why because we have let our faith yeah we we we we we let our faith build in the bad times and and we start saying well I need a touch from God and so you start praying more don't we do that amen when things are rough and when our kids are backsliding well somebody say Amen tonight amen when you've you've been there you you've went through a financial difficulty and you start praying and the next thing you know you find yourself in a in a in a better job and a better car and a better house and and you just get a little cold on God Amen but you need to look up to where them apples are coming from Amen brother said don't be like that pig eating apples Under The Apple Tree and always just eating and never looking up but let us look up to where our blessings are coming from and put our faith in action again that even when the times are good let's serve God and when the times are bad let's serve God it doesn't matter what we're going through what we're not going through it's the time to put your faith in action and show the devil whose side you're on it's good to go to church when you don't need church it's good to go to church when you do need Church well can you say Amen tonight we need to put our faith in action as Abra abam seed I believe we're living below our privileges I believe we're living way down here when brother brandham taught us that there are untapped resources amen that we need to tap into and there are things that we are not attaining because we have gotten to to a comfortable level amen but I believe there needs to be a more of a fervency in our lives when we come to church anden when the spirit of God is moving in the building I want to participate in the worship and in the presence of God while he's here amen I don't want to get So Satisfied with the way my life is that I can't cry out to God even in a blessed State I want to say Lord thank you for blessing me thank you for saving my soul thank you for bringing my children to me amen and then when the bad times come you'll have a a connection there you've talked to him before and you know that you can reach out one more time and say Lord thank you for blessing me but I'm in a trial right now and then watch him come on the scene and bless you like never before anden that's the way Abraham was he'd already received blessings he had already seen the goodness of God what about you you've all seen the goodness of God in your life amen but then when he come to a place of decision where he had to serve God and put his faith in action or he had to just go ahead and say well I don't need to do that but the Lord told him to and you'll watch and when he puts his faith in action there arose a lamb I mean there was a lamb in the wilderness and and that lamb was the ram excuse me was there because brother BR said he had to be put there by God because there's no way that he would be there amen with with with with with no water and no grass up there in the top of the mountain but he said he was caught in the thicket and he said that was God's provided Ram to take his place why because of the faith of Abraham God would have never put the ram there and Abraham said I'm not going to the mountain I'm not going to sacrifice my son but God shows up when you're in obedience to his word can you say amen amen that's when we got to put our faith in action if you put your faith in action I believe you'll see the glory of God when you come to church if you if you come in faith believing that God's going to come then you don't have to worry if he's going to show up or not he'll be there he'll provide a service that you need he'll provide the word that is needed to be preached he'll provide the spirit that you need to be in for your soul that come on church we just need to believe again that God is still in the saving Soul business he's still in the healing business amen he's still God and he changes not the same God that could could provide a ram in the wilderness is the same God that can provide for you today whether it's a job or whether it's for your children well come on somebody amen we need to realize that the same God is still here and he's still working he never stops working he's still working he's still a way maker he's still God and he changes not is that okay tonight I think we just need to realize that God is good amen in the bad times he's still good and let our faith go into action Amen brother talks about him he said he said the Holy Spirit grabbed his hand and said Abraham stay your hand I know you love me why because he met the requirements of God he went where God told him to go he was in obedience to God and then God provided a way of Escape can you say amen and brother brandom said he said I don't doubt he said about that time he said he said that thing he said that RAM bleeded and he brother brandom has a little fit here he says hallelujah praise our God he said well come on somebody you know sometimes we get way too quiet in church and I know I harped on that a lot but that's because I get a lot of these Sunday afternoon Services you say brother Joel why you always preaching about people shouting in church because I have to look at you when you're in a food coma and you're all sitting there looking at me like brother Joel would you quit harping at us I will when you start shouting when you I'm sorry that wasn't in my notes so you don't have to believe it come on but you know he is the same God and you know we we tend to let me just speak for myself we tend to shout a little bit more when we see the blessings of God in our life right on but when you don't feel him he's still there Abraham didn't feel very good when he was about ready to take his son's life but he said even now you're more than able to provide a sacrifice come on somebody even in the valley that you're in today there is Faith on the inside of you that you don't even know you've got but if you would just go ahead and say I'm going to go in obedience to the word of God come on somebody amen God might put you in a place where it's where you struggle for a while I know I know you know sometimes in this area it's jobs and and you struggle maybe to get a job or you struggle you struggle to get in church because you have to drive away listen I believe if we'll just be in obedience to the word of God that God is required to back up his word I believe if we'll go in obedience and we'll say you know what I'm surrendering my will to your way I'm s I'm surrendering what I am to the to the will of God and I believe that if we'll do that and put our faith in action God will honor the faith in this bride I believe that with all of my heart I believe he will come on somebody amen I believe if God has chosen you to be here then he'll provide a way for you to be here if God has placed you here then God will give you what you have need of to make it through life's journey amen God did not promise to leave you or forsake you but he said I will never leave you or forsake you I will always be with you I will always be in you amen just let your faith go to work tonight and God will move on the scene in your situation can the church say amen amen think about think about the woman at the well if you think about her brother Ben mentioned her this morning you think about that she goes out there she wasn't even expecting to meet Jesus but when she met him she recognized him why because she was taught that he would come we were taught that he was going to come we knew that Messiah would come and tell us all these things but where is he and he said I am he I believe he'll make himself known to you if you'll just be at the right place at the right time I believe if we're waiting at the well today that he will send us amen someone that we're going to recognize his presence amen I believe tonight we need to just come to the well and realize that he is waiting by the wellside even for you tonight amen I don't care if you've been in sin I don't care if you've fallen from grace and amen the church might not have accepted you or amen the pastor maybe look at you and say well I don't know how they're going to make it amen but if you made it to the well of Grace tonight amen it was by the faith that was on the inside of you and when you recognize that God is here and his word is still true you can say Amen come see a man that changed my life come see a man I believe we ought to be on fire for God to say come see a message that has changed my life amen come see what God is doing for me amen but we've been so discouraged because of the the trials we faced and because of our past and we're looking saying lord well can you really change me can you really save me if he did it for me he can do it for you come on somebody somebody in the building has been so far removed from grace that you thought there wasn't a way back amen but you're sitting here today because Grace is good God is good and Grace is here and come on somebody listen I'm not trying to work you up tonight but you need to get praise because God has given you another chance to sit in the house of God I say God you been good to me your grace still amazes me amen your love is still running after me nothing is going to take me out because his grace his grace amen he saw in me a faith that I didn't know I had he saw in me grace mean he saw in me amen a Son of God before I ever knew there was a Son of God in Me amen and I believe with all my heart that if I put my faith in action then God is going to take care of everything else oh yeah what can you say Amen all I've got to do is do my part I can't save myself I can't do nothing to enter in but I can show up and give him myself and then God will take over amen by the faith that is on the inside of me amen The Works that I do will show that I do believe the message of the hour I will show up and do what God told me to do but it's not what's going to save me he's going to save me by his Amazing Grace because I've showed up and I'm just a vessel that he can fill ammen brother Justin God has put you here and if he put you here he provides amen when the going gets tough sometimes it gets hard sometimes it's the devil's going to attack your mind and the devil's going to attack your finances and and I know I'm not I'm not preaching about Prosperity tonight amen but you know God is is concerned about the little things in your life and God is concerned about all that you have whether it's your finances or whether it's your health well can you say man whether it's your children whether it's a church you go to God is concerned about it he cares for you but do you care for him that's it he cares he cares enough to die for you do we care enough to live for him well can you say amen and so I want to tie this into this I believe it's a seed on the inside of you that is planted a faith so the faith without works is dead that doesn't mean the faith isn't there come on but the faith is not in action come on we okay so far amen and the faith until it becomes in action is is just dead it's just there but it has never taken an action so you say I have faith I I I know people that say I believe the message you can say well I have faith I I have the faith of the message amen but they don't believe in going to church anymore and and and you can't say you can't say you love God and hate your brother come on you can't say I love God but I don't want to assemble with his people well can you say Amen you can't say I love God but but I come on well I just love preaching Sunday afternoons I plow a little bit and that takes me back to the farming days you just plow and you plow and you plow well praise the Lord I got the boys awake tonight Hallelujah y'all still okay amen there's a seat on the inside of you that you didn't put there come on it was planted on the inside of you and the the thing about it is we have to remember that there's nothing we can do in ourselves but surrender in order for that seed to mature you can't save yourself you can't baptize yourself come on there's a lot of things you can't do by yourself I guess you could baptize yourself now that I think about it technically you could dunk yourself I guess if you were in a place where there was nobody to baptize you you can do that sorry about the false Doctrine Pastor you take communion by yourself too I got to make you do something whether it's laugh cry or something you know but the truth of it is we didn't get here on our own come on the turtle on the fence post he didn't get there by himself right come on but we need to recognize who put us here and that should put a faith in us can you say Amen that should put a faith in in us that we would know that if God has brought me this far if God has put me on top the fence post then God's able to do whatever God wants to do and so that should create a faith in us that would actually say you know what I mean if the word of God says it I'm going to stake my life on it why because it's true even if I don't understand it even if I don't know how God's going to do something I believe he can do it even if and the three Hebrew children are a good example of that amen they were in the fiery furnace and he and the King had put them there amen they said well even if we go in there God is able to to to uh to to keep us from the flames and God is able to Deliver Us from the furnace God is more than able even if he's even if you've been put in a bad situation can you help me preach for a few minutes amen if God has put you in a bad or if the devil has put you in a bad situation God had to allow the situation to come so we should not lose Faith over the hard times that we've been put in we need to let our faith grow in the hard times and in the good times because if you see the blessings if you're on the fence post and God put you there then thank God for placing you on the fence post and if you can't see the blessings of God then you need to look around and say you know what I'm going to stay here and I'm going to worship God and I'm going to do what God said and I know that God is going to bless me why because his word has never returned to him void and if God has promised something to you hold on to the promise and put your faith in action and so that's the works of Faith now remember we we started out with faith without works is dead but I want you to notice that that your faith is not what saves you amen Works don't save you you can't pray your way into heaven you can't work your way into heaven if if you could do that amen the Catholic Church would have a good idea amen they could work their way and work their way and say so many Hail marries and things like that that's not what saves you amen but if you love God then you look at his word and read his word and you won't just let the letter set there but you'll apply the letter to your heart and you will obey what the word of God has already told you to do listen it's not something that we we say well if I didn't read my Bible today I'm going to hell that's not true at all if you're saved you can't be lost but if you're really saved there's going to be a desire on the inside of you to pick up your Bible and read it well can you sayen if you're really a message believer the tapes are not going to get Dusty on the shelf or you're never you're going to listen to the mess message of the hour at some point in your life you're not going to go through your whole life and say well I don't need the message no if you're a real message believer it's on the inside of you and it longs to hear the voice of the Prophet can you say amen that's right is that okay tonight you know I think that's something listen I know people in the message say we don't need the tapes anymore I'm going to go and tell you something news flash the message is a part of you you can't help but feed on [Applause] it well I don't need the message I don't need it I don't well yes you do yeah because the message is what's going to call a bride to get out of here in a Rapture well can you say amen amen I believe we've let the we've let the message get cold in our homes because we don't we don't put our faith in action but if you've really got faith that God sent a prophet in this day to call out a bride then your faith will be an action to believe what he said is that okay to speak to your mountain is the action of faith brother BR goes on down like this I'm almost out of time so I'll hurry he said now what did Abraham do he staggered not at the promises of God at the impossibilities he staggered not at the impossibilities is that Gooden so when you look at something in your life that is impossible he man we don't we don't stagger at that we don't believe that God can't do it because God can do whatever he wants to do that's right God is more than able you believe that tonight and so that's the faith of Abraham and brother Brandon would say it like this he said it makes you act funny come on well anybody else here want to act funny then you just need more faith of Abraham because brother Ram told tells us that that the reason that Abraham acted funny was because he was holding on to a promise and going around testifying of the goodness of God and saying me an old man and brother Brandon would would say it he said he would go into the and he would be be telling people you know we're going to have a baby me and Sarah's going to have a baby and and I usually pick on Bill and Sarah if I say something like this are Bill and Karen when I say something like this maybe she's already been changed to Sarah I'm not sure but I usually pick on them because they're the uh oldest in the church and uh although sister Karen's not old but I love it when I get into these situations but he says but he goes around testifying of the goodness of God and the people call him a fanatic and they say you know you're crazy for believing what you believe and and you know I'll be honest with you the world if they're not calling you crazy if you're fitting in with the world you probably ought to check your testimony yes sir because the world is is is imity with God it is not amen God and the world they don't they don't get along they don't they just don't go together amen the the ideas that the world has that the way God is and the type of love that the world says he is is just not true amen we are we are not to be we are not to be partakers of what the world thinks but we are to be partakers of what the word of God has already said amen you say I need the word I need a word from the lord well I'll tell you the word from the Lord is right here amen you say well I need to hear the voice of God I will if you'll just speak what the word says that is the voice of God speaking out of your own mouth and so tonight if you say I need something from God speak over your situation and that is just as good as God coming down and speaking himself why because it is God in you Christ in you and it is the stronger man as for the been preached this morning the strong man of the house has come down and spoke over your situation but he uses your hands and he uses your feet and he uses your voice it is God in you that is overcoming the world Amen by the faith that is already on the inside of you amen the faith is not just something amen that we talk about can you say Amen the faith is not something we think we have but it is an assurance that we have the faith in our heart and me when I was baptized I didn't know really if I if I was going to get the Holy Ghost but I believed if I did get baptized that I would receive the Holy Ghost and so I held on to that promise that I needed to be baptized and if I was baptized I would receive the Holy Ghost I didn't right then but about six months later I did and I'm thankful to God tonight that because I obeyed his word he backed up his word and gave me a desire to live out this message and the desire has never died listen you say how do I know I got it because there's a fervency on the inside of you to serve God Amen come on can you say Amen there's something on the inside of you that says I I I want to please God I want to do what the word of God says listen I'm not I'm not so legalistic that I say everybody am in the mid of the service is not a Christian I don't ever want to get that way although I am a legalist on that and everybody's told me so but but but I'm not put listen I don't put people out because of that some people can't go some people miss church some people the world is putes in place I understand all that but there needs to be a desire in your heart to obey the word yes amen the desire is one thing if you've lost the desire then you need to get back and get a refilling of the Holy Ghost if you've lost the desire I'm not saying amen that you'll never do anything wrong but your desire is to please God Amen it's not in my heart Amen to fail God and if I do fail God there's something on the inside of me an action of faith that calls me back and puts me in line with the word again that's the action of faith I'm talking about I'm not talking about your Works saving you or your Works taking you in a Rapture and but I'm talking about the works you do bear witness of the one that is on the inside of you amen Jesus would stand there and he would say the works that I do bear witness of my father and I would say today the works that you do bear witness of the faith that is on the inside of you it's the truth it's the truth if if you're if you're working for the devil then don't tell me you're in service for God Amen but if you're trying your best and yes you're falling down yes and you're making mistakes amen but there's a desire your heart to please God I say just hold on to that desire because I believe that God will come through for you and he'll move mountains for you he'll make situations me turn around for you and me he'll save the children in your family that need to come back come on somebody you need to recognize that God is still God and if the desire to serve him is on the inside of you just hold on to that desire amen that desire that is on the inside of you it is holding you until the day of your Redemption it is a seal from God Amen the people that have lost their desire we need to pray for them amen the ones that just don't they don't believe that there's anything Amen to to to attain by by doing what the word of God says amen but the word of God is Not Just A Book of Rules it is not a book of dos and don'ts amen but it is a book that shows you there is a Redemption plan and if you can find yourself in the Redemption of the open book then you'll find out that God has placed you as a son or a daughter of God and all the time every move that you make is in the plan of God and you cannot get outside of his will without God allowing you to feel something maybe it's something in your job or something in your church and God will bring you back in line with the word amen you can't serve God on your own but something on the inside of you cannot deny this message something on the inside of you has held you this far it will lead you all the way home amen this message is not something just to be looked at or talked about but it's something to be lived am man we can I saw an illustration at camp where there was a there was a man there preaching and he was he was talking about the message and he made it a guitar stand and he said that's the message and if I just set it there and I I don't pick it up or I don't use it then it doesn't do me no good I can look at the message I can talk about the message I can say I know the message but I've got to use the message I've got to pick that up and use it for its intended purpose amen this message is the word of God Amen it is to make you make you overcome in a world where all the Devils of hell are against you but greater is the strong man than all the Devils that are coming against you and me is the word of God the faith that is in you is what you need for a Rapture than you Lord that's right that little bit of faith that you can't see that little bit of faith that sometimes you can't feel is all you need because if you didn't have that Faith you wouldn't be sitting here today that's right that's right Faith brought you to church come on faith did you say well I brought myself to church sure you did you wouldn't be here if it was you come on I wouldn't be here either especially if you had to hear me especially if I had to hear me talking to myself sometimes I feel that way in the Pulpit you know Lord what am I doing up here it makes you act funny that's all I got out of that quote but you know what praise the Lord we'll keep going he said decisions are odd to the world that's right can the church say Amen am but it's a Believer no matter how strange it seems he said the Bible says that Abraham was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he said he would do and that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon amen somebody say Amen to that that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon God is able to keep every word that he said he do I don't care how little it is I don't care how big it is I don't care how impossible it seem God Specializes in the impossible yes he does and if he does that for one person he is obligated to do it for every one of us brother Lucas every person in the building it listen God cannot do one thing for Abraham and then not do it for you that's right well can you sayen Abraham was the father of Faith but it wasn't just for Abraham that is to show that you with that faith can achieve the same thing that Abraham achieved amen at one he finally got to a place amen that body had to get changed again and I'm looking for that body to be changed in my life listen church I I we're not just here to be Christians but we're looking for rapture we need to I I I think faith is one of the greatest things the church lacks today because we don't recognize the faith that we already have and so we live below our privileges you have faith but live down here worried if God's going to take care of you tomorrow come on can you say Amen but if God has given you the faith then he will take care of you thank you Lord so sometimes if it's in the will of God step out on faith if it's in the word of God do it and worry about the repercussions later you know sometimes we just need to take God at his word you say this is too simple well mostly quotes So if it's simple blame the prophet that's the reason he said I do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit of the Bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace God promised it don't care how many science how many astronauts they signed up and everything else how many million miles they can see I don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth no matter how I don't care if your grandpa preached it or your great- grandpa preached it and I don't if I become an old man I want to stand here by the grace of God and preach that he's still coming back for me because I don't believe that there's any any way that the faith on the inside of me could die because of time or die because of age I believe it is something God placed there and it is going to change my body and brother B would go on said now the unchangeable word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said God raised up bodies all down through Moses Ezekiel Jeremiah Isaiah and Elijah's all down where his word temporarily come but the full word was made manifest in this man Jesus Christ which he was God in the fullness of the godhead bodily there he was made flesh I believe that every word and he goes on down and he said Christ was God's word made manifest and he died gave his life that he might send the spirit and take his body up and send his spirit back he said he said uh to pay the redeeming price he said if we'll believe it that's it right there if you believe it he that believeth on me the works that I do he said then come the Holy Spirit upon the same word of God he said now where do you throw it upon the Bible then he said the Bible has got to be in you oh yeah what can you say man you say well we don't need the Bible anymore you've got to become one with the Bible he said the Bible has got to be in you he said and the word is a seed and as long as it's laying here it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God so if you have the spirit of Christ in you the spirit will work the same things that he did when he was here Amen brother Brandon would tie it to he said if you had the spirit of Dillinger you would do what Dillinger did if you had the spirit of uh you know all the of a murderer you would do what a murderer does or if you had a spirit of of of a painter you would do all these things listen if you have the spirit of Christ then you you will do the spirit it's not something you make yourself do but it is something on the inside of you that is overcoming that man on the outside that is trying to hold you back and you are becoming what the word says you would be in this hour and brother man would go on he said now he said now go power comes and humility comes he said he said it comes into the heart power comes humility comes remember that he said now all your know it all is gone and you become nothing and Christ becomes alive can you say amen he said I live he said he died I live he said when he lives again and he said when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself in order I can have his life and he said now how do I do it by taking his word his seed now he said put his seed in here by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said amen so the faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing of the word of God but if you'll remember the the the hearing is not alone good enough but you've got to be doers also of what you've heard amen so we pick up this message and we put it into action and say what the prophet said I'm going to do what the Bible says I'm going to do and me it's not good enough to just say I believe a message but we've got to put it into action today Church somebody's going to and somebody's going to take a body change I say let it be this little church in Hardy Arkansas where we can put our shoulder the will and say I'm going to work for the Lord I'm going to live for the Lord I'm going to be an example for the younger generation and I'm going to do what God has already told me to do I don't care if floods or high water would come I don't care what comes against me I'm going to stay in the will of God according to the word of God and the faith that is on the inside of me will act out what God has placed there amen so if you see me acting like a message believer it's because the message is on the inside amen oh yeah yeah is that right now that don't mean that you're always going to do good things and say good things because remember the flesh but when the flesh gets you down there is a desire to change you on the inside is that okay brother brandom goes on like this my time is almost up but brother Danny told me not to worry about time so we'll keep going for a minute he said nobody amens when you say that stuff brother been nobody brother Stuart that's when you say amen amen amen right there right there man we just you know nobody wants to hear about the all night prayer meetings or the six-h hour sermons on the nobody wants to hear about that I had a preacher call me the other day he was preaching and he called he bragged about a three-hour sermon he said nobody complained about it and I wasn't there so I couldn't complain about it but I would have probably brother random said now preaching the gospel was to demonstrate the power are you still with me can I have five minutes okay good I gave you a time now y'all can hold it to me and call me a liar if I don't do it he said he said it was to demonstrate so I want you to notice that taking the the Commission in closing taking the commission to preach the gospel wasn't enough on but you had to put that into action if he' said go you into all the world and preach the gospel and they would have said hey that was a good word did you hear what Jesus said he told us to go into all the world and preach the gospel well then you better have something to say and you better do what he said do come on somebody amen so if they would have just sit around and just uh talked among themselves about the words of Jesus they would have never reached nobody amen if if we do that among ourselves and we decide we're going to you know just make ourselves our little home churches and and not to offend anybody that might listen to this but but but but just make our little home churches and we're going to listen to the words of a prophet and that's good and that's we we should do that in our homes I believe we should amen but if that's all we do and we fail to fulfill the commission that is to put his words in action then church we are hearers only and not doers also of the word of God but I think it's time the church gets in action and not just talk about a message but live a message of the hour amen not just talk about the tapes but go ahead and listen to them tapes and apply the tapes to your life amen I believe we need to go ahead and say it's not just a message but it's a message living in me amen it's not just the voice of a prophet but it's the voice of the Bride that is the final a final voice to the final age it is not just a faith that is on the inside of me but it is a faith that is living out through my body and it is making my body come under the words of My Confession am man I want to use your quote again and we got to doubt our doubts tonight quit and just start doubting all the the things that have come against us and start believing that God is more than able Amen to cause all of our situations to come under his control because after all if we think we're in control then really we're not anyway right because he's just let you out here and you you get out here and you feel feel like well I'm in control of my life and and God has allowed you to be in the place you're in God has allowed you to do what you're doing amen but if you'll Surrender Your Life to God then you're no longer in control of your life but you're following after the voice that is on the inside of you and he is leading you and he's guiding you and he is making your faith come into action and your faith is no longer dead but it is a living faith in the believer that will live out the word of God in this generation I am almost done brother bam said John the Baptist expressed his faith by his works and when he said there stands among you now just think of that John said he said he said he said the Messiah is coming they they asked John you said the Messiah is coming why he said man what's the matter with you we've been looking for him for 4,000 years and he said he's standing right among you now and he said so is he tonight he expressed his faith by his revelation we heard that this morning faith is a revelation faith is something more than just an idea but it is a revelation from God and the Revelation must come from the word of God thank you Lord and so if brother B said if your Revelation outside the word he said it might sound pretty good but it's not it's not right and so if your Revelation come from God it is the word of God and that's something you can put Faith in and your faith will then act out that you really believe it can you say amen and he said he was a man 30 years old he know he had to be somewhere he had never knew that he who was who he was and there he was standing right among them and he said there's one standing among you now who you know not I'm not worthy to loose the latches on his shoes but he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and he's right among you now he expressed it his faith because he knowed that in his day he was to see and baptize God's Messiah he said so you see the people could see the expression upon him in the way he was preaching and the way he was acting was expressing that he had a true Revelation from God Amen so John couldn't just stand there waiting on it to happen but he had to express what he knew was going to happen and then it would happen because God will back up his word can you say amen Amen brother Brandon we go on down he said are you catching it he said he believed what he heard and now it was being made manifest the promise he held on to was now happening and so I want to say to you tonight the promise that you're looking for is already happening in your life but you need a positive confession that what God is promised he is able sister Patty's able to perform it amen everything you have need of God is more than able God is big enough for every situation God is still the Healer over those sick bodies God is still the Savior over the Lost Children God is still God and he changes not so what we need to recognize tonight the faith is there let's put the faith in action let it not be a dead Faith but let the faith live out through me amen I think that ought to be our prayer tonight tonight let the faith that is already in me be expressed in me can you say Amen am in closing I'll say this in closing three or four times ago I said something else but in closing this time for real I'll say this he said job know that he had done Jehovah's bidding and he had faith in what he done because Jehovah required it we can just do that Jehovah required a burnt offering for his sin and job not only for himself but for his children had made a burn offering and that's all God required you say oh might say I wish that's all he required today he said it's less than that can the church say amen back then they had to they had to they they did have to do things to be saved today you just have to have obedience to the word just to surrender so it's different today and he said now you might say I wish that's all required he said it's less than that just faith in his Worden and he said if you make his word your absolute any Divine promise in the Bible you can tie your soul to it thank you Jes I think that's what we need tonight church quit making everything else the ultimate and let's let the word of God be our ultimate put Faith in the word and then we'll start acting out what the word says to do brother brandom said he said now no matter how much the waves whip you around you're still tied to your absolute thank you Lord so tonight I want you to notice just in closing as musicians come faith is what God sees you may not even be able to see somebody else's faith we can look at people and and and judge their faith because we think well they're not getting healing or they're not getting saved or their children are backslid or well that doesn't that doesn't matter in the eyes of God because God knows your faith God knows exactly what you believe and no matter how much the waves would whip you around and toss you this way and toss you that way amen you've got to believe that he is still God but the works that we do will bear witness of the faith in our hearts amen I believe that with all my hearts can we stand together tonight I hope there was something said that was a help to you I know it's simple good if get a chance go read that whole chapter James chapter 2 read the whole thing faith without works is dead we're not saved by our works but there will be Works behind our faith do you believe it tonight I wonder if we could wonder if we could just just play something if you would and I believe God is here if you have a need tonight you say I need my faith raised I just need another touch or I just need you know sometimes we just get cold on God because we don't recognize our faith our young people sometimes don't know how much Faith they've got because they've never had to put it into action maybe like a person that's been through some trials and maybe you've had a you say well I've never had an easy life but maybe some of you have had a pretty pretty easy life and you've got by pretty good and you probably not very many people but somebody might have had an easy Road and maybe you haven't had to use your faith and then there's other people who it seems like everyday is you got to hold on by faith for everything work job your house your finances everything you know what just all maybe the devil's really hit some people he hits with in in bad health and some people he hits financially and some people it's your children some people it's the church but remember God is more than able can somebody say Amen is he able to take care of your situation he's not only able but he's more than able he's not only able but he cares about every situation you're in every heartache that you go through every trial every Temptation he knows all about it and if he cares for the sparrow and he gives a little fish as the song says just a little place to swim how much more does he care for you and me how much more does he care for your situation tonight it's not a lack of faith but it's a lack of action to your faith I say put your faith in action tonight use the faith that you've got that got you here to go further and let us bow our heads tonight if you have a need on your heart the altar is open we'll be happy to pray with you Heavenly Father Lord you see the needs of the people tonight I pray Lord you would take these broken words and speak directly to somebody's heart and Lord Jesus as we see Lord that there's you said will I find faith Lord I believe there's faith in the Believers here tonight Lord I pray you would just help us to not not bypass Faith but use Faith tonight Lord to to be an action in our lives to step out on faith to move out on Faith Lord when we need healing Lord or when we need an altar to Lord maybe we just need another touch from you help us to step on out on faith and believe that you're more than able tonight to do exactly what you're what you've said you would do help

to be enough to thank him for tonight that alone ought to be enough to praise Jus name because he's worthy is anyone worthy to open the seals he said he is worthy he is worth not a man but he's worthy of it all can you can you just lift your hands to him and say Lord you're worthy of it all tonight amen I I I don't feel like I got the faith sometimes but I'm going to use the little faith that I got and say you're worthy you're worthy of all things I wonder if we could just worship him now you know if he's worthy I think we ought to just act like he's is worthy tonight and say Lord you brought me here you placed me here you're worthy of all my praise he's worthy of your hands lifted up he's worthy of your hand clap he's worthy of your voices raised in Praise he's worthy of it all tonight oh

glory tonight can you give him a hand clap of Praise You know what if you woke up with breath in your lungs this morning he's worthy of praise for just that amen if you put a desire in your heart to come to the house of God tonight he's worthy of praise for that amen if he's if he's giving you your children he's worthy of your praise if your children are still gone but you believeing in your heart that they're coming back he's worthy of all praise and all glory and me praise him like he's already done it praise him like the walls have already fallen down praise him like the shackles have already fallen I think it's time that the church tonight praise your way out of the gloom and doom of the world praise your way out of the situations that are holding you back what you're going to find if you'll praise him he loves to be praised and worshiped and he'll show up in your situation tonight I think we ought to just let the chains fall off and worship him here tonight brother Joel are you trying to work us up no I believe he's worthy and we ought to participate in worshiping a God who is so good to us he's worthy of his of all the praise he's worthy if he's worthy then we ought to praise him like he's worthy we ought to act like he's worthy he's worthy a prophet wasn't worthy a prophet wasn't worthy a preacher ain't worthy but he's worthy he's worthy and if he's worthy church then you you say well that I believe that the spirit of leoty has crept into our services to where we can't worship him like we want to and we've been hurt by somebody that was over emotional or fanatical I say it's not heresy to worship God but in that way is the way we will worship God you can call us crazy you can call us Pentecostal you can call us whatever you want to but I want you to know something when he calls us on that Resurrection morning we're going to be gone we're going to be changed he's worthy for giving us that promise he's worthy of it we we ought to just take a I tell you what we ought to just take a break right now and just worship Him you say I got to get home is he Worthy is he worthy did he bring you back sister Stephanie he's worthy brother Harold if you're here even though you were diagnosed with lukemia a year ago you're here he's worthy he's worthy Brother David you almost died during Co but you're here he's worthy he's worthy you Lord you know the devil gets enough Glory out in the world I think we ought to give some glory to God in the house of God I just feel this on my heart because I believe that we might as well go ahead we might as well just go ahead and worship God because you know we can worship a lot of things we can get excited over a ball game we can get excited over a lot of things we can get excited over over over over a million things you can name him off and you get excited all down through the week over them and they're good things to be excited about but is he Worthy and if he's worthy he ought to get all of our praise and all of our Glory it belongs to him you know sometimes we get scared because the person next to us you think well they're going to judge me for shouting they're going to judge me for clapping my hands listen we're not doing it for the person next to you he's worthy the person next to you I don't care if they like it or not is he worthy sometimes we just need to lift our voices and say thank you Jesus for the grace that you've given me thank thank you Jesus for the message of the hour thank you for loving me thank you for saving me he gave his life I'm going to give mine for him

ought to act like he's worthy tonight Church listen you know he's been good to us on the worst days he's been good to us I know I said I'd quit and I have this is all free but you know what we do sometimes we can take a good service and we can make a formality out of it or we can let the devil hinder us service and we can stop short of our blessing that God has given us while we come and sometimes we're not getting enough out of it because we're not willing to say Lord you're worthy of every breath I take you're worthy of every step I can take you're worthy of the fact that I can sit in this church tonight and raise my hands some people can't do it but you can you can and you know why you can do it because there's something on the inside of you that defies the law of gravity that raises that hand up and says Lord you're worthy of it all you're worthy of it all you know you can look around and you say we don't see Miracles I'm looking around at Miracle after miracle in this building I I can point you to Miracles if you need to see Miracles but you know what the greatest Miracle of all was that he saved my soul and if you can testify that miracle in your life tonight
