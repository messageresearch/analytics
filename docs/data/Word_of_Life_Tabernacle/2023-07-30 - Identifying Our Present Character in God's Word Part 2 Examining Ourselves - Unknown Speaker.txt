unspoken requests you'd like to make known we've uplifted a hand I know God sees every hand this morning I just feel the presence of the Lord here I believe he's here to meet those needs you just hold those before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord you're so good to us what would we do without you where would we be without your presence oh Lord we thank you for the spirit that we feel here this morning

tongue Lord that I would only say those things that you would have me say Lord I pray for these requests Lord you know the secret of every heart Lord You're the discerner you are the word which is a

granted Lord Oh how we love you today meet every need we pray Lord we thank you for healing we thank you for salvation Lord and we're believing again this morning Lord we need you father we need you to move we need you to to be here with us Lord if you're not here with us what good is it together together but we're so thankful for your presence you promise to be here and you're here this morning we thank you for that we ask you to bless this service now Jesus name [Music] amen amen Matthew chapter 7 and verse 1 we're going to continue talking about how we examine ourselves in the mirror of God's word finding our present character in the mirror of God's word and that's what we need it's what we have to have is our present character examined and so we want to do that today now Matthew 7 1 we read that last week but as you're turning there I I just want to say that I got a good report this week and thankful for that and thankful for the good report from Brother Gabe and praise the Lord I I believe the Lord is is working he's still a Healer do you believe that amen so I want to welcome brother Justin sister Lana here this morning with us as well God bless you guys if you don't know them it's the family back here on this side almost all the way to the back I don't want to embarrass you this morning but God bless you guys for being here and we've had yes we've had good fellowship with them over the last couple of days and thank you for coming they're come from across the river and in Tennessee so we appreciate them being here this morning and so let's go to Matthew chapter 7 and verse 1. judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again why behold us thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but consider us not the being that is in thine own eye we found out last week that moat is a speck or a little bit grain of dust a splinter and the beam is like a rafter it's a log to the how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated there was a saying during the French Revolution that the revolution eats its own children and what they meant by that is that insecure political leaders always have to have enemies because they're always they gained power through uh through means that were not exactly legal and so they always have to have enemies in order to because they're always afraid that somebody's going to take that power from them and so when the French Revolution the leaders of that gained power they began to eat one another in other words they begin to Guillotine one another they they begin to destroy one another and in doing that that it actually implodes on itself and they ended up with the King again and and losing everything that they had gained in that and all it did was was a bunch of Bloodshed and a lot of murder I'll say this I I pray that our message never comes to that where where people are just constantly devouring one another as we know that Paul said if you if you bite and he said if you're constantly biting one another take heed that you don't devour one another and so we need to be careful that we don't do that because if once we set ourselves up as the answer as the ultimate and we and we put no mirror on ourself we we have no ability to look at ourselves and and examine ourselves and see whether we're in the faith or not and so we're always looking at other people and seeing what they're doing wrong we've all met people like that sometimes we're like that and we need to turn the mirror on ourselves and be able to see what we're doing and what we need well we need to check up what we need to to be better at yeah and so during that Revolution that eventually no one was pure enough because it's the nature of of heresy or or something that's false it goes out on a limb somewhere eventually no one's pure enough and no one does it good enough and no one walks the road just like they want them to walk it and eventually they they just slay everybody and you don't have a church no more you don't have but remember God didn't call us to be perfect in in this flesh he called us to be mature children of Jesus Christ he called us to be filled with the spirit of God to be filled with the perfect one amen the word he's the only perfect one now but eventually the enemy even if it's of their own kind that's what they did during that Revolution they began to destroy each other and they could not see that the real problem was in the mirror oh God help us today this is why that a person filled with bitterness should never attack the object of that bitterness huh yeah right if you've got bitterness now I'm gonna just preach where we live this morning if that's all right a person with bitterness should never attack or should never judge or should never should never lash out at a person the object of their bitterness you say well I have some legitimate complaints but you can't complain legitimately they may be legitimate complaints but you're not complaining legitimately because you got a rafter in your eye you've got something you haven't forgiven you you've got things that just aren't right and and so you're not complaining legitimately about that person until you get rid of that being that bitterness in your own eye so he says he the person loses all ability both to see clearly and to help the brother oh my so now and again now if you did not have the ability to warn properly if you're warning you knew that you're warning somebody about something would only result in them doubling down would only result in them getting worse why would you do it in the first place yeah right but it's because it flows from a place of bitterness so this is what Jesus is talking about he's not saying well we shouldn't judge anybody in the sense that you can wear what you want to be go where you want to do what you want to and nobody should be able to say anything about it that's not what Jesus is saying at all he's saying before you comment on somebody else's life before you begin to talk about what some other church is doing you need to take a big mirror a full-length mirror right in front of you and be able to see what you are get the beam out of your own eye yeah very easy to turn the mirror of God's word on everybody else that's right that's right right it's very easy to take and look and say brother so and so here's what they're doing brother so and so here's what they're doing but what about me yeah what about our church how can we do better now I you just forgive me Church why is it that always our enemies that brother bam talks in identification about about identifying ourselves with a character in the word of God he said that was holding up a mirror to ourselves yeah right to do that why is it that we always identify our enemies as Balaam and us as Moses wait wait why can't I be I I said that one time why can't I be Moses once in a while you'd be Balaam you know why is it that the person that's always that that's making an enemy's list always is the good one right why are they always the good one and why are they always the one that don't make any mistakes and but that's just human nature that's just the way that we are but now you find that they're always Balaam they're always Micaiah and the person is always the 400 prophets that they're against right and David they're always uh when they when they come to David and and the new cart they're always with Nathan and and David is always the one that's against that's uh the one that got it wrong and they're the other Church huh and so we always make our we always make Ahab the enemy and we're we're with Elijah I want to present a little bit different idea to you today first off Romans 14 and 4 said who art thou that judgeth another man servant Romans 14 and 4. who art thou the judges another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or followeth yea he shall be holding up for God is able to make him to stand right so now what he's saying is that there's there's something about we want to judge everybody else but we need to recognize that they answered to God not to us and it doesn't mean that wrong doesn't need to be dealt with it does need to be dealt with sometimes there is a situation we need to go against a new cart right or we need to speak to somebody who's going with the majority doing something wrong sometimes that situation is relevant but you better get the beam out of your own eye before you start judging somebody else right now look there's a little bit it's a little bit different maybe but there's a little bit of both in all of us a little bit of David and a little bit of Nathan a little bit of Balaam a little bit of Moses because we live in flesh we have a body soul in spirit so if we would correctly identify many times without any our actions we wouldn't just identify well these people are this and those people are that just like people do today well that's a Democrat that's the Republican that one's good that one's bad whichever side of the persuasion you fall on but if you can see beyond that and see the person themselves and and see you begin to realize there's good and bad right there's good and bad there's good and evil there's a True Vine and a false fine that don't mean we do away with the true church because there's a false Church there's going to be a true and a false there's going to be a mixed multitude in every Revival there's going to be a there's going to be a an unbeliever A make-believer and A real believer in every church but I would that every one of us would say Lord let me be the real belief instead of trying to identify all the rest of them let me be the real believer but I'll say this you have a make-believer and an unbeliever right here your flesh is an unbeliever your spirit is a make-believer but the soul is a Believer and that's why you struggle sometimes somehow you know what's right to do but you struggle doing it that's why Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death but what was it there was a Believer on the inside that's why you're here this morning there's a Believer on the inside that's why you're struggling for for truth that's why you're reaching out for something real there's a Believer on the inside no no don't assume your serpent seat because your flesh doesn't want God flesh never once God now look good good there's a little bit of both in all of us and some humility would help you recognize that the gospel works by self-examination without looking in the mirror this is important this morning not because I'm saying it but because it's God's word it doesn't work without self-examination we've got to be able to see ourselves that's why as we said last week sometimes it takes a minister takes a preacher to take the mirror of God's word they're not changing the mirror they're just taking and putting it squarely in front of us so we can see and sometimes it takes it takes a Ministry of God's word to stand there and put it right in front of us and so it's because we would hold it like this and we would put a little bit different where somebody else might we say well I look pretty good like that I I look pretty thin I like we said last week I look pretty good but if you could only have somebody else take the mirror and put it right in front of you you'd let you know it lets you know what you really look like but but in self-examination ultimately that that we have to do to to be able to make the gospel work we want the gospel to work don't we we don't want it just to be an idea God forbid that this message would be just an idea that what a prophet gave his life for in serving and doing all those things and and preaching to us 1100 tapes or 1200 that they found and what he did over the years over the decades that all of that and then all the work that's been done since all the brothers and sisters that have gone on that have worked so hard to promote this message and bring it to the people and build churches and do the things they've done God forbid that we would just reach a place where where it didn't matter anymore it was just an idea it was just another Doctrine it was just another saying it was just something you something you were a part of like you were Jehovah's Witness or a Baptist or something else God forbid who he would fall to that but the message is a living reality it's a life that's lived it's not something that that you go that you are sent to this in your mind say well I believe it but brother that's not enough it's got to be a token that comes back on the believer so let's go to First Corinthians 11 28 and this is a little bit odd because it's a communion scripture the Justin and I were discussing communion last night but I had this in my notes that because it talks about self-examination and we'll have communion next week the Lord willing next Sunday night but listen to what Paul says he said let a man examine himself let a man examine himself when you come to the communion table you don't examine your wife you don't examine your family you don't examine the preacher you don't examine the church you come by yourself and you examine yourself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for either eatest and drinketh unworthily eat us and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and watch it is self-examination that makes the body work properly yeah right so sometimes that's why you go see a specialist right if there's something wrong in your body you can go to a general a doctor a general practitioner but he's going to refer you to a specialist he's going to say you need to go to the hearts Festus you need to go to the lung specialist why does he do that because that person specializes in a certain part of the body because you need to examine that part in order for the whole body to be whole you're a part of the body you're not all of the body I'm not all of the body this church is not all of the body but we are a part of the body and in order for the body to be well oh we've got to examine ourselves again not my brother not my sister not my husband not my wife myself now watch for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world aren't you glad he loves you aren't you so glad he loves you enough that he doesn't let you go without it he'll he'll he'll cause you he'll cause conviction to come in your heart you'll cause things to happen in your life he'll bring you to him it's a tender hand of Jehovah moving you to the word of God brother random says what are you and this is in 1965 in communion he said you're a Christian you live before everybody as a Christian and if you take that and don't live as a Christian you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're putting a stumbling block in someone else's way now watch as they see you trying to do this and then not living what you're supposed to live brother random thought that communion was a showdown that you are you're presenting yourself as a Christian you're standing up there and saying I don't lie no more I don't steal no more I don't do those things say well I did that yesterday you repent first right and then you take communion but you're standing there it's you're examining you say I've examined myself and I'm a Christian oh my it's important because now he said if not you're putting a stomach in somebody else's way now watch if it's okay to take communion by yourself then this scripture is meaningless all right a quote that's meaningless it doesn't mean anything yeah because it wouldn't hurt the body for you to take communion if you didn't tell nobody and it defeats the purpose of communion brother said the first purpose of communion is fellowship yeah yeah right so now when you come together and you take to me the reason we do it publicly is because it's just like baptism we if we can we baptize people in front of as many people as we can I had a person request one time to be baptized privately and I'll say that the person was just shy but I told him if you can't be baptized publicly you probably shouldn't be baptized right because you really haven't buried yourself because baptism is a public show well so is communion it's showing that you're living as a Christian that you're part of the body so you don't have to discern the Lord's body to take communion alone right right but watch this when we take this he said it shows to the church that I believe every word of God how many say Amen to that today it shows to who it shows the church right I believe that he's the bread of life that come from God out of heaven believe every word he says is the truth how many can say Amen to that today I live by it to the best of my knowledge God being my judge therefore before my brothers before my sisters listen I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it embarrass me record are you with me now you're Discerning the Lord's body he said he said therefore before you I take the parcel of his body to know that I am not condemned with the world see there you are he said then it's a blessing I've known people who are always afraid to take communion I'm not preaching on communion this morning but just to give us an idea of what it means to examine ourselves I know people that all their life they're afraid to take communion they'll Miss communion service because they their heart condemns them all you got to do is make it right all you got to do is say to be covered by the blood of Jesus Christ and don't do it anymore walk away from it you say well I can't do that he'll help you do it yes sir he will heal you he will help you he will walk with you yeah that's good and then it'll be a blessing to you again he said the discernment of knowing that you are the Lord's body this is important you can't discern it in wickedness and sin we've got to be above that yeah he said that we discern that the Lord is righteous we discern how many have discerned today that he's righteous we deserve that he's our propitiation what are we doing Discerning the body well I love a prophet I love how he puts these things he said we discern he's our propitiation you see my brother Ben you failed lastly but I'm discerned he's my propitiation what that means is he took my place that all of our sins we've confessed and we believe in him of waiting upon his atonement to cleanse us from all our iniquity then we're Discerning the Lord's body to what it's discernment of what it's for right you're Discerning the body of the Lord is for me it was broken for me that blood was spilled for me he's my propitiation He's My Sacrifice Hallelujah and then he said Discerning again that in among us as the Lord's bride body let's discern if there's anything wrong with us in here that would hinder the gospel from growing or the Lord from presenting us before God as a chaste virgin now again not not Discerning your brother or your sister was there anything wrong in the church is there anything wrong with my brother is there anything wrong no when we come to the communion table the pastor deserves himself and the congregation discerns themselves the deacons discern themselves in the trustee no one is above this right we discern one another oh my and it brings us on an equal playing field because the ground is level at the foot of the cross there's no big eyes and little Hues but it brings us together before God look let's discern he says that out right now and find if it's wrong let's confess it if it's wrong let's say Lord I'm sorry about that so therefore there might be something that we've done you've done something I've done it might not be consciously right now let's ask God to forgive us for it or if we come to every service not just community service if we come that way yeah let me discern the Lord's body today let me discern what it means for me let me discern my place in it and what it would mean if if I was in some secret sin and it would hinder the body Lord let me be clean now the word examine means to approve after testing I like that to approve after testing so you don't just approve yourself but you test yourself first to see if you should be approved it's an old term comes from testing gold if we examine ourselves he says if we prove ourselves and then we test ourselves to see that we should be approved so we're not just approving because it's us there's some folks that the uh it's right because they said it we talked about that not long ago it's right because I said so but that's not the way we approach the gospel it's not right because I said it it's not right because some other person said it it's not right because your favorite preacher said it or somebody else said it's right because it's the word of God it's true the truth is it stands on its own yes now if we examine ourselves we won't be led astray we don't have to worry about being led astray you say brother Ben I'm worried worried that some preacher might deceive me and sometimes we you know even here in the Pulpit well I I don't let blatant false Doctrine here in the Pulpit but sometimes out of Brotherly Love we'll have somebody preaching maybe they preach something a little different from our idea maybe maybe it would be right or maybe be wrong I'm afraid of being deceived well let me rest your mind for a moment you know what the antidote to being deceived is to examine yourself the antidote to being deceived is not to examine the deceiver right listen to me I'm afraid I'm being deceived by people I'm afraid people are taking me uh taking me and they're not doing right by me examine yourself if you examine yourself you can't be deceived many times I spent 15 years in the Land Title industry and I had to get enough confidence in my own work that when somebody that had more experience than me maybe there was even an attorney or something like that that went to law school when they would try to tell me something was so but I had examined my own work to a point where I knew that what I did was right not because they said it was right but because it was just the right thing I had done the work myself I wasn't relying on some third party doing it I was relying on some other title company I examined it myself and I knew that this was the case and I had a confidence in my own ability in that to be able to do that listen that's the place we got to get as a Christian not that you examine every false Doctrine out there but you need to examine yourself and see am I a Christian am I in the word am I the bride he said the bride would not be deceived let me examine my own life and I'll see that there that there'll be no false Doctrine that'll be received by me are you with me so far damn in yourself are you are you weak unable you just follow everything that comes along about by every wind of Doctrine where's the doctrine will be there but examine yourself again we try so hard to make sure that what comes across the spoken is the word of God I'm a man and you need to remember that yeah if you don't remember it I'll remind you of it I fear there's some there's some some things I fear as a minister one of the things I fear is a minister getting mistaken for an absolute I am not the absolute what God Said is the absolute what God spoke is the absolute we went through that that's the absolute that's what we stand on what God Said and sometimes I speak what God said because I speak the word right but you have to discern yourself right and in order to take that word in because I'm a human being huh so is everybody else that you have respect for the dangerous place we get to a place we just accept whatever somebody says because of who they are yeah you're you're in danger of deception at that point because you just accepted it because oh he's the pastor he must be right he he's somebody I respect I've seen him over the decades over the years but that man could be as wrong about that as anything else because he's subject to error brother random said that Joseph was the most perfect type of Christ that there could be they said God let him make one mistake when he lied and and they said that what they lied about what they were he said let him make one mistake they're in Egypt in order to show us that it wasn't him it wasn't Christ every man makes mistakes but we're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that today we're covered by the blood now Paul the Corinthians weren't sure that Paul was telling them the truth are you okay this morning I'm taking this kind of slow but I just want to drive it home as we're building where we want to go this morning in second Corinthians 13 3 said since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me which to you word is not weak but is mighty in you so he's saying it ought to be proof enough that what I've said resulted in you becoming Christians right the word working ought to be proof he said for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God now watch he what he's saying is it's mighty in you he said for we also are weaken him but we shall live with that with him by the power of God towards you so they had accused Paul of being weak they had accused he said well he's only got one code he keeps getting thrown in prison he keeps getting beaten up and so by natural standards he was weak the same accusation comes to the message of the hour today people said well the bride is weak the people are weak there's all kinds of trouble that's what they said about Israel too but they didn't see a Brazen serpent they didn't see it they didn't see a shot of the king in the camp they couldn't see those things but they said Paul you're weak your ministry is over and he wrote back he says I examine yourselves oh my if you want to know whether what I'm telling you is the truth examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own self know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you attempted to be reparation I love how Paul turns it right back on him he says don't examine me or my Ministry he said that's been evidently proved among you examine yourself right he said just examine Yourself by the word the random speaking he said by the message examine Yourself by the message examine what a real Christian should be rugged loving and we're going to get down where we live now he said not one of this modern Christianity it's soft flexible half dead rotten inner bread just quote he said see it's not real Christianity live any kind of way and belong to church he said don't you want that sweet fellowship with Christ I don't want to hurt you this morning that's not what I might my aim is to do but I want you to have that sweet Fellowship in Christ and you're not exempt from living right because you go to Word of Life Tabernacle or you claim to believe in a prophet or because you've been in a message for 50 years there's still got to be a communion between you and God don't you want that sweet fellowship with Christ he said the Holy Spirit the Conformity of your own heart to the word oh God help us today okay can't you can we just tune out everything else for a little bit and examine ourselves by prophet's words can we just do that for a moment could I encourage you to do that he said as I told you a while ago listen to what I say oh God listen to what I say listen close he said Look Back Down examine yourself with the word and see where you're at yeah you said you women that's got short hair let her grow you're wearing shorts take them off act like a lady you mean still smoking cigarettes running the pool hall stop it he said I don't care how much you profess if you're still holding that organization and saying this is it and this is it he said you better stop yeah come on now you got your faith in your organization instead of in Christ brother Brown said if you were a Christian and we're part of the Catholic church he said if you put your faith in Christ you'd still be saved but if you put your faith in the church you'd be lost could we could we bring that up to today because you go to Word of Life Tabernacle does not mean that you're saved listen to me young people listen to me children because you go here does not mean that you're saved you've got to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ if you're still holding that organization and saying this is it and this is it you better stop look back down examine it with the word he said we ought to have lived above the short hair and all come on he said this age now we're back into something now that God is revealing the Hidden Mysteries had been put on the book before the foundation of the world and those who have obeyed in these small things there's a reason why there's no Revelation when you find the people who are disobedient in the small things there's no Revelation why is there no revelation God won't honor it yeah he said those who have obeyed in these small things will catch it in these other things oh my you thought it didn't mean nothing because you lived for God and treated your business associates right and didn't run people down and didn't talk about them and didn't gossip and because you lived a Godly sincere life you thought well I'm not much of a Christian but you didn't realize you were preparing yourself for the revelation of the Rapture in our hour by doing that you're preparing yourself to receive from the message you could not receive from it if you weren't obedient in these little things he said if they haven't it'll go over the top of their head as far as the East is from the West haven't we seen that brother Joel how many times people that are disobedient in small things it goes right over the top of their head they're unable to catch it yeah see we must look in the mirror and discern our position in Christ where do we sit where does the bible say that we sit today we sit in Heavenly places in Christ how many know that today Ephesians 2 60th raised us up together and made us to sit together together right yeah in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he has raised us up into Heavenly places Heavenly atmospheres now brother Brown says this he said do you get what I mean he's talking about that scripture he said that we are dead that you already raised with him that's the earnest of our Salvation we're sitting together in Heavenly places he said Look Back to the places you come look what's going on examine yourself take inventory take you ever seen them do an inventory in a store I'd walk around with a machine counting every little item why did they do that because if you leave the little things off make a profit yeah right you have to inventory every item because the it's the little foxes that spoil the vine so he said we should take inventory again that's not the job of anybody else but our own job come on now it's not our job to sit as judges of our brothers and sisters huh come on to watch as they come through the door we won't preach for a minute and get back to it and look at them and say well their dress is too short it's not our job examine yourselves well there I'll tell you what that sister last week she was a blonde examine yourself are you hearing me today tell me yourself hey well brother so and so I I saw his truck down at the place I heard a story about the man that this woman kept telling stories about where he had parked his truck overnight and she just kept she just wouldn't wouldn't be quiet and so he finally took his truck and parked it outside her house and left it that'll stop it examine yourself well brother brothers so-and-so would would do a better job when he come in and had a better attitude than we all would would do better examine yourself examine yourself this doesn't work by examining each other it works by examining yourselves examining heart cells he said look what's going on take inventory see have I bypassed his word I know the Bible says that but I don't believe it that way be careful he said you're not dead yet if the Holy Spirit was in there he would say amen that's my word well I believe the days of Miracles has passed you do and the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe that the science of Mark 16 was for another generation you do and he said these signs shall follow them that believe how far to the end of the world oh I'm with you always and the works that I do so you do also how long to the end of the world examine yourself examine what you believe what do you believe about the message of the hour what do you believe I tell you what it's a good thing when you lay your head down on your pillow at night brother Jeff you've examined yourself and you say I may not be I may not have been the best person I may not have done all of everything right but I've examined my life and I've been covered by the blood of the Lamb I believe the message of the hour not because my church teaches it but because I believe it there ain't no internet going to sway me there ain't no there ain't no person outside going to sway me I know in whom I have believeth and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep what I've committed to him against that day do we have anybody like that in here this morning you say I know and whom I have believed I know I believe the message of the hour I know I'm a Child of God examine yourself it's not to beat you up it's not to make you feel bad examine yourself so you know so you can have a smile in church once in a while so you can believe so you can live for God so you can walk with him as the children of the father he said he don't want you to be frowned he don't want you to be unhappy he wants you to live before him like children oh my yeah it's difficult to examine yourself but it's good for you but the parent talks about the castor oil you all know the story he said that you support castor oil down with us it was km remember the km Where's Becky you remember the km Becky's back there she is over there the km we had this bottle it was a miracle drug it wasn't a drug it was it was oil is what it was it looked like it tasted like like engine oil don't ask me how I know that had that consistency if you drank a cup every day you were going to be all right but it was nasty it was awful I can still taste it it was awful but they said it worked so we drank it I'll say as long as I drank it I never went to the doctor maybe that's what happened that's it was km it said it was a miracle it worked and so we took it not because we enjoyed it but because it was good for its oh are you with me today we got something it's not made up by some quack somewhere it's not some story or some marketing tool but we've got a word that you can live by that's been examined by God himself he swore by him himself he proved his own word and he took the toxin himself and he said it works because you I live you live also oh could we oh that ought to give us something to shout about this morning because I live you live also the works that I do so you do also taking it and it works it may be hard but it works brother benefit I think that's the way with preaching the gospel if it don't stir you up a little bit get feel your spiritual gastronomic started right make you a little sick to examine yourself with the Bible see if that old temper and selfishness ungodliness love of the world television and things at night leaving the church said empty the Pew said empty how can people not be convicted by that but we live in an age where there's no conviction because nobody preaches it but I want to I want there to be one place in the world but the bill where people still preach the gospel whether it's still a preacher preaching it and a People receiving it lest there be one place in the world I believe there's more than that but let there be at least one and we never fail to hear the gospel preach across the pulpit yeah leave the church empty and you ought to be out there like Jesus he said you got his spirit in you time to get everybody in the country to come to your church to receive Christ you say brother Ben your meetings were full is packed out must be must be something wrong with it nonsense the preacher preached that the other day and just God help us what are we coming to it's nonsense because everybody wants to come it's nonsense I'll say this we're pretty small we're too small to fuss too small to divide you can only divide so many times before you cease to exist you're not a body anymore God help us today God help us to put up with one another yeah God help us to examine ourselves well because everybody comes that makes it wrong nonsense I would that every person would come that's what a prophet of God said we call ourselves in the bride of Christ what a Pity friend I'm just reading quotes the bride is Washed by the Water of the word here what she examines herself makes herself ready because she does not stand before the white Throne judgment aren't you glad for that because in the in that light brother Ben talked about that evangelist and stood in that light and he said I could think of things that I had done but we will not stand before the wife don't judge me yeah why will we not stand there and have every little bit of our life examined because we're judged here we're judged here that's what church is for that's what a preacher is for that's what the body is for yeah we judge ourselves under the atmosphere of the word under the preaching of the word under listening to the tapes under under the messenger of the hour under all of those things we are examined by the word yeah we do not hold the mirror to ourselves and say well I look pretty good but we let the word of God be itself and stand before us with no with with no filter and say let me look squarely in the word and if I won't look at it squarely maybe somebody there to hold it that'll put it right in front of me declare to me the word of God Paul says no you're not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life we've got to learn to judge righteously and we can't do that Jesus said before we judge ourselves first the death doesn't change who we are only change is our dwelling place and we know that today Moses and Elijah will still be prophets brother Branham taught us on the other side he said the Jews only believe their prophets and come forth with a sign of the prophets and their work will be that of the Prophet for they did exactly he said showing one thing he said that man when you die or whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change listen now if you're a liar now you'll be a liar there if you're a hot-headed here you'll be headed there if you're a doubter here you would be a doubter there men and women it's time to shake yourselves to examine yourself see where we're standing for death does not change it whom I Paul says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees make straight paths for your feet you know if I've got to examine if I've got to examine myself what is what is the church for well the church provides me a place to do that and an atmosphere to do it in and then the church is there for support the church is not there to push me down the church is not there to keep me back in the pit but the church is there to lift me up he said if there's any weak among you let him be supported by the people let him be supported by the church by the ones that are strong if you think you're strong he said take heed lest you fall and make sure that you support those that are weak make straight paths for your feet oh that's what we want to do this morning let's sat with this let him be turned out of the way but rather be healed follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently looking diligently because the one thing we don't want bitterness to come in and divide us looking diligently lest any man feel of the grace of God that's any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled unless there be any fornicator or Pro profane person as he saw or for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright examine yourself for a root of bitterness why is the root of bitterness a problem because that root produces fruits of bitterness separation brother Brown said organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship yeah it makes bitterness when we lose our love when we lose our reason for going to church it just becomes organization and organization breeds hatred you want to know if something's a denomination or not you want to know if it's got a denominational mindset we know there won't be a denomination made out of the Bride but there's many mindsets for that as many spirits of that around and if you want to know something's like got that denominational mindset does it breed hatred does it breed division it makes bitterness that's what myrrh means what Smyrna was full of bitterness root of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilement was coming in yes yes that's what happens with the root once the root comes up if it gets to spread oh God let me not be a root of bitterness I'm examining myself this morning help me Lord not to be a root of bitterness standing in the pulpit come on now that would defile many because who could defile more than a pastor yeah who took a root of bitterness and begin to preach in bitterness to the people who could defile more than someone who calls themselves a Christian who had a root of bitterness who had a bad experience and so they treat everybody like their dirt I'm not gonna preach all day I promise the bitterness was coming up in every age with Philip scarves you realize that root of bitterness and our lives every generation if the Lord terries fulfill the scars of that believe it I've said this before don't be in a situation that makes you hate somebody yeah yeah if you have to get out of that situation get out of it before you hate people yeah [Music] don't don't stay in that deal with your own Spirit first then go back and help your brother yeah we know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth of its kind every promise will oh I'm so glad for that I don't want to root of bitterness I want a seed of God growing inside of me the word of God growing inside of me he said what it promised if it strikes the right ground the ground is prepared ready all the Rocks has been thrown out the roots the bitterness selfishness indifference jealousy has all been grubbed out that root of bitterness that Springs up that's sometimes so spoils the thing that God is trying to do we pray God that that won't be among us but that the good word will find good ground in these examine ourselves I'm not pointing this at anybody else to this morning God forbid that I would do that let's examine ourselves and see if the fruit we're producing is right examine Yourself by what a prophet said or the light that's shown on the word for the hour brother said now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open how you honor you all know this but I I just it's just on my heart this morning let's make sure that that root doesn't come come in and begin to spread out it's not important anymore it is important to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray and yeah he said because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or assorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another by this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have loved one for the others I try to stay right together it's a brother you think he's a little wrong with her sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bidder to spring up listen if that person's already bitter it doesn't help for you to become bitter too it's got a text this morning from somebody a good brother good good brother in another state another area of the country and he'd been quiet for a while and I wondered what was wrong well maybe maybe doesn't like me no more you know we'd worked together in the past been buddies maybe you don't maybe he's heard something he doesn't like it I just left him alone I tried to call him a couple times and I didn't get him left him alone I got a text from this morning said brother whatever I did forgive me I'm like you didn't do anything I thought I'd done something but what it was we just failed to make it a priority to talk that's what ruins marriages so many times Earth relationships I've been told by preachers don't text me back don't call me don't try to get a hold of me I'll block your number well how can we ever fix it how can we do that I don't I don't want you to be hurt I want you to be helped I realize I can't help you alone but I need to in order to help this situation I gotta we gotta we gotta make this right we gotta talk I've told my kids don't ever do don't ever think that you can do anything that would make it so that would be so bad that you can't talk to your dad about it I don't care what you do I don't care how far you go I don't care what happens don't ever think that you can do anything that I wouldn't talk to you about it I won't get mad I made them this promise I won't get mad it may bother me but I'm not gonna get mad I'm not gonna yell at you if you got something serious I found that sometimes the little things irritate me but if it's something serious they want to talk to me about come to me I want you to come to me I want I want to talk to you about it I want to come the Bible say let us reason together let's talk about it let's not push them out there somewhere let's talk about it here in the church let's talk about it some of the funny feeling comes up for some let's talk about it there's nothing so bad you say well the church doesn't love me no more nobody cares about me let's talk about it yeah don't sit up by yourself and start to catch a straggle away from church said well no one notices me maybe because you made yourself scarce yeah if no one's noticing you get on the front row and said praise God I'm gonna be a Christian if nobody notices me if nobody cares about me and I'll tell you what people start caring yeah sometimes it's just busyness of life just we just get busy and we forget people right Come and Talk but then on the internet reading stuff about the message come talk to me about it don't don't sit there and feed on that stuff there's answers for those things yes come get it come talk about it yeah yeah that's what we're here for if you think he's a little wrong he said that root of bitterness brings up he said it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred brother Caleb I just found a use for Schrodinger's cat talking about that theory last night you know if a cat's in a box I think I think I mentioned that to you before the cat's in the box and there's a there's some kind of radioactive material in the box and it's going to kill the cat but once he's in the Box you don't know if he's alive or dead so he exists both alive and dead at the same time that's a lot but that's the theory anyway he's a Quantum cat he lives in Two Worlds at the same time you realize that if those poison acids are in you unchecked you're already dead you don't know it but maybe just a little thing and it just come out but you don't realize if you don't arrest that if some because if things exist in a constant state of flux until something changes until they become reality you've got to have there's got to be reality to forgiveness or you will go the wrong way you're already dead and you don't realize it yeah foreign acid will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you to run in from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God drive it away from me or hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just whack so much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified Minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing another Vision just set buckles on the whole armor of God pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one could we do that this morning say my sayings about one another and then God will bless you examine yourself examine myself am I in the faith see the Pentecostal lady in church could not do that he said because I'll say It's Time rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked brother said back to a Pentecostal inheritance he's preaching these Pentecostal people at a zoo sister Tabernacle he says back to the Pentecostal inheritance yes sir that's your possession denomination is not your possession Pentecost is your possession not a Pentecostal organization your father's come out of such a thing he said the Pentecostal experience is your possession it fails do we have that Pentecostal are you with me now do we have that Pentecostal experience examine ourselves Oh my he said the the sounding of the trumpet what kind of a trumpet the word God's trumpet the holy ghost in the word the trumpets are sounding Now's the Time to examine yourself the trumpet of God's word the message of the hour have a certain sound I know we're the elect of God I know we're the predestined of God sometimes the elect predestined bride of Jesus Christ is to check up and see that that he has given us he's given us so much hasn't he that none of that has been lost yeah see the woman in Luke 15 and 8. you bought had 10 pieces of silver brother Brandon said she was she was engaged to be married and during that time the 10 piece of civil represented 10 virtues but Brown said you find that in Galatians 5. he said it's the fruits of the spirit and then he adds one he said brotherly kindness yeah he emphasizes brotherly kindness yeah he said what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece now say well one piece it'll be all right no it would because those were her virtues and if she was caught not staying with those virtues then the priest would take one out and she knew if her husband to be came home and saw her without those without that engagement ring on without all pieces all the silver in that piece that he would just he would he would divorce her for the random sin so she could not remain in that condition so what did she do she didn't sit there and say well bless God the neighbor down the road Musta must have must have stole it during the night well if they hadn't had that meeting I would be happy now it consumes me yeah yeah if they if they were doing everything right like they should a bunch of Pentecostals or us looking back the other way well if that church down the road wasn't so dead we'd be all right it didn't matter what piece they were missing are you with me now it doesn't matter what piece all 10 of them had to be there and he said if she lose one piece does not lie to candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it oh my she had to sleep diligently and when she'd found it she called her her friends and her neighbors together she said let's have a meeting Rejoice with me I have found the peace which I lost this area has lost too much brotherly kindness when we find it let's call the people together and have a meeting how about it when we find it let's call some people together we've lost way too much over the years of the virtue we were supposed to have as a bride when we signed it let's come together and rejoice yeah good the church better be examining theirself brother said by the word of God are Purity our loyalty our devotion he's talking about this woman he said we've become paddlers tail bearers cigarette smokers backbiters painted up Jezebels everything in the calendar the rest of the world does the Christian church is associating those things today that you can't hardly tell the one from the other it's time we took inventory it's getting late he talked about the candle in the broom he said now in order it was so late so she had to light a candle and she got a candle not only did she get a candle but she got a broom and she went to house cleaning she didn't go down the neighbor and clean their house she didn't go down to the to the temple and clean out the temple she was cleaning her own house she got a broom and she went to Houseman little brother if there ever was a need of time of the lighting of a candle the sending forth to Gospel Light the Holy Ghost back into the church he said not so much for emotion not for some Fantastics not for some emotional workout not for a jump for joy that's wonderful but that's not why we clean the house but for a heart searching experience when men and women get right with God and you'll have a jump for joy you'll have them you'll understand one against that but he said that's not what it's for you need to have a time when you clean the house I'd be lost to be told who they are and hold you the bride of Christ that's wonderful I believe in that try to tell you that everyone your kids need to hear that yeah also need to hear if there's something missing or put it back in help me find it she lit a candle to give her life brother Joel I'll be it'll be all right brother every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the broom and the neighbors could see the dust flying she had a real house cleaning time for her husband was about to come and if he caught her with that one coin out she was a harlot brother we're the Church of the Living God in these great hours that we're not living it behooves us to check up go before God light the candle of the word and the gospel examine ourselves and find out if we're not falling short especially when we see all these things coming we're at the end time the coming of Christ is at hand there's not another hope in the world for the church and look the church that's all he the church has no conscience no more you can hardly wake them up come on now yeah musicians go ahead and come I'm gonna have to stop listen I was I got put under Thursday got put under and you know one my only concern with the thing they were doing they were just running the test but my only concern with doing that but Bill is I want to make sure I was asleep all right you do not want to know what they're doing and they were putting a tube down my throat I don't want to know that because I'm going to try to reject that put me to sleep so the last time I was under anesthesia was probably eight years ago and I come under anesthesia again sister million when they when they put me under anesthesia you know I can feel it but it ain't it ain't knocking me out you know I'm relaxed I can't move but I can move I can barely talk and I begin to talk and I said doc I said I'm not he's like and I can hear him talking they say is he is he asleep it's easy out because the doctor was in a hurry ain't nothing worse than a doctor in a hurry and I could hear myself say I'm still awake and I said I'm a big boy give me some more but I was I was saying I'm awake but really I wasn't I couldn't feel a thing in fact they put that tube down my throat before I completely conked out I couldn't feel a thing I couldn't know a thing I was out but I thought I was awake that's where the people live today that's where Abraham told us in the coming of the lord they're living that state where they can hear they hear voices they hear a prophet's voice they hear something else over here they hear they can see the coming of the Lords at hand they know they can see life they can see she told me before they did it I said you might see lights you might hear voices she said but you're okay but I just couldn't buy into that I want to make sure I was asleep but but but I hear that I could hear all these things but I couldn't do nothing that's where so many people live and brother bear said the Bible said they would come in that condition where they say Lord our Lord delays his coming they'd be devouring and biting one another so if we're fighting around it's just exactly that hour everything's ready the Patriots just turned as it was like that and it's ready the coming of the Lord he talked about all the churches that lost their life
