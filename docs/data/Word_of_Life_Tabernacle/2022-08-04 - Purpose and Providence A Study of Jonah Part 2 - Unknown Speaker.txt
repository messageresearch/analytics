already conquered for you amen God bless you tonight we'll go ahead and turn to the scriptures so good to be here on a Wednesday night second Kings chapter 14 and verse 25. also we'll read from Jonah chapter 1 and verse 3. Second Kings 14 25 and Jonah 1 and 3 while you're turning there happy birthday to Jason Jason is 10 years old today [Applause] you ready to preach just a couple more years you'd be preaching age so so glad to have the the Pruitt family with us and it was a Joel and his family and it's such a been such a blessing to us and all of you I understand uh brother matinee has been talking about being baptized and what a blessing that'll be and maybe do that on a Sunday and each one of you uh your families it means so much to us we see these little children come up what a great responsibility it is to teach to them the word and to live the word to our children amen amen God bless you turn me back down just a little bit I know I'm talking low but I've got a little ringing Second Kings 14 25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of hammeth Unto the Sea of the plain according to the word of the Lord God of Israel which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah the son of amitai the Prophet which was of gath heifer so you find Jonah having a great prophecy and a season in his ministry when it was received and believed by the king and there was a great Victory actually over the Assyrians during that time Jonah chapter 1 and verse 3 we have a very different picture it says but Jonah rose up to flee into tarshish from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so we paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them to tarshish from the presence of the Lord let's bow our heads together for a word of Prayer I want to continue talking about Jonah and what he meant as a prophet and the type that he is to us Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for all the the things that you've given us thank you for a church that we can gather in on a Wednesday night and hear your word Lord and it means so much to us to be able to be here I pray God that you'd move in every life this evening I pray that you'd speak in every heart and every situation to every couple and every family Lord to the pastor and the ministers and each one of us oh God we pray that you just Lord speak what we need tonight and help us Lord that we would receive from your word not from a man but Lord may we receive the word of God May It Grow Lord and bring forth fruit in the hour that we've been planted in we pray that you would do it heal the sick Lord touch each and every one those that are here and those that could not be we pray and we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated if you listen to a sermon titled Souls that are in prison now that brother Branham preached in 1963 well the Branham talks about how a prophet's Ministry has three poles to it and the third poll is to the Eternal law so he notices a pattern in scripture of a prophet having three poles and the third poll seemingly it's to those who don't want to hear it and uh and we find that that's true uh even in in Jonah's Ministry and we'll show it in just a moment and we can see that and but if you go back to where brother Branham talks about the three polls the poll you understand is a he's fishing right he's fishing and so he cast out into the deep water and he said the first pull you'd pull it slow and of course you know as a fisherman that that's what you would do you'd pull it slow he said and then you pull it away from the little fish to attract the attention of bigger fish so in each poll the first time it attracts the minnows and and so then he said you pull it the second time a little harder and when you pull it the second time it attracts a little bit bigger class of fish but then on the third pole that's when you set the hook because that's the fish that you wanted to catch if with the third pole so there's something there to catch but they may not be as many a number but the quality is better right and you find that in brother random's Ministry that in the first poll there were so many crowds and and miracles that were done what was it he was throwing it out in the deep water among the people and the people were attracted to that gift and then in the second poll it moved a little faster and some began to fall away but then in the third poll many left him just like that many left Jesus when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood because he's jerking it really hard but there had to be somebody that stayed and I want to be one of those who stayed for the word aren't you glad that you didn't you didn't just go with the Miracles but you stayed with the word you stayed for the word and so the 70 left even though they were men that that had preached Jesus message in the first poll in the second poll but when it come down to the third poll they couldn't couldn't see themselves preaching that so they could not excuse me face up to the responsibility of preaching a third pole message they said we don't know what he's talking about he's a Vampire the law tells us not to eat these things and not to eat the blood with the meat with the blood and so they left him they didn't understand what he was talking about but Peter didn't understand it either with his head but he said to whom would we go right we're here for the duration aren't you glad you can do that tonight say I'm here for the duration I I belong with this message we I've left all to follow you Lord amen so Jonah's early Ministry if you could call it his first and his second poll they they attracted uh great attention he had a great thing going but he knew that his third pole Ministry would be difficult and brother Branham tells us that Noah's Ministry was that way and in fact he says in souls are in prison now he said all Ministries done the same so Nineveh in the big picture was a type of God's mercy to the Gentiles and so we see again at the end of the Gentile age there had to be a prophet with a third pull Ministry and during that third poll Ministry the the as the as The Lure is being pulled as the attraction moves the attraction begins begins with a big group but it ends up only being for the elect only the elect will be attracted to the third poll and what is the third poll the opening of the word that's what brother Brandon said it was so only the elect is attracted to that but see Jonah couldn't see and if you watch that sermon when brother Brandon preached Souls that are in prison now he wasn't sure if it wasn't all over if there was even hope for his own children and you you look at Jonah facing that same thing he didn't know if it wasn't all over what's the point of going and preaching in Nineveh and he couldn't face up to the responsibility of a third pull Ministry but aren't you glad our Prophet did amen and so now here it's only for a certain group and Jonah Jonah couldn't face up to that now the third poll would be different In Jonah one and two he said arise go to Nineveh he said that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me now he didn't tell him he didn't tell Jonah well they'll repent they're all getting sackcloth and Ashes and I'll give them an extension of Mercy he didn't reveal that to Jonah he just said go cry against it oh my and Jonah couldn't face up to doing that and brother Branham said in a message called a man running from the presence of the Lord he said the reason the principal reason that I believe that he did this great thing again there could be many reasons that he did it we explored some of those last Wednesday but the principal reason that he did this was because Jonah was a Jew and he was asked to go to a gentile City to cry against it thinking he would not be received because the Gentiles would think what's just you got to do with us but you see he said another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that God not only is God of the Jew but he's got also the Gentile he's God of all people and so we talked about that last Wednesday night that God's got a pocket full of change he he's got different kinds of people he said go preach to the elect go preach to the Nautilus go out in evangelism and we dealt with that how brother Branham wanted to go up into the woods and only come out and preach when when God said thus saith the Lord but he said you're not that kind of prophet right you've got a different Ministry said you have a higher Ministry than that and that's to be an Apostolic age he said in the apostolic age you're to be an evangelist do the work of an evangelist Go Out Among the people amen so not to run from your responsibility to the people oh how many times would we like to just get off to ourselves pull off in our own little little area and or maybe off into our own little church or maybe even into our own home and said just let the world go by it's all going going down anyway we're not going to make it only the elect anyway we might as well just quit but there has to be somebody to give a testimony to give a witness in the third poll when brother Brown was praying at the end of that sermon he's praying for the people he said even if it's all over he said let May there be a testimony of witness yes yes amen amen and so we're called to do that but I believe there's some big fish left too and brother Branham as he goes along he talks about that in that third poll we know we found out what's to the elect but also to the Eternal loss now watch because there's those out there who are already in hell and once you go there you can't come back who am I out of this realm there's a great goal fixed and brother Brandon said they created hell on Earth oh what a time we live in serious thing isn't it but now so he said that's why he would run from him because he's Gentiles who they were and who he was and he goes on he said here we find an example of all of us we're going to do some preaching tonight you just hang with me we find an example of us every one of us we're always are running from something yes we run from trouble we run from responsibilities watch that word responsibility it's important he said we're all prone to do that we're all prone to do that yeah all of us are he said we are more prone to run than we are to stand and face it out see we find ourselves running yes it's easier just to go along and so many times we find that in our Christian walk even the kids when they go to school you know maybe when they get there they'll they'll pray over their food but they see nobody else is and mommy and daddy aren't there to watch them and so it's easy it's even even at Melody's age and she's talked to me about it that it's easy to not pray over your food and because everybody else is not doing it so you begin to do it silently and then and then you end up not doing it at all because no one else is doing it and you know what I'm talking about my kids have all went through that and and because we would rather run from him than we would to face up to the criticism that we're going to face and the questions that we're going to face I've known message girls who would go to school and take off their skirts and put on pants because they couldn't face up to the criticism that they would take at school but I say as Christians today we as parents especially we need to be the example of that that we would stand up and and be an example of being in the public we've got to be in the public we can't pull off somewhere by ourselves we can't go run off and and come out of the woods somewhere if God wouldn't allow brother Branham to do it he's not going to allow us to do it we've got to be part of this world but while we're here let's be a Shining Light let's be a testimony of witness to a lost world maybe there's a big fish out there somewhere it's your testimony at school can make a difference too so he said we're prone to do that we just we find ourselves running oh how many times have I done that and I'm sure you could say Amen to that as well you know a prophet has responsibility that's the first thing I want to if you're keeping notes to stay awake tonight that's the first thing I want to talk about is a prophet's responsibility see a prophet is responsible to God and he's responsible to the people he preaches to but he's he's firstly responsible to God God told Isaiah he said cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet show my people their transgression in the house of Jacob their sins it's a responsibility and when brother Branham preaches a man running from the presence of the Lord he's called he's talking about his own Ministry but he didn't run because he's talking about the question of marriage and divorce and when brother Branham has those series of meetings that he begins on Wednesday night I believe it was with a man running from the presence of the Lord and Sunday morning he comes and preaches marriage and divorce he has avoided that most of his ministry stayed away from it especially in the public but he's got to face it because he knows he don't have much time left and so he's got to face it before he goes off the scene and so he's talking mostly about himself and when we know that because of some of the things that he said no he could have put it put it off and he could do that under the first pull and under the second pole but this the the elect had to hear that we had to face up to it there was a time where things like this didn't matter and I say to those who want to loosen up the pulpits today and make it where just anybody can can stand behind the pulpit anybody don't matter one way or the other this is the hour we have to face up to marriage and divorce yes sir this is the hour we've got to face up to clean living this is the hour face up to be in the bride of Christ it does matter we have a responsibility and so he had to face up to preaching that sermon that sermon that would be so hard on the women so hard on the preachers so hard on everybody but I've always looked at it like this people avoid listening to that but it was a message of Grace she was able to say stay as you are you've been forgiven but don't do that thing again but we've got to face up to that yeah right and many of you may have been impacted by that in your lives but we still have to face up to it it's the word it's the third poll all the loose sins have been tied up we don't have any excuse in this hour he told he told us he said teach your children not to do that so now he could put it off but now he has to stand up to it so what did Jonah have to do Jonah had to travel to a foreign land preach to Gentiles be rejected if the Gentiles received it Israel would reject him if the Israelites receive or if the Gentiles rejected it uh then or if the Israel was happy with him the Gentiles wouldn't be so he he knew there was no there's no way to win in this situation but yet he knew he had to do it but he just couldn't face up to it and how many of us have responsibilities that sometimes we don't want to face the brown said Moses had to do it Elijah had to do it every prophet in his age had to stand up and face these responsibilities many of them didn't do like Jonah he run they didn't aren't you glad for a prophet that didn't run he said John the Baptist was very unpopular in his age he cried out against his age he said to the king the Pope the post brother's wife he had to preach on marriage and divorce one morning see how he's typing into his own Ministry so he cried out against it he said it's not lawful for you to have her he said it cost him his head to be cut off later but he cried out and he stood to his post of Duty he never took a ship to tarshish and said well I'll agree with you Herod it's all right as long as you think she's a nice woman she's making you a nice wife go ahead he said oh mercy them dish Rags you see he said just every little thing he said wow it's nothing but the clean dirty plates with oh my but he said notice John wasn't that way he faced right up to it he said it's not lawful for you to have her and he stood out against it at some point we have to face responsibility Paul faced his responsibility I love Paul's Ministry because when he gets down to the end of it in Acts chapter 20 and verse 26 he says wherefore I take you to record this day he said that I am pure from the blood of all men oh God help me to reach the end of my Ministry and be able to say the same thing I hope that I can I trust that I'll be able to but it'll only be by the grace of God because Paul said by the grace of God I am what I am but he said I'm not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God all the counsel of God brother Branham a couple of months after he preaches marriage and divorce there in February in April of that same year he said if you never hear my voice again he said but God willing I'm setting to Africa in a few hours I may never return I don't know but I tell you with all my heart I've told you the truth and he just spoke there under inspiration and spoken to Los Angeles and said it's going to sink he spoke in a Capernaum Capernaum he spoke him spoke to him something difficult he said I haven't shunned to declare to you everything that God has told me to say and brother gave my heart rejoiced when I heard that because I said we we have the benefit of going back and looking and reading and hearing a prophet that did not shun his his responsibility but he said I'm going to say what God told me to say yes why he had to do that because his ministry was to bring us back to Paul's Ministry amen he fulfilled his responsibility yes preachers have responsibilities and I'm going to preach it myself II Timothy 4 1 says I charge thee therefore before God Paul speaking to a younger Minister he said in the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word it's a responsibility we have to face up to it to preach not only to preach but to be instant in season in other words to be ready to preach we have a responsibility to that be instant in season out of season when it's convenient when it's inconvenient reproof rebuke exhort with all long-suffering I love the way he does that love the way he does they said because he said you're going to have to reprove them sometimes you're going to have to rebuke but do it with long suffering and Doctrine make sure it's sound for the time will come and they will not endure sound Doctrine but to their own lust or their own desires so they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears in other words there's things they want to hear and they're going to find somebody that's going to tell them what they want to hear that's why some preachers are so popular and I'm talking not about message preachers now but about those in the world that gain followings of thousands and thousands and thousands of people this message isn't popular if you preach it was right it's not popular I see people who well some people have big churches well compared to ours but maybe but I'd love to see this church filled up but this message will never be popular or there will never be mega churches all over the land that the president be espousing it if it does you better watch out huh something well bad will have happened I don't believe that'll ever happen because it's sound Doctrine they shall turn away their ears from the truth shall be turned unto fables he said but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministries over the Branham not only had to face up to a prophet's responsibility but a preacher's responsibility it's not just a prophet it was a new testament preacher and a preacher has a responsibility to the people sometimes I don't want to face that brother Joe and usually you know I like to preach I'll just be honest with you brother Charlie Cox used to tell us that he said you preachers say you don't like to preach he said you you're a Liars you know but Charlie had a way of saying that but I don't know if that's necessarily true because there have been times I didn't want to preach but uh but for me I now I enjoy preaching especially here especially on Wednesday night man everybody that's there wants to be there right yeah pretty bad or they'd made up some excuse so so it's good to preach to you on a Wednesday night but sometimes the responsibilities we don't want to face up to is away from the pulpit it just being among the people and sometimes that's difficult but it's part of our job it's enduring affliction that's right making full proof of our ministry see Paul just wasn't a minister when he was among in the crowds or preaching he was one when he was with the brothers too he was he was preaching then so we have to face up to our responsibility God help us today but the Branham said even many times we find it's hard to say but it's true that ministers many times shirk a responsibility for standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with it they'll stroke that responsibility so in our preaching we've got to preach the word and Minister shirt that responsibility he said but ministers they'll come face to face with truth and then walk away from it see he said there seems like there is something they don't want to face up to it see you have a responsibility but you don't have to be a prophet to have that responsibility listen you don't have a prophet's responsibility but I I have a pastor's responsibility but Joel and brother Allen they have a Minister's responsibility listen what brother Brandon says in that message he said the lion is Roar who can but fear God has spoke who can but prophesy when you when you see God doing something I might not be a prophet Jonah said I might not be a prophet or the son of a prophet but God is spoke who can but prophesy I'll say that to every person that tells you what you got to sit down and quit preaching I may not be a prophet may not be the son of a prophet but God is spoken in our day who can but prophesy he said I might not be a prophet I might not be doing this that or the other when I see God doing anything and I see it here in the word and he promised it who can hold their peace and keep still sure he said he stunned it amen do we see God doing something today if we see God has done something we have a responsibility to that and if he's given us a gift to preach we have a responsibility to preach it it's not just the preachers have a responsibility are you still okay tonight we're going to get through this pretty quick but parents have a responsibility and I wouldn't approach this like this if brother Branham hadn't in that sermon but I think it'll be good it'll be good for me and maybe for you as well but the battle said to face up to responsibility sometimes it takes a very hide off of us to do that foreign parents have responsibilities as a father brother Branham mentions a particular responsibility of fathers he says oh Jason's not going to want to hear this on his birthday as a father them little fellas you don't want to do that and I want to say in advance thank God for the good moms and dads we have here aren't afraid to discipline their children so I'm not preaching at you okay it was part of the tape part of Jonah what were the brand preached about Joan I just got to declare the whole counsel of God as a father say well I don't do that my wife does we're gonna get there in a minute as a father a child of weapon well fellas you you don't want to do that and I'll say this if you have to do that you've got a problem but as a father or a mother you've got to face the responsibility of raising that child because the Bible said spare the rod you'll spoil your son he said and that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there is in the world I see that creeping in around the message people people are referring to psychologists about how to raise their children we God sent us a prophet to open up the word in our day we have the scriptures we know how to take care of our children and if you do it right they won't hate you because the Bible teaches you how to do it where they won't hate you amen right but now you've got to face the responsibility of raising that child he said that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there is in the world that Still Remains God's truth he said if there had been more of that practice we wouldn't have had so much juvenile delinquency and stuff and the rot we got in the world today but the old Golden Rule of the home has been broken long time ago let's do whatever they want to I don't have to give you on Wednesday night you know all you have to do is go to Walmart they let the kids do whatever they want to and and whatever cell phone store wherever the kid the kid runs the house that's why they run advertisements to kids now advertisement to me wouldn't have done any good I didn't have any money but now what kids have is not money it's power that power over their parents and that powers if they throw a fit Mom and Dad don't know how to handle it because they've listened to psychologists instead of the word of God there's a way to handle that right God God Made You Have Made A Child a certain way where you don't have to hurt them but but you can get their attention and but see they let kids do whatever they want to the Bible says he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him at times now I know you've noticed this already brother Brown said fathers don't want to face up to the responsibility you notice how that the scriptures and I challenge you to look the scriptures never put the primary responsibility for discipline on the mother huh I'm not preaching at anybody here just so you know my wife does spank our kids probably more than I do just not as hard and honestly we rarely spank our children I'll just say it go ahead and say that maybe we should more often but but we rarely do rarely do if you do that when they're little you don't really have to do that much when they get big if you're still beating them every day when they're 16 you've got a problem gonna beat the devil into them but if you that's what your responsibility the problem is we didn't face our responsibilities when they were young and but but if you look to the scripture let's look at Ephesians 6 and 1. he said children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that's a child's responsibility all the children said amen I love that amen honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise but it may be well with thee and thou mayest lived long on the Earth verse 4 and ye fathers skips right back right over the mothers because mothers generally know how to handle it fathers generally a lot of times don't he said you fathers provoke not your children to wrath now Paul's writing to a generation of people who have been taught Corporal discipline the Romans beat their kids and the Greeks did they believed in it that's how they got them to study they just literally took them to school and beat them all day until they learned and beat them into it and so it's preaching to that generation Paul says don't provoke your children to anger I think that's still true today right right we know we're supposed to spank them but not to provoke them to anger all the children said amen huh we're not supposed to provoke them to anger now Paul knew that men would be more likely to do that than women fathers more than mothers but again there's no mention of the mother again in Colossians 3 21 the companion scripture fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged how many times have I seen that we've all seen it where a son gets discouraged because of the way his father disciplined him but now again in our age I've noticed that fathers don't have any rights of discipline anymore or feel like they have any responsibilities to discipline well I'm at work I'm doing what I'm I'm supposed to do and that that's her job no it's our jobs to make sure it's done and to make sure because in the end he's not going to go calling for her he's going to go calling for us remember when God went looking in the garden for his wayward children why did he holler he didn't say Eve Eve Where Art Thou he said Adam why Adam is the head of the house Adam's the one who was made in the image of God Adam was the one who stood there and had the right and the responsibility and should have known better right so he goes looking for Adam if your children if your children are not disciplined properly and I'll say this in this age that we live in there's so many influences you might do everything right and you might they might still go out but they'll remember it the Bible says when they're old they won't depart from it well I'm so glad for that promise but yet you might do everything right but but if you don't you if you don't do it right there's there's stuff I can guarantee you what the end result is going to be they're going to be just like everybody else in the world but we're called to be something different and we've got to face up to that responsibility I'm going to say Amen to that tonight we got to face up to that and fathers especially we just let's break up yeah listen to me husbands if your home breaks up and God's not going to come looking for your wife don't come looking for you I said I don't think brother would mind me saying this I we've had our disagreements but but Ivy when he would talk to a husband and wife that that were fussing with one another he and maybe maybe even a wife has seen situations where her wife just went crazy run off and into the world and the first thing you would ask because sometimes it's not his fault at all there are those cases or it's not the man's fault at all but he would always ask the man first what did you do because ultimately it's your responsibility before you go blaming your wife what did you do to make her want to leave oh God see the first person should face responsibility in the poem is the husband the first person that should face responsibility in the church is the pastor blame the church if the church is dead I have first responsibility you understand the parents have responsibility for their children now both do it's a joint responsibility to train them upright and brother Branham just to illustrate this you know sometimes we get in complex family situations where it's difficult maybe you were raised in a way that your parents beat you and so you don't want to discipline your children because you're afraid of over disciplining because you know you've got some of that in you maybe you get angry well you just need to wait until you're not angry and then do it because you should never discipline them in anger but but complex family situations happen they happened in brother random's home because Mita wasn't Billy's real mother right his real mother passed away and brother Brandon married me then brother was talking about that he said I've seen his mother give him a spanking you know he's talking about Billy Paul here when he wasn't six months old but me that has never touched him at all said she ought to have done a little bit more maybe it had been different had a lot of trouble and brother Billy would tell you that brother Branham had a lot of trouble with Billy Paul as a Young Man it's a family Dynamic but we're responsible to the word right to bring up our children in the right way and again you say well I'm a failure well in brother Brown was admitting his own failures and those in his family he's gone all the time but yet aren't you glad for the grace of God aren't you glad God still gives Grace but we don't live in the in that gray area in that Grace area we live we want to live in the perfect will of God and then when we make a mistake God will Grace will make up for that but we don't want to live like that right right you don't want to live like that we want to live right according to the word just as much as we can he said maybe it'd been different she left it all up to me he said some people say they don't believe in spanking them but you know the scripture says if you spare the rod you spoil the Sun so I believe in correcting children making them mind had more of that we wouldn't have too much juvenile delinquency parents need to face up to their responsibilities I'm gonna move on aren't you happy there's a lot more we could say about that but we'll move on people have a responsibility I've talked about profits talked about preachers talked about parents maybe you don't fit in any of those groups you say brother man I I'm happy and I'm happy to go lucky tonight and I'm so excited I got to hear the parents preach that and praise God I got to hear the preacher preach sad and and the ministers preached out and the prophet preached about but but so I'm happy y'all it's time to time to go home but see the people have a responsibility every one of us are people how many people we got here tonight I don't know what the rest of you are I'm people we have a responsibility to this message yes yes you remember when when Peter comes across and he preaches his message and he says he said Wicked hands crucified the Lord Jesus in this city they were standing in the same city where it was done in and some of the same people standing there and there were three thousand that day that were pricked in their heart what did they do they didn't go away and say well that was a good sermon but they run to Peter and the apostles they said men and Brethren what shall we do what's our responsibility what responsibility do I have to the word that I've heard oh listen to me church as we as we hurry through this last part remember we have a responsibility to this message oh God help us to realize that today brother Branham said any man that comes into the presence of God is responsible before God from that minute on to tell somebody else he said look at Abraham look at Moses look at Peter look at Paul the moment they come into the presence of God recognize themselves Sinners and sealed their testimony with their life look the little lady speaking the woman at the well he said she couldn't say it stay no longer she went to the city and told the men come see the man that told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah they could not deny it because it was scriptural certainly he said yes they've got to do it a man when we got a responsibility of telling others as Moses did as Peter did as Paul did he said after these things I was talking to people who are watching the discernment night after night watching The Sign of the son of man he said after these things you've seen it and come into His presence I would say after a meeting like we had the other day we have a responsibility to testify of our healing yeah yeah after a church service where God moves we've got a responsibility to tell somebody to preach the word with our lives and if necessary use words all right we have a responsibility we can't deny it as scriptural and he said after you've seen and come into His presence you're responsible for the message to get to somebody else you just cannot sit still with it you must take it to someone else and he picks that up in the same sermon that we've been we've been looking at a man running from the presence of the Lord he said many times I've had people come say I know that's right brother Branham but if I did that they would kick me out of the church what of it if if you don't they're going to kick you out up there well I'd rather be kicked out down here than up there wouldn't you said so you got to be kicked out somewhere see you might as well face up to it instead of running from it and say well I'll go over here I won't go back he said go back sure listen to some more of it listen to some more of it search the scriptures Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me but we find that people won't face up with that just like brother random in his flesh didn't want to face up to preaching marriage and divorce many times we in our flesh don't want to face up to hearing certain messages preached I say oh God help me to be a faithful hearer yeah and then a faithful doer of the word help me not to run from any sermon from anything you would have me preach or listen to that would that would maybe be maybe my life doesn't cope just exactly with it but Lord I want it to could you say Amen to that tonight I wanted to Lord I want to face my responsibility I don't want to run from I don't want to face it maybe there's something some little thing in your life and you think well I know brother Brandon preached against that so you just kind of avoid that now I would say go listen to it search it out find it maybe it's just the devil trying to trying to bring condemnation so you don't have any faith that might be all it is you might have misunderstood but if it's the truth you need to cope with it are you with me tonight cope with it hey man he said being brought into the presence of God and see when God made a promise and God is obligated to that promise you obligated to his word do you believe that tonight and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour he said we find that everywhere and when you see then in this day when the word of God has made these promises of things that we see happening now he said we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it some move has got to be made don't you see there had to be some leaf they couldn't face up to the responsibility but when did they do that well hey man when the third poll was about to be Vindicated that's when they left right at the greatest moment of Victory if they could have stayed that's when they left but there was a group that stayed brother Brandon said some of them left when he talked about the dream of the pyramid I believe that Junior Jackson had the dream of the pyramid he said some of them left when they but he said he cried off the top of that pyramid of the Crowbar he said look there keep looking in there and the ones that stayed and kept looking amen that's the bride that's the elect Hallelujah aren't you glad to be a part of that group tonight it's the true bride hey man they face up to that responsibility of looking into that stone looking into that stature of a perfect man until you're changed into that Hallelujah people invent new doctrines and come up with new things so they don't want to face up to the responsibility of a rapture the responsibility body change is a responsibility because you're not just saying it about somebody else someday there'll be one you're saying Lord there's a Rapture in me I want to express that Rapture that Resurrection until one day my body has changed amen you can't stay neutral some move has got to be made he said you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you came in either further away or closer to God every time you come in or go out there I know we want to hear a lot of the good things and I love preaching the good things I want to preach those as much as I can like I've been talking about we want to preach the promises not just the problems we want to tell you about the promises but we do have to face up to the responsibility of those promises see those those ten spies that the promise was true they said yes the grapes are there we we we're aware that your word the word is true it's a land flowing with milk and honey but they couldn't face up to the responsibility of actually going in there and taking the land I wonder how many of us tonight are willing to face up to the responsibility Lord Lord I want to be the kind of a deacon that's the third pole the opening of the word requires I want to be the kind of a pastor that the third poll requires I want to be the kind of a church at the opening of the word requires us to be I don't want to let go of any responsibility that I have amen we have a responsibility to this message live clean and pure and keep it keep it right before the people responsibility now watch he said when you find these things though he said when we're confronted and coming to a meeting and see the power of God moving and doing things doing Supernatural work see it performed look in this Bible and see that it's promised for this hour then when we see those things and we are confronted with the responsibility to either accept it he said I mean as for ourselves he said now many people sympathize many people say it's right but that don't make it he said that ain't the thing you're responsible for oh God I used to be example of marriage he said if you if you agreed that a woman was the most beautiful woman in the world you could agree that she was virtuous you could agree that she was marriageable that she was she was right she was the the woman for you the right one God LED you to her but you never did anything about it you never put put a ring on it as we would say today you never gave her a wedding band all of your sympathizing with her would never do you any good you'll never be one until you actually do something about it and that's where he said faith without works is dead right because you you've got to do something he said grace and works are married he said if you told me you were married faith and works are married if you told me you were married and he said I never saw your wife after a while I began to doubt it after a while you have to produce something amen and so that's what this message is you can agree with the message but you got to live the message amen Lord help me to do it tonight so that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right this that or the other and say I sympathize with it I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it it's got to become a part of you and you a part of it then it's yours who am I but all amen all the responsibility is yours but also all all of the good things are you with me now when I married my wife I took on responsibility for our bills I'm the husband that's my job I don't care what anybody tells you today it's my job she can help and she can work and do things if she's never worked outside the home but she she does many things I don't want to do in the house and so and so that's the way it's been but I understand in this age that we live in sometimes they have to help but it's my responsibility but when I got the responsibility when I took hey man that's where the window was talking about the veil when I took that Veil and put it on my shoulder yeah then what was that when she put it on my shoulder she was giving up the responsibility to me but we share in the blessings amen we share equally in the blessings of children we share in the blessings of Peace in the home we share because somebody stepped up and took the responsibility aren't you glad there was a groom one day that stepped up and died under no rugged tree to take the responsibility not my will but thine be done he took the responsibility faced up to it in his own third full ministry it meant his own death but he said I'm going to face up to it amen take the responsibility for you and me Paul says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame amen he said when you marry this certain woman that you have chosen you're one then and that's the way you are with Christ amen you got a few more minutes and we'll close he said when you see him manifested and made real then you're a part of him and he's part of you and together you're a part of the message and so we find out that we have many easy ways to go ships going down to Tarsus do they tell me that the ships to Tarsus were the easiest ships of that time to be on it was like going on a cruise ship they had all the Comforts of home so Donna didn't seek out a a hardship he didn't make a play on words he didn't an unintentional pun he didn't he didn't seek out a pirate ship but what did he seek out he sought out a comfortable ship the biggest ship of the age was the ships going to tarshish a whole lot easier than going down to Nineveh that's the way he said we find out we have many easy ways to go ships going down to tarshish for it's easy I love this he invents the word like I did last week he said the unresponsibilities the unresponsibilities are easy it just Flows in You have everything coming everybody likes you nobody disagrees with you you disagree with nobody he said now if that ain't a dish rag said I wish he washed you that's what too many Christians say they are soft soap and everything they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book do a little something jump up and down shout something like that call it Christianity Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world it's a constant burning oh how many of that constant burning today a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with the people making converts to Christ but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat your horse and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard kind of like sitting and listening on a Wednesday night service rolling Upstream I gotta drive home is it raining still did I turn off the crock pot are we going to McDonald's afterwards just keep rowing it's hard it's Upstream but you're going somewhere you're going somewhere he said but you just wants that Loosely horse watch how fast you go he said he said watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards the great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir you must accept your responsibility and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message I love the fact he uses us not just me us but he says as I get older and I know my days are shortening up I feel the responsibility greater than I ever felt pressing on again he uses the plural we must do it yeah we again we we must get down to it in everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God and he's coming soon amen I told you I believe brother Branham knew that he didn't have much longer brother a Perry green tells the story of how there was uh several hundred people maybe actually a few thousand uh in uh somewhere in South America I can't remember the name of the country but they had invited brother Branham to come and and they were ready to receive water baptism kind of like the folks in Egypt were when we got there just ready to receive it and brother Branham but the Perry brought it to brother Branham and said when can you go he said brother Perry I'm not going to go baptize the people he said you go baptize those people but the person said he'd never been out of the U.S had to go get his passport and things like that and go down there he said he didn't know what to preach several thousand people sitting there he said he just got up and he read he said to just tell the things you saw and heard and so he just told his testimony and literally thousands came to Christ and come to the message of the hour oh you don't understand the power of telling how the fire got lit Oh my he said that's our responsibility I think brother Brandon did that because he knew he was leaving the scene and there had to be other ministers go out and carry on the message huh right I'll watch it not just Perry green either but he's dead now too but other ministers other men and every man is going every man makes his own mistakes and has his own Ministry and has to answer to God for whether he faced up to the responsibilities of it but somebody else step up to the plate pray that if the Lord cares God would call more men to take up the responsibility of a third pole Ministry it's hard but somebody's got to do it he said pressing on we must do it he said we must get down to it everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God and he's coming soon he said there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord and brother dwells on that for a while in that sermon he said we've got to tell the people we've got a responsibility tell the people the Lord is coming that is our responsibility musicians go ahead and come I'd read a story about a a new boss to come into a a place was actually an airline you know how bad airlines are with customer service you got put on hold the other day with one and they're just awful awful with customer service they'll put you on hold for days and so he was going to fix it and so he walks into this Airline and he's a new boss somebody recognizing him he walks in there's a man sitting in one of the cubicles and the phone's ringing just keeps ringing you know back when phones rang they just stop ringing and the phone just rang and rang and rang and this man's sitting there with his feet up and he didn't recognize the new boss the new boss walks by and said why don't you answer that phone he said I don't work here I work in the maintenance department he said you mean you did work in the maintenance department hahaha all right oh God if we're going to turn this thing around everybody's gonna have to answer the phone if the phone's ringing answer it you see I don't feel like much of a Preacher if the phone's ringing answer it I don't feel like much of a a Sunday school teacher I don't feel like much of a much of a deacon or a trustee or a singer but if the phone's ringing answer the phone hey man it might be the last one on the other end of the line looking for a life somewhere that'll reflect to them about the coming of of Christ don't you want to take that responsibility today because when you take on that responsibility you also get the reward of going home that's what we want let's bow our heads together I know some of you are tired and you've struggled brother Ben I am I've heard about responsibilities till I'm tired of it tonight but may be the case but if we could just face up to it for a moment if we Face our responsibilities now it'd be easier down the road I found that I'm a great procrastinator among in some things and if it's something that doesn't have to be done I can just put it off and put it off when it comes to the message of the hour I don't want to be that way I want to face up to it Lord help me to preach it with all of my might help me to be the kind of Pastor that the third pole Ministry if we could say it that way demands at this opening of the word demands another another generation might have got by without studying but not mine another generation might have got by without with preaching some things that may have been true maybe not not ours we've got a responsibility we've got to face up to it Lord help me to do that help me to do then if I make a mistake in my sincerity of trying to do what's right I know you'll cover for me Lord hey man could you make that your prayer tonight Heavenly Father I'm so thankful Lord have these people here tonight at members of the Bride those big fish Lord I believe that they're the elect of God Lord those big fish could be caught by the word in our hour so thankful for that Lord maybe there's something that that they struggle with and facing up to a responsibility whether it's a with Lord and recognizing the responsibility they have to the message or whether it's a parent or a preacher or some other office in the church Lord I pray you'd help us to step up to the plate face up to it Lord because we can't do it Lord unless we do it the way you want us to see Jonah got all the way down he thought he was running from you but you just put him in a bad enough situation until he found himself calling out for help oh God we don't want to have to go through that Lord maybe in our ignorance we've done that sometimes but Lord help us to stay in your perfect will and we know that that's what you want for us in this hour I pray you granted Lord we thank you for these things in the scriptures Lord that we're magnified Amplified by the message of the hour Lord they just do something to us make us want to face up to the responsibility of living that word praise granted tonight Lord I pray once

that attitude of Peace come down in that home Lord and she'll know that all is well I pray God that you'd granted for each one of these people or many others that we can't mention I think of sister Fritz as I went to see her the other day and lord they're at home and perhaps she's watching as well tonight I pray God that you'd reach down lord in that heart condition you know how to touch it Lord
