[50:37] amen amen Christ was the very Heart Of
[50:39] God projected to you and I brother R
[50:41] said I thought that maybe God and Christ

[50:49] hated me and Christ s me he said I come

[51:10] Lord yes in him is all Divine love and
[51:14] Grace Grace enough to pick me up Grace
[51:16] enough to pick you up from what we

[51:23] confusion God is not the author of
[51:25] hatred
[51:27] and Malice and bitterness Strife God is
[51:29] not the author of of
[51:32] misunderstandings and we'll have many
[51:34] misunderstandings we'll we'll we'll
[51:36] misunderstand one another we'll we'll
[51:38] think this about one another but in God
[51:41] there is no misunderstandings Satan is
[51:43] the author of that that's
[51:46] right and so don't let a
[51:49] misunderstanding go too far all right is
[51:52] what is what we can say here tonight
[51:53] amen let's come back let let's not let's
[51:56] Satan be the author of our lives but let
[51:59] God's Divine love be the author of Our
[52:01] Lives all right wonderful wonderful I
[52:04] raise my hand I didn't say Amen there we
[52:07] got something else going on here we're
[52:09] working
[52:11] on
[52:13] Amen in his
[52:16] purpose Satan's purpose is all through
[52:18] confusion
[52:20] misunderstandings and his purpose from
[52:22] from the beginning was to cause
[52:24] separation and disfellowship
[52:27] between the Creator and his subjects he
[52:31] started in heaven he he pulled away a
[52:33] third of the Angels because he wanted a
[52:36] better Kingdom he wanted to be worshiped
[52:38] like the most high so he he caused
[52:40] Division and so that's the very spirit
[52:43] and nature of Satan himself to try to
[52:45] cause this
[52:47] fellowship and
[52:50] so we are his we are his subjects here
[52:53] this evening and he would love to try to
[52:55] cause division Among Us he would try to
[52:58] love uh he would love to try to cause
[53:00] division among different churches and
[53:01] different things amen but let's not
[53:03] let's not be inspired by that but let's
[53:05] be inspired by God in this hour can you
[53:09] say amen amen he wants to cause
[53:14] disfellowship even to those that have
[53:16] obtained a like Precious faith and so
[53:20] we've looked at this before we looked
[53:22] there at that word obtained and that
[53:25] word obtained is there is to receive by
[53:27] Divine allotment so God is inspired amen
[53:30] it has been inspired by this Divine
[53:33] allotment this obtainment by this faith
[53:37] is not by chance or or guesswork but
[53:40] through the knowledge of the mind of God
[53:43] the Divine architect than you the Divine
[53:45] architect to be an expression you and I
[53:48] to be an expression of his Divine
[53:50] qualities and characteristics that's
[53:53] what God had in his mind the back part
[53:55] of his mind amen he had a he had a plan
[53:57] he had something that he was going to do
[53:59] amen and you were in that back part of
[54:01] his mind to be an expression yeah very
[54:05] good thank you so that's God's Divine
[54:08] allotment to receive in this hour God's
[54:12] alloted word and the blessing for our
[54:14] day to be attributes of his sinking to
[54:17] be made partakers of his divine
[54:21] nature oh my Revelations 13 it says your
[54:25] names are written it says that your
[54:27] names are written on the Lamb's Book of
[54:28] Life slain from the foundation of the
[54:31] world so God God has something that he
[54:34] he desired amen he's the grand architect
[54:37] he's the grand designer and a designer
[54:39] and an architect they've got to have an
[54:41] idea of what they're doing they got to
[54:42] have something amen some kind of thought
[54:45] that they're going to bring forth amen
[54:47] and from the foundation you are in God's
[54:49] mind from the foundation amen you're not
[54:52] here by chance you're not by here just
[54:54] just by by whatever on a WI amen but
[54:57] it's by God's Divine allotment that
[54:59] you're here thank you Lord in this
[55:02] hour good yes you love the Lord
[55:06] tonight and so in Revelations 13 it says
[55:10] our names are written on the Lamb's Book
[55:12] of Life slain from the foundation of the
[55:14] world so from the foundation of the
[55:16] world God had in his mind this Lamb
[55:18] slain and only those whose names are
[55:21] written on this book will fully overcome
[55:24] that anac cross spirit and there he
[55:27] fights in the Book of Revelation if you
[55:29] read that he he fights us to the very
[55:31] end he F he he has fought from the
[55:34] beginning and he will fight to the very
[55:36] end even though the devil knows that
[55:38] he's whooped come on and preach with me
[55:39] tonight even though he's whooped he
[55:41] still fights and he still fights on just
[55:44] the same even though he's
[55:46] defeated the devil just don't know when
[55:48] to when to give up but the Bible says
[55:49] they shall overcome him by the blood of
[55:52] the lamb and by the word of their
[55:54] testimony yes sir thank you Lord takes
[55:56] the blood in this hour it takes it takes
[55:58] the word upon your
[56:01] lips thank you Lord Brother ROM says
[56:04] here just think of every one of you in
[56:05] here today that's got your name on the
[56:07] Lamb's Book of Life you never put it
[56:09] there and your preacher never put it
[56:11] there neither your church put it there
[56:12] but God put it there and when did he do
[56:15] it it's written in the blood of the Lamb
[56:18] he said how many believes that there
[56:19] isn't enough incover or whatever it is
[56:22] in the world to get that out of there
[56:24] look God puts your name on that book of
[56:26] life from the foundation of the world
[56:28] the Bible says we're just nothing right
[56:31] so it's God doing it God the the great
[56:33] designer the Divine designer the Divine
[56:36] architect am man has something that he's
[56:37] trying to do amen and he had you in his
[56:40] mind from the foundation you Lord you
[56:42] never had nothing to do with it I never
[56:44] had nothing to do with it God himself
[56:46] did it at the foundation of the world
[56:48] when he slew the lamb oh
[56:50] yeah and he says by for knowledge he
[56:53] knew that Christ would be here and he
[56:55] was called the Lamb of God slain from
[56:57] the foundation and the Beast will
[56:59] deceive all that dwells upon the Earth
[57:00] and whose names are not written in the
[57:01] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[57:03] foundation of the world so you think
[57:07] here well that sounds man sounds pretty
[57:10] easy sounds like I got it everything's
[57:12] all planned out I you know I I'm so
[57:15] predestinated that you know everything's
[57:17] just going to work out and it will work
[57:20] out as as God has planned and God says
[57:25] you know that all things work for our
[57:27] good all everything works together for
[57:29] the good to them that love God and so
[57:32] our life has been
[57:34] predetermined but to obtain the promises
[57:36] of God in every age there's always been
[57:38] a fight for God's children amen Satan is
[57:42] not going to let it come just that easy
[57:44] but you've got to have faith you've got
[57:46] to believe you've got to endure you've
[57:48] got to be inspired in this hour there's
[57:50] got to be something driving you
[57:52] something amen motivating you from above
[57:55] yes sir
[57:58] good we've got to have faith we've got
[58:00] to
[58:01] believe it's not he that starts but he
[58:04] that endures to the end on and all hell
[58:08] all hell is against you listen to me
[58:09] young people all hell is against you all
[58:12] hell is against you everything that de
[58:13] the devil's got everything that the
[58:15] devil's got it's coming against you but
[58:19] I want to say here this evening if all
[58:21] hell is against you all Heaven is for me
[58:24] everything that God Amen everything that
[58:26] God's going to give to his church he's
[58:28] given to his church amen amen we just
[58:30] got to take it up as Sons and Daughters
[58:32] of God Amen and overcome the
[58:35] enemy thank you Lord all hell is against
[58:37] you but all Heaven is for you and so
[58:41] Satan will do all that he can to disrupt
[58:44] or keep us from Divine Fellowship he
[58:48] disrupted Adam and Eve in the beginning
[58:51] right he got Eve out of her position
[58:55] yeah come on look and see what they fell
[58:57] from here in Fellowship by Redemption he
[59:00] says now in the beginning when God made
[59:03] the man to worship Him and live God

[59:08] had a perfect fellowship with God and
[59:12] there was nothing wrong God came down in
[59:14] the in the evening and talked to Adam
[59:16] and Eve he said what a beautiful picture

[1:00:08] whispered to them and they had
[1:00:09] fellowship and loved one another and he
[1:00:13] says here all this little group of
[1:00:14] Believers could every one time lay aside
[1:00:17] every thought and get down to the fact
[1:00:18] and know that the great Jehovah God that
[1:00:21] create that created you in the beginning
[1:00:23] is in his position he's in his position
[1:00:26] his place today here in this Tabernacle
[1:00:28] at the heart of every believer amen if

[1:00:36] with you and I he's standing here in his
[1:00:38] position the great holy spirit amen he
[1:00:41] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:00:43] you but I'll be with you even in you he
[1:00:45] said wherever two or three are gathered
[1:00:47] in my name there I'll be in the midst he

[1:01:23] Amen to turn the hearts of the children
[1:01:25] back to the the faith of the fathers
[1:01:27] amen and he said it's these divinely
[1:01:29] revealed truths that literally turn the
[1:01:32] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:01:34] of the fathers oh how God has
[1:01:36] communicated to us in this hour amen the
[1:01:38] least we can do is give him an amen
[1:01:40] every now and then the least we can do
[1:01:41] is give him a little bit of worship and
[1:01:43] say thank you Lord for giving me the
[1:01:45] revealed word of the hour yes sir thank
[1:01:47] you Lord for turning my heart that's TR

[1:02:00] Fellowship here this
[1:02:03] evening amen thank you we read on here
[1:02:06] Adam and Eve he said here in the cool of
[1:02:09] the day the great voice whispered to him
[1:02:12] they had fellowship and they loved one
[1:02:14] another he said how moving how the
[1:02:17] moving of the spirit went through the
[1:02:19] bushes the Lions came up the tires and
[1:02:23] all them worship they worshiped the Lord
[1:02:26] man was conscious at all times that his
[1:02:28] presence was with him oh my think about
[1:02:31] that for a minute they come together
[1:02:33] with a lions the Tigers and the Bears
[1:02:36] they got along with the Lions and the
[1:02:38] Tigers and the Bears and sometimes
[1:02:41] messes church we come together we can't
[1:02:43] we can't get along for two or three days
[1:02:45] bu but if we'll be aware of the presence
[1:02:47] of God if we'll be aware of the presence
[1:02:50] of God how he wants to come down and and
[1:02:52] whisper sweet nothings to us how he
[1:02:54] wants to come down amen and express
[1:02:56] himself to us well we've got to get in
[1:02:59] that place amen where Satan is not the
[1:03:02] author of uh and bringing confusion and
[1:03:05] Malice and misunderstandings but we've
[1:03:07] got to come to a place of perfect peace
[1:03:09] and perfect understanding with one
[1:03:12] another I don't know why I'm going there
[1:03:15] come
[1:03:17] on but this is what we fell from a
[1:03:20] perfect
[1:03:21] fellowship and so one time man had that
[1:03:25] and it was God's purpose to have this
[1:03:28] Perfection and even though in this life
[1:03:31] we have troubles we have troubles in
[1:03:33] this life we deal with heartaches and
[1:03:34] hurt and sicknesses there's a longing in
[1:03:37] man a longing and a craving in our
[1:03:39] hearts for that kind of fellowship and I
[1:03:42] believe that if something has been lost
[1:03:45] God's purpose through Christ is to
[1:03:47] restore that back to his children what
[1:03:51] Satan has disrupted God makes a way back
[1:03:55] what Satan is disrupting in your life
[1:03:57] the trouble that he caused you the
[1:03:59] things you didn't even ask for and maybe
[1:04:02] you did ask for those things you know
[1:04:04] we're we're Our Own Worst Enemy I'm My
[1:04:06] Own Worst Enemy may maybe we did bring
[1:04:09] those things upon ourselves amen but God
[1:04:11] Amen is here to restore amen amen
[1:04:14] whatever wrongs whatever hurt has
[1:04:16] happened to you amen God has made a way
[1:04:18] back through Jesus Christ amen that
[1:04:21] everything you lost everything the devil
[1:04:23] took from from you can be restored

[1:04:31] longing and a craving in our hearts for

[1:04:48] that's what Adam and Eve needed that's
[1:04:50] what they needed after the fall amen God

[1:04:55] them

[1:05:12] restoration back is the blood through
[1:05:14] the blood you have Fellowship

[1:05:18] Adam Adam couldn't meet God with the Fig
[1:05:21] leaves he couldn't meet him with his own
[1:05:23] theology but it took God to make a way

[1:22:27] come on in a sermon brother Ram talked
[1:22:31] about Charles
[1:22:33] finny he said he was preaching one time
[1:22:37] he said there he had some sermons and he
[1:22:39] said two Little Women there was praying
[1:22:41] for him to get the Holy
[1:22:43] Ghost and he told me he had the Holy
[1:22:46] Ghost and one day he went out he tells a
[1:22:49] story went out behind his office knelt
[1:22:51] down there by an old tree and had blown
[1:22:55] down and while he was there praying
[1:22:58] listen young people while he was there
[1:23:01] praying my while he was there praying a
[1:23:05] stick broke and he thought someone was
[1:23:07] coming up and then he jumped up and said
[1:23:09] oh H looked around he thought somebody
[1:23:13] was there and seen him pray and then he
[1:23:14] sat down he said and he if I was talking
[1:23:17] to my boss in the office I would like
[1:23:19] for anybody to see me speak to my boss
[1:23:21] but I'm ashamed of somebody to see see
[1:23:24] me speak to my lord and there under
[1:23:26] conviction threw off his cloak and
[1:23:28] Malice and hatred he said and fell on
[1:23:30] his face and cried out before God until
[1:23:33] God filled him with the Holy Ghost he
[1:23:35] said then something happened then
[1:23:36] something was different he got the
[1:23:38] starch out of him something took place
[1:23:40] because he had come in that sh Glory
[1:23:43] into the relationship with God of
[1:23:46] Fellowship Divine oh yeah oh my it took
[1:23:49] the coward of him out of him it took the
[1:23:52] malice it took the hatred out of him he
[1:23:54] said that's the reason I like these four
[1:23:56] gospel convictions you hear the people
[1:23:58] cry and shout and praise the Lord
[1:24:00] because they've come into a fellowship a
[1:24:02] Divine Fellowship of the Holy Spirit he
[1:24:04] said when you get rid of that you've
[1:24:06] gone back to Babylon you might as well
[1:24:08] bury yourself he said that's exactly
[1:24:10] right when we get to a place where we're
[1:24:12] away from the Praises of God and the
[1:24:14] shikan of Glory where the fresh
[1:24:16] anointing breaks down and all religious
[1:24:18] bears and things that makes us one in
[1:24:20] Jesus Christ amen free from all
[1:24:22] condemnation he said we need that
