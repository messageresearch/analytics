power and your grace lord we're thankful for that today i pray god that you reach down in the lives of each and every person go beyond the mind and the body lord and go deep into the soul and that part that seed that you can speak to today lord and take me out of the way remove my my flesh entirely lord from the sermon today may it be you god that speaks directly to the people lord you've laid this on my heart for some reason lord i trust you to go and and lord that the word would not go forth void but that you would place it exactly where it would need to be i pray and grant it today lord i pray for each and every one of these people that they would be completely well or if there's any sickness among them lord that they would be healed hard and that your name would be glorified when we leave this place we ask in jesus name amen amen god bless you hebrews chapter 12 and verse 12. read down through verse 15. good to be in the house of the lord today we'll just have one service we've got labor day this weekend i know we obviously have a bunch of people out for that but i'm glad you're here this morning and thank you for being here we've got some visitors today and it's good to have you here this morning and brother caleb's paris your parents right brother caleb and good to have you today i i want to say thank you for raising such a wonderful son and uh brother caleb go ahead the caleb's a real blessing here to the church and as a deacon working here in the church thank you for that and and uh what a buddy he's been to me and and standing uh with the word and learning and growing from some of our older deacons and we're grateful for all the ones that god has brought among us uh sister milly your mother here this morning god bless you good to have you this morning amen hebrews chapter 12 and verse 12. i trust some of the other folks that aren't here will be able to watch or are watching this morning god bless you as well it says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed oh don't you we all need healing today let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled i'd like to speak to you this morning on poison fruit from bitter roots i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated every fruit comes from a plant a tree or a vine and every plant has a root a root is that part of a plant or a tree that receives water and nutrients from the soil in the new testament it's used as a metaphor or a parable and it primarily has a symbol of origin including spiritual and genealogical origins when john the baptist came out of the wilderness and he began to preach to that generation of pharisees that was there at that time he began to preach to them and he realized that the fruit that was coming out of their life was not what it should be it did not match what the word was or what the light was for that hour and so he comes out preaching if you can imagine what it must have been what it must have seemed like to the generation he was preaching to here was a 30 year old preacher that come out of the wilderness he was eating locust and wild honey he was dressed in camel's hair and and he had the spirit though and the power of elijah on him right and we've seen that in our day but here was a man who didn't fit in with the organization of the day and he was standing there preaching to these elders to men with gray hair men who had stood there for decade after decade and cared for god's people and they thought they were the the utmost of the jewish religion they thought that they kept all the law just exactly like it was supposed to be but the truth is in their legalism they had actually turned away from god and by their tradition they'd made the word of god of none effect and here comes a 30 year old preacher out of the wilderness and he comes preaching and he comes to him and they come to be baptized of him because it was the popular thing to do in that day and he said if you come for repentance bring fruits worthy of repentance show some fruit worthy of repentance if you come for repentance he was seeing the wrong fruits among an older generation and it must have they must have said well this man has no respect for for his elders this man but the word is always the word and it's always true no matter who says it no matter who we need we've got to separate that in our day we you quit looking at the man that's saying him but is the word the truth we believe that it is we don't look at god calling a kentucky hillbilly in this age and say well he didn't have good grammar he didn't do all of these things that the world thought he should do we don't look at the man you've got to be able to look past that and see that god was speaking to this generation just like he did with john the baptist but then john the baptist say he was he was actually he was turning the hearts of the fathers to the children that's what he was doing now in our day he was called brother animals called to turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers but in that day he was turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and so there he stood preaching his message to men who had been pastors and leaders for decades but they were wrong don't ever get hung up on the flesh don't ever put too much confidence in a man what we need to do is look at the fruit what what is the teaching what's the result of the teaching what what is bring what is coming out in matthew 3 and 8 john stands there and he says bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father notice they would go back to their origin we have roots we have roots we can go back and we can see that we were identified with with moses we were identified with moses teaching we're identified with the quotes and the and the books and the tapes and all those things that's wonderful that they were but they but they could not see that god was doing something that there was a light that was moving in their hour and so he begins to say don't think we have abraham to our father i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and sometimes the way we do that today well i'm a message believer i go to brother ben pruitt's church or i go to some other church in the message and i go to word of life tabernacle maybe your identity was with a church name it's good that we have a good church and a good church name but that's not what our identity is with we our identity needs to be with the word we go to church not because we love the church but because we love god right and that'll make us love one another amen now the acts he said now also the ax is laid unto the root not to the fruit john's not standing there trying to reform the pharisees and this is important this morning as uh maybe it's a little bit different than what we dealt with wednesday night or even last sunday but i think this will be important to us to understand in our own lives individually and i'm not preaching to anybody else this morning but just to each one of us individually and to myself we need to deal with things from the root not go on the fruit we can inspect the fruit but if you take the fruit off if you if you remove the poisoned fruit that root will grow another one right you can even cut down the tree it'll come back up but you've got to get rid of the root and if you can ever get rid of the root and burn it it won't ever come back now watch the ax is not laid to the symptoms but the axe is laid to the cause he says your root is bad so if you look at it in the sense of the way we would understand bitterness today you know in the old testament bitterness was idolatry in the new testament speaking of bitterness false doctrine that would come in or someone with false doctrine coming in but it's poison it's poison and the way we understand bitterness today it's a bitterness of spirit a bitterness of uh of getting to a point where uh you uh you can't be around some people or you have you have an issue with certain people there's things in your life you're bitter about and and and so now as you begin to look at that and begin to realize that you can't just con deal with that by pulling away from those people if the problem is well i'm i'm bitter so i'm going to quit fellowshipping with this church or i'm bitter so i'm going to leave church and just sit out by myself that's not going to deal with the problem i'm bitter so i'm going to i'm going to do away with this family member i'm going to quit being around no more i'm going to quit being around this person that doesn't deal with the problem some people even leave the message entirely out of bitterness and the truth is they have a reason yeah there's a reason and many times it's even a good reason but yet they that reason becomes an excuse right because even just because it's a good reason doesn't give you a right to go against the word right but many people i understand why some people don't want to go to church because they've been hurt in church and all that they associate church with is a man dogmatically bringing out something and beating them over the head with something or or telling them everything to do in their lives and becoming some sort of a ruler or a king that's not what a pastor is that's not what a preacher should be our job is to preach the word i can't make you live it but i can preach it right and my job is to preach the word and then you got to go live it right i've got to go live it so the pastor is not above the people in that way but people say well i've been hurt i've been in a bad church situation my past you don't understand what i meant i'm struggling with this and so now i'm bitter and so i'm going to move away but you're dealing with the fruit not the roots at some point you need to take care of the problem the bitterness itself needs to go you need to let go of the issue itself say not my will but time be done lord this root can only be dealt with by the fire of the holy ghost you're not going to be able to make 12 steps to get it out you're not going to be able to reform it you're not going to be able to take it through and through a process of saying well i you know i'm i'm better now than i was and i'm better tomorrow than i am was yesterday no it needs to be dealt with by the fire of the holy ghost and then you can begin to heal right then you can begin to heal then you can begin to make things right but first the root has to be dealt with you can't use psychology alone to take that out psychology may identify what's wrong but it can't fix it and so it begins to make excuses for it and that's when it begins to be dangerous matthew 3 and 11. it john continues on now notice where he takes this the axe is laid to the root to the root of the tree he said it and every tree that brings not forth good fruit is tuned down cast into the fire and then he goes on i indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i'm not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire the problem was with the root now their particular problem was that they were children of the devil there's not much taking you can do about that you are what you are but i believe that you're children of god today i believe that you are and then you have to believe that so if i'm a child of god then the root problem is not my origin but it's the origin of this bitterness which may have been something that happened to me or something that went on in my life so now he says but that that's got to be dealt with by the fire of the holy ghost you've got to become a new creation in christ a new creature in christ in order for you to ever get rid of that bitterness and that root of bitterness that springs up otherwise you're going to keep running if you've fallen for a cult in the past and that you didn't get rid of the root of what caused you to fall for that you'll fall again in the future and that's why people go from one uh doctrine off the word to another doctrine off the word right and and they just go pin like a pinball machine back and forth because the thing is you've never dealt with the route if you if you have a problem with uh with people and people have hurt you if you don't get rid of that route somebody else is going to do it and somebody else is going to do it and you can't just keep cutting off people eventually you'll die lonely and alone and no one will be there and it will be your fault are you hearing me this morning because every hand that tried to help you you bid it everyone that tried to reach out to you a pastor tried to reach out to you but you'd had a bad pastor so you wouldn't listen a son tried to reach out to you but you wouldn't listen because he's too young a daughter tried to reach out to you but you wouldn't listen a family member tried to reach out to you but that bitterness is not dealt with and because it's not deal with eventually you end up all by yourself but if you let the holy spirit go down like a fire inside of you and burn that thing out of you then you can begin to repair those relationships amen now so if the root of something can be found it can be dealt with look at mark chapter 11 mark chapter 11 and verse 12 it says on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it now they go into jerusalem and come back the next day in mark chapter 11 verse 20 it says in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots from the roots now brother brandon picks up the story he said peter said look at that tree it's dead from the roots up why jesus rebuked the life that was in that tree that was in the roots and the whole thing died and brother branham says hallelujah that same christ oh i'm glad we still serve that same god today that same christ can rebuke a cancer from the roots glory to god can rebuke a cancer from the roots and the whole thing will die he said that tree was standing there just the same as it was hours before but you find the leaves begin to drop off then see the bark begin to peel off why he rebuked the roots oh god he said it began to wear away day after day and week after week after a while there wasn't even one speck of that tree left he said cancer tumor cataract or anything else will have to go when christ speaks do we believe that this morning so whatever it is whether it's sickness whether it's sin whether it's a spiritual wound see we get wounded in our spirit just like we do in in our flesh if it's a spiritual wound you're not going to deal with it by babying it and paul spoke to the galatians like that i believe it was the galatians he said have i become your enemy by telling you the truth and many times we don't want to hear the truth and so we just shut it out and brother madam tells a story about a prospector that went to get some gold and he finds the gold and he's going to be rich the rest of his life he got a faithful old dog y'all remember the story got a faithful old dog and the old dog is is warning him one night he went to bed thinking of dreaming about all these things and the dog just keeps barking keeps barking because there's some outlaws out there that want to take that gold but he's too busy thinking about what he's going to do and finally he gets so tired of that dog he said oh i don't need you no more my prospecting days are over i'm going to be a rich man so he walks out there and takes a gun and shoots the dog and killed the only thing that would keep him alive instead of heeding the warning and wondering why was he barking he actually shoots the very messenger that would have kept him alive oh god how many times have we done that instead of dealing with the problem we're just going to shoot the messenger and pretty soon you don't have relationships with anybody in your family anybody in the church any other preachers he said preachers do this absolutely i've seen it god help me never to be that way but we all have that potential because we are woundable in our spirits we think we're not but we are are you hear me we've learned that we're woundable in the flesh that's even a word we've learned that we we have the ability to be wounded you learn that when you're a kid you wouldn't touch the hot stove i told my wife because kids were always doing something like that and i told them i said well if they do it once they won't do it again you try to keep your kids from that but they got to learn at some point whether it's by slapping their hand or something there's got to be some some pain associated with that or they'll keep doing it because they don't know that they're woundable they don't know they just they'll just run jump off a building until they realize that it'll hurt oh my and the older you get the more woundable you get you realize your spirit is the same way when you're young now think about it as a as a young person and i'm not just preaching to our elders today but if you are an elder today you need to listen because here you might be i've been in the message for decades and and you say well i know what i believe i know where i stand but you're still woundable in your spirit and maybe more so now that you're older than when you were young because you take a young person a child that child can have a fight a knock down drag out with another child you give them both a weapon five minutes later they're right back there playing one with one another again most of the time right now you take you take your children when you have to give them a spanking i know that's a dirty word today but sometimes we have to spank our children at least some of us do and when we have to spank our children many times in doing that it you know again it's child abuse if you do it in anger right so we don't do it in anger right but you do it according to the word you follow the word and so but when you have to deal with your children in that way what does your child do if you go up to them afterwards now when they're older they won't do this but when they're little they come and give you a big hug and you'll sit there after a a whooping hugging one another and it's so sweet and so precious why that spirit recovers quickly right the wounded spirit of a child recovers quickly the wounded spirit of an adult recovers less quickly and the wounded spirit that recovers the worst or the slowest is the oldest many times that you get to a point where you're covered or maybe i shouldn't say the oldest but the one that's been through the most because you're covered in scars you're covered in in callous as your spirit is you realize it and so and so you keep everything out and you hold yourself in a certain position but you you have to be vulnerable at some point in order to ever feel loved you have to be vulnerable at some point in order to ever feel special you want to i don't ever feel special because you never allow yourself to be vulnerable oh god i don't know who i'm speaking to today this isn't all in my notes but i hope that i hope that we can grab a hold of it many times as a preacher gets older he gets wounded and it's not his fault people did it to him but brother branham went through that he said i got to where i'm so tired of him doing the same thing year after year and i come and preach it and he wanted to go out in the wilderness and god told me that you're not that kind of a prophet you've got a higher ministry than that you've got to be among the people do the work of an evangelist right and but he even dealt with that he said i lost the love for the people like moses did we all deal with that as you get more and more wounded there's more and more the opportunity to say well you know they did it to me i can do it back but that's not the spirit of christ what is that that bitterness that that root begins to grow maybe it's caused by something there's always a cause but then that root it begins to grow and begins to grow and every once while it springs up and we cut it down and it springs up but you need to deal with the root of it and so we treat the symptoms but as we get older it just gets worse you get stronger in the faith you're also less pliable so you've got to watch that because you've lived a good life you know you stood for the gospel you know you've had victories and the devil will use that against you because someone will come and tell you the truth maybe it'll be your son or your daughter or someone else someone will come and tell you the truth and you won't listen to it because you're too wounded and you're too in your shell you can't allow anything to come in i pray this morning that we would just let the holy spirit just begin to dig where he wants to be let the word begin to dig we could be like that child we may get a spanking in church we we may get dealt with one side and the other we listening to a tape or reading our bibles it may just deal with us but we say lord come in deal with us and then i'll love you i'll worship you afterwards after i get my toes stepped on after i get all black and blue i will raise my hands and i say lord i know you did it for my good amen i know all things work together for good to them that love god oh my so now we're dealing with sicknesses of the spirit and too often we treat the symptoms another vacation more fun there's nothing wrong with vacation nothing wrong with fun but sometimes we're trying to treat the bitterness or the or the depression or whatever wound that's going on in our spirit with something on the outside we're treating symptoms and it may help for a while but it doesn't deal with the cause a new car a better house a new wife a new husband a new church i'm gonna have to run after this one and see folks changing the channel right now you know turning that caught you didn't i know no you know we want to deal with the symptoms when the poison fruit springs up we say oh well i i just need some time for myself i need some me time i hear so much of that today and there are times again when these things help are you with me there's times when it helps but what you need is to get rid of the root not the root in someone else the root in you and so a lot of times when a pastor gets hurt i'm saying this so that you'll know if it happens to me you'll know how to deal with me right but a lot of times when a pastor gets hurt what he does he tries to dig the roots out of the people he's bitter in his own spirit and so he begins to dig at the people and that's not what we're called to do it's my job to take the grubbing hole of the word and dig those roots out right but i can't do that when i'm myself i need the roots dug out i can't help you with the speck in your eye if there's a log in mine are you with me i'm just being honest with you this morning and so i've got to get out of my bitterness of spirit and come out of that situation myself look how vulnerable and how honest brother branham is with the people and standing in the gap and some of those sermons that he preached where he talked about leaving the field and all those things he's so honest and vulnerable with the people because he wants to be sincere he wants to be right with god and if god could call the prophet of this day to that how much more will he call us to that let me be vulnerable let me let me stand before the people and say i want to make sure my heart is right or i don't want to preach are you with me today i can do way more harm than hurt but we deal with the symptoms i'll just get rid of all the people in the church that disagree with me after a while it's just you and two or three other people you say well i i'll deal with my sons and my daughters and my children and my parents then i'll be happy then no we need to deal with the root in us brother branham talks about this he said someone said brother roberts brother branham will pray for 500 while you pray for three that's right certainly he'll get twice the testimony certainly 50 times the testimonies he said because you'll after all it's based upon the faith of the individuals being prayed for but the ones that fails in there then they come over to the meeting he said if a doctor i love that the ones that oral roberts they failed at oral roberts meeting to get their healing right they come over to brother branham's he said if a doctor you go to a doctor's office and say i'm sick of my stomach and got a headache and so forth and that doctor just writes you out a little prescription of aspirin or a tranquilizer or something he's never diagnosed that case he's just trying to get you out of the office he said now if he's got you on his heart oh that's what we need today doctors with the people on their heart preachers with the people on their heart are you with me now he's trying to get you out of the office but if he's got you upon his heart and he's interested he'll diagnose that case until he finds the cause you know what he has to do to get that diagnosed he has to talk to you the one thing i can't handle is a doctor that won't talk to me he's too busy because i don't know what the problem is but he's taught he'll know if he'll talk to me long enough to understand but many times they miss stuff because they won't talk but harvey and i have talked about this where communication is so important and it doesn't come naturally to me but we've got to communicate with one another i would love to be able to just retreat into my shell and just study the word and come out here and preach but we've got to communicate with one another or we're never going to be able to deal with these roots that come up right so you've got to get back to the cost now i can't do that like brother branham did because i'm not a prophet i can talk to you but i don't know but the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen so now i can tell you the word now watch and brother brandon said when a man is sick or a woman and something has happened there's only one way to correctly get that that's go back and find the cause go back till we see what they've done in the meetings he said watch them stand on the platform the holy spirit say 10 years ago you was at a certain place and you've done a certain thing you did this and certainly you've heard it many of you in the meetings you did that you've got to make that right first he said and then if they promise to do it then you'll hear it come forth let's say it the lord he said mark it in your books did you ever see it fail the congregation says no he said certainly not it doesn't it can't what is it see the first thing you got to find the cause before you can produce the cure you've got to find the reason for it and now today he said we're trying to educate people to do that john the baptist didn't say go get more education and come back with fruits he didn't say that he said the axe is laid to the root of the tree right and there's one coming will baptize you with fire it'll take care of that root that's what you do with roots by the way you grub them out of the ground you take them put them in a pile and burn them and so now he said you've got to find the cause before you can find the cure and we're trying to educate people to that to the scientific approach to god you can't do that god is known not by science but by faith we know god now let me use an example can i take a little bit of time this morning i i know we got one service today so i won't i won't take hours and hours but just long enough to try to get through this this morning i appreciate your patience now but the random deals with nervousness if you've ever listened to very many of the tapes you'll find that nervousness over and over again in fact he said in some of his meetings he said 80 of the people were dealing with the same problem nervousness but now we have to be careful when diagnosing people we love to diagnose people don't we when someone is sick what do you do you know this if someone in the family is sick we love to sit around the table and say well brother so and so or you know my my grandmother when she had that same problem she ended up in a nursing home and so and so he had a stroke and so and so it was high blood pressure so high blood sugar we love to diagnose but the truth is we don't know and the same symptoms can have many causes that's why it's important to get at the root right and so brother brown deals with nervousness in the prayer lines and he deals it in many different ways in one famous case which i know you've heard before i know that i've read it before but brandon was praying for a man who's depressed and nervous and and he doesn't just say well lord calm his nerves but he goes back into his past and he finds a cause in this case he said when you was a child a little boy with knee pants on he said you've got problems with something run he said i believe it's a dog that chased you or something isn't that right a big dog and you run to a porch later on he said it was a yellow dog that's pretty that's pretty particular isn't it the prophet goes back and sees that life and you'll find uh another case at least one other case the message of that young hispanic boy in tucson had the same problem here he was an adult man that carried out all his life there was a young boy that was scared and nervous brandon said that child got chased by a dog so but that's not always the reason for nervousness right you might be nervous and anxious and depressed and it's not caused because you were chased by a dog right it may have a different route look look at this brother brandon says that's one of your troubles it's nervousness he's speaking to a lady he said now your nervousness is caused from your age in other words menopause that's a reason he said but now that'll all leave you right that's a different reason for nervous a different route right again brother branham deals with another man he said all right the thing of it is you're really the trouble is you're suffering from a nervous breakdown you're having some kind of mental scruples in your mind it's oppression from satan right here's a completely different cause for the same symptoms he said this has been going on for some time it's caused your body to get weak your heart is weak you're in very bad shape by this your whole family is just about into a breakdown right because when it happens to one it spreads to the family and their problem was that his problem was oppression from satan on him you know how many times god satan rather will do that especially in a ministry family or a deacon's family or somebody involved in the church he'll get that into a christian's family he'll make that one person to be nervous and upset and spread it through the whole family and then through the whole church right that's why we need to deal with these things not just let it go especially if you can get to the pastor in that way if you can make the pastor nervous and upset and anxious it'll make the whole church like that because we're sheep right sheep are trained because they're watching for the wolf and they get real nervous when they sense there'll be one of them little sense or smell or there'll be some some way that they identify there's a there's a wolf there and they begin to get nervous and then begin to look for the shepherd oh that's what we need to do today when you get nervous when you get weary when you get anxious look for the shepherd but there's many different causes for this again he deals with another another person i think this is a woman but he said something strange i see a man a young man appear in here it's your son and he is suffering from a mental condition and the mental condition was caused by domestic trouble domestic trouble and again he speaks to another lady a lady had tried to contact brother branham for nine years can you imagine trying to get in touch with the prophet for nine years she tried and she finally got in touch with him got a personal interview and the lady he said move back and she said brother branham just a word with you he said standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and she can see that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living he said and a great thing happened back way back in the time of her parents that had caused this great thing to happen to her and the lord jesus revealed it and showed what it was he said in there in a moment's time aren't you glad for the grace of god a prophet can look back into her life and say this thing didn't happen just to you it happened to your parents and she maybe had never heard the story but she found out what happened to her parents you could deal with what happened to her he said the lord jesus revealed it show what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman you've got to identify it but it's the lord jesus that takes it away you've got to identify but it's the fire of the holy ghost that takes it away that's why we need the power of god in our services we need the presence of god to be here not just sometimes but there's people dealing with things constantly people dealing with all kinds of different things and maybe they present in the same way but they're completely different that's why you can't deal with everybody in the same way and there might be times and i'll just deal with this now but you excuse me if you don't go to church here and just kind of lay this to the side but there may be times you say brother ben as my pastor you dealt with this one way this time and i see you dealing with it a different way this time and i don't understand there's a reason for that it's two different people and many times i don't know how we're going to deal with something until we get back here and begin to talk about it and and some of the brothers can tell you that you don't know which way you're going to go in the person the way they present and the spirit that's there and you give them to dig back in their life and see some things you begin to realize this is a problem and then if they won't deal with it then there's got to be something that happens but maybe somebody else with the same outward symptoms will come and get a different answer look at brother branham how many different people are going out there with personal testimonies brother branham told them personally because they're different people right you can't apply that to a whole church i may get myself in trouble but it's the truth and we had a deacon one time i was i went to church with a deacon he felt that everything had to be the same if you if you moved one person from a certain spot in the church and wanted them to sit somewhere else you know the deacons part of their job is seating people in meetings and things like that if you move this person you had to move other people you couldn't just do it to one person everybody's the same well that's not how that works some people are just there they're not going to hear it whether or not on the front row or the back row and there's other people maybe young people and they need to be up front right so he would never move one unless you move the other but it's just there's a difference in people you've got to learn that and so people there's different causes for the same symptoms here's another one that dealt with nervousness he said this lady suffers with an extremely nervous condition but you're all upset about something you're weary he said i see you shake your head or something in prayer you even wonder sometimes if you're actually saved he said that's true you've doubted your experience of being saved but i'll tell you now you are glory to god he said but this was caused by a call some kind of a shock you've had some news or something that shocked you all at once and caused this he said i think it was a death of your husband last fall he said god bless your heart lady let's move the sadness everything will be all right see the root needed to be dealt with now that's the same symptom and i showed you six different root causes there's many more if you go in and study nervousness and how brother branham dealt with it but it wasn't all the same now watch if you but the cure is all the same it's the fire of the holy ghost that's always the cure we preach christ and him crucified paul said i know nothing among you except christ and him crucified so again you can't counsel away a spiritual problem many times you can't beat it out of your children either it's got the word of god has to be preached and that person has to accept it into their soul and let the fire of god purge it out of them now again the same symptom six different root causes if you want to quit producing poison fruit you need to let the holy ghost deal with that root and sometimes what you think is persecution and you think it's an attack well i had five preachers tell me the same thing they're all against me maybe it's the holy spirit trying to speak to you did you ever consider that it was the grace of god the holy spirit reaching down into your generation to speak to you because he's the same yesterday today and forever did you ever consider that that it's god trying to tell you something every time you look at the bible you come up with the same thing you think well i must be being persecuted the devil must be against me maybe god's trying to tell you something because the word of god is alive quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to the listen the dividing asunder of soul and spirit so the word knows if it's a soul problem or if it's a spirit problem are you with me now the word christ looked at them pharisees and john the baptist said you've got a problem the axe is laid to the root of the trees but jesus walked out and said you're of your father the devil why because the word was a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and could divide between the elect and the non-elect could divide between the soul and the spirit but even you the word that deals with you he deals with me the word deals with us and it divides between what is flesh and what is spirit what is spirit and what is soul you understand if there's a problem and many times the devil tried to tell you like he did this woman you're not even saved well that's not the problem at all but the word is is a quick is alive and powerful aren't you glad that it is this morning quit making excuses for the fruit dig the root out huh you don't understand what happened in my past i know i know it's a hurt i know that you you need to identify it but don't dwell on it dig it out see because a poison root infiltrates every area of your life simon the sorcerer you find in acts chapter 8 he tried to buy the gift of the holy ghost but he was rebuked by the apostles and this is how they rebuked him repent therefore this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness in the bond of iniquity you're believing this false thing you're following after these false things because of your bitterness and you don't understand it and see that that can be hidden for a while many times we can clip the fruit off look pretty good come to church and clip off all the bitter leaves ain't no roots here the word of god goes to work and he'd be oh man it's still there needs to be dealt with but it seems like it springs up at the most unfortunate times family reunions meetings sunday morning boy it's quiet in here this morning that root of bitterness springs up don't it we've all had to deal with it there ain't none of us that haven't had to deal with a root of bitterness it springs up and that's what paul said be careful he said lester root of bitterness springing up all at once it's there where did it come from they were among us for years and root of bitterness sprung up because there's something that happened in the past they never got over and usually again when we're speaking about bitterness in particular it's usually the result of a wounded spirit followed by a decision not to forgive that is a choice you know how we know that because jesus said when you stand praying forgive he didn't say when you stand praying try to forgive make an attempt for gift now a good example that's judas i don't have time to go into it that much but how did the bible says satan entered into judas how did that happen if you go look at it he was mildly rebuked by jesus the bible said he had the bag he was a thief he was standing there when the woman washed jesus feet and he said that money would have been better spent on something else because judas don't care about the sinners about salvation of souls he just cared about money and so he said it'd be better all spent on something else and here he was holding the bag and jesus mildly rebuked him and he got his feelings hurt and you can go look in the scripture immediately he left and went straight to the pharisees what was it it was the straw that broke the camel's back yeah he was the son of perdition but what caused him to actually go that far you know he didn't want to he didn't want to but he didn't deal with the problem and the problem was from his very roots it does no good to blame the ones who did the wounding what if we were working say in construction and and are you still with me this morning let's imagine we were on a job and and i was messing around and maybe i was trying to help and i'm not much of a construction worker but i remember one of the things that was a no-no on the job if there's a board with nails in it you don't leave it on the ground with the nails sticking up right so it's there's a board with nails in it but caleb and maybe you and i are working out there on the job and that's a terrible thought isn't it you've worked with my brother you know what that's like but we'd be working out there and on the ground and i leave a board out like that well i've been yelled at that before when i was a kid we helped out on construction sites and and they'd yell at me and say hey don't do that turn it around stick the nails in the ground or take it and throw it in the scrap heap don't leave it out there on the ground somebody will step on it right so i leave it on the ground you walk by you're not looking and you walk by but you don't you expect the sight to be clean you walk by and you get a nail in your foot now watch no no you got a choice what you're gonna do about that you can stand there and yell at me for leaving the board up yes it's my fault but you need to go to the doctor make sure you've had a tetanus shot and why do they do that i know some of us don't think that's necessary why do they give tetanus shots because if you get locked jaw if you get the the the disease that comes from that one out of 10 people with that disease die so you could literally die from stepping on a rusty nail and your family might gather around and at the funeral and they say oh brother ben was so terrible he left out a nail and but what really killed you think about it because there's a there's an antidote available you all you had to do was get a shot and then you can blame me all you want but you wouldn't die are you hearing me today there there's an antidote available you need to deal with it because that rusty nail will spread that poison will spread and if you've been wounded in your spirit it does no good to stand there and yell at the person who did the wounding it does you absolutely no good you'll stand there and die your body will begin to die why because that bitterness spreads through your body and you say but i died of the nail no you didn't you died because of your refusal to deal with it the wound was not fatal but the poison that wasn't dealt with was fatal being hurt is human but you better deal with that wound now first of all you need to decide if this is a real wound a real hurt or if you're simply an oft offended person because again that's a different thing same symptoms but a different cause if you're a person just gets offended at everything you need to get over that and and i know it's that's it's more nuanced than that i know there may be different different causes for that but you understand you need to deal with that not the offense but if it's real you need to deal with it and this is why jesus taught that if we had something we couldn't get over and again i don't think this ought to be every little thing that happens but something big something we can't get over if you've got something you can't get over you need to go talk with the person that did it i don't want to see them again i want to talk just what the devil wants you to do you got to go deal with it if again if thy brother shall trespass against he go tell him his fault between me and him alone not on the telephone not in the not to the neighbors not to all the other preachers but to you and him alone if he'll hear thee thou has gained thy brother notice this is a brother you can't deal with a person who's not a christian in the same way right you can't bring somebody from the bank brother up here before the church and deal with it you know they're not going to do that unless the person is a christian i guess you could but robbie works at the bank too you could deal with someone that's a christian but not you know not with a personal matter but this is something that someone has done they really did something wrong christians talk to one another do you know that not about one another the church has no authority over a non-christian but to a christian we ought to be held to and that's part of the reason why we are a body a church we have a church because if you don't have a church you have no one to go to you can't ever fulfill this scripture but if you have a church then there's somebody that you can go to it says if he will not hear thee take with thee one or two more in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it to the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man in the public and i will say most people it never gets this far because most of the time the one who did the offending just leaves and he won't deal with you anymore it's just the way it happens most of the time but sometimes it can be dealt with if the person's a real christian you understand and wants to deal with it now it's not to get revenge but to settle the matter you're doing as much for yourself as for them but branham says that he said if i knew tonight that i had an enemy he said i may have i perhaps have but if i do i don't know just who it is he said if it was i sure wouldn't go to preaching till i went first and made that right see if i could get straightened up because we're not supposed to have anything against anyone or if anything we can do let no one have anything against us like if you don't deal with that hurt talk it out husbands and wives the same way if you don't deal with that hurt if you won't talk about it you can't no progress can be made i was dealing with a couple and we had weekly meetings and they come back in the office and and and i said uh so what's happened this week what have you talked about oh we haven't talked to each other this week so well there's nothing i can do if your relationship is the point you won't talk to each other what are we doing here in the office right because you've got to be half you got to have the will to communicate or you can't fix anything i i won't hold you that much longer just stay with me a few minutes are you okay this morning i'm trying not to give the whole load of hay to the to the it's hard to say to the cows that showed up but that sounds terrible [Laughter] to the sheep [Laughter] boy but joel wasn't here to hear that i hope he's not listening and he said it don't say if you have ought against the brother but if the brother has ought against thee see you go to him see if he has a lot of us would say well that's his problem not if you can't get over it it's not go to him if he has the auth and that way we live peaceful how many want to live peaceful how many situations could have been avoided if two people would have sat down and talked something out instead of telling someone else the root of bitterness causes his brother to persecute brother when we should be working together how many believe we should be working together i know it's not always possible i know you can't walk together unless you're agreed but those of us who do agree at least on the big things why can't we work together but a root of bitterness prevents that satan does that look at that first church now he talks in the early church it was the ephesus church age remember the first church age that lost their first love and here comes smyrna was the next church age that come along brother brown said now smyrna means bitterness he said it comes from the word of myrrh and the first church had lost their first love the ephesian church and this church had began to have a root of bitterness coming up in them because at this church the main church the big part the majority of them always was hammering against the holy ghost ruling in the church and they wanted to rule themselves that's where the root of bitterness comes from many times he said now this church had begun to spring up a root of bitterness why it was bitter against those who want to continue on with the holy ghost how many want to continue on with the holy ghost if you want to then there's always going to be a root of bitterness that's against that satan will always try to come against moving on with the holy ghost he said the love had faded away and they were trying to swap it to creeds and denominations getting away oh god can we not see that today getting away from the holy ghost leadership think of that he said that's why the bitterness was in them he said now the first church this bitterness started creeping in he said the second church a little more and finally it kept right in because they were making a better church thought they were right here he said they had something dignified the great roman people could come in he said why they had a pope they had great men cardinals and so forth they dressed fine they got away from all the noise and everything he said they had very quiet they sat back and said them upstarts john the baptist going out there and camels robes camels hair robes too young to even speak to us you realize when jesus come out we need to watch that when jesus come out he was too young to be part of the body that judged him when he stood before the sanhedrin he was too young to be a member of it but he was the word no i'm not the word in that way i'm not the fullness of the word but we have the word so we ought to bow to the word not to a man but we ought to always submit to the word right he said now he said that he said it showed they was now he said they got away from all the noise and everything they had very quiet showed they was dying that's the teaching of the prophet as we said wednesday night the that's the unveiling of the son of man the revealing of the son of man i didn't say that he taught that very quiet so they were dying he said and so they got dignified and they made a better body he said now a church now the church name is associated with the nature of its character he said did you notice smyrna meaning bitter did you notice each one of the church now it's the church name has something to do with the character of the church and this church was called smyrna because it was dying smyrna means bitterness in other words a root of bitterness was coming up and was choking it out it was on its road out to myrrh you say that could never happen here satan wants to do it in every congregation in every part of the land i don't care what congregation you're a part of who your pastor is he wants to bring that root of bitterness in he said a word of bitterness was coming up and was choking it out it was on its road out to myrrh that's what they anoint bodies with myrrh see it was myrrh frankincense as an ointment birth used to anoint dead bodies after they embalmed them and so forth associated with death and the church was dying oh god help me today from a root of bitterness the church was dying he said oh can't you see today friends the great pentecostal move that did have life a few years ago can't you see it's being anointed now with myrrh he said the same ointment was in this church here has come plumbed down and anointing this one down here now he's talking about the laodiceans he said dying out because they're going back to ecclesiastical rags taking off their white robe saints he said the little people who stood out there genuine holy spirit spoke with tongues and manifested god oh is that what you want to do today that's what i want to do is manifest god here was the little people spoke with tongues that manifested god brother they was as honest oh that's part of the manifestation too not just speaking with tongues but being honest brother they was honest all wool and a yard wide they absolutely were genuine you could trust them anywhere he said now you don't know who to what to trust and who to trust realize the condition in the churches today you look at some places and even some pastors i know i can't tell them anything i couldn't i couldn't let them know a burden on my heart because i know they would tell other people that shouldn't know god helped me not to be that way i know others who i i thought i could trust and you look at anything and here we are we have a private maybe disagreement and you look out and it becomes public how did that happen the root of bitterness came in oh god he said now you don't know what to trust and who to trust or something's happened something happened what is they're being anointed with murder bitterness and we got to watch that and i've got to watch that because if if i'm not careful though satan will come in and i'll try to bring that bitterness about that right down in my life he don't care what it's about are you hearing me today he don't care why you're bitter he just wants you to be bitter you can trust them anywhere but they're being something's happened they're being anointed with myrrh of bitterness what had caused it one came in it was the church called first was a general counsel then they called it the assemblies of god out of the assemblies of god come the church of god from the church of god they begin to look across and say your assemblies what caused the root of bitterness well you belong to a different church i was going to cut real quick here real deep here for just a minute we're going to close the root of bitterness was caused because they said you belong to word of life tabernacle you belong to this tabernacle that i don't care what the name is the name doesn't make you right they begin to look at each other as different groups they begin to say your assemblies the other day your church of god go to the rest of that quote he said then out i've got to turn around to read that without my glasses out of that came the united pentecostal church of god on an issue they had a real issue but they separated themselves that's right they said if you're not with us you're janis and jamers if you're not with us your balaam if you're not with us you're this that or the other where did that spirit come from it didn't come from a prophet look first thing you know and he said he said on an issue the first thing you know instead of accepting light and walking in it he said they don't organize themselves so they couldn't accept light oh god what what hour do we live in he said and so and he goes on to explain how that what fellowship was he said so i like that i like a fellowship but when we draw lines like this and say no this is our denomination and we won't reach over and shake hands with the next man and say bless god brother he said my he said that's when you call fellowship i know we had some meetings here not long ago you don't call meetings like that and try to bring everybody in when when everything's just fine everybody gets along with each other you do it when they're not that's what a prophet said that's when you call fellowship when people and you bring people together that won't hardly speak to one another that's the perfect god help me to do that because the temptation always is just forget them they won't listen see satan trying to bring in that root of bitterness again he said reach over and shake hands with the next man and say bless god brother that's when you call fellowship if you don't you get that root of bitterness oh i pray that we would never have that root of bitterness yes we have a church we want to be loyal we want to be faithful but we're a part of the bride whether the leadership changes completely everything changes no we don't know what the future holds we're part of the bride not a denomination a many member bride we are a local church but we're part of the mighty church of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ he said you get that root of bitterness just like the smyrna's got it back there and you caused the same thing what did they cause death paul warned them about it in galatians 5 15. he said but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another you eat you've eaten the poisoned fruit from bitter roots brother branham spoke of that name in the church age book and then i'll go down to the next quote he said it was a bitter age filled with death a bitter age filled with death the two vines within the framework of the church were drifting farther apart with an increased bitterness toward the true vine now look where are we associating ourselves the bitterness was not on the part of the true vine bride doesn't persecute bride and i think you could look at the scripture and find that bride doesn't persecute anybody elect doesn't persecute period jesus never persecuted he spoke the word but he never went and tried to try to destroy him he knew what his end was it was sacrifice that's us we have to preach the truth you understand we got to deal with things sometimes sometimes among ministers we have to deal with things sometimes among churches we have to deal with things you can't just let it lay there you got to deal with it but don't let that root of bitterness come up where you can disagree from one side or the other and come back and say i'm your brother brother say if you don't have the same feeling that you had before he said you don't have the spirit of christ which of you discipline your children and then hated them you don't do that if you do you need to repent you don't discipline your children and hate them be spiteful toward them what did i say you discipline the children and you want them to love on you that's what's so hard when they get older it's harder and harder to get them to do that but when they're little they'll run to you grab hold of you and grab you doesn't that make you feel good why because son daughter i did that for your good i didn't want to don't you know the heart of christ is the same way he said i did that for your good. glory listen that increased bitterness how did men who once called themselves brothers end up torturing and murdering fellow christians roots of bitterness this country has got such a root of bitterness in it among democrats and republicans that if the world continues much longer there'll be a civil war brother against brother if you go back and examine the civil war and you look at it how it happened how the parties raised up and they they use the kind of language that they use and they're doing the same thing today only then you had an abraham lincoln that tried to try to make things right and say with malice toward none we don't have that today roots of bitterness and the whole world is going crazy with it you better die to that thing today don't get caught up in that it's going to destroy this nation don't get caught up in it brother branham talked i've talked about the black people there that got caught up in that in that situation with martin luther king he said it's just they're trying to get them stirred up to where millions of them will die don't you realize it's the same thing that's happening today it's a spirit die to that thing or it'll show up when you least expect it if you don't get rid of the root of bitterness it'll come up while you're preaching it'll show up when you're in your prayer closet it'll show up in your marriage show up in your relationship with your brother and sister how do we dig it out but the brown said you know how to dig a root out we used to take a grubbing hole and just get down at it and dig it till there wasn't a speck left in it and they said if there'd be any root of bitterness bring it up into you grub her out that's right he said that's what the holy spirit does root out all the roots dig them out pile it up burn them get rid of them you get a good crop then if we do that so many times we leave too quickly after the sermons preached and after we feel the presence of god on the place conviction is there and we've dug up all them roots but we just leave them laying on the ground and they find their way back into the soil you've got to burn them now it's the time to burn them how do i do that with the fire of the holy ghost let the holy spirit wash you and cleanse you and the word has scrubbed it out now let the holy spirit wash over you as you begin to worship god he said get rid of them he said you get a good crop then if we do that musicians go ahead and come but the brandon said it's the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let let me never have that root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred you realize that's just as much sin as adultery just as much sin as any adultery as any kind of moral failing a root of bitterness he said it'll take the christ right away from you right out of my life the poison assets of malice jealousy and hatred would test just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night but having a buckle seeing it in a vision that testimony's on youtube by the way the brother that saw that vision and he explains what the vision was he said just set buckles on the whole armor of god he said just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then god will bless you you want to be blessed the children of israel were dealing with bitter waters at mara bitter waters that's poison waters it wasn't that they couldn't drink it because it tasted bad but they couldn't drink it because if they did they'd die it was not drinkable water you couldn't fellowship there oh god and they cried out to the lord and moses god showed moses a tree you remember the story he said he cut down the tree and he threw it into the water and when he did the tree cured the water and brother brandon taught us if we would throw the cross take the cross take self-sacrifice throw it into the water put jesus at the center of everything that we do and what we are it'll sweeten the waters as the song says the waters of mara he'll sweeten for you he drank all the bitter a gethsemane do you believe it today hey man bow your heads with me for a moment i hope i haven't kept you too long don't get bitter but brother ben you stepped on my toes one time too many don't get better about it that don't hurt me not nearly as much as it hurts you you get better about past events i don't care who you are if you constantly preach it you constantly come against it you may be a man of god if you constantly deal it's all the time on your lips what somebody did to you you need to get that root out [Music] my mother my father my sister my brother my church that pastor you don't understand what they did you don't understand what they did to him [Music] how could it be worse that the stripes 39 stripes were put on his back tore the flesh until you could see the bone and his own people did not recognize him i must have hurt the worst when they cried out crucify him give us barabbas oh god must have hurt he was a human being in the flesh he must have hurt [Music] but yet he cried out father forgive them to air as human to forgive is divine father forgive it see but i can't do that no you're you're selling yourself short you have the spirit of christ that that same spirit that dwelled in him dwells in you it'll raise up your mortal body you believe you're going in a rapture one day that body's going to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye you'll see your loved ones you believe that a messenger coming our day to teach us that if you believe that why can't you believe that same god can make give you the ability to forgive people to let it go get the poison out and you can begin to heal but until you get rid of the roots you'll never heal and i know people hate it when you tell them directly but some somebody's got to do it well thank god that there's been people in my life who cared about me in us and when i began to get a root of bitterness they come to me and said for the men you need to watch that you need to be careful i'm so glad that that happened it happened many times in my life i pray it'd be the same way with you today i'm not going to blame the preacher i'm not going to blame anybody else but lord

got to get it out we've got to root it out we've got to constantly weed that garden or there'll be something grow up that'll take the christ right out of our life take us right out of fellowship from the people be sitting off bitter alone god help us never to be that way heavenly father lord jesus we want the sweetness of the holy spirit to be among us we don't want bitterness to be associated
