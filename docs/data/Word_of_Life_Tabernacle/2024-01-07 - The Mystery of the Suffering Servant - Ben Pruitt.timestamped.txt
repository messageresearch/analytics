[39:40] shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his
[39:43] voice to be heard in the street a
[39:46] bruised Reed shall he not break and the
[39:49] smoking flax shall he not quench he
[39:51] shall bring forth judgment unto truth he
[39:55] shall not fail
[39:57] that's talking about Christ here says he
[39:59] will not fail I'm so grateful for that
[40:02] today he shall not fail nor be
[40:05] discouraged till he have set judgment in
[40:07] the earth and the aisle shall wait for
[40:11] his law pray the Lord with that his
[40:12] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[40:14] this
[40:17] morning when Christ come to the Earth he
[40:20] came in
[40:22] a as a manifestation as an expression of
[40:26] the character of God and in that he came
[40:30] and expressed to us that part of God in
[40:34] different ways he he was expressed as
[40:36] what God was and and what God wanted us
[40:39] to see it was God's Masterpiece on the
[40:42] earth and and we know that the prophets
[40:45] could only express so much in in their
[40:47] own lives but each one of them failed in
[40:50] some way not being the the reality of it
[40:53] but there came one who was perfect and
[40:56] there became one who was the reality
[40:57] that we could look at that this is what
[41:00] God is this is deity manifested in human
[41:03] flesh and so we know that one of the
[41:06] things that he manifested one of the
[41:08] ways that he manifested himself to us
[41:10] was as a servant and we talked about one
[41:13] aspect of that here not long ago brother
[41:15] brandom said it was the god of Glory
[41:17] revealing the glory of God that that he
[41:21] came as a footwash funky so that's one
[41:23] type of servant that he came as excuse
[41:26] me was as a footwash flunky a servant
[41:30] who would actually uh would actually
[41:33] come and wash the disciples feet the
[41:35] very lowest form of a servant but he's
[41:39] also spoken of as The Trusted servant or
[41:42] the one who would come and dispense with
[41:45] his father's or with his master's
[41:48] property the one who could be trusted
[41:50] and the one who would be faithful and in
[41:53] doing that he's presented to us as a
[41:55] suffering servant he's presented to us
[41:58] as one who would be faithful and
[42:01] regardless of the suffering regardless
[42:03] of what would take place regardless of
[42:05] the persecution regardless whether he he
[42:08] even had to go to Calvary but he went
[42:10] anyway and I'm so glad that he did I'm
[42:12] so glad that he didn't give up I'm so
[42:14] glad that he pressed his way through and
[42:17] and and there on golgatha he actually he
[42:20] became the sacrifice for sin I'm so glad
[42:23] that he said not my will but thine be
[42:25] done
[42:27] what is he being he's being the
[42:28] suffering servant he's going to become
[42:31] salvation to us and the only way he can
[42:33] do that is by being a faithful
[42:39] servant I believe he wants us to be
[42:42] Faithful
[42:44] Servants how many would agree with that
[42:46] this morning he wants us to be Faithful
[42:48] Servants he wants somebody who can who
[42:51] can be faithful to the cause uh that he
[42:54] has given us the the the the the thing
[42:57] that he's given us to do yes now we we
[43:01] find him revealed in Isaiah and I just
[43:03] want to look at the scripture for just a
[43:04] moment we read uh in Isaiah 42 there's
[43:08] four passages in the book of Isaiah that
[43:10] speak of Messiah as God's suffering
[43:13] servant and they're known as the songs
[43:16] of the suffering servant they it's
[43:18] actually written as a poem and the first
[43:20] one is the one we read Isaiah 42 1-4
[43:24] which reveals Christ as the servant who
[43:27] does not engage in self-promotion right
[43:31] now now if you go and read it he he
[43:33] talks about it he said this is my
[43:34] servant my elect and I put my spirit in
[43:37] him but he said he won't engage in
[43:39] self-promotion he said a bruised read he
[43:42] won't break he he won't cry nor lift up
[43:45] he he won't his voice won't be heard in
[43:47] the street right so he's a servant and I
[43:50] think that's what the kind of servant
[43:52] that he wants today as we are expressing
[43:55] Christ in our own lives he wants
[43:57] Servants of God men and women that will
[43:59] be in the world today that will not will
[44:01] not lift up themselves that will not
[44:03] become the main thing but they'll let
[44:06] him be the main
[44:07] thing so this was him he was the servant
[44:12] who would not engage in
[44:14] self-promotion and it was fulfilled in
[44:16] Christ in Matthew 12 if you go to
[44:18] Matthew
[44:19] 12:14 uh when Jesus heals a man on the
[44:22] Sabbath day and the Pharisees got mad
[44:24] because it upset their Pro
[44:26] it's pretty it's bad when when the
[44:28] movement of God and the spirit of God
[44:30] and and and healing actually upsets the
[44:33] program of the Pharisee but it still
[44:35] does today but we want we want to let
[44:38] God move don't we we want to let God do
[44:40] what he does and let him be who he is
[44:42] let him be the healer let him be the
[44:44] Savior let him move whatever way he
[44:46] wants to move in the church Lord we're
[44:48] giving you Freedom today but they got
[44:51] upset because he healed a man on the
[44:53] Sabbath day all right and it didn't fit
[44:55] with what what they wanted to do so so
[44:58] in Matthew 12:14 says then the Pharisees
[45:01] went out and held a counsel against him
[45:04] how they might destroy him but when
[45:07] Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from
[45:09] then and great multitudes followed him
[45:13] and he healed them all and charged them
[45:16] that they should not make him known so
[45:19] he did the opposite of what a t
[45:21] evangelist today would do all right come
[45:23] on right if they had had a healing te
[45:26] place now this in this place it says he
[45:28] healed them all right but instead of
[45:30] going out and and and and beginning to
[45:33] uh beginning to talk to him and saying
[45:35] you know uh I'm the one look at what
[45:37] I've done you can see what I've done
[45:39] here I must be the one and no he didn't
[45:41] put a big banner up that said the man of
[45:43] the hour he didn't promote himself on
[45:45] social media but what did he do he
[45:47] charged him he said don't even tell
[45:49] about it why he was God's servant yes he
[45:52] was just doing what God required amen
[45:55] amen and and so it says he charged them
[45:57] that they should not make him known that
[45:59] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[46:01] by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my
[46:04] servant whom I have chosen my beloved in
[46:07] whom my soul is well pleased I'll put my
[46:09] spirit upon Him He Shall show judgment
[46:12] to the Gentiles he shall not
[46:14] strive so he will not he will not work
[46:17] and push others down to bring himself up
[46:21] that's he will not cry neither shall any
[46:23] man hear his voice in the street he's
[46:25] not going to go out in the street and
[46:26] says here I and say here I am in fact
[46:30] the world wouldn't even know who he was
[46:33] oh the world the very very few people in
[46:35] the world ever knew Jesus was on the
[46:36] Earth but we know it today why he did
[46:39] what his father called him to
[46:41] do yes you see how he wants us to act
[46:45] and what he wants us to do now he says a
[46:48] bruised Reed shall he not break smoking
[46:51] flax shall he not quench till he send
[46:53] forth judgment unto victory
[46:56] and in his name shall the Gentiles trust
[46:58] so in other words he'll come and he'll
[47:00] do what was he was supposed to do and
[47:03] he'll actually bring Victory but you
[47:06] won't even know he was
[47:08] there Oh my he he he will come and and
[47:12] spend his time and do the things and the
[47:14] people won't even recognize you realize
[47:16] there were people in capernium who
[47:18] bumped into him at the diner who talked
[47:20] to him on the street who who maybe he
[47:22] went and got his uh got things uh done
[47:25] down at the grocer or something like
[47:26] that and went down in the market and
[47:28] they sold him food and they never even
[47:30] realized who he was never even
[47:32] recognized he appeared as just a normal
[47:34] man he was God's suffering servant he
[47:37] was willing to be just an everyday guy
[47:39] he didn't look like a leader brother say
[47:41] he didn't look much like a man uh that
[47:43] would be a leader or a king but he was
[47:46] the king yeah why he was God's servant
[47:49] yes
[47:50] sir now and in his name show the
[47:53] Gentiles trust brother Brown said will
[47:55] notice him what made him different as a
[47:58] speaker I guess he wasn't so forceful
[48:01] and get out in the street like we do and
[48:03] scream because the Bible said his voice
[48:05] was not heard in the street yeah a
[48:07] bruised readed and a smoking flax and so
[48:09] forth as the prophet said he would be so
[48:12] he was just something about his talk oh
[48:15] I want that to be me I want that to be
[48:17] all of us I want that to be this church
[48:18] that we would not be engaged in
[48:20] self-promotion but that we would become
[48:22] the Servants of God until we would not
[48:25] promote
[48:26] ourselves and we would not let our we
[48:29] would not defend ourselves but that we
[48:32] would just do the will of God Amen he
[48:35] said it was just something about his
[48:36] talk that caught the heart of the people
[48:39] yes oh I trust there's something about
[48:41] the word today you didn't come to the
[48:43] house of God to hear a man or to see a
[48:45] man you come for the word of God I
[48:48] appreciate you coming when I'm not here
[48:50] because that tells me you're not coming
[48:52] for the man you're not here just cuz you
[48:53] think the pastor will get mad at you but
[48:55] you come because you want to hear the
[48:57] word of the Lord and the word of the
[48:59] Lord is the same no matter who's
[49:01] preaching
[49:03] it he was just something about his talk
[49:06] that caught the heart of the people I I
[49:09] that's what caught me I appreciate the
[49:12] signs and the Wonders and the things
[49:13] like that but there was something about
[49:15] this message something about the words
[49:18] that the prophet was saying I didn't
[49:19] fall in love with a prophet I fell in
[49:22] love with the word and the prophet was
[49:24] pointing me to Crow
[49:27] something about his talk caught the
[49:29] heart of people he didn't have to be so
[49:32] forceful about it in an outward
[49:33] demonstration but there was something
[49:35] down in his talk that fascinated the
[49:38] hearts of people so this is a
[49:42] servant he he said he will not cry in
[49:44] the street he he will not bruise A a
[49:47] bruised Reed he won't break yeah now
[49:51] brother Brenham says this he says in a
[49:53] in a prayer he said if there be any
[49:56] That's Falling by the
[49:58] wayside strengthen that one that feeble
[50:02] knee oh that's my prayer this morning
[50:04] you may be right at the very end where
[50:06] you feel like you can't take it anymore
[50:08] and you're just about to turn out of the
[50:10] way and I pray that the spirit of God
[50:12] would come over you this morning and
[50:14] would grab a hold of you and arrest you
[50:16] and the spirit of God will strengthen
[50:18] you
[50:19] today a bruised Reed he will not break
[50:22] right or a smoking flax will he not
[50:24] quench
[50:26] see brother Ben I've been bruised but
[50:28] the spirit of God he will not break you
[50:30] he doesn't want to break you he doesn't
[50:32] want to destroy you he wants to mend
[50:35] you yes sir we know that he will brother
[50:38] B said we know he will never turn away a
[50:41] bruised
[50:42] readed he would mend it yes oh that's
[50:46] God's servant today he would never turn
[50:49] away so well they're not good enough to
[50:50] come to this church they're not good
[50:52] enough to do this s or the other no he
[50:54] won't turn away a bruised tree
[50:56] he'll mend the bruised read I think
[50:57] that'll we have to declare the word of
[50:59] God we've got to tell the truth I've got
[51:01] a responsibility to preach the truth
[51:03] I've got to but let me be one when the
[51:06] BR when the when when the Reed is
[51:07] bruised let me be one who says there's
[51:09] something here to menend you there is a
[51:11] bomb in Gilead there is a physician here
[51:14] there is a power of God that can make
[51:16] you different yes
[51:19] sir he will not would not be a lord over
[51:22] God's Heritage but his goal would be to
[51:25] love
[51:26] God and love people yes if you want to
[51:29] be successful in Ministry and I mean
[51:31] real success right you love God and you
[51:36] love people and you'll be a success
[51:39] that's right love God and love people
[51:42] just recently brother BR said was asking
[51:45] me about some very precious Brethren
[51:47] that said now that we've come into the
[51:49] way brother brandom now that we've found
[51:50] the Lord and received the Holy Ghost
[51:52] should we seek gifts for our ministry
[51:53] that we should do I said don't never do
[51:56] it all right don't never do it don't
[52:00] never advise people to do something like
[52:03] that cuz usually a guy that wants to do
[52:06] it is a guy that can't do it all right
[52:09] he said it's the guy that's trying to
[52:11] run from it is the one that God uses see
[52:15] if he's trying to get away from it he
[52:16] said oh brother I tell you the calling
[52:18] is in me so you got to recognize you
[52:20] have a call to do whatever you're going
[52:22] to do for the Lord he said but woo man
[52:25] I'd hate to try that he said well there
[52:27] you are he said that's trying to run if
[52:30] he wants to do it so bad the first thing
[52:31] you know he finds himself a stuff shirt
[52:34] like you say God you give me power to
[52:36] move mountains I tell you I'll do
[52:37] something for you if you let me move
[52:39] mountains no he wouldn't he can't even
[52:42] move himself to the right attitude right
[52:45] I love that you want to move mountains
[52:48] Move Yourself to the right attitude
[52:49] first start treating people right then
[52:52] you can move mountains you want to stand
[52:53] behind the pulpit and preach start
[52:55] treating people right start living for
[52:57] God start doing what you can for the
[52:59] house of God you want to be a deacon or
[53:00] a trustee or something else and then God
[53:03] knows we need those people we need you
[53:05] and I'm thankful for the ones that we
[53:06] have but if you want to be that you got
[53:08] to start serving God's people you got to
[53:12] start loving God's people move yourself
[53:15] to the right attitude then God can use
[53:18] you and so he said so if God is calling
[53:21] you brother and he keeps digging at your
[53:23] heart I'd say lay aside every way and
[53:26] the sin that does so easily beset you
[53:29] you see but if it's not digging at you
[53:31] he said I wouldn't think too much about
[53:32] it just let it come to its
[53:35] place got to be something Jeremiah said
[53:37] it's a fire shut up in my bones I can't
[53:40] help it I've got to preach I I don't
[53:42] want to preach but I got to preach I I
[53:44] don't want to I don't want to be in
[53:46] front of people it's not my nature to be
[53:48] here in front of people but but there's
[53:50] something about it I've got to declare
[53:52] the word of the Lord so as long as I
[53:53] have opportunity let me stand here and
[53:55] do that let me fulfill the word of the
[53:58] Lord let me say what a prophet said let
[54:01] me preach the message of the hour
[54:02] somebody's got to do it let me be a
[54:05] servant that's willing to stand and do
[54:07] it somebody's got to be willing to do
[54:10] it
[54:13] yes and he said just let it come to its
[54:17] place the Bible tells us promotion
[54:19] cometh neither from the East nor from
[54:21] the West nor from the South but God is
[54:24] the judge
[54:25] he putteth down one and Seth up another
[54:29] I was reading while I was gone I read
[54:31] the uh uh autobiography of of President
[54:35] Grant us Grant and he was talking about
[54:38] the war he was a general in the war and
[54:40] he said this he I wrote it down he said
[54:42] it is men who wait to be selected not
[54:45] those who seek from whom we may always
[54:48] expect the most efficient
[54:50] service right because they're not
[54:52] promoting themselves they'll be a
[54:54] servant
[54:56] the second one in Isaiah is in Isaiah
[54:59] 491
[55:00] 1-6 and it depicts a servant who will
[55:03] persevere in his ministry even though
[55:06] the results aren't there now I want to
[55:09] really dwell on this for a moment
[55:10] because I want to be that as a pastor
[55:13] but you want to be that as a parent you
[55:15] want to be that as a as a church member
[55:18] you want to be that as a grandparent
[55:20] somebody that'll persevere in prayer
[55:22] even though it seems like the results
[55:24] aren't there
[55:25] even though it seems like your kids are
[55:27] just as far going as they ever were but
[55:28] you're going to keep praying anyway even
[55:31] though it seems like things are not
[55:32] going and and you're not seeing the
[55:34] results that you want to see but you
[55:36] keep coming to the house of God you keep
[55:38] doing what God called you to do you
[55:39] might have been sick for years and years
[55:41] and yet you keep on claiming your
[55:43] healing you your kids might have been in
[55:45] a bad place but you keep on claiming
[55:47] your children why do you do that because
[55:49] you're a servant of God there's
[55:51] something in you it's a spirit of Christ
[55:53] in you wanting calling out out wanting
[55:56] to bring that person to the place where
[55:58] they ought to
[55:59] be so it's a servant who will persevere
[56:03] listen to how Isaiah puts it Isaiah 49
[56:05] And1 listen on ales unto me and hearken
[56:08] you people from farar the Lord has
[56:11] called me from the womb from the bowels
[56:13] of my mother have he made mention of my
[56:15] name so he says I I I've been called to
[56:17] be what I am I was born to be this Heath
[56:21] made my mouth like a sharp sword in the
[56:23] shadow of his hand of he hi me he made
[56:25] me a polished shaft in his quiver hath
[56:27] he hid me and said unto me thou art my
[56:30] servant oh Israel and whom I will be
[56:33] glorified then I said now watch and I
[56:36] think every one of us gets to this place
[56:38] at some point in our life and our
[56:40] ministry in our service in the office
[56:43] that we fill we get into a place where
[56:45] we say this I said I have labored in
[56:48] vain I have spent my strength for not
[56:52] and in vain he said yet surely my
[56:55] judgment is with the Lord so in other
[56:57] words I can't look at what people say I
[57:00] need to look at what God is saying I
[57:03] can't let social media be the judge of
[57:05] whether or not I I've been a success I'm
[57:07] not going to let the world be the judge
[57:09] or whether or not let me laugh at me
[57:10] make fun of me because the way I dress
[57:12] or what I do but I'm going to let God be
[57:14] the judge I'm not going to get
[57:16] discouraged until I see the work of the
[57:18] Lord go forward amen so he said I he
[57:21] said I've labored in vain and I've spent
[57:23] my strength for not but surely my
[57:26] judgment is with the Lord he said now
[57:29] sayith the Lord that formed me from the
[57:30] womb to be his servant to bring Jacob
[57:33] again to him though Israel be not
[57:35] gathered Oh my he said though I don't
[57:38] see the result of it listen to me church
[57:40] it's so important especially if you're
[57:42] going to be involved in Ministry if
[57:44] you're going to be involved in church
[57:46] leadership you or with your families you
[57:49] need to recognize that you're not always
[57:51] going to see the results you want to see
[57:54] right sir you're not always going to see
[57:56] some of you that work out you know what
[57:58] I'm talking
[58:01] about brother Daniel you know you're not
[58:04] always going to see the results you want
[58:05] to see the first day you're not always
[58:08] going to see it the second day you're
[58:10] not always going to see it the fifth day
[58:12] yeah all right right but if you keep
[58:14] doing it if you can keep doing it if you
[58:17] can persevere now I haven't been able to
[58:20] persevere very well in that way but I'll
[58:22] say this the very first day I started to
[58:24] pre I didn't see the results that I
[58:26] wanted to see as a 12 13 14 year old boy
[58:29] I didn't always see it when I was 16 but
[58:31] JT when we I was 20 years old and I
[58:33] started pastoring there at branville I
[58:35] didn't always see the results we wanted
[58:37] to see but we kept coming back we kept
[58:39] preaching preaching the gospel and I'm
[58:41] saying that not to elevate myself but to
[58:43] tell you it
[58:44] works eventually you begin to see the
[58:47] results you don't see them all at once
[58:48] but eventually if you love God and you
[58:51] love people eventually you begin to see
[58:54] what you or what you've been looking for
[58:56] the whole time yes oh you begin to see a
[58:58] place you know I just wanted a place I
[59:00] could take my kids where there's no
[59:02] there's no drama and stuff going on
[59:04] we're not trying to hurt anybody we're
[59:06] just trying to preach the word we just
[59:07] want a place where we can preach the
[59:09] message and I can preach whatever I see
[59:11] in the message and you can amen it if
[59:13] it's the word I just want the freedom of
[59:14] the Holy Spirit to be able to move and
[59:16] we're about to see some results from
[59:18] that but if we don't see the results we
[59:20] want today we'll keep preaching for
[59:22] tomorrow if we don't see them tomorrow
[59:24] we preaching the next
[59:27] day don't get discouraged because it's
[59:30] not what you think it ought to be right
[59:31] now yes sir keep working keep
[59:35] pushing oh my that's what God's servant
[59:38] did yes oh my that's what his his great
[59:41] servant Christ it's what he
[59:46] did said though Israel be not
[59:50] gathered yet shall I be glorious in the
[59:53] eyes of the Lord my God shall be my
[59:56] strength he said it is a light thing
[59:59] that thou should us be my servant to
[1:00:01] raise up the tribes of Jacob and to
[1:00:04] restore the preserved of Israel I will
[1:00:07] also he said give thee for a light to
[1:00:09] the Gentiles that thou mayest be my
[1:00:12] salvation unto the end of the Earth but
[1:00:14] you know Jesus didn't go to the Gentiles
[1:00:18] while he was
[1:00:19] alive in fact for his ministry to be
[1:00:22] effective to the Gentiles he had to die
[1:00:25] yeah Oh my he was sent to the lost sheep
[1:00:28] of Israel but to be affective of the
[1:00:30] body to the Gentiles he could not be
[1:00:32] affected and that's why he the S
[1:00:34] Phoenician woman come before him and he
[1:00:36] wouldn't even recognize her the first
[1:00:37] time why because she was a gentile yeah
[1:00:40] and he told the disciples he said go to
[1:00:41] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[1:00:43] don't even go to the Gentiles all right
[1:00:45] and when they come to see him when the
[1:00:46] Greeks come to see him they said sir we
[1:00:48] would see Jesus and he wouldn't even he
[1:00:50] said except a corn of wheat fall into
[1:00:52] the ground it can't become what it is is
[1:00:55] what it's supposed to be but what was it
[1:00:57] he was looking to the Future the Bible
[1:00:59] said for the joy that was set before him
[1:01:02] he endured the cross what was the joy
[1:01:04] we're his bride the Gentiles were called
[1:01:07] to be a bride you believe that we're his
[1:01:09] wife and so to be his wife to gain his
[1:01:11] wife he had to die oh if we could look
[1:01:14] not at what's going on right now but if
[1:01:15] we could crucify the Flesh and bear our
[1:01:17] cross carry our cross and let the future
[1:01:20] results be what they are yes good
[1:01:24] trusting and believing that God's going
[1:01:26] to bring it about if we'll just be
[1:01:29] faithful this is quoted by Simeon in
[1:01:31] Luke Chapter
[1:01:34] 2 think of the old the old Prophet the
[1:01:39] old man of great spiritual ability to be
[1:01:42] able to expect an expectation of the
[1:01:45] coming of Christ and he walks down to
[1:01:49] Jesus the Lord has told him he said
[1:01:51] before before you die you're going to to
[1:01:54] see the salvation of the
[1:01:56] Lord and you know maybe in his mind he
[1:02:00] thought well I'm going to see Israel
[1:02:03] delivered I'm going to see the Romans
[1:02:05] run off and I'm going to see all the
[1:02:07] things happen but it's not what he got
[1:02:09] to
[1:02:10] see the Fulfillment of the prophecy that
[1:02:13] was given to him was much different
[1:02:15] maybe than what he initially thought it
[1:02:17] would be and I think we need to not
[1:02:19] despise the day of small things we need
[1:02:21] to be able to recognize as God's
[1:02:23] servants when God's doing something and
[1:02:26] recognize it in seed form and see the
[1:02:29] potential of what it's going to be yes
[1:02:31] otherwise you'll get discouraged and
[1:02:33] you'll quit all
[1:02:35] right right because you know maybe you
[1:02:37] come here and I know several folks here
[1:02:40] are new to the church or new to the area
[1:02:42] and you'll come and you expect certain
[1:02:43] things and you expect things to to go
[1:02:46] better for you and or you wouldn't come
[1:02:48] here you want you want your children to
[1:02:50] have friends and you want things to
[1:02:52] happen and you you wouldn't come here
[1:02:53] otherwise you want you want it to be
[1:02:55] right and anytime you come to a
[1:02:57] different church or a new church or or
[1:02:58] you start coming back to church you you
[1:03:00] think well everything's going to be good
[1:03:02] and and yet you you'll face obstacles
[1:03:04] when when you come and and there'll be
[1:03:06] people that maybe aren't maybe they're
[1:03:08] human and and you find out that they're
[1:03:10] human and they don't always treat you
[1:03:12] like they should and and you'll find out
[1:03:14] that there's there's situations that
[1:03:15] that'll go wrong and you'll think well
[1:03:17] uh maybe you get discouraged but
[1:03:19] remember you got to be able to see and
[1:03:21] Seed form what God's doing you got to be
[1:03:23] able to see what the future holds you
[1:03:25] got to be able to see I won't have my
[1:03:27] children forever and maybe everything's
[1:03:29] not perfect right now but we're building
[1:03:31] something and we're pressing towards
[1:03:33] something and it'll never be perfect
[1:03:34] till we get in a Rapture get a body
[1:03:36] change but we're pressing for that we're
[1:03:38] moving towards that we're not a perfect
[1:03:41] church but we're we're we're pressing to
[1:03:43] something so you've got to be able to
[1:03:45] see it in seed form and look at it and
[1:03:48] say God this is what you've called me to
[1:03:50] I'm not going to quit I'm not going to
[1:03:52] give up I'm going to let God be God and
[1:03:55] I'm just going to keep coming to the
[1:03:56] house of God you said but I'm not
[1:03:57] perfect I I thought I'd have lost some
[1:03:59] of these besetting sins I thought I
[1:04:01] would be healed I thought these things
[1:04:03] would happen just keep plugging away
[1:04:05] just keep coming back to the throne keep
[1:04:07] coming back to the house of God be
[1:04:09] patient with God see it in its infancy
[1:04:12] yes sir because one day it'll be grown
[1:04:14] up maybe you won't even realize it and
[1:04:16] you look and say wait a minute what I
[1:04:17] longed for is here yes amen yes what I
[1:04:21] worked for is coming yes
[1:04:25] so Simeon takes up Jesus in his
[1:04:28] arms blessed God and said
[1:04:31] Lord now letest thou thy servant depart
[1:04:34] in peace according to Thy word look at
[1:04:37] the great faith the man had for mine
[1:04:40] eyes have seen thy salvation many
[1:04:42] couldn't see him in a baby form they
[1:04:44] couldn't recognize that that was God
[1:04:46] coming down wrapping himself in flesh
[1:04:48] but Simeon recognized who he was and
[1:04:51] today many people can't see that this
[1:04:53] message will ever be anything thing but
[1:04:54] they can't see that the seed to the
[1:04:56] Rapture has already been planted and the
[1:04:58] plant is growing come
[1:05:00] on the bride's becoming a mature bride
[1:05:06] yes he said let thy servant depart in
[1:05:08] peace for mine eyes have seen thy
[1:05:10] salvation which thou has prepared before
[1:05:12] the face of all people a light to light
[1:05:15] in the Gentiles and the glory of thy
[1:05:17] People Israel I want you to take heart
[1:05:20] some of you Elders that have been
[1:05:21] working in the church for many many many
[1:05:23] years the seeds of God's word that you
[1:05:26] helped to plant that you tilled the soil
[1:05:28] for that you worked for all of these
[1:05:31] years it's beginning to come about bow
[1:05:33] there's going to be a Rapture one of
[1:05:34] these days we're going to see it you may
[1:05:36] not see it in your lifetime but you can
[1:05:38] say I can depart in peace because I've
[1:05:40] seen the salvation of Israel I've seen
[1:05:42] the word born in the hearts of the
[1:05:44] people and I know that this message will
[1:05:46] carry them all the way
[1:05:50] through you can see the potential of
[1:05:52] what this baby would be
[1:05:54] even though no one else recognized it he
[1:05:56] said this is my servant he won't be
[1:05:58] discouraged he won't be discouraged be a
[1:06:01] light to the Gentiles even though he has
[1:06:02] to die first think of David's men who
[1:06:06] were there brother Bram talks about in
[1:06:07] why little Bethlehem how that David's
[1:06:10] men would would
[1:06:11] gather and they were they would stayed
[1:06:14] with David even though he was a fugitive
[1:06:16] even though he was an outlaw even though
[1:06:18] he's running from the law but they
[1:06:20] stayed with him because they believed in
[1:06:21] the potential of what he would be
[1:06:25] they said someday he's going to be the
[1:06:26] king yeah and David was caught between
[1:06:29] that Philistine Army and he was there on
[1:06:31] the hillside and he looked down 15 miles
[1:06:33] away and he thought about Bethlehem he
[1:06:35] said oh for a drink of the water from
[1:06:37] the well at Bethlehem and he didn't even
[1:06:39] ask for it he didn't he didn't direct
[1:06:41] them to go do it but his men heard it
[1:06:43] and when they heard it his wish become
[1:06:45] their command and they fought their way
[1:06:47] through 15 miles of Philistines to bring
[1:06:49] a fresh drink of bethlehem's water back
[1:06:51] to David when they got back he poured it
[1:06:53] out he said I'm not even worthy of this
[1:06:55] sacrifice what was it what was it they
[1:06:57] recognized who he would be they could
[1:07:00] see him as a king even though he was a
[1:07:02] fugitive at the time oh that you could
[1:07:03] see this message for more than what the
[1:07:05] internet says that it is if you could
[1:07:07] see this message for more than what the
[1:07:09] world around you says that it is but
[1:07:11] there's a reality to it there's a seed
[1:07:13] that's been planted there's a Rapture
[1:07:15] coming there's a king that'll sit on the
[1:07:17] throne of David do you believe it today
[1:07:20] oh that you can see it in the form it's
[1:07:22] in and say I'm willing to fight for I'm
[1:07:24] willing to bring him a fresh drink of
[1:07:26] Pentecostal water I'm willing to worship
[1:07:28] even though I may not feel like
[1:07:30] worshiping I'm willing to raise my hands
[1:07:32] so I may not feel like raising my hands
[1:07:34] I'm going to preach whether I feel like
[1:07:36] it or not why because I know that he's
[1:07:38] going to be king so I'm going to treat
[1:07:41] him like a king I'm going to treat him
[1:07:43] like a king right now because I know
[1:07:45] what he will
[1:07:47] be good yes sir do you believe that
[1:07:52] today
[1:07:57] his servant yeah would recognize we're
[1:07:59] not rewarded for our success but for our
[1:08:03] faithfulness
[1:08:05] amen elzer was Abraham's faithful
[1:08:08] servant it's a great type of
[1:08:11] Christ also the messenger in this
[1:08:14] day brother brandom said he said we say
[1:08:16] big numbers God don't notice big numbers
[1:08:19] all right God looks for
[1:08:22] character he said El
[1:08:24] sweated it out I like that elizer
[1:08:28] sweated it out till he found character
[1:08:31] in Rebecca yes then he had to get her
[1:08:33] dressed up ready let her stand still and
[1:08:36] listen at his message yeah he said the
[1:08:38] trouble of it is today when you find
[1:08:40] character it's hard to make them stand
[1:08:42] still long enough to put on clothes and
[1:08:45] get dressed up all right we need to
[1:08:48] stand still and let the message dress us
[1:08:51] today but El are sweated it out now he
[1:08:55] said you'll be a light to the Gentiles
[1:08:56] brother brandom taught us we're only
[1:08:58] responsible to scatter the light yeah
[1:09:01] it'll be a light to those maybe that we
[1:09:03] don't even know we don't even recognize
[1:09:06] who we've impacted with our life but we
[1:09:09] got to let it be that way and not demand
[1:09:12] the recognition but just say Lord let me
[1:09:14] live in such a way that the postman
[1:09:17] knows I'm a Christian that the housewife
[1:09:19] knows I'm a Christian that the person I
[1:09:21] do business with knows I'm a Christian
[1:09:23] let me live in such a way that the light
[1:09:25] is scattered to every possible corner of
[1:09:27] the country that I would never show my
[1:09:29] just my Humanity but that you could show
[1:09:31] yourself through me let me be your eyes
[1:09:34] let me be your feet Let Me Be Your
[1:09:36] Hands let me be you in in body form good
[1:09:41] yes and you may never see the results of
[1:09:43] that but the light is still
[1:09:46] scattered the third time Isaiah speaks
[1:09:50] of the servant is in Isaiah 50 4th
[1:09:53] through N I just I just love the word of
[1:09:56] the Lord It's So Perfect yeah and we
[1:09:58] believe the Bible do you believe the
[1:10:00] Bible today the Bible is right the Bible
[1:10:03] is Right old song said I know the Bible
[1:10:06] is Right somebody's wrong so the Bible's
[1:10:09] right so we we want to take what we
[1:10:10] believe from the word of God and that's
[1:10:12] where a prophet he was a word prophet he
[1:10:14] come what he believed from the word of
[1:10:16] God and and and Shine the Light on that
[1:10:19] word that we would understand what it is
[1:10:21] without a prophet we wouldn't understand
[1:10:23] Isaiah 50 and4 says the Lord God ha
[1:10:26] given me the tongue of the learned I
[1:10:28] should know how to speak a word in
[1:10:31] season so God's servant now if you're
[1:10:34] following me now his servant was one who
[1:10:37] would not get discouraged yeah he was
[1:10:40] one who would who put up with hardship
[1:10:42] yeah he was one who was not a
[1:10:44] self-promoter and he was one who could
[1:10:46] speak a word in season yes to him that
[1:10:49] is weary he wenth morning by morning he
[1:10:52] wenth by ear to hear as the learned the
[1:10:55] Lord God ha opened my ear and I was not
[1:10:59] rebellious neither turned away back so
[1:11:01] in other words I just I just repeated
[1:11:03] what I heard so the servant would be one
[1:11:06] who would say nothing except what God
[1:11:08] told him to say I'd say God help me to
[1:11:10] be that kind of a servant today God help
[1:11:12] all of us to be that kind of a
[1:11:14] servant the Lord's opened my ears and I
[1:11:16] and I was not rebellious I gave my back
[1:11:19] to the smiters so if the word called for
[1:11:22] me you so he was not rebellious to the
[1:11:25] word that even hurt
[1:11:26] him the word said that he would oh my
[1:11:31] his his his form would be marred the
[1:11:32] word said that they would they would use
[1:11:34] a whip on him and he was not rebellious
[1:11:37] to that word he said even so let it be
[1:11:40] yes sir not my will but thine be done I
[1:11:44] gave my back to the smiters my cheeks to

[1:17:15] Bound by the love of God that constrains
[1:17:18] me to his church brother BR said
[1:17:20] something that he often said and it's
[1:17:21] made me think brother so many many times
[1:17:24] he said I've often thought what I would
[1:17:26] do with two drops of the literal blood
[1:17:28] of Jesus Christ in a
[1:17:32] glass now you can say all you want to
[1:17:34] about it wouldn't mean nothing to you it
[1:17:38] would if you
[1:17:40] knew that the two drops of blood that
[1:17:43] you had was the blood that was spilled
[1:17:46] for
[1:17:48] you how would you treat it all
[1:17:52] right yeah you'd put it in a case put
[1:17:55] that case in a bigger case put that in a
[1:17:58] safe deposit box in the in the bank you
[1:18:01] you you'd make sure it was
[1:18:03] protected you'd want people to see it
[1:18:06] but you wouldn't want any danger to come
[1:18:07] near it you'd put it on a soft pillow
[1:18:10] you'd make sure if you had to hold it in
[1:18:12] your hands that you didn't drop it yeah
[1:18:15] and brother BR talks about that and he
[1:18:16] says if I had those two drops what would
[1:18:18] I do he said I wouldn't want to spill it
[1:18:20] I would hold it to my chest up to my
[1:18:22] heart and say Lord God how I appreciate
[1:18:25] this Blood sir oh God but in his sight
[1:18:29] he said I have greater this afternoon
[1:18:31] I've got the purchase of his blood
[1:18:33] before me do you realize who you are
[1:18:35] this morning you're not just a a bunch
[1:18:37] of people that have belied some some
[1:18:39] things some Doctrine and come together
[1:18:41] you're the purchase of the blood of
[1:18:43] Jesus Christ you're what he died for the
[1:18:46] most precious perfect sinless blood that
[1:18:48] there's ever been the only perfect one
[1:18:51] that's ever been spilled his blood for
[1:18:54] you believe I he spilled it for you then
[1:18:57] how should I treat you the same way I
[1:18:59] would that literal blood
[1:19:02] amen yes I do everything I could to
[1:19:04] speak a word in season
[1:19:08] yeah to watch my words to watch my
[1:19:11] actions oh God help me today but he
[1:19:13] don't want that just from preachers he
[1:19:15] wants that from each and every one of us
[1:19:18] how should we treat one another if we
[1:19:19] knew that we were the purchase of his
[1:19:21] blood
[1:19:25] good he said how should I treat you he
[1:19:28] said he loved you better than he loved
[1:19:29] his own
[1:19:31] life how should I treat you
[1:19:33] honest
[1:19:35] sincerely he said in sin I must call out
[1:19:39] no matter how bad it hurts you or I but
[1:19:43] because you're precious to God yeah he's
[1:19:45] going to have a bride without spot a
[1:19:47] wrinkle so he'll call his ministers
[1:19:49] sometimes to say things that hurt
[1:19:51] people sometimes it'll hurt you but
[1:19:53] they're not doing it for the purpose of
[1:19:55] hurting if they are they don't belong in
[1:19:56] the Pulpit right but they do it why do
[1:19:59] they have to do it because they
[1:20:00] recognize the preciousness of the blood
[1:20:03] of the purchase of his blood I must do
[1:20:05] everything that I can to be honest and
[1:20:07] upright and a servant to
[1:20:11] Christ the fourth song are you still
[1:20:14] with me this
[1:20:16] morning the fourth song is found in
[1:20:18] Isaiah 52 and
[1:20:20] 53 it'd be much more famili Amar to you
[1:20:24] beginning with verse 13 of Isaiah 52
[1:20:27] speaking of a servant who is exalted
[1:20:29] through suffering the Way Up Is
[1:20:33] Down said behold my servant verse 13
[1:20:37] behold my servant shall deal prudently
[1:20:40] he shall be exalted and extolled and be
[1:20:43] very high and the next verse seems like
[1:20:46] it doesn't even fit with the 13th verse
[1:20:49] but it
[1:20:50] does said as many were astonished at
[1:20:54] thee you know when he said if I be
[1:20:56] lifted up I'll draw a men to me he
[1:20:58] wasn't talking about us talking good
[1:21:00] about him he's speaking about his
[1:21:03] death that's how he got
[1:21:06] exalted oh my that's how he was lifted
[1:21:09] up he was lifted up above the Earth so
[1:21:11] that men could see this is the Salvation
[1:21:14] of
[1:21:14] God as many as were Aston at the his
[1:21:18] Visage was so marred more than any man
[1:21:22] come on in other words see they beat him
[1:21:24] until you couldn't even tell that he was
[1:21:25] a human being all right oh God and his
[1:21:30] his form more than the sons of men yes
[1:21:34] verse 15 so shall he sprinkle many
[1:21:37] nations Oh my he had to be beaten he had
[1:21:40] to be brought down so he could be lifted
[1:21:42] up he shall sprinkle many nations the
[1:21:45] Kings shall shut their mouths at him for
[1:21:47] they which had not been told them for
[1:21:49] that which had not been told them shall
[1:21:50] they see and that which they had not
[1:21:52] heard shall they they
[1:21:53] consider who ha believed our report to
[1:21:56] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:21:58] he's talking about his servant yes he
[1:22:00] shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:22:01] plant as a root out of dry ground
[1:22:03] speaking of the Virgin birth Heath no
[1:22:05] form nor comeliness and when we shall
[1:22:07] see him there is no beauty that we
[1:22:09] should desire him he comes as the
[1:22:11] servant of
[1:22:12] Jehovah he comes as the steward of
[1:22:16] Salvation oh God to distribute salvation
[1:22:19] to us his only purpose is to serve his
[1:22:22] master to serve his father so he comes
[1:22:25] and he's despised and rejected of men a
[1:22:28] Man of Sorrows acquinted with grief we
[1:22:31] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[1:22:33] despised we esteemed him not surely he
[1:22:36] has borne our griefs and carried our
[1:22:38] sorrows do you have a sorrow today do
[1:22:40] you have a grief is there something
[1:22:41] that's bothering you do you have anxiety
[1:22:43] in your life let him bear that he come
[1:22:45] to do that amen he has borne our griefs
[1:22:48] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:22:51] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:22:53] Afflicted yes but he was wounded for our
[1:22:57] transgressions yes yes so he become the
[1:23:01] servant of God come on yes sir and God
[1:23:05] told his servant he said go get me a
[1:23:08] bride are you with me now in the
[1:23:10] allegory of it in the drama of it so he
[1:23:13] wraps himself in flesh and he becomes
[1:23:15] the servant of
[1:23:17] Jehovah he comes down to get a bride and
[1:23:20] how's he going to get this bride this
[1:23:22] would teach some of yall looking for a
[1:23:24] wife some
[1:23:26] things if we have anybody looking for a
[1:23:28] wife or a husband you want to know how
[1:23:30] to gain a
[1:23:32] spouse this is how he did
[1:23:36] it he completely surrendered himself to
[1:23:40] the will of
[1:23:42] God come
[1:23:44] on yes sir you want to know how to get a
[1:23:47] Ministry how to do something for God
[1:23:50] it's complete surrender ER to the will
[1:23:54] of
[1:23:54] God he went to get his wife and how did
[1:23:58] he do it now the servant said I'll do
[1:24:00] whatever it takes what did elizar say
[1:24:03] Lord Prosper my journey he said I'll
[1:24:06] send my angel before you he said
[1:24:08] whatever it takes I want to get that
[1:24:11] wife my soulle mission in life if I die
[1:24:14] doing it I'm going to go do it and what
[1:24:15] did Jesus do he come to get a wife for
[1:24:18] Jehovah and when he did what did he do
[1:24:21] as the servant remember he presenting
[1:24:22] him as a servant today as a servant of
[1:24:25] God he comes he's despised and rejected
[1:24:27] a man he has to be beaten but if that's
[1:24:29] what it takes to to dispense salvation
[1:24:32] because the servant was the steward who
[1:24:33] would dispense to each one that part of
[1:24:36] his master's Goods that that that would
[1:24:38] that would cause the uh economy of his
[1:24:40] master to run smoothly so in the economy
[1:24:43] of God he is the dispenser of Salvation
[1:24:46] and in order to do that he has to be
[1:24:48] beaten he has to be blooded he has to be
[1:24:50] bruised yes
[1:24:53] you think we're going to get by with
[1:24:54] anything less all right come on I think
[1:24:57] about
[1:24:59] it he was
[1:25:01] wounded for my transgressions we could
[1:25:03] put our name there can we do that this
[1:25:05] morning he was bruised for Benjamin PR
[1:25:08] its
[1:25:09] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:25:11] was upon him with his stripes I am
[1:25:16] healed oh my we can say it like that
[1:25:19] this morning all we like sheep have gone
[1:25:21] astray we've turned everyone to his own
[1:25:23] way and the Lord hath laid on him the
[1:25:26] iniquity of us all yes he was oppressed
[1:25:29] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[1:25:31] his mouth he has brought as a lamb to
[1:25:32] the slaughter as a sheep before her
[1:25:34] shears is dumb so he openeth not his
[1:25:37] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[1:25:39] judgment who shall declare his
[1:25:41] generation he was cut off out of the
[1:25:42] land of the living for the transgression
[1:25:44] of my people was he stricken he made his
[1:25:46] grave with the Wicked with the rich in
[1:25:47] his death because he had done no
[1:25:49] violence neither was any deceit in his
[1:25:51] mouth
[1:25:55] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:25:58] him he have put him to grief when thou
[1:26:02] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[1:26:04] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[1:26:06] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[1:26:08] shall prosper in his hands so he's going
[1:26:09] to be a prosperous servant because he's
[1:26:13] willing to do what his master requires
[1:26:16] him to do he shall see the travail of
[1:26:18] his soul and shall be satisfied by his
[1:26:21] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:26:23] justify many for he shall bear their
[1:26:27] iniquities therefore will I divide him a
[1:26:29] portion with the great he shall divide
[1:26:32] the spoil with the strong because Heath
[1:26:34] poured out his soul unto death he was
[1:26:36] numbered with the transgressors he bear
[1:26:38] the sin of many and made intercession
[1:26:41] for the transgressors he was Jehovah's
[1:26:44] trusted
[1:26:45] servant his
[1:26:47] Steward now watch Jesus becomes the
[1:26:51] servant of God to dispense healing and
[1:26:53] salvation to us but he's more than a
[1:26:55] servant he's a son he's the son of God
[1:26:58] how many you believe that today he's the
[1:27:01] son of God so he's the servant son
[1:27:03] Hebrews 3:1 wherefore holy Brethren
[1:27:05] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:27:06] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[1:27:08] our profession Christ Jesus who is
[1:27:10] faithful I mean someone say faithful he
[1:27:13] was faithful to him that appointed him
[1:27:15] as also Moses was faithful in all his
[1:27:18] house and that's why I could say this
[1:27:20] morning and you could raise your hands
[1:27:21] with me and say all my life He's been
[1:27:23] Faithful all my life he's been so good
[1:27:26] why the Bible says he was faithful yes
[1:27:29] and he this man he said was counted
[1:27:30] worthy of more Glory than Moses in as
[1:27:33] much as Heath builded the house with
[1:27:35] more honor than the house so he's not
[1:27:37] just a servant like Moses was but he's
[1:27:39] also the son he said for every house is
[1:27:42] build by some man but he that built all
[1:27:43] things is God and Moses fairily was
[1:27:46] faithful in all his house as a servant
[1:27:48] for a testimony of those things which
[1:27:50] were to be spoken after but but Christ
[1:27:52] as a son over his own house so the son
[1:27:56] became a servant all right oh this
[1:27:58] morning you might say well brother Ben
[1:28:00] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[1:28:02] but it's time that the sons and
[1:28:03] daughters become took on the form of
[1:28:06] servants what what for what purpose to
[1:28:09] dispense
[1:28:12] salvation are you with me so
[1:28:14] far Christ is a son over his own house
[1:28:17] whose house are we If We Hold Fast the
[1:28:19] confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope
[1:28:21] firm until the end
[1:28:22] the Bible tells us we are called to be
[1:28:24] stewards of God's house 1 Corinthians
[1:28:25] 4:1 let a man so account of us as of the
[1:28:29] Ministers of Christ and stewards of the
[1:28:32] mysteries of God all right oh God he
[1:28:35] said moreover it is required in stewards
[1:28:38] that a man be found
[1:28:40] faithful you said but brother Ben that's
[1:28:42] for a preacher yes it is but it's also
[1:28:44] for the
[1:28:45] congregation because the Bible tells us
[1:28:47] in 1 Peter 4:10 he said as every man
[1:28:50] someone say every man every every man
[1:28:53] hath received the
[1:28:54] gift he said but brother Ben I never got
[1:28:57] anything you received the gift you may
[1:28:59] not speak with tongues but you have the
[1:29:01] gift yeah you may not you may not run
[1:29:04] the house but you have the gift and you
[1:29:06] may have all kinds of gifts in your life
[1:29:08] but you have the gift I know you have
[1:29:09] the gift if you're a Christian he said
[1:29:12] even so Minister the same one to another
[1:29:16] as good stewards yes of the manifold
[1:29:19] grace of God yeah so if he being God's
[1:29:22] servant was willing to suffer to to
[1:29:24] dispense salvation to the world oh God
[1:29:26] if you just see what I'm saying this
[1:29:28] morning couldn't we as a servants and
[1:29:30] Sons and Daughters who were servants
[1:29:31] over God's house if we could only learn
[1:29:34] to be suffering servants yeah faithful
[1:29:37] stewards of life and we have something
[1:29:40] precious I wonder if we realize that
[1:29:42] this
[1:29:43] morning I just be a few more minutes and
[1:29:45] we'll close but I wonder if we realize
[1:29:47] how precious the message of the hour is
[1:29:50] all right
[1:29:53] not very many people hold it all right
[1:29:55] few are still care about it yeah you
[1:29:58] realize how precious it
[1:30:00] is you realize how precious the gift of
[1:30:03] Salvation is the the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost and that was a gift to you that
[1:30:09] come in your life and changed you
[1:30:10] brother JT and just just made you
[1:30:12] different you realize how precious that
[1:30:15] is oh it's so precious you look at the
[1:30:18] world and you think I would be just like
[1:30:20] them there's nothing better in me than
[1:30:22] there is in the world I would be just
[1:30:24] like the world I recognize the weakness
[1:30:26] of my own flesh I recognize what I could
[1:30:29] be and what I could do but the gift of
[1:30:31] God has come to me and it's a precious
[1:30:33] thing yeah it's the most valuable thing
[1:30:36] there is in the world we hold in our
[1:30:38] hands eternal life yes think about that
[1:30:42] for a minute
[1:30:47] yeah you know you if you're a
[1:30:50] nurse the reason why it's such in demand
[1:30:52] there such a demand for nurse nursing
[1:30:55] for those positions is because it's the
[1:30:56] key to
[1:30:57] life at least to a better life maybe a
[1:31:01] little bit longer
[1:31:02] life a nurse or a doctor even brother
[1:31:06] alen with the gym it's a key to a better
[1:31:08] life that's what you're selling people
[1:31:10] you're not selling people
[1:31:12] exercise you're selling people a better
[1:31:15] life right that's what they're doing
[1:31:17] they're looking for life but that's not
[1:31:19] the kind of life we have this morning
[1:31:22] and that's a wonderful thing to have
[1:31:23] there's nothing against that if I could
[1:31:25] be a doctor my kids could be doctors I'd
[1:31:26] want them to be I want them to do that
[1:31:29] I'd want them to give Natural Life to
[1:31:31] people you think whatever way that you
[1:31:33] can do that make people's lives better
[1:31:35] go do it sir but when it comes oh my
[1:31:38] when it comes to what we have it's not
[1:31:40] natural life it's eternal life and
[1:31:44] within me is the knowledge and the
[1:31:46] ability to dispense to some other person
[1:31:49] who doesn't have it that's right amen
[1:31:52] on now yeah I think about it yes
[1:31:57] sir he was just one
[1:32:00] man the perfect
[1:32:02] man he gave his life brother the Joel I
[1:32:05] think you shared this the other day he
[1:32:07] made an example for you now what must we
[1:32:09] do all right he said the first thing I
[1:32:12] want to say is Jesus never lived for
[1:32:13] himself yes his life was spent for
[1:32:16] others that's perfectly eternal life
[1:32:20] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:32:21] things that's fine but when you live
[1:32:23] your life to yourself you hav an eternal
[1:32:26] life eternal life is living for others
[1:32:29] he said it proved it when it come in the
[1:32:30] Lamb of God he lived and had eternal
[1:32:32] life because he did not live for himself
[1:32:35] he lived for others and you receive
[1:32:36] eternal life by receiving that day how
[1:32:39] many you received that day I believe
[1:32:41] that Jesus died for me I know that I've
[1:32:43] been forgiven if you know you've been
[1:32:45] forgiven today then you can give that
[1:32:47] out to others amen he Liv for others and
[1:32:49] you receive eternal life by receiving
[1:32:51] that that day and you don't live for
[1:32:53] yourself no more you live for others yes
[1:32:56] Jesus did not do these things because he
[1:32:58] had to he did them because that's who he
[1:33:00] was it was just inside him brother so we
[1:33:02] don't he makes a point in the sermon
[1:33:04] that day on Calvary to tell us that we
[1:33:05] don't do these things cuz we're forced
[1:33:07] to right we don't do these things
[1:33:08] because we think well I need to do it
[1:33:10] you do it because there's something
[1:33:11] inside of you that becomes a suffering
[1:33:14] servant why because that's what he
[1:33:16] was you have his spirit in you that's
[1:33:19] good he said forgive me my Pentecostal
[1:33:22] friend I'm I am Pentecostal my
[1:33:24] Pentecostal friend's got to a spot where
[1:33:26] it has to be a lot of fast music beating
[1:33:27] with some bands clapping hands or tamb
[1:33:29] brings to bring up a shout yeah he said
[1:33:32] that's only emotion they play in bands
[1:33:34] before they go to battle they get people
[1:33:36] in the emotion of battle he said I
[1:33:37] believe in music he's not saying it's
[1:33:39] wrong he said I believe in it yeah I
[1:33:42] believe in clapping hands I believe in
[1:33:43] these things he said that's exactly true
[1:33:46] we ought to have that yeah but you've
[1:33:48] left the great things undone yeah what's
[1:33:50] the great thing that self-sacrificed
[1:33:52] life that God lives in you automatically
[1:33:56] doing that which is right because it's
[1:33:59] right
[1:34:01] that's not going to church because
[1:34:03] you're afraid somebody will will miss
[1:34:05] you and say well you know they'll start
[1:34:06] talking about me but you go because it's
[1:34:08] right that's right amen not not not
[1:34:12] living in a way that would be recognize
[1:34:14] the needs of others and helping others
[1:34:16] because you feel like somebody wants is
[1:34:17] going to make you do it but because it's
[1:34:19] right yeah
[1:34:22] oh my just living it he said just going
[1:34:26] on don't even think nothing about it
[1:34:27] just living it see the Bible tells
[1:34:30] us he that believeth on me the works
[1:34:33] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:34:37] Works so if he if one aspect of the
[1:34:40] works of what he was was a suffering
[1:34:42] servant then the church is going to do
[1:34:44] Greater Works than he did now look we
[1:34:48] know one aspect of that is more there's
[1:34:50] more of us but look what brother brand
[1:34:51] says about it here he said notice the
[1:34:53] Greater Works was to have the power in
[1:34:55] the church not only to heal the Sick by
[1:34:58] prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to
[1:35:00] impart eternal life to Believers the
[1:35:03] Holy Ghost was coming and given into the
[1:35:05] hands of the
[1:35:06] church to impart life sir oh he said
[1:35:10] that's what Calvary meant it took sto
[1:35:12] degraded men and women and lifted them
[1:35:14] into a place to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:16] God to heal the sick to impart life
[1:35:20] eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to
[1:35:22] obedient Believers men who were once
[1:35:24] unbelievers be made Believers and impart
[1:35:27] spiritual eternal life oh my yes he said
[1:35:29] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:35:31] miss that don't you see what the greater
[1:35:33] thing is that's the greatest thing could
[1:35:35] ever happen was to impart eternal life
[1:35:37] to people what is eternal life the life
[1:35:39] that he lived the life that was in him
[1:35:41] impart that to others can a man do that
[1:35:44] a Son of God can remember he was the
[1:35:47] servant son and we are servant Sons and
[1:35:49] Daughters can a man impart eternal life
[1:35:52] a Son of God can oh God let me be a
[1:35:54] conduit of life let me be an encourager
[1:35:57] of life let me be a speaker one who
[1:35:59] speaks life one who speaks a word in
[1:36:02] season to those that are weary a word in
[1:36:05] season you say how do you impart life
[1:36:07] brother BR tells us that they imparted
[1:36:08] Life by preaching the word we impart
[1:36:11] life by speaking the word you impart
[1:36:13] life to your children by telling them
[1:36:15] about the word speak the word
[1:36:19] yes yes sir preach the gospel and then
[1:36:22] go live it yes amen yes
[1:36:25] yes preaching and if necessary use words
[1:36:29] that's
[1:36:31] right to do that you got to be willing
[1:36:33] to suffer that's
[1:36:36] right but God is faithful yes the Bible
[1:36:39] says after you've suffered for a while
[1:36:42] I'm going to speak to the young people
[1:36:43] tonight but I I want to tell you this
[1:36:47] getting old is no
[1:36:49] joke and I can only speak of that about
[1:36:52] halfway you
[1:36:53] know brother Joel told me the other day
[1:36:56] he said uh he woke up one day and
[1:36:58] realized he was
[1:37:04] middle-aged but my daughter told me said
[1:37:07] Joel I said she was after me to do
[1:37:09] something she's always after me to do
[1:37:10] something Esther for the young people
[1:37:12] and I said you know so you should ask
[1:37:14] your youth leader ask brother
[1:37:18] Joel I just thrown it off on him and she
[1:37:21] said well he thinks he's one of
[1:37:26] us if you want to do something for
[1:37:29] God he woke up and realize he was
[1:37:33] middleaged you don't have only so long
[1:37:35] on the earth that's
[1:37:37] right and you've been given the greatest
[1:37:39] gift that could possibly be given what
[1:37:42] are we going to do with
[1:37:44] that what are we going to do with that
[1:37:46] we going to spend all our time promoting
[1:37:47] ourselves come on now looking out for
[1:37:49] what's good for us all right
[1:37:51] well I want to be that because I'll gain
[1:37:52] more recognition in the church but what
[1:37:54] would be best for the
[1:37:56] church I I want to I want to serve in
[1:37:59] that way because that would be good and
[1:38:00] I'm speaking to you because I know at
[1:38:01] the first of the year we start to think
[1:38:03] about these things and our deacons and
[1:38:05] trustees and things like that and how
[1:38:08] how can I serve God's people we can
[1:38:09] dispense eternal life by being
[1:38:11] Christians yeah yes sir by loving people
[1:38:15] by caring for people and sometimes that
[1:38:17] means just giving a word of
[1:38:18] encouragement in due season I'm so
[1:38:20] thankful that God called me in here to
[1:38:22] back me up I don't always have to be in
[1:38:24] the Pulpit but when the man of God gets
[1:38:26] up and preaches what's he doing he's
[1:38:27] giving a word to somebody that's
[1:38:29] weary I was sitting there on Sunday
[1:38:31] morning sitting in the house too sick to
[1:38:33] go out and do anything so we watch the
[1:38:35] service we stream the service and we
[1:38:37] were sitting there in the house and
[1:38:39] we're watching the service on Sunday
[1:38:40] morning and as we're watching the
[1:38:41] service I begin to feel better because I
[1:38:43] begin to be encouraged by what brother
[1:38:45] George was standing here and doing and
[1:38:46] what he was saying I thought you know
[1:38:48] what if I was there preaching I couldn't
[1:38:49] have said it any better I couldn't have
[1:38:51] said it in a in a better way I just
[1:38:53] believe God called him to do that at
[1:38:54] that specific moment and God called
[1:38:56] brother Stewart to say what he said and
[1:38:58] God called brother Joel to say what he
[1:38:59] said what is it we're dispensing eternal
[1:39:01] life let's take it seriously let's love
[1:39:04] one another with everything that we've
[1:39:05] got let's let's give it all of our
[1:39:08] effort when we come to the house of God
[1:39:09] we ought to let our attitude be right we
[1:39:11] ought to pray through before we come we
[1:39:13] ought to be ready to worship where the
[1:39:14] preacher or the song leader doesn't have
[1:39:16] to pump us up but we're ready to worship
[1:39:18] when we come in the house of God why
[1:39:20] because we're a Serv of God said my
[1:39:23] brother Ben I suffer yes we're suffering
[1:39:25] servants
[1:39:26] yes and my point was as you grow to be
[1:39:29] older you'll realize life is
[1:39:32] suffering it's just what it is you just
[1:39:35] go from one suffering to another you say
[1:39:36] well that's
[1:39:39] depressing but Paul put it this way he
[1:39:42] said he said if we only have hope in
[1:39:44] this life we're of all men most
[1:39:46] miserable all
[1:39:50] right
[1:39:51] you don't get very long here sir I think
[1:39:55] brother Wes you probably realize that
[1:39:56] better than most of us do this
[1:40:00] week life is a vapor and it appears for
[1:40:02] a little while and then it just yeah
[1:40:05] you're
[1:40:06] gone what are you going to do with
[1:40:09] it I made a commitment in my
[1:40:11] life some musicians want to go ahead and
[1:40:14] come I kind of run out of steam this
[1:40:16] morning but I appreciate your
[1:40:19] prayers
[1:40:22] made a commitment in my life because
[1:40:24] I've stood and preached to people and
[1:40:26] prayed for people who come to be prayed
[1:40:28] for and they never come to another
[1:40:32] service I preached to a lady I'll never
[1:40:34] forget it she's sitting back at the back
[1:40:36] of the church on the right side I never
[1:40:39] forget her face she'd come to church off
[1:40:42] and on had some problems in her
[1:40:44] marriage she come to church that morning
[1:40:46] I preached she come to be prayed for I
[1:40:47] prayed with
[1:40:48] her the next day I got a phone call her
[1:40:52] and her husband got in a fight he picked
[1:40:54] up a gun shot her in the face she never
[1:40:56] went to another service he said well
[1:40:58] that couldn't happen it's just the world
[1:41:00] we live in amen people are broken right
[1:41:04] he told us he said I didn't know why I
[1:41:06] did
[1:41:07] it I didn't want to do it said I love my
[1:41:10] wife he said I just got so
[1:41:13] angry let's just let's let's be eternal
[1:41:16] life amen there may be people here this
[1:41:19] morning that'll never be in another
[1:41:20] church service let's be eternal life to
[1:41:22] them amen Lord if my action toward this
[1:41:24] person if Me Maybe Just lingering for a
[1:41:26] little bit at the end of the service and
[1:41:28] praying and worshipping if I could just
[1:41:29] put a little bit of effort I know that
[1:41:31] we're not saved by effort we're saved by
[1:41:33] the grace of God do you believe that but
[1:41:36] his grace is so real to me that I want
[1:41:38] to give every effort I can give to the
[1:41:40] kingdom of God yes and if just letting
[1:41:43] the atmosphere be right whether it's me
[1:41:45] being louder or me being quieter or or
[1:41:48] me being up the star me not being the
[1:41:50] star or just sitting in prayer and
[1:41:52] praying for somebody taking somebody by
[1:41:53] the hand and reaching out to somebody
[1:41:55] and being Christ to that person let me
[1:41:58] be that
[1:41:59] Lord amen good brother random talks
[1:42:02] about a
[1:42:03] dove that
[1:42:05] was in the first world war he said there
[1:42:07] was a group of soldiers pinned down and
[1:42:10] the mustard gas was out and things and
[1:42:12] they knew they were going to be
[1:42:13] destroyed in just a little bit longer
[1:42:15] and the main body soldiers didn't know
[1:42:16] where they were and so they had to get a
[1:42:18] message out hey we're surrounded we need
[1:42:20] help
[1:42:21] and so he said they sent A A pigeon Dove
[1:42:23] then they sent it out with a message on
[1:42:25] its leg he said while it was flying the
[1:42:28] leg got broke he said it got holes in
[1:42:31] the wings it was bloody and bleeding he
[1:42:33] said it finally just had barely had the
[1:42:35] strength to fall into the camp and when
[1:42:38] it fell into the camp the people got the
[1:42:40] message and the ones that were that were
[1:42:43] that were bound down that were kept down
[1:42:44] under enemy fire were saved why because
[1:42:47] a dove had enough oh my had enough about
[1:42:51] him he was faithful to what he' been
[1:42:53] called to do what he'd been trained to
[1:42:55] do and he fell into the camp he said and
[1:42:57] the great Dove was Jesus Christ when
[1:42:59] Satan shot everything he get chewed at
[1:43:01] him and he fell into the camp a wounded
[1:43:04] dub but he fell into the camp Oh that we
[1:43:06] would be have that same spirit in us
[1:43:08] that we may have to fall into the camp
[1:43:10] we may be wounded but we're willing to
[1:43:12] be wounded we might be we might be
[1:43:14] beaten but we're willing to be beaten we
[1:43:16] might get talked about but we're willing
[1:43:17] to be talked about just to deliver the
[1:43:21] message cuz the world needs
[1:43:24] it you know that girls the world needs
[1:43:26] what you've got yeah they need it yes
[1:43:30] everybody you meet needs it let's be
[1:43:32] life to them you bow your heads with
[1:43:45] me I don't want us to ever take a
[1:43:48] service for
[1:43:49] granted
[1:43:51] if there's something we can do better we
[1:43:52] want to do it better I don't want us to
[1:43:55] ever take
[1:43:56] a a day for granted we don't know who we
[1:43:58] might be
[1:44:01] impacting you don't know in your life
[1:44:03] who you might impact but the miles
[1:44:06] sitting back there and the miles seems
[1:44:08] like he's almost in church by
[1:44:11] accident but God called him here for a
[1:44:15] reason and I see brother the miles
[1:44:17] impacted by the
[1:44:19] word see his face touched by the word
[1:44:23] say God May a word in season to one that

[1:44:45] it and believe that what I planted in
[1:44:48] seed form will Sprout one day
