[43:21] let's just keep them right here with us
[43:22] and just just be a a Powerhouse for God
[43:26] it's what we want to speak on this
[43:27] morning Isaiah 661 thus sayith the Lord
[43:31] the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my
[43:34] foot
[43:35] stol where is the house that you build
[43:38] unto me where is the place of my rest
[43:42] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[43:44] the word you may be seated this
[43:49] morning we're building something I think
[43:52] we could all agree that that even here
[43:54] at the church we're building something
[43:56] you're building something in your family
[43:58] I would say that all of us build every
[44:00] day in our words and our thought in our
[44:02] actions we're building you're you're
[44:05] either building or tearing down by
[44:07] everything that you say everything that
[44:08] you do and we want to be Builders we
[44:11] want to be edifiers we want to be
[44:13] encouragers not uh not destroyers if if
[44:17] your whole life is built around
[44:19] destroying something you'll find out
[44:21] that it was fruitless in the end there's
[44:23] no fruit of that there's no building of
[44:25] that you can we we can spend our lives
[44:28] trying to tear down another church or
[44:30] tear down another denomination or tear
[44:33] down something else but that's not what
[44:35] we're called to do we're called to build
[44:37] something and we do that our words build
[44:39] something you'll find that you can build
[44:42] peace in your home by the words that you
[44:44] speak in your home you can build uh you
[44:46] can build uh a unity in the church by
[44:49] the things you say one to another or you
[44:51] can you can tear down you can uh you can
[44:53] take Unity away doing the same thing
[44:56] right and and so we we want as again as
[44:59] we're in a season of Revival and growth
[45:02] we want to make sure that what we're
[45:03] building is something that lasts
[45:06] something that's built on a foundation
[45:08] that's sure and and we want to make sure
[45:10] that uh we don't judge the results based
[45:13] on a moment a moment in time but that we
[45:15] look at the big picture and we begin to
[45:17] look and see what God's doing and begin
[45:20] to see there's something here that'll
[45:21] last there something that is not
[45:23] dependent on a pasture something that's
[45:26] not dependent on uh who stands behind
[45:28] the pulpit something that's not
[45:29] dependent on who sits in the pews but
[45:32] something that is a move of God that's
[45:34] building the lives of people yes sir so
[45:37] what are we building today and I would
[45:40] challenge you with that what are you
[45:41] building as an individual because all of
[45:43] us are Builders and all of us are being
[45:46] built yeah right so Paul writes in in
[45:50] the book of Corinthians now we know that
[45:52] there's two churches in the New
[45:54] Testament that stand as kind of Polar
[45:56] Opposites and that's the Corinthians and
[45:58] the Ephesians and and we've went through
[46:00] that how that the Ephesians is what
[46:03] we're aspiring to that that's what we
[46:05] are we are not a Corinthian Church
[46:08] brother randam never told us that there
[46:09] would be another Corinthians that there
[46:11] would be another group of squabbling
[46:14] fighting backbiting bunch of people that
[46:17] couldn't get the gifts right and
[46:18] couldn't get anything right but there's
[46:19] going to be another Ephesians he said at
[46:21] the end time that's what we are is
[46:24] another Ephesians that's what we're
[46:25] called to because that's the the Joshua
[46:28] generation if we can say it that way the
[46:30] the age of of entering in going in
[46:33] that's the Ephesians being settled this
[46:35] is a an adoption message this is a
[46:38] message not of a a fly by night or or an
[46:40] overnight Revival or a cycle of Revival
[46:43] and death but this is a message that
[46:45] stops the cycle this is a message that
[46:47] means you don't have to be in today and
[46:49] out tomorrow and up today and down
[46:51] tomorrow but this is a message that
[46:53] brings you into the presence of the holy
[46:55] of H H brings you under the presence of
[46:57] the word so you can live for God on
[47:00] Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and
[47:02] Thursday and Friday listen kids you
[47:03] don't have to have just experience after
[47:05] experience that's wonderful to have an
[47:07] experience but one day you need to reach
[47:09] a place where you you just keep growing
[47:11] you just keep going up you don't have to
[47:13] go down you don't have to you don't have
[47:15] to get worse you can get
[47:17] better remember brother randam told us
[47:19] that you can you get better or worse in
[47:21] every service yeah right every time you
[47:24] come to the house of God and here the
[47:25] word of God you'll leave either better
[47:27] or worse I tell you what I I do not
[47:29] believe that we have to leave worse we
[47:31] can leave better we can leave better
[47:34] every single time we come to the house
[47:35] of God we can keep going up because this
[47:38] is an age not an age of failure this is
[47:40] not an age of defeat this is an age of
[47:43] going up come
[47:45] on and if people preach a message of
[47:48] defeat what it means is they're living
[47:50] in a l to see and Age
[47:53] come all of us are affected by able to
[47:56] see it but that's not us we're the
[47:58] Overcomers of that age yes sir we're not
[48:01] defeated
[48:04] right so now are you with me so
[48:08] far I want something that lasts don't
[48:10] you that's something that'll keep me
[48:13] yeah I don't always feel like worshiping
[48:16] God I don't always feel like preaching I
[48:18] didn't feel like much like preaching
[48:19] this morning until I got out here and
[48:20] saw your faces and saw how wonderful the
[48:23] the audience looked this morning you
[48:25] just look so so so happy to be here and
[48:27] and I'm so excited by that that it just
[48:29] all your I'm tired man I I I've been
[48:32] through a lot this week and and not felt
[48:34] really well in my body and we've been
[48:36] supporting the meetings and then going
[48:37] and preaching and traveling and doing
[48:39] those things but I'm here to tell you
[48:41] this morning that my my praise to God is
[48:43] not dependent on how I feel my my my
[48:45] preaching even is not dependent on how I
[48:47] feel but God is inside of me he wants to
[48:50] express something through me he's inside
[48:52] of you he wants to express something
[48:55] through you
[48:57] yes it's more than just a how a preacher
[49:00] feels how I feel should not dictate the
[49:03] service how it goes how you feel come on
[49:06] church should not dictate how you
[49:08] receive but there ought to be something
[49:10] more than that something real you can
[49:13] get a hold
[49:14] of you're going to feel bad sometimes
[49:17] cuz we live in a body of Flesh a prison
[49:19] House of uh this flesh is never get
[49:22] saved I I've said that before two-thirds
[49:24] of you never get saved but the soul is
[49:26] saved and so the soul has the ability to
[49:28] overpower the the body and the spirit
[49:31] I'm so glad for that today thank you
[49:33] Lord amen amen what are we building Paul
[49:38] writes to a Corinthian Church it seemed
[49:39] to be building a
[49:41] Powerhouse people coming in constantly
[49:43] miracles signs and wonders but but
[49:46] really what they were building was Babel
[49:48] yeah they weren't they were not building
[49:50] well because they were building faction
[49:53] and I'll say this this morning you can't
[49:55] build on
[49:58] complexes you can't build on Faction and
[50:00] remember what you say I have to be very
[50:02] careful what I say behind the pulpit
[50:04] because what my words build or they tear
[50:07] down and so I can't build on complexes I
[50:10] can't build on Faction I can't build on
[50:12] unbelief I can't build on uh everybody's
[50:15] going to hell and we we might as well go
[50:16] with them I can't build on that kind of
[50:18] an attitude I got to build on the word
[50:20] preach the word is everybody if is
[50:23] everybody happy preach the word is
[50:24] everybody sad preach the
[50:26] word is the church is a church in a
[50:29] valley preach the word preach them out
[50:31] of the valley is a church on a mountain
[50:33] preach the word that'll make the
[50:34] mountain top
[50:37] last preach the word he said that's the
[50:40] only way that's the only way to set
[50:42] things right yeah but the Corinthians
[50:45] got a place in 1 Corinthians 3:4 they
[50:47] said while one sayith I'm a Paul and
[50:49] another I'm of Apollos are you not
[50:51] carnal who then is Paul and who is
[50:53] apollis but ministers by whom whom you
[50:55] believed even as the lord gave to every
[50:57] man I think God help us today to
[51:01] recognize just because it's our favorite
[51:03] preacher doesn't mean they're the only
[51:04] ones we need to hear yeah I've told you
[51:07] before I think I told you a couple weeks
[51:09] ago we we do I do not want you to just
[51:11] hear me because if you only hear me
[51:14] you're only getting one part of the
[51:15] fivefold ministry I believe you need a
[51:17] pastor or I wouldn't be here I wouldn't
[51:19] be doing what I'm doing but I believe
[51:21] that you've got to hear from other parts
[51:23] of the ministry as well
[51:26] right he said I planted a poish water
[51:28] but God gave the
[51:30] increase so then neither is he that
[51:32] planteth
[51:33] anything neither he that WTH but God
[51:37] that giveth the increase I want to
[51:39] propose to you today that the age of
[51:41] denomination is over yeah the age of
[51:43] building on a man's capabilities or a
[51:46] man's Ministry is over the age of
[51:48] building around a pastor that controls
[51:50] people by force and says what meetings
[51:53] they can go to and what services they
[51:54] can go to to and what church they can go
[51:56] to that age is
[51:59] over we're we're a bride that cannot be
[52:02] deceived we're a bride we're people that
[52:04] are being built up we we're not I'm not
[52:06] here to tell you where you can go and
[52:07] where you can't go what car you can buy
[52:09] and what you can do I'm here to preach
[52:11] the word and you're here to receive the
[52:15] word I have planted a poish water but
[52:19] God gave the
[52:22] increase and he that planteth and he
[52:24] that WTH are one
[52:26] you ever think about it like that so the
[52:29] the face behind the pulpit is
[52:33] interchangeable doesn't feel like it
[52:35] sometimes does it but it's God
[52:38] expressing another side yes right so if
[52:41] I preached this morning brother Joel or
[52:43] brother Stuart or somebody else would
[52:44] preach this afternoon no matter who it
[52:46] is it's that diamond that that that
[52:48] there's been uh it's like that Crystal
[52:50] where the random talked about that the
[52:51] Rays off of it it catches a littleit
[52:53] different side of it and it and it
[52:55] expresses something of God it expresses
[52:58] something of deity so if I'm up here
[53:00] this morning and express a certain side
[53:02] of it brother jeles up here this
[53:03] afternoon expresses another side of it
[53:05] what are we doing what are we doing
[53:07] we're actually both it's both God
[53:10] expressing if we're doing it right it's
[53:13] God expressing himself to his people we
[53:16] are laborers
[53:18] together with God you are God's
[53:21] husbandry I love the way he puts this
[53:23] you are God's husbandry you are God's
[53:27] Building so if we're building something
[53:30] today you are God's
[53:32] Building according to the grace of God
[53:34] he said which is given unto me as a wise
[53:37] master builder yeah I have laid the
[53:40] foundation and another buth there on so
[53:43] every one of us brother Joel we we we
[53:46] build on the foundation that Paul laid
[53:48] Yeah amen right and we can build
[53:51] whichever way we want to yeah right but
[53:54] and still say well we're pre preaching
[53:56] what Paul preached but I'll say this
[53:59] does the results that we're getting and
[54:02] the the time that we're living in the
[54:04] season that we're living in reflect that
[54:07] because what happened with brother
[54:09] brandom is he was Vindicated to be one
[54:11] who preached what Paul preached because
[54:14] his message matched the season and
[54:16] matched the time and match was
[54:18] appropriate for the day and it's
[54:20] appropriate for today so any of us can
[54:23] say well I preach what Paul preached
[54:25] everybody says it the Baptist say it the
[54:27] Methodist say it the Pentecostal say it
[54:28] everybody says that and that's fine they
[54:30] each one can has a right to look at it
[54:32] and see what they see but I I what we're
[54:35] doing is taking the message of the hour
[54:37] and we're looking at and saying there's
[54:38] something here that's in the scripture
[54:40] that's applicable to our day light has
[54:42] come in our day that that brings us that
[54:45] we can build clearly on the foundation
[54:47] we're not worried about uh about well I
[54:49] can't really see what Paul said I can't
[54:51] understand it but we're actually able to
[54:53] build on Paul's Foundation because of
[54:55] the message of the hour are you with me
[54:57] so
[54:58] far now he said other Foundation can no
[55:01] man lay than that is laid which is Jesus
[55:05] Christ aren't you glad for that today he
[55:09] is the
[55:10] foundation we're going to get to that a
[55:12] little bit more in a moment so we're not
[55:14] building an
[55:15] organization I'm not here this morning
[55:18] to build an
[55:19] organization Christ never sent me to
[55:21] build an organization Christ sent me to
[55:24] build individuals
[55:25] yes right so we're not building a church
[55:28] and that may run counter to what people
[55:30] do today where it's all about numbers
[55:33] but we're not building churches we're
[55:35] not building groups of Fellowship right
[55:37] we're not building denomination we're
[55:40] building
[55:41] individuals and and that's why it
[55:43] bothers me so much when I go plac it
[55:45] seems like well they're all concerned
[55:47] about keeping the group together and
[55:49] doing this and doing that that's not my
[55:51] concern my concern is to build
[55:53] individuals and if I can help build
[55:55] individual no matter where they are no
[55:56] matter what's going on in their life I
[55:58] want to help I want to put my shoulder
[55:59] to the wheel I don't want to destroy an
[56:01] individual because I disagree with the
[56:03] system they're
[56:06] in right so Christ sent me to build
[56:10] individuals so my job as a pastor is to
[56:13] preach in such a way that the word would
[56:16] go out and the word is a living thing oh
[56:20] see when you're born again brother bar
[56:21] talked about being born he said a cell
[56:23] replicates itself
[56:25] right when when you were born in human
[56:27] birth when you were conceived there was
[56:29] one one little cell one little germ but
[56:31] then it it multiplied itself and it
[56:34] didn't build a cat or a dog or something
[56:36] else it built a human being right
[56:38] because that's what it was and so it
[56:40] just kept building and kept building
[56:42] until you until you become a human being
[56:43] and it didn't stop there it kept
[56:45] building and kept building until you
[56:46] become a full stature of a human being
[56:48] you become you were the building uh but
[56:50] it was all contained in that little seed
[56:52] so every word that I preach is a seed
[56:54] everything thing that that comes across
[56:56] this Pulpit every time you hear the
[56:57] tapes every time you read a book every
[56:59] time you open your Bible it's a seed
[57:01] yeah right right there's a seed there
[57:05] and the seed said I know the thoughts
[57:06] that I think towards you thoughts of
[57:09] peace and not of evil that's the thought
[57:10] of God it's a seed of God it comes down
[57:13] in your heart and it begins to replicate
[57:15] itself right it begins to
[57:17] build well I am a child of God see we
[57:21] can build confidence or we can build we
[57:22] can destroy yes confidence
[57:25] we can build we can build people who
[57:27] know where they stand we can destroy and
[57:30] not people not know where they stand
[57:32] never know if they're saved or not yeah
[57:34] right by our words by what we say so
[57:38] Christ he said sent me to build
[57:40] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[57:42] Christ that they might be someone say
[57:46] they they they might be the
[57:49] PowerHouse we're not building a
[57:51] Powerhouse church I hope you hear me
[57:54] today we're building a Powerhouse
[57:57] individual that's my interest this
[57:59] morning not in building a great church
[58:01] not in building although I believe we
[58:03] have a great church and I'm glad that
[58:04] you're sitting here it's much more
[58:06] inspiring to preach to people than to
[58:07] preach to
[58:08] pews right I I enjoy that but we're not
[58:11] building a Powerhouse we're not building
[58:13] a a building that that that the world
[58:15] could look at and say there's a powerful
[58:17] Church what we're building what we're
[58:19] building as individuals and if you have
[58:21] individuals that are built in the full
[58:22] stature of God you'll have a power
[58:25] Church you'll have power in the church
[58:26] you'll have strength in the church
[58:28] you'll have abilities in the church
[58:29] you'll have talent gifts in the church
[58:31] if you build the
[58:33] individual right so every one of us have
[58:37] to build yeah right right because I'm
[58:39] not building by myself right you're
[58:42] building yes now so he said we're
[58:47] building the statute of Jesus Christ
[58:48] they might be the PowerHouse and the
[58:49] dwelling place of the Spirit by his word
[58:52] by his word not by my complexes but
[58:56] David good to see you this morning I
[58:58] think you were supposed to be here not
[59:00] by my complexes not by my
[59:03] abilities not by the good things about
[59:05] me or the bad things about
[59:07] me right not on my
[59:09] personality by his
[59:12] word oh God help us to see it today by
[59:15] his word build up the individual to that
[59:17] place not build an organization to a
[59:20] greater denomination but build the
[59:22] individual to sons and daughters of God
[59:26] we're not building a denomination a
[59:27] program or even a church we're building
[59:30] people that's why when I use a Ministry
[59:32] I want a Ministry that builds I want
[59:35] people that stand in this Pulpit that
[59:36] build I don't care who they associate
[59:39] with and and who they might go to church
[59:41] with or something like that as long as
[59:42] it's something that's sane and and and
[59:44] godly but but I don't that's not what
[59:46] I'm building I'm not building
[59:47] connections with other preachers I'm not
[59:49] I'm not building politics I want to
[59:51] build
[59:52] individuals and so you bring people in
[59:54] that'll help build individuals that'll
[59:56] help build miles to where he needs to be
[59:58] and Peter where he needs to be and
[1:00:00] Finley where he needs to be and every
[1:00:02] one of these girls where they need to
[1:00:05] be we're building
[1:00:08] something I I'll say this I'm kind of
[1:00:10] getting ahead of myself but if you're
[1:00:11] building something you can't just leave
[1:00:13] the material sitting around and go on
[1:00:15] holiday right even if you're on vacation
[1:00:19] You're Building yeah you're building
[1:00:21] your family even if you're even if
[1:00:23] you're at work you're building yeah you
[1:00:25] don't leave the material every day
[1:00:26] you're building every moment You're
[1:00:29] Building God help me to be a a wise
[1:00:36] Builder now
[1:00:40] listen now the church cannot be a
[1:00:44] Powerhouse unless the people are
[1:00:47] powerhouses now Ephesians
[1:00:49] 4:11 tells us that he gave some Apostles
[1:00:52] some prophets some evangelists some
[1:00:53] pastors and teachers teachers for the
[1:00:55] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:00:58] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:01:00] body of Christ that word edify is to
[1:01:03] build it's to build it's the process of
[1:01:06] of building sometimes transitional I
[1:01:08] want you to think about that this
[1:01:10] morning as we're sitting here I don't
[1:01:11] want you to just just let this pass by I
[1:01:13] want you to get it this morning if I
[1:01:16] have to stop and talk I will so that we
[1:01:18] get it this morning I want you to
[1:01:21] understand what what we're talking about
[1:01:23] we're talking about a building yes and
[1:01:25] it's not you don't just sit still it's
[1:01:26] not just you wake up one day and there's
[1:01:28] a building praise God oh I'm a Child of
[1:01:31] God well you are but you're a child of
[1:01:33] God when you first started yeah you were
[1:01:36] a Son of God when the F all there was
[1:01:38] was a foundation of Faith yeah but you
[1:01:40] got to keep building on that Foundation
[1:01:42] of Faith got to keep building so it's
[1:01:44] transitional it's not strictly concrete
[1:01:47] it's Improvement that's what the word
[1:01:49] means edify improvement improvement
[1:01:53] Ephesians 4:13 till till we all come in
[1:01:57] the unity of the faith the knowledge of
[1:01:59] the Son of God unto a perfect man or a
[1:02:02] mature man a full man to the measure of
[1:02:05] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:02:08] had an interest interesting conversation
[1:02:09] with my children this morning brother
[1:02:11] Peter declared to me that he was a
[1:02:16] man sorry
[1:02:20] buddy cuz his voice has changed he's a
[1:02:24] deeper got a deeper voice he's a man
[1:02:26] now he does he got a good voice I wish I
[1:02:29] had that voice I declared to him that a
[1:02:32] man an adult I said there's only kids
[1:02:34] and adults right really and as an adult
[1:02:38] you got to be able to take care of
[1:02:39] yourself come
[1:02:43] on right as an adult you don't live in
[1:02:45] the
[1:02:48] basement as an adult you pay your own
[1:02:51] bills right some of y'all like I'm never
[1:02:53] going to be an adult oh that sounds
[1:02:56] bad but but you got to grow up at some
[1:02:58] point a lot of people never grow up well
[1:03:00] the same thing spiritually yeah other
[1:03:02] people never grow up you got to grow up
[1:03:04] at some point you got to be willing to
[1:03:06] grow up and I'll say this while people
[1:03:08] are growing you got to give them room to
[1:03:09] be 16 give them room to be 14 give them
[1:03:12] room to be 12 they're going to make
[1:03:14] mistakes absolutely they're going to
[1:03:16] stumble while they walk but you don't
[1:03:18] knock them down but the bom said a a
[1:03:19] father with his children he said he's
[1:03:21] not going to beat them because they they
[1:03:23] fall when they walk yeah but he's going
[1:03:25] to grab them by the hand and walk with
[1:03:27] them and help them to be able to walk
[1:03:29] cuz one day they're going to be able to
[1:03:30] run faster than you can run I don't want
[1:03:33] my children to make the same Falls I did
[1:03:35] I want to grab them by the hand and help
[1:03:37] them walk better than I walked I want
[1:03:40] them to not make the mistakes that I've
[1:03:41] made I want them to not have the scars
[1:03:43] that I've had I want them to be able to
[1:03:45] walk with with the word until they go
[1:03:47] home one day because one of these days
[1:03:49] brother monre we're going to walk
[1:03:51] home let me walk with them let me
[1:03:54] encourage them let me let me put
[1:03:55] something in and build something in
[1:03:57] their lives so they can walk home with
[1:04:02] me
[1:04:09] good that we henceforth be no more
[1:04:12] children toss to and fro carried about
[1:04:15] with every wind of Doctrine by the slide
[1:04:17] of men one of the Great Main marks of a
[1:04:21] child is are
[1:04:22] gullible yeah parent parents adults
[1:04:26] mature Christians should not be
[1:04:28] gullible I'll say this you you take what
[1:04:30] I say back to the word you got to got
[1:04:37] to you don't need to be moved by the
[1:04:40] slight of men cunning craftiness whereby
[1:04:42] they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:04:44] speaking the truth in love yeah I love
[1:04:46] that they grow up into him in All Things
[1:04:50] someone say all things which is the head
[1:04:52] even Christ yeah from whom from the head
[1:04:56] the whole body fitly joined together the
[1:04:59] BR said that was that Holy Ghost coming
[1:05:00] from the top of the pyramid remember he
[1:05:02] put the Holy Ghost In Between The
[1:05:04] Headstone and the bottom he said it
[1:05:06] comes in it fills all the cracks yeah
[1:05:08] amen oh that's where I want to live
[1:05:10] that's that's what I want to be the
[1:05:12] whole body fitly joined together
[1:05:14] compacted by that which every joint
[1:05:16] supplieth yeah according to the
[1:05:19] effectual working in the measure of
[1:05:21] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:05:24] unto the edifying or the building of
[1:05:26] itself in love yes so the church then
[1:05:30] this morning is a construction zone yes
[1:05:33] and each one builds according to the
[1:05:35] gifts he has to bring the individual
[1:05:38] from one state to another from one
[1:05:42] condition to another right that that's
[1:05:45] our job I I'm not preaching at you I'm
[1:05:48] not I'm not trying to sometimes I'll say
[1:05:50] something I'm not trying to hurt you
[1:05:52] what I'm trying to do is bring you from
[1:05:54] one place to another yeah I'm I'm trying
[1:05:56] to wake people up where they can come
[1:05:58] from one station to another because we
[1:06:01] can't spend the whole time on the
[1:06:02] foundation we can't spend the whole time
[1:06:04] on the plumbing we can't spend the whole
[1:06:06] time on the
[1:06:07] walls right we got to keep building each
[1:06:10] one of us has to keep
[1:06:11] progressing so each one of us is a
[1:06:14] builder as I said each one of is being
[1:06:17] built now I don't know who the oldest
[1:06:19] person is here this morning I I would
[1:06:22] have you raise your hands but I some of
[1:06:24] our elders aren't here today and sick
[1:06:25] and or gone and and I think maybe sister
[1:06:28] Fritz might be the oldest that we have
[1:06:30] and she's home this morning maybe
[1:06:32] listening to the service praying for you
[1:06:34] this morning sister Fritz she's meant so
[1:06:37] much to us and and to our family and
[1:06:40] I'll say this she's a builder she didn't
[1:06:42] have a family of her own and maybe this
[1:06:44] will teach us something she didn't have
[1:06:46] kids of her own so she built in my
[1:06:49] kids she she she helped my kids she she
[1:06:52] worked in my kids and and helped my in
[1:06:55] my Ministry and in my my family and I'm
[1:06:57] so thankful for that we can do that for
[1:06:59] somebody else you may not be able to
[1:07:01] have everything you want yourself your
[1:07:03] life might be hard but maybe God put you
[1:07:04] in that place so you can build in
[1:07:06] somebody else's life some of you have
[1:07:09] adopted children and I I'm thankful for
[1:07:11] that I I see so many children that are
[1:07:13] broken and hurt and and and out here
[1:07:15] without any parents and you've adopted
[1:07:17] children I watch them grow in the fear
[1:07:18] and admonition of the Lord I say thank
[1:07:20] you for doing that you're building
[1:07:21] you're voluntarily building in some
[1:07:23] somebody's
[1:07:24] life every one of us is a builder and
[1:07:28] each one of us is being built so the
[1:07:31] builders originally were the apostles
[1:07:32] and prophets in Ephesians 21:19 he said
[1:07:35] now therefore you are no more strangers
[1:07:36] and
[1:07:41] foreigners fellow citizens with the
[1:07:43] Saints it's that time of year of the
[1:07:45] household of God and are built upon the
[1:07:48] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:07:52] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:07:54] Cornerstone the apostles and Prophets
[1:07:55] the new and the Old Testament in whom
[1:07:58] all the building fitly framed together
[1:08:01] yeah you can't build by division
[1:08:05] right right you can't build by going to
[1:08:07] the job site and taking materials away
[1:08:09] right you don't build by going to
[1:08:11] somebody else's house and taking their
[1:08:14] materials right trying to undermine what
[1:08:17] they're doing let them build yes you
[1:08:19] build your house brother brand said it
[1:08:22] this way he said you sweep your front
[1:08:23] steps and I'll sweep
[1:08:25] mine God helped me to be that way it's
[1:08:27] so hard though isn't it you see that
[1:08:29] church over there that brother over
[1:08:30] there at the dirty front steps my
[1:08:32] goodness boy I'd like to I'd like to fix
[1:08:35] them got your own problems that's why I
[1:08:38] try to fellowship with everybody that I
[1:08:40] can and without it being just just
[1:08:43] something so false that I can't Point
[1:08:45] people to that but but when it's when
[1:08:47] there's a when there's agreement on the
[1:08:48] atonement and the token and things like
[1:08:50] that we can build on that we can build
[1:08:52] together try to Fellowship ship with you
[1:08:54] because it's not my job to clean up your
[1:08:55] church right we have a hard enough time
[1:08:58] keeping our own
[1:09:00] clean right we got enough of our own
[1:09:02] problems without me having to clean up
[1:09:04] everybody else's right God help me to
[1:09:06] have the humility to remain that way
[1:09:08] because we want to build here yeah we
[1:09:10] want to build here not because this is
[1:09:12] the only place that people can be built
[1:09:14] but because this is what God gave
[1:09:16] us and if God put us here with Harve he
[1:09:19] must have put us here for a reason
[1:09:21] there's a reason why we're here so let's
[1:09:23] build
[1:09:24] yeah I find myself in the building with
[1:09:26] a hammer in my hand some of y'all don't
[1:09:28] use a hammer anymore you use one of them
[1:09:30] one of them nail guns but if I find
[1:09:33] myself with a nail gun in my hand on the
[1:09:35] job site let me
[1:09:37] build not just attempt to destroy what's
[1:09:40] been
[1:09:42] built
[1:09:44] so the Bible says you're building
[1:09:47] together for a habitation of God through
[1:09:48] the spirit parents are Builders yeah uh
[1:09:52] Solomon said in Proverbs 226 train up a
[1:09:55] child in the way he should go build him
[1:09:57] in a certain way and when he's old he'll
[1:09:59] not depart from it right you glad for
[1:10:02] that promise gifts and helps in the body
[1:10:06] are Builders there's people that are
[1:10:07] builders in the church I believe all of
[1:10:09] us are Paul says we then that are strong
[1:10:12] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[1:10:16] weak and not to please
[1:10:20] ourselves oh oh it get sticky here for a
[1:10:23] minute but I'm a pastor I get to do this
[1:10:27] so we we don't we don't build to please
[1:10:30] ourselves in your area of service
[1:10:33] whether it's song leading or or specials
[1:10:35] or music or whatever it is or preaching
[1:10:38] you don't build to please yourself right
[1:10:41] lots of times I'd like to preach a
[1:10:42] certain thing and God says
[1:10:44] no and I have to do what God says
[1:10:48] because I'm not pleasing myself I'm not
[1:10:50] here to please myself what would please
[1:10:53] me is to have a a shack down by the
[1:10:54] river and fish all all week that's what
[1:10:56] would please me but it's not what
[1:10:58] pleases the father and as I become a
[1:11:00] mature Christian I've got to do what
[1:11:02] pleases the father so we find us when
[1:11:05] we're building when we're in a position
[1:11:07] when we're building in the church we
[1:11:08] need to Bear the infirmities of the weak
[1:11:12] not to not to gather together and out
[1:11:14] that person yeah not to form a firing
[1:11:17] squad and try to destroy the person but
[1:11:20] to build up the person do you you have
[1:11:23] somebody in your Sunday school group do
[1:11:25] you have someone in your youth group you
[1:11:26] got somebody in the in among the elders
[1:11:28] that looks like they're weak and and
[1:11:30] they're just not up to where everybody
[1:11:31] else is our job is not to make fun of
[1:11:33] them our job oh God help us today our
[1:11:36] job is not to knock them down our job is
[1:11:38] not to put them out our job is to build
[1:11:40] them up let's
[1:11:48] build we're strong we ought to Bear the
[1:11:50] infirmities of the weak not to please
[1:11:51] ourselves let every one of us
[1:11:54] every one of
[1:11:57] us that includes you I'd say raise your
[1:12:01] hand if you're every one but some people
[1:12:02] never rais their hand in church but you
[1:12:04] are
[1:12:05] one whether you want to raise your hand
[1:12:07] or
[1:12:09] not let every one of us please his
[1:12:13] neighbor yes for his good to
[1:12:17] edification to build him for even Christ
[1:12:21] pleased not himself I'm so glad he
[1:12:25] didn't but as it is written the
[1:12:28] reproaches of them that reproach thee
[1:12:30] fell on me yeah he pleased the father
[1:12:34] Ministry gifts as we went through
[1:12:36] they're to build and mature the church
[1:12:39] all of these are building the individual
[1:12:41] from one stage to another are you with
[1:12:43] me so
[1:12:45] far so we're building well brother Bram
[1:12:47] calls the stature of a perfect man a
[1:12:50] Powerhouse yeah a Powerhouse and in
[1:12:53] individual Powerhouse second Peter 1: 15
[1:12:57] let's go there this morning beside this
[1:12:59] giving all diligence giving diligence
[1:13:01] it's not just going to happen yeah right
[1:13:04] you got to give diligence to it yes add
[1:13:07] to your faith virtue yeah to Virtue
[1:13:10] knowledge to knowledge Temperance to
[1:13:13] Temperance patience to patience
[1:13:15] godliness the godliness brotherly
[1:13:17] kindness brotherly kindness charity for
[1:13:20] if these things be in you and abound
[1:13:23] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:13:25] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:13:27] of our Lord Jesus Christ now when
[1:13:29] brother Brandon preaches a sermon called
[1:13:31] the statue of a perfect man he takes
[1:13:33] this and he begins to build a house if
[1:13:36] you've ever listened to that sermon he's
[1:13:37] actually building a house or we could
[1:13:40] say like a pyramid he's building a house
[1:13:42] and and so anything structurally like
[1:13:45] you say the pyramid and I've been there
[1:13:47] brother Joel and I have been there and
[1:13:48] stood on that pyramid and stood on the
[1:13:50] entrance to that pyramid on the other
[1:13:51] side and we've actually stood there on
[1:13:53] the stones of that it's so massive but
[1:13:55] it had to have a foundation you notice
[1:13:57] how wide the foundation is compared to
[1:13:59] the rest of the building because it's
[1:14:01] it's it's a phenomenal thing it's built
[1:14:04] uh by by a master Master Builders but
[1:14:07] it's there and it's spread out and it's
[1:14:09] wide and then it gets smaller towards
[1:14:11] the top because the foundation has to be
[1:14:14] sure yeah you got to know that you're
[1:14:17] born again right you got to have faith
[1:14:20] or nothing else works are you hearing me
[1:14:23] today nothing else works you can't
[1:14:25] preach legalism all the time you got to
[1:14:26] have faith sometimes because if you not
[1:14:29] don't have faith you can't dress right
[1:14:31] if you don't have faith you can't act
[1:14:32] right if you don't have faith you can't
[1:14:34] quit your smoking quit your drinking
[1:14:36] quit running around with women or men if
[1:14:37] you don't have faith you can't do any of
[1:14:40] that right without faith it is
[1:14:43] impossible to please God yeah so the
[1:14:47] very first the foundation of the virtue
[1:14:50] in your life is
[1:14:52] faith now brother Brown said notice you
[1:14:54] must be born again and when you're born
[1:14:56] again you can't be born again without
[1:14:58] having faith oh my I hope you hope all
[1:15:01] of us understand that today you can come
[1:15:03] and cry all day all right but you're not
[1:15:05] born again unless you can believe yeah
[1:15:08] what what Jesus did for you are you with
[1:15:11] me now and I'm for you crying I'm for
[1:15:14] alter calls because brother Brandon was
[1:15:17] but I'm not it being at an altar itself
[1:15:19] has no virtue in it what you're doing is
[1:15:21] you're giving something up you're
[1:15:23] surrendering yourself but there but the
[1:15:25] virtue is in the faith that it takes to
[1:15:27] come to the altar the faith that it
[1:15:29] takes to raise your
[1:15:32] hand without faith it is impossible to
[1:15:35] please him for he that cometh to God
[1:15:39] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:15:42] rewarder do you believe he's a rewarder
[1:15:44] today you come to church maybe you
[1:15:46] didn't feel like it maybe you maybe you
[1:15:47] don't you're uncomfortable you don't
[1:15:49] really want to be here but there's
[1:15:50] something in your heart that drove you
[1:15:51] drug you to the house of God and you
[1:15:53] hear this morning and you say I know
[1:15:55] that if I come to God and then approach
[1:15:57] him in the right way I know he's a
[1:15:59] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:16:02] Him amen now how how do I build this
[1:16:06] Faith you might say Ben I how do I help
[1:16:09] how do I build faith in my kids how do I
[1:16:12] build faith in the
[1:16:14] church now brother brand said this is
[1:16:16] for your faith talking about what he's
[1:16:18] preaching he said now Faith cometh by
[1:16:20] hearing the word of God that's right now
[1:16:23] that's that's why how we build Faith
[1:16:26] yeah faith is not based upon shifting
[1:16:28] Sands of man's theology but it rest on
[1:16:31] the Eternal Rock of God's word yeah amen
[1:16:35] I I can't have faith in a doctrine that
[1:16:36] you can't find in the scripture come on
[1:16:39] I can't have faith in a pastor's
[1:16:41] opinions yeah I can't have faith in
[1:16:43] somebody's complexes I got to have faith
[1:16:45] in the word of God yes that's right
[1:16:49] build Faith by preaching the word build
[1:16:53] Faith by reading the word build Faith by
[1:16:55] hearing the
[1:16:57] word so faith is built in your children
[1:17:00] by them hearing the word yeah right so
[1:17:03] if you want your children to have faith
[1:17:05] let them hear the word wasn't that
[1:17:07] phenomenal last week brother Joel
[1:17:09] preaching and just simply laying out you
[1:17:10] need to be baptized well suddenly
[1:17:12] several want to be
[1:17:14] baptized because the word was preached
[1:17:17] and the atmosphere was
[1:17:19] right and it it found fertile ground
[1:17:23] sir I found one time I remember sister
[1:17:26] Stephanie when you were baptized in trip
[1:17:28] and and I preached on baptism and we had
[1:17:31] four baptisms that day and I thought
[1:17:33] well that's that's Elementary to the
[1:17:34] church they they understand this but
[1:17:36] people somebody just needs to hear it
[1:17:38] sometimes they just need to hear repent
[1:17:40] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:17:43] the Holy Ghost you just need to hear
[1:17:46] it amen you just need to hear it and
[1:17:49] then they run quickly to the water to be
[1:17:51] baptized because they hadn't been bed I
[1:17:53] say thank God for that let's let's do
[1:17:55] more of that let's let's teach the word
[1:17:57] to build Faith to the people I could
[1:18:00] have got up here and preach the whole
[1:18:01] sermon on my fight with some other
[1:18:03] preacher wouldn't have built Faith
[1:18:06] right true don't you want to build faith
[1:18:09] in your children let's let's focus now
[1:18:11] on the family unit read the
[1:18:13] Bible oh that's simple brother Ben we're
[1:18:16] wanting to build Faith go to
[1:18:19] church don't let nothing keep you out of
[1:18:21] the house of God and I understand
[1:18:23] there's times you go on vacation and
[1:18:24] things like that but I'm talking about
[1:18:26] if you can if you're here if you're in
[1:18:29] town come to church appreciate brother
[1:18:31] Allan coming out of the woods this
[1:18:32] morning to come to church and Lead
[1:18:34] songs didn't look like he was in the
[1:18:36] woods at 5:00 did it but he got up this
[1:18:39] morning and come to church let's do that
[1:18:42] I know sometimes you're hunting and
[1:18:43] things and you got to be away I I I
[1:18:44] realize that not everybody's going to be
[1:18:46] at church every week but we build Faith
[1:18:48] by showing your children you belong in
[1:18:50] the house of God right and Dad and Mom
[1:18:52] are going to to do what it takes I I'm
[1:18:54] proud of some of you I know you've made
[1:18:56] choices in in your life and in your home
[1:18:58] some of you are here because you want
[1:19:00] your children to be in church and you
[1:19:01] knew where you lived you could they
[1:19:03] couldn't be in the house of God so you
[1:19:04] wanted them to be in the house of God
[1:19:06] make that choice build faith in your
[1:19:09] children because it might be their day
[1:19:11] that they want to receive from God might
[1:19:13] be their day that they want to they want
[1:19:15] to be built into a Powerhouse of god
[1:19:19] good if you teach your children Church
[1:19:21] isn't important you're you're not
[1:19:22] building you're
[1:19:25] destroying right I'm just going to deal
[1:19:27] with that because I I'm not preaching to
[1:19:29] any of you I don't believe you do that I
[1:19:31] believe you teach your children the
[1:19:32] house of God is important some of you
[1:19:33] come from a long ways and can't come on
[1:19:35] Wednesdays and things I understand that
[1:19:37] not preaching at you but just as a
[1:19:38] general principle if you teach your
[1:19:40] children church is not
[1:19:43] important you you destroy
[1:19:48] Faith because what you're doing is
[1:19:50] you're saying well your ball game's more
[1:19:52] important the
[1:19:53] the shows more important that's right
[1:19:55] that's right the world's more important
[1:19:58] right you say well I didn't say that but
[1:19:59] you did that and they learn a lot more
[1:20:02] from what you did than what you
[1:20:06] said what you're doing is if you can
[1:20:08] imagine a job site and we're trying to
[1:20:10] build your children trying to tell them
[1:20:11] you need to be in the house of God a
[1:20:14] church is important you need to be in
[1:20:16] the house of God we live in a day when
[1:20:18] everybody has virtual church I don't
[1:20:19] understand that I I just can't
[1:20:21] comprehend why someone would want
[1:20:23] to would would want to trade the joy
[1:20:26] that we have in the presence of God
[1:20:28] together as Saints for for virtual
[1:20:31] understand virtual if you need it we
[1:20:32] stream because we want people to be able
[1:20:34] to use that if they need it sister Fritz
[1:20:36] is there this morning and and I thank
[1:20:37] God that we've streamed so she can watch
[1:20:39] in different ones but if you can be in
[1:20:40] the house of God if you can be in the
[1:20:43] house of God why why would you choose
[1:20:45] not to be right but but it's just like
[1:20:48] you're on a job site and and and I'm
[1:20:50] over here building I'm build a little I
[1:20:52] can't build nothing but let's just say
[1:20:53] I'm building in the bathroom and I build
[1:20:55] a little build a little stand over here
[1:20:56] and a little closet I'm building a
[1:20:58] closet and on Sunday and then I leave
[1:21:01] okay that little closet you say well
[1:21:02] that's not that important but it's part
[1:21:03] of the house go to
[1:21:06] church right and then next service after
[1:21:09] I preached it and or brother Joel
[1:21:11] preached it to somebody and then parent
[1:21:13] comes in and says well that's not that
[1:21:15] important takes that support
[1:21:17] out you taking us supports out the
[1:21:19] building will
[1:21:21] fall are you with me now so one of the
[1:21:25] ways that we grow and I've been asking
[1:21:26] people how do we keep our kids I know
[1:21:28] I'm just talking to you this morning but
[1:21:29] it's part of what I have to do as a
[1:21:31] pastor how do we keep our kids how what
[1:21:33] do we do how can we I understand get
[1:21:35] them the Holy Ghost that's that's number
[1:21:37] one right get them in the right
[1:21:39] atmosphere that's number one right but
[1:21:41] but what can we do I want to do
[1:21:43] everything we can do right to make sure
[1:21:45] our children what can we do and and what
[1:21:47] I've heard back from people's make sure
[1:21:48] the house of God is number one make sure
[1:21:50] it's important to them and make sure
[1:21:53] that and I thought of this myself you
[1:21:55] know what I've seen is that that
[1:21:57] preaching and practice have to be pretty
[1:21:58] close yeah right if you're going out to
[1:22:01] the casinos and running around running
[1:22:04] around doing drugs and gambling and
[1:22:06] doing all kinds of junk during the week
[1:22:08] you come to the house of God on Sunday
[1:22:09] your kids aren't going to want to go to
[1:22:11] church they're going to want to live
[1:22:12] like you live during the week
[1:22:15] yeah right they're not you say well my
[1:22:18] brother Ben why aren't my kids in church
[1:22:21] and I've been challenged on that before
[1:22:22] had families come to me and I take it as
[1:22:24] a personal failure if a child's not
[1:22:25] leaves if a child's not in church I
[1:22:27] didn't do my job my job is to keep them
[1:22:29] here but it's your job as well you can't
[1:22:32] be going to the job site and stealing
[1:22:33] the material
[1:22:35] out are you with me
[1:22:38] now we just smooth that over and let
[1:22:40] that
[1:22:43] go are you with me so far well brand
[1:22:46] said that's the reason I've been trying
[1:22:47] to keep the message just as simple as
[1:22:49] possible Simplicity builds Faith yeah he
[1:22:52] said some some of you might be wondering
[1:22:53] why I'm not calling prayer lines each
[1:22:54] night here's my purpose in doing this I
[1:22:56] want to build faith in the people in a
[1:22:58] resurrected Jesus so that you don't have
[1:23:01] to wait till some special gift passes
[1:23:03] through the neighborhood you just
[1:23:04] believe in wherever you are I want to
[1:23:06] see Faith built in the church until on a
[1:23:08] Sunday morning on a Wednesday night on
[1:23:10] on a Sunday night you can receive your
[1:23:12] healing why because you're not waiting
[1:23:13] on a gift to pass through you believe
[1:23:15] that the gift is here that God is the
[1:23:18] gift amen the healing is the gift it's
[1:23:21] been bought and paid for by his Tripes
[1:23:23] faith is built by the Simplicity of
[1:23:25] hearing the gospel brother brandom says
[1:23:26] I pray tonight Lord that somehow you'll
[1:23:28] build faith in these people's hearts
[1:23:30] that every one of them will be delivered
[1:23:31] all these sick and Afflicted is that
[1:23:33] what we want today he said may it be so
[1:23:35] simple Lord just let us as we try to
[1:23:37] teach the word let the Holy Spirit I
[1:23:39] love his humility take my mistakes Lord
[1:23:42] and make it a real night that he can bed
[1:23:45] himself into the heart of each believer
[1:23:47] we set this night for that purpose Lord
[1:23:49] May those who are not saved Above All
[1:23:51] Things be ready get ready now all the
[1:23:53] doors of Mercy is still open so we have
[1:23:56] faith and we begin to build I'm going to
[1:23:57] hurry I don't have very many more
[1:23:59] minutes I'll have to have to miss some
[1:24:01] of this but we add virtue to our faith
[1:24:04] said virtue is strength or power he said
[1:24:06] that's the next foundation wall it's
[1:24:09] virtue now we're building this house
[1:24:11] Peter said had virtue Peter's talking
[1:24:12] about building the house of God the
[1:24:14] temple of God fixing it to a place
[1:24:16] virtue like the Lily talks about
[1:24:18] Reverend Mr Lily that always gives out
[1:24:20] he said you can't give out if you're if
[1:24:22] if you can't he said if you don't have
[1:24:24] any to give you got to have virtue you
[1:24:26] got to have power you got to have
[1:24:28] strength right how do you get it by
[1:24:30] feeding on the word you got to believe
[1:24:32] it amen and then if you have it you can
[1:24:34] give it yeah brother brand talks about a
[1:24:37] man coming along I think this will help
[1:24:39] maybe some of us in that sermon he talks
[1:24:41] about a man coming along trying to find
[1:24:44] Salvation and he goes to a church that
[1:24:47] believes the days of Miracles has passed
[1:24:50] yeah and he said said why would he do
[1:24:54] that why would you go to a church who
[1:24:56] can't build Faith right I'm not telling
[1:24:58] you to leave a church I'm telling you
[1:24:59] what the prophet said why would you go
[1:25:01] to a church that doesn't build your
[1:25:03] faith he talked about Jack Co Jack Co
[1:25:05] said if you go to a restaurant you order
[1:25:07] the T-bone and they said well that was
[1:25:09] yesterday's
[1:25:10] menu he said you want to leave and go
[1:25:12] find you a restaurant where the T-bone
[1:25:14] is on
[1:25:15] today praise God made some of y'all
[1:25:18] hungry didn't I all right if I go to a
[1:25:21] barbecue restaurant I expect there to be
[1:25:23] ribs Brother David I I want ribs and and
[1:25:26] if they don't have ribs I want to go
[1:25:27] somewhere where they got ribs if they're
[1:25:29] always out I tell you what I don't want
[1:25:30] to go to I don't want this church to be
[1:25:33] let's focus right here I don't want this
[1:25:34] church to be a church where the ribs are
[1:25:36] never on the menu where the steak is
[1:25:38] never on the menu I want it to be a
[1:25:40] place where faith can be built how can
[1:25:43] that be it's got to be
[1:25:44] preached got to put it on the
[1:25:47] menu the BR said might as well lay the
[1:25:49] menu down and get out cuz he ain't got
[1:25:50] nothing to eat anyhow he said you might
[1:25:52] as well go where a restaurant it's got
[1:25:53] something to eat and the spiritual man
[1:25:55] growing needs something to eat on that's
[1:25:57] the word of God he said and I believe
[1:25:59] every word of
[1:26:00] it now you're moving on up you're
[1:26:02] building you build a foundation you got
[1:26:04] faith and virtue now you're moving up
[1:26:06] you're going to build you're going to
[1:26:07] start framing or framing the house looks
[1:26:11] like a nightmare to
[1:26:13] me some of y'all like that's pretty good
[1:26:16] the house has to be framed
[1:26:19] right we don't want to stay in the
[1:26:21] foundation you said praise God God I got
[1:26:22] saved well that's wonderful you got to
[1:26:24] come up moving on up amen so you frame
[1:26:28] what is that knowledge thirdly you had
[1:26:30] knowledge I don't mean worldly knowledge
[1:26:32] because that's foolishness to God but
[1:26:33] knowledge to judge right from wrong in a
[1:26:36] day when everything is relative let's
[1:26:37] make sure our children have a knowledge
[1:26:39] of right and wrong let's build that into
[1:26:41] their
[1:26:42] lives to judge judge right judge whether
[1:26:44] it's right or wrong to believe God's
[1:26:46] word judge whether I should serve a
[1:26:48] Creed or serve God judge whether it's
[1:26:50] right or wrong we should be mature
[1:26:52] enough that we can tell if the pastor's
[1:26:54] preaching the truth or
[1:26:55] not all right right and we don't have to
[1:26:58] believe it just because the pastor says
[1:26:59] it I've always been differential to
[1:27:01] Authority and just my nature I I try to
[1:27:04] be that I I've always tried to be
[1:27:06] differential to people in authority and
[1:27:07] I believe we ought to be we ought to we
[1:27:09] ought to serve God and try to there's
[1:27:11] many little things we could disagree on
[1:27:13] but when it comes to the to the word of
[1:27:15] God we got to know it for ourselves and
[1:27:17] if what I'm preaching is not the word
[1:27:19] spit it out you don't have to spit me
[1:27:21] out but SP spit the word
[1:27:24] out you don't have to do away with the
[1:27:26] pastor or the preacher just just spit
[1:27:28] away that part of what wasn't the word I
[1:27:30] should say spit away the opinion teach
[1:27:33] your children to judge between right and
[1:27:35] wrong make sure you don't throw away the
[1:27:36] whole pie right but brother Bram taught
[1:27:38] us yeah teach your children to judge
[1:27:41] between right and wrong to know the
[1:27:42] difference years ago I I did a study I I
[1:27:45] read a study where it said kids when
[1:27:48] they were on a
[1:27:49] playground that if they put fences on
[1:27:51] the play play ground they played all the
[1:27:53] way to the edges but if they take the
[1:27:55] fences away then there's they don't feel
[1:27:57] safe and so they group in the
[1:27:59] center fences are not just to hold
[1:28:02] people in fences are there for security
[1:28:05] that's right for safety build frame your
[1:28:10] house build the fences good right fences
[1:28:14] on Sunday we go to church it's a fence
[1:28:18] right just expected on uh when we're
[1:28:21] having a meeting we go to the meeting
[1:28:23] when uh there's something there it's a
[1:28:24] fence you're framing your house when
[1:28:27] there's something going on uh in the
[1:28:28] church we don't talk about people we
[1:28:30] don't run them down we we we have an
[1:28:32] understanding we're building boundaries
[1:28:33] we're building
[1:28:34] expectations Proverbs 23 and2 apply
[1:28:37] thine heart unto instruction and thine
[1:28:39] ears to the words of knowledge you say
[1:28:41] how do I build knowledge into my
[1:28:44] children I'm I'm gon Break Your Heart
[1:28:46] Right Here withhold not correction from
[1:28:49] the
[1:28:50] child on
[1:28:54] oh I got to say it because the word
[1:28:55] still says it if thou beatest him with
[1:28:58] the rod he shall not die he going to cry
[1:29:01] like he's going to die but he will not
[1:29:04] die all the Elder said amen is you've
[1:29:08] been through that and you know what it's
[1:29:09] like I know what it's like I you listen
[1:29:11] if you want to beat your kids you got a
[1:29:14] problem come
[1:29:16] on you're just an
[1:29:18] abuser but don't withhold correction
[1:29:22] whatever form that takes he said if you
[1:29:23] beat him with the rod he won't die and
[1:29:25] and there's a point in life I think when
[1:29:27] you not and and this is me not the Lord
[1:29:29] but I do think you pass a point where
[1:29:30] the rod doesn't do any good anymore you
[1:29:32] look at a 16-year-old kid walking up
[1:29:34] there and he's bigger than you are you
[1:29:36] know that Rod doesn't have much effect
[1:29:38] on him just make him mad that's right
[1:29:42] but there's other things you can do he's
[1:29:44] still a child oh I know that
[1:29:49] hurts yes
[1:29:52] but withhold not correction from the
[1:29:53] child you won't die listen Thou shalt
[1:29:57] beat him with the rod you didn't think
[1:29:58] you were going to hear this this morning
[1:30:00] did
[1:30:02] you I love that thou shalt beat him with
[1:30:06] the rod and shall deliver his soul from
[1:30:10] hell I get in trouble for preaching like
[1:30:12] that but it's still the
[1:30:14] truth that's Godly knowledge brother
[1:30:17] brandom said that that the literate
[1:30:18] Kentucky mama she said he said she knew
[1:30:20] more she knew more than uh than a lot of
[1:30:25] the modern strip teases knew he said
[1:30:27] because if her daughter come home like
[1:30:29] some of their daughters come home and
[1:30:31] she she'd pull out the rod and she said
[1:30:34] she had more knowledge than the educated
[1:30:36] people did yeah come on Church why she
[1:30:39] had Godly knowledge you knew what the
[1:30:41] Bible said brother B said come to this
[1:30:43] knowledge now we're going to move on
[1:30:45] when God said he's the same yesterday
[1:30:47] today and forever say Amen can we say
[1:30:49] Amen to that yes sir not to to the 12
[1:30:52] it's for all he said when you get that
[1:30:54] kind of faith when your faith punctuates
[1:30:56] every bit with an amen glory and you say
[1:30:59] all right add to that add that to it
[1:31:03] amen and Temperance we add Temperance
[1:31:06] that we're building I'm closing in in a
[1:31:07] few minutes won't say how many a few
[1:31:12] is temperance that means brother BR said
[1:31:15] how to control your tongue not be a
[1:31:17] Tattler w we need this don't
[1:31:20] we
[1:31:22] you wouldn't know to dis fellowship with
[1:31:24] those people if you hadn't listened to
[1:31:28] gossip God help me I'm going to turn
[1:31:30] around and
[1:31:32] repent is't that
[1:31:34] true well I can't do I can't fellowship
[1:31:37] with them you know that they did you
[1:31:39] wouldn't know if you didn't listen to
[1:31:40] gossip and I don't care if it come from

[1:32:22] altar even if you're just a Christian

[1:32:25] believer I know that's tough but we we
[1:32:27] need to build we're building lives we're
[1:32:29] building faith we have to do that by by
[1:32:31] building these things in our lives

[1:32:46] don't jump out and roll up your sleeves
[1:32:47] don't you want to do that sometimes
[1:32:49] people call us Pentecostal and I just oh

[1:32:53] we're not nearly Pentecostal enough come
[1:32:55] on
[1:32:56] now prach I would that every one of us
[1:32:59] get a little taste of Pentecost brother
[1:33:02] Allen but I want to jump out and fight
[1:33:04] him and he said don't do that Temperance
[1:33:06] will make you not do that yeah let him
[1:33:09] be your example but talk with Godly love
[1:33:11] Temperance kindness is that the way you
[1:33:12] want to be amen when you're riled upon R
[1:33:15] not back let him be your example when
[1:33:18] they said if thou be the Son of God turn
[1:33:19] these stones into bread he could have
[1:33:21] done and shown he was God but he had
[1:33:23] Temperance when they called him be elab
[1:33:25] he said I'll forgive you for it right
[1:33:27] they pulled handfuls out of the beard
[1:33:29] out of his face and spit in his face and
[1:33:30] said come down off the cross he said
[1:33:33] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:33:35] what they're doing you know we use an
[1:33:37] excuse sometimes I just preached on this
[1:33:39] a little bit uh Friday night we use an
[1:33:42] excuse sometimes we say well I was tired
[1:33:44] I was worn out so I just lashed out you
[1:33:46] realize Jesus had been up all night in
[1:33:48] the Garden of Gethsemane six hours in
[1:33:50] the garden praying until blood and and
[1:33:53] water in his body separated yes he he
[1:33:57] was on a cross he had been whipped with
[1:33:59] a cat of Ninetails pulled strips from
[1:34:01] his body he had every right to claim
[1:34:04] tiredness and lash
[1:34:06] out he was so weak he couldn't carry his
[1:34:09] own cross up the hill but he cried out
[1:34:11] he said father forgive them they don't
[1:34:14] know what they're
[1:34:16] doing oh my I'm not perfect like that
[1:34:18] but I want to
[1:34:20] be I want to sure into
[1:34:24] that 1 Peter 2:21 even here until you
[1:34:27] were called Christ suffered for us
[1:34:28] leaving us an example he should follow
[1:34:30] his steps he did no sin neither was G
[1:34:32] found in his mouth when he was reviled
[1:34:34] he reviled not again when he suffered he
[1:34:35] threatened not but committed himself to
[1:34:37] him that judgeth righteously who his own
[1:34:40] self bear our sins in his own body on
[1:34:42] the tree that we being dead to sin
[1:34:44] should live under righteousness by whose
[1:34:46] Stripes you were healed we had we're
[1:34:49] building now we're building the walls
[1:34:51] we're building the structure building
[1:34:53] around these things patience patience
[1:34:55] with what what kind of patience first
[1:34:57] thing is you have patience with God if
[1:34:58] you got real genuine Faith you have real
[1:35:00] genuine patience When God says anything
[1:35:02] you believe it that's all you got
[1:35:04] patience the Bible says you have need of
[1:35:06] patience that after you've done the will
[1:35:08] of God you might receive the promise
[1:35:10] I'll say to some of you who've been
[1:35:12] baptized you're going to be baptized you
[1:35:13] need to have patience and believe that
[1:35:15] God will fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:17] you need to believe it that's part of it
[1:35:19] it's a promise of God I believe you can
[1:35:21] do it the moment you're baptized but it
[1:35:23] may take some time for you to completely
[1:35:25] die out to the things of the world
[1:35:26] that's okay have
[1:35:28] patience let him build in your life yeah
[1:35:32] James 1:2 my brethren countered all joy
[1:35:34] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[1:35:35] knowing this the trying of your faith
[1:35:37] worketh patience he said and we should
[1:35:39] have patience with one another too right
[1:35:43] yeah we get so impatient with one
[1:35:45] another he he typed that to Moses Moses
[1:35:47] got impatient with the people he said
[1:35:49] but when it really counted the people
[1:35:51] got impatient with God and God said I'm
[1:35:53] just going to destroy him and Moses
[1:35:56] seemingly had a better idea than God but
[1:35:57] he got he got a hold of something in the
[1:35:59] spirit of Christ and he said Lord take
[1:36:01] me not the people destroy my family
[1:36:04] don't destroy the people oh that we had
[1:36:06] more Ministry like that that we willing
[1:36:08] to serve the people and serve God by
[1:36:10] serving his people and Lord I'll step in
[1:36:13] the Gap I'll do what it takes to make
[1:36:15] sure that the people are able to come to
[1:36:17] the house of God and have a place where
[1:36:19] they can worship God I'll do what it
[1:36:21] takes to see that they make it into the
[1:36:22] land Moses didn't make it into the land
[1:36:25] because of his impatience but the people
[1:36:27] two of them at least Joshua and Caleb
[1:36:29] did the promise of God was still true
[1:36:32] have
[1:36:33] patience amen he said brother BR said
[1:36:36] I've tried to get this message over with
[1:36:37] the Tabernacle see that each member of
[1:36:38] the Tabernacle become this it's hard to
[1:36:41] do he said I've tried to have patience
[1:36:42] this 33 years have patience women still
[1:36:45] Bob their hair still just the same but
[1:36:46] just have patience have patience wait
[1:36:48] have to if you ain't got it don't try to
[1:36:49] build on this down here have patience

[1:36:53] are written in the scripture people
[1:36:54] don't do you say well what are we going
[1:36:55] to do we just have patience with people
[1:36:57] not everybody's on the same level some

[1:37:42] here there there's some touchup work to
[1:37:46] do the JT wouldn't still be here unless
[1:37:48] there was some touchup work to do right
[1:37:51] there there's a little bit of there's a
[1:37:52] spot over in the corner take a little
[1:37:54] brush of God's word there's a little bit
[1:37:56] of Faith these be have a little bit of
[1:37:57] virtue a little bit of knowledge a
[1:37:58] little bit of
[1:38:00] godliness means to be like God he said
[1:38:03] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:38:05] which is in heaven is perfect he said
[1:38:06] you got way up here now before you're
[1:38:08] asked to do that all these things has to
[1:38:09] be added first then when you get up here
[1:38:11] he's ask you to now be perfect godliness
[1:38:13] Sons and Daughters of God we sing the
[1:38:15] song to be like Jesus don't you want to
[1:38:17] be like him that's godliness when he was
[1:38:20] SMI M Smith on one side of the face he
[1:38:22] turned the other when he was spoken
[1:38:23] rough to he didn't speak he didn't rout
[1:38:25] back Godly always looking for one thing
[1:38:28] I always do that which pleases the
[1:38:30] father remember you can't do that on
[1:38:32] your own you must have the Holy Ghost if
[1:38:34] you don't have the Holy Ghost none of
[1:38:35] this works yeah yeah you got to have
[1:38:37] that Foundation of Faith yes set and
[1:38:40] then the the divine nature you partake
[1:38:42] of that and then you build you're not
[1:38:45] done when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:38:47] got to
[1:38:48] build Matthew 18:21 then came Peter to
[1:38:51] him and said Lord how often shall my
[1:38:52] brother sin against me and I forgive him
[1:38:53] till seven times that's
[1:38:58] legalism what did Jesus say here's
[1:39:01] godliness I say not unto thee till seven
[1:39:03] times but 70 times
[1:39:06] seven that's pretty rough right there
[1:39:09] I'll say this if you don't forgive
[1:39:11] people you won't be forgiven right if
[1:39:13] you got unforgiveness in your heart
[1:39:14] today you realize your backslid yeah
[1:39:17] right I don't care if you're a preacher
[1:39:19] or a Sunday school teacher or Deacon you
[1:39:22] got unforgiveness in your heart for for
[1:39:25] anybody your backs sleep that's right I
[1:39:28] and I'll say there's there are many
[1:39:30] reasons I understand I get it people get
[1:39:32] hurt yes but you got to
[1:39:35] forgive you don't forgive to help that
[1:39:37] person you forgive to help
[1:39:40] you Jesus said he won't hear your
[1:39:43] prayer unless you forgive when you stand
[1:39:46] praying
[1:39:47] forgive brotherly kindness brother said
[1:39:50] if you see a brother is All Out Of
[1:39:52] Tune I Get Out Of Tune sometimes yeah
[1:39:55] you get out of tune sometimes don't be
[1:39:57] impatient this is finishing right don't
[1:40:00] be impatient with him no be kind to him
[1:40:03] go go anyhow yeah people think I don't
[1:40:08] know what I'm doing when we go to
[1:40:09] meetings and we try to be of a light to
[1:40:11] people I believe you're a strong church
[1:40:14] I believe we've been through enough that
[1:40:15] we strong we know where we stand well we
[1:40:17] go because brother Brandon said to go
[1:40:20] yeah cuz the Bible says to go yeah and
[1:40:22] put our arms around people and draw our
[1:40:23] Circle bigger yeah that's right
[1:40:25] brotherly kindness yeah he said go
[1:40:27] anyhow somebody said not long ago how
[1:40:30] can you believe these things the way you
[1:40:31] do and still go to the Assemblies of God
[1:40:32] and the Oneness all the rest he said
[1:40:34] brotherly kindness yes hoping someday
[1:40:37] patient with him see tempering enduring
[1:40:39] with him knowledge help me Lord I don't
[1:40:42] always I go some places and I get mad
[1:40:44] I'll be honest with you I don't like to
[1:40:46] see people
[1:40:47] mistreated I don't like to I don't like
[1:40:49] to see people it seems like like the
[1:40:52] just forgive me it seems like some
[1:40:53] places that the church is there to
[1:40:56] support the lifestyle of the pastor I
[1:40:57] said God help us today I don't want to
[1:41:00] be that God help me not to be that
[1:41:03] that's not what the church is for we we
[1:41:05] we want to make sure that and it bothers
[1:41:08] me but I still go I still want to
[1:41:09] Fellowship I still want to you know even
[1:41:11] if I'm frustrated I want to go because
[1:41:13] he was frustrated but he went he went to
[1:41:16] Calvary for me the least I could do is
[1:41:18] go to a meeting come on now
[1:41:22] yeah well it might not it might help
[1:41:24] somebody it might encourage somebody may
[1:41:26] not even help you might help somebody
[1:41:28] else right is that worth it what do you
[1:41:31] think you're a builder you going to
[1:41:33] build or leave the paint sitting
[1:41:37] there what does it do said they're
[1:41:40] waiting for the headstone which is love
[1:41:41] for God is love he controls he's the
[1:41:43] strength every one of these things
[1:41:45] aren't you glad for that amen amen he
[1:41:50] said we're hoping and patient I'm going
[1:41:52] to skip down he talks about the great
[1:41:54] Commandments I'm going to skip past that
[1:41:57] and we have so much more I could say but
[1:41:58] we're going to close in a moment well
[1:42:01] the B said when you surrender your
[1:42:02] complete being then the Holy Spirit just
[1:42:03] pours through you yes now think about
[1:42:06] that you got that statue of a perfect
[1:42:07] man I think I put that on the slid
[1:42:09] somewhere I don't know if you can find
[1:42:10] it brother Robert but there's a on the
[1:42:13] slides there's a statue of a perfect man
[1:42:15] on there somewhere if you see it put it
[1:42:18] up for me but brother brand talks about
[1:42:20] when you surrender into your complete
[1:42:21] being the Holy Spirit just pours through
[1:42:23] you you see the Holy Spirit I don't know
[1:42:24] if you can see it I can barely see it
[1:42:26] without my glasses but the holy spirit's
[1:42:28] in between the Capstone and the rest of
[1:42:30] the body so the Holy Spirit Pours Down
[1:42:34] it won't work without the Holy Spirit
[1:42:36] right is what fills the gaps between the
[1:42:40] stones oh God don't you see why we have
[1:42:43] to have atmosphere in our services why
[1:42:45] the Holy Ghost has to be present why we
[1:42:47] need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we need
[1:42:49] to preach the Holy Ghost we need need to
[1:42:51] live we need to walk in the spirit why
[1:42:53] because the holy spirit is what makes it
[1:42:55] all work you can have all the bones of
[1:42:57] it and it just don't work together you
[1:42:59] wonder why is it not working why is it
[1:43:01] producing nonsense why is it producing
[1:43:03] hatred why is it producing fear why is
[1:43:06] it producing children that just turn 18
[1:43:08] and leave yeah why because the holy
[1:43:10] spirit's not been poured through the
[1:43:12] cracks oh God help us today he said so
[1:43:15] when you surrender your complete being
[1:43:16] then the Holy Spirit just pours through
[1:43:18] you in these virtues then you're a
[1:43:20] living Tabernacle people look out and
[1:43:22] say there's a man full of virtue
[1:43:24] knowledge he believes the word
[1:43:25] Temperance patience God and His
[1:43:27] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:43:29] the Holy Ghost don't you want to be that
[1:43:30] man or that woman there he is walking
[1:43:33] around what is it a stature that
[1:43:34] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[1:43:36] a Christian there is a man or a woman
[1:43:39] who knows what they're talking about you
[1:43:40] never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier
[1:43:42] person you're sealed a seal shows on
[1:43:45] both sides whether you're going or
[1:43:46] coming you see the seal just the same
[1:43:48] when a man or woman possesses this in
[1:43:50] the C cap Stone comes down and seals
[1:43:52] them into the kingdom of God which is
[1:43:53] the Holy Ghost and the word coming from
[1:43:55] here manifests itself through each one
[1:43:57] of these beings makes this complete
[1:43:59] being a tabernacle of the Living God a
[1:44:01] walking living example of Christianity
[1:44:04] what Christ was these people are is that
[1:44:06] what you ought to be this morning
[1:44:08] because his life is in there they are in
[1:44:09] Christ and their life is dead and hid in
[1:44:12] Christ to God and sealed in there by the
[1:44:13] Holy Ghost you reckon yourself dead then
[1:44:16] you're born of faith and virtue and
[1:44:17] these other things is added to you till
[1:44:19] you're a perfect Liv living image of God
[1:44:22] is that what you want to be this
[1:44:24] morning let's bow our heads
[1:44:36] together I wish I had more strength more
[1:44:39] voice to preach but I think you
[1:44:41] understand what I'm trying to
[1:44:43] say we're building
[1:44:45] something what you got beside you you
[1:44:47] got a little faith a little virtue
[1:44:49] little knowledge build with it how can
[1:44:52] we help somebody not run them down how
[1:44:55] can we help
[1:44:56] somebody make a difference in their
[1:44:59] lives you're teachers I know you make a
[1:45:01] difference in people's lives I salute
[1:45:02] you for that build don't build just with
[1:45:06] worldly knowledge build with the
[1:45:07] knowledge of Christ build in those kids'
[1:45:10] lives you that teach Sunday school and
[1:45:12] may change some things up in the Sunday
[1:45:14] school we got lots of kids coming
[1:45:17] up you know I remember my Sunday school
[1:45:19] teacher I saw at my my grandma's funeral
[1:45:22] was there a few years ago in a little
[1:45:25] Holiness
[1:45:26] Church and she just taught us for a
[1:45:28] little while maybe a few months but I
[1:45:32] remember I remember because she was
[1:45:34] patient with us taught us the word of
[1:45:37] God just the basics of it but that
[1:45:39] matters that
[1:45:42] matters some of you parents you you work
[1:45:46] and you work and you work you get
[1:45:47] frustrated you think well I I'm just not
[1:45:49] doing a good job
[1:45:51] I I I want to challenge that perception
[1:45:52] today are you building with the word you
[1:45:54] doing your best I believe God's got
[1:45:57] other builders to help
[1:45:59] you you don't have to do it
[1:46:01] all you just build what the area that
[1:46:04] you're called to build and you build
[1:46:05] that you let somebody else build in
[1:46:07] their area you get deacons to build and
[1:46:10] trustees to build and mamas to build and
[1:46:12] daddies to
[1:46:13] build I'd like to have a position in the
[1:46:15] church you don't realize that you have a
[1:46:18] position you are set in Heavenly
[1:46:21] places in the land for a reason you do
[1:46:25] have a
[1:46:26] purpose there is a there is a reality to
[1:46:29] what you're doing build don't just be
[1:46:33] here he said but brother Ben I've made
[1:46:35] lots of mistakes how could I build
[1:46:37] you're not building with your own
[1:46:39] material build with the
[1:46:43] word all of us have made mistakes some
[1:46:46] worse than others I get that some of us
[1:46:48] have fallen flat on our face but
[1:46:51] build you're you're not there it's not
[1:46:53] about you it's not about me
[1:46:56] build let's do what we can to see the
[1:46:59] church become what God wants it to be to
[1:47:01] see the bride become what God wants her
[1:47:03] to be and if I can build here if I can
[1:47:05] build somewhere else if I can build on
[1:47:07] Friday night if I can build wherever I'm
[1:47:10] going let me be let me
[1:47:12] build that's my TR I express my
[1:47:15] frustration sometimes to these preachers
[1:47:16] in the back room and they have to hear
