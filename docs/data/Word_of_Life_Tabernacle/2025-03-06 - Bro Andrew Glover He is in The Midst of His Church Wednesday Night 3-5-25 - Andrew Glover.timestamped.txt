[48:01] we want to go to the Book of Matthew the
[48:02] 18th chapter The Book of Matthew the
[48:04] 18th chapter and then we're going to go
[48:06] to the book of Hebrews chapter 2 amen I
[48:09] don't know if in this ear monitor you
[48:10] could take a little the Lowe's out and
[48:12] put some more the highs in it's real
[48:13] muffled in my ear but here in the Book
[48:16] of Matthew the 18th chapter and the 19th
[48:19] verse uh Jesus here speaking he says
[48:23] again I say unto you that if two of you
[48:25] shall agree on Earth as touching
[48:28] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[48:31] done for them of My Father which is in
[48:34] heaven for where two or three are
[48:36] gathered together in my name there am I
[48:40] in the midst of them I want you to
[48:43] notice this where two or three are
[48:44] gathered together in my name now not now
[48:47] watch what he says there am I in the
[48:50] midst of them amen so his name is
[48:53] actually bringing his presence into the
[48:56] mid of two or three who are gathered in
[48:58] his name now in the book of Hebrews the
[49:00] 2 chapter amen that's a lot better thank
[49:03] you buddy Hebrews chapter 2 and we want
[49:05] to read there in the ninth verse Hebrews
[49:07] 2 and verse 9 he says Paul here writing
[49:11] says but we see Jesus who was made a
[49:14] little lower than the angels for the
[49:16] suffering of death crowned with Glory
[49:19] and Honor that he by the grace of God
[49:22] should taste death for every man for it
[49:25] became him for for whom are all things
[49:27] and by whom are all things and bring in
[49:30] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[49:33] of their salvation perfect through
[49:35] suffering for both he that Sanctified
[49:38] and they who are Sanctified are all one
[49:41] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[49:43] call them Brethren now watch verse 12
[49:46] saying I will declare thy name unto my
[49:49] brethren in the midst of the church I
[49:53] love that I will declare my name unto
[49:56] the brethren in the midst of the church
[49:57] will I sing praise unto thee and again I
[50:00] will put my trust in him and and again
[50:04] behold I am the children which God hath
[50:07] given me we ask Lord this evening to add
[50:10] the blessing to the reading of his word
[50:11] as you can have your seat here this
[50:13] afternoon if I uh were to take a title
[50:16] tonight I want to speak to you for just
[50:17] a few moments on this he is in the midst
[50:21] of his church amen he is in the midst of
[50:24] his church and you know amen it is a
[50:26] real uh special blessing to us to know
[50:29] tonight that we're not just gathered in
[50:31] his name amen but rather we are gathered
[50:34] under the authority of his name and we
[50:36] know that that Authority comes by
[50:38] Revelation yes and the first seal
[50:41] brother B will say Jesus his name on
[50:43] Earth was Redeemer Jesus when he was on
[50:45] Earth he was the Redeemer and that's
[50:48] true he said but when he conquered death
[50:50] and hell and overcome them he ascended
[50:53] on high and he said see he received a
[50:55] new name he said now that's the reason
[50:57] you holler the way they do amen and they
[51:00] don't get nothing see It'll be revealed
[51:02] in the Thunder SE amen notice the
[51:05] mystery so the world Amen is hollering
[51:08] the name Jesus but they're not getting
[51:10] anything amen because they're not in the
[51:12] place where God has provided amen for
[51:15] the believer to be in that's why he says
[51:17] and the name amen is in the word because
[51:20] he is the word amen what is he then the
[51:23] word interpreted amen is the
[51:25] manifestation
[51:27] of the name of God so the word
[51:28] interpreted amen is the manifestation of
[51:32] the name of God so I'll just say this as
[51:34] a Believer there are things amen that we
[51:37] must not forget and there's one thing
[51:39] amen that we must never forget is that
[51:41] this is God's church right amen it
[51:44] belongs to him and he alone see and by
[51:47] the revelation of himself he being the
[51:50] groom amen she the church has come into
[51:53] her true word identity amen of the Bride
[51:56] Jesus Christ see amen she's no longer
[51:59] Baptist she's no longer Methodist or
[52:01] Pentecostal amen but she is now miseries
[52:04] Jesus Christ but going say God being
[52:07] Sovereign he fornew by Divine decree
[52:10] exactly amen who would be in his bride
[52:13] he chose her she did not choose him he
[52:16] called her she did not come on her own
[52:18] he died for her and he washed her in his
[52:21] own blood he paid the price for her and
[52:24] she belongs to him
[52:27] and to him alone see she is Holy
[52:30] committed to him and he accepts the
[52:32] obligation he is her head amen for
[52:35] Christ is the head of his church as
[52:38] Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[52:41] bride amen is happy that he is her Lord
[52:44] amen he speaks and she obeys for that is
[52:48] her Delight now amen I've just recently
[52:50] been listening there in the Hebrew
[52:52] series how many knows that Hebrew series
[52:54] brother been preached it there in 1957
[52:56] and he takes amen the first several
[52:58] chapters of the book of Hebrews and we
[53:00] find amen that the book of Hebrews is a
[53:02] very powerful book Amen in that we
[53:05] believe that Paul amen though the world
[53:08] has has had a had a disagreement on this
[53:10] but we believe that Paul amen actually
[53:12] wrote the book of Hebrews now I love
[53:14] brother br's prayer in the in the
[53:16] Hebrews chapter one he says Heavenly
[53:18] Father tonight as we're so happy to know
[53:21] at the opening of this Hebrew letter how
[53:24] that Paul went right back into the
[53:25] gospels he just wasn't take it upon on a
[53:27] hearsay or upon an experience but he
[53:30] wanted us Amen to know what was truth
[53:33] Paul amen wanted us to know what was
[53:36] truth he went right back in the gospels
[53:38] in the Old Testament the gospel that was
[53:40] preached to them and he seen through the
[53:42] Old Testament the shadows and types
[53:44] that's why we got this great book of
[53:46] Hebrews tonight we see it Lord amen and
[53:48] we love it and through ages amen it's
[53:51] been burned it's been scattered it's
[53:53] been tried to be done away with amen but
[53:55] she just waves on the same amen because
[53:58] Lord you said that heavens and earth
[54:00] shall pass away amen but my word shall
[54:03] not now how many knows in the book of
[54:05] Hebrews what Paul is doing amen is he is
[54:08] separating the church amen from the law
[54:11] unto
[54:12] Grace right he is separating the church
[54:15] amen from the law and the Grace I love
[54:17] what brother says there in just a few
[54:18] places here in paragraph 50 of Hebrews
[54:21] chapter 1 he said our lesson tonight is
[54:23] not deep it's a shallow lesson but oh
[54:26] we'll get into the deep after a while
[54:28] amen this is a very shallow lesson it's
[54:30] just starting off he said but what it is
[54:32] it's one thing amen that is the exalting
[54:35] Jesus Christ that is exalting Jesus
[54:38] Christ another place he said now the
[54:40] whole first chapter amen is exalting
[54:43] Jesus and separating him from being a
[54:46] prophet the whole theme the first
[54:48] chapter is separating Jesus from any
[54:50] Prophet or any law or so forth and
[54:53] showing who Jesus is again he said the
[54:56] chapter amen was the exalting of Jesus
[54:59] so amen that he is the main one in
[55:02] another place Paul is exalting amen and
[55:05] placing positionally the Lord Jesus what
[55:08] what a task folks amen that the first
[55:11] church age messenger had amen he was
[55:14] given what he was given to do was he
[55:16] must separate Jesus from every Prophet
[55:18] from every law and he must exalt him
[55:21] amen and then he's going to positionally
[55:24] place him amen as the preeminent one see
[55:27] amen not only is he Our Savior not only
[55:30] is he our Healer not only is he Our
[55:32] Redeemer amen but Paul was placing him
[55:35] amen as the head of this church let me
[55:38] say this Paul amen did not just have a
[55:41] Healing Ministry amen but Paul also had
[55:43] a Teaching Ministry where the prophet of
[55:46] God said he took the old Hebrew word
[55:48] amen of the Hebrew church and he brought
[55:50] it to life amen and he placed it in
[55:52] Christ amen therefore they knew amen
[55:55] that God was in the man so when Paul
[55:58] separated him and showed you that Jesus
[56:00] was made a little lower than the Angels
[56:02] amen that he was a man amen but Paul
[56:05] showed you that he was not just a man
[56:08] amen but God was in that man oh folks
[56:11] can't you see tonight amen that a
[56:13] prophet did not just separate you amen
[56:16] and exalt you and positionally place you
[56:19] as the Bride of Jesus Christ but he
[56:21] announced unto you that God is in her
[56:24] amen by the baptism of the Holy ghost
[56:26] Paul amen was more than just a preacher
[56:29] yes Paul was an angel messenger amen and
[56:33] he was speaking things that should not
[56:35] be taken lightly come on now in the book
[56:38] of Hebrews the 2 chapter Paul says amen
[56:41] therefore we ought to give the more
[56:42] Earnest heed Amen to these things which
[56:45] we have heard see lest at any time amen
[56:48] we should let them slip I love what he
[56:50] says here he said I pray the Holy Spirit
[56:52] Will sink that so deep in your heart we
[56:54] ought to give the most Earnest heed to
[56:56] these things which we've heard amen what
[56:58] type of a people ought we to be when we
[57:01] see the great Jehovah come down and do
[57:03] the things that he does and see them
[57:05] compared amen scripture by scripture
[57:08] that they're the truth he said we sit
[57:10] around sometimes like warts on a
[57:12] log just so unconcerned see he said we
[57:16] ought to be busy every minute trying to
[57:19] get the people to Christ he said we
[57:21] ought to be Lively Stones we should
[57:23] never be slothful like we are we'll go
[57:25] up to church and see the Lord Jesus do
[57:27] something or bless us and such away and
[57:29] we'll say oh very nice meeting he said
[57:32] now the preaching of the word we enjoy
[57:34] it amen but that's not the main thing
[57:36] see we should not Worship the Lord just
[57:39] after we get through preaching the word
[57:41] as we usually do just worship him that's
[57:43] wonderful see but we should worship him
[57:45] every hour of our life we should worship
[57:49] him every hour of our life when we're at
[57:51] work we should worship him every time
[57:54] the opportunity presents itself
[57:56] amen Worship the Lord by testifying of
[57:59] him now watch a prophet show us amen the
[58:02] different ways of worship he'll say Amen
[58:05] if a sister amen sitting there and you
[58:07] see her doing something wrong or
[58:08] dressing a certain way he said now just
[58:10] take her and say sister there's a better
[58:13] life than this what he's doing he
[58:14] showing you amen you're worshiping God
[58:17] he said you men at work when you hear a
[58:19] men using the name of the Lord in vain
[58:21] get a chance to one side and slip over
[58:23] and take him by the hand and say there's
[58:25] a better life life than this oh yes you
[58:28] shouldn't use those words and tell him
[58:30] in a Meek and gentle way amen all those
[58:33] things is a worship see he said we see
[58:35] someone sick and the doctor says there's
[58:37] no more can be done we ought to Worship
[58:39] the Lord amen by telling them there's a
[58:42] God in heaven that answers prayer now
[58:45] watch what Paul says in Hebrews amen
[58:47] chapter amen chapter 2 and verse number
[58:49] one he says this for if the word spoken
[58:52] by Angels was steadfast and every
[58:54] transgression and disob obedience amen
[58:57] received a just recompense of reward
[59:00] said now watch there that word Angel
[59:02] actually means Messenger right come on
[59:05] that word angel means the messenger he
[59:07] said now do you know that you are a
[59:09] messenger this morning amen you are a
[59:12] messenger of good news or a messenger of
[59:15] bad news he said isn't it beautiful to
[59:17] know that we are ambassadors that we are
[59:19] angels The Messengers amen of the
[59:21] Resurrection we are God's Messengers to
[59:24] this sinful world that Christ Liv lives
[59:26] Amen in our hearts he lives in our
[59:29] Spirits he lives and he brings us amen
[59:31] from the low debauch life of sin and
[59:34] exalts us up and gives us a Hallelujah
[59:37] in our soul and makes us new creatures
[59:40] listen folks he had to be exalted above
[59:43] amen this world so that he could draw
[59:45] you unto himself what does the Bible say
[59:48] if I be lifted up amen I will draw all
[59:52] men unto myself see what a prophet is
[59:54] showing you is the Old Testament word
[59:57] amen was spoken by Angels but it wasn't
[59:59] any kind of word amen it was a steadfast
[1:00:02] word which means it was a stable it was
[1:00:04] a sure it was a firm it was a force
[1:00:07] listen it was a more sure word Peter
[1:00:11] says that we have also a more sure word
[1:00:14] of Prophecy where un we take heed do we
[1:00:17] do well amen as unto a light that
[1:00:19] shineth in a dark place until the day
[1:00:21] Dawn amen and the day star arise in our
[1:00:25] hearts listen what the prophet said the
[1:00:27] same Pillar of Fire amen that come upon
[1:00:30] those men that wrote the Bible is the
[1:00:32] same Pillar of Fire here today amen
[1:00:35] interpreting the Bible see amen and we
[1:00:38] are identified in that word come on
[1:00:41] right our identification is in the word
[1:00:44] see and we are identified in that word
[1:00:47] where the Shak glory in Revelation lays
[1:00:50] another place see every Parable in the
[1:00:52] Bible every type of the Bible is made
[1:00:54] manifest right here here before us the
[1:00:57] same God in the pit of fire that wrote
[1:01:00] the Bible both in the Old and New
[1:01:01] Testament is right here manifesting it
[1:01:04] showing it exactly interpreted right
[1:01:06] back Amen to make sure that it's the
[1:01:09] interpretation I love what he screams
[1:01:11] out we have got the interpretation
[1:01:14] listen we are not waiting for the
[1:01:16] interpretation we are not looking for
[1:01:19] the interpretation we have got the
[1:01:21] interpretation amen the word has been
[1:01:24] made manifest in our men
[1:01:26] that's why Paul says in Hebrews 2:12
[1:01:28] amen saying I will declare amen thy name
[1:01:32] unto my brethren but where's he going to
[1:01:34] do this brother Harold in the midst of
[1:01:36] the church he said will I sing praise
[1:01:39] unto thee look at this word midst it is
[1:01:41] in the middle it is the midst it is in
[1:01:44] the midst of Amen it is amongst oh folks
[1:01:47] it is of a necessity tonight amen to
[1:01:50] identify who is in our midst amen is it
[1:01:53] just a preacher is it just a good
[1:01:55] feeling is it just an emotion or a
[1:01:57] sensation who is in the midst of us when
[1:02:00] you recognize who is in our midst amen
[1:02:03] that will birth a faith in your soul
[1:02:05] Amen to believe that he who is in our
[1:02:07] midst has the power to do exceedingly
[1:02:10] and abundantly above all that we could
[1:02:12] ask or than my said may I your servant
[1:02:15] now be anointed amen for this service
[1:02:17] that's coming on May everyone here be
[1:02:20] anointed right come on and may we see
[1:02:23] the working of the hand of the Living
[1:02:26] God who is in our midst oh Church of the
[1:02:30] Living God we have just identified who
[1:02:32] is in our midst is the Living God now
[1:02:36] according to Hebrews 2 Paul says amen
[1:02:39] that God would visit man right in
[1:02:41] Hebrews 2:6 but one in a certain place
[1:02:43] testified saying amen what is man that
[1:02:46] thou are mindful of him or the son of
[1:02:48] man that thou would visitest him look at
[1:02:52] this word visitus it means to look up in
[1:02:54] order it means to look upon in order to
[1:02:57] help or to benefit amen it is to look
[1:03:00] after to have care for to provide for
[1:03:04] and it's speaking of God brother said he
[1:03:06] cares to you care when he was here on
[1:03:08] the earth as I say amen he cared for the
[1:03:12] people thank you Lord so much till he
[1:03:14] healed their sick he comforted their
[1:03:17] hearts he told them about a place where
[1:03:19] he would go and prepare for them and
[1:03:20] would come again to receive them unto
[1:03:22] himself
[1:03:24] see he cared for the people now I love
[1:03:27] what Paul says he says in a certain
[1:03:29] place he testified now if you want to
[1:03:32] find that certain place it's actually
[1:03:33] Psalms the 8th chapter and the fourth
[1:03:35] verse David which was a messenger of God
[1:03:38] Amen he testified that God would visit
[1:03:41] man now you all know that David had many
[1:03:44] visitations from the Lord right amen
[1:03:46] David had visitations in the good times
[1:03:49] amen as well as in the bad times you
[1:03:51] know that God actually visited Moses in
[1:03:53] the form amen of the pillar of at The
[1:03:56] Burning Bush Moses amen did not miss his
[1:03:59] visitation by by by taking those leaves
[1:04:02] Amen to the laboratory and analyzing it
[1:04:04] he knew that who was in the midst of
[1:04:06] that fire amen was almighty God I love
[1:04:09] what the prophet says Christ is visiting
[1:04:11] the Gentile church it's the evening
[1:04:14] lights that's just shining now amen the
[1:04:16] prophet said in the evening time it
[1:04:18] shall be light he said now this is the
[1:04:21] hour and this is the time if you'll just
[1:04:23] take that little some kind of little
[1:04:24] something and amen that wants to make
[1:04:26] you kind of halfway believe it and
[1:04:28] halfway doubt it brush that thing aside
[1:04:31] amen and come now it's Christ Jesus the
[1:04:33] son of God who is the same yesterday
[1:04:36] today and forever listen we are more
[1:04:39] than just a church here tonight we are a
[1:04:41] favored people amen we have found favor
[1:04:44] with the King he promised he would meet
[1:04:47] us here listen the message of the hour
[1:04:49] is not just a church it is not just a
[1:04:52] ritual amen but this message is an
[1:04:54] invitation listen You'll either accept
[1:04:57] it or you'll reject it it's an
[1:04:59] invitation to Salvation it's an
[1:05:01] invitation to Healing it's an invitation
[1:05:04] to a miracle it's an invitation to a
[1:05:06] Deliverance listen folks we're not just
[1:05:08] gathered here up on this Hillside
[1:05:10] tonight with about 30 or 40 Believers we
[1:05:13] are gathered here with the King of Kings
[1:05:16] and the Lord of lords has come down in
[1:05:18] our midst to visit the church all right
[1:05:21] come on God promised Israel he would be
[1:05:24] in their midst but they wanted to King
[1:05:25] an Earthly King so they go to Palestine
[1:05:28] they got settled down there then they
[1:05:29] begin to act like the Philistines in the
[1:05:31] Gentile world he said what happened it
[1:05:34] finally LED them to an Ahab Amen to a
[1:05:37] total backsliding and they fail to
[1:05:39] recognize the real King when he come he
[1:05:42] said that's the thing the churches has
[1:05:43] done today they have accepted all this
[1:05:45] other philosophy and Doctrine and
[1:05:48] psychology and different things instead
[1:05:50] of receiving the Holy Ghost and now the
[1:05:53] king is in the midst of the church and
[1:05:55] they don't know it amen they rejected it
[1:05:58] just exactly the way they rejected Jesus
[1:06:00] there amen so is the church rejecting
[1:06:04] him here today listen let me say what a
[1:06:06] prophet said he is not just coming he is
[1:06:10] here he is here in this church tonight
[1:06:13] by the promise of his word now if you go
[1:06:15] back in the Book of Genesis in the C
[1:06:17] chapter amen of the entire Bible you
[1:06:20] will find everything in the world today
[1:06:23] amen it started in the Book of Genesis
[1:06:25] how many knows that in that book of
[1:06:27] Genesis in the second chapter amen there
[1:06:30] were two trees right the Bible said the
[1:06:32] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[1:06:34] and I want you to catch something where
[1:06:36] were these two trees amen they were in
[1:06:39] the midst of the garden amen the tree of
[1:06:42] life and the tree of knowledge amen
[1:06:45] stood side by side amen they were in the
[1:06:48] midst of the garden now brother tells us
[1:06:50] very plainly that the Tree of Life
[1:06:52] represented Jesus and the tree of
[1:06:54] knowledge repres presented the devil he
[1:06:56] said now the religion and the spiritual
[1:06:58] world are made of those two trees which
[1:07:01] have their roots in Eden both the tree
[1:07:03] of life and the tree of knowledge of
[1:07:05] Good and Evil amen they stood in the
[1:07:08] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[1:07:10] very branches intertwined each other he
[1:07:13] said now listen God will speak to each
[1:07:15] one he will talk about each one he will
[1:07:17] call them the church the only the elect
[1:07:20] will really know which is the true
[1:07:21] spirit for only the elected will not be
[1:07:24] deceived amen so out of these two trees
[1:07:27] amen was the birthing of two Spirits
[1:07:30] which would birth two churches right
[1:07:32] yeah there would be a true
[1:07:35] church and there would be a false church
[1:07:37] now way back there in the early church a
[1:07:39] very short period after Pentecost the
[1:07:41] false Vine got to intertwine itself
[1:07:43] around the True Vine and we find the
[1:07:44] deed to the nickel adans now the spirit
[1:07:47] is going to be found fighting the True
[1:07:49] Vine until it is destroyed by God he
[1:07:53] said now we start with the fact that
[1:07:54] there were two trees in the midst of the
[1:07:57] garden the tree of life was Jesus and
[1:08:00] the other tree is definitely Satan
[1:08:02] because of what came forth of the fruit
[1:08:04] of that tree now then we know that both
[1:08:07] of these trees had a relationship to man
[1:08:10] or they would have never been placed
[1:08:12] there they must have had a part in The
[1:08:14] Sovereign plan and purpose of God in
[1:08:17] their relationship to mankind to himself
[1:08:20] or we could never impute omniscience
[1:08:22] unto God now brother makes it very plain
[1:08:24] he says the word word most definitely
[1:08:26] sets forth from that from before the
[1:08:29] foundation of the earth that the purpose
[1:08:31] of God was to share his eternal life
[1:08:35] with man that's in Ephesians 1 you can
[1:08:37] read it but that life could not and
[1:08:39] would not be shared in any other way
[1:08:41] through the way God manifested In the
[1:08:44] Flesh now man could not directly come
[1:08:47] and partake I want to read this to you
[1:08:49] is that
[1:08:49] okay man could not directly come and
[1:08:52] partake of that tree of life in the
[1:08:54] midst of Gard
[1:08:55] the eternal life of that tree had to
[1:08:58] become flesh first but before God could
[1:09:00] raise and save a sinner he had to have a
[1:09:03] sinner to save and to raise now man had
[1:09:06] to fall The Fall which would be caused
[1:09:08] by Satan had to have flesh to make fall
[1:09:12] Satan had to come through the flesh also
[1:09:14] listen but Satan could not come through
[1:09:16] human flesh Amen to make the fall as
[1:09:19] would Christ come in human flesh to
[1:09:21] restore the fall but there was an animal
[1:09:23] the serpent so close to a man
[1:09:25] that Satan could get to that beast and
[1:09:27] through that Beast he could get to human
[1:09:30] flesh and cause the fall and inject
[1:09:32] himself thereby into the human race even
[1:09:35] as Jesus would one day come and inject
[1:09:38] himself into the human race into human
[1:09:40] bodies even to the extent of a
[1:09:42] resurrection wherein we would have
[1:09:44] bodies like a Mis glorified one thus
[1:09:46] what God worked out here in the garden
[1:09:49] was his predestinated plan and when
[1:09:52] Satan had brought about that which was
[1:09:53] necessary to the purpose of God then man
[1:09:56] could not get to the Tree of Life In The
[1:09:58] Garden certainly not it wasn't time but
[1:10:01] an animal had caused the fall had it not
[1:10:04] he said let animal life be shed was
[1:10:06] taken and his blood shed then God had
[1:10:09] communion with man again listen then
[1:10:11] there was to come a day when God would
[1:10:14] appear in flesh and by the means of his
[1:10:17] humiliation he would restore Fallen man
[1:10:20] and make him a partaker of that life
[1:10:22] eternal once you see this you can
[1:10:26] understand the serpent seed and know
[1:10:28] that it was no apple that Eve ate it was
[1:10:30] the degradation of humanity by
[1:10:32] intermingling the seed listen in the
[1:10:35] Garden of Eden he was in the midst of
[1:10:37] the garden amen by the Tree of Life
[1:10:40] listen but then there was the fall in
[1:10:41] the garden which opened up the door Amen
[1:10:44] to death and suffering and it entered
[1:10:47] into the human race he said there death
[1:10:49] had entered how do we know amen look
[1:10:51] what he says do we not hear the voice of
[1:10:53] the spirit raised in that stage amen for
[1:10:56] all who will hear as he is calling to
[1:10:59] him that
[1:11:00] overcometh come on will I give to eat of
[1:11:03] the Tree of Life in The Paradise of God
[1:11:06] the church had already embedded too
[1:11:08] deeply of the tree of death or the
[1:11:10] denominational false Vine whose end is
[1:11:13] the Lake of Fire but there are no cherub
[1:11:15] and with the flaming swords Amen to
[1:11:17] guard the tree of life now listen folks
[1:11:20] the same tree of life that was there in
[1:11:22] the midst of the Garden of Eden amen has
[1:11:25] returned to the church in the last days
[1:11:28] he said now God Amen does not now depart
[1:11:31] from the midst of the church as he
[1:11:33] departed from Eden oh no he will ever be
[1:11:37] in the midst of his church until the
[1:11:39] final age until the time he caused all
[1:11:42] to come home listen the devil might have
[1:11:45] put him out back there but there's a
[1:11:47] church in the last days who has been
[1:11:49] sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:52] listen he's not on the outside of this
[1:11:54] church death will not put him out sin
[1:11:57] will not put him out unbelief will not
[1:11:59] put him out there is a predestinated
[1:12:01] seat of God on the earth tonight to
[1:12:03] receive him in all of his power and all
[1:12:06] of his glory I love what the Bible says
[1:12:08] Revelation 2:1 unto the angel the church
[1:12:11] at Ephesus write these things amen sayth
[1:12:13] he that holdeth the Seven Stars in the
[1:12:16] right hand somebody shout
[1:12:18] holdeth who holdeth the Seven Stars in
[1:12:21] his right hand I love this next part and
[1:12:24] who walk in the midst of the seven
[1:12:26] golden candlesticks somebody shout
[1:12:29] holdeth and walketh amen he holdeth the
[1:12:33] seven golden candlesticks amen and he
[1:12:35] walketh in the midst of them look at
[1:12:37] this word holdeth it means to be
[1:12:39] powerful it means to be Chief to be
[1:12:42] master of it means to be ruler it means
[1:12:45] to keep carefully and Faithfully Amen to
[1:12:47] continue to hold look at this word
[1:12:49] walketh it means to make due use of
[1:12:51] opportunities listen there he is he of
[1:12:54] whom it is SA that this same Jesus is
[1:12:56] both Lord and Christ there he is the one
[1:12:59] and only Lord God Almighty and beside
[1:13:02] him there is no other what he was in the
[1:13:05] first age he is in all ages to every
[1:13:08] believer he is Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:11] yesterday today and forever what he did
[1:13:14] once he is still doing and he will keep
[1:13:17] on doing now you will notice that Jesus
[1:13:20] is walking alone in the midst of his
[1:13:23] churches there is no one else with
[1:13:26] him Jesus alone is walking in the midst
[1:13:31] of his churches there is no one with him
[1:13:34] when he tried the fishness of the Wrath
[1:13:36] of the fiery furnace it was not another
[1:13:38] but him who hung up on the cross and
[1:13:40] gave his blood he is the author and the
[1:13:42] finisher of our faith he is the Alpha
[1:13:45] and the Omega of our Salvation we are

[1:15:29] dying that life that was in it will come

[1:17:00] declares unto us that Jesus is amen the
[1:17:04] captain of our Salvation thank you Lord
[1:17:07] and the only way he could become the
[1:17:10] captain of our Salvation was he had to
[1:17:13] suffer Hebrews 2:11 for he that
[1:17:16] Sanctified and they who are Sanctified
[1:17:18] are all one amen so the life that is in
[1:17:21] the head amen the preeminent one the
[1:17:23] main one the exalted one is now in his
[1:17:26] church listen watch a prophet bring the
[1:17:29] two together in St John 15:5 he says I
[1:17:32] am the vine and ye are the branches see
[1:17:36] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[1:17:38] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:17:41] without me ye can do nothing I love what
[1:17:45] he says oh don't you see the vine and
[1:17:46] the branch there the congregation says
[1:17:48] amen so they they actually still said
[1:17:50] amen back then the congregation says
[1:17:52] amen he says all one
[1:17:55] amen so here's the vine and the branch
[1:17:58] and they're all one in other words what
[1:18:00] the vine does the branches will do also
[1:18:03] amen if the vine suffered amen the
[1:18:06] branches will suffer also but listen
[1:18:08] they will come to the same destination
[1:18:11] listen there was a purpose in the
[1:18:13] suffering of the vine and there is a
[1:18:15] purpose in the suffering of the branch
[1:18:18] amen if you can turn these fours up and
[1:18:19] be good he may commit you to suffering
[1:18:21] as he did job his purpose is after that
[1:18:24] we have suffer for a while we would be
[1:18:26] made perfect we would be established and
[1:18:28] strengthened and settled as job said he
[1:18:31] put strength in us so in very plain
[1:18:34] language the very character of Jesus
[1:18:37] Amen was perfected by the things which
[1:18:40] he suffered unless we suffer with him we
[1:18:43] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:18:45] to rain see and this little temporary
[1:18:48] suffering that we go through amen now
[1:18:50] it's not worthy to be compared with the
[1:18:53] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[1:18:56] in us when he comes brother bab said
[1:18:59] look the church that is not suffering is
[1:19:01] not being tried amen hasn't got it it is
[1:19:05] not of
[1:19:07] God now either we believe what a prophet
[1:19:09] said or we don't and he said a church
[1:19:12] that's not suffering and it's not being
[1:19:14] tried he said that church is not of God
[1:19:18] listen you say well I wish the Lord
[1:19:19] would just hold back the trials and he

[1:22:20] Paul says for as much than his children
[1:22:22] are partakers of Flesh and Blood yeah
[1:22:25] he also himself likewise took part of
[1:22:27] the same and that through
[1:22:30] death he might destroy him that had the
[1:22:33] power of death that is the devil and
[1:22:36] deliver them who through fear of death
[1:22:39] were all their lifetime subject to
[1:22:41] bondage now watch for verely he took not
[1:22:44] on him the nature of
[1:22:45] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:22:48] Abraham right wherefore in all things it
[1:22:52] behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:22:54] brother that he might be a merciful and
[1:22:56] faithful high priest in things
[1:22:57] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:23:01] for the sins of the people now watch for
[1:23:04] in that he himself has suffered being
[1:23:07] tempted he is able to secure them that
[1:23:10] are tempted come on yeah I love this
[1:23:12] word secur it means to sympathize that
[1:23:16] the reason he became this that he might

[1:23:34] Christ seek those things which are above
[1:23:36] where Christ sth on the right hand of
[1:23:39] God I love this quote he sits there to
[1:23:41] make intercession he sits there to love
[1:23:44] you and though you go astray he won't
[1:23:46] forsake you he will still come after you
[1:23:48] and knock at your heart there's not a
[1:23:51] backslider in the building but what
[1:23:52] knows that God kn s at his heart daily
[1:23:56] and he will do it as long as you're a
[1:23:58] mortal on this Earth for he's loved you

[1:24:06] sheep in St John chap 10:1 I am the Good
[1:24:10] Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his
[1:24:12] life for the Sheep but he that is a
[1:24:14] hirling and not the shepherd who's own
[1:24:16] the sheep or not seeth the wolf coming
[1:24:19] and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the
[1:24:21] Wolf catcheth him and Scatter the Sheep
[1:24:24] he said the hiring fleeth because he's
[1:24:26] an A hirling and careth not for the
[1:24:28] Sheep he says but I am the Good Shepherd
[1:24:31] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[1:24:34] as the father knoweth me even so know I
[1:24:37] the father and I laay down my life for
[1:24:40] the sheep and other sheep I have which
[1:24:42] are not of this fold them also I must
[1:24:45] bring and they shall hear my voice and
[1:24:47] there shall be one fold and there shall
[1:24:50] be one Shepherd there shall be one fold
[1:24:53] and there shall be one Shepherd listen
[1:24:55] the shepherd is in the midst of the
[1:24:57] sheep look at verse 27 he said my sheep
[1:25:00] hear my voice and I know them and they
[1:25:03] follow me and I give unto them eternal
[1:25:06] life and they shall never perish and
[1:25:08] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:25:11] my hand remember comes along and the
[1:25:13] Good Shepherd of the sheep and he said a
[1:25:14] man owner of the sheep when he went to
[1:25:16] get a Shepherd he went and searched out
[1:25:19] till he got the best Shepherd he could
[1:25:20] be gotten because he loved his sheep and
[1:25:23] this man must must be a special trained
[1:25:25] in knowing how to take care of the sheep
[1:25:28] he must know what kind of food they eat
[1:25:30] he said now listen the Sheep of God Amen
[1:25:33] are fed by the word of God he said the
[1:25:35] holy spirit in you what makes you the
[1:25:38] Sheep feed solemnly on the word and
[1:25:40] solely he feeds on the word and anything
[1:25:43] you throw in the pen outside of the word
[1:25:47] he will root it out to one side and let
[1:25:50] it lay there he said see God selected
[1:25:52] the great Shepherd of the flock the Lord
[1:25:53] Jesus
[1:25:54] and gave him all the authority now
[1:25:58] before he can go to lead the Sheep he
[1:26:00] has to know the shepherd's voice he said
[1:26:03] the true Shepherd lays down his life for
[1:26:05] the Sheep the hireling shepherd won't
[1:26:08] listen he will run away and leave the
[1:26:10] Sheep amen but the true Shepherd will
[1:26:12] stay with the sheep and I'm so glad he
[1:26:15] said these words amen lo I Am With You
[1:26:17] Always even to the end of the world see
[1:26:21] as long as God's got a sheep God's got a
[1:26:23] sheep to lead that
[1:26:26] sheep how happy we should be that God's
[1:26:29] sheep led by God's Shepherd how long was
[1:26:32] it to be a little while and the world
[1:26:35] will see me no more but yet ye shall see
[1:26:38] me for I'll be with you leading you
[1:26:40] feeding you guiding you amen shepherding
[1:26:43] you un the end of the world he said God
[1:26:46] Shepherd he don't have to take one down
[1:26:48] and put another one up because man
[1:26:50] cannot be God's Shepherd in that sense
[1:26:53] one dies another one takes his place but
[1:26:55] this one Shepherd I love this quote the
[1:26:57] great Shepherd over the flock laid down
[1:27:00] his life once yeah glory and it's become
[1:27:05] immortal and his Spirit now it can never
[1:27:09] be killed oh God Amen sin might have put
[1:27:12] him out of the midst of the garden amen
[1:27:14] unbelief might have put him out of the
[1:27:15] midst of the garden but he has reserved
[1:27:18] unto himself a second Eve a second womb
[1:27:22] a second bride he is Conant Perpetual
[1:27:24] leader and feeder of the sheep until his
[1:27:27] Corporal body comes from glory and he
[1:27:29] sits on the throne of David and all the
[1:27:31] Lambs will be around him listen you say
[1:27:34] well I wish I could have been there when
[1:27:36] he sat there with the disciples and he
[1:27:38] show him the scripture I wish I could
[1:27:40] have been there when he sat there in the
[1:27:41] midst of the synagogue and he opened up
[1:27:44] the word and he said this day is the
[1:27:46] scripture fulfilled I wish I could have
[1:27:48] been there brother Ben when he sat there
[1:27:50] and told him about the Miracles and he
[1:27:52] broke the fish and the Loaves and he fed
[1:27:55] him can I say this the same life that
[1:27:57] was there is right here tonight in the
[1:28:01] oh God it's here in the same way except
[1:28:04] the Corporal body but said well then if
[1:28:06] he's the same he's got to be the same in
[1:28:09] principle he's got to be the same in
[1:28:11] power he's got to be the same way in
[1:28:14] every way except a Corporal body you say
[1:28:17] well he's not here in a corporate body
[1:28:19] but can I say this he's still
[1:28:21] here the Bible said he's always always
[1:28:24] been here in some form brother BR picks
[1:28:26] it up he said now God has always been on
[1:28:30] the earth how many believes that God has
[1:28:33] always been on the earth he says God has
[1:28:37] never left the Earth if he'd ever leave
[1:28:39] the earth I don't know what would become
[1:28:41] of it but God has always been here in
[1:28:45] some form glory to God he's always been
[1:28:49] here in some form Oh Praise His Name
[1:28:51] well what form is he here in tonight
[1:28:53] Church is he here in a Corporal body is
[1:28:56] he here with nail prints in his hands is
[1:28:58] he here with a long robe on I'll tell
[1:29:00] you how he's here he's here in the form
[1:29:04] of his word he is here in the midst of
[1:29:07] his church in the form of his word say
[1:29:11] it very beautiful he said and you notice
[1:29:13] there the Bible speaking of the Lamb of
[1:29:15] redemption there it spoke of it as a
[1:29:17] singular amen killed the lamb but in
[1:29:19] other terms every family killed a lamb
[1:29:22] but all represented one L and in the
[1:29:25] spiritual meaning of it that each one of
[1:29:27] these families the father being the
[1:29:29] priest of the own house they was to kill
[1:29:31] the lamb for each house that they could
[1:29:33] eat the meat and but it all represented
[1:29:36] one lamb that means in reality that
[1:29:39] there's many missions or many churches
[1:29:41] there's bodies of Believers but they're
[1:29:43] all together representing one lamb we're
[1:29:46] all feeding off of the same lamb listen
[1:29:50] we're all feeding all of the same
[1:29:52] message listen what he said see what I
[1:29:54] mean here is one church over here and
[1:29:56] another one down there and one in Africa
[1:29:59] one in agypt but it's all from the same
[1:30:02] lamb the Redemption comes from the same
[1:30:05] lamb and we're fed oh my the body of the
[1:30:09] Lord Jesus which is the word thank you
[1:30:14] Lord say very powerful we receive him in
[1:30:17] the form of the word a correct Shepherd
[1:30:21] will feed his congregation on the word
[1:30:24] the lamb take it without water not sod
[1:30:26] just eat it raw roast it with bitter
[1:30:28] herbs sometimes it's kindly hard you
[1:30:30] have to maybe break up a few things but
[1:30:31] don't worry it's all right eat it anyhow
[1:30:34] you're getting ready for the journey
[1:30:36] other place you say then brother brandom
[1:30:38] if Christ is on Earth today a real
[1:30:40] servant would take him to him Christ
[1:30:43] well Christ is here in the form of the
[1:30:47] word and the word brings life because he
[1:30:50] is the word and Christ is the word see
[1:30:53] yes
[1:30:54] he is the word himself the true servant
[1:30:58] always takes you to the word somebody
[1:31:01] asked me one time they were I was
[1:31:02] counseling with somebody and they were
[1:31:03] asking me some questions and they said
[1:31:05] brander amen everything you say you
[1:31:07] always say well there's a quote where
[1:31:08] said or there's a scripture and then
[1:31:10] they said why don't you just speak on
[1:31:11] your own accord I said because I can't
[1:31:13] feed you as a lamb of God anything
[1:31:16] separate from what the word says listen
[1:31:18] folks either the word is our Compass or
[1:31:20] it's not either the word is our God or
[1:31:23] it's not
[1:31:24] he said now he is the word he is this
[1:31:27] Bible made living and when you die to
[1:31:29] yourself with Christ like a corn of
[1:31:31] wheat then the word lives in you and
[1:31:34] brings forth the same results as it did
[1:31:37] in that living corn of wheat that had to
[1:31:39] drop into the Earth you are a partaker
[1:31:43] in his resurrection you are a partaker
[1:31:45] with him and all of his blessings and
[1:31:47] all of his manifestations you're
[1:31:49] partakers with him in all that he did
[1:31:53] right
[1:31:54] I love this the trial TOA Kansas
[1:31:57] paragraph 143 now still they won't
[1:31:59] believe it but Jesus promised that that
[1:32:01] as it was in the days of Noah as it was
[1:32:04] in the days of lot it would be in this
[1:32:07] last day we've got it it's here it's
[1:32:09] already Vindicated just how many
[1:32:11] scriptures in the Sodom age what
[1:32:14] happened to Abraham would return back
[1:32:17] again to Abraham's Royal seed which is
[1:32:20] in Christ Christ returning oh God in the
[1:32:24] form of the word working in human beings
[1:32:28] oh yes my goodness Christ returning in
[1:32:33] the form of the word working in human
[1:32:36] beings sir and showing the signs that he
[1:32:40] promised it would sign it would do he
[1:32:42] promised he would do it can I say this
[1:32:44] to you the word is in our midst wherever
[1:32:48] two or three are gathered together in my
[1:32:50] name there am I in the midst what is the
[1:32:53] name is the manifestation of the word of
[1:32:56] God listen folks that's why the prophet
[1:32:59] said I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:33:01] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:33:05] that's why in the first seal he said
[1:33:06] they're hollering Jesus but they're not
[1:33:09] getting anything because they made Jesus
[1:33:11] something separate from his word but if
[1:33:13] you want deity in your midst then
[1:33:16] welcome and receive the word see Jesus
[1:33:19] is the word revelation 1:12 and I turned
[1:33:22] to see The Voice spake with me and being
[1:33:25] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:33:27] John does not say that he turned to see
[1:33:30] the one whose voice he heard but he
[1:33:32] turned to see the voice oh I like that
[1:33:35] he turned to see the voice the voice and
[1:33:39] the person are one and the same can we
[1:33:42] say it together Jesus is the
[1:33:46] word Jesus is the word in the beginning
[1:33:49] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:33:52] and the Word was God the same was in the
[1:33:54] beginning with God and all things were
[1:33:57] made by him and without him was not
[1:34:00] anything made that was made are y'all
[1:34:01] ready for this are you ready for this if
[1:34:04] you can ever really get to see the word
[1:34:07] you will be seeing Jesus all right if
[1:34:11] you ever start really seeing the word
[1:34:13] you will be seeing Jesus if you ever see
[1:34:17] the word you'll be seeing Jesus when
[1:34:19] John turned he saw seven golden
[1:34:21] candlesticks actually they were
[1:34:23] lampstands and according to verse 20
[1:34:25] there are the seven churches but seven
[1:34:28] candlesticks that thou sawest are the
[1:34:30] seven churches to represent the churches
[1:34:33] they could hardly be candles because a
[1:34:35] candle burns but a while and then it is
[1:34:37] burned out it dies there would be no
[1:34:40] more of it see but lampstands possess a
[1:34:44] lasting quality that is not found in
[1:34:46] candles now watch a prophet he goes from
[1:34:49] that right to Malachi 4 and reads
[1:34:51] Malachi 4: 1-3 can we just read it
[1:34:54] behold the day come that shall burn as
[1:34:56] an oven and all the proud yay all that
[1:34:58] do wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[1:35:00] cometh shall burn them up said the Lord
[1:35:02] of host that it shall leave them neither
[1:35:03] root nor Branch but unto you that fear
[1:35:06] my name there it is but unto you that
[1:35:08] fear my name shall the son of
[1:35:10] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:35:12] wings and you shall go forth and you
[1:35:15] shall grow up as calves of the stall ye
[1:35:18] shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:35:19] shall be ashes under the SES of your
[1:35:21] feet in that day shall I do this saith
[1:35:24] the Lord of host listen but unto you
[1:35:27] that fear my name come on folks that's
[1:35:29] not a scare amen that's not a fear as
[1:35:32] you're afraid amen of something of
[1:35:34] danger but unto them that reverence my
[1:35:37] name unto them that recognize my name
[1:35:39] unto them that respect my name unto them
[1:35:42] that fear my name shall the son of
[1:35:45] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:35:48] wings there it is again he says the Su n
[1:35:51] is shining out all his strength oh the
[1:35:53] strength drink of the Son of God Amen
[1:35:56] shining in the midst of the seven golden
[1:35:58] candlesticks there he stands the one the
[1:36:02] judge who suffered and died for us he
[1:36:05] said yes there he stands amidst the lamp
[1:36:07] stands with the Stars in his hand it is
[1:36:10] night for that is when we lamp that is
[1:36:12] when we use lamps for light that is when
[1:36:14] the stars are seen shining and
[1:36:15] reflecting the light of the sun and it
[1:36:17] is dark Sea and the church is walking by
[1:36:21] faith in the darkness her Lord dep of
[1:36:23] this Earth are you with me but the Holy
[1:36:26] Spirit still shines out through the
[1:36:28] churches thank Lord come on folks he's
[1:36:32] never left the
[1:36:36] Earth but here a prophet says our Lord
[1:36:39] her Lord has departed this Earth but the
[1:36:42] Holy Spirit still shines out to the
[1:36:43] church giving it light to his old sin
[1:36:45] cursed World those who reflect his light
[1:36:47] also the light only have is the only
[1:36:49] light they have is his light how dark it
[1:36:52] is how spiritually cold yet when he
[1:36:54] comes into the midst it is the light and
[1:36:56] warm and the church are you ready for
[1:36:59] this is empowered come

[1:44:08] disciples and gave them power listen
[1:44:11] what he says the word made flesh 1954
[1:44:14] what kind of people should we be if the
[1:44:16] very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or
[1:44:19] empowered that you don't use your own
[1:44:21] thoughts you don't use your own mind you
[1:44:24] don't use your own opinion but the Holy
[1:44:26] Spirit has you so built until your
[1:44:28] thoughts and your being is God's spirit
[1:44:32] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:44:35] of church would we be what kind of
[1:44:37] church would it be this morning if the
[1:44:39] brandom Tabernacle was so filled with
[1:44:41] the presence of God yeah you didn't even
[1:44:44] use your own thoughts you didn't have no
[1:44:47] alternative of your own but just to be
[1:44:49] led by the spirit they that are the sons
[1:44:54] of God are led by the spirit of God are
[1:44:56] y'all ready for this then when the human
[1:44:59] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:45:01] fills that vacancy where you empty
[1:45:04] yourself he says hey man then will be
[1:45:06] when the church in its power of the
[1:45:08] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[1:45:10] in his steps and his power and his
[1:45:11] thoughts and his being and his moving
[1:45:14] then your thoughts will become
[1:45:17] words oh God and words will become
[1:45:22] material thank you Lord you ever been
[1:45:25] thinking about something all day long
[1:45:27] thinking about it thinking about it
[1:45:29] thinking about it and you come to church
[1:45:30] and brother Ben you start preaching that
[1:45:32] word and it goes out there and it
[1:45:33] strikes that
[1:45:35] thought and somebody shouts amen or
[1:45:38] Hallelujah you know what's happening
[1:45:41] words have come from Fault right to word
[1:45:45] to
[1:45:46] material said that's when the church in
[1:45:48] its power I believe it's on its road
[1:45:50] that when the church will be so wrapped
[1:45:52] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so
[1:45:54] away from their themselves they don't
[1:45:55] see themselves they don't have no
[1:45:56] thoughts but to serve God and their
[1:45:58] thoughts move on they refuse the things
[1:46:00] of the world they just move in the
[1:46:02] spirit they live in the spirit move in
[1:46:03] the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill
[1:46:05] the law of Christ then the love of
[1:46:07] Christ in the human heart moving in the
[1:46:09] Holy Ghost that great wonderful church
[1:46:11] will go forth with power and deity
[1:46:14] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:46:17] beings yeah by the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:46:21] to pass the thought of their mind
[1:46:24] another one that when God sends
[1:46:25] something to the church in every age if
[1:46:28] the people receive it it becomes a great
[1:46:30] thing and the church is empowered and
[1:46:32] great things take place but if the
[1:46:34] church rejects it that church just goes
[1:46:36] out into a Darkness another place I
[1:46:38] would ask you to be merciful unto them
[1:46:40] Lord and whatever there is the cancer of
[1:46:42] doubt now listen to this listen to The
