this place and say wasn't it good to be in the house of the Lord pray you'd meet every need touch every heart we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this morning uh turn with me to John chapter 1 John chapter 1 and verse one and then we're also going to uh read from John 1:14 we're going to read John 1 1 through3 3 John 1:14 and then Luke 4 Luke 4:16 John 1 and 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him who were the things made by made by the word and without him was not anything made that was made made and then uh verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and then I want to go to Luke chapter 4 and verse 16 you just bear with me for a moment also going to have a a baby dedication tonight uh the little Andrew's baby's going to be dedicated this afternoon I believe it's still at the schedule so we're looking forward to that uh Dustin Fel it's good to see you this morning they're going to be married on Saturday so if y'all I'm sure can make it to that I'm sure you'd be welcome I think there's an invitation there in the back good to have them with us today Luke 4:16 he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and and begin to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now brother Brandon when he uses that in this day the scripture is fulfilled he says this he said now we want to draw from that a conclusion of how Dynamic is the word of God oh I just love that how Dynamic is the word of God pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated when Jesus identifies himself in Revelation chap 2 to the pergan church age he identifies himself as one who had the sharp sword with two edges a sharp sword with two edges and and Revelation 2:12 these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges we know that's the word Hebrews 4 and12 says for the word of God is quick how many know what quick means quick means alive the word of God is alive you don't have to make it alive but the word is alive it is alive and Powerful it is powerful it's the nature of the word to be both alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of under of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so the word is alive it is powerful and it is a discerner in Ephesians 6:17 it says you take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit which is the word of God in Revelation 19 we find him coming back on a white horse and I believe that'll happen one day I believe we're going to be following him on a white horse that's what the Bible says I can't totally explain that but I believe it's going to happen and so uh it tells us that that's what's going to take place this is after the Rapture in the marriage supper and it says it says he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God someone say it with me the word of God his name is called the word of God Revelation 19:15 out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations he shall rule them with a rod of fire and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and I want to what I want to bring to you today is are we sufficiently impressed with the word of God in our midst today are we sufficiently impressed with that word I want you to hold on to that thought now brother brandom says we can see his association with the word he is the word that's who he is the word in his name in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word he said the root from which we get our translation for word is logos and I want you to remember that this morning logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus random goes on to ask the question are we sufficiently impressed with that word are we sufficiently impressed with the logos the expression of God in our midst I want to ask you that this morning are we sufficiently impressed with the logos with the word in our midst or are we uh are we sufficiently impressed or are we uh are we waiting on something else to happen or someone else to come or something else to catch our attention Brother Bruce is it possible that we already have what we need our attention should already be caught by the one who's in our midst who is the word and I want to tell you this morning he's not just there when everybody's there or it's a big meeting or or a large congregation but he's there this he's here this morning he is the word in our midst how many believe that today he is the word here today and if the word is here then the power is here the spirit is here and are we sufficiently impressed with that that's the question oh my impressed means to affect especially forcibly or deeply to gain the admiration of or the interest of I want to challenge you I want to challenge you young people are you impressed are you are you does it have your attention is the word something that you can just take or leave or is it a reality in your life is it something that uh that that that you live by is it something that you boy you you still you would make a mistake and and I know many of us we make mistakes all of us do because we're human beings but when you make a mistake what do you do if the word if you have a a sufficient impression of the word what happens immediately you'll go back and say Lord I didn't mean to do that I know that's not what the word says to do so it would just about kill you to cross that word and that's where we need to be and it goes with what we're going to talk about this afternoon but but there's a there's something about a holy ghost filled Christian that the word becomes Dynamics to you when you believe it and when you receive it when you hear it it actually becomes alive to you are you with me this morning it actually begins to affect you in a in a real way oh my so the word is not just something brother random said on a tape it's not just something that the preacher says on Sunday morning it's not just the printed letter but it's something that lives it's something that's alive and powerful and able to take care of our needs has the word affected us deeply right and and in the message I know people sometimes have a hard time understanding message people because you say well you live your life by Co code of conduct and you do things maybe you make you different from the world why do we do that we don't do that because we're forced to right or we shouldn't right we don't do that because some Pastor beats us over the head with it right you you sisters dress the way that you do and and you don't do that because I'm up here constantly just telling you you better do this or I might see you at the Walmart and and you know I don't do that but why do you do the way you do because you've been impressed bled by the word and it's something that God wants it's something that oh church it's something that God wants and so there's an impression there and and we got to reach a place of maturity in our life that we will not cross the word no matter what we feel like no matter what we see coming no matter what happens in our lives we will not cross the word I'm not going to keep my own ideas I'm not going to give it my own twist I'm going to believe what the word says are you with me now and this this message this morning and I don't want to belabor the point but it's impressed deeply on me and God put it in my heart and I asked myself the question am I sufficiently impressed with the word and I want to ask you that question as well and only you can answer that question does it have our interest and and it begs the question what should we be impressed by right because we we are impressed many times by by loud things and flashy things and big things but the word when he came wasn't big wasn't flashy wasn't loud but he was powerful the most powerful thing that was ever in the Earth was Jesus right brother the most powerful sermon that was ever preached was preached sitting on a rock right Jesus preached it blessed are the peacemakers Blessed blessed are you and menual reval you what was it the most gracious words ever proceeded from the mouth of a man was when he just read the word and began to tell him this day this scripture is fulfilled right are we impressed with that are we impressed with who God is cuz he is the word in St John 1 he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being right oh that's a great that's a great thing he said now watch how he did it this is in questions answers on Genesis in 1953 brother Ron was so far ahead of his time he he he's watching here we got people that were trinitarians and mostly and and and and Oneness or whatever that they were but they didn't have an understanding like this but this was a prophet of God he said now watch how he did it now back there when this little Halo comes he said now we can't see nothing yet but just by eyes of Supernatural we see a a Halo the brand calls it a white light a a little if we can imagine a a pillar of fire say little Halo standing there he said no that's the Son of God the logos he said I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity see he said now then in his imaginary makeup or in his thoughts and what he's thinking he begin to think of what things would be I can hear him say let there be light now you talk about a powerful thing right nothing exists and the word that little light that come from God that was God that was in the beginning with God that little light that's in you this morning by the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you with me now that little light was church that little light was so powerful when he spoke that he spoke and the worlds were framed Oh my he said let there be light and Light Came brother brandom goes into that how it happened now he he made all things the Bible says no man has seen God at any time only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and he's the one as we read earlier that made all things that was uh brother Bram said that was called by Bible readers the logos or the anointing as I was going to say the part of God begin to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was because you can't comprehend eloh him right he just just incomprehensible it's impossible right but then God would he would he would condescend down into something a part of God which was the fullness of God because God's not diminished by by transforming himself and so this part of God becomes the fullness of God but it's the Son of God but it's something we could we could tell what it was right it began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of idea what it was he said it was a little low a little light moving he said that was the word of God I want you to notice he said it was the anointing but it was the word right so in the beginning the word was not a dead letter it was never a dead letter it was the anointing was the word and the Word was the anointing come on it's the same one who brooded over the Earth yes sir right the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved that word moved is is brooded fluttered as as Deuteronomy says he fluttered Wings it's the same word he flutters over uh his young the same word is it's the moving of of the of the eagle in the nest it's the movement of of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God so the anointing of God is the word of God is the spirit of God right I know this is got a little depth this morning but I just want you to hold on to it and you young people don't don't lose interest because there's something here for you as well I believe we can all understand this he was God the logos the word that went out of God when it began to brood upon the Earth and it brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the word right which God said let there be in there went the logos which is the word so he brooded over botney life he brooded over animal life and he finally brooded over human life until he made it in his own image but he said that man fa like the seed has to fall and then God be to Bro over that after the fall he brought up an Enoch he brought up an Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought up Prophet after Prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said now that same logos has a part he's got a bride and the same logos I love this this word that cannot be tampered with sir is amen brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation what's he doing here this morning what what's your purpose of coming to the house of God are we sufficiently impressed with that that the same Holy Spirit the same logos the same word the same anointing that was there before time where there was nothing but Caleb and it began to form itself into something at the word of God that same word is the word that we have this morning the word that's in our lips Church the word that's in our hearts young people you don't have to struggle and always be overcome and always say well I just have to give in this and give into that no the word is in you we don't have to give in with our families we don't have to give up and say well well it's just going to be like that the rest of our lives we're always going to be that way no we don't have to do that we've got the word inside of it you say well I've been seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it just seems like it never comes but the word it wants he's brooding over you he wants to give it to you more than you want it today the word is giving you life just imagine him this morning think about it sometimes we just got to put it in a way that we can see it that light the same one had his picture taken with brother brandom that light is here this morning say how do you know that because I brought with me you brought him with you right that light which is the powerful word the anointing the the holy spirit is here and and um you say brother Ben you're mixing up all those terms I'm doing that on purpose because I think sometimes we we dwell too much on a separation between the word and the spirit when the fullness of the word is there it's never without the shikina amen it's just the shakina is there the only time that the word become a dead letter was when they added Creeds to it and the shakina was missing from the temple and the Word was missing from its place that's the only time it become dead was when the either they either the word was was not there or was handled with unclean hands or something else took place that was never a moment if the word was actually there that the spirit didn't honor that word right oh church this morning if we want to have Revival we got to preach the word if we want to have God me in our midst we got to preach the word if you want to have a home life that that's what God wants it to be you can go to meeting after meeting and seek everything that you can find but I'll tell you what'll change your home life I'll tell you what it'll change the atmosphere around your home is if you begin to repeat the word and you begin to speak the word and you begin to live the word I say what word should I speak well the Bible the message of the hour right which is the light on the Bible we shouldn't be afraid of any of it should speak it we should hear it but we should speak it see this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today Matthew 18 and 20 says where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them in John 14:20 he said at that day brother brandom taught us that was this day shall you know you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you brother BR said today he is standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself uh more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same making himself known and one day oh I believe we'll see him in the flesh one day one day you'll see that one that you felt in your heart and see his identification and will become personalized before you and then you and he are one you've United by the word and the Word was in the beginning we go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me he said Hallelujah listen we're here and if you go back and listen to that brother BR gets really excited when he's preaching he said we're here you can hear the emotion in his voice we're here oh Church oh I want to declare to you today not because I said it but a prophet of God stood and declared it and the word declares it to you where two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in the midst thereof where are we gathered in his name in the place the only God's only provided place of worship we're gathered together in Christ Jesus and when we are gathered together what are we doing we're declaring the word we're becoming the word what is he doing he's saying I'm in you and you in me Hallelujah he said I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right Among Us and see what he promised for the word he said not what somebody's emotion singing and jumping and dancing but by his word he is making himself known and you know I I want to I want to add this because we're not a a real emot otal church but I'll say I I love emotion I love the word you you all know me I've been around you long enough the way I back a preacher is the way I've always backed to preachers since I was a kid I I enjoy the word of God I enjoy the presence of God I enjoy getting free and seeing people be free to worship God whatever way that God strikes their heart I enjoy that but but it's not the jumping or the dancing or the shouting that's not what we preach we preach the word we preach the word why because the word is making himself know when they brought built the temple and brought the ark into it God went in there brother BR said with a pillar of fire this this is a great type he said amen he said it was David jumping and screaming it was all the singers in the priest carrying on when they was out of the will of God so it had the same kind of Revival they danced when it came back wrong and when it come back right they sing when it come back wrong and when it come back right same kind of Revival right but the first time it was David doing it that's what he said it was David jumping and screaming it was the singers it was the priests carrying on when they was out of the will of God but when God identified the Ark in his place and position remember when it come into the temple he said before they could get the Ark in there here come the pillar of fire leading the way oh church that's the kind of worship that we want that's the kind of church that we want we want the lost the powerful word of God to lead the way into our worship be the one who leads our singing and our dancing and our clapping and everything else Lord may you lead that's why if you're going to play music in the church you need to live right if you're going to preach in the church you need to live right if you're going to whatever I'm put myself there too if you're going to be a deacon you need to live right if you're going to be a Christian you need to live right why because we want the pillar of fire to lead the way we're not up here just to make a show we're not here just to mail it in or have another service we're here to see the anointing of God the same powerful word that was here in the beginning come back again and come back and change lives oh we need that church don't we need lives to be changed some of y'all know what that is some of y'all your lives were recently changed you know what it is you know that the word can change you I think some of us need to be we need to realize we don't just get changed when we're born again we continue to be changed from glory to glory we need to be changed this morning attitudes need to be taken away ungodliness needs to be taken out our thoughts need to be changed we need to be made closer to God we need to be brought all the way into the presence of God how will we do that when the pillar of fire leads the way if if the Revival's not led by this message which is the the word of of God right if the message is not in the Forefront of the Revival it's not a true Revival are you with me now y'all going to have to forgive me today I just feel it and I know it's true he said it found it found a resting place and the glory of God was in there till they couldn't even see how to minister brother brand said it'll close the eyes of every Theologian when he comes for his bride oh don't you want that kind of atmosphere around you if you want that kind of atmosphere believe the word live the word take the word he said she'll be taken up in the middle of the night as it was to them they won't even see her go said oh praise be to God Amen see the word is here brother random taught us he is here but he's in spirit form I love this he said this is him you see in the picture see it's he the Lord the logos the angel of the Covenant and he's standing present amen again in 1962 he said but this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here oh my brother BR said think of it the same Pillar of Fire that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today do we really believe that church say well it was there when brother brandham was there but the pillar of fire didn't leave brother Bram taught us that right I can show you where he taught us that he taught us that the pillar of fire when Joshua came it became a person you say Well it become a person who did it become the bride right it's manifested son of man is manifested in the bride now where he was manifested in one man not a part of the bride and he was manifested in Christ being the fullness of the godhead bodily but he said how we thank him for that he said he's here today interpreting the Bible I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do he said I'd rather be ident identified in that than all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran and all the rest of them I think we need to get proud I think we need to get you know everybody's so excited the ones who won about who they voted for in the election and sad to say the the prohibition party didn't win so it's kind of bummed about that but you know if you voted for the right for the party that won you're like well you know I kind of tell people that if you vote for the party that loses you kind of hide that fact you know what is it but there's something to be proud about we got something to be proud about it's much much greater identification sir are you with me now much greater identification than republican or democrat or American right or Word of Life Tabernacle or or citizen of Hardy Arkansas wherever that you live there's a much greater brother Justin a much greater identification than that what is that greater identification it's the pillar of fire appearing visibly Among Us amen he said I'd rather be identified with that identified in the word where that Shina of glory and Revelation lays the pillar of fire appearing visibly Among Us identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount Si oh my John 1 1 John 1 and one says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon it's a powerful scripture because John saw Jesus In the Flesh and he's saying what I saw what I handled the word of life he said for the life was manifested we have seen it so it wasn't a dead letter because it was manifested right so the quickening of the word is the manifestation of the word that's all it is healing in your body is just a manifestation of the word right it's a manifestation of the word God said by his stripes I'm Healed so if I have faith in that word healing is a manifestation of that right they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what is it a manifest estation of the word amen so the word the life was manifested we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father with his son Jesus Christ listen to me Church you and I can say this morning we've seen him we've seen him in our generation not because we saw William brandom or or not because we you saw me or I saw you but because we saw the word coming open again being manifested again just like he was back then hallelujah brother Bram says I'm going to deal with this tonight but I'll just Dro this in here he said the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it's receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live I I want to I want to give you some I want I want to give you some meat to that tonight so just just hold that in your heart now brother Brandon said Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow that is Bible now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word he said in the pergan age which was a as yet 200 years off from the patmas vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God I've had people tell me well brother Ben I still feel like a Christian but and you may still be a Christian God May bless you but that's not how we tell if we're right or not right how he tell is by the word and not by some Twisted you know we've done mental gymnastics to get there put this with this and we're the only one in the world that believes it right that's not the word I'm talking about talking about the plain word right it's not Mark Twain said it's not the Bible it's not the parts of the Bible I don't understand that have a that bother me he said it's the parts I do understand so it's not some kind of esoteric uh uh mind of something you figured out and it's okay for me because I've connected this with this with this same thing Satan did to Eve at the beginning it's not okay if the word says it's wrong it's wrong if the word says it's right it's right a and so brother Bram says he's presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst how many know we need God with us we need God with us because you recognize your pastor can't do it by himself and and the song leaders can't do it by themselves and and the preachers can't do it by themselves and and you as a congregation you can't get in the spirit all by yourself and just you might be able to have a good time but you couldn't really affect any change you couldn't move you can't add to your stature one cubit you you can't add one hair back to your head but we serve a God who made your body we serve a God who can heal your body we serve a God who can change your mind we serve a God who can heal your mind we serve a God who can change our young people who can make them right we serve the word of God Amen and so he must be in our midst if he is in our M if you want be it in your midst welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word amen things affect us because we want something to be a certain way and because we want it that way Satan always attacks our feelings right he can whoop you on your feelings brother brand said because he attacks our feelings we want it to be a certain way and so we devise a path through the word that would reach us that would make it okay I say God I I know I'm a human being I know I'm subject to mistakes but let me acknowledge the word is true let me just say God you're right and I'm wrong could we say that today all of us brother Brandon says that which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that he said I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst amen remember when Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled immediately the next scripture they saidis this not Joseph's son right they weren't impressed because it just looked like a man and he stood up and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and it just appeared like it's just it's just the word oh church he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word of the let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1 John 5:14 we're told this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know we have the petitions we desired of him right he said now we ask what is the will of God he said there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God one way to know his will by the word of God Lamentations 3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it he said so we can't can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will so to ask according to the word of God to ask in his name is to act ask according to his will which is to ask according to the word he said now then and I'll just tell you if you're a sick person today you can ask according to the word I don't care how old you are or how sick you are or what the doctor said about come on church you can ask according to the word he said I am the god that heals all if you're a person that wants to be saved and you need you need the holy ghost in your life you need a you need a change in your life you can ask and believe that God will give it to you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost believe the word his name is the word his will is the word and if you do that and follow God's commandment he will fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he said brother Brown said you can't separate God in the word they're one he said' now then this word he was left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life so the spirit that's in you I want to challenge you on this today because I I hear people say well you know as the bride we're just waiting on the Dynamics to come and there is a there is a great Dynamics coming we're going to have a body change right but the Dynamics is the spirit of God in you so if you have the Holy Ghost you have the Dynamics right the Dynamics is not a good church service the Dynamics is not is not us all getting excited but the Dynamics is the spirit of God in every individual are you with me this way that's what the Dynamics is so we're not it's not that we're constantly because if we're not careful church we'll we'll be shaken by how the church is going going and and the church is going good but what if it goes bad you know what if some things happen we'll be shaken by how politics is going right some of y'all think politics is going good right now but huh come on church but what happens if it goes bad right what what are you going to be led by what are you going to what's the Dynamics to you what what do you what do you care deeply about what are you impressed by is it is it a win of a certain party is it a certain person singing is it a certain person preaching or is it the word being in our midst today the same yesterday today and Fe oh I say let's be impressed by the word let's grab a hold of the word make it our life and then you become steadfast and immovable cuz you're not relying on what people think about you you're relying on the word you're not relying on what people say about you relying on the word it's not about whether I see results I'm relying on the word listen if Noah went by results he'd have a hard time convincing anybody to come to his church he preached every Sunday and nobody believed it and he preached the same thing over and over again I try not to do that but just over and over and over again it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain and every day every week the same congregation came and left came and left came and left finally the church went down just knowing his kids and they were suspect if you read the Bible there they were they were interesting people ham was in there and the women the women brother BR said serpant he'd come across through the women I look at that look at that church it looks like well that's not God not doing much but God was fulfilling his word that's right amen they had a rainbow Covenant they had God said God said you're going to make it through the flood listen to me church that's not even our type what's our type Enoch Enoch walked with God and he was not what was it he he he because before he before he was translated he had this testimony he pleased God oh Church how do you please God by believing his word that's the only thing without faith it is impossible to please him the Bible says are you with me now so we just can't look at results we can't look at you know I appreciate our church I think the results are good and we've got things growing good that's not what you look at look at the word that's being preach cuz results can fool you right cuz the Baptists have results the methodists have results I'm going do a lot of good things that's not what we count whether something's right we count it by the word amen I look brother brand said he said his word is life this word he was left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith in a spirit filled life he said his word was life John 663 but that is exactly what he is John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 88:9 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his he said there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so in a spirit born Spirit-filled man how many have been filled with the spirit of God you know that the spirit born Spirit-filled man Hallelujah takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Church you don't understand that I don't even I can't even comprehend that because we don't understand how powerful deity is but when we repeat the word when we speak the word we are not victims anymore we are creators you say well I'm in a bad situation the Earth was without form and void in a complete state of chaos oh Church chur and when the word of God the spirit of God the anointing of God the Holy Spirit moved on the face of the waters what happened in that home sir come on Church what happened in that home of mankind what happened in that place where God was calling where he was calling his children to be what happened in that place that was marked out for Redemption the the life begin to form Sun begin to come and the moon begin to come and and the botney life began to come and he brooded over until it came forth Why by the power of the word yeah but see many times we want to just speak the word and just boom mountains moved or made if you like mountains but that's not that's not how it works many times his word will not return to him void will accomplish what he said it would accomplish but it's not going to happen in my time or your time right but just speak the word amen look what he says the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go he didn't say how fast it would go but it has to go Satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church Church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again Hallelujah why because the word is alive what did Brother brand say when you read that this day the scripture is fulfilled he said I want to tell you how Dynamic the word is dynamic means alive quickened we should never look at the word of the hour as a dead letter I just want to address that for a moment we should at the message is dead letter if the message is dead letter to you you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost right because if it's the word if the Bible is dead letter to you you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he's the writer the author of the word right so that's how you change that situation I don't look at it as dead letter it's only dead if you've not been quickened that's right but if you've been quickened the word in you responds to the word on printed page now the word is the Dynamics because the word and the spirit is the same brother renom taught taught us that the church system was waiting on Dynamics we know that that the mechanics are there but they're waiting on Dynamics he said they're waiting on their Dynamics which is an influx of satanic power particularly in the form of the Antichrist so they're waiting on the Antichrist to become flesh that'll bring bring the Dynamics to the church system brother brand said there you are that's the hour that we've arrived at so the Dynamics will be to the machine that's there right will be a person I want you to keep that in your mind the Dynamics will be a person the Antichrist incarnate right he said there you are that's the hour we've arrived at and that's the big machine that's set up he said he said now they've got the mechanics the only thing they have to have is Satan in there with the Dynamics to force the marking of the beast when she is forced down he said then the Dynamics is working the mechanics is there and they've already got them so the mechanics have been waiting for all of these years for their person to arrive but let me say this we we believe that there will be a Dynamics coming to the church at what the person of Jesus Christ but but he's not coming back to the Earth in the way that the Antichrist is right he he he's coming back in the air we go to meet him right everybody knows that we go to meet him and then three and a half years later he comes down on the Mount of Olives with us right so so he's not he he's he don't come say so how do the Dynamics get here the son of man Ministry oh God the word made flesh how do the Dynamics get here a Rapture message see the B brother BR taught us that that the Rapture I know I know this is deep but just think with me for a minute and I don't it's not great because it's deep it you might just confuse people but I want you to understand right we want to make it not deep for you but but brother brand taught that the the shout was a message how many know that the shout was the message go back to the Rapture tape if the he said he does all three as he descends so where is the Dynamics where is the power to live are we waiting on something are we waiting on somebody are we waiting on another church are we waiting on more Fellowship are we waiting on this that or the other to come I say no we're not because the the Dynamics oh my came down with a shout and it'll culminate this age will culminate in the going home of the Bride where we'll see him in a flesh body in a glorified body you understand but the Dynamics is here hallelujah so the Dynamics is working brother Brandon says that the the bride he said will not be will not be brought together by natural force he said natural force drove Israel into their Homeland natural force drove the drives the churches into the into the Council of churches into the Catholic Church into a one world religion but it'll be it'll be the love of God hallelujah the power of God that that'll draw the bride into Christ yes sir brother BR let me say something this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it's United time uniting time with of God and his bride too he said I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there and they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the Earth in the glory and the Rapture I believe with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it so there's a Dynamics coming are are you with me now but he's descending on us right now what we already have will be increased until we go home we're not waiting on a Pentecostal Revival we're not waiting on 1906 to repeat itself I'm not waiting on a bunch of gifts to pop up around the church what am I waiting on a person sir yes sir Hallelujah waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory and the Rapture he said I believe with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it what do we not know now now look there's a part we don't know what is that we have the opening of the word the seven Thunders revealed but we don't know the day or the hour but that's all we don't know brother Bram said he's here and he's the same in every aspect except for the Corporal body can we believe that church then he is the Dynamics in the mechanics right now you say well I don't believe that brother Ben okay here's what brother brownon said about he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine Hallelujah of his body forming oursel into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper oh my his love gifts so I don't have time to get into that he we've been giving love gifts what is he talking about he's talking about the gifts that Rebecca got from elaser amen his love gifts El eer gave her the gifts but they were from Isaac they were from Abraham she was going to be married to Isaac I look his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that they're big churches to be United speaking of the the church nominal he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in small measure listen he's already here but he said we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies he said the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit the Dynamics is him he's here this morning church I want you to believe that with all of your heart he's here one day it'll become so great he he'll his presence will be so real it be so great not just a feeling but a reality of it that he's actually the dead will raise [Music] up right and we have you know Luther had just enough Dynamics to make the word live just enough for justification and Wesley had just enough for sanctification and a witness of the spirit shouting right Pentecost had just enough for the gifts run around the building but said they blew all their steam out the whistle right but I like to see that because it's evidence of steam you know right least they had steam people ain't got no steam but they just they blew it out the whistle but now look there's got to be the locomotive he said you got to go down the tracks how do you do that the Dynamics and the mechanics they had just enough Dynamics to do that but what do we have in this age a full seven course meal a full open book a full reality of the word being know don't you see why Satan would like you to look for something else some Revelation that comes by some man or some kind of an idea or some kind of a church or some kind of church don't be deceived by that look at what we already have what do we have the message of the hour which is enough to get us home amen yes sir brother BR said the Holy Ghost will always point to the word if it points to a Creed or denomination it's not the Holy Ghost he couldn't do that point away from his word when he died to confirm that word make that word a positive he died so he could come himself into that word he is the quickening life that makes that word live again that was his purpose of dying see through denominational ages he he was he was shut out and we find him in the lab see an age knocking get back in but when he is in the house he is the Dynamics of the mechanics listen and we are not those who not locked him out well listen we're not church he said I W call you church anymore I'm going to call you bride you realize what that distinction means it means he's entered in the door it means he's eating with you he's right here with you what does that mean it means that you're his bride and if you're his bride the Dynamics is here today listen to me young people you can worship God today you don't have to wait on a camp meeting you don't have to wait on something else to happen you can worship him today you can live above sin today you can live for God today you can you can work for God today every one of you don't matter what you've been through or what's happened in your life you can serve God with all of your heart why the Dynamics is here he's here I'm not pausing for effect I got to catch my breath remember said that was his purpose of dying and he could still project himself through his church and make every word someone say every word through every Age act just like exactly the way it's supposed to act he is the Dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it Apostles prophets teacher so forth he is the Dynamics that works that and it's worked by a certain dynamic which is called like he said he's the fire that fires off the gas he's the fire that's in the combustion chamber when the gas the word is poured over that combustion chamber he's the one that sets her a fire he's the one that confirms that he's the power of the Resurrection he is God he is the fire how many believe that today that's what he is without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh seen of angels received up into the glory he was God come to take the sinner's place yes sir and when he God raised him up on the third day was for our justification therefore exalted at the right hand of the Majesty on high he is an intercessor to make intercession for our weaknesses oh I'm so glad for that today as we confess it to him and die out to oursel placing his word back in us the promise and our faith makes that word live because Christ is in us to quickener to the word see you've got to believe amen you've got to believe and and maybe we'll get to a little bit tonight but we you know you repent with tears why because it means something to you you're sorry for your sins but your tears is not what get you in God don't recognize your tears because if he recognize your tears he'll recognize Judas he' recognize Esau but he doesn't just recognize your tears he recognizes your faith so with those tears you got to have another about you says I'm going to live right I'm going to do right I'm gon to believe God I'm gonna be a Christian I'm going to serve the Lord how many can say Amen to that today I'm going to do what God says so it's not just constantly repenting going over and over being saved again and being saved again and again and again but once you've repented once you've really repented you believe you're going to make it good brother brandom says says we confess it to him our faith makes that word live because Christ is in us the quickener to the word how I wish the church would see that oh all arguments and strife would be over that would be the Supreme Court oh church that's the North Star Hallelujah that's the end of all Strife that's the end of all questions that's the end of everything God said so that's the absolute tie yourself to it he is our absolute because we have the Assurance of the Resurrection because he has raised in us how do we know he lives he does exactly what he did here when he was on Earth he's the same Pillar of Fire he said we got the picture of there he's the same one in the church how much more proof do we need Church he's the same one in the church he's here today yeah he's here this morning amen amen he's here today think about if you knew you had him sitting beside you Jared what would that mean think about it think about it Melody if you knew the word Christ Jesus let's say come in a cor body and he sat down sat down over here and the girls would look at him more than they look at the boys you think he wouldn't have all the attention come on Church you think he wouldn't make an impression Jasper if you knew the word was sitting beside you and he was there and you saw him and those hands were scarred for me those stripes were for me would you not make an impression come on church what do you not make an impression is there not I wonder sometimes but by eyes of faith we see him and we see that the promise of the word was he's here you may not have seen him in a flesh body sitting beside you but he's here this morning young people he's here today that's why we don't run around the church and act crazy and and and and disrupt things why because we believe he's here the word is here right Among Us his word is so powerful the message of this hour is so powerful that that that it just can change things in a moment so we do everything we can to honor that word and reverence that word and preach that word and sing the word we don't do it for personality we don't do it because it makes us feel good or makes us or or gives us a status we do it because we're honor ing the word he's right here that same logos that Pillar of Fire that moved he said he's in the church you you'd react a certain way if you had Sol Corporal body what if the pillar of fire was visible this morning brother Bruce what if he come down in your seat and sat right there and just hovered there over you and I could sit there like brother brand did many times looking at other dimension and say he's hanging right beside you go back on deep call to the deep sister Prince I thought of this today and here this woman begins to scream out and he said that that light following a colored woman back in the corner he says it right there on the tape and he tells them where it is and they believed it and in places brother BR says you can't see it but you can feel it he said the presence of God that you feel the presence you feel right there here this morning brother Joe that presence is that same presence of God is just dwelling around you that same thing that you feel that is the pillar of Fire fire oh church we got to believe that if he's here today what would our impression of him be if he's here today in this body he performs acts exactly like he did then what would we do if we had a need what would we do we'd go to him we'd tell him Lord I need you amen we wouldn't we wouldn't shy away from where he was we wouldn't we wouldn't we wouldn't not humble ourselves we believe in who he is oh if we could only believe in the word in that manner we believe in who is he's the same yesterday today and forever when I come where the message of the hour is being preached and the people of God are gathered together I can receive as if he was here in the flesh Hallelujah he's the same Pillar of Fire we got the picture of here there he's the same one in the church he's here today and in this body Hallelujah he performs and acts exactly like he did then brother brand talked about a a designer of cars you remember the story there was a mechanic that he got a g General Motors I've told you the story before that was the first problem he was at GM if it was a Ford maybe they not had to call the the big wig but anyway he's a it's all right to laugh the I think the word is okay with that brother Brandon said he played like a child at the door of the Father the Bible says Jesus rejoiced in spirit it's okay brother B tells this story about the mechanic he couldn't figure out what was wrong with this GMC vehicle you know and he just trying and trying he say he's fixing this and fixing that putting this part taking this part off putting that part on he said a man come in in a suit and he walked in the building and and he looked at it and he said can I take a look at it he looked at me he said well what do you know you're in a suits you know you don't know nothing about mechanics he said yeah I do let me take a look at it he said he walked over there and he just touched one little thing and started running he said what in the world he said who are you he said I'm the [Music] designer I'm the one that made that vehicle I'm intimately acquainted with what could go wrong oh Church don't you realize God wasn't surprised when Adam fell he wasn't surprised when he fell he was intimately with how they were made he he knew you would make mistakes he knew he knew how you would fall and everything would go wrong but he also knew his plan for Redemption for your life he knew he said I'll not leave you or forsake you he said I I I'll I'll change you I'll make you new he's a designer brother brand said in this hour brother we wonder what's the matter with our Revival what's the matter we got the material and everything we got the mechanics where is the Dynamics and that's what we need to move Jesus Christ in on the scene what's the matter he said I tell you there's one here today Hallelujah called the Holy Ghost to can touch the Dynamics he is the Dynamics of the mechanics he told the story about the little girl was in the cave when there's a man here the kernal light that's the name of the sermon he tells that story and he said that they were in that Cavern and when they turned out the light it was total darkness it's hard now because you know what happens when you're in a cave we women won recently and they turned out the light and everybody turned their cell phones on but before cell phones it was complete and total darkness that's right and so and so there was a a little a little boy and his sister there and little sister began to scream and the little boy says don't worry little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light oh Church what was the prophet of God doing in our age he didn't have to turn on the light he was only telling us there's a man here who can turn on the light who's he speaking of the word hallelujah the word he was like John standing in the river Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world there's a man here who can change Darkness into light there's a man here this morning who can change your life into what it ought to be sir Amen brother brand said we stand today as Pentecostals the greatest Church in the nation thousands times thousands added each year but where is the Holy Ghost he said we accept it he said by speaking in tongues we seen how it's acted Methodist accept it by shouting Luther accepted by faith and so forth that isn't it he said it's the word it's the word turned on the light turned on the mechanics and they become Dynamics Church you realize what's happened in our day he the word came down and flipped the switch yes sir and the only thing holding back the Rapture is the time that's it everything else is here listen he said they become Dynamics they are dynamics I love this it's the word he said he turns on the mechanics and they become Dynamics they are dynamics when the Dynamics when the dynamic comes to the mechanic it starts the thing rolling I try take the word he said if there's one little thing missed up on it it won't start lay aside every weight every Isom every Creed amen that's the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit he said might flow through the word and vindicate the word that's promised to this day then the great Church of God will rise to her feet like a jet propelled plane take off to the skies to meet her master are we sufficiently impressed with one who can turn on the light come on Church what you say well I just think the word is just a dead letter you know we just need to move of the spirit we don't need the me preaching of the message anymore I beg to differ this word is alive and it's powerful it's it's here in its fullness Jesus was not a dead letter neither is this message huh you want you want Revival come back to the word you need healing believe the word you want to see a Rapture become one with the word do you long for manifestation keep the word pure brother BR said in every age we have exactly the same pattern that's why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught oh God I pray that I've been Faithfully taught I pray that I've been Faithfully taught again we we've got to say with the word we can't deviate one way from it and I've had people tell me why don't you just play tapes in church and if you want to do that that's fine but for me I I I I believe the word tells me to preach that's right so if the word tells me to preach I'm going to do it as long as I have breath in my body people can do whatever how church however they want to but I I want to preach because that's what a prophet told me to do he told me to say what he said that's all I can do he said but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken 1 Corinthians 14:37 they add here take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down that's that reference of the scripture that he quotes after that he said they add here take away there and soon the message is no longer pure the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise why we don't set up Bishops we don't set up anything else I'm responsible for the word brother Andrew Glover says I got my own books and I got my own tapes right and I can come preach to you without fear of what somebody else might say about it I'm glad of that church why because I have to stay with the word hallelujah Spirit only has one voice if he says something different from the word it's not the word no matter who it is Paul warned them to say what he said me as Peter did likewise he warned them even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given by Revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his Messengers and then say what he has been given them to say to the churches see that the letter kills let me just do with that for a moment I'm I'm going to keep you a few more minutes and then then we're going to go and eat okay just hang with me you said the the letter kth well you take that from 2 Corinthians 3:6 look what he said he's made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life it doesn't mean they rejected the Bible right they don't reject the Old Testament but what was the letter the letter was the law the law kills but Grace gives life the spirit gives life the letter is not the manifested word the letter is the law and it is true if you don't have the baptism of Holy Ghost if you don't have a spirit filled life then when you approach the message you can approach it it could be a dead letter that's right right because because you're not where you are supposed to be yourself but don't tell me it's a dead letter to a born again Christian right it's not it never can be why because the spirit in you anoints the word on the page Hallelujah Jesus was the life of the letter he was literally the word he said in the volume of the book it's written to me he's the word in their midst the Bible says that Jesus said it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they're not dead letter they're spirit and they are life he said many people just taking the letter the letter kill Spirit giveth life they take these Creeds and so forth still kth the Creeds kth but when you're taking the spirit that's God it's it himself how do you know it's God because he's taking the word and manifesting it he said then it's God himself oh my spoken word you see when he was born of a virgin in Isaiah 7:14 it was no longer a dead letter it was God man manifested Isaiah 7:14 circled the Earth for years and years and to many it was a dead letter but when it come to Mary it was not a dead letter it was a Living Word and when this message comes Church comes to the Bride of the hour it is not a dead letter it's a living Christ a Living Word are you sufficiently impressed with it I wonder as as the bride around the world are we sufficiently impressed with the word I trust that we are see he told John we got to a job to do he told John he said prophesy again remember Revelation 10:7 he talked about but in the days the voice of the Angel right when he should begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished but read verse eight The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth I went unto the angel and said un him give me the little book he said unto me take it and eat it up it'll make thy belly bitter it'll be in th mouth sweet as honey buty it'll be so good when you're receiving it it'll sound so good and then you go home and apply it start to digest it it gets a little bit bitter don't it verse 11 he said unto me thou must prophesy again why why why he had eaten the word listen he didn't come to John and say now John here I have the open book now go speak in tongues John huh is not what he said John go build a big church that's wonderful I pray one day we build a big church here you know as long as we got people to go in it we're not going to build a big church unless there's somebody to fill it right if all these kids grow up we might build a big church but he didn't tell John go build a big church he didn't tell him go build a hospital he didn't tell him go jump and dance what did he tell him take it John take the word now in that word there's dancing in that word there's shouting in that word there's music are you with me now it tells us to do that that's all the manifestation of that word but it's all a part of that word but eat the word eat the book he didn't say play fast music and dance John he said eat the book that's the focus of the hour that we're living in it's not the focus is not on the the product it's not on production value are you hearing me church I know these kids work very hard and very diligently to to put on or to uh to to produce a video that you could watch and when you're home not able to come they work diligently with that but that's not the focus of what we do the focus is not that the focus is not the the production of the music it's not the production of the sound what is it the focus is the word eat the book whatever else we do or don't do eat the book we have program we love our Sunday school teachers and our program I want to see a great Sunday School play they're going to do a Sunday School play I believe and it's just wonderful the things that we do the Fall Festival and all the things that we do and the fellowships but that's not what the focus is on the focus is the word we we can't have a fall festival every weekend but I can have somebody up here to preach to you the word every week are you with me now eat the word see when the focus of our ministry becomes the production of gifts or production of of a response we're no longer walking in the light of the hour the hour this the light of the hour is eat the book Hour the full word I know that's hard but I just church I want to see us grounded and settled sure about what we're shouting about brother BR said therefore no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it and the prophet and the scroll become part of each other now listen you say but and there's many preachers I know preachers pastors who will tell you that's the prophet see it's the prophet and the scroll become part of each other they don't read the next paragraph what does the next paragraph say and that's the believer yes amen that's the believer how many believers do we have he said when he receives the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is the word of God I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst today oh Church he's here how many believe that he's here is there darkness in our in our life the dynamic of the word is here to bring light is there chaos in a home the word is here to bring life to that eat it up be clothed with it become one with it it'll change you like it did the Earth at the beginning is the musicians come I don't have this on the sides I just just want to read it brother the B said oh just keep following after him how many want to do that today just keep following after him as Elisha followed Elijah let's follow him for we must be taken up too someday we've seen The Chariot of fire that's a powerful thing you hear what he said we have seen the Chariot of fire what's he going back to you remember Elijah Elisha followed Elijah Church we've seen the fire The Chariot of fire that's going to take us home Elijah and Elisha standing there and here comes a chariot of fire and and what did what did Elijah tell Elisha if you see me when I'm gone are you with me if you see me when I'm gone he said if you see me while I while I leave he said then you can have a double portion brother BR said we have seen the Chariot of fire that lifted him out of the Grave we feel it among us now someday Hallelujah he's going to unhook the horses from the bushes well that's deep isn't it we're going up so he said the pillar of Fire The Chariot of fire is here and we saw it he had his picture of church it don't mean anything to the people but it means something to us right he had his picture taken with him but West and then what happened we've seen it and here's the Chariot of fire the pillar of fire but it's just hooked up to some bushes and one day some morning some golden Daybreak we play only believe if we could play that this morning some golden Daybreak what's he going to do he's going to unhook the power the logos the anointing the fire from the bushes we're just going to go you waiting on this to happen or that to happen everything else listen everything could fall in place in minutes seconds you don't know what's going on right now you said well there's got to be a woman president well how many times have people waited on Election to fulfill that and brother brand in one place said it's the Catholic church but if you go back and even say well there has to be a little woman I believe there will be but Biden is not exactly a young man could happen tomorrow could happen today so well the Antichrist got to come and become incarnate how do you know how close how far that is or how close that is are you with me now just like that that's but all I know is Sister Fritz the thing that's holding back that resurrection of that Rapture is the pillar of fire is just hooked to the bushes Hallelujah and one day brother Harvey we're going to see our loved ones again why because you're just going to unhitch the power that we already have there'll be a great inflow of the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit say will that be a meeting it may not be it may be you standing at your at at the funeral home of the Joe it may be us standing at our jobs it might be you sitting on your chair by the JT and you're sitting there and then you you just start talking to people and here comes somebody you've known maybe a mom or dad or somebody that you've known and and you see them begin to walk in some of your children begin to walk in and you just start talking to them you don't think nothing about it and all of a sudden you begin to think oh what's this Sudden Change and all of a sudden he'll jump up oh I don't need a walker no more I I don't need my hands are crippled anymore church can it become real to us today all he's got to do is unhook the horse from the bushes we're going home oh Church let's just believe it with all of our hearts are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I say let us be impressed today let us become him let's not to get all wrapped up listen it's not good to get so wrapped up in problems and things going on you get stressed out by what's going on in your life what you can't control about your kids what you can't control about your family what about the church about something else you get all stressed out about it you don't realize the word is here we're going to make it not because of the pastor or the preachers or the or the movement or the mechanics of that that we've got we're going to we're going to make it because the pillar of fire Hallelujah is right here among us today the same yesterday today and forever I challenge you to believe it today
