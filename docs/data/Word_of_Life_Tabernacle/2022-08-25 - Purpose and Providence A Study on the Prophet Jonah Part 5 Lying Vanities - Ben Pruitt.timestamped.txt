[42:07] while you're turning there sister gene's
[42:09] memorial service will be at 3 o'clock on
[42:12] sunday
[42:13] so that's our regular service time so
[42:15] hopefully
[42:16] all of you can be there
[42:18] on sunday afternoon
[42:20] you say well maybe you didn't know her
[42:22] very well but she was a member of this
[42:24] church and a part of the body some of
[42:26] you went to church with her for a long
[42:28] time and
[42:30] and i'm sure you were good friends and i
[42:33] i counted her as a friend and
[42:35] and uh i believe that the lord took her
[42:37] home it was time
[42:39] for her to move on to a better body and
[42:42] so i'm thankful for that but we're uh
[42:44] sorrowful for those that have lost uh
[42:46] brother robert and and the family that
[42:49] have lost her i can't uh empathize with
[42:52] someone who's lost a mother because i
[42:54] still have mine but some of you know
[42:56] what they're going through right now and
[42:58] and so we we want to pray for them but
[43:00] memorial service will be three o'clock
[43:02] on sunday
[43:03] we're gonna have a dinner afterwards so
[43:05] like a potluck so if you could bring
[43:08] more than enough
[43:09] uh for you and your family and some of
[43:11] you ladies may want to get together on
[43:13] that but there will be some people here
[43:15] for the family there will be family it's
[43:17] a small family but there'll be some of
[43:19] them here and many friends i think and
[43:21] and so if you would
[43:23] bring some extra and just share that
[43:25] with them after the service we'd
[43:27] appreciate it now if you want to or need
[43:29] to have your meal in the fellowship hall
[43:31] in between
[43:33] that'll be fine
[43:34] but make sure you clean up after
[43:36] yourself if you do that could you do
[43:38] that i uh we're probably going to go out
[43:41] because i don't want to make my wife
[43:43] clean up after me twice on sunday in the
[43:45] fellowship hall it takes her a while
[43:47] sometimes we're here for quite a while
[43:49] on sunday nights cleaning up so if you
[43:51] could just uh just think about that on
[43:54] sunday maybe you'd like to go out and
[43:55] eat and then come back and have that
[43:57] meal with us after the service we want
[44:00] to celebrate the life of sister jean
[44:02] and uh and and
[44:04] welcome i'm sure she's uh she's been
[44:07] welcomed home already
[44:08] in that new body but we want to help
[44:11] that family as much as we can
[44:13] as well
[44:14] labor day weekend i want to have one
[44:16] service that weekend because i know some
[44:18] of you are going to be gone and you're
[44:20] going to be traveling so remember that
[44:22] labor day weekend we'll just have one
[44:24] one service and then that next day will
[44:27] be the holiday so you can get away
[44:29] wherever you're going jonah chapter 1
[44:31] and verse 17.
[44:33] are you ready for the word tonight it
[44:36] says now the lord had prepared a great
[44:38] fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was
[44:41] in the belly of the fish three days
[44:43] and three nights i pray the lord would
[44:45] add his blessing to the word you may be
[44:47] seated
[44:50] the word prepared in hebrew is appointed
[44:54] appointed
[44:55] god appointed a fish for jonah it tells
[44:59] us that the fish was not created on the
[45:01] spot
[45:02] but it was previously in the ocean
[45:05] and but god put it there
[45:08] so it wasn't as if it was uh did he just
[45:10] well created a fish he could have done
[45:11] that but he actually caused it to grow
[45:14] and and and to want to be in that area
[45:17] and and we don't understand sometimes
[45:19] how god works but that fish came about
[45:22] it came to that area
[45:24] to be jonah's the method of jonah's
[45:27] deliverance and yet jonah could have
[45:29] never dreamed that up he could have
[45:31] never imagined
[45:32] what it might have been what what might
[45:34] get him out of this situation as we said
[45:36] last week he just threw himself
[45:38] into the arms of god aren't you glad to
[45:41] have a god today that's big enough that
[45:43] you can you can throw yourself on his
[45:45] mercy you you can you can throw yourself
[45:48] on his grace and i'm so thankful of that
[45:51] tonight now
[45:52] and i'm trying to to hurry i've got a
[45:54] lot on my plate tonight but i'm not
[45:56] going to hold you
[45:57] so i just want to try to get through
[45:59] some of this now
[46:00] the nature of his deliverance was not a
[46:03] glorious thing
[46:05] and i want you to think about that
[46:07] tonight the nature of jonah's
[46:09] deliverance was not a glorious thing it
[46:12] was actually a very hard thing
[46:15] in fact it is a type of hell
[46:19] the fish's belly was so bad
[46:22] that it is a type of christ going and
[46:24] descending into hell
[46:26] and preaching to the souls in prison
[46:29] so the fish's belly was not a place that
[46:32] you'd want to go in you'd never pick
[46:34] that as the method of god's deliverance
[46:37] in your life
[46:39] i heard a story about a man
[46:41] who was dark one night and he was
[46:43] walking along a path and he fell off a
[46:45] cliff and he grabbed a hold of something
[46:47] he's hanging by one hand and as he's
[46:49] hanging there he
[46:50] he says help help can anyone help me
[46:54] and he hears a voice from above it says
[46:58] i am the lord
[47:00] i'll help you
[47:02] and the man says okay lord get me out of
[47:04] here
[47:06] he said okay if you want help let
[47:08] go
[47:10] the man thought about it for a minute
[47:12] and he says help
[47:13] help
[47:14] is there anyone else up there
[47:19] because sometimes we don't want what god
[47:21] wants
[47:22] we we don't like god's methods of
[47:24] delivering us
[47:26] but if you'll just trust him tonight
[47:28] any birth brother branham said is a mess
[47:30] any time you you come out of a trial you
[47:33] come through a struggle there's always
[47:35] going to be a whale's belly to go
[47:37] through but what are you doing while
[47:38] you're in there what's going on while
[47:40] you're in the wells valley we may think
[47:42] jonah was backslid we might we might
[47:44] look down on jonah a little bit for
[47:46] running from the presence of the lord
[47:48] but look what he did when he got inside
[47:50] the well's belly oh lord church that's
[47:53] the thing that we ought to look at
[47:55] tonight that's the thing we ought to
[47:57] examine in our own lives lord when i get
[47:59] into the belly of hell when i'm going
[48:02] through the darkest trial of my life
[48:04] what is it that i do during that time
[48:07] what what kind of what what is coming
[48:09] out of my life during that time
[48:12] the next few verses in jonah are
[48:15] remarkable
[48:17] jonah chapter 2 and verse 1
[48:19] then jonah prayed
[48:22] oh i love this
[48:24] jonah prayed
[48:26] unto the lord his god
[48:28] out of the fish's belly
[48:32] think about it
[48:34] again we want to call him backslid but
[48:36] he's praying
[48:37] out of a fish's belly
[48:40] he's going through hell
[48:42] excuse me for being blunt with it like
[48:44] that but that's that's what it was
[48:47] he is in the darkest deepest part of the
[48:50] ocean
[48:52] and the place that he's in
[48:54] was a whale's belly now if you've been
[48:56] fishing very many times you've cut open
[48:59] a fish you know that a fish's belly is
[49:02] not pleasant
[49:05] it smells bad
[49:07] it's nasty
[49:10] it's got everything the fish ate in the
[49:11] last three or four days
[49:14] still in the belly i've cut open fish
[49:16] and found other people's bait in the
[49:18] fish
[49:20] cut open i've cut open fish and found
[49:22] live fish
[49:24] inside a fish's belly
[49:26] that just hadn't died yet they swallowed
[49:28] them whole
[49:29] you find all kinds of things when you
[49:31] cut open a fish's belly now this was
[49:33] just a big fish
[49:35] you realize god didn't prepare or at
[49:37] least we're not told that he did a
[49:39] special sanitized fish's belly
[49:42] for jonah to be in that would just make
[49:45] everything just right and everything
[49:47] pristine and you know sometimes that's
[49:49] what we want god to do for us
[49:51] are you with me tonight we want god to
[49:53] prepare well we well when i come to die
[49:55] it's just going to be so peaceful and
[49:57] everything's going to be right it's not
[49:58] always going to be that way
[50:00] when i go through when i get married or
[50:02] when i have children everything's just
[50:04] going to be just right and they're all
[50:06] going to follow me along when i get
[50:07] married i know some some guys when they
[50:09] go to get married they think well when i
[50:11] have a wife she'll always say yes sir
[50:13] and she'll always have dinner on the
[50:15] table at the right time god don't do it
[50:17] that way all the time moses got a wife
[50:19] one time that had a temper
[50:22] and god gave her to him
[50:24] because moses had a temper they were fit
[50:27] for one another
[50:28] and god was working on moses
[50:31] are you with me tonight
[50:33] so sometimes it's not the way we would
[50:35] want it to be he said well i must have
[50:37] married the wrong one no you got exactly
[50:39] what god wanted you to have
[50:42] jonah thought well this is a mess what
[50:43] am i going to do well i might as well
[50:45] give up might as well let go might as
[50:47] well just just forget about everything
[50:49] no that's not what he said he began to
[50:51] look to the lord
[50:52] when he was in the worst moment of his
[50:54] life he cried out to god
[50:56] he said lord i'm not in church
[51:00] i'm not in a good place
[51:02] i'm not in a in a fancy uh altar
[51:06] somewhere i'm not i'm not in a in a
[51:08] temple with gold and all these things
[51:11] but i still believe that you're my god
[51:13] i still believe you're a deliverer
[51:16] oh can you be like jonah tonight and say
[51:18] that i may be going through a hard time
[51:20] in my life but i still believe that you
[51:23] are the lord god
[51:25] jonah prayed unto the lord his god
[51:28] out of the fish's belly
[51:30] and said i cried by reason of mine
[51:33] affliction unto the lord and he heard me
[51:36] out of the belly of hell cried i
[51:39] and thou heardest
[51:41] my voice
[51:43] for thou has cast me into the deep
[51:45] now think about this he's still in the
[51:47] wells belly
[51:49] he's still in the belly of the fish
[51:53] he said you you delivered me
[51:59] look past tense
[52:01] i cried and you heard my voice
[52:04] for thou had cast me into the deep and
[52:06] he's not saying this after he got
[52:08] vomited up
[52:10] right he's saying this while he's in the
[52:13] whale's belly
[52:15] and that's why again i think brother
[52:17] branham as he begins to look at this
[52:18] story he realizes that
[52:20] we're giving jonah too hard of a time
[52:23] because jonah was really he was really
[52:26] in a place where where he should have
[52:28] given up
[52:29] he was in a place where he should have
[52:31] just
[52:32] get turned his back on god and many of
[52:35] you have been in places like that but he
[52:37] didn't
[52:39] but you know what there was something
[52:40] else too
[52:42] god proved his power to jonah while he
[52:46] was in the whale's belly
[52:48] because he gets down there and there's
[52:50] there's fish vomit there's no other way
[52:52] to say it
[52:54] all around him he's being digested in
[52:57] the fluid
[53:00] there's dead fish and just they can
[53:02] swallow a man he's eating some some
[53:04] crazy stuff
[53:07] and so it's all around him and he's
[53:09] looking at her everywhere he looks at
[53:10] swells about him and as he begins to
[53:13] look around he's in that place and he
[53:15] realizes something
[53:17] i'm still alive
[53:22] i'm still living
[53:24] i'm in a whale's belly but i'm
[53:26] alive are you with me tonight
[53:29] forgive me i'm just a little bit i
[53:32] i've got this on my mind on my heart and
[53:34] i'm i'm thinking i'm being too forceful
[53:36] with it but it's
[53:37] you just can't you just can't imagine
[53:40] being in these kind of a circumstances
[53:42] but yet when you're in those kind of
[53:43] circumstances when you're in that wells
[53:46] belly when you're going through the
[53:47] hardest moment of your life and you look
[53:49] at us but i'm still living
[53:51] i still believe in god
[53:53] the devil hasn't talked me out of the
[53:55] message of the hour he can't talk oh god
[53:58] doesn't that give you confidence brother
[53:59] danny when you realize what you've been
[54:01] through and what's been in the past you
[54:03] can look back at it and say the devil
[54:04] couldn't get me 40 years ago he couldn't
[54:06] get me 20 years ago he couldn't get me
[54:08] two years ago and he hasn't got me today
[54:11] i'm still alive i may be going through
[54:13] some things right now but i'm still
[54:15] living
[54:17] and jonah says hey i'm alive
[54:20] i might as well cry out to god
[54:23] haven't died
[54:25] it was proof of god's supernatural power
[54:28] a god that could keep me alive and put
[54:30] me in a whale's belly listen to me
[54:32] church a god that could keep you through
[54:34] your trial that could keep you alive
[54:36] even in the moment when you're going
[54:37] through your worst trial can deliver you
[54:39] out of it
[54:41] amen
[54:43] out of the belly of hell cried thou
[54:44] heard us my voice thou hast cast me into
[54:46] the deep in the midst of the seas the
[54:48] floods compassed me about all thy
[54:50] billows and thy ways passed over me
[54:53] and i said i am cast out of thy sight
[54:56] yet
[54:57] i will look again toward thy holy temple
[55:01] the waters compass me about
[55:03] even to the soul
[55:06] the depth closed me round about
[55:09] the weeds were wrapped about my head
[55:13] this wasn't a pleasant place
[55:16] to be
[55:18] i went down to the bottoms of the
[55:19] mountains
[55:21] the earth with her bars was about me
[55:22] forever
[55:24] yet hostile brought up my life from
[55:26] corruption
[55:27] oh lord my god
[55:29] when my soul painted within me i
[55:32] remembered the lord and my prayer came
[55:34] in unto thee into thine holy temple
[55:37] they that observe lying vanities
[55:40] listen forsake their own
[55:43] mercy
[55:45] he said but i will sacrifice unto thee
[55:50] he's still in the well's belly
[55:56] well brother ben maybe he got out and
[55:57] then he's right in this later he's still
[55:59] in the wells belly
[56:01] you will you'll see that in the next
[56:02] verse
[56:04] but i will sacrifice unto thee with the
[56:06] voice
[56:07] of thanksgiving
[56:10] i don't feel like it but i'm going to go
[56:11] to church and i'm going to worship god
[56:15] i got seaweed wrapped around my head
[56:18] but i'm going to turn towards the temple
[56:23] and i'm going to ask god for forgiveness
[56:25] i'm going to ask him for mercy and i'm
[56:27] going to believe that he's done it and
[56:29] i'm going to believe that i'm already
[56:30] walking out
[56:32] well i wonder if we could look at our
[56:33] trials like that he said but brother ben
[56:35] you don't realize what i've been through
[56:37] brother random over and over again told
[56:38] us he said none of us have symptoms like
[56:41] jonah had
[56:42] none of us can say i was in a whale's
[56:45] belly at the bottom of the deepest
[56:47] darkest sea with no hope out and yet i
[56:49] cried out to god oh if jonah could do it
[56:52] doing that and those symptoms of prophet
[56:54] who would run from the presence of god
[56:56] yet he was god's man if jonah could cry
[56:58] out why couldn't we cry out tonight say
[57:01] lord i want to offer my voice of
[57:02] thanksgiving i want to i want to lift my
[57:04] hands in praise because i've been in the
[57:07] belly of hell i've been in that place
[57:09] and i come out alive and i know you
[57:11] brought me out
[57:13] amen
[57:15] amen
[57:17] i'm gonna have to stop
[57:20] are you with me tonight
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:26] i just love the scriptures don't you
[57:29] i will pay that i have vowed salvation
[57:32] is of the lord and the lord
[57:36] spaking to the fish
[57:38] amen
[57:41] if you start worshiping god in that
[57:43] situation that you're in
[57:46] if you'd let your attitude become an
[57:48] attitude of the word
[57:50] in that situation that you're in you'll
[57:53] find out the situation begins to change
[57:55] yes
[57:57] because god spoke to the fish and it
[57:59] vomited out jonah
[58:01] upon the dry land
[58:03] and there wasn't ever a man who had more
[58:05] victory
[58:09] can you imagine what kind of a service
[58:11] that jonah had when he walked out
[58:14] on dry land
[58:17] he said well i guess i better go to
[58:18] nineveh
[58:20] praise god he's taking seaweed off his
[58:23] neck
[58:24] wiping muck off his arms and the
[58:26] fisherman watching him as he walks up on
[58:28] the shore
[58:30] i serve a god
[58:32] who can bring me out of a fish's belly i
[58:35] serve a god who brought me out of the
[58:36] belly of hell i serve a god are you with
[58:39] me tonight can anyone testify that
[58:41] tonight i serve that same god tonight a
[58:44] god who brought me out of the belly of
[58:45] hell a god who brought me through the
[58:47] darkest moments listen to me you don't
[58:49] have to give up and give in and say well
[58:51] i just might as well give in and do what
[58:53] the world does if living for god hasn't
[58:55] helped me you don't have to do that you
[58:57] can be like jonah and say i'm not going
[58:59] to give in i'm not going to be like
[59:01] every other young person i'm not going
[59:03] to fall like every other person that
[59:04] fell but i'm going to live for god i'm
[59:06] going to do what's right
[59:09] why because i know my god is a deliverer
[59:11] i know my god will bring me out on dry
[59:14] land
[59:15] oh jonah had church when he come out
[59:19] hallelujah i believe we ought to have
[59:21] church tonight
[59:22] we've been through some things and we
[59:24] come out on the other side you say we
[59:26] have yes every one of you individually
[59:28] has been through some things you're a
[59:30] human being you go through fiery trials
[59:33] but yet you come out smelling like a
[59:35] rose
[59:36] maybe like seaweed too but
[59:40] mostly like a rose
[59:46] the prophet go anywhere and preach
[59:47] anything at that moment
[59:52] now
[59:55] i want to focus now on that wells belly
[59:57] because that's where many of us are at
[59:59] different times in our life
[1:00:02] but the brandon said anything a fish
[1:00:03] after it eats it goes right down to the
[1:00:05] bottom feed your little goldfish and
[1:00:06] watch what happened they go right down
[1:00:08] at the bottom of the little container
[1:00:09] you got them in rest are little swimmers
[1:00:11] on the bottom they're little bellies
[1:00:12] foals so they're down there resting
[1:00:15] so when this big fish swallowed jonah he
[1:00:17] must have went down to the bottom to
[1:00:19] rest out of the waves and out of the
[1:00:20] storm
[1:00:22] he was looking around through the
[1:00:23] revival
[1:00:24] to see what he could find and the
[1:00:26] revival on the sea you know swish it up
[1:00:28] and down the winds so we found this
[1:00:30] preacher and swallowed him and went down
[1:00:33] to the bottom he said now here jonah
[1:00:35] down there in the belly of this whale
[1:00:37] with his hands and feet tied laying in
[1:00:40] the vomit of the well
[1:00:42] he said now i've often heard people say
[1:00:44] i was prayed for last night my hand is
[1:00:46] no better it's still crippled i still
[1:00:48] have the stomach ache my eyes i don't
[1:00:50] see good yet oh my he said then holler
[1:00:53] at jonah
[1:00:55] he said if anybody had a case of
[1:00:56] symptoms he ought to have had it if he
[1:00:58] looked this way it was whale's belly
[1:01:00] that way was well's belly everywhere he
[1:01:02] looked with whale's belly and his hands
[1:01:04] was tied behind him he was in the whales
[1:01:06] belly in the bottom of the seat he said
[1:01:08] probably 40 fathoms deep in the bottom
[1:01:10] of the sea he said now talk about
[1:01:12] symptoms he said and then you call him
[1:01:14] backslid yeah
[1:01:16] he said he was laying there in the vomit
[1:01:17] in the whale's belly seaweeds around his
[1:01:19] neck and if he looked this away it was
[1:01:21] whale's belly he looked that way as well
[1:01:23] everywhere he looked to his whales
[1:01:24] brother you talk about a case of
[1:01:25] symptoms he might have had it but you
[1:01:27] know what he said he said they're lying
[1:01:29] vanities
[1:01:31] i'll not no more look at them
[1:01:34] but once more will i look to your holy
[1:01:36] temple
[1:01:37] all for a people that could be like that
[1:01:39] tonight you might have made mistakes you
[1:01:41] might have run from the presence of god
[1:01:43] at some point in your life but today
[1:01:45] you're saying i'm not looking at my
[1:01:47] symptoms i'm not looking at these lying
[1:01:49] vanities
[1:01:51] that lying vanities in the original is
[1:01:54] empty nothings
[1:01:56] worthless idols
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:01] it's idolatry
[1:02:03] to elevate your symptoms
[1:02:05] over the word of god
[1:02:10] think about it
[1:02:12] it is idolatry to elevate your symptoms
[1:02:17] over the word of god the word of god
[1:02:18] says i'm the god that heals all thy
[1:02:20] diseases
[1:02:22] then if we say well but i have cancer or
[1:02:25] i have named the disease coveted
[1:02:27] whatever it might be
[1:02:29] and and that
[1:02:31] covid
[1:02:32] i can't get rid of that that's not
[1:02:33] included cancer i can't get rid of that
[1:02:36] and what's happening is that we're
[1:02:38] actually
[1:02:39] we're actually taking the word
[1:02:42] of the symptom
[1:02:43] over the word of the bible
[1:02:46] and when we do that we are worshiping
[1:02:48] idols
[1:02:50] that's what this is empty nothings lying
[1:02:53] vanities
[1:02:54] so we actually begin to worship our
[1:02:57] symptoms
[1:03:00] well you thought that's going to be real
[1:03:01] good tonight didn't you
[1:03:05] we start to worship the symptoms
[1:03:08] by promoting them
[1:03:10] well brother ben i can't feel good in
[1:03:12] church i can't serve god i can't worship
[1:03:13] god because i have this going on what
[1:03:16] are we doing you know we would never
[1:03:18] fall down in front of a portrait of
[1:03:19] william brown and we know better than
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:21] and worship and lay on her face and
[1:03:23] worship in front of a man we would never
[1:03:25] do that
[1:03:26] i trust that you wouldn't
[1:03:28] if you would you're
[1:03:29] you're an idol worshiper we would never
[1:03:32] fall down in front of a portrait of
[1:03:33] william branham but you fall down in
[1:03:34] front of symptoms
[1:03:37] fall down in front of in front of things
[1:03:39] that are going on in your life well i
[1:03:40] can't go to church because i don't have
[1:03:42] no money i can't live for god because i
[1:03:44] don't have this side or the other we're
[1:03:46] worshiping that symptom over what god
[1:03:48] said what did god say god said i'll take
[1:03:51] care of you i'll love you i'll live for
[1:03:53] you oh but for the men you don't
[1:03:54] understand tonight i just can't worship
[1:03:57] god because tonight i'm i i just feel
[1:04:00] bad aren't you elevating your feelings
[1:04:02] over what god said when he said come
[1:04:04] into my house with a with a voice of
[1:04:06] praise
[1:04:08] praise me on the on the symbols praise
[1:04:10] me on the drum praised me with a
[1:04:11] stringed instrument isn't that what he
[1:04:13] said
[1:04:14] yes sir
[1:04:15] so we're committed committing just as
[1:04:17] much idolatry
[1:04:19] as a person would laying on the floor in
[1:04:21] front of a picture of a man
[1:04:24] when we elevate our symptoms over the
[1:04:26] word right
[1:04:29] perhaps he was thinking of psalms 31
[1:04:32] let's go back to the scriptures
[1:04:34] psalm 31 1 says in thee o lord do i put

[1:05:03] scriptures david doesn't know what he's
[1:05:05] talking about but jesus
[1:05:07] jesus has the reality of that on the
[1:05:09] cross
[1:05:11] he said thou has to redeem me
[1:05:13] oh lord god
[1:05:15] of truth
[1:05:17] notice what he says in verse 6 i have
[1:05:19] hated them
[1:05:20] that regard lying
[1:05:23] vanities
[1:05:24] but i trust in the lord
[1:05:28] i will not worship worship empty
[1:05:30] nothings
[1:05:34] are you hear me tonight i will not
[1:05:36] worship empty nothings
[1:05:39] i will not worship human beings
[1:05:41] other than jesus
[1:05:44] are you with me tonight i will not
[1:05:45] worship churches
[1:05:49] i will not worship a pastor
[1:05:52] i refuse to worship an idol of stone or
[1:05:55] one of wood one of gold he said i hated
[1:05:58] them that regard lying vanities
[1:06:00] but also refused to worship a symptom
[1:06:04] i refuse to worship what's going on
[1:06:06] that's wrong in my life until all my
[1:06:08] thoughts are on it and all my attention
[1:06:11] is on it and all of my
[1:06:13] all my days are spent worrying about it
[1:06:17] and i don't have time to worship god
[1:06:20] i don't have time to read the bible
[1:06:21] because all i can do is worry about
[1:06:23] what's coming down the week and what i
[1:06:25] have to do tomorrow some of you are
[1:06:27] there right now
[1:06:29] and trust me i've been there i got a lot
[1:06:31] going on this week too i'm thinking
[1:06:33] about what's going to be tomorrow and
[1:06:34] the next day and the next day and the
[1:06:36] next day and i've got my calendars
[1:06:38] filled up for months and i get to look
[1:06:39] at and think lord how will i have the
[1:06:41] strength to do it but he's the strength
[1:06:43] giver
[1:06:44] he knows what he's doing please say amen
[1:06:46] to that today
[1:06:47] he knows what he's doing he said i've
[1:06:49] hated them that regard lying vanities
[1:06:52] but i trust in the lord i will not
[1:06:54] worship my symptoms i will not give
[1:06:57] regard that's what that word regard is i
[1:07:00] will not give regard in other words i
[1:07:02] will not i will not i will not give them
[1:07:05] a do omniscience i will not i will not
[1:07:08] see to give regard to an idol is if
[1:07:10] there's an idol there an idol worshiper
[1:07:12] has to give regard to it
[1:07:15] right he's got to walk by and say oh
[1:07:17] that's an idol i need to bow down
[1:07:20] but a man who doesn't believe in idols
[1:07:22] it don't mean nothing to him
[1:07:25] he's not going to bow down to it because
[1:07:27] it's an empty nothing
[1:07:29] and that's why paul says whatever you
[1:07:30] buy in the market don't ask how they got
[1:07:32] it
[1:07:33] he said if it was offered to an idol the
[1:07:35] idol is nothing
[1:07:37] it's an empty nothing
[1:07:40] except if your conscience feels bad or
[1:07:42] or somebody asks you about it then just
[1:07:44] don't eat it
[1:07:45] don't don't don't begrudge your brother
[1:07:47] if he's got a weak conscience but it's
[1:07:49] an empty nothing
[1:07:50] and many times the empty nothings of our
[1:07:52] life have filled our filled our life
[1:07:55] with trouble and filled our life with
[1:07:57] worry and it's just nothing
[1:08:00] all right
[1:08:02] brother ben you don't how can you call
[1:08:04] my trial of nothing
[1:08:06] he said all things work together for
[1:08:08] good
[1:08:15] i'm not trying to be
[1:08:18] obtuse tonight i couldn't think of
[1:08:20] another word i'm sorry
[1:08:23] i know that's too much for you brother
[1:08:24] joel but i couldn't think of anything
[1:08:25] else
[1:08:27] i'm not trying to be forward
[1:08:29] or
[1:08:30] uh i'm not trying to
[1:08:33] to beat you up
[1:08:35] but i gotta
[1:08:36] get to the point in my own life
[1:08:39] i don't regard empty nothings
[1:08:42] don't you want to get to that point
[1:08:45] i don't regard empty nothings
[1:08:47] my wife is not my god
[1:08:50] your husband is not your god
[1:08:52] the church is not your god
[1:08:55] another preacher is not your god
[1:08:58] i could let them rule my day but i
[1:09:00] refuse to
[1:09:02] are you with me now i can let them run
[1:09:05] my life but i refuse to i know it's hard
[1:09:08] but i will not worship empty nothings
[1:09:10] yes
[1:09:12] i want to worship god
[1:09:15] i'll live the word
[1:09:16] but if i do you know if i if i live
[1:09:18] right if i do right this person will
[1:09:20] leave me this boyfriend or this
[1:09:21] girlfriend you'll be better off without
[1:09:23] them
[1:09:24] and stay with the word
[1:09:26] i will not worship my symptoms i'll give
[1:09:29] regard to i will not give regard to
[1:09:30] empty nothings
[1:09:32] look at look at romans chapter four
[1:09:35] i'm gonna i'm gonna go down because i'm
[1:09:37] i need some time here i need to buy some
[1:09:39] time so we're gonna
[1:09:40] skip down uh to romans 4 19. he said
[1:09:44] being not weak in faith speaking of
[1:09:45] abraham he considered not
[1:09:49] he considered not he passed by
[1:09:52] the empty nothing
[1:09:53] of his own body now dead
[1:09:56] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:09:58] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:10:01] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:10:04] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:10:06] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:10:08] persuaded that when he had prompted what
[1:10:10] he had promised he was able also to
[1:10:12] perform therefore it was imputed unto
[1:10:15] him for righteousness
[1:10:18] amen even when he made mistakes
[1:10:20] even when he lied even when he did those
[1:10:22] things but yet it was imputed to him for
[1:10:24] righteousness because he refused to bow
[1:10:27] down
[1:10:28] to
[1:10:28] nothing's
[1:10:30] listen jonah had to count himself dead
[1:10:32] when he was alive remember he had to put
[1:10:34] himself in the ocean he also had to
[1:10:36] count himself alive when he was dead
[1:10:41] think about it for a minute when he was
[1:10:43] in control of his life god caused the
[1:10:45] storm to come along so that he would no
[1:10:47] longer be in control of his life and so
[1:10:49] he falls into the into the hands of god
[1:10:53] counts his life he counts though he's
[1:10:54] alive he counts himself as dead
[1:10:58] and now he's alive
[1:11:00] or he's he's he's dead as far as we know
[1:11:02] now you think about it you ever heard of
[1:11:04] schrodinger's cat that that's the idea
[1:11:07] uh the philosopher that said that well
[1:11:09] there's a cat in a box it's sealed up
[1:11:12] and when it's in the box
[1:11:14] because you don't know there's no way of
[1:11:16] checking on it
[1:11:17] you know it's going to die if it stays
[1:11:19] in there
[1:11:20] so it's dead already
[1:11:22] and yet it's alive
[1:11:24] so his his thing his thought was i've
[1:11:26] lost some of you
[1:11:28] his thought was that the cat is both
[1:11:30] dead and alive in the box
[1:11:33] gabe you correct me later if that's
[1:11:34] wrong
[1:11:35] but i believe that was hysteri the cat
[1:11:37] is both dead in the life jonas dead and
[1:11:39] alive in the belly of the well
[1:11:41] he can't get out
[1:11:43] so he's dead and alive
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:47] right when he was alive he reckoned
[1:11:49] himself dead
[1:11:51] oh god when he was dead he reckoned
[1:11:53] himself alive
[1:11:55] god is sorry you might as well yeah
[1:12:00] and so now brother branson said we look
[1:12:02] at our symptoms shame on us
[1:12:05] when jonah under them circumstances
[1:12:06] could look away from his symptoms
[1:12:09] he said he refused to look at them he
[1:12:10] said they're lying vanities i'll look
[1:12:12] towards your temple
[1:12:13] oh god give us men and women with rugged
[1:12:15] faith and we'll not look to symptoms or
[1:12:17] look at anything the devil hands you can
[1:12:20] we say amen to that tonight hand it back
[1:12:22] to him
[1:12:24] say i believe in the resurrection of
[1:12:26] jesus christ
[1:12:27] i believe in his all-sufficient power
[1:12:29] how many believers do we have here
[1:12:31] tonight
[1:12:32] i believe that his presence is here now
[1:12:35] i'm not looking for it tomorrow i'm not
[1:12:37] looking for it some other time but i
[1:12:39] believe his presence is here now to set
[1:12:42] me free from any bondage that satan put
[1:12:44] upon me and i look where he sits at the
[1:12:46] right hand of god ever living to make
[1:12:48] intercession for me what are you looking
[1:12:50] at tonight when jonah is in the belly of
[1:12:52] the well he's not looking at the vomit
[1:12:54] he's not looking at the whale's belly
[1:12:56] but he's looking by faith towards the
[1:12:58] temple
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:01] he said you know you find so many people
[1:13:03] said you know you find so many people
[1:13:04] that rely upon symptoms well i was
[1:13:06] prayed for i got a crippled hand i was
[1:13:08] prayed for but i really believed god but
[1:13:09] my hand is no better it'll never be no
[1:13:11] better as long as you look at that hand
[1:13:14] he said see you're looking at the wrong
[1:13:15] thing you must look at his promise see
[1:13:18] we're watching our situation for signs
[1:13:20] of improvement and you're looking at the
[1:13:22] wrong thing
[1:13:25] brother ben i just don't see any sign of
[1:13:27] improvement so i'm just going to give up
[1:13:29] you looking at the wrong
[1:13:30] thing brother branham told the story
[1:13:33] about an old couple and i've got the
[1:13:35] quotes here but i i'll just tell it to
[1:13:37] save time but about the old couple that
[1:13:40] uh he had their son had diphtheria and
[1:13:42] brother branham has trouble getting in
[1:13:44] you remember he said they dressed him up
[1:13:45] like a member of the ku klux klan
[1:13:48] and some of these people by the way
[1:13:49] they're anti-william branham because he
[1:13:51] used that word of trying to tie him to
[1:13:53] the ku klux klan
[1:13:54] and he was just using the image of that
[1:13:56] that's what it looked like when he was
[1:13:57] dressed up to go in the hospital to pray
[1:13:58] for a dying boy
[1:14:00] but he had trouble getting in and they
[1:14:02] finally let him in
[1:14:03] and he said
[1:14:05] it had got into the heart and and was
[1:14:07] just beating so many times a minute and
[1:14:08] the instruments there proved that he
[1:14:09] couldn't recover
[1:14:11] you remember the story and he got an old
[1:14:14] father and mother there and brother
[1:14:16] branham said he said i got down beside
[1:14:18] the boy and i just prayed a common
[1:14:20] prayer
[1:14:22] oh my
[1:14:23] a common prayer
[1:14:25] and when he said amen he said the father
[1:14:27] and the mother hugged one another and
[1:14:29] they said and the father said oh mother
[1:14:31] isn't it wonderful
[1:14:32] thank you lord jesus for healing our boy
[1:14:35] the boy was just as bad as he ever was
[1:14:38] and they just wiped the tears from each
[1:14:40] other's eyes and just praise god he said
[1:14:42] and the nurse was standing there and she
[1:14:43] said i don't understand your religion
[1:14:46] she said how can you act like that and
[1:14:47] the mother of this child act like that
[1:14:49] that boy laying there dying he said the
[1:14:51] boy is not dying
[1:14:53] that wasn't brother branham was saying
[1:14:54] that he just standing there watching
[1:14:57] this is the man that the father of the
[1:14:58] child or the young man that was there
[1:15:01] and he said he's been she said well he's
[1:15:03] been in a coma three days and the
[1:15:04] machine shows that he can never come
[1:15:06] back again
[1:15:07] and the old father wiped his eyes and
[1:15:09] walked over put his hands on the young
[1:15:11] woman's shoulder and said child you're
[1:15:12] taught to look at that machine
[1:15:15] that's all you know about is watch that
[1:15:16] machine
[1:15:18] he said all the machine knows it's to
[1:15:19] tell what's going on here he said that's
[1:15:21] true you're looking at that machine but
[1:15:23] i'm looking at a promise that god made
[1:15:26] he said it depends on what you're
[1:15:27] looking at
[1:15:28] and he said today that boy is married
[1:15:30] and got two children
[1:15:32] see it just goes to show he said he laid
[1:15:34] like that another two or three days
[1:15:36] but he'd come right out and got well
[1:15:38] oh aren't you glad you don't have to
[1:15:40] look at the symptoms today he said see
[1:15:42] it just goes to show what you're looking
[1:15:43] at you've got to see what you're looking
[1:15:45] at he said don't look at your symptoms
[1:15:48] now remember this this was a miraculous
[1:15:51] thing he had to believe that he would be
[1:15:53] resurrected
[1:15:55] because you can't live in the belly of a
[1:15:57] well
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] right you just can't live like that
[1:16:02] but he had to believe he was it was a
[1:16:04] terminal condition that he had
[1:16:08] he went to the doctor and the doctor
[1:16:10] pulled up his chart and he said you're
[1:16:11] in a whale's belly you're going to die
[1:16:17] right you went to a preacher and the
[1:16:19] preacher looked at him and said you're
[1:16:20] in a whale's belly get out of here
[1:16:23] you're going to die
[1:16:24] you're in a wealth but nobody ever comes
[1:16:26] back from the whale's belly
[1:16:28] oh god
[1:16:30] no one ever come back from a whale's
[1:16:32] belly nobody was ever dead for three
[1:16:34] days and three nights in the bottom of
[1:16:36] the ocean nobody's ever been in the
[1:16:38] belly of hell and come out again but
[1:16:40] jonah was proof it could be done and
[1:16:42] jesus said a wicked and adulterous
[1:16:44] generation seeks after a sign but there
[1:16:46] won't be one given it except for the
[1:16:47] sign of the prophet jonah
[1:16:50] amen because the son of man will be in
[1:16:51] the belly of the earth for three days
[1:16:53] and three nights
[1:16:55] but he's coming up again
[1:16:57] and he believes the promise just like
[1:16:59] jonah did what did jesus believe brother
[1:17:01] madam said he had to believe his own
[1:17:02] word yes
[1:17:04] spoken by a backslidden preacher named
[1:17:07] david
[1:17:08] who stepped back there and said i'll not
[1:17:10] suffer my whole not leave my holy one
[1:17:12] and i'll leave my soul in hell and will
[1:17:14] not suffer my holy one to see corruption
[1:17:15] and we believe that one verse of
[1:17:17] scripture
[1:17:18] and come up
[1:17:20] oh my
[1:17:22] oh how many scriptures do we have to
[1:17:24] show that we're the bride that we're
[1:17:25] predestined of god that we are seated in
[1:17:28] heavenly places go read ephesians
[1:17:30] chapter one go read romans chapter four
[1:17:32] go encourage yourself in the word and
[1:17:34] then say lord i'm gonna believe this and
[1:17:36] not the echogram i'm gonna believe this
[1:17:38] and not the diabetes i'm gonna believe
[1:17:40] this and not what i'm going through at
[1:17:42] work
[1:17:46] i just i'm just preaching to myself too
[1:17:48] tonight
[1:17:52] we look at the promise like abraham
[1:17:53] jonah and jesus had that one thing in
[1:17:55] common i had to have faith for a
[1:17:57] resurrection
[1:17:59] so do we
[1:18:01] we lay our loved ones in in the ground
[1:18:04] you got to have faith in that moment for
[1:18:05] a resurrection
[1:18:09] i've never been so
[1:18:10] sure as when i bury a christian that
[1:18:13] i'll see a person again
[1:18:16] if i tell my brother my wife or somebody
[1:18:18] that i know that's reliable i tell them
[1:18:20] meet me at my house
[1:18:22] i'm not as sure that i'll see them
[1:18:24] as i am someone i'm laying in the grave
[1:18:26] that i know as a christian
[1:18:30] think about it because they might get in
[1:18:31] a wreck on the way
[1:18:33] they might have trouble they might end
[1:18:34] up in the hospital they might get to
[1:18:36] talking to somebody and forget but i
[1:18:38] serve a god that once that body is laid
[1:18:40] away
[1:18:41] and they go to that new body they can't
[1:18:43] help but come back
[1:18:46] are you with me now
[1:18:48] i'm more sure of that
[1:18:50] than i am that i'll be preaching here on
[1:18:51] sunday
[1:18:52] morning because we live in a world where
[1:18:55] anything could happen we don't know
[1:18:56] what'll happen next but i'm sure of one
[1:18:58] thing i'm going to see my loved ones
[1:19:00] again
[1:19:01] i believe in a resurrection that's what
[1:19:03] jonah had to believe in
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] jonah 2 4
[1:19:08] he said where did he look he said i'll
[1:19:10] look again toward thy holy temple i will
[1:19:11] look again in other words i will turn
[1:19:13] and look
[1:19:15] i'll turn away from the whale's belly
[1:19:16] somehow in the middle of the darkness
[1:19:18] and the vomit and the seaweed he
[1:19:20] remembered god's promise
[1:19:23] oh god
[1:19:25] what was that promise second chronicles
[1:19:26] chapter six
[1:19:29] i'm gonna skip some of this too because
[1:19:31] i'm almost out of time brother peter
[1:19:34] now look you can go read the whole
[1:19:35] chapter it's a wonderful chapter
[1:19:37] where he's dedicating solomon is
[1:19:39] dedicating the temple
[1:19:42] in in verse 21 he said hearken therefore
[1:19:44] unto the supplications of thy servant
[1:19:47] and of thy people israel which they
[1:19:49] shall make toward this place
[1:19:51] hear thou from thy dwelling place
[1:19:53] even from heaven and when thou hearest
[1:19:57] forgive yes
[1:20:00] if there be dearth in the land
[1:20:02] if there be pestilence if there'd be
[1:20:04] blasting the wind the east wind would
[1:20:06] come and just blast that country until
[1:20:08] it would it would take the
[1:20:10] the crops the fruit right off the trees
[1:20:12] and if there'd be blasting or mildew
[1:20:14] locusts or caterpillars
[1:20:16] if their enemies besiege them in the
[1:20:18] cities of their land whatsoever sore
[1:20:21] whatsoever sickness there be
[1:20:23] then what prayer or what supplication so
[1:20:25] ever
[1:20:26] shall be made of any man
[1:20:28] or of all thy people israel and everyone
[1:20:30] shall know his own sore and his own
[1:20:32] grief
[1:20:33] and shall spread forth his hands in this
[1:20:36] house
[1:20:37] then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling
[1:20:39] place
[1:20:40] i just love the way that's worded i
[1:20:42] believe the bible means what it says
[1:20:43] everyone has his own sore everyone has
[1:20:45] his own grief but when he'll spread his
[1:20:47] hands toward heaven
[1:20:49] he said i'll hear it i'll hear you
[1:20:52] amen he said then hear thou from heaven
[1:20:54] thy dwelling place and forgive
[1:20:57] and render unto every man according to
[1:20:59] unto all his ways whose heart thou
[1:21:01] knowest
[1:21:02] jonah knew god knew his heart
[1:21:05] people didn't think much of him right
[1:21:06] then because he ran from god's
[1:21:08] commission but god knew his heart
[1:21:11] oh god he said whose heart thou knowest
[1:21:13] for thou only knoweth the hearts of the
[1:21:15] children of men
[1:21:16] that they may fear thee to walk in thy
[1:21:18] ways so long as they live in the land
[1:21:20] which thou gave us unto our fathers
[1:21:23] if they sin against thee
[1:21:25] i think every one of us could look at
[1:21:26] this and we could say i've done that
[1:21:30] oh so i don't i don't commit any sin
[1:21:32] well i just make mistakes well that's
[1:21:33] true but you have
[1:21:36] you do things sometimes that the bible
[1:21:39] calls sin worry is one of them
[1:21:44] and we could go on from there
[1:21:46] oh god but the reason why it's just a
[1:21:49] mistake is because we have an advocate
[1:21:53] we have a blood that covers
[1:21:56] oh hallelujah we've been born again you
[1:21:58] don't see our mistakes
[1:22:00] but look he said if they sin against
[1:22:02] thee there is no man which sinneth not
[1:22:06] and thou be angry with them and deliver
[1:22:07] them over before their enemies and they
[1:22:09] carried them away captives into a land
[1:22:12] far off or near yet if they befake
[1:22:15] themselves
[1:22:16] if it comes to them in the land whether
[1:22:19] they are carried captive
[1:22:21] jonah is in the belly of a whale but the
[1:22:23] scripture still applied
[1:22:25] in the belly of the fish he's carried
[1:22:27] away captive he said and turn
[1:22:30] oh god well there's the key we forget to
[1:22:32] turn
[1:22:35] we forget the term brother branham said
[1:22:37] jonah turned
[1:22:39] towards the temple
[1:22:41] and turn and pray unto thee in the land
[1:22:43] of their captivity saying we have sinned
[1:22:46] we have done a myth have dealt wickedly
[1:22:48] if they return to thee with all their
[1:22:49] heart and with all their soul in the
[1:22:51] land of their captivity whether they
[1:22:52] have carried them captive and pray
[1:22:54] toward their land which thou gave us
[1:22:55] unto their fathers toward the city which
[1:22:57] thou has chosen toward the house which i
[1:22:59] have built for thy name
[1:23:01] then hear thou from the heavens even
[1:23:03] from that dwelling place their prayer
[1:23:05] and their supplications maintain their
[1:23:07] cause and forgive thy people which have
[1:23:09] sinned against thee
[1:23:12] you can go on and read the rest of that
[1:23:13] chapter but then in second chronicles 7
[1:23:15] 1 the next verse after that chapter he
[1:23:18] said now when solomon had made it into
[1:23:19] praying god began to prove what solomon
[1:23:22] was praying that he he would stand
[1:23:24] behind it how did he do it the fire came
[1:23:26] down from heaven and consumed the burnt
[1:23:28] offering and the sacrifices and the
[1:23:29] glory of the lord filled the house he
[1:23:32] saw him and said lord come and dwell in
[1:23:34] your temple and he came
[1:23:36] oh my and it was proof he would keep his
[1:23:39] word
[1:23:40] oh god
[1:23:42] brother brown said you know what he said
[1:23:43] he said there are lying vanities i won't
[1:23:46] believe them his symptoms what did he
[1:23:48] say once more well i looked to your holy
[1:23:50] temple
[1:23:51] turned over on his back
[1:23:54] and faced the best he could
[1:23:56] towards the temple
[1:23:58] don't give up because you don't know
[1:24:00] which way to turn
[1:24:04] jonah couldn't see
[1:24:06] the temple
[1:24:08] you know how bad your sense of direction
[1:24:10] would be if you were in complete
[1:24:12] darkness 40 fathoms deep hundreds of
[1:24:16] feet in the ocean in the belly of a
[1:24:18] whale
[1:24:22] your sense of direction is gone
[1:24:26] but jonah had enough faith
[1:24:29] to believe that the direction he was
[1:24:31] turning was the direction the temple was
[1:24:33] in
[1:24:35] and somehow it was
[1:24:38] listen to me you might have messed up
[1:24:40] you might have messed up this week
[1:24:42] you might have done something horribly
[1:24:44] bad you're afraid to tell anybody
[1:24:46] turn
[1:24:49] don't look at your symptoms
[1:24:51] don't look how you messed up turn
[1:24:54] i'm not going to do that no more i'm not
[1:24:56] going to think like that anymore turn
[1:25:00] turn repent that's what repentance is
[1:25:03] to turn from your evil ways
[1:25:05] he turned on his back and faced the best
[1:25:08] he could
[1:25:10] towards the temple when solomon
[1:25:12] dedicated that temple he prayed when the
[1:25:14] pillar of fire come in and went down
[1:25:16] behind the holiest of holy solomon
[1:25:17] prayed and said lord if your people be
[1:25:19] in trouble anywhere and look towards
[1:25:20] this holy place hear from heaven and he
[1:25:23] believed it
[1:25:25] and god did something
[1:25:27] he said i don't know what he done
[1:25:30] he might have put an oxygen tank in that
[1:25:32] whale's belly
[1:25:33] musicians go ahead and come my time's
[1:25:35] over
[1:25:36] he said i don't know what he done he
[1:25:38] kept him alive for three days and nights
[1:25:39] and delivered him at his course where he
[1:25:41] was supposed to go
[1:25:44] and jonah under those circumstances
[1:25:45] could believe in a prayer that was made
[1:25:47] by a man that later back said because of
[1:25:50] women as solomon believed on a temple
[1:25:52] that was built with the hands of men
[1:25:55] how much more are we tonight look to
[1:25:56] christ who is sitting at the right hand
[1:25:59] of god with his own blood making
[1:26:01] intercession upon our confession how we
[1:26:03] ought to believe it
[1:26:05] nothing no symptoms stand in the way i'm
[1:26:08] looking towards god's promise he said he
[1:26:10] would do it how many could say amen to
[1:26:12] that tonight amen can we stand together
[1:26:14] and just believe it amen i'm going to
[1:26:16] look towards your sin i'm not going to
[1:26:18] look towards the symptoms i'm going to
[1:26:19] look towards your word lord
[1:26:21] i'm going to look towards the word it
[1:26:22] reminded me
[1:26:23] of the third pole vision and i've
[1:26:25] preached it to you before but here come
[1:26:27] a woman in one side
[1:26:29] of the of that little room and when she
[1:26:30] come in she was crippled and she come
[1:26:32] out the other side well but the brown
[1:26:34] said she'd come out screaming at the top
[1:26:36] of her voice he said another woman asked
[1:26:38] her what happened she said i just don't
[1:26:40] know
[1:26:41] she said i couldn't tell you what
[1:26:43] happened she said i've been paralyzed
[1:26:45] for 20 years and i feel like i was never
[1:26:47] sick what happened we don't know what
[1:26:49] happened with jonah but somehow in the
[1:26:51] in the whale's belly somehow in amongst
[1:26:54] all the seaweed in the vomit
[1:26:56] he got a hold of god
[1:26:59] and god heard him
[1:27:01] and he spoke to the whale
[1:27:04] and it vomited him up
[1:27:07] into that revival
[1:27:09] the bible says he knows the way that i
[1:27:11] take
[1:27:13] when he hath tried me
[1:27:15] i shall come forth this gold
[1:27:17] get you by your heads with me tonight
[1:27:24] i did my best to keep it at 45 minutes
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:28] i just want you to take a little time
[1:27:29] now and reflect on your life and reflect
[1:27:32] on mine oh god
[1:27:35] oh god how we want to be in your will
[1:27:38] lord when we find ourselves in a whale's
[1:27:40] belly
[1:27:41] in the belly of the fish in the worst
[1:27:43] moment of our lives
[1:27:47] maybe you
[1:27:48] meant for us to be there
[1:27:50] when you have tried me lord i'll come
[1:27:52] forth as gold i won't look at my
[1:27:53] symptoms
[1:27:55] i'll look towards your promise
[1:27:57] you may be getting old but he promised a
[1:27:59] new body
[1:28:01] your kids may be acting in ways that you
[1:28:03] don't
[1:28:04] you just don't know how to
[1:28:06] get a hold of him you don't know what to
[1:28:08] say
[1:28:10] but he promised your children would be
[1:28:12] there
[1:28:14] look at the promise tonight
[1:28:17] don't look at the symptoms well i just
[1:28:19] can't worship
[1:28:20] i just can't
[1:28:21] for the men you don't understand i can't
[1:28:23] i can't do that
[1:28:24] don't look at the symptoms
[1:28:27] quit
[1:28:28] giving regard to empty nothings
[1:28:32] look at the temple
[1:28:34] the temple of god was at the right hand
[1:28:36] of god today making intercession
[1:28:40] for you and i
[1:28:41] if he could do that on a temple made of
[1:28:43] hands how much more could we do that
[1:28:46] with christ our redeemer
[1:28:48] hallelujah heavenly father
[1:28:51] oh we're so glad that you touched us god
[1:28:56] glad to be in your house tonight
[1:28:58] my heart rejoices nowhere we're sad lord
[1:29:01] that brother robert lost his mother
[1:29:04] and maybe there's other things that
[1:29:06] have caused us some some sadness in this
[1:29:09] day that we've gone through in this week
[1:29:12] but lord in this moment we're not
[1:29:14] looking at those things we will not
[1:29:16] regard empty nothings
[1:29:18] we're going to look at your temple lord
[1:29:21] we're going to look at your promise
[1:29:23] you promised
[1:29:25] lord that we could be there with our
[1:29:26] families

[1:29:29] for the journey
[1:29:31] you promised lord that that we would be
[1:29:33] a glorious church without spot or
[1:29:35] wrinkle if you promised it lord i
[1:29:37] believe that you're able to keep your
[1:29:39] word
[1:29:40] if you could keep the word of solomon an
[1:29:42] earthly king standing there in an
[1:29:44] earthly temple made of hands how much
[1:29:46] more would you keep the word of your own
[1:29:49] body that you created here on the earth

[1:29:53] of them will be lost
