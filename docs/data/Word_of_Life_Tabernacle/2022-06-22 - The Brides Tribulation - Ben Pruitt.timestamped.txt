[44:42] amen romans chapter five we'll go to
[44:44] romans chapter five and verse one
[44:53] romans chapter 5 and verse 1
[44:55] it feels good to be in church tonight
[44:59] it's hot outside but
[45:01] the spirit of the lord is here and
[45:03] it's nice and cool and
[45:05] we have
[45:07] a good building to be thankful for
[45:10] and we have
[45:12] a congregation to be thankful for i
[45:15] step up there sometimes and i have to
[45:17] think
[45:18] uh i'm grateful that i get to preach to
[45:21] you and
[45:22] i have to sit in there and i think lord
[45:24] i i don't deserve that but there must be
[45:27] a reason that god has allowed me to
[45:28] speak to you and so i pray the word
[45:30] would just speak to your heart tonight
[45:32] in a special way i
[45:34] think of all these what a responsibility
[45:36] that we have
[45:37] all these children the ones that sang so
[45:39] wonderfully tonight and young ladies
[45:42] growing up in a world that just wants to
[45:44] tear them apart and
[45:46] and just a broken world but yet we see
[45:49] them growing up and the fear and
[45:50] admission of the lord and their parents
[45:52] doing a good job and we're so thankful
[45:54] for that and pray that would continue
[45:56] and as they grow older you just think
[45:57] what a youth group you know one of these
[45:59] days and
[46:00] god don't do things overnight
[46:02] it's not a microwave it's enough and it
[46:05] takes a while to to get things done but
[46:07] we believe that our god is building
[46:09] something and if we go home tomorrow
[46:11] that'll be good but if he tarries for 20
[46:13] years that'll be good too because
[46:15] there's good things coming amen you
[46:18] believe that
[46:19] if we don't believe that we might as
[46:20] well just give up
[46:22] we're not going to give up
[46:24] we are not of those who go back paul
[46:26] says
[46:27] i feel like encouraging you tonight i i
[46:30] better get to my sermon i'm
[46:32] we're not of those who go back we're
[46:34] those who believe
[46:36] amen how many believers do we have here
[46:37] tonight
[46:39] amen
[46:41] romans 5 1 therefore being justified by
[46:43] faith we have peace with god through our
[46:45] lord jesus christ
[46:47] by whom also we have access by faith
[46:50] into this grace wherein we stand
[46:53] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[46:56] and not only so but we glory in
[46:58] tribulations also
[47:00] and i want you to notice that word
[47:02] tribulations we glory in tribulations
[47:04] also
[47:05] knowing that tribulation worketh
[47:07] patience
[47:09] and patience experience and that word
[47:12] experience in the original is final
[47:14] proof
[47:16] final proof i like that
[47:18] and experience hope
[47:21] or
[47:22] expectation and hope maketh not ashamed
[47:26] because the love of god is shed abroad
[47:28] in our hearts by the holy ghost
[47:31] which is given unto us i pray the lord
[47:33] with his blessing to the word you may be
[47:34] seated
[47:36] i'd like to speak to you tonight on
[47:39] the bride's tribulation
[47:42] the bride's tribulation
[47:45] and i know that
[47:48] let me get this out of the way
[47:51] at the beginning
[47:53] i know that all of you that are here and
[47:54] that are tuning in you if you've thought
[47:56] of the same thing well the bride don't
[47:58] go through tribulation you know
[48:00] well but the bible don't actually say
[48:01] that the bride don't go through the
[48:03] great
[48:05] yes right they don't go through when
[48:08] brother branham says the bride doesn't
[48:09] go through tribulation he's talking
[48:11] about the great tribulation
[48:13] the bride does have tribulations
[48:16] right and there is a difference and i
[48:18] want to talk to you about that tonight
[48:19] but the bride does not go
[48:21] through the great tribulation you say
[48:23] brother ben that the bride don't have go
[48:25] through great tribulation that's true
[48:27] and i thank god for that
[48:29] that we're called to escape that aren't
[48:30] you glad that you're called to escape
[48:32] that hour i don't want to go through it
[48:34] i don't want my kids to go through it i
[48:36] don't want the church to go through it i
[48:37] don't want anything to do with the
[48:39] events of the great tribulation
[48:41] want nothing to do with that and yet
[48:43] there is
[48:44] tribulation and i'm not talking
[48:46] necessarily about anything special to us
[48:49] because it's been going on since the
[48:51] very beginning of the church there is
[48:54] tribulation that comes to the believer
[48:57] and yet we don't experience that great
[48:59] tribulation and
[49:01] and we find it that that's shown in the
[49:03] parable of the ten virgins i don't have
[49:05] time to go into it tonight but the five
[49:07] that uh that that uh do not go in with
[49:11] with the groom when when he calls for
[49:13] them at the midnight cry the five that
[49:15] do not go in must be purged because they
[49:17] lack the oil to keep their lamps burning
[49:20] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[49:22] came and so they they were cast into
[49:24] outer darkness they could not see their
[49:26] day or their hour their lamps were not
[49:28] burning but ours are burning today our
[49:31] lamps are not dim they're not put out
[49:33] but we have the message of the hour and
[49:35] we have the holy spirit to anoint that
[49:37] word that we're ready when he comes
[49:39] aren't you glad for that tonight
[49:42] so i agree with you the bride does not
[49:44] go through the event known as the great
[49:47] tribulation
[49:48] but we do have tribulation in this life
[49:52] and that's why paul tells us in romans 5
[49:54] and 3 not only so but we glory in
[49:57] tribulations
[49:59] also now he's not just talking about a
[50:01] future people a church that'll come and
[50:04] and the bride's going to get off
[50:05] scot-free no the bride all through
[50:07] history has had tribulations
[50:11] knowing that tribulation worketh
[50:13] patience
[50:14] so he says this tribulation that we have
[50:16] we glory in it because it does something
[50:19] for us
[50:20] it gives us patience
[50:23] oh my and patience gives us experience
[50:25] which is final proof
[50:27] of what we're talking about so without
[50:29] the tribulation we could never be really
[50:31] sure who we are
[50:33] so that's why the bible says be thankful
[50:35] for your tribulation be thankful for the
[50:37] trials that you go through count it all
[50:39] joy he says he said it's more precious
[50:42] to you
[50:43] than gold
[50:44] and we look at that how could that
[50:45] possibly be because it's by the
[50:47] tribulation the experience
[50:50] of going through tribulation and coming
[50:52] out a believer
[50:55] oh god what tells us that job was who he
[50:58] said he was god even told satan and
[51:00] satan didn't even believe god you think
[51:02] satan's going to believe believe you
[51:05] you tell him well i'm a believer god
[51:07] told job that god job was a believer god
[51:10] told satan that job was a believer and
[51:12] he still didn't believe him
[51:13] but when he went through it
[51:15] and he said i came naked into the world
[51:18] i'll go naked out of it bless he said i
[51:21] i didn't receive anything from god but
[51:24] it was just a blessing to me he said i
[51:26] will not curse god
[51:28] oh aren't you glad you can be like that
[51:30] tonight
[51:31] i will not curse god though he slays me
[51:35] i'll trust him
[51:37] and that brought proof to us
[51:40] and that's the simple meaning of that
[51:41] and we'll go we're going to go much
[51:42] deeper into it tonight but the simple
[51:44] meaning is the tribulation in life
[51:46] produces the experience of having passed
[51:49] through the tribulation and i'm still
[51:51] standing i came to the fire i was not
[51:53] burned i didn't smell like smoke i come
[51:56] out of it on the other side of believer
[51:57] i went in a believer i come out a
[51:59] believer i came to the cancer i came
[52:01] through the high blood pressure i came
[52:03] through the split in the church i came
[52:05] through false teaching i came through
[52:06] everything else and i'm still a believer
[52:09] i still am one of god's i still stand
[52:12] for god i came through all these things
[52:14] and i i come through great tribulations
[52:16] in my own life not the great tribulation
[52:19] but great tribulation
[52:21] amen and i'm still a believer
[52:25] so experienced
[52:27] brings expectation
[52:29] if he did it for me once he'll do it for
[52:32] me again
[52:33] do you believe that tonight
[52:36] amen
[52:37] and so god allows you to go through
[52:39] these things for your own good for my
[52:40] own good
[52:42] so there's two related greek words in
[52:44] the new testament for tribulation
[52:47] and it's the level which is to crush or
[52:50] oppress
[52:51] to compress
[52:52] it's the idea of a crowd pressing
[52:54] together
[52:55] when related to the concept of suffering
[52:57] it refers to oppression or to affliction
[53:01] and it it functions in a metaphorical
[53:03] sense to denote being hard-pressed
[53:05] distressed harassed
[53:08] or troubled
[53:10] and then the next word is delipsis it's
[53:13] a very similar
[53:14] word from the same root word which means
[53:17] treble tribulation oppression
[53:20] trouble or affliction
[53:21] that causes pressure
[53:24] causes pressure
[53:26] when you say tribulation you could say
[53:29] pressure
[53:31] there's coming a time of a great
[53:32] pressure on the earth
[53:35] but even now there's pressure
[53:38] right just not to that extent
[53:41] but there's pressure now
[53:43] pressure and it's the idea of being
[53:45] hard-pressed to being distressed
[53:47] it denotes tribulation unique to the
[53:49] period prior to judgment so the same
[53:52] word is used same word paul uses here
[53:54] it's the same word it just uses the
[53:56] modifier great tribulation
[53:58] there's coming a time when there will be
[54:00] a tribulation we're going to miss
[54:02] right he won't tempt you more than
[54:04] you're able
[54:05] he won't put his bride through that time
[54:08] i'm so thankful that he cares for us
[54:11] and he loves us but yet so we'll miss
[54:13] that time but we do have tribulations
[54:16] and all they do is just prove to us who
[54:18] we are
[54:19] so now
[54:20] the term can also describe troubles in
[54:22] everyday life jesus uses the word in
[54:24] matthew 13.
[54:26] matthew 13 and 20 he speaks of the
[54:29] different types of ground that the seed
[54:31] fell in the word fell in he said he that
[54:34] receiveth the seed into stony places
[54:37] and what that means is as i've studied
[54:39] on that before
[54:40] is it's not so much rocks that you see
[54:43] but it's a thin
[54:45] a film of dirt if you could say it like
[54:47] that about an inch of dirt that looks
[54:49] good
[54:50] but when you throw the seed on it it can
[54:52] only go down a little ways and it hits
[54:55] the rock
[54:56] so he he throws the seed down and it and
[54:59] it it takes a little bit of root but
[55:01] only only so far because the rock's
[55:03] there
[55:04] so it can't go deep yeah
[55:07] right and he said the same is he that
[55:08] heareth the word
[55:10] and with joy receiveth it
[55:13] yet hath he not root in himself
[55:16] see that's where your root has to be if
[55:18] you're going to make it through
[55:19] tribulation
[55:20] there's got to be
[55:22] a root and i'm talking again just so you
[55:24] don't don't think i'm preaching false
[55:26] doctrine not talking about the great
[55:28] tribulation i'm talking about what you
[55:29] went through today
[55:31] what you'll go through tomorrow
[55:33] what you'll go through next week you go
[55:35] through tribulation
[55:37] right if you've been a christian very
[55:38] long you know what i'm talking about
[55:40] you go through tribulation you feel like
[55:42] you're surrounded by trouble surrounded
[55:44] by trials every one of us have been
[55:45] there
[55:47] and he said but this the seed this this
[55:49] word that was cast into the earth the
[55:51] earth it wasn't good earth and so it had
[55:54] a rock under it and so it could not take
[55:57] root but it lasted a little while but
[55:59] when tribulation or persecution arises
[56:02] because of the word
[56:05] by and by he is offended
[56:08] you'll see them come to church for a
[56:09] while until they start saying did you
[56:11] know you go to a cult
[56:14] you look better if you start to cut that
[56:16] hair
[56:18] right that's what happens he after a
[56:20] while he's offended that's why you see
[56:21] him come for a while but there's nothing
[56:23] but thank god there's something in us he
[56:26] prepared good soil there's a seed inside
[56:28] of it something that can take root
[56:31] that can go down and and won't be
[56:33] affected by tribulation right
[56:36] it's the idea of being in a crowd of
[56:38] enemies
[56:39] you ever felt like you were in a crowd
[56:40] of enemies yeah
[56:42] surrounded by difficulties
[56:46] afflicted on every side
[56:48] here's another word you could use for it
[56:50] and you'll see where i'm going after a
[56:51] little bit squeezed
[56:53] yeah
[56:54] sure yes sir
[56:56] squeeze that's what the word is squeezed
[56:58] surrounded compressed
[57:01] squeezed by trouble
[57:03] squeezed by persecution
[57:06] oh you better have root in this hour
[57:09] you better have root you better know
[57:10] what you believe you better have the
[57:12] holy ghost
[57:13] because if you don't you'll pretty soon
[57:16] you're going to be offended
[57:18] that's it's tribulation is to be
[57:20] squeezed you know but that's nothing new
[57:24] righteous men have always stood in a
[57:26] crowd of enemies
[57:28] that's nothing new
[57:30] in hebrews 11 37 it speaks of the heb
[57:33] the heroes of faith it says they were
[57:35] stoned
[57:36] they were sown asunder
[57:38] we're tempted we're slain with the sword
[57:41] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[57:43] goat skins
[57:45] destitute afflicted tormented that word
[57:48] afflicted is the same word tribulation
[57:51] they went through
[57:52] tribulation they had tribulations
[57:56] they were afflicted tormented
[57:58] of whom the world was not worthy
[58:01] they wandered in deserts and in
[58:03] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[58:06] earth
[58:07] and we look at what they went through
[58:08] and we wonder will we escape the
[58:11] pressing
[58:12] now think about it will we escape the
[58:15] pressing
[58:16] yes we escape the great tribulation but
[58:18] are we going to escape what every hero
[58:20] of faith went through i say we won't
[58:23] but there's pressure unique to our hour
[58:27] and so when i'm talking about the
[58:28] bride's tribulation i'm talking about
[58:30] that unique pressure
[58:32] are you with me tonight
[58:34] that comes in our hour
[58:36] to try to make you disbelieve the word
[58:39] to try to take away the effect of the
[58:41] word out of your life that unique
[58:43] pressure that comes to you but it's the
[58:45] pressure itself that reveals to you who
[58:48] you are because you made it some of you
[58:51] were alive in 1977
[58:53] when the word become a pressure to you
[58:56] because you said well i believe
[58:57] everything a prophet taught and then you
[58:58] looked at that and you didn't catch
[59:00] maybe or maybe you did but some didn't
[59:02] catch that he that he said that it was a
[59:04] prediction and
[59:06] and that he was just uh he couldn't see
[59:08] beyond 1977. some people didn't catch
[59:10] that
[59:11] yeah and so they went back there and and
[59:13] they said well i believe what the
[59:14] prophet said and it will become a
[59:16] persecution
[59:18] it become a pressure
[59:20] but some of you made it through that
[59:23] and after a while you begin to say i
[59:24] really do believe the message
[59:27] you know it would have been easy to walk
[59:28] away
[59:30] some of you lost spouses
[59:32] i know what i'm talking about tonight
[59:35] talk to some of the older people some of
[59:36] you some of you i lost churches
[59:40] lost family members
[59:42] i'm not i'm talking about people that
[59:44] left because of the word
[59:46] some of you lost a lot of friends
[59:49] some of you have been through some
[59:51] things
[59:53] you you had a pressure but what happened
[59:55] in the end when you come out of it
[59:56] brother david you come out the other
[59:58] side and you say hey i wouldn't have
[59:59] made it through that
[1:00:03] if i wasn't a seed of god
[1:00:07] if there wasn't some roots for the paul
[1:00:09] i would not have made it through what i
[1:00:12] made it through oh i survived difficulty
[1:00:15] in marriage i've survived difficulty at
[1:00:17] my job i've survived difficulty in the
[1:00:19] church i've survived difficulty in
[1:00:21] preaching come on you all can make that
[1:00:23] that tonight that same declaration i
[1:00:25] know who i am
[1:00:27] i'm not saying that out of arrogance i'm
[1:00:29] saying it because i went through the
[1:00:31] pressure and i come out the other side
[1:00:33] and the pressure revealed what metal was
[1:00:35] on the inside it wasn't dross it wasn't
[1:00:37] just fool's gold but it was real gold
[1:00:40] the pressure revealed that yes
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:45] the tribulation worked patience
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] the patient's experience and the
[1:00:51] experience expectation
[1:00:54] and so we say well we we won't have to
[1:00:57] put up with that not our age we're
[1:00:58] predestined well they were too
[1:01:03] they were too
[1:01:05] they still had the pressing
[1:01:07] to go
[1:01:09] and the scripture says this in hebrews
[1:01:11] 12 and 1 right after that heroes of
[1:01:13] faith chapter
[1:01:15] says wherefore
[1:01:17] seeing we also we also
[1:01:20] are compassed about
[1:01:22] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:01:25] all that are telling us i made it
[1:01:27] by the grace of god i made it
[1:01:30] i was one of those ones who lived in the
[1:01:32] dens and the caves of the earth but i
[1:01:34] made it
[1:01:35] i think about brother branham said that
[1:01:36] there was some that come to the nicean
[1:01:38] council he said them prophets come out
[1:01:39] of the wilderness with sheepskin and
[1:01:41] goat skin on them he said they come out
[1:01:43] of the wilderness and they threw him out
[1:01:44] of the nicene council but they come
[1:01:46] there and stood against that thing they
[1:01:48] were persecuted and run out of the
[1:01:50] church and everything else but they
[1:01:51] believed and they they'll see them one
[1:01:54] day
[1:01:55] and that's that great cloud of witnesses
[1:01:57] that says i was there i know what
[1:01:59] pressure's like right i know what it's
[1:02:01] like to be in the ox age i know what
[1:02:02] it's like to be in a man
[1:02:04] the mind age i know what it's like to
[1:02:06] have pressure
[1:02:07] but i stood anyway
[1:02:09] and i know i couldn't have done that by
[1:02:11] myself
[1:02:13] so it produced a an experience and
[1:02:15] produced a
[1:02:16] faith in my life that i am who i said i
[1:02:19] am
[1:02:21] it's one thing to say it is another
[1:02:22] thing to look back and say hey yeah
[1:02:24] that's me
[1:02:27] hallelujah
[1:02:29] and so he says we're surrounded by this
[1:02:31] great cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:02:33] aside every weight
[1:02:35] so he said if we are surrounded by such
[1:02:37] a great cloud of witnesses let's do like
[1:02:38] they did let's get ready for the race
[1:02:41] let's let's get ready for the pressure
[1:02:42] of the race let's let's get ready for
[1:02:44] that event he said the sin which just so
[1:02:47] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:02:49] patience the race that is set before us
[1:02:51] how will we have patience
[1:02:54] to run right yeah well he's already told
[1:02:56] you
[1:02:58] by tribulations
[1:03:02] your brother ben i don't like that
[1:03:05] no one ever has
[1:03:11] if you go to do something for god the
[1:03:12] devil's going to stand up and and oppose
[1:03:14] you
[1:03:17] a hundred times out of a hundred
[1:03:20] everything you do i've noticed this in
[1:03:21] mitch doing missions work that we've
[1:03:23] done the little bit that i've done
[1:03:24] overseas i've noticed every time there's
[1:03:27] opposition
[1:03:28] not half the time every time
[1:03:31] there's extreme opposition but it's like
[1:03:34] during that opposition you'll get little
[1:03:36] handfuls of of bright spots that you can
[1:03:39] look at and say hey he wants me to go
[1:03:42] that's the way your life is isn't it
[1:03:44] you get little handfuls little bright
[1:03:46] spots or maybe a sermon on a wednesday
[1:03:48] night or a song someone sings or a tape
[1:03:50] that you listen to or something will
[1:03:52] happen and somebody will say something
[1:03:53] to you this little bright spot that said
[1:03:55] hey you're gonna make it
[1:03:57] it's gonna be okay
[1:03:59] even though you're the darkest part of
[1:04:00] your life but it's just working patience
[1:04:03] it's working patience tribulation
[1:04:04] produces patience it does not
[1:04:06] tribulation does not produce patience
[1:04:08] and though in the non-elect
[1:04:11] right it doesn't produce patience the
[1:04:13] great tribulation will not produce
[1:04:15] patience
[1:04:18] because there won't be any elect there
[1:04:20] to receive it
[1:04:22] but our tribulation produces patience
[1:04:25] the bible says during the tribulation
[1:04:27] period that they'll call for the stones
[1:04:29] and the rocks to fall on them and i say
[1:04:31] hide us from the wrath of the lamb
[1:04:34] it also says that they
[1:04:36] they will curse god and say that they
[1:04:38] and refuse to repent
[1:04:41] even though they know god's doing it
[1:04:44] tribulation produces patience but not in
[1:04:47] the non-elect
[1:04:49] jesus taught his disciples they would
[1:04:50] have tribulation in john chapter 16 and
[1:04:52] verse 33 he said these things have
[1:04:54] spoken unto you
[1:04:56] in me you might have peace
[1:04:58] in the world i love how he says that in
[1:05:00] me you might have peace
[1:05:02] so many times we don't have peace
[1:05:03] because we're looking at the wrong
[1:05:04] things
[1:05:05] but he said in me you might have peace
[1:05:08] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:05:10] it's the same word tribulation pressure
[1:05:13] but be of good cheer
[1:05:16] i have overcome the world
[1:05:19] he was under the greatest pressure you
[1:05:20] talk about tribulation he stood under
[1:05:23] the greatest pressure that had ever been
[1:05:24] there at golgotha he knew what he was
[1:05:26] talking about when he was there on the
[1:05:29] mount of olives he knew at gethsemane
[1:05:31] what he was talking about but he said i
[1:05:33] have overcome the world be of good cheer
[1:05:37] i have overcome the world
[1:05:39] amen and even he had to learn by the
[1:05:41] things he suffered what was it patience
[1:05:44] with god
[1:05:45] if it be so let this cup pass from me
[1:05:48] but nevertheless not my will but thine
[1:05:50] be done yes
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] now
[1:05:55] the apostles taught this as well i just
[1:05:57] want to show you there's nothing new
[1:06:00] before we move on
[1:06:01] the apostles taught this in acts chapter
[1:06:03] 14 and verse 21 that when they had
[1:06:05] preached the gospel to that city and the
[1:06:07] top many they returned again to lystra
[1:06:09] to iconium and antioch confirming the
[1:06:12] souls of the disciples and exhorting
[1:06:14] them to continue in the faith that's
[1:06:16] what i'm doing tonight exhorting you to
[1:06:18] continue in the faith that we must go
[1:06:20] through
[1:06:22] listen what they were telling them
[1:06:24] they weren't sitting there patting them
[1:06:26] on the back and saying oh my you guys
[1:06:28] are so wonderful and we're just gonna
[1:06:29] make it so easy for you they said no
[1:06:32] they said listen you're going to have
[1:06:33] tribulation
[1:06:35] you're new believers but one day you're
[1:06:36] going to look back and realize there was
[1:06:38] much tribulation
[1:06:40] he said you're going to have to go
[1:06:41] through much tribulation we must through
[1:06:44] much tribulation enter into the kingdom
[1:06:46] of god that's the only way in
[1:06:49] there's one door into the kingdom of god
[1:06:51] and the only way into it is through much
[1:06:53] tribulation so if that's the only way in
[1:06:56] amen let me go ahead
[1:06:59] oh my let me take that city let me go
[1:07:02] into the door if that's where the door
[1:07:03] is and there's much tribulation let me
[1:07:05] go through the door but remember it's
[1:07:07] pressure and the story i believe it's
[1:07:09] pilgrim's progress that that told the
[1:07:11] story about the lion that was there at
[1:07:13] the gate but it was chained
[1:07:15] and timid and fearful ran away
[1:07:18] but christian realized that the lion
[1:07:20] could only go so far
[1:07:22] he could not come to the middle of the
[1:07:24] road
[1:07:26] oh my the lion cannot come to the middle
[1:07:29] of the road stay in the middle of the
[1:07:30] road with god and the lion can't get you
[1:07:33] but it'll sure enough pressure you
[1:07:36] it'll scare you
[1:07:38] it'll roar at you
[1:07:40] but it can't take you
[1:07:43] oh my
[1:07:44] that's the door i want to find we must
[1:07:46] through much tribulation enter into the
[1:07:48] kingdom of god
[1:07:50] paul taught it to his people first
[1:07:51] thessalonians 3 and 1.
[1:07:54] he said wherefore when we could no
[1:07:55] longer forebear
[1:07:57] we thought it good to be left at athens
[1:07:59] alone
[1:08:00] and timotheus our brother and minister
[1:08:02] of god our fellow laborer in the gospel
[1:08:04] of christ to establish you notice he
[1:08:06] didn't just send his letters to
[1:08:08] establish the people but he sent his
[1:08:10] fellow laborer
[1:08:12] in the gospel of christ to establish you
[1:08:15] and to comfort you concerning your faith
[1:08:18] that no man should be moved
[1:08:21] by these
[1:08:22] tribulations it's the same word
[1:08:24] afflictions
[1:08:26] tribulations
[1:08:28] for yourselves know that we are
[1:08:29] appointed
[1:08:31] there unto
[1:08:33] we weren't kidding when we told you
[1:08:36] that the way to the kingdom
[1:08:38] was by much tribulation
[1:08:41] but aren't you glad you went
[1:08:44] anyway
[1:08:46] aren't you glad you're where you're at
[1:08:48] you know there will still be tribulation
[1:08:49] as long as you're on the earth but i
[1:08:51] think some of us older people could look
[1:08:53] at these young people and say hey you're
[1:08:54] going to go through much tribulation but
[1:08:56] you'll be much better off if you'll stay
[1:08:58] in the middle of the road if you'll stay
[1:09:00] where i'm at amen because i can look at
[1:09:02] my own life and i can see that i'm much
[1:09:05] better off than i would have been had i
[1:09:06] cut cut
[1:09:08] and run if i'd just run away i would
[1:09:10] have been in much worse shape but today
[1:09:12] i'm living for jesus and i'm nearing the
[1:09:14] kingdom amen and you can say if you'll
[1:09:16] do if you'll act like that i didn't do
[1:09:18] everything perfect but i stayed with the
[1:09:20] word and when i stayed with the word he
[1:09:22] backed me up
[1:09:24] right hallelujah
[1:09:26] i don't think it's strange when there's
[1:09:27] tribulation i remember i've told you
[1:09:29] this before but i remember when we
[1:09:32] we left west plains and we went to
[1:09:34] gibson and
[1:09:36] we were there for 10 years because i
[1:09:38] felt like i needed that seasoning
[1:09:40] and
[1:09:41] while we were there when we first got
[1:09:43] there an older gentleman told me he said
[1:09:46] it's kind of a
[1:09:48] brother's passed away now he's he's a
[1:09:50] good brother wonderful brother but he
[1:09:51] just had kind of a way about him
[1:09:53] kind of uh curmudgeon
[1:09:55] and uh he told me
[1:09:56] i said well he said how things have been
[1:09:58] going i said well it's been difficult we
[1:10:00] had trouble getting rid of our home and
[1:10:02] we moved and cut our income was cut in
[1:10:04] half and
[1:10:05] we had to we had to suffer during that
[1:10:07] time we lived in an apartment for a
[1:10:09] while but we wanted to be
[1:10:11] there i felt like that's what god told
[1:10:12] me to do and it was nothing against the
[1:10:14] church that i was in but it was just a i
[1:10:16] felt it was a necessity and this proved
[1:10:18] out to be true
[1:10:20] but but you know it was we wouldn't be
[1:10:22] where we're at today without it but the
[1:10:23] man told me he said well he said if the
[1:10:25] lord was was in it he said it'd be easy
[1:10:31] hey man
[1:10:32] i want to say man you're 80 years old
[1:10:34] you should know better than that
[1:10:37] if the lord was in it it'd be easy no i
[1:10:40] i don't think so
[1:10:42] many times what the lord's in it's
[1:10:44] harder
[1:10:45] what do you what did he tell uh what did
[1:10:47] he tell paul or brother branham he said
[1:10:49] because you've chosen the harder way
[1:10:52] amen you've chosen the more difficult
[1:10:54] path and the more difficult path is
[1:10:56] always to stay with the word right
[1:10:58] yes
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:01] so now
[1:11:02] he says
[1:11:03] he says i want you to know that we're
[1:11:05] appointed to these afflictions these
[1:11:06] tribulations for verily when we were
[1:11:08] with you we told you before
[1:11:10] that we should suffer tribulation
[1:11:14] even as it came to pass yes
[1:11:16] and you know
[1:11:18] so now you begin to experience it hold
[1:11:20] on yeah
[1:11:22] sent timothy down there to tell him hold
[1:11:24] on
[1:11:25] it's all right to preach an encouraging
[1:11:26] message every now and then you're going
[1:11:28] to make it yeah
[1:11:29] why because there's something in you
[1:11:31] you're made of the stuff that don't
[1:11:33] bluff you're made of something that can
[1:11:34] make it yes hold on timothy told the
[1:11:37] people you're going to suffer
[1:11:39] tribulation and we told you that and it
[1:11:40] happened but keep holding on god's going
[1:11:43] to bless you
[1:11:45] and the writer isaac watched years ago
[1:11:47] wrote the song brother branham quote
[1:11:49] said over and over and over again in the
[1:11:50] message he said am i a soldier of the
[1:11:52] cross the follower of the lamb and shall
[1:11:54] i fear to own his cause or blessed to
[1:11:56] speak his name
[1:11:58] must not be carried to the skies on
[1:12:00] flowery beds of ease while others fought
[1:12:02] to win the price and sailed through
[1:12:04] bloody seas wouldn't that look odd
[1:12:06] if we made it with no pressure
[1:12:09] and they went through what they went
[1:12:10] through and we just sailed in and said
[1:12:12] well thank you all we made you made it
[1:12:14] easy for us
[1:12:16] you realize it's going to be the other
[1:12:17] way around
[1:12:18] they without us
[1:12:20] could not be made perfect
[1:12:22] so the greatest pressure the greatest
[1:12:24] darkness is at the end time
[1:12:26] but it's in a different form than what
[1:12:28] people perceive it to be in so the
[1:12:30] bride's tribulation that goes on around
[1:12:32] her is in a different form than the
[1:12:33] worlds is
[1:12:35] and so people don't perceive it to be
[1:12:37] pressure
[1:12:38] and they're deceived
[1:12:39] but there's a great pressure in this
[1:12:41] hour
[1:12:42] mustabi carried to the skies on flowery
[1:12:44] beds of ease while others fought to win
[1:12:46] the prize and sailed through bloody seas
[1:12:48] there are no foes for me to face
[1:12:51] must i not stem the flood
[1:12:53] is this vile world a friend
[1:12:55] has it suddenly become a friend i say no
[1:12:59] is this vow a world a friend to grace to
[1:13:01] help me unto god
[1:13:03] sure i must fight
[1:13:05] if i would reign
[1:13:07] increase my courage lord
[1:13:09] i'll bear the toil endure the pain
[1:13:12] supported by thy word
[1:13:14] did you think that there would be no
[1:13:16] battle
[1:13:17] i want to disabuse you of that notion
[1:13:19] today
[1:13:21] there will be a battle
[1:13:24] there will be a battle but there will
[1:13:26] also be a victor
[1:13:28] and you've already been promised that
[1:13:29] you would be the
[1:13:30] victor there will be a war but the bride
[1:13:33] cannot fall
[1:13:35] are you with me now satan will and his
[1:13:37] satan's evil try to deceive her but he
[1:13:40] will not be able to
[1:13:42] amen he said in this hour the elect
[1:13:43] would he said if it were possible oh i
[1:13:46] love that if it were possible the elect
[1:13:48] would be deceived but it is not possible
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:54] brother branham quoted that song when he
[1:13:56] talked about peter cartwright and the
[1:13:58] bully
[1:13:59] you remember the story
[1:14:00] how that the bully come in there he was
[1:14:02] in there washing windows
[1:14:05] am i going to make it without washing
[1:14:07] windows ever with a joel in the church
[1:14:09] probably not
[1:14:12] there was a minister a great great
[1:14:14] evangelist washing windows
[1:14:17] he was there washing the windows getting
[1:14:18] ready for the service
[1:14:20] and and i said that to brother joel
[1:14:22] because that sometimes what you end up
[1:14:24] doing especially overseas
[1:14:26] you just don't have all that help
[1:14:28] and so you end up doing that and and
[1:14:30] that's what he was doing and here come
[1:14:32] the bully of the town in he'd heard he
[1:14:34] was there he said if you're going to
[1:14:35] preach you've got to get by me first
[1:14:41] brother brandon said
[1:14:42] peter cartwright put down his towel
[1:14:45] rolled up his sleeves
[1:14:48] and said okay
[1:14:50] he said you got to go through me first
[1:14:52] okay
[1:14:53] he said lord increase my courage lord
[1:14:56] if i'm gonna reign i gotta fight
[1:14:58] increase my courage lord he said quoted
[1:15:00] that song and he said he went to beating
[1:15:01] on that man
[1:15:02] he said until he until he beat him under
[1:15:05] submission
[1:15:08] i'm not telling you to do that naturally
[1:15:09] tonight but you got some things there's
[1:15:11] some thoughts
[1:15:13] you need to beat under submission
[1:15:14] tonight
[1:15:16] there's some besetting sense
[1:15:18] that you need to beat under submission
[1:15:20] you need to keep under your body
[1:15:22] bring it under subjection lord i'm going
[1:15:24] to fight
[1:15:26] i'm going to fight so i can come to
[1:15:27] church

[1:15:30] saved i'm going to fight until for my
[1:15:32] healing i'm going to fight for my
[1:15:33] salvation lord if i must fight let me
[1:15:36] fight

[1:15:40] brother brother said the bully got saved
[1:15:42] that night in church

[1:18:24] church or to keep them in church
[1:18:26] brandon taught us that there's much more
[1:18:28] to this quote but i'm just going to read
[1:18:29] you parts of it because i got somewhere
[1:18:30] else i want to go tonight but he said
[1:18:32] could you imagine
[1:18:33] genuine christians being that
[1:18:36] being baby to get in church he said they
[1:18:37] were rugged
[1:18:38] they were burly
[1:18:40] could you imagine saint paul being that
[1:18:42] type of a christian could you imagine
[1:18:44] saint peter
[1:18:45] now he's if you don't make me general
[1:18:47] overseer well i don't know i might go
[1:18:48] join so-and-so
[1:18:50] they were rugged men
[1:18:52] they were men of faith they lived with
[1:18:54] god
[1:18:55] they walked with god they were men a few
[1:18:58] words
[1:19:00] i think you know what i think that means
[1:19:01] i think it means they didn't complain
[1:19:02] all the time
[1:19:06] the bible said there meant a few words
[1:19:07] they served god day and night
[1:19:10] constantly
[1:19:12] oh god you didn't have to spray them and
[1:19:14] baby them and offer them this side or
[1:19:15] the other they were men rugged they were
[1:19:18] genuine seeds not hybrid and
[1:19:19] denominations
[1:19:21] they he went on to say that you don't
[1:19:23] keep them sprayed with titles and and
[1:19:25] jobs and things like that if you go back
[1:19:27] if you remember back in the 90s there
[1:19:28] was a purpose-driven church and all the
[1:19:31] things that have come out i've got
[1:19:32] something to say maybe about that later
[1:19:34] but
[1:19:35] ever give everybody a job make them
[1:19:36] happy give them something to do send
[1:19:38] them overseas
[1:19:39] and the founder of that just bragged the
[1:19:41] other day he said i i trained a 1.1
[1:19:43] million preachers
[1:19:45] where are they why isn't the world a
[1:19:47] better place
[1:19:50] well you just give them titles
[1:19:53] paddled them on the back and said go
[1:19:54] preach the gospel
[1:19:56] until finally he started patting women
[1:19:58] on the back telling them to preach the
[1:19:59] gospel
[1:20:01] completely outside the word
[1:20:03] but brother branham and then quotes
[1:20:04] isaac watts again
[1:20:06] and he says this must not be patted on
[1:20:08] the back
[1:20:09] and this side and the other babies i
[1:20:11] expect my place out yonder with the
[1:20:13] rugged
[1:20:14] i expect not to come up there with no
[1:20:15] trophy scars at all i don't mean you're
[1:20:18] stupid
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:22] a lot of would be heroes are dead today
[1:20:24] because they were just stupid
[1:20:26] they don't mean you you're stupid you
[1:20:27] don't just take abuse
[1:20:29] but when you have to fight you fight
[1:20:32] are you with me now
[1:20:34] i don't expect to go with those scars
[1:20:36] i'm not stupid i'm not going to stand up
[1:20:37] and let them shoot at me but i'm sure
[1:20:39] going to shoot back
[1:20:41] i'm going to get behind something get
[1:20:42] behind the word
[1:20:44] be with me now and i'm sure enough's
[1:20:45] going to fire back not at the people but
[1:20:47] at the devil
[1:20:49] see i expect not to come up there with
[1:20:51] no trophy scars at all i must fight if i
[1:20:53] must train increase my courage lord see
[1:20:56] let me stand like a christian not to be
[1:20:58] a hybrid plant have to be babied and
[1:20:59] painted brought into something you're
[1:21:01] not brought in anyhow christianity
[1:21:03] you're born in it you become a new
[1:21:05] creature you're a seed of god that comes
[1:21:06] into the earth
[1:21:08] you weren't born of corruptible seed as
[1:21:10] the bible says but incorruptible
[1:21:13] you can't lose you might as well fight
[1:21:17] why would you refuse to fight a fight
[1:21:19] that you can't lose
[1:21:26] now look there is a a squeeze a pressure
[1:21:29] a tribulation for the bride
[1:21:32] right i think we've established that
[1:21:34] and and so each age if you go through
[1:21:36] each age you'll find they have their own
[1:21:37] sorts of pressures and i believe there's
[1:21:40] things peculiar to this age because we
[1:21:41] have an eagle anointing to be able to
[1:21:43] overcome our earth is not an ox age or a
[1:21:46] lion age
[1:21:48] ours is not a man age
[1:21:51] wisdom of man but it's an eagle age
[1:21:54] right where we fly over these things
[1:21:57] there's tribulation
[1:21:59] now
[1:22:00] again i do believe in a squeeze
[1:22:04] but i think people have a mistaken
[1:22:05] concept of what that is
[1:22:07] yes
[1:22:08] because there's all kinds of
[1:22:10] tribulations
[1:22:11] but now again tribulation is what works
[1:22:13] patience experience hope
[1:22:16] expectation
[1:22:17] and that makes us unashamed when he
[1:22:19] comes because our expectation will be
[1:22:21] met when we see him in the flesh if we
[1:22:24] endure the trial we possess the gate of
[1:22:26] the enemy after the trial how many heard
[1:22:28] that sermon yes brother branham preached
[1:22:30] that we possess the gate of the enemy
[1:22:32] after trial
[1:22:34] why because he preached that took it
[1:22:35] from abraham it was after the trial
[1:22:38] he went down amen to after a lot you
[1:22:40] remember and fought the kings he had to
[1:22:43] fight
[1:22:43] and when he got done he met melchizedek
[1:22:47] oh my after the trial so there's a trial
[1:22:49] for every age
[1:22:51] there's a squeeze the bible tells us in
[1:22:53] the raptured psalm and i won't read all
[1:22:54] of it to save time tonight i'll just
[1:22:56] read this one verse verse three he said
[1:22:58] though a host should encamp against me
[1:23:01] though a host shouldn't camp against me
[1:23:03] that's
[1:23:04] pressure at the rapture
[1:23:08] think about it pressure
[1:23:10] at the rapture
[1:23:12] though a host should encamp against me
[1:23:14] my heart shall not fear
[1:23:15] the war should rise against me and this
[1:23:18] will i be confident
[1:23:20] i'm hidden away
[1:23:22] in the secret of the coming you
[1:23:24] understand
[1:23:25] in the in the mystery of going he says
[1:23:28] now this is the rapture condition
[1:23:31] let's go to revelation chapter 9. you
[1:23:33] remember
[1:23:34] that there were some trumpets that
[1:23:35] sounded
[1:23:36] and brother branham doesn't tell us what
[1:23:38] each one of the trumpets are he doesn't
[1:23:40] preach the trumpets you remember because
[1:23:42] he said he preached the feast of the
[1:23:43] trumpets
[1:23:44] because he said that wasn't for us for
[1:23:46] the jews
[1:23:48] but he did tie in
[1:23:50] to the seventh trumpet and the seventh
[1:23:53] seal
[1:23:54] and ties into the sixth and seventh
[1:23:56] trumpet the sixth and seventh seal and
[1:23:58] he talks about how all the trumpets blow
[1:24:00] under the sixth seal but then he says
[1:24:02] that in the seventh trumpet and the
[1:24:04] seventh seal has something in common
[1:24:06] and and it's just revelation 13 he said
[1:24:08] the six angels sounded and i heard a
[1:24:10] voice from the four horns of the golden
[1:24:12] altar which is before god
[1:24:14] saying to the sixth angel that's the
[1:24:15] sixth trumpeting angel which had the
[1:24:17] trumpet loose the four angels which are
[1:24:18] bound in the great river euphrates the
[1:24:20] four angels were loosed which were
[1:24:21] prepared for an hour and a day and a
[1:24:22] month and a year to say the third part
[1:24:25] of men and the number of the army the
[1:24:27] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[1:24:28] thousand and i heard the number of them
[1:24:32] now i'm gonna skim through it brother
[1:24:33] branham taught us about this scripture
[1:24:35] because it's very long if you go and
[1:24:36] listen to it in the feast of the
[1:24:38] trumpets it's where it's located but i
[1:24:40] want to and you can read or listen to
[1:24:42] the entire thing when you get home but i
[1:24:43] want to dwell on just statements that
[1:24:45] brother branham made during this
[1:24:47] teaching
[1:24:48] and he taught us that these were turned
[1:24:49] loose again under the sixth trumpet he
[1:24:52] said there wasn't natural horses it was
[1:24:54] spiritual horses
[1:24:55] spiritual devils chargers found in the
[1:24:58] river euphrates he talked about the old
[1:24:59] roman empire being revived under fascism
[1:25:02] yeah you've heard him talk about it if
[1:25:04] you haven't you go back and listen to
[1:25:05] that tape again
[1:25:07] and because brother branham says a lot
[1:25:09] in the in feast of the trumpets
[1:25:12] he said and notice what happens under
[1:25:13] that sixth trumpet
[1:25:15] we're turned loose on the juice the
[1:25:17] persecution of the jews
[1:25:19] supernatural devils
[1:25:21] now
[1:25:23] again if you try to make the seals line
[1:25:25] up and i'm getting into doctrine here so
[1:25:27] just bear with me for a moment but if
[1:25:29] you try to make the seals line up like
[1:25:31] the church agents say well one two three
[1:25:32] four five six seven and then so the
[1:25:34] seventh one would be the third coming of
[1:25:36] christ and that has to be on the other
[1:25:38] side of the rapture we've got to go up
[1:25:39] in the forest seal and and there's
[1:25:42] truths to all of that but think about it
[1:25:43] if you try to line them up like that how
[1:25:45] are the jews under hitler nightman
[1:25:47] killed under the sixth trumpet when all
[1:25:49] the trumpets sound into the sixth seal
[1:25:54] i think about it
[1:25:56] that some of y'all think about that and
[1:25:58] chew on it for a while
[1:25:59] but that that's it did that's what he
[1:26:01] taught us
[1:26:02] so it's evidently there's things that
[1:26:05] are released under that trumpet it's
[1:26:07] almost like a preview
[1:26:09] of what's going to happen
[1:26:11] but there's also a preview for the bride
[1:26:13] what's going to happen during the
[1:26:14] tribulation to the church
[1:26:17] under those trumpets now look
[1:26:19] and and so there's something that's
[1:26:21] turned loose on the spiritual side and
[1:26:23] on the natural side but the brown said
[1:26:24] they turn loose on the jews the
[1:26:26] persecution of the jews supernatural
[1:26:27] devils nearly 2 000 years loosed by
[1:26:30] stalin hitler upon the jews that's been
[1:26:32] many years ago now
[1:26:34] he said you say well that isn't roman
[1:26:35] it's the same spirit they've done the
[1:26:37] same things they did to the christians
[1:26:38] in the old pagan roman days
[1:26:40] watch the natural israel in the
[1:26:42] spiritual spiritual church now he said
[1:26:44] as we separate it here
[1:26:47] i love that
[1:26:48] and so he talks about the fifth seal
[1:26:50] souls under the altar
[1:26:52] he talks about uh and you'll have to
[1:26:54] watch because in this sermon brother
[1:26:56] brown talks about the fifth seal then he
[1:26:57] calls it the sixth seal talks about the
[1:26:59] sixth trumpet calls it seventh trump but
[1:27:00] he goes back and forth but that's not
[1:27:02] what was important what was important is
[1:27:04] what happened
[1:27:05] right it's not necessarily the number
[1:27:08] we get caught up on numbers and names
[1:27:10] and that's not what's important what's
[1:27:11] important is what happens
[1:27:13] manifestation not theology
[1:27:17] are you with me yeah manifestation
[1:27:19] enough y'all what did god do
[1:27:21] that's important in your life too
[1:27:23] what did god do not not what did you
[1:27:25] figure out
[1:27:26] but what did he do in your life
[1:27:29] it's more important
[1:27:30] and and so then you'll find it matches
[1:27:32] with the word if it's a true conversion
[1:27:34] now
[1:27:35] he talked again about the roman empire
[1:27:37] how it was identified uh there were
[1:27:39] under pagan principles he said which
[1:27:41] still exists today
[1:27:42] the holidays and things that they did he
[1:27:44] said and they were loosed upon the jew
[1:27:46] who knew nothing of the spirit he said
[1:27:48] there's your mysteries that's hid under
[1:27:49] that seal there he said these trumpets
[1:27:52] are let loose on the jews he said don't
[1:27:53] you see not on the gentiles he said the
[1:27:55] gentiles when them seals was open is
[1:27:58] sealed away time has ended the church is
[1:27:59] called
[1:28:01] now watch
[1:28:02] he talks about the preview of the bride
[1:28:04] the sudden secret going away
[1:28:06] the seven visions in 1933 and i want you
[1:28:08] to understand that we're talking about
[1:28:10] when the finality of the seventh seal is
[1:28:13] realized that's when we go home
[1:28:16] it's a mystery of going so there's a
[1:28:18] part of that that we don't know and
[1:28:19] that's what day day and time he's coming
[1:28:22] we don't know that
[1:28:24] and so that that it doesn't get wrapped
[1:28:26] up so you could say that he doesn't take
[1:28:27] the book in that sense
[1:28:30] until we go home
[1:28:32] so there's there's two sides of it god
[1:28:34] always does things in uh in a spiritual
[1:28:36] way and then he does it in a real way in
[1:28:38] a reality way you understand
[1:28:40] and so he does it like he takes the book
[1:28:43] but then later he takes us
[1:28:46] we're still looking for that
[1:28:49] right and that's why we don't get off on
[1:28:50] a doctor and we say well the rapture's
[1:28:51] over because the seals have been
[1:28:52] revealed
[1:28:54] right there's still mercy you believe
[1:28:56] that tonight
[1:28:59] now
[1:29:00] stay with me you kids
[1:29:03] i'm talking about supernatural devils
[1:29:07] go read revelation chapter 9 and and
[1:29:10] look at this you'll ask your parents
[1:29:11] about it that's that's the thing to do
[1:29:13] is go read about these and ask your
[1:29:14] parents about what all that means
[1:29:16] because it's supernatural devils that
[1:29:17] look like look like horses
[1:29:20] right and they ha but they have certain
[1:29:22] other animal or beast elements to them
[1:29:25] now brother branham talked about these
[1:29:26] he said they they were dictators he said
[1:29:29] remember hitler or not when we're
[1:29:30] dictators i'm going somewhere tonight
[1:29:31] just hang with me
[1:29:32] dictators had power as kings and their
[1:29:35] king was from the bottomless pit brother
[1:29:38] branham talked about how that they'd
[1:29:39] done everything they could do they
[1:29:40] cremated their bodies and everything
[1:29:41] hung on fences
[1:29:43] children and all innocent people because
[1:29:45] they were jews they were done that way
[1:29:47] but god said to give each one of them a
[1:29:48] robe
[1:29:49] remember that's under that fifth seal
[1:29:51] undeserving as it was but his grace to
[1:29:53] blind them so that we could see
[1:29:57] and so he now he says here he said the
[1:29:58] seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know
[1:30:00] and you'll have people challenge you on
[1:30:01] that well how do you believe the book is
[1:30:02] open the seven steel hasn't opened well
[1:30:04] we're not gone
[1:30:07] right we're not gone
[1:30:08] that's it's coming there's a part of it
[1:30:11] we don't know
[1:30:12] the day and hour he's coming to me it's
[1:30:14] simple but people will get all confused
[1:30:16] about this because they want something
[1:30:17] else to happen before we go home but
[1:30:20] we're not promised anything else but the
[1:30:22] actual rapture of the church and the
[1:30:24] change of our bodies now he said that's
[1:30:26] his coming he said so while they're
[1:30:27] still under there but he shows us here
[1:30:30] in a preview
[1:30:31] now watch he said notice we find now
[1:30:33] that the natural power and of the
[1:30:34] natural to a natural nation
[1:30:36] israel was loosed there what what did it
[1:30:39] it went and made war and how it murdered
[1:30:41] and persecuted
[1:30:42] he said now
[1:30:44] now think about this
[1:30:46] here was in 1940
[1:30:49] 1938 through 1945 the second world war
[1:30:52] those 200 million demons were released
[1:30:55] in a natural way
[1:30:57] right that's what brother branham taught
[1:31:00] and he said now
[1:31:03] this is in 1963.
[1:31:05] i believe was 1963 or 1964.
[1:31:09] about it here at the end but he said now
[1:31:11] he said
[1:31:13] he said it's now it's loosed he said now
[1:31:16] the ecclesiastical realm has been opened
[1:31:19] has been opened
[1:31:21] he said now
[1:31:23] and from the natural revival the old
[1:31:25] pagan realm went forth on those jews
[1:31:26] which was always been their enemy
[1:31:29] and it was turned loose in the same
[1:31:30] spirit
[1:31:31] by the dictators of the world
[1:31:34] because the religious system was still
[1:31:36] holding
[1:31:38] now it's been loosed
[1:31:41] go back and listen to it brother branham
[1:31:43] ties it to the pope visiting rome
[1:31:46] in total darkness the eclipse coming
[1:31:48] what do you realize what age we live in
[1:31:50] you said there's no pressure
[1:31:54] think about it it's tribulation
[1:31:58] but not the great tribulation
[1:32:00] but all that are live godly in christ
[1:32:03] jesus are going to suffer persecution
[1:32:04] tribulation you're all you're always
[1:32:06] going to suffer and this is what we're
[1:32:08] called to in this hour now it's an
[1:32:10] ecclesiastical realm he said it has been
[1:32:12] opened
[1:32:14] he said it was turned loose in the same
[1:32:15] spirit by the dictators of the world he
[1:32:17] said the religious system was still
[1:32:18] holding now it's being loosed now it's
[1:32:20] been loosed he said what has it done
[1:32:23] in cunningness
[1:32:24] he said he'd come in like flatteries
[1:32:27] and what has he done what has he done
[1:32:30] he is bringing the protestant ecumenical
[1:32:32] council of the world churches
[1:32:34] the spirit of antichrist upon both of
[1:32:36] them you realize what a sea change there
[1:32:38] was in the 60s
[1:32:41] now think about it god was doing
[1:32:42] something
[1:32:43] on one side he's saying there'll be no
[1:32:45] more delay here we see a mighty angel
[1:32:48] come down with an open book
[1:32:51] right here the pope visits rome all this
[1:32:54] is going on during that same time frame
[1:32:57] if you look at culture since the 60s
[1:32:59] what's happened
[1:33:01] the world's gone insane
[1:33:04] why the demons have been loosed
[1:33:08] oh god
[1:33:09] they were loosed in the natural
[1:33:11] but they've been loosed in the spiritual
[1:33:14] in the ecclesiastical church
[1:33:16] he said now he said he's bringing the
[1:33:19] protestant economical council what the
[1:33:20] word ecumenical that's we're all the
[1:33:22] same let's just all get along
[1:33:24] he said of the world churches the spirit
[1:33:26] of antichrist upon both of them
[1:33:28] bringing them to the slaughter just like
[1:33:30] they did the other so there's going to
[1:33:32] be some in the end that will result in
[1:33:34] the slaughter of the church
[1:33:36] right during the tribulation
[1:33:39] he said just like they did the other in
[1:33:40] the hour to call the bride he said how
[1:33:42] loose in the ecclesiastical church
[1:33:44] spirit loosed upon what not upon the
[1:33:46] denominations upon the bride
[1:33:49] you think there's not pressure
[1:33:51] but there's something different about
[1:33:52] this age
[1:33:55] because every other age when there came
[1:33:57] this amount of pressure
[1:33:59] only one escaped that was jesus christ
[1:34:02] only one man didn't fall
[1:34:06] are you with me now but there was a
[1:34:08] bridegroom who didn't fall so there had
[1:34:10] to be a pride who didn't fall i noticed
[1:34:12] a lot for a wednesday night
[1:34:13] but a bridegroom didn't fall so there
[1:34:15] had to be a bride that didn't fall
[1:34:17] and so now there's coming a pressure on
[1:34:19] the bride
[1:34:20] it's not coming against the
[1:34:21] denominations it's coming against the
[1:34:23] bride
[1:34:24] that's what he said but he said here
[1:34:25] you'll get it
[1:34:27] oh god
[1:34:28] the bride will not go through that time
[1:34:32] what there's a slaughter coming
[1:34:34] but the bride will not go through that
[1:34:36] time
[1:34:37] when the antichrist becomes incarnate
[1:34:40] when these things that we see in a
[1:34:41] preview now
[1:34:42] these plagues begin to fall on the earth
[1:34:45] the bride oh god aren't you glad for god
[1:34:48] that has rescued you from great
[1:34:50] tribulation
[1:34:52] the church will but not the bride
[1:34:55] he said you say the church has to go
[1:34:56] through persecution for the perfection
[1:34:58] of it the blood of jesus christ perfects
[1:35:00] the bride
[1:35:01] a man who chooses a wife listen we do
[1:35:03] not go through trials do not look at
[1:35:05] your trials as perfection
[1:35:08] you're already perfect
[1:35:10] he's not making you perfect
[1:35:12] you can't be any more perfect
[1:35:15] but what's he doing with the trial
[1:35:16] giving you experience
[1:35:18] giving you patience
[1:35:20] making you realize who you are
[1:35:23] he already knows who you are but he's
[1:35:25] making you realize who you are so he
[1:35:27] allows the pressure to come to bring
[1:35:29] experience and to bring hope to bring
[1:35:31] expectation and to bring finally love
[1:35:34] the love of god shall have brought in
[1:35:35] your heart by the holy ghost
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:39] he said a man who chooses his wife don't
[1:35:40] put her through a lot of punishment amen
[1:35:42] he's already found grace with her she
[1:35:45] has found grace with him he engages to
[1:35:47] her and if there's anything he'll keep
[1:35:49] her from every place to turn her hand
[1:35:51] his grace is so great upon them and so
[1:35:54] will it be upon the bride and so it is
[1:35:57] on the bride
[1:35:58] so is it on the bride we unworthy
[1:36:00] creatures deserving of hell but his
[1:36:02] grace holds us through it
[1:36:04] and in the hour when i see all the
[1:36:06] churches they're great glamour and rich
[1:36:08] and have need of nothing they say and
[1:36:11] see the miserable wretched blind then
[1:36:13] patting you on the shoulders
[1:36:15] now watch this pressure coming on
[1:36:18] i i really believe we will not see the
[1:36:20] pressure
[1:36:22] in a form of persecution physical
[1:36:26] persecution i believe we go home before
[1:36:28] that happens
[1:36:29] now there may be some individuals when i
[1:36:31] say we there will be individuals who are
[1:36:33] persecuted
[1:36:34] we understand that
[1:36:36] we're fixing to go to a country that
[1:36:38] you can't build churches in
[1:36:40] or some countries where it's illegal to
[1:36:42] be a christian
[1:36:46] that's pressure
[1:36:48] right there are there are cases where
[1:36:50] people are under pressure but the main
[1:36:52] pressure of the age
[1:36:55] you understand the main pressure of the
[1:36:57] age is not
[1:36:59] physical persecution
[1:37:01] but it's spiritual persecution
[1:37:05] now watch he said patting you on the
[1:37:06] shoulders
[1:37:08] i want you to compromise with them
[1:37:11] i hope you can see it tonight
[1:37:13] see that's the bride's tribulation but
[1:37:15] he said i was born for a purpose
[1:37:17] that's to condemn that thing and to call
[1:37:19] out this i do
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:23] he said notice the loosing of this
[1:37:26] ecclesiastical spirit
[1:37:28] now 20 years later
[1:37:30] it had been 20 years
[1:37:32] almost since that loosing of those 200
[1:37:34] million demons and hitler and eightman
[1:37:36] and stalin
[1:37:38] under those dictators
[1:37:40] oh my those ones with power is kings he
[1:37:42] said but after that war he said now 20
[1:37:45] years later after that war we see the
[1:37:48] loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit
[1:37:50] what under the seventh seal
[1:37:53] the seventh trumpet to the jew
[1:37:55] he said look at the moon darkening out
[1:37:57] we're under
[1:37:58] where under the moon darkened out see it
[1:38:00] drawn out the son of man being drove
[1:38:02] from the church
[1:38:04] what is it joining in with the
[1:38:05] ecclesiastical bunch the economical move
[1:38:08] oh church
[1:38:09] if we just recognize that's what the
[1:38:10] lord laid on my heart yes you'll suffer
[1:38:12] persecution don't think you'll escape
[1:38:14] but there'll be natural hardships in
[1:38:16] your life but look at this spiritual
[1:38:18] hardship that's on the age that's what
[1:38:20] satan wants to do to you he wants to
[1:38:22] make you cold he wants to make you pull
[1:38:23] back he wants to make you say it's all
[1:38:25] the same it doesn't matter anyway it
[1:38:27] doesn't matter what a prophet said it
[1:38:28] doesn't matter what the pastor says it
[1:38:30] doesn't matter just just we'll just do
[1:38:31] what we want that's what he wants you to
[1:38:33] do
[1:38:35] oh god
[1:38:39] he don't care if you still call yourself
[1:38:40] a believer
[1:38:42] he just wants you to melt back into that
[1:38:45] ecumenical move
[1:38:47] to drift back
[1:38:49] into that
[1:38:50] place
[1:38:52] where you're comfortable
[1:38:54] but the bride's under pressure
[1:38:57] what kind of pressure is it
[1:38:59] now you'll be honest with me what's the
[1:39:00] pressure that you face every day
[1:39:02] what kind of pressure are they coming
[1:39:04] into your house searching your home for
[1:39:06] message books and throwing them away
[1:39:07] might be somebody doing that again there
[1:39:09] might be an individual going through
[1:39:10] that
[1:39:11] but as a whole what do we see
[1:39:13] we got all the books we want
[1:39:15] i got every message book on every device
[1:39:17] i own
[1:39:20] i got the prophet's voice on everything
[1:39:21] we're going to preach in a nation where
[1:39:23] they don't have it at all
[1:39:25] in their language none
[1:39:28] we've had to translate a couple of books
[1:39:29] so we can hand something out
[1:39:32] and and there's nothing
[1:39:34] but now
[1:39:35] here comes and it's not just that nation
[1:39:37] but the whole arabic speaking world
[1:39:40] but now look at this look what's
[1:39:41] happening i've got it right here
[1:39:43] what pressure am i under
[1:39:47] not to throw it away
[1:39:49] not to somebody take it from me
[1:39:51] i think it would be more dear to us if
[1:39:53] someone tried to take it from us
[1:39:55] yes
[1:39:58] i've seen them in africa
[1:40:00] take books and tear them apart i've seen
[1:40:02] it
[1:40:03] and take one page
[1:40:05] and read that one page
[1:40:11] there's a brother here who's here
[1:40:13] because the testimony in the message
[1:40:14] because the testimony of an african
[1:40:15] believer well some of those brothers
[1:40:17] really believe it
[1:40:18] they may not have shoes on their feet
[1:40:19] but they really believe it
[1:40:22] well paul understands that different
[1:40:24] ones of you understand that if you've
[1:40:26] been there and you know it they really
[1:40:27] believe it they're under a different
[1:40:28] kind of pressure in many places in the
[1:40:29] world what pressure are we under
[1:40:32] and i think it's getting this way
[1:40:33] everywhere
[1:40:34] not just here it's getting this way
[1:40:37] everywhere what pressure we under
[1:40:38] just to not read it
[1:40:41] it doesn't matter anymore
[1:40:46] the message doesn't matter
[1:40:49] men have given their lives literally
[1:40:52] to see the message get to the world
[1:40:55] and we have it all of it yeah
[1:40:58] and i'll
[1:40:59] when i have to study or when i have when
[1:41:01] someone challenges me on something i'll
[1:41:02] go look it up otherwise i'll leave it
[1:41:05] i don't say that y'all do that i know
[1:41:06] you're good people i know you study but
[1:41:08] that's the temptation
[1:41:10] same thing with the scripture
[1:41:12] places where they don't have the
[1:41:13] scripture the way we do in china they
[1:41:15] take everything out that doesn't fit
[1:41:17] with communism they don't have much of a
[1:41:18] scripture
[1:41:22] and so we have to smuggle in king james
[1:41:23] version bibles translated into chinese
[1:41:26] into china because they persecute them
[1:41:28] holding the scripture but we have
[1:41:30] it i've got four or five different bible
[1:41:33] labs what is the pressure on me an
[1:41:36] ecclesiastical spirit yes
[1:41:38] sure
[1:41:41] hear me now it doesn't matter
[1:41:44] oh god that's been loosed on this age
[1:41:47] that's been here
[1:41:48] now for 50 years more than 50 years
[1:41:51] he said notice the loosing of this
[1:41:53] ecclesiastical spirit look at the moon
[1:41:54] darkening out he said what is it joining
[1:41:56] in with the ecclesiastical budget
[1:41:57] economical move with the world council
[1:41:59] of churches has drove every man what
[1:42:01] does that thing stand for he said why
[1:42:03] you have to surrender all your
[1:42:04] evangelical teachings and things
[1:42:06] how can two walk together unless they be
[1:42:08] agreed they can't jesus said they can't
[1:42:10] how can a church
[1:42:12] watch a prophet foretelling what's
[1:42:14] happening right now he said the
[1:42:15] methodist and baptist walk together how
[1:42:17] can the church of christ walk with the
[1:42:19] presbyterians how can the catholic walk
[1:42:21] with the protestant how can protestant
[1:42:22] walk with protestant the biggest
[1:42:24] denomination in the world just had a
[1:42:25] convention biggest protestant
[1:42:27] denomination southern baptist convention
[1:42:29] just had a convention where they have to
[1:42:31] decide whether or not they're going to
[1:42:32] allow women preachers they've always
[1:42:35] stood against that
[1:42:37] and they brought it before an executive
[1:42:38] committee you know what they did
[1:42:40] they said let's do a year-long study
[1:42:43] on the meaning of the word pastor
[1:42:46] because we really don't know what a
[1:42:48] pastor is
[1:42:51] aren't you glad to be in the message of
[1:42:53] the hour
[1:42:55] that's that ecumenical move
[1:42:57] they don't dare stand against it because
[1:42:59] the biggest church in the ecumenical
[1:43:01] convention or in that southern baptist
[1:43:03] convention is saddleback church
[1:43:05] rick warren who stood up in the
[1:43:06] convention and said we should not be
[1:43:08] fighting over secondary issues
[1:43:11] like women preachers because he started
[1:43:13] just a few months ago ordaining women
[1:43:15] preachers in a church protestant can't
[1:43:17] walk with protestants
[1:43:19] but the bride
[1:43:20] oh my can't walk with the word how many
[1:43:23] believe that today
[1:43:24] i'm closing in just a moment he said
[1:43:26] which is christ it must be an agreement
[1:43:28] not the ecclesiastical system but the
[1:43:30] word you have to agree with the word to
[1:43:32] walk with the word
[1:43:33] notice there she is
[1:43:35] he said now she's loosed to do what
[1:43:39] loose to call all these little loose
[1:43:41] ends
[1:43:42] oh well don't make any difference anyhow
[1:43:45] that's what satan said to eve
[1:43:47] don't make any difference it's all right
[1:43:50] surely god is a good god he loves us all
[1:43:52] he doesn't
[1:43:53] that's a strong statement
[1:43:56] i mean you don't love your sin
[1:44:00] or mine
[1:44:02] you hear so much about it being a good
[1:44:04] god he is a good god but being good he
[1:44:05] has to be just remember his love is
[1:44:07] elective love
[1:44:10] he has to be justified there's no
[1:44:12] goodness without justice there's no
[1:44:14] justice without no law without
[1:44:15] punishment penalty lord in that hour
[1:44:17] that we're living yes oh my later on
[1:44:20] that same message he said at the same
[1:44:21] time
[1:44:22] he said now as soon as this church the
[1:44:24] bride is drawn together she has taken up
[1:44:26] she's drawn together we've went through
[1:44:27] that that's the shout draws the bride
[1:44:30] together he said she's drawn together
[1:44:32] aren't you glad to be drawn together hey
[1:44:34] most believers all over the world were
[1:44:35] drawn together not listening to the same
[1:44:37] tape what are we drawn together by by
[1:44:39] the word in his fullness
[1:44:41] right we're drawn together she's taken
[1:44:43] up in that mystery of the seventh seal
[1:44:45] the mystery of going
[1:44:47] he said and the jews is called by the
[1:44:48] mystery of the seventh trumpet which is
[1:44:50] two prophets elijah and moses and they
[1:44:52] come back they come back
[1:44:55] see if people are looking for the wrong
[1:44:56] elijah to come
[1:44:58] that our elijah already came
[1:45:00] and did what he was supposed to do
[1:45:03] didn't you say elijah was come he said i
[1:45:05] say he's come already
[1:45:08] amen they come back
[1:45:10] and there's where the pentecostals is
[1:45:12] all mixed up
[1:45:13] they're looking for something to happen
[1:45:14] the church is done gone and that's to
[1:45:16] the jews
[1:45:18] brother brown then stands up on the next
[1:45:20] sunday morning
[1:45:21] when he preaches
[1:45:23] now recognizing your day in its message
[1:45:25] you recognize it tonight and he says i'm
[1:45:27] going to say something
[1:45:29] national force put israel in her
[1:45:31] homeland
[1:45:32] national force will put the church in
[1:45:34] the world council he said but brother
[1:45:35] ben there's going to be a squeeze there
[1:45:37] is a squeeze
[1:45:39] it's just going to keep getting hotter
[1:45:42] but you understand there is a squeeze
[1:45:44] if there's not a squeeze now
[1:45:46] where did everybody go
[1:45:52] think about it
[1:45:56] if they started shutting tried to shut
[1:45:57] the doors today we'd have hundreds of
[1:45:59] people from this area in an underground
[1:46:01] church
[1:46:03] because they recognize the prophet said
[1:46:04] that
[1:46:05] and they would come immediately where's
[1:46:07] the squeeze
[1:46:11] i'm not trying to preach something new i
[1:46:13] believe brother branham taught this
[1:46:14] if i'm wrong bear with me in my folly
[1:46:17] this but listen what he said
[1:46:19] he said the world forces this way
[1:46:22] oh my he said the national force put the
[1:46:24] church in the world council churches but
[1:46:26] the power of god will put the people in
[1:46:27] the bride the world forces this way the
[1:46:30] world forces us that way but god forces
[1:46:32] upward
[1:46:33] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:46:34] god my spirit word is spirit and life
[1:46:36] will put the bride in her place
[1:46:38] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:46:40] the word
[1:46:42] tribulation
[1:46:44] amen bringing an experience yes oh god
[1:46:48] you had to go through what you went
[1:46:50] through are you with me tonight because
[1:46:52] now you realize who you are and when you
[1:46:54] know who you are you're an invincible
[1:46:56] army you can't be defeated
[1:46:59] amen the spirit of god which is the word
[1:47:01] of god my word is spirit of life i know
[1:47:03] this isn't skim milk tonight but just
[1:47:04] grab hold of it if you can grab hold of
[1:47:06] the cherry pie if there's a pin in it
[1:47:08] spit it out but grab hold of it tonight
[1:47:10] grab hold of the word he said he'll put
[1:47:12] we'll put the bride in her place because
[1:47:13] she'll recognize her position in the
[1:47:15] word then she's in christ will put her
[1:47:17] in her place
[1:47:18] no national force will do it but the
[1:47:20] national force did drive israel to the
[1:47:22] homeland the national forces of the
[1:47:24] council of churches will drive every
[1:47:26] organization into it
[1:47:27] but the power of god will raise the
[1:47:29] bride and the glory out of it
[1:47:32] oh my aren't you glad to be forced by
[1:47:34] the power of god
[1:47:36] aren't you glad the little tribulation
[1:47:38] that he let you go through is just to
[1:47:40] make make you aware of who you are
[1:47:43] oh my what is it will the pressure come
[1:47:46] musicians go ahead and come will the
[1:47:47] pressure the squeeze of our day make us
[1:47:49] give in
[1:47:51] huh can you answer that tonight will it
[1:47:53] make us give in i say no
[1:47:55] will it to be too much for us to handle
[1:47:57] no it won't
[1:47:59] amen we'll be taken out before the great
[1:48:01] tribulation comes on because he said
[1:48:03] hope maketh not ashamed because the love
[1:48:06] of god is shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:48:08] the holy ghost which is given unto us
[1:48:09] the more we go through the more pressure
[1:48:11] that we see the more it comes down and
[1:48:13] says well we're all the same it doesn't
[1:48:14] matter what a prophet said the more we
[1:48:16] love him
[1:48:17] the more they say oh he was a lion
[1:48:19] prophet the more we love god
[1:48:21] are you with me the more they say oh
[1:48:23] it's just a bunch of money hungry
[1:48:25] preachers the more we love god because
[1:48:27] we aren't married to a preacher
[1:48:28] we're not married to a man we're married
[1:48:30] to christ the word we're not feeding on
[1:48:32] a preacher we're not feeding on a man
[1:48:34] we're feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:48:36] of the son of man
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:40] amen it will only produce more love in
[1:48:42] our hearts for him paul says in romans 8
[1:48:44] 35 who shall separate us from the love
[1:48:46] of christ
[1:48:47] show tribulation
[1:48:50] it's the same word
[1:48:52] tribulation pressure
[1:48:54] will it separate us it didn't separate
[1:48:56] the first or the second or the third or
[1:48:58] the fifth was the fourth or the fifth or
[1:49:00] the sixth church age the real believer
[1:49:02] it didn't separate them from the love of
[1:49:03] christ
[1:49:04] it will not separate the bride from the
[1:49:06] love of christ in this day
[1:49:08] whatever form it takes
[1:49:10] so tribulation or distress or
[1:49:12] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:49:14] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:49:16] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:49:18] are accounted as sheep for the sovereign
[1:49:19] that's just our life
[1:49:21] man all these things we are more than
[1:49:24] conquered someone say more than
[1:49:25] conquerors
[1:49:27] through him that loved us
[1:49:29] and he expresses us it this way in
[1:49:31] second corinthians 4 17 for our light
[1:49:35] tribulation
[1:49:38] oh glory
[1:49:40] our light affliction
[1:49:43] which is but for a moment
[1:49:46] it's temporary
[1:49:49] work is for us
[1:49:51] a far more exceeding
[1:49:53] and eternal weight
[1:49:55] of glory
[1:49:56] he said when he put it on the balance
[1:49:59] the pressure by the job of being a
[1:50:00] message believer in this hour
[1:50:03] the pressure of standing for the word
[1:50:05] and having to stand for it when family
[1:50:07] doesn't doesn't stand for it when
[1:50:09] churches don't stand for it the pressure
[1:50:11] of standing
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:15] it works for us
[1:50:17] the pressure if you put it on a scale on
[1:50:19] one side it'd be so light
[1:50:21] compared to the glory
[1:50:23] of seeing who you are
[1:50:26] you look back and say i was a christian
[1:50:28] when i went in so i was a christian when
[1:50:30] i come out
[1:50:32] oh god
[1:50:34] can you say that tonight
[1:50:36] it didn't change me
[1:50:38] it may have made me have a better
[1:50:40] understanding it may have it may have
[1:50:42] helped my character but it didn't change
[1:50:44] what i believe
[1:50:46] i'm a christian i'm a believer and a my
[1:50:49] light affliction will only worked for me
[1:50:51] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:50:54] of glory
[1:50:56] so we glory and tribulations
[1:50:58] knowing that tribulations work patience
[1:51:01] the bride has to have the patience to
[1:51:03] run the race
[1:51:05] the last leg of the race
[1:51:07] set before us in this day don't you love
[1:51:09] him tonight
[1:51:11] why don't we just worship him a little
[1:51:12] bit
[1:51:13] just lift your hands and say lord i love
[1:51:15] you
[1:51:18] i thank you lord this light affliction
[1:51:21] that you're working in my life is
[1:51:23] nothing
[1:51:24] compared to seeing
[1:51:26] what you've done in my life
[1:51:29] this momentary pain
[1:51:31] is nothing
[1:51:33] compared to the eternal weight
[1:51:36] this tribulation of the bride
[1:51:39] is nothing
[1:51:40] because i know you'll keep me on every
[1:51:42] hand you will not let me go through a
[1:51:44] great tribulation
[1:51:46] but these little tribulations these
[1:51:48] little trials that i go through
[1:51:50] this little pressure that i feel
[1:51:53] the thing that makes me want it just
[1:51:55] tries to get me to shut up and not be a
[1:51:57] real believer the thing that tries to
[1:51:58] get me to lay down the message of the
[1:52:00] hour it doesn't matter anymore
[1:52:02] oh god
[1:52:04] lord that pressure is nothing
[1:52:06] compared to the glory
[1:52:08] of being a child of god not only being
[1:52:10] one but knowing
[1:52:13] that you've made me one i'm so grateful
[1:52:16] for that lord help these people
[1:52:18] oh god you put this on my heart for some
[1:52:19] reason maybe there's somebody that
[1:52:22] that's going through a trial lord as now
[1:52:23] we continue to worship you
[1:52:26] but lord maybe there's somebody going
[1:52:27] through a trial tonight i pray you would
[1:52:29] help them lord to just
[1:52:31] just reach out past the pain and the
