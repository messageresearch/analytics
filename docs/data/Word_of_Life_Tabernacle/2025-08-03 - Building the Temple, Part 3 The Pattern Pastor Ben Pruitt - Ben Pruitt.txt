Amen. I believe the Lord is pleased with your worship this morning. I was listening to a sermon again from our meetings this morning, actually. And I man, we don't Other people say they worship the Lord and denominations say they worship the Lord and and they've got a form of worship. Amen. But with divine revelation, we know how to worship. &gt;&gt; And we ought to be thankful for that this morning because we know who he is. because we know he who he is. We know who we are. Amen. So, we can really worship God this morning like nobody else. &gt;&gt; Like nobody else. I wonder if we just reach out and touch him this morning.

Lord, like the woman with an issue of blood who reached out and in a moment she was completely healed, oh God. We come into this world sick, Lord, not just sick in body, but sick in soul, Lord, and you've healed us. We thank you for that. I pray Lord that we be Lord have the faith to reach out Lord when we have a need and realize that if you saved our souls you can heal our bodies. Give us joy and peace and all these other things. I pray that you'd grant that Lord. Pray that you'd move in this service. I I think there may be someone here Lord that's in need or or sick in some way. I pray God that you just reach down make a difference in their lives this morning. Move me out of the way Lord. I know I can't make a difference, but you can, Lord. I pray you would do that. God, move me out of the way and speak. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. 1 Chronicles 28:1. We just begin where we left off last week on the building of the temple. Today we want to talk about the pattern of the temple. 1 Chronicles chapter 28 11. Good to see everybody this morning. God bless you. Thank you for being here today. 1st Chronicles 28:11 says, "Then David gave to Solomon his son, the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the Lord, of all the chambers roundabout, of the treasuries of the house, house of God, of the treasuries of the dedicated things, also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord. He gave of gold by weight for things of gold. For all instruments of all manners of service, silver also for all instruments of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service. Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their lamps of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof. For the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the candlestick also for the lamps thereof, according to the youth of every candlestick. I know there's a lot of reading this morning, but this is really important. By weight, he gave gold for the tables of shoebread, for every table. Likewise, silver for the tables of silver. Also pure gold for the flesh hooks and the bowls and the cups. And for the golden basins, he gave gold by weight for every basin. Likewise, silver by weight for every basin of silver. and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubam that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord. All this said David, the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. what David passed on or what he gave to Solomon his son would not have been just uh materials to build the temples we talked about last week not just the nails and the hinges and and the and the wood and and the gold but what he gave him was also a a scale model of the entire temple. That's what that word pattern is. It's actually a model of the entire temple. So he would have made a scale made it to scale and put everything that was would be in the temple would have been in the pattern that David gave to him. And so it was it was all the weights all the sizes all the furniture everything that would be in the temple would be in the model. And it wasn't just paper instructions. David said I received it by inspiration by writing. He said and then I made a model of it or a pattern of it. That's what that word means. And so it was an actual model of the temple. Every single thing in the temple was divi was designed by inspiration. And it was the manifestation of a vision that Moses had that God showed him what the tabernacle was like in heaven. And Moses built one on the earth. But that that tabernacle over the years, it had been hundreds of years since Moses had done that. But now David gets by inspiration the same vision that Moses had and he comes and makes a pattern of what the temple was to be. Now brother Brandon says if you notice Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw on Mount Si in heaven. He said Moses when he returned from his vision pitched the tent and made it just exactly like he saw in heaven. And when Solomon built the temple, he made it just exactly the way he seen the pattern, the type. He said what a spiritual application we could apply here that we are to never we are never to leave the scripture. Stay exactly with the pattern. How many believe that today? We are to never leave the scripture because the scripture is the pattern given by inspiration by writing and then that is modeled in our lives and in the lives of those who lived during th those days and and so we have a model and we have it in writing. Now and I'm I thank God for that. I thank God that he didn't just make it a written word but he put it in a model a scale that we could understand. We we it was written what mercy was and what love was and what grace was. But one day there came down a model. There come down a the house of God. The temple was there in flesh. It was Jesus Christ. And and and what God wanted it was displayed even in the temple itself. What God prefigured in the temple was displayed in Jesus Christ. And so we had a model or a pattern of what an individual ought to be in our day and age. And that pattern is not a preacher. It's not even a prophet. But that pattern is our Lord Jesus Christ. How many want to be like him this morning? Oh, I want to be more. I think of that song all the time. I want to be more like Jesus. I don't want to be like other people. I want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; So he talks about how that he built the temple according to the pattern. He just exactly he said like he saw it and he said we want to stay exactly with the pattern. He said that's the reason I believe that's the way the first church was patterned. That's the way the next one should be patterned. He said, "And that's the way everyone should be patterned, just the way it was at the beginning." So, do you see it? It was patterned the way God saw it in heaven. And and every temple, every tabernacle that would be built on the earth would be patterned after what was saw in heaven. What God had in his mind for the church, for the bride, what he had in mind for us in this day and hour. We don't just do what we do by accident. We don't have service the way that we do by some accident or some, well, it's just the way our culture is. That's not it at all. We do what we do. We preach the word because that's what God had in his mind. We we listen to the word. We receive the word. We say amen to the word because that's what God had in his mind. We worship in song because that's what God had in his mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For us to do. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show that to you in just a moment. Now, now he said let them, he said, everyone should be patterned just the way it was at the beginning in Exodus 25:8. God speaking to Moses. He said, "Let them make me a sanctuary &gt;&gt; that I may dwell among them &gt;&gt; according to all that I show thee." In other words, don't leave anything out what you saw in the vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Make the church to match what you saw in the vision of heaven. Make the tabernacle to match what you saw in the vision. So he said, "Make me a sanctuary. Let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof. Even so shall you make it." It's interesting that God wanted a perfect house. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. But yet he had imperfect man &gt;&gt; to make him a perfect house. &gt;&gt; But see, it was just a a pattern. It was a type of something that was coming. There would be a perfect one come. we could become perfect by his blood. But the pattern that God had in his mind, he didn't say, he didn't come down and say, "Well, I'm going to build myself a tent. I'm gonna make myself a tabernacle." He didn't come down and do that. Though he did that in Christ, but he did not do that in the first tabernacle. He said, "Let them make me a place of worship. Let them let them make me a tabernacle that I want it made exactly to these specifications." &gt;&gt; So God wanted it built that way. In Acts chapter 7 and verse 44, we know that God, see, we know that God, you know, his ultimate gain, his ultimate aim was not to live in a building. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How many know that this morning? &gt;&gt; God's ultimate is not just to be in this building, but it's to be in the hearts of men and women. &gt;&gt; Right? And so, he wanted to tabernacle himself in flesh. And so, Stephen is preaching to them. And he says this in Acts 7:44, "Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen, &gt;&gt; which also our fathers that came after, brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, into the days of David, who found favor before God, desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But Solomon built him a house. How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands. &gt;&gt; Other words, walls can't contain it. &gt;&gt; A church, that's why we don't believe our church is the only one that's right. We don't believe we're the only ones that's going in a rapture cuz these walls don't contain the almighty God. My ministry does not contain all of God. These walls don't contain all of God. But God wanted to live in a people and there's some people in Hardy and some people in Africa and some people all over the world that believe God's word and follow the pattern of the word &gt;&gt; that God they become the temple of God. The bride in this hour has become the temple of God worshiping according to the pattern that he gave us. &gt;&gt; So Solomon built him a house but he said the the most high dwellth not in temples made with hands. Heaven is my throne. Earth is my foottool. What house will you build me? sayeth the Lord, what is the place of my rest? Have not my hand made all these things? Then in Hebrews 10:5, Brother Brandham always puts this scripture with that one. He said, "Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering, thou wouldest not." In other words, I the time has come that we're going to move away from the temple worship, but a body hast thou prepared me? Oh, he was the body of God. He was the Jesus Christ was God tabernacled in flesh. Oh, don't you believe? I wonder if we could say take it a little further this morning and recognize that the bride is the body of Jesus Christ. So we are God tabernacled in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to understand because we're fallible. But what did he ask? He asked for fallible man. &gt;&gt; Build me a temple. &gt;&gt; And he didn't say, "Well, just do the best you can." He said, "Follow the pattern." &gt;&gt; But how does he do that? How can he do that? See, how did he do it? In the Old Testament, if you go and you look at how they built the tabernacle, they didn't just do it. They were inspired to do it. All &gt;&gt; right? They didn't just perform a duty. &gt;&gt; But but the the Bible says their heart was stirred up. &gt;&gt; What a difference it makes in a church. &gt;&gt; In a body of people, when somebody's heart gets stirred, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, our heart needs to be stirred to do the preaching. Our heart needs to be stirred to work with the young people. Our heart needs to be stirred to be a deacon if we're going to be a deacon. Our heart needs to be stirred to work in the trustee room. Our heart needs to be stirred to do things in the house of God, whether it's sound or video or whatever it is, let your heart be stirred. We're not doing it for a man. We're doing it for the almighty God. And so, whatever was done in the tabernacle, whatever was done in the temple, the Lord gave a willing heart to the people and they said, "We'll follow the instructions of the word." Exactly. If you got to force people to do it or make people do it, you'll drag them along like an old mule and they'll work, but they'll never work. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They'll work, but they'll always protest. A mule will do more work than anybody, but he protests. He don't You don't like to be told what to do. But we don't have to tell somebody whose heart's been stirred what to do. You just point them in the right direction and let them go at it because there's something in their heart to do it. I said, "Oh, God, put something in our heart that'll help us to do what God called us to do. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; That's the way the temple ought to be built because the we can't do it by our own ways. We have to do it according the inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; Someone just want to do it themselves and make a mess out of it. &gt;&gt; Somebody that wants to be a preacher so bad they'll go out here and I don't say nothing to get me in trouble. They'll go out here and just make themselves a ministry. preach. &gt;&gt; That's not the pattern, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Wait on your ministry, &gt;&gt; right? They're just constantly pushing and want to be a preacher, wanting to be a something in the church." I say, "God, help us. Lord, stir us up &gt;&gt; to do whatever needs to be done. &gt;&gt; Whatever pattern that he set for us to do, Lord, if I'm a brother minister, the way you find out or whether you're called, I don't know where I'm going here this morning, but he said the way you find out whether you should be doing something is whether you can do it or not." &gt;&gt; Right? So if you're talented in a certain direction, maybe that's where God's called you to. But when when the opportunity comes, you don't push yourself in there. But when the opportunity comes and say, "Lord, let me be willing every time." You may not be used all the time, but every time I am used, let me be willing to do my best and give it my all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of young people coming up. And I want you young people to understand that church work is difficult. And you're going to be the next generation of of church workers. And some of y'all raised in deacons homes and pastor's homes and preachers homes and and you know what it's like to sacrifice to go to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you know what it takes. You you you've been there. You know the hardship of it. You know the the mental toll that it takes and and the trouble that sometimes you have to deal with. But let me tell you this morning, it's worth it because you're not doing it for for yourself. You're doing it for God's people. Ultimately, you're doing it for God himself. You're not just serving uh serving a church. You're not just serving a function. You're not serving a group of people or a fellowship. You're serving the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be able to do that this morning? &gt;&gt; I think we ought to do it with a willing heart and a smile on our face because we know that the next generation, if they come along, we don't want them to run from it. We want them to be willing say, "Lord, inspire me to do what you've called me to do." &gt;&gt; Yes. If we gripe about it all the time, our kids aren't going to want to do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Look, this pattern would be a type, a place of mercy, a place of redemption, a place where he would put his name. Oh my, listen. God said, "A body hast thou prepared me?" He was with them in the garden, but he wanted to be in them. and he wanted to dwell not just in any body but in a redeemed body. &gt;&gt; And Satan had entered into man. Now Satan could not tabernacle himself in man but he entered into the bloodline of man through the serpent. And and in doing that in the garden and in doing that what did he do? He he he actually he actually made man a tabernacle for evil. A place where full of evil, born in sin, shapen in iniquity. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come into the world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But now Satan entered in. But God wanted to dwell there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And God could not dwell in a temple that was unholy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, church, I know a lot of times we say, "Well, I want more of God. I want to be closer to God." Many times the way to get more of God is just get rid of the things that we know are wrong. We know some of the things that we're doing is wrong. Just let go of those things. Get rid of those things. Be willing to to lay that down and begin to do the word of God and you begin to find yourself getting closer and closer to God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He shoot He showed Moses a place. He said, "I'm going to make a place of mercy until the true temple comes. I'm going to make a place of redemption, a place where I can put my name." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And this pattern would be a type and a shadow of Jesus Christ who is the body that God prepared and of the church who is his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. The believers at Pentecost became a scale model of the body of Christ. So he didn't just leave us the word, but he actually left a model. &gt;&gt; And that's what was so important because you know the the influence of that church lasted for a while, but then it sank into Catholicism through the dark ages. But now at the end time, he had to create another model. We had the writing of it, &gt;&gt; but we didn't have the model. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So God come down in our age. That's what the message is all about. The message is not about creating a new religion. The message is not about creating some kind of new idea, but the message is bringing us back to the pattern, back to the to make us a model of the house of God of what it'll be like in heaven. &gt;&gt; So the believers at Pentecost become a scale model of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And when John saw Jesus, he saw him where? He saw him in the midst of the lampstands. Now you remember this why I said it was so important when we were reading David had a vision and he he was inspired by God to write and he wrote about the candlesticks right the lampstands you know that's so detailed why would he detail the lampstands the candlesticks well it's because the candlestick would be a type of the church &gt;&gt; right the the seven uh the seven lampstands which is the seven churches which all come all had the same oil. &gt;&gt; All had the same fire. Right. You maybe we need to teach on the church ages again, but but you know the in the church ages, they all were lit off the original fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And they all had the same oil flowing through all seven lampstands. So they were not seven separate churches but one church in seven dispensation, seven ages. And so the candlestick was made exactly according to the pattern. So David sees, he says, "This is how much the candlestick should weigh, right? This is how much gold you put on them." Hallelujah. So the candlestick being a type of the church in Numbers 8:1, we find the original uh pattern of the candlestick. The Lord spoke to Moses saying, "Speak unto Aaron, saying to him, "When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick." And Aaron did so. So he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the Lord commanded Moses. This work of the candlestick was a beaten gold. Unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according unto the pattern which the Lord had showed Moses. So he made the candlestick. Oh, when I saw this, I just about run around my room because I realized, brother Bill, that the way he did the candlestick in the Old Testament is the way he patterned the church in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Right? if he could actually make a candlestick that was patterned just exactly the way he wanted it to be. And when Moses made it or or the man who fashioned it was a maybe a worker in gold, he was inspired by God to have the right pattern and the flowers and things. And so God comes down and said, "This is the exact pattern of what I wanted." &gt;&gt; You realize what he did on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; He come down and there was a candlestick. Amen. that there was a there was a a lampstand there and he looked at it and he was able he said I can walk in the midst of this church I can be it I can dwell in this church why it's exactly the pattern that I wanted and that first church pattern is the same pattern today &gt;&gt; so the candlestick was made in the exact pattern which the Lord had showed Moses &gt;&gt; yeah right &gt;&gt; if he patterned that natural candlestick &gt;&gt; don't you think he also patterned the spiritual candlestick the church Yes. &gt;&gt; Again, we don't do what we do haphazardly, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But by inspiration &gt;&gt; and commandment, &gt;&gt; right? And it takes both of those things, &gt;&gt; so when we worship, when we worship as a church, we don't worship just by commandment, but we worship by inspiration and by commandment. &gt;&gt; And our inspiration is not to go outside of the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But there's got to be inspiration in it or it's a dead letter &gt;&gt; because the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. So there's got to be a model that begins to show in our lives. See, it's not enough to tell our kids, listen, Solomon is about to pass or David rather is about to pass it on to another generation. He's about to pass it on to Solomon. Are you with me so far this morning? You've been good to preach to. I I'll try not to hold you real long. I'll give you a little time off, you know, for good behavior. But but Solomon, when David gives Solomon a pattern, he didn't just leave him words. &gt;&gt; But he left him an example. &gt;&gt; This is what the temple ought to look like. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope our lives today can become an example. &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't be just words. It's not enough to leave these young people words, &gt;&gt; but we've got to leave them an example. An example of what God wants us to be. And as as as elders, it's it's important. See, if we don't pay attention in church, they won't pay attention in church. If we don't worship in church, they won't worship in church. They're following the model that God built in our lives. So, I say, "Let me be on fire for God. Let me do what God wants me to do. Let me be everything that God wants me to be. Let me be a model of the grace of God." Listen, if God saved me, he can save you young people. If he brought me out, he can bring you out. If he set me on fire, he can set you on fire this morning. Do you believe that, church? Some of you elders say, "Well, I don't have I don't have any job. I don't have any use anymore in the church." But listen to me. You're a model. You're a model of God's grace. You're a model of God's forgiveness. You're a model of what God can do in a life. &gt;&gt; How he can change somebody, how he can make them faithful. You're a model in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Don't think that the model was destroyed because you backslid or did something wrong some a long time ago. But remember, just because you did wrong don't mean that model was destroyed. God was doing. He was going to show a model of grace. &gt;&gt; But now that you know the truth, now that you can walk in life, walk in it with all of your heart. Don't let that model be broken, but model the word of God with all your life. All your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It'll be an inspiration to our young people. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; We don't just come to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are the church. How many understand that &gt;&gt; we don't just attend church? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We are the house of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We we we model forgiveness to our children. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We model love to our children. &gt;&gt; We model peace in our home &gt;&gt; to our children. Right? &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me." I think I told you here not long ago. You know, I never fuss with my wife, but if I ever do, my kids are around. Oh, nobody else does that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know you all shut the door and everything, they're listening at the door, too. But it seems like that every time if we do get crossways or something where I'm grumpy, there's people around young people. And I've prayed about that recently. God, help me. &gt;&gt; I know there's peace in my heart. &gt;&gt; I know there's peace in my home. I know there's peace in the church. Let me show that to the people. &gt;&gt; Let me be a model of that. But the said the token had to be on display. &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't enough just to have it, but to have it on display. See, they could have killed the lamb. They could have they could have uh they could have took the blood and set it in in the house. They could have done everything just how they were supposed to do it. But if they didn't put it on display, if they didn't put it on the mantel where it could be seen, where it was a public testimony, it didn't do anybody any good. But if it was on display, it covered the whole house. Let my token, let the Holy Ghost in me, I'm going get amen to that church. And may the Holy Ghost that's in me be a a a token and a and a reality to people around me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. When the children of Israel come out of Egypt, they became the church. They became the church. Why? Because they were the called out of Egypt. And brother Brandon said, "Then being the church of God, God ordained a certain place for these people to meet in where there would be fellowship because God longs to fellowship with his people and among his people." Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God took Moses up into the mountain of fire where the lightnings was flashing, the thunders roaring, and he showed him what kind of a dwelling place he desired to dwell in on earth. For Moses patterned the earthly tabernacle to what he'd seen in heaven, a sanctuary of the Lord. Oh, I think it's so beautiful to think that God before he would let a church building be built, that that building had to be a pattern of his heavenly abode. Moses made all things after the pattern of the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Again, he said Moses followed the pattern that he saw in heaven and pitched the tent to represent it. When Solomon built the temple, what did he do? He followed the pattern that Moses by the tent keeping the scripture in line. And when God came to come to his temple for the last days, this temple, the Holy Ghost, a body has self-prepared me. The Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost. The message was repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you to your children to them that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call what was that a pattern &gt;&gt; right he come to his temple and that's the way he acted in the temple again brother Ram says Pentecost was our pattern &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; no one can say but that the church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and the same spirit that come upon them on that day Every time. Someone say it now. Every time. &gt;&gt; How many times? Every time. &gt;&gt; Without fail. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. In the Bible, when the Holy Ghost came upon the people, they acted the same way. Again, he said, "Now, we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit, how the first or original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her. The word can't change or be changed because the word is God." He said, "It can't be added to or taken away. He said that's what the church was at Pentecost is the standard. &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. Do we believe that church? &gt;&gt; There is no other pattern. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. There's no other pattern. Our pattern is not in another city or another state. &gt;&gt; It's at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right at Pentecost, not denominational Pentecost, but Pentecost of the beginning &gt;&gt; at in Acts two. He said that is the pattern. There's no other pattern. No matter what the scholars say, God has not changed that pattern. What God did at Pentecost, he used to keep on doing &gt;&gt; until the church ages close. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I love that. What the church had at Pentecost &gt;&gt; is her inalienable right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Everything he modeled, all the furniture. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; The the way the lampstand would be and would shed light and the way everything would work together, the way he modeled it was the way it would be. And it is her inalienable right. &gt;&gt; Oh church, you say, "Well, it's changed. Times have changed. We can't have church like that no more." I say that's not according to the original pattern. But if we follow the original pattern, God will still come down and invest his temple with his presence. He will still come down and make a difference in life. If they had healing in the original pattern, there's healing for us here at the end. If they had salvation in the original pattern, there's salvation for us at the end. &gt;&gt; All right? If they testified in the original pattern of the things God had done and had joy in their hearts, there's joy in our hearts here at the end. That don't mean you'll never have a struggle. It don't mean you'll never you'll never have a trial. What it means is God's going to take care of you. He's going to make a difference in your life. He's going to change you and make you different. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Well, I'm what I'm going through right now. I don't feel that." You need to look at the pattern and see if God did it for them. If he did it for past generations, even that we people we've known, then he'll do it for you. If he did it in anywhere, at any place in the world, he can do it for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right. Originally, she had the pure word of God. She had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That original church was not organized by men. It was led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It wasn't very big. It was hated and despised. It was oppressed. It was persecuted unto death. But it was true to God. &gt;&gt; It stayed with the original word pattern. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, man is always trying the pattern after something else, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Something other than the pattern given by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you'll find in the scripture in 2 Kings chapter 16, you can go read the whole story later, but 2 Kings chapter 16, a king named Ahaz. Ahaz. He was the grandson of Uzziah. And he went to Damascus. This is during the time that Isaiah was a prophet in the land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we know that Ahaz was the king. You remember that God spoke through Isaiah and he said, "Ask of me a sign." &gt;&gt; Remember? And and Ahaz said, "I don't I won't ask the Lord a sign." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he said and Isaiah said, "The Lord himself will give you a sign. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive." Amen. All &gt;&gt; right. This is that same king. And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tigle, king of Syria. So, King Ahaz was from a good family. His grandfather served the Lord right up until the end. And he made a mistake and got leprosy. But his father served the Lord with all of his heart. But King Ahaz was actually he he become friendly with the Assyrians and he wanted to be like them. He realized, you know, it must have been something for him being a king of Israel. There was a great things in Israel. The temple was a great building and it was a great palace, but it must have been nothing like Babylon, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or like Nineveh, like the great cities of Assyria. &gt;&gt; So when he goes up to the king of Assyria and he saw an altar and he and he sees the way that they worship and he sees the manner of everything that they're doing and he goes up there and he begins to look around and say, "My goodness, this is so much bigger than what we have, so much better than what we have. So much so much good could be done with with this style of worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so what he does is he comes back and he comes back to Jerusalem or he actually before he leaves Damascus, Syria, he comes back into Jerusalem and he sees the great one Damascus is one of the great cities of the world, Nineveh and Babylon, all those great cities like that. And he sees Damascus in the way that they do things. And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the fashion of the altar. Now remember, David gave Solomon a pattern. &gt;&gt; And Solomon followed that pattern exactly. &gt;&gt; Said, "This is how we worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is how we have church." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is what God wants. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And here comes the king along and says, "Boy, I tell you what, these guys are doing things pretty good." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think we need to be more like them. And so he sends a letter back to Uriah the priest who evidently was a hierling &gt;&gt; because a real priest ought to have been able to withstand the king and say no matter what you say we're not going to worship like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the king goes down and he's he sees the he sees the fashion of the altar. Now remember this is a son of David. &gt;&gt; This is the king of Judah. &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; in the lineage of David. But he goes down to Damascus. He sees the pattern of the altar according to all the workmanship thereof. And Uriah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus. &gt;&gt; So Uriah the priest made it against King Ahaz came from Damascus. In other words, he made it before King Ahaz come back. So he thought this will please the king. &gt;&gt; So we'll change the temple. &gt;&gt; Oh church, &gt;&gt; we'll change the pattern &gt;&gt; so that it &gt;&gt; brother Brandon said in the first church age what happened? He said the mayor of the city started coming and people that were affluent started coming and they didn't want to be identified with people who shouted and spoke in tongues and and worshiped and prayed all night long and and bunch of slaves and cast off. They didn't want to be identified with people like that. And so they begin to change the way they worshiped to fit the gods of the land that they were in. And pretty soon the worship become Roman. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And they found they were worshiping devils. Not even worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Thinking they were worshiping God. good &gt;&gt; and become what today we have in modern Catholicism. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that as it pertains to communion tonight. But the pattern got broken because a a man in a position of power saw the way other people were doing it and said we need to do it that way. I say God help me to be humble. God help all of us to be humble to the word of God and say we need to worship according to the way that God gave us to worship according to the original pattern. Good. &gt;&gt; This king was the son of a great king who served God with all of his heart. &gt;&gt; But there was something about that second and third generation coming down. He just lost sight of what God wanted. The Bible says when when the king was come from Damascus, &gt;&gt; the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar &gt;&gt; and offered there on nothing happened. &gt;&gt; Fire didn't fall out of from God out of heaven and consume him. &gt;&gt; He thought he got by with it real well. But if you fast forward about 150 years, &gt;&gt; this is why we need to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Listen, church, it may look like sir &gt;&gt; that people of the world build their families and they conduct their lives differently and better than we do. &gt;&gt; Oh God, it may look like that the pattern of the world is the way to go. &gt;&gt; But that's not our pattern. God didn't call us to that. It may work for some nominal churches. It may work for some places, but it doesn't work for the people of God. &gt;&gt; It would work maybe in Damascus, they never have any trouble. But Jerusalem, God wouldn't stand for it. &gt;&gt; If you fast forward 150 years or so, the temple had been destroyed &gt;&gt; by the Babylonians because of their idolatry and unbelief. And Ezekiel is taken in captivity. In Ezekiel chapter 43, he's taken into captivity. God showed him what all they were doing in the temple. Why they fell? &gt;&gt; Why they ended up where they were at because they started following the pattern of everywhere else instead of the pattern the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. You can pattern your life so much around social media and not even realize you're doing it. &gt;&gt; Because you just consume so much of it. &gt;&gt; You can pattern your life around television until you just don't even realize what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Huh? And our kids even end up thinking, well, we're going to go out and and and move in with somebody, live with them because that's what they've seen. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; but that's not the pattern of the word. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Right. We don't do those things. &gt;&gt; We want to stay with the pattern. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us today. If you'll stay with the pattern, young man, if you'll stay with the pattern and wait to kiss that girl until you come to the altar, &gt;&gt; God will bless your marriage. &gt;&gt; It'll make a difference in your life. You young ladies, if you'll follow the pattern and not let that boy get too close to you, I don't know why I'm saying this this morning, but you just follow the pattern. Be just as close to the word as you can be. Follow the pattern. You said, "Well, so and so didn't do it, and they were okay. And so and so, let's follow the pattern just as close as we can." &gt;&gt; Yes, there's grace. Yes, there's mercy. But there's a value in following the pattern &gt;&gt; of God's word. something great about it, &gt;&gt; man. If you'll treat your wives the way God showed us in the pattern, &gt;&gt; things our homes will be a whole lot different. &gt;&gt; If we'll love our wives as Christ loved the church, it'll make a difference. If we conduct our we discipline our children, not the way somebody told us to, not the according to our own family tree, but the way God put it in the Bible, it make a difference. What is it? according to the pattern. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It shouldn't be just our services, but our whole lives. He said, "I can't dwell in a temple made of stone. I want to dwell in a house of flesh, &gt;&gt; a redeemed temple." And Ezekiel was shown the pattern after all the destruction. And the spirit took him up. He said in verse 5, Ezekiel 43:5 brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house. And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house. And the man stood by me. He said unto me, son of man, the place of my throne, the place of the souls of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. What's he doing? Showing a pattern again. &gt;&gt; Showing what God wanted again. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. These aren't dos and don'ts. These aren't rules. These aren't This isn't a book of rules. It's not legalism. Listen, if you rule run a church by legalism, somebody's going to fail. &gt;&gt; And it's probably going to be the one making the rules, &gt;&gt; right? You start measuring things and and trying to make things everything just be exactly right. But what pattern do we want you to follow? Not the pattern of the pastor. Not even the pattern of the church. Follow the pattern of the word. Get a revelation of what God brought in this day. revelation of the message of the hour. Follow that pattern. I've told parents, you may not want to necessarily do exactly as I've done with my children. I got good children. They've stayed in the house of God and love the Lord, and I appreciate that with all of my heart, but don't do just what I've done. You do what the word says to do. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. He said that I will dwell in the midst of the children forever and their the house of Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places. Look at that the vivid language that he uses. He said in their setting of their threshold by my threshold. &gt;&gt; So God said I had a way to build it and they just changed the plans. their post by my post. The wall between me and them. Oh, church. They thought they were building a wonderful place of worship. And they actually built a wall. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm going to worship the way I want to. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm not going to submit to the word of God." Do you realize what you're doing? You're actually building a wall between you and the holy place. You're building a wall between you and the presence of God. I say, "Let's tear down those walls today and do it the way the word says do it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "They set the wall between me and them. They have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they've committed. Wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. &gt;&gt; Now let them put away their whoredom and the carcasses of their kings far from me. I will dwell in the midst of them forever. Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel." All &gt;&gt; right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to show them. I want you to tell them. Build a pattern with your words. Tell them &gt;&gt; what it ought to be like." &gt;&gt; And let them measure. They may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure the pattern. And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comingings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, all the ordinance thereof, all the forms, and the laws, and write it on their sight. They write it in their sight that let me keep the whole form thereof. All the ordinances thereof and do them. &gt;&gt; See, God will only dwell in a temple patterned after what he had in his mind. He said, "If you'll come back to me and let me show you the pattern, if you'll do it, &gt;&gt; I'll dwell in it." &gt;&gt; Now listen, Paul tells us this. See, he has a pattern for us as an individual. In 1 Corinthians 6:18, he said, "Flee fornication." Now, why is this why is that's sexual sin outside of sexual things outside of marriage? Excuse me for being plain, but it's an age when we kind of have to be. &gt;&gt; But every sin that a man doeth is without the body. But he that committh fornication sinnth against his own body. &gt;&gt; What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you? Would you have of God? You are not your own? So he gives us a reason. He doesn't just say don't do that. &gt;&gt; He says this is why &gt;&gt; don't commit fornication because that's a sin against the body. &gt;&gt; You are bought with a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore glorify God in your body &gt;&gt; and in your spirit which are gods. See we cannot be the temple of God living in sin. And we cannot be his temple by dogma or by creed, by works &gt;&gt; or by opinions. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. See, my opinions are not worthy. &gt;&gt; David could have said, "Well, I'm going to I think this is pretty good, Lord, but I'm going to add this little corner, &gt;&gt; add a little closet, &gt;&gt; right? And we I'll just bring the materials myself, and they'll be fine." But see, David's opinion &gt;&gt; wasn't good enough &gt;&gt; to be included in the pattern. Come on. &gt;&gt; Solomon's opinion wasn't sufficient. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. My opinion is not sufficient &gt;&gt; to be included. Your opinion is not sufficient to be included in the tab, in the pattern. It must be the word of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen, Colossians 2:16 tells us, he said, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink &gt;&gt; or in respect of a holy day or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days." In other words, if somebody comes along and says, "You need to be keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, you need to be eat, you know, not eating pork." &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Don't listen to that." &gt;&gt; Right? Unless you just want to not eat pork for reasons of health. Like that's fine. &gt;&gt; But I'd rather enjoy my life. &gt;&gt; But look, he said, "Don't let any man judge you or the new moon or the Sabbath days." Because they had all kinds of feasts and festivals and you know if they saw somebody step outside their house on a certain day like got him. &gt;&gt; Paul said don't let people do that to you. &gt;&gt; Right. So, what's he saying now? There are things we've been left to do, but leave it at that. &gt;&gt; He told us to honor the resurrection, &gt;&gt; go to church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Every time we possibly can, he said, "Every time the doors are open, every time we possibly can, &gt;&gt; right? Go to church." But that's not what makes us a Christian, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't let any man begal you of your reward." &gt;&gt; Come on. Other words, don't in the in in our modern language, let no man defraud you of your prize &gt;&gt; by telling you to fast on certain days, voluntary humility, worshiping of angels, &gt;&gt; worshiping an intermediary instead of Christ, &gt;&gt; intruding into those things which he hath not seen. In other words, a man who's not a prophet, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; comes and tells you, "This is what you have to do on a certain day." &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. And you know what I'm talking about this morning, &gt;&gt; brother. The Bible says don't do it. &gt;&gt; Don't let him steal you of your prize. See, we're supposed to do what we do as a voluntary service. &gt;&gt; It's not a forced worship. It's not, well, everybody's going to have church at the same time and everybody's going to do this at the same time. That is not what God called us to do. &gt;&gt; But he's called us to be to to voluntarily want to get together to to have a have a heart full of praise and worship God out of the depths of our heart. Right. &gt;&gt; Let no man defraud you of your prize. Am I telling you to f fast on certain days or worship certain people? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; See, the false teacher makes his own walls, builds his own temple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God said, "I won't have no part in it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just cuz somebody told you that somebody told them that somebody told them that Brother Brandham said something. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Make sure it's in the pattern. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Before you start doing it &gt;&gt; or forcing other people to do it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He said, "Don't defraud yourself of your prize." &gt;&gt; He said, "Not holding the head." There's the problem. They're not connected to the word. Not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of God. Their headship is not Christ. He said, "Wherefore, if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why as though living in the world are you subject to ordinances? Touch not, taste not, handle not, which are all all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men. But things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship. Will worship. Mark that in your minds. Humility, neglecting of the body, not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh. So other words, acting humble, fasting, and letting everybody see you fast and going around with a long face all the time. How spiritual that you are. He said, don't do that, but let it be something from the heart. And will worship he said what is here term will worship signifies this is a commentary but I thought it was good. It signifies simply a mode of worship which a man chooses for himself independently of the revelation which God has given. So will worship is independent of revelation. Worship by desire instead of revelation. Like Cain worshiped by desire. Abel worship by revelation. I'm hurrying to finish so we can get done today in time. He said we must worship God. See, in Christ, the pattern that God said, even for Abel was blood. How many know that today? &gt;&gt; You ain't getting by any other way. You young people, it's going to take a birth. That God's got to come down and live in you. It's got to be a washing away of your sins. You can't just come in and be a part of the church. You got to be born again. &gt;&gt; That's the pattern that God said. The pattern was blood. The pattern always will be blood. &gt;&gt; No substitute will work. Right? &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus stood there with Peter and John and they stood there on the Peter and James and John and they stood there on the on the mountain. He was transfigured in front of them &gt;&gt; and and they see Moses and Elijah come down. Remember and Peter said, "Let's build a a temple." &gt;&gt; In fact, let's build three temples. &gt;&gt; That was Peter's opinion. &gt;&gt; But look at God's opinion, &gt;&gt; right? Anybody can have their opinion of how we ought to worship. What was God's opinion? While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud was said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him." He speaks the same thing today. When men set up their denominations in their tabernacles, God said, "This is my house. This is what I want. I want the the depths of your heart. I don't want to worship out of force. I don't want to worship out of some idea somebody had or some opinion. I want to worship that comes from the heart." Right. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; How many want to build God a house? &gt;&gt; And you realize you are the house of God. You said, "Lord, let me let me let you build your house within me. Let let me let you take over my life. Take over the works of my life." He's not satisfied until we follow the pattern. And when we follow the pattern of Acts 2:38, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. That's when he comes down to dwell in his temple. I want to just take a few minutes. We have become his temple by the Holy Ghost. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; you're the temple of God? Paul says, "Know you not that you're the temple of the Holy Ghost?" How should we worship in that temple? How should we worship? The Bible says, "God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. by inspiration and by letter. &gt;&gt; Right? Now look, what was the pattern? Now look, whenever the people came to the temple of God, they were not just to come any old way &gt;&gt; to the house of God. Do you know how they came? Some of y'all are going to look sideways at me. I can see it already. Preparing myself for it. &gt;&gt; You know how they came? Singing and shouting. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? That's right. &gt;&gt; They come to the house of God, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Singing and shouting, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And God says, "I want that kind of worship, &gt;&gt; but I want it to be voluntary." &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But it's singing and shouting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's how we ought to come. &gt;&gt; That's what he told us. Now, when Ezra began to rebuild the temple, the people saw just the foundation of it. Remember, Ezekiel saw the pattern. What did they do? They went back and built a temple according to the pattern. And in Ezra chapter 3 and 10, it says, "When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets." So they said, "Okay, we got a foundation now. Let's have church." I like that. I know. You know, we've always we're always looking at at doing things and and helping out, make sure we have enough room and things for our congregation coming on and all our children and things. We're always looking to the future. &gt;&gt; But listen to what they said. They said, "We got a foundation now. Let's have church." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I think we're there this morning, church. &gt;&gt; We got a good foundation. Let's have church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, they come to the house of God and they saw the foundation. The builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord. And they sent the priests with the trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaf, with symbols. The sons of Asaf were drum players. &gt;&gt; You'd argue with the scriptures. Right. &gt;&gt; They they if I had regular symbols back here, I'd go, "Oh, they do make noise. &gt;&gt; But the sons of ASAP were drum drummers." &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Right. But that they were doing it for the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. And they come in with the symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David, &gt;&gt; king of Israel. &gt;&gt; So they said, "David didn't just show us how to build the house. &gt;&gt; He didn't just tell us." Hallelujah. How to set it up. But in every time the temple was set up, he also orchestrated the worship in the temple to be in a certain way. And the Bible says that they sang together by course. So it's okay to sing in the house of God &gt;&gt; and do it harmoniously and by course. Other words, to have order to it, &gt;&gt; and giving thanks unto the Lord because he's good. for his mercy endureth forever towards Israel and all the people &gt;&gt; shouted with a great shout &gt;&gt; when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you say well if I see God lay a foundation I'll shout just hang on a minute but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men &gt;&gt; that had seen the first house &gt;&gt; when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes &gt;&gt; wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy sir &gt;&gt; so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy and the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout the noise was heard a far off listen those those men wept they wept because they remember the glory of the former temple but they also wept because they saw the new temple coming out in their mind's eye they could it was just a foundation but they could see the beginnings of it they could see it start to build &gt;&gt; so they sang and they shouted and they wept. They sang and shout because that was the pattern. &gt;&gt; Listen to Psalms 100. Make a joyful noise of the Lord all you land. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with &gt;&gt; you see. We You thought we just had a song service just out of a form &gt;&gt; and it didn't matter if we actually worshiped or not. &gt;&gt; But the pattern was &gt;&gt; to come to the house of God &gt;&gt; and sing. say, "Well, I'm not a good singer." Brother Ryan, sing anyway. Right, Brother Ryan may be a good singer, buddy. I don't know. But if you're not a good singer, sing anyway. &gt;&gt; In congregational worship, you may never sing a special, &gt;&gt; but sing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're coming into his presence. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know there's some people that come to church to be entertained. I never like to just be entertained. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be part of it. I want to lift my hands in the house of God. I want to enjoy the presence of God. &gt;&gt; God, help us to, you know, that should be a part of us. I know some people are shy and some people are different. Some people are quiet and that's fine. God has all kinds of oddly cut stones. We'll get into that maybe at a later date that he built the temple with. All kinds of people that are different in their ways and things, but yet we can do something. We can lift our voice during the song service. We can clap our hands. We can raise our hands. We can do something. We can sing and we can shout because we're coming before his presence. &gt;&gt; Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is he that has made us not. We ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving. Into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name. What does it mean in the scripture to bless his name? In Proverbs, I'm getting so sidetracked this morning. In Proverbs, it says that if you go to your neighbor's house and bless him loudly, &gt;&gt; he'll get offended with you. That's the Benuit translation of it. Did you know the Bible says that &gt;&gt; and you say, "Well, I bless the Lord, but I do it quietly." Well, your neighbor wouldn't be offended if blessing was quiet. &gt;&gt; But if you go to your neighbor's house and bless him in the morning, said he'll get upset. But if you go to God's house and bless his name, what does that mean? Lift up your voice. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This pattern was in the first temple and the second temple. It was in the alpha bride, the omega bride. &gt;&gt; See, Paul says, "Wherefore, be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is." &gt;&gt; Don't just worship by your own will, but by the will of the Lord. Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. I know a lot of people read that verse and say, "Well, praise God. I can sing and make melody in my heart. That's true. &gt;&gt; We ought to do that all the time. &gt;&gt; But look at the next verse. Giving thanks always &gt;&gt; for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. So it's not just when you're by yourself, but when you're in the congregation, worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that that that melody in your heart might bless you, but it didn't bless me any. &gt;&gt; Right. Right? That's like speaking in tongues at home. That's good. You realize there's a heavenly language. Am I going to get myself in trouble call you might call me a Pentecostal, &gt;&gt; but the Bible says there's a heavenly language. Brother Brandham taught us that, &gt;&gt; right? You can speak in tongues in your prayer closet, &gt;&gt; but that don't help the church a bit, &gt;&gt; right? And if you come do it in the church, just interrupt the service. That don't help the church a bit. &gt;&gt; You were blessed. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Right. But the church wasn't blessed by it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But if prophecy could be given, it'd be a blessing because the church could understand it. Right? &gt;&gt; If you just pray in your heart, it don't help nobody else. &gt;&gt; If you just worship in your heart, that don't help the person beside you. And it's not wrong to do that, right? I'm not criticizing you this morning. That's part of it. But you need to understand that's not all of it. There needs to be something on the outside expressing what you feel on the inside. And if you don't feel that way about him, I think we need to get closer to him. Find out who he really is. Begin to read the word of God and study who he is. and you'll begin to worship him because you'll recognize I was a sinner. I needed help and he brought me out of the out of the deep miry clay. He lifted my feet up on a solid rock to stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was the pattern. Listen. And this pattern did not start, remember the temple pattern started? This did not start with Paul. This did not start with David. This did not start with Solomon. It didn't start with Moses. But Moses saw God's temple in heaven, &gt;&gt; right? He saw the pattern of heaven. &gt;&gt; And when he saw it, what did he do? He patterned the tabernacle after it. And in that tabernacle, there were worshippers, &gt;&gt; constant worship, &gt;&gt; because we know that when Isaiah saw the he the the temple in heaven, &gt;&gt; right? He was in the temple and he and and heavens opened up. And here he sees God sitting on his throne high and lifted up, what did he hear? What did he see? And what did he hear? He saw the cherubim worshiping constantly until the posts were moved at the noise of the cherubam saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." &gt;&gt; And so the pattern was for there to be worship in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he didn't mean for us to do that." But do you believe, how many believe you were in the mind of God &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world? &gt;&gt; So that pattern was in the mind of God, right? So Job is grumbling and complaining. He had a lot to complain about. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; He had a lot to complain about. I know some of us do. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be insensitive to that. &gt;&gt; Some people go through things. That's part of life. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to dismiss that. People, there's times when you're so low you can't worship the way you want to. &gt;&gt; But you you can't stay there. &gt;&gt; Start digging yourself out of that hole. Hallelujah. Like the old story of the of the mule that fell down the pit and the farmer said, "Well, he fell down there. I don't it's not worth getting out, so I'll just throw dirt on top of him." So, he just kept throwing dirt and every time he threw dirt, the old mule just walked around and stopped stamped on it. &gt;&gt; Pretty soon, he just walked right out of the pit. &gt;&gt; So, I just said, "If the devil's throwing dirt at me, let him just keep throwing it. Pretty soon, I'm just going to walk out of the pit." He made it for me. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm going to worship God again in the house of God. Oh, church, come on. You know what it's like to be through a trial and to go through some things maybe for months and years of your life and you're in a dry season and then one day it breaks on you and something happens in your life and you raise your hands again. You say, "Lord, now I know you're with me. I can worship you in your house again. Oh, and it's worth every moment. It's worth the hard times." Job was going through that kind of a time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A very difficult time. And God finally talked to him. And he said, "Job, you've said a lot of things." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen for a little bit. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And he asked him in Job 38:4, he said, "Where were you?" &gt;&gt; Right. When I laid the foundation, &gt;&gt; remember what they did when they saw the foundation of the house of God &gt;&gt; and it was laying there and they begin to worship &gt;&gt; and Job said, God said, "Job, where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?" &gt;&gt; The earth is an attribute of God &gt;&gt; was in his mind. That's why it won't be completely annihilated. It's just renovated, &gt;&gt; right? In the new heavens and the new earth. But look, where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? &gt;&gt; There's a y'all missed that. There's a great revelation in that. &gt;&gt; You can't be annihilated. &gt;&gt; Cuz you were in his mind before the foundation of the earth. So, you got to be renovated. This was the pattern. Look, he said, "Where were you, Job?" Declare if you have understanding. Whoath laid the measures thereof? Remember, he told Moses, "This is the weight. This is how many inches, how many feet, how many cubits to make the temple?" And God tells Job, he said, "In the beginning, when I made the earth, where were you? When the foundations fastened, who laid the cornerstone thereof? When the morning stars &gt;&gt; sang together, &gt;&gt; sang. &gt;&gt; And all someone say all. &gt;&gt; The sons of God shouted. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For joy. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ben, I've never shouted in church." Oh, yes, you have. That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't remember it cuz you bypassed your theophony to come &gt;&gt; come down here and be tempted. &gt;&gt; But just like they stood there when when Ezra laid the foundation of the temple and they stood there and begin to sing and shout you &gt;&gt; in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He saw you praising &gt;&gt; worshiping &gt;&gt; shouting. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when he laid the foundations of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You worship God. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me for just a moment. This this message, you remember the model had to be there, but now the model began to be lost over the church ages. &gt;&gt; We still had the writing, but not the model. And God sent a prophet in our age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To do something. Brother Brandham whenever they would talk to him about that about the sons of God or they talk to him about people shouting in church he'd say they said what are you part of this new religion this new shouting religion &gt;&gt; and he'd say no he said I don't have a case of new religion he said I've got a case a new case of old religion &gt;&gt; oldtime religion &gt;&gt; because I when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy he said I was there &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; right and you were there in the mind of God &gt;&gt; but Zechariah Zechariah 4 and:9 &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the Bible says now Zerubbabel was a man who was the who was the governor during that time during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah Zerubabel was somebody who God had anointed &gt;&gt; right to lay the foundation and to finish &gt;&gt; the temple of God &gt;&gt; and so in Zechariah 4:9 it says the hands of Zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house &gt;&gt; his hands shall also will finish it. &gt;&gt; Now, Zachariah is encouraging him. He said, "Thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you." He's encouraging him. He said, "He laid the foundation. He's also going to finish it." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, "We know the scripture said that Jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; In other words, rebuild the church again." &gt;&gt; All right. Glory to God. Under the power of the spirit. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Not by organization, not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit, God will bring forth the church in the last days. What was he doing? He said, "The hands that laid it, the very message that he sent us, that laid the foundation will finish the building. We're going home one of these days." Listen, when you see a foundation laid, that's the time for the sons of God to shout together for joy, that's the time for the morning stars to sing together. When you see, oh church, when you see the message of the hour that it's complete and laying out there in front of us, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it's going to carry us home. Listen, musicians, go ahead and come. Paul said in Philippians 1:6, "Being confident," how many you're confident this morning, being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you, if you saw him lay a foundation in your life, if it was his hands that put it in your life, if you saw him lay a foundation, he's also going to finish the work. You can shout for for joy, even though the work's not complete yet, but you can say, "Lord, I know you're building a temple in my life. You're building a place for you to dwell, and I'm happy this morning that you chose to dwell with me." Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm in your presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He who has begun a good work in you will will [Music] he will. Brother Trip, he will perform it. He started a good work. He will. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? Every one of you. But Mike, he will perform it if he &gt;&gt; he will perform it. Are you hearing me this morning? He will. If he laid the foundation, if you're the elect of God, he will. &gt;&gt; Come on. Lord, &gt;&gt; you're his temple. He began to build you by the message of the hour. He will. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He will finish it. He will bring forth the church in the last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so thankful. Excuse me for taking a little extra time, but it's just so much on my heart this morning. He will. I believe we could shout over that. &gt;&gt; We could rejoice in the presence of God. We can lift our voice. We may not be the loudest, but let ours be a willing heart. Oh God, let me worship the way you want me to worship. Let me worship with all that I have. Hallelujah. When we have seen this message lay the foundation of restoration, we know it will also bring forth the headstone crying grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, Zerubable said I can't do it. The builders of the temple said there's no way. There's too much opposition, too many people coming against us. But he said grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace unto the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can sing and shout like they did at the foundation of the world. The grace of God. Would you bow your heads with me this morning? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He will. I just felt an urgy in my heart to tell you that this morning. He will perform it. &gt;&gt; Don't give up now. Don't give in now. He will perform. He will finish what he started. He's never built the house without counting the cost knowing that he had the material. If he called you to the message of the hour, if he's given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost, if he's filled you with his spirit, even if you're just now, maybe you're at the beginning of that journey and you're just you just felt called by God whom he has called. He calls who he chooses. He chooses who he chooses. He will glorify. We're going to get into that in Ephesians. He predestinated you. He called you. There's a reason why you feel that tug. Just surrender to it this morning. &gt;&gt; If he's begun a good work, if you've seen his hands lay the foundation, you young people, when you see the hands of the Lord lay a foundation in your life, know that he will finish the work. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be okay. I pray that it would be Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, wherever we are in our Christian journey, as I look across the audience, I know there's young people, elders, some at the very beginning, maybe some at the very end. But Lord, I know you are faithful until the end. You said you would be with us, even dwell in us, make us your temple to the end of the world. I'm so grateful for that today, Lord. Oh Jesus. Lord, I surrender to you today. I I can't build the temple myself, but I surrender to your will and to your way. Oh Lord, you have laid a foundation in my life. Finish the work, oh Lord. Finish the work, oh God, until I go by way of rapture. If the Lord if you come or by way of grave if you tar and come in the resurrection Lord finish the work. That's the cry of our heart. Lord we're not crying for a beginning. We're not even crying for a denominational form of Pentecost but our desire Lord finish the work. Oh God your hands have laid the foundation. You will also lay the cornerstone. Thank you for that, Lord. I love you. Thank you for all that you've done. Lord, you mean so much to me this morning. I don't want to just say that in front of people, but I do want to say it in front of people. I want these kids to know, Lord, that I may have been I may have made many mistakes, and I'm not a perfect person, but I know I'm forgiven. I know I'm a redeemed temple of the Lord, temple of the Holy Ghost. Help me, Lord, to worship like that, to praise you like that, to give you what you deserve. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you. We love you today. Hallelujah. In Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need prayer this morning, the altar is open. Oh God, could you make that your prayer? Lord finished the work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't we just worship him a while now? Come before his presence with singing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I bless your name, Lord. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, oh God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, I give you praise. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. You are the Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, feel free to come if you need to pray this morning. The altar's open. He's here this morning. Way. Hallelujah. Oh, yes.

Let's just lift our hands to him. Give him the fruit of our lips. Not a forced thing, but just what you have in your heart. Just tell him about it. Lord, I love you and I thank you. I worship you. There will always be more. We've seen God do so much for us lately. There will always be more things that need to be done, more miracles that need to happen. But we got people in this sanctuary this morning that are raising their hands because they've been healed, that are worshiping, that are here this morning because of healing. We know God's a healer. He's a savior. People in the building this morning, as part of that, why don't you just thank him for what he's done in your life? And as you thank him for what he's done, he'll reach down and take care of the rest of it, too. Oh, God, we bless your name this morning. We thank you, Lord, for what you've done. We thank you for our homes and for our families. We thank you for this church, Lord. Thank you for grace. Thank you for mercy. Thank you for your love, oh God. We raise our hands to you, the sanctuary. We raise our li our voices, the fruit of our lips, giving praise to your name. We bless your name, oh God. And we thank you for all that you've done. We thank you for healing. We thank you for testimonies. We thank you for grace, Lord. We thank you for your goodness, Lord, for your abundant grace. We thank you, oh God. We love you this morning in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, just to receive what you have need of this morning. He's here to give it to you. Listen, we don't look for a feeling. We look by faith. We say, "I see the foundation laid in my life, and I'm believing he's going to finish the work." God bless you this morning. Communion service tonight at 3. Joel's going to come.
