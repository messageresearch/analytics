up we would not make it another step but Lord you step in and Lord with your power you you move us or to the place where we ought to be we thank you for that today Lord if there's someone here that's not where they should be Lord maybe they they feel like a failure they feel Lord as I often do like they're just not cut out for it maybe but Lord we know that you are still God lord would you come and comfort and Lord and heal and touch Lord every heart move me out of the way Lord and speak as you only can do to your people we pray we'll love you for it we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor Jesus name amen amen First Corinthians chapter 12 we'll read verse 4 down through verse 11. just to kind of back up and and go over these verses again we don't want to lose our place [Music] he says now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administrations but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self Same Spirit and dividing to every man severally as he will amen I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated happy birthday brother bills good to see you in church on your birthday I hope you're feeling well and and uh brother Allen Allen turned 35 I think we can young enough you still can tell your age but uh that that's a you can't say you're you're uh 30 anymore you're you're near 30 because now you and I both are closer to 40. so I don't know how that make should make you feel but not good but the bill feels good though about it you made it it's another day right another Victory I guess that's what it is another Victory I'll be gone this weekend I made a commitment to try to go to this Camp every year by the Wendell's and and take my kids and I'm trying to do that with them maybe next year we'll be able to take a bus or a or a little at least a van a load of kids I'd like to get everybody involved in that it's it's pretty close uh not five or six hours over there so it'd be nice if maybe some more of us could go but that's what we're going to be doing uh this weekend brother Stewart will be here brother Joe Reynolds will be here in the evening service and then uh if I'm not back on Wednesday night but Joel would be preaching he'll be preaching either way but uh we may we may stay away for a few days I was going to tell you as well our Easter services uh this year are going to be a little different I'm going to be going to Togo the Lord willing on Easter they've asked me to preach that he's been after me for the John bedok has been after me to preach that meeting for several uh several years and we've not been able to do it and but this year it just had it on my heart to do it to go and and be a blessing to those people and I'm so glad you're a church that would let me do that and and thankful for that but what we're going to do is move our Easter services as far as the dinner I don't want to miss the dinner so we're gonna have our Easter dinner the week before Easter so remember that that's just a couple of weeks away just a few weeks away so I remember that we'll have our Easter dinner and it's like we normally would on Easter and I'll preach my Easter Sermon the week before and then on Easter Sunday we'll just have one service that Sunday and another brother will be preaching but we'll have uh we'll have that service and then you can have Easter with your family isn't God good to us don't you love this time of year amen see God moving we've been talking about the gifts we're going to talk about faith tonight and uh this this is the good part we really in I really enjoy this I enjoy studying on this I'm not doing this because of any other church or any other Ministry I'm doing this because it's the word of God and and I felt led to do it and and so we want to make that clear tonight I uh what you said brother Ben what do you preach where do you get what you preach we get it from the Bible and we get it from the message of the hour and that's the only place that we get it and we're not a denomination here in the message of the hour we we don't have anybody over us telling us what to preach I don't even tell these brothers what to preach but they just preach what's on their heart so that's what we want to do I sold out to this message a long time ago and I'm not not about to turn around I'm not about to turn back we've we have a message to preach and and whether one person shows up for a hundred we still preach the same message and whether whether uh whether the church comes or goes whatever happens people will come and go but this message stays the same because it's the message of the hour and so we're thankful for that tonight amen so now uh there's spiritual gifts that fall on the body and Paul groups these in the scriptures that we read groups them like this there's two word gifts which are wisdom and knowledge and then there are three Faith gifts which is Faith healing and miracles and then for what I call prophecy gifts which are prophecy discernment tongues and interpretation and these are spiritual gifts that fall among the body in other words when the Holy Ghost moves these gifts move in the body so what we want is for the Holy Ghost to move we're not looking for a particular gift but uh over the years the Pentecostals uh cabbage down on tongues because tongues was the most visible gift but it's also the gift that's easiest to mimic right but it is the most visible gift because you know whether or not somebody's spoken tongues you don't always know about some of these other gifts we could have these gifts in the body many of them and no one would ever know and I think it's meant to be that way in large part because of the Easter to edify the body not to vindicate a particular Ministry or a particular person let me understand that tonight that that's not what the gifts are for the gifts are not to say that I have a gift or someone else does not have a gift or we're A Gifted church and another church is not that's not what the gifts are for the gifts are given for the purpose of edification of the body and they can fall on anyone in the body male or female these spiritual gifts can fall on a male or female their their subject to the ministry of the word the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet and if their spoken gifts and we'll get more into this later but they're to be judged by two or three before given to the body so we all understand that that that's Elementary let's talk about faith tonight brother random makes a distinction distinction between this gift of faith and what he calls a direct gift direct gift and so he said faith is a gift of itself he said you may have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith so you can have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith he said just like some of you people anoint to sick and pray for them and you have a result he said that isn't a gift of healing that is a portion of Faith he said but that isn't a direct gift of healing there's only one direct gift of healing there's only one direct gift of faith there's only one direct gift of Miracles and so forth now we know that the Branham did not operate from a gift you have to give me a minute to get warmed up I'm like an old motor an old engine my voice doesn't warm up for a while but brother Branham didn't operate from a gift of faith that falls in the body but he had uh he had Faith he had there were Miracles that were worked there was many things that were done but his guest gift was different I want to highlight that again tonight now brother Branham says this he said I believe that these Ministries that we have today across the world he said one different from the other one he talks about uh looking on the television seeing Oral Roberts had a TV show he said I seen an oral praying for a little sick baby from up in Canada had a bad eye he said I believe the parents was Catholic he said brother Robertson is real way of Faith he slammed his his hand out on the little baby and prayed for it and the little baby was healed how many have ever watched an Oral Roberts prayer line uh one or two other people they're on YouTube you can go watch it it's a pretty interesting thing to watch it's completely different from Brother branham's prayer lines completely different the way that he did it he would sit in the chair and they'd bring the person up and he'd read off a card and and say well now you've said this is wrong with you and this and they prevented the people in fact in some of the movies that they put out they actually interviewed the people before they come in the prayer line and then they would come in the prayer line and then they would be healed and there was real healings that took place during that time and brother Branham said that was a gift of faith he said brother Roberts in his real way of Faith the little baby was healed he said now that's a real gift of faith that brother Roberts has and he said we know that brother Jack Coe how many of you have ever heard of Jack Coe boy there's a that's a trip if you go on YouTube and look up Jack Coe and watch his Services that's a real it's a real blessing really to watch but Jack Cole was different he had a different way he said he used to have a little anviling but the side of his desk and somebody come up with glasses on he'd take the glasses off and break them with the hammer and throw them over that's faith right and when Jack Coe would pray for somebody if you had a stomachache you didn't want to come into prayer line unless you wanted to be healed because he was going to make sure you were healed what he would do if you had a if you were hurting I'd seen a woman come up in front of him and she was hurting in her stomach and and Jack Co walked up to her and he said where does it hurt she said right here and he goes just as hard as he could in her stomach he said now he said every time I hit somebody they he said the Holy Ghost provides anesthetic so they don't feel the pain I hope so because he hit her pretty hard but he actually hit her in the stomach because he was so uh sure that she was healed right and that's the kind of faith that he had he said he'd have crutches he'd take their crutches first and and chop them up and throw them away he burned every bridge he did he destroyed the crutches destroy the wheelchair they didn't have any option but to be healed right and he said they only had one Jack Coe you know he said the world couldn't stand to at one time he said God Rest his precious Soul he certainly was a gallant man of Faith he had passed away by the time brother Branham talked about this he said one of the greatest ever seen in my life was Jack Coe he said well now he's gone to Glory today his work was finished and Satan could not have took him till his work was finished he said now there are men one different from the other altogether he said and in the ministry the Lord has given me he said most of these men were theologians great teachers and Scholars mine is not mine's more of a prophetic message he said in the way I teach Divine Healing is a work at the cross that has been completed for you I love this because this is something that lasts yeah yeah right whether brother Brandon was there or not this is still true oh my so this he's not relying on just a gift of faith but he's saying that he said Divine Healing is a work at the cross that has been completed for you and if you only just recognize it you can receive it how many believe that tonight if you'll recognize that you can receive it he said now brother Robertson these great Gallant men you say how do you place their Ministry to yours he said they're using scripture by laying on of hands he said now that's true that is a Bible Doctrine how many he knows that they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover he said but if you'll just bear with me a moment he said I want to show you that wasn't a gentile Commission Jesus Jairus said come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll be healed he said the Jews always was laying on hands everything was laying on hands he said but watch the Gentile it wasn't so he said I'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will live and he turned around and said I've never seen Faith like that in Israel he said There It Is We're supposed to be on a higher level than that was he said we're living on the close closer of the world's closer of the World's End than we were then so what brother Adam's telling us as I understand it is that we have gifts of faith we have gifts of healing and those are all in the body do we believe that those are all in the body but we live in an age where we have a higher ceiling than that right we still have those things but we have a higher ceiling and what he means what I mean by that is that we have the ability to just speak and it'll happen right this is the age of the return of the spoken word this shows the power of the word and so he said we're supposed to be living on a higher level than even they were back there so there's a higher ceiling to this listen if you need somebody to lay hands on you come and have hands laid on you if you need a gift of faith you need to find somebody that that has Faith to pray for you that's a wonderful thing I believe that God's got men and women like that today that can pray for you I believe that there's people to pray for you but there's a there's a higher way he said the Gentile way is to believe the word he said that's exactly right to recognize he said look at that Gentile and he talked about the Roman Centurion what did the Centurion say he said I'm a man under Authority and he recognized that he said if you're like me he said I can tell somebody do something they do it I don't have to do it myself so he said I don't have to have you come to my house he said speak the word speak the word only it should be healed oh what a time we live in tonight what did you say well you don't understand brother Ben what's going on in my life right now you don't understand what's happening in my family but you live in a time you can say speak the word only amen even while the word is going forth you can be healed so there we we have all these options we ought to take advantage of it if there ever was the people ought to have healing among them it ought to be us are you with me now he said what did he recognize there that every sin and every disease and everything else was under his authority just say go and it will go he said see what he did he said no that's what I'm trying to get the American people to see he said you don't have to wait for a special time he said for a certain evangelist to come through and to pray for you he said your pastor is sufficient well that we had to take that quote out of context and just put it up your pastor is sufficient he said if the pastor isn't there your neighbor is sufficient yeah I'm assuming if your neighbor's a Christian I'm not sure if my neighbor's sufficient or not but Joel's one of my neighbors so but I know I know Joel's prayer is sufficient though right because he's a Believer he said they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover those that believe right now he said if the neighbor isn't there your husband or wife is sufficient if you're sitting next to your husband or wife turn around and tell them you're sufficient you're sufficient you're sufficient what for prayer for Faith he said you're sufficient he said if there's none of them there he said just raise up your hands he's sufficient always he said just wherever you are what a promise this is how this ought to raise our faith tonight he's sufficient always just wherever you are believe it it's a finish work and that's the difference in brother branham's Ministry and these other Ministries because they advertise here's a man with a gift of healing here's a great man of God here's the man of God for the hour brother random come out and taught about the atonement and he said I couldn't heal you if I wanted to but Christ has to heal you so there was a difference there what is faith well the Bible tells us what faith is in Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so it's it's the thing that makes me sure yes that what I can't see and what I expect will happen right it makes me sure that what I expect will happen this things hoped for and it gives me an Evidence or a down payment of things I can't see but I still believe it that's what faith is now brother Brown taught us he said most people today have hope instead of faith he said you find people coming on the platform they're just built up in hopes he said but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence it's not a myth it's not imagination it's something you've got you've already got it he said and you're just as happy with it that Faith you have as you would be if you had the substance in your hand he said for instance like this if I'm starving to death and a loaf of bread cost a quarter he said which will buy the love for bread that's a long time ago I noticed Bread's about three dollars now he said but now when I have the quarter in my hand I'm just as happy as if it was the loaf of bread because it's the purchase price of the bread oh do we really believe this tonight I'm just as happy if I have the if I have the quarter as if I had the loaf of bread he said when I know in my heart that I have accepted it and I believe that God has given it to me I'm just as happy with that Faith as if I was if I was healed because I'm going to be healed anyhow I've got the substance right now nobody can take it away from me I know it's right and I can be perseverant with that I I I don't know I think I've told you before but at some point in in my life you know after I had started having children it dropped down in my heart that my children would not be lost and I can't even comprehend my children being lost the devil's going to try everything he can are you with me now he's going to try everything he can but I can't even comprehend my children not being there why because it's a settled thing God said it I believe it that settles it or if we could be that way about our healing how much what a difference that would make it wouldn't matter what our symptoms were we'd say I know I'm Healed by the power of God I know I'm saved I know you know even our Salvation the devil will work on your mind trying to tell you you're not good enough you you've done so many bad things it's not based on your works you couldn't yourself a message believer you couldn't talk your way into it don't let the devil talk you out of it you couldn't talk your way into it you are where you are and you are who you are because of the Revelation that God gave you because of the faith that you have in your heart hey man you've got the substance nobody's going to talk to you out of that can't tell me my kids aren't going to be saved because the word says different Hallelujah amen he said for by it the elders obtained a good report by faith now what is faith based on and again I'm not trying to to teach you how to have a gift of faith but to tell you what faith is so that if you if someone prayed for you with a gift of faith you would know what that is somebody who believes that's all a gift of faith is that's all faith is it's just believing and being sure and it's not a mental Faith it's not a it's not a head knowledge but it's a it's a sureness from the heart that you know listen but it's based on something it's not just Faith it's not just uh faith based on uh happy thoughts it's not faith based on things are going good right but it's based on something he said through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God I wish somebody would preach with me tonight I've never said that before but but you know through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear right so Faith tells us that the worlds were framed by the word Faith rests on the word he said notice real Faith rests upon the solid rock of the promise of God's word it doesn't shift real faith is anchored aren't you glad for an anchor Today he said like in the North Star the North Star is a typos to every shipmaster the compass points him only to that North Star he said in God the word is every Christian's North Star if you're lost he said if the holy spirit is what points you to it it won't point to nothing else all other isms and so forth and Christianity mixed up in it whatever it may be it's like the world shifting it changes those stars but it can't change the North Star neither can anything change the word of God he said anchor to it stay with it well that's what I want to do it Hallelujah he said now real Faith doesn't shift the treats and man-made doctrines and unbelief it stays right with the word real faith in the word where can you put your faith on anything else but the word you better not put your faith in a person because the person will fail put your faith on a pastor the pastor will fail put your faith on a church the church will fail put your faith in your wife your wife might fail but your faith in your husband your husband might fail but if you put your faith in the word it'll always be right it'll always be true some of you that built your faith on the word many many years ago you can look back and save my life over the decades I am what I am today and my family are is what they are today because of the faith that I put in the word not because of the faith that I put in a man because you've been failed by many men I've been failed by many people I've been a failure I've failed myself right yes but many times we fail ourselves we mess up but he will never fail the word will never fail he said it don't shift he said it stays right with the word real faith in the word it don't shift on Creeds and man-made doctrines and where can you put your faith on anything else but the word if God said it hold your finger to it he said that's true it doesn't shift it draws from God's breasted book The Bible holy New Testament amen strength giving book or do you believe it's a strength giving book tonight I still believe that it is that's why I said we preach from the Bible we preach from the message of the hour it's a strength giving word amen he said it doesn't shift it's God's breasted book The Bible his attributes what he promised he said what he promised that's his word the word produces itself glory to God he said it has to be a thought before a word then a word then the word is manifested and that's where you draw your strength from he said believing believing for the Creator believing like he was the creator that made the world oh that's a foundation for Faith isn't it now I want to spend the rest of my time and and we'll have to come back to faith when I get back because this is just way too much but and it just it just struck me as a good opportunity to look at these things and but I want to look at Abel because that's the first example that uh that Paul gives is able in Hebrews 11 4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which you obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now I got to thinking about Abel and the thought struck me he's just said that faith is in the word and then it comes to someone who didn't have the written word and he uses him as an example of faith now think about it for a moment he did not have the written word to base his faith on he didn't have anything here there was never he didn't even have a true story he hadn't been told what would happen correctly or what had happened correctly he had not been informed by his parents they had not taught him correctly about what had happened so he could not have formulated a doctrine of atonement based on what he knew right he could not figure it out he didn't have a Bible like we do to go back to to look at for an atonement yeah but there was something about it and let me say this that the atonement the blessings of God those things to us our own salvation the Bible says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and ultimately it's gonna have to be a revelation from God to you right right you may shout you may speak in tongues you may run up and down the aisles you might you might do all kinds of things but ultimately you've got to know that you're saved right and you won't know it because somebody told you that you were right but you'll know it because you come God's provided way and something in you knows that you're saved listen it can't be convinced that you're not right you might get down you might get in despair you might have trouble but there's something inside of you I know I'm a Child of God and it's got to come to that because if we talk people into this message they'll talk themselves out of it if we talk people into being Believers you two will talk them out of it the websites will talk them out of it but if God ever speaks to them directly by Revelation that they know this is what I believe this is what I am this is who I am so now it can't be just a head knowledge can't be just because I taught you right or another Pastor taught you or somebody else taught you but it's got to be I know right I know that's what we have to come to I know I don't doubt it because somebody's mean to me I don't doubt it because I something bad's happening at work and I don't say there's anyone here doubting your salvation but the Devil comes to us all at times I'll be honest with you even a prophet of God was going he said one time to church and he was listening on the radio he said they were talking about how that the world there was it was Evolution that formed the world and all these things and how many millions of years old it was he said he was driving along listening he said in a thought come in his mind could that be true he said and I've seen God I've seen the dead race but it's just the devil and many times God that Satan puts those thoughts in her mind we need to rebuke it by the word of God because we do have a written word but it's got to be a revealed word to us it's got to be something that's revealed and so there's been times where the Harvey and I were talking earlier you know we think about somebody that's on drugs or on alcohol many times someone come and speak to him and tell them to commit suicide or do something like that and they'll do it and what a tragedy that that is for somebody to follow that but but I I'm not going to take a show of hands but I would say almost every person in this building at some point in your life has had a suicidal thought and it's just the devil you don't have to listen to that you don't have to give in to that just the devil now how much more if he could do that to you being a human being you know you shouldn't take your own life you know you have a good family and you people that love you and a church family that loves you and yet and yet the devil will try to tell you that how much more is he going to try to tell you you're not saved you're not Brian you're not going to make it listen he tell he tries out on me almost every day huh does he not do it he does it every day he points to your mistakes he points to what you've been he points to your past he points to things you've actually done and he said you're not good enough but we point to the blood of Christ on Calvary we point to the cross and say I believe in my atonement not because somebody talked me into it but I have a revelation faith [Music] now God honored Abel's faith and whenever you hear somebody say well I have a revelation I I don't need the written word because I've got a revelation well it's going to line up with the written word because Abel didn't have the written word and when the word was written it lined up what he did lined up with the written word right even though he didn't have it but now because his Revelation was true God honored his faith and when the word was written it proved that what he did by Revelation was exactly what needed to be done now in Genesis 4 3 it tells us that in process of time it come to pass that Cain brought to the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord now evidently they had been taught these boys have been taught that there was a god and they'd been taught to worship their creator and they wanted they had a desire to worship their creator that desire to worship was so strong that even the serpent seed seed line could not take that out right of the heart of Cain there was still something in him wanted to worship but he had the wrong father when I watched so he didn't have a revelation now they come brother random taught us that they come to the east side of Eden you've heard brother Branham talk about it I'm sure many times they come to the east side of Eden and they actually get there to the uh to the Garden at the East Gate he said where the cherubim was that had the Flaming sword remember there was a flaming sword that was placed when Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden he put a cherubim with a flaming sword keep the way the way of the Tree of Life and brother Brown said that's where these boys came to offer because they knew they had to get back into that they had to come back into that place oh my and they're still true today so they come there to offer their sacrifice both of them wanted to make a sacrifice but their parents had left out some things out of the story of how they had fallen as we've already said now brother says Cain thought that making an antidote for sin that his father and his mother must have eat fruit as they were taught in that Garden now listen if it was fruit Cain's praise offering which is what he offered he offered a he offered an offering of worship but it wasn't an offering of an atonement right before you can offer an offering of Praise You got to offer an offering of there's got to be an offering of blood you've got to be saved right and you got to be born again and but now Cain's going to offer this by by his own mind he's thought about it and he was sincere and he thought that he could go and and offer this fruit and listen if it had been fruit that they ate that was the problem it would have worked right because that's what it was it caused the fall fruit but Abel knew better not because he was taught better but somehow he had a revelation now watch it says they were taught in the garden but Abel by divine revelation know that it was the blood that did it Genesis 4 4 and Abel he also brought her the first things of his flocking of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering I know you're thinking brother Ben you're way off of the gift of faith no that's exactly what we're talking about right yeah what's a gift something that's given to you you didn't earn it you didn't ask for it you didn't work for it because that's payment yes yes but a gift is something without us given to you and this Revelation that Abel had was not he didn't ask for it he didn't work his way into it he just had it we don't even realize how blessed We Are Tonight we don't even know how wonderful it is to know to be children of God who even want to be right to have that pressing in our soul that desire to be right that conviction that makes us want to live right and do right you don't even realize what a blessing it is he said but I messed up but you don't even realize what a blessing it is to want to be right and then to not only to want to be right but to actually have the ability to be right now look at this look how blessed we are that you can provide you can offer the right sacrifice you can die on The Altar with your lamb oh my God the privilege that you have to be able to do that it was given it's a gift gift of faith look Jehovah Abel Abel he revealed to Abel and Abel brought the first things of his flock into the fat thereof and the Bible says the Lord had respect that word means he looked with favor on Abel's offering brother Branham dramatizes he said Abel got a grapevine he said grabbed a hold of the the best sheep the first thing of his flock and he grabbed a hold of it and he pulled it bleeding to the altar because he didn't have rope you see he dragged it with a grapevine he drags it he throws it up on the altar he gets a sharp Rock and cuts its neck yeah unless the blood spill out over the over the altar and at the same time Cain has got his altar and if you had to judge between the two without spiritual Revelation you would never think that Cain was wrong and Abel was right yeah you would never believe no one could convince you if you didn't have a revelation of blood you would think why would God why would a holy wonderful God and made all this beauty want a lamb to be killed and you realize this was only the second time that anything had ever died as far as we know that we know of what was it the lamb that was killed for Adam and Eve when they walked out because he put a sheep he put lambskin sheepskins around them to cover them and then this lamb that was killed by Abel but they they must have thought why would something have to die but Abel just had a revelation he didn't understand it he didn't try to figure it out sometimes we overthink Church yeah yeah I'm just preaching to you tonight and we won't take very long but we overthink Church well if there's 400 people there then I'll be ready to have church or are certain people sing we can have church certain people pray we can have church and there's certain people there we can have church we overthink Church if you come to church tonight and you just come the way Abel did I don't understand why I'm doing what I'm doing but I just want to worship God tonight I don't even know I'm lifting my hands I don't even understand there's just something inside of me that cries out to God he didn't even have a church order but he knew what to do by faith by faith he offered a correct sacrifice that's what we need church not people picking at one another fighting and fussing with one another but faith become an offer before God the right kind of sacrifice amen well oh my I love this brother said what was it amen he said spiritually minded by election I hope you catch that Abel was spiritually minded by election knowing that the Earthly things doesn't please God he offered life and blood what did it speak of some four thousand years from then the Lamb of God with the Rope around his neck was led away to Calvary and Jehovah smiled at him he found favor the Bible doesn't say how but brother Branham tells us gives us a little insight into that both of those boys somehow knew that Abel's sacrifice was favored and brother Brandon puts it this way he said how did Cain when he made an altar just as pretty or prettier than Abel's he offered fruits to give his tithes he brought his income into the house of the Lord and trust me I'm not preaching against ties tonight that is not my purpose but he brought his ties into the house of the Lord he knelt on the altar he bowed himself he prayed he worshiped just as sincere as any man but God Vindicated Abel by consuming his sacrifice Hallelujah the same way that he Vindicated Elijah what was it the fire from heaven came down and consumed his sacrifice God Vindicated Abel by consuming his sacrifice God vindicates you today and he vindicates me for the same thing he vindicates that our faith is right by the fire of the Holy Ghost coming in and consuming all the atmospheres of our life consuming the desires of sin consuming those things listen if you haven't had that Firefall you need to go back and make sure that you have a real revelation of Faith because if you really have a revelation of faith that if you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when you do it burns up every other desire are you hearing me tonight that's why brother Branham taught us that's why some people can't live the Christian Life they've just never come to that place because you come to that place yeah sure you'll see you're still flesh because of a sticky nature you'll still fall but there's something inside of you that won't let go something inside of you that'll come in and take over if you just yield to it see God vindicates the New Birth by the fire of the Holy Ghost it says about verse 5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth in his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why aren't thou we're off and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him again remember Abel had no written word to be able to do it right Cain was told how to do it and still couldn't do it he had an example of what to do and if he'd have done it he could have been saved right God's telling him but God knew he wouldn't because he was the wrong seed you understand so God knew that he wouldn't do it but he could have because God said if you do well you'll be accepted he still would not he refused to do it even though he knew Abel had no written word had no God never spoke to him and told him as far as we know he never told him anything about it but by Revelation he just did what God required Listen by revelation of the word I'll be just a few more minutes he said by revelation of the word God's word before it was even written Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which testified he was righteous the word reflecting itself through him by his offering isn't that what you want tonight that's what I want the word to reflect itself through me so we find then that this gift of faith lined up with the word Abel by Revelation what was he doing he this this faith that he had caused him to look forward to a Time when that cherubim wouldn't be standing there no more because it's sword the fiery sword had been quenched you realize that's we're living in that time Abel had to look forward to that time but we're living in that time because he promised in Revelation 2 7 he promised that he would give to eat the him that overcometh well I give to eat of the tree of life we read that he reached slain but what does that mean it means the way has been opened back up it means that the cherubim's Flaming sword has been extinguished it's been cheap brother bouncer what a thrilling thought this is that tree of life in the Garden of Eden which could not be approached sent to because of the fall of Adam is now given to the Overcomer the Flaming sword of the guarding cherubim has been sheathed but it was not sheath there its blood was Bloody with the blood of the Lamb he took his flaming sword and he quenched the fire of it with his own blood oh my God Hebrews tells us that it's not possible the blood of Bolson of ghosts should take away sins now watch both boys Cain and Abel had faith in us to come and worship both had Faith to make a sacrifice but only Abel had faith in the atoning blood of the Lamb it matters what you have faith in but we are not come to the old Covenant aren't you glad of that aren't you glad we're not living under the law quit beating yourself up for not living the law nobody ever has if you could do it you'd be the first one right you'd be the very first one if you could do it we talked about dress Sunday afternoon and these things it's not that's not a a litmus test well if you're saved you know to be saved you're going to have to come jump through all these hoops that's not what it is at all we want to please God we we want to do we want to live the word of God it's a revelation to us we want to do it nobody sit there with a club and made Abel go to church that day nobody sat there and made him do it no what did he do he went and pulled the Lamb by his own volition his own free will he come up there but it really wasn't it was really the revelation of God the election of God that made him come you come to church tonight by your own free will or so you thought but really it was a revelation of God that dragged you to the house of God Amen so you can die on your altar Hallelujah and Christ could live hey man we've come to a different Mountain we've read all this before in Hebrews 12 24 he said we've come to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant to the blood of sprinkling to speaketh better things than that of Abel he said by faith Abel's blood spoke but now by faith this Blood speaks better things he said so then if the worshiper under the law could not be purged because if the lamb was only a shadow and he went away with the same desire yet it was speaking correctly to the right lamb coming he said then when God sent his lamb and he died and the worshiper then coming putting his hands by faith how can we do that today upon the bleeding locks of the Lord Jesus and can in your heart now listen to me closely as we get ready to close in your heart appreciate that he was the only thing that could ever come and redeem you oh my good we do this tonight husband you don't know what I've been through today put your hands on the bloody locks of Jesus put your hands on Jesus on him who has died for you and recognize amen and realize that he's the only one who could ever do it oh my if you can appreciate in your heart he was the only one who could redeem you you'd be lost and gone to hell and then to appreciate his love for you when you were unlovable Hallelujah appreciate his foreknowledge of you that you'd have a heart to do it right glory to God appreciate his leading of the Holy Spirit to bring you to that place to accept it and you lay your hands upon Him by faith and renounce your own life as a sinner and accept his life instead the blood of Jesus Christ then cleanses you I thought of his brother David you know some some of us have had we've had trouble in the past and our families and and family trees that weren't the greatest and I thought about that I and I thought bless the Lord I'm just like Abel was Abel had trouble in his family tree there was adultery in his parents home there was all kinds of trouble but he was not bound by that he had a revelation he didn't quit the message and go run off somewhere else but what did he do he stayed right with it why because he was he had a revelation of the word of God it was election in his heart here I want to tell you tonight I got to close but I want to tell you I'm only here by the election of God I'm only here because God called me I'm not here because I wanted to be I'm not here because I willed myself to be I'm not here because I stuck it out or I was stubborn enough to do it but I'm here because of the grace of almighty God that called me to be here and the message is true in spite of what people make it to be brother Brown puts it this way he said I'd be a very discouraged man if it wasn't for election get your eyes off people yeah people are going to be people Proverbs says where there's oxen there has to be stalls cleaned paraphrasing people are people but God is still God and you've got a revelation tonight you you appreciate what he did for you you appreciate you lay your hands on him by faith renounce your own life as a sinner and accept his life instead the blood of Jesus Christ then cleanses you yes and the life that was in the blood cell of Christ which was none other than God himself the Holy Spirit comes back into your life and coincides with your body and you act and walk a Christian Life till the day you leave the world and the devil couldn't touch you if he had to power to God that's the result of Faith that's what faith will do that's a gift of faith Hallelujah the devil couldn't touch you if you had to amen every promise in the book is yours where do we get that Faith it's a gift from God oh my we we don't look at that and say well I you know I I'm all confused no you just accept it yes it's a gift these gifts come Among Us and I'm not doing this to promote gifts by the way that's not why I'm preaching this I want us to understand what it is what a prophet taught about it so that if it did come it would be right it'd be in order and things would be right but listen listen I believe these gifts are in the body but if it comes we should just accept what God gives right if it's right then God gave it we should just accept it right make sure it's right but if it is we should just accept it we should just believe it we should say Lord I believe you spoke right for me amen the Bible tells us musicians go ahead and come the Bible tells us by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Hallelujah not of work since any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them would you bow your heads with me I wonder if you've got a need tonight you'd like to make known by way of uplift today and while I'm standing here though devil put a some type of cramp in my leg I'm not hardly even able to stand here but I believe he's my healer tonight maybe you've got something in your body something God bless those hands something that you like to pray about amen let's just pray together could we do that Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you Lord we thank you
