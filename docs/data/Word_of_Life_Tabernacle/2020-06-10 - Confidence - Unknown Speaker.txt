may the great love of the Holy Spirit come and settle down at every Buick know Lord that you've been with us and he promised to lead us and guide us more to be with us into the end of the agency we believe that you're here today doing god bless you what a blessing it is to be in the house of the Lord once again yeah proverbs chapter 14 and verse 26 we'll read that one verse of scripture and you can have your seats proverbs 14 and 26 it says in the fear of the Lord as strong confidence strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge man do we believe that tonight strong confidence that's what we want I pray Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated there's a story that's told of Alabama football coach Bear Bryant that one time he was out shooting ducks and after about three hours there comes one duck flying over where they were at he takes a shot at it and just keeps flying and Bear Bryant turned around to the man that was with him and said he said John he said you're witnessing a genuine miracle he said their fly is a dead duck now that's confidence he was just sure he'd hit him you know and I think when we get to shooting at the devil we need to be sure that we hit him we need to have confidence that we were able to to make the shot true and whatever we do in our lives and so as to begin to think on this I I thought and maybe for myself tonight and maybe it'll apply to you as well that we need to have confidence in what we're doing what we're called to do and we need to have confidence in who we are and and first of all as I've looked at this we need to have confidence in God and also we need to have confidence in the Word of God that it's true and we need to also have confidence in ourselves that we are children of God and if we have that then we it's not a confidence that's misplaced because if you put confidence in the flesh your confidence will always be misplaced it'll always you always cause you to be become bitter and become unstable because men will fail the arm of flesh will always fail but God never fails and we're so thankful for that because God is His Word and if he never fails his word never fails as I began to look at these things I realized that there was some men in the Bible that had confidence in God such confidence that they could do things beyond the ordinary and when they were doing these things they actually had such confidence that they could believe that God was who he said he was and also believed that he would keep his word and believed that they were the ones that were to do that and so I picked three and you could pick many more about I looked at the lives of Abraham Moses and Paul - from the Old Testament one from the New Testament and I found that first of all they had to have confidence in God and in order to do that they had to have faith in God because it says without faith it is impossible to please God and Hebrews 11:6 he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so in order to have confidence in what he does you have to have confidence in who he is and the best way that I could explain to you about how to have confidence in God is to meet God right Buster could if you never met him you you don't really know that he exists somebody told you he exists but you never really know until you met him for the first time so if you're if you've never met him and as I begin to look at the lives of these men I realized they had confidence in in God it's Abraham will take him first that he had confidence that God existed and that he was powerful enough to do what he promised but first he had to meet God and when you look at that as I've always looked at Abraham it talks about how Abraham was heard the voice of God and he listened to God and he left his country where he was but he had to meet God and acts seven and to Steven under inspiration is speaking and he tells us a little more of the story of Abraham he said men and brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran so he says it wasn't just an abstract thing that Abraham hears a voice excuse me but Abraham actually heard from God but he actually met God too so that says the God of glory and what that is is just Shekinah the Jews that he was speaking you would understand that Abraham meant that that visible presence of God what we would call the pillar of fire he met God the God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran and so it wasn't just an abstract thing he believed in God because he met God and then we could go to Moses in Exodus chapter 3 in verse 2 it says the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush this was that visible presence of God again he says he appeared to him out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed so we find then that Moses had to come to a journey in his life and we find up to this point that he was a failure but he had to reach a point where he actually met God and then we find Paul in Acts chapter 9 and verse 3 it says as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and he heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul why persecutest found me he finally got to meet it and once he had met him he couldn't deny who he was he couldn't deny his existence are you with me now now brother Branham goes into this in some depth and how we have to meet God he said man that's ever born of the Spirit of God meet something that he never gets away from you never gets away from you and brother balance that there's no man got a right to preach the gospel until first he's been on the sacred sands of the backside of the desert there's theologians in this world that smart and shrewd and can explain everything away take everything away he said even a whole Bible they might twist your mind and everything else but if you've ever let God coming to your heart Foley and get the backside of the desert experience then brother all Devils out of hell can't come on that ground he said it's something that's real you met God yourself you can't tell me I can tell you my my father has passed on I can tell you about my dad but you never met him and so you all you know it's what I tell you about it but if you met him you know you know what his character was you know what his life was you know what he stood for you met him Oh church if you could only realize that's what we need to with God you say well how do we get people to come to church how do we get people to do things that are right I don't meet God if you meet God if you meet me you'll forget me but if you ever meet God you won't ever forget it we can introduce them to everything else but if they never get introduced to Christ then they'll go away and they'll continue to be what they always were but now he said if you've ever let God to come into your heart fully he said that that's something real and brother Branham again he says no man has the right to preach the gospel and then he says no person has the right to call themselves a Christian until they can go back to a certain time in their life where they could come on that sacred sands at the backside of the desert where they know that they have met God you say well that's just brother Brandon saying that that's what the Bible teaches we have to meet God not just meeting a church not just meeting a preacher or a prophet meeting God he said all the infidels in the world and these intellectual Giants taking the Bible and explaining away all the days of miracles past there's no such thing as divine healing all this stuff like speaking with tongues interpretation of towns gifts of healing the baptism of the holy spirit they can wear the brown said they can slip in take your mind and twist you in such a way until they can take that away from your memory are you with me so I could teach you to a place about this message that you would believe it with your mind but another person could come in with more intellectualism and twist that and take it away from your memory but if I could ever get you to meet the one that I met and that's why brother Brown tells young preachers he said if you don't know anything else to preach tell them how the fire got lit because if you could ever meet the man that I met oh my then you'd be well if you could ever meet that man if you could ever come on those sacred sands he says but they can slip in and take your mind twist you in such a way until they can take that away from your memory they can explain it away but the brown says I want you to get this note you never let it pass from you but if a man's ever stood on that sacred sand at the backside of the desert when he meets God face to face there's not enough Devils in hell that could take that away from him he knows he met God he knows he had an experience he talked to God you could tell me your brother penis you know that didn't mean anything but to me I talked to God you weren't there I was there it was just me and God but I talked to God I want my kids to be able to meet God like that I want this church I want us all to be able to meet God like that if you haven't already met him let's meet him tonight he's here he's available he's ready to meet you he knows he met God he said he knows he had an experience he talked to God regardless of what the opposition is he can say from that time something changed in me and it may not have been the same because if you look at these experiences that Abraham had in that Moses had that Paul had each one them was unique in how they met God and if you tried to take Abraham and take that over to Moses and Moses and take that over to Paul there's there's completely different scenarios but the same light the same God that they meant now he said from that time something changed in me and brother Branham says how well I can call the time he said in a little old saloon that it being used as a church we said were some color people with preaching the gospel I loved the way God did this my brother Branham tells the story about a man and wanted to be saved and and he asked his hired hand how to be saved because he knew he was a Christian and the hired hand man took him up to he was the owner of the farm and took him up into the hayloft where's all the nice say he said maybe I could get it up here he said no he said no he can't get it up here he took him down in the barn and where it was nice and and everything was cleaned up he said maybe we get it here he said no and he laid him out in the middle of the hog pen when the mud was up to his knees and he said oh I don't think I want it here he said then you don't want it this is where you get it and so brother Brown said I was a southerner and didn't like colored people he said in the vision came and told me where to go find it he said all the white girls that I went with not all of them four or five standing there said Billy you're not going in there I said yes I've got to go said don't ever ask me for another date he said it didn't make any difference I meant God and from that time I've been changed can point back to that time I was changed brother Branham had God had to lead him into a black church think about it for a moment he said from that time I changed sometimes God got to get you out of your comfort zone shake things up a little bit sometimes the you know he's been shaking things up it feels sometimes like you're in a dryer and you just keep tumbling along tumbling around like that pair of tennis shoes that you throw in the dryer and you can hear it that's the way you feel sometimes but God's gonna shake you up so that he can get your attention he said from that time he said I've been changed and he said no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's knelt on those sacred sands back there in the presence of that pillar of fire and heard the voice of God speak to him he said you know the religions today can explain it all away and this happened and that's gone this is for another age and this but a man that's ever met God face to face and talked to him there's no scientist no devil or nothing else can come on that sacred sound sacred ground he was there when he met God he knows what he's talking about is no need of anybody else trying to tell him he said well that's pretty good for a preacher but listen to this quote this is in future home in 1964 brother bana said no man no person so no man no person no woman boy girl that about covers it he said I don't care who he is it's fit to go in the pulpit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost he said you have no right to the Lord's Supper communion Fit washing or anything until you've been cleansed by the holy fire of God that's pretty strong in it she's gotta meet God you've gotta meet God he said no man has a right to preach unless you like Moses meets him out there on those sacred grounds that pillar of fire hanging there where he knows where he's at what is it it gives you confidence in God I'm manic Abraham said I met him in his glory Moses said could say I met him in the burning bush and Paul could say I met him on the road to Damascus so I can have confidence in who he is and based on the fact that he is he exists he's real I know that he's real then I know he can keep his word see you've got to have confidence in the Word of God if you believe that he is God you've got to also believe that in his right and his word has to be true if his word is not true he's not God because it's impossible for God the kind of God that we understand to lie God can't lie God can't tell an untruth you can't tell a half truth God tells the truth and everything that comes out of his mouth it's true and not only true but will come to pass so in in Genesis 12 for were find again with Abraham that Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and so the fact that he had met God caused him to obey the Word of God and I think that's a problem we've got today because a whole lot of people that claim to have met God won't obey the word if you don't obey the word then you didn't meet God obedience to the word brother branham said even entitles you to the token right and so you got to be able to believe the Word of God and then follow the Word of God so Abram did what the Lord spoken to him and then we find that he was it was said of him by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went let me explain to you and something that I've seen over the years that and you've seen this - if you'll think about it if you've been around for very long if you want to be blessed by God obey the word just obey the word it's not so much being blessed in figuring out what parts of the word that you don't understand but obey what we understand if there's something there and you see it you just walk in it you just walk in it you just keep walking in you just keep obeying the word and when you start obeying the word fully and it may be something little it may be something that doesn't seem like it has any consequence at all but when you start obeying God in this little thing God begins to bless you because you're now moving under that it station of obedience to God you can come fully in the will of God but before you do that you actually whenever you disobey God you bring yourselves out from under that protection and that blessing when you obey God as Abraham did it gives you rights and it gives you confidence and we'll talk about that a little bit more but it gives you confidence in God that he'll keep his word now we can have confidence in a lot of people but and we're going to talk about in a moment but you're better off to have confidence in what God has done in your life if you can see God and so many times we see what God does in somebody else's life and we see that it's a wonderful thing and it inspires us if we seek God heal the sick if we seek God do what he promised he would do it gives us inspiration we believe God can do that again don't we we believe if he's done it before he can do it again but what if he does it for you see if he does it for you then you have confidence so much confidence because I know not just that God did it for my mom God did it for my dad God did it for somebody else but God did it for me God did it for me because he did it for me I know that he's able to do it for my children I know he's able to do it for the young people I know he's able to do it for the old people I know he's able to meet the needs so we have here tonight why because he's met my need and if he's met my need and if he's Lucifer naturally in my life that I know he can move in yours right and so the confidence that we have as Christians is built from the fact that we have met God and we followed the word and we've obeyed God and we can look back for the Harvard those years so we could say I was once like you but I met God when I met God I turned him in another direction and now I can look at my life and say with confidence God led me God was working in me and you can look back over those years you can say if you can follow the God that I followed you can receive the help that I received you can you can experience the miracles that I experienced are you with me now and again it won't happen the same way for everybody but still we all have to meet God we all have to follow his word and we will all be blessed by that now look Moses when he obeyed God what did he do he took his life and sons and he would set them upon a nasty return to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand brother matter said he a little bald-headed guy with a beard he said was going down to Egypt to take over put his wife and kids on the donkey and he was he was going down to Egypt and he said somebody harder and where are you going Moses I'm going out to Egypt to take over and it would seem like an insane thing to say but he had confidence why he even following God and he knew the same God that met him in a burning bush would also deliver the children of Israel so he had the confidence to obey God so we find that Paul did the same thing in Acts chapter 9 verse 17 will read the next few verses he said in Anna and I have swin his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even jesus said appeared unto thee in the way of Psych amos has sent me that down - received that side and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized when he had received meat he was strengthened and then was saw certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straightway notice the same guy that a few days before had been had been persecuting the church doing everything he could to stop it and he said in straightway he preached Christ in the synagogue's that he is the son of God you can imagine that first sermon those men would have known Paul he walks up there with his with his book and he opens up the scroll I said today we're gonna read from the Book of Isaiah and we're gonna prove that Jesus Christ is the Messiah you talk about the stir in the church there was enough there was a there was a depth roar that day because Paul was standing up against what do you know he'd always stood against it now he was standing for it well I met God and he obeyed God's Word he met God he followed the Word of God but it says but all that heard him were amazed sure they were and said it's not this he that destroyed them which called on this name of Jerusalem came hither for that intent then he might bring them bound unto the chief priests but Saul increased some more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ why he met God and he followed God but the batter mentions this about our confidence in the Word of God he says have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientist he's always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation and both of these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways in its destruction that's why he attacks him he hates to be exposed in those books he's exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about Satan here it's no part of me and I have no part in him he said the devil would like to prove that different but he can't so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word that's what Satan is working at constantly in your life to destroy your confidence in the work any way that he can do it he doesn't care you see I talk to you about how that is ministers in the gospel we have to use the right means to the gospel we don't use deceptive means to preach the gospel we don't use deceptive methods we're not going to call everybody in for a an Easter egg hunt dropped from a helicopter right we're not we're not going to start taking all the the lyrics out of our songs that relate to the blood of Christ and just start singing where everybody would be pleased with it we don't use deceptive methods we believe what we believe right and we preach what we believe but Satan does he loves deceptive methods he loves to try to prove that he's one with the word he loves to try to prove and destroy your confidence in the word he said but when the church disbelieved Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word the gates of Hell cannot prevail against her amen so brother man makes the same ISA don't put your confidence in a man he said when that man leaves the Word of God you leave the man he said you leave the man stay with God God is the word that's what the church is built on us to work you don't take my word over the Word of God shame on you if you take my word over the Word of God shame on us if we take a man's word even a prophets word over the Word of God about we take a prophet's word because it lines up with the word of God right he said don't put your confidence in a man he said when a man leaves sword of God you leave the man si you leave the man stay with God God is two word brother branham talked about this and in this confidence and we know that and when we have confidence with God it has to be caused by something there has to be something that brings that confidence and so it can't be we can't have confidence in a in a cold relationship does that make sense if you've never met God and if we could say it this way if you don't love God then you can't really have confidence in God and you can't really believe his word because you really don't love him and brother Branham uses the illustration of a married couple he said it just happened here in Louisville he said a woman has been a Christian for many years but her husband had she fell in love with this man he had been a Christian a couple of years he said so they got married and they loved and had coffee one another and they got married and the woman said to the man said hobby it must be hard on you you're just a young Christian you've had so much to go through with and what it was was he had a drinking problem before he become a Christian she said you've had so much to go through within these he and said I know you're bound to be tempted awfully hard and said I want you to know one thing now now if you happen to fall into temptation and has overcome don't stay away from home you come on back you come right here cuz I'm gonna be right here waiting for you and I'm gonna help you pray through again until you get victory I'm gonna stay with you because when I married you I married you because I loved you no matter what you are I still love you what an attitude to have in a marriage and I think we can extrapolate that even farther to a church that when it comes to these things I won't we can't condone what people do but we want them to come to church and this is where you get help we don't want you to stay out there come back if you mess up come to church if you do something you know is wrong come to the house of God we don't want you to stay that way but we want you to get help and we know you can get help here we believe we have confidence in what we're what we're teaching what we're believing we're not embarrassed the years ago someone don't come to the church and preach that we should not parent our children out of embarrassment it's always stuck with me because many times we do that you know you go to the store and your kids start acting up you get embarrassed and there's nothing to makes you more proud than going into a store and people compliment and how your kids behave right that had this actually happened to me today I was just shocked you know but you know when you go into a store and I guess they'd had some really bad kids in there that day but you know today but you know s you nothing nothing uplifts you more but sometimes you get embarrassed by but you know what they're just kids getting embarrassed doesn't help anybody right parent out of embarrassment then the kids just learned how to be good actors they don't learn how to be good they just learn how to act good and sometimes I think that's what we create in church is we create good actors people who know how to come to church and sit just right the way that message the people are supposed to sit you know and sit there and quietly before the service and raise their hand at all the right times and and and leave quietly at the end of the service we create good actors we don't want people to act good we want them to be good we want them to be saved all right so we can't run a church out of embarrassment well I that person that comes to me we'd be embarrassed by them coming to church no we want to be a hospital where the sick can come and get well we don't want them to stay sick we want him to get well how you gonna get well by the preaching of the word are you gonna get well about the whole of the spirit well you come under this atmosphere and I think of the little girl and excuse me for just preaching freely getting away from my notes tonight but it's like that little girl that was down down there in a foreign country and and her captain or her master was named in the Syrian she went down there and naman was was I was a leper and she said what God you were in my country she said because we have a prophet and we have a promise of healing amen and I think we can be the same way to night that we can actually speak to those that are on the outside and say I wish you into my church because we may be flawed but we have a healer we may be hurt sometimes but we have a savior we may have trouble sometimes but we know the master of the wind we know somebody who can take care of the problems of your life we know somebody if you're if you're strung out on drugs if you're strung out on alcohol if you find yourself with marriage six or seven times if you find yourself with all kinds of trouble come here that's just the kind Jesus went to and we believe Jesus is walking in flesh today if you happen to fall invitation or overcome don't stay away from home come here people are too embarrassed just forgive me for a moment people are too embarrassed to come to church because somebody did something wrong well just because you don't know what everybody else did doesn't mean we're not all sinners people do things that are wrong we serve a living God we serve a God of miracles we serve a God who can overcome in us well the random said a few days after this woman told her husband that he said he was he eating his lunch with the fellas down the boiler room he was telling them about it said no how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody loves you like that he said see there you are how could you trespass that confidence he said when we were sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud he said God come to us God taught you you never saw God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out he said that ought to create a perfect love look what she was look what you are not just a clinical thing where we sit here and divide all the all the words and everything just right but look what you were look what you were look what look what was camping in your life and look what's happening now look what's happening Christ is moving in your life today why what did that somebody that loves you he said can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in His Word if we could ever learn to love him right we would be sure that the word is true Peter says in 2nd Peter 1:16 he said we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made ownit you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory and this is that idea of the presence of God on the Mount of Transfiguration he says this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard the hard way I think that's a problem a lot of people in the message have today they never heard the voice from heaven Peter said we heard it so we've not followed cunningly devised fables if you haven't heard the voice from heaven if all you hear its the earthly voice mother Brown said that voice from heaven was predestination if you've only heard the voice from Earth then you can't be sure of what you're talking about but if you've ever heard the voice that came from another rail ever heard the voice from heaven Peter said we know what we're talking about we have confidence in the word because the voice we heard was from heaven the voice we heard was from heaven when we were with him on the holy mouth he said we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart so Peter is telling them that everybody thinks they know what prophecy means everybody has an interpretation everybody's got an idea and now Peter comes to him and he says but we know what it means because we lived it we know what it means because we heard the voice from heaven we know what it means because it's real in our lives it's not just a concept but it's a reality we have a more sure word of prophecy as a word do you do well that you take heed unto a light that shine it's in a dark place until the day dawn the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation but the Branham explains that this way God interprets this word by bringing it to pass you want to know if the message is true see if it works in your life I challenge you to give it a chance give it a chance to work in your life if all the message does produce misery to you then you haven't found what I found because the message didn't produce misery to me but the message produced a life of joy and peace and and a life that I know that even if I mess up like God hasn't thrown me away but he's right there for me hey man I know that I know that the no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation because I know he's become real in my life he said for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man so if the prophecy didn't come by the will of man the interpretation doesn't come by the will of man you don't just say it means something and it come to pass but it means it because it came to pass are you with me now it came to pass God did what he said he would do when God's Malachi 4 we could make that mean all kinds of things but we know it means what it means because God did it right and the other scripture is the same in 2nd Peter it's so 2nd Peter 1:21 he said the prophecy came not in old time to the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost 2nd Peter 3:16 he's speaking of Paul's epistles I love this 4 Peter saying I got what I believe not by a cunningly devised fables for I heard a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son it was my personal experience I believe in I'm willing to die for it because I was there I know he's risen from the dead I was there I saw the tomb Peter could say that but now he turns 4 and he says that he talks about our beloved brother Paul and he says it's also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest they wrestle with it as they do also the other scriptures to their own destruction what's saying that the words apostle wasn't just those who were there but Paul never met Christ in the flesh but he met him in the pillar of fire all right and so he also wrote the scripture and he said they wrestle with those scriptures that Paul wrote just like they do the other scriptures the Old Testament unto their own destruction 2nd Timothy 3:16 all scripture now this is Paul speaking all Scripture is given by inspiration that word its expression is god-breathed God breathed of God it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so what can I pin my soul on all of it and I have to be able to have any confidence in it at all if I can't put my soul on every word of it I haven't I can't have no confidence in it because of God that can't keep the Scriptures whole how's it going to keep my life oh god that could give the scripture my inspiration could also keep it are you with me now but even having it just in this form would never help me but the same God that gave up my inspiration I've got to receive it by inspiration the same God has got to come and live in my life and begin to show me and reveal to me his word but all Scripture is given by inspiration or exploration of God it's God breathed so we can have confidence in it what else can we have confidence in we can have confidence in ourselves and that seems like it makes you pause doesn't it it made me pause because if you've been around me very long you know that I that's if I struggle with something that's not necessarily been overconfident it's been under confident and and there's pros and cons to both sides if under confident is a word I'm questioning myself about that I questioned myself a lot and that you find two types of people basically those who question themselves all the time and those that don't question themselves and it'd be nice if you'd be somewhere in the middle but it takes all of us to balance those things out but we do have to have confidence in ourselves when it comes to the fact that we're children of God we've got to have confidence in that we've got to know that just like we know you're Joey you know you're Joey wait maybe you may have been putting on to me but you know you could you could pass yourself off as someone else for a while you can steal somebody's identity but you know right and you've got to have confidence in yourself knowing you're a child of God you might come to church assimilate with believers act like all the believers do but you've got to have something I've got to have something that we know I know I'm a child of God hey man so when Paul speaks to people and he speaks to them about what God is doing in their lives he's fixed him like this he said being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ so if I can see a beginning if I can see that you met God I can see your life Kurt to change I know God will continue to perform it you may have ups and downs you may have times when you're less spiritual than at other times you may have times we disagree you may have piles when you go back and forth the maybe you don't feel like coming to church and all kinds of different things but I'm confident of this that he which began a good work will finish it hey Ben the God who met me hey man the God who gives me the word I can have confidence in it's the same God it will perform his word in me so then what do I have to worry about it's not up to me ultimately though I work and though I I struggle to do his will but it's not up to me ultimately it's up to him so he says I'm confident of this and then second Corinthians 7:16 he said I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things now Paul was basing that on something because he had been told they were pinioned right and so they saw that they had repented and so he said I have confidence in you in all things I think we have ought to have more confidence than those we go to church with Paul says I have confidence in you through the Lord in Galatians 5:10 that you'll be none otherwise minded he speaks very positively to them after speaking very negatively to them and to calling them basically fools for having gone back into Judaism but he said I have confidence in you hey man I like what Paul says if any man draw back my social have no pleasure in him he said but we are not of those that draw back a man and and he just says that confidently and he says that and so everyone that hears him is that way he said we were we are not of them that draw back but we heard them to believe hey man we should have that kind of confidence in ourselves and in those were we got-we fellowship with I have confidence in you through the Lord that you'll be none otherwise minded but he the trouble with you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be 1st John 3:21 let's look at this because this is part of it we're gonna have confidence with God and I'm you know we're gonna get out of here pretty quick tonight so you just hang with me if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God now he doesn't say if our heart condemn it's not we're saved because if we were only saved when our heart didn't condemn us we'd have a problem we'd have to get resaved a lot right and so he says if if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart God knows everything God knows the truth about it but now he says if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God so what it does is if we're living in a way we know isn't right according to the word it's hard to have confidence you realize Church that what we need is not just more emotional more music or more people I hope you're with me tonight well what we need if I could just put all of us in the same bucket and I know that's not necessarily true but kind of put us all together well what do we need we need to have people who have confidence in God and confidence in their own lives but you see people constantly defeated constantly getting resaved at every meeting and you wonder why do people have to go through that why do they never have enough confidence it's hard to find people even with enough confidence in their walk to pray in church or to or to talk to God or or to do the things that they need to do or to lay hands on someone else that's sick they said they'd say well I wish the pastor was here and I would be able to do that I wish someone else was here no you know you can lay hands on the sick you can reach out and you could be a prayer warrior but we go day after day after day without praying believe me I've been there and you go to work in his heart and so you you learn to get up in the morning and drink your coffee and go to work and you begin to forget about the things of God you begin to let it go and let it slide and after a while you look back at your own life and just have no confidence at all so when you go to church you're beat downing you you're worried and and you come to church and say well I hope the preacher don't preach at me today I hope you don't mention that because I know it's not right well I live like that it's the grace of God that were saved anyway if we're gonna make it it's gonna be by the grace of God but if there's something in your life that you know is wrong quit doing it or start doing it maybe something you should be doing and most of the time almost a hundred percent of the time we know what those things are you don't have to have me come to the house of God every Wednesday night and sit here run down a list of all the things you do that are wrong or all the things you should do that are right but we know there's something within us that and Paul puts it this way said you have no need a man to teach you because you have the Holy Spirit there's things that you know you know what you should be doing you know when you should be praying you know when you should be rejoicing you know when you should be getting into the service you know when those I don't have to beat you over the head about that but if our heart condemn us man we have no confidence toward God and so we come sheepishly to the throne but Paul said let's come boldly to the throne of grace let's believe that God's gonna do what we ask him to do let's come to church with confidence that we're gonna we're gonna be the house of God and if it's just me that's there I'm gonna worship God if it's only me I'm still gonna give God the glory that he deserves if I'm the only one left if I preach until there's nobody left here and I'm the only one left here I want to be one standing and say Lord you still deserve a preacher the lists for you you still deserve somebody to lift their hands in praise if our heart condemn us not we have confidence toward God say well my heart condemns me I don't want to know what to do about it make it right how long does that take it takes that long that's that's all there is to it but it's hard for us to believe that because we keep thinking well I'll make that mistake again make it right make it right and when we surrender to God we don't just surrender to God but we say God I know I can't surrender like a lot to help me to surrender in a way that would be pleasing to you and whatsoever we ask you have things that you need I know that I did whatsoever we ask well I've been asking a lot lately but he said whatever we ask hey Ben whatever we ask whatever we ask we receive of him are you with me tonight whatever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight listen to me it's a miracle that we're here tonight it's a miracle the house of God it's a miracle you can I can take you back through my life and walk you through and say it's a miracle that I'm standing here preaching but for you today it's a miracle that you're sitting in the pew listening in on a Wednesday night it's a miracle in this day and age with all this went on that you're sitting here today this church is still operating like God wants it to today it's a miracle that it's happening and if he's done this we believe whatever we ask we receive of him hallelujah because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and he goes on to say this is his commandment that we love one another we love him amen brother madam and watch this this quote but there's one quote but I've broken it up into three or four slides watch this before we close but the Branham says now Hebrews the first chapter said God in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets but in this last day by his son Christ Jesus for the RAM said see it's the Holy Spirit taking over possession taking possession of the church to operate Christ in the church then you become as he was he became as you was so you could become as he was he become you that you might become him he said that it's above understanding I hope you with me I hope you get it because you can't understand that how could God come down and live through me because I make so many mistakes but look he becoming she was so you can become as he was he become you that you might become him that it's above understanding there's no way to explain it and don't try it just accept it he spoke it and that settles it just say it's right believe it there's some people who can just ruin any gift you give them because they always got no words from and how much it cost and and and all the parameters of it everything about it no just take it just take it I want you to have it you don't have to ask me how I got it if I could afford it or anything else just take it don't you see God doing that same thing to us just take it accept it don't know try to figure it out accept it he said he spoke it that settles it just say it's right believe it no brother and says as a young Christian I've always made this statement I was glad God got ahold of me before the church did hard telling what I had a been but I was faithful of the leadership and the direct contact but then we don't understand why we come up sometimes the way we do and have to go through things but if so we could get in direct contact with God he said it was the direct contact I was thankful for the leadership and the direct contact with the Holy Spirit impressed my life with before I ever surrendered it he said France a little lad I knew there was something he had talked and I talked to him he talked back to me and I began to notice that the thing said he told me us a little lad they begin to happening just exactly the way he said they do so I knew it had to be true so watch this God begins to move in a Prophet's life and he cost him when he's young as he's young to begin to grow up and come up in a different way he wasn't raised in a church home he wasn't raised like everybody else was but he'd come up in a special way and God got to him before the church did and God began to speak to him and as he spoke he saw it come to pass and when he did he knew it must be true what's he doing he's building confidence in him oh my you see because we're not just looking at Moses or in Abraham were at Paul who met God who followed God's Word who kept God's Word or who had confidence in who they were but we're looking at a prophet of God in our generation that meant God and it gives me confidence because I know it's not just a story from another time but it's something that happened when they had vehicles when they weenie had to put gas in his car like I do are you with me but now I think we can even open update it even further than that or we can say god I know it not only happened with him yes that gives me confidence that you're alive in this hour but it also gives me confidence to know that there's people who use the internet who still have the God working in their life are you with me now we believe we're at work we're the body of Christ then there's people who use the Internet people who use cell phones people who drive cars that almost drives themselves and for God can do that for them he can do it for me now brother Brent says I'm an old man now and I have never won time and can call the world to a standstill you talk about confidence and ask them put your finger on one thing that he ever told me in thus saith the Lord in the name of the Lord but what was absolutely the truth in fact it come to pass out of the thousands times thousands of things one thing what am I saying that for he said see I put us all this volcanic dust he said but it's the promise of God's Word therefore I cannot have confidence in myself wait a minute brother Ben I thought she said to have confidence on ourselves as children of God he said I cannot have confidence in myself you cannot have confidence in yourself but together we can have confidence in what has taken over ourselves better hallelujah we can have confidence in what has taken over ourselves we've been bought out there's a new administration there's new management you've been to a restaurant that was all beaten up and and broken now and everything didn't work and there Roach's going all over the place and maybe he said I'll never go back and you see a sign up says new management you sit then think well maybe I will go back why because if the management is different maybe they fix the broken places in the tables maybe they put in new floors maybe they hung better lights maybe they brought in some spray and sprayed the roaches so new management means something and you can say that about your life there's new management we don't have confidence in in ourselves - as far as the flesh we have confidence in what has taken over ourselves the Holy Spirit is taking us over he said we must have confidence in that and as we place our confidence in that then the results comes aren't you glad you could have confidence in something that has results god bless you musicians if you had come let's stand together bow our heads let's talk to the Lord for a moment maybe we could play that he became me that I might become him by grace you believe that you're becoming him by grace amen amen I I can't think of a greater thing than for him to take over my life I can't think of a greater thing for him you know I appreciate these brothers I've been having Talent take over theater service cuz I don't how much voice lived to be able to sing it I'm so grateful when someone with a voice comes and takes over but you know God wants to do that in your life somebody with a voice somebody with a with them with the ability to live it he wants to come in he wants to take over won't you let him today he said but another man I'll let him do that a long time ago would you just allow that influence of that word to be increased in your life if you don't have confidence in the word go and meet God made him hate him for real and then begin to obey his word he said well I had a sensation I felt something but but meet him and then begin to follow the word and as you begin to follow the word you'll see God moves in your life I promise you there's not many things I could promise you in this life but I'll promise you that if you meet God God will keep his word in your life he said for the better how do you know that because I know he's done it for me and he's done it for me and I should have left Church and every reason to quit the message and every reason not to be here today but I'm standing here as a testimony to what God can do when he takes over a life and you're here today because God takes over your life would you just let him do that tonight worship Him together let's pray Heavenly Father or Jesus as we come to worship father I pray that you just move in our lives or Jesus I pray you would take over every area or it if there's some some door that we haven't opened to you god I pray that we would open it tonight Lord unless you just flow through us Oh God we see such a need in our our such a need Lord for people who have confidence in you nor do you look like Abraham and it doesn't matter what happens doesn't matter whether the world goes crazy and has but hard they believe if everybody else is laughing at them they just keep building on the boat they just keep working they just keep knew and they just keep believing somebody gets sick somebody gets hurt somebody somebody leaves mess if somebody doesn't do right they just keep believing because there's something in all this build the confidence not just because God did it for Abraham or God did it for Moses God did it for Paul God did it for brother branham but because God did it for them I pray you would grant it Lord may there be a personal meeting time with God and every one of our lives cause there's things that we we've done are doing or don't do that we should be doing or shouldn't do pray you'd help help us to clear those out of our lives today just walk with you just in the simplicity of the work let you move in our lives granite father's we worship you just for a moment I pray that your spirit would be with us be brave Jesus his love could take singing now's Metallica [Music] she slipped our head and see it too [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] let's just lift our hands and legged the seat [Music] be thankful for what he's done in your life amen he became us so we might become him he took our righteousness which was his filthy rags and then he gave us his righteousness a man I mean we're not righteous in ourselves but because of him we become we took on the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen amen let's just sing that song as the spirit of Lourdes here let's just sing in the presence of Jehovah the semen [Music] nice to me this process [Music] to feel the presence [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see maybe you believe that [Music] and I see [Music] I worship you [Music] it's not like you [Music] [Music]
