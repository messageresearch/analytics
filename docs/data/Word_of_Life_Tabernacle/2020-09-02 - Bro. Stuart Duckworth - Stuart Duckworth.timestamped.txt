[26:09] uh idea

[26:15] idea but it's a reality because we've
[26:17] experienced that so we're thankful for
[26:19] that uh before brother stewart comes um
[26:23] we're going to have two services this
[26:24] weekend and because brother darrell ward
[26:26] is going to be through
[26:28] and so we'll have services at ten
[26:29] o'clock and three o'clock
[26:31] on sunday
[26:33] uh my family and i'll be eating at the
[26:34] fellowship hall and we're not gonna have
[26:36] a church dinner but you're welcome to
[26:37] join us there and bring your food or
[26:39] whatever if you want to do that it'll be
[26:41] open
[26:42] during the day we'll probably feed
[26:44] brother daryl over there
[26:46] but but he'll be with us those two
[26:48] services the lord willing and we've
[26:50] learned to say that through all of this
[26:51] but
[26:53] but we'll have the services regardless
[26:55] and but he's coming through the area and
[26:57] he told me he'd be through in september
[26:59] this is the very first weekend in
[27:01] september so he's keeping his word but
[27:04] didn't give us a lot of notice but we're
[27:06] thankful that god could bring him by our
[27:08] way and and we were expecting great
[27:09] things this weekend
[27:11] uh there's a lot of positive things
[27:13] happening some things i want to tell you
[27:14] about sunday morning and just that
[27:17] really blessed us and as a church and
[27:19] and we need to focus on those things and
[27:21] remember that god is still in control
[27:24] uh he may be stormy and windy and rainy
[27:26] but he's still in control he's the same
[27:28] yesterday today and forever and so we're
[27:32] so grateful for what god has done for us
[27:34] as a church and brother stewart
[27:35] duckworth have asked him to speak for us
[27:37] tonight of course it raining but the
[27:39] steward probably preaches when it rains
[27:40] more than any other preacher
[27:42] but he's off work because of the rain
[27:44] and so we're grateful to have him
[27:46] with us and uh and speaking for us

[33:38] 11
[33:40] 1 through 5.
[33:42] just want to speak on reserve by
[33:45] election kind of a thought that i'd had
[33:47] before
[33:48] and kind of just kind of revisiting that
[33:50] and you know you preach that one church
[33:52] and you're bound to hear y'all are bound
[33:55] to hear the same thing again eventually
[33:57] you know and or just
[34:00] some of those thoughts and just kind of
[34:02] going over some of those things today
[34:04] just trying to find the mind of the lord
[34:05] and these things
[34:07] stuck out to us
[34:10] we certainly love the lord tonight
[34:12] amen romans 11 verse 1
[34:16] i say then hath god cast away his people
[34:19] god forbid
[34:20] for i also am an israelite of the seed
[34:23] of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
[34:26] god hath not cast away his people which
[34:29] he foreknew
[34:30] what ye not what the scripture saith of
[34:33] elias how he maketh intercession to god
[34:36] against israel saying
[34:38] lord they have killed thy prophets and
[34:40] dig down thine altars and i
[34:42] am left alone and they seek my life
[34:45] but what saith the answer of god unto
[34:48] him
[34:49] i have reserved to myself as seven
[34:51] thousand men who have not bowed to the
[34:54] to the
[34:55] bowed the knee to the image of baal
[34:58] and even so
[35:00] then at this present time also there is
[35:02] a remnant according to the election of
[35:05] grace
[35:06] amen this may the lord bless his word
[35:08] you can be seated
[35:10] tonight
[35:15] it just seems it's not brother ben's
[35:17] fault it just seems
[35:19] that
[35:20] work and
[35:21] the things of life it just seems that
[35:24] it's been a while since i preached and
[35:26] like i said that's not brother ben's
[35:27] fault he's been trying to get me
[35:29] get me here for a while and just
[35:31] thankful for a little time off and
[35:33] and to where we can come and administer
[35:36] tonight
[35:37] we certainly appreciate the lord for
[35:39] that
[35:40] we just want to look at a few things
[35:42] here
[35:43] that
[35:45] god is reserved to himself a people
[35:47] amen and it's by by his election and by
[35:50] his grace that he has done this
[35:53] and i like that in verse 2 that you know
[35:56] paul said here is god hath not cast away
[35:59] his people which he for knew amen i like
[36:02] that i like that
[36:04] amen
[36:06] and we know that according to election
[36:09] that that paul here is dealing with with
[36:12] israel but brother brown said it also
[36:14] perfectly types the church the gentile
[36:17] church
[36:18] but we know that according to election a
[36:20] hundred and forty four thousand will
[36:23] come forth and be sealed
[36:24] out of israel during the tribulation
[36:27] amen but but us were sealed this side of
[36:31] the tribulation
[36:32] amen by here we can see that it types
[36:34] israel and we can see that here this
[36:37] election and and how god has reserved
[36:39] his elected people it also tops the
[36:41] gentile church brother and said it tops
[36:44] the church
[36:45] perfectly the elected believers
[36:48] we understand that that god can't reveal
[36:52] himself to israel until the gentile
[36:54] bride is gone we understand these things
[36:58] he said in the feast of the trumpets and
[36:59] said all that it's waiting on is you and
[37:02] i it's the gentile church to get out of
[37:05] the way to where god can reveal himself
[37:07] to israel to the 144 thousand and then
[37:10] he's waiting on you and i
[37:12] waiting on that last one to be called
[37:15] and come to maturity
[37:17] amen
[37:19] but just that thought that would god
[37:21] cast away the people which he for knew
[37:23] asking that question amen we know that
[37:26] the bible says that he could never
[37:28] forget us
[37:29] that a mother could forget our suckling
[37:32] child but that that he can't forget you
[37:34] and i
[37:35] that our names are engraved in the very
[37:37] palms of his hand and i ask you that
[37:40] question tonight would god cast away the
[37:42] people which he for knew there's no way
[37:45] that he could amen because our names are
[37:48] engraved in the palms of his hands amen
[37:52] i don't want to try to try to keep my
[37:54] voice as much as i can
[37:56] as my voice goes it just kind of gets
[37:58] harder to preach and i'm going to try to
[38:01] try to preach in such a way where i can
[38:03] where i can keep my voice a little
[38:04] better
[38:06] but no matter how lost
[38:08] we were
[38:10] no matter how lost you and i were
[38:12] redemption made a way for us
[38:14] and man god is not going to lose those
[38:17] which he foreknew but he's got a purpose
[38:20] amen amen we've been elected by his
[38:23] grace and he can't lose a woman
[38:26] and then he calls us by his grace to an
[38:29] unconditional covenant amen and a
[38:32] covenant where he swears by himself
[38:36] and then he swears by himself that he'll
[38:38] perform that which he has said
[38:41] amen and brother branham said that he
[38:42] swore by the death of jesus christ
[38:46] and then he sent back the holy ghost
[38:49] for a confirmation of the covenant
[38:53] the covenant amen that god would have
[38:55] between you and i that he would bring us
[38:57] to the place of what he's called us to
[38:59] be
[39:00] amen amen that it's a finished work
[39:04] amen that death amen on calvary amen
[39:07] he's sworn by the death of jesus christ
[39:10] and that death is a finished work amen
[39:12] that's a complete work that he's done
[39:14] you and you and i
[39:17] amen he's the author and the finisher of
[39:20] our faith
[39:21] amen aren't you thankful aren't you
[39:23] thankful tonight for redemption aren't
[39:25] you thankful that no matter how lost you
[39:27] and i were they their redemption made a
[39:29] way amen that he wasn't going to lose a
[39:32] woman amen that he came and he he seeked
[39:34] amen those that were lost
[39:37] he sought you and i out
[39:40] amen aren't you thankful tonight for
[39:41] redemption thankful amen for the blood
[39:44] tonight amen thankful for the power
[39:46] that's in the blood amen amen thankful
[39:48] for the baptism thankful for the seal of
[39:51] the holy ghost amen amen
[39:55] amen to see god's claim
[39:57] upon your life
[39:59] amen to see that god's made a claim upon
[40:01] your life that he's elected you that
[40:03] he's called you amen by his grace amen
[40:06] and to see that to see that effect upon
[40:09] your life to see his grace working in
[40:11] your life
[40:12] ought to make you full of joy tonight i
[40:15] want to make you full of joy unspeakable
[40:17] and full of glory
[40:20] amen
[40:22] but elijah
[40:24] elijah got into the condition and the
[40:26] mindset that he was the only one that
[40:29] hadn't failed
[40:31] but god had to remind him
[40:34] and he had that mentality that he was
[40:36] the only one and sometimes we gonna get
[40:39] under that same mentality that we think
[40:41] we're the only one
[40:43] amen that we're the only one where we're
[40:45] at but god's got a church reserved amen
[40:48] god's got a bride reserved and man god's
[40:50] got sons and daughters amen and men that
[40:53] are walking in this truth that are
[40:55] walking in their slide amen
[40:59] amen it's not just
[41:01] my for no more it's not just this church
[41:04] but god's got a people amen in every
[41:07] nation tongue and tribe amen throughout
[41:10] the whole world amen it's got to be that
[41:12] way man it's got to come that way
[41:14] there's got to be a people amen give
[41:16] witness amen in every language and every
[41:19] place in every corner of the earth
[41:23] amen
[41:26] amen he was hated
[41:28] he was hated elijah was hated for
[41:31] preaching the truth
[41:32] amen for standing up against that
[41:34] painted up jezebel
[41:37] amen in her false worship of baal
[41:40] amen and preaching against her lukewarm
[41:43] husband ahab
[41:46] amen they haven't tied himself up with
[41:48] these unbelievers
[41:50] and man he knew what was right
[41:52] he he knew what was right he had heard
[41:54] what was right and man he had seen god
[41:57] remember he got mixed up he got mixed up
[41:59] with jezebel and it caused him to be in
[42:01] a lukewarm condition
[42:06] but we know elijah wasn't afraid of a
[42:08] showdown
[42:10] he wasn't afraid amen amen the god of
[42:13] elijah was with him amen god had been
[42:16] with elijah he was not afraid of a
[42:19] showdown to see who the true and living
[42:21] god was
[42:22] amen the god
[42:24] the god that answered by fire was with
[42:26] his prophet
[42:28] do you believe that
[42:29] amen he he was called
[42:31] he was elected amen he was called amen
[42:34] to bring a restoration
[42:36] in the midst of the unbelief
[42:38] in the midst of that lukewarm
[42:40] lukewarmness and the false worship it
[42:43] meant god had called the prophet god had
[42:45] called a prophet to restore israel back
[42:48] to the true worship of the true and
[42:50] living god amen he wasn't afraid of a
[42:52] showdown and then he wasn't afraid of
[42:54] the 400 prophets amen he knew who god
[42:57] was he knew what god had called him to
[42:59] do and then he knew the anointing that
[43:01] he was under i mean he wasn't afraid
[43:05] amen and he stood there under that
[43:07] showdown and the god amen and the god
[43:09] that answered by fire came down upon the
[43:11] scene
[43:13] but at the one one thread of a woman
[43:16] he fled
[43:17] for his life is that right
[43:22] but brother branham said here he said
[43:24] speaking of elijah he said he came on
[43:26] the scene with the word of the lord he
[43:28] sent his message that he preached and he
[43:30] condemned everything there was called
[43:33] sin
[43:34] he didn't leave anything unturned
[43:36] amen elijah the prophet that mighty
[43:38] prophet condemned everything of that age
[43:41] amen and there was a there was a prophet
[43:43] in this day
[43:45] there was a prophet in this state that
[43:47] was anointed with that same spirit of

[44:05] that sin amen not afraid amen to take a
[44:08] stand amen to take a stand against the
[44:10] denominations on those things amen and
[44:13] then to show us amen that those things
[44:15] were wrong and to point us to christ
[44:19] amen to point us to christ the anointed
[44:21] word of the day

[44:29] messenger amen that's what i want to be
[44:32] identified in this last age amen and
[44:34] friends it's got to be more than just
[44:36] talking about the message amen but we've
[44:38] got to get into it and man it's more
[44:40] than just talking about it it's more
[44:42] than just having the tapes in the books
[44:43] amen it's more than just coming to
[44:45] church but we've got to get into it and
[44:47] then you've got to find your place in
[44:49] your position and stay there amen take
[44:51] your stand amen be unmovable amen be
[44:55] steadfast amen be unwavering

[45:18] amen be be steadfast be unwavering with
[45:21] what you believe amen
[45:24] and brother branham said here and souls
[45:25] that are in prison now
[45:28] and one time he thought speaking of
[45:30] elijah that he stood alone he said no
[45:32] i've got seven thousand yet that's right
[45:34] with you it says see that's that elected
[45:36] group there is always that group
[45:40] i said don't fear elijah i know that you
[45:41] think you run out because the
[45:43] denominations run up there on run you up
[45:45] there on top of the hill but said i've
[45:47] got seven thousand that believes the
[45:48] same thing that you're preaching

[46:00] right with you they believe what you're
[46:02] preaching they stand for what you're
[46:04] preaching amen amen they're not going to
[46:06] accept nothing else and i've reserved
[46:09] that group
[46:10] are you part of that group tonight
[46:13] y'all can preach with me
[46:15] amen
[46:17] speaking of election brother branham
[46:18] says i would be a discouraged man this
[46:20] morning if i didn't believe in the
[46:22] election and calling of god
[46:24] if i thought that this world was left to
[46:26] the outcome of it by the power of man
[46:29] and by the wisdom of man and by the big
[46:30] fours and the um and who never even
[46:33] mentioned god's name i'd be a
[46:34] discouraged person but i'm not looking
[46:37] for that outcome
[46:38] i look down on the page of this old book
[46:40] here where god wrote it out and
[46:42] everything will come out just exactly
[46:44] the way he said it and that's all so the
[46:47] only thing for me to do is not line up
[46:49] with them but line up with calvary line
[46:52] up with god line up with his word stay
[46:54] in the word no matter how much it looks
[46:56] like it's going to be that way it's
[46:58] going to be the god the way god intends
[47:00] it to be
[47:02] it can't be nothing else
[47:04] i love that it's going to be the way god
[47:06] intends it to be
[47:08] for him being infinite know the end from
[47:10] the beginning and he makes everything
[47:12] come to his praises that's right
[47:15] and he goes on all things have to work
[47:17] together everything will shape right up
[47:19] to its place my that wouldn't make the
[47:22] the cur make courage in a christian
[47:24] nothing can go wrong after all it's not
[47:26] our battle it's his it's not our wisdom
[47:29] it's his the only one thing we have to
[47:31] do is put our faith and trust there
[47:35] and sit still and see the glory of god
[47:37] see how it moves around to its place
[47:40] every wheel moving it may be scattered
[47:42] from side to side but it'll move right
[47:44] into its place
[47:46] when god speaks the word
[47:48] take courage tonight
[47:50] take courage christian
[47:52] take courage this evening in the
[47:54] election and calling of god upon your
[47:56] life

[47:59] amen and the holy ghost is here it meant
[48:01] keeping his bride
[48:03] amen preserving her till his coming
[48:07] when we look at the condition of the age
[48:10] amen we see the condition around us we
[48:12] see the violence that fills the earth
[48:16] amen the evil in the darkness
[48:18] that is so prevalent
[48:20] and you wonder how much worse it can get
[48:23] to think that my children are going to
[48:24] have to grow up
[48:26] we've said these things before in a
[48:28] society where it's perfectly acceptable
[48:31] to smoke
[48:32] marijuana amen
[48:35] amen were they they lessened the penalty
[48:37] more and more on homosexuals
[48:40] amen were where that which was wrong has
[48:43] now become right and that which is right
[48:46] has now become wrong that's the age that
[48:49] we live in it's become so prevalent
[48:51] in the condition and the darkness amen
[48:54] but the bible says in the evening time
[48:56] there shall be light and when there's
[48:58] going to be a people amen that will take
[49:00] that word the lot that has came in this
[49:02] age amen and they'll let their light so
[49:04] shine eminent light shines the best it
[49:08] shines the brightest in the times of
[49:10] darkness
[49:10] [Music]
[49:12] that's the age that we live in that's
[49:13] what we've came to
[49:15] that's where we're at
[49:17] amen
[49:18] amen it'll get worse and worse
[49:21] you think it can't get any worse but
[49:23] it'll continue to get worse and worse
[49:25] until we leave
[49:27] amen but no matter how dark it gets say
[49:29] man there's a remember there's a man
[49:31] amen there's a man that in the times of
[49:33] darkness there's a man that can turn on
[49:35] the light and then brother brown said
[49:37] he'll rapture the church just as he said
[49:39] he would and then he'll turn that light
[49:41] switch on
[49:44] all we've got to do is stay in line
[49:47] amen stay in step with the word
[49:49] amen keep your eyes on christ amen let
[49:52] the world make all the noise they want
[49:54] to amen we're going to march to the beat
[49:57] of the word amen we're going to stay in
[49:59] line with the word amen we may get out
[50:02] of step every now and then amen but the
[50:04] word will come forth amen and we'll line
[50:06] ourselves back up with that beat
[50:10] amen you're going to get out of sip
[50:11] every now and then

[51:19] for our good
[51:20] is that right

[51:25] going to be the way god intends it to be

[51:48] to his perfect will he'll make the
[51:50] permissive will of god work out to the
[51:53] perfect will of god and that's where
[51:54] we've got to trust we've got to have
[51:57] faith i mean we've got to have
[51:58] confidence in the wisdom of god amen
[52:01] that me as a man i can make a wrong
[52:03] decision but god will make it work out
[52:05] for my good and what the enemy intended
[52:07] evil for me god will actually turn out
[52:10] to be my good
[52:12] that's the faith and the trust that
[52:13] we've got to have
[52:15] in god
[52:17] because he'll make everything come to
[52:19] his praise
[52:21] it's going to bring him glory no matter
[52:23] what he's going to make it work out just
[52:25] like he intended it to be

[52:30] amen amen and when his voice speaks in
[52:33] your life
[52:34] amen when when the one that is over came
[52:37] amen when his voice speaks in your life
[52:40] amen when he speaks the winds obey the
[52:43] storms of life obey amen it's not you
[52:46] speaking but it's him speaking through
[52:48] you
[52:49] it's got to be more than just yourself
[52:51] but it's got to be him in you it's got
[52:53] to be something greater than yourself
[52:55] speaking through you amen and when he
[52:57] speaks the storms of life have to obey
[53:00] even the storms amen that would cause
[53:02] you destruction they have to obey
[53:05] amen the troubling winds around us amen
[53:07] amen we we don't let it sway us no more
[53:10] and then because we know the master of
[53:12] the wind is present we know that he's
[53:15] here to calm the storm amen we know that
[53:17] the one that can calm the trouble storm
[53:20] is in us
[53:23] amen we've anchored in him who's in
[53:25] control of it all
[53:29] you love the lord tonight
[53:32] amen he's in control tonight
[53:35] there we place our faith in our trust
[53:37] amen and his divine wisdom
[53:40] amen because god knows best
[53:42] papa knows best
[53:44] is that right
[53:45] we're his sons and daughters and he's
[53:47] our father

[53:50] life
[53:51] amen if we'll come amen under his
[53:53] leading he'll move everything right into
[53:55] its place
[53:56] exactly how it needs to be
[53:58] he'll work it out for our good do you
[54:01] believe that
[54:03] amen
[54:04] god will work it out
[54:07] but the thought that god has reserved
[54:09] himself a people to the word
[54:12] and in the revelation of jesus christ
[54:15] brother branham says to see the
[54:16] beginning of the church age and to see
[54:18] how the apostles
[54:19] the doctrines and things that they
[54:21] taught
[54:22] and the principles of the bible and then
[54:23] to
[54:25] see that church
[54:26] about the second round of apostles how
[54:28] it began to fade away
[54:30] the real true teaching
[54:31] the third round getting way away
[54:34] and by the fourth round it had faded
[54:35] away out into a lukewarm the church
[54:38] brought forth a lukewarm church
[54:41] he said and then a real spirit-filled
[54:43] church he said which i say this with
[54:45] godly respect to every man's religion
[54:47] from the beginning till this time the
[54:49] real true church has been a pentecostal
[54:51] church
[54:52] amen he said it's true god has reserved
[54:55] this church
[54:57] amen god has reserved himself not a
[54:59] lukewarm church amen but a pentecostal
[55:02] church amen our church that is founded
[55:05] amen upon the doctrine of the apostles
[55:07] and prophets and been founded upon the
[55:10] teachings of our lord jesus and been
[55:12] founded upon amen the the revelation of
[55:15] jesus christ and the power of jesus
[55:17] christ and the power in that name
[55:22] and that word reserve means kept
[55:24] specially
[55:25] i like this kept especially for a
[55:27] particular purpose or a person
[55:30] i mean god has reserved this church
[55:33] god has reserved a church to himself
[55:35] amen whether it be here or somewhere
[55:38] else god has reserved a people to
[55:40] himself amen and you can choose to not
[55:42] whether you partake amen and be a part
[55:45] of that church or not and then you can
[55:47] choose tonight whether you're going to
[55:49] go a man astray or you're going to stick
[55:51] it out if you're going to stick it out
[55:53] and then line yourself up with the word
[55:58] amen but he's kept it reserved for a
[56:00] particular purpose or a person god has
[56:03] reserved this this church to himself
[56:06] amen for his purpose amen for his divine
[56:08] plan god has reserved this church to
[56:10] himself

[56:36] know who they are and when they got
[56:38] enough unction of the holy ghost when
[56:40] they got enough power in their lives to
[56:42] make that word live
[56:45] and then god's reserved a church to
[56:47] himself and man to preach in the name of
[56:49] jesus christ
[56:51] amen that baptized in the name of jesus
[56:53] christ and then he's got a ministry a
[56:55] man that preaches a total deliverance
[56:58] amen to where we don't have to go
[56:59] service to service year after year bound
[57:02] by the same old things amen amen but

[57:09] set the captive free amen that will
[57:10] bring our young people amen to a
[57:12] deliverance to where they don't have to
[57:14] go wandering and searching amen but the
[57:16] power of god is in this church and in
[57:18] this church that god has reserved to

[57:29] sickness amen there's power in this
[57:31] church

[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] the book of jude
[1:01:59] ain't but one chapter in the book of
[1:02:00] jude
[1:02:02] jude the first verse
[1:02:05] jude the servant of jesus christ
[1:02:07] and brother of james to them that are
[1:02:09] sanctified by god the father and
[1:02:11] preserved in jesus christ and called
[1:02:14] mercy unto you in peace and love be
[1:02:16] multiplied
[1:02:18] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[1:02:20] write unto you the common salvation it
[1:02:22] was needful for me to write unto you and
[1:02:24] exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:02:26] contend for the faith that was once
[1:02:28] delivered to the saints
[1:02:30] and we know that they begin to get away
[1:02:34] from the true word
[1:02:35] amen to what what they had been founded
[1:02:37] upon as the years went on they began to
[1:02:39] get away amen and i wonder if if some of
[1:02:42] us
[1:02:43] around the message haven't begun to get
[1:02:45] away with what what brother brown said
[1:02:47] amen to what he tried to bring us back
[1:02:49] to
[1:02:50] i wonder some haven't got away from that
[1:02:53] amen but if we've got away from it we've
[1:02:55] got to come back and line up with it
[1:02:57] amen if we've got out of step we've got
[1:02:59] to come back to that we've got to line
[1:03:01] ourselves up with the word amen we can't
[1:03:03] we can't bend amen the word to match our
[1:03:06] lives i've seen this on facebook well
[1:03:08] we've got to bend our lives to match the
[1:03:10] word
[1:03:11] is that right
[1:03:14] amen but he said to earnestly contend
[1:03:16] for the faith
[1:03:18] and brother branham said here
[1:03:20] he said now
[1:03:21] he also promised there would be
[1:03:22] restoring of the faith
[1:03:24] we read over in jude that earnestly
[1:03:26] contend for the faith that was once
[1:03:28] delivered to the saints
[1:03:30] now we're promised in malachi 4 by the
[1:03:32] same system he always did
[1:03:34] that would be restored back to the
[1:03:36] original faith oh my back to the
[1:03:38] original seed back to the seed like
[1:03:40] begin on the day of pentecost back to
[1:03:42] the same doctrine word by word power by
[1:03:45] power
[1:03:46] spirit by the same thing just exactly
[1:03:48] like it was in the beginning through
[1:03:50] sounds and wonders the living presence
[1:03:52] of jesus christ
[1:03:54] and after 2 000 years he's still alive
[1:03:56] and he's still the same yesterday today
[1:03:59] and forever
[1:04:00] amen to earnestly contend for that
[1:04:03] amen so so what should you and i do to
[1:04:05] what we've been restored back to we
[1:04:07] ought to earnestly contend for that
[1:04:10] amen amen earnestly contend amen to be
[1:04:13] that kind of church amen that what paul
[1:04:16] wanted to see
[1:04:17] that brother branham wanted to see the
[1:04:19] kind of church that jesus is coming back
[1:04:21] for
[1:04:23] that word earnestly amen with sincere
[1:04:26] and intense conviction i mean you're
[1:04:29] serious about it and man you're not
[1:04:31] loose about it amen but it's something
[1:04:33] that you come with sincerity amen i'm
[1:04:35] going to contend amen i'm going to
[1:04:37] contend amen i'm going to uphold
[1:04:40] amen amen what we've received
[1:04:43] i'm going to i'm going to hold fast to
[1:04:44] it and i'm going to stay with it i'm
[1:04:47] going to stick it out
[1:04:49] and then i'm going to give it all
[1:04:50] everything that i've got
[1:04:52] amen amen and i say tonight that it's
[1:04:54] worth your time it's worth our time and
[1:04:57] our energy
[1:04:58] i mean it's worth everything that we go
[1:05:00] through amen to get here it's worth
[1:05:02] everything the trials that we face and
[1:05:04] the afflictions that we go through and
[1:05:06] the sickness amen that we bear amen it's
[1:05:08] worth everything that we've got
[1:05:10] it's worth every bit of our energy
[1:05:14] brother branham said if i had
[1:05:16] countless lives i still live for him
[1:05:19] i mean if there was no heaven i'd still
[1:05:21] want to live this gospel way
[1:05:24] amen it's worth giving your life for
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] you can't take nothing with you amen
[1:05:31] only thing that's going to matter is
[1:05:32] what you do for him
[1:05:33] i mean everything in this life it ain't
[1:05:36] going to matter what you can accomplish
[1:05:38] only thing that'll matter is what we do
[1:05:39] for him
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] that early church they believed it was
[1:05:45] worth fighting for
[1:05:47] i mean that's what jude was trying to
[1:05:49] trying to get get to him amen i exhort
[1:05:51] you to earnestly contend for that faith
[1:05:55] amen amen it's not faith in a building
[1:05:57] or an association that well we're in the
[1:06:00] message or i'm associated with this
[1:06:02] brother or this group it's more than
[1:06:04] that
[1:06:05] amen but it's it's something a man of
[1:06:07] faith in that presence it's in a faith
[1:06:10] in the presence of the living god amen
[1:06:13] because that's the lifeline of the
[1:06:15] church amen amen we can come amen and we
[1:06:18] can quote all the all the cliches of the
[1:06:20] message and we can say all the right
[1:06:22] things amen but if his presence isn't
[1:06:24] there and when there's no lifeline
[1:06:26] there's no life in it amen but that's
[1:06:28] what we've got to contend for is the
[1:06:30] presence of the living god aiming to
[1:06:32] live our lives in such a way i mean that
[1:06:34] he'll be pleased with us amen to live
[1:06:36] our lives in such a way that it'll come
[1:06:38] down in the service and man it'll come
[1:06:40] by our way
[1:06:41] with his presence amen
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:46] amen to come in sincerity
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:49] coming
[1:06:50] and press forth
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:57] it's not a time to give up or go back
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] it's not a time to abandon
[1:07:03] what we believe
[1:07:05] it's not that time
[1:07:07] it's not a time to surrender
[1:07:09] it's not a time to give in
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:13] don't make peace with
[1:07:15] the things you deal with
[1:07:17] amen but contend

[1:10:04] his word is of no private interpretation
[1:10:06] he interprets his own word by
[1:10:08] vindicating it and proving it it's the
[1:10:10] truth
[1:10:11] amen but i like how he pointed out
[1:10:13] there's the real spirit-filled church
[1:10:15] they stay with the word
[1:10:17] and they reflect the word and it's god
[1:10:20] on earth and that's what we've been
[1:10:22] called to be am in the spirit amen

[1:10:31] wanting to reflect himself amen through
[1:10:33] his church

[1:10:42] believe we serve a living god who comes
[1:10:44] in the lives of men and women amen i
[1:10:47] believe we've received and are a part of
[1:10:49] the greatest message that's ever struck

[1:11:26] the bible amen

[1:11:40] healing amen it's for the believer
[1:11:42] tonight though god can heal anyone but

[1:11:48] children amen the bread amen it means
[1:11:51] salvation amen the holy ghost among the
[1:11:54] raptures for the believer amen that's
[1:11:56] what we're feeding upon the message of
[1:11:57] the hour to bring us to that amen and
[1:12:00] you can see generations before us and
[1:12:03] the things that that they dealt with and
[1:12:05] then as time goes on as the word is
