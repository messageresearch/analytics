[32:20] to heal the sick and The Afflicted
[32:22] you're going to raise up those Lord that

[32:47] amen
[32:50] are you happy to be in the house of the
[32:51] Lord tonight
[32:53] it's good to see the half of you that
[32:54] were gone back now if we just get the
[32:57] ones that were here back we'd be all
[32:58] right
[32:59] and well it's good that's okay you can
[33:01] laugh it's all right
[33:03] I had to lighten the mood just a little
[33:04] bit hey man it's good to be in church I
[33:06] tell you what I think there's no better
[33:07] place to be on a Wednesday night than in
[33:09] the house of the Lord
[33:10] if you do have your Bibles just before
[33:12] you're seated
[33:14] let's turn over to John chapter 11. and
[33:17] verse 17. it's a very familiar story so
[33:19] I may skip a verse every now and again
[33:21] brother Robert and I'll try not to hold
[33:23] you too long tonight
[33:25] amen you love the Lord
[33:26] in John chapter 11 verse 17.
[33:30] then when Jesus came he found that he
[33:32] had laying in the grave four days
[33:34] talking about Lazarus here he said now
[33:36] Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem about 15
[33:38] furlongs off and many of the Jews came
[33:40] to Martha and Mary to comfort them
[33:42] concerning their brother
[33:43] then Martha as soon as she had heard
[33:45] that Jesus was coming went and met him
[33:48] but Mary sits still in the house
[33:50] and we'll go down just a little bit
[33:52] farther
[33:53] and
[33:54] G and the level dude verse 23 Jesus
[33:57] saith unto her thy brother shall rise
[34:00] again Martha saith unto him I know that
[34:02] he shall rise again in the resurrection
[34:04] at the last day Jesus said unto her I am
[34:06] the resurrection and the life he that
[34:08] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[34:10] shall he live and whosoever believeth
[34:13] and believeth in me shall never die
[34:15] believeth thou this I wonder if we could
[34:18] say Amen to that
[34:20] we're Believers here tonight aren't we
[34:21] amen you may be seated may the Lord add
[34:23] His blessings to the word and
[34:27] just another portion of reading just
[34:29] before we go any farther here in the
[34:31] 32nd verse of the same chapter uh we'll
[34:35] go on down on that Story of Lazarus I
[34:37] think when you see this story here
[34:38] you'll understand where I'm going and
[34:40] you'll see that the power that God had
[34:43] was shown in Jesus here at the grave of
[34:46] Lazarus and when Mary was come where
[34:48] Jesus was and saw him she fell down at
[34:51] his feet saying unto him Lord if thou
[34:52] has been here my brother had not died
[34:54] and when Jesus therefore saw her weeping
[34:56] and the Jews also weeping which came
[34:58] with her he groaned in the spirit and
[35:01] was troubled
[35:02] and said where have you laid him and
[35:04] they said unto him Lord come and see and
[35:06] Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how
[35:09] he loved him and some of them said could
[35:12] not this man which opened the eyes of
[35:14] the blind have caused that even this man
[35:16] should not have died Jesus therefore
[35:18] again groaning in himself cometh to the
[35:19] Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon
[35:22] it and Jesus said take away the stone
[35:24] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[35:26] saith unto them Lord by this time he
[35:29] stinketh for he hath been dead for four
[35:31] days
[35:31] and Jesus said unto her said I not unto
[35:35] thee that if thou wouldst believe thou
[35:37] should see the glory of God Can We
[35:39] Believe here tonight I believe we can
[35:41] see the glory of God he said then they
[35:43] took away the Stone from the place where
[35:45] the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up
[35:48] his eyes and said father I thank thee
[35:51] that thou has heard me and he knew and I
[35:53] knew that thou Hearst me always but
[35:55] because of the people which stand by I
[35:57] said it that they may believe that thou
[36:00] has sent me and when he thus had spoken
[36:03] he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[36:05] forth and he that was dead come forth
[36:08] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[36:10] and his face was bound about with a
[36:12] napkin Jesus said unto them loose him
[36:15] and let him go
[36:16] I want you to think about that for just
[36:18] a little bit now how many can we can
[36:20] type this in so many different ways but
[36:22] the way I would like to take it tonight
[36:23] is Jesus right here at the grave of
[36:25] Lazarus is showing us that he had a
[36:28] human element
[36:29] he could stand there at the grave of
[36:31] Lazarus and he could weep he could he
[36:33] could groan and he could moan he could
[36:35] be sad for his friend it was a good
[36:36] friend of Jesus Lazarus was and so he
[36:39] could stand there at the grave and as a
[36:41] human he could feel what we would feel
[36:43] in a time of death he could feel what it
[36:46] would be like to lose a close friend or
[36:48] to lose someone that uh that you would
[36:50] love and maybe maybe he knew all he had
[36:52] to know how this would feel in order to
[36:54] intercede for us
[36:56] but he went on and and I love it here
[36:58] because brother Brandon would actually
[37:00] tell a story about Lazarus and there was
[37:03] a woman that had come to him and the
[37:05] woman had told him that he couldn't be
[37:07] divine you remember the story she said
[37:09] brother Branham she was saying Jesus she
[37:11] said the only problem I have is you make
[37:13] too much out of Jesus and he said well I
[37:15] hope that's the only problem I've got
[37:16] and he said and she said well you make
[37:19] him Divine and he's not Divine brother
[37:21] Brandon said oh he's he was God or he
[37:23] was the greatest deceiver of the world
[37:25] ever had that's what brother Brandon
[37:26] said about him and so brother Brandon
[37:28] went on down through the story and this
[37:30] woman had said he wasn't Divine and she
[37:31] said she could prove it by by scripture
[37:34] and so she went down and she tried to do
[37:37] it she took him to the verse there that
[37:38] Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus and
[37:40] so that proved that Jesus was not Divine
[37:42] brother Branham said he may have been a
[37:44] man when he stood there at the grave of
[37:46] Lazarus and wept but he said when he
[37:48] pulled them little frail shoulders back
[37:49] he said that was nothing but God himself
[37:52] and I want to tell you tonight you may
[37:55] not see much in a person sitting next to
[37:57] you it may look just like frail flesh
[37:59] but if the spirit of God is in that
[38:01] person if they pull their shoulders back
[38:03] and they speak the word of God then all
[38:06] hell will tremble and all hell will
[38:07] shake at the name of Jesus when the
[38:09] believer utters the name tonight why
[38:11] because the same power that was in Jesus
[38:13] at the grave of Lazarus is the same
[38:15] power that's in you tonight and and what
[38:18] it is it's and we think of being
[38:20] powerful and and how great that would be
[38:22] but really it's an authority because
[38:23] it's something given to us by God it's
[38:25] not just a power that we would have
[38:27] ourselves but it is an authority that
[38:29] would that Jesus would have I'm kind of
[38:31] getting ahead of myself here so brother
[38:32] Brandon would say it like this he said
[38:34] Martha when she went to meet Jesus he
[38:36] said if there was anyone had a right to
[38:37] condemn it would have been Martha
[38:39] because she had sent for Jesus to come
[38:41] pray for her brother when he was in a
[38:43] serious condition dying and Jesus had
[38:45] left the church they had come out of the
[38:47] old dead movement that they were in
[38:48] brother Branham throws that in there and
[38:49] I like that
[38:51] he said it had followed the Lord Jesus
[38:53] believing him to be the anointed Messiah
[38:55] and then his very friend Lazarus that he
[38:58] come up with they had been
[38:59] excommunicated from their church and
[39:01] from their society and his friend that
[39:03] he came up with was laying sick at the
[39:04] point of death and the doctor could do
[39:06] him no good and she sent for Jesus and
[39:09] Jesus simply ignored her sending
[39:13] brother William said she had a right to
[39:14] be upset at that she had a right to be
[39:17] angry that Jesus didn't come and heal
[39:18] her brother because she knew he could
[39:20] remember she had faith
[39:22] and he went to another city and did the
[39:24] same thing there they sent him again sin
[39:26] again and he just ignored it and went on
[39:28] and after Lazarus was dead and had been
[39:30] buried for four days his face had
[39:31] already fell in by that time that hot
[39:34] country that nose falls in he said I'm
[39:36] told and probably his flesh had already
[39:38] fell in because after 72 hours
[39:39] corruption sets in the body and so we
[39:42] find out he was already dead and then
[39:43] after he was dead and it was all over
[39:45] then Here Comes Jesus slipping into the
[39:47] city so then they knowed that he was
[39:50] going to get criticized because perhaps
[39:52] he was already criticized but Martha had
[39:55] been very dilatory seemingly about
[39:58] fixing a place for Jesus to sleep
[40:00] and a place for him to eat and so forth
[40:02] and even asked Jesus one time to make
[40:04] her sister come help but down in her
[40:07] heart Faith struck
[40:08] he said while Mary sat still crying and
[40:10] doing nothing about it and give up
[40:11] Martha slips out of the house down
[40:13] through the city he said no doubt she
[40:15] met some of the streets said where is
[40:17] that Divine healer that you had around
[40:18] here what about Lazarus now she passed
[40:21] right on by them look at them
[40:22] unbelievers coming and trying to tempt
[40:24] her faith she goes right on down and
[40:26] he's he said watch how she was she run
[40:29] up to him she had right to it she had a
[40:31] right to upgrade him he said she had a
[40:33] right to tell him why didn't you come
[40:35] when I called for you that would have
[40:36] been a Pentecostal of today or a Baptist
[40:38] or Presbyterian or I would say a message
[40:40] believer today and they would change
[40:42] churches right quick see why didn't you
[40:44] come when we called you she had a right
[40:46] to semen right to seemingly but she
[40:49] didn't have a right to he said he said
[40:51] as I said last night you have no thought
[40:53] it's his thought see what he does thy
[40:55] will be done pray like this he is not an
[40:57] Aaron boy he is a God he said notice thy
[41:00] kingdom come thy will be done and when
[41:02] he got to him he approached him in the
[41:03] right way and she said give him his
[41:05] right title Lord not a braid him but
[41:07] Lord if thou would have been here my
[41:09] brother would not have died Oh my he
[41:11] said I can see him pulling his little
[41:12] tired body together he said if you would
[41:14] have been here my brother would not have
[41:15] died but even now whatever you ask God
[41:18] God will give it to you can you see the
[41:20] authority that Christ had because of the
[41:22] spirit of God that was in him he was the
[41:24] fullness of God God and the fullness of
[41:26] God dwelled in him and that gave him
[41:28] this Authority and and he would go on
[41:30] and he said she know God of creation was
[41:32] she note he was the anointed Messiah she
[41:35] approached him right upon her knees and
[41:36] said Lord if you would have been here my
[41:38] brother would not have died but even now
[41:40] whatever you ask God will give it to you
[41:42] or if we could only think even now Lord
[41:45] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[41:47] you he said I am the resurrection in
[41:49] life no other man could ever say that I
[41:51] am the resurrection of life he that
[41:53] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[41:55] shall he live whosoever believeth and
[41:57] believeth in me shall never die brother
[41:58] Rand is quoting the scripture we read
[42:00] there and said yay Lord I believe that
[42:02] you're the son of God
[42:04] that was to come into the world he said
[42:06] where have you buried him and he goes on
[42:08] he said I was talking to the woman and I
[42:10] told you the story about the woman here
[42:12] and she said you brag too much on Jesus
[42:14] and and of course you know when she said
[42:16] that uh she said when he wept and he
[42:18] wasn't Divine because he wept and
[42:19] brother Brandon makes this statement and
[42:21] I kind of like it it's a little funny he
[42:22] said that's thinner than the broth made
[42:24] out of a shadow of a chicken that's
[42:25] starved to death he said because that
[42:27] won't hold up to the Bible he said look
[42:29] he goes down to the tomb he stood before
[42:32] the tomb and he straightened his little
[42:33] body and said Lazarus come forth he
[42:35] might have been a man crying but when he
[42:37] called that man out of the Grave oh I
[42:39] wonder today if we could just speak the
[42:41] word and watch Miracles take place if we
[42:43] could just maybe pull our shoulders back
[42:45] and pull ourselves together a little bit
[42:46] why cry he said but speak the word and
[42:49] it'll come to pass and he said he said
[42:51] he'd been dead four days his soul four
[42:53] days journey somewhere he said I don't
[42:55] know where he was at neither do you he
[42:56] said he called him back corruption knew
[42:58] it's Master the soul knew its creator he
[43:00] said a man had been dead stood on his
[43:02] feet and lived again after being dead
[43:03] four days that was more than a man that
[43:06] was God he said it was a man when he
[43:08] come down off the mountain that night
[43:09] and was hungry and he looked all over a
[43:11] fig tree to find something to eat he was
[43:13] a man when he was hungry but when he'd
[43:15] taken five biscuits and two fish and fed
[43:17] five thousand he said that was more than
[43:19] a man
[43:20] he said he was a man when he was laying
[43:22] out in the back of the boat that night
[43:23] when ten thousand Devils of the sea
[43:25] swore they would drown him and that
[43:26] little old boat in the storm like a
[43:28] bottle stopped stop her out there
[43:29] somewhere floating up and down like that
[43:31] he said he was a man when he was asleep
[43:32] he was tired virtue had went out of him
[43:34] but when he put his foot up on the
[43:36] Braille of the boat and looked up and
[43:38] said peace be still and the winds and
[43:40] the waves obeyed him that was more than
[43:42] a man that was God in Christ reconciling
[43:45] the world to himself he said he was a
[43:47] man when he died on the cross crying for
[43:49] Mercy that's right but he said he was
[43:50] God on Easter morning aren't you
[43:52] thankful he said when he broke the seal
[43:54] was in the Tomb rose up and sent it on
[43:56] high said yes sir every ever living to
[43:59] make intercessions every man and woman
[44:01] that ever amounted to a hill of beans
[44:03] believe that that's what he said
[44:05] every man or woman would have to believe
[44:07] that he said yes sir he's the same
[44:09] yesterday and forever and brother
[44:10] Branham asked his congregation this he
[44:12] said believe us thou this and I wonder
[44:14] tonight could I ask you that tonight do
[44:16] you believe that Jesus Christ was the
[44:19] son of God and in him build the fullness
[44:21] of the godhead bodily and I believe
[44:23] tonight that that same spirit that
[44:25] raised Christ from the dead is living in
[44:27] the bride body today and it will Quicken
[44:29] us for a Rapture one of these mornings
[44:31] I'll tell you what church I think it's
[44:32] time then we take the gloves off and
[44:34] just go at that devil once in a while
[44:36] tell him who we are we are the
[44:38] Unstoppable force in this world we are
[44:40] the very Body of Christ in this age
[44:42] there's nothing can hold us down when
[44:44] Rapture time comes nothing can keep us
[44:46] here when God calls our name remember
[44:48] the name has always been there he
[44:51] already saw you there he said I know you
[44:53] before the foundation of the world and
[44:55] I'm so thankful for tonight it don't
[44:57] matter what I've done here but God who
[44:59] is rich in Mercy looked down and he sent
[45:01] his son with the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:03] and he looked at him and he he made him
[45:05] die as a man so he could feel the pain
[45:07] and things that we have to feel he could
[45:09] be tempted like a man he could make him
[45:11] like a man and have a headache and have
[45:13] sickness and all these things but then
[45:15] when he died he could raise up and be
[45:17] totally gone and that same spirit that
[45:20] would raise him out of that tomb he said
[45:22] he would send back to the church and he
[45:24] would Quicken us that ought to make
[45:26] somebody shout tonight it's going to
[45:28] Quicken your mortal bodies one of these
[45:29] days
[45:30] nothing can hold us down what was it he
[45:33] said it was God in Christ what is it
[45:35] today Christ in you
[45:38] God in Christ Christ and you and today
[45:41] we can see he said every word of God is
[45:42] a written sworn Authority and that's the
[45:45] word I want to show you tonight is the
[45:46] authority that we have through Christ he
[45:49] said it is a written sworn Authority he
[45:52] said it's the absolute right of the
[45:54] believer to accept this as the
[45:56] infallible truth because it is God's
[45:59] word and he said heavens and earth will
[46:01] pass away but my word will never pass
[46:03] away he said saith the Lord it must be
[46:07] fulfilled in its season and brother
[46:09] Branham goes on down and I want to ask
[46:11] this question do we have the same
[46:12] authority Jesus had
[46:14] do we have the same Authority he had
[46:16] then we can do the same Works he did
[46:19] and Romans 8 11 he said but it's a
[46:21] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[46:23] the dead dwells in you he that raised up
[46:25] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[46:27] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[46:30] dwelleth in you and if the spirit of
[46:32] Christ is in you you can speak and go
[46:35] forward you don't have to cry any longer
[46:37] you don't have to live in a backslidden
[46:39] condition you can speak to that devil
[46:41] and tell him to get out of your way you
[46:43] can speak to that symptom and it can
[46:45] leave you can speak to whatever the
[46:48] situation is and it will change because
[46:50] of what you said because of what you
[46:52] speak he said he that believeth in me
[46:54] the works that I do shall he do also he
[46:57] said there you are he said and don't
[46:59] doubt it in your heart but believe that
[47:00] what you've said will come to pass
[47:02] remember this is a third pull hour than
[47:05] what you speak actually matters now
[47:07] because it's Christ in you remember what
[47:09] you say is the very spirit of God
[47:12] speaking you are as the very Oracle of
[47:14] God speaking remember it's not just the
[47:16] preacher it's not it's every one of you
[47:18] it doesn't matter retro position it
[47:20] doesn't matter who you are what your
[47:21] last name is what it is it's Christ in
[47:24] you that makes you all the same
[47:26] it doesn't matter now you may have a
[47:28] position you may have a gift you we've
[47:29] heard about the gifts and the callings
[47:30] and things in your life that's that's
[47:32] wonderful but when it comes to Salvation
[47:34] when it comes to the baptism of the Holy
[47:36] Ghost you're all the same
[47:37] and he said but believe in your heart
[47:39] you can have what you've said he said
[47:41] glory to God it's my God revealing
[47:43] himself in humility amen God taking a
[47:46] humble Sinner and cleansing him by his
[47:48] blood dropping that confessed sin
[47:50] remember confess sin into that Clorox
[47:53] bleach of the blood of the Son of God
[47:55] and putting his own life into that man
[47:57] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[47:59] then if we have the genuine baptism of
[48:01] the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us when
[48:03] the type listen to this when Elijah
[48:06] dropped the robe for Elisha he got a
[48:08] double portion of it Jesus said the
[48:10] works that I do you shall do also and
[48:13] greater shall you do for I go unto my
[48:15] father he said what's wrong church he
[48:17] said you've called us a bills above of
[48:19] visions and things like that he said get
[48:20] off my back brother get down to the
[48:22] Cross get to the gospel he said we don't
[48:24] have to impersonate why would you take
[48:26] an impersonation why would you take some
[48:29] false conception of it when the skies
[48:31] are full of the genuine he said
[48:33] Pentecostal power that makes a man or
[48:35] woman or a son of God he said takes him
[48:37] back to the prayer presence of God he
[48:39] said there you are God revealing himself
[48:41] in humility he's not going to use the
[48:43] the big names maybe to confound the wise
[48:45] but he's going to use the simple people
[48:47] he's going to use somebody to maybe not
[48:49] know how to speak their words either
[48:50] just like me and he don't know how to
[48:52] put their words together and you don't
[48:54] know how to maybe speak as eloquently as
[48:55] some would but listen God can use
[48:57] anybody God can use anybody he wants to
[49:00] use and when he puts his spirit in you
[49:02] he didn't ask you if you knew your ABCs
[49:04] or you knew how to read and write but he
[49:06] asked you if you'd be willing to be a
[49:07] vessel that he could use for his glory
[49:09] and that's who God's going to use
[49:11] tonight he said it's the same
[49:13] Pentecostal power
[49:14] that makes a man or woman a daughter of
[49:17] God he said you've got to get away from
[49:19] your own thoughts you've got to let the
[49:21] mind that was in Christ be in you you've
[49:23] got to stay there till every sin of fear
[49:25] every sin of Doubt is gone from your
[49:27] heart he said if you're there and God
[49:29] doesn't take you and omit your sins and
[49:30] send you into the presence of God he
[49:33] said there is something wrong with your
[49:35] experience he said I don't care how many
[49:37] degrees of doctor you have or how big
[49:40] your church you've got he said what kind
[49:42] of a big will you belong to he said how
[49:44] many organizations whatever it is has
[49:45] nothing to do with it until your sins
[49:47] are confessed and in the blood of Jesus
[49:50] Christ he said you stand an adulterated
[49:53] a born-again son and daughter of God
[49:55] with the life of God in you to speak a
[49:58] word of creation let this mountain be
[50:00] moved and it'll mind you he said God
[50:02] revealing himself in humility I love how
[50:04] he keeps going back to that God
[50:06] revealing himself in in humility in
[50:09] Simplicity God and hiding himself in
[50:11] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[50:13] same he said and he picks them up just
[50:14] kind of believed like that he said I
[50:16] think the father creator of heavens and
[50:18] earth thou has hid these things from the
[50:20] wise and prudent aren't you thankful for
[50:22] that tonight you don't have to be wise
[50:24] you don't have to have a degree to
[50:25] understand the scriptures to be one of
[50:27] God's own children he said and he goes
[50:30] on and that's in God hiding himself in
[50:31] Simplicity 1963 if you go listen to that
[50:34] it's just a wonderful uh brother Brandon
[50:36] goes over and over about how God is
[50:38] hiding himself in in human flesh and
[50:40] hiding himself behind the veil and so
[50:42] forth like that is something we need to
[50:44] understand today church that God can
[50:46] actually come down and be in a flesh
[50:49] body today and do the same works that he
[50:51] did while he was here on Earth he can
[50:53] still raise the dead like he did in
[50:54] Lazarus he can still go and speak to a
[50:57] mountain and move it out of the way if
[50:59] need be God is still God and he's never
[51:01] going to change
[51:03] The Authority we have is what the word
[51:06] says
[51:08] anything you say that is in the word
[51:11] is the saith the Lord can I say it like
[51:13] that
[51:14] everything that God has already said you
[51:17] can say that's thus saith the Lord now
[51:19] we don't throw thus saith the Lord
[51:20] around because that's not our place but
[51:23] if it's in the word you can say it's
[51:24] what the word says it's what God said
[51:26] it's what the Lord said and so the
[51:29] authority we have is to speak whatever
[51:30] the word promises and it will be so and
[51:34] so our Authority comes from the very
[51:36] Spirit of Christ think it's the same
[51:39] spirit so we have the same Authority
[51:42] the same Authority are you with me I see
[51:45] I pulled a bin and so it's not so much
[51:48] our power brother Branham says this but
[51:50] the authority and brother Braham tells a
[51:53] story he said uh for instance here comes
[51:55] a little policeman out there on the
[51:56] highway he's so little until his cat
[51:58] pulls his ears down and he won't weigh
[52:00] over about a hundred pounds and he said
[52:01] now how much power has he got to stop
[52:04] one of them cars he said some of them
[52:06] just three or four he said just as hard
[52:08] as they can pour down that Highway at
[52:10] 300 horsepower each he said and he
[52:12] couldn't even stop one horsepower he
[52:14] said and there these cars are
[52:16] but let that big bad shine and he said
[52:18] let him raise up that hand and he might
[52:20] not have the power but he's got
[52:22] Authority
[52:23] he said listen at the brake squeak when
[52:25] run sideways and everybody stop why
[52:26] because he's got Authority he said I
[52:29] don't have any power you don't have any
[52:31] power but we have got Authority he said
[52:34] the badge of Faith hanging on the word
[52:36] he said I believe it it's the truth
[52:39] that's what stops when you can be
[52:42] persistent he said little policeman
[52:43] stand up there and blow that little
[52:44] whistle and hold his hand up he said
[52:46] I'll tell you everything is going to
[52:47] stop because it's his authority
[52:50] so it's not just your power you could be
[52:53] powerless even and still have full
[52:55] authority over the devil you can still
[52:58] have full Authority because what it is
[52:59] what is it God has put a badge on you
[53:03] and said you're mine and you can speak
[53:05] to this mountain
[53:06] he gave you Authority when you joined
[53:08] the academy and he put you through all
[53:11] kinds of training and all kinds of
[53:12] different things that you had to go
[53:13] through to learn on the job and he gets
[53:16] you set in a position then he puts you
[53:18] in a uniform gives you your badge gives
[53:20] you a weapon gives you Shield or think
[53:22] about a church he gives you everything
[53:24] you have need of to defeat the Devil and
[53:27] then when he did that he the devil
[53:29] looked at you and thought you're nothing
[53:30] but what you were you're still the same
[53:32] old sinner that you was but remember now
[53:35] you've changed because what you were was
[53:37] a powerless human being but now you are
[53:40] a son of God with full Authority from
[53:42] God
[53:43] it is something that God has done for
[53:45] you it is just like that little
[53:47] policeman you may not look like much you
[53:49] may not weigh much you may not be able
[53:51] to stop traffic you may not be able to
[53:53] stop cancer from coming
[53:55] but you can absolutely cast that demon
[53:57] out from your body
[53:58] you say how can I do it it's got to be
[54:00] Christ that does it yes his Spirit
[54:02] dwelleth In You
[54:04] brother Branham goes on he talks about
[54:06] sister Hattie Wright
[54:08] many of you know this about sister
[54:09] hattian
[54:10] he said little sister quiet sister
[54:12] Hattie he called her sitting back there
[54:14] a little dust bonded on like the country
[54:16] women wear he said she'd put on a clean
[54:18] little dress to come over to help her
[54:20] mother cook me a dinner and she was
[54:22] sitting with her hand like this she said
[54:23] that's nothing but the truth she
[54:25] responded to something brother Branham
[54:27] said and she said the right thing he
[54:29] said here's my Bible and as a servant of
[54:31] God I say this I could hardly hear the
[54:33] last things she said her mother was
[54:36] trying to say something but I didn't get
[54:38] it just as she said that that's nothing
[54:41] but the truth she said the right thing
[54:43] the spirit of the Lord said to me tell
[54:44] her
[54:45] to ask what she will
[54:47] and you give it to her now remember she
[54:51] had to say something she had to speak
[54:53] this was the third poll In Action For
[54:55] the First Time by the way
[54:57] he said tell her to ask what she will
[54:59] and you'll give it to her he said I
[55:01] couldn't speak that room everybody felt
[55:04] strange he said I said sister Hattie she
[55:06] said yes brother Brandon I said thus
[55:08] saith the Lord speak anything you desire
[55:11] I don't care what it is if you want to
[55:13] know what God's give this ministry speak
[55:15] anything that you desire thus saith the
[55:18] Lord if you'll speak it it'll speak it
[55:20] behind you and you'll have it right
[55:21] there
[55:22] he said eight people standing there
[55:24] looking she said brother Branham what
[55:26] shall I say
[55:27] he said I said it's up to you and there
[55:29] said her crippled sister
[55:31] her old father she was poor she could
[55:33] have asked for money she could have
[55:35] asked for anything she wanted to I said
[55:37] ask anything that's in your heart
[55:39] anything that you want
[55:40] and thus saith the Lord I'll speak it
[55:42] behind you and you'll have it and she
[55:44] said the salvation of my two boys you
[55:46] know the story
[55:48] I said you have it in the name of the
[55:51] Lord and those two little modern teenage
[55:53] nickel Fritz boys brother random calls
[55:54] them
[55:55] that hated the very cause of Christ
[55:57] grabbed one another and began to scream
[55:59] the blessings of God
[56:00] there's your quote if you're against
[56:02] screaming
[56:04] this was a supernatural power
[56:08] they grabbed themselves
[56:10] then begin to scream the blessings of
[56:12] God
[56:12] the power of God brother Branham calls
[56:15] it in the room struck that place
[56:17] he said brother Banks fell into his
[56:19] plate he said I don't know what happened
[56:21] for about 10 minutes he said friend do
[56:23] you realize what that was he said I have
[56:26] never in all my life had felt such an
[56:28] anointing he said the first time it was
[56:30] ever performed on a human being it
[56:33] bypassed the aristocrats it bypassed
[56:36] everything else and went to a poor
[56:37] little widow woman living up on the hill
[56:39] there and God knowed what she'd asked
[56:41] for her two boys was gloriously saved
[56:44] that very minute it was spoken if she
[56:46] would have asked for ten thousand
[56:48] dollars it would have been given to her
[56:49] if she'd have asked for her sister's
[56:51] healing it would have been given to her
[56:52] anything she would have asked it would
[56:55] have been given to her think about it
[56:58] God knew what she would ask for
[57:00] now that was Sister Hattie
[57:03] and that was the first time brother Bram
[57:04] said it was used on a human in that way
[57:08] now what about now
[57:10] we have the same promise
[57:13] we had the same God the same spirit
[57:17] why do we sit here sometimes I wonder
[57:19] why do we have to sit back like like
[57:21] we're defeated
[57:24] when there's no reason for that
[57:26] because the same God that raised Lazarus
[57:29] from the dead came and showed himself
[57:31] alive in our generation and that same
[57:34] God did not leave with the prophet but
[57:37] he would come again and prove himself to
[57:39] us in The Bride of Jesus Christ remember
[57:41] it's not just brother Branham that had
[57:43] the gift of discernment now let's let me
[57:45] stop there but the discernment is that
[57:47] every one of you you can discern spirits
[57:49] now we don't use it in the way brother
[57:51] Branham did according to brother Branham
[57:52] he said that would be one time when you
[57:54] could turn your back and discern the
[57:55] thoughts of the people one time to to a
[57:57] generation one time to a people
[57:58] one time doing age sorry one time to an
[58:00] age that would only happen like that but
[58:03] you have the same God in you
[58:06] know brother Brahm said you can tell who
[58:08] has the Holy Ghost if you're around him
[58:11] if you're a Holy Ghost Field Christian
[58:12] you can tell those who have it so you do
[58:14] have a certain amount of discernment in
[58:15] you that's part of it
[58:17] but the same spirit that was in Christ
[58:20] if it's in you
[58:21] and if we could show that it was the
[58:23] same spirit that was in brother Branham
[58:25] we'll just say it like that the same
[58:28] Spirit was in Christ Same Spirit was in
[58:29] brother Branham why would it stop there
[58:31] when brother Brandon was very message we
[58:33] should show you that he would never
[58:35] leave until the very end
[58:38] so we have the same Authority that the
[58:40] prophet had
[58:41] because remember it wasn't him that
[58:43] spoke to Sister Hattie it was Sister
[58:46] Hattie this spoke he said whatever you
[58:49] say you say to this mountain you say to
[58:52] this demon of sickness you say that your
[58:54] family's gone look they're coming back
[58:56] whatever you say
[58:58] it's the voice of God in the bride in
[59:00] the last day he said you will be the
[59:03] final voice to the final age I wonder if
[59:05] we could really grasp that thought
[59:07] tonight it's not just back in the
[59:09] prophet yes it was in a prophet yes it
[59:11] was in a man named Jesus yes it was in
[59:13] maybe the apostles too but listen it's
[59:15] in you tonight the very same God it's in
[59:18] you
[59:19] the very same God he never changes and
[59:22] he never will but he's always been the
[59:24] same God I wonder if we could just
[59:26] realize that tonight and we could lay
[59:28] aside all of our doubts and our fears
[59:30] and our Demons of Oppression and
[59:31] depression and we could realize that the
[59:33] very same God that has brought us to
[59:35] this place today is going to carry us
[59:37] all the way to the end of time because
[59:39] he's never left you he's never going to
[59:41] leave you he said I will never leave you
[59:43] I will never forsake you but I'll be
[59:45] with you even in you until the end of
[59:47] the world and this is not the end yet
[59:48] church it's close but it's not yet so
[59:51] he's still in you he's still with you
[59:53] he's still here today he's still here
[59:55] tonight I believe it do you I believe
[59:57] he's here
[59:59] he said and brother Brian goes on and he
[1:00:00] said now this is God's word this is the
[1:00:02] first always and any religious Doctrine
[1:00:04] he said that's not based upon the word
[1:00:05] of God through the entire word of God he
[1:00:07] said I'm afraid of it you can make the
[1:00:08] word say anything by twisting it around
[1:00:10] but it must be proven to be the truth
[1:00:12] and he said now it must be proven the
[1:00:15] truth and now he said I come if I come
[1:00:17] and told you I could heal you I'll be
[1:00:19] doing something contrary to the word for
[1:00:20] the word doesn't teach it that way he
[1:00:22] said I can't do something Jesus has
[1:00:24] already done he healed you when he died
[1:00:26] for you that scripture he was wounded
[1:00:28] for your transgressions by his stripes
[1:00:30] you were healed he said and Moses had
[1:00:32] the brass serpent lifted it up in the
[1:00:33] wilderness and so forth brother man goes
[1:00:35] on here he said the children had
[1:00:36] murmured against God and against Moses
[1:00:38] and serpents had bitten them so it
[1:00:40] healed their sick and forgave their sin
[1:00:41] and he said just as the brass serpent
[1:00:43] was lifted up so must the son of man be
[1:00:45] lifted up for the same cause he said
[1:00:47] there you are so what has he done he
[1:00:50] said I cannot do it no one else but now
[1:00:52] if you can appropriate your faith have
[1:00:54] faith to believe that he has did this
[1:00:56] it's for you individually you then the
[1:00:59] healing will be there it will not fail
[1:01:02] it will not fail the healing will be
[1:01:04] there if you believe it for you
[1:01:05] individually he said he said these
[1:01:08] pastors here throughout the country's
[1:01:09] wonderful men of God anointed of God
[1:01:11] they have just as much right to pray for
[1:01:12] the sick as I do or anyone else he said
[1:01:15] not only the pastor but every member of
[1:01:17] the church has a right to pray for the
[1:01:19] sick the gift of healing works in the
[1:01:21] church the entire church not only in the
[1:01:23] Pastor said confess your faults one to
[1:01:25] another and pray for one another that
[1:01:26] you may be healed for the effectual
[1:01:28] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:01:30] availeth much he said I believe him
[1:01:33] so I want you to see here tonight and I
[1:01:35] won't I won't hold you along but I want
[1:01:36] you to see really see that the authority
[1:01:39] that Christ had at the grave of Lazarus
[1:01:41] was the same thing brother Branham
[1:01:42] showed throughout his entire Ministry
[1:01:44] but we can't leave it there
[1:01:46] well we're doing the same thing in a
[1:01:48] dominational system did they would take
[1:01:50] so much of the word and leave off some
[1:01:52] of it and they would take a portion here
[1:01:54] and leave off some other but we have to
[1:01:55] take the entirety of the word and the
[1:01:58] full word in this day will give you full
[1:02:00] Authority for this hour and that's what
[1:02:02] we must come into in this day it's not
[1:02:04] just the emotion I believe that I
[1:02:06] believe the word of God will Quicken you
[1:02:08] I believe that God will cause an emotion
[1:02:10] in your life I do believe that but it's
[1:02:11] not about how you feel it's not about
[1:02:13] the emotion that you show it's not about
[1:02:15] how how much you dance or how much you
[1:02:17] shout although those things are good and
[1:02:19] I enjoy it but what it is it's the word
[1:02:21] of God being made manifest in your life
[1:02:23] it is a living epistle read of all men
[1:02:26] remember church I don't care if you feel
[1:02:27] really bad in the morning when you wake
[1:02:29] up you are still an heir of everything
[1:02:31] that God's got you still have every
[1:02:33] promise of God right there at your
[1:02:34] fingertips why because you are a son or
[1:02:37] a daughter of God and nothing can binds
[1:02:40] you nothing can hold you back I love it
[1:02:41] I'll tell you I believe if we could just
[1:02:44] really get on fire for God and and just
[1:02:46] look into the word and and you start to
[1:02:48] study it and you see the promises I
[1:02:49] believe the promises of God will just
[1:02:51] cause such a stir in your life that it
[1:02:53] will you can't help but get a little
[1:02:54] emotional about it sometimes it'll make
[1:02:57] tears run down your face when you think
[1:02:58] of what he did for you Calvary it'll
[1:03:00] make you shout a little bit when you
[1:03:02] realize that God himself came down on a
[1:03:04] human flesh and he got sick and he'd
[1:03:06] have a headache sometimes just so he
[1:03:08] would know how you feel
[1:03:10] just so he would know that one's got a
[1:03:13] headache it's nothing too little for God
[1:03:15] he would go to interceding for you and
[1:03:18] then he would send his Spirit to you and
[1:03:19] then the spirit in you you can look at
[1:03:21] somebody else you can look at your
[1:03:22] brother you can look at your sister and
[1:03:24] you can intercede for them why because
[1:03:26] it's the same spirit that Christ had
[1:03:29] it doesn't make me God it doesn't make
[1:03:31] you God but what it does it's the spirit
[1:03:33] of God that has been given to you in
[1:03:35] this day
[1:03:36] I believe that's what we need in the
[1:03:38] body tonight it'll take away all this
[1:03:41] dryness that comes upon us and
[1:03:43] backbiting and and all these things
[1:03:45] where you're trying to you're trying to
[1:03:47] trying to put out the spirit of God in
[1:03:49] the church and you're trying to to bring
[1:03:50] yourselves back to a maybe uh Lord help
[1:03:53] me here you're trying to take yourself
[1:03:54] back to something maybe in Pentecost
[1:03:57] but what we have now is the fullness of
[1:03:59] the word what we have now is everything
[1:04:02] you have need up for a Rapture that
[1:04:04] should make us the happiest people in
[1:04:05] the world because what they had at
[1:04:07] Pentecost was good but what they had at
[1:04:09] Pentecost wasn't material for a Rapture
[1:04:10] because Elijah had not yet come but now
[1:04:13] Elijah has come and proved that what
[1:04:16] Jesus did he could do and what he did
[1:04:18] the bride will do the same works
[1:04:20] remember when brother Brandon was taking
[1:04:22] a type there when Elijah went up and he
[1:04:24] left the mantle he said a double portion
[1:04:26] is on the bride
[1:04:28] I'll tell you what that's strong but
[1:04:29] that's good he and and brother Branham
[1:04:31] goes on down here and he said when any
[1:04:33] believer comes to God he becomes God's
[1:04:36] attribute of his word he is used to
[1:04:39] manifest the word that's promised for
[1:04:41] that day see that's right God rich and
[1:04:43] mercy has never left us without a
[1:04:45] testimony he is rich in Mercy he said he
[1:04:49] said now remember in Christ we are the
[1:04:51] Flesh of his flesh bone of his bone when
[1:04:53] God was wounded at Christ when when God
[1:04:55] wounded Christ at Calvary he was wounded
[1:04:58] for me and you we are the Flesh of his
[1:05:00] flesh and bone of his bone body of his
[1:05:01] body name of his name bride of him he
[1:05:04] said he said we are in him we are his
[1:05:07] Flesh and Bones
[1:05:09] the very Body of Christ we are the Flesh
[1:05:11] and Bone Body of Christ on Earth today
[1:05:15] we are the only literal Body of Christ
[1:05:17] that there is on this Earth
[1:05:19] and I do believe in a literal coming of
[1:05:21] Christ I do brother Bram said every
[1:05:23] believer believes that but what we have
[1:05:25] now brother Graham said he would send
[1:05:27] his body he would send his spirit in and
[1:05:29] make up a collective body made up of
[1:05:31] many members and we are part of that
[1:05:33] body I believe that I hope you do too I
[1:05:35] I know I am I'm by faith I am one of his
[1:05:38] I believe every one of us should have
[1:05:40] that testimony he said he would never
[1:05:41] leave the Earth without a testimony so
[1:05:43] if I'm the last one or if you're the
[1:05:44] last one we should all think that way if
[1:05:47] nobody else but me
[1:05:48] that I want to be that one but I don't
[1:05:51] believe that everybody else is not going
[1:05:53] to make it I don't believe God is that
[1:05:54] small
[1:05:55] I believe God is is big enough to to
[1:05:58] take care of us you know you think about
[1:06:00] those we think about the small minority
[1:06:03] group and we think well maybe it's only
[1:06:04] one or two here one or two out of the
[1:06:06] another it could be that way
[1:06:08] but you know even if he took everybody
[1:06:09] in here it'd be a small minority group
[1:06:11] little minority group
[1:06:12] so let's not limit the powers of God
[1:06:15] whatever you have need of you can ask
[1:06:17] God and he'll give it to you because
[1:06:19] whatever you speak
[1:06:20] it says the Oracles of God speaking
[1:06:22] Jesus would go or brother going down
[1:06:24] here and he said God has already raised
[1:06:25] us up potentially the quickening power
[1:06:27] that raises from the life of sin changed
[1:06:29] our being it has potentially raised up
[1:06:31] Christ Jesus
[1:06:32] which the resurrection will bring us
[1:06:34] forth in the full maturity he said now
[1:06:37] remember we died and our own name was
[1:06:39] buried raised in his he said see we're
[1:06:41] no more of our own of which that great
[1:06:43] name of Jesus Christ he said the Bible
[1:06:45] said over here in Ephesians 1 21 both
[1:06:47] the families in Heaven and Earth is
[1:06:49] named after that name that's where God
[1:06:51] put his name that's the family's name in
[1:06:52] heaven that's the family's name on Earth
[1:06:54] and we're in Jesus Christ by spiritual
[1:06:57] baptism not by water but by Spirit we
[1:07:00] are baptized into one body which is
[1:07:02] Christ he said the worshiping place then
[1:07:04] being in there we are being on this
[1:07:06] ground it's like the abstract deed he
[1:07:08] said you say I bought a piece of ground
[1:07:09] and he said is it it isn't yours until
[1:07:11] you got an abstract but if you've got an
[1:07:13] abstract it shows that everything that
[1:07:16] was ever against that piece of ground
[1:07:18] has been stricken off of it hey man
[1:07:21] everything that was against you Christ
[1:07:23] took and made a clean slate for you
[1:07:25] he said and then when you become a
[1:07:27] Christian accept Christ as your savior
[1:07:28] God sends down the abstract and it shows
[1:07:31] that no matter what your father did
[1:07:33] no matter what your mother did what
[1:07:35] anybody else did aren't you thankful for
[1:07:37] that
[1:07:38] he said your Daddy might have been
[1:07:40] drunkards your mother prostitutes
[1:07:43] whatever it was every sin is stricken
[1:07:47] off when you receive the spirit of
[1:07:48] Christ
[1:07:49] hey man you've got an abstract title
[1:07:51] there's nothing can you put it he said
[1:07:53] nothing can put you off of it and he
[1:07:56] said everything that's on that ground
[1:07:58] belongs to you he said when you're in
[1:08:00] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:02] every gift of God belongs in the church
[1:08:05] he said it amen it's an abstract title
[1:08:07] deed of course we've been going through
[1:08:09] those on Wednesday nights with our
[1:08:10] pastor we know they must be in order but
[1:08:12] every gift can be in this excuse me in
[1:08:14] this body he said in Oh my he said think
[1:08:17] of it he said if this it's an abstract
[1:08:20] title deed if it's in you it's yours he
[1:08:23] said it belongs to you it quickens your
[1:08:25] mortal bodies he said Oh my he said when
[1:08:27] you are saved God gives you your faith
[1:08:29] your faith overcomes the things of the
[1:08:31] world what is your faith your faith in
[1:08:33] that act that God has did in you to make
[1:08:35] you a son of God
[1:08:37] he said you quit your line you quit your
[1:08:39] stealing you quit your drinking because
[1:08:41] of your faith raises you up above it
[1:08:43] he said if you don't do it you don't
[1:08:45] have any faith and by faith you are
[1:08:46] saved and through Grace as much as your
[1:08:49] faith will be released that's how much
[1:08:51] power you can have
[1:08:53] he said because in you dwells the power
[1:08:57] to make heavens and earth
[1:09:00] think about that in you dwells the power
[1:09:03] to make heavens and earth he said
[1:09:07] God dwells in you and you are Sons and
[1:09:10] Daughters of God there you are but it's
[1:09:12] your faith Jesus said according to your
[1:09:14] faith be it unto you if thou can'tst
[1:09:17] believe all things are possible he said
[1:09:20] verily I say unto you if you say to this
[1:09:22] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[1:09:24] believe that what you have said then
[1:09:26] what kind of people are we to be he said
[1:09:28] he said having faith in this great
[1:09:30] redeeming Christ that lives in us the
[1:09:33] smitten rock that never leaves the
[1:09:34] church he said I Am With You Always even
[1:09:36] to the end of the world the ever
[1:09:38] presence of the great gesture of
[1:09:40] Salvation and power that poured forth
[1:09:42] from Calvary and into the church the
[1:09:45] ever presence of the Living God the
[1:09:48] great flowing smitten rock that goes
[1:09:51] with us in our journey
[1:09:53] hey man I love that right there
[1:09:55] The Authority that was in Christ
[1:09:59] The Authority that was in Christ
[1:10:02] was in
[1:10:04] God put in Christ and he could raise the
[1:10:07] Dead
[1:10:08] but he made a simple statement that the
[1:10:10] works that I do
[1:10:12] you can do also
[1:10:14] and it came in a prophet and he showed
[1:10:18] you
[1:10:18] that Jesus was alive
[1:10:20] you know I feel like it ought to be
[1:10:22] easier for a message person to believe
[1:10:23] that Christ is alive than anybody else
[1:10:26] because we could actually see
[1:10:30] a man that God used
[1:10:33] do the same works that Jesus did so he
[1:10:35] proved it he proved what he said
[1:10:37] he didn't just come out and say well I
[1:10:39] can go out here and cast out devils and
[1:10:41] I can heal the sick but he proved it and
[1:10:42] he did it he showed you
[1:10:44] with the Messiah sign to get the
[1:10:46] attention of the people and he goes on
[1:10:47] but then when the third poll came
[1:10:50] it wasn't just in the prophet at that
[1:10:53] point
[1:10:54] he said then it's whatever you speak
[1:10:57] oh I love that whatever you said
[1:11:00] that's when the I believe this is the
[1:11:02] hour for the third poll to be
[1:11:04] manifesting the bride because he said
[1:11:07] it's here some people are still waiting
[1:11:09] for but Church you don't realize how
[1:11:10] blessed you are to know that it is here
[1:11:13] among you now Christ is alive right here
[1:11:15] tonight and anything that you want
[1:11:18] anything you need in your life can
[1:11:20] happen right now the sick that are
[1:11:22] laying in the hospital can be raised up
[1:11:24] right now tonight at the very sound of
[1:11:26] your voice at the very thing whatever
[1:11:28] you say sick can be raised and the dead
[1:11:31] can come up cripples can stand up out of
[1:11:33] their wheelchairs because it's not just
[1:11:35] a god of history but it is a god of now
[1:11:37] he said it's an ever-present gusher from
[1:11:40] the water of The Rock and I believe it's
[1:11:42] right here among us tonight church I
[1:11:44] don't think it's time to go back into
[1:11:46] denomination and say well I I think it's
[1:11:49] I think the message could have been
[1:11:50] wrong here I'll tell you what get out of
[1:11:52] the seat of the critics tonight move out
[1:11:55] of the seat of the skeptical tonight and
[1:11:57] just remember that whatever God said God
[1:12:00] did and whatever God said he would do
[1:12:02] today he's still doing today do you
[1:12:04] believe it tonight I believe God is here
[1:12:06] among us tonight to do something for you
[1:12:08] you say your family's backslid and gone
[1:12:11] well just go ahead and speak it tonight
[1:12:12] tonight can be the night that you say
[1:12:14] they're coming back I've said that about
[1:12:16] every time I preach recently but I
[1:12:18] believe there's somebody here needs to
[1:12:19] hear it
[1:12:20] somebody needs to hear it when your
[1:12:22] family looks like they're gone don't
[1:12:24] give up on them
[1:12:25] when it looks like
[1:12:27] that the sickness is about to overtake
[1:12:28] you I think of sister Fritz tonight
[1:12:31] she's laying there in the hospital with
[1:12:32] congestive heart failure I tell you God
[1:12:34] is still God
[1:12:36] and it doesn't matter what the doctor
[1:12:38] said God can still raise up the sick
[1:12:40] today not only can he but he will if you
[1:12:44] speak it and go forward speak to that
[1:12:46] mountain of sickness tonight speak to
[1:12:48] your family and say you're coming back
[1:12:50] oh you say well well brother Joel you
[1:12:52] don't know the situation you don't know
[1:12:54] how bad it's gotten in the home you
[1:12:56] don't know how bad the marriage is or
[1:12:58] you don't know I don't care how bad it
[1:13:00] is God already knew what position you
[1:13:02] would be in and he said I will never
[1:13:04] leave you I will never forsake you but
[1:13:07] he said I will be with you listen church
[1:13:09] when you realize how comforting that is
[1:13:12] that he's never left you
[1:13:15] brother Brandon said he's as close as
[1:13:16] your right arm
[1:13:17] musicians come my time is up he's as
[1:13:20] close as your right arm
[1:13:22] he's always there
[1:13:24] he's ever present to make intercession
[1:13:26] for you
[1:13:28] all you have to do speak
[1:13:30] all you have to do speak it's so simple
[1:13:33] speak to your situation tonight
[1:13:36] I wonder if there's somebody in here
[1:13:37] that's got something going on there's
[1:13:39] just a few of you here
[1:13:41] but if there's something in your life
[1:13:42] that that is bothering you and it's
[1:13:44] worrying you maybe there's depression or
[1:13:45] maybe there's sickness or something in
[1:13:47] your body
[1:13:48] I wonder if you could stand
[1:13:50] and and just just to make a statement to
[1:13:52] the devil tonight
[1:13:54] that nothing's going to keep me down
[1:13:57] because I'm going to speak to my
[1:14:00] mountain tonight I'm going to speak to
[1:14:02] my situation tonight I'm going to speak
[1:14:05] to that storm because when Jesus stood
[1:14:07] up and spoke peace be still the winds
[1:14:10] and the waves obeyed him and you can
[1:14:12] speak with the same Authority tonight
[1:14:15] I wonder if you could bow your heads
[1:14:16] with me as we stand
[1:14:18] if there's one here tonight that needs
[1:14:20] prayer the altar is open
[1:14:22] but I believe
[1:14:23] if you could just put your hand to him
[1:14:25] tonight
[1:14:26] and say Lord
[1:14:28] I believe that whatever
[1:14:31] I have need of
[1:14:33] is right here for me to take control of
[1:14:35] tonight I can take a hold of it every
[1:14:37] promise is here every promise in the
[1:14:40] book is yours it was given to you
[1:14:43] not just to not just to read out of a
[1:14:45] book as as something of a god of History
[1:14:48] but it's a god of now it's a God that
[1:14:51] can still move in these services tonight
[1:14:55] think about him tonight think about what
[1:14:58] he did for you think about where you
[1:14:59] were where he brought you to
[1:15:01] oh he's a great big wonderful God
[1:15:07] Can You Reach Out And Touch him tonight
[1:15:09] say Lord
[1:15:11] I have a need in my life
[1:15:13] and I'm speaking tonight with full
[1:15:15] Authority and faith that whatever I
[1:15:19] speak is going to come to pass
[1:15:21] this is your time tonight to speak
[1:15:24] just speak to the storm speak to the
[1:15:26] sickness speak to whatever you have need
[1:15:28] of tonight whatever you say can happen
[1:15:31] right now
[1:15:33] Reach Out
[1:15:35] And Touch the Lord
[1:15:39] as he
[1:15:42] goes by
[1:15:44] oh Reach Out
[1:15:46] and touch the Lord Can You Reach Out And
[1:15:50] Touch him as he goes by
[1:15:55] oh you'll find he's not too busy
[1:16:01] to hear your heart's Cry he's passing by
[1:16:09] this moment
[1:16:11] your needs to supply
[1:16:16] just Reach Out
[1:16:19] and touch the Lord
[1:16:22] as he
[1:16:25] goals can you sing it with faith now
[1:16:28] Reach Out
[1:16:30] touch the Lord oh can you do it now as
[1:16:34] he
[1:16:36] goes by
[1:16:38] or you'll find
[1:16:41] he's not too busy
[1:16:44] to hear your heart's Cry of his past
[1:16:52] by this moment
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:58] to fly
[1:16:59] just Reach Out
[1:17:02] and touch the Lord
[1:17:06] as he
[1:17:08] goes by if they could play that softly
[1:17:11] for just a moment
[1:17:12] I wonder if we could
[1:17:15] just do something now as a church I
[1:17:17] wonder if you could put your hands over
[1:17:18] on someone
[1:17:19] husband wife brother sister
[1:17:22] got the order if he would just
[1:17:24] I wonder if we couldn't just intercede
[1:17:26] for one another
[1:17:27] tonight
[1:17:29] I wonder if you could just use your
[1:17:30] faith maybe there's someone that's got a
[1:17:32] little bit of a weakness in their faith
[1:17:35] maybe they just need something tonight
[1:17:37] maybe they just need an uplifting prayer
[1:17:40] of faith from one of God's children
[1:17:42] tonight
[1:17:43] and if you believe with all your hearts
[1:17:45] I believe this is the time when the
[1:17:47] sickness can be cast out from among you
[1:17:51] and I wonder if you would just pray in
[1:17:52] your own special way tonight this was on
[1:17:55] my heart when I come out
[1:17:56] to have us pray together and
[1:17:59] and I thought Lord
[1:18:01] if somebody could put your hands if you
[1:18:04] knew that somebody was putting their
[1:18:05] hands on you and that was just like
[1:18:08] Jesus himself laying hands on you how
[1:18:10] much Faith would it create in this
[1:18:12] church here tonight
[1:18:14] and it's just the same as if Christ
[1:18:17] himself was standing there with his
[1:18:18] hands on you
[1:18:20] because the spirit is in that person
[1:18:23] oh I wonder if we could reach out and
[1:18:24] tell him
[1:18:25] as we're praying for one another Lord
[1:18:29] I know you won't pass me by tonight
[1:18:31] Lord You're the same yesterday today and
[1:18:34] forever you've never failed me in my
[1:18:36] life I failed you Lord but you never
[1:18:40] left me alone

[1:18:45] pray you just come upon these people
[1:18:46] tonight Lord if there's a sickness in
[1:18:47] their body Lord if there's a disease
[1:18:49] that's trying to take them over Lord oh
[1:18:51] God any Spirit of sickness or doubt or
[1:18:54] fear anything that would try to make
[1:18:55] them doubt the word of God lord may it
