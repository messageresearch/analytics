look forward to what the lord has to speak to us tonight if you would just quickly we'll just turn to john chapter 14. amen and begin reading there in verse 6. i mean we'll read the scripture and then we'll have a word of prayer before we're seated and jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so if you would and maybe if you have an unspoken request if you just make it known by the flips in your hand this evening amen let's just bow our heads let me just come before you tonight lord just just thankful that you allow us just to

anything injected into the word lord that would just be your spirit and your anointing this evening or that just the the hearts of the people would be touched and blessed that we could just strengthen ourselves and our lord that your word could strengthen us along the journey in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you love the lord this evening and you can have you can have your seats this evening and just kind of want to just take a a few minutes just to just to preach uh if i could if i had a title i'd just title it he always makes a way amen you believe that i mean i don't know how many times i've come up to a situation or a thing in my life for a trial and didn't didn't see a way around it over to under it but god made a way amen and i just like to just talk to you about the way this evening if i could just for a little bit and it looks like reading isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel now brother branham and the unconditional covenant that god made with his people in 1954 he says in the garden of eden as soon as the man realized that he had sinned instead of him running up and down the street of paradise saying father father where are you he was hiding and it was god running up and down the way hollering adam adam weareth thou see the nature of man instead of coming out and confessing in the open and being sincere about it and saying god i've sinned forgive me he'll run and hide behind something and the one thing adam did which is a great strain on man he made himself a homemade religion he says now we know the word religion means a covering and adam instead of saying god cover me he made himself some aprons out of fig leaves and he and eve and they worked all right along as god wasn't around but when they came in the presence of god they realized that their fig leaf religion wouldn't work he said and brother there's he said there's so much of that today that i'm afraid to tell you you're going to find the same thing when god comes again that that homemade fig leaf religion will not stand in the presence of god he says god had to make a covering for them you believe that this evening so we see that whenever we try to cover up or we try to do anything by our own ideas or our own works or our own practices it cannot it's not good enough for the presence of the lord is that right there's only one way and that's through the shed blood of jesus christ that anyone can get to the father amen now matthew 2 and verse 6 and i'll read some scriptures just as we go down through here just interjecting little pieces as we go down through here just pointing to christ as the types and shadows and and in matthew 2 and 6 and now in bethlehem in the land of judea are thou not at least among the princes of judah and for out of thee shall come a governor and shall rule my people of israel and so we see here in psalms 37 and 23 the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not utterly be cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now i'm old and yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he said he is merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever do you believe that now i'm just going to read through this if we could fellowship by redemption and kind of go through a few quotes here in a few different scriptures and and just look at this as the lord would lead us just that god is always going to make a way and we know that that way is jesus christ is that right now friends he said it's the only road back he said i've seen many of them that could dance in the spirit they could speak in tongues it could run all over the building and everything else and still no fellowship just as miserable as they could be because they had built the wrong foundation that's right he says we've got to get the right thing and the first thing he said that's the only foundation for fellowship he said there's only one time and one ground that god ever spread the welcome back or the welcome mat back to adam's fallen race he said only one and that was in the garden of eden when he spread it back by the way of the shed blood and he said i believe in the blood he says not talk about it but i mean worship in it amen do you believe that tonight it's not a blood that we can just point to and say well this is it or this is that but we've got to worship in that blood we've got to come as believers and say and when we're forgiven of our sins we can't let satan constantly be bringing that back up and bringing it back up we've got to walk as sons and daughters of god into righteousness is that right it's not our righteousness but it's his righteousness that makes us clean now he said he didn't say when i return will i find dress codes or polished up message people he said will i find faith now we know that when we find that faith it will lead to the good things is that right when we find the spirit of god it's like brother it's like the minister said one time you don't clean the fish until you catch it you want to get people to christ and let christ clean them up is that right now faith is a revelation a revelation of what it's the revelation of the will of god in your life and and we see that the will of god the will of god is that none should perish but that all should have eternal life so we see that god come and made a way when adam and eve when they that the fall took place in the garden of eden god instantly come and wanted to make a way it was the shadow of christ forecoming with the shed blood of the lamb is that right numbers 24 and 17 he says i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a start of jacob and a scepter and shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and shall destroy the children of seth or seth and jeremiah 23 and 5 behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth and in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name where by he shall be called the lord our righteousness now brother branham says in 1965 in god's chosen place of worship he says now notice not one word of the shadows fell he says not one word ever failed not one shadow he said everything typed perfectly he said he's god's chosen place of worship and and god's name is given to him he is god's place of worship so that means you can't worship any side anywhere else outside of christ is that right and god's name is given to him he was the word of god he's the name of god he's both the word of god and the name of god he's the word made flesh he was the word of god the lamb of god the name of god and was god and he said that's what he was and the chosen only place of worship to god amen so if we see anybody worshiping anywhere else other than jesus christ it's wrong is that right the bible teaches us that there's one way back to the father and that's through jesus christ he said and god refuses any other place besides in jesus christ you cannot worship him anywhere he said in vain they do worship me teaching the doctrine doctrines and commandments of men today we have creeds and dogmas and everything that teaches this is the way and that is the way and jesus came and said i am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to god but by me in other words i'm the door to the sheepfold all without are thieves he is the only approach he's the door he's the way the truth and the life all there is the only interest the only place the only worship the only name so we see we look through scripture brother brahm says everything is tied to jesus christ he says all the old testament is tied to him when the new testament is tied to him and the church today is tied to him by the word of his commandment there's not another place or another name or anywhere where god ever promised to meet man only in jesus christ his chosen place of worship do you believe that tonight amen we can't find it in our pastor we can't find it in the singers or the musicians we got to go back to jesus christ and i love how brother branham he says they were complaining that he was preaching on jesus too much and that's what i believe the prophet said hey if there's anything i can preach on i want to preach on him is that right so if there's anything as christians we ought to be excited to talk about it ought to be jesus christ that's the focus that's the theme that's the everything that's been the theme of the message is to get us back to christ is that right the prophet had a restoring ministry restoring us back to what to christ is that right he wasn't restoring us back to signs and wonders or a prophet or a pastor or this group or this organization he was pouring us back to jesus christ because he knew that that was the only way that we could as a bride as the spotless bride of jesus christ that was the only way we could make it through laodicea was with jesus christ is that right amen do you love the lord this evening amen i will not hold you very long and i know a bunch of you have worked today and i know we come to worship in the spirit of the lord so just everybody don't be nervous and be fine we'll be all right and we'll we'll have you home or having mcdonald's as soon as you can but i believe we come we focus we focus on the word of god we ought to give him our attention amen amen so just and that's the hardest thing for me even as even when i'm ministering to not think about the things of the day and not think about the things that are going on and and going on in the world and and so you know i think we just sometimes if we can come in and we can just set those things aside just for a few moments amen and focus on him god will speak to us amen amen it's not you know it's it's it's not god that doesn't show up sometimes it's us that doesn't show up amen romans 15 10 and again he saith rejoice she gentiles with his people and again praise you the lord all you gentiles and lord him and ye all you people and again isaiah say there shall be a root of jesse and he shall rise and reign over the gentiles in him the gentiles trust now the god of all hope fill you with joy and peace and believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost so he's speaking of christ there in luke 1 30 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou house found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever in his kingdom there shall be no end now we see here brother branham's going to go down and i'm just going to kind of go down through this quote here just for a few moments adding some scriptures in as we go through it and just kind of look at jesus and how how everything was was typed for him coming in the old testament you know with the pillar of fire it was god above us then god jesus came down and god was made flesh and it was god with us amen and then the holy spirit come down and it was god in us is that right and so we see you know many times we'd like to go back and and and be with god with us we'd like to see jesus we'd like to see the flesh and like to see those things but the most powerful that it that the believers ever had was not god with jesus but it was jesus in the believer is that right so we live in the best day that we can live in we we we have the most power that we've ever been given it's not that we have more power than christ and that's not what the scripture teaches but we have that same power and a greater quality is that right now isaiah 40 and verse 3 it says excuse me all those men were great men and they died in the line but finally one day in bethlehem of judea the royal seed was born he said which all the rest of them were just shadows but the royal seed was born not of a man but he was born by a virgin with the power in his veins to conquer death and hell and god had made a promise now isaiah 40 and verse 3 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert the highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and a hill shall be made load in the crooked shall be made straight in the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it now brother man says an ordinary man could not do it he said but if god makes a promise he's just the same god that he was a few minutes before with abraham jehovah jireh the lord shall provide the way to take the gate do you believe that now we see that it was it wasn't just an ordinary man and there's certain things that that you can do as an individual that i can't do and there's certain things i can do as an individual that you can't do and and as the body of christ we've got to pull those strengths together amen there's prayer warriors there's singers there's there's those that can preach there's those that can pastor there's those that can lead there's deacons and trustees and those together we can't maybe all be one thing or maybe even what we want to be but god's whatever god has called us to be we have to be that is that right amen you know if i was to go and ask matthew to come in and do my job for me tomorrow he's my little boy is eight years old he probably couldn't do that or some things paxton he's three there's things i can't ask him to do that matinee can do i can't save paxton go out and feed the dogs matany that's his chore every morning he goes out and feeds the dogs and and it wouldn't be fair for me to ask paxton to do the same thing because he can't open the lid to the can he can't reach in he can't get the food out and the dogs would just be attacking him the whole time and there are certain things that that that god has called us to be that wouldn't be fair to ask me to do something that he would ask you to do and and so we see that whenever whenever we were looking down through time all these great men you know you look at you look at moses you look at joshua you look at caleb but they were not qualified to do what christ was qualified to do is that right you even look at the prophet brother branham he was not qualified to do what christ was qualified to do is that right so it's not that we can put what jesus christ was on a man but we've got to understand that jesus christ he was the boy he was the son the virgin born son of god is that right he was god made flesh everything the fullness of the god had bodily all dwelled within this man jesus christ is that right he says how are we going to do it he says joshua died moses died the rest of them died but god said he shall possess the gates of his enemy he said how is he going to possess death and so that was the question you know all down through time you look and men had conquered lions men had conquered moses had come up and the red sea had parted they the the the the all the the children of israel crossed across and and you see that they come to jericho and the walls fell and then you see later on down through all these things job all these things that happened but every one of them had died is that right so who was going to possess the gates of death and proverbs 30 and verse 4 he says who that sended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fist who hath bounded in the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his son's name if thou can tell he said every word of god is pure and he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him add not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar he said he's got a way of doing things and this is back to the quote brother branham is speaking here he says he's got a way of doing things he shall possess the gates of his enemy the royal seed was born he was tempted in every manner like we are just as you have to be tempted he said so was he he said the devil quickly taken him when he received the holy spirit into the wilderness 40 days and nights to be tempted and when he come out at his death they drove nails in his hands and spit in his face and went through every sickness but when he was here on earth he proved that he could conquer sickness he said when peter's wife's mother laid of the palsy he touched her hand and the fever left her when the leper cried at the gate unclean unclean he says if you will you can make me whole and he said i will be thou whole he conquered and took the gate of leprosy he took the gate of fevers he made nature obey him so we see that as jesus christ come we realize this was a different amen we realized that he was different than all the other men before him he had a power there was something different about jesus christ you look back in history and and you know many times you look at theologians and they talk about some people don't believe in jesus christ that he was god made flesh but they believed historically that he was a figure you know they believe all the miracles and all these things were done but they can't explain them so they just say it was a historical fact and they look at that that way but as you as believers as you and i we believe that he was the son of god is that right and that when he died on the cross our sins were paid for is that right that ours by his stripes we are healed so that when we ask for healing we can point back to the cross just as israel could point back to the brazen serpent in the desert as that ride and claim their healing is that right why that was representing sin already judged do you believe that amen if i get back on the atonement i'll never get back on anything else but we believe that that was done for you and i so that when my children are sick i can look back to that and say by his stripes they are healed is that right when i say that i'm going through a trial or see that my family's going through a situation i can point back to that and say as he overcomes so shall i overcome is that right isaiah 29-18 as in that day shall the death hear and the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness isaiah 29 and 19 the meek shall also increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel you see he was the seed of abraham the royal sea he was the one promised was given to through him abraham and all the seed that followed him up to be royal seed and all the seed after him god's promise is true how many believe god's promise is true tonight and so that's the thing we can believe that god's promise is true we can believe that the the the promises that were ordained or the promises that were written in the scripture the promises that were spoken of by the prophet to the bride we can believe they were true but we have to act on them is that right amen he said we have a checkbook we just have to make out the chick is that right he said and we see that that god's promise is true he conquered sickness and he conquered temptation when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw he turned to the other side when they jerked the beard from his face and spit on him he never riled back he conquered the gate of temptation and took it he said then you say my temper won't let me do it he says you seed of abraham yes sir he conquered it for you when he was riled upon he riled not back is that right amen we can't have somebody not put on their blinker in front of us and not get mad is that right not a lot of amens on that one but sometimes we've got to look at this and say hey is my attitude is my is my spirit where it should be is it line up with christ is that right so we look many times in the scripture and we look at the the things that christ had done and he was to be our primary example for how we should live our lives is that right i believe they were first called christians at antioch because their life was based on jesus christ is that right genesis 17 and 19 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him now remember the the the the the sermon that brother barron preached the unconditional covenant we look at the the covenant that he had with abraham and just to kind of just identify that and speak on that just for a few moments he made the unconditional covenant with abraham and what that was was he didn't base it on abraham's works or abraham's abilities he said it was an unconditional covenant because he said i'm going to swear by myself that this will happen it's like if he come and made a covenant with me he says alan i'm not going to put any of this on you it's like if i went and got a loan and he says alan i'm going to pay this back for you it's none of it's going to be based on you or on your works or your deeds or on your on your on your stature anything that he said he based that unconditional covenant on the word of god is that right it was nothing abraham could do to mess it up there was nothing that anybody could do to mess it up god had spoke his word and when he spoke it it was not going to return unto him void is that right now he says here he says when he was made fun of he held his peace when he was called a devil he held his peace he had one business and that was the father's business he went about doing that and finally they took him to a cross and death had to face him he said all the rest of them had conquered the seas they had conquered nature they had conquered lines they'd conquered fire they had conquered everything but death and but here was the one beating in his veins and that had the conquering power of death so they took his hands and stretched him out and nailed him to a cross they beat him and stripped him till his bones stared at him but when he did they had done all they could do and death struck him and said now i'll take you and satan said now i'll take you like i did joshua i'll take you like i did daniel and i'll do all this because i'll make you die now we know that this as we go down through this quote i know many of you have read it many times but but just if you just bear with me just for a few moments and and we see that this this this was a little bit different than all the other prophets all the other all the other people before him this was a little bit different jesus was coming down to a point and we know that that he had to die as a man in the garden of gethsemane we know the spirit of god left him and we see he had to come and he had to die as a man and and and we see that those that all of our sins and and you know i had a lady ask me one time and i've spoke about this before but you know they used to offer up the blood of goats and and sheep is that right as a sacrifice and it was a covering of sin and and and we see that that as that was a covering of sin if i were to take a sheet and cover up this pulpit and this was to typify my sin that pulpit would still be there is that right and the sheet was a covering the blood of the bulls and goats was a covering but this blood it was different it took the sin away as brother branham preaches or talks about in the sermon it was like the son of god had crossed a chasm and whenever that son of god had repented of his sins and had been washed in the blood of jesus christ the blood of jesus christ bridged that chasm and the son of god walked back on the side with christ and the sin that he had committed was laid back upon the accuser is that right so we see that everything that we had done everything that satan had caused us to do is as brother branham talks about selling us out in the pawnshop everything that we had done wrong all of our sin is laid back upon satan and he will stand and be judged for that is that right and we will be judged by the righteousness of jesus christ so isaiah 53 and 1 it says who hath believed i report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender planet as a root out of the dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed do you believe that it says i in verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath lay down him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as the lamb to the slaughter and a sheep before her shearers is dumb he opened not his mouth are you thankful for that tonight he was taken from prison from judgment and where who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for his transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him and hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and it shall pleasure the lord and shall prosper in his hand are you thankful for that and now what was amazing to me as many times you look at the scripture and you see things that are going on in today's times and and i'm not typifying anything or spiritualizing anything but you look at what's going on with israel right now and i may not be saying it correctly but hamas i believe is is how you pronounce it in the hamas is that right i don't watch the news or listen so i read it and i'm not very intelligent in that so hamas okay there we go so you look at the people that are standing up for this hamas that are against israel and and it's you know you see the the homosexual side standing up for hamas and which in their religion they actually kill homosexuals right you see you see all these things and it's so stupid it's just like they bring in barabbas and jesus and they're choosing barabbas and we see that again in this day that they're choosing barabbas again openly and just to us as believers we look at and we say this is nonsense this is just ridiculous at what they would be doing but when you look back at you look at barabbas a murderer thief the worst criminal that they had compared to jesus and the great things that he done that they chose and cried out for barabbas and we see it again in this day and we just we just say again come quo come quickly lord jesus amen amen do you love the lord this evening amen didn't mean to get off topic there for a few moments but just something that just just come to me thought we'd share and brother branham goes on he says and he died until the sun got ashamed of itself he died until nature got ashamed and it failed to operate he said the sun went down in the middle of the day and the stars wouldn't come out he died until the elements was so black you couldn't see your hand before you in the middle of the day he says imagine nature said let me die with him he said brother then the devil he sent his precious soul to the bottomless pits of hell and there the gates open he said but he come out on the third day conquered it he said amen his seed shall possess the gates of the enemy he said he conquered death he conquered hell and on that easter first easter morning he conquered the grave and he says and now we stand more than conquerors through him who loved us amen do you believe that this morning or this evening so we see that we become more than conquerors through him who loved us so we see that jesus went to the grave he conquered death hell in the grave and as you and i will conquer that in the rapture is that right and death and hell will be defeated so john wanted or it was defeated then is that right john 1 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men now we see that through jesus christ there's no other person that did in the scripture in history that did what jesus did is that right you look at muhammad and he's still at his grave is that right there were no guards that muhammad's grave to keep him from coming back alive and and i love you know i heard one time a minister speaking you know that when they when they when they buried jesus you know they talked about the disciples coming back and stealing them and you know they were they were they were spreading this but but how powerful of a man he had to be that they would actually guard his grave that he was so powerful they would actually believe that he if anybody could raise from the dead it could be this one is that right so we see that that's how what power he had that people could see in his life you know if you were to look at you were looking to go in a cemetery today you don't see anybody guard in a grave that somebody could come back is that right because they don't hold that power but when one come with that power they knew that it was real is that right now as believers in this day as sons and daughters of god we ought to believe and know that god has given us the strength through his holy spirit amen what christ had in fullness we have in measure is that right where christ had the ability to do certain things you and i now have that in measure do you believe that so that means that anything that christ anything that was that was a promise to the bride of jesus christ is the is is able for us to do is that right i believe brother branham says we may not have the power to do it but we have the authority is that right to call on that power as sons and daughters of god we have the authority to use the word of god to defeat the devil at any time do you believe that now we see that as sons and daughters of god not only do we have this this authority but we have a great responsibility with it to represent christ in this day you know if anybody's going to see christ in this day it's going to be looking at you and i is that right that is we are to be witnesses of the father in this day now we look many times and and and i'm going to be closing just here in just a few minutes i know it wasn't very long but it's just a little thought that was given to us and just pray that it would be blessing you in some way now and we look at moses when he come to the red sea he says now in our pilgrim journey we notice that out in the wilderness why they began to sin after god had blessed them and brought them through the red sea said isn't it strange though that the children of israel on their journey god led them and the first thing right into the death trap he said right up to the red sea and pharaoh's army coming and pursuing he says there's mountains on one side and the sea had them cut off but god's camp went through the sea he said many times god's let us god lets us get dried up like that then he looked down through the pillar of fire and the sea rolled back and they went across he said god made a way of escape he always will in every instant are you thankful for that he said notice they went straight right ahead through the wilderness and into the wilderness to sin he said isn't that strange from one trial to another he said some through the water some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood are you thankful for the blood of jesus christ today that that every sin that we have that we have been caused to commit or that was committed that he would wash it completely away that it would no longer be attached to you and i is that right i believe i've heard it said before it's not that he turns us a new chapter but he gets us a completely new book is that right that everything that was contributed to you or attributed to you is now laid back on the accuser do you believe that amen many times we look at it and we say there's no way that i can do it but it's through christ that we can do all things amen do you love the lord this evening amen isaiah 35 8 and a highway shall be there and and away and it shall be called the way of holiness and the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not enter therein he always makes a way now we look here and we see that when when jesus came and he made a way for us to get back to the father is that right it wasn't to get back to a religion or a belief but it was to get back to god is that right and that should be the main focus of every believer it's not to do this or not to do that but it's to get back to him as the bride of jesus christ that's what we ought to be focused on is getting back to him now you look in in today's time and and i begin to look at religion and and where it's going and the things that they agree with and what i would call modern day religion and and even in message churches not only in in denominational churches but in message churches and in in maybe even our own lives maybe outside of church and we look and we say what is the goal here you know what what is the goal why would you be a partaker of this religion if you're not going to follow through with jesus christ if you believe in the bible why would you want to take this part out and this part out and just say well this is for us and this is for us but you want the full benefits of god you want you've got to take the full word of god is that right i believe it was henry ford that said and i'm just going to throw this in there he says whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right and so i'm not one of those and you you hear a lot of ministers say that this is not just a positive thinking right they say this is not just positive preaching or or that and i'm not saying that that's wrong or anything but we should as christians we should have a positive outlook we've been given the fullness of the word we've been given the fullness of the godhead bodily jesus christ we've been given the holy ghost so everything that he was in the fullness we are now in measure so we should have a positive outlook on life that whenever sickness comes we can pray and ask the father anything in his name and he will give it to us is that right that if sickness or trials or anything comes we can go to the father we can go to the throne and we can ask anything in his name and he would give it to us but we've got to have faith to believe that he will do it do you believe that amen so we see here um and brother brahem says in awakening jesus he says well here is where he challenged the proof he says he that believeth on me the things that i do he says in other words you will be an amateur messiah messiah he said that's exactly right he says for his life if it be in you it ain't you it's him he said see you ordained to carry his work on do you believe that i i like that he says you're ordained to carry his work on and that means you were chosen you were you were for ordained predestinated to carry on the work of jesus christ amen we're not here to point people to a prophet we're not here to point people to a church or point people to a pastor we're here to point people to jesus christ you believe that amen i'll close just with this just in a few minutes and i put this quote in from charles spurgeon just because i liked it so much he said if if salvation had been by works our lord could have not said to the man the thief dying at his side today thou shalt be with me in paradise he said that man could do no works his hands and feet were fastened to the cross he was in all agonies of death he said no it must be by grace all conquering grace amen do you love the lord this evening so we can't say well this one does this or this one does that we are all on an equal playing field of grace it's that unmerited unfavoring grace or unwavering grace that jesus would come and do this for us hebrews 9 8 the holy ghost this signify that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience he said which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse washing and cardinal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but christ being come as a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us he said for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer and sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered him without spot to god to purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god are you thankful for that i believe the scripture said he entered in once because that's all we needed was one time and that was abolished sin that abolished death that conquered hell death the grave everything he conquered it at calvary do you believe that amen do you love the lord this evening and we'll go ahead and have the musicians come if they would and i know it's been short but i pray something was said that would just bless your heart tonight and and i would want to read just another quote here in the paradox if i could and now he says here stands a group of people to be prayed for he says now we realize if the scripture is true and the god of heaven who could create a squirrel could create a ram and could stop the sun for a whole day for 24 hours they could keep fire from burning people in a furnace for three hours he could stop the mouth of lions he could raise the dead could walk on water could take biscuits and feed five thousand he said that though that's the word made flesh in human beings he says now does everybody understand that he said now the same god that promised that in the last days these things would reoccur again he said but he cannot do it until there's somebody he can work them with and work on he said you see what i mean he says now let's believe that emphatically with all our hearts that it's going to be this way and so god or what brother braden is saying here is that that jesus has done these things and he's needing human beings in this day to do those same things again is that right and so we see that as believers as sons and daughters of god if we are to be christ-like we have to first have faith in his word is that right we have to believe that everything that god spoke everything that christ spoke in his word we have the authority as believers to use that in this day do you believe that and i'll finish with this just as you played something softly before we pray said joshua stopped the sun the s-u-n by faith he said but blind bartimaeus stopped the s-o-n by faith and that same faith will bring him from glory where he controls the solar system in the universe it will bring him down to this tabernacle tonight that same childlike faith so we see that i don't want to focus on the needs or what your situation is or what your what your trial is or or what your sickness is but if you have that same childlike faith it can bring him down tonight we don't look at the trial or the circumstance of the situation because if we have christ that doesn't matter right he can conquer it he's already conquered it at calvary but we've got to be able to come and be able to get in his presence so much that we can let him overshadow our life and control our life that our situations and our and and our goals and our family would be led completely by him do you believe that amen we certainly want to move ourselves aside so that that the lord could come and be in control of our life and that he could completely lead us amen amen maybe if you have a need tonight as we just bow our heads maybe just put it before the lord this evening amen just ask him just to come and meet your need and maybe you have a family situation or a sickness or or something special just something dear to your heart that you just like to ask the lord and [Music] as we pray just just believe that what you ask in his name that he will give to you [Music] dear lord we just come before

more than enough for me let's sing that song if we could while we worship the lord god will make a way amen just for a few moments as we worship him god will make when there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my guide hold me closely to his side with love and strength for each new day he will make a way [Music] he will make a way once again with all our hearts god will make a way when there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my guide hold me closely to his side with love and strength
