the church here and the work that he's doing for the lord here in this community and the stand that you all have taken for the message we say god bless you all for that i sure appreciate brother ben and his stand on this word we want to say we appreciate it for giving this opportunity for believers to get together amen in an unrestricted atmosphere not here to promote doctrines or men's ideas or personalities but just here to lift up the name that is above everything amen to see lives changed by the power of the holy ghost we we sure appreciate that this scene that i want to greet you for our pastor brother sean the saints are at home this evening and if you have your bibles while you're standing we're going to turn to the book of genesis the first chapter the book of genesis the first chapter i want to say it is an honor to be here ministering with brother wendell martin a dear friend of mine and a great influence over my life and ministry and we sure appreciate him for being here and we're sure glad to have brother joshua another dear friend of mine and we're just very thankful that he showed up this year amen amen for those of you that were here last year we supposed to be here together but he stayed home i'm partly to blame for that i told him it'd probably be best if he did they was expecting little ethan and so but he's here with us tonight so we're sure glad to have him and his wife with us and uh i my wife's at home expecting a little malachite one where they'll be gonna get through this meeting but we we sure thank the lord bring your readings from her tonight uh let's just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer and maybe you could just turn and lay your hand on someone standing next to you tonight as we come together in a spirit of unity opening these meetings tonight let's just join together and let's invite the lord to come heavenly father lord as we gather here tonight on the first night of these meetings lord as i stepped into the sanctuary lord my mind couldn't help but go back to when your prophet talked about that day that you come riding into town and he said the air was charged with expectation for lord the believers were there under expectation of god fulfilling the promise of his word and lord as i stepped into this building tonight i feel that same charge of expectation in the hearts of your believers tonight god lord we've not gathered here to see a man or to hear a man's idea or to feed from a personality the lord we've gathered here tonight because there is a deep calling to the deep and lord there is a need to respond to that call and father as the believers have given here and they have their hands laid upon one another lord we know with unity that we can take the land we can pursue the enemy but father where there is division the house cannot stand but it will fall but lord we're so thankful tonight that we're not divided but we're united under the message of the hour lord we've got a direction and it's not to the left or to the right to the back but it's to the four lord or to possess our inheritance to possess our promises now god i pray tonight as we join our faith together lord may you drive out every spirit in this building that's unlike the holy spirit lord may your anointing open up and rain down in this meeting father or from the first night to the final service dear god or may there not be one service that we would invite you to come to that we would not make you welcome but may we make you welcome may you be the honored guest among us lord father for every church that's represented here i pray that you would bless them lord for every pastor that's represented here our brother matt tonight god may you bless him and his assembly lord the different churches it's your father from brother jason's in different areas oh god i pray that you would bless them lord father may we be refreshed in your presence lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen amen the book of genesis the first chapter and i want to look in the very first verse of genesis 1. the bible says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep i love this next line and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters brotherhood says waters is a type of people so we can actually say in the spirit of god moved upon the people the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters i also want to look at one other place the book of matthew the 18th chapter i know you here tonight as bible believers could repeat this verse from heart but i just want to pull it here matthew 18 and verse number 20 matthew 18 and verse number 20 i was actually reading in the back and realized that this verse is actually speaking to worshipers so how many worshipers do we have here today he said here in the 20th verse for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i that's the i am there am i in the midst of them we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you i can be seated here this afternoon from those passages of scripture for just a few moments if i may if i take a title tonight i want to speak to you on welcoming a move of god welcoming a move of god i i believe tonight that we have come here on the first night of these meetings and meant to welcome the spirit of god into the midst of his church and you know a few days ago in prayer something just come to my heart that i've been thinking upon and it just struck my heart in prayer that what we think we need is one thing amen but what god knows we need is another what we think we need is one thing but what god knows we need is another now amen you may be here tonight thinking that you need this or thinking that you need that or thinking you need something else amen but thank god tonight that we know under the spirit of god that he is the god that knows everything about us and he knows what we need and i'll say it to you like this amen what we need is a move of god that comes from god and his word amen i find it like this the prophet of god will say in the message about 47 times he will use the term move of god and you'll find that it takes a power to start a move of god now we realize this amen that man cannot supply that power amen but god must supply the power in order to start a move of god in the message of blessed prophet he said a man cannot lay in the presence of god and a church cannot stay in the presence of god under repentance he said unless the holy spirit comes down and gives unction and power to start a move of god in there among those people amen i want to read that to you again a man cannot lay in the presence of god and a church cannot stay in the presence of god under repentance unless the holy spirit comes down and gives unction and power to start a move of god in there among those people now amen you all know as well as i know that many people actually fear a move of god and the reason that they fear a move of god is because many moves of god have been turned into fanaticism they've been turned into personalities they've been turned into man's agendas amen but just starting off this meeting let me remove all doubt and say and then god still moves regardless of what anybody else has done with the move of god amen god still moves i happen to believe amen that god still moves and sing and i happen to believe that god amen still moves in the preaching of his word i believe admit that god still moves in prayer lines i believe that god amen still moves in testimony services i happen to believe amen that god still moves and we might as well tell that devil tonight ain't that he can throw up every hindrance he wants to they've been but the spirit of god is greater at the church and then it's ever been before amen because we're not here upon a man's idea we're not here upon a man's agenda amen but we have come here under a spiritual leadership of the almighty god where he said if two or three would gather in my name amen i will come down and be in their list he said that i've got god on record tonight saying he meant that he's going to heal somebody here this weekend he's going to deliver somebody here this weekend he's going to give somebody the holy ghost amen i don't think we gotta back up to this devil i think it's time to break out of church hannity i think it's time to break out of cults and ideas and come back under the power of god and let the spirit of god free in the church ain't meant to move once again amen i'll tell you what if you'll repent of that thing that's between you and god right now in a few minutes it'll be in the sea of forgetfulness and you'll be full of the dynamics of god i'm going to church we're not in position to fail tonight we're in position for revival we're in position for a miracle we're in position to see the supernatural because god still moves amen i still believe god losing altar calls ain't been the problem god said their old fashion ain't meant they're out of style today amen but god still moves in amen whatever the devil says is out of style is what god still moves in whatever the devil says is an idea of the past is a reality of today and my god is not dead he's a living god here tonight he's not looking for your education he's looking for your soul he's not looking for your ability he's looking for somebody that'll surrender to it and let him come in the church and the power of his dynamics can you feel it amen the problem god said can you feel it he said can you feel it moving on you he said do you see what it is it's the holy ghost amen what you're feeling right now is not the words of a man it's the holy ghost of god amen and the holy ghost here is here to move the father said who are you this morning he said who is christ jesus he is in you as much as you'll let him be he said he's present he's been trying to get into you he meant to move into you today and you stand off and you wonder and you look and you gaze and you hold back a little bit he said don't do that ain't been moved right straight into the kingdom of god the hour is here see oh i want to see him don't you how many wants to see him here this weekend he said i want to see him and i believe we will see him amen because he is here now well i might as well go ahead and say what a prophet said he said my ministry is to declare him that he is here and that he is coming in a corporal body but he is here in the form of his word he is here to heal us he is here to bless us he is here to pray you may think i lost my mind but there's a charge in here that is coming from the word and there ain't no devil got enough power tonight ain't meant to stop my god from coming into the vessel of an empty soul he will fill you with his spirit he will charge you with his dynamics he said if you believe you will see him amen then you will see him because he's here now he said his power is moving he said what makes him people cry and shout and go on what's the matter it's the holy ghost they've been moving in them and you all know that there's three realms to god there's god above us there's god with us and then there's god in us do you realize what a prophet said he said we're not just moving because god is above us we're not just moving because god is holding us amen but we're moving because god is in us amen don't you see what this is this is the fulfillment of prophetic word that the move is home for the bride that's let's say the lord the move is not coming from the outside it's coming from the inside it's the holy ghost and fire and it's set up in our bones tonight and it's here to manifest itself the holy ghost is not just moving on you it's not just moving around you he said the holy ghost is moving in you if you can only realize and embrace him embrace the holy ghost and believe in him and hug him into your bosom and live right don't do nothing that would hinder him say lord jesus i want you i want you to stand by me here i'm going to stand by you he's pressing to get into you he wants in there actually what's inside of you how many will agree that the holy ghost won't send you tonight he said see what he's doing he is wooing to you he is wooing you to him all the time now how many can admit at times that you've been in services and you felt pressure you felt pressure on your soul you felt pressure around you and i say that every time you feel pressure it's not always in the negative because the prophet of god shows us amen he is more willing to do it than you are to receive it he said can you imagine brother bosworth expressing to this ocean out here piled up in one tube about two foot high or two foot across he said what a pressure there would be he meant trying to find one little crevice he meant to leak through he said now divide that by ten thousand times and you'll find the pressure of the holy spirit is trying to find that little crevice in the heart and then the true faith can leak into there and can heal you and then do you realize if you were a son or daughter of god you got a heart inside of you and inside of that heart is a crevice and that crevice was not put there to be full with the nomination it was not put there to be pulled away out of see you ain't been but that crevice was put in your heart that in the evening time when the spirit would be poured out according to joel the second chapter there would be a heart on earth to receive what he was pouring out come on friends if he pours his spirit in you it'll heal your body if he pours your spirit in you it'll save your soul if he pours his spirit in you it'll free your mind how many can say oh god let your spirit find the crevice in my heart on the first night of these meetings and let the faith of god leak into my heart and manifest the promise of his word he said see god's standing there like a great pressure don't be afraid of that he said because too many are he said you cannot exhaust god he wants to bless you look at somebody next to him say god wants to bless you you didn't know you just got me preached tonight amen brother danny god wants to bless you brother man god wants to bless you word of life god wants to bless you turn to the living god god didn't bring you together amen to condemn you and to beat you up amen that he called you together he meant to bless you with his shekinah glory he called you together to bless you with his anointing and to bless you with his power and to bless you with his love he wants to bless you he's ready he's pressing could you imagine taking all the water that's in the earth and the sea and piling it into one four-foot path and put it up there he said the pressure would be on the bottom of it he'd been trying to find a little crevice to leak its way through he said that's like the pressure of the holy spirit trying to come down on every life that what is moving you is the holy ghost see god is watching over his word to vindicate it because he has got to make it real he's got to make it act he said that's why you people are hungry for a revival just go ahead and help me preach for a second where is that hunger coming from tonight it's not coming because andrew plumber's here or any other preachers here it's because there's a spirit they've been there's pressing it's your soul there's a spirit that's moving at you and then there's a god who has come down to fill you with more than ideas and doctrines and creeds and dogmas he has come down to fill you with the very life of his own self he said see he come down to bless you amen he wants to bless you it's time for these things to be here if you ever believe me to know what i was talking about you accept that the hour is here now we'll preacher someday some hour but a vindicated prophet is filling the church the hour for god to bless the church whether being is not in the future it is right here present tonight yes sir the trouble of it is he said we got so many absolutes that we don't know what we're tied to he said we've got so many times one pulling this way and one pulling that way and one against the other he said how do the people know what to do he said that the pressure of the holy spirit coming down he'd been trying to find amen a place to move himself into that he can work word by word word by word amen then can i say to you tonight you are in position for the holy spirit to come into you and to manifest the promises of this word word by word by word then what you're feeling here tonight is the unseen force of the holy ghost now the problem of god said a doctor asked him one time they said billy don't you think that people that pentecostal people is just excited they're just nervous they're just screaming and hollering he said doctor you mean to tell me that her nerves can be excited without something to excite for him amen something has to excite them he said see that what it is it's the unseen force of the holy ghost it's the unseen force of the holy ghost moving among us and it excites that born against spirits let me just go ahead and say this i am done apologizing for being excited in the house of god i am done apologizing for worshiping my god i am done apologizing for being what god called me to me listen you didn't call me two years ago he called me from before the foundation of the world i don't just have representation in time i've got representation in eternity and the representation in eternity is a lot stronger than the representation in time i wasn't born to be a cold formal aristocratic stiff neck starchy church member i was born to be a son of god he was born to be a taunt of god he meant to manifest god in the power of his spirit in the age that you're living in amen i'll tell you this amen if something's not getting excited amen the spirit will not excite an unregenerated spirit the spirit will not excite an unborn against spirit but the spirit of god will excite a born-again spirit how can you be born again and not be excited about it well we might as well preach we're here how can some of us come out of the families we come out of and come out of the messes we come out of and come out the roads that we was on and the bars that you were sitting in and the churches you was bound under and god saved you and filled you with the holy ghost and revealed the greatest message that has ever hit the face of and we're not supposed to be excited i resent that devil in the name of jesus i am a son of god who has been born by the spirit of god i am a pre-born acts 2 son of god tongue talking message believer messiah preacher peter fire following son of god and there ain't no devil to back me off of it might as well clear that without the airways we've been born again by the spirit of god and we're excited about it we was on our way to hell but tonight we're on our way to heaven we was on our way to tribulation but because god rich and mercy revealed this message to us tonight we're on our way to the rapture it's the unseen force of the holy ghost he said it brings excitement to that spirit he said the power of god foams down through because faith cometh by hearing he said then the holy ghost takes the word and spreads it out over the people to catch it with the power that regenerated born again life he meant something has got to cry out if the spirit of god takes the word to a regenerated spirit in a son or daughter of god he said then something has got to cry out do you see that you're not the first one to feel the mood of god in the book of peter the bible says that the prophecy came not at old time by the will of men amen but holy men of god spake as they were moved somebody say moved as they were moved by the holy ghost he said we've tried to tell you the bible is the word of god it's wrote by god himself to the lips and instrumentality of man he said god can write himself god can speak himself god can do what he wants to but he chose man to do it because the man that wrote it is a part of god i don't have time to stop here but there's a beautiful thing land right there that if you ever was the son of god you always was the son of god see that those men who were writing about god was not writing about something that they were not a part of are you hearing me amen see the men wrote the bible he said now listen the men didn't even know what they were writing in their own human thinking they might have disagreed with it but they wrote it can you imagine you're sitting there writing they meant something and your own human thinking is disagreeing with what you're right and you pick up the pen to write something else and a spirit moves over you and makes you write something that disagrees with the very faults that you're thinking glory to god the spirit will make you agree with the word regardless of the way the flesh is feeling and then you think that paul wanted to write some of the things that he was writing but he was not in control of himself because he had welcomed the spirit of god amen listen to me tonight friends amen your flesh right now don't want to agree with the words you're here amen in your spirit may be so low right now it don't want to agree with the words you're hearing amen but i come here to tell you tonight amen that your soul is more stronger than your flesh it's more stronger than your spirit and if the spirit of god is in that soul you may be feeling defeated but when you hear the word say greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world he meant something will cry out because it's the spirit of god they've been moving upon that regenerated soul by the new birth he said men of old was moved by the holy ghost are you ready for this god moved their hands he moved their eyes in the missions they could say nothing but what they were looking at they could speak nothing because he had full control somebody say full control god had full control a finger amen of tongue of every organ of the body was in full sway with god no wonder the bible said they were gods he meant they were a part of god he was the fullness of god see that what it was it was the holy ghost taking control and moving in the body the pentagon said in the last days when the evening lights begin to shine eyes will become open and you will see where you are going amen that body is already formed listen if you're waiting for the forming of the body of jesus christ you're some 60 years too late because according to a prophet the body is already formed it is standing up on his feet it is taking motion it is moving by the holy spirit he said watch the same one that moved upon the prophets that wrote the bible is the same holy ghost that is moving in a body filled with the holy ghost moved in the holy ghost and it moved you out of every organization every kindred every tongue and every people come on friends don't you see what i'm preaching to you i'm telling you the move is home for the bride this is not a man's mood it's not a church's move it's not a preacher's move it's the move of almighty god and it's come down in this generation among the holy ghost moved in you to move you out of everything that was unlike the word to put you in possession to move you amen from time into eternity are you hear me it's the holy ghost moving it's not a man moving it's the holy ghost movement it's the holy ghost movement among the churches amen that is causing the people to hunger for reality it's moving in the church friends it's more than a man it's the reality of god do you realize if the holy ghost becomes a talk among the church the prophet of god said that will move the church to go to searching to go to hungarian to go to pulling for the realities of god i love these next words god is a reality how many believes god is a reality he said the gospel is a reality and can i tell you how god confirms his word he confirms it by his spirit he's been moving into humanity that has been born again by the spirit of god reverend said stay on the highway stay on the roadmap go the way the disciples went go the way the word preach live it testified i know it to be the truth he said signs in the last days is god living in a man it's god's program sign for the david of the last days is god living in a man it's god's program he said see god has to find somebody that he can trust somebody he can have confidence in that can have confidence in god a thing that can believe him do you believe that he said then when he finds such a man he can put his confidence and his power in a man that will follow the road they'll stay right on the map they'll go right on till he comes to the place of power he said faith will lead him to that because he's got faith in the word he'll lead him to power are you ready for this and power will lead him to the promise and then when he gets to the promise and begins to manifest what does it do it blinds the eyes of the unbeliever lukewarm creed servant brother amen come on now ain't that the holy ghost right here tonight is leading somebody even reality of this message the holy ghost right here tonight is leading somebody to a reality of the baptism of the holy ghost come on friends you might as well accept it this is not imagination this is reality this is not a fairy tale this is reality this is not some message that was hashtag on the backwoods of kentucky amen this is the mind of god it's the intelligence that has come down in the church in the last days to find somebody to manifest the potentials of god i might as well preach i'm this close to it that devil don't want you to break through right now because he knows the potentials of this meeting he knows the potentials of what happens when believers get together and they begin to join their faith together the holy ghost comes down and the spirit starts moving that option starts coming and a revival breaks out oh i say tonight god fan the flames god move upon the i church brother and i'm a little bit scared this time amen it ain't wildfire it's holy ghost empire come on you know why god sent this message to you because he can trust you are you hearing me he can trust you he brought you to this now he said and it's a reality it's the reality of following the word do you see what it is it's the reality of following the truth amen see that the hunger for a move of god is a blessing to first for a move of god is a blessing the bible said blessed they wish to hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled that word hunger means to suffer it means to seek with eager and is higher that word first means of those who are said to thirst who painfully feel their want of and eagerly long for those things by which the soul is refreshed and supported and strengthened then tonight we're not thirsting for things that will satisfy the flesh or will satisfy the spirit amen but jesus in matthew 5 was speaking of the soul he said those people that hunger and thirst for things that will support the soul that will refresh the soul amen that will strengthen the soul amen will be filled with the desire of their heart the power of god sit down in their heart lord they want to see the move of god amen and those that find out the devil don't do one thing he will do another how many can witness to that if the devil doesn't do one thing he'll do something else and if he don't do something else he'll do another thing even the problem god told us what he's doing amen he's trying to mess up something or comment something amen and it makes them kindly pull back a little bit in an amazing right when the breakthrough is pissing to happen is when the devil tries to garb up something right when the breakthrough is fixing to happen is when the devil starts trying to cause some little ill feeling to come into the meeting but i want to tell that devil tonight we are not of those that draw back unto perdition we are of the seat of abraham and we will fight that therefore we will not bow our needs and no spirit and give this meeting to the devil amen this is not the devil's meaning this is not the devil's message this is not the devil's service this is our message our hour our season our anointing the holy ghost is here even to break forth upon the church of the living god and we will not give that bible one second of this meeting if he won't survive he showed up at a good place to find one if he wants to find somebody that is anointed to press through every obstacle that he throws against us we will press through and we will overcome because we feel the holy ghost moving in our soul are you hearing me we don't back up we press on we don't quit we give it all we got we don't know the word quit we don't know the word retreat ain't backing up ain't turning around i'm not giving the devil one second of these meetings [Applause] well we might as well preach even right now some of y'all's given the devil a second of this meeting because right now that devil which is ease interpreter is trying to interpret to you the atmosphere that you're in why are you letting the cold devil interpret the atmosphere of the holy ghost [Applause] well there's an emotion is it sensation i'll tell you what the prophet god said he said it's god it's god but i know your quote from the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ coming into the individual and performing i'll go there with you amen i'll tell you something that was not mary's experience that was mary's pregnation her experience was in the upper row and in the upper room they got drunk in the upper room they got full of dynamics in the upper room their soul got refreshed their soul got streaked i'll tell you what we need to do we need to leave this chatter chatter chatter of the devil down here and break into another dimension until the holy ghost comes in and refreshes our preachers and refreshes our young people and refreshes our singer we need a refreshing on the presence of god in the church of god and if he said he would do it he'll confirm it if he said he would give it he'll back it up are you hearing me somebody might as well welcome it it's not coming it's here tonight it's not on its way it's here tonight [Applause] we've been tied down tied up widened up long enough i think it's time to get free again i think it's time to get free again i think it's time to remember what it's like ain't meant to break out into another dimension and feel the power of the holy ghost church through your soul well we might as well preach we're this close to it the devil don't want it but i really don't care god promised it and i'm in position to receive it you're in position to receive it we're not opposed to draw back we don't see a real movement god gets turned and then pull back and say well we got to control it no we fan the flames i say we fan the flame bro look we don't back up we pan the planes you know why because we're oh god i'm getting ahead of myself but i might as well preach it dawned on me the other day i got to look at the pillar of power and i heard the prophet god say what we need is souls lit by the flame of almighty god you know what don don't mean brother ben was over brother baby's head was not a pillar of ice it was a pillow tire it was not an icicle hanging over william branham's head it was a fire it was a holy fire it was a fire to burn out sin it was a power to burn out unbelief but i want to tell you tonight amen that fire it's not in the fallen cabinet in washington dc that fire is in this building tonight and it's whirling through here and it's here to set you on fire it's here to break that whole spell it's here to manifest the promises of his word with somebody giving praise somebody breaks that devil off somebody break that whole bible home put it back to hell where it comes from we're not under a pillar of our eyes we're under a pair of power [Applause] it's a move of god can i tell you what happens with the move of god it starts when god moves in his church comes into his church and proves that he is the same yesterday today and forever can i tell you what else and what god starts with it starts with people that settle to refuse for less than what god promised them [Music] testing it's still working it starts with people who refuse to settle for less than what god promised them they quit making bargains with the devil and get the full value of the full word in its full strength well i might as well preach amen you've been making deals with the devil and it's not going to work did it work last time did it work two years ago did it work 20 years ago amen that devil's a devil that breaks every deal he makes amen but my god said my god said all things are theirs they are the possessors of all things through the death of the son of god at calvary then come on tonight we're not going to be the heirs of salvation but right here tonight we are the heirs of salvation we are not going to be the heirs of raptured faith [Applause] hallelujah we are right now the heirs of laxing faith we're not moving into the message we are in the message as a matter of fact but it's all we are the message we're not going to be around the message we are the message i think what a move of god is a move of god is out of the routine i said the movement of god is out of the routine a mood of god is not ritualistic and it's not traditional a move of god is not theological can i say that right how do you say it theologically i graduated because of open book tests thank god for them a move of god is not a form it's not a ritual it's a fire it's an experience it's an action for the man it's a manifestation of god it's god coming in his church confirming the promise of his word you look in the book of john the ninth chapter sometime and you will find that in the days of jesus there was a move of god that got started with a young black boy a young blind boy started a move of god the bible said in john 9 29 we know that god's speaking to moses but as for this fellow we know not for which he is the man answered and said to them why herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he has opened mine eyes the problem of god said the blind boy is speaking to the spiritual leaders of the nation and here comes a man and opens my eyes by the power of god and yet you don't know nothing about it he said this is a marvelous thing he had something didn't he he did all right he did a man that could do this yet they didn't know which he was he said that was a marvelous thing one thing i love brother harold about about studying a prophet is he doesn't leave us in the past but he always turns the corner and brings us to the future and he takes his brother josh from john 9 to write here today and says now look today brethren we know we have a move of god [Applause] by the window we're not guessing we're not probing we're not presuming we know that we have a move of god he said we know it's performing miracles it's healing the sick it's raising the dead it's casting out devils it's speaking with tongues and interpretation it sends forth prophecies and they happen he showed his dreams perfect strictly this isn't a strange thing that the leaders would say we was a bunch of crazy people when the leaders of the nation or the churches he said that's a marvelous thing can i just go and say something to you if you're waiting on the white house to recognize the bride's revival before you act upon it you've done missed it [Applause] if you're waiting on putin to drop a bomb on america before you realize this message was the truth you're going to be a little bit too late amen but there is a people here tonight who is in position for another book of acts they are in position for another outpouring of the holy ghost entire come on what you see in a small measure while the headstone was descended you will see in the fullness of its power well someday somehow some neighbor to be in there's a super race coming someday there's a supersede coming someday there's a super sign coming may i say this day this scripture is fulfilled you are the super race you are the supersede you receive the super sign you are a super race by the baptism of a holy ghost you're not going to be an invincible army you are an invincible army you're not going to be overcomers you are overcomers because you recognize we have received a move of god it's moving church [Music] [Applause] i tell you what a true move of god is it's a scriptural move you know why because jesus is very scriptural you won't find one move but what you can prove it by the scripture it's a preacher can you prove that i can it's in the book of john the fifth chapter jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me remember i said let me give you a scripture first with what we do it must be scriptural it's got to be scriptural god won't honor nothing else see he only honors his word he promised my word will not return to me void it'll accomplish that which its purpose for he said and we see the word that's lauded today no matter how much unbelief rises in the camp and we got a quote to put the devil on the run no matter how much unbelief rises in the camp god will honor his word when he find faith to honor it by oh god god will honor his word when he finds faith to honor it by are you seeing where i'm at i'm in john the ninth chapter a little boy raised in the religious movement of the day amen and the religious leaders missed it they didn't recognize it but a little blind boy had faith he had a crevice brother david in his heart oh god i'm about to shout my shoehill's home he had a grandness in his heart and there was a pressure in the land that day that this man that was doing all these miracles was just a fanatic he was just an illegitimate child he was just a worked up emotional man but there was a pressure in the land that day there was a pressure that was moving in the land and it was looking for a heart that had a crevice in it that it could leak the faith of the promised word into and without one approval from a religious leader that god would come down and would vindicate the manifestation [Applause] don't you see who you are tonight you are the living vindicated manifestation of the message of the hour [Applause] oh god he said preacher what are you talking about i'll tell you what jesus said he said go your way and tell john what things you've seen and heard how that the blind sea the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and then the death here the dead are raised and the poor the poor the gospel is preached to them you can i tell you what jesus done he done exactly somebody said exactly he done exactly what the scripture said he would do remember i'm so in the very bible said when he came that the blind should see the lame men would leap like a harp he said they all had seen that the word was manifested now listen but the boy knew he had been there he had been there he was not talking from the third person he was talking from the first person he had been there he'd be under the pressure of the holy ghost oh god come on friends i mean this great pack another devil's high to the wall they say the boy in finland didn't raise from the grave how can they say that they wasn't there but i was come on now brother man said when jesus walked the source of galilee you walked with him when he raised the widow of maine's son you was with him when he went to calvary he was with him when he walked on water he was with him when he went in the grave he was with me when he went to hell he was with him he said and when he rose on the third day he said you was there with him amen because he was in him then whatever he done in the word you was a part of it he was at the wedding you and if you was there then you'll be here now i was there when seven angels appeared upon the mountain i was there on the ohio river i was there in finland i was there in germany i was there in india you say how can you say that because the god that i was in was there and if i was in him there i'm in him now [Applause] you might as well spread his shoulders back and tell that long tongue line devil get out of my way i am a son of god in action by the move of god [Applause] he ought to know whether herald he was there what did he knew he was in action he was ready are you ready for this he was ready before his boss he was ready before the priest he was ready before the council he was ready for anything because he had recognized god i'm going somewhere he had recognized god and humbled himself and went into action with this testimony see that's a real servant can i ask you brother what did he see there brother then what did he see that he recognized and humbled himself too can i tell you brother joe he saw god in flesh he saw john 1 1 in john 1 14 and he recognized this is more than a man [Music] can i say like our prophet said that's our lord up there to god you know where i'm at don't you amen they said it's a smoke they said it's a rocket ship they said it's a cloud but a prophet of god stood there and said no that's our lord affair he recognized whom it was it was revelation 10 1 it was luke 21 25 it was revelation 1 7. come on church it was our lord in the manifestation of his glory well then tell me what that boy went into action on he went into action on god in the flesh all right how can i bring it to our day the problem god said watch he said see and the pillar of fire the pillar of fire ought to put us in action today as we've seen it vindicated in the words of his promise for this hour this last day it should put the whole move of god into action when you see the pillar of fire and recognize that it's god and humble yourself to it can i tell you what we're following we're following a scriptural purifier the bible said in exodus 13 i'm doing okay on time let me preach look at me more than you're looking at your watch we'll get through it the lord went before them by being a pillar clown to lead them away and by night and a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from where from before the people he said now watch when he brought the children of israel out of the wilderness into the wilderness he led them by a pillar of fire is that right the bible said he did and he went before them that was the anointing glory to god that was the anointing the holy spirit christ that went before the children of israel hello joe i'm about to shout my way out this bill brother ben what do you want another door in here are you all hear me if you want shout material it ain't coming from an organ it's coming from the word the pillar of fire went from before them if he's the same as he was then he's the same man the same god he's the same person he's everything he was then he is now and as he led the church in the natural he is leading the church today in the spiritual do you see it remember israel come through many things but it was in the evening time when the lamb when the token was required it was not in the morning it was not in the preparation it was not in the 14 days of the keeper the lamb it was israel in the evening time israel knowed something was coming i'm identifying your name by the word israel knowed something was coming brother dale lauren said so did luther know he said so did wesley know it so did finney and knox and calvin know it this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that those things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they looked forward to it come on friends israel knew it would return finney and knox and calvin amen they knew it would return but they didn't live long enough to see it but thanks be to god according to revelation 3 and revelation 10 we were to receive a seventh angel who was not a reformer he was a prophet come on you had three messengers upon the earth sowing three seeds at the same time you have billy graham showing the nominational seed and he was using this kind of language i know god is somewhere you had oral roberts who was so a pentecostal seed who was saying i feel god is somewhere in the building but you had william branham who had an end time sign scene ministry which was another spoken word standing

my name there am i in the midst of them the product said see what that is that is a divine promise from god it's god's word on written record can i tell you something in matthew 18 what happened if you go to luke 24 you will see the god who spoke the word confirm his own word in luke the 24th chapter the bible says jesus raised from the dead and was walking along the emmaus road and there was two brother mark there was two that was on the emmaus road but their eyes were holding that they didn't know who he was and when jesus appeared to him he began to say why are you sad why are you so tore up why are you so brokenhearted they said are you a stranger around war are you a stranger around harding arkansas are you a stranger around black rock are you a stranger around paulie o'clock are you a stranger around virginia are you a stranger lord our god has just been our lord has just been crucified and he's laying in the tomb everybody said watch he said but what they didn't realize was they was walking with the answer the answer was in their midst but they didn't recognize it because their eyes were holding i want to drop something to you because the problem of god terms have to

him right and the bible says that simon the pharisee invited jesus brothers in other words he had a trick up his sleeve sister denise he had a he had a trick up his sleeve he was not that jesus to fix him with spaghetti dinner she fixes a good spaghetti dinner during turkey season he was not inviting jesus for dinner he was inviting brother joe to prove he was not a prophet oh god but the prophet of god said out of that comes a revelation are you hearing me listen this computer screen ain't nothing to me i was preaching to new york one time got to preach and hit the wrong button and turn fox news it's on same god let the computer scream be there are you hearing me but out of that come a revelation brother ben that jesus accepts all of his invitations the prophet said no matter who you are how rich you are how poor you are how bad off you are how well off he will come if you'll invite him come on word alive he'll come if you will invite him brother david he'll come and kill him sister mary he'll come right there where you're sitting if you'll just invite him you say preacher i don't know if he'll come the problem of god said he never turns down an invitation if you want jesus here just invite him he never turns down an invitation forever said he never has and he never will but i invite him on thursday nights i invite him on friday nights i invite him to be here on saturday morning i invite him to be [Applause] and turned it down remember said see but what happened was the pharisee had invited some celebrities too he said what happened was is jesus brother josh jesus come in their midst he'd come in their mess and they didn't even know he was there because they was too worried about the president that just showed up or the dignitary that just showed up probably said brother ben let jesus come in oh god can i preach brother daddy the brother said in those days there was people called footwash flunkies he said nobody got by the footwash funky heard him say today he said it's a mystery to me how jesus got by the footwash flunky come on now that footwash flunky had a job you don't let one person come in this house you know you don't let one person come in here but once you stop them and you wash their feet but that foot wash clunky was blinded because there was a greater miracle coming are you hearing me that foot was flunky somehow or another didn't see jesus when he come in and he went over and sit down in the corner can i say it like this he was blinded so that your eyes could see he was blinded so your eyes could see come on church had the footwash funky washed his feet we wouldn't have the rest of the story but because it was more than a service it was more than a july meeting it was a predestinated moment in the presence of god he flagged in the eyes of a footwash punky because there was a type of the bride coming in the house there was a greater type coming in oh god barbara said watch he come in and sit down he said i want you to catch something he said there's two parts he said there's inviting there's inviting but then there's welcoming there's inviting but then there's welcoming he said see when you invite look at this definition of the word invite can i have five minutes it means to make a polite or formal or friendly request to someone to go somewhere or to do something so we have invited you by the way of announcement to these meetings brother ben you printed up flyers and invited people right y'all are here because you've been invited but you know why you come back do you know why you stay it's because you're made welcome you remain welcome when you're invited now look at this word welcome it means to be glad to entertain someone or to receive something are you ready for this it is to react with pleasure or approval brother david amen it's an action you invited him is an action him showing up is a reaction you welcome in him it's a reaction to the action of him showing up it means to react with pleasure to an event or development it is gladly to receive can i close on this part can i close right here to welcome something is to indicate that one is relieved to be relinquished in the control or possession of something to another let me read that to you again to really welcome something is to be glad to relinquish amen control or possession of something to another can i tell you something they invite jesus but when he shows up they say don't make them shout and don't preach too long and don't let him dance the eyes and just sit in the corner amen that's just invite him that if you want to make him welcome when he shows up and you feel his pressure in the atmosphere take your hands off the service and say god this is your song service this is your meeting this is your service these are your people this is your message i'm your son i'm your way you want to let god come in the middle and make you welcome let go church let go let go and let god have his way can we welcome him can we welcome him jesus comes where he is invited but he only stays where he is made welcome wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them are you hear me the prophet said the church won't welcome christ they won't welcome christ amen can i ask you something who is christ brother man who is christ i'll tell you what the bible says the bible says christ is god he is the logos of god are you hearing me and let me slap another devil while i'm here you don't want people to be moved by the preaching of the word you ought to be ashamed of yourself you don't want people to respond when the word is preached you got to be ashamed of yourself you know why you know why because if i got up here and told you a sad story and i moved to my sad story to cry it'd be okay to cry and if i told you haha funny and it moves you to laugh it'd be okay to laugh amen then tell me how come i cannot stand under the creative power of the logos of almighty god and preach the inspired word listen my sermon is not coming from a man it's coming from the pinnacle that i'm under tonight i have become a microphone for the purifier that whatever is fooling you is not coming from and recover it's not coming from in the martian it's not coming from times it's coming from the pentaphile you know why because the moon is on for the rock that's just saying the lord who is christ he's the word he's the logos of god i'm trying to close right here remember christ is the word he's not the theology he's the word what else is christ brother jerome christ is the anointing give me some shout room up here brother matt christ is the anointing he said see the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word and makes it live see then he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the anointed word christ is the anointed word can i take oh god i'm trying to quit can i tell you austin what brother man was really saying when he said the unwelcome christ he was saying the unwelcomed anointing they want the word without the anointing they want church without anointing you know why because when the anointing comes in a meeting you no longer have control those gospel eyes will preach we're just close to it amen they didn't thought devils because men think they're going to control the anointing they've called the spirit of god and we're going to control the holy ghost we're going to control who shouts we're going to control who sins i'll tell you how that word should come from babylon it comes from the prince of hell and there's no room in the house of god for nicolette and leadership [Applause] i just bumped something but you all know me well enough to know how i'm right through it are you hearing me there's no room in the house of god for a man to try to control the holy ghost we got young people addicted to pornography we got young people leaving church and we got a bunch of plains police sitting in the house of god trying to control the anointing control the spirit of god but i say is there anybody here ready to welcome the anointing in this meeting are you ready to welcome the anointing you know what happens the bible says because of the anointing the yoke is destroyed the bible said the spirit of the lord is upon me he is anointed me he has equipped me as the messiah in an administrative office to manifest messiah's power [Applause] brother joe they don't want the anointing they don't want the anointing but we need it we've had enough unannoying singing come on i'm going to preach we've had enough unanointed preaching we've had enough men's ideas behind the pulpit restricting the sons and daughters of god i say away with that nonsense and uproot the anointing [Applause] [Music] a little psychology idea and we counseling a little bit and we wrote that thing off and they come right back you know why because the anointing don't break the anointed destroys testing one two it's still working i said the anointing don't break the anointing destroys i didn't come here just for a breakthrough i come here for a destroy through i come here for a destroyer i want to announce to that devil right now his scheme is destroyed his idea is destroyed and jesus christ the son of god now you know i'm telling you the truth you say preacher why don't you want that yolk broke because if that yolk is broke tonight you know what happens when something's broke there's a potential to repair it so you break it you take it to the store and they repair it but if they look at it and they say it is destroyed it's beyond repairing it's beyond putting back together it's beyond counseling not together when the spirit of the lord comes in the building and the anointing breaks out upon the congregation it don't just break the oak it destroys the old well i speak to you in the name of the lord by the word of faith there's some yokes right now being destroyed in the house of god because the anointing has been welcomed is there any fathers want to welcome the anointing is there any mothers want to welcome the anointing is there any young people want to welcome the anointing is there any preachers that want to welcome the anointing sister jordan we welcome the anointing we welcome him in these meetings have your way lord [Applause] i got to get off my heart brother man when you

life you wondered if you had one but when you recognize the word was the unfailing body word of the son of man you recognize and release the desire to know i've got a theory i wish somebody recognized him for a minute because when you recognize him you release his power [Applause] it's thursday night it's the first night but brother ben i gotta get to jesus i gotta get to jesus i'm an ill-famed woman i've got a horrible reputation i'm on my way to hell but i heard simon the pharisee was having a meeting over word of life no i'm not calling you a pharisee i heard i heard they was having a meeting and i heard jesus was going to be there i heard when the window was coming i heard that other guys was going but i heard jesus was going to be there but the man i heard jesus was going to be

climbs up and she looks in there and she says my lord my lord he's got dirty feet where's the foot wash flunky he's sitting there with dirty feet but the problem of god said there was something in her [Applause] predestinated scene there was something in her that said this is your opportunity in his presence this is your opportunity in his presence lord i don't have nothing to bring i don't have nothing to give him but i'll take what little bit of money i've got are you still with me brother man why was he there because pharisees were trying to prove he was not a prophet and this woman knowing who he was said if i go buy this alabaster box of ointments and bring it back to him he'll know about this through money for prostitution was it ever dawned on you he never acknowledged where the money come from he never acknowledged where the money come from to buy the ointment of the alabaster box but the problem of god said but since he had to elbow our way through how many is ready to

almost there keep on going we're almost there come on church we can't give up keep on going we're almost there she elbowed her way through and she got over there and she knelt down and the problem of god said the tears began to flood upon his feet he said all she had left was the glory from her hair he said it fell down and she washed his feet he said her stink went onto his feet and his stents come on to her but i want to leave you this he said when she recognized that was the son of god and she made her way to jesus feed he said she released [Applause] she released forgiveness she released power she released joy she released eternal life oh god one minute she was an ill-famed woman the next minute her name is immortal and jesus said wherever the gospel is preached let that woman be mentioned you know why because the same anointing that was upon that woman is upon this meeting tonight you can't be free you can be whole you can't be delivered you can't break out of that prison
