was able to make it this year last year i had to cancel and i thought i might have to cancel again this year i got stuck in canada uh tuesday and wednesday but we made it so thank the lord for that amen i've enjoyed the the past two sermons they've been wonderful i've been blessed by them have you all enjoyed them so far amen isaiah 59 and 19 before we read let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy lord god we've lord we've got so much out of the last couple services lord but this is a new service another opportunity and i asked lord that you would anoint me father as i lay myself aside speak through these lips of clay lord you see the needs that are in this building father the desires of the heart i ask lord that the word would go and meet the need father minister to the hearts of your people lord may you may the congregation leave themselves aside father and and receive the words of life this morning we ask these things in your precious name amen in isaiah 59 and 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against it amen you may be seated this morning it's got a simple subject this morning but if i had a title it would be a standard raised by the message and i want to start out by saying that this message ain't just for the adults it ain't just for the elders too many times we get in our in our minds you know me growing up i always thought the message was just for the preachers just for the adults just just for the the parents but this message ain't just for the adults but it's for a young people there's somebody on earth that's being a light at school and somebody on earth being a light at the job site there's somebody on earth that's proclaiming the life of jesus christ but i like how the bible puts that the enemy shall come in like a flood he's saying and not maybe so not not a hope so not not if the devil gets lucky but the enemy is going to come in like a flood but it didn't just stop there he says the enemy is going to come in but at the same time the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard so it may look dark it may look bleak it may look impossible to live an overcoming life it may look impossible to live a victorious life but god's promise that there's going to be a power in this last day to rise above sin rise above lay out us here and i believe there's some young people today those proclaiming that this scripture is coming to pass in this last day this wasn't speaking of days gone by but it was speaking of this day this is the most evil day the most wickedest day but there's still somebody living a pure life an unadulterated life it's somebody on earth thus proclaiming the life of jesus christ you see the brother branham says there's going to be two spirits at work in this last day the spirit of god and the spirit of antichrist the spirit of the antichrist and both of these spirits are coming for your life for your mind for your body and you're going to give heed to one of those spirits and produce the actions of those spirits you look up you look at the world today there's evil but the way evil is known today is by summoning somebody producing evil somebody's life is smoking they're drinking they're doing these things their life is producing the spirit that they're under but if the spirit of the devil can cause somebody to commit suicide if the spirit of the devil can cause somebody to pierce their ears and to put tattoos on their body what will the spirit of christ do in a young people that surrendered oh come on somebody i don't believe we got to be bound to pornography i don't gotta i don't believe we got to be bound to smoking and they're drinking but there's a power on earth that can take control of your life and you can produce the actions of jesus christ but we gotta surrender to one of those spirits but you see this antichrist spirit is not just after it's not after the denominations he's already got him the methodists the baptists the pentecostals they're all consumed by their spirit but he's after the bride of jesus christ because you haven't pushed away the word of god but you've embraced the message of the hour that's why he's starting targeting your life you see brother branham says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts notice how he says that the true church he's making a separation but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit will come into the church he's making a separation there's two spirits there's two groups but there's two different results the true church is coming under the spirit of christ and is producing another book of acts there's a power inside of the bride of christ to defeat everything the devil sins against us but i'm going to continue reading but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church defiling it making it lukewarm formal and powerless so there's two groups he's making a separation the church and the true church one of the message come to do it come to pull the true church out of the church brother branham says moses called a nation out of a nation that message made a separation and gave the children of israel an authority to march over the spirit that was inside of egypt and this message has given the bride of christ a group of young people the authority to march over the antichrist spirit that's proclaiming that it's real and it's proclaiming that it's powerful but there's a bribe that's resisting it and saying there's an authority inside of this message and i'm not going down defeated i'm rising up an overcomer i'm not going in the tribulation i'm going in the rapture i'm not going down but i'm going up but somebody's got somebody's gotta surrender itself to that spirit to revelation you see that the egyptians tried to follow the children of israel out of bondage but not everybody's gonna make this rapture the make-believers trying to make a rapture the unbelievers trying to make a rapture the hypocrites are trying to make a rapture but there's only one that's going in the rapture that's somebody that has surrendered themselves to the spirit of revelation which is coming by the message of the hour amen yes sir you see that the egyptians tried going through the red sea but they missed a step the only way to produce the message of that day was to come under the message i know this is a young people service but too many people is trying to produce the actions of the message without coming under the headship of the message come under the headship of the message and it'll produce an invincible army it'll produce more than a conqueror it will produce what god has for this last day you may say brother josh how do you come under the headship by surrendering your thoughts of what's right surrendering what you think and coming under the message and saying this message is my ultimate it may come against my thinking it may come against my ideas it may come against my reasoning but this message is the only way for a rapture so i'm going to come under the headship of the message so you see they tried going through the red sea but they missed the step the message says apply the token the message said apply the blood the message said but since they have their own ideas oh i'm going to preach this morning since they have their own thoughts they said no we don't need to do that i don't believe in that but i'm still going to go through the red sea but there was no power to overcome outside of the message of that day there's no power to overcome on the outside of the message for this thing you may say but the josh i don't believe that well the baptist is reading the same bible you're reading the pentecostals are reading reading the same bible you're reading the baptists are reading the same bible as your reading but they're not producing an overcoming life they don't know what it means they're under the wrong spirit but the message of the yahweh come to say no this is man's ideas or they say there's three gods but that's wrong they say do this but that's wrong the message come to pull you out of man's ideas and give you god's interpretation you see man's ideas ain't going gonna produce a rapture man's ideas ain't gonna produce a body change but the message of the hour will produce a body change produce a rapture produce a future home that's why i believe it's sticking with the message you may say brother josh that's just for the grown-ups i'm a young person that's come under the message and i can see what the power of this message will do in a 13 year old boy's life a 15 year old boy's life i don't care what age you're at the message can work through your life i was feeling the car to preach at 12 years old and i was praying and asking the lord what to do and something spoke to my heart get into the message 12 years old that wasn't a boy's mind that wasn't a voice thinking that wasn't a boy's reasoning that was the call of god on my life saying you've got a purpose on her and the way to fulfill that purpose is to get in the message of the hour and you've got a purpose on your life every one of you have a calling but you got to come under the message of the hour so that that calling can be fulfilled you see moses had a calling on his life too but he couldn't fulfill it until he met the back side of the desert but the pillar of fire and i believe we got the pillar of fire on this last day that is commissioning us what to do you see moses trying to fulfill that calling in his own ability and he killed one egyptian there was no power inside of just his calling to fulfill the word he was prophesied he was elected he was he was ordained to be there but until he met the pillar of fire which gave him his commission he couldn't fulfill his purpose and until you meet the pillar of fire which is given the message of the hour you can't fulfill your purpose hope that's okay this morning but once he came under the pillar of fire heated to his commission oh you know what i like about the story was the pillar of fire was speaking out of the burning bush and it was quoting scripture it says i have i have heard the cries of my people and i've come to deliver them which was a scriptural promise so now we got scripture then there was the pillar of fire which is the holy ghost but did you this didn't just stop there but then a message came forth the message was proclaiming what the scripture was saying for that day we didn't just have a scripture a promise in this day but we got a message to proclaim that that scriptural promise can be fulfilled amen oh i hope this is okay this morning hallelujah but once he came under his commission there was no devil could stand in his way there was no there was no there was nothing that could stand in his way he came up with boldness he was a coward he was running away from the egyptians but once he come under the commission that god had for his life he wasn't a coward no more but he knew there was a greater authority backing him up and he would go up to pharaoh and say let my people go i don't care what you're saying i don't care what your strong codes are i've been commissioned to proclaim there's a liberty for the people of god and if there's somebody that can hear the commission this morning the message of the hour is saying you don't got to be bound no longer you don't got to be shackled no longer but your commission is to rise up more than a conqueror through christ jesus oh hallelujah but it was only under the message of moses you see god would speak through prophets throughout the old testament the way the people would hear god was through the prophets the bible says let me find the scripture here the bible would say that god spoke through prophets in ii peter first and 20 knowing this first that no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man so it was flawed human beings bringing forth a message to the people it wasn't their own thoughts it wasn't the will of man but it was god relying his thoughts to a prophet then he would preach those words preach those thoughts you know what is a word it's a thought expressed so it was the thoughts of god then it would come into a prophet then it was a word but then that word had to materialize the word had to materialize so whenever moses said uh or whenever noah says there's going to be a flood it was the thoughts of god then it came unto the prophet and he spoke then it was the word of god then the word was going to materialize they didn't know when it was going to materialize but they just know if they stuck with the message it was going to materialize you look at uh you look at jonah jonah went up and he says repent or perish it was a thought then it came to the prophet then it was a word then the word started to materialize hope you're open you're you're following me this morning moses it was a thought then it came a word then the word started to materialize what i'm saying is it was the thoughts of god that came over william branham a prophet and he spoke the word and now it's materializing in a group of young people there's been thoughts for this last day that says you're more than a conqueror the gates of hell won't prevail against you but you will prevail against them those were thoughts now it's a word and now it's being materialized right here in a group of young people there's no devil there's no hell there's no spirit no antichrist spirit can keep you bound when you come under the thoughts of god come under the thoughts of god and it will produce the thoughts for this day oh you look at hattie wright hattie wright was hearing the thoughts of god brother branham was speaking of the third pool and too many people keep the third pool with the prophet but that's not the case that wasn't the thoughts of god the thoughts of god was for you to speak to this mountain then the thoughts of god came to a prophet then he proclaimed the word so he was speaking of the squirrels that he spoke into existence and howdy wright was hearing the story hearing the testimony hearing the thoughts of god come forth and she says my that's nothing but the truth that's not just for the prophet that's for me the knowledge certainly the same inspiration that was on the prophet came upon howdy right and let me shame they say this the same inspiration that came on malachi 4 the broader message is the same inspiration that can come on a group of young people and produce and manifest the message that malachi 4 broad you're not a powerless army you're not a powerless group of young people but you're more than conquerors through christ jesus through the message of the hour and so howdy writes this that's nothing but the truth there's something on the inside that's calling to me that's what the message does there's a seed on the inside we know but the random says only the elected can see this message so there's a seed on the inside that says that's nothing but the truth brother branham turned around and he says you speak the words so no longer was this ministry just with brother branham but the same authority that brother branham had was now given to hattie wright under his message and so howdy right you see the the the simplicity of hattie wright she looked at brother branham and says what do i say what do i ask for she wasn't looking for money she wasn't looking for prestige but she was looking for something that that that only only god could give her and so brother branham says you ask for a million dollars and it'll be right here you speak the the healing for your sister and it'll happen and she stopped and her boys were laughing at her there was two boys her two sons were laughing and making fun and she stopped and he says i want the salvation of my two boys and right there they were snickering they were laughing they were making fun they were in shackles but the mess has produced an authority you want to see your your kids safe stick with the message your opinions ain't going to get your kids safe your ideas ain't going to get your kids paid keep whip this a message and you'll see your young people become an invincible army marching over sin merchant over pornography marching over complexes merchant over anxiety there's an authority inside of this message young people you want to rise in power get inside of this message like i said this message ain't just for adults it's for young people but somebody's got to get into the message listen to the tapes study it for yourself i wasn't going off my daddy's revelation i was studying myself at 12 years old 13 years old 14 years old and i can say as a witness this message has an authority to keep my life and it has an authority to keep your life under the message of the hour so all of a sudden those boys were laughing and snickering but they didn't realize the devil didn't realize that there was an authority being released to a parent the devil may think he's got you bound he may think you're shackled and on your way to hell but he don't realize that you've got some godly parents that's not under man's interpretation but is under the message of the hour and let me say this you may think you're having a great time out in the world you may think you're partying and having a great time but there's going to come a time where god's going to get a hold of your life and so you might as well save yourself some trouble and just give your life to christ because if you're elected god's going to get a hold of your life those boys tried everything they could do to resist the calling of god you may try to resist the calling you may sit here and say no i don't believe none of that but if god's got a calling on your life he's going to make sure you fulfill it then those boys fell over the moment's lap crying weeping what happened somebody come under the message and that produced an authority hope this is okay this morning you see you look at isaiah isaiah proclaimed a prophecy a prophecy and says a virgin is going to conceive and that was 400 years later that was a thought then it become a word through a prophet but there was going to come a time where that word was materialized it didn't matter what time how long it took if god said it was going to happen god was going to make sure it comes to pass you know we've heard it many times where's the rapture going to happen you've been preaching that for all these years it don't matter how long it's going to take god has pronounced his thoughts in this day it's going to materialize one of these days and so there came mary and you know what happened there was an angel a messenger that came to mary and started to pronounce scripture you look at when gabriel visited mary she was pronouncing there was probably 10 scriptures in his message he was he was a he was a given to her then he stops and he says you're going to have a baby so it no longer was just scripture but now it was a prophecy it was a message pronouncing that scripture was about to come to pass but it wasn't just message and bible but now was the holy ghost she says how can this be i know no man then the angel stops and he says the holy ghost is going to overshadow you you want to produce the word of god for this day there's the scripture the message which backs up scripture or the the scripture backs up the message then the holy ghost starts to produce it just like moses moses had the scripture have the message and the pillar of fire just like mary had scripture the message and the holy ghost what do we have in this day we got scripture the message comes out of scripture and we've got the holy ghost to make it live oh hallelujah and there was nobody that could keep that word from coming to pass there was no critic she was criticized she was made fun of but she was given a promise to produce the word for this day for that day you may be criticized you may be made fun of but you've been given a promise to produce the word for this day amen hallelujah well you look at you look at hope it's okay this morning you look at jesus jesus had a word concerning his life he was on earth to fulfill scriptural prophecy that was the only only reason he was on earth and the devil thought he could destroy the purpose in his life and so what happened herod says i'm going to destroy all the baby boys what was he doing destroying the young people he was trying to destroy the young people because they was the one fulfilling scripture why is the devil after the young people because you're the next generation of lawyers that's going to fulfill scripture but there was no devil as they as herod's uh as the army was going through the houses destroying baby boys jesus couldn't be destroyed he had a purpose for his life he had a calling on his life oh whenever whenever the the scraps and the pharisees were going to push him off the mountain remember and he disappeared they couldn't destroy him he had a purpose for his life god was going to make sure that his purpose wasn't going to be destroyed you may say wow he was invincible yeah so are you you've got a purpose on your life for this day just like jesus was invincible he couldn't be destroyed until his purpose was fulfilled you can't be destroyed until your purpose is fulfilled oh hallelujah you look at moses and go back to moses moses had a prophecy had up for his life and you notice he had some god-fearing parents brother branham says that an angel came to a jockey bed i believe the father and says you're going to have a son he's going to be the deliverer and so there was a godly parent there that didn't believe he was given serpent seed dad always told us that growing up god didn't give me serpent seed but god has a calling on your life and i believe there's still some parents today that's believing the same thing god hasn't given me serpenty but god has given me somebody that's elected for this day yes sir and so as the soldiers the same thing happened in jesus day pharaoh knew that there was a next generation rising up that was going to overpower him one day so what did he do he went out to destroy the next generation just like the devil knows there's the next generation of warriors rising up that's going to destroy his kingdom that's why he pornographies on the rampage lust and smoking and drinking at complexes he knows you're the next generation of warriors what happened what would have happened if all the mamas and daddies passed away if all the kids all the all the boys were destroyed there wouldn't have been the next generation so whenever mama and daddy passed away the children of israel would have become extinct there would have been no longer and so their wedding those scriptural prophecies concerning their life wouldn't have come to pass if there wasn't a next generation to fulfill them hope you're catching me this morning there's prophecies for this day the devil knows if mama and daddy go off the scene and you're not alive still by the holy ghost there's not going to be a next generation of warriors but i believe there's some young people that's not coming under that spirit that is under another spirit and see i'm here for a purpose and that's to be the next generation of warriors and so what happened they created an ark they put a little ark together and put moses in it and pushed him off in the nile river but the branham says god sent a thousand angels to make sure he wouldn't be destroyed there was crocodiles there was this there was that but there was nothing that could destroy moses because he had a purpose for his life and there's nothing that can destroy you because there's a purpose for your life oh hallelujah hope this is okay this morning but you see the reason why we i know i'm all over the place but the reason why we needed the message was to come and show us what truth really is like i said earlier the baptist is reading out of the same bible the methodist is reading out of the same bible the pentecostals is reading out of the same bible but have different interpretations this one believes there's three gods this one believes in sprinkling this one believes eve ate an apple this one believes this and that but there had to come somebody to say no that's not true because there's the standards they're living you see let me read the definition of a standard so i got ahead of myself the definition of a standard is somebody is something established by authority as a model or example and so we see the church world has become a model or example for the antichrist spirit and so god didn't want just examples for the devil he wanted examples for himself so he had to give a message to say no you're living the wrong example you're living the wrong life there's no overcoming power in man's interpretations so he sent this malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the original word how do you touch god the bible says it is impossible to please god without faith now how do you get faith the bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god so the only way to get faith is by hearing the word of god not man's interpretations so the only way to produce scripture for this day was for us to hear the word of god which is the message of the hour oh that just struck my heart the other day while i was preaching this and distract me faith only that made it was so simple to me that's why we had to have the message of the hour you can't be healed without faith you can't see the rapture without faith you're not going to get a body change without faith and faith only cometh by hearing the word not man's twisted ideas of the word but god's purely unadulterated word is going to produce faith and that is what the message come to do is to produce a faith so now we're no longer living under the antichrist spirit but we come under the spirit of revelation they're producing that spirit's actions but the bride is producing producing other actions we've come under the message and now we're producing different actions oh you see brother branham says just like god was in christ fulfilling the word christ is in the bride fulfilling the word for this day he says the living god takes the living word and personally vindicates it to our lives takes the living word not some fake idea but in the living word and now what's producing it in our lives you see just like christ was to make the word live when he was on earth the bride is on earth to make the word live you look at second corinthians 3 and 2 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men first timothy 4 and 12 let no man despise thy youth be thou an example of the believers in word and conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity known and read by all men beat out an example what's it what's the standard an example of a higher authority you see so the vindication of christ's ministry was him living the word because he stopped and he said search the scriptures for they testify of me his life was vindicating the message he had was the truth and i believe your life is a vindication that the message we've gotten this day is the truth you look at when jesus they asked for a sign and jesus says as jonah was in the belly of the well for three days so will the son of man be in the belly of the earth for three days so we know when he was crucified he was placed in the tomb he wasn't dead his spirit was alive the body was dead but there was a promise given that the body was going to raise up even though the spirit was alive but in order for the world to know he was alive the body had to raise up the spirit went to hell in the minister to the souls he went to paradise but he wasn't known on earth that he was alive because the body was still dead the spirit of god has been alive it's been here with power and authority but it needs a body to fulfill itself and say god's not dead he's alive but the body has to proclaim that it's alive and you're the body of christ on earth that's proclaiming to the world that god's not dead he's alive god needs somebody to realize we're on earth for a special purpose that's to proclaim that jesus christ is alive he's not dead he's not somewhere else but he's right here living in my skins living in your skins living in your body you're proclaiming to the world that god is alive he's alive you're proclaiming through your actions your actions is going to proclaim whether you're a christian or not that's what that's what the the the denominations don't realize their actions are proclaiming who they are your actions proclaim who you are and so the message come to say the actions that they've got are the wrong actions but the actions that you're supposed to produce is right here but god has given us his thoughts you see brother branham says it takes one person surrendered to god to his word jesus christ was god made flesh in order to die the word he was he the word was the same the word just flowed but just flew through him there was no doubt at all and god is trying to get somebody through the sanctifying power of christ to yield to that word that he and the word can become one again that he can use the word through that person just like hattie wright she yielded to the words then she started to manifest the same word the same authority that the prophet had i hope you're catching it this morning the same authority that christ had to produce the word is inside of some young people and the same power that he had to say search the scriptures they testify of my life the you young people's got the same power to say devil they're scriptures for this day and i'm producing them i'm manifesting them i'm showing to the world that god's alive through my life it's a standard that's been raised by the message of the hour but the brandon says another place we are made partakers of his holiness we in his image we are living images of god then dead to self raised with him now listen listen to this his word is made flesh again in us the word is made flesh again in us just like christ was word made flesh there's some young people that his word made flesh once again oh my he says oh brother neville look what is it not the mythical imaginary god setting out there but the living god what is the living god let's let a prophet answer it what is the living god the word in you making itself real it's the word in you making itself real so no longer is it just a thought it ain't just the word but it's a living word making itself real among some young people hallelujah the word is manifesting itself once again he says whoa glory to god oh i know you think i'm a holy ruler maybe i am but brother do you see it triumph over every denomination over every paganism a living god made manifest in a and the word of god which is god is made flesh in you the living god is no longer in the eternal realms but it's in some young people proclaiming to the world that jesus christ is alive and well he's not in a tomb he's not way off but he's right here in your skins in your flesh and you're producing the life of christ you're a standard you're an example of the power of god because of this message hallelujah amen oh hallelujah just like god have preeminence in christ and fulfill the word for that day christ the word is having preeminence in some young people and is producing the word for this day another quote hope this is okay this morning and that's exactly he says when the church and the word that that's exactly why the church and the word has to be won like jesus and god was one just exactly god was in christ reconciling the word to himself so will christ have to be have to be not maybe so not a hope so but christ has to be in the church and he says the anointed word to make everything fulfilled to make everything fulfilled how are we going to fulfill scripture for this day the anointed word coming on the inside of some young people inside of the bride and fulfilling everything that god has for this day john 14 12 very verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also the greater works than these shall he do then he stops and he says because i go under my father all right and that you know i that just hit me yesterday when i was reading that he says the same works that i do you're going to do the greater works brother branham says not greater but more of and he says because i go to my father somebody's got to pronounce the word is alive somebody's got to show that god is on earth still i'm going to my father but i'm giving you an authority to produce the same life that i got you can produce somebody's going to be an example of the power of god [Music] somebody's going to be an example the enemy is coming in like a flood but god has raised up some young people and is proclaiming that god is alive another quote remember we are now as his bride impregnated with this spirit oh my the church bearing children seen impregnated by his spirit with his name eric his life bearing forth signs of his life evidence with the preeminent evidence of his resurrection showing that he's not dead but he's alive forevermore this is eternal life vindicated vindicates to the world that we're alive in him he goes whoa vindicating to the world that we're alive in him he's alive in us which is a great union show it to the devil you make up the baptist you may get the methodists you make up the pentecostals but god has raised up a standard in this last day that you can't touch you know but the brandon says that eve love believed in a god but she disbelieved one word and the same word that eve disbelieved this second eve is going to believe and she's going to produce the word no but it says in another place that god took six years to create a to create paradise to create eden and the devil had e fall in the middle of his eden and now the devil has taken 6 000 years to create his paradise to create his eden and god has another eve but she's not going to fall like she did in the beginning but she's going to rise and i believe you're a part of that church that bride that's rising in power rising in authority rising in dominion you're producing the word for this day that's why we get excited and shout and rejoice because we're seeing the scriptural prophecies being fulfilled in our lives look at on the day of pentecost there was scriptures prophesied for that day then this then they came under the holy ghost and they came out staggering like drunk men and somebody asked him are y'all drunk what's wrong with y'all and peter says now we're not drunk but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel he started to produce the words for that day that's why he couldn't help but get excited he started to manifest the word it wasn't a passing emotion but it was a reality that anchored his soul you don't got to get a passing emotion the the the denominations has been on passing emotions for years but this bride ain't on a passing emotion but she's got a reality and is producing the words brother branham says but by god he's here god's vindicated revelation made plain to them he's speaking of the 120 in the upper room they was happy about it god promised it here it was revealed to them vindicated to them amen here was the man standing there saying this is that and there it was being vindicated by the same signs the same signs the scripture spoke of they was producing and the same thing is happening today we see the word of promise being vindicated through our lives there's a bride that's come under scripture prophecies and the things we've been waiting on we're now producing you look at the woman at the well she was waiting for a messiah and jesus came and was talking to her and she was looking for someone to come she was looking for signs to come she was looking for an authority to come but then the same things she was waiting on jesus started to manifest but you noticed he needed somebody to manifest that through you know the story i'm talking about and she asked him i perceive you're a prophet for when the messiah comes he will do these things and he stopped and he says i am he but you notice what she says she ran and says come see a man who has told me me everything i done so the things she was waiting on was being manifested through her life did you catch that she was waiting for these things to come she was waiting for christ to come waiting for the messiah to come and when he came she was mad he was manifesting his power and authority through her life and she became an example she ran to the city brother branham says that she wasn't even allowed to be around the around the men she wasn't she wasn't allowed to go into the city around the people but then all of a sudden the people that shunned her was now believing her what happened she had become an example of the power that they was waiting on [Music] you get on fire with this message you'll become an example but what the world is waiting on they're wanting a living god they're wanting something with power they're wanting something to stabilize the soul and they're trying drugs they're trying alcohol they're trying this and that but there's nothing to stabilize the thirst but there's an example right here in the middle of hardy arkansas that can show the world that it's not in drugs it's not an alcohol but it's in the reality of jesus christ there's an example god has lifted up a standard and proclaiming to the world look what he's done in me [Music] come see a man who has told me all that i have ever done yes yes yes you look hope this is okay i'll close here in a minute but you look at moses i know i keep going back to moses but moses under inspiration says let there be flies let there be frogs let there be lives brother branham says if that was moses speaking his own words god didn't have to vindicate him he didn't have to back it up but he says but god gave his thoughts and moses was speaking god's thoughts so god was obligated to back it up but you notice god wasn't obligated just for moses but he was obligated for everybody under moses it wasn't just moses that went through the red sea i preached them this morning it wasn't it's not going to be just the prophet see the body changed it's not going to be just the preachers see a rapture it's not going to be just the adults see the rapture but there's some examples some young people under the message that is going to see the same things yes sir so you look you see you look at miriam miriam had seen moses called lies called frogs and caught turned water in the in the in the blood but it was never really personally to her because the taskmasters were still beating her she was still in bondage moses had the supernatural and that was wonderful but she wanted to see the supernatural for herself oh my but once she got across the red sea it wasn't just moses with the supernatural it wasn't just moses fulfilling the words but she turned around and seen the taskmaster the beater day after day month after month year after year it was no longer just moses with this authority but the same authority that moses had she was manifesting the egyptians that she's seen year after year were now dead the same authority that moses had miriam was experiencing the same authority that the preachers have you young people can experience the same authority that brother branham had you young people can experience you can speak to your mountain and doubt not to have to be removed you speak to your circumstance you speak to that addiction you speak it that authority is not just in the prophet but it's inside of young people under the message and then the children of israel became standards because you notice whenever they got into jericho what did rahab say what did rayam say she said the men's hearts were affected when we heard what john did to the egyptians oh they become standards he wasn't they wasn't just looking at the power of god but they had somebody to look to and say god through you destroyed the egyptians god through you split the red sea gone through you destroyed the giants they have become the examples oh hallelujah and i believe there's somebody here that the world can't just look at the prophet or look the preachers or or look through some uh some imagination but now they're looking at some vessels and say my goodness how are you doing it hallelujah how are you not bound to smoking how are you not bound to drinking how are you not laughing at these dirty jokes how are you wearing your skirts young ladies how are you wearing your lone care how are you you're now looking as an example not just gods but now they can see somebody that's what this message come to do to bring god out of the eternal realms so that some young people can now walk as christ walked on earth that the world can look at a living god in your skins out of living god through your skins and living god in your skins and you can say oh yes come see a man come see god he touched me and he can touch you i'm a standard i'm a standard i'm a standard of what god's power can do and he can do it for you as well one more last point before i close you look at david i know these are the simple examples but you look at david david was a little nobody a young person ready nothing for his stature but god called him for a special purpose but you notice that he wasn't just called but he was anointed he wasn't just anointed but his purpose was given to him on the back side of the door with the sheep samuel came up to him gave him a message and says you're going to reign as king but he didn't just give him a message but then he anointed him with oil so now he has the anointing to fulfill his purpose and so whenever he was coming to the to the battleground and goliath was making his big boast he was saying i defy the armies of the living god if there's somebody here that can destroy me let him come up and fight me but you notice there was bigger guys than david there were stronger guys than david there was more capable men from the natural life than david but they weren't anointed they didn't have a message telling them they were going to survive they didn't know if they were going to survive or not all they knew was that was a big goliath and he's going to destroy me but david was saying that's a big goliath but i've got a message saying i'm going to reign as king there's no goliath there's no bear there's no lion there's nothing that's going to keep me from fulfilling my purpose so he was a standard he was an example he was going up and he was like why are you hiding in the caves why y'all in your stance ain't this the army of the living god but you notice it takes the word to produce a living army they were dead they were dead while they lived the bible says that this day there's women that's dead why they live what's that they're dead in their sins even though they're alive but that's another subject but this this army was dead but david wasn't dead he was alive by revelation he had been anointed and the message proclaimed his purpose and so he ran up to goliath it says today i'm going to take your head off i don't care how big you are how bad you are how strong you are how much of a warrior you are you notice that david was a very young boy and that goliath was on earth a lot longer than david was just like you or some young people and the devil's been on earth a lot longer than you have he's got more experience than you that's why you needed somebody to tell you how to defeat the devil which was the message of the hour and so david says i'm going to take your head off he took but the random says he took five stones and found it with his five fingers faith in jesus and he slung that stone and i brought down the goliath but you know there's too many people stop right there too many times we come to church and we get a victory you know we get a victory god touches our life but we go home the same david david was going to make sure that that glass wasn't going to get back up too many times we come to church come to a youth meeting come to a youth camp knock the devil down we get back home we do cpr on it and bring that devil back to life in your life and you're still bound you're still addicted you're still in your your jail cell but david was going to make sure that this goliath wasn't going to bother him no longer there was an authority because of a message that was given by a prophet and let me say there's an authority inside of your lives where you don't got to go and stroke with addictions no more you're not gonna go back and those old devils plague your mind no longer what you need to do is draw your sword draw your sword david said nah this goliath has been plaguing us too long i'm taking the sword i'm anointed i've been given a message and i'm going to kept that devil's head off this morning you're anointed you've been given a message draw your sword and cuddle pornography turn off addictions turtle complexes anxiety whatever it is there's an authority inside of your life as the musicians come somebody's going to be an example but the story don't just stop there david turned around and he says hey guys i know you haven't experienced what i've experienced he picks up the head and says look i did it i know it looks impossible it looks impossible to live an overcoming life it looks impossible to live a life above complexes and anxiety it looks impossible guys but look i did it you can do it too and the bible says the children of israel seen what david done and got courage they seen a living god inside of a living young person and they realized if david can do it i can do it too and young people i did it you can do it too the same god that california my life can get a hold of your life the same message that gave me an authority can give you an authority i did it brother andrew did it this is a young man that's been four times since he was 16. god did it for him god can do it for you dad's been pastoring since he was 19 preaching since he was 13 14 god did it for him god can do it for you you may not be a preacher but god can get a hold of your life and the same authority that brother andrew gots that brother wendell gods brother ben gotch is the same authority that you can have in your let's life our heads this morning can notice something soft praise the lord dear heavenly father we love you lord this is what you placed upon my heart father and lord made these young people realize that they're not just wannabes they're not just hope so's but this message has raised them up above the world they've got the advantage lord the pentecostals the denominations would love to be where they're at right now they will love the opportunity to live a life above sin but lord you've given these young people the opportunity and lord made they realize that you've given them something special lord may they get into the message for themselves may they get into these tapes for themselves not just mama's revelation or dad's revelation or the pastor's revelation but may they get a revelation for themselves lord we ask these things in your precious name amen we've got no excuse this i was recently in czech republic and they told me that they've only got 300 tapes in their language my mind and that destruct me so we got every sermon on tape in our language it just hit me what am i doing with the message there's no excuses what are you doing with the message you may say i'm only 12. i'm only 13. that don't matter david was a young boy samuel was a young boy it don't matter the age but god needs some dedicated young people inside of this message that's listening to the tapes studying for ourselves it's the only way it's going to produce the rapturing faith is on the inside of this message but brother branham says rapturing faith is on the inside of these tapes hearing comes by the word our faith cometh by the word of god so let's get into this message amen let's all stand go and sing brother his power in the name of jesus there is
