[52:28] i'll try not to get too close to you but
[52:31] the lord's still good isn't he he's good
[52:34] all the time now
[52:36] i wanted to tell you thank you for your
[52:37] mission offering a couple weeks ago
[52:39] about brother jason demars we were able
[52:41] to give him two thousand dollars to go
[52:44] towards what they do is they pay
[52:47] help pay the rent for some of the
[52:48] churches over there that's where that
[52:50] money goes and so that's
[52:51] some of the money be given for that and
[52:53] they just come out of the mission fund
[52:54] we didn't take a special offering
[52:56] but i appreciate you giving to missions
[52:58] and you've done that
[53:00] faithfully over the years and we
[53:01] appreciate that very much
[53:03] so that money will go to that and we'll
[53:05] try to support him on a more regular
[53:07] basis and then some other
[53:09] brothers as well that are spreading the
[53:11] gospel
[53:12] the bible says when the gospel of this
[53:14] kingdom has been preached in every
[53:15] nation then the end will come
[53:17] so we're almost there i believe that so
[53:21] uh we're going to i want you to pray
[53:23] also for brother allen today brother
[53:24] gregory's preaching for them today and
[53:26] i'm
[53:27] glad that our young ministers can get
[53:28] out and preach but we miss with alan
[53:31] and his family when they're not here so
[53:33] be praying for him
[53:34] on the roads today and then my
[53:36] grandmother as brother david said is
[53:38] very sick
[53:39] she's taking a turn for the worse they
[53:41] call they've allowed the family to come
[53:42] in and i want to
[53:43] commend the doctors for that it's a very
[53:45] humane thing to do
[53:47] to let the my mother i just got a
[53:49] picture before i
[53:50] left the office that she's all uh robed
[53:53] up and they have to wear double masks
[53:55] and things in there but they are
[53:57] able to see her and to touch her and
[53:59] thank god for that because i know
[54:01] others that have passed on without
[54:04] without that and it's a terrible thing
[54:07] not be able to see your relatives so she
[54:09] was able to do that
[54:11] but if the lord doesn't intervene i
[54:13] don't know what'll happen there but
[54:15] we're trusting that god will
[54:17] and but she's 89 years old and she's
[54:19] ready to go and so we
[54:20] we thank god for that but you just be
[54:22] praying for my family in that situation
[54:25] and i'm sure every one of you have needs
[54:27] as well
[54:28] we'll be praying for um i know on
[54:31] tuesday nights
[54:32] i didn't write this down but on tuesday
[54:34] nights brother darrell ward has been
[54:36] kind of
[54:36] organizing a prayer meeting they're
[54:38] going to do that again this tuesday
[54:40] night at seven o'clock
[54:41] our time so if you have time to if
[54:43] you're at home and you're able to do
[54:45] that
[54:45] that would be a good time to pray for
[54:47] the needs of the church or the bride
[54:49] here in the united states and overseas
[54:51] where this colvin thing has been so
[54:53] such a hard thing and it looks like it's
[54:55] letting up it looks like we're coming
[54:56] out of it and
[54:57] so grateful for that so grateful that
[55:00] god has blessed us like he has to bring
[55:02] some of you out of that and and we're
[55:04] grateful for that today now
[55:06] we're going to make a little change to
[55:07] the service so i want you to listen
[55:10] actually i guess it don't matter because
[55:11] you'd just be here early but
[55:14] the service times we're going to change
[55:15] the service time on sunday morning to 10
[55:17] 30 instead of 10 o'clock so on sunday
[55:21] morning at 10
[55:22] 30 and that means sunday school start at
[55:23] 10 15
[55:25] instead of 9 45 so everybody heard that
[55:28] 10 30 and i'll try to remind you
[55:30] and the reason for that is so many of
[55:32] you are driving and you're not able to
[55:34] be here
[55:35] early enough some of i know some of the
[55:36] kids it's hard to get them in sunday
[55:38] school
[55:39] at 9 45 and so we're going to try to do
[55:42] it at 10
[55:42] 30 on sunday mornings and we'll still be
[55:44] out around noon most sundays
[55:46] and floor will help me to do that and uh
[55:49] but that'll give you a little bit more
[55:51] of a chance i think and
[55:53] help a little bit and we'll try that now
[55:56] so 10 30 on sunday mornings no change to
[55:58] our wednesday service
[56:00] but once a month we'll have two services
[56:03] on sunday
[56:04] i want to try to have a dinner in
[56:06] between that service so once a month
[56:08] we're going to try to do it on the first
[56:10] sunday of every month and the the first
[56:12] time
[56:12] we're going to do that is march 7th and
[56:14] we'll remind you that we'll also have
[56:16] communion foot washing that day
[56:18] so we'll have two services on march 7th
[56:20] at 10 30
[56:21] and 3 o'clock so we'll be able to stay
[56:25] for that and eat if you want to and and
[56:28] i i hope that will help you in some way
[56:31] and uh
[56:32] we i just want as many of you to be here
[56:34] and be as comfortable as you can be
[56:36] and i know if we try to make it as
[56:38] comfortable as we can but you're not
[56:40] here for the pews or the
[56:41] the seats or or the decorations and i'm
[56:44] so thankful for what sister vicki and my
[56:46] wife and different ones work but mainly
[56:47] sister vicky brother danny
[56:49] worked on and brother mark helped as
[56:50] well on this foyer and so they've made
[56:52] that look really nice but
[56:54] but that's not why you're here you're
[56:56] here because of you want to worship
[56:58] god and you're here because you want to
[57:01] hear the word and so
[57:02] we want to still make that the focus of
[57:05] what we do and so anything we can do to
[57:07] make you
[57:07] help you to be here and and be able to
[57:10] be on time is
[57:11] is what we're going to try to do you
[57:13] love the lord this morning
[57:15] amen remember that 10 30 on sunday
[57:17] morning so you'll be early if you show
[57:18] up at the
[57:19] normal time and i'm okay with that but
[57:22] it we're going to change to 10 30.
[57:24] lord willing acts chapter 26 verse 13
[57:26] let's stand together
[57:29] i told you i was going to begin to get
[57:32] into this
[57:34] absolute i've just been really soaking
[57:35] in the sermons brother branham preached
[57:38] on that
[57:39] and so i want you to think with me today
[57:41] and and
[57:42] pray with me and as we go through this i
[57:46] want to
[57:47] just take a part of that sermon but not
[57:49] just
[57:50] just take what brother branham's
[57:51] preached but kind of
[57:53] really dig into it and what the absolute
[57:56] means to us and what it means to to meet
[58:00] that absolute and i want to talk this
[58:01] morning on
[58:02] an absolute experience an absolute
[58:06] experience which may sound like a
[58:07] paradox because
[58:09] we know we don't go just by experience
[58:12] but there is an experience that you can
[58:14] have
[58:15] that can become an absolute in your life
[58:18] and that experience
[58:19] is meeting christ the word
[58:23] if you meet him that becomes an absolute
[58:26] in your life
[58:27] and that's what we want to talk about
[58:28] this morning acts chapter 26 and verse
[58:31] 13
[58:32] at midday o king i saw in the way of
[58:34] light
[58:35] from heaven above the brightness of the
[58:37] sun shining round about me and them
[58:39] which journeyed with me
[58:42] when we were all fallen to the earth i
[58:43] heard a voice speaking unto me and
[58:45] saying in the hebrew tongue
[58:47] also i persecuted thou me
[58:50] it was hard for thee to kick against the
[58:52] pricks
[58:53] and i said who art thou lord and he said
[58:56] i am jesus whom thou persecutest
[59:00] rise and stand upon thy feet for i have
[59:02] appeared unto thee for this purpose
[59:04] to make thee a minister and a witness
[59:06] both of these things which thou has seen
[59:08] and of those things in the which i will
[59:10] appear unto thee
[59:12] delivering thee from the people and from
[59:14] the gentiles unto whom now i
[59:16] send thee to open their eyes to turn
[59:18] them from darkness to light
[59:20] aren't you glad he did that for you from
[59:23] the power of satan unto god that they
[59:24] may receive forgiveness of sins
[59:27] an inheritance among them which are
[59:29] sanctified by faith
[59:31] that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i
[59:34] was not disobedient unto the heavenly
[59:36] vision
[59:38] but showed first unto them of damascus
[59:40] in that jerusalem and throughout all
[59:41] the coasts of judea and then to the
[59:43] gentiles that they should repent and
[59:45] turn to god
[59:47] and do works meet for repentance
[59:51] let's approach the lord one more time
[59:52] heavenly father
[59:54] we've been giving these announcements
[59:55] for a little bit but we thank you for
[59:57] your presence this morning
[59:58] we felt in the song service and we
[1:00:01] believe you're still here with us
[1:00:02] and we ask you to just come and anoint
[1:00:04] your word as only you can we pray in
[1:00:06] jesus name
[1:00:08] amen you can be seated
[1:00:12] the word absolute from webster's
[1:00:14] dictionary is
[1:00:16] free independent of anything extraneous
[1:00:20] and that's what it literally means is
[1:00:22] freedom
[1:00:23] freedom and it's complete in itself
[1:00:28] it's positive and absolute declaration
[1:00:31] unconditional that's an absolute promise
[1:00:35] existing independent of any other cause
[1:00:38] as god is absolute unlimited by
[1:00:41] extraneous power or control
[1:00:43] as an absolute government or prince
[1:00:47] not relative as absolute space so in
[1:00:50] other words it's not
[1:00:51] it exists by itself it's not relative to
[1:00:53] anything else existing
[1:00:56] there's only been one thing in history
[1:00:58] that ever brother david existed by
[1:01:00] itself
[1:01:01] without anything else
[1:01:04] and that is elohim
[1:01:08] who is the self-existing one
[1:01:11] right he is the the absolute
[1:01:14] literally the absolute in that sense
[1:01:16] that nothing
[1:01:18] it takes nothing for him to live it
[1:01:21] takes nothing for him to exist
[1:01:23] he didn't have to have anything to be
[1:01:27] you it's hard for you to even imagine
[1:01:30] for me to even imagine a
[1:01:32] a power like that an ability like that
[1:01:35] that took nothing and needed nothing
[1:01:38] and yet came down and that absolute
[1:01:42] poured himself out into a body of flesh
[1:01:45] become a baby
[1:01:48] you can imagine and needed everything
[1:01:52] that's god
[1:01:56] but it's hard to even wrap our minds
[1:01:57] around that but that would be the only
[1:01:59] thing that you could really say is
[1:02:01] is absolute human beings cannot be an
[1:02:04] absolute
[1:02:05] in their flesh it's
[1:02:08] literally impossible because it takes
[1:02:12] something for me to live
[1:02:14] right for me to be here today so many
[1:02:16] other people had to do
[1:02:18] so many other things my parents had to
[1:02:21] get together and we talked about how
[1:02:22] what the odds are of you being you and
[1:02:25] going back so many different generations
[1:02:27] what what that would be and
[1:02:29] it took a lot of things for you to be
[1:02:31] here it takes
[1:02:33] something for you to live somebody's got
[1:02:34] to work somewhere as a farmer
[1:02:36] farming produce and things out of the
[1:02:38] ground for you to have food
[1:02:41] for me to have food somebody's got to
[1:02:43] run a fire department somebody's got to
[1:02:44] run a police department somebody's got
[1:02:46] to
[1:02:46] serve in the military there's so many
[1:02:48] things that it takes for us to have this
[1:02:50] american life
[1:02:52] but god is not dependent on any of those
[1:02:54] things
[1:02:55] right so an absolute would be something
[1:02:57] that's not dependent on
[1:02:58] on flesh it can't be dependent on
[1:03:02] flesh because if it's dependent on flesh
[1:03:03] it's literally not an absolute
[1:03:06] right and but we know then that the
[1:03:08] absolute as i said last sunday
[1:03:10] is what god says
[1:03:13] right because anything that comes out of
[1:03:14] god as an absolutely never has a second
[1:03:16] thought
[1:03:17] he never had he never has to rethink it
[1:03:18] and think oh i was wrong about that
[1:03:20] but everything that he ever said oh i
[1:03:23] feel his presence here this morning
[1:03:25] everything that he ever said is just
[1:03:27] saith the lord
[1:03:29] it's the absolute right whatever god
[1:03:32] says and however he says it
[1:03:34] the voice of god if you put it that way
[1:03:36] what god says it's the absolute
[1:03:39] so human beings can have the absolute
[1:03:42] but not be the absolute
[1:03:45] does that make sense you can have the
[1:03:48] absolute
[1:03:49] but not be the absolute this is the
[1:03:51] absolute word of god
[1:03:52] i have it but i'm not it as a pastor i'm
[1:03:56] not the absolute even though i have
[1:03:58] in some ways the final say in the church
[1:04:00] but i'm not the absolute
[1:04:02] right and even in that the churches when
[1:04:05] i say that
[1:04:06] i have the final say in the church
[1:04:07] unless the church voted me out
[1:04:10] right so i'm not even absolute in that i
[1:04:13] i couldn't just stay here regardless
[1:04:16] right and so none of us are absolute
[1:04:18] we're all dependent on something
[1:04:21] right and so but the absolute exists
[1:04:24] independent of everything else
[1:04:26] and that is the word of god thus saith
[1:04:29] the lord nothing
[1:04:30] nothing can change it it'll go for its
[1:04:32] purpose he said i'm the god that healeth
[1:04:35] thee that's an absolute
[1:04:37] right it's exactly what he said it was
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:44] now and so human beings are subject to
[1:04:46] circumstance james 4 13
[1:04:48] says go to now you that say today or
[1:04:51] tomorrow we will go into such a city and
[1:04:52] continue there a year and buy and sell
[1:04:54] and get gain
[1:04:56] so in other words you're planning ahead
[1:04:57] your business life and
[1:04:59] what you're going to do he said whereas
[1:05:01] you know not what you'll be on tomorrow
[1:05:04] for what is your life it is even a vapor
[1:05:07] that appeareth for a little time and
[1:05:08] then vanish at the way
[1:05:10] there's no absolute in human life
[1:05:13] there's no absolute of that if you make
[1:05:15] your absolute enjoyment or pleasure or
[1:05:17] happiness
[1:05:19] there's no absolute in that right
[1:05:22] because what makes you happy today may
[1:05:23] not make you happy tomorrow
[1:05:26] and someone said what what what do you
[1:05:27] as we talked about what do you want but
[1:05:29] i don't mean to repeat myself i'm sorry
[1:05:31] about that but sometimes you preach in
[1:05:33] the same place
[1:05:34] day week after week you repeat yourself
[1:05:36] a little bit
[1:05:37] but what do you want well i want to be
[1:05:40] happy well that's that can't be your
[1:05:41] absolute
[1:05:43] because i'm happy when i eat
[1:05:46] and if i just just want to be happy just
[1:05:48] go by that i'd be 600 pounds
[1:05:51] i mean that can't be my absolute there
[1:05:54] has to be more than that than just being
[1:05:56] happy
[1:05:57] but he said you ought to say if the lord
[1:05:58] will we shall live
[1:06:02] and so just we may not even be alive he
[1:06:04] says to be able to make those plans that
[1:06:06] the lord will we shall live and do this
[1:06:07] or that
[1:06:10] we don't know what tomorrow holds
[1:06:14] and so an absolute if you think about it
[1:06:16] like that an absolute
[1:06:18] human being would be deity in flesh
[1:06:23] and that's why i say that we could have
[1:06:24] the absolute but not be the absolute
[1:06:26] because
[1:06:27] every one of us are given a measure of
[1:06:28] the gift of faith every one of us have a
[1:06:31] measure of christ
[1:06:32] we have christ as brother brown says in
[1:06:34] measure but
[1:06:35] but jesus christ himself was without
[1:06:37] measure
[1:06:39] right he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:06:41] bodily
[1:06:43] so we could say that he was absolute
[1:06:46] because he was
[1:06:47] the word so jesus never did say anything
[1:06:50] that was wrong
[1:06:52] nothing he never did get in the flesh
[1:06:58] you think about that that's almost hard
[1:07:00] to wrap your mind around as
[1:07:02] as someone existing on their own right
[1:07:05] jesus never had to apologize to the
[1:07:07] to the disciples for getting in the
[1:07:09] flesh
[1:07:10] i've told you before that jesus went and
[1:07:13] used the whip but i'd like to see you do
[1:07:15] that without getting
[1:07:16] angry in the flesh
[1:07:19] right jesus got angry and didn't sin
[1:07:23] not one bit right he did not sin
[1:07:29] that's how we know that you know we know
[1:07:30] he got sick but he didn't sin
[1:07:33] he was subject to all the temptations
[1:07:35] but he didn't see it he never did
[1:07:38] amen and that absolute is in you
[1:07:42] right which can keep you from every sin
[1:07:46] but the flesh is the center always will
[1:07:49] be
[1:07:50] one day it'll be changed aren't you glad
[1:07:52] for that one day we're going to walk out
[1:07:54] of here but it's always going to be
[1:07:55] the moment you go in the rapture your
[1:07:57] flesh will still be a sinner
[1:08:02] and it's changed and then it's not a
[1:08:04] sinner no more
[1:08:05] but you have a body amen that's worthy
[1:08:08] of that absolute that's on the inside
[1:08:12] amen now so
[1:08:15] i want you to kind of hold that thought
[1:08:17] so that's the only thing that could be
[1:08:18] absolute is the word now
[1:08:20] would would be the word is god
[1:08:24] now brother brown says the word absolute
[1:08:27] is an ultimate
[1:08:28] he said therefore i think that everybody
[1:08:30] should have an ultimate
[1:08:32] and every great achievement that's ever
[1:08:34] been achieved
[1:08:35] there's been an absolute behind him no
[1:08:38] matter what it was it's had an absolute
[1:08:40] behind it
[1:08:41] and every person in order to achieve
[1:08:43] something has to first have
[1:08:46] that the absolute he said you've got
[1:08:49] something you have to tie to in other
[1:08:52] words it's the final
[1:08:54] tying post to every achievement
[1:09:00] and you think of a typo something you
[1:09:01] tie down to and i know around here
[1:09:03] there's a lot of trailer homes
[1:09:05] well you have to tie them down right
[1:09:08] when you get one you got to pull it up
[1:09:09] there and you got to tie them down
[1:09:11] because otherwise it's going to flip
[1:09:13] over it's going to blow away
[1:09:15] wind gets underneath it's going to blow
[1:09:16] away so you time down to the ground
[1:09:19] you take a horse back in the old days
[1:09:20] they take a horse and tie it to a
[1:09:22] hitching post
[1:09:23] it's got to be tied to something solid
[1:09:25] if the hitching post is movable the
[1:09:27] horse can go
[1:09:29] it'll just take it with it so it's got
[1:09:31] to be something solid a boat
[1:09:32] has to tie up on the shore to something
[1:09:35] that's solid
[1:09:36] wave's not going to carry it away it's
[1:09:38] got to be something solid
[1:09:40] and brother branham says it's the final
[1:09:42] tying post to every achievement
[1:09:44] he said it's somewhere it might wind
[1:09:46] through many different things
[1:09:48] till it gets to that thai post but
[1:09:51] there is the amen to all of it
[1:09:55] so you might have experiences you might
[1:09:58] have
[1:09:59] you might have church entity you might
[1:10:01] have been raised in the message but
[1:10:03] you wind through all of those things
[1:10:05] until one day
[1:10:07] you get an absolute it catches on
[1:10:10] something that won't move because if you
[1:10:13] catch my spirit that'll move if you put
[1:10:16] your confidence in me that'll move
[1:10:19] right you put your confidence in the
[1:10:20] person you sit beside of the pew that'll
[1:10:22] move a husband a wife whoever it might
[1:10:24] be
[1:10:24] but if you ever get your confidence in
[1:10:26] that absolute
[1:10:27] he won't move
[1:10:30] so he said it'll wind through many
[1:10:32] different things till it gets to that
[1:10:34] typos
[1:10:34] but there is the amen to all of it there
[1:10:36] must be such a thing
[1:10:38] there must be such a thing he said you
[1:10:41] cannot go on through life
[1:10:43] without having one amen
[1:10:49] now but the right answer to achievement
[1:10:51] anyone
[1:10:52] achieved anything if you achieve
[1:10:54] something
[1:10:55] you look at what are my achievements
[1:10:56] well that would be my life in christ the
[1:10:59] life that i now live
[1:11:00] how did i get here because i met an
[1:11:03] absolute
[1:11:05] something there's something in my life
[1:11:06] to tie to and the reason you have to
[1:11:09] have that is because of the presence of
[1:11:10] evil
[1:11:11] paul said if i would when i would do
[1:11:13] good evil is present
[1:11:15] i have the flesh and the flesh my own
[1:11:18] heart even is deceitful there's got to
[1:11:20] be something greater than my heart
[1:11:22] the bible tells us if if your heart
[1:11:24] condemns you there's one greater than
[1:11:26] your heart
[1:11:28] right and so there's got to be something
[1:11:30] you can tie to that's greater
[1:11:32] than just well i i believe the message
[1:11:36] is true i
[1:11:37] i went to church and i felt good but
[1:11:40] there's got to be a reality to that
[1:11:43] that you know that no matter what comes
[1:11:46] you're going to stand
[1:11:49] amen now acts 23 11.
[1:11:54] says the night following or actually
[1:11:56] this is written about paul the night
[1:11:57] following the lord stood by him
[1:11:59] and said be of good cheer paul for as
[1:12:02] thou has testified of me in jerusalem
[1:12:05] so must thou bear witness also
[1:12:09] at rome now
[1:12:12] it was a long journey to rome there
[1:12:15] would be evil president on the journey
[1:12:17] there would be shipwreck snake bite
[1:12:21] that's quite a journey paul had to rome
[1:12:24] but he had an absolute that held him on
[1:12:27] the journey
[1:12:29] and you have an outfit that holds you on
[1:12:31] the journey of life
[1:12:32] because there's lots of obstacles in
[1:12:34] your way your family may become an
[1:12:36] obstacle your
[1:12:37] your spouse may even become an obstacle
[1:12:39] here your church may at times be an
[1:12:41] obstacle
[1:12:42] even the south phoenician woman come to
[1:12:44] jesus and jesus himself
[1:12:46] was an obstacle to her because he said
[1:12:49] it's not me
[1:12:50] for me to take the children's bread and
[1:12:51] give it to dogs
[1:12:53] but she said that's true lord but the
[1:12:56] dogs eat the crumbs to fall from the
[1:12:57] masters table
[1:12:58] why because she found her absolute
[1:13:01] she was going to believe what he said no
[1:13:03] matter what
[1:13:05] even if her feelings were hurt and so
[1:13:07] paul
[1:13:08] said he said told paul he said you're
[1:13:09] going to bear witness with me at romans
[1:13:10] so no matter what paul went through from
[1:13:12] that moment on
[1:13:13] he had an absolute he was held by
[1:13:16] something through his life
[1:13:18] philippians 1 and 20 and these are
[1:13:20] scriptures where the random uses in the
[1:13:22] absolute sermons
[1:13:23] he says according to my earnest
[1:13:25] expectation and my hope
[1:13:27] that in nothing i shall be ashamed but
[1:13:30] that with all boldness has always
[1:13:32] so now also christ should be magnified
[1:13:34] in my body
[1:13:35] whether it be by life or by death
[1:13:39] he was absolutely sure but glenn that it
[1:13:41] was going to happen
[1:13:43] he was absolutely sure of heaven
[1:13:46] i don't believe we have to equivocate on
[1:13:48] that
[1:13:49] i think we can be absolutely sure of
[1:13:51] where we're going
[1:13:54] absolutely sure he says i have fought a
[1:13:57] good fight
[1:13:59] i've kept the faith henceforth there's
[1:14:00] laid up for me a crown
[1:14:03] amen not to me only but also to those
[1:14:05] who
[1:14:06] who welcome his appearing he says he
[1:14:09] says death
[1:14:09] where is your sting go read the writings
[1:14:12] of paul he's not sitting there saying
[1:14:14] well i hope i make it
[1:14:15] by the skin of my teeth maybe i'll make
[1:14:17] it maybe i'll if i could just stay
[1:14:20] man but i'm doing so many things that
[1:14:21] are wrong but if i could if i could just
[1:14:23] feel like i feel in church
[1:14:24] no he said he said death where's your
[1:14:27] sting it's been taken away
[1:14:29] he can stand in the face of death and
[1:14:31] mock death
[1:14:34] amen death where is your sting he says
[1:14:37] for me to live is christ
[1:14:39] to die his cane amen
[1:14:43] amen he says i am not ashamed of the
[1:14:45] gospel of jesus christ
[1:14:48] go read the writings of paul he doesn't
[1:14:49] approach it with timidity
[1:14:51] he approaches it with boldness but the
[1:14:53] jt is saying i know
[1:14:55] whom i have believed amen and i'm
[1:14:58] persuaded
[1:14:59] that he's able to keep that which i've
[1:15:01] committed unto him against that day
[1:15:03] i know that's my absolute
[1:15:07] amen you see that's why it's so
[1:15:09] important to teach our children the
[1:15:10] scripture
[1:15:12] because there'll come a day maybe
[1:15:13] they'll go back and forth and they'll
[1:15:14] they'll try to tie their knot to
[1:15:16] different things
[1:15:17] relationships and churches and different
[1:15:19] things but one day
[1:15:21] they'll realize there's something they
[1:15:22] had in their life and if they can ever
[1:15:24] meet
[1:15:25] the word the person of the word then all
[1:15:28] of a sudden that scripture becomes alive
[1:15:29] that they learned as a child
[1:15:31] that scripture that they learn all of a
[1:15:33] sudden they that scripture anchors in
[1:15:35] their heart
[1:15:36] and i know my redeemer lives i know that
[1:15:40] i've i'm persuaded he's able to keep me
[1:15:44] becomes the absolute in their lives when
[1:15:47] the word is the abstinent in your life
[1:15:49] you don't equivocate about it you don't
[1:15:50] you don't go back and forth and and
[1:15:52] mealy mouthed and wonder
[1:15:54] well should i do this no the word is
[1:15:56] true it's always true
[1:15:59] amen regardless of what i do regardless
[1:16:02] if i get sick the word still he
[1:16:04] says the lord heal is i'm the god that
[1:16:06] healeth all
[1:16:07] thy diseases
[1:16:10] no matter what it says it's still there
[1:16:13] no matter what you go through when you
[1:16:14] get in the lowest moment of your life at
[1:16:16] the very end of the end
[1:16:17] of all your expectations in life all
[1:16:19] your dreams are shattered all your hopes
[1:16:21] are gone and you get at that moment in
[1:16:23] your life and you recognize
[1:16:24] i know i still know that he's god
[1:16:28] i still know he's the same yesterday
[1:16:29] today and forever i may be on my best
[1:16:31] bed but i know
[1:16:32] in whom i have believed you don't get
[1:16:35] that by education
[1:16:36] you don't get that by good feeling you
[1:16:38] get that because you met christ
[1:16:42] amen he was absolutely sure
[1:16:47] because he had met the person of the
[1:16:48] word
[1:16:50] brother branham uses the example of
[1:16:51] marriage in the absolute
[1:16:53] he said you when you got married there
[1:16:55] had to wind back through your mind
[1:16:56] something until you hit that type post
[1:17:00] he said it should have been love for
[1:17:02] your wife
[1:17:03] or your husband
[1:17:07] i ask people all the time who having
[1:17:09] trouble why did you get married
[1:17:11] there has to be a reason why did you get
[1:17:15] married
[1:17:16] well i loved them well that should have
[1:17:20] been a type post
[1:17:21] if you loved them in the correct way
[1:17:23] that don't change
[1:17:26] now you may fall out of out of like with
[1:17:29] them
[1:17:30] you may not like everything they do but
[1:17:32] your love don't change
[1:17:34] some of you have lost your spouse you
[1:17:36] know that
[1:17:37] love doesn't leave you just because you
[1:17:39] lost your spouse
[1:17:42] love doesn't leave you you're still
[1:17:43] still there
[1:17:46] it's there with you it's a type post
[1:17:49] he said well maybe she isn't as pretty
[1:17:51] as john's wife or
[1:17:52] she well she not this that you shouldn't
[1:17:56] express those thoughts out loud by the
[1:17:57] way
[1:18:02] he said but he said there's something
[1:18:05] about you
[1:18:06] about her that it strikes you he didn't
[1:18:09] say she strikes you
[1:18:11] it strikes you
[1:18:14] you might not be as pretty as the other
[1:18:15] he might not be as handsome as the other
[1:18:18] but there has to be an absolute there
[1:18:22] that that person is different
[1:18:27] and there's where you hold on to he said
[1:18:30] if that isn't there
[1:18:31] you better not get married that typos
[1:18:35] that absolute
[1:18:37] so that's a good illustration now
[1:18:39] brother branham then uses three
[1:18:41] bible examples he uses first job
[1:18:44] and job knew that he had made a
[1:18:45] sacrifice and that was an absolute in
[1:18:48] his life
[1:18:50] brother brother says oh in time of
[1:18:51] sickness if we could only tie ourselves
[1:18:54] to that absolute
[1:18:55] amen job know that he had done jehovah's
[1:18:58] bidding
[1:18:59] amen and he had faith in what he had
[1:19:02] done because jehovah required it
[1:19:04] he said we can just do that jehovah
[1:19:06] required a burnt offering for his sin
[1:19:09] and job not only for himself but for his
[1:19:11] children had made a burnt offering
[1:19:14] and that's all god required oh he said
[1:19:17] you might say i wish that's all he
[1:19:18] required today
[1:19:20] listen what he says he said it's less
[1:19:22] than that
[1:19:25] amen you don't even have to get wood
[1:19:27] together
[1:19:29] are you with me now you don't even have
[1:19:31] to drag an ox or a sheep or lamb or
[1:19:34] whatever
[1:19:34] to the altar and cut his throat and
[1:19:37] build an altar what do you have to do
[1:19:38] believe
[1:19:40] because the sacrifice has already been
[1:19:41] made he said it's less than that just
[1:19:44] faith in his word
[1:19:45] and you if you make his word you're
[1:19:47] absolute you can
[1:19:49] he said any divine promise in the bible
[1:19:51] you can tie your soul to it
[1:19:53] no matter how much the waves whip you
[1:19:55] around you're still tied
[1:19:56] you're absolute amen
[1:19:59] it's an absolute now
[1:20:02] he still had to come to a place of
[1:20:05] absolute
[1:20:07] but the rhino said then when he come to
[1:20:10] the spot
[1:20:11] now watch and i want you to get this
[1:20:14] because each one of these
[1:20:16] these examples brother brown uses goes
[1:20:18] to a
[1:20:19] a timeline where they believe god
[1:20:22] but then they come to a place where
[1:20:23] they're sure
[1:20:25] and so it's like but the verb says that
[1:20:26] absolute winds through until it
[1:20:29] catches hold of something and job does
[1:20:32] that he believes god he's made his
[1:20:33] sacrifice he trusts that that's
[1:20:35] for him but there's still something that
[1:20:37] he needs
[1:20:39] and so he said when he come to the spot
[1:20:41] when the absolute hell
[1:20:43] he said finally he began to feel the
[1:20:45] strain
[1:20:46] tighten up he said that had been running
[1:20:49] loose
[1:20:50] bouncing around but it began to tighten
[1:20:53] up
[1:20:55] and you begin to see in someone's life
[1:20:57] when the absolute tightens up to the
[1:20:59] word
[1:21:01] right because immediately they begin to
[1:21:03] just naturally live the word it's not a
[1:21:06] forced
[1:21:06] thing you don't have to yell at them all
[1:21:08] the time but the absolute hell but
[1:21:10] howard it's there
[1:21:12] it grabs hold of something and
[1:21:15] when that absolute hit job he said the
[1:21:18] spirit come on him he stood up being a
[1:21:20] prophet he said i know
[1:21:21] my redeemer liveth look how sure he is i
[1:21:24] know my redeemer liveth
[1:21:26] he said he had tightened up to his
[1:21:28] absolute
[1:21:30] that's interesting language brother i'm
[1:21:31] using this now because so many times we
[1:21:33] get to
[1:21:34] we get to thinking well i had this
[1:21:36] experience i was saved and
[1:21:38] then i was sanctified and then i was
[1:21:39] filled with the holy ghost but you
[1:21:40] realize that
[1:21:42] every every day we need to tighten up to
[1:21:44] the absolute
[1:21:46] your experience with god doesn't end
[1:21:48] because you had an experience with god
[1:21:51] but it just begins so you have to come
[1:21:54] in contact with that absolutely you've
[1:21:56] got to pull up to it
[1:21:58] not because he would leave you but
[1:22:01] because you you would grieve him away
[1:22:03] i would grieve him away just by everyday
[1:22:05] living so what do you do you tighten up
[1:22:07] to it
[1:22:09] he said he come in contact he knew that
[1:22:11] he had done what was right
[1:22:12] and someday he had to pull to it
[1:22:16] he said how long does that take well it
[1:22:17] takes the rest of our lives
[1:22:19] because someday we're going to pull
[1:22:21] through the scripture with a joke that
[1:22:22] says they'll not sleep but they'll all
[1:22:25] be changed
[1:22:26] i'm not all asleep but they'll all be
[1:22:28] changed someday it's got to pull to that
[1:22:30] absolute word
[1:22:31] that promised in the moment in a
[1:22:33] twinkling of an eye that's going to take
[1:22:35] place
[1:22:36] so until that happens we just constantly
[1:22:39] pulling
[1:22:39] pulling that string gets tighter and
[1:22:41] tighter until it finally grabs hold of
[1:22:43] that
[1:22:44] and our body changes and yet we have an
[1:22:46] absolute now
[1:22:47] but we're tightening up to it now
[1:22:50] he said he'd come in contact he knew
[1:22:54] he'd done what was right someday he had
[1:22:56] to pull two he said i know my redeemer
[1:22:57] liveth
[1:22:59] stays he stands upon this after the skin
[1:23:02] worms destroy this body
[1:23:04] and in my flesh shall i see god he knew
[1:23:07] then
[1:23:08] in his absolute anchored
[1:23:13] and job could say in job 42 5 i have
[1:23:15] heard of thee
[1:23:17] by the hearing of the year but now
[1:23:22] that's the place we need to reach church
[1:23:25] i've heard of thee but now
[1:23:29] they don't have to pet me anymore i'm
[1:23:32] not a hotbed plant
[1:23:33] now mine i see at thee
[1:23:37] i have seen christ
[1:23:41] he said can a man say that he has to say
[1:23:43] that
[1:23:45] can a woman say that she has to say that
[1:23:48] i've heard of thee
[1:23:49] by the hearing of the ear but now mine i
[1:23:52] seeth thee
[1:23:53] i know amen and it's not that it's not
[1:23:57] faith because you know by the eyes of
[1:23:59] faith
[1:24:02] it's not that it's not faith it's still
[1:24:04] faith but
[1:24:05] faith is not a movable thing out there
[1:24:08] somewhere
[1:24:08] faith is the substance
[1:24:12] of things hoped for that's what brother
[1:24:14] brown calls perfect faith it's when you
[1:24:16] move beyond
[1:24:17] i believe to i know
[1:24:21] i know and don't get confused in your
[1:24:25] flesh now because your flesh will never
[1:24:26] know
[1:24:28] if you could keep consulting the flesh
[1:24:29] it's going to keep telling you to do the
[1:24:31] wrong thing
[1:24:33] right every day you wake up flesh what
[1:24:36] do you want to do
[1:24:37] well i want to eat drink and be merry
[1:24:42] i want to sleep as long as i can i want
[1:24:45] to eat as much food as i can
[1:24:47] i want to skip church as much as i can
[1:24:50] that's what the flesh wants to do
[1:24:52] right every day you wake up and if you
[1:24:54] keep consulting him well
[1:24:56] flesh do you want to be you have an
[1:24:58] absolute oh no i
[1:24:59] i don't know what i believe
[1:25:02] but there's something on the inside that
[1:25:04] regardless of what the flesh says i have
[1:25:06] heard of thee
[1:25:07] by the hearing of the ear but now might
[1:25:09] i see it the i know
[1:25:11] my redeemer lives amen
[1:25:16] not depending on what the flesh says
[1:25:20] genesis well let's let's go back to what
[1:25:23] brother brown said again but the brandon
[1:25:24] introduces abraham as having an absolute
[1:25:26] and abraham had heard the voice of god
[1:25:29] you know he come out of his out from the
[1:25:32] place where he was from ur the chaldees
[1:25:34] and
[1:25:35] and he brings his father with him for a
[1:25:36] while finally he gets rid of his father
[1:25:39] if you could say it that way god didn't
[1:25:41] call his father called abraham
[1:25:44] all right and so finally he goes a
[1:25:45] little farther and he got lot with him
[1:25:47] and finally lot left him the rest of the
[1:25:51] lot was always a hair in the biscuit
[1:25:53] it's a very graphic way of putting it
[1:25:57] that's that's almost traumatic to me i
[1:25:59] mean that's
[1:26:01] hair in the biscuit is a traumatic thing
[1:26:03] that's a good waste of a good biscuit
[1:26:08] but abraham had heard the voice of god
[1:26:09] but there come a day he had to have
[1:26:11] something more
[1:26:14] now the bible said he said when his
[1:26:16] obituary was written he said abraham
[1:26:18] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:26:20] through unbelief
[1:26:20] but was strong giving praise to god he
[1:26:23] said why did you ever think
[1:26:25] he was absolute positive the only thing
[1:26:28] he had to do
[1:26:30] was separate himself from his people and
[1:26:32] god never did bless him until he did it
[1:26:36] said he took his daddy his daddy died he
[1:26:38] took lot went after a lot separated from
[1:26:40] abraham
[1:26:40] then god come to him and said now walk
[1:26:42] through the land
[1:26:44] so you see the same thing he's
[1:26:45] tightening up to his absolute genesis
[1:26:47] chapter 15 and verse 1
[1:26:49] after these things the word of the lord
[1:26:50] came unto abram after what things
[1:26:52] read genesis 14 after what things after
[1:26:55] lot
[1:26:58] he finally was done with lot after these
[1:27:01] things the word of the lord came into
[1:27:03] abram and a vision saying fear not abram
[1:27:05] i am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:27:08] reward
[1:27:10] and abram asked a good question he he
[1:27:12] said
[1:27:13] lord god whereby shall i know
[1:27:19] how can i have an absolute how can i
[1:27:21] know
[1:27:22] that i shall inherit it he'd been
[1:27:24] confessing it for years
[1:27:27] he'd been believing it for years he'd
[1:27:30] been following the voice of the word for
[1:27:31] years
[1:27:32] but he said whereby shall i know
[1:27:35] and god said now notice what he didn't
[1:27:38] do he didn't come to abram and say okay
[1:27:39] now i'm going to
[1:27:40] give you a teaching seminar and i'm
[1:27:41] going to show you every little thing
[1:27:43] about what's going to happen to you no
[1:27:46] he said
[1:27:47] take a heifer and a goat
[1:27:52] and a ram and a turtle dove and a young
[1:27:55] pigeon
[1:27:56] he said abraham you're about to have an
[1:27:58] experience
[1:28:00] and you got to get ready for it
[1:28:04] so he makes the sacrifice pulls them all
[1:28:06] up there and cuts them all up and
[1:28:09] tears them asunder puts the parts out
[1:28:12] there on the on the altars
[1:28:14] and so he says take each one of those
[1:28:15] things in that next verse
[1:28:19] and he took unto him all these and
[1:28:21] divided them in the midst and each piece
[1:28:22] once again one against another
[1:28:24] but the birds divided he not and so he's
[1:28:27] got it all prepared
[1:28:28] just the way that it should be
[1:28:31] and verse took unto him all these
[1:28:34] divided
[1:28:35] peace against one another but the birds
[1:28:36] divided he not verse 11 when the fouls
[1:28:39] came down upon the carcasses abram drove
[1:28:40] them away
[1:28:42] because the birds are going to come
[1:28:46] to try to keep you from your experience
[1:28:49] the demons out of hell are going to come
[1:28:51] down and try to keep you from having an
[1:28:53] experience with god
[1:28:56] but you can't give yourself an
[1:28:57] experience all you can do is stand there
[1:28:59] by the sacrifice and show them away
[1:29:02] right those birds of doubt those demons
[1:29:05] of depression and fear and all those
[1:29:06] things come down and they tried to
[1:29:08] they tried to settle down on the
[1:29:09] sacrifice but abraham
[1:29:12] drove them away and it came to pass when
[1:29:15] the sun went down
[1:29:16] and it was dark verse 17 and you can go
[1:29:19] and read the rest of it there
[1:29:20] how he put him to sleep and all of that
[1:29:23] but he said when it was dark
[1:29:24] behold a smoking furnace and a burning
[1:29:27] lamp that passed between those pieces
[1:29:29] what happened the pillar of fire the
[1:29:31] shekinah glory of god come down
[1:29:35] and made a covenant hallelujah
[1:29:38] amen oh don't you realize that's what
[1:29:40] happens every time you come to an altar
[1:29:42] every time you give your heart to god
[1:29:44] you stand there in just the pieces of
[1:29:45] yourself and god comes down
[1:29:48] and he anoints that he anoints that
[1:29:50] according to his word it has to be
[1:29:52] an experience of meeting god abraham
[1:29:56] met god he never did say how can how
[1:29:57] will i know
[1:29:59] again it was abraham's absolute moses
[1:30:05] the runaway servant prophet god had
[1:30:08] raised him up and educated him in
[1:30:09] pharaoh's palace are you still with me
[1:30:11] this morning
[1:30:13] moses went out with this theological
[1:30:16] training
[1:30:17] he said was the first man he slew he
[1:30:20] said then the first little defect come
[1:30:21] along
[1:30:22] and moses was scared to death
[1:30:25] why because he had no absolute
[1:30:30] what he says he only had his mother's
[1:30:31] testimony of his birth
[1:30:35] well you were born in the message you
[1:30:37] were raised on a church pew you're
[1:30:38] you're predestined
[1:30:42] moses said praise the lord i'm going to
[1:30:43] go out and preach
[1:30:47] in his very first sermon he killed an
[1:30:49] egyptian boom
[1:30:52] gonna solder them all you know how a
[1:30:55] young preacher does so many times you go
[1:30:56] out there and you just
[1:30:57] you're just gonna solder them you're
[1:30:58] gonna you're gonna take them down
[1:31:02] going to preach against every sin known
[1:31:03] to man and he didn't he killed an
[1:31:04] egyptian
[1:31:05] then realized the people got mad
[1:31:09] well what am i going to do now
[1:31:12] he had no absolute he said he was a
[1:31:15] strange child he had his mother's word
[1:31:17] about it
[1:31:17] he had the scrolls that god had perhaps
[1:31:19] in paper somewhere they had written
[1:31:21] packed along with them
[1:31:22] that god was going to visit his children
[1:31:24] so he had that promise he knew
[1:31:27] that that was the time very bad
[1:31:30] he said like we do now we
[1:31:33] know something is fixing to happen you
[1:31:36] don't have to have very spiritual eyes
[1:31:37] today church to know
[1:31:39] that something's about to take place
[1:31:43] we know that he was chosen for it but he
[1:31:45] didn't have an absolute
[1:31:50] now he says one day on the back side of
[1:31:53] the desert
[1:31:54] when he had lost the vision god appeared
[1:31:56] to him in a burning bush
[1:31:58] he said moses i've seen the afflictions
[1:32:01] of my people
[1:32:02] i've heard their groans and crying those
[1:32:04] taskmasters punishing them
[1:32:07] and i have remembered my promise i've
[1:32:10] come down to deliver them
[1:32:11] now go down to egypt i said moses
[1:32:14] complaining saying i don't speak very
[1:32:16] well
[1:32:17] my deliverance or my delivery is not
[1:32:19] very not very good
[1:32:20] i can empathize with moses here my
[1:32:23] delivery is not very good i don't speak
[1:32:24] very well they won't believe me
[1:32:26] he said what's in your hand he said a
[1:32:28] stick
[1:32:30] hey ben hey man what's in your hand a
[1:32:33] stick
[1:32:34] he said throw it down it turned to a
[1:32:35] serpent said pick it up by the tail and
[1:32:37] turn back again to a stick
[1:32:38] he was giving him the assurance of
[1:32:40] vindication
[1:32:42] now listen to this it's very important
[1:32:44] when god gives an absolute
[1:32:46] he gives the vindication to that
[1:32:48] absolute always
[1:32:53] always and that's why we've talked about
[1:32:56] two people can come to the altar both of
[1:32:58] them cry
[1:32:59] both of them have tears both of them you
[1:33:00] feel the presence of god around both of
[1:33:02] them
[1:33:02] both of them feel the presence of god
[1:33:04] there one get up and change man the
[1:33:06] other one
[1:33:06] does the same things he always did
[1:33:09] there's no vindication
[1:33:11] when god gives an absolute he gives the
[1:33:14] vindication of that absent always
[1:33:17] and what is the vindication it's the
[1:33:19] life that's lived after
[1:33:22] right it's a life that's lived after now
[1:33:23] a prophet would have a peculiar
[1:33:24] vindication
[1:33:25] but the vindication to us is the life we
[1:33:27] live after we meet the absolute
[1:33:30] right that's the vindication to the
[1:33:32] world he said then moses when he was
[1:33:33] down there he threw down his stick
[1:33:34] before the magicians
[1:33:36] and pharaoh and the magicians coming
[1:33:37] through down their stick too moses never
[1:33:39] ran and said oh well i was wrong
[1:33:41] oh it's just a cheap magician trick
[1:33:43] maybe i was wrong
[1:33:45] but he knew very bad he was positive
[1:33:48] that he met god and he stood still
[1:33:51] amen he said let's say you've done
[1:33:53] exactly what god told him to do
[1:33:55] he said so job done exactly what god
[1:33:56] told him to do moses said follow his
[1:33:58] commandments then stand still and watch
[1:34:00] the glory of god
[1:34:02] you can't ever have any assurance if you
[1:34:04] don't do what god says
[1:34:05] because that's the absolute right if
[1:34:08] you're just not doing the basics of it
[1:34:09] if you know
[1:34:10] and that's why people sometimes are so
[1:34:12] embarrassed when they come to church and
[1:34:13] feel so bad but you don't have to feel
[1:34:15] that way just do what god says
[1:34:17] he said but you don't understand what i
[1:34:18] have been doing just speak the word of
[1:34:21] god over that
[1:34:23] and repent of that and go on how long
[1:34:26] does it take to be forgiven that
[1:34:28] long as long as it takes you to say he
[1:34:30] already knew it
[1:34:31] he wanted to hear you confess it
[1:34:35] and get right back with the absolute
[1:34:36] don't stay down there in that
[1:34:39] wallow in it moses was tied to his
[1:34:41] absolute
[1:34:42] sure he made mistakes but he was tied to
[1:34:44] his absolute his commission
[1:34:45] and he stood still when he did his
[1:34:47] serpent swallowed up the rest of the
[1:34:48] serpents
[1:34:49] he said see he was tied to that absolute
[1:34:53] amen he met god
[1:34:57] he said well if i'd seen the pillar of
[1:34:58] fire in a burning bush
[1:35:00] i believe that too i'd do that too that
[1:35:03] same pillar of fire is still here
[1:35:08] that pillar of fire is in this building
[1:35:10] this morning
[1:35:12] he said well that's a that's a hard
[1:35:14] statement to say
[1:35:15] listen what a prophet said he said
[1:35:16] you're in his presence now
[1:35:19] he is here he is absolutely here the
[1:35:22] great holy spirit
[1:35:23] he said that pillar of fire that was
[1:35:26] with moses is right
[1:35:28] here now you say well brother branham
[1:35:31] had it he was right there with brother
[1:35:32] branham oh wait
[1:35:33] branham tells us you can go find the
[1:35:35] quote i didn't get it but you can find
[1:35:36] it
[1:35:37] but brother brown said that that pillar
[1:35:38] of fire followed paul all the days of
[1:35:40] his life
[1:35:43] i don't it didn't just stay with him
[1:35:45] when he was when it was visible
[1:35:47] are you with me what is the pillar of
[1:35:49] fire the pillar of fire is the visible
[1:35:52] form of god called the logos
[1:35:56] right it's the logos it's the word of
[1:35:58] god
[1:36:00] right you can see it now that pillar of
[1:36:03] fire whether you can see it or not see
[1:36:05] it physically with physical eyes it's
[1:36:06] there
[1:36:08] if the holy spirit is with you what is
[1:36:09] the holy spirit's christ
[1:36:12] the life of christ if you have the holy
[1:36:13] spirit you have the pillar of fire
[1:36:16] otherwise you make them two separate
[1:36:17] things right you've got two different
[1:36:20] gods
[1:36:21] so he said that pillar of pharaoh that
[1:36:22] was with moses is right here
[1:36:24] hebrews 11 26 we're told that
[1:36:27] moses esteemed the reproach of christ
[1:36:29] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:36:30] egypt
[1:36:31] for he had respect and the recompense of
[1:36:33] the reward the reproach of christ
[1:36:35] brother brown said was christ then as
[1:36:38] the angel of the covenant
[1:36:40] that logos that pillar of fire that was
[1:36:41] christ he went in the wilderness he said
[1:36:44] with christ
[1:36:45] and any bible reader knows that the
[1:36:47] pillar of fire was the angel of the
[1:36:48] covenant
[1:36:49] the logos that went out of god which was
[1:36:50] jesus
[1:36:52] and when he died he ascended up into
[1:36:54] heaven and when he met saul on the road
[1:36:55] to damascus
[1:36:56] he had done turned back to the pillar of
[1:36:58] fire again and
[1:37:00] even put paul's eyes out with brightness
[1:37:03] now if we make the pillar of fire it's
[1:37:04] only being with brother branham and i do
[1:37:06] recognize the exclusivity of
[1:37:09] that sign for that ministry are you with
[1:37:13] me now that it was only given to one man
[1:37:16] i don't have to have it it's picture
[1:37:18] taken with me we've already had it
[1:37:19] vindicated
[1:37:20] it's already been done that's been given
[1:37:23] to our age we don't have to have it
[1:37:24] again
[1:37:25] but i'm so grateful that we had it
[1:37:27] aren't you and i don't say you couldn't
[1:37:29] see the pillar of fire just say it was
[1:37:31] that was a sign for him for his message
[1:37:35] you understand but now and it showed
[1:37:37] that the same god that brought the word
[1:37:39] to moses
[1:37:40] brought the word to paul was with us in
[1:37:42] our day not to bring a new bible but to
[1:37:45] but to as we said do the replay to show
[1:37:47] us to confirm
[1:37:49] that what we had was right and to bring
[1:37:52] out the revelation of it now
[1:37:54] brother branham says when he said now
[1:37:57] he's here tonight the same yesterday
[1:37:59] today and forever
[1:38:00] he's here tonight the same yesterday and
[1:38:02] forever
[1:38:03] and then in another quote where the
[1:38:04] brown says now if that pillar of fire is
[1:38:06] right if it's here
[1:38:07] it'll do the same works that he did
[1:38:10] because it's the same nature
[1:38:13] you say what is the absolute well you
[1:38:14] had to meet the pillar of fire
[1:38:17] that makes sense i don't mean you'll see
[1:38:19] it with your physical eyes but you've
[1:38:20] got to meet
[1:38:21] the logos the word because what else
[1:38:24] could be absolutely
[1:38:25] that's what existed by itself
[1:38:29] you got to meet more than a preacher you
[1:38:31] got to meet more than than even a
[1:38:33] a message because just the message by
[1:38:35] itself a
[1:38:36] dead letter you got to be more than just
[1:38:37] this bible because this bible is the
[1:38:40] logos
[1:38:40] in print but you got to meet him
[1:38:44] right or this bible can't become real to
[1:38:46] you you can't live it in this day
[1:38:49] unless you met him amen it'll do the
[1:38:52] same works that he did because it's the
[1:38:54] same
[1:38:54] nature hallelujah now
[1:38:58] are you with me now paul met that pillar
[1:39:02] of fire
[1:39:03] that was this absolute now remember
[1:39:06] brother brown said he was a scholar
[1:39:08] beforehand he was a mighty man of the
[1:39:10] scriptures
[1:39:12] but he didn't have any type post but the
[1:39:15] sanhedrin that would back him up
[1:39:17] and a diploma from a great teacher and
[1:39:19] preachers today make a sanhedrin they
[1:39:21] a group of preachers they can get around
[1:39:23] they all agree with one another and that
[1:39:24] oh
[1:39:24] yeah i can go to my group of preachers
[1:39:26] and they all say hey man to me and so i
[1:39:28] know that i got the absolute no
[1:39:30] you've got to meet god for yourself not
[1:39:33] in a group of sanhedrin a group of
[1:39:35] preachers that's all paul had
[1:39:36] was a group of preachers that would back
[1:39:38] him up a diploma from a great teacher
[1:39:41] he was a great man in his field but he
[1:39:42] was waiting only thing he had his
[1:39:44] absolute
[1:39:45] would only be as strong as his
[1:39:47] organization was
[1:39:49] so church if we if we become
[1:39:52] organizational we become get a
[1:39:54] denominational mindset where
[1:39:55] we just fellowship with certain people
[1:39:57] and and we have this little clique that
[1:39:59] we
[1:39:59] get around and we all agree with one
[1:40:01] another then our absolute is only as
[1:40:03] strong as they are
[1:40:06] we don't want that that's all the
[1:40:09] stronger he could be with
[1:40:10] the sanhedrin but i'm so glad for a
[1:40:12] strength that goes beyond that aren't
[1:40:14] you
[1:40:16] what was it paul had an experience with
[1:40:18] god on the road to damascus one day
[1:40:21] all of a sudden a light shone round
[1:40:22] about him and knocked him off his horse
[1:40:26] amen began to speak to him and he said
[1:40:29] who are you lord
[1:40:30] amen who are you lord because brother
[1:40:32] brother said he recognized that pillar
[1:40:34] of fire
[1:40:34] had to be god who are you lord he said
[1:40:37] i'm jesus
[1:40:38] who thou persecuted us it's hard for you
[1:40:40] to kick against the pricks
[1:40:42] hey man have become his absolute every
[1:40:45] time he got in a tight spot brother said
[1:40:46] he come back to that experience
[1:40:51] brother branham says how the nation how
[1:40:52] the christian world this morning
[1:40:54] needs that type of absolute he said
[1:40:57] those who'd creates and traditions that
[1:40:59] tried to withdraw the men to disqualify
[1:41:02] god's word to being the same yesterday
[1:41:03] today and forever
[1:41:04] he said they need an absolute an
[1:41:07] experience of meaning
[1:41:09] on a damascus road amen the living god
[1:41:12] who can heal the sick you believe that
[1:41:14] today
[1:41:15] amen they need an experience of meeting
[1:41:17] on a damascus throat
[1:41:18] the living of god who can heal the sick
[1:41:19] and raise the dead and cast out devils
[1:41:21] a genuine absolute you've got it from a
[1:41:23] historical standpoint but may be able to
[1:41:25] explain all these things
[1:41:26] but if you haven't got an absolute
[1:41:28] haven't got an experience
[1:41:29] and if that experience that you claim
[1:41:31] you have makes you to not deny that
[1:41:33] every word of this isn't just as true
[1:41:35] to the church today as it ever was
[1:41:38] now now hang with me he said you have to
[1:41:41] have an experience but that experience
[1:41:42] got to go back to the word
[1:41:46] if that experience caused you to deny
[1:41:48] that every word of this isn't just as
[1:41:50] true to the church today as it ever was
[1:41:52] and you're trusting upon your bachelor
[1:41:54] of art degree or whatever you might have
[1:41:57] if you're trusting upon the thoughts of
[1:41:58] your organization
[1:42:00] that would say the days of miracles has
[1:42:02] passed we have no divine healing
[1:42:06] and the baptism of the holy spirit like
[1:42:07] they received on the day of pentecost is
[1:42:09] not for the people today
[1:42:11] he said if that's all you got my
[1:42:12] precious brother and sister you need a
[1:42:14] damascus road experience
[1:42:17] amen hallelujah
[1:42:21] do you believe it today i'm
[1:42:25] i need to quiet down a little bit my
[1:42:28] wife told me today she said you're
[1:42:30] you're sick don't get excited he said
[1:42:32] just get up there and talk
[1:42:34] i have a hard time doing that
[1:42:37] hey man if that's all you got you need a
[1:42:40] damascus road experience
[1:42:42] you need to meet this living god amen
[1:42:45] are you struggling today do you not know
[1:42:47] which way to come in go out
[1:42:48] sure the flesh will struggle but are you
[1:42:50] struggling in your soul
[1:42:52] you don't know what's right what's not
[1:42:53] right you need this living god
[1:42:56] hey man you need to meet this living god
[1:42:58] where you not only just a mythical
[1:43:00] thought in your mind
[1:43:01] not some shiver some kind of a sensation
[1:43:04] but a taut he said an experience
[1:43:06] of a real genuine the same jesus that
[1:43:09] walked
[1:43:10] in galilee is living today alive
[1:43:12] forevermore do you believe that today
[1:43:15] hallelujah and he's the same yesterday
[1:43:17] today and forever
[1:43:19] and absolute that you don't have to take
[1:43:20] what anyone said
[1:43:22] you know for yourself not some sensation
[1:43:26] amen hey man now listen brother henry
[1:43:29] says here
[1:43:30] and i'm closing in just a moment he said
[1:43:32] if the sensation that you've had
[1:43:34] he said somebody he said it might have
[1:43:35] been a real bible sensation
[1:43:38] now brother bruno changed me he said
[1:43:39] it's not some sensation but maybe you
[1:43:41] had a sensation
[1:43:43] that was a real bible sensation
[1:43:46] remember they had a sensation on the in
[1:43:48] the upper room they staggered out like
[1:43:50] drunk men
[1:43:51] sure they did they spoke at other times
[1:43:54] they did those things
[1:43:55] there they had a sensation but it's not
[1:43:58] a certain sensation it just
[1:44:00] when that kind of power comes down on a
[1:44:02] human being what's it going to do
[1:44:04] amen but now look he said if that
[1:44:07] sensation you've had
[1:44:09] somebody it may have been a real bible
[1:44:10] sensation and somebody tried to explain
[1:44:13] away from you
[1:44:14] saying those things were in some other
[1:44:16] day be careful
[1:44:18] that's what they're saying it's for
[1:44:19] somebody some other day be careful he
[1:44:21] said it is true be careful
[1:44:23] but there is a way to know test it with
[1:44:26] the word
[1:44:29] amen so i'll accept any sensation that
[1:44:32] goes back to the word
[1:44:34] i'm not gonna make fun of somebody for
[1:44:35] crying or speaking in tongues or running
[1:44:37] or shouting whatever it is
[1:44:38] if it goes back to the word if there's a
[1:44:40] vindication behind it you see a life
[1:44:42] changed
[1:44:44] are you with me now he said that's the
[1:44:47] blueprint if the house goes up contrary
[1:44:49] to the blueprint
[1:44:50] the contractor will tear it down rebuild
[1:44:51] it but it's got to go to the blueprint
[1:44:53] no matter what your experience is then
[1:44:55] if something in you
[1:44:56] listen tells you that the bible isn't
[1:44:58] true
[1:44:59] that power of god apostles prophets and
[1:45:02] teachers and pastors
[1:45:04] and the gifts of the spirit just isn't
[1:45:05] the same
[1:45:08] i wish i could hammer that today because
[1:45:10] that cessation doctrine comes in
[1:45:12] in churches even with pastors and and
[1:45:14] people who don't believe in preachers
[1:45:16] that cessation doctrine
[1:45:17] where you put it all back some other age
[1:45:19] he said but if something in you tells
[1:45:21] you
[1:45:21] that the bible isn't true that the power
[1:45:23] of god apostles prophets teachers and
[1:45:25] pastors
[1:45:26] and the gifts of the spirit just isn't
[1:45:28] the same as it was
[1:45:30] when it flowed through them apostles at
[1:45:31] pentecost there's something wrong with
[1:45:33] your absolute
[1:45:37] oh god help us today
[1:45:40] it has to tie to a denominational creed
[1:45:43] instead of to god's bible
[1:45:45] watch what people do when they believe
[1:45:47] something they say well i believe that
[1:45:49] there's no preachers anymore i believe
[1:45:50] there's no gifts anymore the spirit of
[1:45:52] god
[1:45:53] you say by the men we don't hardly ever
[1:45:55] see speaking in tongues you believe in
[1:45:57] speaking in tongues absolutely how could
[1:45:58] i not
[1:46:00] that's in the bible we don't see a lot
[1:46:03] of prophecy in the church well
[1:46:05] number one i think we see more than you
[1:46:07] realize
[1:46:08] but you take that and think you know
[1:46:11] things happen and sometimes we don't
[1:46:12] recognize god moving but
[1:46:14] do i believe in it absolutely because if
[1:46:17] i don't believe in that how do i stand
[1:46:18] up here as a minister
[1:46:20] i can't separate the nine spiritual
[1:46:21] gifts from the five ministerial gifts
[1:46:24] right you can't separate those two and
[1:46:26] if you do away with one you've got to do
[1:46:27] away with the other
[1:46:29] right you're doing away with all of it
[1:46:31] what you've done you watch somebody
[1:46:33] that'll preach that they'll take you to
[1:46:34] a creed well so and so said
[1:46:38] brother so-and-so said that that this
[1:46:40] this is past we don't do that no more
[1:46:43] but what does the bible say
[1:46:47] it has to tie to the denominational
[1:46:48] creed instead of god's bible when he
[1:46:50] said both heavens and earth will pass
[1:46:51] away but my word shall never fail
[1:46:54] he said watch what your absolute is
[1:46:57] amen watch what your absolute is
[1:47:01] now watch why your absolute has to be a
[1:47:05] person what person did they meet
[1:47:06] they met the person of elohim the
[1:47:09] absolute manifested in the logos the
[1:47:11] pillar of fire
[1:47:12] john 1 1 said in the beginning was the
[1:47:14] word the word was with god and the word
[1:47:15] was god
[1:47:16] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:47:18] all things were made by him without him
[1:47:20] was not anything made that was made that
[1:47:21] was an absolute
[1:47:23] right all that god was he poured into
[1:47:25] christ
[1:47:27] yeah verse 14 says the word was made
[1:47:30] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:47:31] we beheld its glory the glorious of the
[1:47:33] only begotten of the father
[1:47:35] full of grace and truth we beheld it we
[1:47:38] met the absolute
[1:47:40] and they met christ first corinthians 15
[1:47:43] 3 for i delivered unto you first of all
[1:47:45] that which i also received
[1:47:49] i'm not going to be able to finish all
[1:47:50] this musicians come
[1:47:52] we got more services so i delivered unto
[1:47:56] you first of all that which i also
[1:47:58] received now that christ died for our
[1:47:59] sins
[1:48:00] according to the scriptures and that he
[1:48:02] was buried that he rose again the third
[1:48:04] day according to the scriptures that he
[1:48:06] was seen as cephas then of the twelve
[1:48:08] after that he was seen of above 500
[1:48:10] brethren at once
[1:48:11] of whom the greater part remain unto
[1:48:13] this present but some are falling asleep
[1:48:16] after that he was seen of james said of
[1:48:17] all the apostles he's running down
[1:48:19] a history of the people that saw a
[1:48:21] resurrected christ
[1:48:24] he was seen of james and of all the
[1:48:26] apostles and last of all he was seen of
[1:48:28] me also
[1:48:30] as of one born out of due time
[1:48:33] and i love that because he wasn't born
[1:48:36] with all the others but that word if you
[1:48:37] go research it one point out of due time
[1:48:39] it's like one born prematurely one born
[1:48:42] traumatically
[1:48:43] he didn't bring himself into the message
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:47] he was born amen by the word of god
[1:48:50] hallelujah he says i last of all he
[1:48:54] would see to me also what does that mean
[1:48:55] i
[1:48:56] saw him just as much as they saw him
[1:48:59] even though i didn't see him in the
[1:49:00] flesh
[1:49:01] amen he said for i am the least of all
[1:49:03] the apostles that i'm not meant to be
[1:49:04] called an apostle
[1:49:05] because i persecuted the church of god
[1:49:08] but by the grace of god
[1:49:10] amen i think we can all stand on this
[1:49:12] today
[1:49:13] by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:49:16] amen could you stand with me today by
[1:49:19] the grace of god i am what i am
[1:49:21] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:49:23] was not in vain there was a vindication
[1:49:25] that followed the absolute
[1:49:27] but i labored more abundantly than they
[1:49:29] all yet not i but the grace of god which
[1:49:31] was with me
[1:49:33] amen could you bow your heads with me
[1:49:34] today by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:49:38] oh if we could just think of how far he
[1:49:41] brought us
[1:49:43] how deep we were in sin how how much
[1:49:46] paul had persecuted the church
[1:49:48] he had his own ideas he had his
[1:49:50] sanhedrin for an absolute
[1:49:52] but there come a time there come a day
[1:49:54] when he met christ
[1:49:56] and when he met christ everything
[1:49:58] changed
[1:49:59] and on those sacred sands brother adam
