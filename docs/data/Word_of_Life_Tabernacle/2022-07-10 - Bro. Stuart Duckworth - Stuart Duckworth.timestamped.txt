[47:49] good success
[47:51] been over there
[47:53] had to preach many services i sure
[47:55] wouldn't want to want to be in their
[47:57] their place but i believe god god used
[47:59] them amen god laid it on their heart to
[48:01] be there and that that's what they've
[48:02] done
[48:03] and you don't just go somewhere like
[48:05] that just to be going
[48:07] and so
[48:08] you pray god but just give them an easy
[48:11] trip back home and and give them rest in
[48:13] their bodies because i'm sure they're
[48:14] they're going to need it amen
[48:17] amen and i'm looking forward to hearing
[48:19] all about
[48:20] what took place
[48:22] amen if we could we'll turn the
[48:23] scriptures this morning to hebrews the
[48:26] 9th chapter
[48:27] the 13th verse
[48:29] we spoke on this thought before the
[48:31] power of the testator just want to kind
[48:33] of continue with it just a little bit
[48:34] here
[48:39] hey man we love the lord
[48:42] amen we love his word amen
[48:44] i mean y'all probably won't have to see
[48:46] me for a little while so this will be it
[48:49] this will be it maybe for just a little
[48:51] while
[48:52] i mean looking forward to some good
[48:53] preaching coming in and amen just
[48:55] certainly anticipating amen the things
[48:57] that are coming
[48:59] amen hebrews 9 13.
[49:02] for the blood of bulls and goats and the
[49:04] ashes on heifers sprinkling the unclean
[49:07] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[49:09] flesh
[49:10] how much more shall the blood of christ
[49:13] who through the eternal spirit offered
[49:15] himself without spot to god
[49:18] purge your conscience from dead works to
[49:20] serve the living god
[49:22] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[49:25] the new testament that by means of death
[49:28] for the redemption of the transgressions
[49:30] that were under the first testament
[49:32] they which are called might receive the
[49:34] promise of eternal inheritance
[49:37] for where a testament is there must also
[49:40] of necessity be the death of the
[49:42] testator for a testament is of
[49:46] for a testament is a force after men are
[49:48] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[49:50] all while the testator liveth amen there
[49:53] in the 18th verse whereupon neither the
[49:55] first test testament was dedicated
[49:57] without blood so the first one was
[50:00] dedicated with blood and so the second
[50:03] one also was dedicated with blood amen
[50:06] you can be seated this morning
[50:10] amen we'll just try to
[50:13] try to preach a little bit this morning
[50:16] and then try to try to hang on to our
[50:18] voice for a little bit as long as we can
[50:22] hey man i just i just want to enter in
[50:24] this morning i just want to enter into
[50:26] his presence amen
[50:28] amen and to be able amen to be able to
[50:32] partake
[50:33] in the things of christ and the eternal
[50:35] inheritance i mean we've got to enter in
[50:38] i mean you can't just sit on the
[50:39] sidelines and amen you've got to enter
[50:42] in god's provided way
[50:44] amen and that's by the blood of christ
[50:47] how much more this blood
[50:50] if that blood would would purge and make
[50:52] clean and god would accept that how much
[50:54] more this blood if we can come through
[50:57] his blood and then you have to come you
[50:59] have to come by faith
[51:01] to be able to receive something to be
[51:03] able to come to god you've got to come
[51:05] by faith you can't come any other way
[51:08] amen you've got to come you've got to
[51:09] come with a revelation with an
[51:11] understanding and and know what you're
[51:13] doing know know how to approach god and
[51:15] come his provided way
[51:18] amen amen and can't nobody do it for you
[51:22] you've got to come and worship you've
[51:24] got to come and enter in the service
[51:26] each and every time you've got to come
[51:28] every day of your life and and live for
[51:31] him nobody can come and do it for you
[51:33] amen you've got to worship god
[51:35] in this hour
[51:37] amen so we want to enter in this this
[51:39] morning it's an eternal inheritance it's
[51:42] not something that's that's tangible
[51:44] though though it could be god could give
[51:46] us something tangible amen but it's
[51:48] everlasting amen it's got a lasting
[51:51] effect it has an eternal effect this
[51:53] blessedness amen this blessing these
[51:56] riches this morning it's from eternity
[51:58] it's an eternal thing
[52:01] and so the power of the testator amen
[52:04] amen he has made a covenant with with us
[52:08] amen by his blood that testament there
[52:10] amen that's his will he's wrote out a
[52:12] will he's made a covenant amen he sent
[52:15] his word amen it is binding this morning
[52:18] amen by his blood
[52:21] amen and the first was dedicated with
[52:23] blood and so the second amen has been
[52:26] dedicated with blood with the blood of
[52:28] christ
[52:30] amen in his word and his will as the
[52:32] testator amen that is what he has left
[52:35] us
[52:35] he has left us his will amen his word
[52:38] and he wants a people that will take
[52:40] that word and when they can have amen
[52:43] that can think the right way and then
[52:45] they can understand the right way
[52:47] i mean they can grow up and they can
[52:49] they can partake and they can receive
[52:52] and they can understand amen what he has
[52:54] left you the will amen amen and go forth
[52:57] in action
[52:59] amen to take what he has given amen and
[53:01] not just amen even just use it for
[53:04] yourself amen but amen but to give out
[53:06] to give to others
[53:08] amen because if you truly if you truly
[53:10] leave leave something good behind and
[53:13] then it can keep going and it can keep
[53:15] going if i leave my children something
[53:17] if i could really somehow in this life
[53:20] accumulate something amen i would want
[53:22] them to to take that and to receive that
[53:24] and to keep going with it to build it to
[53:27] bring to bring forth more
[53:29] amen and to be able to help somebody and
[53:32] then to pass it along somehow
[53:36] and then so what god has given us in
[53:37] this hour amen as believers he's given
[53:40] us his blood he's giving us his word
[53:43] amen
[53:44] amen it's and it's eternal
[53:48] amen
[53:51] amen and we want to see amen and in his
[53:53] word in his will as the testator amen
[53:55] what he has left us i mean we want to
[53:57] see we want to see who he is in the word
[54:00] we want to see we want to understand the
[54:02] power of christ we want to we want to
[54:04] understand that that way we can speak of
[54:06] these things
[54:08] because you have to put the word on your
[54:10] lips
[54:11] you have it has to be in your heart you
[54:13] have to put it on your lips it has to be
[54:14] in your mind amen and speak that word
[54:19] amen i want to see who he is i want to
[54:20] see his power this morning amen
[54:27] amen so here in the scripture
[54:29] we see speaking of that of that blood
[54:32] sacrifice of the old testament
[54:34] amen a transition and emphasis from that
[54:37] old sacrifice into the actual
[54:39] fulfillment of the top and the shadow of
[54:42] what god had in his mind
[54:44] amen of what the true sacrificial land
[54:46] the son of god would be i mean that was
[54:48] a shadow amen the blood of the old
[54:51] sacrifice and bulls of goats could never
[54:53] bring a perfection
[54:55] amen for the bible says it could never
[54:56] make the comer there unto perfect and
[54:59] every year they would bring that
[55:00] sacrifice and they were forgiven amen
[55:02] but they would leave with the same
[55:04] desire that they had when they come but
[55:06] because it was god's provided way even
[55:08] in god's eyes and in god's eyes they
[55:10] were forgiven they were made clean
[55:12] because they came and they partook and
[55:14] when they came and they entered in amen
[55:16] and perhaps you know it didn't make any
[55:18] sense at first amen but a believer in
[55:21] those days and when they had to come and
[55:23] enter in and then they couldn't skip out
[55:26] they couldn't skip a year and to be a
[55:28] real believer amen you had to you had to
[55:31] come continue that to come every year
[55:33] and maybe you felt bad leaving you think
[55:35] what's this for i'm leaving the same way
[55:38] amen but by faith they looked into the
[55:40] promise and then by faith they
[55:42] understood amen and by faith they walked
[55:45] amen and performed and entered into what
[55:48] god told them to do and if we'll just do
[55:51] that
[55:52] if we'll just do what his word says it
[55:54] ain't got to make sense amen we don't we
[55:57] don't necessarily have to understand
[55:59] everything amen but god amen will give
[56:01] you the faith and if you'll have the
[56:03] faith to walk and to enter in amen
[56:05] there's a blessing in there there's
[56:07] mercy in there there's grace in there
[56:11] amen so
[56:13] so then the bible says how much more
[56:16] how much more the blood of christ
[56:19] i mean if they could go faithfully year
[56:21] after year
[56:23] leaving the same way
[56:25] and they could go forth faithfully amen
[56:27] how about you and i
[56:29] am going to have the understanding that
[56:31] we have and to have the knowledge and
[56:33] the revelation that we have of the blood
[56:35] of christ how much more can we enter in
[56:38] this morning amen in faith amen how much
[56:41] more can we enter into the service amen
[56:43] and say amen amen and not only say amen
[56:46] with our with our mouths but say amen
[56:48] with our lives say lord yes i believe
[56:51] that i believe your word amen your blood
[56:53] amen is rich this morning
[56:55] how much more the blood of christ amen
[56:58] that we could enter in that we could
[56:59] stay with it
[57:01] then we could stay with it
[57:03] amen
[57:11] amen how much more the blood of christ
[57:15] amen who through the eternal spirit
[57:18] offered him
[57:19] himself without spot to god
[57:21] amen he said purge your conscience as we
[57:23] read from the from dead works to serve
[57:25] the living god and so with this blood it
[57:28] brings a perfection it brings the
[57:30] perfection needed that we can walk away
[57:33] different
[57:34] amen that we can walk away different
[57:36] amen it's it's that powerful it's the
[57:38] blood it's the blood that god had in his
[57:40] mind they made us a sacrifice amen and
[57:42] only through christ
[57:44] only through that blood only through
[57:46] that sacrifice can we be made clean amen
[57:49] and that he offered himself without spot
[57:51] amen without spot amen to bring in
[57:53] perfection and to bring forth a church
[57:56] without spot themselves without wrinkle
[57:58] without any such blemish aiming to bring
[58:01] forth a perfection in a people that only
[58:04] his blood could bring forth no works no
[58:07] dead works not no religion nothing you
[58:09] can perform yourself and they could
[58:11] bring it forth only by the blood of
[58:13] jesus christ amen will bring forth that
[58:16] life in a believer amen it'll change you
[58:18] it'll make you different amen it'll make
[58:20] you think different it'll make you walk
[58:22] different
[58:23] it'll make you act different
[58:26] amen
[58:28] amen it'll bring forth the church that
[58:30] he wants the type of people that he
[58:32] wants
[58:34] amen
[58:36] and brother branham says here and things

[1:02:10] it'll be by his grace it'll be by his
[1:02:12] mercy if we if we if for anything in
[1:02:14] this life at all it'll be by his grace

[1:02:21] hebrews 12 and 24
[1:02:27] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[1:02:29] covenant
[1:02:30] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:02:32] speaketh better things than that of abel
[1:02:35] so when abel was slain by cain
[1:02:37] amen there
[1:02:39] there the voice of his blood the bible
[1:02:42] says cried from the ground
[1:02:45] amen abel's voice abel's blood had a
[1:02:48] voice
[1:02:49] that's what the bible said his blood had
[1:02:51] a voice
[1:02:52] amen but this blood
[1:02:54] this blood of christ speaks of better
[1:02:56] things
[1:02:58] and brother adam says in the token
[1:03:00] he says the blood is speaking
[1:03:02] then the blood has got a voice
[1:03:05] and the voice of the blood is the word
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] and that's what makes it whether it's
[1:03:09] right or wrong the word is identified by
[1:03:12] the voice of the blood and the voice of
[1:03:14] the blood is the holy ghost he said that
[1:03:16] brings life it is life and it brings
[1:03:19] life to the word and quickens it amen
[1:03:21] amen he says sure the blood speaks it
[1:03:24] speaks a better thing the old testament
[1:03:26] the blood spoke of guilt but in the new
[1:03:28] testament it speaks of redemption
[1:03:30] and in the old testament spoke of death
[1:03:32] and sorrow in the new testament
[1:03:34] testament speaks of resurrection and
[1:03:36] life it speaks of healing it speaks of
[1:03:39] joy it speaks the power it speaks of
[1:03:42] life it speaks of heaven and then it's
[1:03:44] speaking amen it's speaking of that
[1:03:46] perfect place that we're going to church

[1:03:53] the blood amen crying out to you and i

[1:04:02] good enough it's already made a way if
[1:04:05] you'll come god's provided way amen amen

[1:04:10] old and then with the new it'll make you
[1:04:12] different it'll change your life
[1:04:14] and then it'll turn that frown upside
[1:04:16] down and then it'll make you live in joy
[1:04:18] and happiness and it'll quicken your
[1:04:20] life with resurrection power amen all
[1:04:23] provided by the blood of christ
[1:04:28] oh my god
[1:04:30] it's god's provided way this morning
[1:04:32] it's always been god's provided way
[1:04:35] amen but over time over over the church
[1:04:38] ages and then christ died once he never
[1:04:41] had to come and do it again but what
[1:04:43] happened is we lost the word but in this
[1:04:46] hour the word has been restored we lost
[1:04:49] it under man's ideas and in the dark
[1:04:51] ages and the falling away amen from the
[1:04:53] truth amen amen but in this hour we've
[1:04:55] been restored amen amen under the

[1:05:12] and when the blood is effective this
[1:05:14] morning
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:18] the blood of jesus covers all of our
[1:05:20] sins he says speaks peace resurrection
[1:05:22] power and life and healing
[1:05:24] all of the redemptive blessings that the
[1:05:26] blood was shed for it speaks for us

[1:05:34] amen see the power and the blood this
[1:05:36] morning
[1:05:37] amen if i could remind you amen i know
[1:05:39] it's simple
[1:05:41] i've been listening to god hiding
[1:05:42] himself in simplicity just
[1:05:44] seemed like i hadn't listened to it in a
[1:05:46] long time but i've just been trying to
[1:05:48] listen to it over and over amen but it's
[1:05:50] so rich
[1:05:52] but even in that title god hiding
[1:05:54] himself in simplicity god god hit him
[1:05:56] and hid himself in the in the in the
[1:05:58] womb of a virgin
[1:06:00] wrapped himself in a blood cell
[1:06:02] that's how god became available to you
[1:06:04] and i
[1:06:05] hey man he took on flesh and man he in
[1:06:08] simplicity hid himself in a manger
[1:06:11] how many he lived as a boy he lived as a
[1:06:13] child

[1:06:16] came to age amen he came and he came in
[1:06:20] and received his ministry received amen
[1:06:23] the holy ghost the dove came down upon
[1:06:25] the lamb and he gave his life
[1:06:28] and he didn't live for himself he lived
[1:06:29] for others and that's what the blood
[1:06:31] does i mean that's what that life does
[1:06:33] that life of god it don't live for
[1:06:35] others it don't live for yourself it
[1:06:36] lives for other people and then eternal
[1:06:38] life is living for others
[1:06:41] and that's what that life produces
[1:06:43] and that's what the church amen that's
[1:06:45] what we are to produce the top of life

[1:16:55] but you do it unconsciously
[1:16:57] amen but you got to come to a place you

[1:17:02] need something it ain't about getting
[1:17:04] down amen and crying amen and begging
[1:17:07] for it and and so forth and then we do
[1:17:10] got to get down the altar we do got to
[1:17:12] get down to business with god it does
[1:17:14] take that but if you'll come to the
[1:17:16] place where just say lord i believe i

[1:17:41] knowledge was a failure
[1:17:43] he was going to try to do it his own way
[1:17:45] amen but when he had that experience
[1:17:47] when he met god god sent him forth amen
[1:17:50] not with an army not with his
[1:17:51] understanding but he sent him forth with
[1:17:53] a stick amen in there in that sense that
[1:17:56] simplicity didn't look like nothing
[1:17:59] man amen but he had met god and god sent
[1:18:02] this man forth with a stick amen and he
[1:18:04] and he took down a nation he took down
[1:18:06] the greatest kingdom of the world and
[1:18:08] then he just took that which what god
[1:18:10] had given him in his hand and he went
[1:18:12] forth by faith under the commission and
[1:18:15] we as the church amen we've been
[1:18:16] commissioned in this hour am going to
[1:18:18] take the word you say i don't know much
[1:18:21] i don't understand much but take what
[1:18:23] you have amen and god will use it he'll
[1:18:25] multiply it he'll bring a power in your
[1:18:28] life amen amen the little bit that you
[1:18:30] know the little bit that you understand
