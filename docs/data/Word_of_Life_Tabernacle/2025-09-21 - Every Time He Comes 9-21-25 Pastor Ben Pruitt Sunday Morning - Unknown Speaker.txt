Maybe you have a special unspoken request you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand this morning. He sees every heart, knows every need. So thankful that he does today. pray that he would just meet every need. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we come before you this morning, Lord, how we always need help from you. We we can't walk without you holding our hand. And we pray, God, that you'd be here this morning to help us, Lord. We know that you promised to be where two or three are gathered together. You said, "I will be in their midst." Lord, so we believe you are here this morning. Help us to recognize you. May we may we take advantage of the fact Lord that you're with us. Lord may the sick be healed. And Lord may those that are Lord weary Lord in the race. May they be comforted today and refreshed. Lord if there's a sinner here this morning I pray they would they would be saved. Come to a a knowledge of your grace. If there's a backslider I pray they would return. Lord if there's a one Lord maybe the devil's attacked them this week. I pray they would gain the victory this morning. Realize that greater is he that is in them than he that is in the world. Pray you'd grant it now. I thank you for your presence today. Thank you for coming and meeting me, Lord, and changing my life. I pray it would be so with every person here this morning, young and old. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. We're going to uh read this morning from the book of Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1. Exodus chapter 3 and:es 1-6. While you're turning there, I know we're all aware that brother Biscll passed away this week and he has uh been such a uh influence in all of our lives, especially as as ministers. uh since I was a young man. Hearing brother Biscll preach has always been a a pleasure and he took time to talk to you when you met him and things like that. It was always a blessing to me and and uh God used him in our generation and have to say this that the torch has been passed and brother Biscll hadn't preached for a while now. He's gotten older and lived a long life, but torch has passed to a new generation. And and where are the young men that will stand up and you know, I want to do my part. I can't do what brother Biscll did, but I want to do my part in in proclaiming the message of the hour and the gospel of Jesus Christ in the day that I'm living. How many want to do that? I I want to pick up the baton. I want to be serious about the message of the hour and and do what I can do. Uh we pray for the Biscll family and pray the Lord will bless them. This message this morning is inspired by something uh that brother Biscll had a testimony that he had told and also uh brother Stewart mentioned that when he was praying this morning and uh so I appreciated that. I believe we're in the will of the Lord this morning and just believe that the preaching would would uh God would move me out of the way and speak to you today. Exodus 3 and verse 1 says, "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight." why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses, and he said, Here am I. He said, Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. I want to title this this morning every time he comes. Moses had never met God until he met him in the form of the pillar of fire. Though he had been protected all of his life, he had he had made it even as a baby, God had protected him and kept him in the river and and protected him from destruction uh from his enemies and even protected him and in that he didn't uh when he killed a man there in Egypt, he he didn't die for it. He was able to uh to leave and and go in the backside of the desert, he kept him and helped him. And yet Moses had never really met God until he met him in the form of this fire in the bush, which we call the pillar of fire because that's what it's called later uh in the in the scripture that went with uh the tabernacle went that that set over the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. He had heard of Jehovah from a baby. He had been taught about the things of God from a baby. But this was different. And I think all of us have to come to that that moment when it becomes personal to us when uh when we when we see something supernatural and we see something that is more to it than just what uh nature would bring or just what we could understand with our mind. But Moses saw something that was unexplainable. And that something was a pillar of fire burning a fire burning in a bush that he couldn't understand why the bush would not be consumed. So it was not a natural fire but it was a supernatural fire. So this meeting that he had would change the course of his life and alter the course of history. Of course being uh the foundation Moses being the foundation of the law being the foundation of the the Jewish religion also of the Christian religion as we believed on Christ and he come to fulfill the law. And so we know that uh we know that uh that it it had a real difference made a difference in his life. And I'll quote brother Brandon saying this. He said, "Oh, that little sacred place where man can meet God as Moses had on the back side of the desert. I wonder if we really believe today that that same God is present right now. And that if we could act, if we could by faith reach into another dimension, we would see that that same God is here with us. And he's able to do whatever whatever we have need of. He's able to meet that need this morning. How many of you come to church really believing that he's able to meet that need? He's not a God of history. He's not a God of yesterday. He's a God of today. And he cares about my needs. He cares about my family. He cares about the things I'm going through. He cares about everything in my life. &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that today? Can we comprehend that he he's not only here, but he cares and he wants to reach out and the only way to access that is by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, brother Brandham tells us after 40 years of good schooling and the highest degrees that he could be given, knowing his position as a deliverer, as a Hebrew, we know he was taught that by his mother who cared for him even in Pharaoh's house. Knew that God had called him for the commission. Yet he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that burning bush than all his 40 years of theology taught him. He was in the presence of God. Oh, I tell you what, you can learn about the message. You can learn about the Bible. You can you can be taught these things, but five minutes in the presence of God will do more for you than all the years of theology will ever do. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that Paul experienced the same thing in Acts chapter nine as he tells the story as Luke tells the story, right? The writer of Acts, he tells the story of Paul as he journeyed, he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?" Now, what what was it that caused Paul to identify this light and this voice as the Lord? Right? He he as a Jew, he would understand the import of that. This was God, &gt;&gt; right? It was God appearing in the form of a pillar of fire. What what would make him recognize that? He recognized that because he was a he was a Jew. understood that that pillar of fire had been with Moses and that God dwelt in that fire. And so he recognized it was a scriptural thing. He had read about Moses, but it was just a a knowledge. In fact, Paul said he was the Pharisee of the Pharisees. He knew the scriptures inside and out. He knew the Jewish religion, but he never met God until that moment when the pillar of fire came down. &gt;&gt; And he met him there in a pillar of fire. Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." It's always been Jesus, the pillar of fire, has always been Christ. I am Jesus whom thou persecuted. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wil thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee that what thou must do. Now, they had something in common, Moses and Paul, because they had seen the visible presence of God. The Jews called that visible presence the shikina glory. Shikina means to dwell. It's a it's a Hebrew word means to dwell. And the glory was the the the presence of God. It literally means the face of God. So the pillar of fire or cloud in the Old Testament was an evidence of his dwelling in a place. Now, I want you to understand when we say he's here, we're not talking about a worked up emotional state. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Right. That's not what we're talking about when we say he's here. &gt;&gt; Because he's there whether you feel him or whether you don't. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. He's there. I'm so glad he's with you. No matter what you feel like, no matter what's going on in your life, no matter what trouble you might be going through this morning, he's still there with you. You young people at school, you might you might be troubled. You might be feel intimidated by all the things going around, but when you bow your head there at the lunch table to pray, he's there with you. He promised he would be there with you. When you make a stand for Christ in a community that you live in, you ladies, when you dress the way you do, act the way that you do, we're different from the world. I know that. I know we're different, but there's a reason for that difference. We're trying to obey the word of God as best we can. And when when you obey the word of God, he's there with you. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." I'm so thankful for that. But I'm also thankful that when moments even that we fail and when we turn our back on him and we don't do what's right, he's still there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that today. I'm so glad it's not just when I'm doing right, when I'm thinking right, when I'm acting right, but even in the moments when I can't even seem to know what right is, he's still there. &gt;&gt; And if you'll just reach out to him this morning, you say, "Brother Ben, you don't know what I've done. You don't know where I've been, but he's still there. He wants to He wants to display his presence to you. &gt;&gt; If you just let him this morning, sir, &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire was the visible manifestation. And Jehovah, God, spoke from that visible manifestation of his presence. God in the form of the logos, the pillar of fire, the anointing. And we know the pillar of fire is not the same as the son of man. Brother Brandham explained that to us. The scriptures teach that the son of man is Christ, the flesh of Christ that housed deity, the fullness of the godhead bodily, the scripture says. But the pillar of fire dwelt in him, right? That's the the spirit that was in him. And that pillar of fire is the logos that went out of God. Where do you get logos? John chapter 1. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. That word is logos. In the beginning was the logos. Logos was with God. And the logos was God. The logos was made flesh and dwelt among us. So there was God dwelt in in a form. No man has seen God at any time, but he made himself he condescended and and he showed himself as an angel of the Lord in a in a theophony body. He showed himself as a pillar of fire. He showed himself as a light. And that was a a part of God which was the attribute of the fullness of God. And it becomes the son of God. And we know that because Paul said, "Lord, who art thou Lord?" He said, "I am Jesus." I hope you can follow me through that. So when God become into a form where it could be seen, it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth. It's condescending coming down. God the father, the logos, was up over Israel. He was holy, could not bear sin. There had to be a blood offering in Eden. Then that logos became flesh and dwelt among us. And where this logos dwelt in a human body, which was a sacrifice. Now, the logos dwelt in Christ. Christ was born to die for our sins. Aren't you glad that he did? We don't ever get past that. We don't ever get too revelated for that. We needed a cross. We still need the cross today. &gt;&gt; And we know that Christ is the glory of God. In fact, in Revelation 21 23, when we get to that city, when we get to that new heavens and new earth, it says, "The city had no need of the sun, neither the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof." So he said, "Christ is the glory of God. He is the attribute of the fullness of God. He is the pillar of fire." &gt;&gt; Amen. And when man was made in the image of God, then God come down in the image of man to redeem man. That brought man and God together. It's a great thing, church, because we had no way when Adam sinned. We had no way back into the presence of God. Oh my. Adam went out with it when when Eve uh did what she did and Adam did what he did and they went away out of the garden. We had no way. But a lamb's blood was spilled. Amen. Amen. And before the foundation of the world, God had made a way to bridge the gap in the chasm to bring you back into fellowship with God again. And that way was by was by the logos, the pillar of fire becoming flesh and dying for your sins. Oh my. God come down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together. Heaven and earth hugged and kissed each other. God and man embraced each other. Fatherhood and sunship from the logos became flesh and dwelt among us. This logos there was in him which was the spirit of God. the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is anointed with the same logos. &gt;&gt; Right? He was the firstborn Paul says among many brethren &gt;&gt; now on the day of Pentecost. Now we're not Christ. We don't have the fullness of God but we have we we have a portion of his spirit. He was divided among the body of Christ. I'm so thankful he's still here today. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, he come down that same pillar of fire that Moses saw. The same pillar of fire that Paul saw came down on the day of Pentecost and it broke apart like that and tongues of fire set upon each of them. Not their tongues but tongues of fire. An elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that God had separated himself into man. He said God the logo separating himself into man. God not in one person. He's in his church universal right now while God is here speaking with us in our hearts. He's in Africa. He's in Asia. He's in Europe. He's in England. Whoever believers are gathered together, there he is in the midst of them. And after he talks about how Paul was struck down by the pillar of fire, he said that was not the son of man. That was the logos. Now this great pillar of fire is absolutely identified even by cameras. We got the picture of it. We show there in Houston how it struck the lens. Psy lens won't take psychology. It wasn't a workup. It wasn't a mental kind of emotion. But God came down where he could be seen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I don't think we recognize the importance of that this morning, church. &gt;&gt; God came down where he could be seen in our age. &gt;&gt; He was about to do something. Well, I believe one day, I believe soon, he's coming back like he promised. &gt;&gt; He come down on our to show us something. He said, "I called it psychology, but the light struck the lens, and the lens won't take psychology." He said, "Then watch the works of it among us proves the same Jesus that once lived in Palestine. The same spirit was upon him has come up through a body until it's come back to headship again. He's coming soon to claim the body." The head's coming to the body. He is the head of the church. Is that right? And Paul says he and all things. Someone say all things. All things he might have the preeminence. I want him to have the preeminence in our services to have the preeminence. What has the preeminence? The logos, the word, the pillar of fire, the presence of God. You can't have the presence of God without the word of God. That's why we put so much emphasis on preaching. That's why we put so much emphasis on the word of God because we believe that's what makes the presence of God come down and do its work. &gt;&gt; The word of God, the mechanics and the dynamics working together. He said, "I'm not he. I'm his servant." Amen. He said it's in the pillar of fire. It's not he. in spirit form was upon the son of man has come down now to anoint sons of man to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together. Now we know whenever a major dispensational change came, God spoke to a prophet through the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; right? God spoke to Moses through a pillar of fire because it was it was a change over from the Abrahamic over now to Moses was going to bring under the law because the people desired the law. So they had to have something to live by and yet yet they had grace but they chose the law but but they but they chose the law to live by and when they did there was a there was a pillar of fire that come down to identify the prophet and and and the the commandments that they were true and and it was the visible presence of God and and remember when God spoke to the people he spoke to them and he and I want you to think with me this morning how that God spoke to the people. He spoke to them directly. Remember, he come down on the pillar of fire and cloud. He spoke to the people and the people said, "Don't let God speak. &gt;&gt; It's too terrible. &gt;&gt; We're afraid to stand in the presence of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know there's a lot of frolic today and people run around and I I believe in emotion. I believe in being happy in your religion. I believe in shouting and dancing and jumping, whatever you want to do. But the presence of God when you come into it, there ought to be a a not not a fear because we know we can come boldly before the throne of God. But there ought to be a a real sincerity in our hearts and our lives when we come to the house of God. It's not a place to make jokes and and chew gum and run around do things, run around the sanctuary uh during between services and things. There's a reason why we keep the order that we do. Because we believe this is where the presence of God, not just in this building, but all in all of our lives, but especially when we're gathered together. We believe the pillar of fire comes down right here in our midst. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They said, "Don't let God speak. Let Moses speak." &gt;&gt; All right, sir. &gt;&gt; And so they separated themselves from it. And so God came down into Moses, veiled himself in Moses. &gt;&gt; We'll get to the scripture after a while, Lord willing. And if I can get through enough before we time to go, but he talked about how Moses was veiled from the people because his face was shown. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Moses didn't even realize it. But when the people saw it, they couldn't even look at him. So he had to veil his face because he had been in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Now he comes down for a purpose. When he come to Moses, he come down. They said, "Don't let God speak, let Moses speak." And so that was a dispensation change. He come down to Paul and and the message was going to the Gentiles, a previously unrevealed mystery, &gt;&gt; right? That was in the scripture. But the Jews couldn't see the the age of the Gentiles. But Paul recognized it by grace. God gave him a message to the Gentiles. And it was a pillar of fire that come down and identified it &gt;&gt; and changed his life. Amen. Just like it changed Moses. Five minutes in his presence. Changed his life. &gt;&gt; Why? It was for a purpose. Every time he comes, &gt;&gt; church. List, you mentioned that this morning in your prayer is what inspired this message. Every time he comes, &gt;&gt; it's for a purpose, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're we're tired or we're weary. We've been through a lot of things. And I understand I I I live a life a normal life like everybody else. I'm not all the time in the presence of God. I realize I I live a life I get worried about things. I I I stress out about things and have to do the things that everybody else does in life and I'm grateful to be a minister and be able to study and do these things. That don't mean I'm always I'm always feel his presence. I believe he's always there. I don't always feel him. But I'll tell you what, when I do feel him, I want to take advantage of that moment in his presence. I want to if he wants me to take my shoes off, let me take my shoes off. I don't But that's what he asked him to do. But what would he ask you to do? I don't know. But whatever he asks you to do when you're in his presence, you ought to do it. &gt;&gt; We ought to take that seriously &gt;&gt; when he comes. Cuz every time he comes, something good happens. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I don't want this just to be another service. I don't want one of our services, we have three services a week, and I don't want one of them most weeks. I don't want one of them to be just another service, &gt;&gt; just another box that we check, just another moment that we spent worshiping or playing instruments or preaching, but let it be a moment in the presence of God. I realized that without him, I can't do anything. I can't say anything. I can't be effective. I can't help nobody. So Lord, I need you. I need to be in your presence. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, brother Paul, we we get so sidetracked by everything going on in our life that the pillar of fire can come right down among us. &gt;&gt; And be right here in the midst of the church and we walk away say, "Well, the preacher did good today or he did bad." that the songs were good, but did we spend any time sincerely in the presence of Jehovah? Brother Brandham talked about how it was identified scientifically, the pillar of fire. But I want you to notice this. He said, "And by the reaction." So the pillar of fire was identified. They took a picture of it and proved that it was genuine. And then it was identified by the reaction. By the reaction. So that would be the people's response to the pillar of fire coming. I'm taking this soul for a reason this morning. I hope that we can catch it. We can grasp it. So it was identified by the reaction by its character and everything else just the same as it was when it was dwelling in the body of God's only begotten son. So does it dwell in the body of his adopted sons for the last day. He said, "Now I know, brother. We've had a lot of this impersonation." And we've seen a lot of that there. We went through a period of time. It's not so much anymore. Now the big thing is everybody falls out on the floor. And again, God does that, but it's become a mockery of it, &gt;&gt; right? Through the charismatic move. Everybody's falling out on the floor. Everybody's doing this stuff. We believe in the real thing, &gt;&gt; but we don't believe in the mockery of it. &gt;&gt; But it become there comes through a time and I remember that even in the message when everybody had the pillar of fire appearing all the time. &gt;&gt; But when he comes, he comes for a reason. &gt;&gt; When he shows himself visible, that's a big deal. &gt;&gt; He's making himself known. He's not just coming so some guy somewhere can can beat a bunch of people over the head and say this came to me and some come on church. I've been through it. I know I I was raised around that where people were always saying they saw the pillar of fire to try to vindicate their own ministry so they could say whatever they wanted to that was outside of the scripture. Whatever they wanted to that was outside of the message. But listen, I didn't come to bring you something new this morning. I come to tell you what a prophet said. I come tell you what the Bible says. If you want to hear something new, you you know, you don't you don't need to be here. But I tell you this, the thing that we have, the same pillar of fire, if it would inspire a prophet to preach, if it would inspire Moses to write the law and Paul to write the New Testament and a prophet to preach the word, I believe when I preach the same word that they preach, I that same pillar of fire will change your life. It'll make you new. It'll make your home different. It'll make your family new. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon talked about how he had a loss of impersonation. He said, "But the Bible said it would happen." Janice and Jan Jambers withtood Moses. Just got to happen. But don't let that blind you. When you see a bogus dollar, remember was made off of a real one. See, if it isn't, it it's the original. But there is an original Holy Ghost, original Christ. Certainly, he is the Holy Ghost. And the pillar of fire still alive today among us all these thousands of years still is here. I know I'm reading a lot, but I just I want to just really settle this in before I get to what I want to say this morning. The Lson translation of the Bible, they had a on the cover of it a triangle light. It was showed the three attributes of God in a godhead. And it was a sign to the to the Hebrew of God light. And when Moses met him in the bush, he said, "I am." He said, "They'll they'll ask what your name is because everybody said they had a god appear to them, right? There were all kinds of desert gods, all kinds of city gods, all kinds of water god, all kinds of gods. Even the Hindus today, I forget how many millions of gods the Hindus have, but but there there's all kinds of gods." So the people being pagans and and even the children of Israel were around those pagans and they would have asked, "Well, who is this God?" &gt;&gt; What's your name? He said, "I am." &gt;&gt; I love that. Not I was, not I will be, but I am. Which remains the same. It means he's always there. We may not always see him, but he's always there. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. According to Hebrews 13:8, he's still the same God. And Moses made him in the burning bush. He was a light. And when he led the children of Israel out of the wilderness, he was the angel of the covenant. Moses by face on forsook Egypt esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures than that of Egypt. Now that that's taken from Hebrews 11. Now think about this for a moment. Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ, right? The the reproach of Christ. And I know the immediate response to that is Paul take Paul's taking liberty there because he's just well he's just saying Christ, but really was the reproach of Jehovah. But no, Paul knew what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches. &gt;&gt; What was he saying? Amen. The one who who revealed to him was Christ. He had a responsibility. He had seen Christ in that form of the pillar of fire. And he esteemed the reproach of Christ. Christ means the anointed one. He he esteemed the reproach of that that that moment he had greater than all the treasures of Egypt. And and to do that, he had to look by faith. Because even if you see the pillar of fire in its natural form, even if it would come this morning and hang here, though I wouldn't say that it couldn't, it could come and you could see it, but even if you did, you'd have to have faith to believe it. &gt;&gt; But what he wants us to do is to see what's not visible. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? When when Moses, he he led them by the pillar of fire and by the cloud. But when they entered into the promised land, there was no more pillar of fire, no more cloud, but the pillar of fire become a person, the captain of the host. And he come and met Joshua on the other side of the Jordan and told him how to take Jericho. I believe that same pillar of fire is living in bodies of flesh today. Amen. I believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That same anointing came down with his baptism. When Christ was baptized, he come in his baptism, went into Christ, and dwelt in him. John knew it was him. said, "Upon whom thou shalt see the spirit led them out of Egypt in the wilderness, out of the wilderness into the promised land, upon whom thou shalt see this triangle form of God coming down remaining on." He's the one that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire. Paul hadn't been privileged of seeing this yet, but just to make it true to you, the Jews were so forbidden to bow before an idol or anything, but when he saw this great light, he knew that was the Lord. I like this Lord means ownership, control of. He would have not just called just anything Lord that staunch Hebrew when he knew that that was that that that was spirit he said but he knew that the same pillar of fire had been the one that led his people and he comes back and said Lord who are you I want to know who you are &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; you met Moses in the name of I am &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; oh my he said Jesus when he was on earth anointed with that that they saw &gt;&gt; so Jesus was anointed with what they saw he said I come from God the spirit the light the pillar fire and I returned to God. He was made flesh in order to die for our sins. And after his death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, he ascended up on the 50th day, returned back in the form of a pillar of fire. Among the people, separated himself like tongues of fire sent upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other tongues. As the spirit gave them utterance, remembering they the the 3,000 that were outside, they asked Peter, "What could shall we what can we do to be saved?" He said, "Repent, be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." What was that gift of the Holy Ghost? The same pillar of fire that sat down on each one of them would divide himself into every member &gt;&gt; of the body of Christ. Oh, I'm so glad this morning if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning, if you really been born again, changed, you got that same anointing, that same God that was inside Moses, the same God that was in Paul, that same God is in you today. I think we ought to quit giving in to the devil. Oh, oh, my problems are too much. My struggles are too hard. I got too much going on. I can't really serve God like the word says cuz I got too You got what you got is excuses. But if you'll just recognize that the word of God is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. It don't matter what your situation is. He's still God. &gt;&gt; Come on. Is he still God or is he not God? I believe he is still God. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's the same God. Hallelujah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I know your baby's not feeling well this morning, but the same God that brought her into the world is the same God that'll heal her. The same Come on, church. The same God that saved you. It's the same God that'll heal you. The same God that brought you in is the same God that'll bring your children in. &gt;&gt; The same God that come to you and change your life is the same God will change your body one day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said they you see see we're not a divided people. We've got to be in unity because each one of us holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it when his church sets together in heavenly places. That's from Ephesians 1 that we've been studying. And the fullness of the power of God is in his church. Each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again. &gt;&gt; Whether we see it in a in this three dimensions or whether we don't, &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll be here." &gt;&gt; He told his disciples said, "I'll never leave you." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Said I won't leave you comfortless. That word is orphanos. Orphans. I won't leave you without help. I'll come to you. That ought to put a courage in you that you can do anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If there's a calling, if there's something in your life that's calling, maybe it's calling you to be a real husband, a real provider. Maybe it's calling you to be a real wife. Maybe it's calling you to be a real preacher, a real deacon, whatever office maybe that you might hold in the church. Something in you calling you said, "I just can't do it like what I want to do it." But I'm here to tell you, if that same pillar of fire, if that same spirit dwells in you, it'll also quicken your mortal bodies, it it'll make you where you can do what you've been called to do. You you you are able to overcome every every fiery dart of the enemy. How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's here, then he can do the same things he did when he walked the shores of Galilee. He's still the same God. He said, "Greater works shall you do." He said, "Cuz I go to my father." But listen to me, church. What What is it? There's more. There's more here. this morning we can do more than what even what he did greater even in the sense that now we can speak the word &gt;&gt; are you with me now &gt;&gt; when we speak it means something &gt;&gt; so of course you know brother Brandham having the discernment like he did being able to know what's in people's lives he said here's a lady he'd often say something like this he said sitting he said see that light can you see it and if you listen to the tapes or watch the mo the film you've seen You've seen the people sitting there. He'd say, "See that light? Everybody look." See kind of an amber looking circle. Many times they couldn't see it, but yet his picture was taken. And on Deep Calls to the Deep, it's interesting because you can actually see ministers standing up looking for it. But it it was a common thing for him, right? He would see that and and he would know that's that's why he called people out of the audience. It wasn't just picking somebody, but he'd the purifier would settle down over that person. &gt;&gt; It was common for him to see that. But when brother Brandham, it wouldn't be for us, but it was for him. He's a prophet. But brother Brandham was hunting in Colorado. You remember the story? And a storm begins to blow up. I know we got some brothers hunting in Colorado right now. Hope they don't have any storms. But Brother Brandham talked about this. He said, "You don't have to believe this, but it's true. A voice spoke to me. He said, "I am the Lord God. I've created the heavens and the earth. Nature obeys me." Now, this is very interesting. Brother Brandon says, "I I sat there a little bit, jerked off my hat, and the voice spoke to me and said, "I'm the Lord God. I've created the heavens, earth, nations obey me." He said, "I sat there for a little bit and and and that voice somewhere I couldn't see it." He's the only thing I could hear it. It was around there in them trees somewhere. I thought, "Well, usually you see that light that all of you know about. Usually it's there." &gt;&gt; But I looked everywhere and I couldn't see the light. But even though a prophet couldn't see it, &gt;&gt; it was still there. &gt;&gt; I said, "Where are you, oh God, my creator?" I looked around. I couldn't hear it no more. Hear his voice. You all know the story. Finally, the voice spoke again. And brother Brandham, he said, "Speak to your problem." Brother Brandham speaks to the storm. And the storm stopped. &gt;&gt; See, you don't really believe that happened. I do. &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe the voice of God today is in his people. I believe that with all of my heart. I believe that you can speak. I'm not just saying just about anything, but when the inspiration comes, when in that time when you when you know you you're standing on his word, you're in his presence, and he inspires you to speak, you can speak to the storms in your life. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, what I've needed most of all in my life is not a a natural storm spoken away, but most of what I've needed is to the storm in this in this earth, in this flesh, that needs to be stopped. Many times when I when my thoughts get away from me and it seemed like there's a tornado tearing up my life and it seemed like everything's going wrong, I can speak to that as a son of God and say, "I know if you steal the storm when Jesus stood on the bow of the boat and he said, "Peace be still." And you showed a prophet, it could still be done. He's the same God. And the prophet wasn't God, but Jesus is still God. &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he stood there and stopped the storm. I believe it happened cuz I believe it'll happen for me. I believe it has happened for me. &gt;&gt; So why wouldn't he show himself always just let you know just hang here where we could always see him? Well, he wants us to believe &gt;&gt; by faith. Moses, &gt;&gt; he didn't always, he wasn't always in the presence of that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; but he promised him he would be with him. &gt;&gt; So, he stood in the face of Pharaoh, even in opposition, even when it seemed like things were going wrong, yet he stood there and declared the word of the Lord. And God honored his word. Amen. He wants us to believe him. See, he veiled himself as we said behind Moses when they said, "Let don't let Moses speak. Let God speak." He veiled himself behind badger skins that there were skins hung over the tabernacle and over the holy of holies. A veil that was over the holy of holies. He veiled himself in the body of his son. We know when he hung there on the cross, the mercy seat was that was physically the mercy seat was there or they thought that it was, but actually the mercy seat, God's place of mercy was hanging on a cross and they couldn't see it. But so what did he do? He rent the veil from the top to the bottom showing it was the hand of God that did it. Rent the veil from the top to the bottom show that that that was not a mercy seat any longer. But you must come to Christ to be saved. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You must come to Christ to be saved. And so God hid himself in the body of his son. On the day of Pentecost, he hid himself in 120 believers. And ever since then, he's failed himself in his body, the church. But by faith, Israel knew he was back there. They knew he was there regardless what any of the heathen worlds had to say. He was hid from the unbeliever. But the believer by faith knew he was back there. Listen, in the old temple in Solomon's temple, when the presence of shikina of God was still there, we just got done preaching about it. The presence of God was still there in that temple. &gt;&gt; And the people knew. The people knew it was there, &gt;&gt; but you remember they couldn't go look at it. &gt;&gt; Only the high priest could go once a year. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And if he went wrong, he'd die. &gt;&gt; He had to go with a pomegranate and a bail tied to his bottom of his robe. And then wherever he walked and cried holy to the Lord. &gt;&gt; If he didn't walk a certain way and dress himself a certain way and anointed a certain way and he would actually die. &gt;&gt; They say that they actually put a rope around their leg and they would pull him out of there. They didn't dare go in and get him. If he died, they would actually pull him pull him out. But as long as they followed exactly the directions of God, they would be saved. But only one man once a year. And brother Brandham talked to us how those people must have yearned to go into the presence of God. Do you realize what he did for us on Calvary? He he he opened up the Holy of Holies so that we could go in. &gt;&gt; But they still believed it was there even though they couldn't see it. There will be moments in your life when you don't feel him. There will be moments in your life when you you don't see the visible pillar of fire and you can't even feel the warmth of it. But you know he's still there because he promised he would be with you. And it's during those moments you've got to believe no matter what the world says. I still believe in the God of Elijah. I still believe in the God of Moses. I still believe in the God of Paul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe in the God of my fathers, the God of the Bible. Why? Hallelujah. Because I know that Shikina is there in another dimension hid behind skins. Amen. We enter into that unseen world by faith. And this is why in the same service, are y'all still with me this morning? In the same service, one person can sit there and be absolutely bored to death. &gt;&gt; And another person sit there and and they they know he's there. And just while the preaching's going on, they just suddenly receive their healing. Maybe during a song they're they're released from spirits of depression and things like that. But it's faith that does it. &gt;&gt; It's not how good you live. &gt;&gt; Although we know we have confidence with God if we don't have condemnation in our life, but it's not how good you live. Did you ever notice how much your your your flesh has to do with that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like if you're really tired, it's hard to enter into the presence of God. If you're really, if your mind's racing, if you just got done looking at 50 reels on Instagram or 500, I hit a cord there. &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching against that. But you see what happens? &gt;&gt; You just you you've been so involved in that, your flesh is keyed up. &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are in another place. And now when the presence of God settles down, you're just walking around there like, "Well, this was a good service. &gt;&gt; Glad to be back to my reels." &gt;&gt; Gets so addictive, we go to it in church. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about cuz I'm a human being. &gt;&gt; Right. I know what that's like. You get You get so addicted to it that you get to where you can't do it. You just you just sitting there scrolling or looking on social media and just going like that even during while the preaching's going on or something like that. I'm not rebuking your church, but do you realize that flesh is hindering you? &gt;&gt; So what we do when we come in the presence of God is we deny the flesh. &gt;&gt; We don't cater to it. We deny it. &gt;&gt; And we come into the house of God and we say, "Lord, I know you're going to meet me here today. I got a need in my life." You say, "Well, I don't have any needs. What about the others that are going to be sitting with you? What about the young people that need a real experience with God? What about our elders that need their healing? What about somebody that might be sitting there might be their last service that they're ever in that may be right on the brink of making a bad decision and going out and leaving the house of God, but the presence of God is there. And if you could enter in, it would help them to enter in. &gt;&gt; It's hard to enter in right after you had a fuss with your wife. &gt;&gt; It got quiet. It's hard to enter in right after you just yelled at the kids. &gt;&gt; We expect our kids to enter in and all you did was abuse them all morning &gt;&gt; verbally. I hope not physically. &gt;&gt; Then we expect them to enter into church. &gt;&gt; Just preaching my heart this morning. Do we realize that every time he comes something good happens if we could just get beyond the veil of flesh to enter into that presence? &gt;&gt; See what would it feel like this morning if you could come to a presence of God that could be seen. If you could come to that, if you knew that he was somewhere and you could go to that and he could be seen, I think all of us would pack up and go wherever that was, &gt;&gt; right? If if there was a presence of God would settle down in a visible way, we we would all want to be there and and I understand that. But what if you could see through eyes of faith this morning? 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and:e 7 says if the ministration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious. He's talking about the law. He said so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away. In other words is only temporary. How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of the condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of righteousness exceeding glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelth. For that which is done away was glorious. So in other words, in comparison to what we have now, &gt;&gt; Paul's saying that wasn't even glorious at all when they could see the pillar of fire sitting over the tabernacle. He said that was not even as glorious as this is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the glory that excelth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious. Seeing then we have such hope. We use great plainness of speech, not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished. Other words, they could not see who God really was. They could not understand what the end result would be. They just knew to to please God, they had to do certain things. But this morning, you and I cannot please God in the flesh. But we found that the end of it, the end of the commandment was righteousness and love and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Amen. But their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil and taken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even until this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, oh, I'm so glad there's hope even for the Jewish nation, at least for 144,000 that are elect, the veil should be taken away. Now, the Lord is that spirit. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord. Do you realize what he's saying? &gt;&gt; With an unveiled face. We're looking right at the glory of the Lord in a mirror. &gt;&gt; That's what the word glass in the King James means. A mirror. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? We are looking. Oh god. You can't see it by natural eyes because when you look in a mirror by natural eyes, you don't look too good. Well, I don't. I look by natural eyes and I see a man getting old, getting weaker and weaker every day. You say that's not true. Well, once you pass 21, you start to die. &gt;&gt; You're going downhill. But JT's known me since I was younger than 21, so he knows. We're going downhill. Oh, church. Looking in a mirror. I might look at myself said, "You got a lot to do." Brother Brandon looked at himself and said, "I" He said, "I better do something for God." That was when he was laying there, you remember? And he was transported beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; I saw millions beyond the curtain of time that said, he said, "I preached the same thing that Paul preached. He said, "We're resting on that." &gt;&gt; But he was laying there looking at himself and saying, "I haven't done enough for the Lord." So Jaden, all of us can look in a mirror looking at the natural and not see the glory of God. But if you could just look at the spiritual, if you could see by faith your future in the mirror, what are you looking at? You're saying, "I've been baptized with the Holy Ghost. I've been saved. Saved from sin. I've been brought into the kingdom of God. And as I behold in a glass the glory of the Lord in a mirror. The word is like a mirror that we look at when we behold it. When we look at it, we see Christ. But as we see Christ in the mirror, if you can see by faith, not see yourself. If you can see beyond the veil of the flesh and see the the anointing, the shakina of the word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? If you can look beyond it, you are changed into the same image from glory to glory. from from the glory of the law to the glory of grace. From the glory oh come on church from the glory of justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. From glory to glory until you leave here &gt;&gt; even as by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You may not see it by natural eyes. &gt;&gt; When you enter in by faith, you feel his presence. Brother Brandon described that presence as warm, sweet, humble, welcome. He would talked to people many times and I'm just kind of rushing through this, but you can go back and find it. He said, "It's his presence." He said, "Don't be afraid. It's his presence." Now, you have a real strange odd kind of sweet, humble-like feeling. Standing in the presence of a man wouldn't make you feel that way. I mean, you ever seen that light? That pillar of fire was taken right here in Texas. First time, second time, it's hanging right by the woman, seeing this dimension now. Again, brother Brandon, another place said, "Oh, that blessed sweetness coming up near the bush now. Feel the effects of the fire on the bush. The Holy Spirit warming our souls to face. So, we're not trying to work you up. Not trying to get you to a fever pitch so that you can make a decision for Christ, but we're just trying to get out of the way so that the presence of God can manifest itself by the preaching of the word. Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the word of God. When the word is preached, what happens? It brings you in the presence of deity. Oh church, do we I'm not saying that because I'm preaching this morning. It wouldn't matter who was behind the pulpit. &gt;&gt; As I stand here at the as a pastor, I preach so many sermons that I feel like I love it when somebody else preaches. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I like to hear preaching. So it don't matter who's standing up here, but when it's the word of God that's being preached and not a man's emotions or a man's sensation or a man just just just reflecting himself. But a man preaching the word, when he preaches the word, what does it do? It brings our hearts to faith. And when we believe, we can enter into the presence of God. Brother Brandon says it this way. Have you forgotten about dinner? Oh no. Every time I bring it up, people get hungry. or have dinner after church. Y'all are welcome to eat with us, whoever wants to. But have you forgotten about it? Something about being in his presence makes you forget about those things. Have you forgotten whether the kids are all right out in the car or not? That stresses me out, him even saying that. Kids out there by themselves. Have you forgotten all about the past and realize what that is you're feeling right now? It's materializing before you day by day. Let that be the center of whatever. Let the rest of the things go away. They're going to perish anyhow. Oh, just keep following after him. As Elisha followed Elijah, let's follow him for we must be taken up too someday. We've seen the chariot of fire that lifted him out of the grave. We feel it among us now. What do you feel this morning, church? I'm not trying to hype up your emotion. I'm trying to make you understand. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Tell Brother Ben, you preach passionately. I do that because I feel passionately about it. &gt;&gt; I don't do that just to do it. But if I don't believe it, you won't believe it. &gt;&gt; But we seen the chariot of fire. We feel it among us someday. We should not discount what we feel in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Moses took off his shoes and said, "I'm a man that can't speak." Paul fell on the ground and the Bible said he was trembling and astonished in the presence of God. Why? By faith, they saw what that was. They recognized what it was. It didn't do much for the people that were with Paul, but it did a lot for Paul. church. &gt;&gt; We feel it among us now. Someday he's going to unhook the horses for I love that image. &gt;&gt; It's as though we're already ready to go home. We're already loaded up in that same pillar of fire where that it's in our souls. The the the the chariot that we're riding into heaven in is just hooked to the bushes. &gt;&gt; Someday we're going up. He's referencing Elijah's chariot of fire. Look at the day we're living in. What's promised for this day? Where are we? pillar of fire moves. The children of Israel are moved with the pillar of fire. We got to move with the word. Brand talked about how the people were getting so slothful. I'm not here to beat you over the head this morning, but he said that shows where the people's hearts are. You can tell them these things are wrong. They think you're crazy. Lovers of pleasure. The Bible said more than lovers of God. He said, "But the greatest pleasure I know of is to be to pray until I can realize I'm in the presence of God and recognize it." He said, "I think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit. Seeing the God that made the promise standing among us. Feel his presence. See his word. See it vindicated that ought to give faith to make cripples walk. Blind see deaf hear dumb speak. &gt;&gt; And he talks about how the gifts of God are not something that's just played with. The gifts of God are gracious and they're weary. They're wear. And the presence of God is not shouting. The presence of God, that's just God's blessings. That's the effects of his presence. But that's not the presence of God. Presence of God is a troublesome thing. Listen, when you feel the presence of God, the first thing you might think is, "Oh, woe, it's me." &gt;&gt; Listen, look at Isaiah in the temple. He come in the temple because he's troubled by the things that had happened with the king Uzziah. He walks into the temple that day in Isaiah chapter 6. And the Bible said he saw the Lord high and lifted up. Can you see him that way this morning by eyes of faith? I am lifted up. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; His train filled the temple. The cherubam flew crying holy, holy, holy to the Lord. Can you see that in your in your mind's eye this morning? Can you see him fly them flying in the presence of God? Isaiah entered into that presence and when he did, he said, "Woe, it's me. I'm a man of unclean lips. I dwell among a people of unclean lips." Oh, but I'm so glad that the cherubam went and took the tongs from the altar and picked up a coal and brought it to his lips and cleansed his lips. And he said, "Who will go and speak? Who will go for us?" And and Isaiah said, "Here am I. Send me." It inspired him to service. Listen, he was there all the time. He would Isaiah was a prophet. He knew the presence of God. But at that moment, it inspired something in him that he would it would always be there. Sometimes he comes in a special way to anoint our faith to show us that he's still God. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Well, I trust that somebody this morning would have their burning bush experience. Maybe you serve God halfway. Maybe you've given it half of it. Half of what you got, and you just given a a short of an effort, but not all of it. I pray that this morning the Moses was 80 years old when the pillar of fire got a hold of him. I pray that same fire would get a hold of you this morning that you would recognize he's still God. It is something for you to do. &gt;&gt; We have not been called to just sit still. &gt;&gt; He has come to anoint our faith to get us to do something. &gt;&gt; As I was listening, as we're closing this morning, I was watching part of Brother Biscll's testimony. We'd been with Brother Brandham and he just passed away on Wednesday. And some of you watched it. I actually shared it. But it was he talked about being on the log with brother Bham and he had three questions. Brother Brandham told him what they were. Answered those questions. But he also talked about being in a car and they're hunting. See, I'm not totally against hunting. I'm not much of a hunter, but I I'm gonna try to identify with some of y'all and grow a beard. We'll see how that goes. But, you know, I know that people here love to hunt, men of the wilderness, but they were hunting. And brother Eddie said that brother Brandon was in the car and the and the spirit of the Lord came down. He said that same pillar of fire came down right in the car. &gt;&gt; You realize how that would change our lives if we could in ordinary moments &gt;&gt; recognize the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And and it's it's one thing and brother Bisl wouldn't have this as part of his testimony. But it's one thing to for the prophet to feel it. It's another thing for brother Bisll to recognize it &gt;&gt; because if you listen to that testimony, there was somebody else in the car, &gt;&gt; but it didn't maybe affect them in the same way. &gt;&gt; But brother Bisc was in the car and he said, "Brother Brandon, his face changed. He's leaning back." Brother Brandon was driving and just under the influence of that presence. And you can go listen to the whole testimony. But as he's driving, a moose stepped out in front of him on the gravel road they were on in Canada. a moose stepped out in front of him. Eddie hunted at that time to have food for his family. He needed that moose. And so he he said, "Brother Brand, that's a moose that I need for my family." He said, "Let me jump out and and kill it." And he said he was afraid because even though it was a gravel road, it was the major highway to Alaska. And he was afraid that that there was uh that somebody would come along and get that moose. He said the moose, he said, stopped right in its tracks. He said he got closer to wild game than he'd ever been and he walked up into the there and he shot that moose and then he he and the other brother they drag or they dragged the moose. The moose was there in the middle of the road. He said that moose walked just far enough to get off of the road fall behind the log. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now we don't think much of that, but brother Biscll is going to have to come back for it. &gt;&gt; Right. So he would have to have it in order to have the meat for his family. I believe when we have a need, God has a way of meeting that need. You may not need a moose this morning. That'd be the last thing I need. I wouldn't know how to clean it. But I believe God can put food in the fridge. I believe God can take care of us. Do we really believe that today? He'll take you do your part. Don't forget your part. Brother Bis still had to shoot the moose. You still got to go out and work. You still got to go out and provide. But God will do his part. Maybe that's what he's waiting on is you to do your part. &gt;&gt; But it fell down just in the spot where he needed it. But brother, it's what brother Bren said to him next that inspired me this morning. He said, "Every time he comes, do you believe he's here this morning?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time he comes, something good happens." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you believe you're a child of God today? Do you believe you're one who's recognized his presence? There may be others who don't feel it. Maybe others who can't see it. There may be others who don't look by eyes of faith. But you come with the bill this morning with eyes of faith. And you know he's here. He promised he would be here. And every time he comes, let's not take a moment in his presence for granted. Let's return our love back to him. Every time he comes, something good happens. Do you believe that he's here? His musician comes. Brotherson, a man that believes in God can see the presence of God, can feel the presence of God, sense the presence of God, and know that he's here. He's here to answer everything that he made promise for in this day. If he promised healing and he did, he's here to make an answer for that today. If he promised salvation and he did, he's here to answer that today. If there's a question in your heart, he's here to answer that question today. &gt;&gt; He is here. And every time he comes, something good happens. [Music] I want us to bow our heads for just a moment. [Music] [Music] All my life I've known it. I could feel his presence. I could sense it. I can remember as a a young child sitting in church just like you're sitting this morning. I knew I wasn't right with God. I'd grab the back of the pews and hold on, try not to go to the altar cuz I didn't want to be embarrassed. There something in my heart. Just wouldn't stop driving. Wouldn't stop pulling. I believe it was the hand of the Lord. We never sought God. He sought us. He found us. So thankful for it today. [Music] I I remember being and feeling the presence of God even as a young man. Even though maybe the situation wasn't perfect, but I knew I knew that he was there. I believe you can feel that same God today. And it's not all about feeling, but when he's here, if by faith you can believe it, then there's something about it that brings that warmth to your heart. It just John Wesley when he went to hear the Moravians preach the gospel because he'd been in that cold formal Church of England religion, he tried to do it by works and John Wesley sat there in that room and he said, "My heart was strangely warmed." Well, I pray that someone sitting here today and your heart would be strangely warmed by that same pillar of fire and you know every time he comes something good happens. I pray it would be this morning something good would happen. What do you have a need of today? Why don't you just hold that in your heart and your mind right now? Every time he comes, if you can believe that he's here, every time. He didn't die with brother Brandham. He didn't die with Brother Biscll. He's still the same God today. He's the same God. The same yesterday, today, and forever. He's the same in Brother Stewart or Brother Joel or whoever's preaching. He's the same God even among the congregation. We're not a we're not a a nican spirit. Where are people who believe in a move of God among the people? He's a God that can meet your need this morning. You hold that need in your heart. The same God, he may not he may not reveal the secret of your heart in in public like he did, but he's able to do it. He's able to reveal the secret of your heart even to you to the things that you need. We don't always know what we need to pray for, but Paul says his spirit prays for us with with with groanings that cannot be uttered. Oh, I pray you'd feel the warmth of his presence today. That it wouldn't be a work cup, but that you would know by faith, I know he's here. I know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Shake off those bonds of those shackles. You You spend so much time out of the presence of God that you just get so cold. I do it, too. I know what it feels like. But come back to the fire. Come back to the place where you can know he's there. Amen. Whatever you have need of, just hold that in your heart this morning. If you need prayer, I'd be glad to pray with you. I believe you can receive it right where you're at this morning. The presence of the Lord is here. Hallelujah. All the time. Oh, just receive it now before we pray. He was there all the time. Oh, I'm so glad you were there in my life, Lord. Waiting patiently. Oh, in life. Hallelujah. I'm glad he was there all the time. Sing him one more time before we pray now. Oh, I'm so glad he was there. Oh, glad you were there, Lord. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad you're still here today, waiting patiently. Oh, thank you, Jesus. All the time. Oh, yes. He's waiting patiently [Music] in line. Hallelujah. He was there. all the time. His presence is here this morning. Just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, oh God, we pray. Lord, we believe in the power of prayer. Lord, you said in your word that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. But you also said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are. Yet he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it didn't rain for three years. Oh God. Oh, we still believe you're the God of Elijah. You're still here today, Lord. I'm not righteous by my own works, but by your blood. These people are not righteous by their own works, but by your blood, Lord. And we call on your name today. We call on the name of Jehovah and Tyra. We call on that same God, the same yesterday, today, and forever. that he would be a reality in our midst. We're not here to play church. We're not here just to have another service. Lord, may you be a reality. May the word be so clear when we hear it, Lord, that revelation would strike our hearts. If we have questions, Lord, I pray that be answered in your presence. If we have a need, Lord, I pray it be met in your presence today. Oh, we're so thankful, Lord. I pray you'd break every spirit of doubt, every spirit of fear, every spirit of depression that would try to come. I pray God that you move right now, Lord, in a mighty way, God, as only you can, Lord Jesus, we believe that you're here and by faith we receive you today in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, he was there. Hallelujah. All the time. Aren't you glad that he was? Oh, waiting patiently in line. Hallelujah. He was there all the time. Can we raise our hands to him now and worship him? Oh, he is here. Hallelujah. all the time. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, I know you were there. Hallelujah. All the time. Thank you, Lord. Oh, waiting patiently [Music] life. [Music] Oh, he was there. He was there all the time. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, he is here. Amen. If you believe it, why don't you stand to your feet and receive it today? He is here. Holy, holy, I will bless. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. I will bless your name again. Hear his ear. Won't you listen closely? Oh, hear him call. Oh, Granny Lord Jesus, young people, hear him call your name this morning. He is here. The elder is here to call your name. He's here to heal you. He's here to help you. You will never for the same. Sing it one more time. Don't you feel his warmth over you now? He is here. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, we believe it today. Oh, he is here. Oh, amen. Oh, he is here. Holy, holy, I will bless. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, he is here. Won't you listen closely? Hear him call. Ling out your name. He's here. Oh, touch him. You will never be the same sometimes. Hallelujah. Sometimes praise the Lord. Just lift your hands to him and thank him for being here today. Sometimes gently singing. Thank you Lord for meeting me in your word. Lord a cold sometimes. Hallelujah. Sometimes hallelujah [Music] sometimes. Praise the Lord. Oh, sometimes gently singing [Music] our hearts in one accord. One more time. Oh, sometimes Hallelujah. Oh, sometimes praise the Lord. Sometimes gently singing. Sometimes gently singing. Our hearts in one accord. Oh yes Lord. Oh sometimes I Hallelujah.

Sing with all your heart now. Amen. Oh I need thee. Oh, I need thee every hour of every day. Oh, every hour I need thee. Hallelujah. Oh, won't you bless me now? Oh, my savior. Oh, I come.
