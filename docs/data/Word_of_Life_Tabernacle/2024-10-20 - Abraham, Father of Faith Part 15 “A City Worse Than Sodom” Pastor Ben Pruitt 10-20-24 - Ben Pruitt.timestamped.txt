[42:19] makes you a little bit uh worried about
[42:21] catching a cold but uh but we didn't and
[42:24] so we're thankful for that and then but
[42:26] they had a wonderful meeting and the
[42:28] people just were really blessed seemed
[42:29] like over there and that's continuing
[42:31] this morning we'll close this morning so
[42:33] we're praying for them Genesis Chapter
[42:35] 18 and verse 16 the men rose up from
[42:38] then and looked toward
[42:40] Sodom and Abraham went with them to
[42:43] bring them on the way and the Lord said
[42:47] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[42:49] which I do seeing that Abraham shall
[42:53] surely become a great and mighty nation
[42:56] and all the nations of the Earth shall
[42:58] be blessed in him said for I know him
[43:03] that he will command his children and
[43:05] his household after him and they shall
[43:08] keep the way of the Lord to do justice
[43:11] and judgment that the Lord may bring
[43:13] upon
[43:14] Abraham that which he has spoken of him
[43:18] I pray the Lord would add his Blessing
[43:19] to the word you may be
[43:23] seated eser these may be off like the
[43:26] the speaker itself might be turned off
[43:29] so if you could come check
[43:33] that we'll just all watch her as she
[43:36] comes up
[43:40] front you know when Abraham was
[43:43] receiving his visitation from Elohim
[43:47] life in Sodom goes on as usual there's
[43:51] no change there's no difference in uh in
[43:55] in it is it on showing on that power
[43:58] strip right there behind there might
[44:00] turn it on y'all forgive us this morning
[44:03] we don't know what we're
[44:04] doing life in Sodom goes on as usual
[44:09] when the Elohim is coming in a body of
[44:11] Flesh to Abraham to uh to bring to him a
[44:16] message that would change his body and
[44:19] you would think that something that uh
[44:21] great that would happen would actually
[44:24] uh would actually cause Sodom to sit up
[44:27] and notice that that they would know
[44:29] that he was there but they didn't know
[44:31] they went on doing whatever they would
[44:33] normally have done during that time they
[44:37] never knew because the angel that come
[44:39] to Abraham was only to the elect group
[44:43] he did not come to the World At Large he
[44:46] did not come uh to the uh to the
[44:49] sodomites he didn't come to gomorra he
[44:51] didn't come to the rest of the world he
[44:54] only came to uh AB Abraham the elect
[44:57] group and I'm so thankful that God
[45:00] thought enough of us that he sent a
[45:01] message our way that would come and
[45:04] actually would speak directly to the
[45:07] elect and the fact that you and I have
[45:10] heard that and that ought to make us the
[45:12] most happy people in the world that we
[45:14] could say Lord you spoke to me you
[45:17] brought a message my direction you came
[45:19] down to where I was aren't you glad for
[45:22] that today how many are happy that he
[45:24] come your to your house he come in your
[45:26] direction there it is he come down where
[45:28] you are amen oh I'm so thankful for that
[45:32] today I'm so thankful that he that he
[45:35] came to where I was and when he came to
[45:38] where I was he did not give he did not
[45:41] just uh just leave me in my condition
[45:43] but he changed me and he changed Abraham
[45:46] and Sarah from what they were back to a
[45:49] young man and woman
[45:51] again
[45:53] so uh now you're going to have to come
[45:55] turn this one down
[45:59] but we know a few things about
[46:02] Sodom Sodom was
[46:05] affluent it was affluent we know that
[46:08] the plain of Sodom was well watered
[46:11] everywhere the Bible says the soil was
[46:15] rich and the people had money and they
[46:18] had time to spare the Bible tells us
[46:21] that they were extremely sinful in
[46:24] Genesis 13:13 but the men of Sodom were
[46:27] Wicked and sinners before the Lord
[46:31] exceedingly now we know that the sin
[46:33] that they were known for was actually
[46:36] homosexuality but that is not the the
[46:39] cause of their that's the symptom of the
[46:42] sin that they were engaging in it's not
[46:45] a cause of it it's a symptom of it and
[46:48] so but we know that they were proud even
[46:50] of that extreme you know when a when a
[46:53] society gets to that point where there's
[46:55] so much perversion
[46:57] that it's not only accepted but it's
[46:59] celebrated you know that Society has
[47:02] completely fallen and it's about to it's
[47:04] about to go completely away and we know
[47:07] that that's what happened in in Sodom in
[47:09] Isaiah 3:9 it says the show of their
[47:11] countenance doth witness against them he
[47:14] said and they declare their sin as Sodom
[47:18] so in other words they're they're not
[47:19] ashamed of it they're they're proud of
[47:22] it and we literally have a month that in
[47:24] this in this day and age is called Pride
[47:27] month right and it's actually when they
[47:30] celebrate
[47:31] perversion and that's what they were
[47:33] doing in Sodom it's the same thing that
[47:35] they were doing there but I'm so glad
[47:37] that Abraham wasn't involved in that but
[47:40] he had another he had another way he had
[47:43] another place that uh that another thing
[47:45] that God had called him to so now uh in
[47:49] in in this we know that lot was in Sodom
[47:52] and we know that somehow they in Sodom
[47:55] while all this is going on with Abraham
[47:57] we know that Sodom was actually uh was
[48:00] actually uh uh in in a place where uh
[48:04] they were continuing on and and and lot
[48:06] was in the city and the Bible tells us
[48:08] he's set in the gate brother random
[48:10] calls him the mayor of the city he's
[48:13] actually the mayor of the city he's the
[48:16] one in charge of the business of the
[48:19] city and being that he's in charge of
[48:21] the business of the city lot is sitting
[48:24] there and he's watching all of this
[48:25] going on he's watching the men marrying
[48:28] men and he's watching the transgender
[48:30] movement and he's watching the pride of
[48:33] that City and he's watching are you with
[48:35] me this morning he's watching all of
[48:37] that and it bothers him he's not okay
[48:40] with it he he's not he it's not that
[48:43] he's actually uh that he's actually in a
[48:46] place where uh where he's enjoying it
[48:49] he's not enjoying it at all it bothers
[48:51] him that it's going on it bothers him
[48:55] that that it that it's actually uh that
[48:58] it's actually uh going on at that moment
[49:02] Now esther where'd you
[49:05] go now this is bothering me you going
[49:07] have to turn it back
[49:09] off this one on this
[49:11] side come on you can do
[49:15] it don't you hate wouldn't you hate to
[49:17] be a preacher's kid I tell you
[49:21] what but it bothered a lot maybe this is
[49:24] a good illustration right here
[49:28] it bothered him but he didn't do nothing
[49:30] about
[49:31] it right now the Bible tells us in
[49:34] second Peter
[49:35] 2:6 that he he turning the cities of
[49:38] Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned
[49:41] them with an overthrow making them an
[49:44] example unto those that after should
[49:46] live ungodly thank you and delivered
[49:50] just lot we don't need microphones
[49:52] anyway I know you can hear me out there
[49:54] I just can't hear myself he said
[49:56] delivered just lot vexed with the filthy
[50:00] conversation of the wicked that
[50:02] conversation there is lifestyle so lot
[50:05] looked out at what they were doing and
[50:08] it vexed his righteous Soul it says for
[50:11] that righteous man dwelling among them
[50:14] in seeing and hearing and looking on
[50:16] Facebook and looking looking out on at
[50:19] the companies that were celebrating
[50:21] these things it vexed his righteous soul
[50:23] from day to day with their unlawful
[50:25] deeds and I think sometimes we look at
[50:27] that and say Well only the elect are
[50:29] vexed by that no even many men in
[50:32] denominational circles many men and
[50:35] women that are out here in these
[50:36] churches they're vexed by it but they
[50:39] can't do anything about it and many of
[50:42] them won't even speak up about it in
[50:44] their own
[50:46] churches vexed means
[50:49] tormented lot was actually tormented by
[50:54] the things that were going on oh church
[50:58] he he was his every time he saw it it
[51:00] bothered him just made him sick at his
[51:03] stomach but brother brand said the Bible
[51:05] said the sins of Sodom Vex the righteous
[51:08] soul of lot daily he but he just didn't
[51:10] have the plain nerve enough to stand out
[51:13] against
[51:14] it oh Church it it takes some nerve to
[51:18] stand against
[51:19] something but we've got to do it we
[51:22] don't do it because I I don't stand
[51:25] against uh error you know in in Doctrine
[51:28] because you all know me I want to get
[51:29] along with everybody I want there to be
[51:31] Unity I want that to happen but we got
[51:33] to stand for something we got to stand
[51:36] for something we don't stand against
[51:38] these things because we just like want
[51:39] to be different from people God help us
[51:41] if that's our purpose but we stand
[51:43] against sin because sin will not be
[51:46] tolerated by God and we know where that
[51:48] takes people we know what the end of
[51:51] that is he said well just let them do
[51:52] what they want to do but we know what if
[51:54] you don't stand against it then you
[51:56] don't
[51:58] care about
[52:00] people
[52:03] so he was vexed but he didn't speak out
[52:08] he was
[52:09] tormented but he couldn't say
[52:12] nothing how many of you ever known
[52:14] people like
[52:15] that huh they they they they know it's
[52:18] wrong many people will tell you you'll
[52:20] get in a conversation something like
[52:21] this well I know it's the end time right
[52:24] it's the end time and it being the end
[52:27] time they they recognize that the sin
[52:30] has grown to a point where it it's not
[52:33] sustainable
[52:35] anymore but yet they don't know what to
[52:37] do about it and they can't speak out
[52:40] against it because it's in their own
[52:41] family it's in their own church it's in
[52:44] their own Community it's in their own
[52:46] neighborhood and we'd all like to pre or
[52:50] we we'd all like to pretend that these
[52:52] things didn't happen right around us but
[52:54] they do
[52:57] now I'm just kind of building a
[52:58] foundation for where we want to go this
[53:00] morning but lot knew that it was wrong
[53:03] but he didn't have the nerve to stand
[53:04] out against it and brother Bram types
[53:07] that to a a a pastor in a congregation
[53:10] that sees people that are doing wrong
[53:12] won't say nothing about it he said look
[53:14] at their Congregation of bobhair women
[53:15] they know the Bible condemns it look
[53:17] going down the street a thrown church
[53:19] members going down the street with
[53:20] shorts on they know the word is against
[53:22] it but they haven't got the nerve to
[53:24] call out against it but yet the man
[53:26] profess to be a Christian his soul
[53:27] within him cries out against it but he
[53:30] hasn't got the nerve if that ain't
[53:31] modern Sodom where's it at and you know
[53:35] that's the truth because when you go out
[53:37] into the world today I've met many good
[53:39] men who pastored churches and if they
[53:41] were hold inness men to begin with they
[53:43] knew those things were wrong but they
[53:46] had two choices either have no church at
[53:48] all right or allow it to happen because
[53:52] everybody's going to leave but why can
[53:54] we preach it when others can't why are
[53:56] we we able to preach the word when many
[53:58] are afraid to do it why are we able to
[54:00] because we're preaching to the elect
[54:03] group we're preaching to a people who
[54:04] are not caught up in Sodom but you've
[54:06] heard the message of the hour and you
[54:08] heard the truth of the day and so your
[54:10] soul responds to it yeah you'd like to
[54:13] get along with everybody you'd like for
[54:14] everything just to go along smoothly but
[54:17] you know there's something in your heart
[54:19] that won't let you be like that you were
[54:21] called to do something different than
[54:24] that amen
[54:26] so the sin of Sodom fects his righteous
[54:30] soul brother Brandon said his soul cries
[54:32] out but he said he hasn't got the nerve
[54:34] if that ain't modern Sodom where is it
[54:35] at God give us somebody that'll cry out
[54:38] against it he said like John the Baptist
[54:41] said the axis laid to the root of the
[54:43] tree that's what we need today L is a
[54:46] type of the denominational Church down
[54:47] in Sodom he said watch the Bible says
[54:50] that the sins of Sodom vexed his
[54:51] righteous Soul daily why didn't you have
[54:53] nerve enough to stand out against it he
[54:55] said there's many a good man sitting in
[54:57] a church today looking out seeing women
[54:59] with shorts on men doing these things
[55:00] and their members going playing golf on
[55:02] Sunday and picnic parties and swimming
[55:04] and things instead of attending church I
[55:06] don't have a thing against swimming I
[55:08] don't have a thing against golf I don't
[55:09] have a thing against a picnic but if
[55:11] you're doing it instead of going to
[55:12] church you got a
[55:14] problem right but he said there's men
[55:15] that won't speak out against that why he
[55:18] said sitting home on Wednesday night
[55:19] watching television instead of attending
[55:21] church they feel like saying something
[55:23] about it but the board would put them
[55:25] out what's the matter it's lot again
[55:27] looking out his window and seeing the
[55:29] sin and afraid to call Sin
[55:31] Sin he said Abraham wasn't in their
[55:36] mess Hallelujah he was out of it oh I'm
[55:40] so glad of that today he was a type of
[55:42] the
[55:43] spiritual
[55:45] church right and that's I'll be honest
[55:48] with you that's why some people don't
[55:49] want a pastor they just don't want
[55:50] nobody to call out against it but as
[55:53] long as I'm in this body God help me
[55:57] I love each and every one of you but if
[55:59] I love you I got to tell you the truth
[56:00] God help me to cry out against
[56:05] it as bad as Sodom was we know they were
[56:09] bad right when you think of Sodom it
[56:11] just makes you feel
[56:13] icky it does the name's just
[56:19] uh it's bad and of course gomorah was
[56:23] there with it and other cities of the
[56:25] plane
[56:26] but there are two cities named in the
[56:29] Bible as worse than Sodom do you know
[56:33] that two cities that are worse than
[56:36] Sodom you find one in Ezekiel chapter 16
[56:40] where Ezekiel actually CS or God speaks
[56:43] to Ezekiel and he says tell
[56:46] Jerusalem that they're worse than
[56:50] Sodom Jerusalem worse than Sodom now we
[56:55] feel pretty good standing here and
[56:56] saying well we stand against
[56:58] homosexuality we stand against
[57:00] perversion we stand against ungodly
[57:02] living and we do but there is actually a
[57:06] c there were cities worse than Sodom
[57:10] that were much more religious than Sodom
[57:13] but they were worse in their sin so
[57:16] Ezekiel presents Jerusalem as the
[57:18] adulterous wife of Jehova in Ezekiel
[57:20] chapter 16 we won't read it all you can
[57:23] go back and read it when you have time
[57:24] but Ezekiel 1648 he said as I live
[57:27] sayith the Lord God Sodom thy sister
[57:29] hath not done She nor her daughters as
[57:32] thou Hast done thou and thy daughters
[57:35] now look at this verse 49 behold this
[57:38] was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom
[57:41] Pride fullness of bread and abundance of
[57:45] idleness was in her and in her daughters
[57:49] neither did she strengthen the hand of
[57:51] the poor and the needy so he he goes
[57:55] back and and everybody knew what sodom's
[57:57] main sin was or what the fruit was of
[58:00] what they did what who the fruits were
[58:02] if you can say it that way everybody
[58:04] knew what what that was but but people
[58:07] didn't recognize what caused it what the
[58:10] condition
[58:12] was and the condition that existed in
[58:16] Sodom exists in America too and it
[58:20] existed before the sodomites become a
[58:23] widespread thing before the homosexual
[58:25] move movement become a widespread thing
[58:28] even back when people mainly spoke out
[58:31] against that and were against that even
[58:34] during that time they uh uh the the the
[58:39] conditions existed in America what was
[58:41] it
[58:43] pride fullness of
[58:45] bread abundance of
[58:49] idleness and a refusal to help when
[58:53] someone needed help God help us we don't
[58:56] act that same
[58:58] way I was so thankful this week because
[59:02] of all the that you gave for the flood
[59:04] victims those that you know but we know
[59:05] our first responsibility is for the
[59:07] church and there were some folks here
[59:09] and and brother Bill and sister Karen
[59:10] I've been trying to get to them and and
[59:12] and go see them and I just haven't had
[59:14] time with running back and forth and
[59:15] doing the things we're doing and I know
[59:17] some of you did and you took on meals
[59:19] and things and I'm so grateful for
[59:21] that why because you you're caring I
[59:24] don't have to tell you to do that you
[59:25] car care about people you care about
[59:28] people and I believe this is a church
[59:29] that cares about people and so we what
[59:34] creates that desire to help one another
[59:36] it's something in your heart that that
[59:38] that is put there you're not like the
[59:40] world you're not like the world when we
[59:42] say we're not like the world we we often
[59:45] look at our dress and we say well I
[59:46] don't wear a short tight skirts and I
[59:48] don't wear I don't wear tight shirts and
[59:51] I don't I don't men or women I if I'm a
[59:54] man I dress like a man if I'm a woman I
[59:55] dress just like a woman but that's not
[59:57] all together although that's part of it
[59:59] that's not alt together what it means to
[1:00:01] not be like the world but it means you
[1:00:03] care when they don't care it means you
[1:00:05] love one another when they don't love
[1:00:07] one another it means that you that you
[1:00:10] have a forgiveness in your heart when
[1:00:11] they hold grudges against one another to
[1:00:14] not be like the world means you're like
[1:00:17] Christ are you with me
[1:00:19] now and you you exhibit those virtues in
[1:00:23] your life
[1:00:26] so he identifies those conditions that
[1:00:29] exist and you find those same conditions
[1:00:32] in Rome at the at the time when Jesus
[1:00:35] was born those same conditions if you
[1:00:38] study history and you find them in
[1:00:40] modern day America so we find that this
[1:00:44] condition that the sodomites were in was
[1:00:48] birthed from a pride and soft living
[1:00:51] from pride and soft living and we find a
[1:00:54] a parallel to that in the Ley in church
[1:00:57] age which again is worse because it's in
[1:00:59] the
[1:01:00] church but Revelation 3:17 because thou
[1:01:03] sayth now he's not talking to the World
[1:01:06] At Large he's talking to the church age
[1:01:09] of
[1:01:09] leoa because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:01:13] increased with goods and have need of
[1:01:15] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[1:01:16] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:01:18] blind and
[1:01:21] naked church we got something I got
[1:01:23] something on my heart this morning I
[1:01:25] want you to see
[1:01:27] we don't want to be caught up in that we
[1:01:29] don't want to be part of that we want to
[1:01:31] be part of that elect group that's
[1:01:33] receiving Revelation that's repeating on
[1:01:35] the me message of the
[1:01:38] hour look he said I counsel thee to buy
[1:01:40] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:01:43] mayest be rich and white rment that thou
[1:01:45] mayest be clothed that the shame of thy
[1:01:47] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:01:50] eyes with Isa that thou mayest
[1:01:54] see now but the random tells us that
[1:01:57] each age had its
[1:01:59] pressures and you talk about pressure if
[1:02:02] you go back to the Dark Ages when they
[1:02:04] were being killed for being Christians
[1:02:07] by other Christians many in many times
[1:02:10] when they were being killed and they
[1:02:12] would be put on the rack and stretch
[1:02:13] that's
[1:02:15] pressure right they'd say now okay if
[1:02:18] you don't if you won't bow to the church
[1:02:20] and say that Mary is the mother of God
[1:02:22] and worship idols then we're literally
[1:02:25] going to stretch you out until the limbs
[1:02:28] come out of your body and we're going to
[1:02:30] torture you until you confess you say
[1:02:34] that didn't happen that really did
[1:02:35] happen I've got a copy of Fox's book of
[1:02:38] Martyrs right back there in my office
[1:02:40] and you can read that it actually
[1:02:42] happened historically to millions of
[1:02:45] people and and there was blood on the
[1:02:47] hands of the Catholic church for doing
[1:02:49] that right because they they created
[1:02:52] that condition that was pressure but I
[1:02:55] say we have a greater pressure in this
[1:02:58] age because it's more
[1:03:01] deceptive brother Brandon said a great
[1:03:03] burden of the last stage is the pressure
[1:03:05] of
[1:03:06] riches now there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:09] being
[1:03:10] rich it's not money that's the root of
[1:03:12] all evil it's the love of
[1:03:15] money right it's not riches that create
[1:03:19] but it's the pressure of
[1:03:21] riches right it's the pressure of riches
[1:03:24] because with a greater standing in the
[1:03:25] Community comes a pressure that you may
[1:03:28] not want to really identify as a child
[1:03:31] of God anymore and that's what lot was
[1:03:33] under was the pressure of riches the
[1:03:35] pressure of living in Sodom where once
[1:03:38] maybe if he was up there with Abraham he
[1:03:40] could have identified with him and he
[1:03:42] would have said yeah them I would never
[1:03:44] be around them sodomites I would never
[1:03:46] let my daughters be subject to that I'd
[1:03:48] never let my children be subject to that
[1:03:50] but when he got around them there was a
[1:03:52] pressure that come from living in
[1:03:54] Sodom there was a pressure that come
[1:03:56] from being around him all the time and
[1:03:58] so the pressure of riches got to him and
[1:04:01] he couldn't speak out he was still God's
[1:04:05] man a righteous man but he wasn't the
[1:04:09] elect we've been called to something
[1:04:11] else now notice the pressure of riches
[1:04:15] and soft living you say brother Ben I
[1:04:18] live in Hardy Arkansas it only it only
[1:04:21] gets living only gets so soft in
[1:04:23] Arkansas
[1:04:26] but at the same time compared to other
[1:04:31] cultures compared to other people and
[1:04:33] I've been there some of y'all have been
[1:04:35] there you've been over some of y'all
[1:04:36] been overseas I know brother Herold has
[1:04:38] brother Mike has some of y'all been
[1:04:40] brother Allen's been to Alaska some of
[1:04:42] y'all been places you've seen some
[1:04:44] things and you've seen some people that
[1:04:47] did that had a hard living living in
[1:04:49] areas where it's winter all the time
[1:04:53] right why people would that's why no one
[1:04:55] retires up North you know and that
[1:04:57] there's a certain there's a certain
[1:04:59] pressure that comes with that or a
[1:05:01] certain amount of hard living there's
[1:05:02] amount of there's some hard living that
[1:05:04] goes with uh being in a society where
[1:05:07] there's corruption and graft although
[1:05:08] we're seeing that in our society but but
[1:05:11] it used to not be that way and we've got
[1:05:13] a remarkable political system up till
[1:05:17] now that's worked remarkably well he
[1:05:20] said brother Ben how can you say that
[1:05:22] because I've seen how the others
[1:05:24] work right and I've seen how they treat
[1:05:27] you if you're an American I've seen how
[1:05:29] they treat you and I've seen the way
[1:05:31] Egypt works I've seen the way West
[1:05:33] Africa works I've seen I've seen how it
[1:05:36] works in Asia I've seen it firsthand and
[1:05:38] I know the corruption and the things
[1:05:40] that are there and thank God for our
[1:05:41] country thank God for America I wouldn't
[1:05:44] want to live that way but with that soft
[1:05:47] living with those nice seats in your car
[1:05:50] I don't want to take a show hands
[1:05:52] embarrass you but how many of you have
[1:05:53] uh air conditioned seats
[1:05:59] several of you I love those
[1:06:03] things you know the invention of heated
[1:06:05] seats never did a thing for me but air
[1:06:08] conditioned
[1:06:10] seats changed my
[1:06:12] life my truck don't have them but her
[1:06:16] Britney's vehicle
[1:06:18] does and that's just if that went out I
[1:06:20] don't know what I'd do because I've
[1:06:22] gotten so used to that man I enjoy that
[1:06:25] soft
[1:06:26] living right it's not that it's wrong
[1:06:29] but it creates a pressure where you're
[1:06:32] never
[1:06:34] uncomfortable and if we are
[1:06:36] uncomfortable we seek
[1:06:38] Comfort right if we don't like to a
[1:06:41] certain place to eat we just go find
[1:06:42] somewhere else where you realize most of
[1:06:45] the world doesn't live that way they go
[1:06:48] eat where they
[1:06:49] can right we go eat where we want to
[1:06:53] even the poorest Among Us for the most
[1:06:55] part we don't eat what we don't want to
[1:06:58] eat huh we can buy what I was raised
[1:07:01] without air conditioning we were raised
[1:07:03] in our in our room mom and dad got a
[1:07:05] window unit for their room and man I was
[1:07:07] envious we were not allowed in their
[1:07:10] room so you just you talk about
[1:07:13] suffering when it's 100 degrees forgive
[1:07:15] me mom was 100 degrees outside and I
[1:07:17] knew that air conditioner was on in that
[1:07:19] room and it was so hot in the house but
[1:07:23] but you didn't think that much about it
[1:07:25] because because because that was just
[1:07:27] the way we lived but try to do without
[1:07:29] air conditioning now I mean I'm
[1:07:31] suffering this morning just because it's
[1:07:33] hot on the platform and I don't have
[1:07:35] monitors soft
[1:07:38] living are you with me now aren't you
[1:07:41] glad we've got the things that we do
[1:07:44] brother Isaac you've got uh things at
[1:07:46] your house and I know brother Isaac
[1:07:48] doesn't have a lot of money but he's got
[1:07:49] things at his house that the people in
[1:07:51] Africa would love to have right that
[1:07:54] that that that coffee machine nice isn't
[1:07:56] it and there's some things that are
[1:07:57] really nice at brother Isaac's house and
[1:08:00] and those of us even the poorest among
[1:08:02] us we got nice things but it creates a
[1:08:05] pressure and when we come to the house
[1:08:07] of God it's the preaching makes us a
[1:08:08] little bit
[1:08:10] uncomfortable we get nervous because
[1:08:13] we're so used to comfort but I think we
[1:08:16] need to get uncomfortable now and then
[1:08:19] we need to feel the prick of the Holy
[1:08:21] Spirit now and then it says when Peter
[1:08:22] got up and preached that sermon in Acts
[1:08:24] 2 it says they were PR in their
[1:08:26] hearts they were wounded in their Spirit
[1:08:29] they said Lord what can we do to be
[1:08:33] saved sometimes that's what it takes we
[1:08:36] got to get a little bit uncomfortable so
[1:08:38] we can receive from God God help us
[1:08:41] today so once again soft living listen
[1:08:45] what he says about I want to read the
[1:08:46] rest of that quote because it's
[1:08:46] important he say soft living and nervous
[1:08:49] tensions in a complex age so I'm not
[1:08:54] saying it's easy I know it's not I live
[1:08:56] under the same pressure you do that's
[1:08:58] why God calls men that live under the
[1:09:00] same conditions you live under to come
[1:09:03] and preach the word to you because it's
[1:09:06] more than just a word I could just stand
[1:09:07] up here and read scriptures or stand up
[1:09:09] here and read quotes and it would still
[1:09:11] what is coming out of the mouth of
[1:09:12] somebody who lives in the same world and
[1:09:14] has to overcome the same Devils you
[1:09:18] overcome I've got to do it just like you
[1:09:21] do now look it nervous tensions and
[1:09:24] accompl Le age that we seem unfitted to
[1:09:28] live
[1:09:29] in it seems like we're just not able to
[1:09:34] do it and so many young people get
[1:09:35] discouraged and even commit suicide or
[1:09:38] do something like that I'll say to you
[1:09:40] young people your life is always worth
[1:09:42] living you're valuable to God you mean
[1:09:45] something to
[1:09:50] God once again soft living has created
[1:09:53] the perfect conditions for a society to
[1:09:56] be so full of sin that a holy God is
[1:09:59] bound to destroy them and a prophet of
[1:10:02] God stood in our hand or in our day and
[1:10:04] said the hour is at hand great
[1:10:07] destructions are laying ahead worse than
[1:10:10] Sodom and gamor for this
[1:10:15] country brother random often quoted Jack
[1:10:18] Moore who said that if God lets this
[1:10:20] country get by with their sins you'll
[1:10:22] have to raise Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:10:24] apologize to
[1:10:26] them brother brandom says it this way
[1:10:28] you're bound for judgment there's no
[1:10:30] other way to accept it write it down in
[1:10:32] your Bibles he said I'm getting to be an
[1:10:34] old man listen to this you see if it
[1:10:37] doesn't go to judgment he said if I live
[1:10:40] a normal life I'll see at normal time
[1:10:44] another few
[1:10:45] years will turn
[1:10:48] it will'll turn it what's been
[1:10:51] turned what's being turned what's
[1:10:55] happening is we we've turned to judgment
[1:10:58] the nation and the people don't even
[1:11:00] recognize it that they've turned away
[1:11:03] from Mercy they've turned away from the
[1:11:06] possibility of
[1:11:07] Revival and turned to judgment now we're
[1:11:11] talking about the Sodom group we're not
[1:11:12] talking about the elected group are you
[1:11:14] with me now we're talking about the
[1:11:16] Sodom group now Jerusalem was worse than
[1:11:21] Sodom because they knew better anduk
[1:11:25] Luke
[1:11:26] 13:34 Jesus is crying out he said oh
[1:11:31] Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the
[1:11:34] prophets and stonest them that are sent
[1:11:36] unto thee how often would I have
[1:11:38] gathered thy children together as a hen
[1:11:41] that gather her brood under her wings
[1:11:43] you would not behold your house is left
[1:11:46] unto you desolate and verily I say unto
[1:11:48] you you shall not see me until the time
[1:11:51] come when you shall say blessed is he
[1:11:53] that cometh in the name of the Lord Lord
[1:11:56] brother brandom says don't you see the
[1:11:58] message of the hour can you recognize
[1:12:00] where we are the message itself from the
[1:12:03] scripture interprets to you the hour
[1:12:05] we're living in it's the interpretation
[1:12:08] listen church we need to get under the
[1:12:09] blood we need to get under the token we
[1:12:11] need to come under the headship of the
[1:12:13] message of the hour we can't live
[1:12:15] without it we'll go down just like
[1:12:17] everybody
[1:12:19] else without this message we're no
[1:12:21] different from lot
[1:12:25] what separated Abraham what separated
[1:12:28] him it was it was his faith and what the
[1:12:30] angel told him separated him God said
[1:12:34] I've forn Abraham I've known him I know
[1:12:36] how he'll teach his
[1:12:40] children brother BR said can't you
[1:12:42] recognize where we are the message
[1:12:45] itself from the scripture interprets to
[1:12:47] you the hour we're living in it's the
[1:12:50] interpretation Jesus said to Israel if
[1:12:52] you had only have known your day one
[1:12:55] time sitting on Mount oliv he looked
[1:12:56] over and said Jerusalem oh Jerusalem he
[1:12:59] wept he looked down he seen he said the
[1:13:01] other morning about 10 o'clock when I
[1:13:03] saw that prostitute Church remember the
[1:13:05] vision that he had how they were going
[1:13:06] out barely dressed he said this is the
[1:13:08] American church and they were dancing
[1:13:10] the rock and roll music and he said oh
[1:13:13] god what have I done and brother Bron
[1:13:15] when I saw that church he said down in
[1:13:17] your heart you feel the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] dropping
[1:13:20] tears Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how of
[1:13:24] would I have hovered you but what did
[1:13:26] you do you killed the prophets that I
[1:13:27] sent to you you murdered them the very
[1:13:30] ones that could have helped you you
[1:13:32] killed them don't you realize that's
[1:13:33] still happening today because people are
[1:13:36] made uncomfortable by the preaching of
[1:13:38] the word they attack the
[1:13:40] messenger they attacked the messenger
[1:13:42] and the messenger's just for saying the
[1:13:44] message he's just giving the
[1:13:46] message right if you got a package you
[1:13:48] didn't like in the mail you wouldn't
[1:13:50] attack the mail delivery guy the maale
[1:13:53] man you wouldn't you wouldn't uh you
[1:13:55] wouldn't attack the FedEx man you
[1:13:58] wouldn't attack the UPS man why you know
[1:14:00] it come from somebody
[1:14:02] else but people attack the messenger
[1:14:04] when it's not the messenger's fault I'm
[1:14:07] just carrying a
[1:14:10] message are you with me
[1:14:12] now Jerusalem he said you feel the Holy
[1:14:15] Spirit dropping tears Jerusalem oh
[1:14:18] Jerusalem how off what I have hovered
[1:14:20] you but what did you do you killed the
[1:14:21] prophets you murdered them he said of
[1:14:23] the messages has been sent to the the
[1:14:25] church today has been murdered by their
[1:14:27] denominational dogmas oh Church don't
[1:14:30] you realize that's what Happ when you
[1:14:31] set something in your mind above the
[1:14:33] word and when the word comes and you
[1:14:35] reject the word in favor of what you
[1:14:37] already got in your mind do you realize
[1:14:38] what you're doing you actually murder
[1:14:40] the
[1:14:42] word you're killing the word because
[1:14:45] here's the word coming to you directly
[1:14:47] from the scripture directly from the
[1:14:49] from the message of the hour and when
[1:14:50] you hear the word and you will not
[1:14:52] receive it you say well it's not for me
[1:14:54] you actually kill the
[1:14:58] word murdered by their dogmas Jesus said
[1:15:02] if you'd have only know your day but
[1:15:03] it's too far now it's too late now he
[1:15:06] said so it is with the
[1:15:09] churches we know Jerusalem will
[1:15:13] repent and I I long for that day I you
[1:15:17] know we won't be here to see that we go
[1:15:20] home in the
[1:15:22] Rapture and then there will be a time
[1:15:25] that's described in Zechariah 12:10 he
[1:15:28] said I will pour upon the House of David
[1:15:30] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:15:32] the spirit of Grace and of Supplication
[1:15:34] and they shall look on me whom they have
[1:15:36] pierced they shall mourn for him as one
[1:15:38] mourneth for his only son and shall be
[1:15:41] in bitterness for him as one that is
[1:15:43] bitterness for his firstborn they're
[1:15:44] going to recognize what they turned down
[1:15:46] why they were blinded for our sakes they
[1:15:49] became worse than Sodom for you and
[1:15:53] me oh Church
[1:15:55] they were treated in such an awful way
[1:15:58] if you think about the things that have
[1:15:59] happened in Jerusalem especially the
[1:16:01] sack of the city by the Roman general
[1:16:03] when he come through there and he
[1:16:04] destroyed and burnt the temple and
[1:16:06] destroyed everything and the people the
[1:16:08] only ones that survived were the
[1:16:09] Christians who got out of there don't
[1:16:12] you realize oh church that that is going
[1:16:14] to be turned back to them again and
[1:16:16] they're going to be given an opportunity
[1:16:18] and 144,000 of them will receive
[1:16:21] it
[1:16:23] amen the second
[1:16:26] city that is spoken of in the scripture
[1:16:29] as
[1:16:29] worse than Sodom is capernium
[1:16:33] capernium now that's kind of random
[1:16:36] isn't it just a little city not a major
[1:16:40] city of the
[1:16:41] Earth but capernium
[1:16:43] Matthew
[1:16:45] 11:23 he said thou capernium which art
[1:16:48] exalted unto Heaven shalt be brought
[1:16:50] down to hell for if the mighty Works
[1:16:53] which have been done in thee have been
[1:16:55] done in Sodom it would have remained
[1:16:57] until this
[1:17:00] day but I say unto you that it should be
[1:17:02] more tolerable for the land of Sodom in
[1:17:05] the day of judgment than for
[1:17:07] thee why it was just a normal City a
[1:17:12] beautiful Seaside Town it was a town
[1:17:15] with a population of Jews but it was
[1:17:16] built by
[1:17:17] Gentiles it was just a normal City it it
[1:17:21] may have been the one of the best cities
[1:17:23] as far as to live in that day in in
[1:17:27] Israel there's no mention of perversion
[1:17:30] in the city of Capernaum no mention of a
[1:17:33] gay rights parade no mention of no
[1:17:36] mention of of a rainbow flag that
[1:17:38] they're using to to promote the pride of
[1:17:40] homosexual no mention of that in fact
[1:17:43] the people that live there whether they
[1:17:45] worship the Roman gods or many Jews that
[1:17:47] live there worship the Jehovah and they
[1:17:50] thought they were doing pretty good and
[1:17:52] they thought they were pretty normal
[1:17:54] people
[1:17:56] but Jesus lived
[1:18:00] there
[1:18:01] now look at look at Matthew chapter
[1:18:04] 4 Matthew
[1:18:07] 4:12 when Jesus heard that John was cast
[1:18:10] into prison he departed into
[1:18:13] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[1:18:15] dwelt in capernium so he come to
[1:18:18] live in capernium which is upon the Sea
[1:18:22] Coast in the borders of zebulun and
[1:18:23] nephelim that it might be fulfilled
[1:18:26] which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet
[1:18:28] saying the land of zebulin the land of
[1:18:30] nepin by the way of the sea Beyond
[1:18:32] Jordan gilee of the Gentiles the people
[1:18:35] which set in darkness saw great light
[1:18:39] and to them which set in the region and
[1:18:42] shadow of death light is sprung up and
[1:18:45] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[1:18:48] to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:18:50] is at hand listen to me church when the
[1:18:52] son of man was revealed in our hour what
[1:18:54] happened when a message come to our day
[1:18:56] it was Jesus Christ coming back to live
[1:18:58] among us again just like he lived among
[1:19:01] them he lived Among Us I'm not just
[1:19:04] talking about brother brandom now
[1:19:05] although he revealed himself in that
[1:19:07] body he borrowed that redeemed body I'm
[1:19:09] talking about a church of
[1:19:11] bride he wants to live in he is living
[1:19:16] in he come to the lost sheep of the
[1:19:18] House of
[1:19:19] Israel in a gentile community and lived
[1:19:23] with them
[1:19:25] five of Jesus 12 disciples were from
[1:19:29] capernium
[1:19:31] Peter Andrew James and John and
[1:19:35] Matthew many of Jesus greatest Miracles
[1:19:39] were performed in capernium I just go
[1:19:43] through a few of them the Roman
[1:19:45] Centurion you remember the one that he
[1:19:49] was he was the Roman Centurion there at
[1:19:51] capernium
[1:19:52] and when Jesus when he sent for Jesus he
[1:19:56] he said his daughter is very sick and
[1:19:59] and he said I'll Jesus said I'll come
[1:20:01] and he said no he said I'm a man under
[1:20:05] Authority and he said I know if you
[1:20:08] speak the word she'll be made whole she
[1:20:11] was made whole in capernium
[1:20:14] oh my Peter's
[1:20:17] mother-in-law lived in capernium so it
[1:20:20] is possible to have a good relationship
[1:20:22] with your mother-in-law because she
[1:20:23] lived with him
[1:20:27] it's all right you can laugh if your
[1:20:29] mother-in-law's sitting here don't laugh
[1:20:33] but Peter's mother-in-law was
[1:20:36] there and when the evening was come it
[1:20:39] says in Matthew 8:16 you remember he
[1:20:41] healed her of a
[1:20:44] fever and when the evening time came
[1:20:47] they brought unto him many that were
[1:20:48] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:20:50] the spirits with his word
[1:20:55] I was reading a man sent from God if you
[1:20:57] haven't read it it was written very
[1:20:58] early in brother bram's Ministry but if
[1:21:00] you read William brandham a man sent
[1:21:02] from God take that and read it and and
[1:21:05] just begin to go over some of the things
[1:21:07] that happened it was so Supernatural but
[1:21:09] one of the things that Jack Moore says
[1:21:10] in that book in his his chapter of that
[1:21:13] book he he wrote in there that he said
[1:21:15] before many of us Pentecostal preachers
[1:21:17] got prayed through brother brandom had
[1:21:20] already had already spoken to the person
[1:21:22] and they were healed said so said before
[1:21:25] we could even get prayed up to begin to
[1:21:26] pray you know and and I'd let you in on
[1:21:29] a little secret sometimes why we pray so
[1:21:30] hard we're praying through so we can
[1:21:34] pray come on church because you you you
[1:21:37] we've got you know you got to be in the
[1:21:38] right attitude and the right atmosphere
[1:21:40] to pray but really we ought to be in
[1:21:42] that way all the time right and brother
[1:21:44] Bram lived in such a channel and such a
[1:21:46] place that he said he could just speak
[1:21:48] to him and they'd be healed and before
[1:21:50] they could even pray he just prayed a
[1:21:52] simple prayer and they were healed
[1:21:55] and so uh that's what Jesus was doing he
[1:21:57] said he he cast out the spirits with his
[1:21:59] word and healed all that were sick do
[1:22:02] you believe he still does it today he
[1:22:04] still cast out Devils brother BR said
[1:22:06] the preaching of the word cast out
[1:22:09] Devils he said that it might be
[1:22:11] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:22:13] prophet saying himself took our
[1:22:15] infirmities and bear our
[1:22:19] sicknesses capernium was his own City
[1:22:23] that's the way it's described in the
[1:22:23] Bible in Matthew 91 it says he entered
[1:22:26] into a ship and passed over and came
[1:22:28] into his own City it was there he healed
[1:22:32] a man with
[1:22:33] py and forgave his sins you remember the
[1:22:37] Pharisees questioned him about it they
[1:22:40] said how can you forgive a man his sins
[1:22:43] Matthew 9:7 says he arose and departed
[1:22:47] to his house he lived in capernium for
[1:22:52] the first part of his ministry but when
[1:22:55] the multitude saw it they marveled and
[1:22:57] glorified God which had given such power
[1:22:59] un men now remember he never had his own
[1:23:03] he had a place where he where he stayed
[1:23:05] I believe he stayed with Peter there in
[1:23:06] capernium so it's not that he owned a
[1:23:08] house because we know he gave all of
[1:23:10] that up for us he said foxes have dens
[1:23:13] but the son of man doesn't have a place
[1:23:14] to lay his head but we know that he
[1:23:16] stayed there with Peter in his
[1:23:19] house so that was he departed to his
[1:23:22] house when the multitude saw it they
[1:23:23] marveled and glorified God which had
[1:23:25] given such power to men it was done
[1:23:27] publicly the whole town
[1:23:29] knew who Jesus was what his address was
[1:23:34] where you could find
[1:23:36] him he called Matthew in capernium as we
[1:23:38] already said he raised gyrus his
[1:23:40] daughter in capernium right so the
[1:23:44] Centurion the the ruler of the
[1:23:47] synagogue right the pastor was a secret
[1:23:50] believer in the
[1:23:53] message oh my
[1:23:55] and so he he he he revealed he was there
[1:23:57] it was near there where he revealed the
[1:23:59] secrets of the heart of the woman who
[1:24:01] touched the Hemm of His Garment these
[1:24:03] are all familiar stories that happened
[1:24:06] near capernium
[1:24:07] they would have known about it they saw
[1:24:09] it publicly they saw him say who touched
[1:24:12] me and revealed the secrets of her
[1:24:16] heart he healed two Blind Men and
[1:24:19] touched a dumb man in capernium and the
[1:24:23] Bible says when the was cast out the
[1:24:25] dumb spake and the multitudes marveled
[1:24:28] saying it was never so seen in Israel
[1:24:31] but the Pharisees said he casteth out
[1:24:34] Devils to the prince of devils those
[1:24:36] Pharisees still alive today they just
[1:24:38] found
[1:24:40] YouTube right they found
[1:24:42] Wikipedia right and that's they still
[1:24:44] criticize the message and the messenger
[1:24:46] but they just found a different
[1:24:48] platform verse 35 said Jesus went about
[1:24:51] all the cities and Villages teaching in
[1:24:53] their synagogues and preaching the
[1:24:54] gospel of the kingdom and healing every
[1:24:57] sickness and every disease among the
[1:25:02] people all the mighty Works were done in
[1:25:04] capernium remember in Nazareth he
[1:25:06] couldn't do many mighty works because of
[1:25:08] their unbelief but when he went to
[1:25:09] capernium he did many mighty Works they
[1:25:13] received a great
[1:25:15] visitation it was in capernium in the
[1:25:18] synagogue that he preached his great
[1:25:20] sermon about the bread of life John
[1:25:23] chapter 6 and verse verse 41 when he got
[1:25:26] done preaching to him he the Jews then
[1:25:28] murmured at him because he said I am the
[1:25:30] bread which come down from heaven and
[1:25:32] they said is not this Jesus the son of
[1:25:34] Joseph whose father and mother we know
[1:25:37] how is it then that he saith I came down
[1:25:39] from
[1:25:40] heaven he said eat my flesh and drink my
[1:25:43] blood it was too much for him these
[1:25:46] things said he John 6:59 go read it I
[1:25:48] don't have time this morning but these
[1:25:49] things said he in the synagogue as he
[1:25:52] taught in
[1:25:54] perum and he said many therefore of his
[1:25:57] disciples verse 60 when they had heard
[1:25:59] this said this is a hard saying who can
[1:26:02] hear it capernium is where his ministry
[1:26:05] turned from healing to the word when he
[1:26:09] left his second pole you know what I'm
[1:26:10] talking about left his second pole for
[1:26:12] the third pole Ministry was in capernium
[1:26:16] and it says from that time many of his
[1:26:19] disciples went back and walked no more
[1:26:21] with him why because of the opening of
[1:26:23] the word
[1:26:24] oh and it's at this moment that he began
[1:26:27] to upgrade the cities wherein most of
[1:26:28] his mighty Works were done because they
[1:26:30] repented not he said wo unto you cor and
[1:26:33] woe unto you beta for if the mighty
[1:26:35] Works which were done you had been done
[1:26:36] in Ty and siden they would have repented
[1:26:38] long ago in sackcloth and Ashes but I
[1:26:40] say to you it should be more tolerable
[1:26:41] for Ty and sidon at the day of judgment
[1:26:43] than for you and thou capernium which
[1:26:46] art exalted un Heaven shall be brought
[1:26:47] down to Hell if the mighty Works which
[1:26:49] have been done they had been done in
[1:26:50] Sodom it would have remained to this day
[1:26:52] but I say unto you it shall be more
[1:26:53] tolerable for the land of Sodom in the
[1:26:55] day of judgment and for the both of
[1:26:57] those cities the populations of those
[1:27:00] cities everybody will come before him on
[1:27:02] that day and the greater judgment will
[1:27:05] go to capernium
[1:27:06] than to
[1:27:10] Sodom now listen to me this morning we
[1:27:13] believe that the son of man revealed
[1:27:17] himself in this day making Jesus Christ
[1:27:20] the same yesterday today
[1:27:24] and
[1:27:25] forever that's what we've been preaching
[1:27:27] about with Abraham it's the revealing of
[1:27:30] the son of man Elohim in a body of
[1:27:35] Flesh listen if capernium was worse than
[1:27:39] Sodom and I prove to you the only thing
[1:27:42] that capernium did is they turned down
[1:27:44] the word after they saw the
[1:27:47] Miracles what about
[1:27:51] Jeffersonville right now we're going to
[1:27:53] bring a little closer to home in a
[1:27:56] minute what about Jefferson I'm not
[1:27:58] talking about the the message people
[1:27:59] there I'm talking about the
[1:28:01] city right what about
[1:28:03] Jeffersonville brother brandom taught us
[1:28:05] that our Lord had more success in the in
[1:28:08] his ministry than he did in his own we
[1:28:11] know that's true just by virtue of time
[1:28:14] brother Jesus was only here for three
[1:28:15] and a half years brother brandom for
[1:28:17] more than 20 years uh went around the
[1:28:21] world and he did that he had more more
[1:28:24] success in the ministry of William
[1:28:25] brandham than he did in his own brother
[1:28:28] Bram said he had more success in the
[1:28:29] Tabernacle than he did in capernium
[1:28:30] remember that when Jesus spoke that
[1:28:33] sermon of the bread of life he was in
[1:28:34] the synagogue of capernium and that's
[1:28:37] why he said woe unto you capernium he
[1:28:39] stood behind that Pulpit preach to those
[1:28:43] people brother brand stood in
[1:28:45] Jeffersonville and preached to those
[1:28:47] people and he said this he had more
[1:28:48] success right here than he did in
[1:28:49] capernium or Nazareth in that he done
[1:28:51] more miracles right here in this
[1:28:53] Tabernacle than he did in the entire
[1:28:55] Ministry on Earth that's right he did it
[1:28:57] he said what about the rest of the world
[1:28:58] Oh my he said now that's what he done
[1:29:00] remember he done it never said I done it
[1:29:02] no because I didn't do it I just loved
[1:29:04] him and just submitted myself to him you
[1:29:06] want to do something for God how many of
[1:29:08] you want to do something for God you
[1:29:09] want to see the presence of God in your
[1:29:11] life you want to see God move and help
[1:29:13] somebody through your life how you going
[1:29:14] to do it how you going to do it just
[1:29:16] submit yourself to him love him
[1:29:20] Hallelujah and said what he said and the
[1:29:23] Holy Spirit went to the other people and
[1:29:25] they believed what he said that's me I
[1:29:28] believe what he said and he done the
[1:29:30] work that's
[1:29:32] all let me go a little further say well
[1:29:35] jeffersonville's in a bad spot then on
[1:29:36] the day of judgment what about
[1:29:42] Jonesboro we're just gonna keep coming
[1:29:43] closer to home what about
[1:29:48] Jonesboro brother bram's Ministry when
[1:29:51] he left home when the angel come to him
[1:29:52] he got up in his pulpit and he told the
[1:29:54] story in
[1:29:57] 1946 and some of the supernatural things
[1:30:00] that had happened and they heard about
[1:30:02] it in St Louis and a man from St Louis
[1:30:05] sent for him brother dhy I believe is
[1:30:07] his name he sent for him and he healed
[1:30:09] his daughter or the Lord healed his
[1:30:11] daughter through that Ministry there in
[1:30:13] St Louis and then they got word about
[1:30:16] that in Jonesboro brother brand was
[1:30:17] actually in Jonesboro in 1946 and in
[1:30:21] 1947 but when he went to Jonesboro
[1:30:24] the word had spread of what had happened
[1:30:27] it was one of his first meetings but
[1:30:29] word there had been enough happened
[1:30:31] people begin to find out about it and
[1:30:33] brother Brandon said everywhere I go I
[1:30:35] meet people from Arkansas he said it was
[1:30:37] one of my first places to go to after I
[1:30:39] left St Louis we was at the KE
[1:30:41] Auditorium went down into Arkansas and I
[1:30:44] never forget those people how they come
[1:30:47] he said oh he said there was 28,000
[1:30:50] people the newspaper said in Jonesboro
[1:30:54] and the city is about 8 or 10,000 I
[1:30:56] guess population it's a lot more than
[1:30:58] that
[1:30:59] now but he said for 30 miles around the
[1:31:02] city was nothing now think about this
[1:31:04] for a minute some of you drive from
[1:31:05] Jonesboro near there to come to church
[1:31:09] for 30 miles around the city all the
[1:31:12] farmhouses taken up tents built and
[1:31:14] things people living in it under old
[1:31:17] trucks brother Brown was quoting a
[1:31:18] newspaper article that I read this week
[1:31:21] about this he said people raining I'm
[1:31:24] going to show show you some things from
[1:31:26] the article in a moment he said people
[1:31:28] raining it'd be raining the people
[1:31:29] holding little pieces of canvas and
[1:31:31] newspapers over their sick folk just
[1:31:33] waiting for them to be prayed for he
[1:31:35] said it didn't make any difference if
[1:31:37] they got in this week or next week
[1:31:39] whenever it was it'd be all
[1:31:41] right oh my you imagine the people
[1:31:44] waiting out the elements it's it's
[1:31:46] basically a swamp anyway right
[1:31:49] especially brother Brandon was on
[1:31:50] Matthew Street at Bible Hour Tabernacle
[1:31:53] and so the people there wasn't no room
[1:31:54] for him and there was no building in
[1:31:56] Jonesboro at that time that could
[1:31:57] possibly hold all of those people and so
[1:31:59] the people were just waiting
[1:32:00] outside to be prayed for in through the
[1:32:04] rain brother brand talked about how he
[1:32:06] saw something that he said maybe moody
[1:32:08] or sanki would have seen he said I was
[1:32:10] in Corning Arkansas some of you come
[1:32:12] through Corning to come to church he
[1:32:14] said I was in Corning Arkansas he said I
[1:32:16] saw young ladies he said with the uh
[1:32:19] with the their bare feet he said their
[1:32:20] stockings in their hand people don't
[1:32:22] wear stockings much anymore he said they
[1:32:23] had their stockings in their hand and
[1:32:25] they had uh they had their shoes in
[1:32:27] their hand because they didn't want to
[1:32:27] get them dirty so they were walking
[1:32:29] barefoot to the
[1:32:31] meeting oh my now look brother brand
[1:32:35] said some of the most outstanding
[1:32:37] Miracles that I've ever seen done in
[1:32:41] America was did there some of the M most
[1:32:45] outstanding Miracles that he ever saw
[1:32:47] done in America was did there I think I
[1:32:50] have a picture or two if I can see this
[1:32:54] the that's from the newspaper you can't
[1:32:55] see it real well but that's an actual
[1:32:57] picture from the newspaper it didn't
[1:32:58] rely on a second Source I went to the
[1:33:00] newspaper itself and got this picture
[1:33:02] that's from the Jonesboro son in
[1:33:04] 1946 I believe it
[1:33:07] was and that's where the woman on the
[1:33:10] left brother Brand's praying for her
[1:33:12] who's sick the woman in the middle is
[1:33:14] Sister Hattie waldrip if you've heard
[1:33:16] brother Bram talk about her she's from
[1:33:17] Phoenix Arizona that was raised from the
[1:33:20] dead there was another man raised from
[1:33:22] the dead during that meeting at
[1:33:24] Jonesboro this man on the right is an
[1:33:27] xgi brother Bram talks about him at
[1:33:28] least in one place in the message where
[1:33:30] his uh his feet and his legs and
[1:33:32] everything were swollen from cancer
[1:33:35] their pictures were in the
[1:33:37] paper that these people came and their
[1:33:40] testimonies of how they were healed and
[1:33:43] so I think I've got another uh slide on
[1:33:45] there and this is the Articles from the
[1:33:47] newspaper at that time that uh all the
[1:33:50] people that came from 20 States and and
[1:33:52] how they drove thousands of miles to
[1:33:54] come and and all the things that it says
[1:33:57] about them and and and and and of course
[1:33:59] the newspaper was skeptical but they had
[1:34:01] to admit the attraction and they had to
[1:34:03] admit what happened now brother brandom
[1:34:05] talks about it and they tell the story
[1:34:07] in this article there's more to the
[1:34:08] article than what you see there but they
[1:34:10] tell the story if you go to that next
[1:34:12] quote uh where he said there's where a
[1:34:14] minister standing at the platform a big
[1:34:16] cancer hanging on him he said hanging on
[1:34:18] his neck the doctor said there's no
[1:34:20] chance for him standing there with the
[1:34:21] reporters stand there flashing the
[1:34:23] pictures that cancer turned white fell
[1:34:25] off of his neck and rolled over my feet
[1:34:27] he said I got it in alcohol
[1:34:30] now you talk about
[1:34:33] miracles right and that was told in that
[1:34:35] article how that happened and how the
[1:34:37] men testified of it there was a pit in
[1:34:39] his neck in his picture in the paper
[1:34:41] showing there was a man who sat in a
[1:34:42] wheelchair I didn't find the picture but
[1:34:44] I found the article talking about it he
[1:34:46] said there was a man who sat in a
[1:34:47] wheelchair for I forget how many years
[1:34:48] bound down like this was sitting there
[1:34:50] in the chair a Baptist Deacon and he
[1:34:52] said in a moment he got up out the chair
[1:34:54] and walked through the building
[1:34:55] glorifying God and things like
[1:34:57] that brother BR or brother Ivy one time
[1:35:00] before I came to church there he told me
[1:35:02] that he was preaching and he was
[1:35:03] preaching about uh the blind man that uh
[1:35:07] John John Ryan I believe his name was
[1:35:09] the blind man that was healed and
[1:35:10] testified of his healing and a woman a
[1:35:12] Pentecostal woman came to the service
[1:35:13] that night and she sat there and she got
[1:35:15] all excited because she thought they
[1:35:16] were talking about the same one she knew
[1:35:18] about and what she knew about was the
[1:35:20] blind man from
[1:35:21] kennet and she had been a witness that
[1:35:24] this man was blind and and they were
[1:35:26] driving him on the road from kenon
[1:35:28] somewh going back towards popular Blu
[1:35:30] and his eyes came open and brother
[1:35:32] Brandon tells the story how he testified
[1:35:34] all over this part of the
[1:35:36] country brother Brandon preached in
[1:35:38] Corny and moar he preached in
[1:35:41] paragold at the at the at the Oneness
[1:35:44] Church in paragold brother Brandon
[1:35:46] preached there he preached in Jonesboro
[1:35:48] he preached in Camden he preached in
[1:35:50] Eldorado he preached all through
[1:35:52] Arkansas and Hot Springs preached all
[1:35:54] over
[1:35:55] Arkansas if capernium will
[1:36:00] answer think about it for a minute what
[1:36:02] about
[1:36:03] Jonesboro what about
[1:36:08] kennet what about
[1:36:11] Memphis where brother BR preach many
[1:36:13] times and where the the woman was or the
[1:36:15] young man was healed that that brother
[1:36:17] Brandon was led the plane was stopped
[1:36:19] and he was led down and you can still go
[1:36:20] down in that area somewhere down in the
[1:36:22] area where Bass Pro is now where brother
[1:36:24] where the angel of the Lord LED brother
[1:36:26] brandom to go down where a where a a
[1:36:28] mother was standing there by her by her
[1:36:30] fence where her picket fence waiting on
[1:36:32] a prophet she said I'm the shite woman
[1:36:35] where is my
[1:36:38] Elijah God did that there was a blind
[1:36:42] girl from Memphis I've told you the
[1:36:43] story because it struck my heart I
[1:36:45] preached you a a message about a
[1:36:47] preached all over the world actually
[1:36:48] about Simon and how he picked up the
[1:36:50] cross picked up Jesus cross and and and
[1:36:53] brother Brandon was always reminded of
[1:36:55] that story whenever he'd see a a black
[1:36:57] person come in the prayer line and he
[1:36:58] would pray for them like this he said
[1:37:00] this Sim this one of Simon's children
[1:37:02] Lord that carried your cross and so
[1:37:05] there was a little blind girl that
[1:37:06] brother Brandon meets Out Among the
[1:37:08] throne he' slipped out to get a breath
[1:37:10] of fresh air and there's people crowded
[1:37:12] in there and this blind girl gotten
[1:37:13] separated from her daddy and she's
[1:37:15] looking for him and she comes up there
[1:37:16] and she begins to I said where's my help
[1:37:19] me help me and he said can I help you
[1:37:21] and she said just show me where my daddy
[1:37:23] is she said oh or she said take me to
[1:37:25] the Healer she said if you can take me
[1:37:27] to him my eyes will come open and I'll
[1:37:29] find him
[1:37:31] myself and brother brandham told her who
[1:37:34] he was and prayed for and her eyes come
[1:37:37] open happened right there in Jonesboro
[1:37:40] brother brandham talked about that and
[1:37:41] he people began to notice that and
[1:37:44] brother brandham saw some brothers in
[1:37:46] the crowd he was looking for he makes
[1:37:47] his way towards those Brothers he said
[1:37:49] just I started towards them there was an
[1:37:50] old brother I never will forget he had a
[1:37:52] club he had a crooked foot he was
[1:37:54] standing like this he said I know you
[1:37:55] brother brandom he said I've been
[1:37:56] standing in this rain for 8
[1:37:59] Days said tell me what to do and God
[1:38:02] will back your
[1:38:07] word we talked about that's why when
[1:38:10] with the Pentecostal world this wasn't
[1:38:12] message people the Pentecostal World
[1:38:14] said Bible times are here
[1:38:16] again right now look tell me what to do
[1:38:20] and God will back your word I said you
[1:38:21] with all your heart you believe he said
[1:38:23] said with all my heart I said throw away
[1:38:24] your club and be whole in the name of
[1:38:26] the Lord Jesus he threw his Club away
[1:38:29] and made out a scream and up in the air
[1:38:30] he went jumped down he come just as
[1:38:32] normal as any man begin to screaming
[1:38:35] sometimes we read these quotes but we
[1:38:36] don't realize these people were real
[1:38:39] people I was sitting in a service Friday
[1:38:42] night brother Forest farmer was sitting
[1:38:43] back there and I'm sitting on the up
[1:38:45] close to the front of that tent meeting
[1:38:47] and I was able to see brother the forest
[1:38:48] and I'm watching brother the forest as
[1:38:49] brother Wayne Lawson preached on a
[1:38:51] miracle working God and I'm sitting back
[1:38:53] there watching brother forest was
[1:38:54] reminded of the fact that brother Forest
[1:38:55] as a child had a club foot and brother
[1:38:57] Brandon prayed for him and he was
[1:38:59] healed and a living
[1:39:02] testimony most parts of the world they
[1:39:05] don't have that we have
[1:39:10] it there's got to be a reason
[1:39:13] church I was watching those people over
[1:39:15] there and I've seen many of those people
[1:39:16] I've been in this area I was thinking
[1:39:18] last night I've been preaching down in
[1:39:19] that area for 23 years and in this area
[1:39:21] for for a little longer than that
[1:39:25] and as I was preaching I remember
[1:39:26] preaching down there when everybody was
[1:39:28] kind of together and I seen some unity
[1:39:29] in the meeting and I really so
[1:39:31] appreciated that seeing that but I'm
[1:39:33] watching those people and we're seeing
[1:39:35] second generation third generation
[1:39:36] fourth generation fifth
[1:39:41] generation maybe sixth generation coming
[1:39:44] on message people many of you are third
[1:39:47] generation fourth generation
[1:39:51] Believers some of you are coming message
[1:39:53] on your own but many of you were bornn
[1:39:55] in message families we were greatly
[1:39:59] privileged to live where we
[1:40:02] live to be where we're at think about
[1:40:05] those people in capernium think about
[1:40:07] how that they they they were so greatly
[1:40:10] privileged to have Jesus down the street
[1:40:13] where they could go down the street and
[1:40:15] they could knock on his
[1:40:17] Door Church they could knock on his door
[1:40:20] and they said Jesus my daughter is sick
[1:40:23] and he he'd lay his hands on and they
[1:40:24] she'd be healed Jesus do you realize we
[1:40:27] have that same kind of access today we
[1:40:30] we don't live down the street from he
[1:40:31] lives in our heart we can knock on his
[1:40:34] door and if we're sick we can ask for
[1:40:36] healing if we're weary we can ask for
[1:40:38] help if we're if we're struggling with
[1:40:40] addiction we can ask for overcoming
[1:40:42] power whatever it is we're struggling
[1:40:44] he's right here Among
[1:40:48] Us I'm stirred this morning
[1:40:53] look at this as I begin to look at this
[1:40:55] just as we come through the Abraham
[1:40:57] series and begin to look at that Sodom
[1:40:59] and how that compares with those cities
[1:41:01] worse than
[1:41:03] Sodom we're still blessed with living
[1:41:05] Witnesses of what happened the ctis
[1:41:07] aren't here this morning
[1:41:09] uh but I thank God you you realize they
[1:41:11] were there during th those some of those
[1:41:13] days some of you were some we got some
[1:41:15] other Elders that were here either right
[1:41:17] during that time or right after and
[1:41:20] those that generation is passing on
[1:41:24] now
[1:41:25] look we're still blessed with living
[1:41:27] Witnesses but many of the folks most of
[1:41:29] the folks from from that 47 Revival 46
[1:41:32] and 47 are gone but brother Bron said
[1:41:35] there's where the blind was seeing the
[1:41:37] deaf was hearing now listen what he says
[1:41:39] and the ministry tonight this was in
[1:41:41] 1964 is a 100 miles beyond
[1:41:46] that why was the opening of the word he
[1:41:49] said but the Revival fires has died down
[1:41:54] let me bring it a little bit closer if
[1:41:58] Jonesboro if Jonesboro received a what
[1:42:00] about Hardy
[1:42:02] Arkansas and we like to look at all the
[1:42:05] things that have happened and and some
[1:42:06] of them bad that have happened but look
[1:42:08] what God has done in Hardy
[1:42:11] Arkansas how will we escape if we
[1:42:14] neglect to hear the
[1:42:17] message we can't say it never come to
[1:42:20] our
[1:42:21] city we can't say families were never
[1:42:24] exposed to it we have no
[1:42:26] excuse when it comes to that Hardy
[1:42:30] Arkansas I'm preaching now to you and to
[1:42:33] us how will we escape if we neglect to
[1:42:38] hear the message we can testify to more
[1:42:41] than natural healing we can testify
[1:42:44] after the opening of the word that many
[1:42:46] who believed that and sat right here in
[1:42:48] this church and lived and died saints of
[1:42:50] God who were who had all kinds of stuff
[1:42:52] in lives and they were overcame that and
[1:42:55] they become pillars in the church we
[1:42:57] have are witnesses of the changing the
[1:42:59] transforming power of Jesus Christ we
[1:43:03] Are Witnesses why are there so many
[1:43:05] Believers in Jonesburg why are there so
[1:43:07] many in this area in in in the we could
[1:43:09] say the greater Jonesboro area why are
[1:43:11] there so many Believers around Dyersburg
[1:43:13] why are there so many Believers in Hardy
[1:43:14] Arkansas God specially visited this
[1:43:19] area he he visited
[1:43:21] us how will we
[1:43:24] escape if we don't take our
[1:43:27] responsibility step up to the plate
[1:43:30] believing this message has healed Our
[1:43:32] Sick changed lives restored
[1:43:37] Fellowship you say what but this has
[1:43:39] happened or that's happened let me tell
[1:43:41] you what it's done I'm tired of negative
[1:43:44] testimony let me tell you what it's done
[1:43:46] for me let me tell you it's changed my
[1:43:48] life let me tell you it's changed my
[1:43:50] family put us on a different trajectory
[1:43:53] because I know what I would be without
[1:43:55] the message of the hour the problem with
[1:43:58] some of you don't recognize what you
[1:43:59] would be without the influence of the
[1:44:01] message on your life you don't realize
[1:44:03] it and so but some of you been there you
[1:44:05] know what the what it was without the
[1:44:07] message without that influence and you
[1:44:08] know what you are today and God has
[1:44:10] transformed you you're a miracle we got
[1:44:13] miracles sitting right here in the
[1:44:14] church we got we ought to give God glory
[1:44:16] for that we got miracles of healing
[1:44:18] we've seen cancer healed we've seen
[1:44:20] leukemia taken away we've seen we've
[1:44:22] seen God work but we've seen God change
[1:44:25] the lives as they go into the little
[1:44:27] room of the word as they come through
[1:44:29] the opening of the word we've seen God
[1:44:31] do
[1:44:33] it we're Witnesses brother JT over the
[1:44:36] years we're Witnesses of God
[1:44:39] moving I am without excuse we are
[1:44:43] without
[1:44:46] excuse how could we sit through a
[1:44:48] service with a bad
[1:44:50] attitude knowing what we know seeing
[1:44:53] what we've
[1:44:58] seen how can we pick and fight at one
[1:45:00] another and fuss at one another I told a
[1:45:03] brother this week we have a
[1:45:04] responsibility not to present that to
[1:45:06] the people of this
[1:45:08] area we got a responsibility not to fuss
[1:45:11] and fight and present that to the
[1:45:14] people we've been given a great
[1:45:19] gift what are we going to do with it
[1:45:25] probably per capita there's more message
[1:45:26] people in this in this area than there
[1:45:28] are anywhere else that may be a good
[1:45:29] thing or a bad thing but it's what you
[1:45:31] do with
[1:45:35] it we're responsible to it listen we're
[1:45:39] responsible not just us but every corner
[1:45:41] of the world listen in in this area
[1:45:44] there's churches on every corner but
[1:45:45] every corner of the world there's
[1:45:46] churches of this
[1:45:48] message I recently found out about some
[1:45:50] in in uh uh over on by the Alps and in
[1:45:55] Nepal there's Believers there and
[1:45:57] there's in every island in every
[1:46:00] country there's Believers in every
[1:46:02] country of the world even in Egypt where
[1:46:05] we went where we preaching brand new to
[1:46:07] people the people were hungry to hear
[1:46:09] about a miracle working
[1:46:10] God and we were still telling the story
[1:46:13] and telling them that that were updating
[1:46:15] and saying that's not just a god of
[1:46:16] yesterday it's the same yesterday today
[1:46:18] and
[1:46:21] forever I've stood there myself self
[1:46:23] church and I feel the responsibility of
[1:46:25] it because I know there's people there
[1:46:27] oh that God would raise up missionaries
[1:46:29] people who were willing to work people
[1:46:31] who are willing to go out because I know
[1:46:33] there's hungry souls and there's nobody
[1:46:35] to
[1:46:36] go either because of lack of resources
[1:46:38] or or just a lack of willingness or it's
[1:46:40] a dangerous place but somebody went
[1:46:44] that's why you're here somebody preached
[1:46:46] that's why you're here brother Paul
[1:46:49] you're such a witness of that and I've
[1:46:50] told that story over and over again how
[1:46:52] somebody in Africa witness to brother
[1:46:53] Paul about this message that's why he's
[1:46:55] here today because the message went all
[1:46:58] the way to Africa you talk about
[1:47:00] predestination he went all the way to
[1:47:02] Africa to speak to a man in Africa to
[1:47:05] speak to brother Paul to bring him back
[1:47:07] here to
[1:47:09] Arkansas oh Church don't you realize
[1:47:11] what God has done in our day listen if
[1:47:14] you don't that ought give you courage
[1:47:15] that'll encourage you today if your
[1:47:17] children aren't where they should be
[1:47:19] remember God's going to get them somehow
[1:47:21] if he's got to have somebody from Africa
[1:47:23] speak to them somehow there's go that
[1:47:24] God would send missionaries into Hardy
[1:47:27] Arkansas missionaries into Kenan
[1:47:29] missionaries into West
[1:47:31] Plains as brother Brandon spoke in
[1:47:33] Jeffersonville he said all that we had
[1:47:35] in Jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:47:39] voices we need the same thing in Hardy
[1:47:45] Arkansas how many folks have walked to
[1:47:48] the front of this church and been
[1:47:50] healed over the last 24 or five years
[1:47:52] years that this building's been
[1:47:59] here how many have nelt at the
[1:48:02] altar many of you have and been
[1:48:09] changed meetings everywhere churches on
[1:48:12] every corner we're responsible to
[1:48:15] it we have a responsibility we've got to
[1:48:18] feed on it we got to feed on the body
[1:48:21] word of the son of man
[1:48:23] the brand said this I'm closing in just
[1:48:24] a moment I know I've been long but I'm
[1:48:26] moved this morning to say
[1:48:28] this the modern Pentecostal move started
[1:48:30] in Los Angeles California on isusa
[1:48:33] Street brother Brandon preached in that
[1:48:35] City over and over again showing the
[1:48:37] sign of the Messiah it was so
[1:48:39] heartbreaking I listened to brother
[1:48:41] Brandon preaching Jehovah Gyra number
[1:48:43] two I believe it was in 1960 when he
[1:48:45] preached or 62 when he preached it
[1:48:47] there in in in that area in the
[1:48:50] California area he's preaching there and
[1:48:54] and when he preaches to those people
[1:48:55] he's trying to show them how that
[1:48:57] Abraham the one that was with Abraham
[1:48:59] had his back to the tent and revealed
[1:49:01] the secrets of Sarah's heart he's
[1:49:03] showing them that and he kept turning
[1:49:05] his back and showing them what God had
[1:49:07] done but every time he turned around to
[1:49:10] do it and someone is speak in tongu
[1:49:11] somebody prophesy and that's wonderful
[1:49:13] but it's not the message of our day
[1:49:15] that's not our Focus today that's not
[1:49:17] our emphasis today I believe in tongues
[1:49:20] I believe in Prophecy I believe in
[1:49:21] interpretation that's not the emphasis
[1:49:23] the people missed it because they were
[1:49:24] looking at what they already had and
[1:49:26] brother Brown finally told him he said
[1:49:27] if you won't believe this believe your
[1:49:30] gifts but we've got something even
[1:49:33] greater than that I'm not saying we've
[1:49:34] done away with that we haven't in all oh
[1:49:36] that God would make every one of you
[1:49:37] tongue speakers and and prophesied I
[1:49:40] pray that God would do that for all of
[1:49:42] us but we know that not all speak with
[1:49:43] tongues but we can all be filled with
[1:49:45] the Holy Ghost are you with me now we
[1:49:49] can all be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:51] and if it's the Holy Ghost operated by
[1:49:53] love it'll operate in
[1:49:56] order but now look what's happening look
[1:49:58] what's happening it's a responsibility
[1:50:00] that we have and and brother brandham
[1:50:01] stood there and they would not accept
[1:50:03] the responsib they wouldn't move on into
[1:50:04] the message of the hour and brother Bram
[1:50:07] stood there when he preached choosing of
[1:50:08] a bride as people when they heard that
[1:50:10] sermon were streaming out the back door
[1:50:13] been told by people who were there
[1:50:15] streaming out the back door leaving as
[1:50:17] brother Brandon preached as he got
[1:50:19] serious toward the end of the sermon he
[1:50:22] said that is a solemn warning we don't
[1:50:25] know what time and you don't know what
[1:50:26] time that this city one day is going to
[1:50:28] be laying out here in the bottom of this
[1:50:29] ocean people tell you they know what
[1:50:31] time don't know what they're talking
[1:50:33] about but he said oh capernium said
[1:50:36] Jesus thou who exalted into heaven will
[1:50:38] be brought down into hell for if the
[1:50:39] mighty Works have been done in Sodom and
[1:50:41] Gomorrah it have been standing to this
[1:50:43] day in Sodom and Gomorrah lays in the
[1:50:44] bottom of the Dead Sea and capernium is
[1:50:46] in the bottom of the sea go look at it
[1:50:48] in history where did capernium end up
[1:50:50] the same fate of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:50:52] ended up in the bottom of the ocean thou
[1:50:55] City who claims to be the city of the
[1:50:57] Angels who has exalted yourself into
[1:50:59] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[1:51:01] things of Fashions and things they'll
[1:51:02] even the foreign countries come here to
[1:51:04] pick up our filth and send it away your
[1:51:05] fine churches and Steeples so forth the
[1:51:07] way you do remember one day you'll be
[1:51:08] laying in the bottom of the sea your
[1:51:10] great honeycomb under you right now the
[1:51:12] wrath of God is beling right beneath you
[1:51:14] how much longer he will hold this
[1:51:15] Sandbar hanging out over that is a
[1:51:17] modern Sodom and
[1:51:20] Gomorrah but the faith of this
[1:51:25] city there's way more influence of the
[1:51:28] message today than Los Angeles has where
[1:51:32] will we stand in the day of
[1:51:39] judgment he said that ocean out yonder a
[1:51:41] mile deep will Sid in their Plum back to
[1:51:43] the salt and sea it'll be worse and the
[1:51:45] last day of Pompei repent Los Angeles
[1:51:48] listen repent the rest of you and turn
[1:51:52] to God
[1:51:53] the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth
[1:51:57] flee while there's time to flee I'm so
[1:52:00] glad God gave us a space of time I'm so
[1:52:03] glad it didn't end in 77 which is as far
[1:52:06] as brother brand could see because of
[1:52:08] the
[1:52:10] darkness I'm so glad it didn't end s
[1:52:12] because I wasn't born yet but I was born
[1:52:15] for a purpose you were born for a
[1:52:18] purpose flee while there's time to flee
[1:52:22] and come come to
[1:52:24] Christ listen Paul put it this way to
[1:52:28] the Hebrew Believers how shall we
[1:52:31] escape if we neglect look at the word he
[1:52:35] uses there
[1:52:36] neglect not how should we escape if
[1:52:39] we're never exposed to it no if we
[1:52:41] neglect so great
[1:52:43] salvation if we
[1:52:46] neglect oh my we've
[1:52:48] heard church you you've heard Great Men

[1:52:53] pulit over and over again you've heard
[1:52:56] God God has coming I feel like a poor

[1:56:45] from another

[1:56:56] Abraham amen when Jesus got done
[1:56:59] rebuking capernium he said this at that

[1:57:02] thee Oh father have you ever put those
[1:57:05] things together he gets done rebuking
[1:57:07] capernum he said oh Father Lord of
[1:57:09] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[1:57:11] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:57:14] and Hast revealed them unto
[1:57:17] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:57:20] in thy sight Peter was arrest of
[1:57:22] capernium
[1:57:23] remember and Jesus spoke and said
[1:57:26] capernium he said you're worse than
[1:57:28] Sodom Peter was a resident of that City
[1:57:32] and when the everybody left him and
[1:57:33] Jesus began to turn towards his word
[1:57:35] ministry and so many wanted to stay in
[1:57:37] the first Pole or stay in the second
[1:57:39] pole and he was turning to that to to
[1:57:41] his word ministry preaching about him
[1:57:43] being the bread of life and he stood
[1:57:44] there and he began to he began to talk
[1:57:46] to him and when he began to talk to him
[1:57:48] what happened he Peter he said will you
[1:57:50] go as well and Peter said to whom shall
[1:57:52] we go thou alone H has the words of life
[1:57:55] oh that there would be a resident of

[1:58:04] signs I was attracted by Miracles but
[1:58:06] that's not what has kept me what's kep
[1:58:08] me was the opening of the word it was
[1:58:10] the prophet revealing the mysteries of
[1:58:12] the
[1:58:13] hour
[1:58:14] amen but Abraham was separated from
[1:58:17] Sodom like Peter and the
[1:58:19] disciples by the Angel's message and the
[1:58:21] Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that
[1:58:24] thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[1:58:26] shall surely become a great and mighty
[1:58:28] nation and all the nations of the Earth
[1:58:30] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[1:58:34] he will command his children his
[1:58:36] household after him they shall keep the
[1:58:38] way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:58:40] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[1:58:41] Abraham that which you have spoken of
[1:58:43] they will not make deals with the devil
[1:58:45] they will not sit there look out the
[1:58:46] window and see the sin and not cry out
[1:58:48] against it but they will be people who
[1:58:50] live for God who do what it
[1:58:53] takes to have the power of God in their
[1:58:56] lives he said he won't let his children
[1:58:58] follow the ways of Sodom you believe my

[2:02:34] believe help thou my
[2:02:37] unbelief I pray granted today Heavenly
[2:02:41] Father Lord Jesus
[2:02:45] we we've reached this moment in the
[2:02:47] service I'm not even sure Lord at this

[2:02:57] The Winning
[2:02:59] Side Lord I Thank you for these people I
[2:03:02] believe they many of them have taken

[2:03:07] really embraced it I pray that they
[2:03:08] would Lord Lord if there's one here
[2:03:11] maybe some sitting here have never been
[2:03:13] born again and that's why the struggle
[2:03:16] is there they want to believe the
[2:03:17] message they want to come and they want
[2:03:19] to do what's right but there's that
[2:03:21] struggle they need a new birth in their
[2:03:23] life help them to know that
[2:03:25] Lord and how will we receive that by
[2:03:27] being baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:03:29] Christ repenting of our
[2:03:31] sins and receiving the gift of the Holy
[2:03:35] Ghost I pray Lord if there's one here
[2:03:38] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:39] may they receive it this morning it's
