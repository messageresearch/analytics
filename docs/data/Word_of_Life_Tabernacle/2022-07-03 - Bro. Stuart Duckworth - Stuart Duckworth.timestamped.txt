[55:54] and pursue the son of Mount Makaya heard
[55:58] the words of Jeremiah that Jeremiah had
[56:00] spoken unto all the people saying
[56:03] thus saith the Lord he that remaineth in
[56:06] this city shall die by the sword by the
[56:09] famine and by the pestilence but he that
[56:11] goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live
[56:14] for he shall have his life for a prey
[56:16] and shall live
[56:18] I mean thus saith the Lord this city
[56:19] shall be given into the hand of the king
[56:21] of babylon's army which shall take it
[56:25] and therefore the princes said unto the
[56:27] king we beseech thee let this man be put
[56:30] to death for he thus he weakeneth the
[56:33] hands of the men of war that remaineth
[56:35] in this city
[56:37] in the hands of all the people and and
[56:39] speaking such words unto them for this
[56:41] man's seeketh not the welfare of this
[56:44] people but the hurt and then zedekiah

[56:49] for the king is not he that can do
[56:51] anything against you what a king that
[56:54] would be I mean he can't help you out a

[57:06] of Hamlet that was in the court of the
[57:08] prison and they let down Jeremiah the
[57:10] chords and in the dungeon there was no
[57:13] water but mire so Jeremiah sunk in the
[57:16] Meyer what a what a condition that this

[58:21] amen they held to their traditions and
[58:23] their own ideas and the people the

[58:39] weeping prophet he's seen the condition
[58:41] of the people in the land of that day

[1:08:02] before I formed thee in the belly I knew

[1:08:06] and before thou came us forth out of the
[1:08:08] womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee
[1:08:10] a prophet unto the Nations I I like
[1:08:13] Jeremiah there's so many good things and
[1:08:15] in the book of Jeremiah
[1:08:18] but you see how how concerned God was
[1:08:21] with was with life even before he was in
[1:08:24] the womb amen but what about when
[1:08:27] there's life in the womb
[1:08:29] man God's just so concerned about it

[1:08:41] been assigned it has been entrusted Amen
[1:08:45] to be that for a purpose

[1:09:17] prophet has such a special purpose God
[1:09:19] Is So set them apart Amen to bring the
[1:09:22] word to bring the mind of God to you and
[1:09:25] I that away when when the mind of God
[1:09:27] comes amen and we can see these things
[1:09:29] and we can believe these things then we

[1:10:40] last say through their bride in this
[1:10:42] hour do you believe that
[1:10:44] under her messenger she will be that
[1:10:46] final voice to the final age
[1:10:49] brother Alan you might have to get up
[1:10:51] here
[1:10:52] about to lose my voice buddy
[1:10:55] you love the Lord
[1:10:57] amen so all life has a purpose
[1:11:00] amen and God is the author of all life
[1:11:03] and he is able to take care of any
[1:11:05] amount of human beings that would be on
[1:11:07] the earth and you hear that argument
[1:11:08] well
[1:11:10] we need abortion there's too many people
[1:11:12] why why would you try to play God why
[1:11:15] would you try to step in that position
[1:11:17] amen that's what they try to do they try
[1:11:19] to play God they try to control these
[1:11:21] things amen amen but here's the author
[1:11:24] of life amen and I say that God is a
[1:11:27] just God Amen he can make a way when
[1:11:30] there is no way amen and I can't
[1:11:32] understand why why things the way they
[1:11:34] are and why life is so hard for for some
[1:11:37] folks why it's so hard amen but I
[1:11:39] believe it's mercy and his grace abounds
[1:11:41] amen he's a just God Amen life is hard
[1:11:45] for so many amen but no one has a right
[1:11:47] to choose who lives and who has a
[1:11:49] purpose and who doesn't
[1:11:51] amen because God is able to take care
[1:11:54] amen he's able to come amen and speak
[1:11:56] amen and it's many times those in a
[1:11:58] lowly condition you say look at the
[1:12:00] poverty look look at the condition it's
[1:12:03] in that condition that God comes down
[1:12:05] and he speaks to somebody and he raises
[1:12:07] him up
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:10] amen so all life matters all life has a
[1:12:14] purpose
[1:12:15] amen no one has a right to choose I mean
[1:12:18] in poverty and wealth if you are in his
[1:12:21] economy amen you are his amen and if you
[1:12:24] have any kind of purpose God will speak
[1:12:26] to you God will speak to that person
[1:12:28] amen maybe they don't believe what you
[1:12:30] and I believe maybe they're not Broad
[1:12:32] and then but God's got a purpose for
[1:12:34] every every individual if they'll answer
[1:12:36] that call God will call call to them
[1:12:39] amen yes
[1:12:42] God will speak to you amen but I I think

[1:13:05] all life has a purpose every life has a
[1:13:08] purpose amen and it's not for us amen

[1:13:14] what we know it's not for us to say well
[1:13:16] this person has has tried and failed and
[1:13:18] tried and failed and they've been in and
[1:13:20] out and in and out who are we to deny

[1:13:31] much somebody's tried and failed amen we

[1:13:41] and not deny
[1:13:43] amen that someone would have a purpose
[1:13:45] that someone would have another chance
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:56] Jeremiah 2 and 11.
[1:14:00] hath a nation changed their gods which
[1:14:02] are yet no Gods but my people have
[1:14:04] changed their glory for that which doth
[1:14:07] not profit Jeremiah here prophesying to
[1:14:10] to Israel be astonish though he Heavens
[1:14:12] at this and be horribly afraid be ye
[1:14:15] very desolate saith the Lord
[1:14:17] for my people have committed two evils
[1:14:19] they're forsaken me the Fountain of
[1:14:22] Living Waters and I've hewed them out
[1:14:24] cisterns broken cisterns that can hold
[1:14:27] no water
[1:14:28] and brother Brown says here in the
[1:14:30] message broken cisterns
[1:14:33] and we look at Israel as an example
[1:14:35] that God was he always has to remain the
[1:14:38] same there's only one thing that God
[1:14:40] ever did and that was his provided way
[1:14:43] honor his provided way for the people
[1:14:45] and they got and they got out of that
[1:14:47] way then God was Dishonored and God made
[1:14:51] the people suffer for getting away from
[1:14:53] what he had told him to do no matter
[1:14:55] what it was
[1:14:57] he gave them a law touched our handle
[1:15:00] not taste not and he said just not
[1:15:02] because the evil of doing it but the
[1:15:04] evil of disobeying what he said to do
[1:15:07] you think well why does why does God not
[1:15:10] want me to do this why does he want me
[1:15:11] to do this amen it doesn't matter so
[1:15:14] much of that but God wants obedience
[1:15:16] from his children he wants somebody that
[1:15:19] will obey his word no matter how little
[1:15:21] it is or how big it is amen give up that
[1:15:24] little thing this morning give up that
[1:15:27] big thing obey the word and see the
[1:15:29] blessing of God see God come upon the
[1:15:31] scene but if you want if you're not
[1:15:33] willing to give that up if you're if
[1:15:35] you're going to continue to disobey God
[1:15:38] won't be in that
[1:15:42] obedience is better than sacrifice amen
[1:15:45] we we serve him we don't serve him out
[1:15:47] of fear but we serve him out of love
[1:15:48] amen amen we serve him because amen
[1:15:51] because we we honor and serve him
[1:15:53] because we love him
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] and remember
[1:15:58] full obedience to the word and this hour
[1:16:00] entitles you to the Token it entitles
[1:16:03] you to God's provided way for this hour
[1:16:05] amen so they had forsaken him the
[1:16:08] Fountain of Living Waters God's provided
[1:16:10] way that was God's provided away it
[1:16:12] wasn't it wasn't that old man-made
[1:16:13] system but it was the living water and
[1:16:15] they had gotten away from that and hewed
[1:16:18] him out a man-made sister and a broken
[1:16:20] sister
[1:16:21] and brother Brown describes these
[1:16:23] cisterns and we'll go through this he
[1:16:24] says this cistern would fill up with
[1:16:26] rain water and all the trash from the
[1:16:29] Barns and the stables and every little
[1:16:31] bit of dirt from the streets and the
[1:16:33] alleys and everything Eamon would run
[1:16:35] off when the rain would come and it
[1:16:36] would fill up these cisterns and this is
[1:16:39] what the people were partaking of
[1:16:41] amen so in these sisters they would use
[1:16:43] a rag for a filter to try to catch and
[1:16:46] catch the bugs and the scum and but he
[1:16:49] said brother Brown said but some of the
[1:16:50] bug juice would still find its way in
[1:16:52] the bottom I mean I was riding down the
[1:16:55] road listening to this message I was I
[1:16:56] was sitting there eating me some chili
[1:16:58] cheese tots and
[1:17:00] and a racist blast
[1:17:03] listening to that and I was eating and I
[1:17:05] got sick of my stomach listening to
[1:17:06] describe this I had to I had to turn
[1:17:08] turn it off for a little bit so I can
[1:17:10] finish my my chili cheese ties
[1:17:14] but think of how how awful it would be
[1:17:17] to draw a drink
[1:17:18] to draw a drink from that how sick it
[1:17:21] would it would it should make you feel
[1:17:25] how sick it would make you feel
[1:17:27] he said and then in a few days of the
[1:17:29] water standing it would become stagnated
[1:17:31] and then there would be snakes and frogs
[1:17:34] and wiggle tails and these cisterns he
[1:17:36] said these systems would go dry and
[1:17:38] would be in the bottom would be mud and
[1:17:40] muck and dirt from the rain and the
[1:17:43] runoff of the water
[1:17:45] and brother Branham says here he says
[1:17:47] and that's a whole lot like the churches
[1:17:49] today I think we have left one of the
[1:17:51] great sins that the church has done just
[1:17:53] like Israel has left him the Fountain of
[1:17:56] Living Water and has chewed him out
[1:17:58] man-made cisterns and they become the
[1:18:00] habitation of everything that loves that
[1:18:02] kind of water lizards and frogs and all
[1:18:05] kinds of unclean germs live in it
[1:18:06] because it's a man-made tank and in this
[1:18:09] tank things stand it's a perfect example
[1:18:11] of our denominations this day
[1:18:14] and he said that's exactly what the
[1:18:16] people does today they refuse the word
[1:18:18] to take a denominational system because
[1:18:20] in that what they can do and what they
[1:18:22] they want to get by with it these
[1:18:24] denominational system will just let you
[1:18:26] get by with whatever he said but you
[1:18:27] can't do that in Christ you've got to
[1:18:30] come clean and clear in order to be in
[1:18:33] Christ amen Christ is that Fountain of
[1:18:35] Living Water amen amen that old that old
[1:18:38] system lets you left that old world that
[1:18:39] you left him and that that was that old
[1:18:42] stagnant water
[1:18:43] remember to come to Christ you've got to
[1:18:45] leave that old water pot you've got to
[1:18:47] leave that old that old system
[1:18:49] so anything goes in these systems and
[1:18:52] amen and there's just they're just to me
[1:18:54] there wouldn't be a good enough filter
[1:18:55] Amen to collect all that trash you might
[1:18:58] you might get part of it amen but
[1:19:00] there's there's not enough filter in
[1:19:02] that and that's how a denominational
[1:19:04] man-made system is anything goes I mean
[1:19:07] you see that in the hour that we live in
[1:19:09] they don't have the filter of the word
[1:19:11] amen to filter out I mean the things
[1:19:13] that would go across the pulpit and that
[1:19:15] that if it's not preaching the pulpit
[1:19:18] the people will just go on and there's
[1:19:20] no voice there there's no filter there
[1:19:22] and then to say that's wrong or this is
[1:19:25] wrong or this is right
[1:19:27] there's no filter of the word of the
[1:19:29] hour to do that
[1:19:31] so there's all kinds of trash that flows
[1:19:33] in the head
[1:19:36] amen it's not God's provided way
[1:19:40] amen without without the filter of the
[1:19:43] word or allow the things of the world to
[1:19:45] come in and defile make the church sick
[1:19:52] leaving the Artesian well for a man-made
[1:19:54] system could you imagine someone doing
[1:19:57] that could you imagine the mental
[1:19:58] condition he says of a person that would
[1:20:00] drink a fresh or teasing well and would
[1:20:02] leave that for a man-made sisters with
[1:20:04] frogs and lizards and wiggle tails and
[1:20:06] everything in him
[1:20:08] let's lock you and I here today amen how
[1:20:11] could we leave this water how could we
[1:20:13] leave this living Fountain and go back
[1:20:15] we can't do it you can't do it you can't
[1:20:18] go back and and draw from some man's ID
[1:20:20] in this hour and then we we've we've
[1:20:22] received the intelligence of God we
[1:20:24] we've received the mind of the hour the
[1:20:26] headship has came the mind of God is
[1:20:28] here among the people how could we go
[1:20:30] back and take anybody else's idea about
[1:20:32] it you can't do it you can't do it in
[1:20:36] this hour amen until to partake of that
[1:20:38] filth that has come into the nominal
[1:20:40] church amen could you just imagine
[1:20:41] leaving this water
[1:20:44] so what is the Fountain of Living Water
[1:20:46] brother Brown says it's an Artesian well
[1:20:48] it's a well that comes from beneath and
[1:20:51] it pushes the water out it's flowing all
[1:20:53] the time it's self-supporting it's
[1:20:55] always fresh and clean and Artesian well
[1:20:58] a Fountain of Living Water he said it's
[1:21:00] not dead and stagnated but it's living
[1:21:02] it's constantly changing bringing up
[1:21:05] something new all the time that's moving
[1:21:07] on coming from its resources and in this
[1:21:10] watering and it's self-cleansing it'll
[1:21:13] clean from the inside I mean it won't
[1:21:15] make you sick it's clean it's pure it's

[1:21:20] mean you don't have to wait for the
[1:21:21] rains to fill this tank because it's
[1:21:23] always bubbling and it gives us water
[1:21:25] free and then you don't have to pay for
[1:21:27] it it comes up for nothing amen and all

[1:21:43] sin amen but it'll wash you out this

[1:25:56] amen if you have forsaken it this
[1:25:58] morning if you're looking for a fountain
[1:26:00] this morning I know where to find it
[1:26:02] I know where to find it it's simple I
[1:26:04] can lead you to it I can tell you how
[1:26:06] this morning and then for Christ is that
[1:26:09] rock he's that rock that will bring
[1:26:11] forth Living Waters amen you ain't got
[1:26:14] to go to some special church somewhere
[1:26:16] to fight it you ain't got to go Lose
[1:26:18] Yourself out in the world somewhere to
[1:26:19] find it but he's here this morning he's
[1:26:22] within speaking distance and when The
[1:26:24] Rock Amen was struck on Calvary that
[1:26:27] rock was struck on Calvary to bring
[1:26:29] forth Living Waters and now all you had
[1:26:31] to do is speak to the Rock Amen this
[1:26:33] morning he's within speaking distance if
[1:26:35] you got a need I mean if you've left a
[1:26:37] thousand if you've forsaken the fountain
[1:26:39] speak to the rock this morning and he'll
[1:26:41] come give you a drink
[1:26:46] we know where he's at
[1:26:48] we know where he's at we're not lost
[1:26:52] the children of Israel and the journey
[1:26:53] even that rock was always with them
[1:26:56] amen when they got to con and murmuring
[1:26:59] and complaining and when they didn't
[1:27:00] have to do that all they had to do was
[1:27:02] speak to the Rock
[1:27:05] he's here this morning he's a he's a
[1:27:07] living well
[1:27:10] amen our original text
[1:27:15] Jeremiah had told him the word of the
[1:27:16] Lord
[1:27:18] if you're going to stay in the city
[1:27:19] you're going to die by the sword by the
[1:27:22] famine by the pestilence but if you go
[1:27:24] forth to the Chaldeans you will live and
[1:27:27] in the city he said the city is going to
[1:27:29] be taken it's going to be destroyed he
[1:27:31] he was that voice to try to tell the
[1:27:33] people
[1:27:34] amen he was that weeping prophet he was
[1:27:36] he was out the one that was sighing and
[1:27:38] crying he was the one that was concerned
[1:27:40] he was ordained for that
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:46] but they let Jeremiah down and then with
[1:27:49] cords in the dungeon where there was no
[1:27:52] water
[1:27:52] but mire amen as we read so Jeremiah
[1:27:56] sunk in the mire and that word dungeon
[1:27:58] it means the same thing as a sister and
[1:28:00] it means pit it's a cistern
[1:28:02] so you think about that I was reading
[1:28:04] these scriptures a few few weeks ago
[1:28:06] think of that the very thing that
[1:28:08] Jeremiah Was preaching against that he
[1:28:10] was trying to tell the people that
[1:28:11] they've forsaken The Living Waters and
[1:28:13] and drinking out of this old cistern the
[1:28:16] very thing that he was preaching against
[1:28:17] that's what they threw him into
[1:28:20] and I just thought that was something
[1:28:21] you know there the prophet had found
[1:28:23] himself in the very thing that he was
[1:28:25] preaching against
[1:28:26] and I I was listening to the someone
[1:28:29] preach about Jeremiah and the pit just
[1:28:30] trying to draw a little inspiration from
[1:28:32] it
[1:28:33] and you know they they portrayed it as
[1:28:35] if as it was someone in sin that had
[1:28:38] gone down and sinned and I guess you
[1:28:40] could top it like that but I don't
[1:28:41] believe the prophet was in sin I believe
[1:28:43] he would he was doing what he was
[1:28:45] supposed to do and just just so happens
[1:28:46] that hey man these men had it out for
[1:28:49] him they hated him so much that they put
[1:28:51] him down in that pit and sometimes
[1:28:53] sometimes it is it is what you do why
[1:28:56] you're in the pit sometimes it's just
[1:28:59] for whatever reason you get thrown in
[1:29:02] the pit you had nothing to do with it
[1:29:04] and this is how it is this is how life
[1:29:07] sometimes sometimes is or there's piss
[1:29:09] that we get thrown into
[1:29:13] and so he they punished him for speaking
[1:29:16] the word trying trying to help him
[1:29:18] trying to save him from destruction by
[1:29:20] putting him into that pit trying to
[1:29:22] silence that voice and all he did was
[1:29:24] tell them the truth he was trying to
[1:29:26] tell them from the coming destruction
[1:29:28] amen they're and they're sinking into
[1:29:31] mire in the mud
[1:29:32] and probably the more that he moved the
[1:29:35] deeper he got down in the mud
[1:29:38] hey man down there left to die
[1:29:40] nothing to eat nothing to drink just
[1:29:42] watering in the mud waiting on somebody
[1:29:45] to get him out of there waiting on
[1:29:47] something to happen
[1:29:48] Amen in his mind he was probably I would
[1:29:51] think if I was down there I would think
[1:29:52] what did I do to deserve this
[1:29:55] I'm just trying to tell people what's
[1:29:57] right
[1:29:58] I'm just trying to go to school and be
[1:30:01] an example and wear a long hair and wear
[1:30:03] long dresses and and be an example I'm
[1:30:06] trying to trying to stand for the
[1:30:07] message of the hour I'm I'm trying to
[1:30:09] live for God why why does everybody hate
[1:30:11] me why what did I do to deserve this
[1:30:14] he said but you can't look
[1:30:20] and I'll say this morning you can't look
[1:30:21] at your symptoms you can't look at
[1:30:23] what's around you've got to look you've
[1:30:26] got to look to the god that can deliver
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:30] limitations
[1:30:32] third chapter in the 53rd verse
[1:30:35] and perhaps Jeremiah wrote this
[1:30:38] because of his experience in that
[1:30:41] dungeon
[1:30:42] later in Lamentations they have cut off
[1:30:44] my life in the dungeon and cast a stone
[1:30:47] upon me Waters flowed over my head and
[1:30:51] then I said I am cut off I called upon
[1:30:54] the name of the Lord out of the low
[1:30:56] dungeon and thou has heard my voice
[1:30:59] hiding out thy ear and my breathing at
[1:31:02] My Cry thou drew a sneer in that day
[1:31:05] that I called upon thee and thou set us
[1:31:07] fear not O Lord thou has pleaded the
[1:31:10] causes of my soul thou has redeemed my
[1:31:13] life amen Jeremiah there perhaps in the
[1:31:16] dungeon there the inspiration striking
[1:31:18] him amen and maybe he can hear the words
[1:31:21] of David out of the pit amen out of the
[1:31:24] monkey tomorrow amen you brought me out
[1:31:26] and maybe maybe he began to sing amen he
[1:31:29] brought me out of the Maori clay he set
[1:31:32] my feet on a rock just stay maybe maybe
[1:31:34] he began to draw a little inspiration
[1:31:36] from that amen and that's what that's
[1:31:39] what the word is there for amen that's
[1:31:41] what the message is there for amen for
[1:31:43] us it's your own inspiration in the hour
[1:31:45] that you and I live in amen if we'll
[1:31:47] look to it amen amen you could read
[1:31:49] something two years ago three or four
[1:31:52] years ago amen but in in this year amen
[1:31:55] it would be something that would mean
[1:31:56] something to you amen you you may read
[1:31:58] it and think nothing about it amen but
[1:32:00] you can be in a situation and that word
[1:32:02] will come back to you
[1:32:04] it'll come back to you in that time of
[1:32:06] need and perhaps he heard David amen he
[1:32:10] read what David wrote about that being
[1:32:11] in the muck in the mire
[1:32:15] but he said there in Lamentations he
[1:32:17] said I am cut off cut off amen amen
[1:32:20] there he was cut off from food and water
[1:32:22] and then he was cut off from from that
[1:32:24] well down there he was cut off from a
[1:32:26] from a cool drink of fresh water and
[1:32:29] been cut off from the living I mean he
[1:32:31] would think I've been put in this place
[1:32:33] to die I mean in there there in in no
[1:32:36] way in his own strength and ability
[1:32:38] would he be able to escape amen enable
[1:32:41] amen enable to be able to rise out of
[1:32:44] the pit and then to be able to rise out
[1:32:45] of the pit of your life and and that was
[1:32:47] our text this morning amen You've Got to
[1:32:49] Believe
[1:32:50] it meant to rise out of the pit and then
[1:32:52] you got to have faith amen and believe
[1:32:55] that you still have a purpose in this
[1:32:57] life amen that I'm I'm in this low point
[1:33:00] I'm in this dark place I'm in this
[1:33:02] Valley amen but you got to look up this
[1:33:04] morning you got to believe you got to
[1:33:06] you got to draw some inspiration from
[1:33:08] somewhere and believe that she got a
[1:33:10] purpose
[1:33:12] believe that she got a purpose believe
[1:33:13] that your life amen mean something to
[1:33:16] God
[1:33:17] and then if God's gonna do something for
[1:33:19] you amen what are you going to do for
[1:33:21] God
[1:33:22] amen if you're sick this morning and God
[1:33:24] heals you what are you going to do for
[1:33:26] him amen if you're in a low point of
[1:33:28] depression amen amen and you want God to
[1:33:31] deliver you what are you going to do for
[1:33:32] him amen you he's going to deliver and
[1:33:34] you're just going to go on your Merry
[1:33:35] way or you're going to have a testimony
[1:33:37] are you going to are you going to tell
[1:33:39] somebody about what God done for you
[1:33:41] that it would help bring them out amen
[1:33:43] when you're touched in your body from
[1:33:45] being sick amen and that God wants you
[1:33:47] to go forth amen with a testimony to try
[1:33:49] to help somebody else
[1:33:55] what are we going to do for God if he
[1:33:57] helps us today
[1:33:58] what are you going to do for him
[1:34:00] tomorrow
[1:34:01] say ah I don't have
[1:34:03] a great gift I don't have a great
[1:34:05] speaking ability
[1:34:07] I can't play I can't can't sing good
[1:34:11] but you can be a voice
[1:34:14] you can you can dedicate your life to
[1:34:16] him you can consecrate your life to him
[1:34:19] amen you can you can tell others about
[1:34:21] him
[1:34:22] and some of the greatest greatest times
[1:34:24] of my life I've probably said this
[1:34:25] before some of the greatest times of my
[1:34:27] life
[1:34:28] you think what's up here preaching or
[1:34:30] doing whatever and I I hardly get away
[1:34:33] with doing that sometimes
[1:34:35] but some of the greatest greatest times
[1:34:37] of my life is just witnessing to
[1:34:39] somebody
[1:34:41] such a such a presence comes down
[1:34:44] seems like when you do that and you just
[1:34:46] tell somebody about God and perhaps
[1:34:48] that's that's the first time anybody's
[1:34:50] ever spoke to him
[1:34:51] about those things
[1:34:54] hey man and I just remember this as a
[1:34:55] young man this this witnessing to people
[1:34:58] trying to do something you know trying
[1:35:00] to say something and just always
[1:35:02] remember this just kind of telling them
[1:35:04] what God done for you and God will come
[1:35:06] down on that
[1:35:07] because that's why he saved you that was
[1:35:10] the purpose that he saved you that you
[1:35:11] could tell somebody else and that they
[1:35:13] they might come to the Lord
[1:35:16] amen a soul was worth a thousand worlds
[1:35:18] worth more than a thousand worlds
[1:35:21] it's worth more than anything
[1:35:27] you got to believe that you have purpose
[1:35:28] even in the low
[1:35:30] amen you got to look to something
[1:35:32] greater greater than yourself greater
[1:35:34] greater than Ate Your Own Strength
[1:35:36] you've got to look to someone
[1:35:38] hey man we've been ordained in this hour
[1:35:40] to serve God to believe the message amen
[1:35:43] and in this hour I mean it's going to
[1:35:45] take more faith than ever

[1:35:49] to get out of this whole world it's
[1:35:50] going to take Rapture and Faith it's
[1:35:51] going to take a faith that that only
[1:35:54] individuals have had certain individuals
[1:35:56] have had but there's going to be a
[1:35:58] multi-membered body upon the earth I
[1:36:02] mean that's going to have a enough Faith
[1:36:04] the right kind of Faith they're going to
[1:36:06] draw inspiration from the word of the
[1:36:09] hour from from the message of their day
[1:36:11] they're going to be able to draw look
[1:36:13] into that and draw inspiration amen
[1:36:16] daily feeding upon the word of the Lord
[1:36:18] and they're going to be able to journal
[1:36:19] inspiration and have enough Faith a
[1:36:22] group of people not just an individual
[1:36:23] not just Jesus but the Bride of the Lord
[1:36:26] Jesus will have enough faith and then to
[1:36:28] be raptured out of this place of
[1:36:31] Destruction

[1:37:02] self-pity
[1:37:03] amen where where you're just only
[1:37:06] thinking so small you're only thinking
[1:37:08] about yourself and you get in such a low
[1:37:10] place in that complex will hinder you so
[1:37:13] much
[1:37:14] it'll keep you from serving God that
[1:37:17] that complex of self-pity that pit of
[1:37:20] self-pity rise up out of that this
[1:37:22] morning let go of your fear let the
[1:37:25] junction of God come in your life let it

[1:37:45] for a little bit here
[1:37:47] amen do you love the Lord
[1:37:51] I am in the Low Places sometimes we find
[1:37:53] ourselves and could be because of what
[1:37:55] someone else done to us it could be
[1:37:57] because of the path of life and that
[1:37:59] there was just a little place you had to
[1:38:01] be and it could be something that we've
[1:38:02] done it was the sin that we were living
[1:38:04] in
[1:38:05] amen but cry out this morning let your
[1:38:08] voice be heard
[1:38:09] as he said there are Lamentations my
[1:38:12] voice was heard and then if you draw an
[1:38:14] eye onto the Lord this morning amen he
[1:38:16] will draw now unto you is what the
[1:38:18] scripture says
[1:38:20] him in there in Jeremiah 38.
[1:38:24] I got a few more pages here than what I
[1:38:26] thought
[1:38:29] I got to read this
[1:38:31] Jeremiah 38 the seventh verse now when
[1:38:34] Abed Melech the Ethiopian one of the
[1:38:36] Enochs which was in the King's house
[1:38:38] heard that they had put Jeremiah in the
[1:38:40] dungeon the king then sitting in the
[1:38:42] gate of Benjamin ebed Malek went forth
[1:38:46] out of the King's house and spake to the
[1:38:48] king saying my Lord these men have done
[1:38:50] evil and all that they have done to
[1:38:52] Jeremiah the prophet amen whom they have
[1:38:54] cast into the dungeon and he is locked
[1:38:57] to die for hunger in the place where he
[1:38:58] is for there is no more bread in the
[1:39:00] city then the king commanded he bit my
[1:39:03] leg the Ethiopian saying take from his
[1:39:05] 30 men with thee and take up Jeremiah
[1:39:07] the prophet out of the dungeon before he
[1:39:09] die
[1:39:12] took them in with him and went to the
[1:39:14] house of the kingdom of the treasure and
[1:39:15] took that's old old cast clouds and old
[1:39:18] rotten rags and they let them down by
[1:39:20] quarters of the dungeon of Jeremiah and
[1:39:22] Eben molect the Ethiopians said unto
[1:39:24] Jeremiah putting out these old cast
[1:39:26] clouds and rotten Rags under the under
[1:39:28] your thine arm holds under the courts
[1:39:30] and Jeremiah did so so they drew
[1:39:32] Jeremiah up with the cords
[1:39:35] took him up out of the dungeon and
[1:39:37] Jeremiah remained in the court out of
[1:39:39] the prison
[1:39:40] amen
[1:39:42] the cross lifted us up
[1:39:44] he lifted us up
[1:39:46] amen but be that someone that Christ can
[1:39:48] work through to lift someone up out of
[1:39:51] their pit
[1:39:52] be that someone in this hour amen be his
[1:39:55] hands be his feet be his voice amen live
[1:39:58] for him amen I don't know what else to
[1:40:00] preach this morning and when we we all
[1:40:03] need help we all need a friend to come
[1:40:04] our way

[1:40:08] yeah amen and we got we got to look this
[1:40:10] morning to somebody higher than us
