see sister Lor's mom back there God bless you good to have you this morning each one of us that are here this morning brother Josh swims will be here this afternoon and he's bringing a little group from their Church to fellowship with us of young people so we're looking forward to that service this afternoon come if you can and support our young people Job chapter 1 and verse one says there was a man in the land of us who whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and is stewed evil there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually and then Hebrews chap 10 and verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience I think every one of us can say Amen this morning that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I want to speak to you this morning morning on trusting our sacrifice job is remarkable in the scriptures because he is a good man we know that he is the Bible tells us so we know that he's a a godly man we know that he uh and we know that he is a righteous man and we don't know that because of the testimony of his neighbors or the testimony of his friends or the testimony of even his family but we know that because of the testimony of Jehovah himself that he said he have you considered my servant job it was actually God himself that said uh job is a righteous man and that's what we want we it's one thing to have the testimony of our neighbors or the testimony of our family or the testimony of our friends but if we could have the testimony of Jehovah today if we could have the testimony of the Lord says there's a righteous man or a righteous woman and so we we find that job is a wonderful man that has lived a Godly life and God has blessed him and and he's got seven sons and three daughters he's just a he's living a good life and and and one day things begin to take a turn for the worst for job and first he loses uh everything that he has everything that he owns so it would be the equivalent today maybe of being forced to declare bankruptcy or just losing your home losing your your livestock losing everything that you own yeah and then after that he loses all of his children in one day think about that for a minute 10 children in one day he lost I know some of you have experienced great loss but this is just an overwhelming amount of loss and hardship that job is having to face so he loses first first he loses everything he owns and then he loses all of his children right and finally he loses his health and and we find that even as close closest friends believe he is a secret sinner right even his wife overtaken by grief says why don't you curse God and die yeah the the person who should have been there for him and been the strongest for him was actually turned against him everybody had turned against job everybody believed that job surely did something to deserve this kind of treatment from God they they were all in agreement that job surely was the the secret sinner surely he did something wrong but we know given the benefit of being able to look through the scriptures of what was going on we know that job that there had actually been a conversation about job but between God and the devil yeah that they had had a conversation and and job is actually suffering because God recommended him for it right so God says have you considered my servant job right he doing real good right now yeah yeah does it ever seem like that's happened in your life come on Church we've all been there we've all you know we've all seemed like things are going along just well and it seemed like God just recommends us and say have you considered and we know that because that's what God he tells us in the book but job doesn't necessarily know that job doesn't realize that God has recommended him for suffering it might have helped him to know that but he doesn't know that he he doesn't recognize that and so he doesn't know why it's just one day it happens yeah there's no explanation come on there's no warning yeah right it's not like one day he's serving God and doing good and then and then God comes and tells him says now you're going to lose this and you're going to lose that I want you to be ready for it he he wasn't ready for it right he he suddenly loses everything all at once and he loses even his own health and and we know that we know that it happened because God allowed it but job in the moment can't see that that and when he finds out about his children his response is heartbreaking and yet it strengthens our faith because we can see the kind of faith that a man could have in God the kind of confidence he could have in God in spite of what he had been through that the Bible says when he heard this the news about his children in job 1:20 then job arose and rent his mantel and shaved his head all the classic signs of of grief yeah and fell down upon on the ground right but he didn't fall down in pity all right he didn't fall down and say wo it's me he didn't fall down and say well I'm I'm done I I'm not going to serve God no more but what did he fall down and do Church come on he fell down in worship and that's the kind of people that God wants today I believe that's what he's made us to be that when we go through the very darkest moments of our life the very worst times of Life We Fall Down and Worship because we're not God and we don't understand necessarily what's going on in the throne room of Heaven but we know that God is good and he's doing it for our good somehow job says Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name oh yes of the Lord right it's one thing to say I know I come with nothing I know I leave with nothing it's another thing to say the lord gave and the Lord has taken away but look at his response to that it's not I'm going to blame the Lord I'm going to say there's no God I'm going to blame the message of the hour that's not his response at all but what does he say I came naked of the world I'll go out naked Lord gives the Lord's taken away blessed be the name I wonder if there'd be somebody here this morning that could say that with Jo blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to worship in spite of my circumstances I'm going to worship in spite of everything going on around me yes blessed be the name of the Lord Lord good brother brandom said he was actually happy when he heard the news that his children had passed away not happy that they'd passed but he was happy that he made a sacrifice for his children in chapter 2 satan goes to God again in verse six the Lord said to Satan behold he's in thine hand yeah but save his life so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smoked job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown and he took him a potur to scrape himself with a and he sat down among the ashes let's join him on the ash sheep here for a moment then then said his wife unto him Dost thou still retain thine Integrity Curse God and die but he said unto her thou speakest he didn't call her a foolish woman but he said you speak like a foolish woman thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips job doesn't really lose lose it as we would say he doesn't really lose his composure until it's three church friends his friends came calling brandom said in one place it was three people from a different church and another place there three people from his church in one place he said it was three deacons glad we got good deacons yeah but they come looking for him in in job 2:12 when they lifted up their eyes a far off and knew him not he he was so they'd always seen job prosperous they'd always seen job with money and with with things and they look out and see job's suffering right right and they don't recognize job in that condition so they when they knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent everyone his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great have you ever been in a situation where the pain was so real you didn't know what to to say so you just sat there you just sit there say well we're here but we don't know what to say we don't know what to do cuz there is no words that could make up for what had happened in job's life and they saw his grief was very great and after this job 3 And1 job opened job his mouth and cursed his day and if you go read it job gets really down and he says it' been better for me not to live he was a good man but he was still affected by things that happened in his life right and I don't think we should expect people you know sometimes you say well as we preached last week on counted all joy and we expect people say well just have a smile on their face it's not what that means it means that you count it Joy you you you arrange your thoughts you you control your thoughts it's not that you feel Joy because you're not always going to feel Joy you're not always going to feel happy let me go a little bit further you're not always going feel saved come on now right you're not always going to feel saved you're not always going to feel uh upsid instead the back seid you're not always going to feel like you've got a one-on-one connection with God you're not always going to feel like your prayers are going through but it's in those moments when you don't feel it that's when you you got to take your thoughts into captivity and say Lord I know your word is true I know you're the same yesterday today and forever I Know You're My Healer whether I feel healed or not I know you're my savior can anybody testify to that this morning whether I feel saved or not I know you're my deliverer whether I feel like I'm in bondage or delivered he said why am I alive why have I ever was I ever born he said been better for me to have never been born yeah and then if he wasn't feeling bad enough his friends started to talk it's bad enough when they were quiet now they start to talk all right and when they started to talk he saidis not this thy fear this is the the first of his friends as they begin to talk as there's a great back and forth in job between job and his three friends and then elu who's the type of Christ and then finally God speaks but in job 4 the first of his three friends begin to talk said is not this thy Fear Thy confidence so he's challenging job he's saying you're saying that this has happened to you he said there must be a reason why it's happening and he said is not your confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways but they had misplaced job's confidence right they looked at it and the thing is if you go and read what the friend said it was all true stuff right it's not it's not untrue but it doesn't apply to job's situation right and sometimes the devil can take the word and beat you up with it yeah right because it may be true right right but it doesn't apply to your situation come on right it may be true there are people there are people who be lost and go to hell yeah but if you're a born again child of God that doesn't apply to your situation right there are people who are backset but if you're willing to give your heart to God this morning that doesn't apply to your situation right are you with me now there's situations that are uh where people where it's hopeless but hopelessness never applies to the believer's situation because there's hope even even if if a Believer would die he's not going to stay in the grave he he he's coming up out of there's a body prepared as uh I believe brother Joel said uh Wednesday night there's already a body prepared for you you you can't lose aren't you glad for that today but but see they so these things were maybe true statements but they didn't apply to job and we need to make careful that we don't make the bride the church we need to make be careful that we don't apply those things that are given we're not L to sins come on now right we live in Leo DEA but we're not L to sins and if we begin to think of ourselves as Le the sin well well I'm lukewarm because that's just the age no that's not what we're supposed to be we're supposed to be on fire for God we're not God is not knocking at the door of the Bride to get in he's knocking at the door of the church to get in but that the the bride is in a different place in communion with him we've opened the door and let him in we should not you know our services shouldn't be cold and formal why because because we're not a part of the cold formal church we don't Place ourselves under that we we place our identity as the bride we are loved by God are you with me now we are chosen by God elected by God called by God into a place beyond what any we've ever could see or hoped to be God is we we're going to heaven we're going to make it right and so these things may have been true but not true of job oh my yeah and sometimes you sometimes you got to think about yourself as I'm just preaching to you now from my heart but you got to think of yourself as the exception to the rule yeah that makes sense look at the our phenician woman and she comes to Jesus and and he speaks to her what the rule is yeah right he's the word and he's speaking to her the word yeah and he says the dog he said the it's not meat for me it's not it's not uh the the the procedure is not for me to give uh the the meat or or the uh the children's bread to dogs he said it's not it's not right for me to do that it's not the Gentiles time it's not their era yeah but she said that's true yes sir that's true oh my but it doesn't apply to me hallelujah it's true but it doesn't apply to me because even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table you can find Hope in the word of God if you're looking for Hope in the word of God many times the reason people find judgment and condemnation and and fear is because that's all they're looking for the devil's got them tricked into looking for that but we're not to do that we're to look for joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and kindness and the good things of God are you with me now not we understand we can be corrected we understand but he deals with us as Sons he doesn't deal with us as as somebody out here in the world somewhere but we're his sons and daughters and he deals with us that way yes so his friend comes and says isn't this your confidence he said remember I pray thee whoever perish being innocent he said where were the righteous cut off right and it's true but not true of job's situation yeah even as I have seen they that plow iniquity so w wickedness reap the same it's true but not true of job's situation so his best friends come and called him a sinner people from his church people that loved him or confessed that they did yeah brother BR said listen job knew in his heart that he wasn't a secret sinner right now how did he know that CU you realize you could commit sin if you were just as a sinner You' commit sin you could commit sin and not even know it yeah right we miss the mark all the time right right I pray God Purge cleanse me from Secret sins that's the way David puts it yeah right those things I don't even know about right we could miss the mark and not even recognize right we had anything to repent for yeah how did job know that he wasn't a secret sinner it wasn't because of his goodness it wasn't because although he does tried to defend himself in that way he said I he said I I I I've made a covenant with my eyes he said that I wouldn't look on a maid so he said I haven't sinned with women he said I haven't sinned with money I've given to the poor I haven't sinned in my in my words I've I've declared my allegiance to God though he saves me yet I'll trust him right he he said I'm not a sinner in that way and we can look at our own lives and see those things the fruit of our lives but how did he know come on now come on Church the same way that you can know right why he had made a sacrifice something had died in his place I know this is simple this morning but I want us to understand it from the very depths of our soul because it's probably the question I deal with more than any other other thing as a pastor is I is how do I know that I'm not being punished how do I know that God doesn't hate me how do I know that God's just not making me pay for what I did because you were in his body on the cross we were in him on the cross brother Brandon preaches that to us in Christ is the mystery of God revealed that the bride was a mystery hid in Christ on the cross yeah as Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed he we were in him which means we died in him yeah remember after he died they pierced his side and the blood and the water come out and it was separated the bride was separated from the groom don't you real that means when when he died we were in him which means every sin you ever did all right or you ever would do all right is Judge I hope I can drive this home this morning is Judge in that body right so when he died that's why the cross is so important to us brother bam tells in uh in a be certain of God he said he said there's nothing that'll bring the fire he said they've never found anything that'll bring fire like two sticks across that's true of the church too yeah right there's never been anything that'll that'll produce fire that'll burn like like two sticks if you preach the truth about the cross cuz what does the cross do the cross means that the sin has already been judged in our life we cannot be judged for sin God doesn't see right and how can you see sin pastor the death of his own son on the cross how can he see through the blood of the one who died for us I'm not giving you a license to sin this morning if you ever knew what God did for you you would never want to do anything that would cause you to miss the Mark again you'd want to be in the house of God you'd want to be but those things don't save you you if you ever realize what God did for you you'd want to be a good Christian yeah are you with me if you ever wanted to if you ever realize what God did for you on the cross you you'd want to work if you were a and provide for your family because that's what Christians do right if you ever you'd want to pay your bills you'd want to be a good person in the community if you ever wanted if you ever knew what he did for you really knew what he did for you you'd want to dress right and look right and live right all right but those things don't save you you were you were in him on the cross yes and your sins were judged in him right yeah yes sir oh church we just recognize that today and there's there's only one way to be welcomed back into fellowship with God again and that's through the man Christ Jesus that's the only way yeah so job knew in his heart that he wasn't a secret sinner because he confessed his sins upon the basis of the shed blood remember the lamb was shed the lamb was killed before the foundation of the world right and that's why they could take the Lamb of a bowl or goat or or the blood of a bowl or a goat or a lamb in the Old Testament it would cover sin yeah the offering had to be made once a year it would cover sin it put it off because in the mind of God the Lamb of God was already expained yeah right so it put it off but it had to happen in actuality yeah so that you and I could be completely free from sin right but job confessed his sins under the basis of the shed blood he knew that God was under obligation yes to meet him on those basis right the only propitiation for sin that's payment atonement right was the shed blood of the Lamb yeah which God promised Redemption as a shadow to last until Christ come and job had met God on those basis yes not by how much money he'd given away not by how many times he'd gone to church are you hearing me church not by how much ties he paid he did not meet God that way right but he met God by offering the sacrifice that God required yes somehow job had a revelation even before the Bible was written that when man fell God required a sacrifice to cover his sins I don't know maybe he saw it in the heavens yeah right when he looked up and he saw it maybe he heard the story of how Adam fell and what had to happen there at the Garden for him to be redeemed right when they walked out with the bloody sheep skin slapping up against her leg Yeah and and so maybe it heard the story story maybe he'd seen it in the heavens maybe which was God's first Bible written in the heavens maybe maybe he had seen or he'd heard or somehow he understood from nature that that God that something had taken place and Redemption had to happen for there to be a resurrection and when man fell God required a sacrifice to cover sin somehow he knew that by Revelation he knew that he had confidence he had done what God had required he knew that the welcome mat at the door of fellowship with God right is the shed blood of a lamb Stuart when you read that quote the other day and I believe it was you read the quote I had a welcome man in it God's welcome man I just about danced a jig and I went back and looked it up brother the random says over and over again the blood is a welcome mat for us to come back into the house of God it's a welcome mat back into Fellowship I couldn't come in I was barred from the house of God but the blood of the Lamb become a big old sign big old M said welcome in and when I walk across it I'm coming on God's shed blood the basis of his shed blood and I am not responsible for my sins anymore my sins were judged at Calvary right oh I hope you hear me today good what do you need to do you say brother Ben I've I've lived a bad life I've done things I shouldn't have done I've messed up just come through the door the door is Christ the welcome mat is the blood just walk through the door yeah everything's different on the other side of the door there's welcome on the other side of the door I'd say to those of back those who who have left the house of God some of you young people you get cold on God just walk through the door come through the shed blood you don't trust in your own Merit you come through the shed blood and say Lord I'm willing to accept you for what you are what you are to me look at job as he has this Revelation but he's suffering he's suffering many times we suffer and we and we realize that suffering you know God allows us to suffer if we couldn't feel it it wouldn't really be suffering Jesus actually felt the pain of the nails yes God didn't send down a a batch of Lidocaine or some kind of painkiller yeah for Jesus on the cross right he had to feel every yes oh church he felt every prick of the name yeah he felt every stab of the thorns on his head he felt the whip on his back he actually felt it and we feel the death of a loved one right we feel rejection we feel persecution we actually feel it but it doesn't mean he doesn't love us but we have to feel it for our character to be formed into the image he wants us to be right job actually felt the sorrow yes he felt the pain and he was so he was unable to even act in a regular way W well get up off the ground get up off the as sheep job how is he going to get out of the as sheep he feels it yeah right he knows it's real yeah true but yet he knows there's a redeemer all right he knows he's made his sacrifice he knows and just as real as the pain it's the freedom from the pain just as real as the Hopeless is the Hope yes just as real as every door that closes is the open door and the welcome man in front of it where he says come on in oh my come on to Freedom oh there is therefore now no condemnation don't you want to walk through that door there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I'm challenging you today I know you feel the pain I know you went through the hurt I know we've done many things many times that that aren't right but if we would just recognize he is the door don't you want to walk through that door where there is no condemnation where there is freedom from sin where you don't have the question of sin on you anymore right good yes Hallelujah job really feels it in job 19:21 he said have pity upon me have pity upon me oh ye my friends for the hand of God ha touched me why do you persecute me as God it's a good question he said why are you placing yourselves like your God like you know why job was wise enough to know that if God didn't give him an answer they sure didn't have an answer why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book yeah that they were graving with an iron pin LED in the rock forever for I know all right I know how many can say it with him this morning I know that my redeemer liveth I know that my redeemer liveth I may be going through pain but I know my redeemer liveth I may have experienced hardship but I know my redeemer liveth I know that my redeemer liveth and and that he will stand at the latter day upon the Earth listen many things job says in the Book of Job any unbeliever could say God where are you God why aren't you addressing my situation many things he said any unbeliever could say but there were moments of inspiration that only a Believer could speak and it was that moment it's the moment that makes the difference many people experience what we experience many people experience hardship and struggle and and unexplainable things that happened to them in their lives and yet at the same time though these things are common to man but only a few have that inspiration in their soul and said I know yes I'm suffering yes I've been through it yes I've got some hard times going on but I know my redeemer living there was he was he was just a man he was just a man speaking but now it's God speaking through a man by inspiration out of the heart out of a troubled life out of struggle yeah God is speaking good David many of the things David said anybody could have said when he said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me God was speaking through his pain yes all right speaking of the Cross that's good I know my redeemer liveth and in the last day he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh what a powerful statement yes job had never read 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye like he never read that he'd never read first Thessalonians 4 where he said the I will not have you be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep he never read it he didn't have it to read but something in his heart grabbed a hold of the truth of the resurrection and he said I may be going through it but I'm not this is not the end there's something more for me yes sir yes though this body decay in the grave yeah yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another oh my Reigns be consumed within me though the very DNA that I'm made from go back to dust dust to dust and Ashes to Ashes yet I know I will seek God he said I know I haven't sinned I've offered the sacrifice I put the sacrifice out there just according to God's word and I believe that God has accepted it not a sinner yeah I wonder if we can cross over that threshold today come across the door come through the the door with the welcome mat laying there if you could walk across that today and quit thinking of yourself as a sinner as I know I haven't sinned if I'm going through something I know there's a purpose for it I know God has forgiven me he said well I did things yesterday but but you ask for forgiveness today it's that close to you you just ask him for forgiveness and he gives it to you abundantly over and over again If any man sin there is an advocate yes sir oh I'm so thankful for the advocate today yes can you see it this morning can can you walk through the door the welcome mat is there oh my job brother said by inspiration somehow grabbed a hold of it he was talking about how how he looked at a flower he said well the flower dies yeah he said so so there must be he said it's like sin he dies from sin but there's a resurrection so there must be Redemption right the flower dies because of sin right in the beginning the flowers has never died the flower died because of sin but the reason the flower comes back is to show us there's a resurrection amen some morning there's a resurrection some spring Hall church I could just I could just bust a move this morning and that would be Supernatural if I could dance I'm not even sure that's a good thing but are you with this morning he knew if the if the if the flower had hope of redemption surely mankind has got some hope right I don't care what situation you're in this morning how dark it may seem how how dark your mind has gotten how how deep you are in a depressed state I know that my redeemer liveth I know I know if there's if there's hope for the flow There's Hope for me there's hope for you yes that's why we need to get to the place where we get to this place of where we're walking in the light of the word we've walked through the door we're not up and down all the time in and out all the time right come on I'm not criticizing you I'm telling you walk through the door come to the door come into the place yes I'm I struggle yes I go through things but it don't get me down momentarily I may have a frown on my face but pretty soon a smile is going to light it up because I don't no matter what they do to me right yeah I'll be okay yes the devil could put Paul and Silas in prison but he couldn't take away their Joy couldn't take their song heard a song One Time said I I've lost a lot of things lost a lot of good friends lost a lot of people but I never lost my praise job said I lost my family but I worship you Lord I've been through some things but blessed be the name yes yes Hallelujah good why he knew his there was hope there was a redeemer and job seen what the lamb meant the said he got it by Revelation he saw what the lamb meant he shook himself stood up being a prophet the Spirit come on him he said I know my redeemer liveth oh there you are why I've come on the basis of redemption I've come offering the shed blood that represents his blood this is the type this is the lamb we have much more reason to be confident than job did much more reason Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and two perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered in other words if they made if they took took away the desire of sin wouldn't they have been offered once and that was good enough he said they would not have ceased to be offered because the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience or desire of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year yeah right and that's the way some people live oh my yeah you realize that if you if you don't take advantage of the open door and walk walk into the blood of Christ you're living the law all right with no sacrifice that's right right because the sacri you can't you're not going and dragging a bulll or a goat and the truth is if if I did it today if I tried to well I'll cover it it's not effective anymore the day that the that he died on the cross the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom the ceremonial law was done away with come on feel well I don't eat pork I don't I I worship on Saturday I do this that or the other the ceremonial was done away with yeah right that day on Calvary that law passed away and the and and the law of Liberty was born right and only in that so you're trying to live a law but you you couldn't we couldn't even do it if we tried to make a sacrifice correctly we probably couldn't even find a cow without a without a spot on it right a red hifer they've been trying to get a red heffer in Jerusalem for years so they could make a sacrifice and been unable to do it to find one perfect enough to find one with they've been breeding them just to produce pure efforts and every time they do they they they find one that's got a a little white spot on it or a little bit of something on it that's a little different color and it's got to be a pure red effort don't you realize Christ abolished the law don't you real he fulfilled the law on Calvary and we don't put ourselves under those bondages again right Paul said oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you that you'd come under those bondage those bondages of the law again but see if they had been any good they would not there would not be a remembrance of sin right for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins jump to verse 11 he said every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man who's the man can we identify the man this morning the man Christ Jesus this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever yeah come on Church forever he don't have to die again every time you make a mistake right I hope you're hearing me he don't die again every time we mess up forever someone say it with me forever he sat down on the right hand of God he made one offering forever Hallelujah from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he have perfected forever all right them that are Sanctified hallelujah hallelujah brother BR said all the way from Eden job would make a sacrifice pour out the blood of a lamb and through that blood he would confess his wrong yeah may God be merciful to me now I approach thee through the blood that's what we got to come through the shed blood and there job offered the shed blood as he approached Jehovah knowing that God would receive him not upon nothing else huh maybe not be perfect English but it it makes sense to me we do not approach him in the name of a good man we don't approach him by works he will not accept that we don't approach him again if you're a born again believer there's things you'll do but that's not how we approach God you know you don't come up here and say Lord Lord I need healing today God I paid my taxes woohoo you know it's the right to do obey the law of Caesar maybe I shouldn't preach on that but it's the right thing to do God I didn't speed on the way to church today I'm going to approach you on that right today you realize that's how people come and many times our young people are the biggest are the ones who come the most like that it's like well today I'm feeling down so I must need I must need him and you do need him and I want you to come but look you don't you don't approach God God because of what you've done say well when I feel good enough then I'll start going to church that's not how we approach God when I get to where I'm you know everything's settled then I'll go to church maybe you young people say well I you know I'm conflicted right now I don't know what I want to do with my life and so I'll just stay out of church until later no come come to the come to the altar come to the place where Mercy is come to the house of God there's people here that won't judge you sure there will always be job's comforters yeah there's always going to be people who look down on other people but there's also people who love God and recognize that there's something bigger than what's going on than what they can see is going on there's a bigger God than what they even understand and so when you get in that place many times I see young people come up in a prayer line and and and I believe in prayer lines but we'll see young people come up in prayer lines and and they feel like they got to get resaved and they're looking for a specific emotional experience in the prayer line that's not what we're looking for right but what how do you come in the prayer line he said lay hands on the sick yeah and they shall recover so when I come in the prayer line I'm not coming looking for an emotional experience although if I believe that I've been saved or healed I might shout or dance or anything else yeah when I feel his presence it does something to me but I'm not coming looking for an emotional experience I'm coming looking by the word Lord you said you would heal me if I don't come on my works well I won't go today because today I don't feel good that's probably the day to go right I today I don't feel like shout see it's not put on you know sometimes I know people say brother Ben you always back the word well it's because the word is always true yeah right is it ever not true then I always back the word cuz I don't back based on how I feel right right I back based on if it's true or not yeah right I Don't Clap my hands in church because oh today I justoo hand clapping day you know my hands feel good it's not why you clap your hands you clap your hands because he's worthy yeah you raise your hands because he's worthy yeah come on church we don't approach him in the name of a good man we don't even approach him in the name of a prophet right right we don't approach him by works right we don't approach him and say Lord I know I know I know that you you know I believe brother brandom I believe in in a prophet in this age and that makes me worthy that doesn't make you worthy right right it doesn't do it what what do you have to approach him by by the welcome mat the prophet told us what the welcome mat was you got to approach him by the blood how do you do that look the Christian will do these basic things but that's not what we rely on yeah brother B said no matter who you are how bad you've been if you'll come God's provided way through the sacrificial blood taking and laying your hand upon the head of a dead lamb yeah one of you boys going to have to be a dead lamb of the miles put his hand on the head of a dead lamb I felt the life leave the body all right right that's all job could do he could not pay for his own sins come on now right he was not perfect enough to pay for his own sins but a little innocent lamb died for his sins so all he could do is come in sincerity lay his hands on the head of the lamb and feel the life leave the lamb sir if you'll come God's provided way through the sacrificial blood taking and laying your hand upon the head of a Dying lamb and confess your wrong and accept him then God will fill your soul with the Holy Spirit do we believe this is true or don't we is it the word of God or isn't it if you lay your hand on the head of a Dying lamb and you believe it he will fill your soul with the Holy Spirit burning out all iniquity carnality making you a new creature yeah good job had met that requirement he didn't have he didn't have he couldn't by Faith Like We Do lay our hands and surrender ourselves to a to a Living Sacrifice he couldn't do that so he had to take that dying lamb yeah right and he had to lay his church he had to lay his hands on a literal dying lamb but he had such confidence in that yes he could leave there and say I'm not a sinner yeah and nothing you can do can convince me I'm a sinner right cuz I met God's requirements yes right he had to take his be slam of the first year perfect without blemish and take it in complete sincerity lay it on the altar that's why I chose you miles the best lamb sleepy lamb this morning but the best lamb take it in complete sincerity lay it on the altar lay his hands on it feel the life leaving the body now what can we do again we we can't we' go kill Lambs all day long all we'd have is a bunch of dead lambs and a mess I remember I think I've told you this before but I remember when we were kids our neighbors we had neighbors just down the street but we lived on at the end of a dead end Road and we were out in the country but we did have one neighbor and we had some goats and the dogs got a hold of one of the goats some dogs come through and got a hold of one of the goats and they dragged it over in their yard they thought we were a cult anyway so that dog we found out through the grap Vine that the neighborhood was telling it they were telling everybody that we were sacrificing goats down there at the end of that road we were sacrificing we could have sacrificed every goat we had all you got is dead goats you can sacri church when you get done doing all your works all you got is Works say well I'm a good citizen that's good yeah when you get done with all of that you still got to lay your hands on the head of the Lamb right we come by faith and lay our hands on that lamb that is how do I do that I lift my hands and surrender I'm laying my hands I'm surrendering myself to the lamb that is already offered repenting of my sins believing that the life of the blood the Holy Spirit himself will come back on me to cause me to live a Christian Life see we've got to know that we were guilty but he has taken our guilt listen what uh Peter told them to do in Acts 2:36 he said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom ye have Cru crucified sir he said you're guilty of this crucifying the Lord both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart it's like somebody stabbed them in the heart when they heard the word of God why there was something there that could be pricked and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do how can I get out from under this condemnation how can I get out from under this conviction and Peter said unto them repent what are you doing laying your head on the your hand on the head of the Lamb repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost do we believe this or don't we God just laid out the welcome mat that day and 3,000 Souls yes walk through the door brother brandom tells us the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost it's not not a tape right it's not a little house you make for a tape it's not listening to a certain tape it's not listening to a certain preacher it's not going to Camp yeah well all our kids I think most of them are going to camp and I'm so happy for that but that's not our token our token's not jumping or dancing or shouting or speaking in tongues our token is the life of God himself it comes back in The Believer it's not a blood a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today God must see the token he must see it in every one of us 1 Corinthians 12:13 for by one Spirit someone say it with me one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bonded or free have been all made to drink into one Spirit the blood intercedes for us the spirit speaks on our behalf we cannot sin his seed remains in us when we are recommended by God for trials listen that is not because God hates us we can be like job say Lord I Got Confidence not in myself but in the sacrifice that I made I come God's provided way we need to trust our sacrifice brother BR said you can't be saved on what you see you got to be saved on what you believe you're not saved by feelings you're not healed by feelings he said why when I was first converted to receive the Holy Spirit the devil beat me harder than he ever did listen to me young people you receive theol Holy Ghost and the devil will beat you until you think you don't have it no more you'll go to camp and get a good experience you'll he at the altar you'll have an experience with God and the devil will beat you up on that all right you young men don't you understand that the devil's going to beat you that's his job yeah he's going to try to make you make you feel like you and you'll make a mistake and you'll say oh no I must not have got anything all right why don't you cast down that devil repent of your mistake and move on God I'm sorry I Know You're My Healer I know my redeemer lives yeah come on Budd it's good he said I'm I'm I'm saved because he said I still believed I had the Holy Ghost because I had met God's requirements yeah I'm not saved tonight because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved tonight because I met God's requirements in his word God is under obligation to take care of me if I meet those requirements well somebody says I'm saved cuz I feel good drunkers do that the devil can beat you around around the stump on on your feelings but when he meets the word of God he can't come on that and God brought salvation and Divine Healing so simple that the weakest Christian can have every attribute of his life oh that just blessed me when I saw it the weakest Christian what do you need this morning what the what is the attribute of God that you need is it peace is it Joy is it Longs s what is it that you need he said the weakest Christian that's me this morning the weakest Christian can have every someone say every every attribute of his life why because his life lives in you you've come God's provided way that that's the that's the door it's open you come on into the house where the good things are come on over to the side where the blessings are come on over to the house where the banquet is spread and the Feast of the Lord is going on Christian can have the weakest Christian can have every attribute of his life yeah right but without faith the Bible says it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must someone say must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him brother brand said this said may this go way down deep and never move from you yes sir if youve met God's requirements in your heart you believe that he is God is only testing your faith for he loves to do that you've confessed your sin you met every requirement that God requires I'm resisting the urge to tell you that I'm closing I I heard you brother Bill we don't need to keep saying it we just need to do it he still he lays silent remember faith says that he is then Faith holds on to it I'm resisting the urge to say I'm closing like brother Stuart resists to saying amen I'm sorry not knowing what it's all about you can laugh it's all right brother Stuart loves me I I I think well I think he still does he's hiding behind the sun back there I can't really see your face without my glasses so it's all right Faith holds on to it not knowing what it's all about but it knows that he is and it's certain that he is glory to God remember if he is how many believe he exists today he is then his words has to be true and if he required you to meet these circumstances and you did he is obligated to take care of his word job knew he wasn't a sinner not because he was a good man but because of the sacrifice listen if you were liow on being a good man somebody's going to find a in your armor there's going to be a spot on your clothes somewhere come on church we got some good men here good good ladies our elders my I tell you what you talk about we were worshiping a little bit yesterday we were laughing a lot there's some people have been through some things through their character has been molded and I know the rest of you Elders your character's been molded by the things that you've been through yeah you've been through some things you've seen some things as they say but but yet if the the most illustrious Christian the greatest Christian we could find would have some spot yeah something that they'd missed something they'd done wrong I'm so glad I don't rely on that but I rely upon the blood that he he's always perfect he's never lost a battle he's just testing my faith Hallelujah he said when we job was certain there was a God and he had met the requirements oh he said I feel religious he knew that he met God's requirements and that settles that God was testing his faith he'll test yours yeah he'll test mine but when we met his requirements repent what is his requirements now Church repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's his promise any among you sick call the Elders of the church let them anoint in oil and pray over the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up that settles it confess your faults one to another and pray one for another you've met God's requirements these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils they speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things they shall not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that settles it do you believe it this morning be certain of God be sure that in your heart that you believe that that's God's word job was his wife said why don't you curse him and die why you're getting worse all the time how Satan likes to throw that at you come on why you're no better than you was when you was anointed you're no better than you was when them preachers prayed for you then preachers ain't right in the first place all right you've heard him say it on it doesn't matter about that preacher it's your faith in the Living God that mounts he said not what the preacher is it's what God is the preacher never made the promise God made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to God and your faith to believe that it is God so be of God be certain that it's God that's God's word and God is in his word hallelujah when trouble struck job he had offered the burnt offering come upon the only grounds that God will receive a Believer on the burnt sacrifice and the blood so when trouble struck his house God was a present help in the time of trouble when they accused him of being a secret sinner he knew he was righteous with God because he had met God's requirements he could say I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand on the earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God yeah he knew he had come God's provided way he didn't come by the membership of his church he come by God's sacrifice right that's what God required yeah we need to get away from the fear and the scare say well if I go to a certain church I can be saved nonsense if I sit under a pre certain preacher I can be saved nonsense have you come through the door the the welcome m is not the preacher the welcome m is not the building amen the welcome m is the blood of Jesus Christ amen good Hallelujah this is where I met God's requirements John 5:24 verily verily I say un he that heareth my words brother Brown said that hearing is understanding what do you have to understand that you're a sinner and he's a savior yeah are you hearing me he that understandeth my word you'll believe the word of the hour because that's the only thing the Holy Spirit can believe believeth on him that sent me hath past tense everlasting life and shall not someone say it with me shall not come into condemnation but his past condemnation is Judgment he will not be at the white Throne judgment if he's there it'll only be as a part of the Bride he'll sit in judgment but he will not receive judgment because he was already passed from Death un life this is for Real Believers yes we know there's three kinds of Believers make Believers unbelievers and real Believers I wonder how many real Believers we have I trust that we all are this morning job was a real believer sometimes Believers are put to the test the said not sometimes every time for every son that cometh to God must be chased and tried child trained remember the trials the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God living through them the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand God knows what the limit is for you and he will will not tempt you beyond what you're able he will not do it you may feel like you're not able but we don't go by feelings he promised us that in his word he will oh church he will not put up more on us than we can bear if he put it on you he knew you could bear it are you hearing me this morning that's a promise of the word if he put it on you he knew you could bear it look at people all the time I say I couldn't do what they're doing I couldn't go through that I don't think I could but if he ever put it on me it's because he knew knew he wasn't surprised by he knew I could bear it amen job went through trials and tests the children taken everything taken church members come accused him of being a secret sinner tried to say everything against him yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knew he had met God's requirements he knew there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knew it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe his sickness was God doing it he had job whipped when job once struck that Revelation it was not God God allowed it but it was not God are you with me now let's get this straight God allowed it but it was not God God even recommended him but it was not God that caused the sickness it's a devil he said it was not God he was only going through his trial to make him something it wasn't God doing it was Satan doing it right the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things is you're God trying to put punishment upon you I think he ought to just settle it it isn't so right I've had preachers tell me well this happened cuz God was punishing me It Isn't So no sir good he'll correct you he'll mold your character but he will not punish you for sin he cannot if you are under the blood if you've come through the door it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you're I love that to make you see if you are are tied I almost said it if you are tied to this Earth by Earth cares yeah right I'm just going to close there brother Robert I got quite a bit more but we're just going to close on this it's you it's God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your Treasures is in heaven yes for wherever your Treasures is there you are also right job was a believer in Trials he was a believer in persecution he was a Believer he was a genuine believer so what does that mean if I'm a True Believer and he's a real Savior and I've come his provided way he is not a liar he's not a man that he could repent he's not a God who fails sometimes yeah he doesn't lift one up and fail on another one but everyone who comes to him he will in no wise cast out right thank you you say well what if I'm not predestined if you were not predestined there wouldn't be a desire in your heart to come the very fact you have a desire in your heart is proof God is dealing with you sir and if you had crossed the line somewhere there would be no desire to come but if there is a desire to come Fellowship with me on this thought I was a sinner I was born in sin shaped in iniquity but one day the word was preached and my heart was pricked I believe that Jesus died for my sins I repented of my sins was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I was sealed by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence being that my desire changed and now I say Amen to every word of God and that Holy Spirit has led me into all truth this is my confidence we know musicians go ahead and come Romans 8:28 we know can we say it together we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose right Hallelujah sir let's bow our heads together we know job said I know [Music] his friend said job you can't be sure you you can't be how could you be absolutely [Music] sure I'm sure because I come God's provided way if I get disgruntled with the church that will not separate me from God if my brother or my sister or my mother or my father forsake me that will not separate me from God why the door was open One Day by faith I remember and I've been here long enough now here at the church I remember when some of you I remember the day when some of you walk through that door and you come across the welcome M and things have never been the same in your life again you ought to hold on to that I was a sinner but one day I walked through the door and when I come through God's Open Door of Fellowship I walked across the welcome man of the blood and I cannot be judged for sin any longer so I will not listen to the LIE of the devil I will not accept the lie that tells me I'm being punished in some way for my sin my sin was judged in you Lord on the cross will not lie let allow the devil to lie to make me lie I know what the truth is the truth is I'm forgiven the truth is I'm redeemed the truth is no matter how I feel at the moment or what trial I'm going through I trust my sacrifice can we do that this morning if you haven't come God's provided way the altar is open we can put water in the pool if you have trust him through the trials of Life Lord I know that I've come know I've come across the door will not let nothing shake me Paul says what can separate me from the love of God tribulation or or or distress or or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword he said we we're counted as sheep for the slaughter that's just our life that's just the grab bag of life but in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come or height nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord it's time we believe that word and accepted it as ours Hallelujah let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus where there's those who have not come through the door I pray God that you'd call them today Lord may they see the open door while it's still

to come back to this ground and say right here I knew I met God's requirements I've been saved may we be like that Lord I pray that this would be our our ground oh God we can know that we have met
