[47:08] Heavenly Father
[47:11] Lord as we approach your word this
[47:13] morning
[47:15] I ask you Lord to come and move me out
[47:17] of the way
[47:18] take away all of my thoughts Lord and
[47:21] may it be only what you would have for
[47:23] the people this morning Lord maybe
[47:25] there'd be some need represented here
[47:27] that I wouldn't even know about but Lord
[47:30] You've laid this on my heart and maybe
[47:32] it'll address that in some way
[47:34] Lord I know that you're a supernatural
[47:36] God
[47:37] and you use men you choose to do that
[47:40] Lord so I ask you to come in this vessel
[47:43] of clay forgive me Lord if I've done or
[47:46] said anything that would be unlike you
[47:48] Lord where we've missed the mark as a
[47:50] church oh God I pray you'd forgive us
[47:53] today Lord we thank you for your blood
[47:54] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[47:58] for your love oh God I pray you just
[48:00] move in this in this building this
[48:02] morning Lord I pray for conviction and
[48:04] hearts I pray you'd move Lord and in a
[48:07] miraculous way is only you can or we
[48:11] can't change the minds of people much
[48:13] less their hearts but you can do that
[48:15] Lord and I pray God that you would do it
[48:17] this morning we love you and we thank
[48:19] you and we give you the praise and the
[48:21] glory and the honor in Jesus name amen
[48:25] God bless you you can be seated
[48:31] the creator of all things is the truth
[48:36] if you want to know what the truth is
[48:38] about a flower you should go to the
[48:42] person who created the flower if you
[48:45] want to know what the truth is and I'm
[48:47] talking about the truth I'm not talking
[48:48] about what we can find out
[48:50] scientifically about it but the truth of
[48:53] it then you would go to the one who
[48:56] created it and that Creator is the truth
[48:59] because everything that he created came
[49:02] out of him
[49:04] and so he is the truth about life if you
[49:07] want to know what the truth is about
[49:10] marriage and and how your marriage
[49:12] should go you should go back to the
[49:14] Creator because he's the one who created
[49:17] marriage if you want to know what the
[49:19] truth is about a family you should go
[49:21] back to the the creator of the family
[49:25] and find out what that is and many
[49:27] people today would search many different
[49:29] places for the truth but we believe the
[49:32] truth is not a church the truth is not a
[49:34] Creed the truth is not a Doctrine the
[49:37] truth is a person and that person is
[49:39] Jehovah God who came down in a body of
[49:42] Flesh became flesh and became the word
[49:45] or the truth in our day Jesus
[49:48] self-identified he identified himself as
[49:51] the truth in John 14 6 Jesus said unto
[49:55] him I am the way the truth and the life
[49:58] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[50:01] so he's saying I am the truth
[50:05] how many believe that today
[50:07] he is God's expressed truth on the world
[50:12] today now hang with me because we're
[50:14] going somewhere this morning and he is
[50:17] the word the word that come from God
[50:21] took on a body was made flesh and dwelt
[50:25] Among Us John 1 1 in the beginning was
[50:27] the word and the Word was with God and
[50:31] the Word was God and the word verse 14
[50:35] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[50:38] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[50:41] only begotten of the father full of
[50:43] grace and truth we find in the scripture
[50:47] that God cannot lie how many believe
[50:49] that today what a comfort that is to us
[50:52] to know brother Joe that God cannot lie
[50:54] it is not that he's mostly true or or he
[50:58] speaks truth most of the time or or even
[51:00] that we believe that he's true but it's
[51:02] actually impossible for God to lie the
[51:05] Bible says God is not a man that he
[51:07] should lie he is not a man that he
[51:09] should lie neither the son of man that
[51:11] he should repent hath he said and shall
[51:14] he not do it hath he spoken shall he not
[51:16] make it good if he said something about
[51:18] you if he's got something in his word
[51:20] that's about you he's going to make it
[51:22] good he's going to make it come to pass
[51:24] he's going to make it what it says it
[51:26] will be
[51:27] there is no word that returns to him
[51:29] void oh that ought to give us great
[51:31] comfort today and peace and knowing that
[51:33] God takes care of his word he guards his
[51:36] word he is the truth
[51:40] and it doesn't matter what I say about
[51:42] it or what somebody else says about it
[51:43] he's the truth
[51:45] he will always be true I may make a
[51:48] mistake he doesn't make any mistakes I I
[51:50] may I may fall and fail but he don't
[51:53] fall and he don't fail he is the truth
[51:56] the way the truth and the life he is the
[51:59] truth he said well how where will I find
[52:01] him how can I know where the truth is he
[52:04] came down and dwelt Among Us and he was
[52:07] the word and he is the word today so we
[52:10] can say the word is the truth
[52:13] how many believe that today
[52:16] so it's impossible for God to lie it's a
[52:20] great concept
[52:22] so now he is the truth
[52:25] his children tell the truth
[52:28] he's so much the truth that when you're
[52:31] born again you don't lie anymore
[52:34] that's what the Bible says it says lie
[52:37] not one to another seeing you have put
[52:39] off the old man with his deeds
[52:42] so you've actually when you are filled
[52:46] with the spirit of God you are actually
[52:48] so much you've been filled with the
[52:50] truth and so much so that you can't even
[52:52] lie to your brother or your sister so
[52:55] when you lie you know we weren't made to
[52:57] lie
[52:58] because we're made in the image of God
[52:59] that's why a lie detector works the way
[53:01] that it does when you lie you you're
[53:03] nervous when you lie when you're telling
[53:05] a lie there's something about your body
[53:07] that Rebels against a lie
[53:10] because the life and that's the reason
[53:12] when people go the directions that they
[53:15] go and and I have great pity for people
[53:17] today they're telling oh you can be
[53:19] whatever you want to be but if you if
[53:21] the truth is that you're a man
[53:23] then the LIE is you can be whatever you
[53:25] want to be
[53:26] but the truth is you're a man
[53:29] right and then when you lie against the
[53:31] truth it creates depression it creates
[53:34] struggle
[53:35] right and that's why so many people deal
[53:37] with with all these things and you
[53:39] wonder why is there a mental health
[53:40] crisis today why because there's lies
[53:43] against the truth
[53:46] true now now look God's creation of us
[53:50] is the truth
[53:52] and every other word is a lie
[53:55] so when we lie we break the image of
[53:58] Truth
[53:59] right
[54:01] now brother Branham talks about a lie
[54:03] detector he said it's the vibration of
[54:05] your nerves that they pick up on a lie
[54:07] detector it'll tell you he said man was
[54:09] not made to lie in his original
[54:10] beginning
[54:12] remember that
[54:14] man was not made to lie in his original
[54:16] beginning but the word says because the
[54:20] word is the truth
[54:22] are you with me now
[54:24] so now so now there's a there's a lie
[54:28] that comes on it puts you in a sort of
[54:30] bondage
[54:31] because you were made to lie now we know
[54:34] that Satan was identified as a liar in
[54:36] John 8 44 he says you're of your father
[54:38] the devil
[54:40] and the lust of your father you will do
[54:41] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[54:43] Abode not in the truth because there is
[54:46] no truth in him
[54:48] so the reason that he lied is because he
[54:51] can't do anything else
[54:53] right so how do you know the devil's
[54:55] lying the same way you know that a
[54:56] lawyer is lying no that's not exactly
[54:59] true
[55:00] when he opens his mouth
[55:03] right you know the devil's lying when he
[55:05] opens his mouth
[55:07] right but the word is always true now so
[55:11] he's a liar when he said when he speaks
[55:13] it's a lie he speaketh of his own
[55:18] I'm trying not to skip too far ahead
[55:21] here
[55:22] when the devil speaks a lie he speaks of
[55:25] his own
[55:26] so when God speaks the truth
[55:28] who's he's speaking of
[55:32] right
[55:33] so now what Satan's lie
[55:36] was in the beginning almost true
[55:39] but it was yet it had an element of
[55:41] untruth and I'm just building a
[55:43] foundation here so we can get where we
[55:45] want to go this morning
[55:47] but in Genesis 3 4 the serpent said to
[55:49] the woman you shall not surely die so it
[55:53] was the truth with an added word
[55:57] right so he added one word to God's true
[56:00] and made it alive the worst lies are
[56:02] mostly true
[56:04] because those are the ones that are
[56:06] deceptive but the brown said every lie
[56:08] has got a lot of Truth in it he said
[56:10] that's right if it's a real lie he said
[56:11] what we call a black lie or a little
[56:13] white lie I said The Little White Lies
[56:14] the real life
[56:15] he said you can see the big black lives
[56:18] but it's that little white one that
[56:19] Scott he said like the one the devil
[56:21] told Eve just one little thing off cater
[56:23] he said that's what our churches are
[56:24] listening to today now now just you know
[56:28] even in our own lives we need to be
[56:30] careful to tell the truth
[56:31] and not just a version of the truth we
[56:34] need to be truthful with each other
[56:37] even if it hurts
[56:39] even if we need to be truthful now
[56:40] there's times you don't have to say
[56:42] anything at all but don't lie
[56:44] because telling a lie even if it's
[56:46] insignificant you're sinning against the
[56:49] image of God
[56:51] you were created in the image of God
[56:53] Don't Lie
[56:54] and I'll say this don't accept lies
[56:58] don't accept lies if you know that the
[57:01] Bible says one thing and you accept
[57:03] something else because someone else said
[57:05] it then you've accepted a lie against
[57:08] the truth
[57:09] and you actually drive yourself far from
[57:12] the image of God by doing that are you
[57:16] with me so far
[57:17] so that's what the churches are
[57:19] listening to today they're saying oh
[57:20] you're right in your principle of
[57:22] baptism you're right in this you're
[57:24] right in that so they can agree on this
[57:25] that and the other he said but if he
[57:28] fails to let you know that you got to
[57:30] have love for your brother out there
[57:33] all right the devil wants to get you all
[57:35] so true
[57:36] that you have Holy Ghost meetings and
[57:38] and you have things going on and powers
[57:41] of God and things moving but all he
[57:43] wants to do is is maybe get you to not
[57:44] have the love for your brother
[57:46] breach right that's the lie in the truth
[57:48] that's just one example there's many but
[57:51] though he's right or wrong he said stand
[57:52] shoulders within the kingdom of God in
[57:54] the presence of God
[57:56] and by the way that's one of the
[57:58] evidences of Lies when someone believes
[58:01] a lie they tend to disfellowship and
[58:06] tend to separate Brotherhood over that
[58:08] life it's the first one of the first
[58:11] marks of false Doctrine they separate
[58:13] themselves from the church
[58:15] right from the body of Believers why
[58:17] they believed a lie
[58:19] and my heart goes out to them I know
[58:21] these people that believe this stuff
[58:22] against brother Branham and and they
[58:24] come up with all kinds of stuff on the
[58:26] internet and the first of all what do
[58:27] they do they separate themselves from
[58:30] the body of Believers and they don't
[58:32] discuss it with their Pastor many times
[58:33] they don't talk to somebody who would
[58:35] know about it in the church but they
[58:37] actually they'll go to the weakest
[58:39] member or somebody who's backslid or or
[58:41] somebody who used to believe it and
[58:43] they'll talk to them about it
[58:45] why because they they're separating
[58:47] themselves they're they're making
[58:48] themselves uh because they realize the
[58:51] devil's so deceptive
[58:53] he wants you to believe a lion he's
[58:55] bringing that to you and like I said I
[58:57] feel bad for them and I wouldn't say
[58:59] that a person like that necessarily is
[59:01] blasphemed although you've got to be
[59:03] careful speaking against the truth but
[59:05] Satan has deluded them and maybe they've
[59:07] been through something and they've had
[59:09] bad things happen to them but remember
[59:11] the truth will always be true
[59:13] and in your heart you know it's the
[59:15] truth that's why you fight against it
[59:17] like you do
[59:20] yes many people know this message is
[59:22] true but they but they come up against
[59:24] it not because it's not true
[59:26] but because it's hard
[59:32] but in the end it'd be easier if you
[59:33] just go with the truth
[59:35] you teach your children that don't you
[59:38] so even a white lie matters
[59:41] brother Brandon taught us I don't have
[59:43] time to bring all the quotes this
[59:44] morning but instead of you say well
[59:45] don't condemn me to tell a little white
[59:47] lie he said it's because you ain't got
[59:49] nothing to condemn
[59:51] he said that don't hurt my conscience he
[59:53] said you got no more conscience and a
[59:54] snake has hips
[59:57] that's a Kentucky way of saying it but
[1:00:00] don't bother me to tell a little white
[1:00:02] lie it ought to
[1:00:04] maybe you got so used to it you just
[1:00:05] need to come back and repent
[1:00:08] make sure what you're saying is the
[1:00:09] truth
[1:00:11] the Bible tells us finally Brethren
[1:00:13] whatsoever things are true
[1:00:15] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:00:17] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:00:19] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:00:21] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:00:22] things are of good report if there be
[1:00:24] any virtue if there be any praise think
[1:00:26] on these things
[1:00:27] because that's the truth
[1:00:30] now so we've established that God can't
[1:00:32] lie
[1:00:33] are you with me on that I know this you
[1:00:36] say well this brother really basic
[1:00:37] brother Ben but we're going somewhere
[1:00:39] God can't lie the devil can't tell the
[1:00:42] truth
[1:00:44] right there will always be a lie in it
[1:00:47] yeah if it's the devil telling it so God
[1:00:49] can't lie the devil can't tell the truth
[1:00:52] so Jesus tells the Jews when he when the
[1:00:55] Jews come to him and some of them
[1:00:56] started to believe on him and he tells
[1:00:58] them that he speaks to them about a lie
[1:01:01] how it keeps them in bondage but yet the
[1:01:03] truth would be freedom
[1:01:05] in John 8 31 then said Jesus to those
[1:01:08] Jews which believed on him if you
[1:01:10] continue in my word then are you my
[1:01:12] disciples indeed the Bible says in one
[1:01:15] place Jesus didn't associate with
[1:01:16] everybody that believed on him because
[1:01:19] he knew their hearts
[1:01:21] he knew who they were he knew whether
[1:01:23] they were the elected of God or not
[1:01:25] so he knew that many of them would not
[1:01:27] continue
[1:01:28] so now he goes on he says and you shall
[1:01:30] know the truth
[1:01:32] and the truth shall make you free
[1:01:36] so he identifies a lie as bondage
[1:01:40] right and the truth shall make you free
[1:01:43] you remember we watched you're no longer
[1:01:45] deep close to the deep but there's
[1:01:46] another 20th century Prophet if you've
[1:01:48] ever seen that video I'm sure most of
[1:01:50] you have but Branham speaks to a woman
[1:01:52] on that video who has been told a lie
[1:01:55] how many have seen that
[1:01:57] go and watch it 20th century Prophet
[1:01:59] it's on YouTube it's on the voice of God
[1:02:01] website or other websites you can go to
[1:02:03] 20th century prophet and and if you go
[1:02:06] there and you begin to watch that you
[1:02:08] see this woman has been lied to and they
[1:02:10] told her she was a witch
[1:02:12] now she should have known if she was a
[1:02:13] witch
[1:02:15] but they made her believe that she was a
[1:02:17] witch
[1:02:18] right because it was people she
[1:02:20] respected
[1:02:22] God help us today we need to be careful
[1:02:25] what we tell people
[1:02:26] right because people she respected
[1:02:29] brother Justin told her a lie
[1:02:31] about herself
[1:02:34] some of you are struggling today
[1:02:37] because people you respected maybe a
[1:02:39] parent maybe an aunt or an uncle maybe a
[1:02:41] pastor somebody told you a lie
[1:02:44] and you're still believing that even
[1:02:47] though you know it's not true
[1:02:49] I told you you'd never make it they told
[1:02:52] you you weren't good enough they told
[1:02:54] you there's too much going on in your
[1:02:55] life for you to make it and because of
[1:02:57] that lie it affects you brings a cloud
[1:02:59] of you but you remember what happened to
[1:03:00] the woman when a prophet came and
[1:03:02] revealed the secret of the heart the
[1:03:04] word amen the word revealed the truth
[1:03:07] and the lie was a bondage but the truth
[1:03:10] was delivered
[1:03:13] amen all week long you hear the lies all
[1:03:16] week long you hear you're not good
[1:03:17] enough all week long the devil speaks to
[1:03:19] you and tells you that you're not going
[1:03:21] to make it but on Sunday and on
[1:03:22] Wednesday and every time you turn on a
[1:03:24] tape listen to it
[1:03:27] all right
[1:03:29] now he said the truth will make you free
[1:03:31] you'll know the truth the truth will
[1:03:32] make you free and they didn't like it
[1:03:33] they took umbrage to that
[1:03:36] they said
[1:03:37] well we've never been in bondage to any
[1:03:39] man
[1:03:40] how say it so you should be made free
[1:03:43] we're free men they were proud of that
[1:03:45] fact
[1:03:46] they were not slaves
[1:03:48] today we might say we're message
[1:03:50] believers
[1:03:51] we have a prophet
[1:03:54] I was raised in church I'm a Christ
[1:03:56] follower you might say I'm a Believer
[1:03:59] but the truth will make you free
[1:04:03] it's one thing to say I'm a Believer but
[1:04:05] brother Brown tells us in the token
[1:04:06] that's not enough
[1:04:10] not enough just to go to church it's not
[1:04:13] enough though that's what you're
[1:04:14] supposed to do but that's not enough but
[1:04:15] you've got to be you've got to have
[1:04:17] Christ Within You by the power of the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost listen you know the truth
[1:04:23] the truth makes you free
[1:04:26] whenever you find yourself doing
[1:04:29] something because somebody else teaches
[1:04:31] it and you know it's not true
[1:04:34] they can't back it up with the word but
[1:04:36] you're in a system
[1:04:37] what you are is you're under the LIE
[1:04:40] no matter how many good people are in
[1:04:41] the system no matter how much they they
[1:04:44] might preach and they might they might
[1:04:45] be eloquent or they might have signs and
[1:04:47] wonders and gifts but yet if you're
[1:04:49] under that system that keeps you from
[1:04:51] holy following the word you're believing
[1:04:53] the LIE
[1:04:55] are you with me so far this morning
[1:04:59] now they didn't like that so how are you
[1:05:01] saying we'll be made free we're
[1:05:02] believers
[1:05:04] and Jesus answered them verily verily I
[1:05:06] say unto you whosoever commit a sin is
[1:05:08] the servant of sin
[1:05:10] the servant abide is not in the house
[1:05:12] forever but the son abide is forever
[1:05:14] if the son therefore
[1:05:17] shall make you free
[1:05:18] you should be free indeed so he said
[1:05:20] truth is not what you believe about
[1:05:22] yourself
[1:05:23] truth is not a group that you identify
[1:05:25] with truth is not I go to brother Ben's
[1:05:27] Church
[1:05:28] are you with me this morning but the
[1:05:30] truth will make you free truth is a
[1:05:32] person
[1:05:34] the truth is Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:38] so the lie that binds is the same lie
[1:05:42] that was told at the beginning we know
[1:05:44] brother Brown calls it the life in
[1:05:46] second Thessalonians 2 7 it talks about
[1:05:48] the uh one that's coming the Antichrist
[1:05:51] system that's coming he said for the
[1:05:53] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[1:05:54] only he who now letteth will let until
[1:05:56] he be taken out of the way and then
[1:05:58] shall that Wicked be revealed whom the
[1:06:00] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[1:06:01] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:06:03] brightness of his coming even him who's
[1:06:06] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:06:07] with all power and signs and lying
[1:06:09] wonders with all deceivableness of
[1:06:12] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:06:13] because they receive not
[1:06:16] what
[1:06:17] the love of the truth
[1:06:20] they receive not the love of the truth
[1:06:22] they lost their first love
[1:06:24] and that was the what the Ephesian
[1:06:25] Church did but the Rams said they lost
[1:06:27] their love for gospel meetings
[1:06:29] they received not the love of the truth
[1:06:31] that they might be saved
[1:06:33] so truth must be loved
[1:06:36] or it will be rejected in favor of a lie
[1:06:39] and brother Brown teaches us you must
[1:06:40] reject truth to believe a lie
[1:06:44] so
[1:06:45] so the devil is a liar God is the truth
[1:06:48] you got to tell the truth if you're
[1:06:50] children of God children of God tell the
[1:06:52] truth Children of the devil live a lie
[1:06:55] right truth must be loved or it will be
[1:06:58] rejected in favor of a lie
[1:07:00] so you've got to reject truth to believe
[1:07:02] a lie
[1:07:03] and you reject the lie to believe the
[1:07:05] truth
[1:07:06] second Thessalonians 2 11 for this cause
[1:07:08] God shall send them strong delusion that
[1:07:10] they should believe a lie but the Brown
[1:07:11] says in the original that's the LIE
[1:07:14] he said that they all might be damned
[1:07:16] who believe not the truth bad pleasure
[1:07:18] in the righteousness he said it should
[1:07:19] be translated the lie not Eli the same
[1:07:22] one he told Eve
[1:07:23] he said the lie that Satan told Eve was
[1:07:26] 90 truth and the lie that you can tell
[1:07:29] he said how I've heard men bypass pieces
[1:07:32] in the scripture
[1:07:34] just to keep from it hurts their
[1:07:36] theology
[1:07:37] but if this part's right that part's
[1:07:41] right
[1:07:43] let's put it together make it fit
[1:07:45] through the whole Bible
[1:07:47] so again he says that's the way that the
[1:07:49] unbeliever the unidentified person with
[1:07:51] God he'll say oh I believe Jesus Christ
[1:07:54] is the Son of God I believe God is the
[1:07:56] father of Jesus Christ I believe these
[1:07:57] other things but when it comes down to
[1:07:59] this other part oh that's for another
[1:08:01] day see there's the LIE of it that's
[1:08:04] right he's trying to twist a little of
[1:08:06] the right word around to make it
[1:08:08] deceiving for the people
[1:08:10] but what Jesus made the thing clear he
[1:08:13] said these signs shall confirm the
[1:08:15] message that I have sent
[1:08:16] it not for another day now when Adam and
[1:08:19] Eve again he said that when Adam and Eve
[1:08:21] listen to the LIE of the devil the holy
[1:08:23] image of God left them
[1:08:25] the holy image of God left them you know
[1:08:28] what happened when the Holy image of God
[1:08:30] left them
[1:08:31] they didn't want to be in church no more
[1:08:36] that's what happened when people start
[1:08:38] to believe a lie they start hanging out
[1:08:40] away from believers
[1:08:43] it's just the truth now the holy image
[1:08:45] of God left them they were more
[1:08:46] comfortable with other with unbelievers
[1:08:49] maybe if you could say it that way than
[1:08:51] believers
[1:08:52] their fellowship with God was broken
[1:08:54] where he used to come down in the cool
[1:08:56] of the evening and and be their God and
[1:08:59] talk to them and have a little church
[1:09:00] service they're in the trees
[1:09:03] and now their Fellowship of Oneness was
[1:09:05] broken
[1:09:06] brother brother said their Fellowship
[1:09:08] was broken with God their Fellowship of
[1:09:09] Oneness with God was broken the very
[1:09:11] minute they listened to the LIE of the
[1:09:12] devil that broke their fellowship and
[1:09:14] the very minute that you listened to the
[1:09:16] LIE of the devil it'll break your
[1:09:18] fellowship that's the very minute that
[1:09:20] you go out from the presence of God like
[1:09:21] she did it's when you failed to take
[1:09:23] God's word just as it is
[1:09:25] so now look I want to ask you something
[1:09:27] we all know there's a God and if God is
[1:09:29] so correct with his word and so
[1:09:31] determined he'll judge the people by his
[1:09:33] word then he's got to preserve a word
[1:09:35] somewhere to judge the people by God
[1:09:38] didn't just write the word he preserves
[1:09:40] the word
[1:09:42] so that even a fool would marry therein
[1:09:45] hey man he preserved the word to judge
[1:09:48] people by the by this Bible is it
[1:09:52] he said don't you forget that it's the
[1:09:54] Bible that God will judge the people by
[1:09:56] verse said in revelation 22 he either
[1:09:58] will take one word away from it or add
[1:10:00] one word to it see not just say well I
[1:10:02] go to church I believe I believe God why
[1:10:03] every devil in hell believes him every
[1:10:06] one of them is religious everyone but it
[1:10:08] just takes one word that breaks the
[1:10:09] fellowship right there a chain that's no
[1:10:11] stronger than its weakest link and where
[1:10:13] your weakness is on disbelieving God's
[1:10:15] word now listen this will help you he
[1:10:17] said there's where you want to put a new
[1:10:19] link yeah strong with the rest of it so
[1:10:22] if there's a link that's that's weak and
[1:10:25] that link maybe is what your parents
[1:10:26] told you yeah
[1:10:28] or what's your what's your old what
[1:10:30] somebody else told you an old system a
[1:10:32] denominational system you need to take
[1:10:34] that link yeah
[1:10:38] throw it away
[1:10:40] and replace that leak with the truth God
[1:10:44] loves me that thought that tells you the
[1:10:47] pastor don't love you the people don't
[1:10:48] love you take that link and throw it
[1:10:50] away
[1:10:51] that leak is weak because it's not right
[1:10:53] with the word take that leak and replace
[1:10:55] it with I know I'm a Child of God
[1:10:58] I know I'm one of Gods
[1:11:00] put that link back in the chain
[1:11:03] why because that chain is is what's
[1:11:06] holding you
[1:11:07] oh my I'm so glad for God's word
[1:11:10] it holds us where we ought to be
[1:11:13] or we don't go where the unbeliever goes
[1:11:16] now look
[1:11:18] he said if you believe Jesus Christ
[1:11:19] saves then you must put a link in there
[1:11:21] that believes he heals
[1:11:24] right you're strong in Salvation
[1:11:27] but you're weak in healing
[1:11:29] it's the same atonement
[1:11:32] right but Timothy you believe for your
[1:11:35] salvation
[1:11:36] then that chain also has healing in it
[1:11:39] but if there is if there's a weak link
[1:11:40] there and healing belief for your
[1:11:42] healing
[1:11:43] right replace that chain replace that
[1:11:45] link
[1:11:46] if you believe he was
[1:11:48] you must believe he is
[1:11:51] amen you got a strong faith to believe
[1:11:53] he was he was the god that walked in
[1:11:56] flesh he was the god that was with
[1:11:58] brother random but do you believe he is
[1:12:01] right you've got to have uh that that
[1:12:04] chain is only as strong as this week
[1:12:06] it's like he's the same yesterday today
[1:12:08] and forever
[1:12:09] if you believe he was and wondering
[1:12:12] whether he is that leak will break
[1:12:15] and then you're lost
[1:12:18] so we know we must know the truth
[1:12:21] to be free
[1:12:23] and
[1:12:25] we must know the truth in other words
[1:12:27] know what the truth is
[1:12:29] but to be able to distinguish the truth
[1:12:31] from the LIE
[1:12:33] and I would say this this morning I
[1:12:36] almost hesitate to ask this because you
[1:12:38] don't want people to start questioning
[1:12:39] but I don't want to minister questions
[1:12:40] to you but just to make a point of where
[1:12:42] I'm going how do you know that I'm
[1:12:44] telling you the truth
[1:12:48] right there's got to be some way
[1:12:50] how do you know that I'm telling you the
[1:12:52] truth the Bible says you shall know the
[1:12:54] truth
[1:12:55] and the truth shall make you free
[1:12:59] so he didn't say you'll guess at it
[1:13:03] you wouldn't say you you'll go with it
[1:13:05] because brother Ben said sober the Ben's
[1:13:07] my brother my my uncle my my grandpa I
[1:13:09] hope there's no grandchildren
[1:13:12] that's what I feel like anymore
[1:13:15] but whatever brother Ben is to you or
[1:13:17] brother Ben believes it must be right
[1:13:20] you don't know it's the truth you think
[1:13:21] it's the truth
[1:13:24] all right well the church teacher said I
[1:13:26] went to church there for 30 years they
[1:13:28] teach it
[1:13:29] that mean it's the truth how do you know
[1:13:31] the truth
[1:13:33] you know the truth it's the word
[1:13:36] you won't guess at it but you know the
[1:13:38] truth but what how does the word come to
[1:13:40] you how does it come to you see you can
[1:13:43] even read the scripture and not know the
[1:13:45] truth
[1:13:46] you can listen to tapes and not know the
[1:13:48] truth you can hear me preach and not
[1:13:50] know the truth
[1:13:52] right right now how is that because the
[1:13:54] word has to come by spiritual revelation
[1:13:57] right
[1:13:58] Sunday school class participation this
[1:14:01] morning
[1:14:02] how do you know the truth about
[1:14:04] spiritual Revelation how did Peter know
[1:14:06] who Jesus was
[1:14:08] only one way he could know Jesus
[1:14:11] answered and said to him blessed art
[1:14:12] thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[1:14:14] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:14:16] Father which is in heaven
[1:14:19] Hallelujah but the prayer says the whole
[1:14:21] Bible is the revelation of God the whole
[1:14:24] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:14:26] God there is no other way to know God
[1:14:29] Only by Revelation to whom the son will
[1:14:32] reveal him Revelation everything is
[1:14:34] revelation he said so not to accept the
[1:14:36] Revelation he said to to not accept the
[1:14:38] Revelation then you're just a cold
[1:14:40] theologian
[1:14:42] and there is no hope for you that's a
[1:14:44] strong statement
[1:14:46] you've got to accept revelation
[1:14:48] and so it's the Holy Ghost
[1:14:50] so we got to get people the Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] don't we we need our children to receive
[1:14:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want
[1:14:56] the Holy Ghost to be present in our
[1:14:57] services because it's the holy ghost
[1:14:59] that teaches the truth
[1:15:02] the letter kills but the spirit gives
[1:15:03] life the Holy Ghost will lead you as an
[1:15:05] individual to the person of Christ the
[1:15:07] truth John 14 and 17 even the spirit of
[1:15:09] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:15:11] because it sees him not neither knoweth
[1:15:14] him but you know him how do you know the
[1:15:16] spirit of Truth he dwelleth with you and
[1:15:18] shall be in you
[1:15:19] but when the comforter has come down 15
[1:15:21] 26 whom I was sending you from the
[1:15:23] father even the spirit of Truth which
[1:15:25] proceedeth from the father he will
[1:15:27] testify of Me John 16-13 how be it when
[1:15:31] he the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:15:33] guide you into how much all truth
[1:15:36] amen he will guide you into all Truth
[1:15:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:15:41] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:15:43] speak and he will show you things to
[1:15:45] come you don't know that I'm telling you
[1:15:46] the truth unless you have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:50] you may believe that I am you may think
[1:15:52] that I am but it's got to be by the Holy
[1:15:54] Ghost
[1:15:55] to give you confidence in the word
[1:15:58] because otherwise you say well I I'll
[1:15:59] take the Bible and I'll prove whether
[1:16:00] you tell me the truth or not well it
[1:16:02] depends on how you believe the Bible
[1:16:05] you believe what a prophet said or do
[1:16:07] you believe what the Baptist said or the
[1:16:08] Methodist or whatever and again I'm not
[1:16:10] condemning those things it's just you've
[1:16:12] got to believe something
[1:16:14] what are you going to believe
[1:16:16] God you got to believe the truth
[1:16:18] so you need the Holy Ghost to reveal
[1:16:20] truth to you
[1:16:22] oh my
[1:16:23] God oh my now now God does use men
[1:16:27] but the Holy Ghost is the teacher of
[1:16:28] Truth
[1:16:30] the man is God's microphone
[1:16:34] that God uses to teach the truth
[1:16:37] but it's the Holy Ghost itself
[1:16:40] that makes the truth real to the person
[1:16:42] you understand which makes every
[1:16:44] individual continued with us but they
[1:16:47] went out that they might be made
[1:16:48] manifest that they were not all of us
[1:16:50] but gee
[1:16:52] have an unction that word is anointing
[1:16:55] you have an anointing from the Holy One
[1:16:58] and you know all things
[1:17:01] you he's writing to a bunch of holy
[1:17:05] ghost-filled people and he said you know
[1:17:07] all things
[1:17:09] so it was necessary for John to write
[1:17:12] but he's saying the spirit is telling
[1:17:14] you this is the truth
[1:17:16] oh we've got to have that church
[1:17:19] you have an unction for the Holy One and
[1:17:21] you know all things
[1:17:23] he said I have not written unto you
[1:17:25] because you know not the truth but
[1:17:27] because you know it
[1:17:29] so the scripture was not written for the
[1:17:31] one that didn't know the truth but for
[1:17:33] the one who knew it
[1:17:34] oh my and that no lie is of the truth
[1:17:38] oh my who is a liar but he that denieth
[1:17:41] that Jesus is the Christ
[1:17:43] right this whole this whole belief
[1:17:44] system is built on a lie
[1:17:46] he is Antichrist that denies the father
[1:17:48] and the son there were some in that day
[1:17:50] that were saying that the sun didn't
[1:17:51] actually exist that it was just a
[1:17:53] spiritual thing
[1:17:54] so the the gnostics of that day he said
[1:17:57] that's an antichrist it denies the
[1:17:58] father and the son whosoever denyth the
[1:18:00] son the same hath not the father but he
[1:18:03] that acknowledges the son hath the
[1:18:04] father also
[1:18:05] verse 24 let that therefore abide in you
[1:18:08] now watch let that therefore abide in
[1:18:12] you which you have heard from the
[1:18:14] beginning
[1:18:15] because everything God ever said
[1:18:18] won't change
[1:18:22] I just wish we could
[1:18:24] we could just dwell on that
[1:18:26] we could think about that for a minute
[1:18:28] everything God ever said won't change
[1:18:33] he can't he can't do that and be God
[1:18:36] right what you've heard from the
[1:18:38] beginning let it abide in you so when
[1:18:41] you have from the beginning something it
[1:18:43] continues and it continues and it
[1:18:44] continues it's the truth it's the truth
[1:18:46] and one day well it's not true
[1:18:48] what's happening you're listening to a
[1:18:50] lie
[1:18:52] because the truth will always be true if
[1:18:54] it's a lie now it was a lie to begin
[1:18:56] with
[1:18:57] so don't let Satan try to shake your
[1:18:58] faith what you've heard from the
[1:19:00] beginning if that he said if that which
[1:19:02] you have heard from the beginning shall
[1:19:04] remain in you you shall also continue in
[1:19:06] the Son and the father
[1:19:07] and this is the promise that he hath
[1:19:09] promised us even eternal life
[1:19:12] he said these things have I written unto
[1:19:14] you concerning them that seduce you he
[1:19:16] said brother Ben I'm scared I'm scared
[1:19:17] I'm going to be I'm going to be deceived
[1:19:19] but he told us that the bride would not
[1:19:21] be deceived
[1:19:22] why because you have the truth
[1:19:24] can I go a little bit farther your flesh
[1:19:27] of his flesh bone of his bones power of
[1:19:29] his power what does that mean you are
[1:19:30] the truth
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:35] we need to get away from this fear and
[1:19:37] scare the brother Bradham talked about
[1:19:38] the constant beating people over the
[1:19:41] head well you may not make it you may
[1:19:42] not make it every day they're on pins
[1:19:44] and needles wondering if they're going
[1:19:45] to make it that's not what this message
[1:19:47] was built on this message is built on
[1:19:49] insurance it's built on faith we have
[1:19:51] the Holy Ghost of Bible said with much
[1:19:52] assurance
[1:19:54] we know whom in whom we have believed
[1:19:56] Paul said I know in whom I believe they
[1:19:58] may put me in jail but I know whom I
[1:20:00] have believed it they may put me in
[1:20:02] prison they may drop my head off but I
[1:20:04] know in whom I have believed it and I'm
[1:20:05] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[1:20:07] which I've committed unto him against
[1:20:09] that day I'm persuaded of it I know it I
[1:20:13] know the truth
[1:20:14] not to constantly worry about well oh my
[1:20:17] if I listen to anybody else I'm going to
[1:20:19] be deceived
[1:20:20] no you'll know what to reject
[1:20:24] yeah why because the Holy Spirit
[1:20:26] is in you but the holy spirit's not in
[1:20:28] you then you have to worry
[1:20:32] now watch
[1:20:33] it's about the anointing which you have
[1:20:35] received of him abideth in you
[1:20:37] and you need not that any man teach you
[1:20:40] but as the same anointing teaches you of
[1:20:42] all things in his truth and it is no lie
[1:20:45] and even as it has taught you even as it
[1:20:48] hath past tense taught you
[1:20:51] you shall abide in him
[1:20:54] so the truth says you know this is the
[1:20:57] way a woman should act and this is the
[1:20:59] way a man should act this is I mean this
[1:21:01] day this is this should be a man
[1:21:03] this should be a woman
[1:21:05] but the LIE says you can be whatever you
[1:21:07] want to be
[1:21:09] right that's an extreme virtual it's not
[1:21:11] so extreme today
[1:21:13] our kids deal with that
[1:21:17] somebody's got to deal with it from the
[1:21:18] pulpit
[1:21:22] they deal with that it's the LIE
[1:21:25] the same lie that Satan told Eve
[1:21:27] it's a lie
[1:21:29] they try to tell them well you you can
[1:21:31] you can you can be whatever you want to
[1:21:32] be and you can
[1:21:33] this this but this anointing teaches you
[1:21:35] all things so if you get the Holy Ghost
[1:21:37] you'll know that's a lie
[1:21:39] right that's a lie I believe though
[1:21:42] God's word is true
[1:21:43] we can take that in many other areas of
[1:21:45] our life now
[1:21:46] many people have said
[1:21:48] well since Jesus is the truth
[1:21:51] I will only follow those things written
[1:21:53] in red have you ever heard you ever met
[1:21:54] anybody that said that
[1:21:56] I only believe what's written in red
[1:21:58] well they're still deceived
[1:22:03] because that's not what the truth said
[1:22:07] the truth said written in red if you
[1:22:10] believe Moses you believe me
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] so the truth testified that the entire
[1:22:18] Bible is the truth
[1:22:20] all right so they're still deceived
[1:22:22] others will say well to in order to make
[1:22:25] sure that I'm only hearing the truth
[1:22:27] I'll only hear a certain preacher I only
[1:22:29] hear my pastor but they're still
[1:22:31] deceived
[1:22:32] because the Bible says that to edify the
[1:22:35] church he'd send five different gifts
[1:22:38] right Pastor Apostle Prophet Pastor
[1:22:41] evangelist teacher
[1:22:42] right that's what the Bible says
[1:22:45] but this will only hear a certain one
[1:22:46] but they're still deceived others will
[1:22:48] say I will only hear a prophet still
[1:22:50] deceived because that's not what the
[1:22:52] truth said
[1:22:54] right it's not the truth we heard from
[1:22:56] the beginning
[1:22:57] Paul says it this way he said the things
[1:22:59] that thou has heard of me among many
[1:23:01] witnesses the same commit doubt of
[1:23:03] Faithful Men Who should be able to teach
[1:23:05] others also because the Brown says this
[1:23:07] he said you must come under teaching you
[1:23:09] must come under teaching you say I don't
[1:23:11] need no one to teach me after the Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost has come my friends he said that
[1:23:14] just gives me a little room to doubt
[1:23:15] whether you've really got it or not
[1:23:17] come on he said the way you're acting
[1:23:18] with it see the thing you're doing he
[1:23:19] said no if the Bible says the holy
[1:23:21] spirit is the teacher why does the Holy
[1:23:22] Spirit put teachers in the church then
[1:23:24] to set the church in order the same Holy
[1:23:26] Spirit he said we don't need any
[1:23:27] seminaries to go around big bunch of men
[1:23:29] to look out these things the holy spirit
[1:23:31] is a teacher
[1:23:32] see it's a teacher and it gives some
[1:23:34] fellow a gift to teaching and then you
[1:23:36] must be subject to that gift but how do
[1:23:37] you know he's telling you the truth by
[1:23:38] the same Holy Ghost
[1:23:40] by the same Holy Ghost the preacher is
[1:23:42] preaching with us the same way you know
[1:23:43] it's the truth
[1:23:49] Philip when he goes down and I won't get
[1:23:52] into this this morning but he goes down
[1:23:53] to the eunuch you know the story
[1:23:55] and he said do you understand what
[1:23:56] you're reading unit says how can I
[1:23:58] unless some men some men guide me
[1:24:01] right but when the unit caught the
[1:24:02] revelation
[1:24:04] he needed a revelation so how now he had
[1:24:07] the scriptures and then he had the
[1:24:08] teaching of Philip the evangelist
[1:24:10] who is not even a prophet but he was an
[1:24:13] evangelist but he come to him and he
[1:24:15] taught him those things and then once he
[1:24:16] taught him he still needed Revelation
[1:24:18] but when the Revelation struck his heart
[1:24:20] he said here is water
[1:24:22] and when the Revelation strikes your
[1:24:23] heart you'll run quickly to water
[1:24:25] baptism
[1:24:26] in Jesus name why because not because I
[1:24:28] told you so
[1:24:30] but because the Revelation struck your
[1:24:31] heart
[1:24:33] you have the anointing now
[1:24:35] you can sit
[1:24:36] this is going to get hard
[1:24:39] but then it gets better are you still
[1:24:41] with me this morning
[1:24:45] you could sit under perfect
[1:24:48] and be lost
[1:24:49] what's that brother Ben how do you know
[1:24:51] that Judas did
[1:24:56] the devil had access to his mind
[1:24:58] you say I'm only going to hear Jesus
[1:24:59] Judas only heard Jesus for three and a
[1:25:02] half years
[1:25:04] that was his teacher his Prophet his his
[1:25:06] mentor his God or so he professed with
[1:25:09] the others
[1:25:11] right
[1:25:13] but he did he didn't put into action
[1:25:16] what he heard
[1:25:18] brother said he can do everything else
[1:25:19] but he couldn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:25:22] right and but what what does the devil
[1:25:24] still have access to In Spite of perfect
[1:25:26] teaching your mind
[1:25:30] you don't believe the devil's floating
[1:25:31] around out here
[1:25:32] so I'm not gonna let any man Teach me
[1:25:34] the devil loves that
[1:25:37] right
[1:25:38] because what is he going to do he's
[1:25:40] going to come in and start talking to
[1:25:42] you himself he does that that's what he
[1:25:44] does he'd been talking to all of us
[1:25:47] since we were born almost since we're
[1:25:49] old enough to understand he comes in
[1:25:51] he's the most faithful member of the
[1:25:53] church
[1:25:54] right he comes everywhere there's people
[1:25:55] he comes with you at your house he tells
[1:25:57] you you're not worthy he tells you
[1:25:59] you're not good enough he tells you
[1:26:00] you're not going to make it he tells you
[1:26:02] that the blood is not sufficient he
[1:26:04] tells you that you're not going to be
[1:26:05] healed why does he talks to you all the
[1:26:06] time doesn't he you need to hear another
[1:26:08] voice speaking to you you need to sit
[1:26:10] under teaching come under teaching and
[1:26:12] hear a voice telling you are going to
[1:26:14] make it you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:15] Christ
[1:26:17] because the devil sitting on his
[1:26:18] shoulder all the time telling you you're
[1:26:19] not
[1:26:20] so well I'll only read my Bible because
[1:26:22] that'll make me where I can where I can
[1:26:24] only hear the truth and the devil will
[1:26:26] take it and pervert it to you
[1:26:31] what did the Bible say the Bible says
[1:26:33] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:26:35] put into the heart yeah
[1:26:37] of Judas Iscariot to betray him
[1:26:41] see your mind's accept accessible the
[1:26:43] Enemy No matter how perfect the truth is
[1:26:45] that you're hearing because the mind is
[1:26:47] no man's land but the brown said the
[1:26:48] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:26:49] the battle you know where the term no
[1:26:51] man's land come from that was from the
[1:26:52] first world war when they would have
[1:26:54] entrench Warfare and the technology had
[1:26:57] gone faster than the tactics did
[1:26:59] and the technology was such that they
[1:27:01] could mow down men with machine guns and
[1:27:03] they were still charging with just men
[1:27:04] running across no man's land and so they
[1:27:06] stayed there for years
[1:27:08] and in between was no man saying where
[1:27:09] the mustard gas had killed everything it
[1:27:12] was just just holes and and everything
[1:27:14] else brother Brown said that was the
[1:27:15] mind
[1:27:17] right that's the Battleground
[1:27:20] and the thing is it's going to happen
[1:27:22] you can't keep that from happening you
[1:27:24] can't keep them from coming in but you
[1:27:25] can shoot him out
[1:27:27] you got a contest to No Man's Land
[1:27:29] because if you don't Contest no man said
[1:27:31] he'll come in your territory he'll make
[1:27:33] you believe you're not even a Christian
[1:27:34] you've got to contest that thought when
[1:27:37] it comes up against you the Bible says
[1:27:38] cast it down
[1:27:40] every stronghold every idea that exalts
[1:27:43] itself against the knowledge of Christ
[1:27:45] against the truth
[1:27:46] so there's a Battleground going on and
[1:27:49] many times we are in bondage because of
[1:27:52] misunderstandings
[1:27:55] in that Battleground
[1:27:58] now
[1:27:59] brother Branham had a dream you remember
[1:28:01] the dream brother Brandon had a dream
[1:28:02] and it was a dream about about some
[1:28:04] people that were bound
[1:28:06] and they said this is the house of hell
[1:28:09] remember that woman that he knew come up
[1:28:11] to him and she said Deliver Us from this
[1:28:13] place
[1:28:14] delivereth from this house of hell
[1:28:16] delivers from this place
[1:28:19] and she said this is a house of hell but
[1:28:21] when they come to him and she come to
[1:28:22] him she said something interesting and I
[1:28:25] was talking about this the other day
[1:28:26] with a with another Minister and he
[1:28:28] brought this to my attention and it just
[1:28:29] kind of fit with what I was studying but
[1:28:31] look at this it says you you've been
[1:28:33] misunderstood
[1:28:36] you've been misunderstood
[1:28:38] now watch you've been misunderstood
[1:28:42] and you misunderstood these people too
[1:28:44] yeah and we know brother Ben told us
[1:28:47] when he misunderstood the people was
[1:28:49] when he called him Ricky's and rickettos
[1:28:50] the Holy Spirit told him not to do that
[1:28:52] he said their children they may be
[1:28:54] children of God Bound in those
[1:28:56] denominational houses of hell
[1:28:59] yeah all right they might be bound in
[1:29:00] that but they're children of God still
[1:29:03] right and so you don't mistreat them you
[1:29:06] don't you don't say that about them
[1:29:07] because it may be a child of God so but
[1:29:09] how did the people misunderstand brother
[1:29:10] Branham
[1:29:12] now think about it
[1:29:14] however it was maybe they
[1:29:17] you know how people usually
[1:29:18] misunderstand they misunderstand like
[1:29:19] like John did when he got himself put in
[1:29:23] prison
[1:29:25] and he found himself in prison
[1:29:27] I believe brother Andrew preached that
[1:29:28] here or maybe somewhere else that I
[1:29:30] heard him preach that bill Andrew Glover
[1:29:32] preached that John in prison
[1:29:33] misunderstood Jesus
[1:29:36] he said are you the one are you looking
[1:29:37] for another should we look for another
[1:29:40] he misunderstood because Jesus didn't
[1:29:42] meet his expectations
[1:29:45] how many of us have misunderstood the
[1:29:47] message because it didn't meet our
[1:29:48] expectations
[1:29:50] because we had a preconceived idea what
[1:29:52] the message was and what it ought to be
[1:29:54] many times people misunderstand the
[1:29:57] message because people because preachers
[1:29:59] yeah
[1:30:00] people misunderstand brother Branham
[1:30:02] because preachers
[1:30:04] have misled them
[1:30:06] right people misunderstand the message
[1:30:09] because preachers people misunderstand
[1:30:11] the message because people don't live
[1:30:12] right
[1:30:15] oh God but see they got their eyes on
[1:30:18] the wrong thing
[1:30:20] you can't get your eyes that's the LIE
[1:30:23] get your eyes on the truth
[1:30:25] if you don't get your eyes on the truth
[1:30:26] you'll stay bound
[1:30:28] you'll stay in that house of Hell you'll
[1:30:30] stay behind those bars they were Bound
[1:30:32] by misunderstanding but they were
[1:30:34] delivered by the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:30:36] said how will I deliver these people I
[1:30:37] haven't got enough strength in my arms
[1:30:39] to break those bars so I said House of
[1:30:41] Hell give way to the name of Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ and all the creaking and popping
[1:30:45] and rocks rolling and bars falling and
[1:30:47] people running sound like a Pentecostal
[1:30:49] meeting doesn't it screaming delivered
[1:30:50] and they're screaming at the top of
[1:30:52] their voice was all delivered why
[1:30:53] because of prophet of God said the truth
[1:30:57] spoke the truth what was it the truth is
[1:30:59] not a Doctrine the truth is a person the
[1:31:02] name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:04] so a misunderstanding put on Behind Bars
[1:31:08] but truth delivered them
[1:31:11] yes God
[1:31:12] now remember I said the enemy has a
[1:31:13] right to your mind but remember this the
[1:31:15] elect cannot be deceived
[1:31:18] brother said to believe the devil's lies
[1:31:20] to serve Satan even though you want to
[1:31:21] may want to call him Jehovah but the
[1:31:24] elect will not
[1:31:26] that's why I don't have to disfellowship
[1:31:28] you because you're a little bit
[1:31:29] different than me and always fighting
[1:31:31] fuss with somebody why would I do that
[1:31:34] the elect will not
[1:31:36] be deceived
[1:31:38] if I treat people right and believe the
[1:31:40] truth and preach the truth it'll come
[1:31:42] out all right
[1:31:44] the elect will not be deceived I don't
[1:31:46] have to control you to make you not
[1:31:48] deceived
[1:31:52] I hope you hear me today
[1:31:55] the truth is still the truth
[1:31:58] you may have been taught all your life
[1:31:59] that you had to hear a certain preacher
[1:32:01] or send under a certain Pastor in order
[1:32:03] to make it but I'm here to tell you
[1:32:05] today you know the truth
[1:32:07] and the truth will set you free
[1:32:10] I don't have to control you I don't have
[1:32:12] to make you my servants because then you
[1:32:14] just become the servants to a man I
[1:32:16] don't have to control your behavior I
[1:32:18] don't have to tell you what time to pray
[1:32:19] or what time to listen to The Prophet or
[1:32:21] what time to do anything else I don't
[1:32:23] have to do that why don't I have to do
[1:32:25] that you have the Holy Ghost you have
[1:32:28] the anointing and the truth will set you
[1:32:30] free you are not in the denominational
[1:32:32] system anymore why would we go back to
[1:32:34] that
[1:32:38] furthermore the elect will not only be
[1:32:40] kept
[1:32:41] I love that
[1:32:42] the elect will not only be kept but as
[1:32:45] this move becomes the image director to
[1:32:47] the Beast the Saints will be gone in the
[1:32:49] Rapture aren't you glad for that this
[1:32:50] morning
[1:32:51] brother tells this little Eagle story
[1:32:54] he says that after you recognize the
[1:32:56] very word of God was Eagle food
[1:32:58] you said you left the other thing
[1:33:02] watch you left the other thing
[1:33:04] now watch you remember the eagle story
[1:33:06] The the farmer had put an eagle egg
[1:33:09] under the hen but the mother Eagle knew
[1:33:11] she had more than one egg
[1:33:13] right and so she goes down looking for
[1:33:15] it when she goes looking for it then one
[1:33:18] day one day the little Eagle hears
[1:33:20] something that that he he's never heard
[1:33:22] with his ears
[1:33:24] but it it makes sense to him
[1:33:27] it's him
[1:33:29] in mature form
[1:33:32] right he is it's like that's it's me
[1:33:34] Mama it's me like a little boy looking
[1:33:36] in the mirror and so now he he
[1:33:39] recognizes the Cry of the eagle but the
[1:33:41] brother said after you recognize the
[1:33:42] very word of God with evil food you left
[1:33:44] the other thing you have been informed
[1:33:46] into the living image of the Living God
[1:33:48] now listen to me you heard from your
[1:33:52] theophany
[1:33:55] huh
[1:33:57] you heard from your theophany if this
[1:34:01] Earthly body be dissolved we have one
[1:34:04] waiting
[1:34:05] now a theophany is a word body
[1:34:08] it's not as difficult as what it's a
[1:34:10] Greek word so it makes it sound
[1:34:11] difficult but a theophany is just a word
[1:34:13] body
[1:34:15] right It's let's just say it like this
[1:34:17] Jesus was the thoughts of God expressed
[1:34:20] on the earth as the son of God
[1:34:22] whatever God thought about his son was
[1:34:25] what Jesus was
[1:34:26] and that was all that he was
[1:34:29] right all within God was poured into
[1:34:30] Christ but it's those collected thoughts
[1:34:33] of God so you are there is a you
[1:34:37] if I can say it that way
[1:34:38] that is the collected thoughts the
[1:34:42] entirety of what God thought about you
[1:34:45] before you were born
[1:34:48] before
[1:34:50] even Jesus died on the cross
[1:34:52] before there was ever a world
[1:34:56] before there was a devil
[1:35:00] right
[1:35:02] there was a you
[1:35:05] right
[1:35:06] and that is your theophany
[1:35:09] it's what God says about you can we say
[1:35:12] it this way it's your truth
[1:35:14] now we hear that a lot today this is my
[1:35:16] truth
[1:35:17] right but if your truth is a theophany
[1:35:20] it was in the mind of God before the
[1:35:22] foundation of the world it is what God
[1:35:24] said about you so your truth oh God
[1:35:29] you all may know this I I've been saying
[1:35:32] this this week and tying that to the
[1:35:34] truth and it just blessed my heart so
[1:35:36] much I said God that means it's the
[1:35:37] truth that you thought about me that is
[1:35:39] the truth of who I am
[1:35:41] and everything else is alive
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:48] listen
[1:35:49] a theophany a word body
[1:35:52] and now but the rest of the difference
[1:35:53] between him and you he was the word
[1:35:55] and but you he said you're a son he was
[1:35:58] a son you're a son
[1:35:59] he said see he was at the beginning the
[1:36:01] word
[1:36:02] and in morphe body
[1:36:05] he came in and lived in that in the
[1:36:08] person of Melchizedek
[1:36:10] and then later we never heard no more
[1:36:11] melchized today because he became Jesus
[1:36:14] Christ
[1:36:15] Melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:36:17] Jesus Christ he said now you bypass that
[1:36:21] because in that form he knew all things
[1:36:23] and you have never been able to know
[1:36:26] that yet
[1:36:29] I love that part of the joke
[1:36:31] you've never been able to know that yeah
[1:36:34] he knew all things what are all things
[1:36:36] the truth
[1:36:39] you could believe a lie because you
[1:36:41] didn't have access to all the truth
[1:36:43] do you know that
[1:36:45] because people believed you couldn't go
[1:36:46] but about 30 miles an hour because
[1:36:47] they've never seen it done
[1:36:49] but when somebody did it that was the
[1:36:51] truth
[1:36:52] are you with me now now they go faster
[1:36:55] than the speed of sound why are they
[1:36:57] able to do that it's become the truth
[1:37:00] but it was all it was the truth all the
[1:37:02] time they just didn't know it
[1:37:04] he knew all things but you don't know
[1:37:06] all things yet
[1:37:08] some of us seem to turn around just
[1:37:09] apply that to ourselves right now
[1:37:12] Lord I'm going through a problem but I
[1:37:15] don't know all things yet
[1:37:16] Lord I don't understand why the
[1:37:18] preachers preaching what he's preaching
[1:37:20] but I don't know all things yet Lord I
[1:37:22] don't understand why you even still have
[1:37:24] preachers but I don't know all things
[1:37:25] yet Lord I don't understand why I have
[1:37:28] this sickness in my body but I don't
[1:37:30] know all things yet but I know you know
[1:37:32] Lord I don't know why I was raised like
[1:37:35] I was raised I don't know what about my
[1:37:37] family history I don't know a lot of
[1:37:38] things but I know the truth is you
[1:37:41] I know you are the truth I don't know
[1:37:43] all things yet
[1:37:45] he said you come like Adam like me you
[1:37:47] became from the attribute to the flesh
[1:37:49] to be tempted so those collected
[1:37:52] thoughts of God the thoughts that he had
[1:37:54] about you that was called an attribute
[1:37:57] so it come from the attribute the
[1:37:58] attribute it's just who God was
[1:38:01] right in God was your theophany
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:07] that's why you identify with the word
[1:38:11] everybody wants to identify themselves
[1:38:13] today but you identify with the word
[1:38:15] That's why nothing else will move you
[1:38:16] but the word why because the word is who
[1:38:19] you are
[1:38:21] that's why you're a message believer not
[1:38:22] because your parents were not because
[1:38:24] somebody else was not because somebody
[1:38:25] taught you something a belief system but
[1:38:28] because the word image in heaven is who
[1:38:30] you are
[1:38:36] you come from the attribute to the flesh
[1:38:37] to be tempted but when this life is
[1:38:39] finished here this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:38:41] dissolved we have one someone say
[1:38:43] already waiting
[1:38:45] what is that a word body
[1:38:47] yeah right that's where we go
[1:38:50] yeah I just love this
[1:38:52] huh
[1:38:54] that is the word
[1:38:59] some of y'all need to need to have some
[1:39:01] confidence in the word
[1:39:03] how can we hear this and still live the
[1:39:05] same as we do
[1:39:07] how can we know this and still worship
[1:39:09] the way that we do
[1:39:10] to know that An Almighty God
[1:39:13] and all sufficient God told us that we
[1:39:16] were a part of him
[1:39:17] and where we go is is the word he said
[1:39:20] then we can look back and see what we've
[1:39:21] done
[1:39:23] now watch when will you know all things
[1:39:25] we can look back and see what we've done
[1:39:28] he said now we don't understand it
[1:39:33] oh God
[1:39:35] but we have never become the word
[1:39:38] we've just become the flesh man not the
[1:39:40] word
[1:39:41] but look he said clearly it makes it
[1:39:43] clear you will never be the word unless
[1:39:45] you was a thought at the beginning that
[1:39:47] proves the predestination of God you
[1:39:49] can't be the word unless you're a
[1:39:50] thought you had to be in the thinking
[1:39:52] first
[1:39:53] you were an eagle to begin with but
[1:39:55] watch just as Jesus was the truth about
[1:39:58] the father he say I am the way the truth
[1:40:00] and the life your word body theophany is
[1:40:03] the truth about you
[1:40:06] sir
[1:40:08] see and that's why you can say that the
[1:40:10] voice that you heard
[1:40:12] was in a man's voice
[1:40:15] now watch he said you heard from your
[1:40:18] theophany
[1:40:19] you didn't hear from a man you heard
[1:40:22] from your theophany
[1:40:24] right he said brother Brown said this
[1:40:26] about his own message we need to
[1:40:27] understand the power of this word
[1:40:29] he says I wasn't the one that appeared
[1:40:31] down on the river I was only standing
[1:40:33] there when he appeared
[1:40:35] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:40:36] things for tells these things that
[1:40:37] happens as perfect as they are I'm the
[1:40:39] only one that's near when he does it I
[1:40:41] was only a voice that he used to say it
[1:40:43] it wasn't what I knew
[1:40:46] because brother Branham didn't know all
[1:40:47] things
[1:40:48] he came the same way we did he didn't
[1:40:50] buy passes he bypassed his word body
[1:40:53] like we did
[1:40:55] right but he was a prophet yeah so he
[1:40:58] had thus saith the Lord and when the
[1:41:00] word come to the prophet he said it
[1:41:02] wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:41:03] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:41:05] through it was it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:41:07] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:41:09] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:41:11] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:41:13] mystery that God unfolded
[1:41:16] it's not a man it's God the angel was
[1:41:19] not the son of man he was the messenger
[1:41:21] from the son of man the son of man is
[1:41:22] Christ he is the one that you're feeding
[1:41:24] on
[1:41:25] you're not feeding on a man his words
[1:41:27] will fail his words may not be true
[1:41:30] listen his words will fail but you're
[1:41:32] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:41:34] the son of man when God spoke through a
[1:41:36] prophet's lips it became the body of the
[1:41:38] word
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:41] and when the body of oh my you've heard
[1:41:44] from the word you didn't hear from me
[1:41:48] some of your first second third fourth
[1:41:50] fifth generation message believers
[1:41:54] you've been message Believers all your
[1:41:57] life
[1:41:58] some of you
[1:42:00] but are you feeding on the unfailing
[1:42:01] body word of the son of man
[1:42:04] why are you message believers
[1:42:06] how do you know you're hearing the truth
[1:42:09] well the anointing has to be in you
[1:42:13] and when it is it don't matter what the
[1:42:15] truth comes from what what body it comes
[1:42:17] from you've heard from your theophany
[1:42:20] not from
[1:42:21] not from a man
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:25] oh God
[1:42:26] and so what I'm doing brother Danny
[1:42:31] I know that I did certain things
[1:42:34] right are you still with me this morning
[1:42:36] I've gone way too long already
[1:42:38] actually that clock's not working
[1:42:40] I got all day
[1:42:45] I know certain things about myself
[1:42:48] right I know at what age that I grew up
[1:42:51] I know what mistakes I made I know
[1:42:54] everything about me yeah the things I
[1:42:56] remember anyway
[1:42:57] some of them I may remember right or not
[1:42:59] right because memory is not perfect
[1:43:02] right but but some of the things I may
[1:43:04] misremember I may remember hopefully
[1:43:06] maybe in a different way than someone
[1:43:07] else would remember it but I know about
[1:43:09] me I probably know more about me than
[1:43:12] you do
[1:43:13] because I lived in this body
[1:43:15] all right I know about me that's why he
[1:43:18] said brother Ben somebody call you names
[1:43:19] okay you know they can't call me any
[1:43:21] worse than what I was
[1:43:25] I can't say anything worse about me than
[1:43:26] what I've done I was a sinner
[1:43:29] right are you with me I said well what
[1:43:31] did you do brother Ben I was a sinner
[1:43:34] all right that just makes me that's just
[1:43:36] what I was now so I know about me
[1:43:40] but I'd
[1:43:41] but I didn't know
[1:43:43] about the real me
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:47] so a mighty angel came down
[1:43:49] in Revelation 10 because he had to have
[1:43:52] a bride at the end time that knew who
[1:43:54] they were
[1:43:55] because they were going to go get a word
[1:43:57] body
[1:43:59] there had to be somebody who heard from
[1:44:01] their theophany so a mighty Angel come
[1:44:02] down and opened up the book and he began
[1:44:04] to read and began to open up the book to
[1:44:06] us and he come through a prophet and
[1:44:07] begin to preach to us and begin to tell
[1:44:09] us these things and as he told us he
[1:44:11] told us about an eagle story and what
[1:44:13] did it do something inside of you said
[1:44:15] that's me
[1:44:16] he told us about broken sisters and you
[1:44:18] said I was in those broken sisters but
[1:44:20] now I'm in that well of Living Water he
[1:44:22] told you about marriage and divorce and
[1:44:24] you knew what the truth was he told you
[1:44:26] what were you learning you were not
[1:44:27] learning just the truth about a book
[1:44:31] you were learning the truth about you
[1:44:36] you could say brother Joel you could say
[1:44:37] I was in Hot Springs I was in Nevada I
[1:44:40] live in Hardy now that's the truth about
[1:44:41] me but it's really the LIE the truth
[1:44:44] about you is you're a Son of God but for
[1:44:46] the foundation of the world and the
[1:44:48] devil can't take that away from you
[1:44:50] the truth is you're not forsaken the
[1:44:53] truth is you can't be denied
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:59] you know feeding on a man
[1:45:01] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:45:04] the son of man the truth
[1:45:06] and you learn the truth about you as you
[1:45:08] feed on the word
[1:45:09] you're becoming
[1:45:11] that truth
[1:45:13] now pilate pilate asked him he said what
[1:45:15] is the truth what is truth
[1:45:18] a pilot with hearing his words
[1:45:21] he said right in front of him
[1:45:24] so what's truth
[1:45:25] what is truth
[1:45:28] Jesus didn't go into a full explanation
[1:45:33] but look
[1:45:34] what is truth
[1:45:36] the truth about is still on
[1:45:40] the truth about Pilate
[1:45:42] is that
[1:45:43] is that pilate was not the elect
[1:45:47] now that's hard for some of us to take
[1:45:48] but it's the truth
[1:45:50] that's the truth
[1:45:51] the truth is pilate would never receive
[1:45:54] it
[1:45:56] now he he knew
[1:46:00] who Jesus was
[1:46:02] he knew that Jesus was not a sinner
[1:46:06] right
[1:46:08] there's people who know what this
[1:46:09] message is
[1:46:10] they know that brother Branham was a
[1:46:12] prophet
[1:46:14] I think pilate believed that Jesus was
[1:46:17] probably a prophet
[1:46:19] pilate knew that there was nothing
[1:46:21] against him
[1:46:23] but he could not stand the test
[1:46:25] of politics
[1:46:28] why could he not stand the test of
[1:46:29] politics because the truth he did not
[1:46:32] love the truth
[1:46:33] he only stood in front of the truth and
[1:46:36] heard the truth
[1:46:37] but he wasn't the truth
[1:46:40] are you with me now so he heard his
[1:46:42] words
[1:46:43] but he never came to his words he ended
[1:46:45] up committing suicide
[1:46:47] because he couldn't handle what he had
[1:46:49] done he knew what he did was wrong
[1:46:51] he knew the message was right but he
[1:46:53] could not receive it
[1:46:55] oh God but listen there's a truth there
[1:46:58] was people who had truth now look there
[1:47:00] was a woman in psychar in the city of
[1:47:03] psycho and Samaria and in that City the
[1:47:05] men of that City thought they knew the
[1:47:07] truth about that woman the women of that
[1:47:09] City thought they knew the truth about
[1:47:11] that woman they said the truth is she's
[1:47:13] a prostitute the truth is she'd been
[1:47:14] married five times and the one she's
[1:47:16] been married to now is not her husband
[1:47:18] but listen when the when the one when
[1:47:20] the word came down and began to speak to
[1:47:22] her the son of man began to reveal her
[1:47:24] heart first it told her the truth about
[1:47:26] what she was but then she realized if
[1:47:28] you know amen yeah
[1:47:31] if you know what I've done and who I am
[1:47:33] then you know all about me you know what
[1:47:36] I was before I ever made a sin before I
[1:47:39] ever made a mistake before I ever
[1:47:41] committed a sin before I ever committed
[1:47:42] adultery she said if you know what I did
[1:47:44] you know what I didn't do you know what
[1:47:47] I was before I did it
[1:47:52] I mean a psycho I thought they knew the
[1:47:54] truth but the true life she lived was to
[1:47:57] lie
[1:47:58] and Jesus was the truth
[1:48:02] because of that
[1:48:04] they had been bound by the lies she had
[1:48:06] been bound by the LIE
[1:48:07] but when she heard the truth
[1:48:09] she was set free
[1:48:12] the men who caught the woman in the act
[1:48:15] of adultery knew the truth about that
[1:48:17] woman
[1:48:18] the Bible said they caught her in the
[1:48:20] very Act
[1:48:21] they knew the truth about what she had
[1:48:24] done
[1:48:25] oh God but Jesus knew a truth beyond
[1:48:29] what they knew
[1:48:31] yeah
[1:48:32] he knew a truth that she didn't even
[1:48:34] know
[1:48:35] right aren't you glad he knew things
[1:48:36] about you that you didn't know
[1:48:38] because he knew that I would be a
[1:48:40] Christian he knew that I would be a
[1:48:42] believer he knew that I would love the
[1:48:44] message I didn't know that
[1:48:46] I didn't come into the world knowing
[1:48:47] that but he knew it and so he knew that
[1:48:50] she would believe he knew he didn't just
[1:48:52] go to everybody they probably stoned
[1:48:53] many women yeah
[1:48:55] for adultery but here was one woman who
[1:48:58] was the elect of God and Jesus had a
[1:49:01] need to go by her way when he went by
[1:49:03] her way here she was they dragged him in
[1:49:04] front of her and said what do we do with
[1:49:06] her and he said he who commits without
[1:49:09] sin commit the first son because he knew
[1:49:10] the truth about all of them
[1:49:13] laughs
[1:49:14] he knew the truth about all of them and
[1:49:16] from the oldest Who had most the most
[1:49:18] sense to the youngest they'll turn and
[1:49:20] walked off
[1:49:22] and Jesus is standing in the middle mid
[1:49:24] middle of a circle of dropped stones
[1:49:28] he looks up he writes something in the
[1:49:30] sand he looks up
[1:49:32] he says woman
[1:49:33] where are your accusers
[1:49:38] oh God
[1:49:42] you know you can fight with the truth
[1:49:45] but you might as well just believe it
[1:49:49] she could have sat there and said well
[1:49:50] they caught me
[1:49:52] what did she say
[1:49:54] nobody
[1:49:57] they all left
[1:50:01] where are your accusers they all left
[1:50:03] what does the Bible say there is
[1:50:05] therefore now no condemnation of them
[1:50:07] were in Christ Jesus they walked not
[1:50:08] after the flesh after the spirit we
[1:50:09] found out last week that condemnation
[1:50:11] was verdict there is no verdict
[1:50:13] you may still feel the shame of it but
[1:50:15] there's no verdict against you
[1:50:18] there's no condemnation there's no
[1:50:20] verdict there was no verdict against her
[1:50:22] because the accusers had cast been cast
[1:50:24] down
[1:50:25] they were bound but she was free
[1:50:27] at the time Jesus was crucified pilate
[1:50:30] was bound by the lion closing go ahead
[1:50:32] and musicians go ahead and come at the
[1:50:34] time Jesus was crucified pilate was
[1:50:36] bound by the LIE the Pharisees were
[1:50:37] Bound by the LIE the people who cried
[1:50:39] crucified were Bound by the LIE
[1:50:42] but the thief on the cross
[1:50:45] was set free by the truth
[1:50:50] what was it they heard from their word
[1:50:51] body
[1:50:54] they heard from their word body
[1:50:56] they heard the truth
[1:50:58] about themselves
[1:51:00] the Bible says let every man's word be a
[1:51:03] lie and gods be true
[1:51:06] I've heard what the people have to say
[1:51:09] I've heard what they have to say on
[1:51:10] Facebook
[1:51:12] I know what God Said
[1:51:14] how many say Amen to that today I know
[1:51:17] what God said about me and that is the
[1:51:20] truth would you bow your heads with me
[1:51:23] are you bound this morning are you free
[1:51:26] the truth shall set you free you will
[1:51:28] know the truth
[1:51:31] and the truth
[1:51:33] will make you free
[1:51:34] why live under bondage
[1:51:37] what's the point of that
[1:51:42] you say well maybe I'll somehow punish
[1:51:44] myself for what I've done long enough
[1:51:45] that
[1:51:46] then I can be delivered from it no
[1:51:49] amount of punishments you ever do to
[1:51:50] yourself will ever deliver you from the
[1:51:52] LIE
[1:51:54] only the truth
[1:51:58] can deliver you from the LIE
[1:52:01] you can't make yourself believe
[1:52:02] something because somebody said it
[1:52:04] any man on this Earth that spoke it I
[1:52:07] would have doubted it
[1:52:09] but God said
[1:52:11] I didn't just hear
[1:52:13] from the angel that lightened the Earth
[1:52:15] in Revelation 18 but I heard
[1:52:17] from The Voice from Heaven I had to hear
[1:52:20] the teacher on the earth the prophet on
[1:52:23] the Earth but I also had to hear a voice
[1:52:26] from heaven
[1:52:27] said come out of her my people
[1:52:30] this is the truth
[1:52:34] the truth is you know within yourself
[1:52:37] the truth
[1:52:40] you know it
[1:52:41] you if you have the Holy Ghost you know
[1:52:43] it
[1:52:45] why don't you let it be true let every
[1:52:47] man's word be a lie and God's word be
[1:52:50] true
[1:52:52] the truth has set us free free from
[1:52:54] worry free from Fear
[1:52:56] free to worship
[1:52:59] if there's something that you're not
[1:53:00] free about this morning would you just
[1:53:02] take a moment before we worship and just
[1:53:04] talk to him about it maybe maybe you've
[1:53:06] never accepted the truth in whatever
[1:53:07] form that you know it in there's
[1:53:09] something maybe that you're doing you
[1:53:10] know better yeah
[1:53:12] yet you realize that you're doing it
[1:53:15] maybe you can't even stop it but he can
[1:53:16] help you today
[1:53:18] he's the truth
[1:53:20] maybe you believe lies about yourself
[1:53:23] all
[1:53:25] all the things and they were True Lies
[1:53:27] if we could say it that way
[1:53:30] lives that seem to you to be true and
