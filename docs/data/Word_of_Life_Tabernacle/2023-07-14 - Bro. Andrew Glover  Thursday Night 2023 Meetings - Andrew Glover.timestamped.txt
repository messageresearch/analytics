[1:07:40] a man and amen God bless you this
[1:07:42] evening if you have your Bibles we want
[1:07:44] to turn to the Book of Psalms the 34th
[1:07:46] chapter The Book of Psalms the 34th
[1:07:49] chapter we're going to look there and
[1:07:51] also in the Book of Mark the 10th
[1:07:52] chapter
[1:07:53] in Psalms 34 and verse 6 I'm just going
[1:07:56] to read one verse
[1:07:58] um it would just open our thoughts here
[1:08:01] for this evening in Psalms 34 and verse
[1:08:04] number six you love the Lord tonight
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:08] David here says this poor man cried and
[1:08:12] the Lord heard him
[1:08:14] and saved him out of all of his troubles
[1:08:18] amen this poor man cried and the Lord
[1:08:22] heard him and saved him out of all of
[1:08:27] his troubles in The Book of Mark the
[1:08:29] 10th chapter
[1:08:30] in the 46th verse I want to read a
[1:08:33] portion of scripture there I know that
[1:08:35] you all know these verses by heart it's
[1:08:38] the story of blind Bartimaeus sitting at
[1:08:40] a powerful testimony in Bon Bartimaeus
[1:08:43] life amen in Mark 10
[1:08:46] in verse number 46
[1:08:48] the Bible here says and they came to
[1:08:51] Jericho as he went out of Jericho with
[1:08:54] his disciples and a great number of
[1:08:55] people blind Bartimaeus the son of
[1:08:58] Timaeus Sat by the highway side begging
[1:09:01] and when he heard that it was Jesus of
[1:09:03] Nazareth he began to cry out and say
[1:09:06] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[1:09:12] and many charged him that he should hold
[1:09:15] his peace but he cried the more a great
[1:09:18] deal saying thou son of David have mercy
[1:09:22] on me now brother Bram says it like this
[1:09:25] on this next verse Jesus Stood Still
[1:09:27] brother Brahm said his faith stopped
[1:09:30] Jesus in his tracks
[1:09:31] and he commanded him to be called and
[1:09:34] they called the blind man sent unto him
[1:09:36] be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee
[1:09:39] and he casting away His Garment Rose and
[1:09:42] came to Jesus and Jesus answered and
[1:09:44] said unto him what will the thy should
[1:09:46] do unto thee and the blind man said unto
[1:09:48] him Lord that I might receive my sight
[1:09:51] and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy
[1:09:55] faith hath made the whole and
[1:09:57] immediately he received his sight and
[1:10:00] followed Jesus in the way amen we ask
[1:10:03] the Lord this evening to add the
[1:10:04] blessings the reading of his word as you
[1:10:06] can have your seats here this afternoon
[1:10:08] amen we thank the Lord for the reading
[1:10:10] of the word of God Amen
[1:10:12] and from those passages of scripture
[1:10:14] tonight if the Lord would help me for
[1:10:16] just a few moments I want to speak to
[1:10:18] you here on a thought and if I would
[1:10:19] title this tonight I want to speak to
[1:10:21] you on the power of your pull the power
[1:10:24] of your pool now uh maybe to take a
[1:10:27] context out of that I would like to say
[1:10:28] this amen that you operate the gift amen
[1:10:32] the power of your pool but you operate
[1:10:35] the gift now when you look at this word
[1:10:37] pool Webster says it means to exert
[1:10:39] force on someone or something so as to
[1:10:42] cause movement towards oneself it is an
[1:10:45] act of taking a hold of something and
[1:10:47] exerting Force to draw it towards one so
[1:10:49] amen when you're pulling on something
[1:10:51] it's not something casual it's not
[1:10:53] something amen that you just do out of
[1:10:55] out of habit or but it's actually you're
[1:10:57] putting forth an effort to get a hold of
[1:10:59] something you're putting forth an effort
[1:11:01] he meant to pull on something it is a
[1:11:03] force a man that is drawing on someone
[1:11:05] or something amen into a particular
[1:11:08] direction or course of action I believe
[1:11:11] tonight amen that our God is a god of
[1:11:13] action I don't believe he's a god a man
[1:11:16] that works on feelings he don't work on
[1:11:17] emotions he don't work on sensation amen
[1:11:20] but he works upon the basis of his word
[1:11:22] and the prophet God said as a Believer
[1:11:25] we're not in the where we are in the
[1:11:27] hand of God right amen then the prophet
[1:11:30] says every True Believer is in the hand
[1:11:32] of God and they can draw from his love
[1:11:34] and his power Amen to receive the full
[1:11:37] benefit of all that God is to the
[1:11:39] believer amen what God gives the
[1:11:42] messenger and How He blesses and uses
[1:11:43] the messenger is an example to all
[1:11:45] believers amen of his goodness and care
[1:11:48] to all amen the members of his body amen
[1:11:52] than what he was to Paul is what he is
[1:11:54] to every believer what he wants to
[1:11:56] Columbus is what he is to every believer
[1:11:58] what he was to William Branham amen is
[1:12:00] what he is to every believer of this end
[1:12:03] time word amen because it's not be eyes
[1:12:06] and little U's and this and that amen
[1:12:08] but it's on the basis of the word of God
[1:12:10] that he said I'll never leave thee I'll
[1:12:11] never forget take me but I'll be with me
[1:12:14] even in thee until the end of the world
[1:12:16] that we're not coming to these meetings
[1:12:18] to draw from the Flesh of a Preacher
[1:12:20] we're not coming to draw from the
[1:12:21] personality of a Preacher amen but we
[1:12:24] are here tonight to draw amen from the
[1:12:26] love of God from the goodness of God
[1:12:28] from the mercy of God from the grace of
[1:12:30] God they said whatever is in God is in
[1:12:33] his word amen because he is his word and
[1:12:36] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:38] forever if you need healing you're not
[1:12:40] going to draw it from the Flesh of
[1:12:41] Andrew Glover you're not going to draw
[1:12:43] it from the Flesh of brother Dale or
[1:12:45] brother Wendell amen but if you'll start
[1:12:47] pulling on the word amen then the god of
[1:12:49] action will come into the building as
[1:12:52] the supernatural God that he is and he
[1:12:54] will manifest himself in every Divine
[1:12:56] promise that his word said he would do
[1:12:58] now when you start thinking about
[1:13:00] drawing from God Amen whatever we draw
[1:13:03] from God Amen is coming from an unseen
[1:13:06] resource amen but it's coming through
[1:13:08] Christ amen whatever we draw from God is
[1:13:12] coming from The Unseen amen but we're
[1:13:14] drawing it through the channel amen of
[1:13:17] the spirit of God then the prophet would
[1:13:19] tell you everything that is real amen is
[1:13:22] unseen he would say go buy me some love
[1:13:24] you can't do it can you it'd say go buy
[1:13:27] me some peace she can't do it amen
[1:13:29] because the things that are seen amen
[1:13:31] are temporary but the things that are
[1:13:34] not seen are Eternal and we are not the
[1:13:37] children amen of a sin God Amen of
[1:13:40] Science and education amen but we are
[1:13:42] the sons and daughters of Jehovah and he
[1:13:45] is an unseen God but he has sent a
[1:13:47] message in this hour and the invisible
[1:13:49] God has been convincible into this
[1:13:52] generation amen not by our feelings not
[1:13:54] by our music amen but by the preaching
[1:13:57] of the unsearchable riches of Jesus
[1:13:59] Christ the son of God has come into the
[1:14:02] building and you know he's here because
[1:14:04] your faith declares he's here whether
[1:14:06] you feel him or not your faith declares
[1:14:08] him whether your body testifies of it I
[1:14:11] know some of y'all sitting here tonight
[1:14:13] and you're sick in your body amen your
[1:14:15] body is not declared he's here amen I
[1:14:18] know some of you are here and you're low
[1:14:19] in your spirit but your spirit is not
[1:14:21] declaring he's here amen but you're here
[1:14:23] because greater is he that is in you
[1:14:26] than he that is in the feeling that he
[1:14:28] that is in the senses of the human amen
[1:14:30] our God is an unseen God and he's known
[1:14:33] by faith he's known by the super sense
[1:14:36] amen whenever Jesus Come into town amen
[1:14:39] it was hard on his body amen he was
[1:14:41] tired his body was wore out brother
[1:14:43] remember said you know as he went along
[1:14:45] amen the people drew God out of him amen
[1:14:48] the people drew God right out of him he
[1:14:52] said see what they done was they drew
[1:14:54] their desires from him was Jesus brother
[1:14:57] Tim was on the earth they were pulling
[1:14:59] on him and then they were drawing on him
[1:15:02] and what they were doing is they were
[1:15:03] drawing their desires amen out of him
[1:15:06] listen there's only one God who can meet
[1:15:09] your expectation there's only one God
[1:15:12] who can meet the desire of your heart
[1:15:14] and his name is Jesus Christ and he's
[1:15:17] here tonight in the power of his
[1:15:19] resurrection to do exactly what his word
[1:15:21] said he would do yes sir he is here and
[1:15:24] my faith declares he's here brother Josh
[1:15:26] my feelings don't but my face to us and
[1:15:28] if my faith declares him then greater is
[1:15:31] my faith in my soul than the feeling in
[1:15:34] my body
[1:15:36] greater is the faith in my soul than the
[1:15:39] feeling in my body amen come on Church
[1:15:42] greater is the faith in your soul I know
[1:15:45] some of y'all shouldn't be sitting here
[1:15:46] tonight amen but you're here and then
[1:15:49] you should have been gone a long time
[1:15:50] ago amen but you're sitting here tonight
[1:15:53] do you know why you're sitting here as a
[1:15:55] testimony amen that there's nothing the
[1:15:58] devil could do Amen to conquer the faith
[1:16:01] of God that has been restored to the
[1:16:03] message of Malachi 4. yes sir amen when
[1:16:06] I think about God come in the building I
[1:16:08] heard the prophet say today he said when
[1:16:10] the supernatural comes in he said the
[1:16:12] supernatural will change amen the course
[1:16:15] of the meeting I don't know what y'all
[1:16:17] want but I'll tell you what I want amen
[1:16:19] is I want the supernatural Amen to come
[1:16:22] in this building so strong that you
[1:16:24] cannot see me you cannot hear me only
[1:16:27] thing you can see amen is to fail that's
[1:16:30] the Mighty God is chosen in this hour to
[1:16:32] unfold himself through yes sir that word
[1:16:35] that power hour amen is real and you're
[1:16:38] drawing from it you're not drawn from
[1:16:40] your favorite preacher you're not drawn
[1:16:41] from the personality of a man you're
[1:16:44] drawing from the word now I got to
[1:16:46] thinking about this the power of your
[1:16:48] pull and just a simple illustration I I
[1:16:50] got to thinking about one time as a kid
[1:16:52] my grandfather he took me over to a
[1:16:54] sawmill and we went over there and there
[1:16:56] was a piece of a log we took over there
[1:16:58] but the man and they laid that log out
[1:17:00] on the table and the guy said he ever he
[1:17:02] told me he said young man you ever seen
[1:17:03] a law cut I said well I've seen it with
[1:17:05] a chainsaw he said have you ever seen a
[1:17:07] log song cut along and I said no ain't
[1:17:09] never seen that he said well you're
[1:17:10] fisting too and he laid that log down
[1:17:12] took a saw and he laid it across the top
[1:17:15] of that log and he got on one side and
[1:17:17] another guy got on the other side and
[1:17:19] what this guy done was he pushed that
[1:17:21] saw amen and there was a guy pulling
[1:17:23] that saw and then the other guy would
[1:17:25] push it back and then he would push it
[1:17:27] back and before long the other guy on
[1:17:29] the other hand he got up and walked away
[1:17:31] and did something different and a few
[1:17:33] minutes that guy was pushing then he was
[1:17:35] running around there and pushing it back
[1:17:36] amen what happened amen with two it was
[1:17:39] getting done amen but with one it was
[1:17:41] taking more time it was taken more
[1:17:44] effort it was taken more ability amen
[1:17:46] but when the two were working together
[1:17:48] they meant to accomplish the natural
[1:17:51] task hey then then there was a power
[1:17:53] amen when two was working together the
[1:17:56] prophet of God said that revivals only
[1:17:58] come amen by the Holy Ghost he said he's
[1:18:01] the one who brings the Revival we cannot
[1:18:04] do it we can only make the effort amen
[1:18:07] and God has to bless the effort and I
[1:18:09] trust that he will amen so there's one
[1:18:12] up here tonight preaching and there's a
[1:18:14] whole church out there pulling amen but
[1:18:16] let me tell you that's not enough
[1:18:18] they've been to get the spiritual past
[1:18:20] done we can preach to life we can preach
[1:18:23] till our tonsils fall out and you can
[1:18:25] pull to your physically wore out amen
[1:18:28] but unless the Holy Ghost amen will come
[1:18:30] down upon the effort and he will move
[1:18:33] upon the face of the people then it's
[1:18:35] just another mean I'm just another
[1:18:37] preacher but if the spirit of God Amen
[1:18:40] we're coming to the building he will
[1:18:42] heal every sickness he will forgive
[1:18:44] every sin he will deliver every captive
[1:18:46] he will move by the power of the Holy
[1:18:49] Ghost because he's God
[1:18:51] you know what we're gonna do we're gonna
[1:18:54] preach and you're going to pull and
[1:18:56] God's Gonna bless I said somebody gonna
[1:18:59] preach and somebody's gonna pull and the
[1:19:02] Holy Ghost is gonna bless because we can
[1:19:05] put forth the effort but it's going to
[1:19:07] take him to bring the results see what
[1:19:10] happens he is amen is you've got to get
[1:19:13] your spirit in condition to work with
[1:19:15] the atmosphere you've got to get your
[1:19:18] spirit in condition to receive the word
[1:19:21] and not resent the word the prophet said
[1:19:23] if you've got a resenting audience then
[1:19:25] the Holy Spirit won't even reveal
[1:19:28] he said no you gotta have something that
[1:19:31] is working together he said they were in
[1:19:34] one place one Accord and then there came
[1:19:36] a sound from Heaven as a Russian Mighty
[1:19:39] Wind see no matter how much I pray and
[1:19:42] lay their day and night studying and
[1:19:44] praying before the Lord and I would walk
[1:19:46] down there maybe the anointed on me I
[1:19:48] would walk up here and feel that
[1:19:50] resentment see it just screams him right
[1:19:52] away he will not reveal nothing but when
[1:19:55] you walk down here and you're under the
[1:19:58] anointing and you feel your audience
[1:20:00] under the anointing then that's when the
[1:20:02] Holy Spirit begins to work and he begins
[1:20:05] to move and he begins to do great things
[1:20:08] for us I'm on church if he's not here
[1:20:12] nothing's going to get done that's an
[1:20:14] old song we used to sing if God don't do
[1:20:16] it it ain't gonna get done and that's
[1:20:18] real here tonight if God don't do the
[1:20:20] healing and ain't gonna get done if God
[1:20:22] don't do the saving it ain't gonna get
[1:20:24] done if God don't do the revealing and
[1:20:27] ain't gonna get done but I be clear to
[1:20:29] you tonight that he is here and he's
[1:20:31] hearing the power of his resurrection to
[1:20:34] do exactly what he promised you he would
[1:20:36] do when two or three would gather
[1:20:38] together in my name he said there I will
[1:20:40] be in their midst then your faith with
[1:20:42] my faith and the blessing of the Holy
[1:20:45] Spirit upon that faith will literally
[1:20:47] operate the work of God see he's already
[1:20:50] given us the blessings it's a finished
[1:20:52] work amen we're not working on it we're
[1:20:55] not adding to it it's already finished
[1:20:57] so what does he do he sends his spirit
[1:21:00] amen and we operate the work of God by
[1:21:04] the energy of the Holy Spirit now that
[1:21:06] word operates a powerful word it means
[1:21:09] to control amen the functioning of
[1:21:11] something so if you're operating
[1:21:13] something you're controlling the way it
[1:21:15] works you're controlling the you're
[1:21:17] controlling the benefit or you're
[1:21:19] unlocking things in it and the prophet
[1:21:21] of God 1951 he introduces the term amen
[1:21:24] the operation of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:21:27] the Holy Spirit that was up on the
[1:21:29] church at Pentecost has come right down
[1:21:31] to the age has come right on down to the
[1:21:34] age to the Luther of the Baptist the
[1:21:36] Methodist and right on down amen into
[1:21:38] this age here now come on let's go ahead
[1:21:40] and say what a prophet said he said
[1:21:42] there's been seven Gentile successive
[1:21:45] churches amen but in the end time there
[1:21:48] was to come the Capstone Ministry which
[1:21:50] would be the stone amen that the
[1:21:52] builders rejected it would be the
[1:21:54] headstone it would be the Capstone and
[1:21:57] the prophet of God said it would be a
[1:21:59] triumphal entry of that Capstone and it
[1:22:01] would be for the perfecting of the Bride
[1:22:03] has it dawned on you Church we're not at
[1:22:06] the bottom of the pyramid we're not way
[1:22:08] halfway up to Pyramid amen but we've
[1:22:11] climbed to Luther we've climbed too
[1:22:13] Wesley we've climbed two Pentecost and
[1:22:15] we have spent amen into the Perfection
[1:22:18] of the word itself listen friends amen
[1:22:21] this is our age and a prophet said there
[1:22:23] will be a bright age well here we are so
[1:22:27] we might as well enjoy it amen there's a
[1:22:29] bright age with a bright anointing with
[1:22:31] the bright lights it's bright time if
[1:22:34] there's ever been a time for the bride
[1:22:36] to enjoy the benefits that she's pulling
[1:22:39] from an unseen resource Now's the Time
[1:22:42] to enjoy it if there's ever been a time
[1:22:44] Amen to break out of all the religious
[1:22:47] ideas and problems and situations and
[1:22:50] pull now's the time to do it
[1:22:53] because he's the same Holy Spirit he
[1:22:56] said when people's Faith amen will get
[1:22:58] up into a place they'll get the
[1:23:00] blessings to realize it's theirs then
[1:23:03] the same operation of the holy spirit
[1:23:05] will be operating in the church like it
[1:23:09] did back there it will be just the same
[1:23:12] other places said may we commit
[1:23:13] ourselves to God for the operation of
[1:23:17] the Holy Spirit another place he says
[1:23:19] God in his Mercy through the operation
[1:23:21] of the Holy Spirit he reveals spiritual
[1:23:25] truth the word itself amen so the the
[1:23:29] spiritual Revelation can only come into
[1:23:32] your life by the operation of the Holy
[1:23:36] Ghost now you know what that is that's
[1:23:37] Isaiah 7 when he said behold a virgin
[1:23:40] shall conceive and she shall bring forth
[1:23:43] a son prompt of God said what was that
[1:23:45] that was a super sign it was God the
[1:23:48] word amen manifested in flesh he said in
[1:23:51] May Our Lives be so fitted with word
[1:23:53] that the word will become flesh Among Us
[1:23:56] and will give the people Faith Amen to
[1:23:59] draw from their account in heaven well
[1:24:02] glory to God May the word come Among Us
[1:24:04] in such a powerful way brother man that
[1:24:07] it will raise the people's Faith to a
[1:24:09] level that you will draw from your
[1:24:11] account in heaven listen friends if
[1:24:14] you're waiting on somebody Amen to
[1:24:16] deposit the funds in your bank account
[1:24:17] then there's a waiting period and you
[1:24:20] cannot draw no benefits but if the funds
[1:24:23] are already in there well I feel like
[1:24:26] preaching if the funds are already in
[1:24:28] there then you don't have to wait amen
[1:24:30] come on Church you don't have to wait
[1:24:32] till somebody to process the check you
[1:24:34] don't have to wait till somebody
[1:24:35] deposits the money if the funds are in
[1:24:38] there and you come to acknowledge that
[1:24:40] there's enough money in the bank to
[1:24:42] cover the purchase then you're not going
[1:24:44] to be reserved you're going to draw from
[1:24:47] the benefits of your bank account well
[1:24:49] that's an Earthly bank account but what
[1:24:51] about the Heavenly bank account whether
[1:24:53] there's unlimited funds if you need Joy
[1:24:56] it's in your account if you need healing
[1:24:58] it's in your account if you need a
[1:25:00] breakthrough it's in your account if you
[1:25:03] need the Holy Ghost it's already in your
[1:25:06] account we just gotta break out of this
[1:25:08] Earthbound chatter chatter chatter and
[1:25:10] step into a realm with god with the
[1:25:12] Unseen God becomes the Unseen visible
[1:25:15] guest Among Us
[1:25:17] him well I feel like preaching here
[1:25:19] tonight I'm talking about somebody
[1:25:21] that's not going to sit back and let the
[1:25:24] devil hands you a rain check and say
[1:25:26] come back tomorrow night and come back
[1:25:28] Saturday morning and come back oh no we
[1:25:30] gonna get it tonight
[1:25:32] we gonna get it tonight we're gonna get
[1:25:35] our healing tonight we're going to get
[1:25:37] our answer tonight we're going to get
[1:25:39] our Miracle tonight we ain't gotta wait
[1:25:41] it's already in the account
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:45] well I feel like shouting on Mountain
[1:25:47] amen when the word recognizes you when
[1:25:51] you recognize the word Jesus said it'll
[1:25:53] be account a long time ago the funds are
[1:25:58] already in there now what is happening
[1:26:01] then is in these Services you're calling
[1:26:04] out you're calling out for a withdrawal
[1:26:06] from the account you know if there's no
[1:26:09] deposit then there's no withdrawal right
[1:26:13] no deposit no withdrawal no money no
[1:26:17] purchase
[1:26:19] but that day on Calvary
[1:26:23] he settled everything and deposited into
[1:26:27] every single one of your accounts
[1:26:31] the only thing it's gonna take to get it
[1:26:34] out of your account and get it into your
[1:26:36] body is the pool of faith when your
[1:26:39] faith gets up to a level to believe God
[1:26:42] for the promise you will literally draw
[1:26:45] amen that deposit into your account into
[1:26:48] your flesh
[1:26:50] well God have mercy amen amen God in his
[1:26:54] Mercy before the little babies born
[1:26:56] what's he doing is craving for some
[1:26:58] vitamin and the mother's word speaks
[1:27:00] forth and says Dad I want a cantaloupe
[1:27:02] or I want a watermelon I want something
[1:27:04] another he'll never he'll do everything
[1:27:06] he can because he wants his child to be
[1:27:10] born as perfect as he can be he said now
[1:27:12] that's a natural father he said but what
[1:27:15] about your spiritual father he's more
[1:27:17] ablor to get it see he's a Creator now
[1:27:20] think how able he is Amen to prepare us
[1:27:23] a body to live like his own glorious
[1:27:25] body if we want to live now listen at
[1:27:27] these words there is something in us
[1:27:30] there is something in us that is calling
[1:27:33] to live and there is something in us
[1:27:35] that is calling us to do rights then
[1:27:38] watch God will call somebody on the
[1:27:40] platform or the poop head he says that
[1:27:43] will preach the absolute truth why see
[1:27:46] it shows that if you're a real child of
[1:27:49] God you begin to cry out God taken away
[1:27:52] from me circumcised me from this sea
[1:27:55] take these things away from me why are
[1:27:57] you crying that out because it's needed
[1:28:00] for your heavenly home see if you can
[1:28:02] see that you've got to be a real
[1:28:05] wordbride of Christ the only thing that
[1:28:08] will inhabit Heaven is the word that's
[1:28:10] why the prophet said that heaven
[1:28:12] consists of the word
[1:28:15] come on Church Heaven consists of the
[1:28:18] word see then we're living in the time
[1:28:20] when we shouldn't be immature we should
[1:28:23] be mature we're living in the time we're
[1:28:26] maturity should be the fruit on the vine
[1:28:28] it should be the fruit in our lives come
[1:28:30] on Amen we're not about your immature
[1:28:32] babies we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:35] that have been manifested by the by the
[1:28:37] word of God and the age we're living in
[1:28:39] listen we're living in the time amen
[1:28:42] when the spirits are coming to a head
[1:28:43] those two Spirits from Genesis amen are
[1:28:46] coming to maturity he said see that
[1:28:49] first is the true Spirit and the second
[1:28:51] is the false spirit amen now watch this
[1:28:53] the idea then has been introduced if
[1:28:56] we're if we're if we're moving along if
[1:28:58] that's okay the idea has been introduced
[1:29:00] amen that there is a true and a false
[1:29:03] faithful Ministry now I'll go so far
[1:29:05] with you on that that there's a lot of
[1:29:07] preachers ain't got no business in the
[1:29:08] Pulpit I'll go that far with you amen
[1:29:11] but don't you let a hypocrite amen
[1:29:13] squash the ability of God Amen to save a
[1:29:16] man and fill him with the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:19] use him for his honor and Glory I know
[1:29:21] there's been a lot of Hypocrites and
[1:29:23] there's going to be a lot more amen but
[1:29:25] turn your eyes off of the falls and Look
[1:29:27] Away to Jesus one time and watch God
[1:29:30] come on church I'll just say this if God
[1:29:32] can use Andrew Clover he can use anybody
[1:29:34] sitting here tonight I was as lost as
[1:29:37] lost could be I was as undone as undone
[1:29:40] could be but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:29:42] amen came on the scene because there was
[1:29:45] something in my soul that was calling
[1:29:47] out for a deposit from my heavenly bank
[1:29:50] account
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:55] amen now where the Devil comes in is he
[1:29:58] comes in and attempts to identify amen a
[1:30:00] true faithful Ministry and a false
[1:30:02] faithful Ministry but let's not take
[1:30:04] what I think you think or anybody else
[1:30:06] thinks let's take what a prophet said
[1:30:08] and the prophet of God will show you
[1:30:10] that the identifying characteristic of a
[1:30:13] true Ministry is second Timothy the
[1:30:15] fourth chapter amen preach the word
[1:30:18] preach the word that's the only thing
[1:30:21] that belongs in a puppy it is the word
[1:30:24] foreign
[1:30:26] myself but it's the truth anyhow your
[1:30:29] feelings and opinions do not belong in
[1:30:31] the Pulpit my ideas are the way I think
[1:30:33] things ought to be does not belong in
[1:30:36] the puppy the only thing that belongs in
[1:30:38] the puppet is the safest seventh angel
[1:30:41] because it's the truth it's been
[1:30:43] Vindicated by God the whole church it
[1:30:46] was Vindicated in the heavens it's been
[1:30:48] Vindicated on the earth and now it's
[1:30:50] being Vindicated In the Flesh of the
[1:30:52] Bride of Jesus Christ and there ain't
[1:30:55] enough devils in hell to stop it the
[1:30:57] word will prevail
[1:30:59] this word will prevail it'll Prevail
[1:31:02] over your feelings it'll Prevail over
[1:31:04] our ideas preach the word it says you'll
[1:31:07] be instant in season out of season you
[1:31:09] reprove you rebuke you exhorts with all
[1:31:12] long-suffering and Doctrine that's what
[1:31:15] the prophet said in your soul is calling
[1:31:18] out for it's calling out for the
[1:31:21] absolute truth
[1:31:23] and the only thing that's the absolute
[1:31:26] truth is the word see then the true
[1:31:29] faithful ministry will stand behind the
[1:31:31] pulpit and they will preach the absolute
[1:31:34] truth they will not take them put a pair
[1:31:36] of gloves on when they see makeup come
[1:31:38] in the church they will not put a pair
[1:31:40] of gloves on when they see short skirts
[1:31:42] and well we might as well preach it it's
[1:31:44] revival time they're not going to back
[1:31:46] up and take a back seat because half the
[1:31:49] church got televisions they're going to
[1:31:51] stand with a word and they're going to
[1:31:53] rebuke him Spirits because there's a
[1:31:55] bride that's got to be birthed out of
[1:31:57] this confusion and step into the
[1:31:59] promises of God
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:02] come on Church somebody's going to
[1:32:04] Manifest this message some young girl is
[1:32:07] going to live clean some young boy is
[1:32:09] going to live above reproach why not you
[1:32:12] why not now why not this generation
[1:32:16] I'll tell you what we've done we put
[1:32:18] these things so far in the future we

[1:32:22] wouldn't have gone somebody cannot would
[1:32:24] get up and put your walking shoes on and
[1:32:26] go get it out of the future and bring it
[1:32:28] into the present
[1:32:30] that's not an invincible Army coming

[1:32:36] coming he's here there's not a real word
[1:32:38] round of cash coming she is here tonight
[1:32:41] [Applause]

[1:32:46] plain he said what Jesus said if you
[1:32:48] continue in what my word then are you my
[1:32:51] disciples indeed and ye shall know the
[1:32:54] truth somebody say the truth ye shall
[1:32:57] know the truth if there's something
[1:32:59] calling out in your soul for it brother

[1:33:11] your soul tonight crying out for
[1:33:12] something if God has become old now if
[1:33:15] God's big enough to hang the moon and
[1:33:18] the stars to create the galaxies then
[1:33:20] don't tell me he's not big enough to
[1:33:22] come into the middle of a meeting and
[1:33:24] take a two before preacher in his hand
[1:33:26] and take him off of his notes and take
[1:33:28] him out of his Direction and lead him

[1:33:55] word is the truth we've just settled
[1:33:58] what is truth the word is the truth I'm
[1:34:02] gonna preach you for a second because
[1:34:03] I'm going to say what a prophet said he
[1:34:05] said I do not come as a fanatic I do not
[1:34:07] believe in fanaticism I will not stand
[1:34:09] for it I know you don't believe in it
[1:34:11] either you believe in the truth and the
[1:34:14] truth will always speak for itself
[1:34:18] that ought to make your picture shout
[1:34:19] and choose home right there the truth
[1:34:21] will always speak for itself that's
[1:34:24] right you never have to strain truth
[1:34:27] truth will always be truth
[1:34:30] [Applause]
[1:34:31] you never have to put a strainer on the
[1:34:33] truth so you can filter things out it's
[1:34:36] really not a part of it if it is the
[1:34:38] truth it was the truth in the alpha
[1:34:40] it'll be the truth of the Omega if it
[1:34:43] was the truth in Genesis it'll be the
[1:34:45] truth in Revelation if it was the truth
[1:34:47] in 47 it'll be the truth in 65. if it is
[1:34:51] the truth in heaven it'll be the truth
[1:34:54] on the earth somebody's gonna manifest
[1:34:56] the truth
[1:34:58] I'm not crazy I'm not beside myself I'm
[1:35:01] a free man I've been freed by the truth
[1:35:03] and the truth will make you free
[1:35:07] oh yeah it's like well brother Andrew I
[1:35:09] don't know well I know what a prophet
[1:35:10] said he said tell the truth the first
[1:35:11] time you can tell it the same every time
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:16] I know we got about your Chimney Corner
[1:35:17] Store he's been hatched out and been
[1:35:19] held over people for 50 years but if
[1:35:21] it's not in the Bible and it's not in
[1:35:24] the message then you are not subject to
[1:35:26] Bow your need
[1:35:30] I know we've had a lot of doctors around
[1:35:32] us that said they knew the truth on the
[1:35:33] Deep things of the message and all they
[1:35:35] knew was enough to bind the people of
[1:35:37] God and put him into prisons and put him
[1:35:40] into concentration camps but this is the
[1:35:42] hour of Jubilee this is the hour of
[1:35:44] Liberty where the word of God will come
[1:35:46] into a church and it'll free the
[1:35:48] Believers
[1:35:50] yes sir now brother said here it is I
[1:35:52] don't want to hurt you I don't I don't
[1:35:54] want to shake you or jerk for hide from
[1:35:55] you but I wish to preach the truth
[1:35:57] that's one thing about it brother amen
[1:36:00] the truth will make you it'll never make
[1:36:02] you popular but the truth will make you
[1:36:05] honest
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:07] brother Bo the truth will never make you
[1:36:09] popular but the truth will make you
[1:36:11] honest and he said that's one good thing
[1:36:13] about it and you'd rather be honest and
[1:36:15] be popular
[1:36:17] I don't know about y'all but I ain't got
[1:36:19] nothing to lose cause I ain't nobody
[1:36:21] somebody said well he's something big
[1:36:23] have you forgot who you're talking about
[1:36:24] you're talking about a boy on the back
[1:36:26] side of the hills of East Tennessee that
[1:36:28] God called me and Sanctified me and fill
[1:36:30] me with the Holy Ghost and anything I
[1:36:33] have today is to the glory of God you
[1:36:35] know what we need to do we need to lose
[1:36:37] the fear of taking a stand for truth
[1:36:38] because of some spirit
[1:36:43] we've done we've got so powered down we
[1:36:45] can't even take a stand no more I
[1:36:47] remember I tell you where it come from
[1:36:48] it came from Ahab it did not come from
[1:36:51] Elijah because Elijah was a son of Truth
[1:36:54] and this bride is following the Elijah
[1:36:57] Malachi 4 and she is a church of Truth
[1:36:59] she will only respond to the truth
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:05] she will only respond to the truth
[1:37:08] that's why you get upset preaching ideas
[1:37:09] and you shut the church down but you
[1:37:12] start saying what a prophet said and a
[1:37:14] fire comes in and an anointing comes in
[1:37:17] and a Revival breaks out because we're
[1:37:19] Eagles and we gotta have the truth
[1:37:22] [Applause]
[1:37:24] I say give me the truth or don't give me
[1:37:26] nothing
[1:37:28] I'd rather be honest than be popular
[1:37:34] I'd rather be honest
[1:37:36] what about it young people would you
[1:37:38] rather be honest than popular yeah
[1:37:40] sometimes to live this message you got
[1:37:42] to be unpopular
[1:37:45] your word born child and you're a part
[1:37:47] of the Bride you will forfeit your
[1:37:50] rights as a lamb to be led by the dove
[1:37:53] now you say preacher you're getting
[1:37:55] pretty strong in this area I am because
[1:37:57] I happen to be living at the same time
[1:37:59] you are and it's the time when the
[1:38:02] spirit of Truth has come
[1:38:05] that's why we cannot rely Allen respond
[1:38:07] to just anything the only thing we can
[1:38:10] respond to is truth because Jesus said
[1:38:13] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[1:38:16] has come he will guide you into all
[1:38:19] truth he will not speak of himself well
[1:38:22] we might as well preach here for a
[1:38:24] second a true Holy Ghost filled preacher
[1:38:26] ain't gonna get up and take two hours to
[1:38:28] tell you how great he is
[1:38:31] man I'm here I'm also preach I told
[1:38:34] somebody today I said you know we got
[1:38:35] some preachers testify and when they get
[1:38:37] done testifying brother Danny I wonder
[1:38:39] if God was even in the building
[1:38:41] but come on now cause it's all about
[1:38:44] them and their Ministry and their but
[1:38:46] let me remind you tonight this ain't
[1:38:48] about me and it ain't about you it ain't
[1:38:50] about for the window brother Daryl
[1:38:51] brother Penn any of these preachers here
[1:38:53] tonight it's about Jesus Christ it's
[1:38:56] about entertaining the spirit of truth
[1:38:59] that has come into this generation Amen
[1:39:01] to release us from the prison house to
[1:39:03] release us from the bondage of sin when
[1:39:06] he the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:39:08] guide you into all truth he shall not
[1:39:10] speak of himself whatsoever thinks he
[1:39:13] shall hear that shall he speak notice
[1:39:15] this and he will show you things to come
[1:39:18] he rather rather Madeline he will show
[1:39:22] you things to come in other words that
[1:39:24] word come is of persons who come from
[1:39:27] one place to another in other words it's
[1:39:30] used both of the persons arriving at the
[1:39:33] same place so if you say Amen brother
[1:39:35] Andrew is going to pick me up and he's
[1:39:37] going to take me down to McDonald's well
[1:39:39] if I was at McDonald's I was in your
[1:39:41] future so I left your future come into
[1:39:44] your presence and I've picked you up and
[1:39:47] I transported you oh God I transported
[1:39:50] you from your present to your future
[1:39:52] don't you see what this message is it's
[1:39:55] your future it's not your past and it's
[1:39:59] not even your present it's your future
[1:40:01] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:40:04] will have come from your future into
[1:40:06] your present thank you
[1:40:09] and he will show you the things it is to
[1:40:12] come watch this he will come forth he
[1:40:15] will show himself he will find a place
[1:40:17] or influence then we have just
[1:40:19] identified the source of influence in
[1:40:21] the bride it's not coming from the
[1:40:23] things we're going through it's not
[1:40:25] coming from the attitude oh God it's not
[1:40:28] coming from the atmosphere of our local
[1:40:30] churches and all the problems what we're
[1:40:33] under the influence of has come from our
[1:40:36] future
[1:40:37] hey brother banish come from our future
[1:40:41] then what has happened our future has
[1:40:44] come into our presence to lead us out of
[1:40:46] our presence what are you getting that
[1:40:48] preacher the father of God said the
[1:40:50] spirit of God always comes to the word
[1:40:52] now listen if I was in your future and I
[1:40:56] come into your present and I begin to
[1:40:58] tell you things you ask me brother
[1:41:00] Andrew what was in my future I could
[1:41:02] stand there brother and I could tell you
[1:41:04] brother Joe what was in your future
[1:41:05] because I'd been there but if I'd never
[1:41:08] been there it would have been a guess
[1:41:10] about what's in your future but because
[1:41:12] I had been there I was able to record it
[1:41:14] on 1100 books and tapes and tell you
[1:41:17] what was in your future and this message
[1:41:20] is none other than the spirit of Truth
[1:41:22] which was prophesied to come into this
[1:41:25] generation and to lead you into the
[1:41:28] future home to lead you into the Rapture
[1:41:31] to lead you in the things that are to be
[1:41:33] come on Church get up off the ass Heap
[1:41:35] we're going home the spirit of Truth has
[1:41:39] come into our future to lead in goddess
[1:41:42] oh Hallelujah he said many people they
[1:41:45] open their hearts to the wrong thing you
[1:41:47] get a spirit all right but many times
[1:41:48] there's contradicts the word saying the
[1:41:50] days of Miracles just passed that did
[1:41:52] not come from your future
[1:41:54] there is no such a thing as Divine
[1:41:57] Healing that did not come from your
[1:41:58] future he said remember that's a devil
[1:42:02] pretty plain any brother Tim that's a
[1:42:04] devil under the disguisement of
[1:42:06] Christianity he said God help us when we
[1:42:09] get down here a little bit that you can
[1:42:11] see it's an evil spirit in the
[1:42:13] disguisement of Christianity but it
[1:42:15] isn't the spirit of Christ because the
[1:42:17] spirit of Christ comes to the word
[1:42:20] are you ready for this every time he
[1:42:24] cannot deny his own word see then what
[1:42:27] is the word of God the word of God is a
[1:42:28] vision and division will have a speaker
[1:42:31] which will be a preacher which the
[1:42:33] prophet of God said that word must come
[1:42:35] out of a preacher who's lining up with
[1:42:37] that word see then when the word is
[1:42:39] preached not what the preacher thinks
[1:42:41] what the preacher says when the word is
[1:42:44] preached the word identifies whether
[1:42:46] you're a Believer or not the prophet of
[1:42:49] God said they were speaking of Pharisees
[1:42:51] they were children until the word was
[1:42:54] preached but when the word was preached
[1:42:56] and Vindicated then they become Sinners
[1:42:59] for rejecting the thing that they know
[1:43:01] was right and witness we know thou art a
[1:43:04] teacher come from God no man can do
[1:43:05] these things if God was not with you so
[1:43:08] when Brotherhood says this he's
[1:43:09] admonishing preachers to stand for and
[1:43:12] with the Full Gospel I know we got a
[1:43:14] whole house full of preachers here have
[1:43:16] I got any preachers that'll say I'll
[1:43:17] stand with the Full Gospel I I'll stand
[1:43:20] with the Full Gospel I will stand with
[1:43:22] the Full Gospel and I will stand for the
[1:43:25] Full Gospel let them said then be a man
[1:43:27] who believes it to be the absolute truth
[1:43:30] that is a direct Challenge from a word
[1:43:32] Prophet if we're going to be preachers
[1:43:34] of this end time message then let's quit
[1:43:37] let things go and let things by let's be
[1:43:39] a man with this message and declare it
[1:43:42] as the absolute now I know I know that
[1:43:45] little devil runs around and says well
[1:43:46] you got to be careful if you say the
[1:43:48] message is the absolute well you may but
[1:43:50] I don't
[1:43:52] to be careful but I don't the message is
[1:43:55] the absolute I said it I meant it I stay
[1:43:59] listen look at me do I look like an
[1:44:00] idiot I know brother random was a man I
[1:44:03] know I was born of Charles Hill random I
[1:44:05] don't need to spend 20 years studying
[1:44:07] the message to identify William Branham
[1:44:09] was a fleshborn man of natural parents I
[1:44:12] know that but I'm not looking at that
[1:44:14] man because that man is a flesh man but
[1:44:17] only inside of him was the spirit of
[1:44:20] Truth
[1:44:21] and what he said was the truth and what
[1:44:24] he preached was the truth and what we
[1:44:26] say he said is the truth come on Church
[1:44:28] somebody gonna preach it and somebody
[1:44:31] gonna believe it and one of these days
[1:44:33] we're going to ride it right out of time
[1:44:35] into eternity
[1:44:37] I know what I'm talking about this
[1:44:40] message is the truth it's the absolute
[1:44:42] truth and if it's the absolute truth you
[1:44:45] ought to give everything you got to it
[1:44:47] you ought to give your family your come
[1:44:49] on Church you ought to give your career
[1:44:51] you ought to give your Wednesday nights
[1:44:53] and Sunday mornings
[1:44:57] listen what you bring identifies what
[1:44:59] you think
[1:45:00] what you bring identifies listen I don't
[1:45:03] have to ask you what you think about
[1:45:05] this message what you bring to a service
[1:45:07] identifies what you think about it if
[1:45:09] you bring an old sorry rotten attitude
[1:45:11] that identifies what you think about it
[1:45:13] if you bring an old sorry poor pity for
[1:45:15] me that identifies what you think about
[1:45:17] it but my Bible said in this bride will
[1:45:20] be the voice of gladness will be the
[1:45:22] voice of Joy she will replace the spirit
[1:45:25] of mourning and the environment of
[1:45:27] heaviness for the spirit of Praise I
[1:45:29] think it's time to bring back our praise
[1:45:32] I think it's time to bring back a
[1:45:34] sacrifice of praise under this message
[1:45:37] you say preacher I'm sacrificing I feel
[1:45:40] good tonight no you're not amen you're
[1:45:43] not sacrificed when you feel like doing
[1:45:44] it but when you don't feel like doing it
[1:45:47] and it hurts your body come on brother
[1:45:49] Bo I hope you don't mind hey man our
[1:45:51] brother stood back there and if you've
[1:45:52] seen this man split you think you ought
[1:45:54] to be in a hospital tonight ain't nobody
[1:45:56] brought a sacrifice of praise in the
[1:45:59] house of God because he identifies I
[1:46:01] didn't have to ask Bo what he thinks
[1:46:03] about this message just his being here
[1:46:05] tonight identifies what he thinks about
[1:46:07] come on Church I'd have to ask you
[1:46:10] through all the trials and all the
[1:46:12] situations you've been through what you
[1:46:14] think about this message just you're a
[1:46:16] man and your Hallelujah and you're
[1:46:18] blessing me the name of the Lord
[1:46:20] identifies what you think about the
[1:46:22] message that you're following
[1:46:24] now you didn't have to ask those main
[1:46:26] jobs what they thought whether they
[1:46:28] brought gold frankincense and myrrh
[1:46:30] which the problem of God said gold was
[1:46:32] deity frankincense was service and
[1:46:34] murder was anointing for death he said
[1:46:37] their gifts testified they believed he
[1:46:39] was the Lamb of God brother Roy to take
[1:46:42] away the sins of the world Amen and to
[1:46:44] testify he was deity in service to die
[1:46:47] oh he said if you really believe this
[1:46:50] message then you'll identify it with
[1:46:51] everything that's within you to believe
[1:46:53] it to be the truth
[1:46:56] now I know that devil might as well get
[1:46:59] out of here tonight because he's
[1:47:00] outnumbered
[1:47:02] he's outnumbered there's a pool of faith
[1:47:05] in here the word is being preached and
[1:47:08] there's a pool of Faith probably God
[1:47:10] said see now God has come in the midst
[1:47:12] of the people and their faith has drawn
[1:47:15] out Supernatural Words which is
[1:47:17] explaining to them their life of what
[1:47:19] they have done what they must do and
[1:47:22] what will be who else could do that but
[1:47:25] the spirit of Truth Shreveport 56 he
[1:47:28] said now they're pulling the people you
[1:47:30] people is the one I have not one thing
[1:47:32] to do with that it's just the gift of
[1:47:34] God see I yield myself to it and you can
[1:47:37] draw from it yourself you out there in
[1:47:39] the meetings you can sit and begin to
[1:47:41] pray to God and watch him turn right
[1:47:44] around and say something to you see
[1:47:46] it'll tell you you was praying about and
[1:47:49] what you asked for
[1:47:51] that's the power that's in these pews he
[1:47:54] didn't say brother Wendell that's the
[1:47:55] power on the poop head he said that's
[1:47:57] the power and the pews the power in this
[1:47:59] Pew tonight is the power Amen to pull on
[1:48:03] God and pull him right into your Pew and
[1:48:06] city right down next to you and tell him
[1:48:08] what you have need of oh yeah how many
[1:48:11] seen it done he said let me see your
[1:48:12] hands why see sure that's you doing that
[1:48:15] it's not me then that takes it off of
[1:48:18] who's preaching
[1:48:20] that takes it off of the preacher's
[1:48:22] personality and puts the emphasis back
[1:48:25] where it should be on the word the word
[1:48:28] is the discerner of the false and intent
[1:48:31] people say well brother so-and-so's in
[1:48:33] town I could get a miracle amen if the
[1:48:35] Holy Ghost is in town you can get a
[1:48:37] miracle
[1:48:38] brother so and so can be in town but if
[1:48:41] the Holy Ghost ain't here it's just
[1:48:43] another meeting but if the Holy Ghost
[1:48:45] will come if the supernatural will break
[1:48:47] out you'll get an answer to your
[1:48:49] question
[1:48:50] yes sir you know why because as that
[1:48:52] word Goes Forth that absolute truth that
[1:48:54] you're calling for amen what the devil
[1:48:56] don't want you to do is he does not want
[1:48:58] you to tap into the hidden power he does
[1:49:02] not want you to tap into the hidden
[1:49:04] power which will break his hold over
[1:49:06] your life come on the problem God said
[1:49:09] it's going to take the word to win the
[1:49:11] case
[1:49:12] are you with me it's gonna take the word
[1:49:14] remember first time as an attorney went
[1:49:16] down there Dr Davis boohoo cried around
[1:49:19] carried on the the older attorney come
[1:49:21] down said pitiful's job I've ever heard
[1:49:23] he said well I thought it's pretty good
[1:49:25] he said listen it's gonna take some long
[1:49:27] to win the case and the part of God I
[1:49:30] love what he says brother Wendell he
[1:49:31] says I come down here to tell you it's
[1:49:33] going to take some long to win the case
[1:49:35] because I know it's in you to be a real
[1:49:38] lawyer now think about that it was in
[1:49:42] him to be a real lawyer so somebody
[1:49:44] cared about him to tell him what was in
[1:49:46] him could be manifested come on he said
[1:49:50] it's not your emotions that's going to
[1:49:52] break the law or break the case it's
[1:49:55] going to take some law well we might as
[1:49:57] well preach we're here it's not going to
[1:49:59] take our emotions to break the
[1:50:01] atmosphere open it's going to take the
[1:50:04] word anointed with faith
[1:50:07] he is the word he is the Holy Spirit and
[1:50:11] the Holy Spirit is in us which is the
[1:50:14] word which is making the promise
[1:50:16] manifest so then the spirit quickens the
[1:50:19] word now watch this he said when that
[1:50:21] word goes out there something's got to
[1:50:24] happen he said just like David and
[1:50:26] Goliath he said when David went out
[1:50:28] there he went out there with a slingshot
[1:50:30] he said and that slingshot was f-a-i-t-h
[1:50:33] it was j-e-s-u-s it was g-r-a-c amen it
[1:50:39] was five smooth stones that David picked
[1:50:42] up to whip Goliath he said no when he
[1:50:44] went out there he said he went out there
[1:50:46] with a word the promise and the power to
[1:50:48] sling it he said that's what we need
[1:50:50] today is a man that will take God's word
[1:50:52] with the power of the Holy Ghost behind
[1:50:54] him Amen to press it out there and watch
[1:50:57] it come to pass you know what I say I
[1:50:59] say thank God for men of God that won't
[1:51:02] come out in the pulpit and start
[1:51:04] preaching and come up with a little bit
[1:51:06] of opposition and pull back and closer
[1:51:08] Bible and say come back we'll try
[1:51:10] tomorrow night but they'll stand there
[1:51:12] and they'll leave that word and delay
[1:51:14] that word though there's nobody saying
[1:51:16] amen they'll keep on laying that word
[1:51:18] because they know the word will break
[1:51:21] the atmosphere and a miracle will come
[1:51:24] into manifestation you know what we're
[1:51:26] going to do we're going to press that
[1:51:27] word out there every Devlin Hills trying
[1:51:30] to stop us right now but we're going to
[1:51:31] press it out for anyhow because we have
[1:51:34] been anointed
[1:51:37] hey y'all know what's happening right
[1:51:39] now I'm pressing out there and you're
[1:51:41] pulling
[1:51:42] I'm pressing out there and you're
[1:51:44] pulling and then you're pushing back and
[1:51:47] I'm pulling you hear what's happening
[1:51:48] we're working together not to cut along
[1:51:51] but to cut the devil's head off
[1:51:55] we're working together not to cut along
[1:51:57] but to cut that niggle's head off and
[1:52:01] bring a liberty
[1:52:03] well now that's God's Army that's God's
[1:52:07] Army his word of fire is all dressed his
[1:52:10] army with the ever presence of himself
[1:52:13] in there he's going with us
[1:52:16] how many say thank God
[1:52:18] for the absolute truth
[1:52:20] preached
[1:52:24] thank God
[1:52:26] for the absolute truth
[1:52:28] preached
[1:52:29] sometimes it hurts but thank God
[1:52:34] sometimes it cuts to the Bone but thank
[1:52:37] God
[1:52:38] sometimes it steps on our toes but thank
[1:52:41] God
[1:52:43] now now if you look here you I'm moving
[1:52:46] along very quickly I pray I have just a
[1:52:48] few more minutes because that word's got
[1:52:50] to come forward somebody say come forth
[1:52:52] now when I what I found amazing is in
[1:52:54] Revelation one when you get time to read
[1:52:56] it John will actually write about to
[1:52:58] patna's Vision y'all familiar with it
[1:52:59] and in that patmosphere he will actually
[1:53:02] reveal to you or describe what he saw in
[1:53:05] the Sevenfold personage of Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] and I want to say this to you I want to
[1:53:10] I want to show you two two folds of that
[1:53:12] personage the fourth one was his voice
[1:53:15] was as the sound of many Waters his
[1:53:18] voice was as the sound of multitude
[1:53:20] speaking what is it it's the Judgment
[1:53:23] for these are the voices of the
[1:53:25] multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy
[1:53:28] Spirit All Through the Ages have
[1:53:30] testified to Christ and preached its
[1:53:33] gospel it will be the voice of every man
[1:53:35] rising in judgment Against The Sinner
[1:53:37] who would not take the warning now watch
[1:53:39] this the voice of the seven Messengers
[1:53:42] will be heard loud and clear so don't
[1:53:45] don't tell me that the voice of the
[1:53:46] seventh angel will lose its influence
[1:53:48] the voice of the seventh angel will be
[1:53:50] heard and it will be heard loud and
[1:53:53] clear but don't stop there read the rest
[1:53:56] of the quote he said and those faithful
[1:53:58] preachers who preach the saving power of
[1:54:01] Jesus who preach the water baptism who
[1:54:04] preached the power of the Holy Ghost who
[1:54:06] stood with the word brother Matt more
[1:54:08] than they stood with their own lives he
[1:54:11] said they will be heard because the
[1:54:13] voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost
[1:54:16] was in them you know what I say to you
[1:54:19] men of God we thank you for preaching
[1:54:21] the word of God
[1:54:22] [Applause]
[1:54:24] the word will stand against the enemy
[1:54:27] but exactly like it is on the day of
[1:54:30] judgment he said when the Roar of
[1:54:31] multitudes condemns you for not having
[1:54:33] paid heat air it was too late he said
[1:54:35] take heed this very hour he said listen
[1:54:37] to his voice it's the voice of his
[1:54:39] servants as it calls to repentance in
[1:54:43] life so as the word is going forth It's
[1:54:46] a calling word it's a summoning word
[1:54:48] it's a beckoning word it's a drawing
[1:54:51] word the word is calling you to come up
[1:54:54] higher Revelation 4 1 the word is
[1:54:57] calling you to come up higher he said
[1:54:59] the voice of his servants as it calls to
[1:55:02] repentance in life so when the pull of
[1:55:04] faith comes in the building I'm going
[1:55:06] somewhere when the pull of faith comes
[1:55:08] in the building amen the word will be
[1:55:11] preached and you will pull on that word
[1:55:13] and the voice of God will come out of
[1:55:16] that man of God as he preaches that word
[1:55:20] now can I can I go a step further then
[1:55:24] the six-fold amen description of this
[1:55:26] personage was that there amen was a
[1:55:29] two-edged sword the six-fold description
[1:55:32] was there was a two-edged sword the
[1:55:35] fourth fold was a voice rather being the
[1:55:38] six-fold was a two-edged sword oh God
[1:55:42] the power of your pull is connected to a
[1:55:46] voice which a prophet connected to a
[1:55:48] sword you know what he said he said I
[1:55:50] was up in the mountains of Sabino Canyon
[1:55:52] and there I was praying and he said
[1:55:55] while I was praying he said a sword
[1:55:57] struck my hand he said a sword struck my
[1:56:01] hand now y'all say the message you know
[1:56:03] when he was up there praying he was
[1:56:05] believing it was his end he was saying
[1:56:07] God take care of my wife and babies this
[1:56:09] is my end he said but then a voice said
[1:56:12] it's not your end it's only your
[1:56:14] beginning
[1:56:16] it's your ministry it's the third pool
[1:56:19] oh God are you hearing me did you hear
[1:56:22] my title The Power of your pool you
[1:56:26] thought I was talking about your voice
[1:56:27] you thought I was talking about how loud
[1:56:29] you can scream I'm talking about the
[1:56:31] pool that you're under
[1:56:34] it's the power of your pool come on

[1:56:48] opening of the word which was the
[1:56:50] revealing of the son of man which was
[1:56:53] the manifestation of the presence of
[1:56:55] Jesus Christ
[1:56:58] I wish I was out in the field right now
[1:56:59] I'd cut up are you hearing me Church the
[1:57:02] voice of the third pull it's not in a
[1:57:05] tomb and Jefferson meal it's not in a
[1:57:07] grave in Jerusalem but for boys of the
[1:57:10] third Pool isn't Hardy Arkansas tonight

[1:57:21] third pose in me that's why the devil
[1:57:23] don't want you to lay minutes because
[1:57:25] the third pulls in you but somebody's
[1:57:27] gonna preach it and somebody's gonna
[1:57:29] amen it and somebody is gonna pick up
[1:57:32] the sword

[2:01:49] is it it's in you
[2:01:51] it's in your pool
[2:01:53] I said it's in your pool oh God I wish I
[2:01:56] was a preacher right now it's in your
[2:01:58] pool it's in your pool it was in the
[2:02:01] first pool that Hattie got him two boys
[2:02:03] but in the third pool she got her two
[2:02:06] boys in the third pool the tumor let's
[2:02:09] meet his body in the third pool the fish
[2:02:12] come back alive in the third pool a
[2:02:14] prophet went beyond the curtain of time
[2:02:16] in the third pole he opened your future
[2:02:22] well I feel I feel like praising God
[2:02:25] it's my pool I'm gonna enjoy it
[2:02:30] brother when I'm gonna enjoy it I'm
[2:02:32] gonna preach it I'm gonna amen it and
[2:02:34] I'm gonna manifest it
[2:02:37] yeah
[2:02:38] brother Carter I met people I've met
[2:02:40] people they're smart enough to no let me
[2:02:42] say this
[2:02:43] they're uneducated enough
[2:02:46] to say they'd be where they are without
[2:02:47] a prophet
[2:02:49] wow
[2:02:50] now y'all just got to forgive me but
[2:02:53] again
[2:02:54] it's not a very smart statement
[2:02:57] because I tell you what you should be
[2:02:58] without a prophet you'd be you'd been
[2:02:59] confused Babylonian
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:06] you'd be a confused Pentecostal
[2:03:09] but God deposited a profit into your
[2:03:12] bank account
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:16] God deposited to Malachi 4 into your
[2:03:20] bank account God deposited Luke 17 30
[2:03:24] into your bank accounts God deposited
[2:03:27] John 14 12 into your bank account God
[2:03:30] deposited Mark 16 into your bank account
[2:03:33] God deposited to Revelation 5 into your
[2:03:36] bank account he deposited Revelation 10
[2:03:39] into your bank account he deposited
[2:03:41] revelation 22 into your
[2:03:46] he deposited to Revelation 18 into your
[2:03:49] bank account and somebody's going to
[2:03:52] draw from it brother being somebody's
[2:03:54] going to pull from it somebody is going
[2:03:56] to draw the cash dividends
[2:04:00] well I'd be where I'm at without a
[2:04:02] prophet no you wouldn't you'd be a
[2:04:04] blindly out of sin on your way to hell
[2:04:07] but God rich and mercy allowed a profit
[2:04:11] to come across your path and open your
[2:04:14] eyes to see that what he said his word
[2:04:16] is is what he always will be
[2:04:19] I'm going to show it to you because you
[2:04:21] wouldn't be where you are without a
[2:04:22] prophet
[2:04:23] I know there's a lot of preachers
[2:04:25] running around and they get a few little
[2:04:27] services and a good little education
[2:04:28] about the message and they think they
[2:04:30] can go beyond the profit well listen
[2:04:31] here buddy it won't be long and you'll
[2:04:33] be wrecked up on the side of the road
[2:04:36] and any church that lays aside what a
[2:04:39] prophet told will become a meaningless
[2:04:41] Gathering of people
[2:04:44] but if a prophet is in the church they
[2:04:46] say by the end of the Prophet stand how
[2:04:48] dare you say the Holy Ghost is dead
[2:04:50] brother Dale the Holy Ghost is not dead
[2:04:53] you know why because the prophet said
[2:04:55] the prophet is the Holy Ghost then pray
[2:04:58] tell me Church who is the spirit of
[2:05:00] Truth who is the seventh angel anointing
[2:05:04] it's coming from the spirit of God
[2:05:09] now you say preach you're getting out
[2:05:11] there well actually I'm not because
[2:05:12] under this message I'm close with this
[2:05:14] point under this message
[2:05:16] I feel like it under this message there
[2:05:20] was a faith that was activated
[2:05:24] under this message brother ram calls it
[2:05:26] a living faith he directly connects Jude
[2:05:29] 1 3 which says I contend for the faith
[2:05:31] of Jesus Christ rather Seth he directly
[2:05:34] connects that Amen to to a living faith
[2:05:37] and says the faith of Jesus Christ the
[2:05:40] son of God is a living faith he said
[2:05:43] that my gift is given to stimulate Faith
[2:05:45] you know what faith was made to do Faith
[2:05:48] was made to increase
[2:05:49] Faith was made to grow Faith was made to
[2:05:53] expand come on church I know the Bible
[2:05:55] says Brother David I know the Bible says
[2:05:57] that Faith the size of a grain of a
[2:06:00] mustard seed we'll move them out I know
[2:06:01] that brother Josh you know that amen but
[2:06:04] let's go a step further God did not
[2:06:06] intend for our faith to remain in a
[2:06:09] mustard seed size if he did he would
[2:06:12] have never sent Malachi 4 if he did he
[2:06:15] would have never opened your eyes to the
[2:06:17] quickening power of Romans 8 chapter and
[2:06:19] the 11th verse that if the same spirit
[2:06:22] that raised Jesus from the dead will
[2:06:24] dwell in your body he will also Quicken
[2:06:26] your Immortal body
[2:06:28] church God sent the Holy Ghost brother
[2:06:30] Harvey to increase your faith now not
[2:06:34] one time it was insane form at one time
[2:06:37] it was in mustard grain Farm but now
[2:06:40] it's growing
[2:06:42] let me prove it to you from the Bible
[2:06:43] Luke 17 the Apostle said Lord increase
[2:06:46] our faith brother random changes the
[2:06:48] word increase to stimulate and says this
[2:06:50] stimulate the faith of the people that
[2:06:53] they might see God's willingness to heal
[2:06:55] them see because there will be a church
[2:06:57] that will be a great church and it will
[2:07:00] be full of faith God sent these things
[2:07:02] down to stimulate Faith to bring out
[2:07:05] Faith to prove what faith is why so
[2:07:09] faith can operate y'all agree with me
[2:07:11] right now Faith is operating while I'm
[2:07:14] preaching
[2:07:14] [Applause]
[2:07:16] brother faith is operating right now
[2:07:18] while I'm preaching in this building
[2:07:20] faith is working I'm not laying my hands
[2:07:23] on you brother Daryl but faith is I'm
[2:07:25] not playing
[2:07:27] I know it's the first night and I gotta
[2:07:29] I gotta get this horse in the barn but
[2:07:31] listen to me Faith is operating
[2:07:33] faith is at work faith is working faith
[2:07:37] is moving listen church this is not a
[2:07:40] feeling meeting this is a faith-based
[2:07:42] meeting this is not a personality
[2:07:44] meeting this is a faith-based mean this
[2:07:46] is a meeting we're so oh God gotta go
[2:07:49] ahead and preaching when we got some
[2:07:50] local pastors that's been labored in
[2:07:52] their churches and we've got a place to
[2:07:54] come this weekend and join our faith
[2:07:56] together and let Faith arise and the
[2:07:59] enemies of God be scattered
[2:08:03] this is a body move but the faith of
[2:08:06] Jesus Christ the faith that was dead has
[2:08:09] been resurrected
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:12] now I'm gonna close with this and you
[2:08:16] are in position to pull
[2:08:20] you weren't before a Prophet come
[2:08:24] you say well preacher bless God I knew
[2:08:27] how to pull I pulled Pentecost then how
[2:08:29] come you went home said you had a good
[2:08:31] sermon and the preacher didn't even get
[2:08:32] to preach
[2:08:33] foreign
[2:08:38] s you put on the music but you didn't
[2:08:41] pull on the word because you cannot know
[2:08:43] how to put on the word unless a prophet
[2:08:46] positionally places you and gives you
[2:08:48] the ability by the spirit of God to pull
[2:08:51] on that word listen without this Prophet
[2:08:54] you're going to keep passion through
[2:08:55] prayer lines
[2:08:57] come on Church Without this Prophet
[2:09:00] you're going to keep making routine
[2:09:01] trips to the altar but with the prophet
[2:09:04] he is not just bringing you to the altar
[2:09:06] he's not just bringing you through a
[2:09:08] prayer line but he's positionally
[2:09:10] placing you under a Joshua anointing to
[2:09:13] pull on the Unseen God
[2:09:16] let me prove it to you in the when the
[2:09:19] problem of God said to these diseases
[2:09:20] and affliction is 1950 he said there I
[2:09:23] was first meeting Miami Florida I
[2:09:24] promise I'm closing it first meet Miami
[2:09:27] Florida he said he was having a fast
[2:09:29] line brother Daryl you prayed probably
[2:09:30] thousands of them amen fast lines he
[2:09:33] said now there were thousands there to
[2:09:34] be prayed for he said but while I was
[2:09:37] praying he said there was one little
[2:09:38] girl come through one little girl
[2:09:41] one little girl there was one little
[2:09:44] girl
[2:09:47] there was one little girl come through
[2:09:49] he said and I noticed she had a tooth
[2:09:52] missing she had braces around her hip
[2:09:54] and she had braces down her legs he said
[2:09:56] when she comes through brother man he
[2:09:58] said I she caught my attention he said
[2:10:01] when I looked at her I said little sis
[2:10:03] God bless you may the Lord Jesus heal
[2:10:05] you and she walked on through with the
[2:10:06] braces he said a few minutes later here
[2:10:09] come little girl back around same little
[2:10:11] girl he said I realized she didn't have
[2:10:13] no faith
[2:10:15] little girl didn't have no faith he said
[2:10:17] I realized she didn't have no faith he
[2:10:19] said so what I've done brother Tim was I
[2:10:22] pulled her out of the prayer line and I
[2:10:24] positionally placed her behind me
[2:10:27] he said oh God I put her behind me
[2:10:29] brother Wesley he said and I told her
[2:10:31] you take your hand and you hold the hymn
[2:10:34] of my coat and you stand there and you
[2:10:37] pull on the Hem of my coat he said and
[2:10:39] while you're pulling he said pray he
[2:10:42] said you help me pray for these sick
[2:10:44] people rather being she didn't have no
[2:10:46] faith for herself how's she going to
[2:10:48] help a prophet pray for sick people but
[2:10:51] a prophet who was anointed with the
[2:10:53] spirit of Truth he knew what was in her
[2:10:55] future
[2:10:57] oh God he knew what was in her future he
[2:11:01] knew what was in her future so he took
[2:11:03] the time and the preparation years and
[2:11:05] he positionally placed her
[2:11:09] and he said they would come through I'd
[2:11:11] say Lord Jesus and I'd feel her Heavenly
[2:11:14] Father Heavenly Father I'd feel her he
[2:11:16] said every now and again brother Jeff I
[2:11:18] turn around I tell you still praying she
[2:11:20] stay still praying he said all of a
[2:11:22] sudden I felt it he said all of a sudden
[2:11:24] I felt it pump pump he said up up up he
[2:11:29] said my faith okay
[2:11:31] he said as her faith raised he said my
[2:11:34] faith turned to a perfect Faith he said
[2:11:37] I realized she knew it was hers he said
[2:11:39] I turned around I said little sis you
[2:11:42] believe now don't you she said oh yes I
[2:11:44] do he said take off him crutches and you
[2:11:47] go walk
[2:11:48] you go walk in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:11:52] brother Her Mama come over there and
[2:11:55] said don't you do it he said if she's
[2:11:56] ever gonna walk she's gonna walk right

[2:12:44] when a prophet placed you
[2:12:46] and a prophet taught you how to pull

[2:14:56] Psalms 34 6.
