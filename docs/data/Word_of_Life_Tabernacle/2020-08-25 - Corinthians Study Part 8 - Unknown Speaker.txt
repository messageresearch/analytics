========================================

hello and welcome to our uh study on first corinthians uh once again we're going to start or continue with chapter three and we'll be starting today um we'll be starting today with first 10. so we'll continue with that today and i'll give you just a minute to get on and then we'll have a word of prayer there's a couple of special requests we want to be remembering today and we've got just to go back over some of what we had said in in chapter 2 or chapter 3 rather um i actually have the wrong review data on there but uh we the information is correct spiritual versus carnal uh we found out that there was a difference between how you could teach someone who was spiritual versus someone who was carnal we also found out that the corinthian church was carnal in word thought and deed so that there was remember envying strife and divisions among them it says are you not carnal and walk as men as carnal and word in envying strife thought and deed and division so he says are you not carnal and walk as men i found out that paul and apollos were ministers and that come from the word servant and it meant that they were as jesus put an unprofitable servants in other words you do just what is your duty to do you don't do something just because for any glory or you don't get any of the benefits from it you do it and that's what god called you to do it's committed to you to do that you're a steward there is rewards for it but it's in another place on the other side and so he says you're carnal because you say you're of paul or apollos we also found out that we're god's building so whoever god uses to build us with we are god's building the building never belongs to the workmen the building belongs to god and we are the ones who work on god's building and so we should treat the people like that so we're going to begin today with first corinthians 3 10 and before we do let's have a word of prayer i want to remember a sister in our church sister mary who has a surgery today on her hand and outpatient surgery she'll be remembering her and each one that's sick or in need and the situation with the coronavirus and of course our nation uh going through the time that it is and knowing that we're in the end times but we want to pray one for another and and have the right attitude towards one another let's pray heavenly father thank you for bringing us lord to this place today lord and i don't know who will watch and or who will listen but lord i pray that each one that does will be blessed father we pray that our efforts would the lord be fruitful or we know that your word does not go forth void so we ask you to come and just bless us today and and bless sister mary in this surgery i pray that you'd give her strength and each one dealing with the chronovirus situations and different things lord we know that you're still god and you still have control over everything so we thank you for all that you do and we ask you to bless what we do today in our bible study in jesus name amen so first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 10 says according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder and if you underline in your bible you can underline that master builder he says i am a wise master builder we talked about the other day in church about what it meant to be wise and how that god intends for us to use our brains but he says a wise master builder he said i've laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon in other words make sure that it matches the idea of what i had in the first place let's make sure that if the first builder was a master builder let's make sure that we follow his pattern so that word master builder is literally an architect and it's a good way to think about paul as the architect of what we believe when it comes to the doctrines of grace that's paul now he got those plans from somewhere he got that ability to build from somewhere where does he get it from he gets it by revelation from god so we don't lightly move away from the things that paul taught us because these are the very foundations of our faith this is what we believe is what paul wrote in the scriptures is what we believe because he was a master builder and he called himself that not to give himself glory because he says by grace that i'm a master builder so the word is architect on which work which is where we get our word architect and it would be a superintendent in the in the erection of buildings so uh wesley puts it this way he said according to the grace of god given to me this he promises lest he should seem to ascribe it to himself let everyone take heed how he buildeth thereon that all his doctrines may be consistent with the foundation that's very important even today we look at the message of the hour our doctrine what we believe has to be consistent with the foundation it's got to fit the pattern that's already been laid and you'll find that in the old testament when moses made a pattern or had a pattern he was shown by god a pattern for the tabernacle in the wilderness which would be a type of the temple but today we're temples we'll find in just a moment so there's a pattern for our lives for our doctrine for how we conduct ourselves and so god had a a tabernacle in heaven and he showed the pattern of that to moses and moses built according to that pattern here on the earth so in exodus 25 9 he says according to all that i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it make it like this he says don't deviate from it don't change it keep it like the pattern in first chronicles 21 28 19 you find where david also received a pattern and he gave it to solomon so he it's like he draws these blueprints and he gives them to solomon he says now i'm the architect i'm the master builder and i'm giving this to you to follow uh the foundation that i've laid and and david said the all this the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern even to how much the vessels of gold would weigh in the temple why is that because god cares about the details and god cares about the details of what we believe god cares about doctrine god cares about conduct god cares about these things and so these are things that we can't change we don't get to change and i've used the illustration often we don't get to change male to female we don't get to just because we decide that it doesn't matter say that it doesn't matter if uh if you do certain things before you get married or not it doesn't matter if you do things outside the marriage covenant it does matter because we don't get to change the pattern it matters because god set it in motion that way and you find when people go according to the pattern that their conduct is is better and when their conduct is better their lives are better that they have peace and happiness and joy because they followed the pattern of god and when you follow the pattern that's when god anoints and god moves as he did in the temple when solomon built it now brother branham calls paul a pattern and i'm kind of digressing here but we're not going to do that very much through the rest of this to save time but paul says internet or brother branham says rather that paul is a pattern for the rest of the church ages and this is in the ephesian church age he said his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future messengers were set to aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of god is this showing up there this one okay actually that's the pattern for every true minister of god i've got peter here with me he said though he would not attain to such heights in the prophetic realm as did paul so these other men these other messengers would not attain to the heights of the prophetic realm of course until the last age as did paul but paul's ministry had a threefold quality that each one of these ministries would have let's see what that was and you can go in the efficient church age and look this up but the random elaborates on these but these are the qualities he said that paul had in that pattern he said paul was absolutely true to the word and that's the first thing that you'll find in any true messenger today and any true minister that they will be absolutely true to the word and number two his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word so it won't just come in teaching only but in the power and demonstration of the spirit not in letter only because the letter kills but spirit gives life and then number three he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry this is important someone tells you well i'm i have a ministry i have a special revelation for from god for the people where's the fruit of your ministry because this is the pattern that paul said paul said i don't need letters of recommendation he said you're my letters of recommendation your written epistles read of all men and so any any god called ministry will have results it may not be in great numbers but it'll be in the lives of the people that he preaches to so this is the pattern that was set for us and this will be the pattern that we have to follow let's look at verse 11 first corinthians 3 11. he says now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver i'm sorry let's back up to verse 11. for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is jesus christ we can't lay a foundation other than the one that is laid matthew henry said it this way about this and i really like this he said the doctrine of our savior and his mediation is the principled doctrine of christianity it lies at the bottom and is the foundation of all the rest he said if you leave out this you lay waste all our comforts and leave no foundation for our hopes as sinners it is in christ only that god is reconciling a sinful world to himself and remember that he is the foundation paul says no other foundation can any man lay than what i've laid and that foundation is jesus christ he is the principle theme of the scripture and he is the one who has the preeminence so when you have a doctrine or a teaching that devalues christ that devalues jesus that devalues his work and what he did and what he does and what he continues to do then you have a problem because it doesn't build on the foundation it says it is in christ only that god reconciles a sinful world to himself verse 12 i kind of got ahead of myself a minute ago but now we'll go to verse 12. he said now if any men build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble and you'll notice he goes in descending order gold first silver precious stones would a stubble he said that's descending order of value he says every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it so let's stop there on verse 12. i keep getting ahead of myself i feel like i'm taking too much time on this because we're going to go through the end of the chapter but let's just stop for a minute what john wesley said if anyone build gold silver costly stones he said three sorts of materials which will bear the fire and notice that the gold silver and costly stones are three different types of ministries but they all build something that'll last that's important because it won't all be the same but it's something that'll last those are true and solid doctrines would hay and stubble are three that will not bear the fire and again they're different types of ministries but they won't bear the fire such are doctrines ceremonies and forms of human invention all but the substantial vital truths of christianity was john wesley so verse 13 every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sword it is whether it's wood hay stubble or gold silver or precious stones he says the day shall declare it that's why he says judge nothing before the time as i've been reminding myself lately verse 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward we all want a reward don't we for the things that we've been given we all want a reward for the work that or the work rather that we've done but if your work abides you'll receive a reward but if any man's work should be burned he shall suffer loss so but he himself should be saved yet so as by fire this is verse 15. so he can be pulled like a brand from the fire can be plucked from the fire himself but his work will be lost what a sad thing that is verse 16 now paul kind of changes here and yet stays in the same vein that there are people who will build on the foundation but they don't build correctly because they don't live correctly so there's people who will build on the foundation there's those who will build on the foundation and they build incorrectly because they build with false doctrine then there's those who build on the foundation that build incorrectly because they don't live right and so that's who he's dealing with here and he'll be dealing with an issue with immorality in the corinthian church because that was the culture that they come out of and i think more and more as as ministers of the gospel today that we're going to be dealing with with issues of immorality in the church and issues of immorality because that's the culture that's out there it's an immoral culture and you see it creeping into the church on every level we have to deal with that we have to deal with the very real issues of immorality so paul deals with that and he says know you not that you are the temple of god that the spirit of god dwelleth in you so this is the pattern that god has set he wants you to live a certain way he says if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple you are so here's a man a man who builds with wood or hay or stubble he can be saved but here's a man who defiles the temple of god as in him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple you are and so he says let no man deceive himself who can deceive you the most well it'd be somebody close to you somebody that you trust but who can who can really deceive you yourself your own heart is more deceitful than anything else and so we have to check even our own feelings and our own desires by the word let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise let him become a fool let him unlearn everything he's learned like moses did like paul did that he may be wise the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god when we went through that he said for it is written he taketh the wise and their own craftiness and this comes from job chapter 5 and verse 13 which says he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the forward is carried headlong we taketh the wise in our own craftiness in other words he lets them think that they know what they're doing and they know what they're doing and even their own wisdom turns in to folly and they actually become greater sinners because of their wisdom than they would have been otherwise and i've seen that many times he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and so first corinthians 3 and 20 he says again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain and this comes from psalms 94 11 which says the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity so don't trust in your own thoughts because your own thoughts will lead you wrong trust in the word of god always follow the pattern so he says therefore because all the thoughts of man are vanity because men deceive themselves because men defile the temple of god let no man glory in men for all things are yours and this is again paul and you can see just the very seeds of this nicolet in the spirit that's going to come into the church a couple hundred years later after this you can see the seeds of it beginning in that first church because these men they said i'm a paul i'm a apollos i belong to this church i belong to this man he says let no man glory in men for all things are yours who do they belong to they belong to the bride they belong to the church of god and so he says all things are yours verse 22 whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world so paul apollos peter all these things are yours they're given for you they're they're not for the benefit of the men they're for the benefit for your benefit so he says paul apollo cephas the world life death things present things to come all are yours what a what a powerful thing that is they're all yours they belong to you they weren't put here for their own glory they weren't put here to so that they could have something to eat or something to wear or a place to live no they were put here for you and then you honor them and you respect them and you give them of the tithing and the different things that they deserve but but these things are for you they're not there for themselves they're ministers he says all things are yours brother branham deals with this and god providing healing for this generation and i love this quote he says he says when you become a christian walk around find out what you own what's yours that's what we want to do we want to find out what's ours that's why we study the scriptures he said all things are yours given to you freely everything that christ died for is yours every one of you you've got a checkbook with jesus name signed across there and saying whatever you send this check to the father whatever you ask the father in my name that i'll do so he's given you a checkbook with jesus name signed across there and all you have to do is fill it out and that's what paul is saying when he's saying all things are yours these things were given for you fill it out use that gift if you have a pastor use the gift of a pastor if you have an evangelist use the gift of an evangelist if you have a a person with a gift of healing or whatever that it is use those gifts because all things are yours and you are christ verse 23 and christ is god's you belong to you belong to christ all things are yours but you belong to christ that means something and the greater than solomon is here brother branham says this and i'll close with this this closes out this third chapter which was such an important chapter in the book of first corinthians to set the stage for what comes later as paul gets stronger and stronger in this book he says i think that the pentecostal people as many things as god has sent you and yet our church is set half empty the pastor can't do it himself the laity has got to help in this remember he says all things are yours what does that do it gives you responsibility as well the laity has got to help in this we're all a partner he said that's what started the chaos at the first time at the nicea council they wanted when the doctrine of the nicolaitans niko means to conquer laity means to take away from the laity and make a holy man he said that's not a holy man holy heal it's a holy god a holy god amongst people the laity has part of it we are children there's no great ones among us how can you have faith when you desire respects one from another we're all one in christ jesus there's no big men and little men he says we're all the same we're children of one father were his children what did paul say you're christ's you don't belong to paul you don't belong to apollos you don't belong to peter you belong to christ where children of one father were his children that's what i want to leave you with today you belong to god if you belong to god then you can write a check for what you have need of and i know there's needs very real needs out there today and we're going to pray again but whatever you have need of just just hold that in your heart today i belong to god if i belong to god god has sent men god has sent gifts into the church to help me and i'm going to take advantage of that and i have a checkbook myself i can go in prayer to god and ask him for the things that i have need of and he'll give it to me isn't our god good to us all things are yours don't wait for some great man to come along you belong to christ and all things are yours let's pray heavenly father we thank you for all that you do for us thank you for this word here today which as i rushed through it but it helped me lord as i began to see some of these things and i pray god that you would just speak to us today and lord we thank you for what you've done thank you for healing lord these requests that we prayed over earlier i pray you continue to bless them and the different ones going into surgery and things i pray god that you would guide the surgeon's knife that you'd make it exactly the way you'd want it to be heal them completely lord i pray that you'd give us strength to overcome in all of the areas of our life we pray in jesus name amen god bless you thank you for watching
