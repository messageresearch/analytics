[37:57] reigns. Oh yes, I'm
[38:01] walking with Jesus.
[38:04] I'm a child
[38:06] of the King. Oh, and it's all
[38:12] because I
[38:14] am
[38:16] redeemed. Can you testify with me now?
[38:19] Oh, yes, I
[38:22] am redeemed. Yes, I am. I'm bought
[38:27] with a price.
[38:30] Oh yes,
[38:32] Jesus has changed my whole
[38:38] life.
[38:40] Well, if
[38:43] anybody ever asked
[38:45] you, oh just
[38:48] who I am, won't you tell
[38:53] them that I
[38:56] am redeemed? Can we try that second
[38:59] verse again?
[39:00] Oh, will I'll tell
[39:04] of his
[39:06] favor and I'll tell
[39:09] of his
[39:11] love and I'll tell
[39:14] of his
[39:17] goodness to me.
[39:22] You know he purchased
[39:25] my
[39:27] redemption with his
[39:30] own precious
[39:32] blood. Oh and from
[39:35] sin. Oh I am. Are you free tonight
[39:39] church? Then let's sing with all our
[39:41] hearts
[39:42] now. Oh yes I
[39:46] am redeemed.
[39:49] I've been bought
[39:51] with the
[39:53] price. Lord
[39:56] Jesus, you change
[40:00] my whole
[40:04] life. Well, if
[40:06] [Music]
[40:08] anybody asks
[40:10] you just
[40:12] to I am. Oh, why don't you tell
[40:18] them? Oh, I
[40:21] am
[40:24] redeemed. Aren't you glad to be redeemed
[40:26] tonight? Let's bow our heads together.
[40:28] Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful to be
[40:30] in your house tonight on a stormy night,
[40:33] Lord, and many couldn't make it, but
[40:35] Lord, we know you're here. You said
[40:37] we're two or three. We're gathered
[40:39] together in in thy name, Lord, that you
[40:42] would be here. And so we're gathered,
[40:44] Lord, and we're gathered in your name
[40:46] under a commandment given by you. And I
[40:49] thank you, Lord, for meeting us here.
[40:51] Pray you'd meet every need, Lord.
[40:52] Whatever it is that we have. I don't
[40:55] know what the needs might be, but you
[40:56] know, Lord, and I pray you would meet
[40:58] those needs tonight. Speak directly to
[41:00] each and every heart. We pray in Jesus'
[41:03] name.
[41:05] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord
[41:10] Jesus. Amen.
[41:13] Genesis chapter 49 verse14. Let's go
[41:16] right into the word tonight and it's uh
[41:18] brother Stewart and brother Malachi got
[41:20] will be here on Sunday. Brother Stewart
[41:22] on Sunday morning and Malachi on Sunday
[41:24] afternoon. So I'm sure you're looking
[41:26] forward to that and you'll get a little
[41:28] break from from me and and Joel for a
[41:30] weekend, but I'll be back for next
[41:32] Wednesday. My niece is getting married,
[41:34] so we're looking forward to that. And
[41:36] they grow up so quick. It just seems
[41:38] like they're born and then the next day
[41:40] they're getting married. I watch all
[41:41] these kids growing up in the church. And
[41:43] we sure love our our young people, don't
[41:45] we? And such a privilege for me to see
[41:48] them in the altar, many of them, on
[41:50] Sunday night, and it just they have a
[41:52] heart for the Lord, and they want to do
[41:53] the right thing. And and so sincere in
[41:56] their approach to God, and I I just want
[41:58] us all to be that way. I I want to be
[42:00] more that way. And and he said, "Except
[42:03] you come as a little child, you'll never
[42:05] be able to receive the kingdom of God."
[42:07] So, I'm thankful I'm thankful we can do
[42:10] that tonight. I'm thankful for our
[42:11] children and but we'll be gone for this
[42:13] weekend but we'll be back on Wednesday.
[42:16] And Genesis 49:14 Issachar is a strong
[42:20] ass couching down between two burdens.
[42:25] And he saw that rest was good and the
[42:28] and the land that it was pleasant and
[42:30] bowed his shoulder to bear and became a
[42:33] servant unto tribute. Amen. I pray the
[42:36] Lord that his blessing to the word. You
[42:38] may be seated.
[42:40] I don't often uh get away with reading
[42:42] poetry in a sermon, but if you would uh
[42:45] indulge me tonight on a Wednesday night,
[42:47] I couldn't get away from this one by
[42:49] Robert Service uh called The Ordinary
[42:52] Man. He said, "If you and I should
[42:54] chance to meet, I guess you wouldn't
[42:55] care. I'm sure you'd pass me in the
[42:57] street as if I wasn't there. You never
[43:00] look me in the face, my modest mug to
[43:02] scan, because I'm just a commonplace and
[43:05] ordinary man." But then it may be you
[43:07] are too a guy of every day who does the
[43:10] job he's told to do and takes the wife
[43:12] his pay who makes a home and kids his
[43:15] care, works with pick or pin. He said,
[43:17] "Why pal? I guess we're just a pair of
[43:19] ordinary men. We plug away and make no
[43:22] fuss. Our feets are never crowned. And
[43:24] yet it's common coes like us who made
[43:26] the world go round." And as we steer a
[43:29] steady course by God's predestined plan,
[43:32] hats off to that almighty force.
[43:34] Ordinary man. I think when Jesus was
[43:37] here, he was seen as an ordinary man. He
[43:40] was not seen. Brother Brandon said he
[43:42] didn't look like a leader. The Bible
[43:43] says there's no beauty. We would desire
[43:46] him when when he come to the Jordan to
[43:50] be baptized by John. John saw an
[43:52] ordinary man come to the Jordan. But
[43:55] when he saw the spirit rest on him, he
[43:57] knew there was something extraordinary
[43:59] about this ordinary man. And it's by the
[44:02] spirit of God today that our lives can
[44:04] be extraordinary lives because of the
[44:07] spirit of God resting on us. And so he
[44:09] cried out, "Behold the lamb of God."
[44:11] Because he saw the spirit of God rest
[44:14] upon him. We know that the woman at the
[44:16] well saw an ordinary man come to the
[44:18] well and then sit by the well. And yet
[44:22] when he began to reveal the secrets of
[44:24] her heart, she realized that he was more
[44:26] than an ordinary man. We find Zakius
[44:29] when he was in the tree, he saw an
[44:32] ordinary man come by his tree. But yet
[44:35] uh when he when he looked up in the tree
[44:37] and he said told him who he was, what
[44:39] his name was said, I'm going to eat with
[44:41] you today. Zakius knew that he was an
[44:43] ordinary he was no ordinary man, but he
[44:46] was extraordinary because God had given
[44:49] him insight into his life. And so we we
[44:51] may be ordinary people today, but God
[44:54] has given us an extraordinary insight
[44:56] into the age that we're living in. When
[45:00] we approach these uh these sons of
[45:02] Jacob, they're all so different. And I
[45:04] guess the thing that uh that that
[45:07] strikes you about Issachar is Issachar
[45:10] was such an ordinary guy. He he was such
[45:13] the tribe was such an ordinary tribe. In
[45:16] fact, if you if you'll read later in
[45:18] Judges 10, uh in Judges 10:1, it tells
[45:21] about Tollah, who was the judge from
[45:24] Issachar. And what's remarkable about
[45:27] Tola is he judged Israel for 23 years,
[45:30] and absolutely nothing happened. Yeah,
[45:34] that's kind of church I want, you know.
[45:38] But you know, there's always something
[45:40] to write about. And all the judges have
[45:42] different things written about them. And
[45:43] when it comes to Tollah, who's the judge
[45:44] for Msachar, it's like nothing,
[45:46] absolutely nothing happened worth
[45:48] writing about the entire time that he
[45:51] was judged. That's just the kind of
[45:52] tribe that they were. And and I think
[45:55] that's most of us if we would just
[45:57] really be honest. We're ordinary guys,
[46:00] ordinary men, ordinary women who live in
[46:03] an ordinary place and ordinary houses,
[46:05] drive pretty ordinary cars, depending on
[46:07] how deeply we are in debt for them. and
[46:10] and and we we're just ordinary people,
[46:12] but we serve an extraordinary God who
[46:14] who's able to take these ordinary things
[46:17] and make something extraordinary out of
[46:19] them. But most most people aren't rich,
[46:22] and most people aren't uh aren't uh
[46:26] famous. Most people uh maybe locally,
[46:28] but most people aren't famous in the big
[46:31] scheme of things. Most people aren't
[46:33] influencers in any way. Most people
[46:35] aren't even preachers. Most people never
[46:38] stand in the pulpit. But and yet and
[46:41] even as a preacher, I think most of us
[46:43] preachers are pretty ordinary. But yet
[46:45] ordinary people are the backbone of a
[46:47] church. We couldn't have church without
[46:50] everyday ordinary working people who
[46:53] just come to church and love the Lord
[46:54] with all their heart. And so I want to
[46:56] thank you ordinary people on a Wednesday
[46:59] night that you come to the house of God
[47:01] in spite of the weather and the things
[47:02] that were going on and you said, "I I
[47:04] just want to hear from God tonight." And
[47:06] And so it makes you something more than
[47:08] just ordinary people. Yeah. Issachar
[47:11] means higher or wages. Wages. In Genesis
[47:16] 30:17, it says, "God hearkened unto
[47:19] Leah, and she conceived and bear Jacob
[47:21] the fifth son, and Leah said, God has
[47:24] given me my hire because I have given my
[47:27] maiden to my husband. She called his
[47:28] name Issachar." So it was her wages.
[47:32] Jacob said, "He's like a strong donkey
[47:34] laying between two burdens." Believe it
[47:36] or not, in the east, it was it was an
[47:38] honor to be compared to a donkey because
[47:41] a donkey was a very important animal
[47:43] back then at Jesus. Kings rode on
[47:45] donkeys. When Jesus rode on a donkey, it
[47:48] was actually the way a king would come
[47:50] into town. And and so in Genesis
[47:54] 49:15, it goes on to say he saw that
[47:57] rest was good. Boy, I I identify more
[48:00] with him all the time. And and I don't
[48:03] think it just means that he liked to
[48:04] take naps, although that might have been
[48:06] part of it. But he saw that rest was
[48:09] good and the land that it was pleasant.
[48:11] So the part that God gave him, the
[48:13] portion that God gave him, he was
[48:15] satisfied with that. And so he he bowed
[48:18] his shoulder to bear and became a
[48:20] servant of the tribute. So he bowed his
[48:23] shoulder to bear. He put his shoulder to
[48:25] the wheel and worked. A and I want you
[48:29] to uh and maybe some of our younger
[48:32] people, many of them are not here
[48:34] tonight, but some of them will hear
[48:35] this. I think all of us elders and and
[48:38] especially you that are older than I am,
[48:40] that you would understand that the best
[48:42] way to have rest is to not be lazy.
[48:46] Right? The best way to have rest is to
[48:48] put your shoulder to the wheel. The the
[48:51] best way to have a church that's at
[48:54] peace, is to is to tackle the hard
[48:56] things while they there. and and take
[48:58] care of them instead of letting it
[48:59] fester and then and then you'll have a
[49:02] church at peace. The best way to have a
[49:04] retirement is to work, right? And then
[49:07] one day you get to retire. The best way
[49:09] to the best way to uh have money is to
[49:13] save money and not spend as much money.
[49:15] So So it's just a principle even in the
[49:18] scripture that the best way to have rest
[49:20] is not to be lazy. We know that there's
[49:22] a rest for the people of God. In Hebrews
[49:24] chapter 4 and verse 9, it said, "There
[49:26] remainth therefore rest to the people of
[49:28] God." That as Issachar found rest in the
[49:31] land, so we find rest in the baptism of
[49:34] the Holy Ghost. He said, "For he that
[49:35] has entered into his rest, he also has
[49:38] ceased from his own works as God did
[49:40] from his." He said, and and he says
[49:42] something here in Hebrews 4:11 that
[49:44] almost sounds like a contradiction, but
[49:46] he said, "Let us labor, therefore, to
[49:49] enter into that rest, lest any man fall
[49:52] after the same example of unbelief." So
[49:54] the word labor is actually to use speed,
[49:57] to make effort, to be prompt, to be
[49:59] earnest, to give diligence, to endeavor,
[50:02] to labor, or to study. So we labor to
[50:06] enter into rest. We work to enter into
[50:09] the Holy Ghost. We're diligent about
[50:11] pressing into the kingdom of God to a
[50:14] place of rest because that's the only
[50:16] rest that we're going to find. So we
[50:18] we're diligent in doing that. So that's
[50:20] what Issachar did. They were diligent in
[50:22] putting their uh shoulder to the wheel,
[50:24] putting their shoulder to the load and
[50:26] bearing up the load because they found
[50:28] that the land was a place of rest. And I
[50:31] want to be diligent in in in in doing
[50:33] the things of God and doing what God's
[50:35] called me to do because I found the Holy
[50:38] Ghost is good. How many can say amen to
[50:40] that tonight? I found the Holy Ghost is
[50:42] good. I found the land is a good land
[50:44] flowing with milk and honey. I've eaten
[50:46] the grapes from the land. I know that
[50:48] it's good. I know that it's sufficient
[50:51] for me. And so, I want to press into it.
[50:53] Do everything I can to enter that rest.
[50:56] In the natural, we press. I know we
[50:59] press. I I I I tend to think with
[51:02] empathy of our young men that work
[51:04] because I did that for many, many years.
[51:06] and you work and Wednesday nights are
[51:08] difficult because you work so hard and
[51:10] get your family ready and rush to church
[51:12] and and hope you don't fall asleep and
[51:14] hope they don't fall asleep and and so
[51:16] you have a difficult time sometimes on
[51:18] Wednesday night. But why do you do that?
[51:20] Because you you you're pressing to get
[51:22] into that rest because there's no rest
[51:24] in the world. There's only rest in
[51:26] Christ. But we we find that we have to
[51:29] press to get our bills paid. And
[51:31] somebody can say amen to that. We we
[51:33] press to get our bills paid and we press
[51:36] to uh to do the work that's necessary so
[51:39] our families can have rest. And it's a
[51:42] principle that we've got to do that. He
[51:43] didn't leave us here to do nothing, but
[51:45] he left us here to do something. And
[51:48] we're not talking about works for
[51:49] salvation because you can't work. That
[51:52] would make you a mule, right? That
[51:54] that's that's the downside to it. It
[51:56] would make you a mule if you work.
[51:57] Brother said the mule always works and
[52:00] don't know who its mommy is. Don't know
[52:01] who it daddy is. We don't work for
[52:03] salvation, but we work because of
[52:05] salvation. We work to press into
[52:08] salvation into the kingdom. Proverbs 6
[52:10] and6 tells us in the natural says, "Go
[52:13] to the ant, thou sluggered." In other
[52:16] words, watch the ant, consider her ways
[52:20] and be wise. The the ant is always busy.
[52:26] That's the way we ought to be naturally
[52:28] and spiritually.
[52:30] So he says uh verse 7, which having no
[52:32] guide, overseer or ruler, provideth
[52:35] their meat in the summer, and gatherth
[52:37] their food in the harvest. Nobody has to
[52:39] tell them to go to work. Nobody has to
[52:41] tell them to lay up a store for the
[52:43] winter. They just know to do that. And
[52:45] so it comes out of their nature to do
[52:48] that. He said, "How long wil thou sleep,
[52:50] oh slugard? When wil thou arise out of
[52:52] thy sleep?" I'm not preaching at people
[52:54] sleeping in church tonight. I hope
[52:56] you're still awake. We haven't been here
[52:57] very long. So he said uh he said, "Yet a
[53:00] little sleep, a little slumber, a little
[53:02] folding of the hands to sleep. So shall
[53:05] thy poverty come as one that travelth. I
[53:07] want as an armed man." In other words,
[53:09] if you won't get up and work, poverty
[53:11] will knock on your door. You won't have
[53:14] to go looking for it. It'll be there,
[53:17] right? And and and it'll knock on your
[53:19] door like a repossession agent,
[53:22] right? Maybe as a repossession.
[53:24] Povertyy's coming knocking if you won't
[53:26] work. Thank God for men that'll work.
[53:28] Brother Brandon said they asked Brother
[53:30] Brandon said, "Will a Christian work?"
[53:31] He said, "That's the one who only one
[53:32] who will is a Christian." So he he said
[53:36] uh if you won't get up and work,
[53:39] povertyy's coming to knock at your door.
[53:40] And so we don't want to be slothful.
[53:42] That's the biblical word or the at least
[53:44] the the King James word and in that we
[53:47] don't want to be soughtful naturally and
[53:49] we don't want to be sawful spiritually
[53:51] because just because our work is
[53:53] ordinary doesn't mean it isn't
[53:56] important. Just because it's an ordinary
[53:58] Wednesday night doesn't mean it's not an
[54:00] important Wednesday night. Just because
[54:02] it's an ordinary service don't mean it's
[54:04] not an important service. Just because
[54:05] it's an ordinary family doesn't mean
[54:07] they're not important. Just because
[54:09] we're ordinary people don't mean that
[54:11] God hasn't put a great importance on us
[54:14] in the age that we're living in. I say
[54:16] we ought to put the same importance on
[54:18] it that God put on you. Brother Brandon
[54:20] said he said you're the purchase of his
[54:22] blood. He said if I had a a vial of his
[54:25] actual blood, he said, "What would that
[54:27] mean to me? How I would hold it and make
[54:29] sure cuz I knew that would be his actual
[54:31] blood." He said, "How much more the
[54:33] purchase of his blood?" Right? So we
[54:35] should treat one another right. And
[54:37] because we're not just ordinary, but God
[54:39] has bought us and purchased us. So, we
[54:42] work and we work to do the right things.
[54:45] We're diligent in doing the right
[54:46] things. Proverbs 12:24 says, "The hand
[54:49] of the diligent shall bear rule, but the
[54:51] slothful shall be under tribute." The
[54:54] soughtful man, Proverbs 12:27, roasteth
[54:57] not that which he took in
[54:59] hunting. Right? And so he's so lazy is
[55:02] the kind of picture he's painting is
[55:04] that he hunts but he don't even bother
[55:06] to he kills it but he don't even bother
[55:08] to cook it to eat it. He just wastes it.
[55:12] He said but the substance of a diligent
[55:14] man is precious. So in other words he
[55:17] watches and and a diligent man will make
[55:20] sure that he's not a wasteful person. I
[55:22] say help me Lord. Proverbs because we
[55:25] live in a very wasteful society.
[55:27] Proverbs 15:19 says, "The way of the
[55:30] slothful man is as a hedge of thorns."
[55:32] So in other words, if you're lazy,
[55:35] because that's what the word sawful
[55:36] means. If you're lazy about the things
[55:38] of God or about even natural things,
[55:41] everywhere you go, there's going to be a
[55:43] hedge of thorns. There's going to be a
[55:44] reason why you can't do anything. Right?
[55:48] There's always going to be an excuse why
[55:50] you can't be there or do that or or work
[55:52] there or do that. Come on, church.
[55:55] Right? to a person uh my old pastor told
[55:58] me one time he said if you want somebody
[56:00] to do something in the church he said
[56:02] give the job to somebody who's already
[56:04] busy he said because that person will do
[56:07] something but a person who's not busy
[56:09] usually they they don't want to work but
[56:12] I I'm thankful for all of you that are
[56:14] workers I'm not preaching at you tonight
[56:15] it's just where we're at here in the
[56:18] scripture I want to be diligent in those
[56:20] things don't you so the the desire the
[56:23] Bible says uh he that is slothful in his
[56:26] work is brother to him that is a great
[56:29] waster. And then in Proverbs 21:25, the
[56:32] desire of the soughtful killth him, for
[56:34] his hands refuse to labor. So he becomes
[56:39] envious and he becomes covetous because
[56:43] of his desire for things and for money
[56:46] and for things like that, but his
[56:47] unwillingness to work to get them,
[56:50] right? So he becomes covetous and tries
[56:52] to get rich quick, right? come up with
[56:55] some scheme, right? So, we've all seen
[56:57] this. Whole nations have been caught up
[56:59] in this. That's what the Russian
[57:00] Revolution was about. It's what
[57:02] communism is about, right? It's a bunch
[57:04] of people realizing that we don't have
[57:06] what they have. And and many times it
[57:08] was an unfair system and and things, but
[57:11] instead of bringing freedom, it brought
[57:13] tyranny because they it was it was built
[57:16] on covetousness. It was built on the
[57:18] desire of a slothful man. He covetth
[57:21] greedily all the day long, but the
[57:23] righteous giveth and spareth not. Well,
[57:25] I want to be one like that. I want to I
[57:27] want to I want to guard my resources so
[57:30] I have to give to someone that needs it.
[57:33] I want to I want to I want to corral the
[57:35] things that God's given me. Make sure it
[57:37] don't get away. And again, I'm talking
[57:39] naturally, but I'm talking spiritually
[57:40] as well. I want to make sure the gifts
[57:42] that God's given me that I that I work
[57:45] with that that I make sure I'm the best
[57:47] that I can be. I realize I'm never going
[57:49] to be some great preacher somewhere, but
[57:51] let me be the best preacher that I can
[57:53] be. Let me be the best pastor that I can
[57:55] be. I I think our musicians ought to
[57:56] want to be the best musicians they can
[57:58] be. Our deacons and all of the officers
[58:00] in the church, we want to be the very
[58:02] best that we can be because God gave us
[58:04] the ability to do what we do. We didn't
[58:06] do that on our own. God gave us the
[58:08] ability to work. God gave us the
[58:10] ability. you young people, if you're
[58:11] able to work and make a living, God gave
[58:13] you that ability, then you ought to do
[58:15] everything you can to make sure you're
[58:17] diligent with that.
[58:22] So, Proverbs 26:13 says, "The soughtful
[58:25] man saith, there's a lion in the way. A
[58:29] lion is in the streets." So, he's always
[58:30] imagining a danger where there's work
[58:35] involved. Right.
[58:40] Well, you know, and that turns
[58:41] spiritually, too, because you find
[58:43] people are always afraid, well, if I
[58:44] testify, the devil's going to get me.
[58:46] Well, he's going to get you either way.
[58:48] He's coming after you. He's He's going
[58:49] about like a roaring lion. You might as
[58:51] well testify. Let your faith match your
[58:54] testimony. As we talked about on Sunday,
[58:57] he said, "As the door turneth upon his
[59:00] hinges, so doth the slothful upon his
[59:03] bed." And in verse 15, I I've told Peter
[59:07] and you know the best way to sleep good
[59:09] at night is to work hard during the
[59:12] day. I was talking to a young man who
[59:14] became a Baptist pastor and he had just
[59:16] become a pastor. He said the most
[59:18] difficult thing he said when I worked he
[59:20] was a he was in carpentry. He said when
[59:22] I worked every day physically he said I
[59:24] could sleep. He said now I can't sleep.
[59:27] He said because I don't put in that
[59:28] physical labor. There's something about
[59:30] that that when you work hard, you you
[59:33] sleep better.
[59:34] And so it says the soulful hideth his
[59:37] hand in his bosom, it it grieveth him to
[59:40] bring it again to his mouth. So he said
[59:42] he's so lazy he won't even feed himself.
[59:46] Huh? Now come on. We can take that
[59:48] spiritually, too,
[59:50] right? Well, I would listen to a tape,
[59:52] but I'd have to turn on the the tape
[59:54] player, and I got distracted on the way.
[59:57] But Lord, help us to be diligent about
[59:59] those things. I'd read my Bible, but you
[1:00:02] know, I I'll do it tomorrow. I don't
[1:00:03] have time today. Let's be diligent about
[1:00:05] it because we know it's important. It
[1:00:07] feeds our souls.
[1:00:09] So again, he in verse 16, he said, "The
[1:00:12] slugard is wiser in his own conceit than
[1:00:16] seven men that can render a reason." So
[1:00:17] in other words, it the not only is the
[1:00:20] sorrowful man or the lazy man or woman
[1:00:22] that whatever the case might be, they
[1:00:24] are not only uh they are not only sure
[1:00:27] of themsel or they're not only lazy, but
[1:00:29] they're sure that that's the best way to
[1:00:31] do things and you can't talk them out of
[1:00:33] it.
[1:00:35] So again, a soulful man will blame God
[1:00:38] for not giving him food when God gave
[1:00:41] him hands to work. Yeah. Right. A mind
[1:00:44] to think. And we ought to thank God for
[1:00:47] that because not everybody's got that.
[1:00:49] Not everybody was born with hands to
[1:00:51] work. Not everybody was born with a mind
[1:00:52] to think, but we were. I thank God for
[1:00:55] that tonight. And feet to walk. Right. A
[1:00:59] farmer can't complain about a crop not
[1:01:02] coming up if he never plants it. That's
[1:01:04] right. Right. If you never plant it, you
[1:01:06] can't complain. Whatever you sew, you're
[1:01:08] going to reap. Listen, if you never
[1:01:10] worship God, you can't complain about
[1:01:12] bad services. You can't complain about
[1:01:14] poor worship if you never worship. Come
[1:01:17] on, church. Well, there's something
[1:01:19] about that. You got to put something in
[1:01:20] to get something out.
[1:01:23] So, we find that Issachar put something
[1:01:25] in and he got something out. He he he
[1:01:28] was an ordinary man, but he saw that
[1:01:30] rest was good. So, he put his shoulder
[1:01:33] to the wheel and he began to bear the
[1:01:34] load. What if we did that? What if we
[1:01:37] recognized I said that the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:38] God's rest, was good and put all the
[1:01:41] strength we had in doing his will. What
[1:01:43] did he say the greatest commandment was?
[1:01:44] Love God with all your heart and all
[1:01:46] your mind and all your strength. Not
[1:01:48] just halfway, but do it with everything
[1:01:50] that you got. If it's worth doing, it's
[1:01:53] worth doing, right? Are you with me so
[1:01:55] far?
[1:01:57] So, Brother Brandham talked about how in
[1:01:59] the spiritual realm, he said that
[1:02:01] actually persecution strengthens the
[1:02:03] church. He talked about how the early
[1:02:06] Pentecostals, there was a story in the
[1:02:08] early Pentecostal church and Sister Anna
[1:02:11] Gene Moore actually uh wrote a book
[1:02:13] about this and I actually read the book.
[1:02:15] I had it. I may still have it in my
[1:02:16] library, but there was a book written uh
[1:02:20] about this incident that uh a woman was
[1:02:22] was uh did giving a testimony in church
[1:02:24] and worshiping the Lord and and somebody
[1:02:27] come by the church and they begin to
[1:02:29] shoot through the windows and and most
[1:02:31] of them hit the floor. But this one
[1:02:33] woman, she just stood there in the
[1:02:34] spirit worshiping God. And it was
[1:02:36] documented the bullets actually hit her
[1:02:38] dress and fell to the floor. That's
[1:02:41] right. Because she was just in the line
[1:02:43] of duty. She didn't know any better. And
[1:02:46] brother Brandham says this about that
[1:02:48] incident. And he said, "Persecution
[1:02:49] always gives strength to the church." He
[1:02:52] said, "We've had it too easy. We get
[1:02:53] slothful. We get to a place where we
[1:02:55] don't want to move on because
[1:02:57] everything's just handed to us." He
[1:02:59] said, "It takes sorrow and tears and
[1:03:00] sweat and prayer and faith." He said,
[1:03:03] "And promise to move forward in the
[1:03:05] power of the Holy Spir. We're going to
[1:03:06] raise our kids, right? It's going to it
[1:03:08] takes some input from the parents. It's
[1:03:10] going to take some trial and error. It's
[1:03:12] going to take some Yeah. You said,
[1:03:13] "Well, I'll make a mistake." Yeah, many
[1:03:15] times I make many mistakes, but let me
[1:03:17] get up and try again. Let me go again.
[1:03:19] We're going to get to that in just a
[1:03:20] moment. Now, look, in Hebrews 6:11, it
[1:03:23] says, "We desire that every one of you
[1:03:25] do show the same diligence." So he said,
[1:03:27] "I love the diligence that you're
[1:03:29] showing, but show the same diligence to
[1:03:31] the full assurance of hope until the end
[1:03:35] that you be not slothful. Don't be lazy,
[1:03:39] but followers of them who through faith
[1:03:42] and patience inherit the promises." He
[1:03:44] goes on to talk about Abraham. In other
[1:03:46] words, don't be lazy. Don't be a lazy
[1:03:48] Christian. Be like Abraham. Get up and
[1:03:50] follow God. When God says to do
[1:03:52] something, get up and do it. Why?
[1:03:55] Because you might as well. You can't
[1:03:56] make your own by your own effort.
[1:03:58] Abraham couldn't call himself. But when
[1:03:59] he was called, he got up and went.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah. Get up and follow God. When
[1:04:05] we work for the Lord, listen, many
[1:04:07] times, as I said, we might make
[1:04:08] mistakes, but if we sit here, that is
[1:04:11] certainly a mistake. We're sure to fail
[1:04:14] if we sit here. Think of the three
[1:04:16] lepers that were sitting there outside
[1:04:18] the gate of or in the gate of Jerusalem
[1:04:20] and and the Syrian army was outside and
[1:04:22] the people wouldn't let them inside and
[1:04:24] they said, "Well, we're just going to
[1:04:26] die." And one of them spoke up and said,
[1:04:27] "Why sit we here till we die?" They
[1:04:30] said, "We're going to die anyway. We're
[1:04:31] going to die of starvation if we just
[1:04:33] sit. We might as well get up and do
[1:04:35] something." So they went to the enemy
[1:04:37] camp and found that God had already
[1:04:39] taken care of their situation for them.
[1:04:41] If you get up and move, you'd find he's
[1:04:43] already been moving. He's already been
[1:04:45] working. Sometimes we just got to put
[1:04:47] feet to our faith. Yes. Right. Do
[1:04:51] something. Do something about the
[1:04:53] situation and see if God won't honor
[1:04:55] that.
[1:04:57] And so, you know, God was with Moses.
[1:04:59] Brother man preaches an entire sermon
[1:05:01] about that. He said, "As I was with
[1:05:03] Moses, so I'll be with thee." It's what
[1:05:05] Moses or what God spoke with Jehovah
[1:05:08] spoke to
[1:05:09] Joshua. And and but Moses had many
[1:05:12] failures and many mistakes. And we we
[1:05:14] know that he was a man. He he must have
[1:05:16] had failures. And we read about him in
[1:05:18] the scripture. But brother Brandham says
[1:05:20] this about that. He said, "What a
[1:05:22] consolation that must have been to
[1:05:24] Joshua." When he heard God say, "As I
[1:05:26] was with Moses, so will I be with you."
[1:05:30] Because Joshua, he he had been with
[1:05:31] Moses all those times that Moses made
[1:05:33] those mistakes. He said, "God, if you
[1:05:35] never left him, you'll never leave me."
[1:05:38] So that gives me courage. Amen. To know
[1:05:40] that you'll be with me. Even if I fail,
[1:05:42] you'll still be with me. He said,
[1:05:44] although if I'm trying and I fail, God
[1:05:46] won't leave me. How many How many love
[1:05:48] the Lord for that tonight? God won't
[1:05:50] leave me if I fail. If I'm trying to do
[1:05:52] something and I fail, God won't leave
[1:05:54] me. I never He said, "Have much
[1:05:55] confidence in anybody that's too afraid
[1:05:57] to do anything. I'd rather be found a
[1:05:59] failure than too lazy to try."
[1:06:04] Let's go to Matthew chapter 25. I want
[1:06:06] to look at the parable of the talents in
[1:06:08] relation to this. So, we're going to
[1:06:09] come back to Issachar at at some point,
[1:06:13] but I don't want to hold you long
[1:06:14] tonight. So, we'll just go right into
[1:06:15] the scripture. Matthew chapter 25 and
[1:06:18] verse
[1:06:20] 14. Jesus said, "For the kingdom of
[1:06:22] heaven is as a man traveling into a far
[1:06:24] country, who called his own servants,
[1:06:26] and delivered unto them his goods. And
[1:06:29] to one he gave five talents, to another
[1:06:33] two, to another one." Now, here's the
[1:06:36] reason why that he gives each one a
[1:06:39] different amount, right? He it's not
[1:06:42] just random,
[1:06:44] right? Gifts are not it's not just
[1:06:46] random, but he gives one according to
[1:06:49] his several ability,
[1:06:52] right? So, he knew, brother Brandon
[1:06:54] said, if you want to see if you're
[1:06:55] called to do something, he said, first
[1:06:56] see if you can do it. That'd be a good
[1:06:59] thing. See if you can do it and then and
[1:07:02] then if you're called to do it. Now he
[1:07:04] said to he gave to every man according
[1:07:06] to his several abilities. So each one
[1:07:08] had a different ability to work and to
[1:07:11] do with the master's money with the
[1:07:13] master's talents. And straightway he
[1:07:15] took his journey. And he that had
[1:07:17] received five talents went and traded
[1:07:18] with the same and made them other five
[1:07:20] talents. And likewise he that had
[1:07:22] received two, he also gained other two.
[1:07:25] So it' be like if you had a business,
[1:07:26] the business grew. It doubled in size.
[1:07:29] So this big business doubled in size.
[1:07:31] It's a small business doubled in size.
[1:07:34] He said, "But but he that received one
[1:07:36] went and digged in the earth and hid his
[1:07:39] Lord's money." Why? Because he was
[1:07:41] afraid to fail.
[1:07:44] Right? That that's the whole reason why
[1:07:46] he did it. He was afraid to fail.
[1:07:49] Because he thought, I know the
[1:07:51] reputation of my master that he'll
[1:07:53] require of me what I what he gave me. So
[1:07:57] to in order to keep it, I'm just going
[1:07:59] to bury it.
[1:08:01] Right. Yeah. So he was afraid to fail
[1:08:04] with it. He said, "If I take it out and
[1:08:06] try to trade with it," he said, "I'll
[1:08:09] I'll lose it, and if I lose it and have
[1:08:11] nothing to give him, he'll punish me for
[1:08:13] that." So that's what it was. He was
[1:08:15] afraid to fail. And after a long time,
[1:08:18] the Lord of those servants cometh and
[1:08:19] reckonth with them. So he that had
[1:08:21] received five talents came and brought
[1:08:22] other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
[1:08:24] deliverest unto me five talents. Behold,
[1:08:26] I have gained beside them five talents
[1:08:28] more. And his Lord said unto him, "Well
[1:08:31] done, thou good and faith." Oh, don't
[1:08:32] you want to hear that one day? Well
[1:08:34] done, thou good and faithful servant.
[1:08:36] Thou hast been faithful over a few
[1:08:38] things. I will make thee ruler over many
[1:08:40] things. Enter thou into the joy of the
[1:08:43] Lord. Again, he that had received two
[1:08:46] the same thing. He said, Lord, I've
[1:08:47] gained two other talents beside them.
[1:08:49] And his lord said unto him, well done,
[1:08:51] good and faithful servant. You've been
[1:08:53] faithful over a few things. I'll make
[1:08:55] thee rule over many things. Enter into
[1:08:56] the joy of the Lord. And he which
[1:08:58] received one talent and came and said,
[1:09:00] Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard
[1:09:03] man. In other words, I know how you deal
[1:09:05] with people that have gifts. I know how
[1:09:07] you deal with people that that are given
[1:09:09] things. And and I know you require them
[1:09:12] back. Yeah. So I was afraid. He said,
[1:09:16] "And I went and hid thy talent in the
[1:09:19] earth." He said, "Lo, there thou hast
[1:09:22] that is thine." Come on. And his lord
[1:09:25] answered and said unto him, thou wicked
[1:09:27] and lazy slothful servant. He said,
[1:09:31] "Thou kneest that I reap where I sowed
[1:09:33] not, gather where I have not stroed." He
[1:09:35] said, "Thou oughtest therefore to have
[1:09:37] put my money to the exchangers, and then
[1:09:39] at my coming I should have received mine
[1:09:41] own with usery or interest." He said,
[1:09:43] "Take therefore the talent from him, and
[1:09:45] give it unto him which hath 10 talents.
[1:09:48] unto every one that hath shall be given.
[1:09:50] He shall have abundance, but from him
[1:09:51] that hath not shall be taken away even
[1:09:53] that which he hath, and cast you the
[1:09:55] unprofitable servant into outer
[1:09:57] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[1:09:59] nashing of teeth. Brother Brandham says
[1:10:00] this about that. He said, "Every man
[1:10:02] will have to answer for his talent."
[1:10:05] See, I won't have to answer for what God
[1:10:08] gifted you to do, but I have to answer
[1:10:10] for what God gifted me to do. Right? And
[1:10:13] each one of us have to do that. He said,
[1:10:15] "God gives men talent and they have to
[1:10:18] use it." He said, "Some can preach like
[1:10:20] a house on fire and the other different
[1:10:23] things." Right? And and it's not that
[1:10:26] one's more valuable than the other, but
[1:10:28] God knew his several ability, right? And
[1:10:31] so he what did he do? He didn't give my
[1:10:33] wife and I the same things. He gave us
[1:10:35] complimentary gifts that we could
[1:10:37] compliment one another. He didn't give
[1:10:39] me and brother Joel the same gift. He
[1:10:41] gave us complimentary gifts so that we
[1:10:43] could work together. all of us together.
[1:10:45] He gives us complimentary gifts knowing
[1:10:47] that we would be in church together.
[1:10:48] See, God knows those things. He knew we
[1:10:50] would go to church with Allan. He knew
[1:10:52] that we would be together and go to
[1:10:53] church together. And so, he gifts us in
[1:10:55] a complimentary way. But how we use
[1:10:58] those gifts is is on us, right? He lets
[1:11:01] us do that. And I'm thankful that he
[1:11:04] does because that's where our reward
[1:11:05] comes from, right? Because we're already
[1:11:08] saved. We're going to make it. We're
[1:11:09] sealed to the day of our redemption. But
[1:11:11] I want to take as many with me as I can.
[1:11:13] I want to have a crown when I get there.
[1:11:15] I want to I want to have stars in my
[1:11:17] crown. I want to have rewards because
[1:11:19] there's a great reward ceremony coming
[1:11:22] when you get there. I remember uh not to
[1:11:24] digress very far because it's Wednesday
[1:11:25] night, but I remember uh the biggest
[1:11:28] award ceremony I was ever part of was in
[1:11:30] the Philippines. I I was uh I preached a
[1:11:33] youth camp and then at the end of the
[1:11:34] youth camp they had awards and the
[1:11:36] Filipino people really they like their
[1:11:38] rewards and their awards and so they
[1:11:40] they made trophies for everybody and it
[1:11:44] wasn't just give a trophy to everybody
[1:11:45] but everybody won something like if you
[1:11:48] couldn't win a game they they invented a
[1:11:50] game you could win. So they they ended
[1:11:53] up man they had so many trophies. I
[1:11:55] think we sat there for three hours. I
[1:11:57] was sitting at the front. I fell asleep
[1:11:59] in that in that while they were giving
[1:12:01] those trophies and they had to wake me
[1:12:03] up to get me out of there that night.
[1:12:05] It's a true story. Actually fell asleep
[1:12:08] in church. So y'all can feel better
[1:12:09] about that
[1:12:10] tonight. But but it was so it went so
[1:12:13] long. It was about 1 o'clock in the
[1:12:14] morning I think when they woke me up.
[1:12:17] But but it was and it was after a long
[1:12:19] hard week. So, I got a little bit of an
[1:12:21] excuse, but but what it was was a great
[1:12:24] trophy ceremony. They thought so much of
[1:12:25] that why people like to get it and it
[1:12:27] didn't mean nothing. It was real cheap
[1:12:29] little little trophies, but but to them
[1:12:31] it meant something, right? It was
[1:12:33] important to them. It's important to me
[1:12:36] to make sure I got some trophies on the
[1:12:37] other side. And so, if you see me
[1:12:39] strive, if you see me press, come on. I
[1:12:42] think we all ought to be that way. It's
[1:12:43] important to us that we have some
[1:12:45] trophies on the other side because he's
[1:12:47] worthy of those because we're going to
[1:12:49] give them back to him. He gets all the
[1:12:51] praise. He gets all the glory for
[1:12:53] everything he's enabled us to do. He
[1:12:55] gave me the ability to work, to provide.
[1:12:57] He gives you the ability to care. My He
[1:12:59] gives my wife a different ability than
[1:13:00] he gives me, but both of them comes from
[1:13:02] God. He gives you all the seed to plant.
[1:13:05] He he gives you all the uh the ability
[1:13:08] to to plant the crop spiritually and
[1:13:10] naturally and he will require it require
[1:13:13] it at our hand. Yes, sir. Now, brother
[1:13:16] Brandham says this. He said, "We're not
[1:13:18] a perfect people." I think we could all
[1:13:21] say amen to that.
[1:13:23] We make our mistakes.
[1:13:26] We do things that's wrong.
[1:13:29] But he says, you see, love covers all of
[1:13:31] that. Yeah,
[1:13:33] we're willing when we see our mistakes
[1:13:36] to come back and apologize to one
[1:13:37] another. He said that's warriors. That's
[1:13:41] really men and women that's gallant. Any
[1:13:43] man can go out to the battlefield that's
[1:13:45] got nerve enough to walk out there. But
[1:13:47] when he gets knocked down, then get up
[1:13:49] and try it again. See, and with as many
[1:13:52] he said as 120, I guess there were 120
[1:13:54] people there in that particular service.
[1:13:57] He said, "You're bound to find things.
[1:13:58] Sometimes the enemy will sweep in among
[1:14:01] you and through your minds and start
[1:14:03] this and that. He said just stop when he
[1:14:06] does it. So whenever the enemy tries to
[1:14:08] bring something and say, "Well, so and
[1:14:10] so don't love me." And and usually it's
[1:14:12] somebody in in a position. So they'll
[1:14:14] say, "Well, the pastor don't love me or
[1:14:15] the song leader don't love me or the
[1:14:16] deacons don't love me or the church
[1:14:18] doesn't love me." He said, "Just stop
[1:14:20] when he does it." Yeah. Think back.
[1:14:23] Think of this morning. Think of the
[1:14:25] times when you're sitting together in
[1:14:27] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I think
[1:14:29] Sunday, and not to put too much on it,
[1:14:31] but I think Sunday morning and Sunday
[1:14:33] afternoon was a banner day in the house
[1:14:36] of God. I think that'll be a time we
[1:14:38] ought to be able to look back on it and
[1:14:39] see God did that and and we're
[1:14:41] remembering what God did. We're
[1:14:43] testifying of what God did. I believe
[1:14:44] this service can be a banner day in the
[1:14:46] house of God. Why? Because he said, "We
[1:14:48] think about these times that we're
[1:14:50] sitting together in heavenly places in
[1:14:52] Christ Jesus. Some some of you are
[1:14:55] plumbers and some are carpenters and
[1:14:57] some this that and the other. In other
[1:14:59] words, you're ordinary workers like
[1:15:00] Issachar was. You rub arms with the
[1:15:02] world each day when you're out there.
[1:15:04] But when you see those things and great
[1:15:06] temptations rise, just remember these
[1:15:08] little sacred places where you're
[1:15:10] sitting. You see why the devil wants to
[1:15:12] take that away from us. He don't want us
[1:15:14] to have that something to put our our
[1:15:16] stake down on, something that we can we
[1:15:18] can count on. He said, "Remember these
[1:15:20] sacred places. Remember these sacred
[1:15:23] places where you're sitting together
[1:15:25] with the only thing that lasts. Your
[1:15:28] jobs will fail one of these days. Your
[1:15:30] health will fail. Even your life here on
[1:15:32] earth will fail. But that won't fail.
[1:15:34] And if he is the center of all things,
[1:15:36] someone say all things. Then let's keep
[1:15:38] our minds on the centerpost. What has
[1:15:40] drawn us to this? Yes.
[1:15:43] Now I want to use most the rest of my
[1:15:45] time tonight on on this that there was a
[1:15:48] cautionary tale to Issachar. He worked.
[1:15:52] He was willing to work. He saw a v had a
[1:15:55] vision for his life and a
[1:15:57] goal. But in the end, he become a
[1:15:59] servant to
[1:16:01] tribute. And the reason was
[1:16:04] because the tribe of Issachar according
[1:16:06] to
[1:16:07] history, they became indentured servants
[1:16:10] to those around them, which is basically
[1:16:13] slaves because they never could see a
[1:16:16] profit in
[1:16:17] war because they worked. That's who they
[1:16:20] were. They worked. They made money. They
[1:16:23] liked peace. They liked quiet.
[1:16:26] So they never could see a an advantage
[1:16:30] to fighting. Right. Right. And there's
[1:16:32] sometimes you got to fight. Right.
[1:16:36] Sometimes you got to stand and fight.
[1:16:37] Yeah. Sometimes you got to go toe-to-toe
[1:16:40] with the devil. Yes. Listen to me. Every
[1:16:42] one of us at some point in our life is
[1:16:44] going to face a serious situation where
[1:16:46] we got to either become come in bondage
[1:16:47] to the enemy or fight him. Come on.
[1:16:50] Yeah. Right. And so the tribe of
[1:16:52] Issachar actually got to a place where
[1:16:53] they would not they would not fight
[1:16:56] anybody because they lost revenue. So
[1:16:59] they would rather pay a tribute and
[1:17:01] become indentured servants than they
[1:17:03] would to see to give up their profits
[1:17:06] for a while in war. But some things are
[1:17:10] worth more than money. Brother Brandham
[1:17:12] in the message he tells us he said give
[1:17:13] us more. Another Patrick Henry, he's
[1:17:16] speaking about politics. And this is
[1:17:18] what Patrick Henry said in his famous
[1:17:21] speech, give me liberty or give me
[1:17:22] death. He said, "Our brethren are
[1:17:24] already in the field. Why stand we here
[1:17:27] idle? What is it that gentlemen wish?
[1:17:29] What would they have? Is life so dear or
[1:17:32] peace so sweet as to be purchased at the
[1:17:34] price of chains and slavery? Forbid,
[1:17:38] almighty God." And I believe this
[1:17:40] applies spiritually, church. He said, "I
[1:17:43] know not what course others may take,
[1:17:45] but as for me, give me liberty or give
[1:17:48] me death." He said, "We got to fight or
[1:17:51] die trying, but we don't want to be
[1:17:53] slaves." I think we ought to we ought to
[1:17:55] have that kind of attitude when it comes
[1:17:57] to things. We may be ordinary people. We
[1:17:59] may be called to an ordinary thing. You
[1:18:02] might never be called to preach. You
[1:18:03] might never be called to sing. You might
[1:18:05] be just called to sit in a in a church
[1:18:07] pew and enjoy the word of God. And yet
[1:18:10] there's something in your heart when the
[1:18:11] time comes, your battle's coming. And
[1:18:13] when the time comes, you got to be
[1:18:15] willing to fight that cancer or that or
[1:18:17] that unbelief or that or your kids that
[1:18:20] go out in the world or something like
[1:18:21] that. You got to be willing to fight.
[1:18:24] So you got to prepare for the fight. You
[1:18:27] got to know that some things are worth
[1:18:28] fighting for. You just can't keep giving
[1:18:31] in. All right.
[1:18:33] You hear me? You give in over. You said,
[1:18:35] "Well, I'll give in to this and this and
[1:18:37] this and I'll step back here and I'll
[1:18:38] step back here." After a while, you get
[1:18:40] backed in a corner, right? Somebody's
[1:18:43] got to be willing to be like Arnold von
[1:18:44] Wickery who who went forward and there
[1:18:47] was a great army coming their way. But
[1:18:48] he said if he said I somebody's got to
[1:18:50] do it. So he said, "This day I die for
[1:18:53] Switzerland." And he he run into the
[1:18:54] meat of the spears and the very thick of
[1:18:56] it. And it become a great victory that
[1:18:59] day that those poor farmers actually
[1:19:01] overcome. Come on church. They overcome
[1:19:03] that great army. Why? They were fighting
[1:19:05] for their homes. They were fighting for
[1:19:07] their families. That's what we're doing
[1:19:09] tonight in this fight. We're fighting
[1:19:10] for what God gave us.
[1:19:13] Don't be a servant to tribute.
[1:19:18] Don't let life itself become so
[1:19:20] important. It's just a means to an end.
[1:19:22] Yes. That you forget the main thing.
[1:19:26] The Bible says, Proverbs, which we read,
[1:19:29] which talked to us about the slothful
[1:19:31] man, how he needed to work. But it says
[1:19:34] this about the poor man. He said,
[1:19:35] "Better is the poor that walketh in
[1:19:37] uprightness than he he that is perverse
[1:19:39] in his ways, though he be
[1:19:41] rich." Be careful that you don't become
[1:19:44] so focused on obtaining rest in the
[1:19:46] natural. I know many people who are so
[1:19:49] worried and concerned about retirement.
[1:19:52] It was heartbreaking because I've talked
[1:19:53] to some of them and you talk to them at
[1:19:55] the end of all of that. And I had a
[1:19:58] brother tell me, he said, "I've worked
[1:20:00] for all this money and now I have to get
[1:20:01] rid of it. I got I'm too broke down and
[1:20:05] sick in my body to use it and I and and
[1:20:08] the family's already taken care of and I
[1:20:10] got to get rid of it to go, you know, in
[1:20:12] in certain type of health care. And it
[1:20:15] just broke my heart because work is not,
[1:20:18] you know, work is not all of it. It's a
[1:20:21] means to an end, right? We're we're
[1:20:24] trying to provide for our families.
[1:20:25] We've got to provide for our we're
[1:20:27] scripturally mandated to provide for our
[1:20:29] families. No one else. Us men are
[1:20:32] scripturally mandated to do that. But
[1:20:34] it's a means, not an end. Work in
[1:20:37] itself. There there's value in it in
[1:20:39] work and there's there's a there's
[1:20:41] status in it and you feel good when you
[1:20:42] work. There's something about that makes
[1:20:44] you feel good, but it's not all there
[1:20:46] is.
[1:20:48] Brother Brandham says, "We hear so much
[1:20:49] of today about how we're free. We live
[1:20:51] in a beautiful America." And he said,
[1:20:52] "The book's written about it." He said,
[1:20:54] "But you're a million miles from being
[1:20:55] free. You're not free. Don't you be
[1:20:58] deceived by that." He said, "America's
[1:20:59] one of the greatest deceived nations."
[1:21:01] He said, "And in more bondage than any
[1:21:03] place I know of, or worse in bondage
[1:21:05] than communism could put them in." He
[1:21:07] said, "Communism can only hurt the body.
[1:21:09] They can only put the body in bondage.
[1:21:11] But when the devil comes in, he puts the
[1:21:13] soul in bondage." See, that's the
[1:21:15] problem. America's still free,
[1:21:18] relatively free when it comes to
[1:21:20] politics. But what about the soul? What
[1:21:23] about the souls of the people? Yeah.
[1:21:26] He said, "You may be a slave to pride.
[1:21:29] You might walk up and down the streets
[1:21:30] and go through every store in every
[1:21:32] fashion that you can see on television,
[1:21:34] go from store to store trying to buy
[1:21:36] something. You become a slave to it. You
[1:21:38] become a slave to your dressing."
[1:21:42] He said, "You can become a slave to your
[1:21:43] money." He said, "That's the only thing
[1:21:45] you think of is to make money, grab and
[1:21:47] put it up here. If you do that, you're a
[1:21:49] slave."
[1:21:51] He again, he said, "A lot of people
[1:21:53] build upon riches. They try to work, see
[1:21:54] how much money they can make. They say,
[1:21:56] "If I can't spend it, my children can
[1:21:57] behind me." He said, "What does it do?"
[1:21:59] It relates to slavery. This is sobering
[1:22:02] thoughts, but I think it it it do us
[1:22:04] good to think about it on a Wednesday
[1:22:05] night. You don't have to be a
[1:22:07] millionaire to be that. Now, this is
[1:22:09] where people, you know, you get this the
[1:22:12] man a man can get covetous or a woman
[1:22:14] can get covetous because you begin to
[1:22:16] think, well, you know, those
[1:22:17] millionaires, those rich people, they
[1:22:18] ought to share. But the Bible doesn't
[1:22:21] teach communism. That's right. That's
[1:22:23] right. Right. And and brother Brandon
[1:22:26] says this. He said, "You don't have to
[1:22:27] be a millionaire to be a slave to your
[1:22:29] money." That's right. He said, "You can
[1:22:31] just covet money. You're just as guilty
[1:22:33] as a millionaire." He said, "There's
[1:22:35] just as many penny ears as there is
[1:22:37] millionaires will be in hell."
[1:22:39] He said, "Because it's your attitude
[1:22:41] towards it, what God has given it given
[1:22:44] you." He said, "Now, if you build it
[1:22:45] upon riches, it'll fall." Look at 1
[1:22:48] Timothy chapter 6 and verse one. I've
[1:22:50] got five minutes left. We're just going
[1:22:51] to use it and we'll go home in just a
[1:22:53] moment. But he said he said, "Let as
[1:22:56] many servants as are under the yoke
[1:22:57] count their own masters worthy of all
[1:22:59] honor." So he they were back then it was
[1:23:01] literal servants. But I believe it's
[1:23:02] it's applicable to man who works for a
[1:23:06] boss today. He said, "Let them count
[1:23:08] their masters worthy of honor." Verse
[1:23:10] two, they that have believing masters,
[1:23:11] let them not despise them because
[1:23:14] they're brethren. Because that can
[1:23:15] happen as well. You say, "Well, I know
[1:23:17] them. They go to church, so I don't have
[1:23:18] to work as hard." He said, "Don't do
[1:23:20] that." Right? He said, "Because they're
[1:23:21] faithful and beloved, partakers of the
[1:23:23] benefit." He he talks about how if any
[1:23:25] man teach otherwise, it's it's it's
[1:23:27] against good doctrine and and how that
[1:23:31] uh he said he's proud knowing nothing
[1:23:32] but doing about questions and strife of
[1:23:34] words or of cometh envy, strife,
[1:23:36] railings, evil surmisings, perverse
[1:23:39] disputings of men of corrupt minds,
[1:23:41] destitute of the truth, supposing that
[1:23:43] gain is godliness. See, that's the
[1:23:45] modern prosperity gospel. And it's crept
[1:23:47] into the message. Right. Right. overseas
[1:23:50] and especially in Nigeria, it's crept
[1:23:52] in. And I'll say to those brothers if
[1:23:54] they watch this tonight, and some of
[1:23:55] them will, I I'll say it's it's not what
[1:23:57] brother Brandham taught us, right? We
[1:24:00] don't just get together and look who has
[1:24:01] the best
[1:24:02] car. It's actually laughable because uh
[1:24:06] there's people there who are starving,
[1:24:07] too. And so, we don't do that. We don't
[1:24:10] show off those things. And we don't do
[1:24:12] that. And uh even if I do drive a Ford
[1:24:14] and that's the best kind of car to
[1:24:15] drive, you know, but but we don't get
[1:24:17] together to see who I got one agreement.
[1:24:19] We we don't get together to see who has
[1:24:21] the best car or the best house or
[1:24:23] something like that. We get together to
[1:24:25] find out what we can do for one another
[1:24:27] and what we can do for God to be
[1:24:29] servants to one another and to God. But
[1:24:33] but he said godliness, he said gain is
[1:24:35] not godliness, but godliness with
[1:24:37] contentment is great gain.
[1:24:40] So with whatever you have, whatever
[1:24:42] God's gifted you to have, if you can be
[1:24:43] content with that and not always
[1:24:45] borrowing, a lot of times covetousness
[1:24:47] leads to over over becoming
[1:24:50] overind because you always want more and
[1:24:52] want more and that'll actually make you
[1:24:54] poorer, not richer. He said, "But
[1:24:56] godliness with contentment is great
[1:24:58] gain. For we are brought we are we
[1:25:00] brought nothing into this world and it's
[1:25:02] certain we can carry nothing out.
[1:25:04] None of us carried a bag full of money
[1:25:06] when we come into this world. My mama
[1:25:08] wishes I had, but none of us did. And
[1:25:11] none of us can carry nothing out. And
[1:25:13] having food and rain, but let us be
[1:25:15] there with content. But they that will
[1:25:17] be rich fall into temptation and a
[1:25:19] snare. In other words, that's their
[1:25:20] purpose of being rich fall into
[1:25:22] temptation and a snare, into many
[1:25:24] foolish and hurtful lust, which drown
[1:25:26] men in destruction and predition. For
[1:25:28] the love of money is the root of all
[1:25:30] evil. He didn't say money is but the
[1:25:32] love of money which while some coveted
[1:25:34] after they have aired from the faith and
[1:25:36] pierced themselves through with many
[1:25:38] sorrows. See there's a time for
[1:25:41] everything and we need to understand the
[1:25:45] times. There's a time to make money and
[1:25:47] there's a time to go to church,
[1:25:49] right? There's a time to there's a time
[1:25:51] to worship God and give that our full
[1:25:54] attention. There's a time to give our
[1:25:56] job our full attention,
[1:25:58] right? When we're working for somebody.
[1:26:00] So, we we've got to be able to know what
[1:26:02] time we're living in. I'll say this,
[1:26:04] when it comes to the age we live in, the
[1:26:06] end time. Jesus looked at the Pharisees.
[1:26:09] He said they were wanting a sign. And he
[1:26:11] said, "You you see the signs of the
[1:26:12] heavens and say it's if there's red sky
[1:26:14] at night." He said, "Then then you see
[1:26:17] it's going to be a beautiful day the
[1:26:18] next day." He said, "And contrary wise,
[1:26:20] but but" but he said, "You can read that
[1:26:22] sign. You can read the weather
[1:26:24] forecast." Some of us are real good at
[1:26:26] reading the weather forecast. But c but
[1:26:29] can we understand the times? Yeah. That
[1:26:32] we're living in. That's what we really
[1:26:34] want to read. Yeah. So what what was
[1:26:36] Jesus telling them? It's time for the
[1:26:38] old covenant to be done away with and
[1:26:39] the new covenant to be established. And
[1:26:41] you say, "Brother Ben, what does that
[1:26:42] have to do with
[1:26:45] Issachar?" 1 Chronicles
[1:26:47] 12:32. I'll look at this then we'll
[1:26:50] close. The children of the children of
[1:26:53] Issachar. This is when David is going to
[1:26:55] be king. And there's still a household
[1:26:58] of Saul around that were disputing his
[1:27:01] kingship. So it depended on which way
[1:27:04] the tribes went depending on whether he
[1:27:06] would be king or whether he would not be
[1:27:08] king. So how many gathered to his
[1:27:11] banner? We find that of the children of
[1:27:14] Issachar which were men that had
[1:27:16] understanding of the times. Oh, I
[1:27:19] believe there's a lot of ordinary people
[1:27:20] here. I'm an ordinary person, but we've
[1:27:22] been gifted with an understanding of the
[1:27:24] times. Yeah. Right. Through a prophet
[1:27:27] messenger, we've been given an
[1:27:29] understanding of the times to know what
[1:27:31] Israel ought to do. And they taught the
[1:27:33] people. They said, "Listen, listen. We"
[1:27:35] They taught their tribe. They said, "We
[1:27:36] need to go with David. It's time for
[1:27:38] David to be king." They said, "Saul's
[1:27:41] time is over." And I believe there's
[1:27:42] some people here on the earth that
[1:27:44] understand the lateness of the hour,
[1:27:46] understand the time that we're living
[1:27:48] in, and said we're going to give up all
[1:27:49] material things and we'll still work and
[1:27:52] provide for our families, but our focus
[1:27:53] isn't going to be on materialism. We
[1:27:56] live in a wonderful country and a great
[1:27:58] place to make money and things like
[1:27:59] that, but we don't want to get our focus
[1:28:01] on that because we understand the times.
[1:28:04] The times are it's time for David to be
[1:28:07] king. It's time for Jesus to be king.
[1:28:09] It's time for a millennium. It's time
[1:28:11] for the rapture. It's time for some
[1:28:13] things to happen. And so, there were
[1:28:15] some men who had an understanding of the
[1:28:17] time. And I challenge you tonight. Let's
[1:28:18] be like that tribe of Issachar. Let's
[1:28:20] have an understanding of the time we're
[1:28:22] living in. Say, "It's time to worship
[1:28:24] God like never before. It's time to
[1:28:27] praise him like never before. It's time
[1:28:28] to testify to our neighbor. It's time to
[1:28:31] be a full believer of the message of the
[1:28:32] hour. To have an understanding of the
[1:28:35] times, to know what Israel ought to do.
[1:28:39] We are ordinary
[1:28:41] people. We've been given an
[1:28:43] understanding as the musicians come.
[1:28:44] Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes for
[1:28:47] they see and your
[1:28:50] ears for they hear." In one place he
[1:28:53] said Jesus rejoiced in spirit and he
[1:28:56] said God I thank you that you've hid
[1:29:00] these things from the eyes of the wise
[1:29:02] and the prudent and the
[1:29:04] extraordinary doctors of
[1:29:06] theology but you've revealed it to
[1:29:08] ordinary people babes that would learn.
[1:29:11] I say God help me to be one of those
[1:29:13] ordinary
[1:29:14] people that can learn about the things
[1:29:17] of God. We we don't want to
[1:29:19] forget the main thing.
[1:29:22] The main thing is Christ. If your a
[1:29:25] lotment is ordinary, I think most as I
[1:29:28] said, most are. I'd say most of us, I
[1:29:32] don't think any of us are prophets or
[1:29:34] have a message to the age. We're just
[1:29:37] ordinary
[1:29:39] people. But Jesus came as an ordinary
[1:29:42] man, but he had an extraordinary
[1:29:45] purpose. and you have an extraordinary
[1:29:47] purpose. Don't despise the day of small
[1:29:49] things and how important it is to raise
[1:29:52] your family in church. How important it
[1:29:54] is to live for God and to give
[1:29:57] everything for the gospel. I don't mean
[1:29:59] your money. I don't want that. I'm
[1:30:00] talking about your your heart, right?
[1:30:03] Your your your your your being to give
[1:30:05] it all. It's worth it, church. I think
[1:30:08] our elders could testify it's worth it.
[1:30:10] If you give your all, in the end,
[1:30:11] there's a piece to that. you know, I I'
[1:30:14] I've given everything to him. I've
[1:30:15] surrendered all my life to him. He'll
[1:30:18] bless that. Don't despise the main
[1:30:22] thing. The main thing is
[1:30:24] Christ. Amen. Would you bow your heads
[1:30:26] with me tonight?
[1:30:30] Heavenly Father, I just uh stumbled
[1:30:34] through a Lord maybe a little bit
[1:30:36] different type of
[1:30:38] sermon, but I'm so thankful, Lord, that
[1:30:41] you took us ordinary
[1:30:43] people and chose us to be your bride
[1:30:46] here in the end
[1:30:47] time. I ask you to help me, God. I I see
[1:30:51] as Issachar was willing to put their
[1:30:53] shoulder to the wheel and wasn't afraid
[1:30:54] to make a mistake in doing that. And I I
[1:30:58] pray you'd help us, Lord, to put our
[1:31:00] shoulder to the load and be willing,
[1:31:03] Lord, to bear up under it to do what
[1:31:06] needs to be done. Help me, Lord. I pray,
[1:31:09] God, that you just move among us and
[1:31:12] inspire our hearts, our faith to do the
[1:31:15] thing that needs to be done. Pray you'd
[1:31:17] grant it, Lord. I know that you're able
[1:31:19] and willing to take every one of us and
[1:31:21] make us into what you want us to be. So,
[1:31:24] we surrender tonight, Lord. We surrender
[1:31:26] all that we have, all that we are, and
[1:31:28] all that will ever be to your will. Pray
[1:31:31] you'd forgive us. Lord, forgive me where
[1:31:33] I failed you. I Lord, as a pastor, every
[1:31:35] every week, every day, I make decisions,
[1:31:38] and I always wonder, did I make the
[1:31:40] right one? Oh, God, I I want to be
[1:31:43] right. I want to be led by you. I I want
[1:31:46] the best. I don't want permissive will.
[1:31:48] I want perfect will, Lord. I pray, God,
[1:31:50] you'd keep me on that edge, Lord.
[1:31:52] Lord, if there's a little pressure to
[1:31:54] that, let me stand it, Lord. Let me be
[1:31:57] willing to do that, Lord, to do the
[1:31:59] right thing. Forgive us where we failed,
[1:32:01] Lord, but may we get up and go again,
[1:32:04] Lord. Not look to the past, forgetting
[1:32:06] those things that are past, but pressing
[1:32:08] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:32:10] God. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I pray
[1:32:13] you'd comfort those that are afflicted
[1:32:14] tonight. Those that have lost loved ones
[1:32:16] or those that are sick. I pray that
[1:32:19] you'd move. May your presence rest with
[1:32:21] them. We pray. We thank you for all that
[1:32:23] you do and that you have done. We thank
[1:32:25] you for miracles, Lord. Lord, as as we
[1:32:28] heard or saw a testimony, another
[1:32:30] testimony of your grace with Sister
[1:32:33] Milliey's eyes, Lord, and Lord, a little
[1:32:36] little girl, Lord, that we prayed for
[1:32:37] just recently. We know that you're
[1:32:39] working in her, Lord, you're working for
[1:32:41] Glorella and these children. I pray
[1:32:43] you'd bless them, oh God. Lord, continue
[1:32:46] to move. We're we're happy for what
[1:32:48] you've done, Lord. But we know there are
[1:32:50] other needs and I pray you'd meet those
[1:32:52] needs tonight. We thank you for doing
[1:32:54] it. We trust you and we believe you. We
[1:32:57] believe that it'll happen in Jesus name.
[1:33:00] Amen. God bless you
[1:33:03] tonight. We press
[1:33:06] on.
[1:33:08] Hallelujah. Let's stand
[1:33:10] together. Oh dear
