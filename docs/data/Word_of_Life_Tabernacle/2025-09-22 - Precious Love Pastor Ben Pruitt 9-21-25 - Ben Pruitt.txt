========================================

[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, [Music] hey, hey. [Music] D. You know the Heat. Heat. [Music] Louise. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour. The Bible tells us so. Many souls have been his prey to fall in some weak hour. But God has promised us today his overcoming power. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. than he that is in the world. And on the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind blew into the upper room, baptized all of them with a power gater than any earthly foe. I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know that greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Let's sing that song. I would not be denying. Start with the first verse, Brother Robert. When pains of death seized on my soul, unto the Lord I cry. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. As Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled with the Lord [Applause] and instant with the courageful I stood upon his word. I would not be denied. Oh no, I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. And old Satan said, "My Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer." But praise the Lord. The work is done in Christ the Lord is here. I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Let's try that first verse again. When pains of death ceased on my soul, unto the Lord I cry. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Sing it with all your heart. I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied. Till Jesus came and laid me home. I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just tell you why. because my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say my sins are gone. They're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from dawn. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. It was at the old time altar where God came in my heart. Now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. The devil did depart. I'm glad. My sins are gone. There underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for. Praise God, my sins are gone. When Satan comes to temp me and tries to take me back, I say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are gone. There underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music with all my heart. I say I know my sins are gone. There underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from dawn. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Sing that chorus once again. There underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from dawn. There in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Sing it one more time. There underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Amen. We'll have the ushers come at this time. Um the only prayer request I have is uh from the only new one is from my mother. It says, "Please pray for my grandma Sue Pitman. She's in the hospital not doing well." So let's remember that and just remember the request from this morning uh brother Biscll's family especially in prayer. I'll have brother Jared pray. Lord Jesus we come to you this evening Lord or this afternoon just thankful for another time that we get Lord to be able to gather around your word with your people Lord. We just pray that you would remember the needs Lord amongst your people Lord. pray that you would come down among us, Lord, and just meet each and every need. May you move in a mighty way, Lord. May you be with Brother Ben as he comes out and preaches the word. May you be in every aspect of the service, Lord. We thank you and worship you in Jesus Christ's name. [Music] Could you pull up those words, Brother Robert, to shout to the Lord? We'll start with the first verse. My Jesus, my savior, Lord, there is none like you. All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. My comfort, my shelter, tower of reuge. Let every breath all that I am. Never cease to worship [Applause] you. Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty, praise to the king. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. [Music] I sing for joy at the work of your hand. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. My Jesus my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. my comfort. You're my shelter. And strength, let every breath all that I am. Never cease to worship [Applause] you. Bow to the Lord on the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to the king. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. I sing for joy at the work of your hand. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I had in you. My Jesus, you're my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days. I want to praise the wonders of your mighty. As Haley and the girls come to sing, my comfort, my shelter, tower of reuge. Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship [Applause] you. Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to our king. Mountains bow down and the sea will roll at the sound of your name. hand. I sing for joy at the work of your hand. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. Amen. Just give him a hand clap of praise as you're seated. [Music] Oh, what I would do to have the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat I'm on to the crashing waves to step out of my comfort zone into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is [Music] holding out his hand. waves. They calling out my name. And they laugh at me, reminding me of all the times I've tried before and fail. Boys they keep on telling me time and time again. Oh, you never win. You never win. But the voice of truth tells me a different story. And the voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid." And the voice of truth says, "This is for my glory." And all the voices calling out to me. I would choose to listen and believe are true. What I would do never dying just a sling in a star surrounded by a sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor. I was ashamed to stand up. I was holding out my name and they laughed at me all the time. I've tried before telling me time and time again. Oh, you never will. You never will. [Music] And the voice of truth tells me a different story. And the voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid." And the voice of truth says, "This is for my glory." Out of all the voices calling out to me, I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth. On the ground seem so high looking down. I soar with the wings of eagles when I soft and listen to the sound of Jesus singing over me. Voice of truth tells me a different story. The voice of truth says do not be afraid. And the voice of truth says this is for my glory. Out of all the voices going after me. &gt;&gt; I wish to listen and believe the voice of truth. I used to listen and repeat the voice of truth. We're going to go ahead and have um uh Esther and Emma come up and sing with Nolley. [Music] Take my life and let it be my soul devoted Lord to thee. Take my moments and all my days. Make them in this praise. Take my heart and let it move in spirit and in truth for the glory of your name. With every breath that's in me, with every song in me, let it be a hallelu. [Music] In every breaking moment, in every blessing that you give, let it be a hallelujah. Oh Lord, let it be a hallelu. [Music] All my hopes and all my fears. Every child, every tear in the chaos in faithful all the way through the victories, through the scars. Let me echo who you are for the glory of your name. With every breath that's in me, with every song and me, let it be a hallelu. [Music] In every breaking moment, in every blessing that you give, let it be a hallelu, [Music] oh Lord, let it be a hallelu. Let it be a hallelu. Let it be a hallelu. Nothing but a hallelu to you God. Let it be a hallelujah. All my life a hallelu. Let it be a hallelu to you God. [Music] With every breath that's in me, with every song and mey, let it be. Let it be. With every breath that's in me, with every song and me, let it be a hallelujah. [Music] In every breaking moment, in every blessing that you give, let it be a hallelu. Oh Lord, let it be a hallelu. Let it be a hallelu. [Music] [Applause] It's hard to sing after that. That's good special. Give him another hand clap of praise. [Music] Let's try that song after all. After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountaintop so tall looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I can make it after all. And after all, this life is over. And our burdens have been lifted. And we stand upon the mountain top so tall and look over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I can make it after all. Can you stand and sing it? And after all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain top not so tall. Just sing it as our pastor comes. over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I can make it after all. And after all, this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And we stand upon the mountain top so tall. And looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I can make it after all. Can we sing that one more time with After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted glory and we stand upon the mountain top so tall. Oh, I'm looking over in a city where the Savior is preparing. He gives me grace and I can make it after all. Aren't you glad you believe you'll make it? Amen. Let's give the Lord another hand clap of praise. Aren't you glad after all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted? Amen. We stand there on the mountaintop. We're going to say, "I know that it made it by grace." Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. I wonder tonight if we could just approach the Lord and just ask him to come in this service. I know there's a bunch of people gone this afternoon, but but we're just believing that the Lord will move for this service tonight. I pray that he would. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to be here in your house once again and to thank you for your goodness and your mercy, Lord, that we have an after all to look forward to. Lord, your grace and your mercy's provided a a future for us. We thank you for that tonight. I pray that you'd move in a mighty way. Speak directly to your children tonight, Lord. I pray that you'd just move me out of the way and Lord, say what you have to say tonight. I pray you'd grant it now, Lord. Heal the sick, touch those that are in need. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. It's good to be with you tonight. We'll just go right into the word of God and just believe that he'll have something to say to us tonight. Matthew chapter 24 and verse 12. Matthew 24:12. Just that one verse tonight. says, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. I pray the Lord that is blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. That word many in the original uh don't really give us the force of of the original word. the he the original word is more it's saying that the majority the love of the majority so it's not just the love of many so we know there's many people who uh have hatred and not love in their heart for one another for God but he said the love of the majority will grow cold &gt;&gt; I think we've all seen that &gt;&gt; I think the last couple of weeks have maybe shown that to me, brother Matthew, more than ever before. How people just have hatred in their hearts. &gt;&gt; They hate one another. They hate one another because of politics. They hate one another because of race. They hate one another because of church or religion. They hate one another uh some of them hate God. They hate his people. And a and and it's it's a terrible time in that sense to be living in because the majority will never never love. They'll never experience the love of God. They can't they can't do that. And and and will always be in the minority. I was looking today at the uh memorial service for Charlie Kirk and I haven't spoken about that to you, but uh when he was assassinated here a couple of weeks ago, and they had his memorial service this afternoon, and I wasn't much interested in what the politicians had to say about it. But I did tune in to hear the pastor, his pastor speak this afternoon. And I'm thankful that the gospel was preached in whatever form that he was able to preach it. He preached it in that service. And I'm thankful that people got to hear that. I believe there will be people that will be in heaven because they heard the gospel preached just like that. And its simplicity that uh Christ died for our sins and we need to stand for him and believe there'll be people there because of that. And maybe because of the influence of of him and what they knew. But I got to thinking about that and I I thought, what would constrain a man? what would drive a man to do what Charlie did at 31 years of age to uh to go out and hold political rallies and go into these uh uh you'd almost have to be insane. And I guess it proved that it wasn't the best idea going into uh go into universities where a bunch of people hate what you believe and and put get up a sign says prove me wrong and stand under it and and when because people anymore if they can't argue with you they'll they'll just kill you. But that's just the age that we live in. And and so he he did a fearless thing to be able to do that. But what would drive a person to do that? Well, it would be love, &gt;&gt; right? It would be love. It'd be love for his family, love for his country. Hate wouldn't drive you to do that, &gt;&gt; but love would drive you to do that on whatever level that he had. He had some kind of love to be able to to do that. And and I thought of brother Biscll who passed on this week. and and I thought of the love that he had for the message of the hour and and the love for the people of God and just to see the message get out and it's getting rarer and rarer, brother Stewart, that people have that kind of love for the message of the hour. Well, I pray it would be here in our church and here in our in my ministry and the ministries of these brothers, we would have a love for the things of God. We would just love him with all of our heart. We don't do what we do because it's because it's uh you know people applaud you and people say no uh brother Bisco 40 years ago was going out in the wilderness of Africa and taking his wife leaving his family going out to spread the message and to tell people about the about the love of God about that. What was that? It was love in his heart for the people. It was love in his heart for the message. It was love in his heart for the things of God. I think there ought to be a people on the earth today. We may be the minority, the majority, the love of the majority is growing cold and and actually hate is growing in its place, but we we'll always be the minority, but may love go out from us in a mighty way. &gt;&gt; That people would feel it and they would know it. That we wouldn't we wouldn't step, well, there's not very many people here tonight. It's a Sunday night. But the love of God constrains us to preach the gospel. The love of God constrains us to give our all at every moment for the things of God. How many can say amen to that tonight? &gt;&gt; I'll give everything that I've got for the things of God. Paul says that. I didn't have put the scripture on the board, but he said the love of Christ constrains us. Why do we do what we do? Paul says we have a ministry of reconciliation. Why do we go out and spread the gospel? Why do we He said we persuade men of the gospel of Christ. Why do we do what we do? Because the love of God constrains us. Oh, that that love would always be a majority in our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Overcome every fear. Cuz perfect love cast out fear. And I want to preach tonight on precious love. If the love is not what the majority has, then it is precious in its rarity in the minority. It's precious. It's valuable. Not many people have it &gt;&gt; in the Thotiran church age. The true believers are commended for their love. In Revelation chapter 2 and verse 19 said, "I know thy works and charity and service and faith and patience and works and the last to be more than the first." We don't gain salvation by works, but if you love God, there's something about you. You want to do something for God. Brother Joel today is traveling back from Georgia. And I appreciate brother Joel. I don't know if he's listening, but you know, we all we need to we got to stay humble. We've got to stay servants because that's what we are &gt;&gt; to the people of God. &gt;&gt; But he's not doing what he's doing just because he wants to travel. He's doing what he's doing because he loves people. And that's what we want. We can't You can't give that to somebody. You got to love people. And you can't give that to somebody. That's something that's got to be there. And you can train somebody. You can teach them how to do something, but you can't make them love people. You You could train somebody how to teach Sunday school, but you can't make them love the kids. They've got to do that. Got to be something in their heart to do that. You could train somebody to be a deacon, but you can't make them love to do it, &gt;&gt; right? It's hard to do. It's difficult job. I'm just preaching to you locals here tonight. We've got It's just us. So, let's just talk about it for a minute. you you don't do what you do because you're constrained by the pastor or you're constrained by the church or somebody made you do it, but you do what you do. And you got to keep this foremost in your mind or you'll never do it right. I love God's people and I love God. And so I want to do something for God. That's what keeps me preaching. That's what keeps me going. That's what keeps me going to the house of God. That's what keeps me pressing on in an hour when everybody's giving up and the love of many, the majority is going cold. Let me be on fire for the things of God. Let me be that minority that loves you with all of his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I know your works and love. I know your works and love and service and faith and patience and works and the last to be more than the first." Other words, the love doesn't diminish. The works don't diminish the works by love. Brother Brandon says, "I know your love, service, faith, and patience. You'll note their love is placed between works and service." &gt;&gt; And that is the right place for it because without love, our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service. &gt;&gt; Paul speaking to the Corinthians said, "Without love, I'm nothing." That ought to make us church. I know you can you can lose your love for the people. Brother Brandham said that one time. He lost his love. lost his lost his feeling for the people and he had to get it back. &gt;&gt; He had to repent of that. But but but without love, Paul said, "I'm nothing." And and so love has to go between works and service. Without love, I'm nothing. Whatever I do is without profit, unless it's done in love. He said, "Now, you can see right here, these believers weren't in that nickelan class that did works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men. They did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost." that love in their hearts was God's love for his own. So God put love in the hearts of his people and it was God's love for his own shown through that person. That's what the message of the hour was. It was God's love for us in the day and hour that we live in shown through a prophet to the believer. It is God's love in a pastor today that'll keep him doing the work. It's God's love in evangelist that'll keep him running the the roads and going where to the people. God's love in the missionary that'll cause him to reach out to foreign lands. God's loving the teacher. God's love in all of the offices that are given. What is it? God's love in their hearts. And it's God's love for his own. Amen. Jesus said, "By this shall all men know that you're my disciples that you have love one for another." The pagans, he said, who saw the love the lives of the early Christians said, "Behold how they love each other." &gt;&gt; And John said, "Everyone that loveth is born of God." But the B said, I want to give a warning right here. It says concerning the last days because of How many know we're living living in the last days. &gt;&gt; If you don't know that, I don't know what rock you've been under, &gt;&gt; right? We're living in the last days. &gt;&gt; We're living in the last days. Everything the Bible said has come to pass. &gt;&gt; Living in the closing moments of history. He said that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold &gt;&gt; in the lee in our last age selflove. A prophet used that term before the world ever used it. &gt;&gt; But now that term is all over the place, self love, &gt;&gt; right? And and people realize they have to take care of themselves and they have to love themselves. But he said self love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God. &gt;&gt; We need to guard against the power of sin in these last days. So many that are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit. It's time to draw nigh to God. Let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us in those dark and dreadful years. The true vine he said held its love for God and love of the brethren. No, I believe the true vine today will hold its love for God and his love of the brethren. Do you believe that? I I believe that's why you come to church on a Sunday afternoon when you'd rather be taken than he because the true vine has a love for God and a love of the brethren. &gt;&gt; Love for God is a precious thing. Most people are not even conscious of God, much less love God. They don't even know. So we said this morning, being able to feel the presence of God is only by faith. You can't have faith unless God gave it to you. &gt;&gt; A true love for God must come from his love for us. John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. In John 15:13 said, "Greater love hath no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends." In 1 John 4:19, he said, "We love him because he first loved us." I talked about that Wednesday night, but if we could just dwell on that for a moment. He first loved us. &gt;&gt; How does he love us? How did he first loved us? See, we don't love God because of what he gives to us. We don't love him because even how good he's been to us. We sing about the goodness of God and we realize that he is good. He has been good all of our lives. He's been good. &gt;&gt; But he did not begin to love us when we were born, &gt;&gt; but he began back before time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before we were anything but a thought in his heart, in his mind, he loved us then. How does he love us? We we know that Israel when they were uh when they were here, they didn't as a nation, they in the Old Testament, they didn't feel loved. Cuz sometimes when you're sitting under the the heat of God's wrath, you don't feel very loved. Sometimes when you're going through tribulation and trial and you're going through sickness, you're going through pain and you don't feel very loved and maybe you things haven't worked out the way you thought they would and maybe you didn't get everything you thought you would get out of out of the word and out of your Christian experience and you're sitting there saying, "Lord, I don't feel very loved. In fact, I don't feel very much at all." &gt;&gt; But love isn't about feeling. &gt;&gt; Love is about a choice. Listen to me, young people. You don't you the feeling that you have for a young man or a young woman will not keep you together. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a choice that you choose to love that person. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to choose to love him every day. Every day of your life, you're going to wake up. It may not be a conscious choice, but uh Brother JT's not here tonight, so I'll pick on him. And Sister Clelet, I know when Sister Clelet got where she couldn't get up and fix breakfast in the morning, brother JT had had a stroke and they got to the place where brother JT and I'd watch him and he'd go in there and he'd fix breakfast for her in the morning. He could barely move and he he'd fix breakfast for her and they've been married over 50 years and I got to looking at that and I thought that's love right there. He making a choice. He didn't have to do that but he's making a choice cuz he loves his wife to go and do that. I think that's the kind of love we ought to have for each for each other. Especially in marriage, there ought to be a love there at choice. That's the way God loved you. He didn't love you when you were doing good. He loved you when you were doing bad. When you were the very worst of the worst, that's when he loved you. When you made your worst decisions, he loved you anyway. It's kind of love we're talking about. We don't believe in divorce. We don't get second chances. If you before you ever get married or tell somebody you want to marry them, you better be sure you can love them like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that kind of love was redemptive. It's redemptive. &gt;&gt; It'll change a situation. &gt;&gt; It'll bring you back from the brink. &gt;&gt; It'll change your your home. It'll change the world that you live in. Changed our world. When he came to us, Israel said, "I don't feel very loved." Malachi 1:2 he said, 'I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet you say, wherein hast thou loved us? Still poor God. Haven't won the lottery yet cuz I don't play. I God, I'm still, you know, I'm still hurting. Still fat. Just trying to make you laugh. &gt;&gt; Worked on one person. God said, "I loved you." &gt;&gt; Right, young people? He said, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Said, "I have loved you." And you might look back and say, "Well, you didn't love me very much or I wouldn't look like this." &gt;&gt; He said, "I have loved you." Sayeth the Lord. Yet you say, "Where's Joel when you need him?" Yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved us?" They said, "We we can't see any evidence of your love." &gt;&gt; Well, they weren't looking very hard, were they? &gt;&gt; Wherein hast was not Esau Jacob's brother, said the Lord. Yet I love Jacob. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I hated Esau. Laid his mountains, his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. It looked like Jacob had more problems in life. He was a worse person. He He didn't have as many advantages as Esau had. But look at the love that God had for him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, you see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. No matter what happened. Can we say amen tonight? No matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen to salvation. Because God hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign, but it is all with a purpose. If he did not have a purpose, then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. Listen, listen to me. You say, "Well, I don't know the purpose of God." Well, Brother Brandham tells us what his purpose is. He said his purpose is that after we have suffered a while, we would be made perfect, be established, strengthened, and settled. As Job said, he puts strength in us. He puts strength in us. It doesn't mean that you won't go through no trials, but he make you strong enough to go through and come out on the other side. We ought to be witnesses of that tonight. We We may not have been saved from the trial, but we were saved through the trial. And we know that we only made it by the strength he put in us. &gt;&gt; He loved you first so you could love him. The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to grow up a little bit &gt;&gt; to the point where the cl every time the sky clouds up, we don't ask God why he doesn't love us. &gt;&gt; Right? I'm preaching to myself, too. Need to grow up a little bit. When the rain comes and the sky clouds up and the storms come, say, "Lord, I know you love me, &gt;&gt; so I know you're going to work this for my best, for my good." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval." &gt;&gt; Anybody can worship when everything's going good. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's it's not it's pretty rare, but once in a while, you know, when you're good, you know, I feel good. My job's doing good. My wife loves me today, and my kids said they love me today, and everything's going good, and you're sitting there thinking, boy, right now, I could just worship. But I love the fact that when Job got the bad news that he got, maybe the worst news anybody got ever in one day, that they didn't take it easy on him, he lost it all everything he had. He lost everything he loved. He lost everything, all of his family. He got all that bad news. And the Bible said when he got done getting the news, they brought it to him. He fell down and worshiped God. &gt;&gt; He said, "I came naked into the world. I'll go naked out of the world. I didn't bring nothing. I won't take nothing with me, but God, I love you. I worship you. You're still God. Amen. He said, "Though he saves me, I'll trust him." Oh, how many can have that attitude today? Hey, listen to me. The church, God's sign of approval on the church is not how many people are sitting in the pew, but God's sign of approval to this church is the word that's being preached that he loves us, or he wouldn't give us his word. He loves us, or he wouldn't have brought us to the message of the hour. His approval of us is only in the beloved. Love is elected which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? Ah yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so. And manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that quote this morning? Brother Brandon said that the same pillar of fire, he said, is in his adopted sons today. Oh God, do we realize that? What he said, Brother Ben, what places us as sons? We're going to get into adoption on Wednesday nights as L or Terry's this Wednesday night, but the Kobe Martin is going to be here. We're looking forward to having him with us. He's coming through and I ask him to preach on Wednesday night. But I, you know, we're going to get into that on Wednesday night about adoption. But I'll say this, it's this message that places us as sons. We didn't know who we were, but the message of the hour brought in the age of adoption. That's what it is. Not a fourth work of grace, but this is the age of adoption. And in this age, we can become all that God wanted us to be as the bride. We can become full full grown sons of God, daughters of God. He said he give us of his spirit, placing us as sons. How shall I prove my love to him? By believing what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I can't work hard enough to make make it up to him. I can't do that. But by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials he and his wisdom allows to come to pass. See, if you love God, want to worship him, want to do what the Bible says, that's precious. Do you know that you're special? Turn around to your neighbor if you have one tonight and say, "You're special." You're special. Say that to the people in the folks in the back sitting by themselves. You're special. You are. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that &gt;&gt; what you have is more valuable than gold. You are the one sheep that he left the 90 and nine for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So grateful that he did. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's his precious love that did that. His special love for you. &gt;&gt; He put that special love in you. The call of God that we have in our hearts and our response to him should not be taken for granted. The deep calling to the deep, the desire to be in the house of God, the desire to say yes, Lord. We shouldn't take that for granted. In Matthew 4:18, Jesus is walking by the Sea of Galilee. And he saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." Now, he hadn't gone through and had a big campaign, fisherman campaign, and outreach to fisherman and tried to dress himself up like a fisherman and go by. And he didn't do that. He only went to them, right? and James and John, right? But he didn't go to all the fishermen, but he went to certain fishermen. &gt;&gt; He come by my way. &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he come by my way? When he come by their way, he said, "Follow me." Now, I want you to understand how odd this is, right? Are you still with me tonight? &gt;&gt; We won't hold you long. I want you to understand how odd this is. I mean, I took like like hours of material out of this sermon. So, We were in Togo, West Africa, and they would cast the net. They let us help them pull it back in. It's It's really neat because they still use the same kind of fishing technique. They just walk out into the surf and cast a net and pull it. It's very, very difficult to pull back in. So, they they would cast a net and they would pull it in or they would go out in the boat and they'd cast a net and bring it into the boat. So, they would have to be strong, burly men. These were real men, right? And here comes Jesus walking by. He says, "You, Peter, follow me." And they did. &gt;&gt; The Bible says they just dropped their nets and did it. What? Put something was in their heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And people just don't do that. &gt;&gt; You do that. You just go try it sometime. go by damn three up here at the walk by there and catch some guy in there fishing and say follow me and watch him drop his $500 fly rod into the water and just take off after you. He ain't going to do that. You say you're an idiot, right? They going to do that. What What created a response? They may have a hundred teachers come by said, "Why don't you be my disciple? why don't you be my disciple? But Jesus didn't have to persuade. He didn't have to go in there and make them feel good about themselves and and and set up all kinds of things for them to do and and say, "Peter, if you'll follow me, I'll make you I'll make you fishers of men." He told them that, but he never told them they were going to be persecuted. Peter was going to end up dying on a cross. &gt;&gt; But but they he didn't tell them. He didn't make a bunch of empty promises. What did he say? Follow me and I'll make you fishers of men. and they straightway left their nets, left their money, left their job, left everything and said, "We'll follow you, Lord." Who does that? Don't take your response to the word for granted. When you hear the word says, "Go out and live a Christian life. You ladies dressed a certain way. You men act in a certain way and and he tells you to do that and you go do it." Don't take that for granted. &gt;&gt; What What is that response? It's it's election in your heart. It's the reason brother Brown said people can't believe in miracles today because they don't have anything in them to believe with. &gt;&gt; They got to have something in there to believe with. See, that's the majority. The love of the majority is waxing cold. The love of the majority. They don't believe in the supernatural. And the spirit of God is in a man. He'll say amen to every word of God and every miracle of God. As my mother used to say, you can't get blood from a turn it because there's no blood in it. So that's the same way you can't get belief out of an unbeliever because there's nothing there to believe with. But if you got something to believe with, we ought to be thankful for that today. &gt;&gt; That's the love of God. It's a rare thing. It's precious love. Brother Brandon said, "You got to be born, regenerated, baptized with the Holy Ghost into Jesus Christ, quickened to every word. Your spirit in you will punctuate amen to every word of the Bible. outside of that if listen if it shakes its head on one &gt;&gt; he said you get rid of that spirit &gt;&gt; that's not the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; right if it's the word you don't have to agree with everything I say you don't have to agree with everything one of the other preachers say but you got to agree with the word &gt;&gt; right and if you shake your head on one word &gt;&gt; oh that's listen that's what the Holy Ghost is something in you that says amen to every word &gt;&gt; and outside of If it shakes its head on one, you get rid of that spirit. It's not the spirit of God that would dispute the word of God. It'll keep the word of God. Not only does it believe it, but it makes it live. It manifests the word of God. Oh, I thank God for that today. You say, "Who can do that? Who would leave their nets and follow him in this age? Who would do that? Who would follow the message of the hour? Who would devote their lives to it?" Only the bride can do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a precious love. If our love for God is precious, brotherly love is precious as well. And I know I preach a lot about love and very little about do this and do that and the other, but I believe if we loved right, we would do &gt;&gt; what we needed to do. &gt;&gt; Mark 12 28 says, "One of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving he had answered them well, asked them him, which is the first commandment of all." Did you know he didn't say long dresses? And I believe in long dresses. That's not what he said. He didn't say don't cut your hair. I believe that women shouldn't cut their hair. That is what he said is the most important commandment. What's the first commandment? Jesus answered the first of all commandments is here. Oh Israel, Lord, our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God all thy heart. &gt;&gt; He doesn't just tell us to we should love him. He said, "Thou shalt love him with &gt;&gt; all." Someone say, "All." &gt;&gt; All thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind, with all thy strength. This is the first commandment. &gt;&gt; And just for for extra, he drops this in. But he said the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There's none other commandment greater than these. They ask him who is our neighbor and he goes on to explain who your neighbor is somebody that you meet that's in need &gt;&gt; that needs something that something that you can give something you can pour out to them. That's your neighbor. Now look in 1 John 4:20 it says, "If a man say, I love God and hateth his brother, he's a liar." That's pretty strong, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. Don't let political events inspire hatred in your heart. &gt;&gt; I say that to those that are here and those that are not who watch this service. Don't let what's going on, don't let Facebook stir you into a frenzy. &gt;&gt; If you can't keep it good on there, then get off of it. &gt;&gt; Right? And if if you're going to going to call people names and stuff, it's no place for that. That is not a Christian. That's not what a Christian does. If if a man say, "I love God hateth his brother," he's a liar. &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? &gt;&gt; Oh God. And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also? By this shall all men know that you're my disciples. In John 13:35, if you have love one to another, I want to read you a quote and we've all read it. We've heard it many times in the word to the church, but I think we missed the significance of the quote. Brother Brandon says this. He said, 'Now, you got tapes on that. You got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church, how we behave oursel in the church of God. Why do we have church like we do? Because brother Brandham told us to. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I preach because brother Brandham said to do that, &gt;&gt; right? And I can't get past that. I can't get beyond that. But brother Brandon said, "You got tapes on that. We can we can go and listen to those tapes and we know." He said, "If there was a question about it, we could even play that tape and they people would know what what it was." He said, "How we behave ourselves in the church of God, how we got to come together. We got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places." He said, "Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers." &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, I tell you, it's time you got to pray. And I think we always put the emphasis on that. It's like a quote that we use to get people back in church. But brother Brandon was talking about something much deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Right? Because godly people are going to miss church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; At some point or another. &gt;&gt; Christian people full of the Holy Ghost at some point or another going to miss church. And so I think on some level all of us fail at this quote, &gt;&gt; right? Because I I make almost every service but not every one because at some point I need a break, &gt;&gt; right? I don't need a break from church, but I this is where I work. This is what we do. And so sometimes we'll go other places, go to other churches or go to a meeting or take a vacation. And so all of us would fail if we held ourselves to a standard every time the doors are open. We have to be at church. &gt;&gt; But but brother Brandon saying something to us. And I think we miss what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. If God is in your heart, &gt;&gt; why would a man like Charlie Kirk go and do what he did? Because he loves something. &gt;&gt; That's right. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Why would a man like Ed Biscll go and do what he did? Because he loves something. &gt;&gt; Why would you go to church? Some of you elders come over and over and over again. Some of our young people come and and are faithful. Some of our families are faithful to the house of God. Why do you do what you do? Because you love God. There's something in your heart &gt;&gt; so you don't make decisions that'll keep you out of church &gt;&gt; because you love God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It's almost something deeper than just, you know, well, if I miss the service, I got to feel condemned. I I know what that feels like, man. It's almost not worth it not coming to church cuz you feel so bad. &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me? &gt;&gt; But that's what he's talking about. It's not how often you come to church. It's that desire in your heart. &gt;&gt; And I want you all to be here every time, but I realize that's the standard nobody can meet, &gt;&gt; right? Except for brother Harvey. Maybe he meets that standard. I don't know. But remarkable. Remarkable. But but there's a lot goes into something like that. &gt;&gt; Right. That don't just happen. &gt;&gt; It's cuz somebody feels that way. &gt;&gt; I've never told our deacons, you got to be here all the time. Our elders, you got to be here all the time. Young people, we got to be here all the time. I try not to preach at people who aren't here. But it's there's got to be something there. We're talking about something deeper than just He said, don't stay home. If you can go to church, go to church. &gt;&gt; But not because he said it, but because God is in your heart. &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you'll want to obey what he said. &gt;&gt; He's not griping about folks not attending church. He's saying if you don't love God and you don't love his people, something's wrong. But let me give you a little bit of hope here today. If you find yourself lacking the love of God and the love of his people, you can there's a place you can go back to and pick up where you left off and find a place and altar and get that kindle back in your heart again. It don't mean you're not a Christian. It means the love is kind of waxing cold, but don't go with the majority. The the poem said, "Don't be like dumb dumb driven cattle. Stand against the foe. Stand against the enemy. Be a hero in the strife. We're in the last days." Brother Brandon said, now that's the next quote. He said, "Cuz we're in the last days." The Bible exalted and said much more exhorted us much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love. That's what he's talking about &gt;&gt; to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus love one another. I don't care what anybody says. If you tell me I can't go to church anymore, I'm not going to obey that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we we discovered that during co we didn't like that much &gt;&gt; cuz the love of God was in our hearts. &gt;&gt; And this church, you know, we didn't have as many as we do now. But I tell you what, there were services during co I had people call me, can I come to church? I said, you be one of the 10. My math wasn't very good. Remember when they limit us to 10 people and 40 people would show up? But we didn't do that. We weren't if we were trying to keep people from coming to church because they were afraid of what would happen. We were trying to protect people the best we knew how. But I'll say this, the love of God was in the people's hearts. They wanted to go to church. &gt;&gt; And we saw revival among young people after that around the message. We saw a revival after that broke and people were able to come together again. They didn't care if they all caught CO every time they went to camp. There was a revival in their heart because they'd seen what it was like to not be in the house of God. And they said, "Lord, we realize we need the house of God." I pray that God will put something in our heart. Not because a preacher preaches it. Not because somebody hit hit you over the head with it or somebody makes you feel bad because you didn't come, but because the love of God was in your heart. You can say, "I just I just want to be in the presence of God." There's some I I've challenged our musicians. I've challenged our song leader. I've challenged brother Joel. I think I've told this to brother Stewart. We ought to make church so re such such a a time of fellowship and a time of the word being preached. We ought to make the atmosphere so rich people would want to come to the house of God. I don't want to have to beat you up about going to church. Let's make it a place where people want to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; We won't do that by catering to every whim, but we preach the word and Christians will want to be because their love for God, they want to be where the word is preached. Don't ever think, "Brother Ben's against me because I don't make it all the time." Don't think that. Don't let the devil get in your heart, that in your heart. No. If you love God's people and you love God, you'll be at church when you can. Brother Brandon quoted that. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other. That's right. Stay right together. If the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say, "Lord, boy, I was going to take a show of hands. I better not keep your hands down." But how many of you think a brother is a little wrong? Half of you thought of me, didn't you? It's okay. That would be I may be a little wrong. Are you with me? Melody's like, "Yes, sir." She thinks I'm a lot wrong. I won't let her have a phone yet. But anyway, if you think Melody, your dad's a little wrong or the sister, maybe you think your mom's a little wrong, say, "Lord, don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up &gt;&gt; because it'll affect him &gt;&gt; and it'll take the Christ right out of my life. And &gt;&gt; how many people sit at home when they they say they will tell you they believe everything a prophet said yet they'll sit home instead of go to the house of God because they got hurt in church. &gt;&gt; What was it? A rooe of bitterness come in. &gt;&gt; I don't say they're not good people but they got their feelings hurt in church. So they won't come to the house of God and fellowship. They've lost their love for God and they've lost their love for the word. They've lost their love for the people of God. I say it's time to come back and get a another baptism of love. &gt;&gt; Find what's been lost. And brother Brandham said that poison acids and malice and jealousy and hatred will take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It'll run him from the tabernacle. It'll kill the spirit of God. Drive it away from here. It'll hurt your pastor. It'll do everything. He said, "Don't you do that." See, we could we could come to every service and and go home and feed our families poison about the ministry or poison about the church and we'd be just as bad as a person that don't come. &gt;&gt; What should we be doing? Trying to lift them up in prayer. The Lord, help my pastor. He may not be doing a very good job right now. Help him to do a better job. Help him. He's he's he's standing in a in a precarious situation and in a public place trying to declare the word of God. Help him. Protect him. Help the deacons. Help the trustees. Help the people that have to make decision. Don't sit there and criticize them. Brother Brandon said, "We ought to buckle up." There was a man who had a vision and talked about buckling up the whole armor of God. Brother Brandon said, "Tighten up. Move right up close to one another. Love one another." Anyhow, talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another and God will bless you. How many want to be blessed today? Say something nice about somebody and God will bless you. &gt;&gt; If you go home and you eat preachers for lunch, eventually you're going to need one and you've digested them all. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Everybody said bring back brother Joel, brother Stewart. Now look, he said we he said God will bless you. We know it's possible to lose your first love. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; Your first love. What what do we say God first loved us? What is that first love? That first love is the strongest love that you've ever had. that beginning love. Brother Brandham said that the church in Revelation 2:4 says, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because I was left thy first love." That's the Ephesian church age. He said the church had lost their first love. He said the real cream that they had in the beginning. I won't hold you much longer, but listen to this. The real cream. &gt;&gt; I got thinking about that. My mind went back to milking a cow. And if you've ever milked cows, I milked cows by hand. I did that for years growing up. And we didn't learn much book knowledge, but we learned a lot about how to milk the cows and soft the hogs. And I milked this cow for years. And and I may not look much like it now, but we used to work hard, believe it or not. And uh uh we would we would I would milk this cow, and we had two cows. One of them was a Holene. If you know anything about cows, you know Holstein gives a real nice milk. A lot of milk because they've been bred for that. And then we had a Gernzie, half Gernzie, half Jersey mix. And a Jersey gives rich milk. Rich milk. In fact, a lot of people can't handle it. But I loved it. And what you did is you separated the milk from the cream. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Have you ever done that? Some of you elders have done that. Mom would take the milk and she'd separate that from the cream. But I wanted to shake it up. And if you got the Jersey milk, it's half cream. But the steward's looking at me like, "Where are you going with this?" Brother Brandon said, "They lost the real cream." &gt;&gt; And my mind went back to that because I it's hard to understand really what he's talking about, but the real cream, &gt;&gt; like there's nothing better than the real cream. &gt;&gt; If you've ever had cream in the milk, don't knock it until you tried it. If you've ever had raw milk that's that's got the cream in it out of a Jersey cow, you'll never go back. You talk about rich, buddy. That's the kind of love he wanted from his church. He wanted a rich love. Something that he could had some body to it. Something that could he could taste. Something he could Oh, God. some that made him sit on hard st rocks and and and meet in catacombs and and and praise him even though people had been killed that week and people have been fed to the lions and everything else yet they lifted their hands to him and worshiped just like we worship today. &gt;&gt; What was it? The real cream and oh God the real cream that they had at the beginning but as their churches got bigger and more comfortable and the and the and the hierarchy began to come in from the city the mayor started going there to church and things began to happen. What happened? and they lost the real cream. I pray we would never lose our first love. We would never lose the real cream. &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced that kind of love, you don't want to ever go back. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, "Ephesus was not a deceived church. It failed itself by not continuing in perfect love." He said, "You left that love you once had for them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings." I've always I watched that with my kids. You know, kids just like us. They backslide. they get cold on God. Watch how they want to go to church. Especially as they get older. I know our little ones never want to go to church, but especially as they get older, if you get that that desire, you just kind of have to drag them when they're teenagers. There's something else going on. It's not just that they don't want to be in church. A lot of times there's something else going on. Why? They've lost that love. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Lost that love. That's the time where they really need our prayers. &gt;&gt; Lost that love. that they used to have for good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings. They don't care about church anymore. Don't care about going to meetings. Don't care about about the people of God anymore. It's like bring back that love. &gt;&gt; You begin to kind of slide backwards that formal coming with our father nonsense. And he said, "My, I see you've left grace and faith and power to swap it for labor and works." Well, I tell you, brother Brandon, I help every widow woman I can. Well, that's a good thing. I commend you for that. But where's that first love you once had? Where's that joy you used to have? As David once cried, "Oh Lord, restore to me the joy of my salvation. Where's them all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks?" He said, "My goodness, the Bible's even dusty and got cobwebs on it. You read old love stories and news and things and things that ought be allowed to be published and put out for a trash can." And we Pentecostal people pick them up and just lost over them like a bunch of flies on a garbage can. &gt;&gt; You talk about a description. That's the way the internet is today. a bunch of stuff that shouldn't never be printed, &gt;&gt; right? And you're sitting there and people are consuming it like flies on a garbage can. That's right. Oh, mercy. All we need is back to our first love. Oh, church. You say, "Well, there's not very many people here, but Lord, take me back to my first love. Let me have revival kindled in my heart." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Like never before. So, I'm closing with this. Luke chapter 15 speaks of a woman who lost a coin. She began to search diligently. sweeping every corner until she found it. Brother Brandham explained that. He said there was wedding coins in the second coming of the Lord. Brother Brandon preaches on that and he explains how that they had a a tablet on their head. He said there were virtues that a that a woman had. The very first one that he mentions was love, right? The very first one was love. She'd been faithful. She'd been faithful to her husband. She'd done everything she knew to do. But somehow that coin got loose and come out over time. Oh God, I believe you're we're church. We're we're believers here tonight. We're we're real Christians. But sometimes that coin gets a little loose &gt;&gt; and it come out and it was getting darker. He said it was right about nighttime and her husband was coming home and he would think that the priest had removed the coin cuz she'd given her love to somebody else cuz the the fullness of those virtues. Those coins represented something. It represented that she still had her virtue, still had her love for her husband. It was like a wedding band would be to us. And so she diligently searched. Can you imagine if you lost? Now, you know, I I notice once in a while if my wife's got her wedding band on, but my wife always notices if I've got mine on. And I have a a problem. I have to be able to do this. If I can't do that, I have to get a new wedding band. So, that's changed over the years, you know, and I'm wearing one now. Cost me $40. But but it's just big enough I can take it on or off like that. But she don't want it off. So, I've learned to leave it on. Why? Why? Cuz I belong to her and she wants the world to know that. Jesus wants the world to know that you belong to him. &gt;&gt; And when you lose your love for the house of God, when you lose your love for the people of God, when you make decisions that cause you to be far away uh from the people of God in the house of God church, I don't mean just naturally. I mean far away in your heart. &gt;&gt; When you do those things, what happens? What happens? You find that when you recognize what it is that he loves you so much, you begin to diligently search with a candle and a broom. He said, "A c, oh my, a candle and a broom. A candle to shed light on every area of her house and a broom to get rid of what was wrong." And she goes through the house just a sweeping as hard as she could sweep. Dust flying out the windows. Why? She's looking for something that she lost. That's what we need is we know we're elected. We know we're predestined. But we don't want to be found without our love. Amen. &gt;&gt; The coin was so precious, precious love. Let's turn it around. We know when brother when Jesus gave that parable, he talked about the lost sheep and then he talked about the woman who lost the coin. You were that lost coin. If you think about it from God's perspective, he diligently came looking for you. As a song, he came looking for me when I could not come to where he was. He came looking for me. And that coin was so precious. You were so precious to him that he sent men like brother Biscll. And I thought today as I was listening to the man preach, you know, maybe that'll strike some heart. They'll go to a nominal church. Maybe that's a seed of God and they'll go for a while and it just be something they just not they're still hungry for something. And maybe God will use that to bring them to a nominal church. And then maybe they'll come across the message of the hour because men like brother Biscll and others I don't want to just call talk about him but he just passed away. Others who've went remember what they told brother Brandon when they were behind the curtain of time. They said if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; God didn't just predestinate the people. He predestinated a ministry to catch those people. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said behold I send you Elijah the prophet. Then if he's sending for me, brother Stern, he's sitting for all the elect. I don't know who the elect is. So let me spread my net wide. Let me catch as many as I can catch. &gt;&gt; Let me be one who sweeps the house looking for that last one. Cuz when the last one comes in, we'll be gone. In this age when the love of the majority as Peter comes and the musicians when the love of the majority has slowly gotten colder and colder, may our love for him and one another grow stronger every day. Let the cream be fresh. I I can't describe to you if you've never drank that. You just say, "Man, that's good. I can still taste it. It's fresh. I don't want to ever get stale. I don't want to ever get cold. I want the cream to be fresh in my life. I don't want to take the people for granted. I don't want to take the desire I have to serve God for granted because it could leave. You lose your love for the people and bad things begin to happen. I don't want to do that. It's a precious love. It's the love of God that constrains us. Not our own love, but the love of God that constrains us to love one another, even when we're unlovable sometimes. And yet, we love because it's the love of God beyond our own thinking, beyond our own feelings, beyond what we think. Oh, could you experience that kind of love? A rare love. If you got a husband that loves you or wife that loves you in spite of everything, you know that that love can never be broken. If you're sick, if you're not feeling well, no matter what happened, no matter no matter what would happen, you know, they would never forsake you. They would know God. Oh, that that's such a precious thing. You ought to thank God for that. Then how much should we thank him that he came and found us and there's nothing we could do to lose that love in our lives. There's nothing he loves us first. Oh, we may lose our love for him. It may grow cold, but he will not lose his love for us. And he will put his love in us if we allow him to do it. Don't take it for granted, church. It's precious love. Oh, so I want to worship him when I come to church. I'll just say this about our worship services. It's been real sweet, hasn't it been lately? It's a precious sense of the presence of God in the building. Let's never lose that. Said, "Brother Ben, you're trying to work people." No, it's during these times when sons are born, daughters are born in the house of God. It's during these moments when we worship and we give up all of our self and every thought of ourel and every thought of the world and say Lord change me make me new in those moments of refreshing as brother Brandon talked about going in at night time coming out with the dew falling oh may it be so in every service that we have I don't want to ever lose my desire to worship God with everything that I've got I may be going through hell but let me lift my hands and praise God because I know he won't leave me there he said I will not leave his soul in hell or suffer his a holy one to see corruption and I'm a part of that body. If he went to hell for me, I don't I won't stay even in the hell of this earth. I will. He will not leave me here, but he's coming to get me. Aren't you glad for that today? Aren't you glad he's coming for you? Hallelujah. Don't take it for granted. His love is precious love. Heavenly Father, our Jesus, I thank you for allowing me to speak today. And I pray that I got out of the way enough. Oh God, every service I second guess and think, what I I should have said that as I heard your prophets talk about it. He said, "We know there's lost people there and when they turn it down sometimes and criticize it, it makes you just feel so awful." But Lord, I pray that the word would find a resting place in every heart. Lord, that enough was said through lifts of clay that people would know uh that they need to search diligently if they've lost that love to find him. Pray you'd grant it. Oh God, we thank you for coming and searching diligently for us. And crying as you did in the garden, Adam, Adam, where art thou? Oh, we hear your voice tonight. We feel your pull. We thank you for it, Lord. Pray you just move over our congregation. Lord, you're doing something here. We may not see the fruit of it in every service or every day or every moment, but Lord, overall, I see a fruit of your presence. And Lord, of a maturing of the body, Lord, young people that love one another and older folks that love one another, I pray it would continue. Lord, may we we take these shields that you've given us and quench every fiery dart of the enemy. Lord, take the sword that you've given us, Lord, the sword of the word and fight through every Philistine. But we can get you a fresh drink of water, Pentecostal water. Oh, we thank you for it, Lord. We love you and we we just want to thank you for coming down among us today. Thank you for this time we spend in your presence in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Now, let's just worship him a minute. It's not very late. Just let's just worship him. Let's just give him our all for just a minute before we go. We're already here. We might as well worship him. Singing now. Oh yes.

With the music very soft now, let's sing the verse or the chorus rather. Oh my life you have been faithful. Oh, thank you Lord. All my life, you have been so so good.
