[46:28] Lord amen turn with me to Genesis
[46:31] chapter 49 it's good to have everybody
[46:33] out tonight on a Wednesday night I we've
[46:35] got some gone and some out on Wednesday
[46:38] but it's good to have you here tonight
[46:40] and good to have brother the Hatfield
[46:41] back there God bless you thank you for
[46:43] coming and brother Wendell and sister
[46:45] Fresca thank you all for coming tonight
[46:48] appreciate you being here it's hard to
[46:49] preach in front of some people but we
[46:51] just do our best amen Genesis chapter 49
[46:58] it says dan shall judge his people verse
[47:01] 16 as one of the tribes of Israel for
[47:05] those of you that are uh thinking I'm
[47:07] out of order here I'm taking these
[47:08] tribes in birth order not order of
[47:10] blessing in birth order Dan shall judge
[47:13] his people as one of the tribes of
[47:15] Israel Dan shall be a serpent by the way
[47:18] an adder in the path that biteth the
[47:20] horse heels so that his writers shall
[47:22] fall backward I have waited for thy
[47:25] salvation
[47:27] oh Lord I pray the Lord would add his
[47:28] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[47:30] as we get right into it
[47:32] tonight each one of Jacob's sons was
[47:35] named by the Holy Spirit through the
[47:39] pain of
[47:40] childbirth brother brandom taught us
[47:42] that names mean something in fact even
[47:45] titles mean something he said your
[47:47] pastor when he stands here on the
[47:49] platform ministering the word of God he
[47:51] is God's angel to the church the
[47:54] messenger to the church therefore a
[47:56] pastor should never leave that word but
[47:59] stay straight with the word because he's
[48:01] feeding the shepherd's place so that's
[48:04] our desire tonight is to stay right with
[48:06] the word and feed in the shepherd's
[48:08] place he said because the word pasture
[48:10] means Shepherd look it up and find out
[48:12] if that ain't right Pastor is a shepherd
[48:14] and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer
[48:16] over a certain flock to feed them with
[48:19] the word of God he said watch all those
[48:22] names they mean something every name in
[48:25] the Bible when you see one name in the
[48:26] Bible means something he said Israel's
[48:28] wives when they gave birth to the 12
[48:30] Patriarchs each one of those mothers
[48:32] when they were having the baby the baby
[48:35] was being born and them groaning right
[48:38] they were groaning from the pain of
[48:40] childbirth and he said the very groans
[48:43] that they gave signified the nature of
[48:45] the child and the place they'd make
[48:48] their final resting place he said every
[48:51] groan amen under the power of the Holy
[48:53] Ghost brother Bram goes on to tell us
[48:56] that that we should Gran under the power
[48:59] that it's necessary for us to groan
[49:02] under the power of the Holy Ghost and he
[49:04] even says that real tongues and
[49:07] interpretation will come from that he
[49:09] said real speaking in tongues comes from
[49:12] groaning under the power of the Holy
[49:13] Ghost and God does that many times
[49:16] through pain in our lives through
[49:19] difficult situations through hard times
[49:21] in the church and hard times in our
[49:23] families that God actually causes us to
[49:26] speak speak during that time and and
[49:28] it's that speech that is inspired not
[49:31] when we're on the mountain but the
[49:32] inspired speech was actually actually
[49:35] came through pain and and so we we
[49:37] should say thank you for the pain Lord
[49:40] thank you for the hard times thank you
[49:41] for the trouble thank you for the
[49:43] struggle in my life because it's during
[49:44] those moments mother Danny that I could
[49:47] actually speak what God wanted me to say
[49:50] Amen so the inspiration come during the
[49:53] hard times and I found that that's true
[49:56] amen so we're dealing tonight with
[49:59] Jacob's fifth son the seventh in
[50:01] blessing order who was Rachel's uh by
[50:05] her proxy BHA her handmade and his name
[50:09] was Dan Genesis 30 and5 says billal
[50:14] conceived and bear Jacob a son and
[50:17] Rachel said God hath judged me and hath
[50:20] also heard my voice and hath given me a
[50:23] son therefore she called his name
[50:27] Dan Dan means judge so when Jacob uh
[50:32] says in Genesis 49:16 Dan shall judge
[50:35] his people he's just using his name uh
[50:39] the name that was given him now the
[50:41] tribe of Dan was given an important spot
[50:44] in the land and remember that this
[50:47] parallels with our placing and our
[50:49] election so we want to pay a particular
[50:52] notice to this because sometimes we're
[50:54] given a spot that's very difficult we've
[50:57] talked about that already we're given a
[50:59] spot that's difficult to defend or a
[51:01] spot maybe that's got more Giants to
[51:03] face they were given a very difficult
[51:05] spot it was actually the spot on the
[51:08] coast if you can see that it's all the
[51:10] way on the Mediterranean Coast very
[51:12] close to uh the Philistine territory it
[51:15] was actually originally the land of the
[51:18] amorites it was the place where the
[51:20] amorites came from and they were the
[51:22] great enemies of God's people and so
[51:25] they would have to fight for that land
[51:27] and we got to fight for every inch of
[51:29] our land but there was a special fight
[51:32] that was given to them and and we got to
[51:34] remember what we fight is not always
[51:37] what somebody else fights
[51:39] right every family every individual
[51:43] every church every area of the country
[51:45] we all fight something different we're
[51:47] all fighting for the same thing our
[51:49] position in the land and you say well I
[51:52] could go somewhere else and and you'll
[51:54] find out that's actually what Dan did
[51:56] just to give you kind of a sneak preview
[51:58] they actually tried just to move
[51:59] somewhere else and and it would be
[52:02] better but that don't always fix things
[52:04] sometimes you just got to fight and win
[52:06] where you're at and you have the ability
[52:08] to win we've got the ability to win it's
[52:11] not time to jump ship it's time to fight
[52:13] the battle and keep on CU all he asked
[52:15] us to do is be faithful and his the
[52:17] results would matter with him he'll
[52:19] bring the results I'm so glad for that
[52:21] today cuz sometimes you can't see a way
[52:23] out you don't know why you're doing what
[52:25] you're doing yeah
[52:27] right when when when uh we've talked
[52:29] about it before but when they moved to
[52:31] Bethlehem when Rahab and her husband
[52:33] went to bethleem and founded that City
[52:36] they didn't know why they were digging a
[52:37] well they didn't know why they were uh
[52:40] maybe making a stable in a cave but the
[52:42] well would be one oh my the well would
[52:45] be one that David would long for the
[52:46] water from Hallelujah and the cave would
[52:49] be one maybe that that they had maybe
[52:51] dug it out by hand it would be maybe the
[52:53] one that Jesus was laid in and it
[52:55] happened hundred of years later so don't
[52:57] give up what you're doing keep digging
[52:59] keep working keep coming to church on
[53:02] Wednesday night cuz you never know what
[53:05] you might be doing for future
[53:06] Generations if the Lord
[53:09] terries so Dan was placed in a very
[53:13] particular uh situation to judge the
[53:16] enemies of God yeah and so in Genesis
[53:21] 15:16 uh God speaking to Abraham and
[53:24] saying how long of a time that the
[53:26] Israel ites would be in Egypt he said
[53:29] but in the fourth generation they shall
[53:30] come hither again for the iniquity of
[53:33] the amorites is not yet full brother
[53:36] Brown says it this way he told Abraham
[53:37] over in that land of the amorites their
[53:39] iniquity they were Gentiles now he said
[53:41] I can take you in there right now or I
[53:43] can't take you in there right now cuz
[53:45] the iniquity is not fold fold up yet he
[53:48] said but I will judge them I'll come in
[53:50] that fourth generation and I'll judge
[53:52] that Nation with a rod of iron this was
[53:54] the task given to Dan he was born in
[53:59] place to judge the amorites and his
[54:03] standard was the Flying Eagle he was the
[54:06] seventh in the blessing order so I think
[54:09] it has a lot to do with the age that we
[54:11] live in and the time that we've come to
[54:13] now uh he he could he should have soared
[54:16] above and and overcome and did all that
[54:19] but he couldn't do it and I think it was
[54:21] because as a tribe they just never could
[54:24] get over or conquer
[54:26] themselves and so they never did and we
[54:29] know that these things are written for
[54:30] our admonition because we have a Helper
[54:33] and remember that they didn't have the
[54:34] helper that we have we have the baptism
[54:37] of the Holy Ghost to help us to take our
[54:39] land so I don't want us to get
[54:40] discouraged by each of these tribes as
[54:43] they didn't do what God called them to
[54:44] do or didn't take their land they were
[54:46] only a type of what we're supposed to be
[54:49] the reality of that we're supposed to
[54:51] actually move in and take our land there
[54:54] will be somebody that takes a Rapture
[54:56] somebody
[54:57] is going to do that there's going to be
[54:58] a people we might as well be us we might
[55:01] as well be the ones and believe that
[55:03] there's a possibility we can do
[55:05] that so they they should have done it
[55:08] now uh in Joshua 1940 when Joshua was
[55:11] dividing up the land it says the seventh
[55:13] lot came out for the tribe of the
[55:15] children of Dan according to their
[55:17] families and the coast of their
[55:18] inheritance was Zora and ishall and
[55:21] erimish I have no idea if that's how you
[55:23] pronounce it but you don't know either
[55:26] so we'll just move
[55:28] on and if you go on down all the way to
[55:30] verse 47 he goes on to name about 17
[55:33] cities if I counted correctly used all
[55:36] my fingers and toes to do that in Joshua
[55:40] 1947 it says the coast of the children
[55:42] of Dan and so they had all these cities
[55:45] that were in their territory went out
[55:48] too little for them so with all of that
[55:51] they still needed more yeah therefore
[55:53] the children of Dan went up to fight
[55:55] against leim and took it and smote it
[55:57] with the edge of the sword and possessed
[55:58] it and dwelt therein and called leim Dan
[56:01] after the name of Dan their father so
[56:03] they have a territory given to them and
[56:06] a city that they've taken and called
[56:09] Dan now if you fast forward 300 years
[56:13] from the time of Joshua to the time of
[56:16] the
[56:17] judges you'll find that they did not
[56:20] possess even the city they named
[56:24] Dan in fact the Bible says that the
[56:26] amorites forced the children of Dan into
[56:30] the
[56:30] mountain for they would not suffer them
[56:34] to come down to the valley they were
[56:37] actually a tribe that was forced to camp
[56:39] out in the mountains I know some of
[56:41] y'all like to camp out but and you like
[56:44] to burn up the woods and stuff like that
[56:46] but but but but some of us you know my
[56:48] wife you can't hardly pay her to Camp
[56:50] she wants to camp in with a bed she
[56:52] wants to Camp with a an RV or something
[56:55] like that she don't want to camp in a
[56:56] tent but these people weren't doing it
[56:58] voluntarily they were forced to camp and
[57:01] they were camped out in the mountains
[57:03] because they could not take their land
[57:06] right and so you know and it affects
[57:08] your life because you you've got to be
[57:10] able to walk on the Promises you got to
[57:12] be able to take the land that's been
[57:14] given we have great and precious
[57:16] promises this day but you got to be able
[57:18] to walk out and take it you got to have
[57:20] something about you some Faith to be
[57:22] able to do that come on and some some
[57:25] purpose and some perseverance and some
[57:28] and some
[57:29] willingness right you can't just sit
[57:31] back and say well I'm predestined they
[57:32] were predestined to that land too but
[57:34] you got to be able to go out and take it
[57:36] but he said there would be a people in
[57:38] this age that would go out and take
[57:40] it so so they were forced to camp out in
[57:43] the mountains now during that time
[57:45] remember Dan means judge and there was
[57:49] an angel who appeared to a danite couple
[57:52] to tell them of a special birth and
[57:54] you've all heard the story and I won't
[57:55] go through it all tonight but the child
[57:57] was Samson the woman bear a son in in
[58:00] judges 13:24 and called his name Samson
[58:04] and the child grew and the Lord blessed
[58:06] him and the spirit of the Lord began to
[58:08] move him at times in the camp of Dan
[58:12] right they don't have any place to call
[58:14] home just a camp between Zora and
[58:20] Esa and so brother Bram tells us about
[58:23] Samson and I won't get too deep into
[58:25] that tonight
[58:26] I want to save it for another time but
[58:28] he said we find that this Samson was a
[58:29] Nazarite he had seven little curls that
[58:32] hung down his back he said when the
[58:34] spirit of the Lord came upon him he
[58:36] feared nothing oh come on I like that
[58:39] brother BR tells us he was just a little
[58:40] shrimp but when the spirit of the Lord
[58:42] came on him he feared all that we could
[58:44] be like that tonight he feared nothing
[58:48] he said and and he said why he was
[58:51] persistent as long as he could feel that
[58:54] Nazarite vow with him he said as long as
[58:56] he could reach back here and feel those
[58:58] locks he knew he was in the will of God
[59:01] and nothing could bind him the city
[59:04] couldn't bind him a lion couldn't kill
[59:07] him he took the Jawbone of a mule and it
[59:09] dry and beat down a thousand Philistines
[59:12] with
[59:13] it he said on down he said how much
[59:15] ought the church tonight that claims
[59:17] that you're born of the spirit of God
[59:19] stand in the meeting see the Vindication
[59:21] of the resurrected Jesus Christ and
[59:23] claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[59:25] could sit still and let Satan push you
[59:27] around like he does you say well I
[59:29] haven't seen much I tell you what I've
[59:30] seen enough to tell me that God's real
[59:33] that he's the same yesterday today and
[59:35] forever I've seen the Vindication of God
[59:37] in this hour and so I have an obligation
[59:39] to stand for that word to stand up for
[59:42] what I believe and and to be more than
[59:45] just a a a push around for the
[59:48] enemy right we got to stop doing that
[59:51] you young men you got to get to a place
[59:53] where you push the devil around come on
[59:56] now where he pushes you around all the
[59:58] time our young families we you know we
[1:00:00] get pushed around everything the devil
[1:00:02] brings on us we say well I'm scared of
[1:00:04] this I'm scared of that we got to quit
[1:00:05] letting the devil push us around and
[1:00:07] begin to push the devil
[1:00:11] around he said it's a strange thing as
[1:00:14] long as you could Fe as long long as you
[1:00:17] can feel the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] know that it's his word and his promise
[1:00:24] for this day you should be be persistent
[1:00:27] oh I think every service when we feel
[1:00:29] his presence here among us we ought to
[1:00:31] be persistent to press in until it's
[1:00:34] over oh if we could only do that
[1:00:36] perseverance stay with it God promised
[1:00:38] it it's not you it's God he reach back
[1:00:42] there and feel his locks but you
[1:00:44] remember what
[1:00:46] happened he lost his
[1:00:49] locks right gave the key to his locks to
[1:00:53] Delilah and gave her his secret yeah
[1:00:56] laying in the lap of Delah a type of the
[1:00:58] world he never does deliver the people
[1:01:01] the way Gideon did or Jeff or Deborah
[1:01:05] right or any of the other judges he
[1:01:08] never does deliver the people like the
[1:01:09] others he couldn't win the battle with
[1:01:14] himself and his greatest Victory comes
[1:01:17] when he finally he finally gets past
[1:01:20] himself and he dies in his greatest
[1:01:23] Victory right but the people are never
[1:01:25] delivered in the way that they are with
[1:01:28] Gideon or jeffa and Genesis
[1:01:32] 49:16 it says again I want to just read
[1:01:35] this so you'll understand this is I
[1:01:37] believe a prophecy of of of Samson as
[1:01:40] well he said Dan shall judge his people
[1:01:43] as one of the tribes of
[1:01:45] Israel but then look at the next verse
[1:01:47] Dan shall be a serpent by the way an
[1:01:50] adder in the path that biteth the horse
[1:01:52] heels yeah so that his rider shall fall
[1:01:55] backward
[1:01:57] and I want to challenge you young men
[1:01:59] just to kind of use a a play on words we
[1:02:01] know the head of the serpent was to be
[1:02:02] crushed by the woman se but Samson
[1:02:06] couldn't deal with
[1:02:08] himself right and and no matter how
[1:02:11] strong you are how anointed you are how
[1:02:14] predestined you are what family you come
[1:02:18] from now some of you know what I'm
[1:02:19] talking about tonight no matter what
[1:02:22] what how many times you've been in
[1:02:23] church maybe you're raised on a church
[1:02:25] pew and laid under it as a child maybe
[1:02:28] you broke your leg with somebody
[1:02:30] shouting on the church pew I know of
[1:02:32] somebody that actually had that happen
[1:02:33] you know and and and you you might have
[1:02:36] been in church all of your life and
[1:02:37] people may have think well you're a
[1:02:39] wonderful person but you got to have a
[1:02:41] new birth you've got to be able to take
[1:02:43] advantage you got to have the one who
[1:02:45] crushed the head of the serpent living
[1:02:48] in you or you'll never be able to
[1:02:49] overcome that part of you that will
[1:02:52] cause you to
[1:02:54] lose right to give in
[1:02:56] to give up and to not be able to fulfill
[1:02:59] your
[1:03:00] potential there's a part of you
[1:03:03] that it's like a snake you're born that
[1:03:06] way with that in your heart and it's got
[1:03:08] to be overcome by the New
[1:03:10] Birth the Holy Ghost brother BR said is
[1:03:13] a gift of God that comes upon you that
[1:03:17] changes you and I as I read this brother
[1:03:19] Stuart I got really burdened for our
[1:03:20] young people especially for our young
[1:03:22] men you know you got to have the Holy
[1:03:24] Ghost you got to have it you can't
[1:03:27] you're not going to be able it's going
[1:03:29] the persecution as far as the world goes
[1:03:32] the the Easy Living you'd say well I'm
[1:03:34] waiting on persecution to come we're
[1:03:36] living it it's all around us waiting on
[1:03:40] a squeeze you're living in the squeeze
[1:03:42] it's hard for people to go to church
[1:03:43] it's hard for them to be be a message
[1:03:45] believer and the devil's trying to tell
[1:03:46] you the little things don't matter
[1:03:48] anymore that's what brother Brown taught
[1:03:50] us about discre and those things how
[1:03:52] that those things wouldn't people
[1:03:53] wouldn't matter to people but but you
[1:03:55] got have the Holy Ghost to stand for the
[1:03:57] message when it doesn't make
[1:04:00] sense right when the preacher don't make
[1:04:03] sense and when Church don't make sense
[1:04:05] and it doesn't make Financial sense to
[1:04:07] go and it doesn't make the sense to you
[1:04:09] in any way and yet you there's something
[1:04:11] in your heart it says I'm going to live
[1:04:12] for God anyway I'm going to I'm going to
[1:04:15] touch I'm going to cry out to God anyway
[1:04:17] I'm going to pray
[1:04:18] anyway in spite of
[1:04:22] everything so you got to have that
[1:04:25] brother s gift of God that comes upon
[1:04:26] you that changes you makes you allog
[1:04:29] together different from what the world
[1:04:31] is and what the other people are you are
[1:04:35] different you don't have to dress any
[1:04:37] different you don't have to put on a
[1:04:39] round collar and a long robe you live

[1:05:14] what was that in that Samson what was in
[1:05:16] that Samson a woman Chaser sure he said

[1:05:24] father and mother they told him not to
[1:05:26] go down there with that woman at Jezebel
[1:05:28] but he wouldn't listen to him what was
[1:05:30] it Samson had
[1:05:34] strength oh church I I hope you're
[1:05:37] hearing me tonight just because we can
[1:05:38] play in church play a m instrument
[1:05:41] doesn't mean we're where we're supposed
[1:05:42] to be come on just because we can take
[1:05:45] up an offering doesn't mean that we're
[1:05:47] where we're supposed to be just because
[1:05:49] we can look good and act good around the
[1:05:51] church doesn't mean we're where we're
[1:05:53] supposed to be Samson gave gave God his
[1:05:58] strength but he gave his heart to
[1:06:01] Delilah so I want to challenge you
[1:06:03] tonight and ask you as we're talking
[1:06:04] about this tribe of Dan that never did
[1:06:06] fulfill what God wanted them to do have
[1:06:08] you given your heart to God have you
[1:06:11] given him your heart have you
[1:06:12] surrendered your heart to him or have
[1:06:13] you just given him your maybe lip
[1:06:15] service maybe you just gave him well I
[1:06:18] was baptized maybe you maybe a giv well
[1:06:20] I I I've been in the church for a while
[1:06:22] and everything seemed to be going good
[1:06:23] so I I think I'm probably a Christian
[1:06:26] what are you giving him tonight you
[1:06:28] might as well give him your all you
[1:06:30] young men might as well give him your
[1:06:32] all you young ladies might as well give
[1:06:33] him your all older folks All Of Us
[1:06:35] Together We ought to give him everything
[1:06:37] that we have he said but it's just
[1:06:39] Wednesday night brother Ben we ought to
[1:06:41] give him all of her heart on a Wednesday
[1:06:46] night he wouldn't give his heart to God
[1:06:50] he give that to
[1:06:51] Delilah brother Bron said God has an
[1:06:53] awful time getting a fellow to yield to
[1:06:55] him
[1:06:57] right and that's what it is is just
[1:07:01] yielding just
[1:07:04] yielding that that that that will
[1:07:06] entitle You full obedience yielding to
[1:07:10] the word of God entitles you to the
[1:07:13] Token God has an awful time getting a
[1:07:15] fellow and if you're that fellow sitting
[1:07:17] here tonight you might as well give in
[1:07:19] amen might as well just let him have
[1:07:21] full control all right yes get fell a
[1:07:25] yield to him like Samson Samson was kind
[1:07:27] of a ladies man he yielded his strength
[1:07:30] to God but wouldn't give his heart to
[1:07:31] God right he give that to the and that's
[1:07:33] all God could use was his strength and
[1:07:36] just as much as you'll give to him
[1:07:38] that's what he can use of you and so
[1:07:39] many people are fooled by that because
[1:07:42] Samson could look at his life and say
[1:07:44] well I picked up door the gates of the
[1:07:46] city yes sir and I was anointed to do it
[1:07:49] and he
[1:07:51] was and then go and go down with a
[1:07:54] prostitute yeah right I felt good in
[1:07:57] church I've been told that in counseling
[1:08:00] that someone commit an awful sin and
[1:08:02] then then come say well I I I thought it
[1:08:04] was okay because I I still raised my
[1:08:06] hands and felt the presence of God in
[1:08:09] church but just because you're anointed
[1:08:11] doesn't mean you're saved just because
[1:08:14] you can do play music and and and gifts
[1:08:16] and callings are without repentance just
[1:08:18] because you can preach doesn't mean
[1:08:19] you're saved but you got to give your
[1:08:21] heart to God hallah do it with all your
[1:08:24] heart and you might as well well because
[1:08:26] you you can't exist in that in between
[1:08:28] place where you're back and forth and
[1:08:29] waffling and you cause problems in the
[1:08:32] church and problems everywhere you go
[1:08:34] problems in a marriage problems at home
[1:08:36] why because you just can't decide who
[1:08:38] you are what you want to be you might as
[1:08:41] well give up and let God take
[1:08:43] him that part was
[1:08:47] free good just as much as you'll give to
[1:08:50] him that's what he can use of you he
[1:08:51] said let's just give all to him could we
[1:08:53] do that tonight say here I am Lord just
[1:08:56] take
[1:08:57] me because Samson wouldn't give him his
[1:09:00] heart he ended up a blind prisoner
[1:09:02] standing between two pillars can you
[1:09:04] imagine what he must have been
[1:09:06] thinking God raised Samson up to destroy
[1:09:08] that nation that was the very purpose of
[1:09:10] bringing him on brand said if God can
[1:09:12] only find one man that's all he needs
[1:09:16] one man that can fully surrender someone
[1:09:18] say it with me fully surrender one man I
[1:09:22] want to be that man tonight I want to be
[1:09:24] that man if I haven't been that man let
[1:09:25] me be that man amen I can fully
[1:09:29] surrender Oh my he said and everything
[1:09:33] fully surrender to him he don't take an
[1:09:35] army he never did use that he only uses
[1:09:37] a man now Samson gave God his strength
[1:09:40] to use but he didn't give God his heart
[1:09:41] he give his heart to Delilah give his
[1:09:42] strength to God but you got to surrender
[1:09:44] soul body Spirit strength everything you
[1:09:48] are to the will of God become a prisoner
[1:09:51] to him you're going to be somebody's
[1:09:52] prisoner see Samson ended up being the
[1:09:54] philistine prisoner but when he
[1:09:56] surrendered himself oh church when he
[1:09:59] surrendered himself completely to God he
[1:10:01] was no man's prisoner anymore but he
[1:10:03] committed himself over to God you don't
[1:10:07] belong to yourself you're either the
[1:10:09] devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's
[1:10:11] prisoner to righteous you're one or the
[1:10:14] other but Samson never gained that
[1:10:17] complete Victory and the danites never
[1:10:18] did possess the ground that God gave
[1:10:21] them in Moses blessing in Deuteronomy 33
[1:10:24] he speaks of the danites he says of Dan
[1:10:27] he said Dan is a lion's welp he shall
[1:10:30] leap from Bashan he's a church
[1:10:34] Hopper that's not
[1:10:36] inspired come
[1:10:38] on just
[1:10:40] me man
[1:10:43] leaped what's actually what they did
[1:10:46] they actually moved from their land and
[1:10:48] you see where their land was it's down
[1:10:50] about the middle over on the coast and
[1:10:53] so they they just couldn't take
[1:10:56] and so they moved all the way to the
[1:10:57] northernmost part of
[1:11:00] Israel and until their name actually
[1:11:03] becomes synonymous with the farthest
[1:11:05] reaches of Israel in First Kings 4:25 it
[1:11:09] says and you've heard this expression
[1:11:10] before Judah and Israel dwelt safely
[1:11:12] every man under his Vine under his fig
[1:11:14] tree from Dan even to beerseba that's
[1:11:17] the northernmost part of Israel to the
[1:11:19] southernmost part of
[1:11:21] Israel all the days of Solomon so the
[1:11:25] the story of their move is found in
[1:11:26] judges
[1:11:27] 18 and you remember Samson was in
[1:11:30] chapter 16 and then in chapter 17 there
[1:11:35] there's a a man named Micah it's a
[1:11:37] really strange and kind of funny story
[1:11:41] uh of a man who uh who uh was a levite
[1:11:46] and and he come by a house the house of
[1:11:48] a man named Micah so basically Micah
[1:11:51] bought himself an evangelist
[1:11:56] I'm a pastor so it's easy to say that
[1:11:58] you know Micah bought himself an
[1:12:00] evangelist go read the story when you
[1:12:01] have time and and he bought him for 10
[1:12:04] shekels and a
[1:12:06] suit 10 Joel's about to get up and go
[1:12:10] you know 10 10 shekels in a suit you
[1:12:14] know he's going to just and in judges
[1:12:17] 17:13 he said then said Micah now know I
[1:12:20] that the Lord will do me good seeing I
[1:12:21] have a levite to my priest he made him a
[1:12:23] house Church
[1:12:25] set up church and just said we're going
[1:12:27] to start our own denomination we got a
[1:12:28] levite and he gathered some
[1:12:31] Idols he put them there with the
[1:12:35] levite see we are not hirelings we've
[1:12:37] not been hired to
[1:12:40] preach we've been called to
[1:12:43] preach in Judges chapter 18 it says and
[1:12:47] so that happened in chapter 17 in
[1:12:48] chapter 18 in those days there was no
[1:12:50] king in Israel and in those days the
[1:12:52] tribe of the danites sought them an
[1:12:54] inheritance to dwell
[1:12:55] For unto that day all their inheritance
[1:12:57] had not Fallen unto them among the
[1:13:00] tribes of Israel and the children of Dan
[1:13:04] sent of their family five men from their
[1:13:06] Coast Men of Valor from Zora and from
[1:13:08] eall remember that's where Samson was
[1:13:10] despy out the land to search it and they
[1:13:13] said unto them go search the land who
[1:13:15] when they came to Mount Ephraim to the
[1:13:18] house of Micah they lodged there they
[1:13:21] come by this same house
[1:13:23] church when they were by the house of
[1:13:25] Micah they knew the voice of the young
[1:13:26] man the levite Evangelist and they
[1:13:29] turned in thither and said to him what
[1:13:31] who brought thee hither and what makest
[1:13:32] thou in this place and what hast thou
[1:13:34] here and he said unto them thus and thus
[1:13:36] dealth Micah with me and hath hired me
[1:13:39] and I am his priest and they said unto
[1:13:42] him ask counsel of God that we may know
[1:13:44] whether our way which we go shall be
[1:13:46] prosperous and the priest said unto them
[1:13:48] go in peace before the Lord is your way
[1:13:51] wherein you go I don't think he
[1:13:52] consulted the scripture I don't think he
[1:13:55] consulted Joshua's they were not meant
[1:13:57] to be placed in that land in fact the
[1:13:59] land they were going to was part of
[1:14:01] another tribe's territory come on it
[1:14:04] wasn't supposed to belong to them but
[1:14:07] they were going to go take it or so they
[1:14:08] thought they were and so on the way
[1:14:10] there they go by Micah's house and and
[1:14:14] he his priest tells him what they want
[1:14:16] to hear so they steal his images and and
[1:14:19] his
[1:14:21] priest and so the priest the left for a
[1:14:24] bigger Church I
[1:14:27] mean he did the Bible says these went in
[1:14:30] Micah's House fetch the carved image and
[1:14:32] the ephod and the ter from the molten
[1:14:33] image and said to the priest to them
[1:14:35] what do you and they said unto him hold
[1:14:36] thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth
[1:14:39] quit preaching for a minute go with us
[1:14:41] be to us a father and a priest is it
[1:14:43] better for thee to be a priest into the
[1:14:44] house of one man or that thou be a
[1:14:46] priest to a tribe big church come
[1:14:50] on family in I'm goingon to get myself
[1:14:53] in trouble tonight well Wendell I'm
[1:14:57] sorry and and the priest's heart was
[1:15:00] glad and he took the ephod and the teram
[1:15:02] and the Graven image and went in the
[1:15:04] midst of the people he's just oh I'm so
[1:15:07] happy I got to go to this bigger
[1:15:10] group but look at verse 27 they took the
[1:15:12] things which Micah had made and the
[1:15:14] priest which he had and came unto leish
[1:15:16] unto a people that were quiet and secure
[1:15:20] and they smoke them with the edge of the
[1:15:22] sword and burnt the city with fire just
[1:15:25] because you can possess a territory now
[1:15:28] listen there's a scriptural principle
[1:15:30] here just because you can do something
[1:15:32] doesn't mean you
[1:15:35] should they could not possess what was
[1:15:37] given them so they went to possess
[1:15:40] someone
[1:15:41] else's and they were able to do it right
[1:15:45] but it didn't make it
[1:15:47] right and the Bible says that there was
[1:15:49] no deliverer because it was far from
[1:15:51] zidon and and and they had no business
[1:15:54] with any man it was in the valley that
[1:15:55] lth by Beth Rob and they built a city
[1:15:58] and dwelt therein they called the name
[1:15:59] of the city Dan after the name of Dan
[1:16:02] their father who was born unto Israel
[1:16:05] how be it the name of C the city was
[1:16:06] leish at the first and the children of
[1:16:09] Dan set up the Graven image and Jonathan
[1:16:12] the son of gersam the son of Manasseh he
[1:16:14] and his sons were priests to the tribe
[1:16:16] of Dan until the day of the Captivity of
[1:16:18] the land and they set them up Micah's
[1:16:20] grave and image which he made all the
[1:16:22] time that the house of God was in shoh
[1:16:24] it looked L like they were very
[1:16:26] prosperous in what they did and the
[1:16:28] tribe of Dan did well in their new
[1:16:31] territory but they were the very first
[1:16:33] Israelite tribe to embrace
[1:16:37] idolatry okay the very
[1:16:40] first now fast forward a few hundred
[1:16:43] more years there's a king named jeroboam
[1:16:47] remember the kingdom split between north
[1:16:49] and
[1:16:51] south and there's a king named jeroboam
[1:16:54] over over the northern part Israel the
[1:16:57] 10 tribes 10 Northern tribes including
[1:17:00] Dan and jeroboam said in his heart he
[1:17:03] said now shall the kingdom return to the
[1:17:05] House of David he's thinking how can I
[1:17:08] keep my kingdom how can I build my
[1:17:12] kingdom and make it last okay so this is
[1:17:16] what he says in his heart he says if
[1:17:18] they go up to this Jerusalem then the
[1:17:22] heart of the people will return to the
[1:17:23] Lord even to rabom King of Judah they
[1:17:26] shall kill me and go again to rabom King
[1:17:28] of Judah so it's a political
[1:17:30] move right yeah we shouldn't think like
[1:17:33] that church and I know I know it's done
[1:17:36] but we shouldn't do things out of
[1:17:37] politics but because it's the right
[1:17:39] thing to do God don't move by
[1:17:43] politics but too many times preachers
[1:17:45] move out of politics we shouldn't do
[1:17:47] that God help us amen and the King took
[1:17:51] counsel made two calves of gold and said
[1:17:53] to them it is too much for you to go up
[1:17:54] to to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods so I
[1:17:57] love that he makes it easy for them you
[1:18:00] and you see the the way that they're
[1:18:02] going you young people see that here
[1:18:04] what was it Samson took the easy route
[1:18:08] ended up a
[1:18:09] prisoner right it was too hard for him
[1:18:13] maybe to not not do what he did and so
[1:18:15] he he took the easy route and ends up a
[1:18:17] prisoner the danites took the easy route
[1:18:20] and instead of taking their land they
[1:18:21] moved off and took somebody else's right
[1:18:24] Jobo takes the easy route and tells the
[1:18:26] people he said hey it's so far to go to
[1:18:29] Jerusalem it it's too much to have a
[1:18:32] move of the Holy Ghost in the church on
[1:18:35] it's too much to to preach the new birth
[1:18:38] it's too much to preach the the presence
[1:18:40] of God and and that we need Holiness in
[1:18:43] our lives and that the message is still
[1:18:45] the same and that that we don't get the
[1:18:48] opportunity to change it's too much come
[1:18:50] on now right so why don't you go up to
[1:18:54] he said behold thy Gods it's too much
[1:18:57] yeah to preach things the way brother
[1:18:59] brandham taught them it's too much to
[1:19:02] stay with the law of Moses so let's just
[1:19:04] let's just make a new God come on Behold
[1:19:07] thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up
[1:19:09] out of the land of
[1:19:12] Egypt and he set the one in bethl that's
[1:19:16] in Ephraim and the other put he in
[1:19:20] Dan and this thing become because the
[1:19:23] northernmost tribes could go there
[1:19:25] yeah made it easy on them this thing
[1:19:27] become a sin for the people went to
[1:19:30] worship before the one even unto
[1:19:36] Dan so the idolatry that was had already
[1:19:39] been introduced and then Jobo brings it
[1:19:42] in and sets it up a pagan form of of
[1:19:46] Judaism a pagan form of of their
[1:19:50] religion and God never did forget it
[1:19:53] right so brother Brandon come we we come
[1:19:55] all the way around now you think well
[1:19:57] brother BR are you just preaching this
[1:19:58] without any backup in the message no
[1:20:01] because brother brandom in the seventh
[1:20:03] seal deals with these tribes now if you
[1:20:07] go to and I don't have time tonight to
[1:20:08] to go there and read it but Revelation 7
[1:20:11] you'll find two tribes are missing from
[1:20:13] the list of tribes that are represented
[1:20:15] in the 144,000 Jews now how many know
[1:20:18] what the 144,000 Jews are are they are
[1:20:21] the ones who are uh saved during the
[1:20:23] tribulation period
[1:20:25] right that that Israel saved as a nation
[1:20:27] during that time right that that see his
[1:20:30] nail scars and Christ appears all of
[1:20:32] those things that happened during the
[1:20:33] tribulation period after the gospel goes
[1:20:36] back to the Jews so the 144,000
[1:20:40] Jews are represented by tribe but God
[1:20:44] actually takes out Dan and Ephraim out
[1:20:46] of the Revelation and puts in uh puts in
[1:20:50] Joseph and
[1:20:51] Levi now brother brand tells us why he
[1:20:56] said Revelation 7 Dan and Ephraim is
[1:20:57] missing and not numbered with them did
[1:20:59] you notice that Joseph and Levi were
[1:21:00] substituted in their place why the ever
[1:21:03] remembering God remembers every promise
[1:21:06] amen of his word so in the seventh seal
[1:21:10] brother Bram takes us to Deuteronomy
[1:21:11] chapter 29 are you still with me tonight
[1:21:13] I I don't want to bore you on he said he
[1:21:16] said for you know how we have dwelt in
[1:21:18] the land of Egypt and how he came
[1:21:20] through the Nations which you passed by
[1:21:22] you've seen their Abominations you've
[1:21:23] seen their denom nationalism and their
[1:21:25] idols and wood and stone and silver and
[1:21:27] gold oh which were among the church we
[1:21:29] don't want to go back we don't want to
[1:21:32] go back we want to go forward we want to
[1:21:33] go
[1:21:34] up so but you said you saw the idols he
[1:21:38] said L there should be among you man or
[1:21:42] woman or family or tribe whose heart
[1:21:47] turneth away this day notice what turned
[1:21:50] the heart brother B said that Samson
[1:21:52] gave God he gave God his strength but he
[1:21:55] gave Delilah his heart and he said if
[1:21:58] there if idolatry starts in the
[1:22:00] heart listen don't you put nothing in
[1:22:03] front of God
[1:22:04] amen amen don't let anything else have
[1:22:07] your heart
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:14] hallelujah L there should be among you
[1:22:16] man or woman or family or tribe whose
[1:22:19] heart turth away yes a heart turn away
[1:22:22] you don't you just don't want it anymore
[1:22:24] the desire the heart is your
[1:22:27] desire you just don't want the things of
[1:22:29] God you just you begin to want the
[1:22:31] things of the world whose heart turneth
[1:22:33] away they stay from the Lord Our God to
[1:22:34] go and serve the gods of these nations
[1:22:37] lest there should be among you a root
[1:22:38] that beareth Gall and warmwood and it
[1:22:41] come to pass when he hear the words of
[1:22:42] this curse he bless himself in his heart
[1:22:45] like some people hear preaching and they
[1:22:47] never get
[1:22:50] it right it just he hears the word but
[1:22:53] He blesses him self he hears the word
[1:22:56] about idolatry he says it's not me but
[1:22:59] it is
[1:23:02] yeah and and and that he bless himself
[1:23:04] in his heart saying I shall have peace
[1:23:06] though I walk in the imagination of my
[1:23:08] heart to add drunkenness to thirst
[1:23:11] brother BR said even even they'll drink
[1:23:13] and not think anything about it yeah
[1:23:16] drink alcohol and claim to be Christian
[1:23:18] go to church claim to have the Holy
[1:23:20] Ghost he said the Lord will not spare
[1:23:23] him but then the anger of the Lord and
[1:23:25] his jealousy shall smoke against that
[1:23:27] man and all the curses that are written
[1:23:28] in this book shall lie upon him and the
[1:23:30] Lord shall blot out his name from under
[1:23:33] Heaven and the Lord shall separate him
[1:23:35] unto evil out of all the tribes of
[1:23:37] Israel according to all the curses of
[1:23:38] the Covenant that are written in the
[1:23:39] book of the law I know it's heavy right
[1:23:41] now but we're coming to A A better part
[1:23:44] A glimmer of
[1:23:47] hope but brother Brown said did you
[1:23:49] notice it was to be blotted out why
[1:23:51] under Heaven there was no immediate
[1:23:53] sacrifice that could give him the Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit he said to let him see these
[1:23:59] things you realize what a blessing it is
[1:24:01] to have the Holy Spirit and conviction
[1:24:03] in our hearts what a blessing it is to
[1:24:06] know when you're wrong what a blessing
[1:24:08] it is to be able to go on a Wednesday
[1:24:09] night and feel that conviction in your
[1:24:11] heart don't don't just bypass that
[1:24:13] that's important yes sir it's the Holy
[1:24:15] Ghost it's the work of the Holy Ghost In
[1:24:17] Your Heart yeah you're going to do some
[1:24:18] things that aren't right you're going to
[1:24:19] fall along the way make mistakes and
[1:24:21] things like that but there's something
[1:24:23] in your heart you immediately repent why
[1:24:25] you have the Holy
[1:24:28] ghostless
[1:24:29] hallelujah amen good if you don't have
[1:24:32] him you can't see right so true so true
[1:24:37] you can't see your own heart you can't
[1:24:38] see your own attitudes you can't see
[1:24:40] your own motives
[1:24:42] amen it could give him the Holy Spirit
[1:24:44] to let him see these things but he did
[1:24:46] it anyhow in his own selfish mind right
[1:24:49] but Ezekiel in his vision in the
[1:24:51] Millennium he sees him again in perfect
[1:24:53] order that's in Ezekiel
[1:24:55] 48 and also in Revelation 14 John seen
[1:24:58] them again in tribal order that's right
[1:25:00] every tribe to his place what happened
[1:25:03] you remember he said under the heavens
[1:25:05] his name would be blotted out of the
[1:25:06] tribal Affair as long as he was under
[1:25:08] the heavens there would be no more and
[1:25:10] this going to get sticky for just a
[1:25:12] moment he said this 144,000 is down here
[1:25:14] in the tribal part yet so he's telling
[1:25:17] us they didn't have an
[1:25:18] opportunity said you see they'v been
[1:25:20] blinded they they had only the sacrifice
[1:25:22] of of BS and goats see I notice he
[1:25:24] blotted them out under the heaven right
[1:25:26] under the heaven come on but there was
[1:25:28] hope in the in the Millennium it turned
[1:25:30] out
[1:25:32] right but the Gentile in the days of the
[1:25:35] Holy Spirit against that your name was
[1:25:37] taken completely off The Book of Life
[1:25:40] could never have forgiveness in this
[1:25:42] world or the world to come that's right
[1:25:44] so there is where we
[1:25:46] stand now that's pretty that's pretty
[1:25:49] serious isn't it right I think we ought
[1:25:51] to take it serious because we have no
[1:25:53] excuse right because the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:55] to us to our children to them that are
[1:25:58] far off it's a promise to us listen to
[1:26:01] me church if you don't have it and you
[1:26:02] know you don't have it you need to be
[1:26:04] seeking it come on come on we have no
[1:26:07] excuse amen Hebrews 6 and4 tells us it's
[1:26:12] impossible for those who are once
[1:26:13] enlightened have tasted the Heavenly
[1:26:14] gift were made partakers of the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost have tasted the good word of God
[1:26:17] and the powers of the world to come if
[1:26:19] they shall fall away to renew them again
[1:26:20] to repentance seeing They Crucified
[1:26:22] themselves the Son of God aresh and put
[1:26:24] him to an open
[1:26:25] shame it's
[1:26:28] impossible but I I'm so glad that he
[1:26:31] didn't stop there CU if you go down to
[1:26:34] verse n he said but beloved we are
[1:26:35] persuaded better things of you all right
[1:26:38] yeahall come on right so in the Gentile
[1:26:44] age you one word against the Holy Ghost
[1:26:48] you could be you could be taken off the
[1:26:50] book of life and never have a chance to
[1:26:53] come back right right yeah right but
[1:26:56] look what brother brandom says about
[1:26:57] this verse in Hebrews he said see what
[1:26:59] he's talking about he's not talking
[1:27:00] about Christians Falling Away impossible
[1:27:03] to come back oh Church there's a there's
[1:27:05] hope for Christians There's Hope for you
[1:27:08] why because you didn't just Taste of the
[1:27:10] things of God and then walk away from it
[1:27:12] you weren't a carnal believer you
[1:27:14] received him and so if you have the
[1:27:17] opportunity today listen it's a
[1:27:18] dangerous thing to be a carnal believer
[1:27:20] but if you've received him and I trust
[1:27:22] that we have tonight here on a Wednesday
[1:27:24] night I trust we've all received him if
[1:27:26] we've received him if we if we've we
[1:27:28] walked in the spirit if we've become if
[1:27:30] he's lived his life in us we might fall
[1:27:34] but look he said he's talking about
[1:27:35] carnal believers who go through the form
[1:27:38] of reformation yeah they find themselves
[1:27:40] with no atonement oh church but he said
[1:27:44] to you who was born again you who are
[1:27:45] Christian beloved we're persuaded better
[1:27:47] things of you oh church I'm persuaded
[1:27:51] better things of Word of Life Tabernacle
[1:27:52] tonight right uh things that accompany
[1:27:55] salvation why because I believe God
[1:27:58] called me to preach to you and if God
[1:27:59] called you to this message there must
[1:28:01] have been a reason for it there must
[1:28:02] have been a reason why I called me must
[1:28:04] have been a reason why I called you must
[1:28:06] have been a reason you found out about
[1:28:07] the message of the hour what was it you
[1:28:09] were not of those who go back you are of
[1:28:11] those who believe sir oh I'm so glad to
[1:28:14] be one of those number that what
[1:28:15] couldn't be blotted
[1:28:17] out all right though we had all those
[1:28:19] things in our heart that serpent in our
[1:28:22] heart are you with me now now but yet
[1:28:25] there was some way that we overcame it
[1:28:27] what was it he crushed the head of the
[1:28:29] serpent
[1:28:31] Hallelujah he died for my Redemption it
[1:28:34] all comes back to the Cross Church have
[1:28:37] you noticed how almost every tribe it
[1:28:39] comes back to the Cross comes back to he
[1:28:43] died for you to make you new you're one
[1:28:46] of those people you he said you don't
[1:28:47] say those things you don't live that
[1:28:50] type of life you're secured with Christ
[1:28:52] as I'm closing as the musician has come
[1:28:55] he said grieve
[1:28:56] not the holy spirit of
[1:28:59] God whereby you are
[1:29:02] sealed until the day of Redemption how
[1:29:05] could you fall away it's impossible for
[1:29:07] you to fall away and yet he tells us
[1:29:09] don't grieve
[1:29:12] him I want to take all my
[1:29:16] land I don't want to be a
[1:29:18] danite I want to be I want to be of the
[1:29:21] tribe of Judah
[1:29:24] the tribe of Judah Lion of the tribe of
[1:29:26] Judah he overcame he prevailed Dan
[1:29:29] didn't Prevail Samson couldn't
[1:29:31] Prevail even David of the tribe of Judah
[1:29:33] didn't Prevail over himself but Jesus
[1:29:38] did aren't you glad that he did that
[1:29:40] gives us hope tonight that gives us
[1:29:42] Faith to believe we can make it we're
[1:29:44] going to make it it's not the end of the
[1:29:46] story you might have made a mistake but
[1:29:48] that's not the end of your
[1:29:51] story there's more for you there's a way
[1:29:53] to come back back would you bow your
[1:29:55] heads with me as they begin to
[1:29:58] play how did Samson finally get the
[1:30:00] victory he died to
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:05] himself only the woman's seed could
[1:30:09] crush the head of the serpent only his
[1:30:11] spirit in you will make it where you can
[1:30:13] never fall
[1:30:15] away oh I want that Assurance tonight I
[1:30:18] trust that you do if you don't have it
[1:30:21] and you're here tonight I pray that it
[1:30:23] just burn inside of
[1:30:25] you do you get
[1:30:28] it you young men if you're battling you
[1:30:31] battle things we do as men and young
[1:30:34] women battle things married couples
[1:30:36] battle
[1:30:37] things remember it's not the end you
[1:30:39] were you're not of those who go
[1:30:42] back you're fighting a
[1:30:45] battle but but learn to win the object
[1:30:48] is not to remain that way the rest of
[1:30:51] your life the object is to win
[1:30:54] and you can't do that without the Holy
[1:30:55] Ghost you can't even see where you're
[1:30:57] wrong without the Holy Ghost so I say
[1:31:01] tonight that's what we need that's what
[1:31:04] we need so we don't follow the example
[1:31:05] of the tribe of Dan but we can by his
[1:31:08] Spirit living in us follow the example
[1:31:11] of the Lion of the tribe of Judah who
[1:31:13] overcame by becoming a
[1:31:15] lamb when John looked he said the lion
[1:31:18] of the tribe of Judah have prevailed but
[1:31:19] when he looked he saw a lamb the lion of
[1:31:21] the tribe of Judah overcame by coming a
[1:31:24] lamb you overcome I overcome by
[1:31:26] surrendering ourselves would you just do
[1:31:28] that tonight brother brand taught us
