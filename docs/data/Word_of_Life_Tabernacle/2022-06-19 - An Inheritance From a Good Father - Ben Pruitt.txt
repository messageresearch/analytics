said unto me let us go to the house of the lord proverbs 13 and 22 it says a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just i pray the lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word this morning you may be seated thank you all for coming brother bill you didn't get quite as many as sister karen did but we appreciate y'all coming and each one of you our visitors today and those that are watching unable to be here today i know whether jeremy wanted to be here got called out again and and we're just going to rebuke that devil and send it back where it come from and it's good to see brother gabe and sister milly here this morning i know they were they drove a long ways to be here this morning they were out of town and and uh decided they want to come back and be in church so it's good to see you today god bless you i i appreciate that and and it's always good you know when you make an effort to come to church it seems like god just gives you an extra special blessing amen i know where the paul's been sick with paul seymour it's good to see you back here this morning each and every one of you happy father's day to you i uh my kids my daughters well all of my children gave me a card this morning and and uh it was a good card but they signed it kind of differently they they put down there esther she started off like she said well she said dad she said i'm aren't you glad that i'm not like these other children she said my siblings that are you know give you such a hard time she said aren't you glad that i'm not like that and reminded me of the pharisee praying in the temple you know and melody had on the other side she had her own little blurb there that she had written and she said aren't you glad i'm not like my other siblings you know and uh peter he just wrote his name so he had no defense but uh it was glad to get that but you know we passed that on to our children i uh uh was thinking that that's you know me and joel we do that you know to each other and all the time and so we leave things to our kids i i read a story where there was a small boy sitting at a dinner table and just shoving food in his mouth with both hands and his father said son don't make a pig out of yourself and it didn't slow the boy down and father said son do you know what a pig is and he's still shoving in the food and the boy said yes sir it's an old hogs little boy so we we definitely teach our children don't we i want to preach to you about a good father this morning the kind of inheritance a good father gives because the bible says a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children a good man a good father is difficult to find good men are harder to find than pianos at church of christ convention and some of you'll get that later but you know our culture doesn't value fatherhood right i uh and i won't get into the difference in mother's day and father's day we won't go there but we don't value fathers like we should i fathers are important i they say that one in four children live without any kind of a father not biological stepfather or adoptive father one in four live without any kind of a father in the home and that's enough children to fill new york city twice or los angeles four times over without fathers and they shows research shows that it impacts children in a negative way they're four times they have a four times greater risk of poverty they're more likely to have problems in their behavior they are twice as likely to die as infants they're seven times more likely to become pregnant as teens the girls they're more likely to face abuse and neglect more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol twice as likely to suffer obesity twice as likely to drop out of school and you know and we see that fathers are often portrayed in the media as goofballs drinking beer and watching sports and telling bad jokes and maybe some of that fits but but you know i i challenge you if you go out in the media today you don't find a positive father figure you if you do they try to portray them with some kind of a meek man who never says anything and stays home and washes the dishes hasn't that been a change in our time that uh nothing wrong with the man washing dishes but the commercials during our time all the detergent commercials now have men in them and and they expect that and the women are portrayed as dominant and go out in the workforce i'm glad god made a woman a real woman and put her in her in the right place where she's supposed to be where she does a good job and i'm glad god made a man a real man and and able to do what god wants him to do and but you look at the commercials that are that are out there and and how that they've changed and we could look around and you could see maybe even in your own life you say well i i don't see very many good fathers maybe you didn't even have a good father some of you did but others maybe perhaps didn't have a good father and and you look at the example of that and you think where will i find the example of a good father where could there be an example that could be shown to me something that i could look at and i could say that's a good father well i think we'll find that in the scriptures and and i think when i think of a father in the scriptures i think of abraham the bible says in 8 genesis 18 17 the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him why he said because i know him i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him he says i know he'll be a good father so abraham is a father that not the world calls good the culture didn't say that he was a good father the people around him it wasn't his kids that made him father of the year but it was actually god himself and i'll tell you what as a dad myself today that's what i want i want god to say you're a good father you're a good father you've done the right things and you've taught your children correctly and so the bible says he'll command his children and you think about it this father of the year why why was he father of the year in heaven he was there because he put god first you remember it was abraham who took his own son now we wouldn't put him up for father of the year because he takes his own son makes him carry the wood seems like a mean dad don't he makes him carry the wood to be sacrificed on the mountain and the boy looked at him he'd been taught well he said here's the wood here's the fire but where's the lamb oh my but god said he's a good father because he put god first he said somehow god's going to protect my children i'm going to put god first i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm going to go to church and god will take care of my children where is the father like that today he will stand up and say i'm going to put god first i'm going to believe the word i'm going to do what god says god will take care of my children if i'll put god first he's a good father who'll command his children to do the right things the bible tells us god is our father in matthew 6 and 9 says after this manner therefore pray ye our father our father which art in heaven well if you don't have a good father on the earth you've got one in heaven our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven notice how he how he tells us to pray like children it's a children's prayer but he didn't limit it to children right a child can pray it he said give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen why would he would he give us such a simple prayer such a such a direct thing with at such contrast to the way the pharisees prayed when they went out and made long speeches and prayed for the governor and the president and everything else and and used all kinds of big words but he said just say our father because your father knows what you have need of your father is capable amen a good father is capable of taking care of the ones that he produces they're his children listen to me this morning you're god's children you don't belong to the devil you don't belong to the world you don't belong to the culture you're a child of god and because you're a child of god you could look at him simply and say my father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name give me my daily bread he'll take care of you he knows what you need you don't know how much you need of an allowance but god knows are you with me now he gives you an allowance you know i give my kids well i really don't but i'm supposed to give my kids an allowance manny do you get an allowance you don't even know what that is yeah he does get an allowance and what that means is that you get a little a certain amount well you know you don't usually get to pick the amount because if you pick the amount you'd ask for more you should go home and ask for more but asking faith that's right but if you pick if you picked the amount it would be a lot right but he knows how much you need and if and if my father only gave me 25 cents he wasn't going to give me 25 cents and expect me to go out and make do with that 25 cents and pay the light bill and take care of no he was going to take care of me are you with me now if god gives you an allowance of joy if you give you an allowance of peace if you give you an allowance of of the good things of life and you say well that's not enough lord don't you know he's got enough to take care of you he's got enough extra to take care of you whatever he gives you you just be grateful for that give us our daily bread give us what we have need of give us enough yes amen do you believe he's a good father today brother branham said oh isn't he a good god jesus is so good to us he said and it's well expressed that our god is a good god he is so good to his children he has provided every good thing for us everything that we have need of he has provided it do you believe that today truly you can say our father who art in heaven because he is a father and though we be disobedient though we be arrogant he still provides for us just the same oh do you believe that today though we'd be dead listen when you your father if you had a good father here on the earth if you messed up if you acted inappropriately he may have chastised you he may have given you a spanking hopefully he did but if but when it come when it all come out in the wash he didn't quit providing for you he didn't quit caring about you he didn't quit giving you what you had need of are you with me this morning we think many times well i've messed up i i've done things that are wrong and so god won't provide for me anymore but he's a good father he still cares about you he'll correct you he'll let you go through some trials but he's a good father he won't tempt you more than you're able he won't put you through more than what you can take you believe that today he's a good father amen he said though we were disbe disobedient though he'd be arrogant he still provides for us just the same whether we are good or whether we are bad he gives us food to eat clothes to wear a house to dwell in oh he is so good if we would just look around and count the good things that he is to us he said we don't stop to consider that what if you had no eyes what if you had no eyes that's the person said i thought i was having a bad day because i didn't have new shoes until i met a man who had no feet what if you had no eyes what if you had no nose you had no mouth you had no ears what if you had no feet or limbs you could not walk around but see he provided you feet what if you had no eyes and could not see yet you could hear noises but you knew not what they were he said now then it's all in the five senses that he provides but then i love this so he provides that for us in the natural all the things we have need of he provides that for us but then if we'll just live close to him he'll provide something else for us he said that is an insight that we can see what the ordinary person never sees when we're born again we see him that's why some people can't see him it's because they've never been born again when we're born again he gives us an insight he provides even for those who reject his word oh don't you see the loving hand of jehovah today the loving hand of god that provides even for the just and the unjust but if you're born again he gives you an extra insight he gives you beyond what the ordinary person can see he said you know him you've seen him he will abide with you forever oh he is a good father he is the fountain of goodness how many believe that today the great resources of all resources of all goodness and fatherhood belongs in our god where would we look today and see an example of a good father where could we look and see an example of someone who who would be a father that we could look up to we can look around and we can see many good fathers but if we look to heaven we see a perfect father one who provides exactly what we have need of yet many of his children look at him and say oh he's not good word isn't good he hasn't given me enough oh but the ungrateful children don't change how the father feels about his children amen aren't you glad to be his children today you see a good father the scripture tells us a good man leaves an inheritance not just to his children but to his children's children i want to dwell on that now in them if you put your spiritual thinking caps on in a spiritual way because we know that's true in the natural a good man will work and provide for his family and he provides in such a way and i don't mean just materially but also in a in a spiritual way he provides in such a way it'll go down to his kids and to his grandkids because he's provided for them he provides a home he provides a place for them he provides he'll go to church he'll maybe move his family across the country to get them in a good church why it's a good man and his children benefit from that his grandchildren benefit from that a good man his children benefit his grandchildren benefit but now look at it in a spiritual sense because if our god our god is a good god he's a good father if he's a good father he leaves an inheritance to his children's children and we know there's no grandchildren when it comes to the lord to the spiritual things but we are an inheritor of another generation generation after generation has come and gone since he came and and he died here on the cross for us generation after generation has come and what that means is that the inheritance is not diminished by generation are you hearing me this morning what the first age got yes amen the same holy ghost that they got is the same holy ghost that we get a good man right oh my when i looked at this it's a simple thought but when i begin to think about it i begin to think lord what is it that that you're trying to show me you're trying to show me that you're the same yesterday today and forever that you leave an inheritance not just to the ones in the first church age but to this age to my day not just to brother branham's time the inheritance didn't run out in 1965 right the inheritance didn't run out in 2010 it didn't run out whenever you you received the holy ghost but it's still the same today amen the inheritance is not diminished and the bible tells us that the holy ghost is the earnest of our inheritance or it is that portion of our inheritance that we receive on this side does that make sense he's given us an earnest a percentage of our inheritance it's not the fullness of it because one of these days we won't have to worry about getting sick no more we don't have to worry about being hot no more we don't have to worry about getting cold we won't have to worry about shelter or food or any of these things we don't have to worry about it because he's going to provide us a new body and a home and all of those things but now we live in a body of flesh but the holy ghost is the earnest or the down payment or the portion of our inheritance that we get now and back in bible days you could actually get a portion of your inheritance early you remember the prodigal son he took his inheritance early and he went out and spent it but he was still the father's son amen but now the holy ghost is given to us as the portion of our inheritance the earnest of our inheritance to down payment on our inheritance so it's a guarantee and we could go into that this morning it's a guarantee and a seal that says that that inheritance cannot be diminished so if it is diminished in our life and i want us to be serious about this today as we've talked about fathers and all these things but if the holy ghost has diminished it all in our lives it is not because of the holy ghost it's not because it's not for us it's not because it's not for our day but if the holy ghost is diminished in our life if the influence of it is diminished in any way for you and i it's because that we have backslid from him because we've grieved him away he said but brother ben what should i do you should come back to it you should go back to where you left him and you should say lord i know your holy ghost is for me i know this inheritance is for me i know healing is mine i know salvation is mine i know the word is mine so if it is diminished in any way in our lives we need to go back where we left it because he's a good father he gives the inheritance to his children's children notice it's not diminished or used up in acts 2 39 he said for the promise it's unto you say thank the lord it's to them and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now brother branham said we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how the first or original church was founded so we don't have to guess about what the inheritance was what did it mean for them to have the holy ghost we went through that in acts chapter 2 how that they staggered out like drunk men but that wasn't the end of it right it wasn't just an emotion or a feeling though that was part of it they received that they had an emotion they had a feeling they staggered like drunk men they had a good service but they went beyond that and the bible says they broke bread daily with the apostles they they fellowship together their lives were changed they were called christians because they walked like christ and the people could see they'd been with jesus and they go down to the gate beautiful and they walk down there as a man who's laying from his from his birth and he says such as i have i give why that was the inheritance are you with me today the inheritance is not diminished and if you're here this morning you're sick or you're or or there's sin in your life or there's something that you think well i i just can't seem to overcome that the inheritance is not diminished from generation to generation that's why i still believe god calls preachers today i still believe god calls men and women today of the word i still believe he calls a church today to be like that first church and we know what that first church was because it was recorded by the holy spirit how it was founded yes and how god manifested himself in her he said the word can't change or be changed because the word is god in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so he goes on to say to change one word of it is did he bring sin and death it says in revelation 22 18 if any man shall add unto these things god shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away the part out of the book of life out of the holy city from the things which are written in this book why would you want to add to or take away when a good father gave it to you in the form that it is he's a good father he said now he said that's what the church was at pentecost he didn't say was the standard but is the standard he said well we're not what they were at pentecost now wait a minute when you say that you may not be yeah brother branham always said it this way he said don't he said i may not have the faith that enoch did he said i won't stand in somebody else's way are you with me this morning somebody's got to what the church was at pentecost is the standard but i think if you go back and study it out you'll find they were still human you'll find they still fuss sometimes you'll find they still had church problems they needed deacons to take care of the church problems because people were getting offended at one another i'm so glad deacons are in charge of that just messing with you brothers that's why deacons were invented you know that that's why god allowed deacons in the church it's because because the the greeks and the jews got offended at one another but who was getting served first at the at the buffet at the church potluck and so the preacher said we don't have time to mess with this we need to be giving time to the word you deacons go take care of it and so god appealing to men full of the holy ghost to take care of it but that's the pattern that's the pattern that's as much part of the pattern as them staggering like junk men out of the upper room that's the pattern there is no other pattern right yes sir are you with me this morning no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close oh my do we believe a prophet or don't we he said those scholars may tell you scholars we have scholars today try to tell you that the apostolic age is over don't you believe it yes don't you believe it a good man's inheritance is left to his children's children amen he said such a statement is wrong on two counts first of all it is wrong to suppose there aren't any more apostles because the original 12 were dead he said an apostle means a sin one there are many sent ones today they are called missionaries yes we don't need to go back and call them apostles brother says the same thing yeah right but we know what they are yeah he said they're called missionaries we don't have to make them something else to make them lords over a bunch of churches right because that spirit exists out there but but that's not what we do when we go overseas we don't go over there to become the apostle of a bunch of different churches we go as missionaries or or as a pastor as an evangelist to help the bride of christ in another part of the world right but they have their own pastors right the goal is to set them up where they have their own pastors they have their own teachers their own deacons and we won't have a word to say about what they do or who they have in to preach because that's not apostolic that's catholic but he said as long as men are being called as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life there is an apostolic age going on so god called men will not sit down and quit preaching i i know i talk about this a lot but it's important for us today you understand god called me and they're not going to quit preaching see whatever standard we believe in is the standard that we'll hold ourselves to if we take the standard of the church of being however we grew up then that's all we'll ever be that's all the potential we'll ever have right if the standard of the church is what the world is now if you could look out and say so-and-so's church in the world and and a mega church of some kind if what you see on television is the standard for the church then that's all we'll ever be but the church today is cold and formal and powerless having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof are you with me that's the laodicean church that's not our standard and so we have to struggle for a higher standard just like you do and said dad you got to struggle to a higher standard you may not do everything like you're supposed to do at times you may make the wrong choices the wrong decisions but what do you do you struggle for a higher standard because we have one our standard is not some cartoon character in my time it's went from andy taylor on tv to homer simpson if you know who that is i'm sorry but it went from the from from from being positive to being negative but the standard is not what's portrayed on television the standard is not even what other people do the standard is the word the standard is the word and the word said as many amen as the lord our god shall call then if the word said we can have church we can have church if the word said we can we can shout then we can shout if the word said the gifts were supposed to be in the church they'll be in the church if the word says are you with me this morning if the word says by his stripes i'm healed i can claim my healing this morning because god said so that's the standard amen he said no there's not even one scripture he said that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise look at his standard it's the scripture he said here is our proof now the one thing that they were saying is that the apostolic age is over because there's no more missionaries the other they were saying is that the that was just for the age of the apostles he said here's our proof that both these charges are false then peter said unto them repent be baptized everyone this is the proof every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but the promise is unto you and your children and all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so brother branham says that this way he said the promise of power with which the apostles were endured at pentecost is to you jews to your children jews and all that are far off gentiles amen to his meaningless the lord our god shall call both you and gentile until he stops calling the pentecostal message in power come on will not cease yes sir oh hallelujah do you believe that today and what does that do it gives us hope today it gives us hope we can have families that are by the word it gives us hope we can have real dads we can have real moms we can have real children in the faith we can have real pastors it gives us hope we don't have to set any other standard yes then what he said until he stops calling the pentecostal message in power will not cease listen he says what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right right yes sir now someone tried to come and take your gun off of you don't raise your hand if you've got a gun with you in church huh but somebody tried to come take your guns off of you huh think about it what would you do that's my inalienable right you wouldn't be sitting there just complacent let them do it promote safety boy it's sticky right now you wouldn't let them take that away what if they took you right to free speech you can only say what the government tells you to say huh i would fight for that right what if they took your right to assemble to peaceably assemble we take advantage of that right every sunday morning and the right to free speech you realize that the right to free speech is the right to to good speech and stupid speech it's the right to speak right but you would never let somebody take that from you why you're an american i think sometimes we forget who we are we're sons and daughters of god you have an inalienable right to what the church had at pentecost you believed the word of god this morning you have an inalienable right to what the church had at pentecost an inalienable right he said originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders he said in gifts of the holy ghost that's what she had and if that's what she had that's what we can have how many believe that today amen amen sorry i get too excited brother branham goes on to read hebrews chapter 2. hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1 it says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest it anytime you've heard it you're right he said we ought to give heed to that lest at any time we should let them slip yes float away drift for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every listen people today say well you can't preach the gospel anymore but jesus said preach the gospel to every creature if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape i love paul's language here if we neglect not if we reject but how shall we escape if we neglect yes so it's our responsibility not just to say there's preachers in the church to say there's gifts in the church but to make sure they're there right yes sir how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation oh my that's how so many is backside today i tell so many why so many are not in church not because they rejected it not because they turned around or they got on some website and they told them something different but because they neglected it how shall we escape yes oh god if we neglect to pray if we neglect to read our bibles if we neglect to believe that that power is for us how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness notice how it was given to us both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will this is my inheritance this is what came down to the children's children from a good father it was salvation it was sanctification it was healing amen it was gifts of the spirit it was a five-fold ministry it was the word the full word the open book of the hour this is my inheritance it's time we begin to supply in the world creep into our homes and the world creeps into our churches and and a lacks idea say well it doesn't really matter what kind of service we have doesn't really matter if we ever pray it doesn't really matter if the holy ghost ever strikes us if the atmosphere is never right we'll just keep on going on because we're predestined anyway no how shall we escape if we neglect such a great inheritance has been given to us amen that come with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy spirit well if it came that way it's still the same today amen amen what was it joel 2 21 he told us what that inheritance was he said fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things be not afraid you beast to the field can i just preach to you for a minute let me read you the word he said for the pastors of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth our fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then you children those times rejoice in the lord your god that tells me i can rejoice in church he said for he hath given you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor should be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cake worm and the caterpillar department my great army would just sin among you had to brother branham explain that how that each worm come down began to eat away to bark at the fruit and the bark and finally even at the pulp but there was still life down in the ground and it came back up with luther and wesley he said four messengers of death four messengers of life luther wesley pentecost in the message of the hour amen i will restore to you the years the locust is eating the cake warm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great harmony which i sent among you that you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied are you eating plenty this morning if you're not eating plenty it's not because there's not plenty it's because you're not eating oh i was raised in my mama's house where if we didn't eat plenty it wasn't because there wasn't plenty it was because we weren't eating are you hearing me now at my house it's not there's plenty of food in the fridge there's plenty if you come to my house and you don't eat plenty it's because you're not eating if you come to the house of god in this day whether it's a full seven course meal and you're not getting fat off of it spiritually if you're not beginning to rejoice spiritually it's not because the meal is not there it's because you're not eating it you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen you shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed to keep repeating that brother branham comes back from india and preaches a message called ashamed because he talks about missionaries going overseas he said and they should be they come back ashamed because they can't produce the works of god oh but we don't have to be ashamed because the years have been restored to us amen verse 28 it shall come to pass afterward i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see visions also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days well i pour out my spirit i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the lord shall be delivered oh do you believe we're living in that day for in mount zion and jerusalem shall be deliverance that's the lord has said and then the remnant whom the lord shall call peter gives us the revelation of that verse and i won't read it all but he comes back in acts 2 16 and says this is that this is the inheritance that a good man leaves to his children's children yes hallelujah this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel he said now you tell me is god still calling you tell me is god's still calling if god is still calling then the apostolic age is still in existence certainly as many as the lord our god shall call ever call ever will call as many as he shall call it will still be the apostolic age for jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he teaches us in seed of discrepancy anything else is the seed of discrepancy so we believe that today do you believe it oh my he said yes sir it's time to return return to what return back to the organization i come out of no return back to your inheritance oh my if you're not receiving your inheritance if you're not eating and plenty and being satisfied it's not because the inheritance isn't here it is here the holy ghost is here the open book is here then it's not because the inheritance is not here but it's time to return return back to your inheritance i know it's a little bit evangelistic this morning but i want you to i want you to see it i want us to understand it to know if there's something there that's not what it was back then we have a standard we have a good father we can ask for it amen we can be as bold as my daughters were this morning hey man as bold as they've ever been my daughters when they want something they they don't ask once they don't ask christ they keep asking they keep asking over and over again until i finally tell them it's enough but sometimes i'll act you know this i hate to admit this even i shouldn't admit this in front of them but sometimes you act just because they keep after you because they know you oh my sometimes we act just because they keep after us and said and jesus told us that if if the children of the world get what they want just by their what he calls importunity just by coming and asking and asking and asking how much more will your father give you amen i'm getting ahead of myself but now that's that's the promise that we have yes he said what kind of inheritance did he leave he said wait you in the city of jerusalem until you're endured with power from on high that's the inheritance now go join this one and go join that one go join this one wait till the power comes from on high how long until one day two days wait until don't take some little emotion some little frustration wait there until you're dead and buried and born again anew in christ jesus and every pulsation of your life beats out jesus christ till you can see the life of christ reflected right in your living oh isn't that what you want this morning the way you go yes or two you can find that power like they had back there in the beginning back to a pentecostal inheritance yes sir oh if i had more voice to cry with this morning i'd cry back to a pentecostal in it that don't mean back to the denominational pentecost that's not what he's saying they lost their inheritance gave it away and said speaking in tongues was the evidence of the holy ghost and gave away the word amen but this possession he said denomination is not your possession oh god denomination will tell you what to do and what to preach and what to say and where to build your church and what time to have church that's the nomination that'll tell you that that's not your possession amen that's not your possession denomination is not your possession pentecost is your possession how many believe that today pentecost is your possession not a pentecostal organization your father's come out of such a thing the pentecostal experience is your possession that's what a good father does he gives good thanks let's read luke 11 and 5. he said unto them which of you shall have a friend so going to him at midnight saying to him friend lend me three loaves i think i've told you before but if i had a friend like that i might not listen but as your pastor you know i'm i'll do that if you need bread at through midnight i'll be glad to help you don't make a habit of it he said which we have a friend going to him at midnight saying to him friend he ain't much of a friend to me lend me three loaves for a friend of mine and it's in his journey it's come to me and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and given thee just go back to bed a friend can you see the picture that jesus is painting god has a sense of humor don't he your friend shows up at midnight and he comes back you say no it's too late go home close the door get back under the covers you guys been to close friend i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his opportunity i hurt my knuckles huh he keeps coming back and asking yes have we forgotten what church is all about what prayer is all about i wonder sometimes we've forgotten how to pray completely i don't mean to say that to judge you i i don't know many of you some of you pray probably more than i do but even myself sometimes i wonder if we've forgotten what prayer is come back to god say well i prayed before i come up from prayer before have you heard you knock lately just because the man is bold enough that's importunity you know they've proven in sales joel knows this those of you that have done sales know this have proven in sales if you'll go knock on enough doors you'll sell something even if it's a vacuum cleaner that don't work and cost three thousand dollars it's just a fact of life that if you knock on enough doors i remember my dad would go in a house and the man tell him you're not going to sell us nothing we're not buying nothing we're not writing a check and that man would be cursing my father as he wrote the check importunity when did you come and go you say well i don't want to bother god bother god how can you bother something infinite i'll come at the wrong time i'll wait till the morning the friend showed up at midnight and because of his importunity he kept knocking amen because not because he's his friend but because of his opportunity he'll rise and give him as many as he needs just take them all oh god he uses that extreme example he said i said to you ask oh my and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you i wonder how many times we knock say well i've been my kids say i'm struggling for my kids i'm struggling for my marriage i'm struggling i wonder if we've knocked i know some of you do i know you come back over and over but keep knocking keep knocking he's testing you he's trying you he loves to hear you cry he wants you brother man said he never found a better way than to have a baby cry for something he said they don't take a little bell and ring it but when a baby's in the crib and they want mama they begin to cry and he never found a better way he said to do it than that ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that she could find it to him that knocketh it shall be open if his son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father no he appeals to their fatherhood will he give him a stone well that's funny my son's hungry i'm going to give him a stone what kind of dad are you if you ask a fish will if he for a fish give him a serpent oh god if he ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion oh my if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father you believe he's a good father how much more should your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him you say i need a refilling of the holy ghost i haven't seen you in the altar are you with me now i haven't seen you in the altar i need the holy ghost to i i need something to i need something to break oh god why are we not knocking yeah oh god if you if you're evil you know how to get give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to the ones who ask him amen brother brother said we're planted in christ jesus he said now i believe just in my estimation of him what estimation do you have of christ today that's what you'll get what you believe about him is what you'll get from him he said now i believe just in my estimation of him he's the inexhaustible fountain of life that you cannot exhaust his goodness some people think oh i hate to call on god so much that's what he wants you to do you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joys may be full that's what god wants ask big things he said i'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting oh god it's meant so much to me because we're about to go on this mission or trip i'm not a missionary i'm a pastor but to go and try to reach souls he said i'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting i'm asking that every sick person that enters that door will go out of her well out of here well i'm believing it hey man if you don't expect to baptize anybody somebody come to spurgeon one time we haven't baptized anyone all year in our church he said how many did you expect to baptize he said none he said that's why yeah amen ask amen ask big things i'm asking that every sick person enters that door will go out of here well i'm believing it do you believe it today one time jesus standing looking on the harvest jesus said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest and he was the lord of the harvest he said you have not because you ask not you know why people don't have ministry i haven't asked for it say well there ain't nobody that preaches the word right you don't ask you have not because you asked not he said ask abundance that your joys might be full he is depending on you asking the almighty all-sufficient elohim is depending on you asking him lord send missionaries yes sir lord send pastors oh god lord sin men will stand by the word send someone who believe the word who will stay faithful lord he's depending on you asking him to sin the lord of the harvest is standing there looking out at the whiteness at the ripeness of the harvest and he says ask yes pray that the lord of the harvest will send laborers into his harvest i'm closing in just a moment caleb was a good father and joshua 15 and 16. caleb said he that smiteth courageous seifer and taketh it to him while i give oxf my daughter to wife and othniel the son of king has the brother of caleb took it he you know it was a walled city caleb takes all the other city said well there's one left but at least something for my future son-in-law to do so he tells him he said go mow the lawn and we'll see how you do mowing the lawn but actually if you look into that and i've preached to you about it before but i wanted to bring it in here because i believe it fits and that actually that name of that city means book and so it's a type of christ he said he took the book off neil amen who was a blood relative to caleb took the book and he gave him his daughter as his bride oh my verse 18 it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted off of her ass and caleb said to her what what is thou now you can imagine how this went down that she is they're riding along and they're just newly married and you know how it is your wife she's poking him and say right along hey hey off neil that land's mighty dry my daddy gave me a good inheritance but it needs some more water he gave her a south land it means a desert land and she watched all the other children get all these other things and she said you know what my land's mighty dry but i have a good father so she pokes him there's gabe ask my daddy asked my daddy said to give me something some water he sat there and said i can't look like that in front of your dad woman be quiet he might not have given it to the son-in-law oh god but she got down when they got there she was so fed up she got that she slid off of the donkey and she said okay so what do you want i can tell you want something or you wouldn't be here you know when your adult children come along come around after they're married they come around they're just hanging around the house you know what do you want she said give me a blessing you've given me a southland land with no water in it give me also springs of water she said give me something to sustain the land the productiveness of my land oh god we have that inheritance today we have a good father so that we don't have to be dead and dry are you hearing me today we don't have to be dead and dry we can get down in front of our father we can get down in front of our father and say lord you've given me a portion of life that has trouble in it you've given me a in-laws that give me trouble you've given me outlaws to give me trouble you my family we don't have the money everybody else does we don't we don't have the things everybody else does there are certain things and all of you have something in your life that you can look at like that we we don't have i have to work maybe more than some other men do and some of you could say that or i have to do things that they're different and i have to provide for my family lord i may not be able to do what so and so does because of my south land that the place the place where you put me the kind of work you gave me to do and the things that you give me it's hard for me it's difficult for me because of the inheritance i have but lord i don't believe you'd have given that to me without giving me a way to sustain life lord give me a southland and give me water give me also springs of water and he gave her upper springs for mountaintop experiences nether springs for experiences in the valley when she's in the valley yes he gave her a way to sustain life on her land on her inheritance it was jabez you pray lord enlarge my territory caleb said give me my mountain huxley said give me springs of water as i've told you my daughters love to ask me for big things things i can't even do right now but they just want to plant a seed oh god sometimes as men just talk to us a minute it says father some close musicians go ahead and come wait i will close as father sometimes we we we are determined to do it ourselves we're determined and we know we're dry we know we need help from god we're determined to be we're determined to be self-made i got my job i i got the things i have to do i'm a man of the wilderness hunting fish and go out and do i'm a man i'm a he-man my father my dad we're kind of like ox's husband we don't want to ask but you're also the bride of jesus christ and and sometimes we feel like well for me it would be humbling for me but if anybody should ask shouldn't it be the father's because we have a father and when our children aren't being provided for in the right way or we're worried about what might happen at school or we're concerned about the direction that they're heading we've tried our best and done everything that we can do some of you your children have grown and they've gone out and you're concerned but you still have the ability to get down on your knees and cry out to god and say lord you're my father if i could do it for my children i would if i could do it for myself i would if i could give myself a greater portion of the holy ghost if i could if i could fill my life with goodness and joy and and long suffering and gentleness and kindness i would do it but i can't do it i can't do it without you as men we have to be humble enough that we're able to get down in front of him and say lord give me springs of water enlarge my territory not just give me my mountain to fight on but give me also springs of water let me be like my daughters who are willing to ask our father dwells in heaven you see as a father i don't always have it to give but our father who dwells in heaven has everything that we need i i don't mean to point out esther this morning but she always looks at houses she's done this for years we just bought a house but she always looks at bigger houses better houses he's always looking at houses well when that girl gets married her husband's in trouble she looks at bigger houses and better houses and i'm i'm a man of small things and limited abilities as far as fixing things and building things but she always asks me i want or she don't and sometimes she don't even ask she just does it she just looks i wonder why you keep looking at houses because she trusts enough in her dad that maybe someday there will be an opportunity my wife gave up years ago but maybe someday there'll be an opportunity to have that big house we have a nice home i'm not complaining but it's just you see the the faith of a child of a little girl that's the way we ought to be lord you're a good father you're a good father what do you need this morning ask him for it yeah well he didn't answer keep knocking because your father who dwells in heaven has everything we need he said don't don't ask for things of tomorrow as for today lord give me my daily bread because i'm willing to come back tomorrow at the same place at the same time and ask for bread and water again what do you need ask your father he'll give it to you this morning do you believe it if you believe it you can have it this power heads together what do you need you need to see a revival i didn't mean to be harsh with you but are you knocking oh god are you praying are you digging we've got revival services coming up we've spent a lot of money to bring in ministers and and bring in people and try to have fellowship with other people but that's not what it's all about we want to see the spirit of god move among us we want to see that in our regular services and we do see it many times but we want to see it more and more you have a need today are you knocking are you asking you gotta get so desperate he loves to hear you cry he loves to hear you call out say lord you're my father i acknowledge my inability but i also acknowledge your ability to give me the thing i have need of today heavenly father oh god it's so great to be able to call you that [Music] as brother branham put it maybe in a more familiar kind of way papa god [Music] oh lord

home life every day life in the vehicle we need life for our families oh god give us springs of water give us the bread of life we believe you will because you're a good father oh god help us to learn to cry for it to call out for it to love you in such a way that we'll believe that you'll give us what we ask for lord help us to look at the scriptures like the little girl like a little girl would look at houses in the paper i want to look at the scripture like that maybe right now we're not in heaven but we will be one day maybe right now we don't have all the maybe even the healing that we've believed for all those years but healing is coming lord help us to read with expectation and be here with expectation and know that you're a good father you'll give us exactly what we have need of i
