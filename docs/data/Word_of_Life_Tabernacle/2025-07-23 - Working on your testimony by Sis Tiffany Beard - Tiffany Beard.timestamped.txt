[0:02] [Music]
[0:08] I cry, Lord,
[0:13] have you forgotten me?
[0:17] It seems lately
[0:21] you're not around.
[0:25] All the tears
[0:29] and all my fears
[0:33] I know you see.
[0:36] If you look down,
[0:41] but in the darkness
[0:46] I hear you
[0:50] so softly.
[0:53] say these words.
[0:56] I'm just working on your testimony.
[1:01] Don't give up on me.
[1:05] I'm moving in ways
[1:09] that you cannot see.
[1:12] And I know right now it's lonely
[1:16] and the darkness weighs on you.
[1:21] But just have faith.
[1:25] Trust me.
[1:28] I'm just working on your testimony.
[1:36] I'm just working on your testimony.
[1:43] [Music]
[1:46] If you're alone
[1:50] and feel you cannot win
[1:54] and you're tired
[1:57] of always feeling down.
[2:02] all your tears
[2:06] and all your fears.
[2:09] Just know he sees
[2:13] as he looks down.
[2:18] And in the darkness
[2:22] and all your hurting,
[2:26] just remember
[2:29] these
[2:31] words. He's just working on your
[2:34] testimony.
[2:37] Don't give up on him.
[2:41] He's moving in ways
[2:45] that you cannot see.
[2:48] And I know right now it's lonely
[2:52] and the darkness weighs on you,
[2:56] but just have
[3:01] trust.
[3:04] He's just working on your testimony.
[3:12] He's just working on your testimony.
[3:22] He sees the tears you cry.
[3:26] Even when you feel alone,
[3:30] he listens to your prayers and moves.
[3:34] Even when you think he won't,
[3:42] he's just working on your testimony.
[3:46] Don't you give up on him. He's moving in
[3:51] the way
[3:54] that you cannot see.
[3:57] And I know right now it's lonely
[4:01] and the darkness
[4:03] on you.
[4:05] But just have
[4:09] trust me.
[4:13] He's just working on your testimony.
[4:21] He's just working on your testimony.
