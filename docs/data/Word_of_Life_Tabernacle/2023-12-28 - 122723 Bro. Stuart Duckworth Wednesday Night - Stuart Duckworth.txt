brother that he get rest in his body certainly he's preached a lot this year so he's just uh we sure appreciate him and and brother Joel out of town and we appreciate our brothers and the things they do for us we pray that God give them rest in their body amen just wanted to kind of continue our thought of redemption and uh such a wonderful thought you know you could you could preach that till the Rapture and uh if y'all get tired of it just let me know but there's so much there you think about Redemption and worship you it it's endless and so it's uh it's good for me I I I'm enjoying it myself and I just uh I hope you all are too sir amen Luke Chapter 2 just the the spirit of Christmas here still and it should be a time of worship that's what Christmas is a a time of of thinking about the birth of our Lord Jesus and when he came the Angels were there to worship amen amen Luke chap 2 and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made by serenus the governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone in his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary's a spous wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end anden you can be seated this evening 1949 brother brownon preaches a a sermon deity of Jesus Christ such a powerful Sermon Just continuing our thought of of redemption Jesus comes three times he said he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church he said but all in one in one Christ remember the first time to redeem his church second time to receive the third time he comes as Church King and Queen so he came he came to redeem that that was his his purpose of his first coming and so now we're looking for him to come come and receive us as the redeemed that's what we're waiting on right and and for those to receive those to receive the Redemption of Jesus Christ those that haven't received that yet and so until he comes again that work of redemption must continue right because because every name that's on that book must come not one's going to be left off not he's not going to lose a one but every name will come so that that work of redemption that Plan of Redemption is still going on so we must continue that message of redemption and what is redemption is to bring back to the its original position of what god of what God had in his mind before the world began even even past the Garden of Eden before the fall but but what God had in his mind of what we were and so how does he do that it's by the Plan of Redemption to D destroy what Satan had done to us and destroy the lie that was put on us by Adam and Eve and so last time we preached we preached on overcoming the lie and rejecting the LIE of Satan and that that's what we have to do we have to reject his thoughts reject what he says about us reject what we were reject our past and everything amen the blood of Jesus Christ has come amen there's power in the blood to destroy that sin to destroy the Li of Satan that was put upon us and so brother randam we've said it before the prophet said Adam put you in the devil's Pawn shot but Jesus came and paid the price that God required to bring you out amen that that's what uh that's what a baby was to me and and brother brandham goes on to say we're not worshiping a baby in a Manger anymore though though we looked at that but we're worshiping almighty God in the in that in in that baby was the blood was the power was the DNA Amen to destroy the Devil to destroy sickness to destroy sin and as we go on here in the deed of Jesus Christ now in these days there was a great persecution he says against the church Caesar Augusta had made a great plan that he would tax all the people and he says and that was only done for one purpose that God's Great prophecy would be fulfilled so Joseph and Mary they couldn't just stay where they're at they had to be in a certain spot they had to be in a certain place a predestinated place and so you think about that that you know no doubt that that was uh that was frustrating it was it was uh aggravating to have to have to get up and you know your your spouse wife here she's not even your wife yet and you know no doubt you've heard it from this one and that one and and you got to get up and move you got to take her and she's almost you know ready to to to to have this child but God makes everything work according to his plan his purpose anden he will allow times of persecution times of pressure and Circumstance he will allow hard times to bring his people into the place where his word can be fulfilled do you believe that and God's predestinated plan won't fail God is a predestinated time and season for every purpose and a plan he has ordained to be married Mary didn't want to be on that Journey she didn't being with child she didn't want to be on that Journey but but there was a purpose and the birth of Jesus was for a predestinated place and even now here this evening here now it's it's a predestinated people that will receive his word into their hearts do you believe that no doubt she was troubled they were troubled by by having to do this but God had already told her the angel had already told Mary that she was highly favored before all this don't be afraid he said You shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Jesus therefore the Lord shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emanuel he told her she was highly favored and so it's the word that holds us down that that that that gives us an assurance that when when trouble arises when when things aren't going the right way God has already made a promise we've already heard from the angel but what we've got to do we've got to take that word into our heart and no matter what comes and goes amen we've got to carry that that word of God within us and it will bring us Amen to that place that we need to be that that predestinated place he already told her she was highly favored told her she was highly favored how will I do this and the angel answered and the the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which is shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God Amen so on her journey she kept these things within her amen she told the angel be it unto me according to Thy word and that's what we've got to do we we take that word within us we take that word within us and that's God in you that's God in you that's deity that's the that's the deity of God in you that we're carrying when we take the word of God simple tonight and we got a long way to go so y'all amen me not very many of us here but praise the Lord praise the Lord God makes everything work out do you believe that amen so he goes on to hear in that same message God is in no hurry we're the ones that get in a hurry just give God a little bit of time and you'll see the old prophetic Wheels cogs run right up in the in the picture it'll develop just like bringing up of a picture and where that woman was going where where God was bringing her was a place of fulfillment of Prophecy a place of fulfillment of scripture and when things don't don't aren't working like we think they should we should still believe that God we we should believe that God's got it all in control that he'll bring his word to pass right yes sir and to think of all the scripture that was about to be fulfilled all the trouble that Joseph and Mary had to go through to get where they needed to be right they were going along they had to travel back it was crowded everywhere nowhere to stay nowhere to go but there was a place that God had for his word to be fulfilled amen it bypasses the greatness of the world it goes to where it will be received it goes to where there will be worship amen God goes It goes to to a place amen it's got someone it goes to someone who will believe it and that same message there God he said God what was he when he was back Yonder millions and millions of years ago when he was there just no space here when he gathered up into the logos and then he came from the logos down into Christ down into that baby and see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth and going right back to God again don't you see what I mean he said just revolve coming down from space from eternity rolling down coming down into the lost from the Lost there into man then returning back again for one purpose to redeem that man that had fallen that was why God Amen moved upon a little virgin Amen to bring forth a son amen that would be a savior that would be a redeemer amen amen he did The Impossible he did The Impossible how could you even fathom that but God interprets his own word he interprets it by bringing it to pass amen so God came for one purpose in that little child to redeem you and I to redeem Humanity had fallen but we see here the god of creation there he come from the logos and we know from that God begin to create he begin to speak he begin to to to express his thoughts and and there there uh he dwelt alone with his thoughts the prophet said and there he spoke and there was no one there to believe his word but he said so God believed his own word and it came to be amen and so that's what you that's what we've got to be and and we're we're we're looking at the message of the deity of Jesus Christ amen and don't don't put it way off here or way out there or way up in heaven y but if the words in you then deity is in you and it will bring forth Jesus Christ it may this this church it may seem like a we bypassed everything we bypassed all the the greatness and we've come here and how in the world are we here why in the world are we in we in Hardy Arkansas or pigy amen but God's got a people to receive his word he's got a place a predestinated place amen and and we don't seem like much we're not much we're nothing but God bypassed everyone else and he sent you his word amen that it could be born within us that we could bring forth Jesus Christ that we that we would have deity within us that's right so there he dwelt alone with his thoughts he he believed he spoke his word he believed his his own word and it came to be and so brother Rand said the first thing that he created was angels to worship him that he said that made him God and St John one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Amen to express his attributes to express who he was that God the god that dwelt alone with his thoughts that he had thoughts to be a savior to be a Healer to be a redeemer the god that allowed the fall to happen so he could come in flesh in Jesus Christ and express to you and I amen who he was as a savior amen as a deliverer amen do we know him is that this evening do we know him amen we were bound we were we were caught up in the things of the world and amen we were just we were enjoying the pleasure of sin and so forth amen but we were lost we were bound but a god Came Upon the scene why because Jesus Christ came amen and expressed himself as a savior as a Healer and we could partake of that because it's Everlasting it wasn't just for those people at that time but it's here for us now amen it wasn't just for old Bible days amen but we can we can partake amen of that God Amen of that deity that was was expressed I'm trying to preach my heart out here this evening so he came he came for one purpose he came from the heavenlies he came down from the logos he came down from the eternities he came down in flesh for one purpose to redeem you and I that had fallen to bring us back to the spiritual relationship that Adam and Eve sold us out for to bring us back to a fellowship and a true worship of almighty God Amen and to those that th those that believe on his name in this hour he will give you power he will give you power to become the deity in flesh amen power to become sons of God Colossians 1 and 16 in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and brother Bram says here he said the the man that lost his origin in the Garden of Eden his relationship communion with God was cut off there because of sin and unbelief unbelief in what the word of God and a picture was painted one time to Eve and told her how much brighter it would be if she just discard the word of God and look over here to reason see Adam and Eve were created for Fellowship but the LIE of the devil came in amen and we've got to put the word of God above our opinion we've got to put it above any any type of reasoning that would come in because because that's what got us in this trouble to begin with and there's got to be a people that take the word of God in their heart and says be unto me I reject what the world says about me I reject what the world says about the gospel I reject what the world and how they try to be little amen the power of God Amen I know the power of God is real I accept that word into my heart be it unto me Lorden Let Jesus be born in my life we were created for Fellowship we were created to worship and have communion with Jehovah yeah they fell from Dominion they fell from that place from that worship by reasoning amen Adam sold us out Adam and Eve sold us out and so we look here so he came to redeem us to redeem Fallen man to redeem us redeem us from what they sold us out for so we look at Adam and Eve they tried to cover their sin on their own but it didn't hide what what had been done from the very beginning God required blood because in God's mind there was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world and so he came down God came down and gave them a covering of sheep skin he gave them their amen there the first message that that God that God would preach amen there there they would they would be covered in in Blood and sheep skin they would hear that message amen you've got to go out but I'll I'll make a way of return one day I I'll make a way of return where you can come back and have that Fellowship sir and so they're walking out covered in blood covered in those skins amen and according to God's law there had to be a Kinsman to bring it back right preach with me here this evening and that was a law that was given by Moses of redemption that had to be a kinsman redeemer there had to be one that was worthy to come one who was able to pay the price one who was able to to redeem and to bring back right one that that could bring back the Lost estate of of someone that had fallen there had to be someone worthy that could come forth and he said God was worthy no man was worthy God was worthy he came down some 1900 years ago in the form of a baby born in a manger overshadowed by the Holy Ghost not born by sexual desire he was God and God's blood was in him amen it was a creative blood it was something not not from man's hands it it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't mixed with man's blood but it was a creative it was a power a creative God the god that that created the universe the god that created you and I that God come down in the womb of a virgin amen and he brought forth a blood he brought forth a blood cell that produced amen a sin killing agent he brought forth something amen that would bring us back yes sir someone that could defeat the enemy someone that could that where where where we couldn't he could and so we looked at Ruth and Boaz just a little bit a while back but this Redeemer he had to be worthy he had to be be able to pay the price and so Boaz had to come forth to be able to redeem redeem Naomi to redeem her estate he had to be a mighty man of wealth and he had to make a public testimony of that so Boaz come forth amen and said who else who else will redeem who else will redeem the Lost state of Naomi and there was a Kinsman there was one that stepped forward but he didn't want to take on Ruth he said no I can't do that so this Mighty Man of wealth there he St he slammed his his shoe down amen as a as a public testimony and said I will redeem I will pay the price and I will bring back and many he had to make a public testimony it couldn't be something that was done in secret it had to be done in open so our lord Jesus when he came as a redeemer he had to make a public testimony and Isaiah 53 says surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did a stream him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted amen there is public testimony he was wounded amen for my transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the strapes we were healed amen he went to Calvary amen he didn't have to go but he went he took you and I amen we were on his mind amen that's what pushed him through amen and he made that public testimony amen I have redeemed them I it is finished anden the devil will no longer have control over their lives amen devil you're through devil it's finished I have redeem them sir amen amen you love love the Lord this evening I tried to give my notes to brother Allan I tried he said he just he just sing it good for me so we look here we look at that that created blood we look at that he said therefore when Mary knowing not a man she was with God Almighty Jehovah he overshadow her and God is the creator that created the blood cell in the womb of Mary not knowing man at all and that brought forth the very creative blood to redeem us from our life coming in here being born of sexual desire amen what was it she took the word of God that was Pro prophesied that a virgin would conceive she took that into her heart am me and it brought forth Emanuel she took what the word said what the angel had told her and said be it unto me according to Thy word and it produced the Messiah produced The Blood to destroy sin and then that blood was drawn from emanuel's veins on calvary's cross and today as the same saving redeeming holy power that it did in that day the transfusion was made out of Calvary says you believe it amen now that's right we're Redeemed by the blood of God we're bought by the blood of God and Redeemed by Blood God's own blood how was it God's blood God has no blood how could it be because it was God's creative blood that he created in order to redeem us and he came and lived in the same body that he created amen we're Redeemed by the blood of God you were created by Him and for him the great Creator became Our Savior amen he brought forth a blood that would redeem us amen amen to bring us back amen that we wouldn't live in sin that we wouldn't live for the devil amen because we were created for him we were created for Fellowship we were created for worship and Redemption brings us back to that praise the Lord sir amen don't live in the pleasures of sin and unbelief amen reject alive God in this hour amen Worship the Lord God serve him with all your heart amen we go on here and look there was no room for him in the end he didn't have a bed to be born in they born in a manger over a manure pile Jehovah humbled himself and became man he became you and I the deity of god Jehovah God became Emanuel God With Us and brother Bron said he said there there was no room for him in the end Got No Room for the god of Heaven to come got no no time for the for the moving of the Holy Ghost and that's where a lot of a lot of the churches have got they got no time amen for the power of God but we ought to make time for the power of God we ought to let him come down here in the end time thinking you know this this may be the last Christmas this may this may be our our last service this may be amen next year may may this may be the coming of the of the Lord this next year this may be it I think God has chosen Us in this hour to be his church to be his bride amen amen we ought to make room for

worshiping today not a baby in a Manger not a Santa Claus but we're worshiping almighty God in the deity of his son he goes on here the deity of him who is he some of them makes a little baby back there he is the one that stood on the invisible and spoke and said let there be light and there was light and there was Jesus Christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognize him not he is the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there to talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make the things which are now out of the things which is not he spoke and it was so and he said that's the same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let the the people deny the power of God say it's wrong with the same power that spoke amen that spoke the world into existence is the same p is in the same people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time that we found out who we are the devil is trying to hide you back tell that you're some little cow down something you're not your sons and your daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you amen and I think you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize the almighty God lives in you immortal life amen it's his life it's God's life amen so it's no more it's no more you doing it it's no

Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so we look here the gift of redemption it's given to you it's given to you amen you don't you don't have to Amen to go go pay the price that's been given to you sir Isaiah 9:6 says For unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and the name his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace So a child is is born but he must grow and mature and a son is given but that he might be about the father's business a son is given that he might grow and mature right so this son was given and something that is given is it's it's been provided it's been entrusted to you it's been issued amen and that which is given it must be received amen you can't just put it on the shelf or or put it off on something else amen you've got to receive that it's been given to you in this hour amen that son came for a purpose amen that he might redeem that he might bring back the Sheep of God Amen the Lost Sheep amen that we would hear his voice and when we receive him into our hearts and so the Son of God was given for that purpose amen he desired no earthly Kingdom to rule he had he had no place to lay his head he had no he had no home he had no earthly Kingdom but he he he chose the heart of man he wanted the heart of man to be his kingdom to be his throne he had no place to go but he wants to rule amen and live in men's heart to become your everything John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son in the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen it's given it's given that word gave is to give to someone God gave of his own son God didn't hold back his son from us he didn't hold back that life that was that was in that blood cell he didn't hold that back from us but God gave his son amen the very expression of God in the form of a son he expressed all that the father was amen it was God's gift of love God gave that to you and I and brother brandham says when when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over and when God so loved the world God's Divine love to Adam's race when he so loved it Christ stepped out and Sovereign Grace took its place God's love was met by Sovereign Grace God gave His only begotten son so Christ God gave his son Christ was was the very heart of God the very expression of who God was Acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so in the name of Jesus Christ is salvation it's not in father son holy ghost or some some made up whatever some made up idea but in the name of Jesus Christ amen it's salvation alone there's not another name given under Heaven whereby men must be saved under that name is forgiveness of sins amen under that name is the filling of the Holy Ghost amen and
