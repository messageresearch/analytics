tonight i believe god is able to meet every one of those needs heavenly father we lord his hands we're up all over the building we believe lord that you are still god and that you still meet needs tonight and i pray that you would do that father you're you're not a high priest that can't be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but you were tempted in every point as we are without sin lord we thank you for that we thank you that you empathize lord with us and you know what we're going through lord and there's something about you that can be touched by the things that we go through and i pray you would touch every heart i pray you take care of every situation you know what it is big or small we serve a real god and we know that you're able to do it thank you for allowing us to come together again lord and worship you with our hearts lord and our bodies our minds with everything that we have lord and i pray you'd help us to move everything out of the way tonight and just let you speak through us and to us lord until we would know that you were the one that did it i pray you'd grant it now we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to hebrews chapter 1. hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 through 14. it's good to see all of you in the house of the lord tonight and good to have caleb and sophie back with us tonight and i know there's a number of others that not able to be here but are watching tonight and god bless you as well hebrews chapter 1 and verse 1 it says god who at sundry times in a diverse manner spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin set down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they i tell you what you could read this book of hebrews and just have a shouting spell just the way that paul writes this he says for unto which of the angels said he at any time or my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits his ministers the flame of fire but unto the sun he saith thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou lord in the beginning hath laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens of the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old and stuff of garment and as the vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same the years shall not fail but to which of the angels saith said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for for them who shall be heirs of salvation let me read that last verse again i want to speak to you on uh new testament angels and that last verse are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation i believe that's us tonight amen i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated i didn't intend to do this in a series of sermons i just wanted to approach this tonight but there's no way we could even scratch the surface so i may pick this up again but the scripture that we just read is used by skeptics to point out that angels do not visit us today that was only for the old testament saints but paul's not saying that god doesn't use angels in fact he says that their purpose is as ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and so there are angels god does use angels today but he's saying christ is better than the angels and that's the theme of hebrews is christ is better than the angels christ is better than the law christ is better than the prophets christ is better than moses paul says that over and over again in the book of hebrews who he's saying he's saying that uh god uses angels but christ is better than the angels now in in fact he expressly affirms angelic intervention by saying that he actually says this is what they do this is what angels do they they're ministering spirits they come out and minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation or they attend to them and you know as and i'll just talk to you for a moment but as a minister and as a as a people of this message we have to be careful that we don't take all the supernatural out of what we believe or put it back in another time even if that time is 50 years ago we've got to believe that god still visits us today that these ministering spirits still come with the howard and come to us it may not be the angel that come to brother branham but there are angels who attend those who are the saints the heirs of salvation [Music] right and and so we believe god has sent forth angels in this day and and you've got to have a supernatural element to what you believe because if it's just word and i say that because i believe the word is supernatural how many believe that tonight the word itself is supernatural the word is alive it's quick the bible says and powerful and able to divide the asunder between the soul and spirit so the word itself is supernatural yet there's a supernatural element that we look to things that we can't explain we don't know how it happened we don't know anything about it we just know it's there we just know it happened right there's got to be that element to our experience in christ that there's something that god did that's beyond what we could dream up beyond what we could imagine beyond anything that we could have ever planned or put together a lot of what's taught today in bible teaching is that well if you take this and and a lot of it's true that if you take this element of faith and put it with this one and put it with that one and stack them together eventually you can have what you want you can name it you can claim it there's a lot of truth to that but there is also a supernatural element sometimes you're just waiting on god to do something and we don't we can't explain abraham could not explain why he had faith for the entire 25 years but one day an angel come by his way and it was about a year after that that that the baby was born in or nine months so it was god moving and sending angels and he said brother ben why does he use angels i don't know it's just how he chooses to do it right because he could do it all himself but he doesn't choose to do it that way sometimes he comes down himself in the old testament he would come in a in a body in a theophany form he would come like melchizedek made himself a body and came down and sometimes he appeared as the angel of the covenant and sometimes he sent another angel right and he sent it for different purposes at different times sometimes he'd speak directly to the prophet sometimes he'd send an angel to speak to a prophet to speak to the people sometimes he'd speak to the people with through an angel and then speak to him through the prophet right and so god has always used angels in his administration and i i don't again i don't understand why he does that but it's how he chose to do it and i wonder today if it if we could just take off our our cynicism for just a moment because i tell you what i'm cynical too sometimes because i was raised in uh in a in a place in a church where there were always angels and visitations and pillars of fire and different things going on all the time and and sometimes you look at that and think and you begin to get skeptical because you realize that a lot of those people don't live right and a lot of them where the rubber meets the road they're just not where they ought to be and sometimes what seemingly the most spiritual people are the ones that have the most seeming angelic visitations and it might be real though it might be because if you look in the scriptures it doesn't angels didn't just come to good people and they did come to the people of god but they come to others as well many times ministering spirits come but but they're there for our for our good right regardless of how they come now they're sent forth to minister for them who should be heirs of salvation and so it's for our benefit that they come they may come an angel might come and influence the the something in an area or in a church or something like that but it's for our benefit and there's people who are who are as false as false can be at the bottom that'll feel the presence of that angel just like you do right and they're completely false yet they're visited by that same angelic feeling that same presence that you feel and they're completely false and yet they feel the same thing but it's still they don't make the angel wrong now and brother branham explains that to us aren't you glad for the message of the hour tonight we don't have to be confused about these things but brother branham in the message and this is used against the message today by people who have left that say well god don't use angels anymore why did brother branham talk about angels and brother branham tells of many angelic visitations in the message he tells of an angelic visitation at his commission and when he tells it you know even to the people he was telling to it sounded strange and us today if you would tell that in the world today and we do it sounds strange to the world until it's sometimes we get kind of a backwards feeling about it with a caleb where we don't really want to tell about it about the supernatural because we think well you know you know god doesn't really work that way anymore and if he does you know people just won't believe it you know and so you kind of get a backwards feeling about that telling about a prophet and about signs and wonders and things like that but to the early church this would not have been strange brother brown's story of an angel coming would have fit right in with multiple angelic visitations in the early church in fact brother branham tells us that there were more angelic visitations in the new testament than in the old testament and you can look at that and see all the angels in the old testament but remember it was spread out over hundreds and hundreds of years but in the new testament in about 75 years of history that we have in the new testament all these angels come and visited the church and and so god has actually didn't he didn't stop dealing with angels he didn't stop working through angels but he actually increased that after the church came now brother branham was speaking about an angelic visitation he said someone said not long ago said brother branham you're mistaken about that man that talks to you that was the lord because this was someone speaking to him a church of christ brother that didn't believe in angels or angelic visitation so he said well that must brother adam that must not have been an angel must have been the lord he and brother brother said i said it was an angel he said i'm sent from the presence of god he wasn't the lord he was an angel and again it sounds almost strange to modern ears but it wouldn't have sounded strange to them right and and we're supposed to go back to that kind of faith and practice and it's a restoration message to restore back the years that the canker were made away and the palm warm and all those things and so and so it shouldn't sound strange to us today to see angels ministering now brother branham tells about that he said he wasn't the lord he was an angel he said and god still has angels and they visit the people amen do we believe that tonight they visit the people he said not a worship of angels but angelic beings who are attributes of god sent forth to minister to the church through the people he said oh my he said how short we are of the real apostolic church today of the blessing and he brings it up in that same sermon he talks about how that well we have a lot of dancing he calls it bubble dancing we have a lot of things like that but how short we are of the real apostolic church today of the blessing of god which is a power that comes that will actually enable you as an anointing it's not just a good feeling that that's effects of the anointing but the anointing is an empowerment to be able to do what you wouldn't otherwise be able to do amen and we need that today don't we because we face the devil that's on the rampage you know it's amazing the modern church believes in demons but don't believe in angels and so it's a one-sided fight but alan they're fighting without any weapons because they they don't believe in spiritual warfare well you just have to pray and believe that god will but god has a has a side he got people on his side too in fact he said there's more with us than be with them hallelujah now in psalms 34 and 7 and the old testament promise was that the angel the lord encampeth around about them that fear him and delivereth them and those new testament believers but howard believed that they believed that they believed that god that an angel would actually be there god would send his angels i wonder if we can believe that tonight i know it's a little bit different kind of a sermon for me but just to kind of catch our attention in supernatural things if if we could believe that god sends his angels to this service his messengers could come and stand here and reveal to us the word and speak to us and help us in our lives and that old testament promise those new testament saints held on to that because god never did away with that now the first thing that we find in the new testament as far as an angelic appearance is in acts chapter 1 and verse 10 immediately after the ascension of christ immediately there are two angels that show up on the scene and what they do is they begin to reveal secrets hidden in the word right watch what happens while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he went up they watched him go and he said okay what now right they needed to know what now now the coming of christ was all through the old testament if if you talk about his his uh his final coming but yet there was a hidden mystery of the second coming that wasn't revealed in the old testament it was there and tight but it wasn't revealed and how it would be and these angels come because one of the one of the things you'll run into when people try to tear down the message is they'll try to say well angels wouldn't come and reveal anything all angels would do is come and help you in some way well the first thing they did was begin to reveal the word because while they look steadfastly toward heaven these two men in white apparel which also said you men of galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same jesus now they're preaching corporal body they're preaching a return of christ that hadn't been known before jesus alluded to it he talked about it and all these things but they didn't know in what manner he would come but here come two angels that come down and reveal to the church he said which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven huh i still believe that today you got to be careful how much you spiritualize right because if you over spiritualize things eventually you get to where there's no angels there's no help there's nothing oh it's just the word brother ben and i believe in the word more than anybody but the word has some power to it and some effects from him so if we see this then why would it be strange to see an angel come to a prophet to reveal the mysteries hidden in the word if those angels come to those original disciples to reveal to them the coming of the lord revelation 22 and 6 speaks of an angel coming in the new testament so i'm skipping ahead here to the end and we'll touch some of these others maybe later if god helps us but in revelation 22 and 6 he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophet sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must be shortly be done sounds like god still reveals things in the new testament by angels now it was an angel with a revelation for john and we know there are heavenly angels and earthly angels maybe we'll get in more into this this is a fascinating study but maybe we'll get more into this at a later time but brother branham talks about how solomon built his temple and just give you some background and it's involvement gilead but the random is is talking before a prayer line and they're not having a prayer line where of discernment a discernment line they're having a prayer line where the ministers will come and lay hands on the people so he's lined up the ministers in front like like we would today and you have a double line and everybody lays hands on the people when they come through now people don't understand prayer lines i watch them when a prayer line is for the purpose of having hands laid on you you might stop and shout and scream and whatever you might go through and and stay for 20 minutes and somebody pray for you but that's that's valid okay that's a wonderful thing but a prayer line really all you have to do is have hands laid on you because that's what the promise of the word is they'll lay hands on the sick doesn't even say they'll pray so when brother branham had a prayer line like that what he called a fast line he would send the people through and then as they come through he'd lay hands on them and say bless my sister in the name of jesus something like that and they would come through why because it wasn't up to brother branham he was fulfilling the word by standing there and they were fulfilling the word by going through right now so we still believe in that today god still does that but that's what brother branham is talking about here he said did you ever notice how solomon built his temple he said listen close when you entered into the door what happened there was angels carved out of olive wood with their wings tipping across every worshiper coming to the holy seat come right down across the tips of these angels wings right down to the mercy seat right down to the altar and you can go and read that in in where he talks about how that he built the temple solomon built the temple it describes those angels wings that touched one another and were so wide and touched the walls of the of the holy of holies in solomon's temple now he said you know the order of solomon's temple he said well what is an angel a messenger he said get the dictionary find out what an angel means he said some of them some of them's heavenly messengers some of them's earthly messengers that god dwells in to bring his earthly message and brother adam's talking now about the ministers that are standing out there and are laying hands on people he said and these are messengers angels of the lord messengers to you or if we could only receive it like that now if we could only receive it like that we can see how god sent a prophet and he was a messenger to the age and we received that ministry if we could only receive if we can only see that god sends angels today not to take his place but to be stand there and fulfill the word messengers who he said they're standing there with the hands out to obey what god says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it has to happen amen amen so it's not the length or the sincerity or anything of the prayer it's the fact you come according to god's word and god's word said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and it has to happen so you should be expecting god to do what he said and that will bring a shout that will bring hallelujah that will maybe make you speak in tongues or whatever it does but it's what is it it's god fulfilling his word you get so excited because you know you don't have to shout you don't have to speak in tongues because the promise is true regardless of how you feel right now hallelujah he says do you believe that every one of you coming through amen i still believe in angels today look at that authority that god gave an earthly angel let's turn our attention for just a moment to revelation chapter 18 and verse one because we're talking about angels that would come and now earthly angels and heavenly angels while we're talking about earthly angels let's look at this revelation 18 1 he said after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and brother branham explained to us what that was and i'll go on in just a moment but i was back here in the back and i'm kind of struggling with that verse i always have because of the way that it's written and but i believe what brother brown said about it but i've kind of struggled with that and i looked at into my my bible program on my on my ipad and it sets out a commentary on one side and the bible on the other and the commentary that happened to be pulled up when i pulled up that scripture was adam clarke's this is what he said about that scripture he said the earth was lightened with his glory he said this may refer to some extraordinary messenger of the everlasting gospel who by his preaching and writings should be the means of defusing the light of truth and true religion over the earth i looked at that and about how to spell by the same over 200 years ago under that anointing of a man you understand that knowledge of looking at the scripture and said well this must be a messenger amen an earthly messenger and that's what brother brown said it was even though the angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory now so it goes on in verse two he said he cried mightily with a strong voice notice what he does he cries and says saying babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and it's become the habitation of devils in the hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird he comes in and preaches an indictment on that system huh he comes and tells us why we're not part of that organized religion why we're not a denomination so he comes and he says she's become the habitation of devils and he said for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich to the abundance of her delicacies so he comes in attacking that that worldly church that uh that horror of revelation 17 and so he comes doing that and and then verse four he said then i heard another voice from heaven another voice noticed from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues notice this angel is the last messenger before the coming of christ in the 19th chapter of revelation i had some of that in here and i took it out to save time but you go to the 19th chapter of revelation and begins to talk about a bride and how that she would be how that she would be putting on some clothes amen she'd be clothed in white raiment and all the things about a bride and he said this messenger he said it's the last messenger before the coming of christ in the 19th chapter of revelation the messenger's voice he said if we notice when he gave his voice on the earth there was a voice echoed again in heaven he said in the fourth verse he said the mess this messenger on the earth now watch this this is what god can do through an angel you believe he still uses angels this messenger on the earth was so inclined with god until when he spoken on the earth god echoed the same thing out of heaven hallelujah and brother brother says what is that fourth verse translation what does it mean he says god's voice speaking to his predestinated people hallelujah saying come out of here now we've heard the voice on earth have we heard the voice from heaven which echoes the voice on earth amen what is it the voice of predestination that's why some come and go that's why some leave the message of the hour countless nothing say he's a false prophet why they heard the voice on earth but they never heard the echo of it it's god's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying come out of her amen he said that just exactly what the voice was he's got people all out in there all out through babylon come out of her let you be not partakers of her sins yes they're out of that dogma and creates to the word made spirit and life amen that's what god can do and here in revelation 19 i may have kept some of this in here yes revelation 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready notice this messenger had to come this angel had to come in order for this bride to come his wife hath made herself ready in verse 8 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the final enemies the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet notice to worship him who the angel the one that come down lighting the earth he's so powerful he said i fell at his feet to worship him he said to me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy paul says are not they all ministering spirits they're not jesus he's better than the angels he's better than the messenger he's better than the pastor he's better even the messenger of the age amen but thank god god sends angels you've got to recognize it as an angel the old testament is full of stories where the angel would come and the person wouldn't recognize what it is and you remember when jacob is wrestles with an angel he wrestles with an angel the angel went as if he would go on he just passed by the camp and something about the way that he operated something about what he was doing alerted jacob to the fact i got i gotta wrestle with this man he got he got something for me there's something about it i got i need a change in my walk i need a change in my life and this man is able to tell me what i need he's able to tell me my identity hallelujah and jacob probably couldn't put that into words he probably couldn't couldn't explain it by himself but there was something inside of him that said this man is going to tell me who i am this man is going to tell me something about this this angel that god he come down by the way if we can only grab hold of the word like that today there's something about this message of the hour that'll get that'll reveal my identity there's something about what god said in this hour that'll show me that i'm not jacob i'm a i'm israel a prince with god not just a shy strum not just who i was but i've had a name change and identity change amen amen i just want to do some teaching tonight so y'all hang with me i'm looking god's word good he said now brother brown said now true angel he said now you're going to throw back joseph smith and so forth to me you know there's another objection people bring up you talk to them about the message of the hour and i've been thinking about this because i've had many opportunities since i've been here people come in that door and to talk to them about an angel messenger and about a message that comes in our day and people watch our services not just from messaged churches but people from the area and that come by and they see the church on the side of the road and i'm thankful that we're available like that that people can see it because there's got to be a predestinated seat out there somewhere and i've had the opportunity to talk to several people about this and it it's been on my mind that you know and i told you about the young man to come in and i've not seen him again but that young man come in a while back and said do you he proposed to me the question he said do you believe that god could still work through prophets today i said yes i do believe that let me tell you about a prophet that god worked through and see i believe god sends people by our way for that reason but one of the objections that people throw out there is well aren't you just like the mormons see joseph smith was visited by angels in fact he wasn't just visited by an angel he was visited i think by 28 angels and i don't mean to make light of it but it just it didn't make any sense but brother branham said this he said you're going to throw back joseph smith and so forth to me but watch he said it don't work with the scripture a real true angel will come and vindicate the scripture to the dot he said notice he said that john fell down and wanted to worship that angel and he said see that you do it not now remember when those angels come to joseph smith he fell down before him brother branham never did that he fell down before christ he saw jesus twice i think he said but he fell down before him but he never worshiped the angel joseph smith fell down before the angel and the angel received the worship and the the mormons today will say oh we don't we don't worship angels joseph smith didn't worship angels but he prostrated himself before him a true angel he said won't be worshipped he said it's not worship of angels it's a ministry of angels that comes from god amen the angel is a servant he comes from the throne room of god he comes from god's presence and he says i'm sent from the presence of god to tell you very bad amen now angels in the new testament the book of acts the next instance that we find is in acts chapter 8 verse 26 i hope i'm not boring you tonight but you just stay with me acts chapter 8 and verse 26 it says the angel of the lord spaking to philip saying rise and go toward the south until the way that goeth down from jerusalem to gaza which is desert one of the other objections that people have is they say well if an angel would come why would god send an angel to commission a prophet why wouldn't he just do that himself but you find again in the book of acts that god does that very thing that he sends an angel down to a man named philip and tells him what to do right so the angel come to philip and said go down toward the south onto the way that go down from jerusalem to gaza which is desert what did he tell brother branham he told him go pray for god's sick people right i sent you to pray for the sick kings and monarchs and so forth and so it's the same thing so again the people in you tell that story in that first church they wouldn't have batted an eye this was happening all over the place right but today it seems strange and you might ask the question well why didn't the angel do it himself again but that's not how god works usually now the angel something sometimes it's in reverse order sometimes the angel prepares the way and then the messenger comes and we'll get to that in a moment but but usually usually god will send an angel to a man a heavenly messenger to an earthly messenger who then goes to the people right that's usually both the old and new testament how it works he would come to a prophet an angel would come to a prophet or to a great a righteous man somewhere or to a woman for that matter angels come to women in the bible do you know that angels come to him it was just limited to men but he would come to them and then they would tell the angel's message you remember what happened to mary and the others there at the tomb the angel come to him and told him go tell my disciples the very first thing that they ever had to do those disciples had to listen to a woman's testimony and a bunch of guys you know big burly men like that fishermen and tax collectors they were men's you know uh men's men or whatever they were manly men and here come these women who said hey we know something you don't some angels come and told us he's risen amen brother branham says this about about that he said oh lord he said wake up the church right quick lord he's praying he said and i'm sure you'll do it you said one time when you looked upon the harvest and said laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest he said now father we know that you want us to ask we're partners with you it's got to be us together he said we realize not even an angel can do it it takes men do we believe the words of a prophet today not even an angel can do it it takes them in he said philip was sent to the eunuch he said certainly lord he was sent there by an angel but it took philip's hands amen he said we realized a vision came to paul on his road down to damascus but it took ananias hands amen he said the church the called out the elected one peter was sent by vision up to cornelius but it took the apostle not the vision not the angel amen say oh god would only speak to me if he would only tell me what he wants me to know he tells you on sunday morning he tells you on wednesday night he tells you through the week if you listen to the prophet speaking on tape or however you listen to it he tells you all the time he don't just many times you don't come to us directly although he can do that but what does he do he sends this bin amen he sends messengers to come and tell us what we have need of hallelujah say why because that's the way he chose to do it it was hidden you go and study that sometimes god was hidden in simplicity because he was hidden in flesh hidden behind the veil of flesh huh it was too simple because he come and hid himself behind human flesh and people said this flesh we know what flesh is it can't be right because the only witness to it is him well that's the way it usually happened in the bible is that god would speak to one man and then that one man would come to the people and tell him about it so it's a watch i mean today people want affidavits they want the newspapers to carry it they want to go back and study it all out and find out did it happen you realize that the newspapers are controlled by the devil huh right or the democrat party one or the other maybe maybe the same thing but it is it's controlled the the world powers that be one of the greatest powers there is in the world is the power of the press it's controlled by the devil why would you ever expect they can't even write if there's an accident down here on the four lane they can't even write about the accident correctly and we know that's right they don't ever give all the details to their brother joe they don't ever get it all right huh and a lot of times they don't know nothing about it's just an agenda they already have a pre-printed story and just change the names and the dates and if you're good at noticing patterns you can go through the news and notice patterns over and over again every time there's a shooting they call for gun control i don't mean to get political but every time it happens every time because it's controlled by by a worldview it's controlled by the enemy all politics is conservative liberal whatever it is it's all controlled by the enemy and so is the press so you're not going to find vindication through that but it's got to be something that speaks to you that voice from heaven that speaks to you that says this is the word this isn't a mormon this isn't something else this is what god said he would do in the bible amen amen but he said it took he said the apostle not the vision not the angel he said god i pray tonight listen to a prophet's prayer i pray tonight that you'll wake people up and let them see that the promise is here amen oh i pray that you'll wake people up and let them see that the promise is here it was given to that church he said whosoever sin you remit to them you're remitted so i'm waiting on an angel maybe you're the angel god wants to send a messenger earthly and heavenly messengers now this is the attitude brother branham had and we'll move on but the attitude brother branham had towards earthly messengers was this he said young preacher get into the field i've taken this as a personal challenge in my life stay into the harness stay into the harness he said brother ben nobody let me preach stay in the harness stay in the harness keep studying keep keep preparing keep getting keep being ready because they'll come a day god will use you he may only use you one time he don't have to use you any more than that but stay in the harness he said young preacher get into the field stay into the harness he said all you young preachers and things don't you sit around don't you just sit and do nothing get out yonder and win a soul everybody wants to preach up here but there's a lot more to it than that huh i thank god for young men god's given us in this church that don't they they've never put pressure on me to preach and i appreciate that it makes me want to preach them more and i've tried to preach them more than they have preached but but i appreciate that it means a lot but there is something that we can do he said well i'm not just a preacher but you're a witness and brother brother said if you don't know anything else tell them how the fire got lit i got some good advice years ago from brother ivy that i never forgot on a telephone call i was going to preach for him the first time he said brother ben he said as message people we expect a person to be right when they preach to be correct about what they're saying because we're not living in the time of denomination anymore we expect when a man preaches that what he says is going to be right if he says something that's wrong people shut you down and so it's harder in some ways to get into a message pulpit than any other place and it should be because you you should have something to say we're not here just just wasting our time just spinning in the wind it's got to be anointed there's got to be something that's right it's going to be something for the hour that's for the day that you're living in and so but he told me this he said david used what he knew all he knew was a rock and a and a slingshot but he used what he knew and i've taken that and i've taken this in my ministry as through the years that i've been preaching he said don't just sit and do nothing get out you underwent a soul use what you've got you've got a testimony i hear some of you sometimes i'll hear your testimony and some of you i don't even know your testimony yet but those of you who have talked to me about it you you'll tell me how you come to the message of the hour what you've been through in your life some of the things that you've been through and it encourages me i know it would be an encouragement to somebody else it's an encouragement to me when i hear it tell your testimony go out you underwent a soul maybe you're not very good at telling but you can support somebody who does but he said get out you underwent a soul do something get on get moving don't stop he said young preacher over there god bless your heart brother branham never told him to stop he never told him to stay home and go get a job no if god's using them go and be used that was paul's attitude too paul's attitude was and i don't believe a minister should have a job unless his job is ministry right huh he said he got to provide for his family if not he's worse than an infidel right but but but you understand what i'm saying don't just sit and do nothing there's a world out there there you say well there only may only be one left and that one's probably in africa we don't know that you may walk in these doors next sunday morning and you've disqualified yourself so much i don't know who i'm preaching to tonight but just just hang with me for a moment we disqualify ourselves so much that we don't even want to talk to people well if this person knew what i was like and knew what i was i'm not always a perfect christian and i don't always think and say the right things but you don't understand just being friendly that somebody that come in the door could make a world of difference [Music] but in the back of our minds so many times there's this there's this scarecrow that says well if they knew what we believed about angels and visitation all this stuff they'd think we were crazy well so what but if they knew the bible but i tell you what you'd be surprised how many how many people are sitting in a dead cold church somewhere in some denominational system that wish they had some some element of the supernatural in their life we find angels lastly giving instructions to believers acts chapter 10 and verse 1. see we haven't even got to peter and paul and all the other angels that visited men in acts and we won't get to those tonight but let's just take this one and then we'll close acts chapter 10 and verse one there's a certain man in caesarea called cornelius i don't know if i pronounced that correctly a centurion of the band called the italian band in other words he was he was way up in the military a devout man one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god always god sees your generosity it doesn't go unnoticed by god right and god sees i'm when you pray you don't don't think that he don't see it he may not answer the way you want him to but don't think you don't see it this man prayed to god and gave alms to the people and he saw in the vision evidently or if i understand that correctly it means that when he saw the vision it was it was very clear to him he saw about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming into him and it shows us that because the ninth hour of day he wouldn't be sleeping he wouldn't be asleep so it's not a dream it's a vision and he saw an angel of god coming into him and saying unto him cornelius i know you think about the language that's used there brother brown talks about that angel he heard the footsteps bare feet on the floor and he saw that light and then he saw this angel come in step into the light and here it says an angel in the night there of the day an angel of god coming into him maybe walking through the door just like that why would an angel need to go through a door i don't know he can dissolve into a rainbow you've heard billy paul's testimony about that he can do whatever he wants to huh but but he chose to come to the door and he come into him however he got there he come into him amen and he saw that and sent him cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and see when you when you come to an angel it's always it makes you happy but an angel is a fearful thing brother branham said when he saw christ he said he was a man he said that look like just one word the whole world would be judged but he said it was also the most loving face that you ever could see but he was that kind of a man he had authority and this angel had authority he said and he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine arms or come up for a memorial before god amen you think god forgives god don't forget they've come up for a memorial before god now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter he lodges with one simon and tanner we've seen specifics like this before haven't we you live on such and such a street your address is your name is amen go put that you wanna you wanna build some faith go put that in the message sometime go put into the message infobase put your name is huh your name is in quotes put it in there you'll find hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times where brother branham tells somebody where they come from their name what their name was it would be impossible for him to memorize all those names and many times they didn't even have prayer cards sister brown didn't have a prayer card he said mr brown what was it he knew her name because god spoke the angel was there and it revealed to him in a vision but now he knew cornelius's name and he begins to tell these specifics he he lodges with one simon of tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell you what thou art us to do when the angel which spake in the cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa you know watch he sent them to japan because he knew that they would he called it a devout soldier he didn't just tell everybody about it but he told somebody you knew he would believe and he went because he had a mission for him to do when he declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa and so i would ask you tonight does god still work like that could god prepare the way i've seen him do it i've seen days when i was going to preach and i knew i was going to preach and i just couldn't get the mind of the lord oh once the presence come in the room and all at once i began to find out and it just began to flow and i just all of a sudden it took me about and it's this way you know if you're studying for a sermon but allan knows this is true if you're studying for a sermon and you have to dig it out yourself it could take days or you could take hour after hour but if there's something clicks all of a sudden you get that inspiration and you know you got it for some reason why because an angel i believe the angel god prepares the way we don't know why we say it but god knows and maybe he would go to your house and prepare the way maybe you don't even recognize him because you're busy and you're going through life just for everyday life just going on it's going about your business all of us in a presence of god comes in see we've got to stay where we can contact him stay where we can where we can feel it where we can know when he's there so many times we get so busy we just don't know it but he prepares the way i believe he still does that today i know he did brother branham's ministry brother brown tells a story in a sermon in 1948 called called the angel of god i won't read the whole story to save time but he tells a story about a woman who saw the angel of the lord and saw that with hair dark hair to his shoulders white robe he said she had never heard about the angel visiting him but she was telling the people that were there about this and she saw the angel of the lord she didn't know that it was the angel of the lord and she saw the same angel he saw and she when she was sick she was telling the people after she'd been prayed for she was telling them who was that man with brother branham who was that man with brother branham and brother branham tells us that this angel did not pray for the sick but she told him she said there was a man standing by you watching you as you prayed for the sick that's good enough for me she said that man that brother branham saul come in and give him his commission was standing there watching him as he prayed for the sick and so he's praying for the sick and and brother branham says now that's the angel of god he said he's been seen many times in the services he said and i know that he's here tonight i know that he's here he said i've felt him three or four times since i've been here now see brother branham didn't always see him but he knew when he was there and even the people could feel the presence of that angel brother branham would explain that in the prayer line that's his presence that's that's the angel of god now but lebron says he said now that someone might know he said now many people understand he's he misunderstands he said now this is in no means friends in angel worship it is not he said i do not pray in the name of the angel or even know his name do you know that brother brown did not know the name of the angel the lord that come to him he said but if you'll check the scriptures he said when god sends his people it's an angel that directs them maybe you've had an angel come to you and you don't know it maybe an angel sent you to church tonight when god sends his people amen and you see things happen in a supernatural way because there's evidently been a work of the holy spirit through angels or whatever way that god works god can work any way he wants to but you see things happen and so many coincidences stack up and you begin to think god was that you huh was that you we saw that we saw that happen with the church up here when we owe money here on the fellowship hall and i don't want to bring this up to pat myself on the back or or even the brothers and sisters from there but but but we saw god do that i believe god did that put a church up in the middle of nowhere across on the wrong side of the railroad tracks up for sale closed within one week for twice as much as i thought they would get and paid off a fellowship hall that we were worried about concerned about because of all that we were going through how do you know that an angel didn't visit the buyer are you with me now oh you've seen god move for you in miraculous ways many times and we don't even understand how or why because we're in this age that we live in there's such a darkness on the age but just remember he's still working very bad god will put something to plant a seed in somebody's mind let them let them feel influenced to do a certain thing and you don't know what that is many times i've seen someone would come to me after a service and they're influenced to say a certain thing to me and i can tell many times they're influenced by god to do that now sometimes people are influenced by the devil too that's true they'll come to you right at your weakest moment try to tear you down but god always when he comes he comes not to tear you down but he comes with the word ah he comes with the word and it's something that'll build you up amen amen or warn you of some danger an angel and you say well does this primarily how god works no he primarily works to the influence of the holy spirit in your life but he does work this way acts 10 34 peter says we won't read this whole sermon but in verse 34 he said peter opened his mouth instead of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons why because god sent an angel to cornelius and when cornelius told peter about it he believed it it wasn't strange to him he says but in every nation that he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him verse 44 while peter yet spake these words he remember he preaches to him a sermon tells them about christ he said while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word he said well i received the holy ghost you can receive a refilling of the holy ghost while the word is being preached that's right but they received the holy ghost while the word was being preached amen it fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished that god didn't have to use her denomination he didn't have to use our own way of doing things god did it the way god does it in a supernatural way amen hallelujah some people you know they'll drag your feet because they think there's no way god could work in this there's no way oh that's too much emotion or that's too little or too much of this too much of that there's no way god can use this but when god does it you just have to let him do it and they have the circumcision were astonished because as many as come with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost but they heard them speak with tongues to magnify god notice they knew that the holy ghost had been poured out on them now because they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god and this leads pentecostal people to believe well tongues must be the evidence of the holy ghost but you can find places in the scripture where someone does not speak with tongues after receiving the holy ghost but it is something that's common in the new testament it's not foreign and i just want to go here for just a moment and then we'll close i know i've used up all my time but they heard them speak with tongues you realize a troubling thought come to me several years ago that some of our message children could be raised in church and never hear tongues and and i don't mean to place it out of order because brother brandon put it in order and the way it should be because of the pentecostal church and things that were going on but there are many people today who have never spoken in tongues in the message i would say most most people i've never spoken in tongues i don't want to make you feel bad about that because brother branham only spoke in tongues a few times in his life right we know he was close to god but tongues is a valid expression of the holy ghost right we haven't done a way we don't tear out those those parts of the scripture i've heard people say that god forgive me but now i tell other people that if you think you shouldn't say you shouldn't say it so i'm going to keep my mouth shut about that but but you know if you the lord's just helping me all the time but you know if you if you go around and let me put it this way if you go around you say that that uh all they did on the day of pentecost was like talking on the parking lot after church that's not what a prophet said he said mary you go look it up what brother ram said happened he said that was his opinion i'd take his over mine god's still moves in these ways right but again it's not the evidence of the holy ghost so let's look at that for just a moment then we'll close i know i promised that four times now brother branham says this about about tongues he said don't ever face a person believe they got the holy ghost because they speak in tongues see but you believe they have the holy ghost because of the fruits that they bear for jesus said by their fruits you shall know them that's right by their fruit we all got that he said now but but now let me just not get away from that now he said because i don't want to dishonor a great gift that god has given and i believe that a spirit-filled man or woman or a child that lives under the altar of god won't live there long until they'll be speaking with tongues he said see i believe that he will do it or she he said now you can receive the holy ghost and maybe you didn't speak with tongues when you got it see but if you constantly lay there before god all the time with baptism after baptism striking you something's going to take place you say why did they speak with tongues because they were so full of the spirit of god right at some point you've got to be full enough of the spirit of god to do something beyond what you normally do maybe all you normally do is just sit there and you get so full of spirit of god you can just barely get the hand up but it's something right and someone said as i said i think i said that last wednesday night but you know you can you can say well it's just a carnal impersonation but so it's sitting like a bump on a log everybody's impersonating somebody right but the ron spencer told me one time he said everybody said they're afraid of getting in the flesh he said how else would you worship god huh you're in the flesh so you can't help it till we're resurrected get out of here he said but you didn't speak with tongues when you get it he said but if you constantly lay there before god all the time with baptism after baptism striking you something's going to have to take place he said you'll get so full someday do you can't talk nothing else so you try to say something you just can't say it no more you just can't say it many times that people realize he said that that was the holy spirit they'd go ahead and just open their heart up and let god speak to them and i've watched that i watch faces i know i look down quite a bit but i also watch people in church and i've watched people's faces while the preaching of the word is going on and you feel that presence of god and they don't know what to do with it right and they sit there and it's just like it's just this expression is i don't know what to especially people that are new you just just have no idea what to do with this huh and then you see them if they'll stick around eventually they'll they learn how to respond to that but at first many times they'll miss a blessing they'll come out of a good service and say well everybody got blessed everybody was excited i don't know why because they just still never got that full he said but you get so full someday till you can't talk nothing else see you try to say something you just can't say it no more he said you just can't say it many times when people realize that that holy that was the holy spirit they go ahead and just open their heart up and let god speak to them the bible said with stammering lips and other tongues while i speak to this people isaiah 28 18 i was stammering lips with other tongues while i speak and brother branham goes on to demonstrate a stammer listen to the tape he said i want to ask you brethren have you ever felt the holy ghost shake you so bad you just can't couldn't hardly say nothing i don't want to listen i don't want to have a church where it can't happen are you with me i i understand not everybody does it i understand but i don't want to be raised my kids in a place where the spirit of god is completely shut off because i know what he did for me i know what it's like to be drunk in the spirit of god i know what it's like to have the word revealed so real to you that you forget about everything and you just sit there under that word and it just keeps flowing and keeps flowing i know what that's like and i want my kids to be able to experience that you understand and so i'm not if anybody again i'm a cynic by nature because of the way i was raised but i you can't let that that that way that you were raised impact you to the point where you can't worship god and sure we've all seen lots of impersonation but there's there's a reel somewhere and i believe it's here tonight amen and that's the word it's the word that changes our lives that's the difference in us and the pentecostals we don't do it because the music's on we worship god because the word amen as it's burning in our hearts hallelujah amen now he said he said you couldn't hardly say nothing would just sit quiet sometime to sit there and cry how did you do that well that's the holy ghost he said the reason people don't speak with tongues many times they don't know how to yield themselves to the spirit and they're looking for something way off when it's right on them he said that's the reason they don't he said and then some people just get themselves worked up in a motion and say a bunch of words has no meaning to it and still ain't got the holy ghost and try to say they have because they spoke in tongues he said but by their fruits you shall know them they spoke with tongues and magnified god the bible says but listen why did they hear the word in the first place musicians go ahead and come i'ma i'm gonna stop i'm almost done anyway why did they hear the word because an angel directed them to the message of the hour listen they heard the word because they were there that day you ever thought about that i want to be there someday god's going to move over you so much you might speak with tongues you're not going to do that unless you're under the spout brother brown talked about that bride being washed by the water of the word he said she can't be washed unless you stay under the spout unless you stay under that word uh you can't be washed if you're not there to receive it amen because i'm telling you there is a difference between the atmosphere here and the atmosphere just hearing the tape if you don't believe that talk to somebody who was in the meetings of brother branham talk somebody who was there that atmosphere that was there and that i believe that atmosphere carries on the tapes but it's the word that we hear but it's different when you're there amen you love the lord tonight what did the angel do it directed cornelius to the word amen to an earthly messenger who had the word what will true a true angel do today it will point you back to it to the word of god always it'll point you to an earthly messenger who has the word of god amen that's what we do we're not glorifying a man the angel wasn't glorifying peter but he was pointing cornelius to a messenger that could help him they could preach the word to him so he could receive the holy ghost listen why don't we see angels today because of the veil of flesh hebrews 6 and i'll just read verse 19. i've got verse 18 verse 19 says which hope we have is an acre of the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil the hope that we have goes beyond the veil this is the veil right why don't we see god moving in angelic visitations more because of this that's me too right this gets in the way the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing god brother branham says face to face in this church amen the veil he said is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their positions standing by the seats and rebecca branham told that story you know brother branham would tell how there were 300 ushers cleared the aisle so he could come down and and when he come down to pray and then the angel of the lord took to his picture the lord the pillar of fire had his picture taken with the pillar of fire in houston and all those ushers cleared the way and rebecca branham will tell that story she said there was no ushers there think about that there's no ushers there but in a supernatural realm a prophet of god is seeing something amen and he proved it because he took a pillar a picture of the pillar of fire with him amen he said the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their positions this morning standing by the seats we play surely the presence of the lord you know that it's in sea i think the angel of the lord visited in the old testament a woman named hagar twice you remember the story that struck me the other day it's what got me thinking about angels it struck me why would he visit hagar twice he only visited sarah once it's true but the angel of the lord visited hagar twice the first time when abraham kicked her out of the house you remember the story or sarah was so mean to her she run away the first time right and she goes out in the desert and is there by a spring of water crying and weeping about her situation and hey the angel of the lord comes down and begins to talk to her and tells her don't be afraid of sarah go back into abraham's house you've heard you've read the story that's i believe in genesis chapter 16. if you go a few chapters over you'll find now ishmael has been born and he's getting to about 13 years of age he begins to make fun of isaac and sarah says the son of that woman is not going to be heir with the with my child and so sarah gets on abraham and abraham asked the lord and he said go ahead and send him out i'll make of him a great nation and he says this he said because he is thy seed because he is thy seed so an angel visited her not because of who she was but because she had abraham's seed he understood she had received seed from abraham that was his child even though it wasn't the seed by a promise it was still abraham's seed amen amen you think about that he said he'll be a wild man his hand will be against every man you see the muslims today how they've taken over that part of the earth why because they're abraham's seed natural right but god spoke through an angel to her the second time she was out there and she laid the baby down because they were going to die out in the desert and the angel the lord come and showed her where water was and spoke to her and said he won't die and god will make a great nation out of your son why because the boy was abraham's seed listen to me if god could do that for a boy that was just a natural seed not even by the correct order that was the seed of a slightly doubted promise if he could do that like we would say for a denominational system for something that wasn't even right if she could see an angel not once but twice that could save her when she was in trouble don't you know that god still has angels today don't you believe that god if hagar could see an angel how much more could god send his angels down in this building tonight he can send his angels down where you're at tonight that he could speak to you and if we could only look beyond the veil of flesh we'd see they don't always reveal themselves in physical form but they're here amen what do we believe it amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father [Music] i think in the old testament of a time when elijah elijah the prophet was weary and the prophet of god told us that there at the juniper tree that there was an angel god found the angel with the softest hands to come down and caress his brow just to make him feel a little better found an angel that could cook to come down and cook food had vitamins in it that he'd go in the strength of it 40 days and 40 nights lord if you would do that for your weary prophet who didn't even have the courage to stand anymore for the word maybe there's some weary ones tonight lord maybe that's us tonight on a wednesday night if you do that at that moment lord i believe you could do it tonight lord maybe there's someone here that needs to feel the comforting hand of an angel maybe there's someone who's been through been through the worst period of their life they've been through the the storm that's so dark and so black they never thought they'd come out of it but you sent an angel in the midst of it to speak a messenger from god saying it's going to be okay i get in when he was hiding down there in the in the threshing floor he was hiding and the angel the lord come to him and said get in you're a mighty man of valor oh god i pray that would be so tonight i know the angels are here i know your holy spirit is here but i pray god that you would speak i pray lord that you would reveal yourself i pray lord you'd help us father to push beyond the veil of flesh maybe sometimes we just need to worship a little bit maybe sometimes we need to get past our job we need to get past what people did to us and what they said to us through the week we need to get past sitting in traffic lord sometimes we just need to come aside and rest for just a few moments and set our minds at rest so we can begin to push past that veil of flesh to be able to see angels standing at their positions it's always meant so much to me lord i believe it i take that word of a prophet today and i believe it i believe that the angels are standing here because it's based on your word which said that it encamps around those that believe him i pray you'd grant it lord i pray you'd move in every life may they recognize you lord in whatever way you work in our lives may we recognize you maybe we'd be quick to respond to the angel of the lord we feel the presence of god may we just enter right into it lord we've got these meetings coming up lord and things that are going to be going on lord as your presence i undoubtedly will come in this place when people gather their licks of fire together oh god would you just come down and help us lord to respond to it help us start to receive from it it's not just for visitors or somebody else but it's me oh lord i'm the one that needs an angelic visitation i pray you'd grant it god thank you for this church lord for sitting patiently tonight through a long sermon i pray you'd bless them abundantly i pray they receive an angelic visitation lord from from just the way that they've been and the stand that they've took for your word i pray you granted god like cornelius did in jesus name amen do you believe he's here tonight let's just worship him a moment amen hallelujah i believe he's here oh surely let's stand together in the presence [Music] [Music] thank you lord i see glory on each place almost surely the sing it one more time oh surely oh god presence of the

worth a living because he lives once again oh because he lives i can face tomorrow [Music] because he lives all my fear is gone because i know yes i know he holds my future in life is worth the living
