we commit ourselves into your faithful hands have your way Among Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we'll go straight to the word we want to turn to the book of St Mark the 16th chapter the book book of St Mark the 16th chapter and then we're also going to read in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 amen wasn't that a wonderful service last night amen the Lord just using our brother brother Daryl there in a supernatural way and we sure count it an honor to be ministering with brother Daryl and of course our pastor brother Shawn and brother Wendell and amen just a just a wonderful time how many appreciates these meetings amen we sure appreciate brother Ben and the church here for the vision and the burden to amen host these meetings and amen pray it's a blessing to you amen the book of St Mark the 16th chapter and I want to begin reading in the 14th verse and I want to maybe make a statement here the prophet of God uh said so it maybe put a little bit of a understanding in your heart he said now the last words speaking of Mark 16:14 to20 he said these are the last words that ever fell from the lips of our beloved savior he said it was the final words to his church Universal all right in mark 16:14 afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they set at meat and up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel thank to Every Creature for he that believeth and is and now watch he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe all right in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God now watch and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen now in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and I want to read the 13th verse 2 Corinthians chapter 4 Amen in verse number 13 you know there we read about the Lord amen speaking to his disciples and here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and: 13 Paul writing he says now we having the same Spirit of faith I love that there's not many faiths but there's only one faith we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore I have I spoken now we also believe and therefore we speak so there is a direct connection between what you're believing and what you're speaking I have received what the Lord spoke spoke and therefore what I believe he spoke is what I speak also amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to for just a few moments to speak to you tonight if I title this I want to speak to you on the Vindicated method of God the Vindicated method of God I want to amen maybe begin tonight by just saying this thank God for Vindication amen thank God for Vindication when you look at that word Vindication it means to show or to prove to be right now we don't just have Vindication amen but we have Divine Vindication we're not just here rejoicing because something has been Vindicated once or somebody thought it was Vindicated but no we have Divine Vindication brother said we do have today by God's help amen the perfect interpretation of the word amen with Divine Vindication we have today we're not looking for we're not waiting on it we're not trying to find it amen but we have today the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication said but as it's been in every age people let man amen put their own interpretation to it by Theology and will not believe God's Divine Vindication amen of it see that's God's interpretation so now amen God's interpretation is the perfect interpretation amen and it's also a divine Vindication he said not what I say or what somebody else says amen but what God has promised and the what God is doing amen proves that it's God doing his own interpreting of his word now amen to just lay a foundation tonight amen where I'm drawing the inspiration from this and the greatest battle ever fought brother BR said Satan's Army brings diseases amen but God's Army is commission to cast them out amen the devil brings them but God's Army is commissioned to cast them out out amen every time Satan throws any Onto You amen God's Army is to cast him out amen amen cast out see that's the very technique that God used amen Satan used the army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set him up a better Kingdom than Michael had amen and God cast him out he said so God's method is cast out the evil amen I love that not make room for it not make excuses for it amen but God's method is to cast out the evil Amen to cast down reasoning to cast down Superstition to cast down worry to cast down diseases to cast down sin amen you are above it see amen resurrected in Christ Jesus and you are sitting in Heavenly places with every devil under your foot amen now listen that is not in the future amen and neither is that in the past of the days amen when brother Brandon was up on the Earth amen but we are the army of the Living God Amen and if we are the army of God then we have received a commission of God Amen and our commission is not to put up with the devil amen but our commission is to cast out the devil I love what Paul says he says see neither give place to the devil when you look at that word place it means room or quarter or Coast amen opportunity or power amen occasion for acting so what Paul is saying amen don't you give any room to the devil don't you give the devil an opportunity Amen to manifest himself in the destruction amen that he's come to manifest himself in he says see in other words Paul is saying amen resist the devil I love what James said he said if you will submit yourself unto God Amen and resist the devil amen he will flee from you you know what that word resist means it means to set oneself against it means to withstand it means to resist or to oppose you know I believe it's high time as the Church of the Living God Amen to stop backing up to spirits and stop backing up to demons and stop backing up to doctrines of devils amen but God has sent a message in this generation and it's not a man's message it's a Vindicated message and it is a message that there set yourself Amen in the position as a son and a daughter of God Amen don't you give the devil any room we're taught in James 4:7 resist the devil amen just won't walk away but he'll flee amen how do you resist the devil the same way that our chief Captain told us to do it amen that's to take the word of God that's how you resist the devil is by the word of God another place when Satan gets a raging around amen we quote the scripture to him amen Jesus said amen resist the devil and he will flee from you somebody said well you just quote the scripture amen but can I ask you something amen they were doing that for 2,000 years amen and had questions on top of questions amen but in this generation amen God has sent the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication listen we're not just quoting scripture amen we're quoting interpreted scripture we're not just quoting a bunch of quotes amen but what we're saying has come from God through the lips of the seventh angel and tonight when Jesus is Among Us said the devil's trying to hinder the meeting amen just as hard as he could he will do that to every God sent meeting he said but you stand Toe to Toe with him and you say Amen if you're going to resist the devil you got to quote the word now come on and then you say Amen thus saith the Lord hey thus sayith the Lord he said resist the devil and he will flee from you now what does his word do it builds up our spiritual body been making us strong as we commune with him to resist the devil if you wonder how to resist the devil I just give you God's Vindicated method Amen on resisting the devil and it's by the quoting of the word of God Amen and the standing on thus sayith the Lord I'll say tonight God's Vindicated method amen comes by his word now when you look at this word method it is a particular form amen or procedure for accomplishing amen or approaching something it is especially a systematic or established one it is a way it is a technique or a process amen of or for doing something amen it is a body of skills amen that's why the devil hates you amen because you're more than just church members amen but was in God's mind has now come into God's church and you are the bride body of Jesus Christ you are carrying the techniques you are carrying the way you carrying the skills Amen to defeat the Devil anywhere any time any place under any condition amen I love that Word Method but I also love another word amen way which brother Ram teaches us amen that God has a provided way for everything I'm thankful to know tonight that God Amen has a method of doing things we're not just haphazardly shooting at something we're not just throwing something out there amen but God has come down in this gener ation and he has Vindicated that the preaching of the message of the hour amen is the authority of God on every scripture Amen to defeat the Devil now when you look at this this approach brother say it very beautiful he said God has an a provided approach he said see God's first method of approach Amen to himself for the people amen was through the shedding of blood now listen it has been from that day amen until this day amen the same thing so from the day that God established the shedding of blood for the saving of the soul of a human human it has not changeed and I go ahead and say it and never will it change amen there's not one thing you can do to save yourself when God provide something amen you've got to solom me trust amen the grace of God you have to accept his provided method amen and that is Jesus Christ see it's freely you don't have to do one thing but just accept amen what's already been given to you I'll say this God Amen has a Vindicated method amen of bringing his word now can I just preach a minute amen it's through the channel or the office of a Vindicated Prophet the Bible says in Amos 3:7 that surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets amen unto his servants the prophets in Hebrews chapter 1 God in sunnd times and diverse manners wrote the Bible amen by the prophets now notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way the way he chose amen he didn't have to write it that way and neither did he have to save Man by Blood he didn't have to preach the gospel by man he could let the Sun or the moon or the Stars preach the gospel he could have let the winds come the gospel amen but he chose man think about that he could have chose the wind to HT Malachi 4 he could have chose the trees to quote Revelation 10 but he chose man who had faults and failures amen but God was not looking at the man on the basis of Education he was looking at man on the basis of the blood because all the way back in the beginning he established a way to approach him and that was not for your education that was not through your church standing that was not for your C oh come on that was not for your culture it was through the blood of Jesus Christ he chose his way the way his word would come and that was by his prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word now what were they doing they were declaring the revelation of his word amen to that age and that time now the Bible said the word of God Amen it came to the prophets only never does it come to a theologian show me a scripture it comes only to prophets so God wrote the Bible amen by his chosen method and by his own chosen prophets amen not the prophets man had chose amen but the prophets that God had chose another place see the prophet always amen points back to the great Supernatural God Amen a real prophet of God that's a real preacher amen In a Pulpit now I know we got a lot of ideas today but let's forget the ideas and let's just come back to what a prophet said if you believe what a prophet said you will find yourself in the pews whenever the church doors are open and if you're a God called Creature if you believe what the prophet said when the Lord inspires the word to your heart you will find yourself in the pullit amen standing Toe to Toe with the devil and preaching the perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication I'll just go and say and I think it's time amen we get the oldfashioned gospel of going back to church back among our young people it's not where people come and they go and say please if they don't like this they go that hey but come back to the message of the hour and the message of the hour says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as you see the day approaching and if a real true prophet of God stands in the pull pit he will say exactly what William brandham said on those tapes and the same P of fire that stood with him will come among the church again and will vindicate what he's saying because it's already already Vindicated so a real true Prophet will point back back to the word which is the promise of the Lord amen not the Declaration that the church has made amen but a declaration that God has made see then you are not here amen as just church members amen but you are here as believers who God has claimed Amen to believe him by the Declarations that the Vindicated Prophet made let me just say this the Vindicated method of God is never changing am it is always the same if you put it in Africa it's the same if you put it in India it's the same if you put it up in Canada it's the same if you put it in Europe it's the same if you bring it to Arkansas it's the same if you take it to Oklahoma it's the same come on church amen this ain't a man's message this is the King's message and you know what I think it's high time to do I think it's time to remember it ain't about a preacher and it ain't about a church it ain't about a kingdom it's about the Lord Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever and as the Bride of Jesus Christ we welcome the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost AM me to move in the church once again it ain't about a man it's about the son of man it's about the King of Kings it's about the prophets of prophets it's about the word and it never changes God said I'm the Lord and I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob amen you are not consumed amen now watch this it taken 4,000 years to make a masterpiece he's been nearly 2,000 years and then making another Masterpiece which is a bride for Christ in so doing it he does it by his never changing method amen the same way he made the Masterpiece his word somebody shout he cannot change can I say this man changes and time changes and ages changes and dispensation changes but somebody shouted from from the rooftops but God Remains the Same that's a glorious shout Point Church it don't matter how you feel it don't matter what you're going through it don't matter what mood the church is in if you just get the word among the Believers the word is the same my goodness then God works by his word amen and his word is his Vindicated method somebody say God God never changes the church has changed but God never changes amen friendships change but God never changes I might as well say it preachers change amen but God never changes churches will change on you amen but God will never change somebody say well what are you trying to tie the church to I'm trying to tie you to the message of the hour it's been in the jungles of Africa it's been in the Huts of India it's been in the skin come on it's been in the witch doctors and there's nothing ever defeated this message it's God's Divine way to bring Faith into the church what is it it's not some man-made Theory it's something not some group of men amen comes together and makes up it's his unchangeable word somebody say well amen you need to ask brother so and so about this and ask brother so and so about that and ask brother so no I got tapes I got my own tapes in my own books and brother so and so might change tomorrow amen but the message will never change what a prophet tgh about the godhead it's the truth what he Tau about water baptism it's the truth what he Tau about Holiness it's the truth what he T about church order it's the truth what he T about the gifts it's the truth it don't matter where you put this message it will be the truth yes sir because the word of God Amen runs in continuity and never has he changed his method he said we've tried to educate them into it we've tried to denominate into it we've tried to beg them into it we've tried to beat them into it we've tried to shout them into it and it still Remains the Same the shed blood amen only is where God Amen meets a Believer if somebody begs you into it somebody will beg you out if somebody shouts you into it somebody will shout you out if somebody sings you into it somebody will sing you out amen but if you ever come underneath the Wonder working blood of Jesus Christ it'll never move it'll never change that's why I can shout tonight it's CU all my sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ and there's Wonder workking power in that blood yes sir yes sir he is the word and the bride has become the word I love it because Malachi 4 amen comes to deal with a heart which the prophet of God said each individual Amen in his heart he must be that one with God so the message of Malachi 4 amen comes to deal with a heart amen which is to turn the heart to God in John 6:45 Jesus said it very beautiful he said it is written in the prophets and they shall be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father amen cometh unto me so here the here the Lord Jesus is saying if you're going to come unto the father you're going to come by me but you're going to come by what you've heard and what you've learned somebody say we don't need no teaching amen well that's a that's an old Pentecostal idea Amen to give a bunch of Liberty to gifts to leave the church but I say the headship of this bride amen is the message of the hour and we need the teaching of what a seventh angel Tau Amen to come into our hearts and to marry us to Christ the word yes sir being one with the word proves amen whether you are of God and spirit fill there is no other criteria come on you know what that word criteria means it is a standard for judging something which is established by Authority so Authority will establish a standard and when that standard is established amen God forbid anybody ever change it that's why Prophet come among the church and said God's criteria for his church amen is his word amen it's not the Greek Orthodox it's not the Roman Catholic it's not the Pentecostal come on we might as well preach we're all the way out here amen not the seven Thunders or the return Ministry or or no no no there's only one standard that God has established as the Judgment of the church and that is his word now the Bible he says is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ amen this is the Revelation I want to say tonight that Satan amen hates Revelation he hates it amen he hates the revelation of Jesus Christ amen in the church and he hates that the church knows that Jesus Christ is Hebrews 138 come on he hates that Revelation because he knows amen that the whole lot more than 90% of the theologians do he knows that since God Amen is immutable in his nature then he is immutable in his ways you know the problem God uses this term in the church age book he calls it persuad scientist amen and liberal theologians now you all know amen we're living in a day and time where the world is divided amen between liberal and conservatives am and they take the Bible liberal theologians amen they take the Bible and they make it a liberal book that's why you got women in the pullit that's why you got men wearing shorts that's why oh come on now that's why you got Bob haired women in pets he got deacons married five times and he got women telling the husbands how to run the house come on y'all know I'm telling the truth amen because because liberal theologians got a hold of God's word and they watered it down to some liberal approach am but let's go ahead and go the other side amen you got conservative theologians that took the same book and made a bunch of legalism out of it and beat the life of God out of the church and now the young people's dried up and half the church is dried up but I say come back to the message of the Hour come back to the preaching of the word of God underneath the filter of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 I say clean up the church hey it's good to see you brother Josh I say clean up the church I say bring the liberty of God Amen to come back in the church until the power of God can fall among the church again and can bring a real true Revelation I'm not looking for emotion I'm not looking for excitement I'm looking for Revelation because Revelation is the only thing that'll whip the devil come on somebody it's the only thing that will whip the devil you say what are you talking about I'm talking about God who is not liberal and neither is he conserv well come on somebody amen if you come to sit on the meeting I pray God Amen get a hold of you and Shake You P out of your seat this ain't a liberal meeting and neither is it a conservative meeting this ain't a Democrat convention it ain't a republican convention it's a gathering of eagles and wherever the carcass is and then there will the Eagles be gathered together come on church I say bring back the message in the power of the Holy Ghost and let it Liberate the church again to serve God and love God yes sir th Satan knows ass surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God the devil knows this amen Mark 16 and action is the true church it's the true church that claims that Jesus claims as his own all else is false now that's not my words that's perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication yes sir all else is false it has to be so then what do we know Mark 16 as we know it as the Great Commission look at this word commission it is an instruction it is a command it is a duty given Amen to a person or to a group of people it's a group of people who are officially charged oh my with a particular function they are given an order for or authorize amen the production of something amen such as a building amen or a work of art now you all know that brother brandom said that I've not come Amen to build denominations I've not come to build organizations he said I have come Amen to build powerhouses unto the Lord Jesus Christ then this message amen is the building of a Powerhouse under the authority of the word of God Mark 16 said it very beautiful he says now go ye into all the world Amen and preach the gospel to Every Creature you say what is this word gospel well the the Bible speaks amen of the Gospel the gospel of Christ The Gospel of God Amen the gospel of the kingdom in the Greek definition gospel amen is Good Tidings it means to bring good things among the church you know I think it's time to get back to bringing some good things among the church we got enough bad things and negative things and sad things amen let's just start bringing some good things and here's what the Bible said it's after the death of Christ amen the term compromises also amen the preach in of or concerning Jesus Christ amen is having suffered the death on the cross to procure Eternal salvation for the men in the kingdom of God but as restored to life and exalted to the right hand of God in heaven amen fence to return in M Majesty Amen to consummate the kingdom of God so that it may be briefly defined amen as the Glad Tidings of Salvation through Christ it is the proclamation of the grace of God made manifest and pledged in Christ and he sums all of that up into one word brother Cliffy sums all that up into one word and he calls it the gospel my goodness brother Danny amen the proclamation that Jesus was born and that he lived and that he died and that he was buried and that he rose again and that he Whi the devil amen all the way from the pits of Hell to the throne of God all that Majesty All That Glory is summed up into one word and it's called The Gospel woo brother brother said then what is the highest form Amen to get the message to the people he said the preaching of the Gospel is the highest form the highest form to bring the message to the people is the preaching of the Gospel then if you notice the Bible places it amen first apostles secondary prophets and so forth then on down into the non spiritual gifts amen operating in every local body so the highest form of bringing the message is the preaching of the Gospel but you know what else he ties with that he says the highest office in the world Amen they've got to be right because we're standing here amen holding the highest office that's held in the world Amen and that is a minister amen a minister and the most truthful and right accurate we must be that way we must depend Amen on God to do it let me say this the day a man takes a pullit amen dependent on educ and depending on the feeling of the church and depending on what somebody thinks about it amen to help us soul is a day we might as well turn off the lights and padlock the doors if we're going to have church we need God on the pul pits we need God on the musicians we need God on the pebes we need God in the back room listen we need God from the front door to the back come on somebody am then church ain't about a man it's about God I'll tell you then if that wonderful consummation of everything that Jesus done for us amen is summed up into one word amen the gospel amen I just love this y'all y'all just forgive me for a second amen it's it's real simple okay brother Josh it says these two words go preach if you look in the Bible amen next to Mark 16 it sums all that up into word word one word the gospel and then brother W says go preach you know what Jesus said he said as you go amen preach amen saying I find this amazing he said say and not play he said saying amen the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand look at Matthew 20:27 when I tell you in darkness that you speak in light and what you hear in the ear that you preach upon the housetops in Luke 9 Jesus said I give you power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases watch and he sent them amen to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick listen he said let the dead bury the dead amen but you go th and preach amen you go th and declare amen the kingdom of God God said it like this through the Apostle in Acts 5 go amen stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life listen friends the preaching of the Gospel is the success of the church he said lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit now I know some people they like to dig into things and go places with things brother BR never went and they like to take quotes like well we don't need a we don't need a new church what we need is to go back to the mission corners or and listen brother Brandon was only saying something there what he was saying was a he he conducted his oh I'm getting in trouble he conducted his own building project in Jeffersonville and added on to the sanctuary what he was saying amen is we move the success of the church away from the preaching the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost and we put it on buildings and programs and who can do this and who can do that but a Prophet come and said if you want a successful church amen then come back to the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of God and the salvation and the demonstration of the spirit you know why because the commission am met the Great Commission it did not come before the resurrection but it came after the resurrection which means it was established in the power of the Resurrection if somebody tells you to do something and they've never had a twoo fake are you going to believe them to do it but if somebody who was born and lived 33 and A2 years and hung up on a cross and died the most crucifying death could be died and he went into the grave for three days but he arose on the third day and he appears unto you and says go preach this gospel go tell the Glad Tidings are you going to believe somebody like that I say yes I'll believe somebody that can be died and be buried and can raise again because all power is behind this commission I say tonight Satan I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who has called us to preach this gospel my goodness it wasn't somebody that just had a toothache on the way to church it was somebody that knew what they were talking about brother said the Great Commission was after he rose from the dead every creature was to hear the gospel that's the Comm condition this morning of the church that every creature shall hear the gospel I say oh God help us that every preacher and every son and daughter of God does not hear who don't like us and does not hear who's against us but they hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the power of the Resurrection come on bring some good things among the church bring some Glad Tidings among the church that's when every creature has heard the gospel then Jesus will return again you know what I love about that is they don't all have to hear me but they do have to hear the gospel they don't all have to hear any of these preachers but they do have to hear the gospel because the gospel is not a man it's the power of God and salvation it's the power of the Resurrection that's why a man that is Commission of God he looks upward and he looks onward you don't have to care what the world says about it he's not listening to the world he's got a Divine commission from God and he is enjoying the presence of almighty God somebody say preacher why amen are you up there so excited and rejoicing because I didn't come here under the commission of some preacher I come here under a Divine Commission of Mark the 16th chapter and he said if I'll go and say what he said he will heal the sick he will save the Lost he will refal the empty he will cast out Devils come on church we are a powerful force of people not because of a church we go to or a man we listen to because of the Gospel yes sir has the Great Commission I know what the devil says the devil loves to say things like well the Great Commission hadn't reached this day but really brother wend that's a lie because the prophet asked the question he said has the Great Commission reached down to this day I love his words brother Maddie says certainly certainly certainly if anybody tells you God ain't still saving I'll tell you how to answer him you're a liar if anybody tells you God ain't still performing Miracles I'll tell you how to answer them you are a liar because the Bible said that Mark 16 would be an action until the day that Jesus returns to claim his bride yes sir certainly then how long to all the world to how many to Every Creature to believe is to accept eternal life why should I believe it you say because it's the word of God and once God speaks a word he's got to stay with it I love that amen listen that's been 2,000 years ago that the words of Mark 16 fell from the lips of the resurrected Lord but he's still with those words tonight Hallelujah come on Church Theodore Roosevelt said things and Lincoln said things come on now are you with me amen come on Martin Luther King said things amen there's all kinds of important men say things amen and people are still quoting their words tonight but there's no effect behind them because the presence of the one who spoke those words is not here tonight but those words of Mark 16 it did not come from a preacher it came from Jesus Christ and it has been revealed in the form of the message of the hour then wherever the message is preached the presence of Jesus Christ is in the room to vindicate the words that's being said yes sir if God spoke it he stays with it and he will confirm it the resurrection is just as vital today just as real to every human heart amen that will believe it I'm going somewhere amen so then we find the Great Commission amen is the preaching of the Gospel to meet the great need you say what is the great need the prophet of God said the great need oh my is a living Christ yes to bring a living faith we read the sacred writings of this book and we feel our great need of a living Christ in the days of Skeptics so listen if you were believing Christ in the reason realm then how can you ever take his word when you got to cast that aside and let that word that you have caught with your mind amen come down into your heart Amen to a living faith listen friends the preaching of a living Christ is the bringing of a living reality amen which brings a living faith in the heart of the Believers now listen amen there's not a person in here tonight amen if somebody caught you after church and they pulled you aside and they got you over there brother Bo and they said now I want to tell you something I want to tell you a little secret okay amen now don't you tell nobody don't you don't amen just keep it to yourself now come on man I know that gossip and devil against among Believers too that's right brother am amen they get over there and they say I want to tell you just a little secret don't you tell nobody what I'm about to tell you and they tell you something and brother John you know as well as I know amen the first thing you do is you think I can't tell nobody but you want to tell somebody y'all know what I'm talking about amen amen and so you walk around and then you get this look on your face you know and people say what's wrong with you you're doing okay well I'm okay I just can't say well if you didn't want to say on now you wouldn't have the look on your face it's like preachers get up and say well you know I oh God come on you they say well you know I ain't a preacher amen but in reality why you got a microphone because God called you to preach the word it don't matter how you can preach it how you can tie it what you can do if God called you amen then stand there and preach it if God revealed the secret of the mind of almighty God into your flesh come on Church somebody get say I ain't much of a singer amen then why have you got a microphone because God give you a gift to sing so sing to the devil falls out sing of the glory comes up sing the demons back up come on church it's the preaching of the gospel and the power of the Resurrection somebody say well you know I'm just a little nobody in the church you're not just a little nobody amen I don't care if you're a deacon I don't care if you're a Sunday school teacher I don't care who you are amen God has revealed some secrets to you and here is the secret that he is alive from the dead and all power is given unto Men by the preaching of the Gospel come on housewives amen tell that devil get off my babies come on Daddy tell that devil get off of my home come on Sunday school teacher amen teach them kids about the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ come on Believers believe the message until every critical devil Dan and the power of the Holy Ghost moves among the church again we ain't a bunch of lonely nobodies we are the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ if God didn't want you to know this message you wouldn't be holding it come on church if God didn't want you to know what he done in Sabina Canyon you wouldn't know about it if God cuz he only appears to the elect brother say if God didn't want you to know about what happened on the Ohio River then you be clueless when somebody mentions 1933 but because there is a seed on the inside of your soul that means God wanted you to know the secrets of the word of God in the age you're living in somebody whip that devil back to hell and say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am the redeemed of the Lord I'm not a wasted piece of humanity I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I have come from God and I must go back to God [Applause] I get so sick of that devil running people around and oh you know it's a truth brother B said like this he said so Jesus looks at him this great secret and says go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead now look at this word tail it means now watch to speak it means to command it means to say there has been many great commissions given to men and the peoples of this Earth but never was there such an important commission given as this one go tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead come on church do you know who you are you are Disciples of the Gospel you are Disciples of the one who was buried who went to hell and arose on the third day then this Great Commission has been thoroughly Vindicated can I say what a prophet said I say unto you this afternoon my dear beloved believer and fellow citizen of the kingdom of God the Great Commission is just as much enforced today as it was the days when it fell from the lips of our Lord Jesus Christ if he doesn't do the same thing in this meeting that he did in days gone by then I'm a false prophet but if he does and you fail to receive him then you are a sinner that's right let's just say what he said he said the word sinner means unbeliever so go ye and disbelieve no more there's only one Crossing line between a sinner and a saint and that's Faith so the Great Commission amen that's made our places now listen so the Great Commission what has made our places in the condition it's in today you ever ask yourself that question amen amen now don't get mad at me but let me preach amen why have we got kids who have been raised around the message don't even know the sound of the voice of the seventh angel on a tape they know every preacher on YouTube they know every God come on [Music] they're you say well you're just a taper well you call me what you want to I am a holy ghost filled Son of God following the pillar of power listen you ain't got to hear me and you ain't got to hear no other preacher but there's one voice you got to hear and that's the voice of Malachi for and if there is a preacher in the p he will be saying what a prophet has already said I say what's got the churches in the condition here it is because we've not carried out the Great Commission of the resurrected Jesus of his power and his love to his church well we might as well preach for here why are we trying to change the Vindicated method of God now can I just preach it real simple it works why are we trying to change it it works it worked in the beginning it worked in the middle it worked in six Church ages and now we come down to the seventh Church age and brother W all of a sudden the preacher of the Gospel amen is irrelevant amen the preach of this message come on I know where I'm standing I know where I'm standing because what happens is Devils invade flesh and flesh invades pull pits and says well the Ephesians 4 Ministry don't work and you know we can't keep a crink clean preacher listen if God can change your body if he can save your soul if he can redeem you from the hand of Destruction if he can fill you with the Holy Ghost then don't tell me that he cannot give you a Ministry that'll stay with what a prophet has already said my God's able these Stones well get out of here devil I'm going to preach and have a good time doing it God is able these stones to rise children unto Abraham he's able to raise up somebody that'll just stand in a pull pit and say what a prophet has already said it works you say what are you getting at I'll tell you what a prophet of God said he said that's the way it was at the beginning may we ever remain true oh yeah how many's a witness the preach of the Gospel Works yes sir how many's a witness that laying on the hands of the sick is it works how many's a witness that c out of Devil's works then why do we want to change it you know what I say I say let's lay aside our pride let's lay aside our standing in society and let's open up the song book and let's open up the good book again and let's forget about psychology let's forget about education and let's just be good oldfashioned Holy Ghost filled message to the our following sons and daughters of god it works I said it works it worked for Moses it worked for David it worked for shamgar it'll work for every believer here tonight I don't care what Devil's against you I don't care what spirit's battling you it works I said it works if somebody will stand and declare it it works don't change it it works you say what works the gospel right then what is the gospel it is the power of demonstration of the spirit there and your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God look at this demonstration of the Holy Spirit R would come and would demonstrate the gospel and would bring the word to a living reality come on another place Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in what power and in the Holy Ghost said see the gospel is the power of God to make the word Act what it says it'll do can I say what he said he said then preach the gospel to all the world where to Amen to Every Creature just the brown just the Yow just the black no sir to Every Creature Every Creature you believe that means that do you believe that that means that he said I seen God baffle a bull one day he said I seen him cause a hornet amen not to sting he said I seen him raise up a pum that had been laying dead all night amen that's in the animal life then he turns and says every creature the gospel will take effect upon anything that you ask Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man but I just felt a streak of Glory flow through my body I didn't come here to be seen or be heard I come here to ask the gospel to have an effect upon you an effect upon your health an effect upon your church an effect upon your family an effect upon your young people I say oh God let the gospel let it have an effect on the church you say preacher will it if you'll ask if you'll ask it will amen now watch you brought it from a bull brother Jeff to Hornet Amen to aost he said then Jesus said to that tree he said cursed be you that no man eat from you fence forth and the gospel was preached to a tree brother wle it went from a bull to hornet to a posum to a tree but have you ever read the rest of Mark 11 oh come on when he got done preaching to the trees he turned and he walked in the temple he turned from nature and walked in the temple and said this is my father's house and you have made it a d of Thieves you know what he said he said they looked at him and they said how do you speak to us you speak as one having Authority oh Church a living God he said what is this gospel we're talking about it's the word Vindicated is the gospel listen if it could stop a bull help me somebody if it could stop a hornet if it could stop a possum if it could curse a tree that I come here tonight to say whatever the devil's throwing against you it can stop that D brother it can stop cancer it can stop depression it can stop nervousness it can stop anxiety it can stop complexes it can stop depression it can stop high blood PR come on Church it can stop confusion it can stop false Doctrine it can stop division it's never lost its power it's always the same gospel then the problem of God say like this he said now watch the church in its present condition it cannot finish up the Great Commission so that's why we're not a modern church he said see it's Pres condition and its present state is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave the church for this day you say finish up the Great Commission how could they do that well now listen they're dead Pentecostal died he said God let it die amen so he could what open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride and the Seven Seals of God when it was open there on the mountain he said now what does it do it brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world it might be revealed in the last days to the sons of God so under the Son of God dispensation the church only came so far but then they started brother zachari looking back and saying well if I have been in finny's day if I'd have been in knox's day if I'd have been in Calvin's day if I'd have been in Paul's day then I could really done something for God but then a prophet comes on the scene and says to finish the Great Commission is going to take headship and it's going to take the advancement of the gospel and he turns to Revelation 10:1 and says another Mighty angel came down from heaven and was clothed with a cloud watch this and Christ amen took the position of the leader of the church so if you're trying to be the leader you showed up too late God already claimed that office he said the shuck has got to get forth the seed because this is the advancement of the Gospel now you all know amen amen is everybody okay amen sometimes in the preach of the Gospel brother sister we have to say some harsh things and some rough things and some cutting things he said but Lord you said that the gospel is sharper than a two-edged sword he said God forbid that we should have anything less than that he says we are not sufficient Lord the only thing we can do is bring the gospel and the gospel is the word amen plus the power amen now now can I just preach for a second the gospel he says is not to be fussed it's to be lived and believed yes sir well somebody shout out oh me my amen hallelujah or something the gospel is not to be fussed it's to be lived and believed and so I said why fool with one critic oh I feel good right

sir can I give the devil another black eye the same Holy Ghost that led a blind woman down among those crowds to the promise has led you here tonight where the gospel is being preached and the promise is poured out upon the people and healing and salvation is Flowing amen freely tonight under these canopies of the heavens tonight for whosoever will let him come oh glory to God let him come let the

taken the sick man's place that Christ taken the worried man's place that Christ taken the maniac's place that Christ took every place he took every place and freed us from every Affliction and every sin the devil put us in the prison house by Christ come to Pardon us freely everything goes free well I might as well finish it then he sent this spit and sweating hollering crazy country boy from the dirt of Tennessee to tell you these words he took your place at Calvary now neither give place to the devil that's the gospel the gospel is you're already saved the gospel is you're already healed the gospel is you're already redeemed the gospel is you're already well the gospel is you're already Justified you're already glorified you're already perfected and don't you let no devil yeah glory to God don't you let no devil take the place of what Christ died to take in your life that's the [Applause] gospel so Christ died to save you and you let condemnation take salvation's place and Christ died to heal you and you let the doctors report take Isaiah 53's place and Christ died to give you peace and you let worry take Peace's place and Christ died to give you a sound mind and you let un Insanity amen take a sound mind's place the devil ain't safe here tonight you know what I say I say kick him out I say kick him out I say kick worry out I say kick nervousness out I say kick

don't belong there no sir that devil don't belong there put that devil in his place now you say preacher you're awful heavy on the preach of the Gospel well you say why because the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out that's right so brother Josh the devil takes sickness and puts it in healings place the devil takes nervousness and puts it in Peace's place and the devil takes sadness and puts it in Joy's place and the devil takes confusion and puts it in worry's all right but then God sends an anointed preacher behind the pullit are you ready for what a prophet said he said God has given me the authority to break the power of [Applause] Satan a preacher in the Pulpit preaching the gospel has the power to break Satan you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life notice he didn't say in this life he said over I know what I'm talking about amen Devils sometimes they don't they don't get in they get over and a devil that gets over can do as much damage as a devil that gets in so what the devil does is he hangs over you that's what the prophet of God said he said a spirit hung over me as a child and said wait a little longer he said there's not a man in his right mind but won't wants to do right he said but there's something won't let you do right is that right that's the devil come on somebody just say it that's the devil quit making excuses and just say it's the devil it's the devil that won't let you believe it's the devil that won't let you Fellowship it's the devil that tells you you're going to miss the Rapture it's the devil that tells you your family is going to be lost it's the devil that put sickness upon you oh but we're not here as the devil's Army we are here as the army of the Living God and we have been commissioned we've been commissioned brother Harold to cast out the evil yes sir his church has been commissioned to cast them Devils out you ain't going to heal nobody you ain't going to save nobody listen what a prophet says he said the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it that's what God gave me that's what God give every gospel preacher can I get every gospel preacher in this building to stand up that's what God has given every gospel preacher every gospel preacher has been given the power and the authority to break the spirit I say sons of God preach the gospel until every devil is defeated now come on preacher stay standing do you see these men of God Amen they're not hirings they're men of God you know what I say have I got any believers that believe what these men of God are preaching then you ought to stand behind them and say preach the word of God preach the power of God preach the anointing of God preach until the devil SK preach until the devil's plee resist the devil resist the devil come on somebody resist him on the foit and somebody resist him in the pews [Music] say what a prophet said he said I believe with all my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already ready broken let somebody shout aloud in the house of God every devil power brother Josh it's already broken listen the devil of suicide is broken the devil of fear is broken the devil of division is broken the devil of Discord is broken the devil of Doubt is broken I say the gospel has broken the devil's power and we're free that devil hangs over you and that devil lies to you and that devil tells you I'm going to get you and I'm going to get you and I'm going to get you and I'm going to get you and I'm going to get you and I'm going to get you well I'm going to tell you what the word says devil you already been got Hall you you ain't going to get because you you've already been got can I say this the message Works how many believes the message Works can I say this God takes simple Vindicated methods God takes simple Vindicated message and whips the devil now you know that Spirit hangs over churches right yeah and then it hangs over families and then it hangs over meetings and then it hangs over young people and then it hangs over Futures and what that Devil's trying to do is he's trying to oppress you because he don't want you to go out yonder and fully believe the power to finish the Great Commission do you know what the devil does the devil says no wait a little longer wait a little wait till tomorrow morning wait till tomorrow night wait till Sunday morning morning and you know what the devil's told some of Y all that and you've been waiting for 10 years and 15 years and 20 years but you know what I say tonight I say tonight's a good night for the devil to die I say tonight is a good night for the devil to die I say tonight is a good night for fear to die it's a good night for doubt to die it's a good night for condemnation and depression it's time for that devil to die he's hung over you long enough he's followed you long enough he's followed you from one Church to another church from one meeting to another meeting from one convention to another convention from one Youth Camp to another Youth Camp but I stand here tonight under a Divine Commission of Mark 16 and I say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ May the liberty of the word of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he couldn't stop my Lord then he won't stop him now [Music] Hallelujah I'm talking about some gospel Believers I'm talking about some people who are under the Great Commission Hallelujah now I say this that devil can go so far but when he meets the pillar of fire he has to die brother Xavier when he meets the pillar of fire that devil has to die y'all ever heard of a man named brother Ed Hunter brother Ed Hunter was in a meeting he was sitting there and brother brandom says it like this on the tape he said it finally happened he said like this he said see it's been hanging over you you know what brother Hunter was doing he was sitting there amen with a condition in his body and the devil was telling him you've had it for so long you'll always have it brother Hunter he actually told me this I called him one time and asked him he said buter the devil told me because Generations before me had it that I would have it too he said so I sat there and accepted because they had it and this one had it that I would have it he said but all of a sudden he said there was a warm feeling just come over me and he said the only thing I could do was worship now you know what some people stopped doing theyve stopped worshiping because of labels that's been put on them they stopped praising because of labels that's been put on them y'all know what I'm talking about or they're just a fanatic or they're just emotional or they're just worked up amen well can I just give you a little secret amen instead of labeling somebody ask them instead of labeling somebody just go ask them why do you act the way you well let here I might as well preach amen why do you act the way you act amen I was preaching this over the other night at brother Jason's and I got in this area and I got Tau by a little sister over in England her name is Sister Taffy amen she got up brother Vernon every service and she would scream out Hallelujah and then brother Danny she'd walk up there and shake my hand while I preaching well I'll be honest with you it was real easy to get in the seat of the scornful and start criticizing her for making that kind of noise in church and acting that kind of way and I'll just have to be honest I was in the pastor's office and he said brother Andrew he said that bothers a lot of people and I just looked at him and I said brother Crosby I said why does she do that he said brother Andrew I'll tell you why he said because for years she come to church she never acted like that he said but one day she was on her way to church and she was in a car accident he said and she laid in a hospital bed amen dying for weeks and months he said but the angel of God come by and delivered her and restored her and brought her back to the house of God and these were her words for years I sat here and didn't give him what was due his name she said but now I don't care who's looking at me I don't care who's sitting next to me there ain't no devil Hallelujah there ain't no devil going to silence my praise you can label me what you want to you can label me emotional you can label me fanatic but you have to label me a seed of God because I come from the Lamb's Book of Life I come from God and I'm going back to God you know what I do right now I take the Liberty as a gospel preacher to take labels off of lives you've been labeled a fanatic you've been labeled a crazy person you've been labeled a manfa I stand here tonight with a gospel sword and I take that ungodly label off of you and I say here's what you are you are mes Jesus Christ oh yeah there'll lady be a deep preacher fundamental preacher so that Spirit hangs over you brother Hunter said I just accepted it that's right he said but all of a sudden something come over me and he said I couldn't do nothing but worship brother he said I couldn't do nothing but worship on he said the prophet of God turned to me and he said these words he said it finally happened oh yeah it finally happened he but I was worshiping he said I knew people was looking at me he said I knew people was thinking I was crazy Brother David he said but I didn't care when a prophet of God looked at me and he said the pillar of fire has been hanging over your head for about 30 minutes it's been waiting on you to entertain its presence he said the minute you begin to praise the pillar of fire is the minute the condition of hemorrhoids left your body brother Hunter said that was in the 60s and I'm still healed today what are you saying I'm saying take the labels off we're not a bunch of Fanatics we're not a bunch of crazy people we are Sons and Daughters of God who have heard that Christ took our [Music] place and we're free we're free can I leave you this can I leave you this don't change the message all right just preach [Applause] it come on musicians just preach it oh my you say preacher it's simple you're right but it's simply right I rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus sir that Devil's labeled you long enough he's labeled you long enough he's labeled you everything he can he's labeled you depressed and you've introduced yourself as depressed he's labeled you defeated and you've introduced yourself as defeated but tonight by the preaching of the Gospel it's the casting out of the devil can I say this to [Music] you it works amen oh yes sister Phyllis it works it's the gospel oh thank it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's not the gospel of a man it's not the gospel of a church it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ and a prophet said a preacher stand on the pull pit and preach this gospel he said demons scatter you ever thought about something when you flip the light on brother said roaches scatter you ever thought about this do you realize you didn't do nothing but flip the switch people say well I flipped the light on and the and the roaches scattered well no the light did the [Applause] work oh my you were just the channel to flip the switch come on now it ain't the preacher that does the work it's the word the preacher preaches it's real simple brother Matt it's a real simple method but it works want you to stand your feet with us tonight those here in the building it works it's real simple brother being it's almost silly to some but it works people say well the message don't work it's too simple I'm going somewhere but it works am [Music] amen look at the package in it and said there's no way that'll work but it works amen down at brother match the other day and corner of his garage door was a big old red wasp red wasp nest up there now folks youall know them red wasp there's some big old Jokers up there big old nest up there Matt said give me that that let me go get that thing of soap and water soap and water I said wait before you get that soap and water I'm going to get next the door right because when that soap and water don't work that door is going to work and I might just like it cuz you don't get soap and water you get raid or some some Modern something you know yeah but Matt had a little old jug of soap and water and he went over and he said are you ready he threw that soap and water up there and God's my eye witness from a [Music] distance every one of those Wass fell yeah yeah and he said see that one right there he said it's trying to get away but watch this and he threw some on and he said it can't escape this Dawn and that thing flipped over and died it was in a simple bottle scientists would say you were crazy for using it but it was Vindicated because ever wasp died you know what I say I say it was in the flesh of a seventh grade Kentucky boy who stood in a p pit and declared thus sayeth the Lord he put a sword in the hand of this church and he said now watch church not one devil of cancer not one devil of sin not one demon of unbelief will escape this message I say this message if you lay it on every day devil that devil will die some devils right now they're laying on their back and they're kicking their legs it's time to throw the message on them devils and let them die underneath the Vindicated method of God let that Old Devil of nervousness die let that Old Devil of pornography die let that devil of lush die let that devil of adultery die let that devil of false Doctrine die let that devil of division die let it die tonight in the name of Jesus Christ let that old gossip and ungodly tearing people down tongue let that devil die tonight in the name of Jesus [Applause] Christ put the message on it it can't escape it that's right about our hearts tonight it's Vindicated the world don't approve of it the world makes fun of it but there's Witnesses in this building tonight that knows that devil dies underneath the power of this word that devil dies say preacher you said some harsh things but let that devil die tonight brother Andrew you said some rough things but let that devil die tonight let that ungodly Robin devil that's told you you ain't good enough to preach this gospel you ain't good enough to sing about the goodness of God let that devil die tonight let that devil that's told you you ain't good enough to be a part of this Rapture let that devil die tonight that Devil's taking places he don't belong in but the gospel the gospel says neither give place to the devil you say brother Andrew how can I stand here with an assurance of the gospel because the one who is the gospel nothing could escape from him not even death he rose on the third day and turned to his disciples and said now go preach go preach the Majesty go preach the Glorious Act of redemption go preach about the kingdom of God go tell the people that God loves him go tell the people that Christ died that took their place at Calvary go tell the sick man that sickness can't have its place go
