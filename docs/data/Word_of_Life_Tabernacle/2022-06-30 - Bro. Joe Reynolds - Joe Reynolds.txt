praise and honor for all things and what you're going to do and what you did for us already in jesus christ's wonderful name amen amen praise god you love the lord this evening it's good to be a christian isn't it amen man i'll take that off amen you've got your bibles this evening this invites you to jude chapter one verse three and i'd like to also read first timothy chapter 6 verse 12 and everybody happy this evening man it's good to be in the house of the lord jude says beloved when i gave all the villains to write unto you the common salvation it was an equal for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints also first timothy chapter 6 verse 12 it says fight the good fight of of faith and lay hold on eternal life take possession of overtake attain seize with hands lay hold on to eternal light where to thou are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses can you say amen man you can have your seats this evening and jude would tell us earnestly which intensely with an attitude contend which means simply to fight for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints and brother brown would say it like this he said the word has to be made alive it's a dead letter amen until it's made manifest though so he needs somebody to manifest his word and then it's quick in other words it's made alive and it's brought to pass and god said about it and what god said about it he said that's the gospel in action the new testament christianity that's where we like to speak to you tonight for a little while on the new testament christianity and realize it the gospel is the good news it's and here he tells us is is the gospel in action it's uh it's taking the promises of god and and taking the word of god and making it live and the hour that we're living in to to bring it and elevate it off the pages of this book and and be written of pistols read of all men and and we realized he said the crush in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts and the book of acts is is was the apostles it was it was people like you and i have been putting god's word to a test and bringing forth the manifestation of god's promises and amen this the book of uh the book of acts is god's church in action can you say amen so the new testament christianity is the gospel in action and brother man would say it like this and today the church ought to be jesus christ in action upon the earth hey man we we sing it all the time god's not dead but he's alive amen we feel him in our in our heart we have him in our heart we we clap with our hands we got him in our feet we feel him all around us and he's been it's more than just a song it's more than just lyrics it's more than just words on the page brother danny but it's manifesting time we sing the song the fruits are on the vine it's manifesting time and come and dine the master's calling come and dine and hey and the prophet would say things like this you know it's spiritual food and due season and we can begin to even just comb through the message of the hour bill of david and mine and to meet the challenge of this great hour and we just take the titles of the message of the hour and how that it just it it just illuminates me to to just to just look at the rising of the sun the the masterpiece and the seed not air with the shuck and and and the easter seal and my just the christ is the mystery of god revealed it my we could just preach a whole sermon this evening on the titles of the message of the hour thank god for the message huh amen but the true church is a church that it that is not just professors but possessors it's not just talking but action and amen so it's a new testament church in action and jude would tell us i exhort you that that you would intensely with an attitude fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life and and take possession of or overtake or seize the promises that god has allotted for us in this day and hour that we're living in the scripture said the violent take it by force in other words it's to seize or snatch away or or to claim that's yours and caleb's claim that every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse hey friends tonight i just don't want it to be a song i want it to be reality in my life and hey ben and i hope this evening that it's just not another a good sermon but i hope this will just sink deep in the hearts of believers hey ben that it's not an hour of just talking to talk but it's time for the believer to make a step of faith and and though scripture would tell us we walk by faith and not by sight new new testament christianity ain't professors it's possessors and brother man would say like this i can see shanghai standing there he looks out he says oh my his righteous in the nation began to come upon him he got a little fight in him he said that's what you got to do a little fight a little backbone that's the way to do it brother get some spunk about you and stand up and claim your god-given privileges god promised you healing is yours he said little old schamber got his righteous intonation up he looked around he couldn't find nothing he wasn't a warrior but what it was in his hand he couldn't find nothing but an ox kill he said that's all he had but brother he was sick and tired of the philistines coming taking what he had aren't you tired of it too tonight he said oh my aren't you tired of it mother aren't you tired of it sister you're sick and tired of the devil telling me that i can't walk i can't do this and i can't do that he said god bless your heart all things are possible to feel that belief he said that's it shamgar said i'm sick and tired of it and i'm not a warrior the odds are against me no matter how much odds are against you god's for you if you take his word he said there's one thing i know i am circumcised i am i am a i mean i'm an israelite he said that is uncircumcising i know that i'm right i'm a child of god tonight i know diseases come from the devil i know god promised me victory he said wow his righteous intonation rose and he grabbed that old ox goat and he jumped through the window he had he challenged 600 blessings and he stood there and beat their heads in he said god bless your heart claim your god-given privileges and beat their heads in he said that's right get out of the way satan kick him out of the way i'm the guy that's taken over now i come in jesus name watch him scatter brother when you use that faith when you use that faith on him he brother harvey will back up church is not an option brother joe it's not an option tonight you use this type of faith even the devil will have to back up and then i'm here to declare the good news the gospel all hell brother david is against us but all heaven is for us if god be for us who can be against us tonight and then the prophet would say what we need today man that just words like that just sticks out to us or you'd hear the prophet said don't miss this or he makes statements like this okay he said this is what we have need of and our ears should say don't miss this what we need today is some real genuine faith not only genuine faith but he said put it to action what we need is real faith men who dare to put god's word to their heart and to apply it to themselves hallelujah put into action if the woman with an issue of blood hey they could reach out and touch the hymn of his garment so can i hey man if they could get his attention hey ben if the if the blind man can get his attention if the woman with an issue of blood can get his attention i heard that probably god screaming it out ain't been in the message of putting faith to action hey bet he said if they could do it brother harvey's so can i if if someone was healed yesterday so could i if somebody was delivered yesterday so can i hallelujah amen but people are starving to death not just in the natural but spiritual they are starving to death but there's not a lack of word there's not a lack of anointing there's not a lack of promises but we find in the scripture that it tells us aaron samuel amen when jonathan heard abandoned not what his father charged the people he chose them not to eat or drink but the scripture said jonathan heard not whether his father charged the people within home where he put forth this end of his rod with his hand and he dipped it come on somebody hey but he dipped it into the honeycomb right he made god's provided place of worship he provided some honey and it was there everybody else was starving to death they was fatigued they was weary they was fainting they were discouraged they was defeated but when jonathan came back from the battle he was tired hey but god provided jonathan with spiritual food and due season when everybody else was starving god provided jonathan and i'm here to declare to you tonight even when everybody else is starving but god provided you he provided you strength he provided a lamb hallelujah amen and even the scripture said he dipped it he put it to action he bet he didn't wait on the pastor to do it he didn't wait on a revival to come he didn't wait on some great uh meeting brother allen to come or some youth camp to come amen when he needed it it was provided and he had to put it to action and jonathan the scripture said took his rod and dipped it down into the honeycomb it ain't the lack of word and ain't no lack of uh uh of anointing no sir anybody even the probably god said and that when he shot up the air of god's deliverances it wasn't a lack of promises he said you would only destroy your enemy but you quit striking it's the truth amen psalms tells us 119-45 so thou has commanded us to keep thy precept diligently all that my ways my journey my direction my march were directed to keep thy statues are actioned prescribed action prescribed or prescribed tasks in other words david said the house commanded us to keep thy precepts that word that my ways my journey my march my direction would be directed and i would keep that way and i would i i would stay on the firing line and the scripture our brother brad would tell us nothing can stand between a believer marching or going toward a promise so new testament christianity is acting on the prescribed task walking by faith every devil that tries to stand between you and your prescribed tasks will be conquered do you believe that amen that's paul we we use paul light but paul was his prescribed task was wrong there's a lot of things that transpired along the way hey but nothing could stop the man of god a believer going to meet the promises of god a man snake bit couldn't stop and prison walls couldn't stop him shipwreck couldn't stop him none of these things moved me hey but why because he was walking and prescribed tasks from almighty god and god told you to come amen you're going to make it hallelujah joshua 1 tells us moses my servant is dead now therefore arrives stand up don't be lazy go over move action this jordan every place the soul that your feet shall tread upon that i have given unto you as i said unto moses i would rather brother brown would said this i would rather be found a failure than too lazy to try one time it was said that that that this company hired a man he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of the pencil y'all know the story and he said why have you got an eraser he said i don't make mistakes he said i can't use you listen to this statement i can't use you because you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing babe was a home run king it wasn't a lack of trying he struck out many times the probably god's using this for the illustration i can't use you don't be a i'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try and he says true because you make mistakes you won't do nothing god don't hold your sponsor for your mistakes he holds your response over your willful sin he that sins whimply and they receive the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called and god in his heart he'll rise again a by the footprints a man means possession so what the church needs tonight pay attention that's what he said he said what the church needs tonight is some more footprints over here in the land nothing can stop us nothing's gonna stand in god's church she's moving come on somebody hey but she's not a lazy christian hey but nothing's going to stand in god's church she's moving footprints are action moving is an action she's moving towards cain and canaan is a promise amen and nothing can stand between a believer going to meet the promises of god amen so listen if there is a prescribed task for you tonight and you're walking you like walk through the valley of the shadow of death you might go through some trials and tempt temptations persecution famine sword nakedness you might go through mountaintops desert times valley experiences but this one thing is for sure hey ben that you're gonna rise rise rise above it all right excuse my voice and i am losing it quick tonight hey but listen friends hey ben god has prescribed a task for you and i tonight this world is not our home hallelujah this world is not my home that should make us want to shout tonight hey but praise god this ain't my prescribed task with brother and sister tonight our prescribed task apprentice not this world and he'll rise again if god is in his heart nothing's gonna stand she's moving there's nothing it's an irresistible force god will move everything he said moses got a little scared down there at the sea and began to cry to the lord and said lord said why are you crying to me he said what before you cry to me speak yes speak right and go forward haven't i commissioned you to a job ain't you got a prescribed task amen speak and he says speak what he said the word of god that's in you hallelujah hey ben not your own word your thoughts or your own words but speak god's word that's in you and go forward make a leap of faith don't cry to me go forward so speak and put it to action see god's word is always progression right and we could call it through the message brother and would teach us there's a horse and buggy there's an automobile there's an airplane there's a rocket a bed it's always progressing hey but it's always moving forward a bit brother man would deal with it even the four beasts which represents power of the book of revelation it speaks of a a face like a like an ox or a lion or a man or a flying eagle but brother baby said all those are as moving forward hey but there's no it's always advancing they couldn't go brother made that statement brother david he said those anointings could never go backwards hallelujah it always went forward about to meet the challenge of the age hallelujah even what anointing in this hour to meet the challenge of the of the age so satan doesn't care how much you talk but when a believer begins to advance it begins to move hell begins to tremble and they said like this let the bride say amen not just from the lips or the church down the road can do that but the amen is so be it it's in other words putting god's word into action let the bride say amen amen the church down the road can do that if it's only lip service but that you as a believer take god at his word and allow that living word that was spoken out of you isn't that what he said i better let that word hey that's within you speak and punctuate it with an amen amen we can say amen all day long but if you're not moving or if you're not putting and putting god's word to action hey not the new testament christianity it's not just an amen from the lips but it's a soviet it's a caleb mentality give me my mountain a better nothing was going to stop caleb from embracing his promised land hey bed so it's more than just lip service caleb stepped into his amen and brother baby makes statements like this action speaks louder than words i'd rather you live a sermon than preach me one i know you've heard these things there's one thing to say something it's another thing to do something it's not hearers it's doers amen so it's not just just saying amen and we love that in the church man that preacher loves the amends and y'all's doing a great job tonight that's punctuating the word you're saying amen you're punctuating with an amen but i really think punctuating with an amen is more than just saying amen in a church house but it's an everyday walk it's when you go to work it's when you're you know you go to school young kids hey and you're walking according to god's word holy holy before the lord god almighty you're making those footprints you're putting god's word to action amen amen and then you're punctuating it with the amen what you heard by the hearing of your ear ain't been a now that has become a manifestation out of your life and it's punctuating with an abandoned show bit extra extra read all about it praise god i'm healed and you make a step toward that well body you might still feel the pain you feel might still feel the struggle has nothing to do with it i'm punctuating with an a-bed how you feel i feel good amen brother make a statement never let your testimony be negative but let it be positive all the time amen first samuel tells us david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop and god speaks to him shall i overtake them god's response he said he answered him pursue don't sit here don't be a lazy christian don't wait on somebody don't wait on your neighbor tonight lord should i pursue should i take this inheritance should i accept my healing and god replies simply hey pursue punctuated with an amen for thou shall surely can you say surely with me tonight for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all don't stop you'll never get nowhere unless you make a step of faith in us amen you'll never bring the word alive until you're willing to bring it from a lip service to put into action hallelujah my pursue thus saith the lord brother says speak don't cry speak and go forward god don't want a bunch of cry babies right amen neither does the deacon bored or the pastor amen amen brother danny punctuated with an amen they don't want it neither does god god don't want a bunch of crybabies he wants men that's got backbone not wishbones wish i had it wish i could do this wish i could have my healing wish i could overcome this backbones that'll stand in the breach and claim the victory claim god called out in the midst of darkness no matter what anyone says we speak we speak and he says and go forward what do you do take his word act on it put it to action each day stand toe to toe with satan and say it is written yeah no better it's written here comes another wave it's written here comes another storm it is written it's written it's written pursue it is written pursue don't give up come on church don't give up so i've been waiting on this promise for years don't give up we sing a song it's already done hallelujah it's already done we sang that by faith even if we don't feel it even if we can't see it we sing that song in our life it's not just an amen from the lips they've been out of our lives we're punctuating with an amen it's already done hallelujah now i'm gonna get ahead of myself i gotta move away from that here comes another wave he said you're acting upon the word then you'll see the miracle of god hallelujah you're acting upon the word then you'll see the miracle of god that's right but first you have to act on it your thoughts will become words and words will become material he said that's when the church is in its power nothing can stop this type of church so be it so be it punctuating the word with an amen your thoughts become words and those words become material you're speaking and moving forward luke tells us as he internet i'm hurting do you love the lord tonight can i have just a little bit more monsters please and luke 17 12-15 says as he entered into a certain village there met in ten men that were leopards which stood afar off and they lifted up their voice and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourself unto the priest and it came to pass it came to pass as as can you read that for me as they went how easy it would have been waited on jesus and bring it to him or wait on the pastor to give it to him or wait on the revival but the scripture says as jesus spoke to them and told him go down to the priest and as they went they were clenched and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back with a loud voice and glorifying god as they win an action i say why set her and be defeated as we preach many times with the four lepers why sit here till you die let's go down to the enemy's camp take back what belongs to us hey but as they win if you start god will finish it i like that statement actions unlock the power resided in faith by our unbelief we activate fear by walking by faith we activate his promises and then brother brown would step into this he said you got his attention talking about blind bartimaeus he said what did he do here's faith going into action he throws aside his garment i won't need this anymore i'm going to be a new creature from now on and he threw aside his garment how could he see out in a dark black world where he couldn't see nothing he spread forth his ragged sleeves like that and his bony arms sticking through it and he made his way to find jesus no matter what condition he was in he had his attention he didn't know which way he was going to go he knowed he'd come from this direction so here he goes with his arms stretched out ragged sleeves hanging down tears running from his place where eyes should be he didn't know how he was going to find him but the word of god said come and he was going he said there's the main thing about the word of god said come and he was going jesus just simply said go down to the priests as they went and put god's word to action they was cleansed hallelujah hey but he didn't know how he's

insulator we don't need no insulations we got too much of it now it makes isolations but we need born again men and women who believe the word of god and plug it in amen come on somebody in other

going farther and further insane and getting more wickeder or more wicked if it's going that way the church is going the other way she's getting stronger she's moving closer to him oh church i believe we're getting so close we've reached the point of no return i believe we're gonna be like enoch as the world's getting so farther out of chaos hey but we're gonna be drawn so close to him till one morning maybe early in the morning between six and nine hey but we're gonna get out of bed just like any other morning hallelujah and we're gonna climb that last step hallelujah how many believes are to be a rapture the rapture is not going to be consistent with lazy christians but the rapture is going to be consist of those warriors battle scarred warriors that wasn't ashamed of the gospel that stood for god's word and his promises didn't wait on somebody else but didn't get their eyes on the circumstances but kept their eyes on their calling hallelujah and as they're getting wickeder the churches get more powerful more powerful when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord raises up a standard against it he says hallelujah he says let's go glory the winds are blowing set yourselves church move right on to the face of the storm knowing god's got this hallelujah what are you going to sit here and be discouraged today or you can set yourselves in the wind of yahweh this morning or this evening and let that wind of you always begin to pull you in the directions you need to go have been the sons of god are led by the spirit of the lord we don't understand his ways sometimes his ways are so much greater than ours his thoughts are so much greater than ours hallelujah but we learn to just shake it off and stomping under our feet and i've told that story here many times but it's true if that mule that fell in that sister would have gave up he would have been buried in his depression his funny feelings hey bad but every time that farmer would take a shovel of dirt and put it on him he would take that heavy load and begin to shake it off in other words he began to put into action and stop it under his feet he batted in him before long he would seem to be encouraged by what he's seeing hey this might work her farmer took another load of heavy soil and put it upon his back and the old dumb mule began to shake it up for the helmet and stomp that funny feelings under his feet stop that sickness right under your feet and before you know it he was a little higher hey i'm getting a little closer to the top right i'm you ain't very smart but he was smart ever know if i keep doing this if i keep taking everything the devil throws my way and stomping under my feet before long i'm going to step right out of this hole that i got myself into hallelujah hey man if we'll put god's word to action we can either sit here and be dried up and dead or we can begin to shake off those things that's so easily beset us and stomping under our feet and lift our hands to praise him say lord i'm that much closer to you and the next trial that comes just shake it off stomp it under your feet say oh lord i'm that much closer to you lord don't let me be a lazy christian don't wait on somebody else and knock it off your shoulder go ahead shake it off say brother joe i just don't feel like praising like i used to i don't feel like saying it like i use i don't feel like well maybe the load's getting heavy maybe it's a nice or not that you begin to shake off those things so so easily if it sets you don't let it build up don't let it become a beaver dam in your life begin to shake it off stop it under your feet and begin to praise god ain't been that you're just a little higher hey better just keep doing it i'm here to tell you nothing we're ever able to stop you you're coming up you're going to make it we need a church that's on fire we need a church that's in action if you want a revival in the church you be the david that begins to

faith cannot go into action you'll always be in that wheelchair you'll always be defeated you'll always be discouraged you'll always be down are you hearing you'll always be sick the odds are against me hey they're against me too the odds were against me but then i felt like giving up am i the only one in the building i felt like quitting i felt like not being around nobody i felt like all hell was against me has anybody else felt that way i felt like just giving up and quitting oh lord and i'd cry out to the lord why have you ever asked the lord that the odds was against me it just seemed like too much for me to bear but the gospel the good news is tonight through all that brother helen here i am tonight here you are tonight i am preaching the gospel tonight you're here satan didn't destroy you he tried but it didn't prevail somewhere or another you stood back up somewhere another you blundered and you made mistakes but it was only because he was trying and you got back up and you dust your pants off and you came to a church service just like tonight and the devil said you couldn't do it the devil said there's no way out the devil says you'll never get over it but here we are tonight we're clapping our hands we're saying the songs of zion i'm preaching the gospel we're still singing i'm here to tell you that nothing satan could do he got through my spirit he broke my body down he broke my spirit down brother david amen but there was a melody inside of my soul sealed that the devil couldn't cross the bloodline hallelujah satan could not penetrate the seal of almighty god and though i got weak in my flesh and though my spirit was torn but there came a point where something began to speak out of me get up joe you got this have you ever felt that way nobody's around you but that still small small voice begins to speak to your heart you're more than a conqueror i don't feel like it don't go about feelings you're more than a conqueror you've got a good church you've got good church family you got you gotta you got a good spouse son you've got good children you've got great grandchildren are you hearing me all of a sudden that which was injured begins to encourage you hallelujah is that what david did when david was greatly distressed for the people spake and stoning him because the soul of all people was grieved every men's sons for the daughter but david encourages himself in the lord is god david encourage himself with the lord of god god's word is our encourager when i'm weak he is strong thousands may fall to this side ten thousand of this side but it won't come nigh unto me when the enemy comes in like a flood or you hear me somebody amen took it all past the exercise of faith is god and he encouraged himself in the power in the providence of god and the promises of god is faithful as keeping them in the view of a covenant relation of god in remembrance of grace and mercy and goodness of god and his former experiences i've always i already overcome a bear i've already overcome how many has done that before be so discouraged and begin to think that think of the goodness of god boy brother harold he brought me through this battle yes that's right just when i was ready to give up i was so low my head was buried into the grounds of depression right in that moment there was a predestinated honey just for you god cares for you saints just in your weakest moment there's your honey and you and you had just enough strength inspired by the holy spirit that indwells you to take your rod and dip it into the promises of god and take that honey and wipe it across your lips and you and your eyes as jonathan's eyes were enlightened you begin to draw strength and then a spring in your step and a clap in your head and then you begin to praise your lord and praise your god my what is it it was an experience that you had with almighty god hallelujah david encouraged himself so so this is the day that the lord has made in closing this is the day that the lord has made i'm going to rejoice i'm going to rejoice we sing because we're happy huh the battle is already over the victory has been won hey man what kind of service are we having tonight hey man we're having a unbelievable service every service is unbelievable amen it's you and i coming to the house of god human beings leaving our problems leaving our situations all of our situations we've been in our work our job our frustrations our sicknesses and differences we can come together in a tabernacle like this and begin to lay down all of our burdens lay down everything and brother david comes out here and begins to sing some songs of zion and the spirit lord begins to move in the tabernacle and before you know it bro david and people start patting their foot and clapping their hands and man we're beginning to loosen up the soul and here comes a preacher up here begins to drop the seed of of life the gospel preached the gospel my we're having a church my ability because i tell you the battle is already over the victory has been won my it's not a song anymore it's elevating the words right off the pages he's been in the preacher telling you just step into it tonight hey but it's your promise and we can this is the day that the lord has made i'm going to rejoice because nothing can stop a believer we're going to make it you believe that we're going to make it why god said so yes sir hallelujah hallelujah anyhow it really doesn't matter what comes my way today i know who holds my tomorrow i know i'm sealed till the day of my redemption my that's really why we can smile tonight we can come to a church we had humans and still lift our hands and satan has tried sister jackie tried everything he can to keep you and hold you down he don't want you to praise god he don't want you to shout the victory he don't want you to receive nothing he tries to hold you down your seats and not just at a church service but everyday walk of life amen he don't want you to realize that it's already over because if you really realized it if you really caught a vision of it that's right amen remember brother adam he said i would have been a discouraged boy if it had not been for the fish i believe on the wings of the snow white dove he was telling the vision about the time when the squirrel missed his mouth this time remember the story of the harvey it missed his mouth and it landed on the cactus and piercing we heard the spirit of the lord said your enemy is dead hey brother brown said i might i'll get it for better but hey man you'll get what i'm saying he said you know he said i waited i've waited a long time but when he walked away from that brother harvey he still had the symptoms he still was hurting he still had to make another doctor's visit i'm going to tell this story tonight real close i'm having a good time tonight do you love the lord amen hey man hey it the story goes like this and i and i changed some things in if you heard it you might realize it but hey man but it was a it was a man and that lived overseas and he had a favorite football team and they made it to the super bowl and over there is many hours separating from what are here in the states so when they played the game here it wasn't televised over there two hours later so and as the story goes and they had a big super bowl party and all of his friends gathered at the super bowl party because they would watch the super bowl and and as they begin to watch it their favorite team you know they was down and and they was losing and and and all of his friends bro david they was discouraged you know how hey the cardinals ain't doing good you know how you feel razorbacks having a razorback fan and a cardinal fan not as much as brother david is but you know we we we we get we we get involved with our teams it's just it's who we are and hey it would grow to a hogs fan your hogs fan and and and when they do bad he was like oh the reps ain't them dumb rips and dumb umpires and you know and and then somebody that's rooting for the other team is saying that they're quite often very excited about what's going on and then they can flip around but they was all discouraged in the moment because our team was losing and there was fumbles there was interceptions there was all this they've been with this one guy you know he was just sitting there and it didn't didn't phase him can everybody smile tonight let me see smile look at all the smiling faces amen and they look over to this guy and he's just smiling gabe he just he's just happy and now they're down to their last play and down to the last seconds and their favorite teams fixing to lose the super bowl and he's still smiling one of the guys looked at him and said can i just ask you why have you been so excited and happy all the way and we made failures we made mistakes and we thought the interceptions were fumbling the ball and the coach had made the right calls the reps have been making wrong calls and he said well guys i got to make a confession i listened at the game on the radio this morning and we won come on somebody the fumbles didn't mean nothing to him because he already knew the outcome are you hearing me somebody amen we sing the song all the time the battle is already over the victory we know that we're on the winning side amen so don't listen to the devil's lies don't be defeated what's going on the circumstances around you amen the story goes you've already won the victory that day at calvary he said it was finished everything that you have need of even the rapture is already within you hallelujah so every fumble every mistake that you make my brother brown said you ain't got an eraser you make mistakes but you get back up you dust your pants leg off because if god's in your heart you're going to rise again because every bubble ain't going to move me every interception is not going to move me when paul was thrown into prison it didn't move him then when he was sniping he took it over to the fire and he shook it off why because he knew he was going to robe hallelujah why are you so happy in here paul silas because hey when nobody else i'm going to encourage myself right in the midst of their jail cell i'm going to pursue oh why are you did you ready to give up no i'm not ready to give up why are you smiling down here paula silas because i'm here to tell you i already caught a vision brother brown said if it had not been for the vision when the doctor said boy you'll never get over it that's after he's seen the vision you boy you'll never get over it's red but brother brown said every music exploiters have come brother brown said i would have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been for the vision i could smile in the face because the spirit of the lord said your enemy is dead and the doctor said your stomach is withered it'll never be good it'll never restore it can never get no better you hear me brother randall i could see brother brown smile why are you smiling can you hear what i'm telling you never get over this hallelujah praise god hallelujah i would have been a discouraged boy if it had not been for the vision and brother i'm saying like this it's time for the church it's time for action amen they played around and throwed off on this corner flushed it off of this and called it this that he said let's act amen to heal stand on your feet and claim your god-given privileges it's time for action a new testament christianity is the gospel in action it's
