[38:16] getting into the words sometimes you're
[38:18] more relaxed on a wednesday night and
[38:19] you can just come and
[38:21] sometimes you're a little tired i know
[38:23] that so i try not to hold you long but
[38:25] we're about to get in some good stuff
[38:28] and so you just hang with us
[38:29] and i believe that god is just as much
[38:32] god on a wednesday night as he is on a
[38:34] sunday morning or on a monday morning or
[38:36] whatever it is that you have need of him
[38:39] i
[38:39] believe that he's there for you ruth
[38:42] chapter 3 and verse 8
[38:45] we'll continue our subject on the breach
[38:48] tonight
[38:50] it says it came to pass at midnight that
[38:52] the man was afraid
[38:54] and turned himself the lord's kind of
[38:57] startled out of his sleep
[38:59] behold a woman lay at his feet
[39:03] she was laying at the feet of the only
[39:05] man who could do something for her
[39:09] do you ever think about that the only
[39:11] man in the universe
[39:12] that could be her redeemer she was
[39:15] laying at his feet
[39:17] that's where i want to be amen
[39:20] and he said who art thou she answered i
[39:23] am ruth thine handmaid
[39:26] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[39:28] handmaid
[39:29] thou art a near kinsmen amen i pray the
[39:33] lord would add his blessing to the word
[39:34] you may be seated
[39:42] we imagine that
[39:45] ruth as she's there she understands
[39:49] because naomi has told her
[39:52] that he is the only one who can do that
[39:56] for her and something about her she just
[39:59] happens
[40:00] amen to fall in love with the only one
[40:04] and she just happens to meet him and to
[40:06] be in his
[40:07] field what's interesting is that she
[40:10] would not have been there had she not
[40:13] went with naomi
[40:15] so it was necessary for her to follow
[40:18] naomi
[40:19] because it's the only way she could her
[40:20] life could ever meet
[40:22] the only person on earth who could be
[40:25] her redeemer
[40:26] because as long as she stayed in moab
[40:29] as long as she remained in that
[40:31] condition she was a widow
[40:34] needing redemption and only one man
[40:36] could provide that to her
[40:38] and that was boaz the only man on earth
[40:41] who could provide that for her
[40:43] and i will tell you tonight and brother
[40:45] branham is going to get into this in the
[40:46] breach but i i'm here to tell you
[40:49] tonight that jesus christ is the only
[40:52] one who can who can meet the
[40:54] requirements of redemption
[40:56] who has met the requirements of
[40:58] redemption who has redeemed our soul
[41:01] and one day will also redeem our bodies
[41:04] and that's
[41:04] also will redeem the earth he's the only
[41:08] one who can qualify
[41:10] aren't you glad for that tonight i mean
[41:12] no wonder brother branham said the
[41:13] message is christ
[41:15] but you see if if she had not met naomi
[41:19] if she'd not
[41:20] come through the law she could have
[41:22] never met him
[41:23] she could have never been brought to him
[41:25] and so the law is a school master
[41:28] to bring us to christ so we could not
[41:31] understand who christ
[41:32] was unless the law had come and
[41:35] prefigured him and shadowed him and
[41:37] showed him
[41:38] in every way now and so you can't come
[41:41] if i could say it that way directly to
[41:43] grace but you come
[41:45] to grace through the law
[41:49] you recognize that you're wrong you
[41:51] recognize you're a sinner
[41:53] but then you come to the only one who
[41:54] can provide you grace
[41:57] now and we believe in grace don't we
[42:02] what would we be without grace we're
[42:04] going to hear about it tonight now
[42:07] brother branham says adam could not meet
[42:09] the requirements of redemption
[42:12] he could not meet the requirements of
[42:14] redemption
[42:15] after he found he lost it he had sinned
[42:19] and he had separated himself from god
[42:22] was on this side of the chasm the wrong
[42:25] side
[42:27] so he could not redeem it
[42:30] here it reminds me here not long ago we
[42:32] were on vacation we went to charleston
[42:34] and when you get to charleston there's
[42:36] an island that you can go on to go to
[42:38] fort moultrie
[42:39] we went to fort moultrie where you can
[42:41] see across the harbor but it's an island
[42:43] there's one
[42:44] bridge going across
[42:47] and coming back we realized that fact
[42:50] because we got stuck in traffic
[42:52] on the way back but there's only one
[42:53] bridge only one way to get there
[42:56] to get back to the highway to get back
[42:58] to charleston to get back to the
[43:00] mainland
[43:01] only one way see we were on the other
[43:02] side of the chasm
[43:04] we were on the wrong side we were on the
[43:07] island
[43:08] separated from god's mercy separated
[43:10] from god's grace
[43:11] and so we were on the wrong side of the
[43:13] chasm and only one man
[43:14] is one mediator between god and man the
[43:17] man christ jesus do we believe that
[43:19] tonight
[43:20] one mediator and i want us to think
[43:22] about this when we think about him being
[43:23] the only one
[43:24] because i thought deeply about this
[43:26] today and through the week and
[43:28] and we're going to get really in depth
[43:30] maybe into this if the lord would let us
[43:32] but sometimes getting in depth is not
[43:34] what we think it is
[43:35] it's it's not in the great things we
[43:38] can't understand because if i present it
[43:40] in a way
[43:40] that you can't understand it it's not it
[43:43] is deep but it's just
[43:44] mysterious it's not a revelation but if
[43:47] we could ever get it
[43:48] simple enough if we could get simple
[43:50] enough just to believe it because
[43:52] there's certain parts of it especially
[43:54] the incarnation of christ and
[43:56] and how great he is that we just have to
[43:57] believe it
[44:00] there's parts of it that we can't really
[44:02] really comprehend yet
[44:05] but but we're going to be learning about
[44:06] it for a long time aren't we
[44:08] we got plenty of time we've got eternity
[44:10] to learn about him
[44:12] so now we find that he could not do it
[44:16] he had sinned and separated himself from
[44:18] god he was on this side of the chasm he
[44:20] could not redeem it
[44:21] he just couldn't do it because he needed
[44:23] redemption
[44:24] himself so he could not do it
[44:28] and so we find then that no man was
[44:29] worthy he said but the law required
[44:32] a kinsmen redeemer the law of god
[44:36] required
[44:37] a kinsmen redeemer he said you want to
[44:41] mark that down he said he'd find it in
[44:42] leviticus 25. now i'm not going to read
[44:45] all of leviticus 25 tonight because
[44:47] we've read it recently
[44:49] in this study but leviticus 25 25 says
[44:52] this if thy brother be wax and poor
[44:55] and sold away some of his possession and
[44:57] if any of his kin
[44:59] notice his kin come to redeem it
[45:02] then shall he redeem that which his
[45:05] brother sold it had to be
[45:07] kin if humans lost it humans would have
[45:11] to get it back
[45:13] it has to be a man if a man lost it a
[45:15] man would have to get it back
[45:17] now watch brother branham says we won't
[45:19] have time
[45:20] to thoroughly search this he said
[45:23] because you know each text
[45:25] would make a night well praise god
[45:29] we got time now right right and so he
[45:32] said each text would make a night and
[45:34] you know i'll stop there and say this
[45:36] that
[45:36] we do not pretend to know more than a
[45:38] prophet
[45:40] right but we should understand what he
[45:42] said
[45:43] better than the people who originally
[45:45] heard it
[45:46] and i say we should because i know it's
[45:49] by revelation but you look at the time
[45:51] that's
[45:51] best passed and the amount of preaching
[45:55] that we've heard and the amount of times
[45:56] that we've heard it
[45:57] that we get the the benefit of having
[45:59] heard it over and over
[46:01] also the benefit of being able to
[46:02] compare it with the scripture being able
[46:04] to compare it with other things that
[46:06] brother branham said
[46:07] we should understand it better today
[46:09] than they ever did back there
[46:12] but he said you know each text would
[46:14] make a night now we've had the benefit
[46:15] of being able to do this
[46:17] now he said but god's law received a
[46:20] substitute
[46:22] he said now what if god had not offered
[46:24] to take a substitute
[46:26] think about that what if he'd not
[46:28] offered
[46:30] to take a substitute amen
[46:33] then that would have been it right it
[46:36] had been like satan's seed god never
[46:37] offered
[46:38] to take a substitute for the angels
[46:41] right there's
[46:42] no redemption for angels god never
[46:44] offered
[46:46] he never did he never said now satan
[46:48] falls and takes the angels with him
[46:50] i'll allow them to make a sacrifice
[46:53] until a perfect
[46:54] sacrifice comes he never did it but it's
[46:56] only among men
[46:58] mankind human beings that god allows
[47:00] them to mess up
[47:01] allows him to go because we're the ones
[47:04] that redemption was going to cho
[47:05] was going to show through and that's why
[47:07] we remain
[47:08] humans we retain our humanity on some
[47:11] level
[47:12] even in glorified bodies and we live on
[47:14] the earth and in some level and i guess
[47:16] i
[47:16] never really realized that like i have
[47:18] over this last few weeks that we've got
[47:20] to retain that because we're the ones
[47:22] that god was going to show redemption
[47:24] through
[47:25] he couldn't show it through an angel and
[47:28] so he's not going to make us
[47:29] angels again right we're going to retain
[47:32] our humanity on some degree
[47:34] and sometimes we blame everything on our
[47:36] humanity but it's actually
[47:38] that that god wants to use
[47:42] he wants to show himself amen he wants
[47:45] to partner with you
[47:48] partner with me amen
[47:51] which is what he did in christ and we'll
[47:53] get to that as we go through this
[47:55] but brother brother said what if god had
[47:57] not offered to take a substitute
[47:59] but love constrained him to do it
[48:04] amen that man was without a way back
[48:07] and there's no way for him to get back
[48:10] he was gone
[48:12] but the grace of god met this kent
[48:15] kinsman redeemer in the person
[48:19] of jesus christ
[48:22] amen that's what makes him different
[48:25] from anybody else the grace of god
[48:29] met this kinsman redeemer in the person
[48:32] of jesus christ and that's why it's
[48:34] still
[48:34] the person of jesus christ today
[48:37] even today in the form of the holy
[48:39] spirit it's the person the literal life
[48:42] of christ coming back on the believer
[48:43] that's still who we worship that's still
[48:46] who we are directed by
[48:47] that's still who has the preeminence in
[48:49] the church is the person of jesus christ
[48:52] amen he don't he don't want no man to
[48:54] have it over
[48:55] an oversight of the church he is the
[48:57] head of the church
[48:59] right and so and so he is the
[49:03] uh the person of jesus christ that's
[49:05] where grace met the kinsman redeemer
[49:08] he said law required it grace
[49:11] met its requirements he said oh he
[49:14] quotes they said oh amazing grace how
[49:16] sweet to sound
[49:18] god's law required an innocent
[49:22] substitute now grace did not just
[49:25] cover the law or say the law is not
[49:28] needed anymore
[49:30] which is an argument you hear all the
[49:32] time anymore right
[49:33] you hear that all the time you see that
[49:35] on the internet you hear it from people
[49:37] well i'm under grace i don't have to
[49:40] dress a certain way or act a certain way
[49:41] i'm under grace no grace did not cover
[49:43] the law
[49:44] grace did not grace did not just say
[49:47] well it's okay
[49:49] but what did grace do grace met the
[49:51] requirements of the law
[49:53] he said think not that i've come to
[49:55] destroy the law
[49:56] or the prophets i'm not come to destroy
[50:00] but to fulfill to bring into reality
[50:03] those things that were shown in shadow
[50:05] in the old testament to bring it into
[50:07] reality
[50:08] he says i'm not come to destroy but to
[50:10] fulfill romans 8 3
[50:12] it says i love this it's beautiful he
[50:14] said for what the law could not do
[50:16] in that it was weak through the flesh
[50:19] you realize you can take that back to
[50:20] the book of ruth and type it with naomi
[50:22] because she could not produce a child
[50:25] right she could not ever retain
[50:27] even if she was allowed to live in her
[50:29] old home she could never retain
[50:31] a place because she had failed to
[50:34] produce a son
[50:36] right she all her sons were dead
[50:40] her sons had died and so now there was
[50:41] no hope of redemption for naomi
[50:44] amen but she'd had a daughter oh my
[50:48] but look she would reach a place and the
[50:50] bible even says that where she was past
[50:52] childbearing she couldn't so the only
[50:55] hope was marriage
[50:57] the only hope was that she could get
[50:58] married but she couldn't get remarried
[51:01] so the only hope then that she had was
[51:02] that her daughter-in-law would get
[51:04] remarried
[51:06] amen and when that happened then she
[51:08] could
[51:09] she could be redeemed through the
[51:11] marriage because why
[51:12] now listen the marriage only brought
[51:15] redemption because ruth produced an
[51:17] offspring
[51:20] right and think through that for just a
[51:22] moment with me because
[51:24] this message doesn't do us any good
[51:27] unless it produces something
[51:31] right it's not just hearing it
[51:34] redemption is not complete until amen
[51:38] until the baby's born
[51:42] hallelujah one of these days sir we're
[51:45] looking for a promised son
[51:48] amen and christ is being born right now
[51:50] in your heart unless that
[51:51] unless he's born in your heart unless
[51:53] you unless you become that word
[51:56] then it doesn't do you any good to
[51:58] identify with it
[52:01] right because it still wouldn't have
[52:03] produced any offspring but that's why
[52:04] the
[52:05] book of ruth goes all the way through
[52:07] the child once she's had a child it
[52:09] stops
[52:10] why because redemption is complete
[52:15] think about it a moment hey man
[52:19] i realized that that actually a few
[52:21] years ago and i thought oh god
[52:23] see she had to reach a place where she
[52:25] wasn't a widow anymore
[52:27] she didn't think about herself as a
[52:28] widow she was a wife
[52:30] when she become a wife she began to
[52:32] produce she wasn't like these other
[52:34] women that didn't want children brother
[52:35] brandon said they didn't want any of
[52:36] them
[52:37] pentecostal acts 238 children but she
[52:39] had to be one
[52:40] who had a desire amen for the seed and
[52:43] to have a baby
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:49] i'm gonna have to quit doing that or
[52:52] we're gonna be in trouble
[52:54] now notice what the law could not do
[52:58] what naomi could not do
[53:00] because she was weak through the flesh
[53:03] it was weak through the flesh god
[53:05] sending his own son in the likeness of
[53:08] sinful flesh
[53:11] notice he's in the likeness of flesh but
[53:13] in the image of god
[53:16] there's a difference he looked like
[53:18] flesh
[53:19] but he's in the image of god and he was
[53:21] flesh but he was born of a virgin and
[53:24] so now he says and for sin condemned sin
[53:27] in the flesh now watch that the
[53:31] righteousness of the law might be
[53:32] fulfilled again
[53:34] it's meeting the requirements of the law
[53:36] how do we fulfill the righteousness of
[53:37] the law
[53:38] not by going back and trying to live by
[53:40] the law not by trying to
[53:41] make sure everything's just right and we
[53:44] eat the right foods and
[53:45] we drink the right things that's not how
[53:47] we fulfill the righteousness of the law
[53:49] we fulfill the righteousness of the law
[53:52] by not walking after the flesh but after
[53:54] the spirit
[53:57] so brother branham picks it up he said
[53:59] who was innocent
[54:01] every man had been born sexual after sex
[54:04] everyone now he said in the only one
[54:08] that
[54:09] wasn't that would have been adam had
[54:12] forfeit the rights to eternal life
[54:14] and to be king on the earth
[54:19] oh but there's coming a king of kings
[54:21] he'll be king on the earth right but
[54:24] adam gave that up and but that's where
[54:25] we're going back to that sunshine now
[54:27] look
[54:29] he said oh and i think of that scripture
[54:32] for thou hast redeemed us back to god
[54:35] we may reign and be kings and priests
[54:38] upon the earth
[54:39] he said oh my what the kinsman redeemer
[54:43] or what a story we we would have here
[54:46] and he says now
[54:50] he says notice law required a kinsman
[54:52] redeemer to redeem a lost substance if
[54:55] it's lost
[54:56] means it had to be the original owners
[54:59] at some point
[55:01] right it's lost you had to be the
[55:03] original owner for to be lost
[55:06] and you were the lost substance and he
[55:09] said grace
[55:10] met this requirement again he says it in
[55:12] the person
[55:13] of jesus christ right
[55:16] grace met this requirement in the person
[55:19] of jesus christ redemption
[55:21] is complete in him right and it's the
[55:24] only way you can take advantage of
[55:26] redemption is to be a part of that
[55:28] right it's through him that's the only
[55:30] way you can't do it through
[55:32] a messenger you can't do it through a
[55:34] preacher you can't do it through a
[55:35] prophet
[55:35] only in christ now and
[55:38] so he says grace met this requirement in
[55:41] the person of jesus christ a kinsmen
[55:43] must be born of the human race
[55:46] he said now how could we be
[55:49] now this is going to get important as we
[55:52] move along and probably in the next
[55:54] weeks if the lord
[55:55] allows me to do it because he says how
[55:58] brother branham gets into the godhead in
[56:00] the breach and i'm glad he did because
[56:02] it gives me an excuse to
[56:04] to study it and preach on it and do
[56:06] these things and
[56:07] you know i could probably take and i
[56:10] won't but i could take the rest of my
[56:11] ministry and preach this one sermon
[56:13] and you would get fed
[56:17] think about what a message we have what
[56:20] an evening light has come
[56:23] because there's so much there but now he
[56:26] said anybody that
[56:27] couldn't see that it was a sex act there
[56:30] he said well he is totally blind because
[56:32] every man that was born was born of a
[56:35] woman
[56:36] so god it had to be that and
[56:39] think about it if it wasn't that there
[56:42] would be no reason for the virgin birth
[56:46] because god would have ordained that
[56:49] method and said that's okay that would
[56:51] have been in the original
[56:53] right and if that was in the original
[56:55] and that's that tells you as well
[56:57] that it won't be when we go back
[57:00] right and that's what jesus said and
[57:02] that should tell people right there if
[57:04] it's not going to be there if it wasn't
[57:05] in the original it's not going to be
[57:07] there
[57:07] then that must have been the problem but
[57:10] but people don't have the eyes to see
[57:12] but
[57:13] uh but here uh it should tell you that
[57:15] because the virgin birth tells us that
[57:17] there was a problem with the way we were
[57:19] born
[57:21] and now he says because every man was
[57:23] born was born of a woman and god
[57:25] required a kinsmen redeemer so there had
[57:27] to be a man born
[57:28] but it couldn't be through that act
[57:32] right it couldn't be and and we should
[57:35] understand that we should you'd think
[57:37] you know today we're i think we get kind
[57:39] of embarrassed sometimes by the serpent
[57:41] seed but we should understand that
[57:43] and it probably makes sense more to
[57:45] people who don't
[57:46] aren't steeped in some religion you know
[57:49] but if you've been told it's an apple
[57:51] for all these many years and then
[57:53] if someone shakes the boat and says it's
[57:55] not an apple then you think oh it's some
[57:56] weird doctrine
[57:58] right and that's what but like brother
[58:01] branham said if it was an
[58:02] apple that's a powerful apple we need to
[58:04] pass the apples again right
[58:06] that makes you realize that you're naked
[58:08] but
[58:09] god required a kinsmen redeemer he said
[58:11] and he must be
[58:12] human he said oh my
[58:15] what are you going to do now law
[58:18] required a kinsmen redeemer
[58:21] he said now he couldn't take an angel he
[58:23] had to have a man
[58:25] because we're not kin to the angel we're
[58:27] kin to one another
[58:30] angel never fail he is a different kind
[58:32] of being
[58:34] got a different body he never sinned or
[58:36] nothing we're talking about the angels
[58:37] that remained with god
[58:38] he never fell he's never sinned
[58:41] right michael gabriel all these other
[58:44] angels whatever they might wormwood
[58:46] they've never failed
[58:47] they've never sinned but god couldn't
[58:50] redeem
[58:51] in that representation of himself that
[58:53] was part of him they were his attributes
[58:55] but he couldn't redeem through them
[58:57] and they could not be redeemed and
[59:00] listen
[59:01] he says the angel never fell he's a
[59:03] different kind of being got a different
[59:04] body and you'll find that in hebrews he
[59:06] said man
[59:06] was created a little lower than the
[59:08] angels why for the purposes of
[59:10] redemption
[59:11] he never sinned or nothing he's
[59:12] different but the law required a kinsman
[59:14] redeemer
[59:15] and every man on earth was born of sex
[59:17] he said now don't you see this there's
[59:19] where it come from
[59:20] that's where sin started he said so you
[59:22] see where it's at now
[59:24] there he comes your seed of the serpent
[59:26] in
[59:27] he said now notice it required a kinsman
[59:30] redeemer
[59:31] and the redeemer kinsman redeemer must
[59:33] be born
[59:34] of the human race he said here that
[59:37] leaves us on a limb
[59:39] every human that was ever born was born
[59:41] that way
[59:42] brother branham was i was everyone that
[59:45] was ever born
[59:48] the only one that hadn't was adam and he
[59:50] fell he's the one that needed redeemed
[59:53] amen but notice he said that leaves us
[59:57] on a limb but let me sound the trumpet
[59:59] to you
[1:00:00] the virgin birth produced the product
[1:00:05] amen the virgin birth produced
[1:00:09] our kinsmen redeemer
[1:00:15] now this is amazing because i thought of
[1:00:17] this as
[1:00:18] you know what kind of resume would you
[1:00:20] have to have
[1:00:22] to get the job of kinsmen redeemer
[1:00:25] right and you look at boaz what kind of
[1:00:27] resume did he have you think about it
[1:00:29] brother branham said that strong angel
[1:00:30] proclaimed with a loud voice who was
[1:00:32] worthy he was
[1:00:33] advertising for a redeemer so he put the
[1:00:36] ad out there like an ad in the paper
[1:00:38] that you had
[1:00:38] advertised for a job put the ad in the
[1:00:41] paper and
[1:00:42] and you show it there and say a redeemer
[1:00:44] you want a redeemer all the ones come up
[1:00:46] isaiah come up and and jeremiah come up
[1:00:48] and all the ones down through history
[1:00:50] they all come up and begin to talk well
[1:00:52] what kind of resume would you have well
[1:00:53] i was a prophet i
[1:00:55] i saw great miracles many signs and
[1:00:57] wonders
[1:00:58] well how are you born
[1:01:02] what about your father and mother
[1:01:07] every one of them amen by faith they
[1:01:10] were looking forward to a redeemer
[1:01:13] but none of them could answer the
[1:01:15] advertisement for redeemer
[1:01:17] nobody could fill that job amen
[1:01:21] until one was born amen that would not
[1:01:24] be
[1:01:25] a person born by sex but by a virgin
[1:01:28] birth
[1:01:30] and the virgin birth produced he said
[1:01:32] our kinsmen redeemer
[1:01:35] now look at that what kind of resume
[1:01:36] would he have to have well he'd have to
[1:01:38] be
[1:01:38] a pretty important man he'd have to be
[1:01:41] pretty wealthy
[1:01:42] he'd have to have the power he'd have to
[1:01:45] have the ability
[1:01:47] he'd have to he he'd have to be able to
[1:01:49] do it he'd have to be kin to us he'd
[1:01:51] have to be human and yet have the power
[1:01:53] to do all these things to redeem us back
[1:01:55] have the ability to pay the price
[1:01:58] amen so notice what he says none other
[1:02:02] none other we we need to
[1:02:06] recognize that and i and we'll get into
[1:02:08] it i don't believe in
[1:02:09] that he's one like our finger but this
[1:02:11] idea of two lords or
[1:02:13] uh that has gone around the message it's
[1:02:15] just wrong
[1:02:17] because none other but the almighty god
[1:02:22] become emmanuel
[1:02:26] amen none other but the almighty god
[1:02:29] you could preach on that for a while
[1:02:32] none other
[1:02:33] but the almighty god become emmanuel one
[1:02:36] of us
[1:02:37] emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was
[1:02:40] met amen he said you see
[1:02:43] how god makes the requirement and
[1:02:46] there's
[1:02:47] nothing we can do now think about it if
[1:02:49] you're required to do something
[1:02:51] and you can't do it what kind of a god
[1:02:53] is that
[1:02:55] right but that's true even of our
[1:02:57] salvation we're required to live in a
[1:02:59] way that we can't live
[1:03:02] are you with me we're required to do
[1:03:05] some things that we can't do
[1:03:07] just mark 16. go into all the world and
[1:03:10] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:03:11] these signs shall follow them that
[1:03:13] believe
[1:03:13] they'll cast out devils speak in new
[1:03:15] tongues if they drink any deadly thing
[1:03:16] it won't harm them
[1:03:17] i can't do it right
[1:03:21] i can't do it god made the requirement
[1:03:24] but she said you see how god makes the
[1:03:26] requirement
[1:03:26] and there's nothing we can amen
[1:03:30] there's nothing we can do but then grace
[1:03:33] steps in
[1:03:36] amen you see if god made a requirement
[1:03:39] if god
[1:03:39] wants you to be a man you can be a real
[1:03:42] man because grace steps in
[1:03:44] if god wants you to have a family a
[1:03:47] godly family you can have a godly family
[1:03:49] in laodicea because grace steps in
[1:03:52] not because you did everything right you
[1:03:54] say well i failed in the past i failed
[1:03:56] with my kids
[1:03:57] but grace has to step in in order to
[1:03:59] meet the requirement
[1:04:01] are you with me tonight grace has got to
[1:04:04] step
[1:04:04] in maybe i should slow down a little bit
[1:04:06] maybe we catch it a little bit better
[1:04:08] but it's got to step in or we cannot we
[1:04:11] cannot produce that requirement
[1:04:13] we can't make it happen but god makes a
[1:04:16] requirement
[1:04:17] and the god that makes a requirement
[1:04:19] when there's nothing we can do he said
[1:04:21] grace steps in
[1:04:22] and overshadows that law
[1:04:25] and produces the product
[1:04:29] hallelujah he said oh when you get over
[1:04:32] home
[1:04:37] he said when i get my little cabin down
[1:04:38] there that brother neville sings about
[1:04:41] when you all hear something down there
[1:04:43] one morning
[1:04:44] seeing amazing grace how sweet the sound
[1:04:48] that saved a wretch like me you say
[1:04:52] praise god oh brother branham made it
[1:04:55] there he is brother branham quotes
[1:04:58] amazing grace
[1:05:02] oh that's the story of my life
[1:05:06] paul said it this way said by the grace
[1:05:07] of god i am what i am
[1:05:10] is that your story tonight that's your
[1:05:12] story by the grace of god grace stepped
[1:05:15] in
[1:05:15] when god made a requirement but you
[1:05:17] couldn't do anything about it
[1:05:19] grace stepped into your situation
[1:05:22] amen now look now why would grace step
[1:05:26] in for you
[1:05:27] i'll think about it for a moment why
[1:05:28] would grace step in for you because
[1:05:30] you're his
[1:05:32] don't let the devil beat you up and tell
[1:05:34] you well well you must not be his
[1:05:36] because you're not the flashiest member
[1:05:37] of the church you you don't speak in
[1:05:39] tongues the most you don't dance the
[1:05:40] most
[1:05:41] he said grace stepped in if grace has
[1:05:43] stepped in for you there's a reason for
[1:05:45] that
[1:05:46] you said but my body hurts in my my
[1:05:49] everything about me hurts and i i have a
[1:05:51] hard
[1:05:52] time even having faith for a headache
[1:05:53] but grace stepped in for you
[1:05:56] and if he stepped in for you there's a
[1:05:58] reason he stepped in
[1:05:59] because you were redeemable why didn't
[1:06:02] you hear the message of the hour
[1:06:04] because god said i have needs to go by
[1:06:08] samaria
[1:06:10] amen why did you catch the revelation of
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:13] in the condition that you were in
[1:06:16] because you had representation on the
[1:06:18] inside
[1:06:18] don't let the devil beat you up about
[1:06:20] that you wouldn't be where you are today
[1:06:22] unless you unless there was something
[1:06:24] about you
[1:06:27] i'm preaching to the elect of god now
[1:06:29] there's something about you
[1:06:30] that was redeemable hey man
[1:06:33] how come ruth ended up in that field how
[1:06:37] would she ever meet that man
[1:06:38] how did she find herself ever laying at
[1:06:41] his feet
[1:06:41] what gives you a desire to come to the
[1:06:43] house of god
[1:06:45] grace steps in amen ruth was just a
[1:06:49] moabitess but grace stepped in
[1:06:51] and the story of her life was completely
[1:06:53] changed because
[1:06:54] somehow she had a desire when others
[1:06:57] left she said i'll go with the word
[1:06:59] i'll go with naomi when everybody else
[1:07:00] left what put that desire in her heart
[1:07:03] grace stepped in hallelujah i got to
[1:07:14] lose some more weight
[1:07:19] but when we do all that we can do
[1:07:22] meet all the requirements we can meet
[1:07:25] grace steps in
[1:07:29] you think you've done everything that
[1:07:30] you can you and you've messed up
[1:07:32] you look at your life and i know how it
[1:07:34] is sometimes i know how it is for a
[1:07:35] family a young family
[1:07:37] you know the things you struggle with
[1:07:38] many of the things you struggle with
[1:07:40] some of you will tell me about i
[1:07:41] you know as a young family maybe as a
[1:07:43] man you there's certain things you have
[1:07:44] to do you realize i struggle with those
[1:07:46] same things
[1:07:48] when it comes to you know well i should
[1:07:49] pray more
[1:07:51] i should i should read my bible more my
[1:07:54] family
[1:07:54] don't always behave the way they should
[1:08:02] but grace steps in
[1:08:06] grace steps in don't put yourself out or
[1:08:10] or sit under condemnation all the time
[1:08:11] because well i'm not what i should be
[1:08:13] no do everything you can but grace steps
[1:08:16] in
[1:08:18] and we ought to that ought to just make
[1:08:19] build such a love such a fire under us
[1:08:22] that we would want to run like like she
[1:08:25] did
[1:08:26] stay in his field we'd want to lay at
[1:08:28] his feet
[1:08:31] we'd want to meet our kinsmen redeemer
[1:08:33] not because somebody made us
[1:08:35] but because grace stepped in
[1:08:38] hallelujah now
[1:08:42] brother branham after he quotes from
[1:08:44] amazing grace
[1:08:46] he said the book of ruth gives a
[1:08:48] beautiful picture of this
[1:08:50] how boaz naomi had lost the estate he
[1:08:52] said you heard me preach on it haven't
[1:08:54] you
[1:08:54] raised your hands up if you heard me
[1:08:55] preach it and that's on the the message
[1:08:58] kinsman redeemer he preached in 1960 if
[1:09:00] you haven't heard it in a while
[1:09:01] go back and listen to it beautiful
[1:09:03] message
[1:09:04] he said so you understand see boaz had
[1:09:07] to become a redeemer
[1:09:09] i love that and he was the only one that
[1:09:12] could
[1:09:14] and he was willing to do it what are the
[1:09:17] odds
[1:09:19] amen he was the only one that could he
[1:09:21] was going to
[1:09:22] he had to be a kinsman a near kinsman
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:25] in redeeming naomi he got ruth
[1:09:29] hallelujah he's the only one who met all
[1:09:33] the requirements to redeem naomi and
[1:09:34] mary ruth
[1:09:36] he said brother branham said that was
[1:09:37] jesus boaz typing christ
[1:09:41] when he redeemed israel he got the
[1:09:42] gentile bride
[1:09:44] he said so then you see so very
[1:09:46] beautiful we have it on tape i'm sure
[1:09:48] here somewhere you'd like to have it
[1:09:50] i want to stop there because i've been
[1:09:52] just a little over 30 minutes and i
[1:09:54] i want to move on to some things
[1:09:59] that is important about this redeemer
[1:10:02] before we move on into some things that
[1:10:05] brother branham says
[1:10:06] next week if the lord wills about the
[1:10:08] godhead
[1:10:09] and now there's some wonderful things
[1:10:13] ahead but i want to stop here for just a
[1:10:14] moment to dwell on this
[1:10:16] i want us to see how that christ is
[1:10:19] uniquely qualified to be our redeemer
[1:10:22] he was uniquely qualified he had to be
[1:10:24] kin he was human
[1:10:26] he was born a man he was the god man
[1:10:30] he had to be worthy and he was worthy
[1:10:34] he had to be able he didn't want he had
[1:10:37] to be able to do it and
[1:10:38] wealthy brother branham says in one
[1:10:39] place he was able
[1:10:42] because he was god right so he had to be
[1:10:45] kin he had to be human but he also had
[1:10:47] to be able
[1:10:48] right he had to have the ability to do
[1:10:50] it he had to
[1:10:52] have the ability to go and be the mighty
[1:10:53] conqueror
[1:10:55] and if not any man could do that every
[1:10:58] other man that ever went down into
[1:11:00] the into paradise and stayed there
[1:11:04] jesus goes down there and unlocks the
[1:11:05] door and comes back
[1:11:09] look and he had to be willing i'm so
[1:11:12] glad he was
[1:11:15] now in revelation 5 9 it says that they
[1:11:19] sung a new song saying thou art worthy
[1:11:22] to take the book now why was he worthy
[1:11:23] to take the book
[1:11:24] and to open the seals for you were you
[1:11:26] were saying
[1:11:27] right so he was worthy to take the book
[1:11:29] and open the seals because he was slain
[1:11:31] because he died on a cross and has
[1:11:32] redeemed us to god by thy blood out of
[1:11:35] every kindred and tongue
[1:11:36] and people and nation you've redeemed us
[1:11:39] but so they said you're worthy to take
[1:11:41] the book
[1:11:42] because you're slain but he had to be
[1:11:43] worthy to die for our sins
[1:11:47] before he was could be worthy to take
[1:11:49] the book he had to be worthy
[1:11:51] to die for our sins he had to be born
[1:11:54] sinless remain sinless
[1:11:59] and fulfill all that was written in the
[1:12:01] word
[1:12:04] and be able to get up and make the claim
[1:12:07] that in the volume of the book
[1:12:09] it was written to me now he did that at
[1:12:11] the same time
[1:12:13] that he was a human and cried when his
[1:12:16] friend died
[1:12:20] think about it for a minute the same
[1:12:23] time that he
[1:12:24] he was god and was able to stop a storm
[1:12:29] he was laying asleep in the boat
[1:12:33] right the same time that he he his deity
[1:12:36] was shown by raising lazarus from the
[1:12:38] dead
[1:12:40] by speaking to lazarus he cried
[1:12:44] over his friend's death in the same time
[1:12:48] that he raised the widow's son he was
[1:12:50] laying brother branham said they're
[1:12:51] sitting on a rock with a headache
[1:12:55] now think about that because many times
[1:12:57] we think that this somehow this
[1:12:58] experience that we have of the holy
[1:13:01] ghost will make us
[1:13:02] to be perfect in the sense we will never
[1:13:04] have any problems
[1:13:05] but god never said that what did it do
[1:13:09] for him
[1:13:11] he suffered like no man had ever
[1:13:12] suffered
[1:13:14] he could still feel the pain he felt
[1:13:17] rejected
[1:13:19] he took it hard when judas left
[1:13:22] he said you betray the son of man with a
[1:13:24] kiss
[1:13:26] it won't make it where you can't feel
[1:13:27] rejection it won't make it where you
[1:13:29] can't but what does it do it makes it
[1:13:31] where you're
[1:13:32] under control where you respond in the
[1:13:34] right way
[1:13:35] the bible says when he was reviled he
[1:13:37] reviled not again
[1:13:39] when he he was cursed he threatened not
[1:13:42] so the holy ghost does not reduce the
[1:13:44] amount of threatening that comes to you
[1:13:46] it does not reduce the amount of cursing
[1:13:48] in fact it increases it
[1:13:51] because the devil's after you and people
[1:13:54] can see that you're different they come
[1:13:55] after you
[1:13:56] what does the devil do immediately after
[1:13:58] the the spirit come down on
[1:14:00] the dove come to the lamb at the river
[1:14:02] immediately after that he went into the
[1:14:04] temptation
[1:14:06] immediately why because that was the
[1:14:09] that was the devil
[1:14:10] for trying to make him prove who he was
[1:14:14] amen and the devil's trying to make you
[1:14:16] prove who you are
[1:14:17] but you listen you can stand the same
[1:14:20] way he did by the word
[1:14:23] hallelujah and so at the same time that
[1:14:26] we cannot
[1:14:28] we cannot think that we're
[1:14:31] delivered from all the trials of life
[1:14:34] or even temptation we do believe
[1:14:38] that we can overcome every one of them
[1:14:43] are you with me why because the kinsmen
[1:14:45] did
[1:14:48] and if that same spirit that was in
[1:14:51] christ dwelling you will it will also
[1:14:54] quicken make alive your mortal body
[1:14:59] so the potential is in you to be that
[1:15:01] overcomer like he was
[1:15:06] amen oh and that's why a prophet of god
[1:15:10] exposes our potentials and shows us what
[1:15:13] our potentials are in the easter seal
[1:15:14] and
[1:15:15] it is the rising of the sun now look he
[1:15:18] was worthy he had to remain sinless
[1:15:20] and and we've been taught by the word
[1:15:23] that we are redeemed
[1:15:25] right now and and our soul is as
[1:15:28] redeemed as it will ever be
[1:15:30] brother branham even makes a statement
[1:15:32] at future home that we're in that eighth
[1:15:34] day
[1:15:35] when it comes to the soul
[1:15:39] we are we've passed from death into life
[1:15:42] colossians 1 14 the bible says in whom
[1:15:45] in whom that's christ we have redemption
[1:15:48] through his blood
[1:15:50] even the forgiveness of sins now look
[1:15:53] let's look at his resume for a moment
[1:15:56] right you look at boaz's resume he was
[1:15:58] the only one uniquely qualified he was
[1:16:01] rich
[1:16:02] he was right there in the area he was
[1:16:04] supposed to be in he was rich he was
[1:16:06] qualified he was willing
[1:16:08] he was a kinsmen look at the
[1:16:11] resume of christ if you will tonight and
[1:16:15] he said
[1:16:15] brother ben i already know this but
[1:16:18] listen to me
[1:16:19] there's a power in your life if you
[1:16:21] exalt christ in your thinking
[1:16:25] think about this there's a power have
[1:16:26] you ever thought about that whenever you
[1:16:28] exalt sickness
[1:16:29] sickness takes over whatever you exalt
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:33] and this is none of my notes but just
[1:16:35] just hang with me for a moment whatever
[1:16:36] you exalt in your thoughts
[1:16:39] whatever you dwell on is what you become
[1:16:42] and it's what has power over you so if
[1:16:45] you exalt sickness listen you've met
[1:16:48] people like that they exhaust sickness
[1:16:50] in
[1:16:50] in their mind they're constantly worried
[1:16:52] about getting sick and they get sick
[1:16:55] they've exalted that in their mind if
[1:16:57] you exalt
[1:16:58] if you exalt adultery if you exalt
[1:17:00] whatever it is you'll end up
[1:17:01] being that if you let it sit there and
[1:17:04] exalt it in your mind
[1:17:06] whatever oh my whatever you exalt in
[1:17:08] your mind
[1:17:09] i want us to exalt christ for just a
[1:17:11] moment
[1:17:12] to make him preeminent in our minds to
[1:17:15] make him preeminent in our hearts
[1:17:16] if we can exalt him let's look at his
[1:17:18] resume see who he is
[1:17:20] because when we're thinking about him
[1:17:22] when we're reading about who he is
[1:17:23] and what he's done what does it do when
[1:17:26] we exalt him
[1:17:27] we become him are you with me now
[1:17:33] it changes our way of thinking
[1:17:37] notice his resume right up on the top
[1:17:42] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:17:46] that's a pretty strong recommendation
[1:17:48] right there
[1:17:53] you know i put a lot of things on my
[1:17:55] resume i won't deny it
[1:17:58] i put and they're all true but sometimes
[1:18:00] you don't put all necessarily everything
[1:18:02] bad
[1:18:04] right you don't put on there sometimes
[1:18:05] shows up late during the week
[1:18:08] you know drinks too much coffee at the
[1:18:10] office
[1:18:13] there's things you could put on there
[1:18:14] that wouldn't be it would look too
[1:18:16] flattering to you
[1:18:18] there ain't none of that in him
[1:18:22] scripture said he's altogether lovely
[1:18:26] so his resume he could be tell exactly
[1:18:28] the truth
[1:18:31] you look at some people and you think
[1:18:32] they don't match the resume you look at
[1:18:34] the person
[1:18:35] and you look at what they've sent and
[1:18:36] you think that can't be them
[1:18:40] right because what they've written about
[1:18:41] themselves can't be them but you look at
[1:18:44] it sometimes on a resume they'll put
[1:18:45] some trick questions on there on
[1:18:47] or on a job application they'll put
[1:18:48] something on there and say
[1:18:50] who is your who do you want to emulate
[1:18:52] who do you want to be like
[1:18:54] it's on the resume for a kinsmen
[1:18:56] redeemer the image of the invisible god
[1:19:01] that's a powerful resume enhancement
[1:19:05] he is the image he's not trying to be
[1:19:08] like god
[1:19:11] hallelujah he's the image of god
[1:19:14] he's the expression of what god is the
[1:19:17] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:19:19] he's the image of the invisible god he's
[1:19:21] the firstborn
[1:19:23] of every creature or creation
[1:19:26] the firstborn amen
[1:19:29] now notice paul does not say that christ
[1:19:32] is an emanation from god or
[1:19:34] or that he is just something that god
[1:19:37] used for a while and discarded
[1:19:40] as someone have you believe even in the
[1:19:42] message
[1:19:43] but he is the image of god
[1:19:47] it's strange to me that people can build
[1:19:49] their entire career
[1:19:50] and i'm not preaching in any person or
[1:19:52] any church but it's a doctrine that's
[1:19:53] out there
[1:19:54] that they believe that christ is no
[1:19:56] different than brother branham
[1:19:59] and build their entire career on on
[1:20:01] christ being
[1:20:03] being lower or being something similar
[1:20:06] to us
[1:20:06] in that sense but i've never been able
[1:20:09] to put that on my resume
[1:20:11] at least not on my own merit
[1:20:16] you don't have redemption by my blood
[1:20:20] or any other anybody else you can't get
[1:20:22] forgiveness of sins by praying to me
[1:20:26] i'm i'm i wasn't the image of the
[1:20:28] invisible god at least not in the flesh
[1:20:31] you understand i was not the firstborn
[1:20:33] of every creature
[1:20:34] but he did not say well christ is is a
[1:20:38] work of god he said he's god himself
[1:20:39] image means the exact
[1:20:41] reproduction amen
[1:20:47] god reproducing himself pouring
[1:20:50] all that was in god he poured into
[1:20:52] christ the exact reproduction
[1:20:55] he's not one of god's creatures but the
[1:20:57] highest firstborn of the creation
[1:21:01] now so it gives him precedence it
[1:21:04] doesn't refer to time
[1:21:06] but to position and he says all things
[1:21:09] were created by him now
[1:21:12] in verse 16 for by him were all things
[1:21:14] created
[1:21:15] so you could get down to the section of
[1:21:17] the resume that says
[1:21:19] okay what have you done
[1:21:21] [Laughter]
[1:21:24] what did you do you know how you like to
[1:21:27] if you want to
[1:21:28] look at your resume you know you look at
[1:21:30] that and and sometimes on your resume
[1:21:32] you'll want to put i've had to do
[1:21:33] several resumes maybe the rest of you
[1:21:35] haven't had to do this but i have that
[1:21:37] i've had i've done several i in fact i
[1:21:39] kept one
[1:21:40] in case i just got tired of my job or
[1:21:42] not but i found out too that you got
[1:21:45] if you if you kept a resume
[1:21:48] and maybe your bosses don't want to hear
[1:21:50] this but that if you keep one on hand
[1:21:52] you never know when the opportunity
[1:21:53] might come up
[1:21:54] and you can update it and send it out
[1:21:57] and and everybody's looking for somebody
[1:21:58] who's already working
[1:22:00] so the best time to look for jobs when
[1:22:02] you already have one
[1:22:04] right and and but in my resume what did
[1:22:07] you do well
[1:22:08] we were the best title company in the
[1:22:11] region
[1:22:11] you know i could say that but i could
[1:22:14] never claim it completely by myself
[1:22:16] right and some people might be bold
[1:22:18] enough to do that and say well i was
[1:22:20] just that or the other
[1:22:21] but no matter where you were if you were
[1:22:23] that turtle sitting on a post somebody
[1:22:24] puts you there
[1:22:26] right and and so there's always somebody
[1:22:29] that helps you
[1:22:30] but by him amen
[1:22:33] were all things created
[1:22:37] don't tell me he's just another man
[1:22:40] although he was a man
[1:22:42] when he was poured down and come down
[1:22:43] into in that fleshly body
[1:22:45] he was a man but don't tell me he was
[1:22:46] just a man because by him were all
[1:22:48] things created that are in heaven
[1:22:50] that are in earth visible and invisible
[1:22:54] amen you can put on there i've created
[1:22:57] things you've never seen
[1:23:00] think about that one for a moment he
[1:23:03] even created the devil
[1:23:07] he did i made it the devil cannot claim
[1:23:12] if the devil was true you realize why
[1:23:14] the devil couldn't be the redeemer
[1:23:15] couldn't be the kinsman he couldn't
[1:23:17] claim to have created anything
[1:23:21] but this lamb of god
[1:23:25] who was worthy this one was worthy
[1:23:28] by him all things were created visible
[1:23:30] in this invisible whether they be
[1:23:32] thrones
[1:23:33] or dominions or principalities or powers
[1:23:37] all things were created by him and for
[1:23:40] him
[1:23:43] you get a pretty good job if you could
[1:23:44] tell them you created the law of gravity
[1:23:49] huh you know newton newton could get a
[1:23:52] good job
[1:23:52] probably after he realized the apple
[1:23:54] always fell down
[1:23:57] got hit in the head by that apple i
[1:23:59] believe it was isaac newton got hit
[1:24:00] ahead by that apple enough times
[1:24:02] he could probably get a good job
[1:24:04] anywhere hey i'm the guy
[1:24:06] you know i'm the guy that this one
[1:24:10] created the tree and the apple and the
[1:24:14] gravity
[1:24:17] exalt him in your thoughts tonight don't
[1:24:18] you realize that if he created the apple
[1:24:21] and the tree and the gravity
[1:24:22] he's able to take care of whatever's
[1:24:24] going on in your life he's able to take
[1:24:26] care of your children
[1:24:27] and your grandchildren he's able to take
[1:24:29] care of your marriage he's able to take
[1:24:31] care of your situation whatever that it
[1:24:33] is no matter how dark it may be
[1:24:35] and like i said i know i hear from
[1:24:37] people week after week
[1:24:38] that struggle that really struggle in
[1:24:40] their lives but remember
[1:24:41] if you're struggling the one that you
[1:24:43] serve the one that's in you greater is
[1:24:45] he
[1:24:46] than he that's in the world greater is
[1:24:48] he and he's not
[1:24:50] somewhere else we're not talking about a
[1:24:51] god that lived 2 000 years ago
[1:24:54] we're not talking about somebody sitting
[1:24:56] on the throne somewhere in heaven we're
[1:24:57] talking
[1:24:58] about one who sits on the throne of our
[1:25:00] hearts
[1:25:02] amen all things were created by him
[1:25:06] and for him and he is before all things
[1:25:11] and by him all things
[1:25:14] consist all things consist that word
[1:25:18] actually means to hold together he holds
[1:25:21] all things together
[1:25:27] he got a big job just holding me
[1:25:29] together
[1:25:33] but he can hold the church together
[1:25:37] he can hold your family together
[1:25:40] why by him all things consist all things
[1:25:44] are held together by him the universe
[1:25:47] and the planets and everything they
[1:25:49] don't go spinning out of control
[1:25:50] that's why we don't worry too much yes
[1:25:52] we we're concerned for our friend and
[1:25:54] our
[1:25:54] friends and family when a pandemic comes
[1:25:56] on the earth but by him
[1:25:58] all things consists he holds all things
[1:26:00] together
[1:26:01] he's able listen if it got if it got so
[1:26:03] bad that no one else had a job
[1:26:06] you would still god somehow there would
[1:26:08] be a way that you would be fed
[1:26:11] you've seen that the one who holds all
[1:26:13] things together somehow has held you in
[1:26:15] a workplace
[1:26:16] somehow it's allowed you to live somehow
[1:26:18] it's to put enough money in the bank
[1:26:20] that you'd be able to cover your bills
[1:26:22] somehow
[1:26:22] he's covered he's held your life
[1:26:24] together
[1:26:26] amen think about how big he must be if
[1:26:28] he could put on the resume
[1:26:30] i created all things everything visible
[1:26:33] and invisible and i also held together
[1:26:35] the life
[1:26:36] of ben pruitt i also held together the
[1:26:38] life amen
[1:26:39] amen of every person sitting here today
[1:26:41] every person streaming every person
[1:26:43] that's ever
[1:26:44] ever created that that was his he holds
[1:26:47] them together
[1:26:50] by him all things consists even allows
[1:26:53] politics to come and go and things to
[1:26:55] happen
[1:26:57] even though the devil we know is in
[1:26:58] charge of those things but god allows it
[1:27:01] he holds all things together
[1:27:06] people laugh at him and curse him make
[1:27:09] fun of him
[1:27:10] and by him all things consist
[1:27:14] they wouldn't even know what it was like
[1:27:15] to live
[1:27:17] if it wasn't for him
[1:27:20] like a brother branham likened it to a
[1:27:22] pig at the bottom of an apple tree
[1:27:24] and he never does look up to see where
[1:27:26] it's coming from
[1:27:28] and they sit down and curse his name
[1:27:29] make fun of him call
[1:27:31] call his people holy rollers and
[1:27:33] everything else bunch of cults and
[1:27:34] everything else
[1:27:35] and they don't realize that by him their
[1:27:37] very life consists he allows them to
[1:27:39] live
[1:27:42] and even look at his look at his enemy
[1:27:44] see by the way you treat your enemies
[1:27:46] that's how you know a big man
[1:27:47] by the way he's he's so not scared
[1:27:50] listen sometimes we get paranoid i've
[1:27:51] watched pastors get paranoid of other
[1:27:53] churches
[1:27:54] paranoid of everybody else around them
[1:27:56] and it's a terrible thing
[1:27:57] because god is not paranoid at all he's
[1:28:00] so not paranoid that he gives rain to
[1:28:02] the just and the unjust
[1:28:05] he's not worried about him getting too
[1:28:06] powerful he allows satan to operate in
[1:28:09] satan's eden he's not worried about him
[1:28:11] getting too powerful
[1:28:12] because by him all things consist
[1:28:15] you know the confidence that you have
[1:28:16] with your little child when they're
[1:28:18] little
[1:28:18] mine are getting bigger so i don't have
[1:28:20] quite as much confidence as i used to
[1:28:21] but when they're little what do you say
[1:28:23] i brought you into this world i can take
[1:28:24] you out
[1:28:28] you may have never said that but i have
[1:28:30] and i wouldn't actually do it but you
[1:28:32] understand
[1:28:33] i brought them into the world i have a
[1:28:35] little bit of confidence when it comes
[1:28:37] to telling them what to do
[1:28:39] i'm not afraid to i'm not afraid they're
[1:28:42] going to get too big
[1:28:43] for me because i bet see by him all
[1:28:45] things consist the devil can't never get
[1:28:46] too big for him the world can't spin too
[1:28:49] far out of control
[1:28:50] we can't get too deep and labor to see
[1:28:52] it we can't things can't get so dark
[1:28:54] you can't be so sick that god jehovah
[1:28:57] god who created the heavens and the
[1:28:58] earth and then poured himself
[1:29:00] and manifested himself in christ the
[1:29:02] anointed word that that
[1:29:03] that being cannot take care of your life
[1:29:05] today
[1:29:08] hallelujah
[1:29:12] are you still with me tonight
[1:29:18] he's before all things by him all things
[1:29:20] consists and he is the head of the body
[1:29:23] the church amen
[1:29:27] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:29:30] the dead
[1:29:31] that in how many things all things
[1:29:35] he might have the preeminence for it
[1:29:38] pleased the father
[1:29:40] that in him should all fullness dwell
[1:29:43] and having made peace to the blood of
[1:29:45] his cross
[1:29:46] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:29:49] himself
[1:29:50] by him i say whether there be things in
[1:29:52] earth or things in heaven
[1:29:54] by him he's going to reconcile and what
[1:29:56] that means is that we
[1:29:58] listen we've had this redemption but yet
[1:30:00] it is his work
[1:30:01] to bring about a full redemption
[1:30:05] not anybody else's it's his work
[1:30:10] amen listen it's not our work to bring
[1:30:13] about full redemption as his work
[1:30:16] why because in hebrews 13 8 it tells us
[1:30:18] jesus christ is the same
[1:30:20] yesterday and today and forever
[1:30:23] now look we are redeemed
[1:30:26] yet we are waiting for redemption
[1:30:30] listen galatians 3 13 christ hath
[1:30:32] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:30:34] he made a curse for us first peter 1 18
[1:30:36] for as much as you know
[1:30:37] you were not redeemed with corruptable
[1:30:39] things as silver and gold from your vain
[1:30:42] conversation received by tradition from
[1:30:44] your fathers but with the precious blood
[1:30:46] of christ
[1:30:47] you are redeemed right your soul is as
[1:30:51] redeemed as you'll ever be
[1:30:52] if there is a future work of redemption
[1:30:56] you understand you are redeemed you are
[1:30:58] being redeemed you will be redeemed
[1:31:02] hang with me for a moment because
[1:31:06] god's going to claim your body
[1:31:12] now we're going to get to it in the
[1:31:14] breach but that's what he's doing
[1:31:18] see that's what this message is about
[1:31:21] it was redemption amen
[1:31:24] it was redemption just like when he come
[1:31:26] the first time for redemption he come
[1:31:29] this time in what brother branham called
[1:31:31] this claiming work
[1:31:32] now look you say well there's no future
[1:31:36] redemption what is jesus talking about
[1:31:38] then when he says lift up your heads
[1:31:39] your redemption draweth nigh
[1:31:42] when you see these things begin to come
[1:31:43] to pass
[1:31:45] in romans 8 28 8 23 rather not only they
[1:31:49] but ourselves also
[1:31:50] which have the first fruits of the
[1:31:52] spirit we have the holy ghost we are
[1:31:54] redeemed
[1:31:56] but even we ourselves grown within
[1:31:58] ourselves
[1:31:59] waiting for the adoption to win or which
[1:32:02] is this
[1:32:04] the redemption of our body
[1:32:08] ephesians 1 14 speaking of the holy
[1:32:10] ghost he said it's the earnest of our
[1:32:12] inheritance
[1:32:13] i got two minutes left hang with me is
[1:32:16] the earnest of our inheritance
[1:32:18] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:32:19] possession until the redemption
[1:32:22] it's a purchased possession but it's
[1:32:24] going to be fully redeemed
[1:32:27] amen unto the praise of his glory
[1:32:30] ephesians 4 30 and this is ephesians
[1:32:32] placing us
[1:32:33] and showing us what we are what we will
[1:32:35] be look ephesians 4 30.
[1:32:37] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:32:38] whereby you're sealed unto what
[1:32:40] unto the day of redemption
[1:32:45] until the day of redemption see he had
[1:32:48] to redeem israel you know in the old
[1:32:49] testament is full of redemption but it
[1:32:51] mostly speaks of israel's redemption it
[1:32:54] speaks of redemption for a nation
[1:32:56] and that redemption had to be put on
[1:32:58] hold but it's his work that did it
[1:33:02] right but he's cut but he he comes back
[1:33:04] to the earth
[1:33:06] after the marriage supper and finishes
[1:33:08] that work
[1:33:11] right
[1:33:14] there's a redemption yet for israel and
[1:33:17] there's a redemption yet for us which is
[1:33:19] the change of the body
[1:33:21] which is him claiming us as the human
[1:33:24] beings we were meant to be
[1:33:31] now look maybe you haven't heard it put
[1:33:32] this way but just think it through
[1:33:34] and and you'll say yeah that's you know
[1:33:36] that's what brother branham taught now
[1:33:38] look
[1:33:40] now brother random says redemption has
[1:33:42] two different parts
[1:33:44] think about this as we close he said
[1:33:46] come out of and
[1:33:48] entering into first you have to come out
[1:33:51] some people wants to bring the world in
[1:33:53] with them but you've got to come out of
[1:33:55] the world to enter into christ
[1:33:57] you have to have both parts you can't
[1:34:00] have one without the other and that's
[1:34:01] why we still preach coming out
[1:34:04] and going in too for most of us
[1:34:07] we're preaching going in too
[1:34:11] right because if i preach coming out
[1:34:12] every service come out of the world come
[1:34:14] out of the world come out of the world
[1:34:15] you've already left the world most of
[1:34:18] you
[1:34:20] huh but there's children here there's
[1:34:22] others that will sit among us
[1:34:23] that need to come out right
[1:34:26] that's the first part of redemption
[1:34:28] first you have to come out some people
[1:34:29] wants to bring the world in with them
[1:34:30] you've got to come out of the world to
[1:34:32] enter into christ
[1:34:33] you have to come out of unbelief to
[1:34:35] enter into faith
[1:34:37] he said there cannot be one thing in
[1:34:39] your way
[1:34:40] to really have genuine faith you must
[1:34:42] absolutely leave
[1:34:44] everything that's contrary to the word
[1:34:46] of god behind
[1:34:47] to enter into faith ponder that for a
[1:34:50] moment
[1:34:52] you're not going to get that at the
[1:34:53] baptist church i'm sorry
[1:34:55] they can tell you what the word says
[1:34:56] what the king james version meant some
[1:34:58] of them used the king james version i
[1:34:59] can tell you what that says
[1:35:00] but listen what a prophet of god said
[1:35:02] you're going to have to leave everything
[1:35:04] behind to enter into faith
[1:35:06] hallelujah oh where should we be living
[1:35:09] church
[1:35:11] that's a message of coming in too look
[1:35:13] he said that was the book
[1:35:14] of the ephesians of the old testament
[1:35:17] joshua
[1:35:18] he said where moses represented the law
[1:35:21] could not save no one
[1:35:23] but grace could and here joshua is the
[1:35:26] same word like jesus
[1:35:28] jehovah's savior amen now you go
[1:35:32] into that you look at the type of joshua
[1:35:34] you could say joshua is a type of the
[1:35:35] holy ghost
[1:35:37] right brother branham also said joshua
[1:35:39] was
[1:35:40] was his ministry right he said that
[1:35:44] he said we'll be like caleb
[1:35:48] that's what i want to be everybody wants
[1:35:51] to be the joshua that brings the people
[1:35:52] in but the message of entering in was
[1:35:54] already preached
[1:35:57] it's true the message of entering in and
[1:36:00] that's why every little
[1:36:01] excuse expression tom dick and harry
[1:36:03] that gets up and wants to
[1:36:05] proclaim themselves the man who's going
[1:36:07] to be joshua and take you into the deep
[1:36:09] things of god
[1:36:10] most of the time all they'll make is a
[1:36:11] mess
[1:36:14] because they don't stay with the joshua
[1:36:15] of the hour the holy spirit always goes
[1:36:17] back to the message of the hour
[1:36:20] right it's not going to take you down
[1:36:21] some some road and i've experienced that
[1:36:24] in my life most of the places
[1:36:26] where people thought we have a special
[1:36:27] revelation what they have is confusion
[1:36:31] which is even anti-word and i say let's
[1:36:34] let's come out of that it's time to come
[1:36:36] out of that and go
[1:36:38] in to the truth of the message of the
[1:36:39] hour
[1:36:41] which has already been preached to us
[1:36:43] and yet like i said we dig into these
[1:36:44] things and we understand them in a way
[1:36:46] that they didn't back there
[1:36:48] why because we have that opportunity we
[1:36:50] should use it
[1:36:52] right and there's revelation i believe
[1:36:54] that still comes to you personally
[1:36:56] but we're not going to have another
[1:36:57] prophet or another word or another
[1:36:58] preacher
[1:36:59] come and say well i'm going to take you
[1:37:00] in we've already had that ministry
[1:37:03] and we're going in hallelujah i don't
[1:37:06] know about you
[1:37:07] i'm not waiting on somebody to come and
[1:37:09] take me into the land
[1:37:10] i'm going into the land right now in
[1:37:13] fact i'm looking around it right now and
[1:37:14] seeing how good it is and what the
[1:37:16] grapes look like and everything else
[1:37:18] i know what it looks like hey man it's
[1:37:21] been described to me and i know what it
[1:37:22] looks like and what it is
[1:37:25] hey man musicians go ahead and come i
[1:37:28] went three minutes over tonight i'm
[1:37:31] better than usual look
[1:37:34] i won't tell you what over what but
[1:37:39] now look
[1:37:42] brother branham says it now he said that
[1:37:45] here joshua the same word like jesus
[1:37:47] jehovah's savior
[1:37:48] and now then we find out that we have to
[1:37:51] come to another ephesians
[1:37:53] another ephesus now
[1:37:58] another ephesus now another ephesians
[1:38:02] where that in our intellectual
[1:38:04] denominations
[1:38:06] whether they're message denominations or
[1:38:08] baptist denominations or
[1:38:10] pentecostal denominations in our
[1:38:12] intellectual denominations and so forth
[1:38:14] and all of our educational programs has
[1:38:18] come to its jordan
[1:38:20] amen it can't cross over into the land
[1:38:24] our intellectual denominations our
[1:38:26] educational programs
[1:38:28] has come to its jordan then we must have
[1:38:30] an ephesians again
[1:38:32] we must have an exodus to come out and
[1:38:35] to go into
[1:38:36] for the rapture we must have an exodus
[1:38:41] to come out and to go into
[1:38:44] for the rapture what does brother
[1:38:46] branham call that the claiming time
[1:38:49] the lamb has the book in his hand and he
[1:38:52] comes to claim what he's redeemed now
[1:38:53] that won't be finished
[1:38:55] you got to be careful with that because
[1:38:56] people say well that means mercy's over
[1:38:58] no
[1:38:58] he won't be finished with his claiming
[1:39:00] work until
[1:39:02] every last seed
[1:39:05] has been expressed on the earth has come
[1:39:07] you understand but the remember
[1:39:08] when that last one comes in but this is
[1:39:11] that
[1:39:11] hour and that's why you have to see the
[1:39:15] opening of the word
[1:39:16] or you can't go in
[1:39:20] right you have to see the opening lord
[1:39:22] you have to understand that the book is
[1:39:24] open or you can't go in
[1:39:27] because you'll never you you don't know
[1:39:29] what to go into
[1:39:31] you're waiting on somebody else to come
[1:39:33] and lead you into the land
[1:39:34] when joshua already went in so you stop
[1:39:37] at kadesh barnea and fight and fuss and
[1:39:39] everything
[1:39:40] else instead of going in
[1:39:43] we're going in now we've been talking
[1:39:45] about going in for a long time
[1:39:47] but you know what it may take a long
[1:39:49] time
[1:39:50] but we're going in we may walk each one
[1:39:54] of us our own path but we're going in
[1:39:58] look he walks out to claim his subjects
[1:40:00] that's what the breach is about
[1:40:02] he walks out to claim his subjects but
[1:40:04] who does the lamb does
[1:40:06] the lamb at the end time amen
[1:40:10] then if he claims us now what has he
[1:40:12] done and by the message of the hour he's
[1:40:14] claimed our souls
[1:40:15] by the message of the hour that's why
[1:40:17] brother joe how could you leave the
[1:40:18] message if you've been claimed to buy it
[1:40:22] right you can't leave it if it's
[1:40:25] something that has claimed you
[1:40:27] you didn't claim it you can claim the
[1:40:29] message
[1:40:30] and leave it but you can't be claimed by
[1:40:32] the message of the hour
[1:40:34] and leave it you might try to run but
[1:40:37] you can't hide
[1:40:40] you may fall flat on your face but you
[1:40:42] got to get back up
[1:40:44] and i'd rather see somebody that fell
[1:40:46] flat multiple times and got back up
[1:40:48] because they've been claimed
[1:40:52] and somebody just lived out of it right
[1:40:55] they just lived out of it they
[1:40:56] they say oh i believe in a prophet i
[1:40:58] believe oh come out of her my people but
[1:41:00] did you go in
[1:41:02] to the claiming work because if you
[1:41:04] don't see the opening of the word you
[1:41:06] don't know what to go into
[1:41:07] and you're waiting on something to
[1:41:09] happen brother say we must have an
[1:41:10] exodus
[1:41:11] to come out and to go into for the
[1:41:12] rapture and i'm here to tell you
[1:41:14] that that's what this message is all
[1:41:16] about aren't you glad that we still have
[1:41:19] that promise we still have that message
[1:41:22] today do you believe it tonight
[1:41:24] amen do you love him is he exalted in
[1:41:27] your hearts
[1:41:28] is he exalted in your thoughts
[1:41:32] he holds everything together
[1:41:35] and if he's that powerful then if he's
[1:41:38] continuing his work
[1:41:39] it didn't stop in 1963 he wasn't done
[1:41:44] amen the son of man a son of man came to
[1:41:47] reveal the son of man a son of man went
[1:41:49] off the face of the earth but the son of
[1:41:51] man is still here
[1:41:52] that's why we can say the pillar of fire
[1:41:54] is still here because the son of man is
[1:41:56] still here
[1:41:57] the pillar of fire is still here the
[1:41:58] word is still here the holy ghost is
[1:42:00] still here
[1:42:01] christ came for you
[1:42:05] amen one day he's going to claim these
[1:42:07] bodies
[1:42:09] if he claims your soul by the message of
[1:42:11] the hour one day
[1:42:12] he's going to claim your body doesn't
[1:42:13] that give you confidence
[1:42:15] doesn't that make you feel like you can
[1:42:16] run through a troop and jump over a wall
[1:42:19] because it doesn't matter what's going
[1:42:21] on he that is in me has already claimed
[1:42:24] my soul he's already done the work my
[1:42:27] kinsmen redeemer i'm just going to lay
[1:42:28] at his feet
[1:42:30] amen amen do you love him
