Lord needing you to come and speak to us Lord and Lord we've gathered here in the in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we believe you're here we believe your holy spirit is here Lord won't you just have your way here today Lord may we just set aside uh the things of the week Lord and Lord may you just come and move Among Us Lord Lord be in everything that's said and done Lord and we certainly feel your presence here so Lord we just want to even while we're here just enter into the service and just make you welcome Lord and wash your feet Lord and Lord respond to your word Lord you know what we have need of Lord I'm I'm insufficient here this morning but Lord you're you're the almighty this morning we just give you this service May Lord you just have all the glory may you have preeminence here today do what you want to do Lord and just shut my mouth Lord to what you would have me not say but Lord open it up this morning we pray we love you we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen you love the Lord this morning amen let's just turn the scriptures to First John 2 and 14 just kind of a privilege to be here to speak this morning and it's been a little bit so we'll just try to try to get back in the groove here this morning just kind of pick up a thought that we had uh a while back just still kind of um looking at worship under Redemption and just the thought that I that I had of of rejecting and then overcoming the LIE of the devil amen 1 John 2 and4 I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning and I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one amen it says here love not the world neither the things of the world that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen you could be seated this morning just pray that God would add His blessings to his word here today brother random said he said what is a lie it's the truth misre presented it's a perversion of what is true right right yes and so amen we've been called to be Overcomers in this age and and the word the word here says that they had overcome the wicked one the word of God uh uh was abiding in them and they were strong and that they had overcome the wicked one amen and and when the word is in you that's where your strength comes from yes amen minute and that's what it takes to overcome the world that's what it takes to to overcome daily struggles and it takes not just just taking uh a scripture though though that's that's that's part of it but that that's something that word has to be in you come on Amen you have to be a part of the word or you can never really fully benefit you can never really take it and use it the way you're supposed to and that's the purpose of of being borned again because this old nature will never overcome the world so this old Nature has to die out and me there has to be a birth that takes place it's a word birth and me the word has to abide in you it's not just something that you read and something that you can intellectually understand amen but you are a part of the word because you're born again and so this world Amen love not the world nor the things of the world if you love it the love of the father is not not in you amen there has to be a love for the truth there has to be a love for the things of God can you say am man it has to be it has to be greater than than this world and and the things that it offers and you look at you look at this world and the confusion that it's in and so the word takes away the confusion the word takes away the error it takes away amen any any doubt any unbelief amen it takes away that confusion that that this world is in this present world that we're in amen that's good so you you have to be you have to be changed you have to be there has to be something that takes place to be able to overcome the world because we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity and and then the Bible says that we come into the world speaking lies right so there has to be something Amen to that that overrules amen where where we would speak lies where we would speak negative amen the word has to take place amen that it can come forth amen and give us the victory because faith is the victory that overcomes the world Amen you're a new creation the old things are passed away and all things are become new that that's what it takes to overcome the LIE of the devil this old nature that we were borned in we didn't have no say in it come on and brother said we we read that quote that that Adam sold us out yeah Adam sold us out and we were in the pawn shell but but it took Christ to come and redeem us amen so so that that Redemption has to take place you come here you you were born in sin there's nothing you could do about it but God has made a way for us to have the victory here today I believe that I don't believe we have to succumb to the to the confusion of lead DEA I don't believe we have to live Amen in a state of mind where we don't we don't know who we are but the word has come there's a birth that can take place and if you'll just surrender to it amen don't go on don't go on in this life trying to do it yourself you'll never have victory in this life unless that word Birth has taken place good so we look at Jesus Jesus overcame by the word and we we've been kind of looking at that that Redemption is bringing us at what Adam and Eve fell from Redemption is bringing us back to the position that they fell from but we see here Jesus overcame by the word and brother Ram says here he says Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word she was fortified Satan came but she failed to use the word the fortification that God gave her and so Adam not being deceived in the transgression stepped out he fell in direct Disobedience to the the word he stepped out right so God wouldn't destroy Eve he took her sin upon himself he was not deceived he was a Son of God but Jesus overcame by the word and he says and right now let me say that is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way to know that you are overcoming because the word Can't Fail amen heavens and earth will pass away amen our ideas our doctrines and our our good Solutions and amen and and and our our best efforts it's going to pass away but if you'll take the word if you'll take it in your heart amen and you'll bind it amen and and let it not forsake you amen but you'll take that word amen it will conquer every enemy here today good so we're being under Redemption we're going back we're being restored back we're being redeemed back Amen to our original position ad Adam and Eve disfellowship themselves by the believing the LIE of the devil right they separated themselves from their Union with God they were in a position to never die yeah right to never be sick to never have to worry amen but under Redemption don't make me just amen myself here today okay and you're not I'm just Lord help me they were in a position to never die never be sick never have to worry but under Redemption under the fullness of the word amen we are restored to our position by an atoning bleeding word you have an atonement this morning and that word atonement means to make you one again there's something that that destroyed that cm it's not just a blood of a of a of a natural lamb but there's a bleeding word here today there's a bleeding word that's been made available Amen to make you and God want again to restore that Union that Fellowship back if you can reject the LIE of the devil here today don't let him put nothing on you don't let him don't let him take away the effect of the word today amen don't don't don't con let your mind be consumed with with the confusion and the thoughts of this world that he would try to inject because there is a word here today and you'll surrender to it not to a man not to a preacher amen but if you'll respond to the presence of God here today as the word Goes Forth amen you can you can be changed amen we can say Amen though those that have been born again you knew you couldn't do it on your own you knew you tried but when you surrendered when you surrendered Amen to what you knew was right and thank God there was a there's been some men of God that's put forth the word of God Amen that's preached salvation amen correctly let's preach amen the message of the hour amen and and and and not try to interpret it themselves amen because that's what it's going to take amen we we don't want no water down amen man interpreted gospel message amen but God has given us amen a message amen a revealed word sir Lord help me to keep my voice here today amen he's given us a word that will correct every error that will remove the LIE of the enemy off your life right to bring us back amen and so just as that Eve we've said this before just as that Eve was predestinated to fall there's a bride here today that will take the word that will surrender to everything that God has for her me because she is predestinated to stand predestinated to not fall amen and take what the word says reject the LIE of the devil yes cuz he's going to try to put something on you he going to try to put whatever he can upon your life yeah right to try to if he can just cause you to doubt just a little bit he just wants you to disbelieve just one little bit and then and then he's not going to stop there if he can cause you doubt just a little bit he'll consume you with doubt he'll consume you with unbelief but the objective is is to stay fortified behind the word to stay stay in your position we've been brought back we've been brought back under the revealed word amen we're not we're not walking in darkness we're not walking in confusion amen but there's been a voice to call us out of that confusion come out of the world come out of her my people and I say this morning amen we're we're not just listening to the voice of brother brandom when you hear that voice that is God speaking to you you've got to look Beyond the Veil of that man you got to look Beyond the Veil of brother Joel amen because there's a word here and if we can enter in behind the veil amen remove the skin if you can look past amen the man the flesh that's here today and look at the word amen you can enter into that presence where you can be changed in the Shana glory of God in the Holy presence of God good preach in there it will remove death the death that caused was caused from the fall amen it will remove the the confusion cuz in that place is light in that secret place amen it's just you and God than you Lord all other voices are bed out every every voice of Satan every devil every imp everything that he would try to put on you in that place if you can come into that place into that Fellowship that God has given us takes away the confusion right Hallelujah just a maybe just a little bit different direction here John 8 and 12 8 and 12 let's look at this just for a little bit then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life the Pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself that record is not true so they're basically they're calling Jesus a liar but Jesus answered and said then though I bear record of myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and with I go but ye cannot tell whence I came and whether I go ye judge after the flesh I judge no manen and yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I am the father that sent me it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true I am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me and they said unto him where is thy father and Jesus answered ye need neither known me nor my father if you had known me you should have known my father also so they had just they had just brought a woman caught in in the very Act of adultery to him right always trying to get Jesus to slip up always trying trying to work him up on who is your father right and and and they had brought to him this woman saying Master the law of Moses commands us that she should be Stone what sayth thou always trying to catch him right and under religious spirit they did this to tempt Jesus that they might have accusation against him and he stooped down and he rode in the sand as though he heard him not yeah and they continued to ask him and he stood upon his feet and he said he that is without sin Let Him cast the first stone at her and then being convicted the Bible says from the from the eldest to the youngest they begin to leave one by one and then Jesus asked the woman where are your accusers yeah all right where are your accusers where is he that condemns thee see they had brought her under the law of Moses but they had brought her to the one that was the law of Moses amen under Moses law was condemnation you never got delivered from your sin but in him Jesus all right in him Jesus was forgiveness and life and the power to change a person from a life of sin and the per version of the LIE of the Devil in him was the power of redemption in him in this man was the ability greater than the law but in this man was the ability to fulfill the law to pay to pay the price of redemption amen thank you Lord he told the woman don't go on and and do the same thing you did again but go you're forgiven you're going sin no more amen amen but here the the Pharisees are calling Jesus a liar always trying to get him riled up always trying to trying to get him and that's what the devil does he's trying to bring out the worst in you but just stay in your position stay in your position know who you are know why you're here they calling Jesus a liar that his record what he was bearing witness of wasn't true and that which he was bearing witness of was that he was the light of the world and that he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of light he said though I bear record of myself my record is true I like what he said there he said he said I know from whence I came and whether I go and if you look at that there from whence he says it means from where from what how and why so he's saying I know where I came from I know I know what I came from you asked me who my father was and I I'm not moved by that I know who I am I know I know where I came from I know why I'm here I know my purpose I know my how and my why amen because see Jesus had a perfect Faith he wasn't moved yes all right he knew where he was going Jesus was not confused but he knew what he believed and that's what it takes for the bride in this time of deception Amen in this time of darkness in this time of confusion Satan will try to get you to doubt this morning who you are he'll try to get you to doubt amen that why why did God bring God bring you to this message you can't live it you can't produce it but yet God has identified himself here today with you and I say we're still here we're still here Satan we're still here you you you haven't shaken us off yet we've been through hell we've been through this and we've been through that we're still here but he'll try to get you to turn back he'll try to get you to doubt and that's when you got to be as sure as Jesus was amen you got to know in whom you have believed you've got to know what's right you've got to understand who you are you've got to understand what you believe amen that's I believe we do here today don't let Satan talk you off of it amen that's good know what the scripture says about you amen and we've been identified with a message and not just not just we're walking along and we're identified I believe the message but the message came to you that's right that's the message came identified itself to you it bypassed certain ones it bypassed great people and it came to the lowly such as you and I we're nothing here today but God came and identified himself with the with us with with the truth amen that's right that we could overcome the lie that's good I know this is a little different here today so brother Ram says here he said but when Jesus when he was born he was born with that Mark of being an illegitimate child and that his father was Joseph and that he was born in other words a bastard child born of a father by a mother which he was conceived before they were married and they would ask him where's your father throwing it up at him but see Jesus had dealt with this lie about him ever since he was a child amen he had dealt with us his whole life that's right brother Brown says here he says look at Jesus they said away with that guy we know he's a Samaritan he's crazy will you teach us will you show us who the father is you was born in adultery you wasn't nothing but an illegitimate child to come who's your daddy you say God's your father you blasphemer while you mean to tell us we've been preachers we've been Bishops our great great grandfathers was preachers and Bishops we were born and raised in the church we've been through the highest of seminaries we know every word to the letter and you try to teach us where did you ever go to school at where did you get this learning that's right and Jesus would tell him said why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word and he said ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father will you do and he was a murderer from the beginning and a bold not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and you look these men these men were were clean men you couldn't put a finger on their lives they could trace their lineage all the way back to Abraham their lives were without blemish but Jesus told them you are of your father the devil because you cannot accept me because you cannot recognize who I am and brother R says why he said because they couldn't see the message the word was right there right there in front of them but they rejected him on it was right there there before him 2 Corinthians 4 said but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost that's right in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves for your ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ aren't you thankful this morning that the gospel has not been hid to you and I aren't you thankful this morning that you can accept the word for your hour amen that you have been not ordained to condemnation but you have been ordained to life this morning amen there's a difference this morning and you and the rest of the world there's a difference here this morning amen God come in this hour He restored truths back to us not so we would just have doctrines but that you would know amen you would know who Satan is you would know who the serpent was you would know the difference between the church and the bride and this morning I I believe we're identified as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen don't sell yourself

this world with a black name as an illegitimate child did you know that supposed to be born a child out of wedlock Jesus had had that hanging on him so he he dealt with this lie he dealt with with this his entire life right but in his heart he knew that he was the son of God and there's power this morning and identification there's power this morning Amen in realizing who you are as a Son of God as a daughter of God amen amen there's power in that this morning and he says here and men and women you know where you stand tonight there's there's only one more person that knows it that's God

thick skin we can handle it we can overcome this thing we can overcome the world our children can overcome the world they can we can overcome the criticism of the devil that that comes along with believing this message we can overcome that and we're going to overcome that amen just walk with Jesus just walk with the word Matthew 5:11 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake prise the Lord amen we're standing for the word of the hour amen we're standing the message is Christ amen the message is it's the person of Jesus Christ it's not the idea of William brandham but we're standing here William brandom's been gone off the scene for how many years but there's still a bride here amen you are the Vindication that that message was true because it produced a bride It produced a bleeding word bride that's willing to come and be born again to willing to to accept that in their heart that which would would take to overcome this world thank you Lord amen that's who I'm identified with here today today amen amen amen we're willing to be looked down upon yes yes sir sure I'm willing yes sir I'm not moving I'm not backing up I'm not I'm not renouncing anything there you go if you can come and show me from the scripture anything that this message teaches if you can show me in the scripture where you're right and where it's wrong but I'll say you can't do it it's not there and that's the confidence I have in the word here today that's the confidence I have in what was brought to you and I that if we're not moving we're not backing up we're not renouncing nothing but we're going to stand upon the word we're not going to let Satan have one inch yes sir we're willing to be looked down upon you're going to lose opportunity in this life you're going to lose status you're not going to fit in that's right you're not going to fit in but I'm not I'm not looking to hidden in the world I'm looking to to be accepted here I'm I'm looking to be accepted in the Beloved amen among his people amen amen there's no greater place there's no other place that I can think of this morning let's just enter in there's no other place this morning if you're a true believer that you'd rather be than in the house of God fellowshipping with Believers of like Precious Faith there's no other place and we can think that yeah I'd like to be doing this and I'd like to be doing that but when you get here yeah is we're so happy we're so happy and it's not a show but we're here to to love our lord Jesus we're here to Amen to to amen his word we're here to get behind amen the things of God that's right wonderful amen hallelujah powerful yes sir you're going to lose opportunity status in this life but I'd rather walk with Jesus amen amen Jesus said if you stand for me I'll stand for you that's right and mean there's a gospel here there's a gospel if you'll not be ashamed of it that will bring you out of darkness and bring you into the light that's good and know take the confusion away or take the the muddiness away of Satan and his lies and everything that he's ingrained in humanity all up until this point in the Satan's Eden he's he created his perfect Eden amen but there's a people here that's standing amen yeah so Jesus constantly had to deal with the marks and the claims and the black the black marks all the way from the child even to his death he had to deal with it that's true when he was a child Mary and Joseph went off without him when they found him teaching and confounding the leaders of that day amen by the things that he taught Mary said I and your father have sought thee with tears and him being the word corrected the error he said I must be about my father's business where he was the Virgin born son of God Jesus rejected the idea of him not being the word yes we've got to do the same thing when he was led away in the wilderness to be tempted the tempter came and said if thou be the Son of God he knew who he was but he he threw that doubt of if thou be the Son of God turn these stones to breath Satan tried to make him question who he was and at the same time knew who he was and tried to get him to display his power to should create bread but Jesus didn't buy it that's right he didn't he didn't take the bait and that's what we've got to do as Sons and Daughters of God don't take the bait don't take the bait when Satan you know something's working against you don't take the bait just stand there amen with a love of God in your heart stand there amen what thus sayith the Lord he said every man shall man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God even when Jesus was was on the cross that same devil that if thou be the Son of God come off the cross that's so from all the way from from a child up until he died yeah he dealt with that that death if thou be who's your father where did you come from who who really is your father prise Lord but I I'd like to I'd like to throw this in here that what what Jesus what he battled his entire life and what he rejected he took to hell with him and there he defeated death hell in the grave and Satan said I thought I had you when I got Abel he said I thought I had you when I got Jeremiah when I got this one and when I got John the Baptist he said I thought I had you but now I've got you but Jesus there amen knew who his father was he said I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God and I'm here to take your Dominion away I'm here to take the keys of death and hell I'm here to take that away amen there's a there's a demon now there's a devil that devil that taunts you that devil that talks to you he ain't nothing but a bluff he ain't even got the keys to his own house my Lord Jesus went and defeated him amen he didn't let the LIE the devil hold him back amen but he took that very thing there he was accused of that he was blackened by all the way to the Grave that's right and overcome Satan with it overcome the grave with it thank you Lord amen glory glory it couldn't hold him down it couldn't hold him down and there's a Rapture there's a Rapture word in this hour there's a Rapture word in this hour that we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those that are asleep well we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye wonderful amen we're going to overcome this world we're going to overcome death we're going to cheat death God we're going back we're going back to an Eden to a millenum thank this whole world's going to pass away yes wonderful I got about 11 more pages yes sir Jesus knew who he was he knew his position and he had faith in who he was perfect faith brother brother Bram says now the only thing you have to do then is is have faith in in what you are have faith in what the word says you are that's so simple isn't it but that being in its Simplicity that's what it takes it's not something great it's not something it's it's so simple that a a child can understand it right yes just take the word in faith take what the word says you are yeah Jesus had faith in the word of God he said he said I am the bread of life yes that come from God out of Heaven I am the tree of life that was in the garden of Edom I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said I I do nothing in myself but it's my faith in God Amen thank he had power within himself to to call 10,000 angels to come off the cross but he had to fulfill what God what the father had for him Jesus understood his position in the scripture he knew his place he understood his why he understood his his how and is why and and where he came from and where he was going right yes he goes on in perfect Faith here I love that message perfect Faith there's so much in it and he says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in in Christ he said now you're getting in the bride material you're getting in the rapturing condition now that means for each one of us now not just the pastor trusty deacons that means for the Ley for every individual that walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God Amen thank he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt anywhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you go right on just the same he said now you're coming to a perfect Faith amen that's brde material in this hour I wish I could say I was there I'm trying amen we see it yeah I want to be there but we've got some dying to do we' got some dying out to do right we got some of us got a long way to go in a short time to get there right but we've got to overcome we've got to overcome the spirit of this age and what the spirit of this age is brother brandom say it it cause causes an indifference it causes a cold and a formal spirit and that's what the spirit of this age is but I say there's a people on this Earth that's going to discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit because that Spirit that's what that is that Antichrist spirit is a cold it's a formal it's against the word and what it's trying to do it will try to creep into your life it will try to creep into my life because it don't want you to go in Rapture it wants you to stay here and be destroyed like everybody else amen but there's a bride there's a people on this Earth amen amen she's an invincible Army if she and she'll realize who she is and she will discern and withstand the very Antichrist Spirit that's good that's of this age don't let the formality come in these walls don't let an indifferent Spirit come in your heart and in your home but let's be on fire for God let let's let's not be the statures where we we're not movable we can't move at all with the spirit of God we can't bend we can't sway but let's be movable by the spirit of God Amen yes sir let's just not just sit in the same old place we were wonderful he gives the orders and you pack them out yes oh my that's good we complain and we can't do it and I don't want to do it and what I say about every time I go preach I don't want to do this yes good amen but we we got to we got to do we got to be about the father's business and that that's what the difference is a real real believer somebody's got perfect Faith yeah in a perfect word yeah they just want to do what father says yes so you don't take you don't take what anybody else says nobody can nobody can talk you out of the world can't talk youve got a perfect Faith he goes on here he says we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us now to resist the devil is just simply turn him down resist resist him is that just walk away from it God said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you see reject we got to reject the LIE of the devil you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says let us be there let us discern and withstand every every attack of the enemy amen yeah that's good yes sir Jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth right yes he goes on in the church ages here he said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father he said that Harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her what his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the sea be planted the water will raise it up again and he said here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord now I didn't come up with that but a Prophet come up with that that she has thus said the Lord as the word was in Mary so is it in her her so when the angel came to Mary the angel came with the message and the message wasn't just for the angel but the message was to Mary that she would receive that word and produce that word and it doesn't it won't come in a doubting heart but it's got to coming a prepared people it's got to be coming coming a a a a virgin virgin bride yes it can't be muddled up with the world it can't be in the confusion of the world but to to accept that word amen as marriage we've got to be clean we've got to be set aside right we've got to have the heart that says be it unto me according to Thy word it didn't just stay with the angel the angel spoke it a prophet came in this day Angel messenger came in his day the message wasn't for him just for him but it was to a bride from the throne from from the mind of God to a bride to accept amen and take that word and stand on thus sayith the Lord Lord amen amen we have thus sayith the Lord this morning or we keep still that's wonderful yes he goes on he did not complete all his his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for she was for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that which he left for this specific time amen do you believe that amen you believe you got something to do you believe that you're not just floating along am that you're not just coming to church is that what if that's what we're doing we're not fulfilling the word if we're just floating no long brother Matt McGary talked about that when he was preaching are we just going to work and and and doing everyday normal things and just dragging along or do we have a purpose and that purpose amen God has placed specifically upon this bride that she will be the word that she will be the bride that doesn't fall the bride that stands there behind thus sayith the Lord amen amen that's good John 8:31 then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so what corrects the error the truth has to come I mean the the truth comes and then the error the comes and tries to twist that but it takes the truth coming back the truth coming back amen maybe even more of the truth and greater truth right not just a Luther message not just a Wesley message not just a a restoration of the gifts amen but a fullness of the word a fullness of the word for the fullness of times for the end time amen amen in a time of the fullness of redemption amen not we haven't just received a partial word just just a little bit but the error and the confusion and the sin and and and and the the Demonic forces that have been released we couldn't just do it on the message of Luther on on the message of Wesley but we had to have a restored word we had to have something amen that would bring us to the fullness of [Applause] redemption amen God's not going to leave us here he's not going to leave us behind amen he he he didn't just give us amen just just just a little bit he gave us his best in this hour and we've got to follow after that and that truth if you'll follow it'll make you free amen and that word make free means to to deliver to make free to set at deliver Del uh set at Liberty from the Dominion of sin we have to continue in his word to be disciples after him to follow what his word tells us and we can't pick and choose what we think is right and cherry-pick this and that and and say well I'm I'm going to follow this brother CU he preaches this Doctrine and it really tickles my ears and does this amen that that ain't bride material amen it takes a it takes a Full Gospel it takes a full counsel of God Amen that that a soul can be delivered amen if somebody's giv you an old water down version it ain't going to do you no good amen well we need the full counsel of God amen amen to bring us out of this mess amen amen to bring us to the fullness of redemption God sent us a messenger and a message of Vindicated word amen and the word has been open to us and but we've got to take the book and we've got to eat it we've got to receive it and only the predestinated will be able to do that don't let the message of the hour just be something that we skim over oh listen a life story I'll I'll listen to the my favorite message that backs up what I believe amen let's dive into it let's partake of it and what it does it points us back to Christ it points points us back to the one amen that that overcomes through US Amen brother renam goes on to say here he says and the world is falling apart people won't believe it churches won't believe it no wonder you can't be disappointed in it because the Bible said they wouldn't do it but it's individuals you that's ordained to life look upon the fields now and see what hour we're living in come to life let the life that was in Christ comeing you the mind you said oh I think this and I think that he said you ain't got no thought coming let the thoughts that was in Christ be in you and that's the word that's right think the thoughts that he thought amen there's got to be a re a people that receive the whole word of God there's got to be a people amen that lean not under their own understanding but they reject the LIE of the devil you can't you can't just cherry pick what you want all right we've got to take every bit of it I've got to take what what it takes to to produce a real Son of God right not just a good church member I pay my ti I come I raise my hands I play the drums I preach every now and then but you've got to take something that will build you into the stature into the image of Christ amen I'll try to try to skip some of this so Satan Satan by his wisdom caused Eve to break down the barrier caused her to come out from behind what she was fortified and Satan Satan admitted that the word was right but just one little bit right surely you won't die and that was a loophole and that's how he got Eve out with one little doubt see that's Satan's purpose is to to cause doubt and unbelief and when she fell she lost her position she lost her fortification and Satan only misconstrued one word he caused one little doubt and since then Satan has had his bluff he he's had his bluff on us right just one more time lord and the devil put you in the pawn shot but Jesus came and redeemed you open up the doors and the only thing you have to do is walk out and claim your Liberty amen that's all you have a receipt from God that the Deb is paid Jesus said in his last words it's finished take this in this morning every Redemptive blessing is yours every Redemptive blessing is yours everything that God has is yours I I skipped up here we'll go on repeat till we get there I'm sorry I got my keyboard here you know I can't get it to go away and I don't want to mess with it too much or winding down here winding down every Redemptive blessing was completely finished God's Great wrath on sin when he became sin for us it was the debt was settled Satan has no more power only he can Bluff with it if he can Bluff you into it all right you'll have to you'll have to take it but legally he has no power at all every Power he had has been taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he's nothing but a bluff if you if you want to listen to him if you want to listen to is Li will all right he says but you don't have to you are free today he has made you free see Satan wants you to stay where you're at he doesn't want you to move he he would be satisfied with you just being a good old church member amen but and he he would try to get you to cause and live in unbelief and try to tell you that you're not good enough he'll try to tell you that it's not for you but at this morning you can catch a vision of what Jesus done at Calvary and me if you can catch a visionen where he said it is finished everything amen everything that he tried to Bluff them out of amen he can no longer do it I've restored I've redeemed them back to that and everything is laying in your hands this morning there's a redeeming Power by that blood that was spilled on that day on Calvary there's a Redeeming Grace amen there's a redeeming blessing sir we give the devil too much hold over us all right well let the word put you back in your position today amen the devil's finished Jesus said it's finished I like to think of it like this the devil you're finished you're finished devil it's over it's over brother wend I wish he was here to sing that song devil it's over we're through yes it's finished you ain't got no more Bluff on me all right amen believe that for yourself this morning Satan is a liar Satan is a liar and if he's in your mind if he's telling you things he's wanting to hold you back he's trying to get you to move out but recognize that I want to read you just a few more quotes here and we'll close okay brother Brown says here he said now Satan you who are hanging around here with a question mark across the word of God you're exposed God has revealed you told you WR out who you are and what you are and you're a liar and the father of it and as the Church of God is one of the members of that church as are borned Again by the Holy Spirit and by being called in this world to be a prophet and these people have confessed Jesus Christ as their healer and as interceding as a a priest standing between the living and the dead I say in the name of Jesus Christ I break your powers and leave this building in the name of Jesus Christ turn every one of them loose come out of them Satan leave them don't let him Bluff you this morning he's a liar he said now here's a dark Street coming from a woman to another one what is it it's a devil he knows his time has come the woman here you're extremely nervous aren't you lady just hysterically nervous I see you trying to do things and you just can't do it you're just nervous a mental nervous Satan has told you you were going to lose your mind if you didn't go get over it but he has lied to you he's lied to you this morning church again you're nervous aren't you sister you you can't just hold yourself together at times sometimes you think you'd almost take your own life you wonder what it's going going to happen and you're in a religious experience and so forth you've never been satisfied just exactly you've always wondered is that right and you've wanted a closer walk with him and then sometimes Satan has told you just recently when you're in the room by yourself you cross the line and I'm not reading your mind but that's true isn't it he lied to you sister you're healed now you don't have to he said go Rejoice him and God May that demon curse that's been on this child come out out and leave and may she be filled with your spirit in the name of Jesus he goes on to say the devil is nothing but a bluff anyhow he's snorting and blowing and thundering and no lightning but I tell you brother the lightning power of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality in there that shocks the soul from a dead Slumber in these Earthly bounds into the immortal Realms to believe God and take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they were amen Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb called out set aside tonight amen what's he coming for God help us to get our faith in the right place amen he says Satan you're defeated you're a liar as a servant of God as servants we command you in the name of Jesus Christ that you obey the word of God and go out of the people because it's written in my name they shall cast out Devils amen let every devil flee from us this this morning every demon of Doubt every demon of unbelief amen you stand this morning you love the Lord the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony but what is he he's an accuser he's a
