[45:14] John chapter 6 and verse 9 I'm going to
[45:17] take a break from our Series tonight and
[45:19] just something that was on my heart
[45:20] something simple I guess I guess we need
[45:23] uh simpler topics I had a note little
[45:27] Post-it note on my desk uh posted to the
[45:31] front of the desk that said uh preach
[45:34] understandable
[45:39] words I'm not
[45:42] sure was that you brother Caleb oh it
[45:45] looks like a child's handwriting so
[45:46] whoever you are probably one of my
[45:49] children uh I want to try to do that
[45:52] tonight and uh I was going to do that
[45:54] even before I saw that note so
[45:57] I uh isn't God good to us we sure do
[46:00] want to understand don't we amen John 6
[46:05] and9 says there's a lad here which
[46:09] haveth five barley Loaves and two small
[46:14] fishes but what are
[46:16] they among so many pray the Lord would
[46:19] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[46:21] word you may be seated
[46:28] I want to title this
[46:30] tonight how did we get
[46:35] fed have you ever left a good meal and
[46:37] said how did that
[46:39] happen I don't think we think about it
[46:42] very much but uh some of us that don't
[46:45] cook all the meals at home we we don't
[46:48] always understand the process or how
[46:51] complicated it is to get food on the
[46:53] table and what went into that and and
[46:57] yet we benefit from it and sometimes you
[47:00] go away from a meal and you don't even
[47:02] think about where it came from but you
[47:04] just my was good I'm just so full that I
[47:09] just can't hardly stand
[47:11] it and John chapter 6 tells us about a
[47:14] time when Jesus fed 5,000 men and women
[47:21] and children that were there as well and
[47:23] he fed these with Five Loaves and two
[47:28] small
[47:30] fishes and they went away that day and
[47:34] they said how did we eat so
[47:37] good how did we get fed I think
[47:41] sometimes we leave church like that we
[47:44] sit there and we think well it wasn't a
[47:45] special meeting and it wasn't a great
[47:47] preacher but somehow we got fed and I
[47:50] left a fo that I just felt like that God
[47:53] was on my side and and whatever I had
[47:55] need of it was there for me and the the
[47:57] blessings of God were all around me and
[48:00] I just felt so good about that what was
[48:02] it it was the God was providing for us
[48:06] something we don't know how it happened
[48:08] now if you cook the food you know a
[48:10] little bit more how it happened you went
[48:13] to the store you bought the the canned
[48:15] biscuits and the gravy and the package
[48:17] and put them together and and uh you or
[48:21] or maybe you made it homemades you know
[48:23] and you you know how it happened you you
[48:26] you you made it you yourself or maybe
[48:28] you bought it or you went to the to the
[48:30] restaurant and you paid for it it
[48:32] reminds you of how it happen but but if
[48:36] you had no part in it these people had
[48:38] no part in it they said how did it
[48:40] happen this must be God yes they said
[48:44] the only thing we can say is that Jesus
[48:46] was there and I wonder how many times we
[48:49] leave the house of God like that and
[48:50] think the only thing I could say Jesus
[48:53] was there and I believe that he is the
[48:55] one who does it no matter how he works
[48:58] he is the one ultimately that's
[49:00] responsible if we get fed and they left
[49:03] there and said this must be that Prophet
[49:06] this must be the Messiah this must be
[49:08] the one that was spoken of this must be
[49:13] Christ so we find then that it happened
[49:18] it was a paradox and brother brandham
[49:20] taught us that a paradox is something
[49:22] incredible but
[49:24] true in other words almost can't be true
[49:28] you can't explain how it's true or why
[49:31] it's true it just happened right right
[49:35] and brother BR said it was a paradox
[49:37] when Jesus our lord took five biscuits
[49:39] and two little fish and broke them and
[49:41] fed 5,000 and taken up baskets full of
[49:44] remainings little Parcels that some of
[49:46] them didn't he said they'd lay four or
[49:48] five fish down at this table and four or
[49:51] five loaves of bread then they go over
[49:53] here and lay four or five loaves of
[49:55] bread some of them couldn't even e it
[49:57] all just left them laying there so they
[49:59] picked them up baskets full of them oh
[50:03] he said see how did he do it it's
[50:05] incredible that a man could take five
[50:08] biscuits and two little fishes and feed
[50:11] 5,000 and take up seven baskets full or
[50:14] in the other cases 12 baskets full left
[50:16] over it's incredible but he did it right
[50:20] you may not be able to explain it but he
[50:22] did it you may not be able to explain
[50:24] how he saved you but he did it glad he
[50:27] did it right sir but yet there were a
[50:30] lot of things that had to happen before
[50:34] Jesus could break the bread and a new
[50:36] loaf grow on
[50:38] it there was a lot of things that
[50:40] happened and many times in the service
[50:42] we don't always understand a lot of
[50:44] things happened before we got blessed
[50:48] before we got fed that maybe we didn't
[50:50] even recognize or even see and we don't
[50:53] think about but there's a lot that goes
[50:56] into it because God sets up predestined
[50:59] moments sometimes hours days months
[51:02] years in advance and he orchestrates
[51:06] people to be there and people why we
[51:08] should never take the house of God for
[51:10] granted we should always recognize that
[51:13] God meant for us to be there on that
[51:15] night and he meant for us to hear that
[51:17] message and he meant for us we we
[51:19] believe he's big enough to do that yet
[51:22] we don't see what all goes into the
[51:24] Providence of God I hope that word's not
[51:26] too big for you you we don't see what
[51:28] all he plans and what all he works out
[51:30] but it's that that God's it too big
[51:32] brother Caleb Providence all right okay
[51:35] we don't always see that but we know he
[51:37] does it anyway aren't you glad for that
[51:41] right yes so we know that before there
[51:45] could be fish and I remember and we're
[51:48] going to go through this kind of
[51:49] backwards but you remember that that
[51:53] there was a little boy there that had
[51:55] the five Lo
[51:57] and the two fishes Jesus didn't create
[52:01] something new he
[52:03] multiplied what had already been created
[52:06] at that
[52:07] time so there had to be if we back it up
[52:11] we realize there had to be somebody who
[52:14] caught some
[52:15] fish right and clean the
[52:18] fish and that's how I know there must
[52:21] have been a father in that home Who
[52:25] provided for his own
[52:27] right amen so I want you to think about
[52:28] that as the first step towards 5,000
[52:31] people getting fed at the meeting right
[52:34] was a father providing for his own I'm
[52:37] so glad we have a heavenly father that
[52:39] provides for his own tonight but this
[52:42] father must have provided the father you
[52:45] said how do you know there was a father
[52:46] the fish got clean didn't they it's
[52:48] always Dad's
[52:50] job so you just bear with me in my Folly
[52:52] maybe there wasn't one there but
[52:54] somebody provided and if not an Earthly
[52:57] father then the heavenly father provided
[53:00] Jesus didn't create it look said when he
[53:03] fed 5,000 people he took a fish that
[53:05] once swam in the water broke it handed
[53:08] it out and multiplied creation he took
[53:11] bread that was once wheat baked into
[53:13] bread broke it and handed out to the
[53:15] people and it returned back again he
[53:16] said he multiplied creation but you
[53:19] don't you realize what a day we live in
[53:20] today he said greater things than this
[53:22] shall you do he said but in the last
[53:24] days where there's no sign of cre
[53:27] he speaks it into creation anyhow shows
[53:30] to be the same God that was in the
[53:32] beginning he said he can create
[53:34] squirrels he can create whatever he
[53:35] wants to because he's God do we still
[53:37] believe that tonight he can do what he
[53:39] wants to do because he's God right yes
[53:43] sir greater things than this will you do
[53:46] for I go into my father he said the word
[53:48] is infallible and it has to be
[53:50] manifested and has to be fulfilled you
[53:52] could put that on your refrigerator it's
[53:54] absolutely the truth the word is is
[53:56] infallible and it has to be manifested
[53:59] and has to be fulfilled greater than
[54:01] this should you do not multiplying but
[54:03] speaking out into creation that's the
[54:05] hour we live in the age of the spoken
[54:07] word and yet we know that in this case
[54:10] brother brandham said that this was not
[54:13] created it was multiplied so somebody
[54:15] had to clean the
[54:18] fish are you with me so
[54:20] far so the heavenly father provided the
[54:25] wheat huh
[54:27] yeah he provided the fish put it on the
[54:30] Earth but an Earthly father must have
[54:32] caught the fish and cleaned it cut down
[54:35] the wheat M it the father's role is to
[54:40] provide and and I know that for some for
[54:43] many of us uh you know it's become in
[54:45] such an age where we're making bricks
[54:47] without straw it seems like that more
[54:50] and more the the the sisters have to
[54:52] work to help out in the home and that's
[54:54] random said that was okay if it was to
[54:56] pay the bills and to help in some way
[54:59] but yet it's the husband's role to
[55:01] provide for the
[55:03] home and I want our young people to
[55:05] understand that you say brother Ben
[55:06] where are you going I'm not sure yet but
[55:08] we'll end up
[55:09] somewhere but I want our young people I
[55:12] want our young men uh these older young
[55:14] men that are here uh tripping and and
[55:17] Landon and Peter and and I know some of
[55:20] y'all think you're older too but but as
[55:23] they get older I want you to understand
[55:24] it is a man's
[55:27] responsibility to provide for the house
[55:30] amen it's not the woman's
[55:32] responsibility to provide for the house
[55:34] not at all and yet sometimes a woman
[55:37] will help right just like there's times
[55:40] a man will help with a wife's
[55:42] responsibilities right because because
[55:45] of love that's love in a marriage and
[55:47] care for one for another yet a man
[55:50] provides period so if the wife never
[55:53] brings in a dollar it's my job to take
[55:57] care of my family so I don't have to
[56:00] like my job I don't have to I don't have
[56:03] to it don't have to fit my personality I
[56:05] don't I have to work because it's my job
[56:08] it's my responsibility to provide
[56:11] everybody understand that tonight but
[56:13] you realize the same thing is true of
[56:14] God it's his
[56:17] responsibility to take care of me when
[56:20] I'm in need and when I'm in it's not my
[56:22] responsibility to take care of my
[56:24] spiritual needs it's his responsib
[56:28] so a man is to provide in fact Paul says
[56:31] if any provide not for his own
[56:33] especially for those of his own house he
[56:35] has denied the faith and is worse than
[56:37] an Infidel that's strong
[56:40] language I believe our boys need to hear
[56:42] that today believe we all need to hear
[56:45] that a man is to provide for all those
[56:48] in his house so when you get a little
[56:49] bit older you start thinking about those
[56:50] things you got to learn to work or or go
[56:53] to school and and some way that you can
[56:56] provide for your family because that is
[56:58] your responsibility to provide in the
[57:01] scripture is to means to take thought
[57:04] for beforehand I'm so glad he does that
[57:08] for us amen but as as men we don't just
[57:11] show up and go to work but we take
[57:13] thought for that how will we provide for
[57:16] our families look 2 Thessalonians 3:10
[57:20] tells us that he said we commanded you
[57:22] that if any would not work neither
[57:23] should he eat other words refuse to work
[57:25] when they were able what is that he's
[57:28] showing that it's the father it's a
[57:29] man's role if he will not work he should
[57:32] not eat but he he he is his role to do
[57:36] that and yet and yet when we fulfill the
[57:39] word when we do what we're supposed to
[57:41] do you say brother Ben I don't know how
[57:42] I'm going to make it I don't know how
[57:44] I'm going to have a job that provides
[57:45] for my family if you'll do your part
[57:48] he's promised to do his part right
[57:50] because he wouldn't ask you to do
[57:52] something that you can't do and when you
[57:54] fulfill the word and and do your best to
[57:56] provide for your own God will take what
[57:58] you bring to him and multiply it right
[58:02] he'll feed 5,000 if that's how many kids
[58:05] you
[58:07] have with Five Loaves and two
[58:10] fishes but it's your job to get the Five
[58:13] Loaves and the two
[58:14] fishes right are you with me now
[58:17] somebody had to do it somebody had to go
[58:19] fishing and he had no idea what an
[58:21] impact it was going to have on his
[58:24] family he had no idea what an impact it
[58:26] was going to have on the church no idea
[58:28] what an impact it was going to have when
[58:30] it come to when it come to the gospel
[58:32] and how we would think about it today
[58:34] when he cleaned those two fish he
[58:36] thought he was just giving his little
[58:37] boy lunch sometimes when you dads go to
[58:39] work you think well I don't do nothing
[58:41] in the church I don't have but just
[58:43] doing what God told you to do is
[58:45] actually it means so much to the economy
[58:48] of God because you might be feeding the
[58:50] next preacher you might be feeding the
[58:53] next Deacon the in your home and and
[58:55] when you feed them well they come to
[58:58] church right and the materials the
[59:00] ingredients hope if you're following me
[59:02] tonight the ingredients you put in their
[59:05] life are multiplied by God to help other
[59:10] people are you with me
[59:13] now so they might have looked around and
[59:15] said how did we get
[59:17] fed because a man provided food for his
[59:21] family we might look around after church
[59:23] say how did we get fed because Jehovah
[59:26] Gyra is our
[59:28] provider our father provides food for
[59:32] his
[59:33] family now the little boy had a
[59:36] lunch and I think maybe the reason he
[59:39] had a lunch is he had a
[59:40] mother right want to make sure that he
[59:44] could have a lunch to take with him
[59:47] little boys aren't very good at
[59:48] providing uh look looking ahead and
[59:51] providing for themselves so Mama made
[59:54] sure that he had had a lunch so the
[59:57] second reason that we could look at this
[59:59] that how did they get fed that day is a
[1:00:02] mother
[1:00:03] cooked
[1:00:05] lunch right and so she got it together
[1:00:07] and and you know maybe the equivalent of
[1:00:10] ramen noodles and that day
[1:00:13] was loe's and Fishes I don't know
[1:00:16] brother Bill's shaking his head I he
[1:00:19] must like Ramen noodles every bit as
[1:00:20] much as I
[1:00:23] do I hate them things
[1:00:27] but but here whatever it is she she
[1:00:30] cooked it she took what was provided her
[1:00:34] and put it in a in in a thing or a box
[1:00:37] or something so her little boy had a
[1:00:39] lunch that he could then give to Jesus
[1:00:42] early that morning mom must have got up
[1:00:44] and started a fire you think about it
[1:00:47] wasn't quite so easy as what we've got
[1:00:49] it they didn't have Lunchables in that
[1:00:51] day and time so she made him a Lunchable
[1:00:56] right and so she she actually got up
[1:00:59] early and and and probably put the wood
[1:01:01] in the fire and well Dad's off catching
[1:01:03] the fish are off at work and and and
[1:01:05] when he brings home the the fish and the
[1:01:08] and and she had the bread there she took
[1:01:09] it she cut it in pieces and and she
[1:01:12] cooked it real good cuz brother bam
[1:01:14] tells us it was
[1:01:16] cooked right cuz they just ate it it
[1:01:18] wasn't raw they weren't eating
[1:01:21] sushi it wasn't meant to be consumed
[1:01:23] that way every time Jesus ate fish he
[1:01:26] cooked it praise
[1:01:29] God that's my personal Doctrine I'm just
[1:01:31] going to stay with
[1:01:35] that so she she cooked the bread and the
[1:01:38] fish and committed it to the hands of
[1:01:41] that little boy having no clue that they
[1:01:45] would end up in the hands of
[1:01:47] Jesus but she did her
[1:01:49] work oh church we can only understand
[1:01:52] you say well I don't mean anything to
[1:01:53] the church yes you do all right I'm not
[1:01:56] important in the service yes you are you
[1:01:58] mean something to the in the house of
[1:02:00] God you mean something to the people of
[1:02:02] God it might all you might have been
[1:02:04] able to do was get up and feed your
[1:02:06] family lunch but that provided in such a
[1:02:08] way for them that they could be in the
[1:02:10] house of
[1:02:11] God right so she she cooked the bread
[1:02:14] and the fishes and that morning all over
[1:02:18] Jerusalem people were going to work all
[1:02:21] over wherever they were there in Galilee
[1:02:22] people were going to work the high
[1:02:24] priest got up and went through his daily
[1:02:25] ritual and the merchant opened up his
[1:02:28] shop and the and the fisherman cast her
[1:02:31] Nets great men like pilot and Herod
[1:02:34] conducted their business their diplomacy
[1:02:37] and saw people in their throne rooms but
[1:02:40] the most important job that was done
[1:02:42] that day are you hearing me Church the
[1:02:45] most important thing in the
[1:02:48] world was going on in a
[1:02:51] kitchen where a little mother was
[1:02:53] packing a little boy's lunch
[1:02:56] good you said but brother Ben I want to
[1:02:59] have an importance in life I want to
[1:03:00] have a career and I want to do this and
[1:03:02] it's fine for you to do whatever you're
[1:03:05] smart enough to do I guess but I want
[1:03:07] you to understand how important the job
[1:03:09] is that God has given you if you're a
[1:03:11] mother today if you're a housewife God
[1:03:14] has given you a job that is so important
[1:03:18] because you it's not up to you to
[1:03:19] multiply it you just have to do it see
[1:03:24] the Bible says that the older women
[1:03:26] should teach the younger women to be
[1:03:27] sober to love their husbands to love
[1:03:29] their children to be discreet chased
[1:03:32] keepers at home that means a hous worker
[1:03:35] a hous
[1:03:36] worker and I've often said that our
[1:03:39] women have to work out of the house our
[1:03:40] our sisters that have to work out of the
[1:03:42] house are actually they work two
[1:03:44] jobs and and we should do everything we
[1:03:47] can as a husband to see that they that
[1:03:49] they are uh that we help all that we can
[1:03:52] because they're actually working two
[1:03:54] jobs because have a job at home and it's
[1:03:57] their most important job amen mothers
[1:04:00] have an extremely important role in the
[1:04:02] Scriptures it took joked to produce a
[1:04:04] Moses right it took Hannah to dedicate
[1:04:08] Samuel to the Lord right it took Mary to
[1:04:10] raise Jesus and she had him for 30
[1:04:15] years do you realize that he was still
[1:04:17] at
[1:04:19] home cuz she was she went to the they
[1:04:21] went to the wedding together when he
[1:04:23] began his ministry so here he was still
[1:04:27] she raised him for 30 years God left
[1:04:31] himself in flesh in her
[1:04:34] care somebody had to cook the meals
[1:04:37] somebody had to clean the house so Jesus
[1:04:40] could be who he
[1:04:42] was are you with me
[1:04:45] now how do we get
[1:04:48] fed and they might have looked around
[1:04:50] said how do we get fed they had no clue
[1:04:52] it was because a mother cooked all right
[1:04:55] and to little boy's lunch many times you
[1:04:57] come to the house of God and you say oh
[1:04:59] wasn't that a wonderful sermon wasn't
[1:05:01] that a wonderful I hope you do anyway I
[1:05:03] may be I may be thinking uh
[1:05:04] optimistically there but you might come
[1:05:06] to the house of God and say wasn't it a
[1:05:08] wonderful service didn't we don't you
[1:05:09] enjoy the atmosphere that we have but
[1:05:11] you don't see the ingredients to go into
[1:05:13] it the ingredients that housewives are
[1:05:15] putting into it the ingredients that
[1:05:17] husbands are putting into it the
[1:05:18] ingredients that the the people in the
[1:05:20] back are putting into it you don't see
[1:05:23] you can sit at home if you're not able
[1:05:24] to come to church and those you that are
[1:05:26] streaming tonight you're able to sit
[1:05:27] there and stream the service and you
[1:05:29] don't see the work that goes into
[1:05:32] that right but but what is it it's God's
[1:05:36] work and I want you to know that God
[1:05:39] sees that and he said don't be weary and
[1:05:42] well doing but in due time you'll be
[1:05:44] rewarded for what you the labor you put
[1:05:46] in yes it don't just happen somebody
[1:05:50] does it right right how did we get fed
[1:05:54] because a mother did what she was was
[1:05:55] called to do pack the little boy's
[1:05:59] lunch I want to talk to you young people
[1:06:01] for a minute you think well I'm not
[1:06:03] important it's not important that I sit
[1:06:05] on the front row and I see all these
[1:06:07] notes are taken my
[1:06:08] goodness are the words small enough you
[1:06:11] can understand tonight is that yeah
[1:06:15] look all the work all the all the time
[1:06:19] you come to church you might feel like
[1:06:20] well I'm just waiting on getting out you
[1:06:22] know or we can go play see you're
[1:06:25] important in the
[1:06:27] service and you parents you know
[1:06:29] sometimes when we commit our children to
[1:06:31] the Lord I hope this is okay tonight I
[1:06:33] know it's slow but sometimes when we
[1:06:35] when we commit our children to the Lord
[1:06:37] you know the first thing they do is go
[1:06:38] the wrong
[1:06:41] way or at least we think they're going
[1:06:43] the wrong way because brother bham tells
[1:06:46] us in this story that the first thing
[1:06:48] the little boy did is play hookie at
[1:06:53] school right so the father Faithfully
[1:06:56] provides the mother Faithfully packs his
[1:07:00] lunch and gets him out the door and he
[1:07:05] unfaithfully runs
[1:07:08] away he immediately goes
[1:07:10] fishing I guess that gives license to
[1:07:13] all you boys young boys and girls to
[1:07:17] fish instead of going to school but
[1:07:19] anyway maybe
[1:07:21] not he intended to go fishing he was
[1:07:25] going the wrong way but God has a way of
[1:07:27] getting a hold of those who intend to do
[1:07:29] something different aren't you glad for
[1:07:31] that he got a hold of you you weren't
[1:07:32] looking for God he was looking for you
[1:07:35] and he got a hold of you when you
[1:07:37] planned on doing something
[1:07:39] different so brother Brandon said there
[1:07:41] he stood with hundreds 5,000 men women
[1:07:43] and children hungry grown all day with
[1:07:45] no food through the dust just to hear a
[1:07:47] word or two from his precious lips tired
[1:07:51] he sat upon the rock and a little boy
[1:07:54] played hookie from school
[1:07:56] you know Trent what that means is he
[1:07:59] skipped
[1:08:01] class and went
[1:08:03] fishing and he heard Jesus and he came
[1:08:07] by he's the one that had the lunch see
[1:08:10] it may look like your children have gone
[1:08:12] the wrong direction but just hold on
[1:08:14] Jesus has a way of attracting their
[1:08:18] attention oh I I love it when the kids
[1:08:20] begin to pay attention in church he has
[1:08:22] a way of attracting their attention even
[1:08:25] those that have left you see well my
[1:08:26] kids are are gone they don't come to
[1:08:28] church anymore but remember he has a way
[1:08:32] of attracting their attention to where
[1:08:35] at the right time at the right place so
[1:08:37] they can do what God has called them to
[1:08:39] do see Jesus already knew that the young
[1:08:42] man would come that day right in fact
[1:08:45] the whole service was set up all right
[1:08:48] and he even where he was the location
[1:08:50] and everything else Jesus knowing he was
[1:08:53] going to feed everybody that day but not
[1:08:56] no and he knew how but the disciples
[1:08:59] knew none of it and the 5000s knew none
[1:09:03] of it and many times you don't know any
[1:09:05] of it and he does it
[1:09:08] anyhow but I'm so thankful Jesus had the
[1:09:11] meeting right and sometimes we think
[1:09:13] well the meetings are hard we're about
[1:09:15] to start really kicking it into gear to
[1:09:17] prepare for our meetings but I'm glad he
[1:09:18] had that meeting right I'm glad Jesus
[1:09:21] took the time to have the meeting and
[1:09:23] feed the people and do what needed to be
[1:09:25] done but don't worry if if it's of God
[1:09:27] God will provide for the
[1:09:29] meeting amen so Jesus knew he would come
[1:09:33] by that day he knew you would be in
[1:09:35] church tonight amen now I've always
[1:09:39] wondered why the little boy had Five
[1:09:41] Loaves that's a lot of bread for two
[1:09:44] fish see he got Five Loaves he even
[1:09:48] though the loaves were not necessarily
[1:09:49] like French loaves like we would have
[1:09:51] today or regular loaves they were
[1:09:53] actually a loaf much like we saw in
[1:09:54] Egypt it'd be a round uh bread maybe
[1:09:57] about that thick but he had five of them
[1:10:00] it's a lot for a little boy other the
[1:10:02] two fishes I understand because I like
[1:10:04] fish but you know the little boy may not
[1:10:07] have been alone did you know that you
[1:10:09] kids know that that little boy may not
[1:10:10] have been alone brother brandom tells us
[1:10:13] this he said Brethren I crawled up close
[1:10:14] to that rock he's talking about the
[1:10:16] disciples giving testimony he said when
[1:10:18] I've seen that little boy we followed us
[1:10:20] followed us down there this morning had
[1:10:22] been playing TR it from the school him
[1:10:24] and his little
[1:10:26] sister had this lunch under her
[1:10:29] arm so him and his little sister were
[1:10:32] walking down there and you know I can
[1:10:34] just imagine that boy she was driving
[1:10:36] him
[1:10:38] crazy I got this picture in my mind when
[1:10:41] I read this quote of this little
[1:10:42] sister's coming after him she's saying
[1:10:44] I'm going to tell
[1:10:46] Mom you just wait I'm going to tell Mom
[1:10:49] he you you're playing hook and you ain't
[1:10:51] you're headed to the fishing hole I I
[1:10:53] know it huh and he got her lunch she
[1:10:56] well I tell you what you'd be lucky if
[1:10:57] you ever get this
[1:10:59] lunch imagine how she felt when he gave
[1:11:02] her lunch
[1:11:05] away she got fed too
[1:11:09] right that's what that's what brother B
[1:11:12] said I don't know where he got that but
[1:11:13] I like to think that the little sister
[1:11:14] was following him
[1:11:16] around Jesus somehow attracted this
[1:11:19] little boy's attention now he might have
[1:11:22] been dragged to church over and over
[1:11:24] again
[1:11:27] they might have made him go every
[1:11:28] Saturday when they would have the the
[1:11:30] the Sabbath day and and I'm sure they
[1:11:33] did because the Jews were very diligent
[1:11:35] about their with their children make
[1:11:37] sure they went to the house of God so
[1:11:39] they probably went to every synagogue
[1:11:40] service and every place and they went
[1:11:43] there and every every Saturday they go
[1:11:45] force him to take a bath and and get
[1:11:47] ready and and put his best robe on and
[1:11:50] they'd go down there and he'd learn the
[1:11:52] scriptures go down to Sunday school or
[1:11:54] Saturday school if they had it and and
[1:11:57] he would learn the
[1:11:58] scriptures but he he never wanted to
[1:12:02] go they just dragged him
[1:12:05] there but that day he was going
[1:12:08] fishing and there was something about
[1:12:11] the meeting that attracted his attention
[1:12:15] so much that he gave up fishing to go to
[1:12:19] church I know I don't know about the
[1:12:21] rest of y'all but I know me and brother
[1:12:22] Stewart that take quite a bit
[1:12:25] right it take quite a meeting to attract
[1:12:27] our attention away from fishing to go to
[1:12:31] church well Danny that's quite a meeting
[1:12:33] but somehow it did it attracted his
[1:12:35] attention Jesus has a way of doing that
[1:12:39] you know what he did as he got closer he
[1:12:42] heard the noise of the crowd all right
[1:12:45] do you know that wherever Jesus is
[1:12:47] there's a lot of
[1:12:49] noise right and he hears the noise of
[1:12:52] the crowd and it attracted his attention
[1:12:56] oh I I pray every church service is like
[1:12:58] that maybe your amen will get the
[1:13:01] attention of one of these young children
[1:13:03] that will attract their attention to the
[1:13:05] house of God right he would just go and
[1:13:08] see what the noise was all
[1:13:10] about heyen I think of John Wesley when
[1:13:13] the preachers asking him said how do we
[1:13:14] go uh what should we do to start our
[1:13:16] ministry he said he said just get so on
[1:13:19] fire for God he said until you just burn
[1:13:22] so brightly that that the people come to
[1:13:24] watch you you burn sir oh church let us
[1:13:28] be like
[1:13:29] that brother BR said he just had one
[1:13:31] little lunch some little boy perhaps
[1:13:33] playing Tru from school run off and he
[1:13:35] heard the crowd he heard the crowd yeah
[1:13:38] and he went up on the hill to see what
[1:13:39] was taking place and it was so
[1:13:42] fascinating he just forgot about his
[1:13:44] lunch well he must have really gotten
[1:13:48] distracted he forgot about fishing am he
[1:13:51] forgot about lunch all right oh God oh
[1:13:55] don't you know and Jesus would preach
[1:13:57] for hours he preached so long that the
[1:14:01] disciples said hey you need to send this
[1:14:02] crowd away they won't be able to make it
[1:14:03] to the
[1:14:04] Applebees right I mean McDonald's is
[1:14:10] closing so he preached so long but the
[1:14:13] little boy held his attention why there
[1:14:16] was something about it this was his
[1:14:19] moment God was fixing to use him for
[1:14:22] something you young people don't give up
[1:14:24] hope God God's fixing to use you for
[1:14:26] something don't say Well church is
[1:14:28] boring when I turn 18 boy I'm going to
[1:14:30] leave God's fixing to use you for
[1:14:32] something he wants to take what your
[1:14:34] mother and father put into you and use
[1:14:37] it for something is that all right yes
[1:14:39] now look wherever Jesus is there's a lot
[1:14:42] of noise so here he was attracted by the
[1:14:44] noise and when he got up there he forgot
[1:14:47] about his lunch because he wanted to see
[1:14:49] what this great speaker was saying and
[1:14:52] watch what he was doing all right oh
[1:14:55] that's why we always need the presence
[1:14:57] of Jesus in our services because if he's
[1:14:59] here then the young people be attracted
[1:15:02] to that and they want to see they want
[1:15:04] to hear what he's saying and they want
[1:15:06] to see what he's
[1:15:08] doing right they might have looked
[1:15:11] around afterward said how did we get fed
[1:15:14] because a little boy went to
[1:15:17] church
[1:15:20] amen there was not only a boy that went
[1:15:22] to church it was a disciple that brought
[1:15:24] him to Jesus I forgot to turn on my
[1:15:25] timer so but we're doing good a disciple
[1:15:29] brought him to Jesus John
[1:15:31] 6:5 when Jesus then lifted up his eyes
[1:15:34] and saw a great company coming to him he
[1:15:36] said to Phillip When shall we buy bread
[1:15:39] that these may eat and he said this to
[1:15:42] prove him for he himself knew what he
[1:15:45] would do right all right he he knew what
[1:15:47] was going to happen yeah but he asked
[1:15:49] the trustees Anyway said hey how are we
[1:15:51] going to pay for this
[1:15:55] just real simple tonight just trying to
[1:15:57] be
[1:16:01] understandable when should we buy bread
[1:16:03] and they said oh I don't know I wouldn't
[1:16:07] the money is not in the account know
[1:16:09] then went looked up the bank account and
[1:16:10] the bag you know and shook it a little
[1:16:12] bit and said well there just not not
[1:16:13] much
[1:16:15] there he already knows how you'll get
[1:16:17] fed all right that's why we ought to
[1:16:20] always come to the house of God when we
[1:16:22] can he knows how we'll get fed it may
[1:16:25] not seem like it's much but he knows how
[1:16:27] we'll get fed in verse 7even Philip
[1:16:30] answered him 200 penny worth of bread is
[1:16:32] not sufficient for them that every one
[1:16:33] of them may take a little 200 dinari
[1:16:36] penny worth 200 pennies was a
[1:16:38] substantial sum a penny was about a
[1:16:40] day's wage for a lab laborer so each one
[1:16:44] of them if they work a full day they get
[1:16:45] one penny he said we could work for 200
[1:16:48] days all right and not make enough money
[1:16:51] to provide for this crowd it wouldn't be
[1:16:54] enough
[1:16:57] and and I love the fact then that Andrew
[1:17:00] speaks up I've I've talked to you about
[1:17:02] Andrew before not Andrew Glover although
[1:17:04] I think he's got a little bit of this in
[1:17:05] him as well but this Andrew in the Bible
[1:17:09] the Apostle Andrew he was a person who
[1:17:13] always stepped in at the right time when
[1:17:16] something was
[1:17:17] needed and one of his disciples Andrew
[1:17:20] Simon Peter's brother said unto him
[1:17:22] there's a lad here which has five barley
[1:17:25] loes and two small fishes but what are
[1:17:27] they among so
[1:17:29] many but you know the rest of them
[1:17:31] didn't even have any enough Faith to
[1:17:33] look and see what people
[1:17:34] had but Andrew had enough faith that he
[1:17:38] looked around the congregation he said
[1:17:40] well we got Five Loaves and two fishes
[1:17:45] but what are they among so many I've got
[1:17:48] lots of questions for
[1:17:50] Andrew how did he know about the little
[1:17:52] boy's lunch you know God provides
[1:17:54] certain people are just willing to talk
[1:17:56] to people that's communication right
[1:18:00] there and know the other disciples knew
[1:18:03] but Andrew was different he knew what
[1:18:04] the little boy had for
[1:18:06] lunch and you know sometimes it's good
[1:18:08] to talk it's good to talk because you
[1:18:11] never know how Jesus might use that
[1:18:13] information now I've never said it's
[1:18:14] good to talk in the Pulpit before but
[1:18:16] it's good to talk about good things what
[1:18:19] did you have for lunch that's good so
[1:18:23] the little boy must have come up and
[1:18:24] Andrew befriended him in some way and
[1:18:27] and and brother B said he followed him
[1:18:29] there to the meeting and so he
[1:18:30] befriended him in some way and said hey
[1:18:32] well you got in your bag there and he
[1:18:33] said well I got Five Loaves and two
[1:18:36] fishes he said hang on to that Jesus
[1:18:38] might need
[1:18:40] it amen oh that's what we need we need
[1:18:43] some Andrews around this was Andrews
[1:18:46] nature in John 135 it tells us uh John
[1:18:50] this is John the disciple had act or the
[1:18:53] uh uh John the Baptist had stood up
[1:18:55] there and he began to declare that Jesus
[1:18:57] was the Messiah and the next day after
[1:19:00] John stood and two of his disciples
[1:19:02] looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith
[1:19:04] Behold the Lamb of God I believe we've
[1:19:07] heard that in our day right Behold the
[1:19:09] Lamb of God right and the two disciples
[1:19:12] heard him speak and they followed Jesus
[1:19:15] and one of the two which heard John
[1:19:17] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[1:19:19] Peter's brother but watch Andrew's
[1:19:22] personality it's not enough just for him
[1:19:25] to go to church he going to make sure
[1:19:27] his whole family
[1:19:29] goes right so verse uh uh 41 tells us he
[1:19:33] first findeth his own brother Simon so
[1:19:35] before he ever went and heard Jesus he
[1:19:37] went to find Simon and said on him we
[1:19:40] have found the Messiah which is being
[1:19:43] interpreted the Christ and notice what
[1:19:45] he did he brought him to Jesus Andrew
[1:19:49] couldn't make Simon believe but he could
[1:19:51] get him to Jesus Andrew couldn't could
[1:19:54] be the one who discerned the secrets of
[1:19:56] of Peter's heart but he got him Jesus he
[1:19:59] couldn't give him a new name but he got
[1:20:01] him
[1:20:02] Jesus he brought him to Jesus and when
[1:20:04] Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon
[1:20:07] the son of Jonah thou shal be called
[1:20:08] sephus which is by interpretation a
[1:20:11] stone now we don't know if Andrew had
[1:20:13] any gifts he never is spoken of as one
[1:20:15] who did Miracles or saw signs and
[1:20:17] wonders in his ministry but he knew if
[1:20:20] he could just get people in the presence
[1:20:22] of Jesus things would be different
[1:20:25] he said well brother Ben how did he do
[1:20:27] it well brother R gives us a clue he
[1:20:29] tells us you know some men are fine some
[1:20:31] men are dogmatic some men are blusterous
[1:20:33] some men are gentle right he tells us
[1:20:36] that but he says something about Andrew
[1:20:37] he said Andrew was a prayer Warrior he
[1:20:40] said Andrew is that prayer Warrior just
[1:20:43] stayed on his knees all the time so it
[1:20:45] may be that because he stayed on his
[1:20:47] knees in prayer that God led him to the
[1:20:50] little boy and caused him to bring him
[1:20:52] in the presence of Jesus Oh church if we
[1:20:54] do that I believe our families would
[1:20:56] begin to desire to be in the house of
[1:20:58] God more if we'd spend more time on our
[1:21:00] knees in prayer yes oh that we had more
[1:21:03] folks suck Andrew I'm so glad for some
[1:21:05] of you that pray for your pastor and
[1:21:07] pray for the church and pray for these
[1:21:09] young people and pray for each other I'm
[1:21:11] so glad that you do because Without You
[1:21:14] Andrews we could never come in the
[1:21:16] presence of
[1:21:17] Jesus we need some
[1:21:20] Andrews brother brand said today well
[1:21:22] the Harvest is on let's go about
[1:21:24] gathering in the sheet everywhere
[1:21:26] whatever God's give you to do if you're
[1:21:28] a little housewife testify to the
[1:21:30] neighbor something do something bring
[1:21:32] somebody with you when you come oh could
[1:21:35] that be our our determination tonight
[1:21:37] I'm going to bring somebody with me he
[1:21:39] said bring somebody to church well not
[1:21:41] necessarily bring somebody to heaven
[1:21:42] with you when you
[1:21:44] go he said take us tonight Lord just
[1:21:46] what we are all of us are not preachers
[1:21:49] all of us are not prophets all of us are
[1:21:52] not speakers with tongues all of us are
[1:21:54] not miracle co workers but all of us
[1:21:56] someone say all all of us have something
[1:21:58] to do show us where it is Lord testify
[1:22:02] sing or pray and I he said like bread
[1:22:05] upon the Water it will return some
[1:22:06] glorious day granted Lord here we are
[1:22:09] send us to our neighbors to wherever we
[1:22:12] can to our fellow men and tell them of
[1:22:14] the coming of the Lord oh could we be
[1:22:16] like Andrew today and get people in the
[1:22:18] presence of
[1:22:21] Jesus look said how did we get fed
[1:22:24] because Andrew brought a little boy to
[1:22:29] Jesus
[1:22:30] Jesus heard that we got Five Loaves and
[1:22:34] two fishes he said make them sit
[1:22:38] down now said there was much grass in
[1:22:41] the place Jesus picks a particular place
[1:22:44] where they could sit down if you know
[1:22:46] anything about Israel there's not much
[1:22:48] grass
[1:22:49] anywhere but there was in that place so
[1:22:53] they could sit down and have dinner cuz
[1:22:55] he had already provided
[1:22:57] amen was already in his plan so the men
[1:23:01] sat down in number about
[1:23:04] 5,000 Jesus picks up the little boy's
[1:23:07] lunch right puts it in his hands right
[1:23:11] but the B said did you ever think what
[1:23:12] kind of an atom he must have let
[1:23:15] loose well where did the flower come
[1:23:18] from see when they made the loaves she
[1:23:21] had to use flour to make them but when
[1:23:23] he broke the Lo and they grew back on
[1:23:25] there was no
[1:23:27] flow it
[1:23:30] disappeared he said where did the flow
[1:23:32] come from not only flour but it was
[1:23:34] already baked in a loaf and ready to eat
[1:23:36] he had fish he grew the fish at the
[1:23:39] first place but now he breaks the fish
[1:23:42] half and two and another fish could grow
[1:23:45] on there but this fish that comes on
[1:23:48] there is already cooked and baked and
[1:23:50] grow
[1:23:51] too glory to God when you think it's
[1:23:55] hopeless when you think there's no way
[1:23:57] that you say I'm working brother Ben I'm
[1:23:59] doing everything I can for my family I'm
[1:24:01] doing everything when you think there's
[1:24:02] no way remember Jesus broke the bread
[1:24:05] and when he did what he would what what
[1:24:07] all that the little boy had was Five
[1:24:08] Loaves and two fishes but he was when he
[1:24:11] broke it it multiplied in his hands and
[1:24:14] there was no way you could explain that
[1:24:17] but it
[1:24:18] happened now look what did he do oh he's
[1:24:21] God he said just speak it that's all he
[1:24:24] has to do he said now the little boy
[1:24:26] that little lunch he had wasn't very
[1:24:28] much in his hands but when he let what
[1:24:31] he had go into Jesus hands it fed
[1:24:36] thousands oh Church you young people if
[1:24:40] you could just take what you have you
[1:24:42] say I need more talent I wish I could
[1:24:44] sing better I wish I could play the
[1:24:45] piano I wish I could do this set or the
[1:24:47] other take what you
[1:24:49] have give it to him be willing be ready
[1:24:53] to give it to him Lord whatever I can be
[1:24:55] used for Lord let me be useful let me
[1:24:58] take what you've given me and put it in
[1:25:01] your hands as long as it's in my hands
[1:25:05] it couldn't do very much but in his
[1:25:06] hands it'll feed thousands he said and
[1:25:10] maybe what little faith you say well I
[1:25:12] wish I had great faith but what little
[1:25:14] faith you got you got faith enough to
[1:25:17] come to church how many are in church
[1:25:20] tonight where are the rest of you
[1:25:26] right you have faith enough to come to
[1:25:29] church didn't
[1:25:31] you well come on it required some faith
[1:25:36] it may not have been much but it was
[1:25:37] some it was more for some than
[1:25:39] others some people come to church and
[1:25:42] they don't maybe know where tomorrow's
[1:25:44] Bread's coming from but they're going to
[1:25:45] come to church
[1:25:46] tonight some people come Church hurting
[1:25:48] some people come to church in pain and
[1:25:50] some come to church and it's just easy
[1:25:52] because their parents go anyway
[1:25:54] and they kind of have to but you had
[1:25:57] enough Faith to be in church tonight are
[1:25:59] you with me now you got enough Faith to
[1:26:01] be in church and then if you got that
[1:26:03] much Faith why don't you just give it
[1:26:05] over in the hands of Jesus it'll feed
[1:26:08] thousands Hallelujah so there's not much
[1:26:11] in your hands but once in his hands
[1:26:14] it'll do Miracles if you let that Faith
[1:26:17] get in his hands oh I think we've seen
[1:26:19] that church we've seen it every one of
[1:26:21] you can tell about miracles when you
[1:26:23] finally put that situation in the hands
[1:26:26] of Jesus he can do
[1:26:28] Miracles he still does today if you let
[1:26:31] that Faith get in his
[1:26:34] hands there were also some disciples
[1:26:36] there who distributed what Jesus
[1:26:39] multiplied amen not up to me to multiply
[1:26:42] it's up to me to distribute it there you
[1:26:45] go Hallelujah Jesus Took the lows when
[1:26:48] he had given thanks he distributed to
[1:26:50] the disciples and the disciples to them
[1:26:52] that were set down so he said here you
[1:26:55] go here you go Peter you can carry a lot
[1:26:57] take these yeah the bread's just growing
[1:27:01] all the time you know just breaking it
[1:27:03] here Peter take this load okay he can
[1:27:06] carry a lot maybe maybe he gave Judas a
[1:27:10] lot too so he wouldn't you know he
[1:27:12] didn't want to get killed ahead of his
[1:27:13] time you know make him give him plenty
[1:27:16] so he'll be happy maybe one of the other
[1:27:18] disciples maybe they just got a little
[1:27:20] bit but it was enough to feed the people
[1:27:22] that were in their group they were
[1:27:24] responsible for right see Jesus didn't
[1:27:28] walk out there and hand everybody here
[1:27:29] here's a loaf of fish you know if he'd
[1:27:30] have been a politician you want to make
[1:27:32] sure his name got on it and he was one
[1:27:34] that distributed he was out there but no
[1:27:35] what was he doing breaking it
[1:27:38] multiplying it giving it to the
[1:27:39] disciples and they took it you realize
[1:27:42] what preaching is it's just us taking
[1:27:45] what he gives us we can't preach what he
[1:27:47] doesn't give us he takes we he takes
[1:27:50] this message and breaks it for us and
[1:27:53] then we take it and we just give it out
[1:27:55] to you and you say oh that was wonderful
[1:27:58] work I just gave you what he gave
[1:28:00] me I didn't cook it I didn't clean it I
[1:28:03] didn't provide it I didn't do anything
[1:28:05] for it all I did was carry it all right
[1:28:09] oh God that God would have preachers
[1:28:11] everywhere that would carry this message
[1:28:14] Faithfully
[1:28:16] amen i' carry their own opinions but
[1:28:18] carry what he gave them not the fishes
[1:28:21] and Loaves and and some chocolate cake
[1:28:23] but but just what he gave us that'll be
[1:28:29] sufficient BR said God always used men
[1:28:31] for his work is that right he he he
[1:28:34] don't use organizations or so forth
[1:28:35] Mechanical Devices he uses men the Holy
[1:28:38] Spirit fell upon men that's God's
[1:28:39] instrument here on Earth and again he's
[1:28:42] talking about people being healed when
[1:28:44] hands were laid on he said now that
[1:28:45] doesn't make us Jesus doesn't make us
[1:28:48] Jesus see that just makes us his
[1:28:50] servants we are his vessels that he has
[1:28:53] working through us he uses men for his
[1:28:56] vessels to work through sir again he
[1:28:58] said many times people thinks when a
[1:29:00] Ministry becomes Supernatural they think
[1:29:02] that person ought to wear robe clothes
[1:29:04] and touch me not you know he said when a
[1:29:06] person acts like that they're trying to
[1:29:08] be something that they're
[1:29:10] not right Jesus was had the greatest
[1:29:13] Ministry ever and some of the biggest
[1:29:16] crowds by the way and he still found
[1:29:19] time to be around the disciples and to
[1:29:22] eat dinner with people
[1:29:24] God helped me to be the same way you
[1:29:26] said when a person acts like that
[1:29:27] they're trying to be something that
[1:29:28] they're not God uses men just ordinary
[1:29:31] men thank God for that I'm just about as
[1:29:35] ordinary as they get we went and did our
[1:29:37] our our DNA test you know and I thought
[1:29:40] well I'll find something exotic in there
[1:29:41] and I am as ordinary as a person as a
[1:29:44] human being could possibly be forgive me
[1:29:48] for this but I'm as white as they
[1:29:50] come all right English and Scottish
[1:29:55] and and I have no interesting stories to
[1:29:57] tell other than the bad stuff and and
[1:30:00] it's just not even interesting I had
[1:30:02] lost interest in it myself canceled my
[1:30:05] subscription it was so
[1:30:07] boring but I'm so glad God uses ordinary
[1:30:10] men aren't you glad he uses Ordinary
[1:30:13] People to do his
[1:30:14] work amen God uses men he said God could
[1:30:18] have used the sun to preach the gospel
[1:30:20] God could have used the wind to preach
[1:30:21] the gospel but God chose men to preach
[1:30:24] the gospel yes did go that Joel's so
[1:30:27] extraordinary we still don't know if he
[1:30:29] belongs to the
[1:30:34] family gives him
[1:30:38] hope or just ordinary people aren't we
[1:30:41] in Hardy Arkansas we're just ordinary
[1:30:42] people but God uses ordinary men right
[1:30:45] sir uses Ordinary People he said God
[1:30:48] chose men to preach the gospel he said
[1:30:50] that was his idea that human would speak
[1:30:52] back through human not
[1:30:54] himself but the word of the Lord came to
[1:30:57] the prophets the
[1:31:01] prophesied to give his word out that's
[1:31:03] how he chose to give the Loaves and
[1:31:05] Fishes to the
[1:31:07] people and so he waited until they all
[1:31:10] got
[1:31:11] full right you talk about a
[1:31:13] buffet b said they put four or five
[1:31:15] Loaves on this table and four or five on
[1:31:17] this table and they're looking around
[1:31:18] they're saying my goodness Jesus is a
[1:31:20] good host you
[1:31:22] know look at this
[1:31:24] they all got
[1:31:25] full just man they so oh I tell you what
[1:31:30] that was so
[1:31:32] good and then he said to his disciples I
[1:31:35] love
[1:31:36] this said I want you to go gather up the
[1:31:41] leftovers which is proof that sometimes
[1:31:43] you have to eat the
[1:31:45] leftovers it's
[1:31:48] okay but there was a purpose for this
[1:31:51] gather up the fragments that remain let
[1:31:54] nothing be lost because there was a
[1:31:57] purpose for every
[1:31:59] fish and a purpose for every
[1:32:02] loaf I want you to understand that he
[1:32:05] purposely made too much on Amen oh you
[1:32:10] think I'm going to I'm gonna get it all
[1:32:12] I'm you know I'm about there I'm about
[1:32:14] to my understanding the message where no
[1:32:16] he made so much that you'll never be
[1:32:19] able to comprehend at all that's right
[1:32:21] you'll get so full and yet there'll be
[1:32:23] four yes oh Church each disciple walked
[1:32:28] away with his own basket of leftovers
[1:32:31] did you ever notice that there wasn't 13
[1:32:34] there wasn't 11 there was
[1:32:36] 12 12 baskets of
[1:32:40] leftovers each one of them carried a
[1:32:42] basket each disciple Peter and James and
[1:32:46] John it's funny how that works isn't it
[1:32:48] he so distributed the food that every
[1:32:52] every one of them and I'm sure they
[1:32:53] griped and complain like we do cleaning
[1:32:54] up after a meeting you know
[1:32:57] and
[1:32:59] man what are we doing you know what here
[1:33:02] we have to give the people the food and
[1:33:04] they can't even take it home put it in a
[1:33:05] doggy bag we got to pick it back up
[1:33:07] again Jesus why did you have to make so
[1:33:10] much but see sometimes Jesus does
[1:33:13] something in an abundant way so that
[1:33:16] we'll remember it
[1:33:18] right amen they needed a reminder of
[1:33:22] what God had done and I always wondered
[1:33:24] that why why why take up the leftovers
[1:33:26] why not just leave them cuz I'm not fond
[1:33:28] of
[1:33:29] leftovers why not just throw them in
[1:33:31] this in this ocean why why not just
[1:33:34] leave them for the birds God made the
[1:33:36] birds too they have to
[1:33:39] eat but Jesus does it on purpose because
[1:33:43] they actually asked brother brandham
[1:33:44] that question I want to go to Matthew
[1:33:46] 16:6 because when they ask brother Bram
[1:33:49] the question why did they take up the 12
[1:33:51] baskets brother Bram responds with this
[1:33:54] scripture and this is after the miracle
[1:33:57] of the fishes and Loaves it actually
[1:33:58] happened twice but this is after this
[1:34:01] time we're speaking of Jesus said unto
[1:34:03] them talking to his disciples take heed
[1:34:05] and Beware of the leav of the Pharisees
[1:34:07] and the Sadducees and they reasoned
[1:34:09] among themselves saying it's because
[1:34:11] we've taken no bread when Jesus
[1:34:14] perceived he said unto them oh ye of
[1:34:16] little faith why reason you among
[1:34:19] yourselves because you brought no bread
[1:34:21] he wasn't getting on to them for not
[1:34:23] being good
[1:34:24] trustees good deacons whatever are
[1:34:27] providing they said oh no we're out here
[1:34:29] without bread again what are we going to
[1:34:31] do well Jesus said wait a minute each
[1:34:33] one of
[1:34:34] you carried a
[1:34:37] basket of
[1:34:39] leftovers are you with me now weren't
[1:34:42] you in the
[1:34:43] meeting don't you remember you said why
[1:34:46] why can't we just go to the meeting and
[1:34:47] everybody be orderly and everybody be
[1:34:49] nice and smile at each other and Shake
[1:34:50] Hands on the parking lot and leave why
[1:34:52] does God maybe some somebody will take
[1:34:54] off screaming down the aisle somebody
[1:34:55] will shout somebody will worship and and
[1:34:58] sometimes the people will sing and
[1:34:59] something will happen you say why did it
[1:35:01] have to happen like that so you'd
[1:35:03] remember
[1:35:05] it God didn't need your Screaming God
[1:35:07] didn't need your shouting God didn't
[1:35:09] need any of your emotion but he did it
[1:35:11] so you would remember it all right and
[1:35:14] he gave them 12 basketfuls the meeting
[1:35:16] was so good that they went home
[1:35:19] staggering beneath the weight of the
[1:35:22] leftovers all that every church service
[1:35:25] we can get so full of the word of God we
[1:35:27] go home staggering under the influence
[1:35:29] of the leftovers that God poured into
[1:35:32] our
[1:35:33] life oh he said he said do you not
[1:35:36] understand neither remember the five
[1:35:39] lows of the 5,000 and how many baskets
[1:35:42] you took up said do you remember what it
[1:35:44] was like carrying those baskets I'm a
[1:35:48] provider and brother BR said in other
[1:35:50] words like this if you seen God provide
[1:35:52] and do a miracle can't he do a miracle
[1:35:55] again that's why you carried home that
[1:35:57] basket full can't he do a miracle again
[1:36:00] other words like this if he saved you
[1:36:01] from a life of sin can he not heal your
[1:36:04] body don't you remember when you was a
[1:36:06] sinner how he lifted up your soul in
[1:36:08] faith to believe can't he do likewise do
[1:36:11] something great for you again that's why
[1:36:14] he gave you leftovers that's why the
[1:36:17] tears run down your face that's why you
[1:36:18] love him so much that's why you feel
[1:36:20] that tangible presence of God yes wants
[1:36:24] you to remember so you'll have faith to
[1:36:27] believe him for next time sir if there
[1:36:30] will be a next
[1:36:32] time Moses asked for a free will
[1:36:34] offering for the Tabernacle in the
[1:36:36] wilderness the Lord stirred the hearts
[1:36:37] of the people until they brought too
[1:36:40] much you remember that Exodus 367 the
[1:36:43] stuff they had was sufficient for all
[1:36:45] the work to make it and too
[1:36:47] much and God tells Moses tell him to
[1:36:51] stop it's too much
[1:36:54] man that'd be quite an offering wouldn't
[1:36:56] it but
[1:36:57] David it was free will too they weren't
[1:36:59] made to do it God just stirred up their
[1:37:02] hearts but why was it too much remember
[1:37:06] when Caleb and Joshua come into the land
[1:37:08] what' they say they didn't say well I
[1:37:10] think we can do it they said we're more
[1:37:13] than
[1:37:14] able amen a God who could inspire people
[1:37:18] hallelujah to give so much to the
[1:37:21] Tabernacle that they couldn't even use
[1:37:23] it at
[1:37:24] all that same God is big enough to
[1:37:28] provide for us in the wilderness to
[1:37:31] provide for us when we have a need if he
[1:37:33] can stir them up to bring their their
[1:37:35] Free Will offering he can stir them up
[1:37:36] to fight when the fighting is
[1:37:38] needed we're more than able to make it
[1:37:41] oh my we look in the New Testament and
[1:37:43] find Paul said the law entered that the
[1:37:45] offense might abound but we're sin
[1:37:47] abounded Grace did much more abound that
[1:37:49] word is super abound it's super abounded
[1:37:52] Grace Super bounded why it was more than
[1:37:55] enough right not just enough but more
[1:37:57] than than enough yes I want to read this
[1:38:00] with you before we close and as we close
[1:38:02] in Psalms 23:1 he said the Lord is my
[1:38:05] shepherd I shall not want I've carried
[1:38:08] some of them baskets home I know how
[1:38:11] good he
[1:38:12] is I've seen him I've seen him use me to
[1:38:16] kill the bear and to kill the lion I
[1:38:17] know what he can
[1:38:19] do Lord is my shepherd shall not one he
[1:38:23] makes me lie down in Green Pastures he
[1:38:25] leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[1:38:27] restoreth my soul he leads me in the
[1:38:30] paths of righteousness for his name sake
[1:38:32] yay though I walk to the Valley of the
[1:38:35] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[1:38:37] thou art with me but rod and thy staff
[1:38:39] they comfort me thou preparest the table
[1:38:42] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:38:45] thou anointest my head with oil and then
[1:38:49] he doesn't say my cup is full but he
[1:38:52] says my cup runneth
[1:38:55] over more than
[1:38:57] enough oh I wonder if we can believe for
[1:38:59] that kind of blessing today super
[1:39:01] abounding Grace more than enough more
[1:39:04] than we could even ask for or even think
[1:39:07] or even even bring ourselves to ask oh
[1:39:10] more than enough brother BR said what
[1:39:13] takes place when you're filled with God
[1:39:15] musicians go ahead and come he said when
[1:39:16] you're filled with God you're filled
[1:39:18] with the Holy Ghost you're filled with
[1:39:20] power you're filled with love with joy
[1:39:22] with peace with longsuffering with
[1:39:23] goodness with meekness with gentleness
[1:39:25] with worship when you're filled with God
[1:39:27] you're filled with worship you're filled
[1:39:30] with joy oh my David said my cup runneth
[1:39:34] over and if David had a cup running over
[1:39:36] before the Holy Ghost come what would it
[1:39:39] be now amen oh my surely goodness and
[1:39:43] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:39:45] life I will dwell in the house of the
[1:39:47] Lord forever why because he gave me more
[1:39:49] than enough super abundant
[1:39:51] grace I've car home some of the baskets
[1:39:55] I know what it's like if you've never
[1:39:57] done that you need to commit yourself to
[1:39:59] him like the little boy did commit your
[1:40:01] work to him let him make more than
[1:40:03] enough out of it so you can get fed and
[1:40:07] the people will be fed as well how did
[1:40:09] we get fed imagine those people thinking
[1:40:11] like
[1:40:12] that because disciples distributed the
[1:40:17] food because a little boy skip school
[1:40:20] and come to the
[1:40:21] meeting because a a mama oh my a mama
[1:40:27] cooked dinner because a father
[1:40:29] provided how did we get fed they walked
[1:40:33] away and they said we don't know we know
[1:40:36] this those men which had seen the
[1:40:38] miracle that Jesus did said this is of a
[1:40:40] truth that Prophet that should come into
[1:40:42] the world you think about this brother
[1:40:44] random talks about the third third poll
[1:40:47] he said when they come through that
[1:40:48] little room you remember I read you the
[1:40:49] quote here maybe about a year ago he
[1:40:51] said they come through that little room
[1:40:52] off to the side
[1:40:53] he said when they come through he said
[1:40:55] they come in one side crippled when they
[1:40:57] come out they come out healed he said
[1:40:59] they come out screaming and shouting
[1:41:00] come out that little room and then what
[1:41:02] did he say they he said that somebody
[1:41:05] asked the sister that come through said
[1:41:06] what happened in there she said I don't
[1:41:08] know yeah on but I know when I went in I
[1:41:11] was crippled when I come out I was
[1:41:13] healed what was it it was Jesus in the
[1:41:16] room it was more than a man more than a
[1:41:19] prophet more than a church more than a
[1:41:21] pastor it was Jesus in the room amen
[1:41:25] hallelujah oh do you believe he still
[1:41:27] got more than enough for you
[1:41:28] tonight amen let's bow our heads
[1:41:31] together Heavenly Father we're
[1:41:34] so so
[1:41:36] glad that you are more than enough for
[1:41:40] us Lord we commit ourselves into your
[1:41:46] hands sometimes I feel like that little
[1:41:48] boy coming to the church
[1:41:50] service I don't have anything but what
[1:41:52] you give me but Lord I realize I I sit
[1:41:55] there and I try to prepare a sermon and
[1:41:58] it feels just like Five Loaves and two
[1:42:00] fishes to feed a great multitude of
[1:42:04] people Lord people who know this
[1:42:07] message people who who understand and
[1:42:10] need to be fed and I feel like there's
[1:42:11] no way but somehow Lord you multiply the
[1:42:16] efforts oh God lord and now I know these
[1:42:20] other ministers feel the same
[1:42:22] way Lord I pray for every mother here
[1:42:24] today every father for these little
[1:42:27] children Lord for these Disciples of
[1:42:30] yours I pray Lord God you'd help them to
[1:42:33] understand that you can
[1:42:35] multiply their efforts for the kingdom
[1:42:38] of
[1:42:39] God lord and yet also realizing we live
[1:42:42] in a day Lord when even the Greater
[1:42:44] Works would be done that even when
[1:42:46] nothing was done you'd still allow us to
[1:42:48] speak Lord and something would happen
[1:42:52] but Lord I I still want to put in the
[1:42:54] effort because I Love You Lord help me
[1:42:57] to go knowing little boy didn't know
[1:42:59] what was going to happen that day but
[1:43:00] let me go knowing that you are a
[1:43:03] provider Lord I can imagine that if they
[1:43:06] had a meeting the next week all the
[1:43:08] people brought their own lunch because
[1:43:11] they knew that if Jesus could do that
[1:43:13] for one he could do it for them too
[1:43:17] maybe each one of them brought a basket
[1:43:19] with lunch in it and they didn't even
[1:43:21] have to have a miracle because each one
[1:43:23] of them knew that Jesus could provide oh
[1:43:26] I pray that you'd I pray you'd Grant it
[1:43:28] today I pray you'd give us that
[1:43:31] understanding pray for these men Lord
[1:43:33] that work Lord that provide for their
[1:43:35] families Lord I pray you'd help them be
[1:43:37] Jehovah Gyra Lord the provider in their
[1:43:40] lives these mothers Lord providing for
[1:43:43] their children I pray God that you'd
[1:43:46] help them to know you are more than
[1:43:47] enough Lord where we are insufficient

[1:43:52] weakness Lord and when we are weak you
