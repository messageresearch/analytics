unbelief Lord everything that would be according to your word will give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it bless us each now each one in their home where they're at this morning and those that are here helping us I pray that you just speak to us today move me out of the way Lord and may you speak to your people we pray Jesus name Amen amen god bless you you can be seated this morning for a few minutes I wanted to make sure that we were very clear as to the current situation with coronavirus and what lies ahead for us and and make a little announcement Peter if you could turn these monitors down the platform speaker is just a little bit so I want to be very clear about this this morning we've had several families in the church as you know that are quarantined at this time and God bless you this morning if you're watching and maybe you've been stuck at home for a few days and it's an abundance of caution thing as far as we know there's no one in the church that has symptoms of coronavirus or has tested positive for coronavirus but it's just due to potential exposure and it's not just us or several other churches and the message dealing with the same thing this weekend and so we want to make sure that we do the right thing and we'll never be sorry for being careful and so we want to make sure that we are as careful as possible but I wanted to be very clear this morning that we don't have anybody that's tested positive for coronavirus and we've not had any as far as we know no one in the church like that and no one with symptoms but it's just a matter of being very careful because of exposure to someone who did test positive I want those families that are quarantined will be quarantined some of them that ends on Monday the 29th if they go the full 14 days for us as a church it would end this Saturday on the 27th would be the last possible day that there could be any symptoms show up and so we want to make sure that we go through that date so this Wednesday night I had previously invited brother Andrew Glover to come speak for us on Wednesday the 24th and he's agreed to go ahead and come so he's gonna come and preach on the internet so those of you that are watching this morning make sure that you're tuned in on Wednesday night and of course those that can be here will be here and but for most of you you'll be watching and so he's agreed to go ahead and do that service so as of today brother Andrew Glover will be here on Wednesday night and he's coming through the area anyway so I asked him to do that for me and with us moving and and I've been preaching back-to-back services lately and so this would be a big help to me to be able for him to be able to do that and I appreciate him very much for going ahead with that now as I said this will end on Saturday so Saturday night the Lord willing we're gonna have Church and I know some of you have family in a different things and and we'll just work it out whereas many of us can be here as possible Saturday night at 6 o'clock but Aaron McGarry is supposed to be here again that's obviously dependent on him showing up but as far as I know brother Aaron will be here Saturday night and we'll let you know if something changes but that's Saturday night at 6 o'clock we will have Church and everyone is invited to come because as a church will be there maybe some individuals that won't be able to be here but as a church we should be able to be here on Saturday night and so let's do that and then if we have anyone that wants to come from the community or whatever that would be fine as well and then Sunday morning our regular service at 10 o'clock with for the Aaron McGarry and I am looking forward to that it's been a while since I've been able to fellowship with brother Aaron and we're very good friends and and he's been a real friend to me and and and a great preacher of the gospel this message so we want to have him in if we can so this Wednesday brother Andrew Glover will be here but it'll be streaming only Saturday night but the Aaron McGarry will be here but we will be able to have Church as far as we know if nothing changes and then a Sunday morning as well services as I said this weekend will be open to the public and but we will continue to abide by the rules of social distancing as much as possible and that just continues we don't know when that'll end we try not to shake hands we try not COFF on each other and sneeze and and do things like that we've not been passing an offering plate the offering baskets are in the back if you want to wear a mask you're welcome to wear a mask you don't have to too it's not been made a requirement but you're welcome to do that try to maintain when you're seated a little distance between you if it's possible and someone else and the longer we continue to do that if we do those things and we don't have to shut down the church as often and so we want to we want to be able to gather together as much as we possibly can so thank you for your patience I want to say to this church those of you that are watching those of you that are here you're a wonderful group to preach to and so I want to have you sitting in front of me when I preach I mean that's that's my heart but we want to take all the precautions that we can and Peter I'm ringing just a little bit just bring the slider down a little bit I've got Peter back there on the sound he's learning how to do that so so but your wonderful group to preach to and and I'll say this and make sure I want to make sure I'm very clear on this as well I won't promise that we will deal with this the same way every time but we're learning as we go through this and thank you for being understanding god bless you for that every situation is different so if someone gets exposed and if someone in the church would test positive that might change everything and so we can't we don't always know how we'll deal with this and at some point the world's got to learn how to live with it and and we pray there will be a vaccine and that something will come and that we believe God can just get rid of it is brother David said and we believe God can do that we believe you will do that but until then we'll take all the precautions that are necessary and to keep our testimony in the community you love the Lord this morning it's so much easier to say when there's people here you can see if they get it or not but I think those of you that are here understand and and those of you watching if you don't get it go back and listen to it again and I'll try to post as well for those of you on social media so that you'll have that where you can reference it let's stand together and turn to Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 if you haven't learned by now I'm terrible at making announcements so I'm trying to get better at that Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 let's go to the Lord again in prayer just for a moment before we go to the word Heavenly Father were so grateful to be able to come to your word again this morning and we asked you to just touch every heart father wherever they're at this morning I pray that Lord they'll be diligent to listen and Lord I believe there's something that you want to speak to us today father and I pray your spirit would just come in today and and as the word is going forth that it would just settle down and begin to brood over the hearts of the people or to bring out of that seed that's on the inside what what you put in there Lord and that it would be expressed in the right way and I pray that it would be so Lord move me out of the way as we've said and and just speak to your people now we pray as we approach your word in Jesus name Amen amen Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also verse 40 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away that coat let him have thy cloak also verse 41 and whosoever shall compel thee to go to a mile go with him Twain verse 42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you've heard that it it has been said thou shalt love that neighbor and hate thine enemy but I saying do you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you and I want to want you to notice verse 45 that she may be the children of your father which is in heaven and he's not saying that this makes us the children of our Father but he's saying this is how the world will know that were the children of our Father that you may be the children of your father is literally that that you can be like the chil like your father people will know by looking at you that you're like your father and and I think that's appropriate on Father's Day said for he maketh his son to on the evil and on the good sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which in is in heaven it's perfect he says be perfect like your if we say it this way like your daddy is perfect right and this being Father's Day and happy Father's Day to those of you that are watching those of you that are here that are their dads but you can remember as a child if you had a dad that was around that you maybe thought well look at him I can't wait til I get that big I can't wait till I get that level of maturity in my life where I can drive and I can have a bank account I can do all of those things so he says look at God and be perfect like he's perfect be like your daddy and then I want to read one scripture in John 14 18 Jesus speaking to his disciples before he was to leave the earth just this one verse it says I will not leave you comfortless and that word is actually the greek word or Fanus which I won't leave you orphans or I won't leave you without a father I will come to you amen I pray the Lord without his blessing - the word you may be seated this morning have you ever heard someone tell you you remind me so much of your dad some of us hope not but we probably still get it from time to time you remind me so much of your dad and I've gotten that before I did my dad's funeral brother Ivy had come up to that place he told my mom at the funeral he said he said as long as your son's alive your your husband will always live because I look like my dad and you know there's a reason for that because we are our father's children and that's what I titled this this morning my father's children my father's children would be my brothers and sisters right so my father's children when we speak spiritually as all of you but we look like our fathers and we actually according to biology look like our fathers on average not that there could be someone sitting here or listening this morning that looks just like your mom and that's possible but there's a greater possibility that you look just like your dad and this is something that they've recently discovered because nature without human interference as it begins to play out we get 50/50 of our genes from our father and mother but the way those genes are expressed is not 50/50 that we actually are 60% more likely to have traits that are active because you get so many genes you may get a gene that has it's prone to a certain kind of sickness a gene that is prone to a certain type of anxiety a gene that is prone to being nervous or whatever that it is but your brother or your sister may have the same genes but it's not expressed in their life one may have a gene that makes them go bald and you have a brother that has hair or a sister that never had a problem with that you think why would they why would it not be expressed in their life well because the expression is different than just the gene or the DNA that's there but the expression is influenced by other things and so but we are more likely the genes that our father gives us are more likely to express in our lives and if we think about that spiritually I'm so glad that's the case that that the genes that come from our Heavenly Father that given if if we'll let God do what God does in our life that he expresses those so we can say that our father's genes in that way are more dominant they're more able to be expressed and that many people think well it's hard to live a Christian life brother Branham preached on that why it's so hard for some to live a Christian life well it's because they've never really been born again they've never really gotten inside the Holy of Holies if you do you realize your father's genes are more naturally expressed in your life if you're born again then even your natural genes your natural genes are still there but there's something about a Christian that just wants to be like his father or wants to be like her father now so you're 60% more likely to have traits that are active from your dad so you're active DNA you're active genes because nature is a natural preference to express the genes of your father and they call this and we'll go come back to it after a while so I'm not going to talk about DNA and genes all day but it's due to what's called complex epigenetics and epi is that Greek word that just means over and above so you have your genetics and you then you have factors beyond your genetics that influence who you are just to put it in simple terms so your genetics plays a role in the way you look and your eye color and all of those things that it impacts your health and wellness you think about this way if you inherit a severe health condition if you inherit it from your mom you're it's likely to be less severe and science has proven this if you inherit it from your dad it's likely to be more severe and again think of that spiritually just for a moment that he's our Heavenly Father and what we inherit from him the genes that we get is likely to express themselves more so it depends on which side of the family you inherit from you're more likely to inherit stronger genes from your father's side and so I would express to you this morning that you're more able to live the gospel than you think you are because you're the jeans seat of God and if you belong to God then you're likely to express that in your life no as we look at this then that nature comes from God it comes from God it is God and that's our spiritual gene but the RAM says there's only one form of eternal life and that comes from God he said in he for deigned every creature that would ever have it just as you were the gene in your father you as a gene in God one of his attributes to begin with or you'll never be there and so he says you come forth in the bedding ground of your mother your father didn't know you you were in his loins and when you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother then you become a human being and are made in the image of your father he says and now you can fellowship with him and the same thing by God if you've got eternal life and so that's your nature that's who you are but the RAM said the life that you come in the natural life physical life was by your father and this is where it gets tricky because you might say well but then if I express match more clearly the genes of my father what happened when I was in the world well the fact is you didn't express any of the genes of your father before you got saved of your spiritual father no but it doesn't mean that he wasn't there he was there because he said I won't leave you comfortless I won't leave you orphans I won't leave you without he said I will come to you but but he was there even his influence Holy Spirit could influence your life even at a young age but the expression of that gene could only come by the new birth because by your natural birth you have the expression of your natural father's genes so now he says the life that come you came in the natural life physical life was by your father and the only way you can come born again he said has to be from your heavenly Father his attributes all the father has given me will come to me he said you're here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you're a gene spiritual gene out of your heavenly father a part of God's Word oh I'm so grateful for that day what does that mean it means that I couldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be possible for me to fail because God's Word can't fail right but we're talking about that gene seed we're talking about that other me we're not talking about the flesh so we realized that man has a body made from the dust but we have a spirit in the image of God and we have a soul which is the nature of that spirit and allows a man to choose and Genesis 1:27 God created man in his own image and the image of God created him male and female created he them and we know that he created him a spirit man in minute Genesis 2:7 the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life so there you have the the spirit the body and the soul he said and the man became a living soul so it's a spirit man he was a spirit man than he was a flesh man now he's a living soul and we find that in the beginning Adam spirit would have been innocent right it wouldn't have been marred he wasn't his nature was not marred by sin but it was his own nature right but it was not marred by sin it was not corrupted but having a soul give him the ability to make a choice to follow his wife out of the Garden of Eden and because he could do that now that nature become marred and that's the nature that we inherit was from Adam when God made him a living soul when we become a living soul when we come into the earth we get that soul that ability to choose between right and wrong and as we reach a certain level of maturity we're able to choose between right and wrong and we're constantly choosing the wrong because we inherited that nature that's what shows up we're more likely to express the genes of our father our natural father Adam right and so you don't find people just live in perfect lives and doing or living in godly lives or whatever you find people doing everything they can do wrong why because that's your nature when you were born in the world you come in the world that way brother Brown says know the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and this is in souls that are in prison now but the brown goes into a pretty in depth it helps us understand a teaching here on the soul he said the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit he said and then when the nature of man that he said we're dead the scripture plainly tells us we were dead our lives are hidden God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit he said no it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your spirit that died he said see the nature which is the soul he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again and that's why brother Branham tells us in thirst that day and that message thirst is much more deep message than people realize there's much more in that because Branham says that what's you by what you desire you can tell it's on the throne of your heart because that desire comes from the nature of your soul and if you're born again the nature of your soul is God if it's not it's of the world he said anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin he said and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils you become a living soul he said you begin then but the nature that was in you by nature us of the world alienated from God you were actually but the remm says an animal he said anyone knows we're mammal and that's why the scientists today can say well we're just a mammal we're just cousin or whatever to the Apes or whatever that is was true we're just a mammal in our nature in our natural body we come in the world alienated from God we're mammal were warm-blooded animal he said but that is what we are by our earthly creation but you see what made us different from other mammals is that God put a soul upon us he breathed the breath of life but a soul on us he said now the other animals don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us when the only ones it does because we have a soul and so you can see what happen in this hour that people take off clothes and go out naked in the public why animals do that all the time right but people haven't done that until this age why they're just going right back into that they're so deceived by the god of this evil age that they're going right back in where there's no shame again but the realm called it a lust veil that they have over them but but as human beings we have we know when we're naked right and it's proof that we have a salt mine and see he said then see after you've done made man in his own image he created a male and female there was no man to till the soil he put him in the dust of the earth and therefore he said he was that man he said this human man was mammal he was animal but he put this Spirit of God a life into him and he made him on the basis that he could make a choice he said but that soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him he said then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead he said because if you love the world of the things of the world the love of God is not in you see a man must be born again so this nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing there is it never did begin or never can end no we're going to get into this a little bit more but you might think well if that's so then when I'm born again then I'm I do everything right from then on well we obviously know that isn't true just by experience we know that isn't true but the Word of God teaches us that it's not true you do sometimes the things that you hate right and yet at the same time we believe we have the right and the ability and the responsibility to live a Christian life but yet we live we sin and we do things that are wrong and so we have to have a new birth though and Nicodemus comes to Jesus and in John chapter 3 and again Jesus begins to tell him about the new birth and Nicodemus can't understand it and in verse 3 jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and that we know that sister stand you can I'll understand the kingdom of God unless he's born again and that's why Nicodemus was struggling with it and in verse six he said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit and see Nicodemus couldn't understand that he couldn't separate the two my brother branham excuse me for reading this morning but I'm trying to get through this in a way that I don't bore you and also in a way that will get done quickly and that's because I know it's different sitting at home and trying to watch but but the man said you notice you take a woman if she is ever so foul when she becomes a mother a little while before that baby is born there's a kindness about that woman he said you get around her there's always something more she's more tender he said why there's a little angel spirit waiting to receive that natural body now we know that spirit is not an angel perhaps that it is and brother Branham talks about a guardian angel and different things but I think we're speaking here there's a spirit that is not touched by hasn't made any decisions to do wrong and it can't right it can't and so you get to a certain agent you get big like some my kids you get old enough to know when you do wrong right but when you're little you don't know that so it's a little angel spirit it's just a little little spirit has got a spirit but it doesn't have that really ability to make a choice yet so he says there's a little angel spirit waiting to receive that natural body just soon as it's born the breath of life comes into it and God breathes it in there it becomes a living soul he said now just as this baby is being born then the spiritual body is there to receive it he said now in this body and he takes it and types that to our spiritual birth he said when this body has dropped here in this earth like the baby has dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again and that's why Paul said we already have one waiting so brother Branham says this he said we are now in Christ Jesus babies now look we you watch this you grow you you have a baby that's born and it's so cute and I was even the cute baby you can believe that and lots of babies are cute and so you your little in your cute and you can kind of say if I hear all the time while he looks like this one or he looks like that one and I can't ever tell but they're cute regardless so babies are cute or that's what they say anyway and and so babies you know they have certain features and things that are just neat to look at in small features and but as they grow older they may grow up ugly they're likely to grow up in the image of their father but they may grow up in the image of their mother something they grow up they may be they may be horrible looking right we see that evidenced and in many people so but what's happened is they had to mature into what the genes that was in them would become but those genes are not deterministic by themselves but and I want us to understand this this morning and I guess if I'm making any point this morning it's this that it's not our predestination just doesn't cover the gene from God the seed from God that comes in it that's in us at birth that's predestinated that's that's before time that was in his mind but it also is the nurture of that seed even before were saved and after we're saved if we could say it this way he's a good dad he's a good father he knows what he's doing and I'm grateful for that because I needed help I believe I'm a seed of God I believe you're a seed of God but we needed help we needed to be able to express something beyond our natural abilities we need to be able to express something beyond the culture that we live in we need to be able to express something beyond just what we would be naturally and so God doesn't just dump us in the earth and put a gene seed in us but he also nurtures that seed and he also controls and even plans our life in such a way so that we're at the right place at the right time under the right atmosphere hearing the right word so that we can that seed can become what he wants it to be because it is not just our nature and there's always been the argument in genetics is it nature or nurture but they found it's not really an argument at all because it takes both because of epigenetics because you're not just your genes but also the things that are influenced those genes can be influenced to express themselves at different times and again we know that's true because we did things that God would never do right we did things that God would never do because we're human we were in the image of Adam but yet that seat gene laid there and wasn't expressed but it had to come to a place of expression no some other man said we are now in Christ Jesus babies babes in Christ children of God waiting for the full deliverance that the coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us up and to himself when this body this mortal will take on immortality what do you do with the baby you watch over you constantly are there and Gian God being our father and also our mother if we could say it that way here he's our spiritual parent he comes in and takes care of us he nurtures us he brings us up to the place where we should be now what they found with epigenetics has set these these gene expressions change expressions change based on what we go through now what they've done is they've taken mice and they they make a mice a mouse some ice they make a mouse afraid of something right so what they'll do is they'll take a they'll take a a certain chemical that smells a certain way and they'll introduce that into the cage and every time they introduce that in the cage they shock the mouse and I know some of you are thinking you'll never get past this thing you'll never hear what I'm saying because all you think about is the poor Mouse but but they take the that sweet smell and then they they shocked the mouse and every time he smells that they train him to be afraid of it they train him that that's associated with that just like you train a puppy or anything else so the mouse is trained but what's funny is once he's afraid of it he passes that fear along not by behavior because you can that Mouse if you the father can have children and those children those baby mice grow up already afraid of that smell even though they've never seen or never been shocked and they've never seen him be shocked but he was shocked by it now think back and you think how this works just in your natural life you take someone that maybe had some traumatic event in their life and it shaped them so much that they found it actually impacts their DNA their genes so that they passed that fear along to their children and with us I guess the most common thing with with us purchases we're scared of the water just afraid of the water and I have no reason to be afraid of the water but my dad was afraid of the water and my dad never knew why he was afraid of the water and dad would and dad's going on to be with the Lord now but but he would get out you know he'd get in one foot of water and he just thought he was drowning I mean you could you could you he almost drowned in a bathtub he took a shower because he he was afraid of water and I have a hard time all of us have had a hard time learning to swim some of us can swim but it's been difficult because it just seems like it's passed on and we don't know why at some point it's on some level and it may have been a grandfather because what they found is these genes don't just pass through the children but to the grandchildren of the mice that they actually are continued to be afraid of that smell because and if something they can explain it's just who they are it's their genes because what it did is that mouse had a certain gene now to be afraid and it passed it on now the the gene that was the what made them afraid was already there but that actual problem that actual shock caused that to express and then it went on down to the kids so it's not just the genes that go down but the expressions that's why it matters what we do it matters what we do it matters how we treat our children matters whether we go to church or not you know my dad was always faithful to go to church and that's one thing and there were other things he wasn't so faithful in but going to church that was always something he did and for me it's never been a problem I've always been in church and that's that's and it goes on through generations I've seen it and unfaithful people the same way it works the same way you just can't hardly seem to make yourself go to church and you don't know why but it's just passed on but thank God we have the nature of God to overcome those things but now there is in these mice they found that if you take the same mouse that's got this depressed gene or anxious gene and then I'm mice that are depressed believe it or not it's just in their DNA to be depressed there are mice that are anxious we have a dog that struggles with depression and if you've ever had the dog it's the real thing dog just gets depressed if the kids aren't around he just depressed he just has a really hard time he won't eat when the kids aren't around he's so anxious that you could leave him for a week and he won't eat nothing because he just it'll get as skinny as a rail because he's afraid he's anxious when they're not around and so he struggles with that and there's actually they can get prozac to dogs because of that and so human beings are that way as well but we tend to pass those things on to our children but what they found is if you take that mouse and just give it the utmost care and just really treat it right as a baby it'll be less likely to exhibit that anxiety then its father was even though the genes are still there and I want to tell you this morning as God has a way of bringing people into our lives and things and yes there'll be hardships there will be trials but there will be times when God brings fathers into our lives mother's different ones to nurture us along so that those genes that are expressed would only be the right ones God knows that so brother Branham even talks about he would he would bring your mother and father together or your grandmother and grandfather together and then your mother and father God caused that to happen just so is it did but if he did that then he also caused maybe your grandfather to leave a certain place at a certain time go into a certain area of the country to be influenced by a certain type of preaching or a certain type of thing maybe they were just worldly people but they were influenced by certain things to make you what you are today and God not only controls your natural DNA but he controls that as well he doesn't just control your nature but he controls your nurture now so that's important and I think just as a side note it's important that we manage those things in our lives especially as fathers this being Father's Day a special day for us melody said it's Father's Day she said we can make daddy work I said no that's what daddy does every other day she thought of since it was Father's Day we were going to have we were gonna work real hard but you know that's that's just you know being father today we want to make sure that we that we manage these things in our lives because we can pass that on the strongest gene that there is that the father passes on to his children is not even hair loss or anything like that it's actually depression that's the gene that's most likely to express in your children is depression so we need to be careful with that and really come under and overcome those things because if we don't we're pulling pass that on to our children but think the Lord they have a an atonement as well aren't you glad for a savior today because you get into these things you begin to think well I've just planned to be what I am nobody but God planned you to be what you are and to be born again and to express those genes that he gave you now when you were born in this world you were born in sin shaped in iniquity the nature of your spirit was ungodly yet you were already being nurtured by God amen brother Brown says you know you grew from your birth when you was born he says and presented into this world God knew that you were going to be here in this earth and you grew from birth to maturity things that seem so strange to you and your young womanhood young boyhood as children now seems very real you couldn't understand it when you was a child but now is you become adult you begin to in and find out that everything was just set just right he said in you it really means something to you now so it is in your spiritual birth I must have not given that to them but just listen closely he said you do things that you don't understand he said then you're a little baby come to the altar you give your life to Christ you do such strange things you wonder why you did it but after a while you mature then you understand it he said see there something picks up you see why you had to do it your spiritual birth he says your natural birth types are spiritual I don't know when we're gonna get out because I didn't give them all the quotes said how it fitted to you in this life issue grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that he said wasn't it a strange thing the night she staggered into the mission the tip meeting a little church somewhere on the corner something the preacher preached on a certain subject you just fell right at the altar see God knew that before the foundation of the world it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand amen and he says you knew what happened it's so fitting to you in this life and will be also in the life that is to come in this world and it's life seems to advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you and that's exactly the way it is with us when it comes to God now I want us to look at Psalm chapter 139 and I hope I gave you that Slom chapter 139 and verse 1 I want us to look at this because I probably took those out yes I probably took those out just to save time go to verse 9 you know David explains to us that God is there no matter where we are and he says if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea he says even there shall I hand lead me my right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night should be light about me so he's saying God nurtured me through my life he was always there he was a good father hey man he says in verse 12 you a the darkness hide us not from me but the night show today the darkness and the light are both alike to thee now he goes back and he says for that was possessed my reins and what that means is it would have been the Jewish equivalent or the Hebrew equivalent of your DNA your inner workings of your body you possessed my reins that was covered me in my mother's womb in other words you you protected me even the way that I was made even as the genes started to come together you protected me in my mother's womb so he's using on one side he's saying you nurtured me here I was wherever I go if I make my bed in hell whatever that it is you're with me and the reason is because you've always been with me you possessed my rage you covered me in my mother's womb he said I will praise thee I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are that works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth nine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in other words I wasn't complete but you saw it so when you were that first germ in your in your mother's womb he said you saw me though I was some perfect I wasn't completely formed in that book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them how precious all sort I thought son to me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them there are more numbers than the sand when I awake I would still with thee so he is not only our father in that we all get our eternal genes from him and and I'm afraid sometimes we treat him like an absentee father that we think well God was with me and and he gave me a seat of God and now it's up to me to do all the rest no he's with us now he protects us now he comforts us now he nurtures us now he's still our Father and he's not an absentee father he doesn't that's the way of the serpent is to father children and then leave it's true that's what the serpent did but it's not what God does God takes care of his children hey man and so he is our Father he nurtures us everyday to express those genes that are right in our life just like you do your children because you know your children are gonna be like you and so you've been through some things and so you tell him no don't be like that you try to model something different maybe even than the way you were race but see God don't make no mistakes so what does he do he says be like me be like me he come down and wrapped himself in a robe of flesh with a Joel walked among us on the earth and he said follow me be like me why because he he was our Father and he come down among us and when he become a son when the father wrapped himself in the body of flesh to become a son he looked back at the other sons and said be like me hey man why because he was the father perfectly expressed are you with me this morning he was the father perfectly expressed and I'm you that are online you say man if you're with us this morning as well I'm being kind of hard on these that are here because I know you can only say Amen so many times and there's just a few of us but you know what we have a good father and our father we get our eternal genes from him but he also nurtures those expressions in our life to cause us to become more like him in Genesis 1 it talks about how the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you see the seeds were already there we could say like his children it was already there in the earth but the Spirit of God had to move on and that word is to brood on it we preached on it before how that he broods over it like that like an eagle or hen would over its chicks he he moves it he turns it he causes a movement to come on the face of the waters now brother Branham and condemnation by representation teaches us how that we are represented by Adam of sinners that's our natural DNA or natural genes he said now to you to say that it's wrong for you to be represented by Adam as a sinner what about through representation we have salvation also he said you can no more save yourself then you could take your bootstraps jump over the moon with it you're born in sin you're a renegade to start with every one of us we could not help ourselves how are we ever going to be saved one come to represent us aren't you glad that he did this morning Jesus he come to represent us before God as Sunnis listen he come to represent us before God as sons and daughters of God amen we were represented in him and what was he that perfect expression of the genes of God he was the perfect expression both by nature and by nurture Amen because the Bible said he even learned or he he actually learned obedience assess by the things that he suffer he said how could that be God caused nurtured those genes to be expressed he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased oh my he was the gene seat of God we're the gene seat of God but he came to represent us before God as sons and daughters of God and he sent His Holy Spirit now that he's brooding over the place that's what he wants to do to our church that's what he wants to do in your home he wants to brood over you he wants to he wants to cause an atmosphere to come to nurture you in the right direction he wants to spend time with you oh my and that's what so many does we leave time for everything else but he wants to spend time with us just like we want to spend time with our children he wants to spend time with us amen and he come to brood over us to trying to bring us back to birth to die to ourselves to be reborn again to be sons and daughters of God to take God at His Word to believe God's Word listen he can brood he can come we know that the Holy Spirit comes all over the earth and the tear and the wheat and all rejoice in it but it only it only expresses the genes of God when that gene seed that predestinated seed is their brother man tells us wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes hey man you had to be he said if you ever if you got eternal life it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation the world knew that you would be here he said a window water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being he said now you have fellowship with your father God Justice you have with your earthly father said see you are citizens of the King you are not citizens that you were children sons and daughters of the Living God amen so not just citizens but we are children if it be that the eternal life twelves in you what do we do to children we teach the children and this I want to tell you this because I don't want you to be discouraged God's teaching us something you look at the coronavirus and the things that have happened God's teaching us something he said what you didn't respond like this other pastor did well God's teaching us something like teaching us something and sometimes we do right sometimes we do wrong but God's teaching us something it were sons and daughters of the Living God and so we have to be taught we have to be teachable if we could say it that way Galatians 4 and 1 and you can go read the rest of this but I'll just read the first two verses to save time he says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant and though he be Lord of all but it's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father and that's what we want to come to but we know that this flesh doesn't come to that until we have a new body that's that's the full adoption if you could say it that way yet we can come to a place of maturity as Christians now we look at this and he's under tutors and governors who is the tutor and you remember Mary was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and Jesus and and but the RAM uses that as the type that he said that if Mary was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost who was the father right it had to be the father had to be the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the father it's one God and so if the Holy Ghost is the tutor who's the tutor the father the father actually comes down in the form of the Holy Ghost and becomes tutor what better tutor kids you have what better teacher could you have than your heavenly father in Galatians 4:6 tells us because your sons go out a sip forth the spirit of his son into your heart because your sons and we've talked about that before but that's the ultimate identification that you are a gene seat of God is to receive the token to receive the Holy Ghost because if you if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost you have to be a gene seat of God you could have the Holy Ghost on your flesh every day of your life and die and go to hell but if you ever get sealed by the Holy Ghost you are gene seat of God you can't be lost anymore than God could be lost so we find because your sons god sent forth the spirit of his son so Jesus says he says I'm gonna send you a comforter and then he says I will not leave you or fat off I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a man he wraps himself in he changes his mask to another another we could say another part or another office of who he is and he comes down and dwells within us to express in our lives the gene seed of God he doesn't just leave us to our own devices he's also our tutor I've never seen a day like today when parenting was so hands off and excuse me for being an old fogey just for a minute but every time you go to the grocery store and somebody is asking their kid and making a deal with them to keep them from grabbing all the candy on the shelf that bothers me that really bothers me I don't make deals with my kids well not all the time anyway but you know you don't you don't just sit there and and and negotiate with the two-year-old right the two-year-old has to be taught it needs to be taught needs a father it needs a mother we thank God for mothers but it needs a daddy need somebody be able to step in and say no right needs the parents to be able to step in and do something for them but in this age we just let them do what they want to when you let them do what they want to and they end up on the street somewhere in Portland OR Seattle and making their own little country and and burning stuff that's what comes when you leave them to their own devices right but they but God give us father's for a reason hey man God give us father's for a reason impulsive sometimes your father would even for his own pleasure punish you in other words cuz he could just got mad but God doesn't do that God works in her lives and knows exactly what we have need of amen and he says that in Romans 8:26 now this is the spirit Paul is addressing both sides of it this is the spirit working in our lives that's the predestination working in our lives the Holy Ghost working in your life is predestination working that makes sense it's predestination working we look at those it's two different things but we are predestinated to become the sons of God and to predestination working in your life as the Holy Spirit working in your life Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities or our weaknesses for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered you ever been to the store with your kids and they want certain things but you know that's not the best thing for them so what do you do you steer them towards a different aisle you steer them towards a different product because you're gentle with them but you want them to know that that's not what you need what you need is in the fruit aisle not in the candy aisle right so you steer them in the right direction don't you know that's what God has been doing brother David all of our lives he's been steering us in the right direction he'd been leading us through the aisles of life and he walks down through life with us and every time we would go for the candy we would go for something we didn't need he'd steer us in the right direction he just rebuked us just a little bit sometimes he'd spank us sometimes we get on just real good because he needed us he wanted us to go in the direction so that we could be the expressed image of God the spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered sometimes my kids want to order for themselves and I translate for them I want the the number one special whatever it is with all that innocent know what he wants is a grilled cheese with french fries why because sometimes you know what's the best in it but watch as they get older you trust them more right you trust them more that's what God is doing with us that's what he did with job we got to job was a man it was perfect before God he did everything right it seemed like but God said I'm gonna trust him a little more let some trials come in let some things come in and and let him realize and Satan come in his life and did everything he could but he still wouldn't curse God and die even though his wife told him to he still wouldn't do it why because he'd become a mature Son of God and God allowed that trial to mature him that much more the more trials you have the more things you go through it's just God trusting you but the spirit itself makes intercession for us so we groan but we don't know what we're growing for but he knows verse 27 he who searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and you could take this back and I don't wanted to take much more time but you could take this back to David and you could you could look at David's life and you could see how that he grown in himself and he said my hands and feet they pierced my hands and feet he didn't even know what he was talking about but what was there was a spirit making intercession the spirit in his life and David and we look at the things that are going on our life we think well there's no purpose to my anxiety to the to my struggles in life to the things I go through but there's a purpose in it because we don't even know what it's for but he's already working for our own good and he says that he deserted the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose verse 29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son notice how it reads he said whom he foreknew he also did predestinate I must have took quite a bit of this out so we could be faster but I left it in my notes so we'll be all right whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be what the first war among my father's children the first one he could be the example he could be the our type before God he could be our representation before God the firstborn of many brethren amen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called him he called him he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified and he says what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he despair not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things we have within us the genes of our father and mother and they're passed down from fallen Adam and Eve what we want is the genes of God and so sometimes we'll say something we shouldn't say we'll get angry when we shouldn't will react in a way that we shouldn't and you just think oh god oh god why did I have to do that I don't want to be like that I want to be like my perfect father to be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect I want to be like my perfect father but brother man taught us that alike Elijah's robe didn't fit Elijah the first time he put it on he put it on was too big and brother Brown said God didn't change the Rope to fit Elijah but he changed Elijah to fit the rope so by the time he got done following the prophets ministry but the time he got done Elijah's robe fit a light or Elijah's robe fit Elijah just right but the best thing you've got to alter yourself to meet God's Holy Spirit you've got to alter yourself to meet God's Holy Spirit God won't alter the spirit to meet your desire but you've got to alter yourself so what the Bible says Elijah had several years of growing to fit the rope oh my now when I don't know whether I get for the rest of this or not but I just want to go through a couple more quotes and then we'll close brother Bram says I hope the words not boring you and that's true this morning as well he said born Christians listen closely grow into the stature of Christ as they live but you've got to be born first you've got to be born again you must be born again because until you're born again you don't grow but the day you're born again didn't born Christians grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby and we think why did this have to happen in my life it's God maturing us but he said their lives begin to shape like a baby it takes form and begins to grow first thing you know here they are in the full stature there you are day after day and see this is different from anything Pentecost taught from anything denominations taught because they taught well you're born again you're saved and then praise God you ready for the rapture but he said you grow into it you grow into the full stature of a son of God there you are day after day year after year they stayed the same he said now come back to the word if you abide in me brother Brent says they say I got born again hallelujah I joined them I joined this I joined I don't know last year I believed in Jesus name now I backed it out I believe this I did believe you had to be holy he said they're Wanderers tossed about with every wind of doctrine but be born of the Spirit and grow into the stature of Christ and brother man teaches us very clearly and yet and many message circles were taught that you have to grow into the birth that's not what you grow into you're born in the spirit and grow into the stature of Christ and those things are present in you but you increase those things he said you're growing into the stature of Christ though you're through your life he said it proves like if you were born a prophet you'll remain that if you were born a Christian you'll remain that if you abide in me and my words abide in you this grows you up into the stature of Christ he said not some young lawyer beating screaming crying and brother Brennan was making reference to a story that he told about a young lawyer who couldn't win the case because he's just the most but it took a seasoned attorney who who knew the facts of the case and presented them calmly but I been typeset to being born again really born against someone who's seasoned in the Word of God and someone who just has emotions so he said not some young law you're beating screaming crying tell you this out of the other make a lot of emotions but somebody who's grown into the stature of Christ through the years have seasoned out and proved standing at the helm he said no other on Christ the solid rock we've stand all other ground is sinking sand let denominations and creeds come go let isms keep me humble hard stay right with the word and move right on through the stream is that your prayers this morning she'll guide us to the shore he said that's full stature meant I don't know if that's a word but I think we know what he means fall statute when we grow up into the fullness of the measure of Christ the Branham says this is a dying spirit in a dying body and now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two natures in you at one time he said know the nature of the Spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born a physical like the baby was but what's happened the spiritual birth has come to you while the spiritual birth is growing into your heart of God there is a physical or a celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body it goes to that body just as when the body is presented to the earth the Spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body there is a body waiting for we know that after this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting what is he doing he's nurturing us all through life and we get down to the end of life and sometimes we think well I just don't know what he's doing and sometimes even at the end of life as people grow older we deal with things like Alzheimer's you deal with sicknesses and I know there's people that are just ready to go home and some that aren't even cognizant in any more of what's going on and you think why would God leave them in the body that way got to be some level of maturity he's reaching in that person we don't understand it they don't even understand it but he's he's doing something to express the gene seed of God even in that moment of weakness where they may not even know who they are and that's why we don't just go out and pull the plug on everybody God knew how long they would live God knew all about it maybe they live and suffer for years and we don't understand it but the moment that that spirit passes on the spirit goes out of the body there's a body waiting amen well I'm ready for that full adoption I'm ready for that but evidently he thinks I got more time to mature we think we're ready and I believe that we are we see the things going on around us we're ready for a rapture but God has some more maturing for us to do how can we be our father's children he and that's what we read when we started out he said if you love your neighbour you treat your enemies like your friends love your enemies that's hard to do said but if you do you'll be your father's children you have these fruits to the spear in your life you'll be your father's children how can you be your my father's children your father's children by letting the Holy Spirit brood over your life how do you do that you pray you read your Bible you go to church you give God time in your life don't get frustrated because you see things in your life that shouldn't be there - well I'll just quit church until it gets right know you'll never mature you just keep coming keep immature and keep working keep hearing the word until those things begin to be weeded out of your life until that God that seeing you that gene seed of God grows into what it's supposed to be and then you begin to express the things that God wanted you to express if the musicians would come with our heads together wherever you're watching and I know I've forgotten at times to acknowledge you that are watching this morning but I know that you're there and wherever you are maybe you can just bow your head where you are in your home or wherever that it is if we could play Amazing Grace if maybe you've just not expressed what you want to express in your life you don't understand what's going on God wants to express himself in your life but you just surrendered to him more fully this morning take a few minutes and let the Holy Spirit brood over your life you might think well I got things to do I've got work today I've got a Father's Day thing going on something's going on but would you just take a moment let the Holy Spirit atmosphere matters it matters we come to church for a reason we be gathered together for a reason because it matters that were under those wings we want to be under those wings but he said I'll never leave you and ever I'll never forsake you and so where you're at today he's there even if it's just you watching this morning he's there he's he's with you maybe you'll watch this later on but he's still there with you he wants to guide you and lead you he wants to express those scenes in your life maybe you that gene of anxiety was passed on from your parent that gene of depression those things that are passed on would you just let God come in and and let the gene seed of God begin to overpower those things that begin to silence those genes that are speaking through your life of fear and depression and and ungodliness and let the gene seat of God begin to grow in your life in the way that it should be would you just pray that way this morning maybe you don't fully understand but you say help me Lord to become your child that's what it's all about is becoming your child to be the children of our Heavenly Father Heavenly Father we thank you for father's day or just another day here on the earth maybe one not as important as Mother's Day too many today we think of you as our Heavenly Father oh god we've had fathers of the earth and they didn't always do what they were supposed to all of us fail at some point or another maybe father's listening this morning maybe had some conviction in their life because they've let things display in their life that aren't right but Oh God but you just move Lord in our lives and nurture us today we want to be good obedient children we want that tutor to be able to report back and say you just like you I pray you've granite Lord God we want to come into that full adoption in our lives Lord so we can sign the checkbook and to be just you signing it we're so grateful for that Lord where we've not matured and we might say well Lord I've come to that place but as long as you're here there's room for that seed to grow and express itself in your life I pray you've granite Lord God I pray it would just move and express the things of God in our lives express love and peace and joy long-suffering in all of these things grandfather's brother Andrew comes Wednesday night Lord I pray you'd give him a special unction to preach knowing it's it's harder on a minister when there's not very many here but be many watching Lord and I pray God that you would just move on our brother Lord if it's your will for him to come father that he would come and that he would be able to preach freely also for this weekend Lord the things that are going on I pray you would bless it Lord we we need to be revived in our spirits but we know it won't come just by emotion but it comes by your words so we pray father that you would just move in our lives during this week whatever it is that you'd have for us Lord it but the Aaron would come and you'd be your will for him to come Lord this week for a that he would just speak something that would speak to that seed gene in our lives and we could become
