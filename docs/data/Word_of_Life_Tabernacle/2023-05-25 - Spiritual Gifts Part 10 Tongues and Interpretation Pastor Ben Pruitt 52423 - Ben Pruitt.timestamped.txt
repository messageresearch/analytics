[36:19] that expectation
[36:22] oh I
[36:24] love that man in the middle
[36:32] [Music]
[36:33] because I know that he first
[36:39] loved me
[36:43] we're singing Praise to them
[36:51] that much Calvary
[36:56] made it possible
[37:00] that I could go free

[37:17] [Music]
[37:23] of me
[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] praise
[37:37] foreign
[37:39] [Music]
[38:04] in a supernatural realm and for you to
[38:08] help us to recognize that or to get out
[38:11] of the natural just long enough to to
[38:13] enter in Lord Where Angels are present
[38:16] and Lord and gifts are here and and the
[38:19] word is being preached Lord may we
[38:21] receive in that realm today or that'll
[38:24] help us in the natural realm to live our
[38:26] lives I pray you'd grant that today Lord
[38:29] I pray you'd heal every sick person
[38:30] every every
[38:32] been presented Lord or that's on the
[38:34] hearts of the people I pray that you'd
[38:36] meet it tonight and we're believing and
[38:38] trusting that you will in Jesus name
[38:41] amen
[38:43] amen
[38:44] bless you tonight turn with me to First
[38:46] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10. this is
[38:49] uh the last of our regular installment
[38:52] on the gifts we may do one more for with
[38:55] some questions just kind of wrap it up
[38:57] uh in here in a week or two but this is
[39:01] the last of the gifts I hope you've
[39:03] learned something more than that I hope
[39:06] that you have a desire to to know God in
[39:09] such a way that and to be so close to
[39:12] him that these things would operate in
[39:14] your life if that's what would please
[39:15] him amen that's what we want we can't
[39:17] teach people to have gifts but we do
[39:19] want to know what they are and we want
[39:21] God to be able to do whatever God wants
[39:23] to do I want to say happy anniversary
[39:25] brother Danny and sister Vicki as well
[39:28] God bless you guys I I can't imagine
[39:30] being married 55 years I just
[39:33] just beyond me
[39:35] but Jeremy's right there with me tonight
[39:38] anyhow but it just seems like a long
[39:40] time but I tell you what I can't even
[39:42] imagine being alive 55 years at this
[39:45] point in my life
[39:46] but uh but you all are just such an
[39:48] example to us and many of you don't know
[39:51] brother Danny is a reason why I'm here
[39:54] part maybe the biggest reason and the
[39:57] Lord had showed him and uh and talked to
[40:00] him and that's uh that means something
[40:02] you know something we might not think
[40:04] people are too spiritual but when a
[40:05] crisis time comes and then we find out
[40:07] where real spirituality is and so we're
[40:10] thankful for brother Danny and sister
[40:11] Vicki God bless you guys may this be the
[40:14] best year yet maybe this will be the
[40:16] year of the coming of the Lord and get
[40:18] to see our loved ones and wouldn't that
[40:20] be wonderful be wonderful for all of us
[40:23] First Corinthians 12 and 10 to another
[40:25] the working of Miracles to another
[40:28] prophecy to another Discerning of
[40:31] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[40:33] tongues to another the interpretation of
[40:36] tongues I want to talk tonight about
[40:38] tongues and interpretation for the Lord
[40:40] but that is blessing to the word you may
[40:42] be seated
[40:45] I'll be away this weekend brother
[40:46] Stewart will speak we'll just have a
[40:48] Sunday morning service
[40:50] as well
[40:53] there may be people who we fellowship
[40:56] with and and that in the message that
[41:00] know a lot more than I do that handle
[41:03] tongues and interpretation differently
[41:05] than what I want to handle it tonight
[41:06] and that's okay that that's the
[41:09] sovereignty of the local church I would
[41:12] say that these are non-salvation issues
[41:15] in the sense that I'm not going to break
[41:17] off Fellowship from somebody because
[41:19] they handle tongues differently than we
[41:21] do I'll say this anytime you have a
[41:23] church order there is an order and then
[41:26] brother Branham tells us he said you
[41:27] need to get out of order long enough to
[41:29] get saved so there's always going to be
[41:32] some things that happen and you're going
[41:34] to be around gifts and I'll say this
[41:37] especially for the young people we
[41:38] should always respect the gifts we
[41:42] should never disrespect a gift even if
[41:44] the person that has the gift is not
[41:47] maybe the kind of person we would think
[41:49] would be a good person maybe or a saved
[41:52] person or or a follower of the message
[41:55] and brother Branham talked about a woman
[41:57] with cut hair and makeup and that would
[42:00] that would get up stand up in the church
[42:02] and give a tongues and interpretation he
[42:05] said we shouldn't we should try to work
[42:07] with that woman and realize that it may
[42:09] be the presence of God it may be a real
[42:11] gift even though her life isn't right
[42:14] and and so we need that and and we need
[42:17] to work with people like that and we're
[42:19] Branham worked with other churches in
[42:22] his area that leave the message but they
[42:24] didn't believe uh in gifts and the way
[42:27] that he treated them in the church and
[42:29] they they did it differently and so
[42:31] that's okay but I would say for us I
[42:33] want to follow the example of a prophet
[42:35] and try to treat these things the way
[42:38] that he did and that's just the very
[42:40] best I think that we can do so we don't
[42:42] want to make division but we want to
[42:44] stay with the word of God is that what
[42:46] you want to do and so there's no we
[42:49] don't want any seed of discrepancy we we
[42:52] don't want anything shadowy coming in we
[42:54] we want the word of God
[42:56] so there is a true gift of tongues and
[43:00] and it's hard today because it's been
[43:02] such a mockery made of tongues and
[43:04] interpretation because you can go on
[43:06] YouTube and you can find all kinds of
[43:09] people speaking in tongues almost
[43:11] everybody does it today there are major
[43:14] uh Christian singers who'll speak in
[43:16] tongues while they sing there are
[43:18] preachers who will stop and speak in
[43:20] tongues while they preach and and it
[43:22] doesn't seem to mean anything but again
[43:24] we want to be careful with that and and
[43:26] recognize that each man has to answer to
[43:29] God for themselves and we need to answer
[43:31] to God for what we're responsible for
[43:34] tonight now there is a real gift of
[43:37] tongues we don't want the Scarecrow to
[43:39] to scare us away from the reality of
[43:43] what God is able to do in our midst and
[43:46] we need God to work in our midst we we
[43:49] need God we need a supernatural element
[43:51] to our worship it can't be just just us
[43:55] doing what we do and and becoming a
[43:58] church of we say word only which is good
[44:01] but it has to be anointed by the spirit
[44:04] there has to be some Dynamics with the
[44:07] mechanics that we have in order to make
[44:09] God to manifest himself Among Us that's
[44:12] what we want we want him to do that
[44:15] and so we want to we want the real we
[44:18] need the real amen
[44:20] so now in the scripture there's two
[44:22] different kinds of tongues mentioned and
[44:26] and that's the tongues what's tongues of
[44:28] men or languages and then there are tons
[44:31] of angels
[44:33] and or unknown tongues but Brandon
[44:36] mentions those he said now we know
[44:37] there's two different kinds of tongues
[44:39] mentioned in the bible one of them is
[44:41] language that is a dialect of the earth
[44:43] so in other words it would be German or
[44:45] it would be Spanish or it would be a
[44:48] Korean it would be some language that's
[44:50] known of the Earth
[44:52] and on the other he said it's an unknown
[44:54] tongue and again he said now tons of
[44:57] angels is when a man's praying to him
[44:59] and God Alone he said but when he's
[45:02] speaking a language it's to be
[45:04] interpreted in the church for
[45:06] edification of the church Paul
[45:09] identifies these two different types of
[45:11] tongues he said though I speak with the
[45:13] tongues of men and of angels and have
[45:16] not charity I've become that was a
[45:18] sounding brass or tinkling symbol so
[45:20] he's identifying there's two different
[45:21] kinds and he identifies this tongue of
[45:24] angels as an unknown time let's go to
[45:27] First Corinthians chapter 14 and I want
[45:29] to dwell on this chapter tonight as much
[45:33] as we can you know bear with me I'm
[45:35] still struggling with my voice a little
[45:36] bit but it's better than it was thank
[45:38] the Lord for that
[45:41] we're all just struggling a little bit
[45:43] tonight brother Joel I tell you what
[45:45] it's just
[45:46] it's a Wednesday night isn't it
[45:48] but we're still serving God we're still
[45:51] at our post to duty
[45:53] so in First Corinthians chapter 14 he
[45:55] says follow after charity or Love and
[45:58] Desire spiritual gifts but rather that
[46:01] you may prophesy so he's saying uh if
[46:04] you want to have a spiritual gift the
[46:06] best spiritual gift is the speaking of
[46:09] the word or prophecy he said for either
[46:12] speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh
[46:15] not unto men but unto God for no man
[46:18] understandeth him how be it in the
[46:20] spirit he speaketh Mysteries but he that
[46:24] prophesies speaketh unto men to
[46:26] edification and exhortation and comfort
[46:29] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[46:31] edifieth himself but he that prophesieth
[46:34] edifieth the church now we know that a
[46:38] person can speak in tongues in fact we
[46:40] could all tonight an atmosphere of God
[46:42] could settle down here on the building
[46:45] and and we could all be just so caught
[46:47] up into that and honestly I think
[46:49] sometimes we need that but we need that
[46:52] in our in our home because we need that
[46:54] and when we're praying through just by
[46:56] ourselves and it could be such an
[46:58] atmosphere in this place that every one
[46:59] of you might begin to speak in in
[47:02] tongues and but you're not edifying the
[47:04] person beside you you're not edifying
[47:06] the church you're edifying yourself
[47:09] and I don't say that there would
[47:11] necessarily even be any harm in that but
[47:14] I would say the best place to do that
[47:16] would be at home when you're in your
[47:18] prayer time and Billy Brown talks a
[47:19] little bit more about that as we go
[47:21] along now what if someone let's take
[47:25] this just to kind of illustrate the
[47:27] difference between tongues of men and
[47:29] tongues of angels and talking about
[47:31] tongues of angels what if someone spoke
[47:34] in tongues but and it was in the proper
[47:37] order maybe they they did it before the
[47:40] service in a separate service but no one
[47:43] interpreted it there was people with the
[47:45] gift of interpretation there but there
[47:48] was no interpretation it would not be an
[47:51] edification to the body so brother
[47:53] random he presents that question he said
[47:56] he might have a real gift of speaking in
[47:58] tongues but he hasn't got the gift of
[48:00] tongues a language
[48:02] right so there's a difference
[48:05] and so he goes into the motive and
[48:08] objective of the man the hypothetical
[48:11] man if we could say it that way that
[48:13] that's would speak in tongues because if
[48:15] he's got the right motive and objective
[48:17] he's not going to sit there and say well
[48:18] these people refuse to to translate my
[48:21] my tongue so there must be they must not
[48:24] like me or or this church just isn't a
[48:26] spiritual church that's not what it
[48:28] would be at all but he said if he's
[48:30] sweet and humble and says well maybe the
[48:32] Lord didn't want to use me in his
[48:34] service but yet he he just blesses my
[48:37] soul he wants to edify me to know that
[48:39] I'm close to him when I speak in tongues
[48:42] he said so I'll walk out in the apple
[48:44] orchard
[48:46] now there's sometimes there are some
[48:49] gifts that need to be exercised alone
[48:52] right
[48:53] they're not for the edification of the
[48:55] body they're just for us
[48:57] I do most of my singing alone
[49:01] there are some gifts
[49:03] that need to be exercised alone right
[49:05] brother
[49:06] there's certain it's just that's just
[49:08] the way that it is and and there are
[49:10] some gifts there are long prayers that's
[49:13] a great thing if you if you have a gift
[49:16] to pray and pray a great length and and
[49:19] pray for hours and hours that's a
[49:20] wonderful thing but it's not to be done
[49:22] in the church
[49:23] right because it's something that that
[49:26] is a blessing to you and it's even a
[49:28] blessing to others but not for them to
[49:30] hear it it's more of a blessing to them
[49:32] if they don't hear it
[49:33] and God moves on their behalf because of
[49:35] your prayers
[49:37] so he said I'll just walk out in the
[49:39] apple orchard oh God and the power
[49:42] begins to fall on me and I start
[49:44] speaking in tongues he said I come in
[49:46] refreshed you see oh he said you see
[49:49] you're speaking to me Lord You're just
[49:52] keeping me lined up by speaking in
[49:55] tongues now church this is a real thing
[49:58] brother random believed in speaking in
[50:00] tongues
[50:01] right we believe in speaking in tongues
[50:03] we believe in that Supernatural element
[50:06] in our lives but there's a place and a
[50:10] proper way that he taught us to do that
[50:12] and so if there's no interpretation he
[50:16] said then this man could just by himself
[50:18] he could edify himself he said oh you
[50:20] see you're speaking to me Lord you're
[50:22] keeping me lined up he said and Lord
[50:24] today I ought to have spoke to that man
[50:26] now so he's going through the day and
[50:28] he's done something or neglected to do
[50:30] something that he should have done he
[50:32] said forgive me for it Lord I passed
[50:34] over something I ought into father
[50:35] please forgive me have you ever thought
[50:38] like that or I've gone through the day
[50:40] and I I've missed an opportunity to
[50:42] witness I I've missed an opportunity to
[50:44] talk to somebody he said you feel bad
[50:46] about that and directly he said away it
[50:48] goes speaking in tongues he said oh I
[50:51] feel better about it now
[50:53] why because to speak in those tongues
[50:57] like that you just you just got to get
[50:58] close to God
[51:00] right to get close to God where where
[51:02] the scripture Paul says that that the
[51:04] spirit prays for us with groanings that
[51:07] can't be uttered
[51:08] we just need to get so close to God I'm
[51:11] afraid that's missing from the church
[51:12] today we need to get so close to God in
[51:15] our own personal prayer life that we
[51:17] begin to talk to God and it don't even
[51:19] have to be word
[51:21] but he knows what we're saying
[51:25] and when you do that when you get in
[51:27] that Clear Channel with god well you
[51:29] should call it prayed through when you
[51:30] get and when you've gotten to a place
[51:32] where you've gotten past the elements
[51:35] and you've gotten past the brass ceiling
[51:37] it seems like that exists sometimes and
[51:39] you reach that place of freedom and and
[51:42] it's a blessing to you personally
[51:46] now
[51:47] he said oh he said I feel better about
[51:49] it now you see that's all right see your
[51:50] gift is not to be used in the church
[51:53] but it's to edify you
[51:55] it's okay
[51:57] to Shout by yourself
[52:00] it's okay to shout in church too but
[52:02] it's okay to Shout by yourself and you
[52:04] may actually get in a place where you
[52:06] shout and you scream and you speak in
[52:08] tongues by yourself and maybe in church
[52:11] it would be disruptive for you to do it
[52:13] in that manner
[52:14] right but but you do it by yourself and
[52:16] there's something about there's a
[52:18] freedom in that and I'll say this that
[52:20] if you don't do it by yourself if you
[52:23] never get close to God you don't have
[52:24] any prayer life yet you want to come to
[52:26] church and speak in tongues and you want
[52:28] to come to church and act and we're all
[52:30] spiritual if it's not going on at home
[52:32] it won't be going on to church
[52:36] it's not just for
[52:39] give me these gifts are not for a public
[52:41] show
[52:42] it's not to get up and into the front of
[52:44] the church and then and then and then go
[52:46] to pieces and then walk back to the back
[52:48] and chew on chewing gum and laugh and
[52:50] joke with somebody
[52:52] but it's a it's a reality of the
[52:54] presence of God and we need that in our
[52:57] lives
[53:00] Paul says I would that you all spoke
[53:02] with tongues
[53:03] First Corinthians 14 5.
[53:06] I would that you all spoke with tongues
[53:08] he said it's a good thing it'd be a good
[53:09] thing for all of you to do
[53:11] but rather that you prophesied
[53:14] for greater is he that prophesyth that
[53:16] he the speaker with tongues except he
[53:18] interpret that the church may receive
[53:21] edifying right so he's he's giving us a
[53:24] principle here that it's better to speak
[53:27] something in your original language
[53:30] than it is to speak in a tongue when
[53:33] there's a group of people present
[53:35] right we understand that
[53:37] and Pentecostals they had that turned
[53:39] around they still do think oh if
[53:41] everybody's speaking in tongues what a
[53:43] glorious service no preaching no no and
[53:45] no altar call no music just just
[53:47] everybody speaking in tongues exercising
[53:49] their gifts how many of you have ever
[53:51] been to a charismatic church
[53:54] boy most of you have
[53:56] if you've ever been to a charismatic
[53:58] church then you know what and maybe I
[54:01] don't know exactly how they are today I
[54:03] know when I was a kid we went to several
[54:04] and Gifts were unrestrained
[54:07] we went to one that was a house church
[54:09] and and each person just said that was
[54:11] the whole service you just said in your
[54:13] chair in the living room and you
[54:15] operated in a gift and it was a woman
[54:17] here speaking with tongues here was
[54:19] somebody prophesying it was another
[54:20] walking around and giving people
[54:22] Revelations and and that's what Paul
[54:25] said the church in Corinth was like
[54:27] it was a charismatic church that's where
[54:29] that name comes from Charisma is gifts
[54:31] that's the word Paul uses for gifts
[54:34] Charisma so but the charismatics they
[54:37] they put it all on the gift and and that
[54:40] they're all supposed to be going around
[54:41] like that but Paul says that's not the
[54:43] way it's supposed to be he said you'd be
[54:45] having a more do you get more done in
[54:47] your services if you spoke five words of
[54:50] understanding then thousands of words in
[54:53] tongues
[54:54] right we undervalue the power of the
[54:57] spoken word we undervalue what we have
[55:00] what we have is so beneficial to us what
[55:03] we have is so important to us
[55:07] right so we get the they got the cart
[55:09] before the horse
[55:11] and and we'll get more on that as we go
[55:13] along now
[55:15] the Pentecost was taught
[55:18] that the evidence
[55:20] of the Holy Ghost was speaking in
[55:22] unknown tongues now your modern
[55:24] charismatic church have backed up a
[55:26] little bit on that but the old line
[55:27] Pentecostals that was what made them
[55:30] Pentecostal
[55:31] is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[55:34] was speaking in unknown tongues
[55:37] and and they took that from Acts 2 and 4
[55:39] where it says they were all filled with
[55:41] the Holy Ghost who began to speak with
[55:43] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[55:45] utterance
[55:47] brother random taught that this was not
[55:49] the case
[55:50] that these were not unknown tongues
[55:53] right that that never happened on the
[55:55] day of Pentecost
[55:57] right because in in verse 5 it says they
[55:59] were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout
[56:01] men out of every nation under heaven now
[56:03] when this was noised abroad the
[56:05] multitude came together and were
[56:07] confounded because that every man heard
[56:09] them speak in his own language
[56:12] right so it was it was 120 coming out of
[56:16] the upper room and brother Brown said
[56:17] they they didn't they didn't even speak
[56:19] in tongues when they received the Holy
[56:20] Ghost they spoke in tongues when they
[56:22] met somebody
[56:23] right so they come out of the upper room
[56:25] and they come out and they met somebody
[56:26] and they said hey I something just
[56:29] happened to me I I just received the
[56:31] gift of the Holy Ghost I the promise of
[56:33] the father has come and when I spoke
[56:35] when he spoke he was he was Galilean but
[56:37] the one he's speaking to is is from
[56:39] another country
[56:41] and if you've ever been to a country you
[56:43] know we're blessed in this country we're
[56:45] right in the middle of an
[56:46] English-speaking country everybody for
[56:48] thousands of miles speaks either English
[56:50] or Spanish
[56:52] right I mean we're we're sitting right
[56:53] in the middle of a country where there's
[56:54] not very many foreign languages
[56:57] I didn't hear anybody speaking speaking
[56:58] Spanish till I was old
[57:01] until I was grown
[57:03] and now you hear that a lot but but you
[57:06] didn't you didn't hear that everybody
[57:07] spoke English but if you went to Togo
[57:09] with me every service you have to have
[57:11] at least two interpreters usually three
[57:14] because not everybody even speaks the
[57:16] official language of the country
[57:17] which is French so I'm speaking in
[57:20] English through a French interpreter and
[57:21] a interpreter in the language of eway
[57:24] and another in another local dialect
[57:25] sometimes three or four interpreters
[57:27] just to get you know 500 people to
[57:29] understand what you're saying
[57:31] and even there will always be somebody
[57:33] that still doesn't understand it well
[57:34] because and many people speak several
[57:36] different languages so that's what it
[57:38] was like that weekend which it was the
[57:40] Pentecost weekend there and all the
[57:43] people were there from all over the
[57:44] world and so that each one began to hear
[57:46] as the as they come out of the upper
[57:49] room and they were they were staggering
[57:50] like drunk men right we're taught that
[57:53] they they were so under the influence of
[57:54] the Holy Spirit and they began to tell
[57:55] their testimony what had happened and
[57:58] every man heard them speak
[58:00] in his own language it was not an
[58:02] unknown tongue
[58:05] now
[58:06] and they were all amazed and marveled
[58:08] saying one to another Beholder not all
[58:10] these which speak galileans
[58:12] how here we every man in our own tongue
[58:14] wherein we were born
[58:17] it's not one word missed but the brand
[58:19] of sin
[58:20] but the brain is really really harsh on
[58:22] this because now but what's he hitting
[58:25] that they were saying it's the evidence
[58:27] of the Holy Ghost like what happened in
[58:29] Acts 2. but the brown said if you've got
[58:31] the Holy Ghost and you spoke in unknown
[58:32] tongues and that's your evidence he said
[58:34] you don't even have it
[58:37] right because that's not that what
[58:39] happened in the Bible
[58:41] right that's not the evidence of it and
[58:44] he explained it like this he taught us
[58:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was like a
[58:47] room
[58:47] and when you uh when when you go in the
[58:50] door he said you're in the Holy Ghost he
[58:53] said you'll see people
[58:54] right just like I go in this room and I
[58:56] see people so here's Jason sitting here
[58:58] on the front on the front row trying to
[59:00] pretend to be interested right and and
[59:03] so you're sitting on the front row and I
[59:05] come in the first thing I see is Jason
[59:06] well Jason is the evidence
[59:09] all right it's the first thing I saw
[59:10] well that's no he's just he's just part
[59:13] of what's in the room
[59:15] right there's other things in the room
[59:16] so brother Brown said tongues and
[59:18] prophecies and all those things are in
[59:20] the room the gifts are in the room
[59:23] are you with me so far the gifts are in
[59:25] the room but they're not the Holy Ghost
[59:28] in fact the gifts could operate and a
[59:30] person wasn't even saved
[59:32] but the thing is to be in the room
[59:33] that's where the gifts are
[59:36] so the Holy Ghost itself is to come into
[59:38] the room
[59:39] so brother random he gets pretty hard on
[59:41] that and and the debate on tongues he
[59:43] says you'll have to he said you'll have
[59:45] to put your version of Pentecost already
[59:47] been condemned you have to put your
[59:48] version of Pentecost in Babel because
[59:50] you can't put it in Acts 2 4.
[59:53] so there's because that's when they
[59:55] didn't understand
[59:57] right the Tower of Babel they all spoke
[59:59] different languages it was confusion
[1:00:01] but here they understood
[1:00:04] and so
[1:00:06] now there's again two types of tongues
[1:00:09] one is for personal edification only the
[1:00:12] other is a gift to edify the body
[1:00:14] First Corinthians 14 6. he said now
[1:00:17] brother if I come into you speaking with
[1:00:19] tongues what shall I profit you except I
[1:00:21] shall speak to you either by Revelation
[1:00:23] or by knowledge or by prophesying or by
[1:00:27] Doctrine
[1:00:28] verse seven and even things without
[1:00:30] life-giving sound whether pipe or harp
[1:00:33] except they give a distinction in the
[1:00:36] sounds how shall it be known what is
[1:00:38] piped or harped so and there's a great
[1:00:41] sermon there if anybody ever wanted to
[1:00:43] get it together but the distinction is
[1:00:46] what makes the melody of the music
[1:00:50] it's the distinction of sounds
[1:00:53] that makes it music
[1:00:55] right if it was all the same
[1:00:58] if all these musicians got up here and
[1:01:00] all just hit their instruments and it
[1:01:03] was all the same
[1:01:04] all the time we there's no knowing when
[1:01:08] the chorus ends when the when you go to
[1:01:10] the verse the the it doesn't move you at
[1:01:13] all because it's not music because you
[1:01:15] can't understand it
[1:01:17] The Reason Music is understandable is
[1:01:20] because there's a distinction in the
[1:01:22] sounds
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:24] now and so and it is really hard trust
[1:01:28] me on this but Joel can back me up on
[1:01:30] this it's really hard to worship when
[1:01:32] everybody else is singing in another
[1:01:34] language
[1:01:36] very difficult
[1:01:38] and because it just it you appreciate it
[1:01:41] if you know the tune but then if they're
[1:01:43] singing in another language it's
[1:01:44] language and singing songs you don't
[1:01:46] know well there's there's nothing you
[1:01:48] can do it's very difficult so unless
[1:01:51] there's a distinction in the sounds how
[1:01:53] shall it be known what has typed or
[1:01:55] harmed
[1:01:56] so there's got to be a distinction it's
[1:01:57] got to be a certain sound
[1:02:00] right if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:02:01] sound who should prepare himself to the
[1:02:03] battle
[1:02:04] so likewise she accepts you utter by the
[1:02:06] Tongue words easy to be understood
[1:02:09] easy to be understood
[1:02:12] right so you preach to the audience
[1:02:14] level that you're speaking to
[1:02:18] you they got to be able to understand it
[1:02:20] and that'd be a good thing for us
[1:02:21] preachers to remember sometimes we just
[1:02:24] need to slow down till people understand
[1:02:25] it
[1:02:26] because if people don't understand it it
[1:02:28] don't matter how anointed the service
[1:02:29] was
[1:02:31] right they need to understand even if
[1:02:34] all they understand is you must be born
[1:02:36] again that's that's enough for them to
[1:02:38] be saved
[1:02:40] right so they have to understand it so
[1:02:42] now he said how should you know you
[1:02:45] don't want to spoke to you speak in the
[1:02:46] air it just evaporates
[1:02:48] you're speaking but there's no no
[1:02:49] purpose to it verse 10 there are it may
[1:02:52] be so many kinds of voices in the world
[1:02:54] none of them is without signification
[1:02:57] so in other words
[1:02:59] everything every sound they found that
[1:03:01] by the way all the sounds the birds
[1:03:03] there's a reason there's there's
[1:03:05] something behind the sound it's not just
[1:03:07] babble
[1:03:09] there's a reason for it
[1:03:11] and but it's to an audience right the
[1:03:13] bird's not really singing to you
[1:03:16] singing for somebody
[1:03:18] right and so there's an audience to it
[1:03:21] somebody understands what he's saying
[1:03:24] therefore if I know not the meaning of a
[1:03:26] voice I shall be unto him that speaketh
[1:03:28] the Barbarian
[1:03:30] and he the speaker should be a barbarian
[1:03:32] unto me just a foreigner a stranger
[1:03:35] verse 12 even so ye for as much as
[1:03:37] you're zealous of spiritual gifts seek
[1:03:39] that you may excel to the edifying of
[1:03:42] the church isn't that what you want to
[1:03:43] do whatever my gift is let it be for the
[1:03:45] edification of the church
[1:03:48] not just myself
[1:03:50] he said wherefore let him to speaketh in
[1:03:53] an unknown tongue pray that he may
[1:03:54] interpret now brother Branham as I've
[1:03:56] read thousands hundreds maybe thousands
[1:03:59] of quotes on tongues and interpretation
[1:04:02] and as I was reading through these and
[1:04:04] I'm and I'm reading the scriptures and
[1:04:06] studying and praying about it I begin to
[1:04:08] recognize a pattern brother Branham
[1:04:11] liked for someone if they were going to
[1:04:13] speak in tongues for that same person to
[1:04:16] interpret
[1:04:18] it may sound strange but that's what the
[1:04:20] Bible says if he's speaking in an
[1:04:22] unknown tongue pray that he may
[1:04:23] interpret that's not the only way God
[1:04:24] moves but that can be done now
[1:04:27] interpretation what is interpretation
[1:04:30] what is that the gift of interpretation
[1:04:32] interpretation is exactly what it sounds
[1:04:34] like
[1:04:37] right it's the same as if I was standing
[1:04:40] here and brother baduca and some of you
[1:04:42] watch the services overseas is
[1:04:43] interpreting for me
[1:04:45] he understands what I'm saying
[1:04:48] and he when he takes what I'm saying and
[1:04:51] translates it into their language where
[1:04:53] they can understand
[1:04:55] right that's interpretation yeah yeah
[1:04:57] it's the same thing with the gift of
[1:04:59] interpretation
[1:05:00] the gift of interpretation is
[1:05:02] understanding what someone is saying and
[1:05:05] interpreting it
[1:05:07] now brother Branham says that he says in
[1:05:10] the interpretation of tongues many
[1:05:11] people interpret tongues by an
[1:05:12] extraordinary expression of them feeling
[1:05:14] to say such a thing that is not
[1:05:17] interpretation
[1:05:18] interpretation is when they are speaking
[1:05:20] in an unknown tongue you're hearing them
[1:05:22] in English
[1:05:23] and just repeating over what they're
[1:05:25] saying
[1:05:27] so if you have the gift of
[1:05:28] interpretation of someone speaking in
[1:05:30] tongues you hear them and you understand
[1:05:33] the language
[1:05:35] right it's not just that you're suddenly
[1:05:37] inspired to say something
[1:05:40] but you hear the interpretation you hear
[1:05:42] them speak in the language you were born
[1:05:45] in
[1:05:45] and so he said many people interpret
[1:05:48] tongues by an extraordinary expression
[1:05:49] that's not interpretation interpretation
[1:05:51] is when they're speaking in an unknown
[1:05:53] tongue you're hearing them in English
[1:05:54] and just repeating over what they're
[1:05:56] saying
[1:05:57] again he said if you're speaking in an
[1:05:59] unknown tongue and interpreting you're
[1:06:01] hearing in the language that you were
[1:06:02] born in because that's the only way you
[1:06:04] can interpret what they're saying
[1:06:06] because the Holy Spirit has interpreted
[1:06:07] it to you and you're just speaking for
[1:06:10] the Holy Spirit I love that
[1:06:12] you're just speaking for the holy spirit
[1:06:14] so you're not you're not it's not just
[1:06:16] an inspiration like a prophecy
[1:06:18] but it's actually you hearing what's
[1:06:21] been said now
[1:06:22] again we need to be careful because we
[1:06:24] don't need to despise gifts
[1:06:27] so when we're talking about these things
[1:06:28] you say well that person didn't do it
[1:06:29] exactly right well we need to be careful
[1:06:32] with that we don't want to blaspheme the
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost
[1:06:35] right you don't want to blaspheme the
[1:06:37] Holy Ghost and sometimes the Holy Ghost
[1:06:38] Works in ways that we don't understand
[1:06:42] but again we want to stay with the word
[1:06:44] now brother Branham and God being
[1:06:46] misunderstood which is a great tape to
[1:06:48] go back and listen to if you want to
[1:06:49] understand this better than what I can
[1:06:51] say it but in that tape brother random
[1:06:54] talks about brother Ryan and he said
[1:06:57] brother Ryan was an old Pentecostal
[1:06:59] preacher and he said he would stand on
[1:07:00] the on the street corner speaking in
[1:07:03] tongues
[1:07:04] and that's a very Pentecostal thing to
[1:07:06] do some of you Old-Timers know you know
[1:07:08] he's standing on the street corner
[1:07:09] speaking tongues he said he said the
[1:07:11] same word over and over again
[1:07:14] like that
[1:07:16] and and brother Brian was illustrating
[1:07:18] that and and he was just standing there
[1:07:21] saying the same word and and somebody
[1:07:22] asked for the random said is that of God
[1:07:25] and brother Brown said certainly I
[1:07:27] believe it's of God
[1:07:29] he said but he was speaking in tongues
[1:07:32] but I couldn't say what he was saying
[1:07:34] because I don't know
[1:07:35] and brother Brandon By the way several
[1:07:36] times says he he does not have he did
[1:07:38] not have the gift of interpretation of
[1:07:40] tongues he spoke in tongues but he did
[1:07:43] not have the gift of interpretation
[1:07:45] and so he said certainly I believe it's
[1:07:48] of God he said but he was speaking in
[1:07:49] tongues he said but I couldn't say what
[1:07:51] he was saying because I don't know he
[1:07:53] said but the presence of the spirit was
[1:07:55] there now this is important
[1:07:58] he said so if the presence of the spirit
[1:08:00] is there and this person is just saying
[1:08:03] one word over and over and over and this
[1:08:04] other one jumps up and tries to give an
[1:08:06] interpretation yet he don't know what
[1:08:08] he's saying
[1:08:09] right he said if this man is not giving
[1:08:11] the interpretation he's prophesying
[1:08:14] the spirit of Prophecy is upon him he's
[1:08:16] prophesying not giving an interpretation
[1:08:18] he said so therefore dear Christian to
[1:08:20] you who said that could that be the Holy
[1:08:22] Spirit it could be the Holy Spirit using
[1:08:24] two offices
[1:08:26] one blessing of soul in speaking in
[1:08:28] tongues and another one prophesying not
[1:08:31] have to be interpreting what he's saying
[1:08:33] but yet he said it
[1:08:35] I would say most of the tongues
[1:08:37] interpretation that I've heard in my
[1:08:38] life have been this
[1:08:40] someone get up and speak in tongues Be
[1:08:42] Inspired in the presence of God was
[1:08:44] there yes
[1:08:45] and be inspired to do that and then
[1:08:47] someone else get up and prophesy
[1:08:50] but that's not necessarily an
[1:08:51] interpretation of the tongue and we'll
[1:08:53] get to that in just a little bit because
[1:08:54] interpretation has to be something
[1:08:55] Direct
[1:08:57] right it's direct to the body and we'll
[1:08:59] get into the order of that in just a
[1:09:00] moment but but now and there's so much
[1:09:03] more we could say but we'll we'll get
[1:09:05] you out of here tonight I promise
[1:09:07] and we get out before but Allen falls
[1:09:09] asleep
[1:09:12] so
[1:09:13] he said could that be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:15] he said it could be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:17] using two offices
[1:09:19] that one speaking in tongues another one
[1:09:21] prophesying he said not not have to be
[1:09:23] interpreting what he's saying but yet he
[1:09:25] said it he said the Holy Spirit came
[1:09:27] upon him in Prophecy just the same time
[1:09:29] that this one was speaking in tongues
[1:09:30] and he thought it was an interpretation
[1:09:32] what difference does it make he said
[1:09:34] it's the spirit of God giving a message
[1:09:36] to the church
[1:09:37] but the interpretation has got to
[1:09:39] understand in English
[1:09:41] and repeat back exactly what the person
[1:09:43] said that's the gift of interpretation
[1:09:46] right now
[1:09:48] you say well why don't we see very much
[1:09:50] of that well I I didn't know you spoke
[1:09:52] another language
[1:09:55] now but that's the gift of
[1:09:57] interpretation like it was on the day of
[1:09:58] Pentecost it was they heard them
[1:10:00] speaking their own language now there's
[1:10:01] times I could have used that gift
[1:10:03] overseas
[1:10:06] and many brothers will tell you that
[1:10:08] have worked overseas will tell you that
[1:10:09] that's happened at some point in their
[1:10:11] Ministry but the Branham said it
[1:10:12] happened in his ministry where a Spanish
[1:10:14] girl he began to speak and she
[1:10:15] understood
[1:10:17] right and that was needed and yet again
[1:10:20] I don't think God couldn't speak to the
[1:10:21] church and say something in that manner
[1:10:23] as well with interpretation but maybe
[1:10:25] maybe we're not as Multicultural as that
[1:10:28] and so we just get the word you say well
[1:10:30] no one's tongues tonight we
[1:10:32] didn't have very good service that's not
[1:10:34] true
[1:10:35] that's not true we're still under the
[1:10:37] anointing of the mighty angel we're
[1:10:39] still under the presence of the Holy
[1:10:41] Spirit
[1:10:43] you don't realize what hour you live in
[1:10:44] the bride Revival is not subject to
[1:10:47] somebody standing up and speaking in
[1:10:48] tongues
[1:10:50] that might happen but the bride Revival
[1:10:52] is not subject to that that's not what
[1:10:54] brings the bride Revival the bride
[1:10:55] Revival is the word of the hour the
[1:10:57] revelation of the son of man in our day
[1:11:01] and it's here
[1:11:02] and we can have it just the same as
[1:11:04] anybody else can
[1:11:06] right and again I I'd love to see I I
[1:11:10] I'd love to see the church so on fire
[1:11:12] for God I had to come up here and
[1:11:14] distribute some people and set it in
[1:11:15] order
[1:11:18] right wouldn't that be wonderful but but
[1:11:21] you know we live in an age where
[1:11:23] sometimes you struggle to get people to
[1:11:25] just come to the house of God
[1:11:27] but I'll say this we need to be on fire
[1:11:29] for God we need the presence of God to
[1:11:31] be in our midst we need that I don't
[1:11:34] want to discourage that but we also need
[1:11:36] to understand what's going on
[1:11:39] you don't judge the spirituality of a
[1:11:42] group of people by whether or not they
[1:11:44] have gifts
[1:11:49] when one is speaking
[1:11:51] he said the other is interpreting right
[1:11:53] there now watch he said interpretation
[1:11:56] is not somebody standing speaking
[1:11:57] tongues another one get up in a few
[1:11:58] minutes and interpret what he said
[1:12:00] let me repeat that
[1:12:02] interpretation is not somebody standing
[1:12:04] speaking tongues another one get up in a
[1:12:06] few minutes and interpret what he said
[1:12:08] he said when one is speaking the other
[1:12:10] is interpreting right there saying word
[1:12:12] by word
[1:12:13] same expression everything the same
[1:12:17] so you're not going to have a tons of
[1:12:19] five minutes in interpretation of 10
[1:12:20] minutes
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:23] it's not interpretation
[1:12:25] he said this man might be prophesying
[1:12:27] but it is an interpretation some of them
[1:12:29] this kind of a voice giving something
[1:12:30] just back here giving something else
[1:12:32] some say 10 words and others say 50
[1:12:34] words behind it for an interpretation he
[1:12:36] said interpret means to say word by word
[1:12:39] if it's a word of God it's got to come
[1:12:41] word by word I always get nervous
[1:12:42] overseas when they when I say a whole
[1:12:44] sentence and they say Just Two Words
[1:12:49] is you know they didn't tell all of it
[1:12:53] so when you have a different length
[1:12:55] of tongues and interpretation you
[1:12:58] probably have tongues and prophecy
[1:13:02] right and then there's there's a
[1:13:04] governing to that there's an order for
[1:13:06] that but but that's it's probably not
[1:13:08] just tongues of interpretation he said
[1:13:10] interpretation means to say word by word
[1:13:12] if it's the word of God it's got to come
[1:13:13] word by word we'll end upon line up
[1:13:15] online he said that's the way the word
[1:13:16] has got to come
[1:13:18] now
[1:13:20] he said but you see many times in our
[1:13:21] churches we permit people just to raise
[1:13:23] up even when you're preaching speak in
[1:13:25] tongues making an altar call somebody
[1:13:27] speaking tongues and somebody and give
[1:13:28] interpretations merely one of them he
[1:13:31] said I believe I believe the person is
[1:13:32] genuinely speaking in tongues he said
[1:13:35] but I believe the other is more or less
[1:13:36] prophesying because some will speak in
[1:13:38] tongues maybe for five minutes and the
[1:13:40] other one give four words of
[1:13:41] interpretation see it has to be at the
[1:13:43] same sound the same raise and fall of
[1:13:47] voice
[1:13:48] so that's what interpretation is now I
[1:13:50] want I wanted us to look and see what
[1:13:52] order that Paul put in the church
[1:13:54] because we are bound to that in the
[1:13:56] sense that this is the word of God this
[1:13:59] is the scripture
[1:14:00] so First Corinthians 14 14 says for if I
[1:14:03] pray in an unknown tongue my spirit
[1:14:06] prayeth but my understanding is
[1:14:08] unfruitful in other words I don't even
[1:14:10] know what I'm saying
[1:14:12] right he said what is it then I will
[1:14:15] pray with the spirit but I will pray
[1:14:17] with the understanding also
[1:14:19] I will sing with the spirit
[1:14:21] and I will sing with the understanding
[1:14:23] also
[1:14:24] said else when thou shalt blessed with
[1:14:26] the spirit how shall he that occupyeth
[1:14:28] the room of the unlearned say Amen if I
[1:14:30] giving a thanks see understandeth not
[1:14:32] without says and this may sound almost
[1:14:33] comical to us but evidently in Corinth
[1:14:36] they were praying over the food in
[1:14:37] tongues
[1:14:39] right but that's not far from where
[1:14:42] Pentecost has got it today
[1:14:45] now but that's thank God for a message
[1:14:47] that come in our day and set those
[1:14:49] things right now
[1:14:50] he says
[1:14:52] uh for thou verbally give us thanks well
[1:14:54] but the other is not edified he said I
[1:14:56] think my God I speak with tongues more
[1:14:58] than you all
[1:14:59] yeah and brother Branham says he's kind
[1:15:02] of a play on words there because Paul
[1:15:03] spoke in a lot of different languages
[1:15:05] but he said yet in the church he said
[1:15:07] I'd rather speak five words with my
[1:15:09] understanding that by my voice I might
[1:15:12] teach others also then ten thousand
[1:15:15] words in an unknown tongue
[1:15:17] and he said Brethren be not children and
[1:15:19] understanding how be in Malice be
[1:15:22] children
[1:15:23] but in understanding be men it's one of
[1:15:25] my favorite verses in the Bible
[1:15:27] be malice to be children but an
[1:15:29] understanding be men
[1:15:31] now what are tongues a sign of
[1:15:35] because you have people tell you well
[1:15:36] tongues in the church are assigned to
[1:15:38] the to the believer assigned to the
[1:15:40] elect that the church is in the right
[1:15:42] place or tongues are a a sign of the
[1:15:47] bride's Revival or tongues are a sign of
[1:15:49] of spirituality but tongues are actually
[1:15:53] assigned to the unbeliever
[1:15:55] and that's what Paul writes here he said
[1:15:57] in the law it is written with men of
[1:15:59] other tongues and other lips while
[1:16:00] speaking of his people and yet for all
[1:16:02] that will they not hear me saith the
[1:16:04] Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign
[1:16:07] not to them that believe but to them
[1:16:09] that believe not
[1:16:11] but prophesying servth not for them that
[1:16:14] believe not but for them which believe
[1:16:18] amen now watch
[1:16:20] brother Brown says there is all this
[1:16:21] talk about glossolalia which is what
[1:16:23] they took the word glossa which is a
[1:16:26] tongue and uh and to speak alelia is to
[1:16:29] speak it's a Greek word they put those
[1:16:31] two words together called glossolalia
[1:16:32] which is what you hear about when they
[1:16:34] speak in tongues in the Pentecostal
[1:16:35] church he said there's all this talk
[1:16:37] about glossolalia it is supposed to be
[1:16:39] the evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:41] Ghost and people are thinking we're in
[1:16:42] the midst of a great Revival
[1:16:44] he said the Revival is over
[1:16:46] America had her last chance in 57.
[1:16:49] right you balance that with the word
[1:16:52] we're in the bride Revival
[1:16:54] but the American Revival is over
[1:16:57] that Revival they don't have a chance
[1:17:01] well I wish that they did but they
[1:17:03] turned it down
[1:17:04] right but we we have a chance we're
[1:17:06] going up not going down so we don't need
[1:17:09] to get those two things mixed up
[1:17:11] but the Revival of the sweeping
[1:17:12] worldwide Revival is over we we preached
[1:17:15] about that before he said now the
[1:17:16] tongues are God's sign of impending
[1:17:19] disaster even as they were when they
[1:17:21] appeared upon the wall at belshin's Arts
[1:17:24] feast
[1:17:24] a sign of impending disaster you realize
[1:17:29] what it is in the hour when everybody's
[1:17:31] speaking in tongues even the Archbishop
[1:17:33] of Canterbury speaks in tongues
[1:17:36] right all these people are speaking to
[1:17:38] us why are they doing that it's a sign
[1:17:40] to the unbeliever
[1:17:43] it's a sign that there's disaster coming
[1:17:46] but oh my we saw a different sign the
[1:17:49] sign of the son of man
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:53] and again they don't put tongues out of
[1:17:54] the church because tongues there is a
[1:17:56] real tongues but tongues brother Branham
[1:18:00] said that the uh the foolish virgin was
[1:18:02] seeking the Holy Ghost but he said they
[1:18:03] come and they got tongues they didn't
[1:18:05] get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:08] he said they didn't get any oil
[1:18:10] the bride already went in
[1:18:12] oh God help us to realize where we're at
[1:18:16] First Corinthians 14 23 if therefore the
[1:18:19] whole church become together in one
[1:18:20] place
[1:18:22] and all speak with tongues and there
[1:18:24] come in those that are unlearned or
[1:18:25] unbelievers will they not say that
[1:18:26] you're mad
[1:18:27] or you're insane
[1:18:30] but if all you're crazy if all prophesy
[1:18:33] and they're coming one that believeth
[1:18:34] not or one unlearned he is convinced of
[1:18:35] all he's judged of all and thus are the
[1:18:38] secrets of his heart made manifest and
[1:18:40] so falling down on his face he will
[1:18:42] worship God and report that God is in
[1:18:44] you of the truth
[1:18:46] verse 26 how is it then Brethren when
[1:18:48] you come together every one of you have
[1:18:49] to Psalm at the doctrine at the tongue
[1:18:51] have a revelation hath an interpretation
[1:18:53] let all things be done unto edifying If
[1:18:57] any man speak in an unknown tongue Let
[1:18:59] It Be by two he said or at the most by
[1:19:01] three and that by course in other words
[1:19:03] not at the same time and let one
[1:19:05] interpret but if there be no interpreter
[1:19:08] let him keep silence in the church and
[1:19:10] let him speak to himself and to God
[1:19:13] verse 29 let the prophet speak two or
[1:19:15] three let the other judge if anything be
[1:19:18] revealed to another the Sabbath Violet
[1:19:20] the first hold his peace for you may all
[1:19:22] prophesy one by one that all may learn
[1:19:24] and all may be comforted and the spirits
[1:19:27] of the prophets are subject to the
[1:19:29] prophets for God is not the author of
[1:19:31] confusion but a peace let me believe
[1:19:33] that tonight as in all churches of the
[1:19:36] Saints
[1:19:37] now this is the order then this is where
[1:19:38] brother Branham takes Church order from
[1:19:40] it's it's from a Biblical principle
[1:19:42] brother Brandon set in his own
[1:19:44] Tabernacle that those with gifts were to
[1:19:46] meet in a separate service prior to the
[1:19:49] regular service in their own room
[1:19:52] because brother Brown said this that
[1:19:53] Paul's talking about where they spoke to
[1:19:55] two or three and let the other judge he
[1:19:57] said it couldn't be judged if the whole
[1:19:59] congregation heard it
[1:20:01] so it would have to be before the
[1:20:03] service is what he said now it says then
[1:20:06] he said now come together in the church
[1:20:08] often a room to yourself
[1:20:11] again if you have a gift like that and
[1:20:15] we'd be happy to start up a separate
[1:20:18] room and a separate service and see the
[1:20:20] gifts operating it'd be wonderful I'd
[1:20:22] love to see that but so much of what was
[1:20:25] going on in the hour that brother
[1:20:26] Branham lived in was fake
[1:20:29] so much of it was fake
[1:20:32] that they couldn't operate under this
[1:20:35] at all
[1:20:36] now he says now come together in the in
[1:20:40] the church in a room to yourself you
[1:20:42] have a private Ministry it's not an open
[1:20:43] Ministry it's one that's to help the
[1:20:45] church he said it's something to help
[1:20:46] the church but it isn't to be done in
[1:20:48] the main congregation only the way I'm
[1:20:50] going to tell you it's to be done
[1:20:52] so again and you can go find this all
[1:20:54] for yourself the interpretation had to
[1:20:56] be something specific just like a
[1:20:58] prophecy that we talked about not
[1:21:00] written not something written in the
[1:21:01] scripture
[1:21:02] right so I could pull out any Scripture
[1:21:05] uh at Solomon began to build the house
[1:21:07] of the Lord
[1:21:08] now I can say that I can read that and
[1:21:10] tell you that
[1:21:12] right but if you got up to speak in
[1:21:15] tongues or interpret tongues or to
[1:21:17] prophesy and and said that then it
[1:21:21] wouldn't it wouldn't do any good it
[1:21:22] would have no purpose
[1:21:24] right because God already has a gift to
[1:21:27] ever standing in the Pulpit to reveal
[1:21:29] the word of God
[1:21:30] right so it wouldn't be anything in the
[1:21:33] scripture
[1:21:34] not written in the scripture and and
[1:21:36] that wouldn't be against the scripture
[1:21:38] but it'll be something specific are
[1:21:40] y'all still with me tonight
[1:21:43] so and it had to be witnessed by two or
[1:21:46] three judges
[1:21:47] so he said when these people meet
[1:21:48] together let them let them who have
[1:21:50] wisdom first come
[1:21:52] because you see if one speaks in tongues
[1:21:54] and gives an interpretation according to
[1:21:56] scripture that cannot be received unless
[1:21:58] it be witnessed by two or three people
[1:22:00] two or three more witnesses he has to
[1:22:02] witness to that that they believe it to
[1:22:04] be the word of the Lord
[1:22:06] right so that's very important for us I
[1:22:09] think to follow now
[1:22:11] it was then to be laid on the platform
[1:22:13] so they take the prophecy lay it on the
[1:22:15] platform and re and was read by the
[1:22:17] pastor to the congregation before the
[1:22:19] service starts
[1:22:21] he said now then if someone writes a
[1:22:23] message that's been given in tongues or
[1:22:24] given in Prophecy it upon the platform
[1:22:26] must be read by the pastor before the
[1:22:28] service starts so thus saith the Lord
[1:22:30] from these people who spoke and
[1:22:31] interpret it and if that comes to pass
[1:22:33] exactly the way the interpretation said
[1:22:36] we raise our hands and give thanks to
[1:22:38] God for his Spirit Among Us if it
[1:22:41] doesn't come to pass then don't do it
[1:22:43] anymore until that evil spirit's out of
[1:22:45] you
[1:22:46] God don't lie he's always truth
[1:22:52] we shouldn't be afraid
[1:22:54] to judge what we have and what we are
[1:22:57] we shouldn't be afraid to live in the
[1:22:58] open
[1:23:00] whatever our gifts are whatever whatever
[1:23:02] our testimony of being a Christian is
[1:23:03] that whatever we do at home ought
[1:23:06] to be able to be put on display
[1:23:09] when it comes to the way we live our
[1:23:10] life
[1:23:11] there shouldn't be any business deal
[1:23:13] that we'd be afraid of the church
[1:23:14] knowing about
[1:23:16] shouldn't be any shouldn't be any kind
[1:23:18] of life that we live that we'd be afraid
[1:23:20] for somebody to find out about I hope
[1:23:22] you hear me Church shouldn't be anything
[1:23:24] that we do that we that we're afraid to
[1:23:26] examine by the word
[1:23:28] because that's our standard and so
[1:23:31] brother Branham brings us into the light
[1:23:33] and he says I want you to do this I want
[1:23:35] you to be spiritual I want you to have
[1:23:37] tongues and interpretation all of these
[1:23:39] things but do it the right way
[1:23:42] and that's what people had a problem
[1:23:43] with
[1:23:45] now
[1:23:47] he said God don't lie he's always truth
[1:23:50] Paul finishes this up in First
[1:23:52] Corinthians 14 he talks about women
[1:23:54] keeping silence in the churches and
[1:23:56] where we take a part of where we take or
[1:23:58] a woman should not preach
[1:24:01] but then he says what came the word of
[1:24:03] God out from you
[1:24:05] so in other words he said were you the
[1:24:07] origin of the message
[1:24:12] or came it unto you only are you the
[1:24:14] only church that's right
[1:24:17] we have to think about that
[1:24:20] do you get to set your own standard
[1:24:23] no we have to stay under the standard of
[1:24:24] the message of the hour
[1:24:26] no matter what we think or how we think
[1:24:29] it might be better we got to stay with
[1:24:31] the word
[1:24:33] verse 37 If any man think himself to be
[1:24:35] a prophet or spiritual let him
[1:24:38] acknowledge that the things that I write
[1:24:40] unto you are the Commandments of the
[1:24:42] Lord
[1:24:43] but if any man be ignorant let him be
[1:24:45] ignorant
[1:24:46] wherefore brother and he said covet to
[1:24:48] prophesy forbid not to speak with
[1:24:51] tongues
[1:24:52] don't forbid to do it we said let all
[1:24:55] things be done decently
[1:24:56] and in order now I want you to notice as
[1:24:59] we're closing tonight
[1:25:01] that in in chapter 15 of First
[1:25:02] Corinthians Paul goes into the mystery
[1:25:05] of the Resurrection
[1:25:07] he sets the gifts in order and
[1:25:09] immediately goes into the mystery of the
[1:25:10] resurrection and if you remember when
[1:25:12] Paul speaks to the Ephesians because we
[1:25:14] just got through with the Ephesian
[1:25:15] church when Paul speaks to the Ephesians
[1:25:18] he does not have to set gifts in order
[1:25:21] evidently whatever gifts that they had
[1:25:23] brother Brown said they had the gifts
[1:25:24] but they were in order
[1:25:25] so that was not the question when he
[1:25:27] speaks to the Ephesians he's able to
[1:25:29] deal with them as the elect children of
[1:25:31] God
[1:25:32] when he speaks to the Corinthians he has
[1:25:34] to set the gifts in order
[1:25:36] and then he goes into those Mysteries he
[1:25:39] goes into the mystery of the body change
[1:25:41] and the resurrection oh I'm so grateful
[1:25:44] for that he goes into work this is where
[1:25:47] you should be even he tells the Hebrews
[1:25:49] he said you yeah you're drinking milk
[1:25:51] you should you happen to be taught you
[1:25:53] should be teaching others
[1:25:55] right there's things Beyond this and
[1:25:57] he's letting them know and I found that
[1:25:59] the most controversial thing that you
[1:26:02] can talk about is tongues
[1:26:04] and it's the least of the gifts
[1:26:07] now why is that because people don't
[1:26:10] understand the importance of the word
[1:26:12] itself
[1:26:14] in the age that we live in Christ is
[1:26:17] here yes tongues are here interpretation
[1:26:19] is here but Christ himself is here and
[1:26:23] he is the word of the hour and if he's
[1:26:26] here as we've said many times Anything
[1:26:28] is Possible
[1:26:35] you realize why the Catholics are so
[1:26:37] reverent in church
[1:26:39] because they believe that Christ is
[1:26:42] present in the host
[1:26:44] right that's a doctrine that they have
[1:26:46] that Christ is present in the host and
[1:26:49] so once the priest says abracadabra
[1:26:52] then it has literally changed into the
[1:26:56] presence of Christ
[1:26:57] into the body of Christ
[1:27:00] they believe that
[1:27:02] and so they're very reverent
[1:27:04] in the church because of that and
[1:27:06] Protestant churches are not
[1:27:08] you realize what brother Branham taught
[1:27:10] us
[1:27:11] you realize what he taught us we don't
[1:27:13] believe that the communion bread is the
[1:27:15] literal presence of Christ
[1:27:17] we don't believe that that becomes the
[1:27:19] body of Christ we do believe that you
[1:27:22] are the body of Christ
[1:27:25] we do believe that Christ has come in
[1:27:28] our day
[1:27:29] in word form
[1:27:32] oh God revealed himself to us that's
[1:27:35] what I was trying to show you by the the
[1:27:37] prophet and the discernment and all
[1:27:39] those things don't you realize what what
[1:27:41] we're doing if we're not careful we
[1:27:42] begin to go back and look at all these
[1:27:44] things and think well you know we we
[1:27:46] have gifts and we have different things
[1:27:48] operating and that's wonderful but where
[1:27:50] are we at Christ is here there ought to
[1:27:53] be such a reverence in our hearts
[1:27:55] there ought to be such a when we meet
[1:27:57] together the body of Christ is coming
[1:27:59] together when he's here without that to
[1:28:02] do to us if we really had a revelation
[1:28:05] of that if Jesus Christ was here in his
[1:28:08] person brother Madam says that he said
[1:28:10] if he come in with blood stains and
[1:28:12] everything how would we treat him
[1:28:14] what what kind of attitude would we have
[1:28:16] towards him he said but that couldn't
[1:28:18] even be him it couldn't even be real if
[1:28:21] he come in with blood with because he
[1:28:23] won't do that until we until after the
[1:28:25] Rapture
[1:28:26] till he comes back on a white horse so
[1:28:28] it couldn't even be him but he's here
[1:28:31] tonight
[1:28:32] how are we to treat every service we
[1:28:35] don't play with it
[1:28:37] we don't mess around we don't want to
[1:28:39] get out of order but yet we want the
[1:28:41] spirit of God to have freedom we want
[1:28:44] God to be able to move
[1:28:47] we should be in the deepest sincerity
[1:28:49] even on a Wednesday night
[1:28:52] because Christ is here
[1:28:55] he came down in our age
[1:28:58] what that means is he can solve any
[1:28:59] problem
[1:29:01] now Paul gets talking about the midst of
[1:29:03] the Resurrection but look what he does
[1:29:05] in in First Corinthians 13 8 he said
[1:29:07] charity
[1:29:28] never
[1:29:30] faileth breaks away from the gifts in
[1:29:33] chapter 12 Goes To Love
[1:29:36] and it's agape love
[1:29:38] I've misunderstood that myself even in
[1:29:40] the past but he's not talking about just
[1:29:42] kindness
[1:29:44] or even filial love for one another but
[1:29:47] it's Agape God's love
[1:29:49] never fails
[1:29:51] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:29:53] shall fail
[1:29:54] so there's a human element
[1:29:56] whether it be tongues they shall cease
[1:29:58] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:29:59] vanish away these are gifts
[1:30:03] right these come and go
[1:30:05] these fall on the body they're among the
[1:30:07] body and sometimes sometimes they don't
[1:30:09] operate they don't operate in every
[1:30:11] service Paul said do all speak with
[1:30:12] tongues do all prophesy but the realm
[1:30:15] said if it's in any part of the church
[1:30:16] it's in all the church
[1:30:18] but but whether there be knowledge it'll
[1:30:20] vanish away
[1:30:22] but charity love doesn't fail
[1:30:25] and then he goes in chapter 15 and
[1:30:27] begins to talk about a change of a body
[1:30:28] now watch
[1:30:30] brother Brandon said I'd rather have a
[1:30:31] church that knows nothing about any
[1:30:34] spiritual gift and just be so in love
[1:30:37] with each other
[1:30:38] and with Christ I'd rather have that
[1:30:41] than every spiritual gift operating in
[1:30:43] the church
[1:30:46] whether it's gifts they'll fail
[1:30:48] where there is gifts they'll bring
[1:30:50] confusion
[1:30:51] where there is gifts they can be
[1:30:53] questioned
[1:30:54] but where there is love it's perfect
[1:31:00] now what she said that's right
[1:31:02] he said and if you had perfect love
[1:31:04] you'd have perfect gifts
[1:31:07] Hallelujah see if you operated your gift
[1:31:10] out of love
[1:31:12] you'd have perfect gifts there'd be no
[1:31:13] failing in that
[1:31:15] that's right he said so work first with
[1:31:17] love that brings Fellowship
[1:31:20] oh my and fellowship brings gifts
[1:31:24] musicians go ahead and come
[1:31:26] brother random goes beyond the curtain
[1:31:27] of time
[1:31:29] I'm so glad God allowed him to do that
[1:31:32] steps into another dimension
[1:31:34] and he sees people there
[1:31:37] and he realizes then that it's not just
[1:31:39] just you know a spirit on a cloud
[1:31:43] it's people
[1:31:45] right
[1:31:46] you've all heard the story three of
[1:31:48] people
[1:31:49] he's beyond the curtain of time
[1:31:51] and he talks about there's no words that
[1:31:53] could even describe it
[1:31:55] no words that could even describe it he
[1:31:57] said but it was perfect love
[1:31:59] perfect love
[1:32:02] what I said about the gifts tonight
[1:32:03] again I don't believe it's a Salvation
[1:32:05] issue in the sense of how that they
[1:32:07] operate and maybe one person might be
[1:32:10] looser in their Church order than
[1:32:11] somebody else I I wouldn't separate
[1:32:13] Fellowship over that but whatever you do
[1:32:17] get perfect love
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:20] yeah right is that what a prophet of God
[1:32:22] told us
[1:33:20] foreign
[1:34:27] should I ask God for of
[1:34:34] if I love you more
[1:34:42] because you filled me with your Holy
[1:34:45] Spirit
[1:34:54] that
[1:35:56] foreign
[1:36:10] Corinthians were up to where we are
[1:36:13] today another Ephesians perfect love
[1:36:16] without perfect love you won't enter
[1:36:18] there would you bow your heads with me
[1:36:20] without perfect love I won't enter there
[1:36:23] we've got to have that
[1:36:27] I
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] you might disagree with somebody you
[1:36:31] might disagree with me tonight that's
[1:36:33] your privilege I
[1:36:35] I could be wrong
[1:36:37] but we know the word of God Is Right
[1:36:41] and we know that God's purpose
[1:36:44] is to get us there
[1:36:46] should be the purpose of every gift the
[1:36:48] edification of the body the building up
[1:36:50] the growing of the body his purpose is
[1:36:53] to get us there
[1:36:54] so his purpose is to perfect love in
[1:36:58] every one of our hearts

[1:37:01] tonight I want to pray like that
[1:37:04] Lord give me perfect love like just a
[1:37:06] small group of us here tonight

[1:37:13] own way Lord I want that perfect love

[1:37:18] just what I do in church I love to see
[1:37:22] the the shouting and the and and the
[1:37:24] worship and and I want to see more and
[1:37:27] more of it here among us but it's not
[1:37:29] just what we do in the sanctuary
