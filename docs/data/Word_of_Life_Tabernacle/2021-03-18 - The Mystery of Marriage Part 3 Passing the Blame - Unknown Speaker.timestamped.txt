[39:19] amen isn't that always on your mind
[39:22] amen god bless you you could be seated
[39:25] for just a moment
[39:28] this evening and i've got just a couple
[39:31] things i wanted to
[39:32] talk about and isn't it good to be in
[39:34] church tonight
[39:36] good to see all of you here and and i
[39:39] see
[39:39] jt you made it tonight i wasn't sure
[39:41] you'd come with the weather and things
[39:43] but it looks like it cleared up for us i
[39:45] was looking at the forecast it looked
[39:47] like we were going to have some bad
[39:48] weather about church time and
[39:50] and i was looking at something brother
[39:53] branham had
[39:53] said about how the storm in colorado
[39:56] stopped i said lord
[39:57] i know you could do that for us too and
[40:00] we got to
[40:01] i got to look and there's tornadoes up
[40:03] in missouri and there's tornadoes in
[40:05] mississippi on the other side but it
[40:06] just kind of
[40:07] left arkansas out and and so i believe
[40:10] god can do that
[40:11] and if you made an effort to be here
[40:13] tonight there's a reason for that
[40:15] god wanted you to be here and and i
[40:17] believe if you make that effort god will
[40:19] bless you do you believe that
[40:21] god will bless you amen so good to be in
[40:25] the house of the lord tonight
[40:26] brother david did you bring your guitar
[40:28] tonight you don't have it
[40:30] well if you hear sunday would you sing
[40:31] for us sunday
[40:33] um we'll be glad to have you sing and
[40:35] for the howard wants to
[40:36] wants to help we let him sing as well i
[40:39] i keep coming out and seeing you guys
[40:40] here and i'd like to hear you sing
[40:42] sometime
[40:43] amen um i just had a couple of things we
[40:47] were at camp
[40:49] i've been in a bunch of services over
[40:51] the last few days
[40:53] so if i'm just a little bit over the top
[40:55] tonight you pray for me because
[40:58] i i don't intend to be but we've man
[41:01] we've been in church
[41:02] and i think this is the eighth service
[41:05] that i've been in since last wednesday
[41:07] night
[41:08] and so i didn't preach any of those
[41:11] since last wednesday but i
[41:12] got to be a part and i i'm thankful for
[41:15] that and
[41:16] we got to take peter and i want to thank
[41:17] you again for giving us the opportunity
[41:19] to go
[41:20] and uh and do that and i don't take that
[41:23] lightly
[41:24] and uh of course we greeted the people
[41:27] there for you and brother wendell and
[41:28] his church and some
[41:29] brother tim's church was there and got
[41:31] to spend some time with brother timothy
[41:33] we're old friends and
[41:34] got to spend some time with joe adams
[41:37] and different ones that were there and
[41:38] so i'm glad that they were there and
[41:40] we got to be there and peter got to
[41:42] fellowship and and
[41:44] be blessed by the services but the
[41:45] atmosphere was just so wonderful and
[41:48] and i know that god wants wants us to be
[41:51] free
[41:52] and that doesn't mean that we'll shout
[41:54] and and and scream every service but it
[41:56] does mean that we can be free
[41:58] and in the spirit of god we're not bound
[42:01] by denominationalism we're not bound by
[42:04] things of the world we can be free we
[42:06] believe in a gospel that can set you
[42:09] free tonight and
[42:10] so we don't have to be bound and and so
[42:13] that's it's on my heart that we would be
[42:15] free to worship god just any way the
[42:17] lord would lay on our hearts and
[42:19] but god's been doing some things for us
[42:22] i
[42:23] was here a few days ago
[42:27] on a sunday i came out here sister
[42:29] victoria was sitting out here
[42:31] on the parking lot in early and
[42:35] she was sitting there and i went up to
[42:36] her car and and she was
[42:38] crying she said i don't know where to
[42:40] bend if i'm going to be able to come
[42:43] here much longer because of my eyes and
[42:45] the condition of my eyes and
[42:47] and i understand that we prayed with her
[42:49] and i said well let's just believe god
[42:51] will do something about that and
[42:53] and uh we prayed with her and i got word
[42:56] that hurt she didn't have to have a shot
[42:59] in her eyes she'd been going having a
[43:00] shot every once in a while and they told
[43:01] her she didn't have to have that if i
[43:03] understood correctly
[43:05] and that she uh also that they didn't
[43:07] want to see her for a while
[43:09] so praise the lord for that i i believe
[43:12] god did that for her
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:15] i was telling brother allen sometimes it
[43:16] seems like the people that
[43:18] um that it's most rewarding to serve
[43:21] those in the church that
[43:23] can do the least for you and you'll find
[43:26] that's true just in life
[43:28] that it's most rewarding to serve people
[43:30] and sometimes
[43:31] the part that seems to be the most
[43:33] feeble paul says
[43:35] is the most necessary so we need to
[43:37] remember that especially with our
[43:39] elderly folks and
[43:40] i went to see brother jp yesterday and
[43:42] today
[43:43] after he got out of the hospital and
[43:45] kind of making up for lost time but
[43:47] he seems to be doing much better as well
[43:49] and so we appreciate your prayers
[43:51] i believe god did that for him god
[43:53] brother david white is
[43:55] is in branson celebrating with his
[43:58] family well that's a big deal because
[44:01] you know it not long ago he was on a
[44:03] deathbed in
[44:04] in many ways and so we thank god for
[44:06] that and i believe god wants to do
[44:08] miraculous things for us
[44:11] but you can't do anything for us unless
[44:12] we expect it from him
[44:15] you have to expect it if you don't
[44:18] expect
[44:18] god to be able to move in the preaching
[44:21] of the word and the
[44:22] singing or whatever if you don't come
[44:23] expecting
[44:25] then you can't get anything from god
[44:28] you'd be better off going to a self-help
[44:30] lecture somewhere
[44:31] but but we don't we don't expect just
[44:35] in my mind need to be able to come up
[44:37] with something that'll
[44:38] fix your situations or help you but we
[44:40] do expect
[44:42] that god could come down and change what
[44:45] i'm going to say
[44:47] and direct it directly where it needs to
[44:49] be and say the things that need to be
[44:51] said
[44:52] and heal the sick and and and touch the
[44:55] person that needs to be touched we
[44:56] believe in a god like that do you
[44:58] believe that today
[44:59] now brother daryl ward is going to be
[45:00] with us on easter
[45:03] and that service will be saturday night
[45:05] at six o'clock
[45:06] and then sunday morning at 10 30 on
[45:09] easter so you all
[45:10] invite your friends and your relatives
[45:12] and i believe god will bless us with
[45:13] that
[45:14] brother someone told me brother wayne
[45:17] lawson's going to be at brother matt
[45:18] morris's the church that brother matt
[45:20] morris pastors
[45:22] that are in blackrock tomorrow night so
[45:24] if you want to go fellowship with them
[45:25] that would be good as well
[45:27] let's stand together i'll probably do
[45:29] that i've been in church so many times i
[45:31] might as well go
[45:32] again right so
[45:35] we're just blessed to be in the house of
[45:37] the lord i watched those kids they were
[45:39] so excited to be in a camp after being
[45:42] shut up all year
[45:43] and just seemed like it just just kind
[45:45] of uh
[45:47] they got so enthused and maybe some
[45:50] people might say over
[45:51] enthused but you know and someone might
[45:53] say well maybe
[45:54] one just copied another and that's
[45:56] probably true in some cases but
[45:59] you know what you can also copy another
[46:00] person sitting like a bump on a log
[46:05] that's not good either so we need to
[46:07] always follow the lord and
[46:09] i believe we should worship god with all
[46:11] of our hearts tonight did you come
[46:12] expecting something from
[46:14] god and i believe god can give you what
[46:16] you have need of tonight
[46:17] i want to finish this this particular
[46:21] thought of marriage tonight on
[46:23] the mystery of marriage and he said
[46:25] brother ben why are you preaching on
[46:26] this well because god told me
[46:28] to and i can't not i have a contract
[46:31] with god
[46:32] i can't not do what he tells me to do if
[46:34] i if i do that then i'm a hireling
[46:36] and you might as well get you another
[46:38] pastor but i believe god knows what he's
[46:41] doing and
[46:42] even when i don't know i have to leave
[46:44] that up to him amen
[46:46] and we should trust the lord to know the
[46:48] right things to say and think of it in a
[46:50] spiritual way tonight
[46:52] in genesis chapter 3 and verse 12.
[46:56] we'll read there in just a moment let's
[46:57] bow our heads for a word of prayer
[46:59] heavenly father we've talked and and
[47:02] talked about these good things that
[47:04] you've done
[47:04] for us but tonight lord i pray that
[47:08] we could now talk to you and knowing
[47:11] that unless you
[47:12] anoint the words that are spoken there's
[47:14] nothing that we could do
[47:15] to to bring it into the hearts of the
[47:17] people
[47:18] lord if you could by your spirit as we
[47:21] were lord
[47:22] rejoicing as i was rejoicing today and
[47:24] your prophet speaking of the messiah
[47:26] anointing that would come on the word
[47:28] and
[47:29] how that the word he said it always goes
[47:32] with that and
[47:33] it can speak directly to the heart i
[47:35] pray god that
[47:36] you would do that tonight i pray you'd
[47:39] calm every spirit i pray that you'd work
[47:41] in every life
[47:42] and every heart and every home god
[47:45] you're the only one that can do that
[47:47] i can't do it but i know that you can
[47:50] and i trust
[47:51] lord that you are able to move lord
[47:54] tonight in this service i pray every
[47:56] every bond of the enemy would be broken
[47:59] lord and that you would come
[48:01] and that you would just move among us as
[48:02] only you can in jesus name amen
[48:06] amen genesis 3 12 and the man said
[48:10] the woman who now gave us to be with me
[48:11] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[48:14] and the lord god said unto the woman
[48:15] what is this that thou hast done
[48:18] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[48:20] me and i did eat
[48:23] everyone had someone to blame pray lord
[48:26] without his blessing to the word you may
[48:27] be seated
[48:34] i read a story once
[48:38] about a minor league baseball team that
[48:40] the manager was getting irate
[48:42] at his center fielder because he was
[48:45] kept making errors and finally he got so
[48:48] mad he ran out there and he grabbed him
[48:50] he said go to the dugout i'll do it
[48:51] myself
[48:52] and so he runs out in the field and and
[48:55] the first
[48:56] thing that comes up took a bad hop and
[48:58] hit the manager right in the mouth
[49:01] the next ball is a high fly ball and he
[49:03] loses it in the sun it lands on top his
[49:05] head
[49:07] the next ball is is a line drive and he
[49:10] rushes towards it to get it and it hits
[49:12] him right in the eye
[49:14] and so he gets so upset and he runs as
[49:16] fast as he can go to the
[49:18] dugout and he grabs the center fielder
[49:20] by the shirt and he said see what you've
[49:22] done
[49:22] you got center field so messed up not
[49:24] even i can make it work
[49:28] it's easy it's always easy to blame
[49:30] somebody isn't it
[49:34] but you know there's something about
[49:36] marriage that makes it hard
[49:38] to blame the other party
[49:41] and and what makes it so hard is that
[49:43] it's a completely unique
[49:45] institution it's a unique institution
[49:48] you find that even reflected in the laws
[49:50] of the nation and things like that
[49:51] because
[49:52] it's unique in the idea that it's it's
[49:54] no longer a
[49:56] a dual entity but it's a single entity
[50:01] and it was god's idea right so if
[50:04] marriage is god's idea
[50:07] who should set the rules for it he
[50:10] should right but now
[50:13] he it's his idea and that's what makes
[50:14] it unique and that's why
[50:16] gay marriage will never work
[50:19] and it's why marriages that are not
[50:22] joined together by god will never work
[50:26] because it was god's idea in the first
[50:29] place
[50:30] marriage belonged to god because in that
[50:33] union he would represent
[50:35] himself he would represent the entire
[50:38] mystery of redemption for the caleb in
[50:41] in a marriage
[50:43] and he wants to he wanted to manifest
[50:46] that in
[50:47] the man and his wife and and so the lord
[50:50] god said it is not good that the man
[50:51] should be alone who said that
[50:53] god did he said i will make a help meet
[50:56] for him
[50:58] right what's he saying it's my idea and
[51:01] if it's god's idea it doesn't matter
[51:02] whether they change the laws in
[51:03] washington
[51:04] it's still it's god that matters what he
[51:08] said about it and so brother branham
[51:11] says that this way said marriage
[51:12] is the oldest institution in the world
[51:14] marriage was performed first
[51:15] and instituted in the garden of eden
[51:18] it's
[51:18] that was the first wedding right there
[51:20] in the garden and god designed it he
[51:23] made it what it was
[51:24] it was a perfect institution and god
[51:27] makes the rules for how it works and how
[51:30] it's supposed to work
[51:32] then we have to come to the word on that
[51:34] now
[51:36] and even in a spiritual sense now i want
[51:39] us to go to matthew chapter 19 and verse
[51:41] 3
[51:43] matthew chapter 19 and verse 3 and look
[51:46] at
[51:47] what jesus thought about marriage as far
[51:50] as the uniqueness of this institution
[51:51] like i said it's not
[51:53] a duality it's one
[51:56] it's two people actually becoming one
[51:59] entity
[52:00] and so the pharisees come to jesus
[52:02] tempting him and said unto him
[52:03] is it awful for a man to put away his
[52:05] wife for
[52:06] every cause for every cause
[52:10] now jesus does make the exception but
[52:13] watch the rule
[52:14] sometimes we judge by the exception well
[52:16] jesus said that he could put her away
[52:18] for committing fornication
[52:19] but what's the rule that's the exception
[52:21] to the rule
[52:23] the rule is he said answered and said to
[52:25] them have you not read
[52:26] he which made them at the beginning made
[52:28] them male and female
[52:30] he did it he's responsible for it and
[52:33] said for this cause shall a man leave
[52:35] father and mother and shall cleave to
[52:36] his wife
[52:37] and they twain two shall be one flesh
[52:41] one flesh and verse six he said
[52:44] wherefore there are no more twain
[52:46] but one flesh what therefore god has
[52:48] joined together
[52:50] let not man put asunder so he said god
[52:54] performed the wedding then man shouldn't
[52:56] split it up
[52:59] that makes sense or we're quiet tonight
[53:04] what god has joined together i'll just
[53:06] read what the prophet said about it what
[53:07] god has joined together let no man put a
[53:09] center
[53:10] asunder not what man joined together
[53:11] what god joined together
[53:13] and brother branham says when you've got
[53:14] a direct revelation from god that that's
[53:16] your wife and the same thing
[53:18] he said that's yours the rest of your
[53:21] life
[53:22] that's what we need is a revelation from
[53:24] god
[53:26] i want us to look at genesis chapter 12
[53:29] and verse 1
[53:30] as we continue to kind of lay a
[53:32] background this this evening for what we
[53:34] want to say
[53:35] in a spiritual sense but we look at
[53:38] abraham and sarah
[53:40] and how that god saw them and the lord
[53:43] had said unto abraham get thee out of
[53:44] thy country
[53:46] from thy kindred from my father's house
[53:48] unto a land that i will
[53:50] show thee notice what he says get out of
[53:53] your country get away from your kin
[53:55] get away from your father's house and
[53:56] what does abraham do now watch
[53:59] he did right there what god told him not
[54:01] to do
[54:02] isn't that what gets us in trouble so
[54:03] many times but he said he did what god
[54:06] told him not to do he took lot his
[54:08] nephew
[54:09] and abraham took his daddy but he never
[54:11] told him to take his daddy
[54:12] but he took him anyhow he said in any
[54:15] bible reader you read this in genesis
[54:17] tomorrow when you have time
[54:18] he said notice that it was a fly in the
[54:20] ointment until the old man died
[54:22] he was a stumbling block all the way
[54:24] along and so was lot
[54:26] god called abraham not lot he called
[54:29] abraham not his daddy
[54:31] remember god spoke only to abraham he
[54:34] didn't speak to anybody else
[54:37] including sarah do you ever think about
[54:41] that
[54:42] he didn't speak to sarah in fact he
[54:44] doesn't speak to sarah
[54:46] until she laughs
[54:50] right and he said why did sarah laugh
[54:54] in that conversation she overhears the
[54:56] conversation
[54:57] that that that abraham has with the
[54:59] angel but he
[55:01] never reveals this to her directly he
[55:03] reveals it
[55:04] to abraham so that would be the question
[55:07] then if he said get away from your
[55:09] kindred
[55:09] get away from all the people that are
[55:11] holding you back
[55:12] then why didn't you have to get away
[55:13] from sarah and brother branham answered
[55:16] that he said well you say what about
[55:17] sarah
[55:18] he said a man and his wife are one
[55:21] amen now i hope you can see this tonight
[55:24] in a spiritual sense that
[55:26] when what god has joined together let no
[55:29] man put asunder
[55:30] a man and his wife for one when god
[55:32] calls
[55:33] abraham he was implicitly calling sarah
[55:38] at the same time
[55:43] amen and so what does he say
[55:47] they are one flesh the bible says so
[55:50] and so brother branham says this and
[55:52] you've heard this before and i know
[55:53] you've quoted it
[55:54] he said well you say what about sarah
[55:56] i'm sorry the next quote he said i
[55:57] believe that when god calls a man to
[55:59] service
[56:00] if he's a married man and has a help
[56:02] mate he calls his wife with him
[56:04] because they too are one
[56:08] amen they're one flesh amen
[56:12] now look in 1963 and go away jesus
[56:15] we find we'll fast forward to that
[56:17] moment when sarah laughs at the promise
[56:20] of god
[56:21] she laughs and if she was expendable
[56:25] at that moment at that moment of doubt
[56:29] i hope you're hearing me tonight but at
[56:32] that moment of
[56:33] of insecurity at that moment when she
[56:35] said it can't be done
[56:36] and at that moment when she said there's
[56:38] no way if if she was expendable at that
[56:41] moment
[56:41] if she was because she wasn't the one
[56:43] that heard the voice she was not the one
[56:45] that heard directly from god but david
[56:47] but if she was expendable
[56:50] then she would have been killed right
[56:51] there
[56:53] notice that she said she ran out and
[56:54] confessed i didn't say but you did
[56:57] see because he knew the secret of her
[56:59] heart see not only did she
[57:01] did she laugh but she lied about it and
[57:04] brother brown said now god would have
[57:06] took her life right there
[57:08] but he couldn't hurt her
[57:11] amen first she's part of abraham
[57:15] amen do we believe that tonight do we
[57:18] really understand that
[57:20] that he can't hurt that which is a part
[57:23] of himself amen he can't hurt that which
[57:26] was a part of abraham
[57:28] he said oh we'd be gone long ago if it
[57:31] wasn't part of christ
[57:34] amen all the things that he's done and
[57:37] we've run around and said it's telepathy
[57:38] assists that or the other
[57:40] but he can't touch you hey man that's
[57:43] why you don't judge a marriage on one
[57:45] bad moment
[57:46] you don't judge a christian on one bad
[57:49] moment
[57:50] you understand because why and that
[57:52] ought to give us faith
[57:54] shouldn't it and that's not hard for us
[57:56] to understand we don't
[57:57] we don't judge people just on a bad
[57:59] moment if we did and every time
[58:01] like the pharisees would judge their
[58:03] wives on one bad moment they'd put her
[58:04] away they'd put her away for not washing
[58:06] the dishes right
[58:07] they put her away for not doing this but
[58:08] the bible says god hates putting away
[58:13] and and we know these things get mixed
[58:15] up sometimes and sometimes people can't
[58:17] help it
[58:17] but god intended what god joined
[58:19] together let no man
[58:21] put us under so but every time you
[58:23] messed up he didn't put you away
[58:26] you say what about israel look at israel
[58:28] for a moment
[58:29] look at his i've had a few days to
[58:31] ponder these things and thinking about
[58:33] it
[58:33] look at israel here she god put them
[58:36] away
[58:37] and took the gentile bride right israel
[58:40] was his wife he put took
[58:42] he put them away took a gentile bride
[58:44] but what does he do
[58:46] he does not forsake his people
[58:51] but he goes back amen after the gentile
[58:54] age is over and he goes
[58:55] right back to them the gospel goes right
[58:58] back to them
[59:00] right he can't do away with them
[59:02] completely
[59:03] he can't make a full end there has to be
[59:05] a remnant there had to be a hundred and
[59:07] forty four thousand
[59:08] don't that give you confidence in when
[59:09] he deals with you
[59:11] he dealt with them so severely that even
[59:14] when dan and eve from when there was a
[59:15] an idol in dan and ephraim's place there
[59:19] and he cut them out even in the
[59:20] millennium it didn't even show
[59:22] as a part of the 144 thousand but in the
[59:24] new heavens and the new earth they were
[59:26] back there again
[59:28] god never lost a wife
[59:32] i hope you hear me today oh if it was
[59:36] really his wife it was really his
[59:38] his people his elect they're part of him
[59:40] he can't lose them
[59:44] he couldn't hurt her for she was part of
[59:46] abraham he said oh we'd be going long
[59:48] ago if it wasn't part of christ
[59:50] all the things that he's done we've went
[59:52] around and said it's telepathy it's just
[59:53] out of the other but he can't touch you
[59:55] brother brown says wrath can't touch you
[59:58] that ought to be a reason to be excited
[1:00:00] tonight
[1:00:01] i can tell i've been in more church than
[1:00:02] you all have been in lately
[1:00:06] wrath can't touch you amen
[1:00:10] because you're part of christ when
[1:00:11] you're born again see he couldn't do it
[1:00:14] because
[1:00:14] it would hurt abraham so for him to put
[1:00:18] you away as the bride
[1:00:19] would hurt christ
[1:00:23] amen amen
[1:00:26] that's why we do everything we can to
[1:00:28] salvage a marriage everything we can to
[1:00:30] salvage a home
[1:00:31] because god he does it easily what does
[1:00:33] he do he tells even
[1:00:35] he deals with israel in such a way that
[1:00:37] he deals with her like
[1:00:38] he told the pro the prophet i believe it
[1:00:40] was jose go down and find an adulterous
[1:00:42] woman find a prostitute a heart
[1:00:45] marry her and then she commits all these
[1:00:47] things and he said go buy her back
[1:00:51] he said that's the way i dealt with
[1:00:52] israel why she
[1:00:54] it was his people he couldn't do it
[1:00:57] because it hurt abraham his promise was
[1:00:59] to abraham and sarah is the part of
[1:01:00] abraham
[1:01:01] and the church is a part of christ see
[1:01:02] the bride see he couldn't do it although
[1:01:04] her unbelief
[1:01:06] i'm glad he never judged me on my
[1:01:08] weakest moment
[1:01:12] hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:01:15] that he doesn't judge you based on your
[1:01:17] weakest moment but you're judged in
[1:01:19] christ
[1:01:20] you're judging him there on the cross
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:24] amen listen
[1:01:28] he says a woman marry a man now now look
[1:01:31] to have this kind of a oneness there has
[1:01:34] to be agreement
[1:01:37] there has to be agreement you've got to
[1:01:39] agree with god that he'll take your sins
[1:01:41] from you
[1:01:43] you've got to agree with god you can't
[1:01:44] say now lord i'll keep them i'll just
[1:01:46] keep my own name my own identity no
[1:01:49] that's not how it works in order to be
[1:01:52] married to christ
[1:01:52] the word you've got to agree with him
[1:01:56] amen he said if if a woman marries a man
[1:02:00] and disagreeing with him it would be
[1:02:01] some kind of a fuss
[1:02:02] continually right and we laugh you know
[1:02:06] they had an old tv show called the
[1:02:07] honeymooners i think it was they're
[1:02:09] always just griping at each other
[1:02:11] and we laugh at that but that's not how
[1:02:13] marriage works
[1:02:16] because if you're constantly in
[1:02:17] disagreement eventually
[1:02:19] you're not really one you understand
[1:02:22] you've got to come together on something
[1:02:24] he said when a man and his wife his
[1:02:26] girlfriend is espoused
[1:02:28] when they are in perfect harmony so the
[1:02:30] time to get in harmony
[1:02:31] is not after you get married
[1:02:34] right and i know there's not very many
[1:02:36] of you eligible to get married tonight
[1:02:38] and
[1:02:38] but if there is maybe it's just my kids
[1:02:40] and some of these younger ones but
[1:02:42] if you're looking for a wife i'm happily
[1:02:46] married i'm not looking
[1:02:48] and i'm so glad that i'm married but you
[1:02:51] know the the time for agreement is
[1:02:53] before
[1:02:55] my wife and i came to an agreement
[1:02:58] before we got married and
[1:02:59] and one of the things we agreed on was
[1:03:01] was in ministry
[1:03:03] and i told her i said i'll always
[1:03:04] involve you in the decision but if god
[1:03:06] speaks to my heart
[1:03:08] to take to pastor a church to be
[1:03:10] somewhere to go somewhere
[1:03:12] i i i want the i have to have the
[1:03:14] liberty to do that
[1:03:16] and she's always given that to me she's
[1:03:18] never questioned me on that
[1:03:20] and and that but that's part of the
[1:03:22] agreement
[1:03:24] right and i told her i'd always involve
[1:03:26] her and i always would i wouldn't make a
[1:03:27] decision like that just out of nowhere
[1:03:29] but yet there was an agreement we
[1:03:31] we made and we decided that before we
[1:03:34] got married
[1:03:35] because being married to a preacher is
[1:03:37] hard work
[1:03:39] right and being married to anybody's
[1:03:41] hard work
[1:03:44] but it's worth it but now
[1:03:47] he says when a man and his wife his
[1:03:49] girlfriend is espoused when they're in
[1:03:51] perfect harmony like one soul and mind
[1:03:53] because they're going to be one flesh
[1:03:56] amen he said then when the church can
[1:03:57] get in such harmony with god
[1:03:59] until the manifestation listen to this
[1:04:01] the manifestation of the bridegroom
[1:04:05] is manifested in the bride
[1:04:08] hallelujah there is so much harmony
[1:04:11] because
[1:04:12] until the manifestation of the
[1:04:13] bridegroom is manifested in the bride
[1:04:16] what did the bridegroom do brother joe
[1:04:17] if you go back and look what did the
[1:04:19] bridegroom do the bridegroom
[1:04:21] had wherever he went he he healed the
[1:04:24] people that were there where
[1:04:25] the healing followed signs wonders and
[1:04:27] miracles and what did he say he said
[1:04:29] these signs shall follow them that
[1:04:30] believe
[1:04:32] right then if there's harmony that's got
[1:04:35] to be in the church
[1:04:37] if there's harmony you and i have to
[1:04:40] become the word in that sense
[1:04:41] right we we become a portion of that
[1:04:44] word for our day
[1:04:45] we become the light of our hour in that
[1:04:47] sense because why because that's what he
[1:04:49] was
[1:04:50] he was the word of his day but we become
[1:04:52] the word of our day
[1:04:54] and that's not nothing great you say
[1:04:57] well that means i have to know all the
[1:04:58] mysteries no it just means you
[1:05:00] manifest out of your life the word of
[1:05:02] what a
[1:05:03] what a husband should be what a what a
[1:05:05] what a believer should be at the end
[1:05:08] time when hard times come you don't give
[1:05:10] up
[1:05:11] why he didn't give up in gethsemane
[1:05:14] he didn't give up when the hard times
[1:05:16] come when the storms come you have the
[1:05:18] the power and the ability to speak to
[1:05:20] the waves and
[1:05:22] and they're still why you say well how
[1:05:24] do i have that yes you do
[1:05:25] if you're a part of him why because the
[1:05:29] manifestation of the bridegroom is
[1:05:30] manifested in the bride you're in
[1:05:32] agreement
[1:05:35] but the problem is and
[1:05:39] i didn't intend to dwell on this but you
[1:05:40] just hang with me for a moment
[1:05:42] the problem is so many times we get out
[1:05:44] of agreement
[1:05:46] and we get on a in a spiritual tiff with
[1:05:49] god where we're
[1:05:50] we're kind of angry and we don't realize
[1:05:53] that we're angry at god we think we're
[1:05:54] angry at the pastor
[1:05:56] we think we're angry at somebody else we
[1:05:58] think we're angry maybe he had a spouse
[1:05:59] or
[1:06:00] children but that's not who we're really
[1:06:01] mad at we're really mad at god for
[1:06:03] allowing certain things to happen in our
[1:06:05] life
[1:06:06] but listen if we could ever come back in
[1:06:07] agreement with him and say lord i know
[1:06:10] you know what's best for me
[1:06:11] i know you've got my life planned out
[1:06:13] exactly how how it should be
[1:06:15] i know all things are pre-planned by god
[1:06:18] and if that's the case i'm not going to
[1:06:19] be mad at you anymore
[1:06:20] i want to be in fellowship with you
[1:06:23] because in order to
[1:06:24] have this manifestation in the bride
[1:06:26] you've got to have agreement
[1:06:28] you've got to agree with the word you've
[1:06:30] got to say i may not be able to live it
[1:06:32] like i want to
[1:06:33] i may not be where i want to be but i'm
[1:06:34] not where i used to be
[1:06:36] and i know i'm i believe the word is
[1:06:38] true
[1:06:40] whether i can do it or not the word is
[1:06:42] true and then if i acknowledge i agree
[1:06:44] the word is true my husband will help me
[1:06:48] amen amen do you love him tonight
[1:06:53] he said the church can get in such
[1:06:54] harmony until that manifestation of the
[1:06:57] bridegroom is manifested in the brine
[1:07:00] we're going to dig deep tonight so just
[1:07:02] hang on brother brother said notice what
[1:07:04] harmony jesus never did
[1:07:05] anything until scene of the father or
[1:07:08] the father showed him first
[1:07:10] harmony between god and christ see john
[1:07:13] 5 and 19 sold the bride
[1:07:15] he shows her his word of life he shows
[1:07:18] her
[1:07:19] and she receives it she never
[1:07:22] doubts it because she knows that he
[1:07:26] knows best
[1:07:28] see we have something that even eve
[1:07:30] didn't have even adam could blame one
[1:07:32] another
[1:07:33] they blamed one another because they
[1:07:35] realized each was imperfect
[1:07:37] after the fall but we have one who's
[1:07:39] never fallen right and he shows us his
[1:07:43] word of life he shows her and she
[1:07:45] receives it
[1:07:46] she never doubts that nothing can harm
[1:07:48] her not even death but the seed be
[1:07:50] planted
[1:07:50] the water will rise and it raise it up
[1:07:52] again
[1:07:53] and this is where he wrote his word to
[1:07:55] the church with hell and he said i got a
[1:07:57] great big hallelujah
[1:08:00] brother branham was shouting on paper
[1:08:03] great big hallelujah
[1:08:05] he said here is the secret the word is
[1:08:06] in the bride and the mind of christ
[1:08:08] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:08:11] and she does it in his name
[1:08:13] she has thus saith the lord
[1:08:16] we really believe that tonight she has
[1:08:18] just said the lord
[1:08:20] she has this saith the lord then it is
[1:08:22] germatized so the holy spirit waters it
[1:08:24] until it has grown and serves its
[1:08:26] purpose
[1:08:28] now watch this this unity that comes
[1:08:31] in this peculiar relationship of
[1:08:33] marriage
[1:08:35] no other relationship shares both blame
[1:08:37] and credit
[1:08:39] like the marriage relationship there's
[1:08:42] nothing else like it
[1:08:44] now the truth is there is
[1:08:48] times there are times to use the correct
[1:08:51] english
[1:08:53] when someone is to blame especially
[1:08:57] in our natural relationships
[1:09:02] that's just the truth i've been to blame
[1:09:04] more times than i can count
[1:09:07] and a few times when i really wasn't
[1:09:14] you know that
[1:09:17] you've been wrong i've been wrong
[1:09:22] i think we need to recognize that
[1:09:25] i start to see each other as fallible
[1:09:27] human beings
[1:09:29] you know part of and maybe i over
[1:09:32] empathize in some ways
[1:09:33] but and i have to be careful with that
[1:09:35] because i don't want to hurt nobody
[1:09:37] it's not my nature it's not that's not
[1:09:39] the way i approach the gospel i don't
[1:09:40] want to hurt anybody
[1:09:41] but you do have to have empathy for
[1:09:44] people or you can't help them
[1:09:46] you have to be able to walk a little bit
[1:09:47] in their shoes so you can't help them
[1:09:51] and you realize that that you have to be
[1:09:53] able to understand
[1:09:55] that that's a human being and just
[1:09:57] because he said something
[1:09:59] maybe a preacher they even preached
[1:10:00] something that well i don't agree with
[1:10:02] that i'll tell you what
[1:10:03] that man's just a deceiver or maybe he
[1:10:05] just had a bad day
[1:10:08] you know what's in the news right now
[1:10:10] there's a young man who was a christian
[1:10:12] young man
[1:10:13] i don't know why i'm going here but just
[1:10:15] hang with me for a moment
[1:10:17] we're still early the young man was a
[1:10:20] christian young man
[1:10:21] and he he was a man a young man who
[1:10:24] struggled with lust
[1:10:26] and just i think yesterday the day
[1:10:28] before you heard in the news that all
[1:10:30] those
[1:10:31] massage parlors got shot up
[1:10:35] and the young man had went into the
[1:10:38] intro only he killed eight people
[1:10:42] in different massage parlors around
[1:10:45] atlanta
[1:10:46] he was going to kill more and they
[1:10:48] caught him
[1:10:49] but i thought it was striking because
[1:10:51] everybody is incensed all up in arms
[1:10:54] because the sheriff when they asked him
[1:10:56] about the young man they said they said
[1:10:58] what what happened what is he is he a
[1:11:00] terrorist is he
[1:11:01] is he crazy why did he do what he did
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:04] he said well he had this problem and he
[1:11:07] had a bad day
[1:11:13] and you look at that and the first thing
[1:11:14] you crossed your mind the same thing
[1:11:15] across everybody's mind
[1:11:16] a bad day i had bad days too i don't go
[1:11:20] shoot anybody up
[1:11:23] but he's human and the truth is that the
[1:11:27] potential is there
[1:11:30] in human beings there's a lot worse
[1:11:34] potential than that in human beings in
[1:11:37] flesh
[1:11:38] that's no better or worse than ours
[1:11:43] that's why paul calls it this body of
[1:11:45] this flesh he said oh wretched man that
[1:11:47] i am
[1:11:49] that potential is there but there's got
[1:11:51] to be something on the inside
[1:11:52] as the song said something keeps holding
[1:11:54] me there's got to be something there
[1:11:56] that overwhelms that in your life
[1:11:58] there's got to be something
[1:12:00] that keeps you something that i believe
[1:12:01] in a god that can keep you from every
[1:12:03] sin
[1:12:04] i believe in a god that can keep us from
[1:12:06] ever crossing the line
[1:12:08] but remember we're human he did have a
[1:12:10] bad day
[1:12:14] are you with me now you see when you're
[1:12:17] wrong you're wrong
[1:12:21] even if the other person is more wrong
[1:12:25] or wrong about something more important
[1:12:29] than you say well
[1:12:33] but but he's wrong but if you're wrong
[1:12:36] you're wrong
[1:12:38] and that's why jesus said judge not that
[1:12:40] you be not judged
[1:12:42] because you've got a moat in your own
[1:12:43] eye and you're trying to point out the
[1:12:44] speck in somebody else's eye
[1:12:47] right if you're wrong you're wrong
[1:12:50] that's hard for us as husbands and and
[1:12:52] fathers
[1:12:53] to get sometimes when we're wrong we're
[1:12:56] wrong
[1:12:58] and we could be wrong for years
[1:13:01] huh but people hold on to false ideas
[1:13:04] they hold on to false doctrine
[1:13:06] they hold on to false ways of doing
[1:13:08] things because that's the way daddy did
[1:13:09] them that's the way mama did them that's
[1:13:10] the way somebody else did them but they
[1:13:12] hold on to that but when you're wrong
[1:13:14] you're wrong
[1:13:16] regardless of who told you you're wrong
[1:13:18] or how you found out you were wrong
[1:13:21] and a little humility would tell you
[1:13:23] that even if the other person is more
[1:13:24] wrong you're still wrong
[1:13:30] you see eve was wrong the bible says
[1:13:34] adam was not deceived but the woman was
[1:13:35] in the transgression she was wrong
[1:13:38] she was wrong first she was wrong most
[1:13:43] because she did it out of deception and
[1:13:46] in some ways you could say well he's
[1:13:48] worse but he did it for a reason
[1:13:52] now brother branham says this he said we
[1:13:53] know god does not change we want to
[1:13:55] always remember this that we are finite
[1:13:57] and he's infinite infinite
[1:14:00] we should just stop there
[1:14:05] we should remember we're finite
[1:14:08] and that's why i try to tell you i i
[1:14:11] don't stand up here all the time and
[1:14:12] tell you well god did this and god did
[1:14:14] this and god spoke to me here i believe
[1:14:15] he does speak to me
[1:14:18] i wouldn't stand here unless i believe
[1:14:19] that he did
[1:14:21] i have to believe that you understand
[1:14:23] we're wasting our time
[1:14:25] but i'm finite i make mistakes
[1:14:28] but he's infinite and that's why the
[1:14:31] more i yield myself to him
[1:14:33] the better the preaching becomes the
[1:14:35] more i yield myself to him
[1:14:37] the better husband i become the more i
[1:14:40] yield myself to the word
[1:14:41] the better father i become are you with
[1:14:43] me now
[1:14:45] because i am finite he's infinite
[1:14:48] now if god ever makes a decision ever
[1:14:50] called to make a decision
[1:14:51] and god's decision being is infinite he
[1:14:53] has to continually stay
[1:14:55] with that decision unless he said see he
[1:14:58] said i can make you a promise and
[1:14:59] tomorrow
[1:15:00] i can say i was wrong why because
[1:15:02] brother branham was a man
[1:15:04] he said i can make you a promise and
[1:15:06] tomorrow i can say i was wrong
[1:15:07] and that's a different thing than to say
[1:15:10] or try to discredit the message
[1:15:12] because i know people are troubled by
[1:15:13] that today because we see so many that
[1:15:15] have tried to discredit the message
[1:15:16] no we believe the message
[1:15:19] saying brother branham is a man is just
[1:15:21] saying the message is true
[1:15:23] because that's what the message says
[1:15:25] that's what the messenger said
[1:15:27] but we believe the message come from god
[1:15:30] this the message was more than just a
[1:15:32] man
[1:15:35] we don't have anything without this
[1:15:37] message now he says
[1:15:38] he's infinite he has to continually stay
[1:15:40] with that decision he said i can make
[1:15:42] you a promise and tomorrow i can say i
[1:15:44] was wrong
[1:15:44] see i'll say i was mistaken i didn't
[1:15:46] mean to say that i see different now
[1:15:48] but god cannot because he's perfect
[1:15:51] you see sometimes we're just wrong
[1:15:54] and the more we admit i'll tell you this
[1:15:58] just in dealing with people the more you
[1:15:59] admit where you're wrong
[1:16:01] the easier it is to deal with other
[1:16:03] people who are more wrong
[1:16:08] brother branham and just to give you an
[1:16:09] example of this this this
[1:16:11] is fascinating to me and at the same
[1:16:12] time humbling
[1:16:15] because brother branham is on a hunting
[1:16:16] trip for his anniversary
[1:16:18] he does it for 20 years in a row
[1:16:21] and i i don't want any of you to get any
[1:16:23] ideas from that
[1:16:29] because the truth is sister media was
[1:16:32] built a certain way
[1:16:35] to be able to take that i've often
[1:16:37] wondered if brother branham's
[1:16:38] first wife hope had been alive
[1:16:42] if she could have taken what media took
[1:16:46] god knows what he's doing right
[1:16:49] but but you know so for 20 years every
[1:16:52] year he took her with him
[1:16:53] on a hunting trip for their honeymoon
[1:16:56] and then for 20 years he keeps going
[1:16:57] back
[1:16:58] leaves her at home every while other
[1:17:01] brother said sounds like
[1:17:02] a good time
[1:17:05] but it caused problems of course it
[1:17:08] would
[1:17:09] it caused big problems for me i mean
[1:17:16] now but she was built in such a way that
[1:17:18] could take it but he said walking up
[1:17:19] there he said i was going along now
[1:17:20] remember
[1:17:20] this is when brother branham it's
[1:17:23] amazing how
[1:17:24] god's servants can be where one moment
[1:17:27] they're speaking to the storm
[1:17:28] and another moment they're in the flesh
[1:17:31] and they're walking with god and they're
[1:17:34] thinking these thoughts that aren't
[1:17:35] right
[1:17:36] all right not sinful or lustful or
[1:17:38] anything but just thoughts that are need
[1:17:39] corrected
[1:17:42] it's true brother branham tells us that
[1:17:44] i don't listen
[1:17:45] he was walking with god remember the
[1:17:47] story how that he
[1:17:49] how the the storm the snowstorm that was
[1:17:50] coming and brother speaks to it and it
[1:17:52] stops
[1:17:55] we serve an incredible god don't we he
[1:17:58] speaks to it and it stops
[1:18:00] and then he said the angel lord told him
[1:18:03] walk with me
[1:18:04] and he's walking with god he said
[1:18:07] walking up there i was going along he
[1:18:09] said now this part he said i hope my
[1:18:11] wife don't get this
[1:18:12] tape he said but i'm going to tell you
[1:18:14] something
[1:18:15] he said i'll just tell you the truth i'm
[1:18:17] glad that he did
[1:18:18] he said that's the only way to do it he
[1:18:20] said i've often wondered why she didn't
[1:18:21] complain about me
[1:18:23] going on those trips on our anniversary
[1:18:25] now the mind is a strange thing
[1:18:28] because some of you would would die to
[1:18:30] have somebody that would not complain
[1:18:32] about your hunting trips
[1:18:36] i know none of you sisters complain
[1:18:37] about those things but
[1:18:40] i don't hunt so i can say that but
[1:18:43] there's things you know
[1:18:44] a wife would complain about that
[1:18:46] normally but brother brown begins to
[1:18:48] wonder why doesn't she complain
[1:18:53] he said you know what i had made up in
[1:18:54] my mind i said there's so many people
[1:18:56] around the house
[1:18:57] and always he said you know how i am
[1:18:59] nervous and everything
[1:19:01] he said i talk i want to talk about all
[1:19:02] i want to talk about is god the bible or
[1:19:04] something
[1:19:05] he said maybe she thinks it's a little
[1:19:06] rest for her
[1:19:08] right for him to be gone
[1:19:11] i know there's times that it is the rest
[1:19:14] for our wives when we're gone
[1:19:16] but he said maybe he's thinking this in
[1:19:18] his mind while he's walking with god
[1:19:22] he's thinking this he's being human
[1:19:25] right he's thinking that it's in his
[1:19:27] mind he says maybe he said she just
[1:19:29] thinks it's a little rest for her
[1:19:32] and he said there's so many people
[1:19:34] around the house
[1:19:35] he said and then i'm always he said
[1:19:38] you know how i am nervous and he said
[1:19:41] everything i want to talk about and he
[1:19:42] said
[1:19:42] she gave me away for a few days to go
[1:19:44] hunting he said i half thinking of that
[1:19:46] or
[1:19:46] like thinking in the back of your mind
[1:19:48] he said going along there
[1:19:51] he said then he said i'll apologize to
[1:19:53] her
[1:19:55] he said and i asked god and i'm asked
[1:19:57] god to forgive me
[1:19:58] for such thoughts they were wrong
[1:20:03] see when you're wrong you're wrong
[1:20:08] see sometimes we don't understand even
[1:20:10] the grace that god's given us in our own
[1:20:12] relationships
[1:20:15] sometimes we don't understand the grace
[1:20:17] that god's given us in our own life we
[1:20:19] second guess
[1:20:20] and we think well maybe maybe god just
[1:20:22] don't love me
[1:20:23] and that's the way he was doing with his
[1:20:25] wife maybe she maybe she really don't
[1:20:26] love me
[1:20:27] he said i was going along there i
[1:20:29] thought well my goodness she's a worker
[1:20:31] you know all the time when she's out in
[1:20:32] the kitchen or somewhere
[1:20:34] audi said any of you knows her that
[1:20:35] washing machine is going all the time
[1:20:38] and so i'd go out he said i'd pull her i
[1:20:41] said don't be washing like that
[1:20:42] talk to me see i love you i want you to
[1:20:45] tell me something
[1:20:46] tell me you do too and this is common in
[1:20:49] a relationship in a marriage
[1:20:51] one person says that more often than the
[1:20:53] other
[1:20:55] why brother because you're human
[1:20:58] right you're not going to be the same in
[1:21:01] every
[1:21:02] fleshly element but you're one flesh
[1:21:05] and you can be in agreement are you with
[1:21:08] me now
[1:21:09] praise the lord nobody is
[1:21:18] look brother branham continues he said
[1:21:20] any of you know sir that washington
[1:21:21] going all the time
[1:21:22] i already said that he she said well now
[1:21:24] what you know i do
[1:21:25] then write on washing just as hard as
[1:21:27] she ever was he'd say i don't want you
[1:21:29] to do that i want you to come in here
[1:21:30] and sit down by me oh bill i
[1:21:32] i got so much work to do and i thought
[1:21:34] well see going up here she gets time to
[1:21:36] do her work
[1:21:38] going along there thinking that he said
[1:21:41] now remember i laid
[1:21:42] this bible up here so you'd see i'm
[1:21:43] before the word as i was walking along
[1:21:46] something happened to me now look
[1:21:51] you see in his mind he's beginning to
[1:21:52] blame her and the truth is
[1:21:55] he had something that worked
[1:21:58] it worked don't take something that
[1:22:01] works for granted
[1:22:04] right just because you're not the couple
[1:22:07] that puts all the little cute pictures
[1:22:08] on facebook
[1:22:09] don't take something that works for
[1:22:11] granted
[1:22:14] right it works some of you all say man
[1:22:16] that just worked for a long time
[1:22:20] and he said first i was thinking about
[1:22:22] when i take her on the honeymoon up
[1:22:23] there
[1:22:24] and she was a pretty black headed brown
[1:22:26] eyed girl and i was looking
[1:22:27] over those logs and trying to get her up
[1:22:29] there this place where i'd killed some
[1:22:30] bear
[1:22:31] i wanted to show her one where i got
[1:22:33] this bear she had on my cowboy boots
[1:22:35] that's about 22 21 years before that
[1:22:38] he said i believe he said we were
[1:22:39] married in 1941. i was picking her up
[1:22:41] over these logs
[1:22:43] and i thought now poor little fellow
[1:22:45] putting up with me she's done turned
[1:22:47] gray
[1:22:48] yeah i thought well and i went him and i
[1:22:50] hadn't shaved for a few days and
[1:22:52] found out i was gray too i seen my beard
[1:22:54] sticking out here gray i thought oh boy
[1:22:56] you're just about finished now
[1:22:58] boy he had some thoughts didn't he while
[1:23:00] he was walking with god
[1:23:04] he said see you're going to do anything
[1:23:06] you better hurry up you're getting old
[1:23:07] too
[1:23:08] and so as i went along like that
[1:23:10] something taken place
[1:23:12] i just love the grace of god all of a
[1:23:15] sudden in every motion
[1:23:17] principle i was a boy i thought as a boy
[1:23:21] i had my head down and i looked up and
[1:23:24] just as plain
[1:23:25] as i ever saw her he said there she
[1:23:28] stood before me
[1:23:29] with her arms out
[1:23:32] that's what he was wanting he was
[1:23:34] wanting her to show
[1:23:36] and god said she loves you
[1:23:41] see you walk with god god it'll do
[1:23:43] wonders
[1:23:45] for your marriage
[1:23:48] he's just walking with god thinking
[1:23:50] these thoughts and all of a sudden he
[1:23:52] sees her with her arms out
[1:23:53] and i stopped and i rubbed my face and i
[1:23:55] looked and i said mida
[1:23:56] is that you honey i looked here and i
[1:24:00] thought now what's happened i thought
[1:24:01] yes
[1:24:02] i'm walking with him and it changed then
[1:24:05] i was back an old man
[1:24:07] and the vision was gone from the front
[1:24:08] of me but listen if you just keep
[1:24:10] walking with him
[1:24:11] god will set your thoughts right
[1:24:14] if you just keep walking with him god
[1:24:16] will get you corrected when you begin to
[1:24:18] thinking wrong
[1:24:19] what did he do he showed her him his
[1:24:21] wife with her arms out but he showed
[1:24:23] himself in a perfect body this is one of
[1:24:25] these days we're going to step into that
[1:24:29] amen amen we're going to step into that
[1:24:32] he let his prophets step into it to show
[1:24:34] us
[1:24:34] we're going to step into it one day
[1:24:38] if you walk with god see he'll correct
[1:24:40] your thinking
[1:24:42] i want you to notice this and i'm
[1:24:44] closing in just a few minutes
[1:24:47] but so if you're wrong you're wrong
[1:24:50] but you are always part of the solution
[1:24:52] even when you're wrong
[1:24:55] whatever the problem is in your marriage
[1:24:58] you are
[1:24:58] always part of the solution
[1:25:02] because you're one does that make sense
[1:25:06] she was part of the solution you can't
[1:25:09] say
[1:25:11] abraham couldn't say just throw sarah
[1:25:13] away remember what happened
[1:25:15] in hebrews 11 11 it says through faith
[1:25:18] also
[1:25:18] sarah herself received strength to
[1:25:21] conceive seed
[1:25:23] and was delivered of a child when she
[1:25:25] was past age
[1:25:26] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:25:28] promised remember we said she had a part
[1:25:30] because she was one with abraham
[1:25:32] listen you have a part today brother
[1:25:34] says this in the marriage of the lamb
[1:25:36] he said we know there's going to be a
[1:25:37] bride and there's going to be a wedding
[1:25:39] supper served in the skies
[1:25:40] that's just as sure to be as god is
[1:25:42] because it's his word
[1:25:43] and we know that those who are going to
[1:25:45] make up that bride is going to be his
[1:25:46] church
[1:25:47] and they're going to appear before him
[1:25:49] without spot or wrinkle
[1:25:51] how well you can't clean your garments
[1:25:56] you can't make them spotless but you can
[1:25:59] put them on
[1:26:03] see god didn't leave us without a part
[1:26:05] you understand we have a part
[1:26:07] a part to play listen he said
[1:26:10] they have the material he said they have
[1:26:13] the material on earth
[1:26:15] now to make themselves ready
[1:26:18] do we believe that tonight church amen
[1:26:21] he said if you notice it she has made
[1:26:24] herself ready
[1:26:26] so many says that the lord will take
[1:26:27] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:26:29] or from gambling
[1:26:30] or from lying or from stealing i'll
[1:26:32] serve him
[1:26:33] he said but that's up to you see you got
[1:26:34] to do something too
[1:26:36] they that overcome shall inherit all
[1:26:38] things they that overcome you have power
[1:26:40] to do it
[1:26:41] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:26:46] you can't just say well he'll do it when
[1:26:48] he gets time
[1:26:50] he'll do it when the time is right you
[1:26:52] know that's one as we were praying with
[1:26:53] the young people it's one of the things
[1:26:54] you
[1:26:55] really have to overcome with young
[1:26:56] people is well
[1:26:58] it's not the right time when i get older
[1:27:00] then i'll serve god no you need to serve
[1:27:02] him now the bible says today is the day
[1:27:05] of salvation
[1:27:06] now is the accepted time and satan
[1:27:09] leaving you scripture against you
[1:27:11] brother timothy was outside of the
[1:27:13] tabernacle the other night
[1:27:15] where there's a prayer line going on and
[1:27:16] i'm there praying with brother joe and
[1:27:18] some of the other ministers brother
[1:27:19] timothy went took a shower he thought
[1:27:21] the service was over he comes back we're
[1:27:23] still in a prayer line
[1:27:24] and there's a young man who went outside
[1:27:26] and the young man told him he said now
[1:27:29] he said now i he said i need to be
[1:27:32] baptized i got to get baptized
[1:27:34] you want to be baptized right then he
[1:27:36] said why why do you need to be baptized
[1:27:38] he said i need i have to receive the
[1:27:39] holy ghost
[1:27:41] and he thought he had to be baptized
[1:27:42] before he could receive the holy ghost
[1:27:45] and we know that that's not true because
[1:27:46] the ones in cornelius house
[1:27:49] received the holy ghost and then got
[1:27:50] baptized
[1:27:52] right but he thought he had to be
[1:27:54] baptized he said i got to be baptized he
[1:27:56] said why don't you receive the holy
[1:27:57] ghost and then get baptized
[1:27:59] and it was just like a light bulb went
[1:28:01] off seeing the cartoons with a light
[1:28:03] bulb over a man's head
[1:28:04] light bulb went off on him and and he
[1:28:06] just fell right there
[1:28:07] and received the holy ghost what is that
[1:28:10] he just realized that god wanted to give
[1:28:12] it to him he had a part to
[1:28:14] play though he had to accept it
[1:28:19] are you with me tonight god can do those
[1:28:21] things for us he can he can
[1:28:23] change our lives he can make us where we
[1:28:25] are we're
[1:28:26] to the place where we need to be he can
[1:28:28] take an impossible situation
[1:28:30] make it something that that is a reality
[1:28:32] in our lives
[1:28:33] make the world a reality in our lives
[1:28:34] but we have to be willing to do whatever
[1:28:36] our part is
[1:28:39] we have to be willing to say god i know
[1:28:42] that you know what's best for me i'm not
[1:28:43] going to try to micromanage my situation
[1:28:46] i'm not going to try to keep myself in a
[1:28:48] in a box and
[1:28:49] make sure that i control everything i
[1:28:51] realize i can't control it lord but i
[1:28:54] know you can
[1:28:57] you say how does god want to do
[1:28:58] something for me i don't know how he
[1:29:00] wants to do it for you he may want to do
[1:29:01] it in a prayer line he may want to do it
[1:29:02] with
[1:29:03] your pastor laying on hands he may want
[1:29:04] to do it at home in your closet
[1:29:06] i don't know how what will i feel when i
[1:29:09] jump haul or scream i don't know
[1:29:10] you may just accept it and go on but he
[1:29:12] wants to do it
[1:29:15] you just got to figure out what your
[1:29:16] part is
[1:29:18] was to go up and be prayed for wait for
[1:29:21] the movie of the water whatever that is
[1:29:22] you have a part to play you see god
[1:29:25] could not push us through a little pipe
[1:29:26] pull us out on the other end
[1:29:28] he said and then say blessed is he that
[1:29:29] overcometh you had nothing to overcome
[1:29:32] he just pushed you through
[1:29:33] but you've got to make decisions for
[1:29:34] yourself i have to make decisions for
[1:29:36] myself in doing that we show our faith
[1:29:38] and respect to god
[1:29:41] now watch what happened with abraham and
[1:29:42] sarah it says sarah abraham
[1:29:45] abram's wife bury him no children and
[1:29:47] she had a handmaid an egyptian whose
[1:29:49] name
[1:29:49] was hagar and i watch
[1:29:53] she gets an idea she has the right
[1:29:56] problem identified but the wrong
[1:29:58] solution
[1:29:59] because it's somebody else
[1:30:02] right so the right problem we need
[1:30:05] something we
[1:30:06] need a child the word of god has to be
[1:30:08] fulfilled
[1:30:09] but the solution wasn't part of her she
[1:30:11] couldn't believe for herself
[1:30:12] so she said why not hagar but see
[1:30:15] she was the one married to abram bad
[1:30:20] you're the one married to christ not you
[1:30:22] can't let some other church do it
[1:30:24] some of the person do it let the pastor
[1:30:26] do it let the preacher know
[1:30:28] i'm married to christ the word this word
[1:30:31] has to be manifested in my life i have
[1:30:33] to come in agreement with the word
[1:30:35] i'm afraid to ask if you're with me but
[1:30:41] you're part of the solution
[1:30:45] very bad and you may not know what it is
[1:30:47] yet sarah didn't know you see god never
[1:30:49] told
[1:30:50] sarah he never told abraham anything
[1:30:52] about sarah until genesis 17
[1:30:54] 15 and he said unto abraham as for sarah
[1:30:56] thy wife
[1:30:57] this is after ishmael was born after
[1:31:01] he's born and she don't know
[1:31:02] what's going on she don't have a clue
[1:31:04] and sometimes god allows us to be like
[1:31:06] that
[1:31:07] we don't know but that's why we have to
[1:31:09] be willing to let him work
[1:31:13] we have to be willing to let god work
[1:31:15] god you put me in a box for a reason
[1:31:17] you put me in this situation you allow
[1:31:19] me to be here for a reason
[1:31:21] you must be going to do something
[1:31:22] supernatural in my life
[1:31:26] sarah's partner's revealed 20 and 6
[1:31:31] reveals our part of the first
[1:31:32] resurrection he said blessed and holy is
[1:31:33] he that hath part
[1:31:35] in the first resurrection part but the
[1:31:38] brain says that this way i may not
[1:31:39] forget i'm hurting to save time
[1:31:40] he said may not forget that you're a
[1:31:42] part in that resurrection
[1:31:44] the quickening power it doesn't say
[1:31:46] we'll be in you one day
[1:31:48] we'll be in you when you have a great
[1:31:49] revival someday and maybe like the youth
[1:31:51] meetings we had this weekend but youth
[1:31:53] meetings come and go
[1:31:54] but the quickening power is now in you
[1:31:58] amen it's all settled you're god's child
[1:32:02] amen amen
[1:32:06] does god ever change his mind about his
[1:32:07] word brother brenda said but i wanted to
[1:32:08] get that message to you
[1:32:10] that you are a part of this resurrection
[1:32:12] see don't worry about it no more
[1:32:14] just rejoice over it you're part of the
[1:32:16] solution
[1:32:17] don't worry about it just rejoice over
[1:32:19] there is nothing nowhere can separate
[1:32:21] you from it
[1:32:22] nothing eternally secured in the kingdom
[1:32:23] of god when god has stamped his seal
[1:32:26] upon you you're to the end of the
[1:32:27] destination
[1:32:30] amen amen you're to the end of the
[1:32:32] destination he said but i've grieved him
[1:32:34] but he said you're still sealed until
[1:32:36] the day of redemption
[1:32:39] amen so come back in agreement with him
[1:32:42] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:43] but the brother said then the bride body
[1:32:45] must follow the head
[1:32:46] for it is a part of his resurrection
[1:32:49] brother branham
[1:32:49] identifies it it's a marvelous if you go
[1:32:52] back and listen to the table the brandon
[1:32:53] identifies
[1:32:54] as a as a body that's in the dirt a body
[1:32:57] in the grave
[1:32:57] then the head is raised but he said the
[1:33:00] body must follow the head
[1:33:03] amen it is part of his resurrection and
[1:33:06] part of the mystery
[1:33:07] it's impossible for it not to go he said
[1:33:10] oh my it's part of god's mystery how god
[1:33:12] revealed himself here and raised it up
[1:33:14] by the word
[1:33:14] so he reveals his church and raising it
[1:33:16] up by the same word it's a part of his
[1:33:18] threefold
[1:33:19] mystery what was the third fold of that
[1:33:22] to take you back to the garden of eden
[1:33:23] again
[1:33:27] oh can you see the mystery of marriage
[1:33:29] can you see it it's not just
[1:33:31] showing a man and wife it's just an
[1:33:32] example here on the earth but it's
[1:33:34] showing
[1:33:34] that he wants to take us back to him he
[1:33:37] wants us to be in agreement with him
[1:33:39] so the bride body must follow the head
[1:33:42] he said
[1:33:43] the head the body must follow him to
[1:33:44] eden do we believe that tonight
[1:33:48] hey man i'm skipping through some of
[1:33:50] this but he said in a group like this
[1:33:53] he said but in a group like this it's
[1:33:56] the closest place to heaven
[1:33:58] that there is on the earth
[1:34:04] just let that sink in for a minute
[1:34:08] in a group like this and you see satan
[1:34:11] attack that
[1:34:12] he'll attack that every which way he can
[1:34:14] try to keep you out of the group
[1:34:16] you understand and i trust those of you
[1:34:18] that are watching tonight are part of
[1:34:20] that group
[1:34:20] you're grouping with us in spirit if not
[1:34:23] but there's something about being in the
[1:34:24] house of god
[1:34:26] it's the closest place to heaven that
[1:34:29] there is on earth
[1:34:31] now you may not be able to feel that or
[1:34:33] know that
[1:34:34] but that's not because he doesn't make
[1:34:37] it home for you
[1:34:38] it's not because he don't make you feel
[1:34:40] like a part
[1:34:43] are you with me the problem when it
[1:34:45] comes to this is
[1:34:46] always us it's
[1:34:49] always us because in a group like this
[1:34:51] it's the closest place to heaven that
[1:34:52] there is on earth
[1:34:54] and we ought to want to be in heaven on
[1:34:55] earth shouldn't we he said when we are
[1:34:57] here standing together this morning we
[1:34:59] are already dead
[1:35:00] that job's done over and we are buried
[1:35:02] that's right all buried and then not
[1:35:03] only that
[1:35:04] but we are risen again i may have
[1:35:07] problems but i'm in the closest place to
[1:35:09] heaven that there is on earth
[1:35:10] it may be wednesday night but i'm in the
[1:35:12] closest place to heaven that there is on
[1:35:14] earth
[1:35:16] amen i may have worked hard all day i
[1:35:18] might be weary in my body and tired but
[1:35:20] i'm in the closest
[1:35:21] place to heaven that there is for the
[1:35:22] bill on earth your body might be hurting
[1:35:24] tonight your mind might be hurting you
[1:35:26] might be upset
[1:35:27] but you're in the closest place to
[1:35:29] heaven that there is on earth why a
[1:35:30] vindicated prophet
[1:35:32] told you that amen
[1:35:35] you're in the closest place to heaven's
[1:35:36] dress on earth where do you get it from
[1:35:38] well the bible says
[1:35:39] you're seated in heavenly places in
[1:35:41] christ jesus
[1:35:43] amen hallelujah
[1:35:47] we're not apart by our own efforts of
[1:35:49] that group
[1:35:50] but because he chose us in him therefore
[1:35:52] we make an effort
[1:35:54] amen as i said i'm so happy you made an
[1:35:56] effort tonight to sit in heavenly places
[1:35:58] with christ
[1:36:00] we're raised and in christ in his
[1:36:02] resurrection we're part of it
[1:36:04] and now we're assembling together in
[1:36:06] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:36:08] do we realize what we're doing tonight
[1:36:10] church he said we're part of it
[1:36:12] we're in him by baptism see by one
[1:36:14] spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:36:16] and here we are now assembled the body
[1:36:19] of the lord jesus
[1:36:22] hallelujah amen
[1:36:27] and i put this one i wrote this one down
[1:36:30] so i would remember it because it's all
[1:36:31] my notes is what you're seeing tonight
[1:36:34] but sometimes you've got to be
[1:36:37] identified with the problem
[1:36:40] so you can be a part of the solution
[1:36:43] and that's hard brother brandon says i
[1:36:46] see adam and eve the first little
[1:36:48] sweethearts they're in the garden of
[1:36:50] eden
[1:36:51] i see adam back there when he put his
[1:36:52] arms around his little sweetheart to
[1:36:53] walk out with her
[1:36:54] for god had condemned them and he
[1:36:57] started out with his arms around his
[1:36:59] darling
[1:37:00] adam was not deceived he didn't have to
[1:37:01] walk out
[1:37:03] but he walked out because he loved his
[1:37:05] wife
[1:37:08] amen he walked out with both eyes
[1:37:11] wide open no matter if she had to go to
[1:37:15] torment
[1:37:16] he'd go with her
[1:37:20] hallelujah he loved you enough
[1:37:23] he would go to hell for you
[1:37:28] hallelujah very man
[1:37:32] you know how you get in that little
[1:37:33] conversation with your wife who's gonna
[1:37:35] go to the store
[1:37:37] you both settle down you realize you
[1:37:38] don't have any milk for the cereal in
[1:37:40] the morning or
[1:37:41] whatever it is that you fix and you
[1:37:43] realize you don't have it and so you're
[1:37:44] kind of in that little bit of a
[1:37:46] maybe some of you all reach that place
[1:37:47] where you know who's going
[1:37:50] but every once in a while we still kind
[1:37:52] of you know talk about that
[1:37:53] well i've already you know i make sure
[1:37:55] to take my shoes off i've already taken
[1:37:57] my shoes off you know i'm
[1:37:58] i'm ready for bed you know it's not too
[1:38:00] late do we really need that you know and
[1:38:02] there's this back and forth
[1:38:05] but you know there's something about
[1:38:06] real love that'll make you go be it
[1:38:09] somewhere out of love for your wife or
[1:38:12] your husband
[1:38:13] even when you don't want to but jesus
[1:38:16] didn't go to walmart
[1:38:19] he didn't go down to the 7-eleven or
[1:38:21] whatever store that we have around here
[1:38:23] casey's
[1:38:24] and get a pizza because his wife wanted
[1:38:26] one he went to hell
[1:38:30] hey man hallelujah
[1:38:33] he said if she so that she won't have to
[1:38:37] but he said i'm willing to follow her
[1:38:39] there
[1:38:40] hey man oh don't you don't you love a
[1:38:44] god like they can't you love a god like
[1:38:45] that
[1:38:46] wouldn't you want to serve a god who
[1:38:49] loved you like that
[1:38:51] he walked out with both eyes wide open
[1:38:54] she had to go to torment he would go too
[1:38:56] he said when god looked down and seen
[1:38:58] that love of a human being
[1:39:00] it was so great that he couldn't stand
[1:39:02] it himself
[1:39:04] he said that's right he said i'll come
[1:39:06] and go too
[1:39:09] amen that was his son
[1:39:14] hallelujah that was his son he was
[1:39:17] displaying the fleshly
[1:39:19] fallen attributes when he was blaming
[1:39:21] eve but when he walked out with her
[1:39:24] hey man when he didn't put her away
[1:39:28] what did what was that that was his son
[1:39:31] he said that's like me that's what i
[1:39:34] want to do
[1:39:36] i'll come and go too amen
[1:39:40] amen
[1:39:43] he said for he hath made him to be sin
[1:39:45] for us he made him to be sin
[1:39:48] that's a harsh statement it's a strong
[1:39:50] word because he knew no sin
[1:39:53] sin would be so ugly to him if you can
[1:39:55] imagine if you've ever been brother
[1:39:57] brown and talked about how you can reach
[1:39:58] a place in prayer
[1:39:59] and i think we ought to reach that place
[1:40:01] church how long has it been since you
[1:40:03] prayed through
[1:40:04] since you really got free in the spirit
[1:40:05] of god that you really reached that
[1:40:07] place
[1:40:08] where sin looks so terrible to you you
[1:40:11] wouldn't do that for nothing
[1:40:13] god help us to reach that place but
[1:40:16] but see he had made him to be sin for us
[1:40:18] who knew no sin he'd never been
[1:40:20] scarred by it never been never been
[1:40:24] hardened by it and took it all
[1:40:28] took the guilt of every sin on a
[1:40:31] completely innocent
[1:40:33] being no wonder the
[1:40:36] sweat dropped like blood out of his body
[1:40:40] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:40:43] of god
[1:40:45] in him he was willing to get his hands
[1:40:47] dirty sometimes in marriage
[1:40:49] you have to be willing to get your hands
[1:40:51] dirty
[1:40:53] to make it work you have to be
[1:40:56] identified with mud daubers
[1:40:58] as moses was sometimes to make a church
[1:41:02] work
[1:41:03] you've got to be identified with the
[1:41:05] church even if you don't agree with
[1:41:06] everything that goes on
[1:41:10] sometimes you've got to get down and
[1:41:11] dirty sometimes you've got to get right
[1:41:13] down
[1:41:13] whether where it works you got to get
[1:41:15] down and do what
[1:41:16] your part even if that part is not
[1:41:18] glamorous why
[1:41:20] because it's god's elect children you're
[1:41:22] not doing it for just
[1:41:24] anybody moses moses thought the reproach
[1:41:26] of christ
[1:41:27] greater riches than all the wealth of
[1:41:29] egypt
[1:41:31] willing to get his hands dirty that's
[1:41:33] the way jesus was let's bow our heads
[1:41:35] together
[1:41:38] i preached right at an hour it's long
[1:41:40] enough
[1:41:41] god knows what he's doing you believe
[1:41:43] that tonight
[1:41:48] somehow he wanted this sermon preached
[1:41:51] and i don't know why
[1:41:53] he wanted it done then i just asked you
[1:41:57] to examine your heart and your life and
[1:41:58] we'll brother alan come in a moment and
