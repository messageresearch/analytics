[31:54] He looked beyond your faults and saw
[31:56] your needs. I had planned on being gone
[31:59] this morning and and uh some things came
[32:01] up and we end up going to some meetings
[32:03] yesterday and then so we're going to
[32:05] we're still leaving today, but I just
[32:07] thought I'd be here with you guys and
[32:09] can't think of a better place to be in
[32:10] church and it's good to see each and
[32:12] every one of you. Jaden, good to see you
[32:13] in Bella this morning. It's always good
[32:15] to see you in the house of the Lord. We
[32:17] love to see these young families and
[32:19] each one of you here. God bless you. We
[32:21] love you so much and we're just
[32:23] believing that the Lord is is going to
[32:25] move this morning and speak to us
[32:27] through Brother Joel. I don't often give
[32:29] him a backto-back chance like this, but
[32:31] we're just believing the Lord will will
[32:33] speak to us. I I believe by the
[32:35] preaching of the word, things can be
[32:37] changed. You say, "Well, I don't need to
[32:38] be changed." So, I think all of us need
[32:41] a touch from the Lord this morning. We
[32:43] we do. Brother Brandon said we'll either
[32:45] go out better or worse than when we came
[32:47] in. That's a challenge to us. Let's go
[32:50] out better. Let's be better Christians,
[32:52] better fathers, better families, better
[32:54] better people, and and ready, more ready
[32:57] for the rapture. Amen. Do you love him
[32:59] this morning? Amen. Can we sing that? If
[33:01] not for grace. Not for grace. Brother
[33:04] Robert, if you could pull that up, where
[33:05] would I
[33:08] be? You only
[33:12] know. I'm glad you
[33:16] see through eyes of
[33:20] love. I was a hopeless case. Was that
[33:24] you? An empty
[33:28] place. If not for
[33:33] grace. Amazing grace.
[33:37] How sweet the
[33:40] sound. I once was
[33:44] lost. Oh, but now I'm
[33:48] found. I was a hopeless
[33:52] case, an empty
[33:56] place. If not for
[34:00] grace, where would I be? Aren't you
[34:03] glad? Oh, you only know. invite brother
[34:07] Joel to come this morning. I'm glad you
[34:11] see. Oh, through eyes of
[34:15] love. Oh, I was a hopeless
[34:20] case and empty
[34:23] place if not for
[34:27] grace. It was amazing
[34:31] grace. Oh, how sweet the sound. I'm so
[34:35] glad I once was
[34:39] lost. But
[34:42] [Music]
[34:47] now
[34:49] that
[34:51] place if not for
[34:55] grace. Oh, where would I be? You only
[34:58] know. You only
[35:02] know. I'm glad you
[35:05] [Music]
[35:06] see through eyes of love.
[35:13] Oh yes, I was an empty
[35:18] place if
[35:20] not for
[35:22] grace. Amen. Do you believe that this
[35:24] morning? I wonder as they're playing
[35:26] that if you would just bow your heads
[35:28] and if you have a need on your heart
[35:29] this morning if you would just make it
[35:31] known to the Lord by an uplifting hand.
[35:33] Heavenly Father, as we come once again,
[35:35] Lord, we Lord, this this stormy
[35:39] day, Lord, I pray that you would send
[35:41] your rain on the inside of this building
[35:43] here this morning. And Lord, I ask that
[35:45] you would just pour out your spirit upon
[35:48] every person sitting in this building.
[35:49] And I ask Lord for a special anointing
[35:52] to come by our way this morning. I pray
[35:55] Lord for every evil spirit or evil
[35:57] thought, anything that would hold us
[35:59] back from a move of God, I pray we'd
[36:00] just leave the building now. And Lord, I
[36:02] ask that Lord, you wouldn't let me say
[36:04] anything that would be unlike you. Bind
[36:07] my lips and let me say only what you
[36:09] would want me to say this morning. I
[36:11] pray for the people sitting here, Lord.
[36:12] I ask, Lord, you would just, Lord, open
[36:14] their hearts, Lord, to receive what you
[36:16] would have for them and move upon each
[36:18] one of us. Now we ask in Jesus name.
[36:22] Amen. Amen. How many's happy to be in
[36:25] church this morning? Amen. On a rainy
[36:28] Memorial Day weekend. Amen. It's good to
[36:30] see each and every one of you. Have your
[36:31] Bibles. Joshua chapter 1 and verse 4.
[36:34] Joshua 1 and verse 4.
[36:48] Amen. Joshua 1 and verse4 says, "From
[36:51] the wilderness and this Lebanon, even
[36:52] unto the great river, the river
[36:54] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[36:56] and unto the great sea towards the going
[36:58] down of the sun shall be your coast, and
[37:01] there shall not any man be able to stand
[37:05] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[37:07] I was with Moses, so I will be with
[37:10] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[37:13] thee. Be strong and of a good courage,
[37:15] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[37:18] for an inheritance the land which I
[37:20] swear under their fathers to give them.
[37:23] Only be thou strong and very courageous,
[37:26] that thou mayest observe to do according
[37:28] to all the law which Moses my servant
[37:30] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[37:33] right hand or to the left, that thou
[37:35] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[37:38] And you may be seated. May the Lord add
[37:40] his blessings to the reading of the word
[37:41] this morning. And if I could take a
[37:44] thought this morning, it would be from
[37:45] verse 7. Be strong and very courageous.
[37:50] And I think that's a call to the church
[37:52] in this age in a time when we are we're
[37:55] so uh you know, it's easy to lose focus
[37:58] of what we're trying to fight for. Uh
[38:00] and then we can turn our swords on one
[38:02] another and to fight one another. But in
[38:05] this time, we need to know what we're
[38:06] fighting for is not our brother. what
[38:08] we're fighting is not is not one
[38:10] another, but it is fighting uh it is
[38:12] fighting wickedness in high places and
[38:15] and spirits of deception and things that
[38:17] would come on us. And and so we want to
[38:19] be sure uh that that that we're not
[38:22] fighting the wrong thing. And so in our
[38:24] fight, we must be very strong and very
[38:27] courageous. Can you say amen? Amen. So
[38:30] we don't want to be cowards. God didn't
[38:31] call a coward for this message. He
[38:34] didn't call a group of people that would
[38:35] just, you know, just kind of gallivant
[38:37] through and and kind of take it or leave
[38:39] it. But no, he wants people who will be
[38:42] strong and courageous, amen, with into
[38:44] in the land that God has given us. And
[38:46] so he could trust Joshua, amen, with
[38:49] this message, with his message, because
[38:52] he knew that he would be a great
[38:53] warrior, amen, and stand for the truth
[38:55] that Moses had taught him. And so he
[38:58] would always refer back to what Moses
[38:59] had said. He would always refer back,
[39:01] amen, to what Moses and did. And so in
[39:04] Ephesians 6 and verse 10, it says it
[39:06] like this. Finally, my brethren, be
[39:08] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[39:11] his might. Put on the whole armor of God
[39:14] that you may be able to with to stand
[39:16] against the ws of the devil. And down in
[39:19] verse 14, he would say it like this.
[39:21] Stand therefore a and having your loins
[39:24] gird about with truth and having on the
[39:25] breastplate of righteousness and your
[39:27] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[39:29] gospel of peace above all taking the
[39:31] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[39:34] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[39:36] the wicked and take the helmet of
[39:38] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[39:40] and and and which is the word of God.
[39:42] And so brother Brandon would say it like
[39:44] this and and and he said look I'll give
[39:46] it to you the land's over there but
[39:48] before you get there you've got to
[39:50] fight. Can you say amen? Amen. That's
[39:52] what's the matter with the people today.
[39:54] They're afraid to stand and fight. What
[39:56] we need is I must fight if I should
[39:59] reign. Increase my courage. Amen. We
[40:01] need a courageous group of people here
[40:03] today. Because the land that you're
[40:04] going to take and possess is not going
[40:07] to be taken without a fight. Can the
[40:08] church say amen? And so what we need to
[40:11] do is realize, amen, that we are not on
[40:13] a picnic, but we are on a battlefield.
[40:16] Amen. And the greatest battle you'll
[40:17] ever fight is a battle in the mind. It
[40:19] is a battle, amen, that the Satan is
[40:22] always there and trying to get you to
[40:24] think wrong and and give up and and just
[40:26] sit down and wait a while because you
[40:28] know maybe maybe this land is not really
[40:30] the right land that God has given you.
[40:32] Maybe the land is maybe it's not
[40:34] attainable in this land. Amen. But when
[40:36] Moses said go over, Amen. And I like
[40:38] what God did. He actually takes Moses up
[40:40] on a mountain and gives him a preview of
[40:43] the land. And I love it in our day, if
[40:45] you want to type it right there, that a
[40:47] prophet could go over and actually look
[40:49] and see what was on the other side
[40:51] beyond the curtain of time. Amen. And
[40:54] could tell you, amen, be strong and very
[40:56] courageous because what's over there,
[40:59] Amen, is love and peace and perfection.
[41:01] And so what I would say this morning is
[41:03] a prophet has already went over and
[41:05] looked on your behalf so that you don't
[41:07] have to just take a word for it, but you
[41:09] could take a vindicated prophet's word
[41:11] that what he saw is real. and that's
[41:14] where we're going. But to get there,
[41:16] you've got to fight for every inch of
[41:18] crown that you're going to take. Can the
[41:20] church say amen? Amen. So, it's not just
[41:22] a it's not just a picnic. It's not an
[41:24] easy going. It's not easy to get there.
[41:26] Amen. But what we've got to do is fight
[41:28] for everything, then we've got Listen,
[41:30] listen. If you think the devil's going
[41:31] to lay down and just let you walk all
[41:32] over him, you got another thing coming
[41:34] because the devil's going to fight you.
[41:36] Every time you would try to do good,
[41:38] evil will be present. Every time you
[41:40] will try to take a step forward, the
[41:42] devil's going to be there to stop you.
[41:43] Every time you try to praise, the
[41:45] devil's going to try to hinder your
[41:46] praise. Every time you try to go to
[41:48] church, the devil don't want you going
[41:50] to church. Welcome the church. Say,
[41:51] "Amen." Amen. But what you've got to do
[41:53] is press through that and take a hold of
[41:56] the land that God has given you. Take a
[41:58] hold of the possessions that you have
[42:00] inherited as a believer. You say, "Well,
[42:03] when I become a son of God, you always
[42:05] were sons of God." Amen. You were
[42:07] always, listen, in the back part of
[42:09] God's mind, you always were a son of
[42:11] God, Brother Bill. Amen. You always
[42:12] were. It don't matter how low down you
[42:14] were, how backslid you were, how cold on
[42:17] God you were, you always were a son of
[42:19] God or a daughter of God. I'm here to
[42:21] tell you this morning, don't let the
[42:23] devil point out your mistakes. You're
[42:25] full of mistakes. But you are one of
[42:27] God's. And he will not leave you the way
[42:29] he found you. But he will change you and
[42:32] call you up a little higher into
[42:34] perfection. Listen church. If it wasn't
[42:36] for the blood of God, there wouldn't be
[42:38] one of you able to sit here this
[42:39] morning. Amen. But you've been given the
[42:41] ability to fight for your inheritance.
[42:44] You've been given the ability. Listen,
[42:46] this is not that you you were not called
[42:48] into this army, amen, to lose the
[42:50] battle. You were called because God saw
[42:53] that that you would be a soldier and you
[42:55] would be you would be brave and you
[42:57] would be courageous and and you would be
[42:59] true to the word of God. Listen, Caleb
[43:01] and Joshua were not called because they
[43:03] were cowards, but they were called
[43:05] because they were men, amen, that would
[43:07] really really fight for their
[43:08] inheritance. And and they would look
[43:10] over there and and they would look like
[43:12] grasshoppers compared to them people.
[43:13] Remember Moses sent over a bunch of men,
[43:15] amen, and they were all kinds of
[43:17] opinions they came back with. But when
[43:19] Joshua and Caleb went over, they said,
[43:21] "We are more than able to take the
[43:23] land." Because what? Listen church, it
[43:25] didn't look easy, but they knew they
[43:27] could fight for it because they had a
[43:29] promise of the land that was theirs. I
[43:32] want to tell you this afternoon, you may
[43:33] have all kinds of opinions. You may have
[43:35] all kinds of of ideas of what's over
[43:37] there in front of you. You may say, "I
[43:39] don't know how to face tomorrow." But I
[43:41] want to tell you, with him on your side,
[43:43] there is a God that goes before you in
[43:46] battle, and you have already won the
[43:48] victory. Can the church say, "Amen. You
[43:50] are not somebody that's going to lose,
[43:52] but you were called for a season that
[43:55] you're in. You were called to be an
[43:56] overcomer. Can you say amen? Amen.
[43:59] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[44:00] He He's talking about brother Buddy
[44:02] Robinson getting the Holy Ghost. He said
[44:04] he said, "Lord, if you don't give me the
[44:05] Holy Ghost, when you come back to earth,
[44:07] you're going to find a pile of bones
[44:08] laying here." And he said, "If we ever
[44:10] get that sincere, something's going to
[44:12] happen." And he said, "Lord, give me
[44:14] plenty of knowledge in the gable into my
[44:15] soul and let me fight the devil as long
[44:17] as I got a tooth in my mouth and then
[44:19] come him till I die." He said, "And
[44:21] that's what he did. God help me and help
[44:23] you to have courage and stand out
[44:26] there." And God said, "It's so others
[44:28] are getting it. Let us go get it. It's
[44:31] ours." God promised it to us. What do
[44:33] you say? But look here. What will my
[44:35] church say? What will my pastor say?
[44:36] What will this say? What will my mama
[44:38] say? What will this group in the message
[44:40] say? We're not looking to what others
[44:41] are saying. He said, "Give me this land
[44:44] and and it is your land if you'll take
[44:47] it by, listen, by fighting for it." They
[44:49] couldn't go over there and say, "Well,
[44:50] we're we're we're going to make a treaty
[44:52] with you and you can stay here and we'll
[44:54] stay here and we're going to live
[44:55] peaceful." No, that's not the way God
[44:56] operates. Amen. If it's your land, you
[44:59] take it and every devil's got to leave
[45:00] the land. Can you say amen? Amen. The
[45:03] devils are not welcome on your property
[45:05] when it's your land. When it's your
[45:07] land, it is yours and nobody else's.
[45:10] When God called you to be a son, he
[45:13] didn't say you're a son, but you, you
[45:14] know, you can't take this part of the
[45:16] promise, and you can't take this
[45:17] inheritance, and this is not yours.
[45:19] Listen, if you are a son, then you have
[45:22] a right to possess everything that the
[45:24] father owned. And you know, I was
[45:26] thinking about this, and I'm not a
[45:28] lawyer, so so I I don't know all the
[45:30] details of this, but I remember a
[45:31] situation, amen, where there was this
[45:32] this man that passed away, and he had
[45:34] just stepchildren. He had no real
[45:36] children, but they were stepchildren.
[45:38] and even stepchildren had a right to
[45:40] what he owned. And some of them didn't
[45:41] even know the man hardly. Amen. Because
[45:43] they were from a his first wife. And and
[45:45] so, but you know what they did? Half of
[45:47] the children that they were closer to
[45:49] him ended up getting it. And he left a
[45:51] he left a a will and for the kids to
[45:54] these these kids were going to get
[45:55] everything. But the other kids had a
[45:57] right to it. And so they went to probate
[45:59] and actually won and got half of
[46:01] everything. But I want to tell you
[46:03] something. We're not going to fight in
[46:04] the courts of the land. Amen. But you
[46:06] were given all of these promises. You
[46:09] were given everything before the
[46:11] foundation of the world. And I remember
[46:13] an attorney making a statement. He said,
[46:15] "You had to have an irrevocable trust in
[46:17] order to not lose that half." And I got
[46:20] to thinking, "Amen. God doesn't just
[46:21] will something to you and will something
[46:23] to you." Amen. But it was already yours
[46:25] before the foundation of the world.
[46:26] Amen. Your name was already on. And it
[46:29] wasn't something you had to inherit
[46:30] later on down the line, but it always
[46:32] was yours. If you ever get the Holy
[46:34] Ghost, you always had the Holy Ghost
[46:36] potentially inside of you. Come on,
[46:39] church. We we've we've made it too hard
[46:41] to attain because we think it's coming
[46:43] or it's something we got to go get. But
[46:45] what it is, it's something that's
[46:46] already here for you if you'll just get
[46:48] a hold of it and take it as yours. I I
[46:51] think what we've done, we've we've put
[46:52] the Holy Ghost out here so far, our
[46:54] young people don't know how to get it.
[46:55] Amen. We've put a we put worship out
[46:57] here where we think we have to worship a
[46:59] certain way in order to really worship
[47:01] God. Amen. But I would say go ahead and
[47:03] just worship in the way that God has
[47:05] called you to worship. I would say it
[47:07] like this. If God has given you the Holy
[47:09] Ghost, it don't matter how you acted
[47:10] when you got it, but say, "Yes, I've got
[47:12] the Holy Ghost." And when you get hold
[47:14] on God, don't start doubting your
[47:16] experience, but come back to the well of
[47:18] grace. Amen. For another dip of the Holy
[47:20] Ghost. I would say this morning, there
[47:22] may be many sitting here that's got the
[47:24] Holy Ghost, but what you need is a
[47:25] refilling of the Holy Ghost this
[47:27] morning. And real believers are going to
[47:29] fight because they're not going to be
[47:31] satisfied in a cold or a dead condition.
[47:34] Amen. But they're going to fight, amen,
[47:36] for a renewing of their minds and a
[47:38] renewing of their soul. I would say this
[47:40] morning, what we need is fighters to
[47:42] say, "I'm not going to fight one
[47:44] another. I'm not going to fight my
[47:45] brother. I'm not going to fight against
[47:47] the people in the church. No, I love
[47:49] them. But I'm going to fight the devil
[47:51] that is trying to bring discord. I'm
[47:53] going to fight the devil that's trying
[47:54] to kill my joy. I'm going to fight the
[47:57] devil that's trying to steal my praise.
[47:59] I'm going to fight the devil with
[48:01] everything that I've got. Can the church
[48:03] say amen? But we got to have some
[48:05] fighters. You can't be a coward in the
[48:07] service of the Lord, but you've got to
[48:09] be a bold and and a courageous soldier.
[48:12] Can you say amen? Brother Brandon would
[48:14] say it like this. You're you baby and
[48:15] around with a whole lot of things
[48:16] you ought to be
[48:18] destroying. Let the church say amen.
[48:20] Amen. You you you you just start s you
[48:22] say, "Well, this thing's hurting my
[48:23] experience with God." then destroy that
[48:25] thing and don't let anything hinder you
[48:28] in your walk with God. You say, "Well,
[48:30] it's important to me. It ain't important
[48:32] enough to keep you out of the kingdom of
[48:33] God if you're really a a child of God."
[48:36] Amen. You say, "Well, this here, it's
[48:38] just a little, you know, the Bible calls
[48:39] it little foxes that spoil the vines."
[48:41] Amen. things that come upon you and you
[48:44] don't really recognize it's an evil. But
[48:46] what it does, it takes you it takes you
[48:48] so far and you say, "Well, I can still
[48:49] be a Christian and live here and and you
[48:51] can live over here on the edge of the
[48:53] land and and you say, "I can still see
[48:55] the land and and I can still be blessed
[48:57] on this side." Listen, but God doesn't
[48:59] want you in that position. God wants you
[49:01] to go over and take the land because you
[49:04] were not meant to be on the other side.
[49:06] You were meant to go over and possess
[49:08] all the promises of God. Can you say
[49:11] amen? Amen. It wasn't good enough to for
[49:13] you to stay in the Wesleyan age. It
[49:15] wasn't good enough for you to accept
[49:17] Baptist theology. Amen. But God wanted
[49:19] somebody who would actually get on fire
[49:21] with the message of the hour and go
[49:23] forward and say, "I'm not backing up.
[49:25] I'm not turning around. I'm not giving
[49:27] up, but I will attain the promise of
[49:29] God." Can you say amen? Because God
[49:32] wants soldiers that will not stop. They
[49:34] will not quit. They will not retreat.
[49:36] Amen. There is no retreat in the army of
[49:38] God. Amen. But we are going forward and
[49:40] we are going to take our land. Can the
[49:43] church say amen? Brother Brandon was
[49:45] talking here and he was referring back
[49:46] to Paul and Paul was speaking and
[49:48] talking about preparing a soldier for
[49:49] battle and he said the gospel has many
[49:51] leans. You can liken it to one thing or
[49:53] another and Paul speaks as it of it as a
[49:56] runner in Hebrews the 12th chapter.
[49:58] Seeing that we are compassed about with
[50:00] such a great cloud of witnesses. Let us
[50:02] lay aside every weight. Somebody say
[50:04] every weight.
[50:06] and and let us lay aside every sin that
[50:08] easily besets us. He's speaking there of
[50:11] the Olympics, he said, or perhaps the
[50:12] Roman circus. And so now he's speaking
[50:14] of armored men going into battle and how
[50:17] he's got to prepare himself. Amen. So if
[50:20] there is a sin or if there is a weight,
[50:22] then you need to lay that thing aside so
[50:25] that you can actually reach the goal
[50:27] that you are going after. Can the church
[50:29] say amen? Brother Brandon would go on
[50:30] like this. He said, "Notice all great
[50:32] people." I better start my timer. Notice
[50:34] all great people, great men, and every
[50:36] individual has a time. Amen. Where there
[50:38] is a decision time. Can the church say
[50:40] amen? Amen. There is a time of decision
[50:42] where you've either got to give up or
[50:44] you've got to start fighting again.
[50:47] There's a decision time for every
[50:48] believer in this church. You are going
[50:50] to get to a point where is it okay to be
[50:52] cold on God or do I need to start
[50:54] fighting for what is mine? Amen. Do I
[50:56] need to fight, Amen, for everything that
[50:58] God has given me? Listen. Listen. It's
[51:00] easy to give up. Amen. But then you'll
[51:02] never reach your goal. It's easy to stop
[51:05] short of the goal. Amen. Because you
[51:07] It's just easier. Everything's easier
[51:09] when you don't fight. Everything's
[51:10] easier when you don't pursue. But what
[51:12] we need to do is remember that what's at
[51:15] the end of the road is worth every
[51:17] fight. It is worth every trial. It is
[51:19] worth every heartache. It is worth every
[51:21] battle. Listen, church, every fear that
[51:23] has come upon you to stop you. Cast that
[51:26] thing aside and go ahead and reach for
[51:29] the goal and run with patience. the race
[51:32] that is set before you. Brother Brandon
[51:34] would go on he said there he said
[51:35] there's a time of decision. You've got
[51:37] to say yes or no. He said that may be
[51:39] many in here tonight you got to say I
[51:41] will take Christ for my healer or I
[51:43] won't. See he said think of it now. The
[51:45] time of the promise drew nigh and God
[51:47] called Moses by a pillar of fire in the
[51:49] burning bush. I want you to think about
[51:51] it for a moment. The same God that was
[51:53] able to go with Joshua and Caleb over
[51:56] was the same God that had met Moses in
[51:58] the burning bush. And the same God that
[52:00] met Moses in the burning bush was the
[52:02] same God that anointed him for a purpose
[52:05] in Egypt and to could call could call
[52:07] all the plagues and things down. And he
[52:09] actually gave him two signs. Can you
[52:11] remember that? He gave him two signs.
[52:13] There was a sign in the hand and and and
[52:14] and he would go on and and listen, you
[52:17] you you'll see the way God always works.
[52:20] And and you'll see why that Joshua and
[52:21] Caleb could be so bold in their journey
[52:24] by seeing that it wasn't them doing it
[52:26] on their set on their own, but it was
[52:28] actually God had showed them a way
[52:31] forward. Amen. By a pillar of fire. Are
[52:33] you still with me? And so he would
[52:34] actually anoint Moses and Moses would go
[52:37] into Egypt and deliver them. And then
[52:39] there would be the first test would be
[52:40] at the Red Sea. Amen. where Pharaoh's
[52:42] army was closing in and and they started
[52:44] to get scared and then Moses stealed the
[52:47] people and and and he and he called for
[52:49] God to separate the waters and they went
[52:51] over on dry ground. Listen, if you'd
[52:54] seen that, wouldn't that be enough for
[52:55] you to believe that we can also take the
[52:57] land? But it wasn't enough because they
[52:59] would they would go through that and
[53:00] they would forget what God had done for
[53:02] them. And they get over on the other
[53:04] side. And I love how after their first
[53:05] victory, amen, they shouted and they
[53:07] danced and Miriam beat the tambourine.
[53:10] And right after a great victory is a
[53:11] good time to go ahead and praise God for
[53:14] what he's done for you. But what they
[53:15] did, they forgot what God had done. And
[53:18] they started to murmur and they started
[53:20] to complain and they and they actually
[53:21] would start dying off in the wilderness
[53:23] and they would start following after
[53:25] other prophets and other voices. And yet
[53:27] the whole time there was a pillar of
[53:28] fire ahead of them. Amen. There was
[53:30] water from a rock and there was mana
[53:32] from heaven. But what they did, they
[53:34] they they began to look back and say,
[53:36] "We ought to go back to Egypt or maybe
[53:38] we ought to give up." Come on, church.
[53:40] Amen. But there was two among them named
[53:42] Joshua and Caleb that the whole time
[53:44] they might have been getting older. They
[53:45] might have been getting weaker, but
[53:47] their faith in God was growing stronger
[53:49] by the day. And so they were in the
[53:51] desert for 40 years. And and they just
[53:53] wander in circles and around and around
[53:55] and and you wonder why are they staying
[53:56] out there? But God provided every step
[53:58] of the way. And then when they get down
[54:00] there, Moses had interceded for the
[54:02] people. And Moses had actually not was
[54:05] told he was not able to go to the
[54:07] promised land, but God would lift him up
[54:09] on a mountain and let him look over and
[54:10] see the land of promise that the people
[54:12] were going to to inhabit. And so then
[54:15] you would see there, amen, that that the
[54:17] people would go over. Moses would send
[54:19] men over and the men would go over there
[54:21] and they would come back with different
[54:22] reports and well there's giants in the
[54:24] land and we look like grasshoppers next
[54:26] to the giants and and they just wasn't
[54:28] able to do it. Amen. But two of the men
[54:30] that went over. I want you to notice
[54:32] that Joshua himself, he didn't send a
[54:34] man over, but he actually went himself.
[54:37] And so when Joshua goes over, he doesn't
[54:40] say, "Well, I'm going to just go send
[54:41] somebody." But he goes over and he sees
[54:43] the land. And in the land there, yes, he
[54:46] sees the w cities. Yes, he sees the
[54:48] giants. Yes, he sees the circumstances.
[54:50] But what he also knows is as I was with
[54:53] Moses, so will I be with you. And I want
[54:56] to tell the message people sitting here
[54:58] this morning, as he was with William
[55:00] Brandham, so is he with you this
[55:02] morning. We are not looking for another
[55:04] prophet to raise up. We are not looking
[55:06] for another thing to happen. Amen. But
[55:08] we've already seen the vindication.
[55:10] We've already seen what God can do. And
[55:12] God is still the same God, amen, that
[55:15] parted the Red Sea. He's still the same
[55:17] God that would bound the bound the lions
[55:20] in the lion's den for Daniel. He's still
[55:22] the same God that would walk in the fire
[55:24] with the three Hebrew children. He's the
[55:26] same God that would stand on the
[55:27] platform and the prophet would say,
[55:29] "Amen. I It's not me, but it's him
[55:32] standing here." And my ministry is not
[55:34] to declare me, but it's that he is here.
[55:37] And if he is here, all things are
[55:39] possible to the believer. Can the church
[55:42] say amen? Amen. We don't need to be
[55:44] afraid because the same God that was is
[55:47] not an I will be, but it is a God that
[55:49] is a present tense God and he is still
[55:52] among us. Can the church say amen? You
[55:54] know what you've done? You've gotten
[55:56] scared of who you are and you don't see
[55:58] the promise anymore because you've been
[56:00] in the desert too long, but it's time
[56:02] you recognize that the water that's
[56:04] coming from the rock is Christ himself.
[56:06] He said, "I will be a rock in a weary
[56:08] land." Amen. He was more than just a It
[56:11] was more than just Moses creating water
[56:13] and a river to run through. But it was
[56:15] actually where there was no water, there
[56:17] was water coming. Come on, church. Where
[56:20] there was no blessings, the blessings
[56:22] came. Where there was no joy, the joy
[56:24] can be restored. Where there was no
[56:26] peace, peace has come back in the home.
[56:28] Where there was nothing, God made
[56:31] something out of that thing. Can you say
[56:33] amen? What you've done is you've let the
[56:35] devil you've let the devil hinder your
[56:37] faith long enough, but go ahead and look
[56:38] back. We are not following just another
[56:40] prophet, but a vindicated prophet. We
[56:43] are not following just another man. But
[56:45] it was a man that came with a sign just
[56:48] like Moses. And as I was with Moses, so
[56:51] will I be with you. And as I Oh, come
[56:53] on, church. If you're that Joshua
[56:55] generation, listen, he didn't go over
[56:57] without authority, but he had the
[56:59] authority from the vindicated prophet.
[57:02] And so will you have in this day
[57:04] authority from a vindicated prophet. Can
[57:07] you say amen? So, while we go on down
[57:10] here, brother Brandham said, he said,
[57:12] "Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[57:13] keep thee in the way, and to bring thee
[57:15] into the place which has been prepared,
[57:17] which he's given to them. Beware of him.
[57:19] Provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[57:21] your transgression, for my name is in
[57:23] him. But if thou will indeed obey his
[57:26] voice, and do all that I speak."
[57:30] I want you to notice how important it is
[57:31] to actually listen and do what a prophet
[57:33] said. and do all that I speak, then I
[57:36] will be an adversary to thy adversaries.
[57:40] Can you say amen?
[57:43] He said, I'm going to send him now and
[57:44] I've give you already. Here it is. He
[57:46] said, I've given you Palestine. It's
[57:48] yours. It's all fenced in with all the
[57:50] Hivites, Jebusites, Perizzites,
[57:51] Amorites. It's all fenced in. But I give
[57:54] it to you. It's yours. He said, now
[57:56] let's break that down for just a moment.
[57:58] He said the land belonged to him. Now,
[58:00] God didn't say, "I'm going to go in
[58:02] there, empty up the land, and then put
[58:04] you in it." He said, "I've given it to
[58:06] you. Now, you go fight it out with
[58:07] them." Come on, church. I've give you
[58:10] the Holy Ghost, but you're not going to
[58:12] get it by just sitting there and not
[58:13] ever pursuing the Holy Ghost. You've
[58:16] actually got to go after the Holy Ghost.
[58:18] It was given to you, but you have got to
[58:20] take a hold of it and accept the Holy
[58:23] Ghost, and it's been given to you. Can
[58:25] the church say, "Amen." Amen. You know
[58:27] what we've done? We've we've made it too
[58:29] hard. But we we need to realize that God
[58:30] has given it to us and he went before
[58:32] you in battle now. You're going to
[58:34] fight, but remember who's with you in
[58:36] fighting. Amen. You're not fighting by
[58:39] yourself. You're not going into you're
[58:41] not going into a battle and just
[58:43] wondering who's going to win. I was
[58:44] reading the other day, and I don't read
[58:46] a lot, but I was reading a a book about
[58:49] uh about the Gettysburg, you know,
[58:51] battle, the battle of Gettysburg there.
[58:54] And I was reading that and and you know
[58:56] they went in and you you you think one
[58:58] general's going to out you know outduel
[59:00] the other one and and it was a
[59:01] children's book with pictures. But I
[59:02] read the pictures and so and so I you
[59:06] ain't going to find me with a book that
[59:07] thick unless it's the Bible. But but
[59:10] they I just don't have time for that.
[59:13] But they I I was reading this book, one
[59:16] of my kids book. Anyway, I was reading
[59:18] that book and I got to thinking, you
[59:20] know, they go in and they sacrifice
[59:22] their life for what they believed in.
[59:25] Both sides, men were just dying and and
[59:28] they finally they confront, you know,
[59:29] head-to-head. And I hope this book was
[59:31] correct, but they they finally come into
[59:33] to a head-to-head combat where I mean,
[59:35] they're they're it's manto man and
[59:36] they're kill they're dying and yet they
[59:38] didn't give up until they look back and
[59:40] realize that that that that there was
[59:43] one that had to retreat. But you
[59:45] remember that they were dying for the
[59:47] was because they were led in to a battle
[59:49] by men who really didn't even know what
[59:51] they were doing. They really didn't know
[59:53] who was going to win. You know, it was
[59:54] all the way up until the battle. They're
[59:56] still wondering who could win this
[59:57] battle. Amen. But but but think about
[59:59] it. When you're going into battle, you
[1:00:01] already know the outcome of the battle.
[1:00:04] And you can't lose.
[1:00:08] They could look and they could see a
[1:00:09] general over here and a general over
[1:00:10] there. And and every one of them had to
[1:00:12] change their their their strategies and
[1:00:14] things to try to win this war. Come on,
[1:00:16] church. And I know it's Memorial Day and
[1:00:18] and you know, we we we set aside a day
[1:00:20] and what we do is we have fun or eat,
[1:00:22] but but you know, we're we're thinking
[1:00:23] sometimes you got to think back to what
[1:00:25] men had to to to sacrifice and and to
[1:00:28] fight for just so you could be an
[1:00:30] American just so you could have this
[1:00:33] this freedoms that we have. Amen. As bad
[1:00:35] as it could be, it's still the best
[1:00:37] country in the world. Amen. You go
[1:00:38] overseas one time and you come back and
[1:00:40] you realize, hey, I'm glad to be in
[1:00:42] America. We got back from Egypt and I
[1:00:44] remember we went and found a hamburger
[1:00:45] because you don't have those over there.
[1:00:46] And hey, man, that's America, you know,
[1:00:48] and we can eat like that. You can eat
[1:00:50] until you till you're obese, you know,
[1:00:52] over here. And and and and things are
[1:00:53] just, you know, you get used to it. And
[1:00:55] you realize our worst roads better. Our
[1:00:59] worst roads better than anything they
[1:01:00] got over there as far as their side
[1:01:02] streets and their dirt roads. And
[1:01:03] listen, church, we're blessed as
[1:01:04] Americans, but somebody had to die for
[1:01:07] your freedom.
[1:01:08] Come on. Somebody had to give everything
[1:01:11] for you to be here this morning.
[1:01:13] Somebody had to give everything so that
[1:01:15] we could actually have a church to
[1:01:16] worship in. Somebody had to give
[1:01:18] everything for your freedom. And I want
[1:01:21] to tell you that somebody gave
[1:01:22] everything for your freedom so that you
[1:01:25] don't have to wonder who's going to win
[1:01:26] the battle. But he's already won that
[1:01:28] for you. When he went to Calvary, he
[1:01:31] didn't say, "Now you might have to come
[1:01:32] to Calvary as well." I wish somebody'
[1:01:34] hear me this morning. But he went over
[1:01:36] there and paid for every every mistake
[1:01:38] you would make and every sin and
[1:01:40] everything. He already paid for it. And
[1:01:42] if you would just look to Calvary, I
[1:01:44] know I said this Wednesday night, but if
[1:01:45] you would ever get a good view of
[1:01:47] Calvary, then it would change the way
[1:01:49] you look at things. It would change the
[1:01:51] way you act in church. It would change
[1:01:53] the way you worship. It would change the
[1:01:55] way you are. Why? Because once you look
[1:01:57] to Calvary, you realize that the
[1:01:59] ultimate battle had already been won.
[1:02:01] Amen. You think about it. He's there on
[1:02:02] the cross and he looks down and he look
[1:02:05] he looks down at the people and he said,
[1:02:06] "Father, forgive them because they don't
[1:02:09] even know what they're doing." Listen,
[1:02:10] that's a forgiving spirit. Amen. That
[1:02:12] many of us need to work on because a lot
[1:02:14] of times when we find ourselves, you
[1:02:16] know, somebody does me wrong, we just
[1:02:18] want to rile back at him. But when he
[1:02:20] but but he was so in love with the
[1:02:22] people and and he knew that the end
[1:02:24] result was that if he went to Calvary,
[1:02:26] Amen, they might be saved. And so when
[1:02:29] he asked for forgiveness, listen, he was
[1:02:31] interceding to the father, amen, for
[1:02:33] forgiveness. But I don't believe he was
[1:02:34] just doing it for them, but I believe he
[1:02:36] was looking ahead in time and looking at
[1:02:38] your sins. And he was looking at my
[1:02:40] sins. And he was looking ahead and say,
[1:02:42] "Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:02:44] what they've done. They don't know what
[1:02:46] they they don't they really don't.
[1:02:47] They're under a spirit that has caused
[1:02:49] them to do those things." But God wants
[1:02:51] you to fight through that thing. And
[1:02:53] realize he already won the war for you.
[1:02:56] But you've got to fight the battles that
[1:02:58] are coming your way. Amen. When the mind
[1:03:00] battles come, fight the mind battles.
[1:03:02] Amen. But you know that you've already
[1:03:04] won because where your the spirit of the
[1:03:06] Lord is, there is liberty from those
[1:03:09] things. And so if the spirit of the Lord
[1:03:10] has come upon you, amen, you're just
[1:03:12] like Samson. Amen. No gates can keep you
[1:03:15] out of the city. Amen. There there's no
[1:03:17] army that can come against you. Amen.
[1:03:19] But when you you have a strength that is
[1:03:21] unknown to the world, but it's a secret
[1:03:23] power and it's called the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:26] Welcome the church. Say amen. And if you
[1:03:28] have that secret power, it will rise up
[1:03:30] in you and it will actually fight every
[1:03:32] battle that comes. Amen. Suicidal demons
[1:03:35] that come upon you. Amen. You have you
[1:03:37] have the spirit of the Lord in you that
[1:03:39] will fight that demon. Amen. Every kind
[1:03:41] of oppression that will come upon you.
[1:03:43] Every kind of depression, every kind of
[1:03:45] think about it. Everything that you
[1:03:47] could b fight in life, every every
[1:03:48] anxiety. And listen, I know we live in
[1:03:51] an anxious world. I know we live in a
[1:03:53] world where there's so much depression
[1:03:54] and and there's so much fear. Amen. But
[1:03:56] God has given you the ability to
[1:03:59] overcome that by fighting with
[1:04:02] everything you have. Can the church say
[1:04:03] amen? We have We have the right to
[1:04:06] fight. We have a right to fight. I hope
[1:04:09] you're okay with this this morning. I'm
[1:04:10] not talking about fighting each other or
[1:04:12] fighting for something, but I'm talking
[1:04:13] about fighting the devil who is your
[1:04:16] enemy. We need to fight him with
[1:04:18] everything that we've got.
[1:04:20] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:04:21] He said, "I give you healing. It's your
[1:04:23] possession." Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:04:25] Somebody this morning sitting there sick
[1:04:26] and you say, "Well, I just wish I could
[1:04:28] overcome." We've got testimonies of what
[1:04:30] God can do sitting in this building.
[1:04:32] Amen. You could look at Sister Bennia.
[1:04:33] You heard her testimony a few weeks ago
[1:04:35] where there was no baby supposed to be
[1:04:37] born. She was able to have a baby. Amen.
[1:04:40] Where where hair would be falling out.
[1:04:41] Amen. You you would get prayed for
[1:04:43] laying hands on the sick just like the
[1:04:45] Bible prescribed. And the hair would
[1:04:47] come back. Come on, church. Do you
[1:04:49] realize what we serve is not a dead God,
[1:04:51] but it is a living God who is going
[1:04:53] before you in battle? I want you to know
[1:04:57] this morning that if you've given up on
[1:04:58] God and that then you can get right back
[1:05:00] up and keep going because he's a God of
[1:05:02] second chances. He's a God of third
[1:05:04] chances. If you failed God, don't think
[1:05:06] you fa fallen too far that God can't
[1:05:09] reach you. Because when he reached down
[1:05:10] for some of you, you were a long ways
[1:05:13] from grace. But God reached down his
[1:05:15] mighty hand and he said, "Brother
[1:05:17] Jaden," he said, "I'm coming after you."
[1:05:19] And then, "Brother Jeff, in your
[1:05:20] situation, God came after you. I don't
[1:05:23] care how cold you've been on God. I
[1:05:25] don't care where you find yourself this
[1:05:26] morning. God wants you to fight to come
[1:05:29] back into fellowship with him." Can the
[1:05:31] church say, "Amen." Amen. What we need
[1:05:34] this morning is to realize, Amen. We're
[1:05:35] not fighting a losing battle. You say,
[1:05:37] "I've fought this depression for years."
[1:05:39] Then keep fighting it. You I fight I've
[1:05:41] been fighting this depression for years.
[1:05:43] I've been fighting this anxiety. I've
[1:05:44] been fighting this demon of of trying to
[1:05:46] take my life and and suicide. Then keep
[1:05:49] fighting that devil because there is
[1:05:51] victory for you because God has called
[1:05:54] you to be victorious. Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] Thank you, Lord. God has called you to
[1:05:58] be victorious. God has called you to be
[1:06:00] an overcomer. Do you believe that this
[1:06:03] morning? Did you know God didn't call
[1:06:05] you to lose a battle? Did you know God
[1:06:07] didn't didn't call you to be sick? It
[1:06:11] was not his will for you to be sick, but
[1:06:13] God wants you to be healed, Sister
[1:06:14] Alice. He wants it more than you want
[1:06:16] it. God wants what? God wants it for you
[1:06:19] more than you've wanted. But all you've
[1:06:20] got to do is say, "Lord, I'm giving
[1:06:22] everything to you. I'm giving this
[1:06:24] temper over to you. I'm giving this
[1:06:26] backsliding condition to you. I'm giving
[1:06:28] everything that I am because I want to
[1:06:30] be an overcomer. And I know that when
[1:06:33] you give it to God and you let the chief
[1:06:35] captain go before you, then every one of
[1:06:37] them demons that's fighting you this
[1:06:39] morning has got to give way, amen, for
[1:06:42] the for the presence of God to take
[1:06:44] control of your life. I I tell you what
[1:06:46] we've done this morning is we've tried
[1:06:48] to do it on our own too often. We've
[1:06:50] tried to we've tried to fight these
[1:06:51] battles so much, amen, that we've tried
[1:06:53] to say, well well, you know, I'd like to
[1:06:55] I'm going to fight this depression. I'm
[1:06:57] going to do it. I'm going to keep
[1:06:58] fighting. I'm going to fight this demon
[1:07:00] that's on me. I'm going to fight this
[1:07:01] this cold and and this spirit that's
[1:07:04] trying to take me out of church. I tell
[1:07:05] you what, the moment you I'm tired of
[1:07:07] fighting, Lord. I just can't do it no
[1:07:09] more. The problem is you've been
[1:07:10] fighting too long and you need to give
[1:07:12] it to Jesus.
[1:07:15] There you go. You said, "Brother Joel, I
[1:07:16] thought you said we got to fight." You
[1:07:18] do have to fight, but you can't fight by
[1:07:19] yourself.
[1:07:21] You can't fight on your own because if
[1:07:23] you go into battle with no plans and
[1:07:24] you've not been equipped and you've not
[1:07:26] been given a an actual a tactic and and
[1:07:30] a strategic layout of how you've got to
[1:07:32] go to this battle, then you're sure as
[1:07:34] the world you're going to get outsmarted
[1:07:35] by somebody. I want to tell you who your
[1:07:37] enemy is and who your adversary is.
[1:07:40] Amen. He's known as the devil. But do
[1:07:42] you realize the devil does not even have
[1:07:44] the keys to his own house?
[1:07:46] Do you realize that the devil cannot
[1:07:48] cannot make you sick?
[1:07:50] He can't. He cannot He cannot make you
[1:07:52] sick. God had to allow that. God had to
[1:07:55] allow that that doctor to come and tell
[1:07:56] Sister Melennia what he told her so that
[1:07:58] she could have a testimony here this
[1:08:00] morning. Come on, church. Do you realize
[1:08:02] you you say, "Well, well, the devil's
[1:08:04] got all he's all over me." The devil has
[1:08:06] no right to your land. The devil has no
[1:08:08] right to your inheritance. But what
[1:08:10] you've done, listen, I know the devil
[1:08:12] can put sicknesses on you just like he
[1:08:14] did Job. But God knew he couldn't take
[1:08:16] his life. See, because somebody had
[1:08:19] already rigged the outcome of that
[1:08:21] story. Somebody had already said,
[1:08:23] "Brother Bill, the devil may fight you
[1:08:24] for 86, 87, 88 years." Amen. But at the
[1:08:27] end of all this, you win anyway. Come
[1:08:30] on, church. You win anyway. Because the
[1:08:33] devil can fight you, but he does not own
[1:08:35] you. He cannot take you out. He cannot
[1:08:38] defeat you because you are victorious.
[1:08:40] Somebody say, "I'm victorious." I'm
[1:08:42] victorious. We are victorious. Amen. And
[1:08:45] what are we victorious through? Through
[1:08:47] the blood of Jesus Christ. Thank you,
[1:08:50] Lord. Brother Random would go on like
[1:08:51] this. He said, "This is not a picnic
[1:08:52] ground. This is a battlefield. Not a
[1:08:54] place where we lay back and say, "Now,
[1:08:55] Lord, you just come, you know, force it
[1:08:57] to me and then I'll do it." No. No, you
[1:09:00] don't do it that way. God never did it
[1:09:02] that way. Come on. Can I have a few more
[1:09:05] minutes? He said, "He has a basis." He
[1:09:09] said, "Like I spoke last night, like the
[1:09:10] law of
[1:09:12] electricity, the law of water, the law
[1:09:14] of gravitation, everything, you have to
[1:09:16] work accordingly." He said, "There's the
[1:09:18] land." And yet some of the Israelites
[1:09:20] when they looked at it, they said, "Why?
[1:09:22] We can't take it. We We look like
[1:09:24] grasshoppers upside them big people."
[1:09:26] When the spies came back, but there was
[1:09:28] Joshua and Caleb. Somebody identifies
[1:09:31] with that group here this morning. He
[1:09:32] said, "There was Joshua and Caleb. They
[1:09:34] knew what God had said, and they said,
[1:09:37] "We can take it. It's ours. Somebody
[1:09:39] needs to go ahead and say, "It's mine
[1:09:41] this morning." You know why? Because God
[1:09:43] has already given you your healing. You
[1:09:45] need to accept your healing. Amen. God
[1:09:47] has already given you the Holy Ghost. If
[1:09:49] you're wanting it, God has already given
[1:09:51] it to you. Amen. But what you got to do,
[1:09:53] there is a prescription just like he
[1:09:55] said about the law of electricity and
[1:09:56] the law of water. Amen. There's a
[1:09:58] prescription on how to receive the Holy
[1:09:59] Ghost. And some of these young people, I
[1:10:01] know they've been baptized and some of
[1:10:03] them need to be baptized. But if you
[1:10:05] been if you repent of your sins and
[1:10:06] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:08] Jesus Christ, then you shall receive the
[1:10:11] gift of the Holy Ghost. I want to tell
[1:10:13] you something. That is not something
[1:10:14] that you can't get. That's something
[1:10:16] that you will have if you go God's
[1:10:18] provided way. Because you say, "Well, I
[1:10:20] just can't receive it. I've been waiting
[1:10:22] on the Lord for all these years." No.
[1:10:24] The Lord has already given it to you.
[1:10:25] You've got to accept the Holy Ghost. You
[1:10:27] say, "Well, well, what's hindering me?"
[1:10:29] I tell you what it is. God wants to see
[1:10:31] how sincere you really are. Come on.
[1:10:34] Buddy Robinson wasn't just making that
[1:10:36] statement, but Buddy Robinson was
[1:10:37] actually serious that Lord, if you don't
[1:10:39] give me the Holy Ghost, you're going to
[1:10:40] find the bones right here. Amen. He was
[1:10:42] so sincere and ready to please God that
[1:10:46] God would honor his word by giving him
[1:10:48] the Holy Ghost. So, I would say that you
[1:10:50] need to fight through all that that that
[1:10:52] land of sin spirit that we have and say,
[1:10:55] "Lord, I need another refilling of the
[1:10:57] Holy Ghost. I need to be closer to you.
[1:11:00] I need an outpouring of your Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] in this service this morning. And don't
[1:11:04] let go until God provides it for you.
[1:11:07] You say, "Well, I don't know if I can
[1:11:09] get it. It's already yours." Did you
[1:11:11] know that? I You say, "This is too
[1:11:12] positive." Did you know that the that
[1:11:14] the believer's promise is a positive
[1:11:16] promise? Yes, it is. You know, I'm not
[1:11:18] preaching to unbelievers this morning. I
[1:11:19] believe everybody in this building is a
[1:11:21] believer. I believe everybody in this
[1:11:23] building either has the Holy Ghost or
[1:11:24] will get the Holy Ghost. I believe that
[1:11:26] with all my heart. I'm not here to say
[1:11:28] somebody I just believe that. Is that
[1:11:30] okay if I just believe that y'all going
[1:11:32] to make it? And I hope you believe the
[1:11:34] same about me because I don't believe
[1:11:36] that God didn't want any of you to
[1:11:38] perish. Amen. He didn't go to the cross
[1:11:40] so so that brother Justin that you so
[1:11:42] that you could fall away. No. No. He
[1:11:43] went because he wanted to see you there.
[1:11:46] And if he wanted you there, then all
[1:11:48] you've got to accept what he's given
[1:11:50] you. But what we're fighting is a mind
[1:11:53] battle to even to get to the acceptance
[1:11:55] stage.
[1:11:57] Is that okay? Sometimes you can't accept
[1:12:00] it because you've let the devil hinder
[1:12:02] you by saying you're not good enough to
[1:12:04] accept what God's already given you. Can
[1:12:06] I say that again? That the devil is
[1:12:08] trying to stop you because he's told you
[1:12:10] you're not good enough to get what's
[1:12:12] already yours.
[1:12:15] Come on. If it's already yours, you have
[1:12:17] to fight the devil to get there. But you
[1:12:19] know you're going to get there. I went
[1:12:22] way off my notes, but I want to tell you
[1:12:23] something. Don't let that devil talk to
[1:12:25] you and get you down in you down in the
[1:12:28] dumps and say, "Well, I I just can't
[1:12:30] make it. I can't be a message believer.
[1:12:32] Maybe I wasn't meant to be a message
[1:12:34] believer." That's the devil. And if
[1:12:36] you'll reject that devil, he'll flee far
[1:12:38] from you. Can you say amen? I I think
[1:12:40] what we've done, we've let the devil,
[1:12:42] we've let the devil take up residence,
[1:12:44] and we need to let the let the devil go
[1:12:45] right back to hell where he came from.
[1:12:47] Can the church say amen? Don't let him
[1:12:49] Don't let him squat on God's property.
[1:12:52] You are God's children. you are gods and
[1:12:54] and God gave you an inheritance and and
[1:12:56] the Holy Ghost was yours. And and so
[1:12:58] brother Rain would go on like this. He
[1:13:00] said, "There's the land." And yet some
[1:13:01] of them couldn't couldn't take it. They
[1:13:03] said, "We can't take it." Joshua and
[1:13:04] Caleb, they knew that God had said they
[1:13:06] said, "We can take it. It's ours." Why
[1:13:08] Jericho was so big till they could run
[1:13:10] two chariots around in a horse race? How
[1:13:12] could we go there with our little spears
[1:13:13] and so forth and the gates are shut up
[1:13:15] and great men in there look like giants
[1:13:17] and the Canaanites probably the the
[1:13:19] descents of Ham. And he said, "How could
[1:13:21] we ever go in and take that?" You see,
[1:13:22] they looked at the natural part. How
[1:13:24] could this woman walk? How could that
[1:13:26] one? How could this man ever get out of
[1:13:27] the out of the fix that he was in? And
[1:13:29] he was fixing to die in a few days with
[1:13:30] heart trouble. How could he be made well
[1:13:32] right now? It's unreasonable. But you
[1:13:34] can't reason it out. God isn't known by
[1:13:37] reasons. No man understands it. You've
[1:13:39] got to accept it by faith and say it's
[1:13:42] so.
[1:13:44] So, when you get to thinking, "I can't
[1:13:46] do it." That's because you're letting
[1:13:48] the intellectual mind come in the way of
[1:13:50] God's promise. If you're saying, "Well,
[1:13:52] I just don't think I can take the land."
[1:13:54] The land was already given to you. All
[1:13:56] you have to do is possess it. And and
[1:13:58] and see, it's so easy. But what you've
[1:14:01] got to do is remember there will be a
[1:14:02] battle between you and the land.
[1:14:05] Young people, when you go to camp, there
[1:14:07] will be a battle between you and
[1:14:08] receiving the Holy Ghost over there. I
[1:14:10] mean, there's going you're going to look
[1:14:10] around at the people and say, "Well, if
[1:14:12] I act like a holy roller, then they're
[1:14:13] going to laugh at me. Or if I, you know,
[1:14:15] if I shout, listen, you may not even
[1:14:17] shout. You may not speak in tongues.
[1:14:19] That doesn't mean you didn't get it.
[1:14:20] Come on.
[1:14:21] I want you young people to know when you
[1:14:23] go to youth camps, don't go over there
[1:14:24] and say, "Well, I've got to act like so
[1:14:26] and so or I didn't get it." No, that's
[1:14:27] that's what the that's what the devil
[1:14:29] wants you to think. They may have really
[1:14:31] got it, but you may have really got it,
[1:14:33] too, sitting in your seat and the tears
[1:14:35] rolling down from your face. And I
[1:14:37] looked at Brother Ryan staying there and
[1:14:38] worshiping service after service. I'm
[1:14:41] telling you, he may not have been the
[1:14:42] loudest person in the building, but what
[1:14:43] I saw was God get a hold of a young man
[1:14:46] and change him for the better.
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:51] I think we need to fight for our
[1:14:52] children. I think we need to fight for
[1:14:54] our Listen, our young people, they're
[1:14:56] going to grow up in a worse environment
[1:14:58] than you did. I don't care. The best
[1:14:59] home in here. They're going to wor grow
[1:15:01] up in an environment where the devil's
[1:15:02] going to fight them worse than anybody.
[1:15:04] I know you old-timers have said, you
[1:15:06] know, it was bad in my day, but you
[1:15:07] don't understand what's going on now.
[1:15:09] You don't understand what technology's
[1:15:10] done. You don't understand what the
[1:15:12] devil's using for our young people
[1:15:13] because he knows we're getting real
[1:15:15] close to the end time. And he knows that
[1:15:17] if he can if he can stop these young
[1:15:19] people from from getting this message of
[1:15:20] the hour. Amen. That he can he he thinks
[1:15:22] he can stop a rapture. But there will be
[1:15:24] a people. Come on. Can you say amen?
[1:15:27] There will be a young people that'll
[1:15:28] rise up. If this message goes on for 50
[1:15:30] years, there's going to be young
[1:15:32] preachers sitting right here on this
[1:15:33] front row. I believe it with all my
[1:15:34] heart. Somebody's not going to give in
[1:15:36] to the pressures of the world, but
[1:15:38] they're going to stand and be very
[1:15:40] courageous with the message of the hour.
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:46] Brother Random says it's so against
[1:15:47] science. It's against knowledge. The
[1:15:50] knowledge of this world is foolish.
[1:15:51] Foolishness before God. It's against all
[1:15:53] scientific research for a virgin to
[1:15:55] bring forth a child. But she did it. Did
[1:15:58] you you believe that? You realize that
[1:16:00] that was God there. The same God that
[1:16:02] was with Moses. Was the same God that
[1:16:04] created Amen. the the the egg and and
[1:16:07] the womb and everything right there for
[1:16:09] that baby to be born again. It was the
[1:16:10] same God. And God spoke and said, "Let
[1:16:12] there be." And it was I heard this I
[1:16:14] believe last night and and God was God
[1:16:17] was back there before the foundation of
[1:16:18] the world and and and and it was just
[1:16:20] void and and he had angels to worship
[1:16:23] him. But then he had to create you to
[1:16:25] worship him because you know what it's
[1:16:27] like to overcome. You know what it's
[1:16:29] like to be redeemed. You know what it's
[1:16:31] like to really worship. You know the
[1:16:32] angels are holy, holy, holy. And they've
[1:16:34] never they've never overcome nothing.
[1:16:36] They they can't even sing Amazing Grace
[1:16:38] like you can sing Amazing Grace. Can you
[1:16:40] say amen? Amen. He looked beyond my
[1:16:42] faults and saw my need. The Listen, the
[1:16:44] angels can't even sing that song. But
[1:16:46] you can sing it because you fought past
[1:16:49] all the demons that have tried to take
[1:16:50] you out and you're here this morning in
[1:16:53] spite of what the devil has tried to do
[1:16:55] to you. Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:58] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:16:59] He said days of He said, "People will
[1:17:00] say the days of miracles has passed.
[1:17:02] There's a whole lot of parasites saying
[1:17:04] I don't believe in them holy rollers,
[1:17:05] but go in and take it. It's yours."
[1:17:07] Listen, church, when when did we ever
[1:17:09] get to thinking that we're we're so
[1:17:10] educated and that we we we've got to we
[1:17:12] got to worship a certain way? I want you
[1:17:14] to go ahead and say take it just like
[1:17:16] this and and say, you know what, a
[1:17:17] prophet was not against worship.
[1:17:20] A prophet was not against raising your
[1:17:22] hands. A prophet was not against you
[1:17:23] shouting in church. A pro. Come on,
[1:17:26] somebody. A prophet wasn't against it.
[1:17:28] He never took the gifts and put them out
[1:17:30] of the church. Come on. Can you say
[1:17:32] amen? Amen. We do all things decently in
[1:17:34] order just like the Bible said. Amen.
[1:17:36] But if you want to shout, then shout. If
[1:17:39] you want to run, run. If you want to be,
[1:17:41] if you want, if you feel good enough to
[1:17:42] do that in church, I say don't let the
[1:17:44] devil stop you from taking a hold of it
[1:17:47] and run it. If you want to run, come on,
[1:17:49] somebody listen. You say, "Well, you're
[1:17:50] trying to work people up." No. What
[1:17:51] you've done is we're fighting a spirit
[1:17:53] of the age. And the devil don't want you
[1:17:55] to be excited over this message. He
[1:17:57] don't hinder you at the ball game. He
[1:17:58] don't hinder you watching the TV. He
[1:18:00] don't hinder you. Well, can you say
[1:18:02] amen? He don't hinder you at nothing
[1:18:04] else. But what he's hindering you at is
[1:18:06] worshiping God in the place where God
[1:18:09] has called you to worship him. If he if
[1:18:12] he let us have the freedoms and the
[1:18:13] liberties because of the men that died
[1:18:15] just so you could go to church, then
[1:18:17] don't you think that he wants you to
[1:18:18] worship him? You say, "Well, why why
[1:18:20] would I worship him? I don't have no
[1:18:22] reason." Then you've never experienced
[1:18:24] grace.
[1:18:25] If you've ever experienced grace, you'll
[1:18:27] worship God because you know what you
[1:18:29] are without the grace of God. You know
[1:18:31] what you've been. You know what God has
[1:18:33] made you and you worship because of
[1:18:36] grace.
[1:18:38] You say, "Well, somebody worked me up,
[1:18:39] so I was just I was just doing what
[1:18:41] they're doing." Listen, I that's the
[1:18:43] wrong reason to worship. The reason to
[1:18:44] worship is because of what God's already
[1:18:46] done for you. The reason to worship is
[1:18:48] because you know you're in a battle and
[1:18:49] you don't even see a way out of it. But
[1:18:51] you know, on the other side is victory
[1:18:53] for you and victory for your family and
[1:18:55] victory for your relationship. Come on,
[1:18:57] church. There's victory for you on the
[1:19:00] other side of this battle because he
[1:19:01] went before you in battle and already
[1:19:04] made it possible on the other side. You
[1:19:06] say, "This ain't deep enough for me this
[1:19:08] morning." Listen, how you ever going to
[1:19:09] accept what God's got to teach you if
[1:19:11] you can't get yourself out of the way
[1:19:12] long enough to realize who he is? God
[1:19:15] does want to teach you the things of
[1:19:16] God. God wants you to understand the
[1:19:17] mysteries, but first of all, he wants to
[1:19:20] get a surrendered heart that will say,
[1:19:21] "It's not about what I know. I'm going
[1:19:23] to get rid of my intellect. I'm gonna
[1:19:25] get rid of all these things and I'm
[1:19:26] going to say, "Lord, whatever you want
[1:19:28] for me, I'll worship you. I I I'll go to
[1:19:31] church. I I'll do all the Listen,
[1:19:32] church. I I I I want you to know
[1:19:34] something. God's given you grace enough
[1:19:36] to be here. Then worship him when you're
[1:19:38] here.
[1:19:41] Thank you, Lord. Come on now. It's all
[1:19:43] about grace because he went before you.
[1:19:46] It wasn't you that went before in
[1:19:47] battle. I hope you're hearing me this
[1:19:50] morning. It wasn't you, brother Bill,
[1:19:51] that looked to see how long how how am I
[1:19:53] going to come through that heart
[1:19:54] surgery? How am I going to come through?
[1:19:56] Where where's my kids going to be? The
[1:19:58] kids are going to be over there with you
[1:19:59] on the other side. Come on. You know
[1:20:01] why? Because he gave them to you. They
[1:20:04] are your possession.
[1:20:07] Is that okay? Is that too much faith?
[1:20:09] No. That's the truth. You say, "If I'm
[1:20:11] going to get over there, are my kids
[1:20:13] going to make it?" Yes, because you
[1:20:15] don't have to go see him. But a prophet
[1:20:17] already went over there. And and listen,
[1:20:19] I don't believe it's just all that he
[1:20:21] ever loved and all that ever loved him.
[1:20:23] Because it wasn't this is not just a
[1:20:25] prophet's message. This is a bride
[1:20:27] message. And if you have taken a hold of
[1:20:29] this message, then what a prophet saw
[1:20:31] over there was you. And if you were over
[1:20:34] there, can I I hope you're okay with
[1:20:36] this this morning. This might be
[1:20:37] stepping out a little bit, but it's okay
[1:20:39] because I believe by faith you can look
[1:20:40] over there and say, "All that I've ever
[1:20:42] loved and all that ever loved me is
[1:20:43] going to be there."
[1:20:46] You say, "Is that prophecy?" No, that's
[1:20:47] just faith. Why would you ever want to
[1:20:49] believe any different? Why would you
[1:20:50] want to believe any different? Why would
[1:20:51] you want to believe some of my kids
[1:20:52] ain't going to make it? Why would you
[1:20:55] want to believe some of this church
[1:20:56] ain't going to make it?
[1:20:58] Is that okay? Whether you're in this
[1:21:00] church, another church, or any other
[1:21:02] church. We we we're believing for you
[1:21:04] and you believe for me and and we're
[1:21:06] going to be there together one of these
[1:21:08] days. You say, "Well, you don't know
[1:21:09] what I'm going through. I don't need to
[1:21:11] know what you're going through. I know
[1:21:12] who is before you in battle and he's
[1:21:15] already overcome for you."
[1:21:17] Is that okay this morning? Somebody say,
[1:21:19] "Praise the Lord." Brother Brandon would
[1:21:22] say it like this. He said, "We're
[1:21:22] longing for somewhere where there's no
[1:21:24] death, no sorrow, no heartaches."
[1:21:28] Somebody say amen to that. No old age.
[1:21:31] That land is somewhere and we'll never
[1:21:34] be able to achieve it by guns and
[1:21:35] fighting and so forth of the natural
[1:21:38] carnal weapon. But there is a land that
[1:21:40] we can go to and it's a battle to get
[1:21:43] there.
[1:21:45] I hope I can make this as clear as
[1:21:46] possible. This is how it come to me.
[1:21:48] It's always a battle. You're always
[1:21:50] going to fight. You have to fight. But
[1:21:54] in the end, it's all grace because he
[1:21:56] knew you would overcome. And I don't
[1:21:58] know how to say that any better. It's
[1:21:59] it's just it is grace that you made it
[1:22:01] this far. And it's grace that's leading
[1:22:03] you home. But you you couldn't give up
[1:22:06] on grace. Come on. Amen. If you're
[1:22:09] following, when Moses was following the
[1:22:10] pillar of fire, he couldn't give up on
[1:22:12] the pillar of fire and say, "Maybe
[1:22:14] that's just a maybe that's just
[1:22:16] something in the sky. Maybe that's just
[1:22:19] something in the bush." He couldn't give
[1:22:21] up on the pillar of fire because that's
[1:22:23] what was going to lead him to the
[1:22:24] promised land to where he could look
[1:22:26] over and see where the children were
[1:22:28] going to go. You see, he couldn't give
[1:22:29] up. You say, "Well, what about all the
[1:22:31] battles? Why why couldn't he get there
[1:22:32] in three or four days?" And listen,
[1:22:34] because God would God would look down on
[1:22:36] his people and see they would complain
[1:22:37] and they would gripe and and they would
[1:22:39] give up on God time and time again and
[1:22:42] Moses would have to stand there and
[1:22:43] intercede for the people. You say, "Why
[1:22:45] have we been in this world so long?"
[1:22:46] Amen. Because he's waiting for somebody
[1:22:48] to get ready. Amen. And actually take a
[1:22:50] hold of this message and let rapturing
[1:22:52] faith come on the inside of you so that
[1:22:54] you can be changed. Listen, we're
[1:22:56] waiting for one more or two or whatever.
[1:22:58] But there's one that's got to come in
[1:23:00] before we can get out of here. And that
[1:23:02] one may be here this morning. Just
[1:23:03] because you're in church don't mean
[1:23:05] you're ready to go. But if you're here,
[1:23:07] then that means you've got a desire to
[1:23:09] go. And if you've got a desire, there's
[1:23:11] somebody made a way for you and you need
[1:23:13] to get a go ahead and say, you know
[1:23:15] what, I'm not looking at my
[1:23:16] circumstances. I'm not looking at what I
[1:23:18] used to do. I used to smoke. I used to
[1:23:20] drink. Amen. I used to go out and run
[1:23:22] the run the nightclubs or whatever
[1:23:24] you've done. God don't look at that no
[1:23:26] more. He don't look at your your
[1:23:28] previous marriage situations, but he
[1:23:30] wants you to look forward and say, "I
[1:23:32] have a way provided for you. You've made
[1:23:34] all kinds of mistakes. You you've done
[1:23:36] everything wrong, but let me go before
[1:23:38] you and walk in the ways that I have
[1:23:41] have led you. And in in that way, you
[1:23:44] will be an overcomer." Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:46] But don't get to thinking it's easy.
[1:23:49] Come on.
[1:23:51] Oh, my time's almost up.
[1:23:54] So you you you get to thinking it. You
[1:23:56] get to thinking, well, if he went before
[1:23:58] me, then I don't have to fight. I want
[1:24:01] to get get just get this into you as
[1:24:02] best I
[1:24:04] can. Moses knew that he was going to
[1:24:07] deliver the children of Israel from
[1:24:08] Egypt.
[1:24:10] God had already told him. And Moses
[1:24:12] tried to argue with God and say, you
[1:24:14] know, you know, I can't I can't speak.
[1:24:17] Oh, I'll send you Aaron. He can he can
[1:24:18] speak. You know, we try to say, "Well,
[1:24:20] I'm not good enough. I I I can't do it.
[1:24:22] I I can't go down there. Listen, God
[1:24:25] didn't call you because of how good you
[1:24:26] are. Come on. Or how good-look you are.
[1:24:32] But he called you because he knew you
[1:24:35] were going to trust in him. Because you
[1:24:38] ain't good enough on your own. You know,
[1:24:40] you needed a savior.
[1:24:42] I hope this is okay. The best of you
[1:24:45] needed a savior.
[1:24:47] The best person in this building had to
[1:24:48] have a savior because without him, you'd
[1:24:50] be lost just like everybody else.
[1:24:52] And
[1:24:53] so Moses goes down there with with with
[1:24:57] understanding from God himself from a
[1:25:00] supernatural bush that was on fire. He
[1:25:02] goes down there and he realizes these
[1:25:05] are my people and we're going to deliver
[1:25:07] these people.
[1:25:11] But there was an obstacle at every turn.
[1:25:14] Well, you can take some of them. You can
[1:25:16] take these. And and he and he and he
[1:25:18] even lets lets them go. But he wants to
[1:25:20] keep their livestock. And he said,
[1:25:21] "There won't be one hoof left behind."
[1:25:23] That's why I believe if he wouldn't even
[1:25:24] leave the cattle behind, he ain't going
[1:25:26] to leave your kids behind. Can you say
[1:25:28] amen? Amen. God cares about everything
[1:25:30] that you care about. I I've seen people,
[1:25:33] you know, you know, they say, "Well,
[1:25:34] brother Brandon's pets were there, but
[1:25:35] yours ain't going to be there." I mean,
[1:25:36] there ain't no reason to believe they
[1:25:37] ain't going to be. You might as well
[1:25:39] just say, "I'm going to take everything
[1:25:40] with me."
[1:25:42] There's some pets I don't want to be
[1:25:44] there, and cats can't go.
[1:25:48] Cats ain't going to heaven.
[1:25:51] If they're there, they got their own
[1:25:52] little special
[1:25:55] section. Cats. Cats in heaven. Dogs can
[1:25:58] go as long as they don't jump on
[1:26:01] me. But yeah, maybe I won't be like that
[1:26:04] over there. That'd be good, wouldn't
[1:26:06] it? Brother Ben says, "Praise the Lord.
[1:26:08] I go to brother Ben's house and that
[1:26:09] dog's scared to death to jump on my lap
[1:26:11] and jump up on everybody else's but not
[1:26:13] mine because he knows he's gonna be push
[1:26:15] pushed
[1:26:17] down." And and so Where was I at? But
[1:26:21] Moses goes down in there and everything
[1:26:23] belonged
[1:26:24] to to to God. And so everything that
[1:26:28] Moses went to get, he ended up getting
[1:26:30] it. And as soon as they get out of
[1:26:32] Egypt, there was another trial. You
[1:26:35] would think after all that it would be
[1:26:37] smooth sailing. Have you ever been in a
[1:26:39] bad trial in your life and you thought,
[1:26:40] "Man, that's got to be the worst I ever
[1:26:42] go through." And you got another one
[1:26:43] coming that's even worse. The first one
[1:26:45] was just to build your faith for what's
[1:26:47] coming.
[1:26:49] I hope that's okay. I ain't scaring you.
[1:26:51] But the same God that brought you
[1:26:52] through the first one's going to bring
[1:26:53] you through the next one. The same God
[1:26:55] that brought you through Amen. You you
[1:26:57] had some little some little illness or
[1:26:58] some little thing, but the same God that
[1:27:00] brought you through some little disease
[1:27:02] can also bring you through cancer. The
[1:27:04] same God that brought you through Amen.
[1:27:06] You you say, "Well, I prayed one time
[1:27:07] and I overcome a headache." Did you know
[1:27:09] it hadn't always happened for me, but
[1:27:10] I'll say it like this. Amen. God was
[1:27:12] doing something to build your faith
[1:27:13] because you know what? You may have
[1:27:15] another test coming and the next test
[1:27:17] may not be as easy, but God had to build
[1:27:19] your faith so that when the next trial
[1:27:21] comes, he would see you through it by
[1:27:23] building your faith from the last trial.
[1:27:26] Is that okay this morning? Amen. We're
[1:27:28] not trying to work our way in on our own
[1:27:31] on our own feelings or our own emotions
[1:27:33] or our own way of doing things, but we
[1:27:36] are going by the blood of the lamb and
[1:27:38] we are being moved forward by the same
[1:27:41] light. Amen. That was before Moses. And
[1:27:43] as I was with Moses, so will I be with
[1:27:46] you. And I will be within you. Not just
[1:27:48] in front of you. But he didn't just stay
[1:27:50] as a pillar of fire. Amen. But that same
[1:27:53] pillar of fire, amen, is the logos of
[1:27:55] God that would come into your soul and
[1:27:57] would actually lead you from your soul.
[1:28:00] Amen. So your flesh is no longer leading
[1:28:02] you. Can you say amen? Amen. Your mind
[1:28:04] is no longer leading you, but the Holy
[1:28:06] Ghost is leading you and overcoming
[1:28:08] every devil that is in your way.
[1:28:12] You see, you're not being led by
[1:28:13] intellect because intellect will fail
[1:28:14] you. Intellect will change. Intellect
[1:28:16] will make you think this one day and
[1:28:18] think this the other. Amen. But those
[1:28:19] things are not leading you. Can you say
[1:28:21] amen? Amen. The bride is not being led
[1:28:23] by those things. But the bride is being
[1:28:25] led by the word of God which is which is
[1:28:28] Christ himself that is in you. And
[1:28:30] that's the hope of glory. Can the church
[1:28:32] say amen? Amen. So if you have the Holy
[1:28:34] Ghost this morning, rejoice because you
[1:28:36] may have a battle, but you're going to
[1:28:38] come through the battle. Amen. Rejoice
[1:28:40] because in the affliction and in the
[1:28:42] battle of your life, you've already made
[1:28:44] it. Can you say amen? Brother Brandon
[1:28:47] would say it like this and I'm going to
[1:28:48] get way on down here before I run out of
[1:28:50] time. He said, "Now you say then the
[1:28:51] promise is mine." Sure, but you'll fight
[1:28:53] for every inch of it till you're well.
[1:28:55] Amen. You you you'll take every step of
[1:28:56] it. It's a battle. The promise is yours.
[1:28:59] That was a promised land. They had to
[1:29:00] fight to get every step of it. And the
[1:29:03] promise is yours, but you'll fight every
[1:29:05] inch of it. Can the church say amen? He
[1:29:08] said, "God," he said, "I was called to
[1:29:10] to to preach the gospel 31 years ago,
[1:29:12] and I fought ever since." And I've read
[1:29:14] that quote here before, but it's true.
[1:29:16] When when he was called to be a prophet,
[1:29:18] listen, the same God was in the tree
[1:29:20] that spoke to him and said, "Don't ever
[1:29:22] drink or smoke or defile your body in
[1:29:24] any way, for I've got a work to do when
[1:29:26] you get older." And then he would hear
[1:29:28] that voice and recognize that voice. And
[1:29:30] then he would actually stay that way
[1:29:32] before God. And then that God would come
[1:29:34] again on the Ohio River as uh when the
[1:29:36] 17th person was getting baptized and he
[1:29:38] would come down and as John the Baptist
[1:29:40] forun the first coming of Christ, your
[1:29:42] message will forrun the second coming of
[1:29:44] Christ. You realize it's the same God.
[1:29:46] Same God with Moses. Same God with the
[1:29:49] prophet. Same God with the bride here
[1:29:51] this morning.
[1:29:55] See, because we're a Joshua generation,
[1:29:57] as I was with Moses, so I'll be with
[1:29:59] you. As I was with William Random, I
[1:30:01] will be with the bride.
[1:30:03] Come on. Is that okay this morning? You
[1:30:06] say you're putting too much on the on
[1:30:07] the bride. No. Because you were the
[1:30:08] called people to go into the land. You
[1:30:10] were the ones that accepted the message
[1:30:12] of the hour. The message brought the
[1:30:14] promises to light. And you've accepted
[1:30:16] the promises. And now you've got to
[1:30:18] fight to get the promises that the
[1:30:20] message has told you would be here for
[1:30:22] you. Well, I hope this is okay. But I
[1:30:24] want to wrap up with this right here.
[1:30:26] The message called you to overcome. The
[1:30:29] message called you to come up higher.
[1:30:31] The message told you how to live and how
[1:30:33] to act and how to have church. The
[1:30:35] message called you to that. But now it
[1:30:37] ain't good enough to say, "Well, the
[1:30:38] message did this and the message did
[1:30:40] that." You've got to take a hold of this
[1:30:42] message and remember that as the message
[1:30:45] was with Moses, Joshua couldn't say,
[1:30:47] "Well, it was with Moses, but it ain't
[1:30:49] good enough for me." No, it was just as
[1:30:51] good for Joshua. Amen. And he may not
[1:30:53] have had the signs of Moses, but when he
[1:30:55] got to the other side, the power of the
[1:30:58] sign was still in the people.
[1:31:02] There was a powerful sign with with with
[1:31:04] Moses. Joshua didn't have that sign like
[1:31:06] Moses to go down there to the people.
[1:31:08] But what he had was the same God. Can
[1:31:10] you say amen? We don't need this. We
[1:31:12] don't need the sign, but we need the We
[1:31:14] need to believe that the same God is
[1:31:16] still here. And if he is here, all
[1:31:19] things are possible to them that will
[1:31:22] believe. And the church say amen. He
[1:31:25] said it's been a He said it's been a
[1:31:27] battle ever since. I fought ever since.
[1:31:28] Every inch of ground I fought with the
[1:31:30] sword of God taking the promise and
[1:31:32] cutting away. He said whether it's
[1:31:33] popularity, whether it's our church,
[1:31:35] whether it's our friends, our
[1:31:36] associates, whatever it may be, whether
[1:31:39] it's our doctor, whether it's our
[1:31:40] priest, whether it's our preacher, all
[1:31:42] other ground is seeking sins. He said
[1:31:44] it's Christ alone. And listen, you you
[1:31:47] start putting everything back on brother
[1:31:48] Brandham and you lose every bit of power
[1:31:50] that God has given you.
[1:31:52] Come on. It's the truth anyway. Amen.
[1:31:55] Everything. Listen, you say, "Well,
[1:31:57] there was power in a prophet." That's
[1:31:58] the truth. There was power in a prophet.
[1:32:00] Amen. But it wasn't the prophet that was
[1:32:01] powerful. It was God that was in the
[1:32:03] prophet. Amen. It is not you that's
[1:32:05] powerful. It is God that is in the
[1:32:07] bride. We don't have the sign, but we
[1:32:09] have the same God. Jesus Christ of
[1:32:13] yesterday is Jesus Christ today. And
[1:32:15] he'll still be Jesus Christ tomorrow.
[1:32:18] Can you say amen? Amen. The the Jesus
[1:32:20] the the the God of the Old Testament is
[1:32:22] the Jesus of the New Testament. The
[1:32:24] Jesus of the New Testament is the Holy
[1:32:26] Ghost in you. And what you need to know
[1:32:28] this morning is not how much how many
[1:32:30] mysteries have been here. And listen,
[1:32:31] those are good things. But before you
[1:32:33] ever get there, I think it's time we
[1:32:35] recognize who we are and what land we're
[1:32:38] going to possess and that everything is
[1:32:41] your land and everything is your
[1:32:43] possession. If it's a promise in this
[1:32:45] word, don't look back and say, "I can't
[1:32:48] get it. I can't attain it." No. No. It's
[1:32:49] It's yours. Can you say amen? Let the
[1:32:51] church say, "Amen." Amen. I I want to
[1:32:54] get down here where I can close cuz I
[1:32:56] Brother Ben told me I had until
[1:32:59] 12:00. 12:00 is almost
[1:33:03] here. Brother Brandham talked about
[1:33:06] Abraham Lincoln being in Memorial Day.
[1:33:10] He talked about Abraham Lincoln giving
[1:33:12] his life
[1:33:14] for what he believed in.
[1:33:16] And you know, Abraham
[1:33:18] Lincoln when when he come into office,
[1:33:21] you know, there there was there was even
[1:33:23] people that didn't like him and you
[1:33:24] know, there was there was people in the
[1:33:25] south and there was people in the north
[1:33:26] and and you know, there was division all
[1:33:27] over. But when he became president, you
[1:33:29] know, he he determined he he purposed in
[1:33:31] his heart that he was going to set those
[1:33:33] people free and and and there would be a
[1:33:35] a great, you know, emancipation and and
[1:33:37] he would actually come down. he would he
[1:33:40] would actually go and he would he would
[1:33:41] he would actually have to take a side
[1:33:43] because because he was he would have to
[1:33:45] be against these other people. He tried
[1:33:46] to bring peace and and peace wasn't
[1:33:48] working. So So he had to actually just
[1:33:49] take a side and and say all men were
[1:33:51] created equal. And and listen church, I
[1:33:54] want to say this morning that if a man
[1:33:55] would give his life for his country, how
[1:33:58] much more ought we give our life to the
[1:34:00] man who saved my soul? What about us
[1:34:02] giving our life to the one who has who
[1:34:04] has given us the Holy Ghost? What about
[1:34:06] the What about giving your life for this
[1:34:08] message? What about giving your life
[1:34:09] because he's worthy? Can you say amen?
[1:34:12] What about giving everything? Because if
[1:34:14] a man could die so that people could be
[1:34:16] set free and that was a great thing, one
[1:34:19] of the greatest things in history, but
[1:34:20] there was a greater thing in history.
[1:34:22] And that's when Jesus Christ would die
[1:34:24] for every man. It didn't matter his skin
[1:34:27] color. It didn't matter where he went to
[1:34:29] church. It didn't matter what he did.
[1:34:31] But what he did, he the ground was
[1:34:32] level. Amen. Everybody was under the
[1:34:35] blood. Everybody that would accept it
[1:34:37] was under the blood. And I still believe
[1:34:38] today that somebody has got to recognize
[1:34:41] that I can't win on my own. But under
[1:34:44] this blood, I have the authority to
[1:34:46] overcome in this generation.
[1:34:49] Come on. Under the blood, under the Holy
[1:34:51] Ghost, under everything we have need of.
[1:34:54] God has given us resources to fight and
[1:34:57] win.
[1:35:00] He's given us resources to win the
[1:35:02] battle. Can you say amen? Brother would
[1:35:04] say it like this in closing. He said,
[1:35:06] "What is it?" the word God's artillery
[1:35:09] in the human being manifested the
[1:35:11] resurre manifesting the resurrection he
[1:35:14] said think of it that great conqueror
[1:35:15] who conquered every sickness conquered
[1:35:17] every superstition conquered every giant
[1:35:19] conquered everything there was to be
[1:35:21] conquered on earth died and conquered
[1:35:23] hell can the church say amen and
[1:35:25] conquered death conquered the grave
[1:35:27] conquered the atmospheres ascended up on
[1:35:29] high and come back in the form of the
[1:35:30] Holy Ghost and we are more than a
[1:35:33] conqueror through him that loved us and
[1:35:35] the church said amen Amen. He said, "And
[1:35:37] and like a mighty army marches the
[1:35:40] Christian soldier. Great triumph. He's
[1:35:42] in us." Can the church say, "Amen."
[1:35:44] Amen. This is the word to you that we
[1:35:46] are we are a great army. A and we're not
[1:35:49] going on our own, but he is marching on
[1:35:51] the inside of us. He is marching on the
[1:35:54] inside and there will be great
[1:35:56] triumphant. He's already conquered. He
[1:35:58] said he's in us, not me. He's already
[1:36:00] conquered it. He said, "I don't have to
[1:36:02] do a thing, but just believe him and
[1:36:04] walk on." He said, "Yes, sir. For he is
[1:36:06] risen. His spirit is in us. The great
[1:36:09] victor, the resurrection presence is in
[1:36:12] us. He said we've raised from the things
[1:36:14] of the world from unbelief and creeds to
[1:36:16] a living Christ with every power of the
[1:36:18] enemy defeated. Even death itself is
[1:36:20] defeated. Can you say amen? He said
[1:36:22] hell's defeated. The grave's defeated.
[1:36:25] Every sickness is defeated. He said not
[1:36:27] not me a conqueror. He conquered.
[1:36:31] Come on, church. He's already done it
[1:36:33] for you. He already did it for the
[1:36:35] prophet. But he's already done it for
[1:36:37] you. You can put your name there and
[1:36:40] say, "He already did it for me. He
[1:36:42] already healed me of this cancer. He
[1:36:44] already healed me of this backslitting
[1:36:46] condition. He has already done it for
[1:36:49] me." Thank you, Lord. He said, "Where's
[1:36:52] he at me? I've passed from death unto
[1:36:55] life." Musicians come. He said, "I've
[1:36:56] passed from death unto life. Someone
[1:36:58] said, Billy, you act silly. Maybe I am,
[1:37:00] but I feel better this way and just let
[1:37:03] me alone." He said, "That's right. In
[1:37:05] here, I got life out there. I was dead.
[1:37:07] I'm a lot better off living today." He
[1:37:09] said, "Amen. Oh, I love it. Don't go
[1:37:11] before us. He goes in us." Amen. He went
[1:37:14] before you in battle, but now he's more
[1:37:16] than just with you, but he's even in
[1:37:19] you. Can you say, "Amen." Amen. He's not
[1:37:21] just a God a far off, but he's an
[1:37:23] everpresent God. Amen. He was the
[1:37:25] everpresent water in the rock. Amen. He
[1:37:27] was he was he was he was a logos of God.
[1:37:30] But but I want you to know today, he is
[1:37:32] more than just a god in the sky. He's
[1:37:35] more than just a constellation of
[1:37:36] angels, but he's in you this morning and
[1:37:39] he wants to make you a powerhouse in the
[1:37:42] kingdom of God. Can the church say amen?
[1:37:45] Brother tells that story about that fire
[1:37:47] chief in Jeffersonville and he says, you
[1:37:49] know, the old chief, he said down in
[1:37:50] Jeffersonville, he said they couldn't
[1:37:51] fight. He said they he said they they
[1:37:53] they they would they were trying to
[1:37:54] fight that fire and and he said that he
[1:37:57] said that chief would would go on like
[1:37:58] that and and you know fight put a little
[1:38:00] water here, put a little water there and
[1:38:02] you know intellectually let's do it this
[1:38:03] way and let's do it that way. He said
[1:38:05] but then there come over there was come
[1:38:06] somebody who knew what they were doing
[1:38:08] and they come over there and he said he
[1:38:10] brought the big fire fire fire truck
[1:38:11] over and he said that chief didn't just
[1:38:13] tell the boys you know do this and do
[1:38:14] that and put a little water here, put a
[1:38:16] little water there. go. He said that
[1:38:18] chief got up and went up the ladder and
[1:38:19] said, "Come on, let's go." And I believe
[1:38:21] we've got a captain here today that is
[1:38:23] not telling you what to do, but he's
[1:38:24] already went before you. He knows the
[1:38:26] steps you're going to take. He Come on,
[1:38:28] church. He knows everything you have
[1:38:30] need of this morning. He knows every
[1:38:32] doctor's visit that's not going to go
[1:38:33] how you want it to go, but he already
[1:38:36] knows what you need.
[1:38:39] If you need salvation this morning, it's
[1:38:40] here for you. If you need the Holy Ghost
[1:38:42] this morning, it's here for you. If you
[1:38:44] need an overcoming uh experience this
[1:38:47] morning, it's here for you. Reach out
[1:38:49] and say, "Lord, you've already led me to
[1:38:51] this place. Let me worship you where
[1:38:53] you've put me this
[1:38:56] morning. He is God and he doesn't
[1:38:59] change. I am God and I change
[1:39:02] not. If he could deliver children of
[1:39:04] Israel out of Egypt and bondage, he can
[1:39:06] deliver you out of every situation this
[1:39:08] morning. The only thing he asked you is
[1:39:10] this. Be strong and very
[1:39:14] courageous because your enemy, the
[1:39:17] devil, is roaming to and fro throughout
[1:39:19] the earth. He's seeking whom he may
[1:39:21] devour. He's trying to take your joy.
[1:39:23] He's trying to take your children. He's
[1:39:25] trying to take your love for one
[1:39:26] another. Can you say amen? But what he's
[1:39:28] what he's given back to you this
[1:39:30] morning, he's giving you everything that
[1:39:32] the devil's tried to take from you. This
[1:39:34] is a message of restoration. Everything
[1:39:36] the devil stole from you can be restored
[1:39:39] back to you this morning. You say, "I
[1:39:41] need joy. I need peace. I need healing."
[1:39:43] It's yours this morning. If you could
[1:39:45] just believe it. I wonder if we could
[1:39:46] stand together. If there's somebody in
[1:39:49] the building this morning that needs
[1:39:50] healing, I want you to just put your
[1:39:52] hand up and say, "Lord, heal my body."
[1:39:55] Every eye closed, every head bowed. If
[1:39:57] there's anybody that needs salvation, I
[1:39:59] want you to put your hand up and say,
[1:40:00] "Lord, I I I want to I want to be
[1:40:03] saved." If there's anybody in here that
[1:40:05] needs the Holy Ghost, put your hand up
[1:40:07] to him this morning. Say, "Lord, save my
[1:40:09] soul.
[1:40:10] I wonder if there's be one this morning
[1:40:11] to say, "Lord, I've gotten cold on you.
[1:40:13] I feel backsliden." Lord, would you
[1:40:15] restore the joy of my salvation? I know
[1:40:19] I'm saved, but I need the joy restored.
[1:40:21] If there's one in the building this
[1:40:23] morning that would say, "Lord, I I've
[1:40:25] gotten cold. I need you to take me back
[1:40:27] to the place where I left you. Take me
[1:40:30] back to where I where you where you were
[1:40:32] real to me. Take me back to that place
[1:40:34] and let me have the joy of the Lord
[1:40:36] again. Let me serve with the ferveny.
[1:40:39] Again, if you have a need on your heart
[1:40:41] this morning, just put your hand up to
[1:40:43] him. He
[1:40:44] sees and knows
[1:40:47] every every need that you is behind the
[1:40:50] hands. He knows
[1:40:52] everything. Heaven
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:57] shine. Oh yes, he
[1:41:01] knew me. Do you believe it this morning?
[1:41:05] Oh yet he
[1:41:09] loved
[1:41:12] me. Oh it was he whose
[1:41:18] glory
[1:41:19] made all the
[1:41:22] heaven
[1:41:24] shine. I know we're unworthy but aren't
[1:41:26] you thankful he did it. I'm so unworthy.
[1:41:35] Oh, of such
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:41] mercy. Oh, but when
[1:41:45] he was on the
[1:41:50] cross, you and
[1:41:52] I was on. Amen. If you need prayer this
[1:41:56] morning, the altar's open. Oh, he knew
[1:42:00] me. You believe he knows you this
[1:42:02] morning?
[1:42:05] Oh, he
[1:42:07] loved
[1:42:10] me. Oh,
[1:42:12] it was he whose
[1:42:16] glory made all the
[1:42:20] heaven all the heavens
[1:42:24] shine. Oh, I was
[1:42:27] so I was so unworthy.
[1:42:32] Oh Lord of s
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:39] mercy. Oh when he was on the
[1:42:48] cross. Oh
[1:42:50] I was
[1:42:52] on his mind. We change that to key of
[1:42:57] G. You are worthy of it all.
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:04] Lord, you are worthy of it
[1:43:12] all. From you are all
[1:43:15] things and to you are all
[1:43:19] things. You deserve the

[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:40] And to you are all things.
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:47] I say this to you before we leave. First
[1:44:50] Timothy says it like this. But thou, oh
[1:44:52] man of God, flee these things, and
[1:44:53] follow after righteousness, godliness,
[1:44:55] faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight
[1:44:58] the good fight of faith. Thank you,
[1:45:00] Lord. Lay hold on eternal life. Somebody
[1:45:03] say, "Praise the Lord." whereto thou art
[1:45:06] also called and hast professed a good
[1:45:10] profession before before many witnesses.
[1:45:13] So if you don't take nothing else from
[1:45:14] this service this morning, can we fight
[1:45:16] the good fight of faith?
[1:45:18] Fight with everything you've got to
[1:45:20] overcome what's trying to hold you back
[1:45:22] this morning. Let's sing that again with
[1:45:24] all of our hearts. If anybody else needs
[1:45:25] prayer, we'll pray for you. Worthy of it
[1:45:40] all. You deserve the glory.
[1:45:47] You are worthy of it
[1:45:53] all. You are worthy of it
[1:45:59] [Music]

[1:47:45] He's worthy of every praise in the
[1:47:47] building. Oh, you are
[1:47:50] worthy. Oh yes, you
[1:47:53] are. For from you are all
[1:47:58] things, and to you are all things.
[1:48:03] You
[1:48:04] deserve the
[1:48:06] glory. I think this one's in a key of
[1:48:09] C. Well, I thought
[1:48:12] number
[1:48:14] one would
[1:48:16] surely be
[1:48:19] me. I thought
[1:48:21] I could be oh, what I
[1:48:26] wanted to be.
[1:48:30] Well, I thought of
[1:48:33] myself as a mighty mighty big man, but
[1:48:39] Lord, I can't
[1:48:42] even
[1:48:43] walk without you,

[1:48:56] walk without you.
[1:49:00] holding my hand. Oh yes, the
[1:49:05] mountains too high and the
[1:49:09] valley much too wide. Oh, down
[1:49:15] on my knees.
[1:49:19] Lord, I learn to stand.
[1:49:23] Lord, I can't
[1:49:25] even
[1:49:27] walk without you
[1:49:31] holding my
[1:49:34] hand. Oh yes, I thought
[1:49:38] I had
[1:49:40] done a lot
[1:49:43] on my own. Oh, I thought
[1:49:48] I could make it. make it
[1:49:53] all
[1:49:55] alone. Oh, I thought
[1:49:58] I could build. Oh, on life
[1:50:04] s, but Lord, I can't even. Oh, somebody
[1:50:08] testify this morning. We can't walk

[1:50:17] Lord, I can't
[1:50:20] even walk without you holding holding on
[1:50:26] to my
[1:50:28] hand. The
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] mountains much too high and the
[1:50:35] valleys too wide. Oh, down
[1:50:40] on my knees. Lord, that's where I learn.
[1:50:47] Oh yes. Oh Lord, I can't
[1:50:50] even
[1:50:52] walk without you holding. Oh, sing it
[1:50:56] one more time with all your hearts
[1:50:58] now. Oh
