the Lord tonight man it's good to be here I'm a little under the weather you forgive my voice I I feel good I just my voice hadn't come back yet and so maybe it'll warm up and and it'll be all right if you have your Bibles I'll let you turn to Matthew 5 48 just one verse just one verse here before you're seated to Matthew 5 verse 48. amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night all the things we could be doing I'm sure but uh there's no tornadoes outside that I know of so that that's good and y'all are still here I don't guess nobody was hurt last night hey man it woke us up was up the sirens was going off in Cherokee for seemed like forever and and my daughter was awake and she's finally we said well the tornadoes are passing she said yay she was done so were weak I was ready to sleep and then sirens and my phone go off and my wife's phone I was like my goodness you know I gotta preach tomorrow night and work tomorrow so Satan was just just fighting a little bit but you know what it don't matter how much he fights there's always Victory to the believer doesn't matter what we go through God is always there to give us what we need not always what we want but what we need tonight I've been listening to some of the Easter sermons if you get a chance to go listen to some of the ones that brother Brandon preached around this time right before Easter he deals with so many things and uh about perfection and he deals with a lot of things about a perfect sacrifice and and about the things that would come right before Easter and he deals a lot about the law and and things like that and if you go listen to some of those sermons they're just just look at some of the Easter sermons and go back just a few tapes they're just so inspiring and so good because he takes it kind of like a drama it seemed like on every one of my Founders like a drama that he would preach and it was just making it real and when you can really bring into Focus what Calvary did for us this time of year it can change your entire outlook on life it makes the politics in the world it makes what's happening with the previous president of the current president or who will be president next it makes those things seem so small because those things don't really have any effect on our future at all it does a little on this current life but it has no effect on our Eternal destination I'm thankful for that this world is not our final resting place it is not our final destination but we are going somewhere where there's no more politics there is no more uh sickness there's no more death there's nothing that can interfere with our joy and our happiness and just an eternal perfection and that's what we want to go to and that's what we want to get ready for here and so I'm sorry I'll let you be seated just a second let's read this be therefore perfect even as your father which is head in heaven is perfect you may be seated and I did start my timer and it's running so I will be out of here on time tonight Lord willing brother Branham goes on to say this in a message Perfection he said God requires perfection we want to bear that in mind that there is nothing just part way can go in the presence of God it must be perfect or worship everything he said now in the Garden of Eden God had Adam and Eve in the garden and they had sinned and transgressed the laws of God by sinning and Disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of God him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spot of unholiness can ever stand in his presence he said so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of God and so in the Old Testament when Adam and Eve were there it was all Perfection there was no sin there was no death there was no sickness there was nothing could enter this perfect place called Eden it was Perfection it is something that we strive to go back to but it is something that we we can't and this flesh go to it is something that we can only achieve through the blood that God had God's son had shed for us and so you can see through the law there there had to come a death so every time they would sin there had to be an atonement made and so they would use a lamb and brother Braden will tell the story and he will dramatize that over and over about a lamb and how it would have to be slain every time someone would would sin and every year maybe the worshiper would have to go kill a lamb for the sins he had done for that year think about it every year it was never Perfection it was always that was sinning we're messing up and brother Brandon said they would go out of the tents or out of the congregation he said that after they had just killed the lamb they had just put their hands on the jugular vein they had just killed this lamb and they had felt the blood all over the worshiper brother random called it and he said the blood was all over him and when the blood got there and he said he said the worshiper still would leave that lamb and go away and still have the same desire he had when he came to the land he said the same desire he said that blood of the animal could not change the life of the human and that's what brother Branham had brought in he said that was not Perfection it was just a a law it was something that that was permitted he said because there was going to be a Perfection by a lamb so it was just something to show you what was to come but he said and they would do that think about the thousands of years that they had to do this how many lambs had to be killed for the sins of the people innocent Lambs they had never done anything but innocently had to be killed because people's lives could not be transformed by the blood so the blood and they would sit there and brother Brave talked about it and if you ever go hear the drama he just makes it so real he said the sinner would would have to kill this lamb and he said you had to feel it you had to get right down on the lamb and the lamb had to had to die in such a way that it would try to make you feel bad it would it would make you feel so guilty so bad that this lamb had to be something that would die for you because of how bad you've been because of the sin you committed not the lamb but what you did and the lamb had to die for you and he said he would hold that thing and he said he would take a rock a sharp Rock and he would cut that juggler and the blood would spray everywhere and he said the the wool would turn red and he said the the worshiper would stand there just covered in blood from a lamb and he said even after all of that the worshiper would go out and his heart would still desire sin think about it something that dramatic that that horse of a punishment for an animal that didn't deserve death and yet the worshiper would still have the desire see that's what Satan has put in you if you have a desire to sin that did not come from God that has come straight from the devil and you think about it God and brother Brandon goes on down he said the law required it justice required the law and he said when the law he said now the law cannot save us the law was just the thing that put us in the jail he said but it has no redeeming power the law showed us that we were Sinners it condemned us it condemned this the worshiper to see the lamb bloody and and it condemned them to feel the the the heartbeat go away from that lamb it condemned the worshiper but it didn't change his life there was no power there to change a life but there was power to condemn there was it was condemnation if you go out here and you speed through Hardy and and the the patrolman sees you he's going to pull you over and write you a ticket or take you to jail or whatever the offense is he's gonna he's gonna make the the penalty uh the crime backs the penalty the penalty match the crime and he's going to do that because why it's not Perfection but it is a law that is trying to make you do something but it doesn't change who you are many times you get a speeding ticket and the next day you're speeding again it doesn't change anything but it is a law the law can't change you Allison don't be looking at Stuart like that see the law can't change you he said God being holy and just he had to have a prosecution he had to prosecute The Sinner because he had overstepped the boundaries of Grace it had become a law-breaking citizen brother Bradham said I don't care how good your family is I don't care how good your pastor is I don't care what your family tree looks like I can trace it right back to a fallen family in the garden every one of us can there's not one above another you say well I'm from a rich family I'm from a poor family it doesn't matter I can take you all back to the same family every one of you are from a fallen family in the Garden of Eden me too every one of us we can't change that on our own only the grace of God can change that can take you from a fallen family a fallen generation somebody who had no right to live who had to sacrifice animals and and go in and couldn't even come into the temple at times because of the sins you had committed and then God made a way to change your entire course of history that's what I want I want a god like that I don't want a god who's making me go back to the the feast days and and to do all the law over again I can't live under the law because it can't change my life it can't change my family's life but I know a God who should a lamb who could change the entire history of my family your family no matter what you've been through who you came from who your daddy was who your mommy was every one of us have been changed by a lamb he said every law has a penalty and the penalty of transgressing God's law is death it had to project death to the human race all of the human race is under the penalty of this law he said that when Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with no man can commit sin of any type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of a holy God so brother Bradham goes on he talks about Adam he said Eve Adam and Eve had sinned and had transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death he said now if we can only look at this great picture and remember that every person here is included in this every person not a one of us can brag on our family tree too far back doesn't matter if you had a good dad good mom doesn't matter he could only go so far before you get right back to the beginning where they where they fell right can only go so far and then you find out hey I'm related to that person I didn't like I'm related to that person that you know that I don't like their personality I don't like the way they act hey I'm related to them we're all just humans every one of us have sinned and come short of the glory of God at some time no matter how perfect you think you are in your flesh your flesh has never been converted so it cannot be perfect it can be brought under subjection but not perfected right he said every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race Adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin think about it every one of us neither one of us could escape the Judgment of sin because of that because of what he did because of what he did in the beginning he said and sin must be dealt with he said now notice this sin God being just he could do nothing else but be just for he is the resource of all Justice he said and there would be nothing else for him to do but to place the penalty for this transgression and the penalty was death for he said this day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die he said no it's a dark picture we have here but if we go back just a little bit farther and find out the very attributes of God and I like how he does this brother Bram goes on and he says the Bible plainly tells us that God is love but yet being loved he has to be just so love does not mean just a thing that could be petted and played with love is the justice of God and he said now when God had seen that his children had transgressed his law and and that they must die the death then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way for God had seen that these children was to be absolutely totally annihilated from his presence there was nothing else to be done for they had transgressed the laws and the penalty of his law of God's law was death so then the love of God went out for his subjects think about this he knew that they had to face death because he had already said it if you eat of this tree you will die you've got to die so he knew he said God has to keep his word he knew he had to keep his word but he loved this subject so much he loved his children so much there had to be some way to redeem them and bring them back brother Stewart's been preaching on Redemption worship under Redemption you can't worship until you've been redeemed because you're still under the law of sin but then when you're redeemed you're no longer under the law but you're now living in the Realms of Grace that's where I want to live that's where you're living today you say well well I I there's a legalist group over here and these people are legal about this listen if there's any way they're ever going to be saved they had to come by Grace had to there's no other way but by grace the love of God projecting his grace upon the human race because had he not shared Grace every one of us would been had been dead and there would be no race left we all deserve nothing but death and so then the love of God he said when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace produces the object of love I'll say that again when Divine love is projected he shows us love he shows his Divine love projects it to you Sovereign Grace freely is given to every one of you it's the object of love it produces the object of love and he said in God by foreknowledge when he loved his race so well he said yet with the penalty he caused the substitutionary death to take place in the Garden of Eden he substituted an innocent creature a Little Lamb and brother Brandon goes on down and he says all through the Old Testament they offered the blood of lambs goats sheep bulls and Heifers a substitute death but all in the great economy of God there was back in his mind a real object coming he said there were Shadows of what was to come these were just types of what would come the lamb that was dying was a shadow God was allowing this to be a substitute for now because he knew what was going to come think about it all this time he allowed us to sin and be redeemed sin and be redeemed all throughout the years all the hundreds and hundreds of years but he knew that that was not going to last forever there had to come something to redeem the human race back to what she was at one time before the fall and so all through the Old Testament he said was it was a type and it was a shadow he said but he knew the real object was to come he said his only begotten son all the Lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they only spoke of a Calvary coming in Hebrews the 10th chapter it tells us the same thing brother Brandon's talked about he said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers their own too perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscience of sins let's see brother Branham tells us they kept as soon as they left the sacrifice they still had a desire to sin they went away with the desire to sin to commit sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year so something that had to be done every year think about it every year we got to come back and do this over because I because I'm a sinner I just can't seem to you you see Christians today that try to do the same thing every time there's an altar call they come and it's okay some people need to that's okay I'm not condemning that but but every time they feel just a little condemnation that shows they're still living in the Realms of the law they're still condemned in their heart but if you ever accept the sacrifices it really is then you've accepted Grace in your life and you've changed from what you were to what you know you will be you are no longer living alone the life under the law cannot be a law of freedom it is the law of bondage but he came to set us free and free indeed every one of us not one above another every one of us to have freedom right brother random talks about the law having a shadow of things to come he said could never make the worshiper he said the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshiper perfect he said now let's go he said let's go again he said you'll be sure not to miss this he said God requires perfect holiness no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sin he said Jesus Witnesses the same thing and said be perfect just like God in heaven is perfect and the Bible said the law could never with its sacrifices make the comer perfect he said then the law could not perfect anything it was only a pointer to the sacrifices made every year could never make the worship perfect so therefore no one under the law or keeping the laws or under the shadows could be perfect so all these worshipers year in year out could never be made perfect they had to do something they had to do something themselves they had to feel the pain they had to see the lamb die every one of them had to do this year in year out and it never changed their life it only gave them permission to go another year we're just going to live another year that's all they had this is just a license for another year it's like having to have it's like paying your taxes right yeah it's permission to live on your property another year you know that's what it is it's living under the law in this U.S that we live in we live under laws we are a nation of laws we're supposed to be we live in a nation of laws so if you break the law you live in bondage you live in prison you you don't get to be free that's just the way it is in this country we live in it is a nation of laws and as a a Christian many Christians still live under that you'll see some that they have to do a and I'm not pointing fingers at any certain group because I'm sure they mean well but some maybe have to have to still do the passovers and they still have to celebrate the this time of year you'll hear of lit uh things like that I mean that that's fine I mean if you want to give up something that's wonderful I should too I'm sure but but think about it if you're doing that trying to make yourself perfect it's all in vain because you're saying that the sacrifice that came wasn't perfect enough I gotta do something myself nothing you could do can perfect you not one single thing I believe in going to church I believe in paying tithes I believe in doing all these things but that is not going to perfect you not at all right you can come here every service and you can still be a sinner if you haven't accepted the ultimate sacrifice he said that brother Branham said is there if there if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me if there is one thing that you can do that would marry anything think about anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain no law keeping listen to this no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own holiness no things that you could quit doing quit lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to the picture shows still you're lost think about it nothing can change it I didn't talk about the picture shows brother Brandon did don't look at me like that she won't I guess but listen those those things you say well okay is it in what what's your heart look like I don't I don't go uh I don't smoke well are you condemning those who do maybe maybe try reaching out to them maybe try to help them you know yeah it's wrong let them know it's wrong if you need to but don't don't condemn The Sinner because you are the same way if you haven't accepted the sacrifice just because you know you don't have long hair you men don't have long hair and and you don't smoke that doesn't make you any better if you haven't accepted his sacrifice because nothing you can do can change who you really were nothing and the Bible brother says here he said and he goes on about lost my spot he said anything he said you are lost not one thing can do can you do in yourself for you are a sinner under condemnation there is not no way within yourself no Creed nothing that you could do or think of of yourself that could Merit one thing in the presence of God because you are a sinner to start with I don't care how many tapes we listen to right I encourage you to listen to tapes I listen to tapes I need to listen to more but that's not going to save me if that can replace salvation Jesus died in vain if gathering together at a certain time at a certain place can save me then we all went astray from the ultimate sacrifice we've taken a substitute again just like they did then we've went right back to living under the law the same way that they were so every year we got to do this every week we got to do this we have to do this it's a bunch of laws and legal things we must do but I want to live in the grace Realms I want to live in a place to where it doesn't matter if I do fall I want to live for God because I love God not because I have to yes I failed I failed again because I'm human yes I'm uh you know in this flesh I find it every day and you will too as long as you're in it but God saw a way to make you perfect no matter how imperfect you feel you are perfect if you've accepted the blood of Jesus Christ brother Brandon talks about he said in the presence of God he said the Archbishop born in this world was guilty as the lowest Barfly in the city one cannot atone for the other all right he said he took an innocent life of an animal a little lamb into the Old Testament laws when a man sinned and he goes on and he talks about the lamb again this is the same sermon he talks about it he talks about the little lamb kicking and screaming and if you ever go listen to this this tape it's actually called Perfection I stole the title sorry and but uh but if I'm going to copy after somebody I guess it might as well be brother Brandon right so he uh he talks about this in the message Perfection I believe it's 1954 I have to look but it's late 50s mid to late 50s there he talks about and he dramatizes this so much if you think about it you could actually think about what that lamb went through and then you can think about what Jesus went through and when you start thinking about that when you start thinking about that just real soberly sometime get up in the morning and read the story of Jesus's crucifixion not to not to make you feel guilty to show you how much he loved you for God so loved the world we see that written on all the cars and all the signs in the Baptist churches and that's great but do they really understand the sacrifice it didn't come just so you could have a license to sin that's living under the law it didn't come so I can still smoke because God loves me anyway right that's living under the law see they have the law and Grace mixed up they think well I can live under grace so I can do what I want yes you can but if you live under grace you're not going to want to do those things anymore because see the lamb couldn't change what you wanted to do but this lamb could it could change who you wanted to be it could change you from wanting to be a sinner to wanting to be a saint it would actually take on this you would take on the same nature as the lamb because it was a blood sacrifice and the animal blood could not change you but a perfect blood of God could actually change your very uh the very way you act could change the the way you're the way you worship it can change the way that you treat people because you realize that you should have been there on the cross you should have been there that day you should have had to carry the crosstalk city and you should have had to take the beating that Jesus Took you should have wore those crowns you should have been the one but God saw fit to send his only son made in His image give him up so that you could sit here today and worship freely because you don't have to be under the law of sin no more we don't have to worry about what our ancestors did no more it don't matter if my dad was a Drucker it don't matter if if your mother was a prostitute it don't matter who your family tree is anymore because you have been changed by the blood of Jesus you say well I want to hear some deep Revelations there's one for you you get changed one time and it will lead you and guide you into all truth get under the blood and all the rest will come into Focus that's the way I believe it I believe if we ever get under the blood it takes you out from living under the law but see I heard a sermon one time and it was just wonderful it wasn't brother Branham but this brother had preached on the law versus Grace and he took it down through the Bible and and because you know you think of a person that wears a long skirt you know a lady that's wearing a long skirt and a long hair you think all that that's a legalist think about it we think that's legalist no legally you think well I've got to write because America will let me get away with wearing this I can do what I want because legally I can push the limits that's living under the law living under grace makes you want to dress like a lady see it's not something you have to do it's something you want to do a man the reason he doesn't go out here and get all tatted up and you know and and wear earrings and and look like some weird freak the reason he doesn't do that is because of the sacrifice and he's living under grace see we the world has twisted our minds to think that if you want to be free you got to act like the world they are still living under the law they have to go through the Judgment we don't have to go through the judgments we have already been judged by the lamb and he was perfect how can we go to hell if we've already been judged perfect before God think about it you can't be lost that's why I believe that if you've ever been saved you can't be lost so the Bible to say one saved always say but you can do what you want because you've been saved so you can smoke now because you've already been saved okay but if you were really saved the worshiper once purged has no more desire to what that's right the worshiper once purged has no more desire once not time not year after year I'm going to come back and and confess my sins this year and next year maybe every Easter um I'll make a new start I used to do that by the way I used to do that when I was a teenager 12 13 14 years old and I started seeking the Holy Ghost a little bit here and there every Youth Camp you know start feeling like I want to be like the other kids I you know we didn't go to message youth camps we went to uh Church of God Holiness Youth Camp so it wasn't called the Holy Ghost there forget the term now but anyway we would seek what they had what they wanted us to get right he always wanted to be like who you was around you and nobody nobody else just me okay we always wanted to be like whoever we were as around you know the best preacher you wanted to hang out with them the best singers you wanted to sing with them and uh you know best musicians you wanted to go stay in here then but you wanted to sneak out while the other ones were saying that's just the way you know I was that way maybe I was carnal I'm sure I was wasn't even saved yet as far as I know but there came a time every year around Easter I would always get to feeling bad I always felt lost anybody ever felt that way you get you go to church and you feel condemned every time we would go to a meeting at Labor Day meetings every year and I usually would have an experience around Easter and it didn't hold me very long it hold me for a month or two and then I'd go to these meetings around Labor Day and I would always feel guilty because if I heard anything about what I was doing I thought oh I'm going to hell I had no understanding that if I ever really got saved that yes I may have failed I made a mistake but I wasn't lost I was still living in my mind I was living under the law was it a lack of teaching I don't know what it was was in my mind I had never had it settled with God that what he did once was enough for me what he did once would hold me not just to the next Revival not just to the next Youth Camp not just to the next good service but it would hold me until the day of my Redemption you talk about a Salvation it'll change you from the thinking that you have right it'll change you from who you were it'll make you different yeah and brother Brandon was talking about he goes on about this about the the worshiper he said the blood made a covering but it could not perfectly atone for the man left the building with the same desire he says that twice the same desire to sin as he had in the first place brother Brandon goes on down and he says he predestinated a church to meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle now listen to this if God requires a church without spot or wrinkle he had to have something to make it that way I love that I love it if he requires a church to be holy that he has to provide a way for you to be holy If he if he has something in his mind of of a bride that is going to be coming and we are going to be The Virtuous a virtuous spotless sinless bride of Jesus Christ there has to be a way to attain that level of perfection but see don't ever think you can achieve it in the flesh because you'll fight that battle every day every single day every single time you come to church I'm not good enough to be here I'm not good enough to worship I can't sing I can't raise my hands I can't be free why because you're living under the law but if you just come out from under that for a minute and look to Calvary that should have been you but he did it once for you and because he did it once that worshiper now you the worshiper me the worshiper because he died you could be alive and a living worshiper clean and spotless before God because remember when God looks at the blood he never sees one sin you ever did think about it he can see everything he knows everything and he can't see your sin I remember brother Brandon might have said this or maybe it was a testimony I have I don't have it in front of me but he had said something about don't come in the prayer line brother Braham talks about don't come in the prayer line with unconfessed sins you've heard him say that he said don't come in the prayer lines with unconfessed sins because he said he said the holy spirit will pick that up and of course you don't want him standing there in front of a microphone telling the whole world what you did what's I mean that you know some some may have had big sins little sins they were all Sinners just get that let's get that out there too right it doesn't matter how big or little your sin was if it was sin it was sin and you did it because you really didn't believe in the atonement all sin is unbelief brother Branham said because you don't really believe in the fact that he died for you you've doubted a little bit or maybe your flesh made you doubt a little bit maybe you got down and out and you doubted a little bit maybe you sinned but all you have to do is and it's so simple that maybe it sounds a little bit like Baptist Doctrine but it's not it's actually Bible and message brother Brandon said all you have to do is repent that's it you don't have to wait for the clouds to open you don't have to wait for a great big listen don't take this wrong I believe in shouting I believe in running I believe in all those things if the Lord moves you to do that but you don't have to wait for that well I didn't run yet I haven't shouted I haven't spoke with tongue so I must not have been forgiven that's the devil telling you that that's the devil telling you well you're you're not really spiritual enough to be forgiven I don't care how spiritually you are if you've accepted the blood I've repented in my sins I've accepted the blood of Christ I am therefore clean anybody that accuses me now that's on them if I've made it right between me and God and I've went maybe to the people I've hurt and you do have to sometimes go to people because you hurt people you have to do that it's good to confess and and you know confess your wrongs that's it's hard to do but it needs to be done sometimes right but I will say this you once you get the channel clear between you and God I don't care if you have an emotional experience or not it's settled right then I don't care if you shout you may sit there just like you've said every service but think about it if your heart is clear before God there is therefore now no condemnation because you're not walking after the flesh anymore but you're walking after the spirit I'm thankful for that brother Bram tells the story I don't have time to to tell the I've got so many now I told you Stuart I had a bunch I really do I got way too much I'll just go way down here I'm gonna go way down here I'm about out of time I got seven minutes left and it may be over time brother Brown tells a story I'm not going to read it for safe to save time brother Brandon is is in Ohio I believe and I've got it on here but I just won't read it I'll just go through the streets in Ohio and he was actually eating he's holding some meetings so he would usually go to This Little Dutch restaurant where he had such nice waitresses and so forth but they were closed on Sunday so he went down to this other little restaurant you've heard the story so you know where I'm going with this brother Brandon Walks in there and right and uh he looks in there and he sees this woman I believe he said she had purple fingernails purple toenails short hair dyed blue I think is what he says yeah I mean this this is this is a real picture of modern America right but this is back in the 50s and uh and so he's talking about this woman you know he said she's sitting in the booth and she's got the two men sitting there with her and he said they're drunk one of them he said it's middle of summer and one of them's wearing a big old army coat he said he looked in there and in his heart he condemned him you know we do that too I mean it's kind of the human nature you say well I'm better than the prophet I don't condemn nobody well I'm not a lot of times we'll look at the bum walking down and we we condemn them should we do that no but we do it's a human part of it coming out but brother Brandon looks in there and he said the Holy Spirit I believe this is how he says it I could be wrong you can go back and listen to it kind of pulled him back behind the door and he showed him a view of the world and around the world was a crimson red around the world and then he showed him his own sins think about it here's a prophet who didn't drink didn't smoke the Lord told him not to defile his body in any way this guy this guy is pretty Perfect by our standards but he knew he was a sinner and God showed him he said the sins that I did as a child think about it God ever bring back to you remembered sometimes you condemn somebody and you start thinking man I I've been pretty bad myself I've done some pretty stupid stuff in my life you know brother Harold we've all done some crazy stuff right and so God had showed brother Branham his own sins so now you're going to watch a prophet standing there first condemning and then the Holy Spirit deals with him the way he does with us too it's not just for the prophet it's for you too the holy spirit's dealing with him showing him his own sins and then he shows him that the whole world would be destroyed if it was not for this Blood that wrapped around the whole entire world think about it and brother Brandon said it was like a bumper on a car he said and that blood acted as that bumper he said then the next thing it moved to compassion and so brother Branham actually goes in and he talks to the woman you know the story he talks to the woman and he tells her I first off she says oh sit down you know and I guess the two guys get up and leave and so he he starts talking to her and he comes to find out this woman had I believe she'd either been a Sunday school teacher or her parents had been in church and at one point in life she'd been a pretty good pretty good girl and here she was in this condition see this is what happens when you live under the law you can just never get ahead you can never if you're under the law you're condemned for the rest of your life because there's no way out or so you think and so brother Brandon starts talking to her and then she didn't know who he was and then she realizes something she says oh are you Mr Branham or Reverend Branham one of the whatever how she however she's called him he said yes ma'am and she said oh I'm ashamed of myself now this woman had gotten the presence of God now not calling brother Branham God but the spirit of God was there no doubt he had felt led to walk over there by the spirit of God and now he's standing there talking to this woman and she started feeling ashamed and started testifying or telling telling him her past and how guilty she was that's what a sinner will do they'll tell you how bad they've been there well I can't go to church because they judge me you know because they want me to act like them and I can't live like that well no you can't not not on your own and brothers talking to this woman and the next thing you know he said word he said she's down on her knees and he said we're down there praying and he said he said she's now serving the lord today but I want you to notice one thing about the story it goes from a man walking in seeing the condition of the sinner and immediately he's looking at her with the with with eyes of of condemnation and then once the Holy Spirit comes upon him he doesn't look at her anymore through condemnation but it's a sinner that could come back to God we were in the same boat we were sitting there and God was looking at you and he said I can't stand your sin I can't stand to see a sinner in my sight you cannot stand in my presence and be that filthy human being that you are and then all of a sudden Jesus stood up and he steps in between the sinner and the prosecutor and God no longer sees the sinner but he sees the perfect sinless spotless blood of Jesus Christ he can no longer see your sin tonight I want you to think about what happened that day on Calvary it changed your Eternal destination it changed who you are it changed where you were going you were everyone I was going to a sinner's grave and going straight to hell but God rich in Mercy he sent his very own son he said you don't deserve this but he said I'm going to give you the very best the lamb won't work forever but here is perfection so that you too can be perfected oh I think somebody ought to get excited about that right now you couldn't be perfect but now he can't see you no more he's looking at you Brother David he doesn't see your family history he doesn't see who you were but he sees God in you he says I can see you you are now expressions of Christ [Music] when I saw this I got to thank him my goodness he can't even see me he don't even see what I've been he can't even see me as a human anymore he can't see I I failed oh I failed God I feel so miserable why he can't see it no more if you'll confess it to God he is faithful and just to forgive you those Sins not because he wants to but because he loved you so much that he has already sent a perfect sacrifice not something you have to do every year not something you have to do every time you feel bad now something just during the Easter season I enjoy reflecting on these things during Easter sometimes it'll bring me back a little bit kind of focus me you know sometimes you have to think a little more serious about things when it comes to your family when it comes to your life and what have you been doing what do you you know how have you been living sometimes you have to step back look at what he did for you but don't feel condemned because of what you did you can't change that but he can you can't change who you were you can't change the mistakes you made yesterday you can't change the mistakes you made today but if you've confessed them to God he can't see him no more just in closing you've heard the old story musicians go ahead and come you've heard the story about the man that was in his the old man in his house and and uh I believe it was his daughter was going to have a tea party or something and uh and so he said she said go upstairs or something you know and didn't want to give him his Bible because he'd shout when he got to reading the word of God and how he saw you know the blood was covering his sins and all these things and so she gave him a book of maybe it was geography or something you know I don't I didn't go to school I don't know what it was about but put him up in the attic and she put him up there in the Attic where he wouldn't make no noise and then he got to reading this book and the next thing you know they're all sitting down there having their little tea party and he starts shouting think about it over a geography book because in there he saw that there was a place in the sea where there was no bottom they couldn't find the bottom of it right and then he remembered that's where my sins are God can't even find them no more because I am not able to make it on my own but God who is rich in Mercy became a man so that I could become one with God himself and when he sees me amen he no longer sees Joel Pruitt he no longer sees Bill Curtis he no longer sees Isaac he don't see any of you like that anymore you're just a sinner saved by grace you're just a sinner every one of us we're just sinners so I tried to point fingers because if I do I'm pointing back at myself too I'm just a sinner in the eyes of a just God but in the eyes of him now that I've accepted the blood he sees nothing nothing because brother Brandon said he said here we are red like sin red red is a sign of sin so he says you have red over here that sin he said and then you have a just God over here and he says what happened was he said that red blood come down between you and God he said in red through red so the red over here you threw that red blood looks White so you're still the same old red blooded sinner you ever were your blood has no salvation in it right but there is a sacrifice that's been made and because of that Brothers we don't have to take a back seat to nobody you're going to fall again and again but a Christian that's accepted the atonement they'll get back up and keep going that's what that's the difference living under that law you had to do that every year think about it you had to live for 12 months before you killed your next lamb and you had to feel that condemnation all year long don't be that way don't say well there's a meeting coming up in July and I'm going to get a refilling of the Holy Ghost I'm gonna I'm gonna be a better Christian after those meetings don't wait if you feel guilty about something just confess it to God and right then and there it's settled I don't care if it's a church I don't care if it's in your home I don't care if it's in your car driving wherever it is settle it between you and God there and just let that thing go and you can live happy and rejoicing all the days of your life because sin is no longer sitting there telling you you can't go to heaven because you're no good well you know that's right you're no good I'm no good but devil you're looking at me but you ought to see the sacrifice that's been made for me and he went down into hell and he took those book Cutters and he cut the locks off us off of all those bars that were holding us back and he and he said you know what you can be free and devil might have tried to put you into that jail cell but remember we got a pretty good lawyer and he's going to set you free why because he always wins every case he never lets anybody go to prison he always brings you out puts you over here and says you know what you're free you're not even on probation you're on free moral agency do whatever you want because you know you love me you aren't going to go out and just willfully sin the center once purged has no more desire and that's what I want to be tonight I know that's what you want to be I'm over time I apologize let's stay under our feet he became me can we do that one what you're thankful he became us so that we could become same as Jesus you think think about this just for a second he's looking down at you and instead of seeing a bunch of sinners yes he knows every detail of your life but he doesn't see the sin anymore [Music] he's looking down at the center and all he sees is the living body of Jesus Christ that's what he sees that's maybe not what I see at times I'll sit in the seat of the scornful I may I may talk about somebody I shouldn't talk about I may say something I shouldn't say I may judge somebody that I shouldn't judge me and the human may make a mistake like that I fail I have to Die daily to this flesh but God no longer sees you as that person he sees you as The Virtuous sinless spotless Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he said if he's going to have a spotless church he had to make a way to do it and I'm so glad he did he made me just like he made his own son thankful for that tonight nothing I could do but I'm thankful for the blood of Jesus he became me so that I might become sing with all your hearts by grace [Music] so that I am [Music] so that I lie becoming I'll sing it again with all your hearts now aren't you thankful for that Grace I know that you need [Music] know that I'm not alive [Music] took my place I know that he took my place so that I threw his love good taking [Music] it and he became [Music] the G Mercy rewrote my life it was Mercy that we wrote mine don't you thankful for tonight God's mercy [Music] my life oh yes I should should have called it my soul cast out but Mercy ruled my life if you believe

give the Lord a hand of praise tonight aren't you thankful for the sacrifice that he gave me think about it on this Easter just one service on Sunday but remember this when you come to church on Sunday morning remember yes yes he didn't stay down because he wanted you to live he had to come up to life so that you could live too aren't you thankful for tonight because there's an empty grave yes sir and you can point to that and say devil you may say I'm dead and sin and trespasses but I can look to an empty grave and God didn't stay there he raised up so that I could raise up with it oh ain't God good to us had he been so good to us let's sing that ain't God good he's giving us so many blessings let's just sing this and then you'll be free to go remember brother Stewart's going to
