[48:03] we'll read Jeremiah 29 11. Jeremiah

[48:09] Jeremiah 29 11. good to see each and

[48:33] the presence of the Lord don't we amen
[48:35] God bless you this morning Jeremiah
[48:38] chapter 18 and verse 1.
[48:41] as we approach the word this morning
[48:44] the word which came to Jeremiah from the
[48:47] Lord saying
[48:48] arise and go down to The Potter's House
[48:51] and there I will cause thee to hear
[48:54] my words
[48:56] then I went down to The Potter's House
[48:58] and behold he wrought a work on the
[49:01] wheels
[49:02] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[49:05] marred in the hand of the Potter
[49:08] so he made it again another vessel
[49:12] has seemed good to the Potter
[49:15] to make it
[49:17] and then Jeremiah 29 11
[49:22] just a wonderful scripture that you all
[49:24] know well
[49:26] this for I know the thoughts that I
[49:28] think toward you saith the Lord
[49:30] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[49:34] to give you an expected end pray the
[49:37] Lord without his Blessing to the word
[49:39] you may be seated this morning
[49:42] sometimes life doesn't work out like you
[49:44] plan it
[49:46] someone dies a marriage fails you lose
[49:49] your dream job you're ruined financially
[49:52] no one ever wants those things you don't
[49:54] plan for those things
[49:57] it would be sadistic to plan for some of
[50:00] the things that have happened even in
[50:01] some of our own lives and yet
[50:04] we we experience those things and it
[50:07] seems like that when those things happen
[50:09] that our lives are turned upside down
[50:13] like you have no control anymore and
[50:16] really the control that we have over our
[50:18] lives is only an illusion anyway that
[50:22] really our lives are in the hands of An
[50:24] Almighty God of a creator that made us
[50:27] for a purpose and so God is going to
[50:30] show Jeremiah by taking him down to The
[50:33] Potter's House he's going to show him
[50:36] what he will do in in the lives of
[50:38] individuals but also in that time in the
[50:41] nation of Israel he's going to show him
[50:43] that they have less control over the
[50:46] outcome of the current situation than
[50:48] what they think they did he's going to
[50:51] show them that there there is a Potter
[50:52] and there is a wheel and there is clay
[50:55] and he's going to show them what their
[50:57] part is in that now as Jeremiah goes
[51:00] down to The Potter's House he's shown or
[51:02] he's there are three things that are
[51:04] pointed out to him to be able to see he
[51:07] sees that there's a Potter he sees that
[51:09] there is a wheel or Wheels he sees that
[51:12] there is a clay and it will work now we
[51:17] know that the Potter is god Jehovah God
[51:19] the almighty God the wheel is life or
[51:23] time if you can say it that way that's
[51:25] the wheel that that's what he works in
[51:27] works with and the clay is God's work or
[51:31] his people and so the Potter if we look
[51:34] at him for just a moment as we kind of
[51:36] want to background where I want to go
[51:38] this morning the Potter is completely in
[51:41] control of both the wheel and the clay
[51:45] right everything done to the clay
[51:48] listen to me this morning everything
[51:50] done to the clay is done by the Potter
[51:55] oh my
[51:56] and and so everything is done by him in
[51:59] Isaiah 45 and 7 he said I form the light
[52:05] God is asserting his power and his
[52:08] authority and his sovereignty over life
[52:10] situations
[52:12] here were the children of Israel they
[52:14] were going down into Babylon they were
[52:16] going to be taken away captive away from
[52:18] their land but God knew the only way to
[52:20] bring them to repentance was to cause
[52:22] them to go into a foreign land there
[52:25] would be much suffering there there
[52:26] would be much trouble there but it was
[52:28] the only way and God knowing that he
[52:31] wasn't reacting he already knew that
[52:33] they would do what they would do he knew
[52:35] they would serve other gods he knew they
[52:37] would leave the god of Abraham Isaac and
[52:39] Jacob and so what he did is he already
[52:42] prepared a Babylon for them to be taken
[52:44] captive by
[52:46] and when he prepared The Babylon for
[52:48] them to be captive by it was his will
[52:51] that they would go down there and
[52:53] actually be there and they didn't
[52:54] understand that and so Jeremiah is
[52:56] standing there preaching to them don't
[52:58] resist it go down to Babylon and they're
[53:00] saying why we'll put up a fight but they
[53:02] don't realize you can't fight against
[53:04] God he said I formed the light I create
[53:06] Darkness
[53:08] I make peace
[53:11] create evil
[53:13] now that's not saying that God's
[53:15] responsible for evil but he creates the
[53:18] substance out of which evil comes
[53:21] now think about it for a minute God
[53:23] created an angel named Lucifer that had
[53:27] the capability to fall and to go out of
[53:29] the economy of God he created him for a
[53:32] purpose now the purpose of Lucifer was
[53:35] to have a devil a Satan now but that to
[53:38] have an adversary he needed him for
[53:41] Redemption
[53:43] yet he would not be redeemed
[53:46] yes oh my not everything will be
[53:48] redeemed some things that are necessary
[53:50] for Redemption will not be redeemed are
[53:53] you with me this morning so he said I
[53:55] make peace and create evil I the Lord do
[53:58] all these things drop down you Heavens
[54:02] from above let the skies pour down
[54:05] righteousness let the Earth open let
[54:07] them bring forth salvation let
[54:09] righteousness spring up together I the
[54:12] Lord have created it
[54:14] notice he said woe unto him that
[54:16] striveth with his maker
[54:19] let the Potter strive with the postures
[54:21] of the Earth
[54:23] and he's saying it it's absurd it would
[54:25] be absurd for the for the pottery to say
[54:28] to the to the to the Potter
[54:32] right brother Riley makes Pottery and I
[54:35] don't think you've ever had the pottery
[54:36] speak back to you have you it's never
[54:39] sit there and said I want to be
[54:40] something different I I've got one of
[54:42] those mugs sitting in my in my kitchen
[54:44] that I drink coffee from I don't think
[54:46] the pottery has ever said well you know
[54:48] today I think I want to be a plate I'd
[54:50] rather be a plate rather than a mug and
[54:52] and it resists the wheel it's absurd for
[54:55] it because the pottery has no power over
[54:58] the potter the Potter is going to mold
[55:00] he's going to form the pottery into what
[55:03] he wants it to be oh my if we could just
[55:05] recognize this morning that we have no
[55:08] power over God all the only Power that
[55:10] we have is in a surrendered life
[55:13] yes oh my
[55:15] God so here that he said show the clay
[55:18] say to him that fashion is hit
[55:20] I want to be something different yeah
[55:23] what make us thou
[55:25] or thy Work
[55:27] he hath no hands
[55:29] in other words you made it
[55:32] with your hands and yet it would say to
[55:34] you well I have no you have no hands or
[55:37] you have no power no ability to make
[55:39] my life
[55:42] look at this again he is the Potter and
[55:46] no detail escapes him
[55:48] huh
[55:50] in Matthew 10 29 it says are not Two
[55:52] Sparrows sold for a farthing one of them
[55:55] shall not fall on the ground without
[55:56] your father
[55:58] in other words he's got all the birds
[55:59] counted and accounted for
[56:02] yes he said but the very hairs of your
[56:04] head are all numbered
[56:07] some of us said praise God
[56:11] the hairs of your head are all numbered
[56:15] and some of us that's not a very
[56:17] difficult job but for some it would be
[56:19] but he don't only number the ones that
[56:22] are there
[56:23] but he numbers the ones that you lost
[56:27] all right
[56:28] a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground
[56:30] he's infinite God
[56:33] you know there's an estimated I don't
[56:34] know how they come up with this number
[56:36] but it's a big number they estimate
[56:38] there's 10 quintillion bugs on the Earth
[56:43] ten quintillion bugs now think about
[56:46] that number for a minute that's a 10
[56:48] with 19 zeros after it
[56:51] or one rather with 19 zeros after it
[56:54] that's a lot of bugs
[56:57] that's why it's so hard to get rid of
[56:58] them
[56:59] and I killed a mosquito last night it's
[57:02] already been freezing weather and
[57:03] everything else and the bugs are still
[57:05] out there just because there's so many
[57:07] of them
[57:08] so many bugs listen what brother Branham
[57:11] says about this he said God the infinite
[57:13] God who made the earth and the heavens
[57:16] and knew all things and knew it before
[57:18] the world was ever formed every flea
[57:23] every fly
[57:25] I can't even count the ones that come
[57:27] when we barbecue
[57:30] hahaha
[57:31] during the summer if you open a window
[57:33] you can't even count the ones in your
[57:34] house
[57:35] you thought you got them all out of the
[57:37] car and they're not either there'd still
[57:39] be some left in the car but he knows
[57:41] everyone in the world
[57:45] every Fleet every fly every Nat
[57:50] if you've ever stood out here during
[57:52] certain times of the year you know that
[57:54] the gnats are in such abundance and and
[57:56] they fly and they kind of hover around
[57:57] your head he knows every one of them and
[58:01] also every detail of their life going
[58:04] back for a long time
[58:07] right if you get uncomfortable this
[58:09] morning if you get warm you deacons
[58:10] might have to watch that these units
[58:12] were on uh on heat so we might have to
[58:14] turn them to cool if you haven't already
[58:16] done that maybe you all aren't warm this
[58:18] morning we get up and start moving we
[58:19] would be you know
[58:21] but you live by his word how many
[58:23] believe that this morning
[58:25] you live by the word of the man who
[58:27] knows everything about everything and
[58:29] every gnat and every flea and every fly
[58:31] and everything else you live by his word
[58:33] aren't you glad don't you realize how
[58:35] important it is if he said I'm going to
[58:37] make it I'm going to make it because he
[58:38] knows every fly he knows brother Madam
[58:40] puts it this way he said he knows every
[58:42] flea he said how many times it would bat
[58:44] its eye
[58:45] right he knows everything about
[58:47] everything and if he's able to do that
[58:49] then if he said for me to live a certain
[58:52] way or to do a certain thing Lord that's
[58:54] what I want to do that's the way I want
[58:56] to live that's the world I want my life
[58:57] to be because you know the intimate
[58:59] details of my life and I cannot plan
[59:02] better than you can plan I cannot dress
[59:04] better than you can dress me I cannot
[59:06] live better than you can live through me
[59:08] I cannot walk better than you can walk
[59:10] through me are you hearing me this
[59:12] morning I can't love people better than
[59:14] you can love through me that's right oh
[59:17] my we live by his word he knows
[59:19] everything about our our situation in
[59:22] life he knows and he cares
[59:25] oh my
[59:27] in Matthew 6 25 he said therefore I say
[59:29] unto you take no thought for your life
[59:31] what you shall eat or what you shall
[59:33] drink nor yet for your body what you
[59:34] shall put on it's not the life more than
[59:36] me and the body then Raymond behold the
[59:39] fowls of the air they sow not neither do
[59:42] they read nor gather into barns yet your
[59:44] heavenly father feedeth them are you not
[59:46] much better than they which of You by
[59:49] taking thought can add one cubit to his
[59:51] stature why take your thoughts for
[59:53] Raymond consider the lilies of the field
[59:55] how they grow they toil not neither do
[59:57] they spin yet I say unto you that even
[59:59] Solomon in all his glory well it's not
[1:00:01] already like one of these wherefore if
[1:00:04] God so clothed the grass of the field
[1:00:05] which today isn't tomorrow is cast into
[1:00:07] the oven shall he not much more clothe
[1:00:09] ye You O ye of little faith
[1:00:13] oh my that's the Potter
[1:00:16] he sees him you walk into The Potter's
[1:00:19] House
[1:00:21] Potter's House he has control over
[1:00:22] everything else it belongs to him
[1:00:26] he walked into The Potter's House and he
[1:00:29] sees Wheels
[1:00:32] now
[1:00:33] it was actually two wheels
[1:00:36] and if we look at the wheel as our life
[1:00:38] or our span of our life
[1:00:40] that were were being turned
[1:00:43] by life's circumstances and by the
[1:00:45] things that we go through
[1:00:47] and that wheel turns at the speed
[1:00:49] directed by the Potter
[1:00:52] depending on what he's making and what
[1:00:55] he wants to do with the pottery at that
[1:00:58] specific time and brother Riley is going
[1:01:00] to probably correct me after church but
[1:01:02] about these things but I looked into
[1:01:04] ancient pottery making and I began to
[1:01:07] look at that and I found that they
[1:01:09] actually had two wheels and there was a
[1:01:11] big wheel and a smaller wheel and then
[1:01:13] just a rod that went up between them and
[1:01:16] so it was an early axle in fact the
[1:01:17] first wheel that was invented was the
[1:01:20] pottery wheel before they had a wheel
[1:01:22] for a chariot or anything like that they
[1:01:24] had a pottery wheel it was to make
[1:01:25] pottery and so there was a a wheel and
[1:01:29] and it was but it was not a wheel it
[1:01:31] would move smoothly like a will maybe
[1:01:33] would today but the wheel would actually
[1:01:35] be unbalanced and it would be that way
[1:01:37] on purpose it wasn't sitting on the
[1:01:39] ground it was actually unbalanced it
[1:01:41] would move like this it wobbled as it
[1:01:43] moved and there was a purpose in that
[1:01:45] because it would actually keep the wheel
[1:01:48] turning if it if it wobbled as it moved
[1:01:51] it was a little bit unbalanced so it was
[1:01:53] unbalanced and we find that life is the
[1:01:55] same way our life is not perfectly
[1:01:57] balanced you'll find times in your life
[1:01:59] there will be happiness at times in your
[1:02:01] life there will be Joy at times in your
[1:02:03] life you'll feel like you're on top of
[1:02:04] the world how many have been there you
[1:02:06] feel like everything's going right and
[1:02:08] then there's times when you feel low
[1:02:09] there's times you feel like nothing can
[1:02:11] help you there's times you feel like
[1:02:13] everything's against you and you feel
[1:02:15] like you've lost everything but remember
[1:02:16] the wheels keeps turning
[1:02:18] right it keeps turning and it keeps
[1:02:21] moving as it turns to the Ebbs and flows
[1:02:23] of life and so we find that that's it's
[1:02:25] just a law of God that when we live on
[1:02:28] this Earth that there's a good and an
[1:02:30] evil and Paul put it this way he said I
[1:02:32] find a law when I would do good evil is
[1:02:34] present and so he said we would know it
[1:02:36] today it's the law of contrast whether
[1:02:38] it's good there is evil where there is
[1:02:40] right there is wrong and we will never
[1:02:42] no matter listen no matter what our
[1:02:44] environment may be ever be able to shake
[1:02:47] ourselves from the presence of either
[1:02:49] the truth we've got to learn to deal
[1:02:52] with it running never helps it doesn't
[1:02:54] help to run from our problems it doesn't
[1:02:57] help to uh to uh to just try to forget
[1:03:00] about it or try to drown it in alcohol
[1:03:02] or drugs or something else you got to
[1:03:04] deal with it why because it's always
[1:03:06] going to be there if you don't deal with
[1:03:09] it today you deal with it tomorrow if
[1:03:11] you don't deal in your lifetime your
[1:03:12] children will deal with it tomorrow
[1:03:15] so because when you would do good evil
[1:03:17] is present
[1:03:18] he said it's the law of contrast
[1:03:21] and so now in Psalms 126 6 it tells us
[1:03:25] that he that goeth forth and weaveth
[1:03:27] this is the law of contrast there will
[1:03:29] be seasons of your life when there is
[1:03:31] much carefulness and there's weeping and
[1:03:33] there's trouble but that's just that's
[1:03:35] actually the season of sowing now you
[1:03:38] would think oh my you would think the
[1:03:40] season of sowing would be a season of
[1:03:42] rejoicing but it's not the season of
[1:03:44] sowing is a very difficult season
[1:03:46] the season of sowing is a season of
[1:03:48] weeping because you're bearing precious
[1:03:51] seed and you know once you commit the
[1:03:54] seed to the ground a farmer that lives
[1:03:55] by his crop knows that when he commits
[1:03:57] the seed to the ground if it doesn't
[1:03:59] grow he's ruined
[1:04:01] right you're you're committing it to the
[1:04:03] ground and you can't go out excuse me
[1:04:06] and dig it up every day
[1:04:07] and try to see if it's growing or not
[1:04:10] right you got to trust the ground
[1:04:12] and Trust the preparation
[1:04:15] glory to God you've got to trust that
[1:04:18] the farmer knew what he was doing that
[1:04:20] the morning around the plow knew what he
[1:04:21] was doing are you hearing me today you
[1:04:23] got to trust God that he knew what he
[1:04:25] was doing by putting you here on the
[1:04:27] earth he knew by putting you here he
[1:04:28] said but I'm facing an insurmountable
[1:04:30] obstacle but as you walk through the
[1:04:32] season of weeping you realize he's the
[1:04:35] one who put the circumstances in place
[1:04:37] to allow you to sow
[1:04:39] so you you sow in tears
[1:04:42] but it says he that goeth forth and
[1:04:45] weeping bearing precious seed shall
[1:04:49] doubtless come again with rejoicing
[1:04:53] walking across the same ground but now
[1:04:55] it's harvest time now the seeds that
[1:04:58] have been sowed during those hard times
[1:05:00] the seeds that have been sowed when it
[1:05:02] was difficult to go to church the seeds
[1:05:04] that have been sown when there was
[1:05:04] conflict the seeds that have been so
[1:05:06] mine the seeds that have been sown when
[1:05:08] there was trouble those seeds he's going
[1:05:10] to come back one day walking across that
[1:05:12] same ground bearing precious seeds oh
[1:05:15] listen to me if you're struggling today
[1:05:17] if you're working if you're if you find
[1:05:19] it hard sometimes then you just got to
[1:05:21] put One Foot In Front Of Another
[1:05:22] remember the same ground that you're
[1:05:24] walking across as you sow will be the
[1:05:26] same ground that you walk across going
[1:05:27] the other direction when you're reaping
[1:05:29] one day
[1:05:31] don't give up don't give in to the devil
[1:05:34] don't let him talk you out of church
[1:05:35] don't let him talk you out of the things
[1:05:37] of God remember he that goeth forth
[1:05:39] weeping will come again rejoicing
[1:05:42] to be the Bible says it was true and the
[1:05:45] scriptures are the word of God
[1:05:47] we think only endures the Bible says for
[1:05:50] the night
[1:05:51] but joy comes
[1:05:53] in the morning
[1:05:55] thirdly he sees the clay
[1:05:58] watch as we background we're continuing
[1:06:00] to background what we want to say
[1:06:02] the clay is made into a vessel
[1:06:05] but as it's being made
[1:06:07] it's marred
[1:06:09] in The Potter's hands
[1:06:14] I don't know about you but I identify
[1:06:15] with this
[1:06:17] clay
[1:06:21] if we could think back over our own
[1:06:23] lives
[1:06:24] the clay is marred
[1:06:27] in the hands of the Potter
[1:06:29] it doesn't it doesn't stand in the
[1:06:30] working
[1:06:32] got out of shape
[1:06:34] some gravel or small Stone got in it
[1:06:38] and it made a breach in the part where
[1:06:40] it was found
[1:06:42] so the Potter was obliged to take the
[1:06:45] clay
[1:06:46] turn it upside down
[1:06:49] mess it up
[1:06:51] still in the hands of the Potter
[1:06:54] but the clay had a flaw
[1:06:57] now notice the Potter did not make a
[1:06:59] mistake
[1:07:01] the fault was in the clay
[1:07:03] yeah
[1:07:04] right the fault was in the clay
[1:07:07] the Potter already knew that the fault
[1:07:10] was in the clay
[1:07:11] I love this but He Didn't Throw the Clay
[1:07:13] Away he doesn't reject the clay
[1:07:17] he actually picks the clay with the
[1:07:20] fault in it because he wants to express
[1:07:23] himself as a redeemer
[1:07:25] oh God so he actually picks the clay
[1:07:28] that has a gravel in it or a stone in it
[1:07:32] or or sand in it because he wants he
[1:07:34] doesn't go buy it down with the Hobby
[1:07:36] Lobby he doesn't go buy perfect clay
[1:07:38] that's got everything the right to be
[1:07:39] tested in the right materials but he
[1:07:41] actually finds the clay from the earth
[1:07:43] and he picks the clay specifically
[1:07:45] because of the flaw oh I hope you hear
[1:07:48] me this morning and he wants because he
[1:07:50] knows that that flaw maybe it won't
[1:07:52] allow him to make the original vessel
[1:07:54] but his in his mind he's not thinking
[1:07:56] about the first vessel he's thinking
[1:07:58] about the second vessel he's not
[1:08:00] thinking about the first book the old
[1:08:01] book but he's thinking about the new
[1:08:03] book He's thinking oh my and so what
[1:08:06] he's doing he's going to take purposely
[1:08:07] pick up the clay that's got a fault in
[1:08:09] him and then he's not going to leave the
[1:08:11] fault in the claim because that's where
[1:08:13] many denominational people today will
[1:08:15] say well I got a fault I got these
[1:08:16] things in my life and I'll just leave
[1:08:18] him there that's not what the Potter
[1:08:19] does he's a good Potter he's not going
[1:08:21] to make a vessel it's all marred and
[1:08:23] disfigured and you can't use it for
[1:08:25] nothing but he makes a vessel defusable
[1:08:27] he makes a vegetable a vessel that'll
[1:08:29] that'll be worthy he makes a good vessel
[1:08:31] out of the clay so what does he do he
[1:08:33] takes it in his hands
[1:08:35] and Mars it
[1:08:40] now in God's original baking
[1:08:43] man was perfect
[1:08:45] except there was a rock in the clay now
[1:08:47] what was it
[1:08:49] think about it
[1:08:51] it was free will
[1:08:56] I want you to understand this morning
[1:08:57] that Free Will is the problem not the
[1:08:59] solution
[1:09:02] you say well I chose this message
[1:09:05] I was looking for something and I chose
[1:09:07] this message well then you might
[1:09:09] unchoose it someday
[1:09:14] I chose the gospel I chose Christ I was
[1:09:17] looking for Christ and I chose him no
[1:09:19] you don't find anywhere in the New
[1:09:21] Testament where Jesus where the
[1:09:23] disciples chose Jesus
[1:09:26] but Jesus chose the disciples
[1:09:29] right so by the Free Will is actually
[1:09:32] the pebble or The Rock in the clay
[1:09:36] all you ever did all I ever did by Free
[1:09:39] Will is turn away from God
[1:09:43] all I ever did by my own free will is
[1:09:46] mess up
[1:09:48] are you hearing me today I got myself
[1:09:51] into bad situations by my own free will
[1:09:54] I didn't I didn't serve God by my own
[1:09:56] free will I I snuck around did things
[1:09:59] that were wrong find my own free will
[1:10:01] but one day the platter got a hold of me
[1:10:04] and when I was marred in his hands and I
[1:10:06] and he made something new out of me he
[1:10:08] made something that by his own free will
[1:10:10] amen by his will he made something in
[1:10:14] spite of myself
[1:10:16] yeah
[1:10:17] you hear me today you don't do nothing
[1:10:19] by free will
[1:10:21] that's right
[1:10:25] but I have a desire for God because God
[1:10:26] put it there
[1:10:28] oh you ought to thank God for that
[1:10:30] desire
[1:10:32] don't take it lightly
[1:10:34] the Bible says it's not of him that
[1:10:35] willeth or him that runeth but God that
[1:10:37] shows Mercy
[1:10:40] brother Brandon put it this way so
[1:10:41] beautifully he said when we were sinners
[1:10:43] alienated without God in the world
[1:10:47] in that muck of mud as I talked about
[1:10:49] this morning he was talking about the
[1:10:50] Lily now the seed was way down in the
[1:10:53] muck in the mire
[1:10:54] of the mud
[1:10:55] he said God come to us
[1:10:58] God sought you you never sought God no
[1:11:01] man can come to me except the father
[1:11:03] draws him first
[1:11:05] and God came down in that muck can't you
[1:11:09] see the mystery of the Incarnation of
[1:11:11] Christ in this you can see the mystery
[1:11:13] of God of the godhead God came down he
[1:11:16] condescended came down in that muck
[1:11:20] everything man did by Free Will was just
[1:11:23] a bunch of of mire and muck and it was
[1:11:26] just a bunch of mud it was just a bunch
[1:11:28] of Filth oh my all righteousness were
[1:11:30] like filthy rags man tried to live the
[1:11:32] law and they couldn't do it
[1:11:34] they could not keep the law and so they
[1:11:36] had to sacrifice goats and bowls and
[1:11:38] sheep and oxen to try to make up for the
[1:11:40] fact that they could not keep the law
[1:11:42] but there come a perfect one and he come
[1:11:44] down in that muck of mud he said that he
[1:11:47] taught us God came down in that muck
[1:11:50] what you were
[1:11:51] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:11:53] he said that ought to create a perfect
[1:11:55] love oh my I hope we have that perfect
[1:11:57] love for Christ today that ought to
[1:11:59] create a perfect love look what you was
[1:12:02] and look what you are you didn't become
[1:12:05] what you are you could be the most best
[1:12:07] Christian in here who want to serve God
[1:12:09] for the most years but you didn't become
[1:12:11] what you are because you've pulled
[1:12:13] yourself up by your bootstrap and set
[1:12:15] yourself up no you're a turtle sitting
[1:12:17] on a fence post you didn't get there by
[1:12:19] yourself you're there because God placed
[1:12:21] you there you're in the house of God
[1:12:23] this morning because God put you in the
[1:12:25] house of God he called for you to come
[1:12:28] he came down in the muck where you were
[1:12:30] quit resisting that call of God quit
[1:12:33] pulling against him he said don't Paul
[1:12:35] he said it's hard for you to kick
[1:12:36] against the pricks
[1:12:39] God came down
[1:12:42] oh my
[1:12:44] what did that
[1:12:46] somebody that loves you
[1:12:48] oh aren't you glad to have somebody that
[1:12:50] loves you today somebody that loves you
[1:12:53] he said can't you have faith in what
[1:12:54] he's promised you then he said real
[1:12:56] genuine love will create a confidence in
[1:12:59] his word
[1:13:01] oh man
[1:13:02] he said he caught me when I was nothing
[1:13:05] I'm still nothing
[1:13:08] but I'm in his hand
[1:13:11] see he caught me and he loved me when I
[1:13:14] was unlovable
[1:13:15] oh can't you see it this morning he
[1:13:18] loved me when I was unlovable he loved
[1:13:20] you and you was unlovable but he changed
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:24] oh my and he talks about the woman that
[1:13:26] come out and she testified she said I'm
[1:13:28] not what I should be I'm not what I want
[1:13:30] to be I'm not she she said I'm not to
[1:13:33] the place I want to be but I know this
[1:13:35] I'm not what I used to be
[1:13:37] I've been changed I've been reborn by
[1:13:39] the power of God
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:43] by the brown state of God when I was an
[1:13:45] alien from him so love me go get you
[1:13:48] feel that love this morning can't not
[1:13:50] can't you see it from the scripture so
[1:13:52] love me till he stoop down to get me and
[1:13:54] pick me up that gives me confidence that
[1:13:56] he wants to use me
[1:14:00] and put you where you are by accident
[1:14:02] your life may be turned upside down
[1:14:04] right now but look at what he's doing
[1:14:07] he don't want to leave you there
[1:14:10] take the opportunity
[1:14:13] of that upside down condition
[1:14:16] to say Lord how can I yield myself to
[1:14:18] you
[1:14:19] who am I
[1:14:21] now watch
[1:14:23] he said
[1:14:25] he said if he picked me up it gives me
[1:14:27] confidence he wants to use me he's got a
[1:14:29] purpose in doing it he's seen something
[1:14:31] in me
[1:14:33] he seen something in you
[1:14:36] he had a reason to save you look at the
[1:14:39] people that's unsaved today look at the
[1:14:41] millions he could have took beside you
[1:14:43] but he took you
[1:14:47] you drive by people every day who've
[1:14:49] never heard the message
[1:14:51] you you drive by churches that try to
[1:14:53] serve God and do everything that they
[1:14:54] know to do but they've never heard they
[1:14:56] don't know but you know why do you know
[1:14:58] why has it been revealed to you some of
[1:15:00] your own family members or people they
[1:15:02] just can't see it but you see it why
[1:15:04] because he showed you he wants you he
[1:15:07] wants you he that's his love to you he
[1:15:09] could have took many besides you but no
[1:15:11] one can take your place
[1:15:13] no one can take your place you're in
[1:15:15] God's economy no one can do it that's
[1:15:17] his love to you he's going to make a
[1:15:19] vessel out of you that he wants yes
[1:15:22] that's right
[1:15:24] because of your own free will yes
[1:15:27] yes he had to allow you to be broken
[1:15:30] so you could be made whole
[1:15:35] I know we don't like to hear that
[1:15:36] because we like the illusion of control
[1:15:39] I've preached on that before it's why
[1:15:41] people don't like to fly
[1:15:44] because the driving gives us the
[1:15:46] illusion of control
[1:15:48] but you're not in control
[1:15:50] a deer could jump out in front of you
[1:15:52] at any moment especially around here
[1:15:56] another car could come down the wrong
[1:15:58] lane
[1:15:59] it's by the grace of God that you're
[1:16:01] here this morning
[1:16:03] some of you barely escaped death by
[1:16:05] minutes and seconds and and you've been
[1:16:07] driving down the highway and some reason
[1:16:09] you got delayed or stopped and here come
[1:16:11] a car coming down the other direction
[1:16:12] you drive by a wreck or something and
[1:16:14] you don't realize the grace of God to
[1:16:16] you many things that you'll never even
[1:16:18] know about you could have drowned
[1:16:19] everybody could have been there could
[1:16:20] have been many things happen to you but
[1:16:22] you don't you don't even recognize and
[1:16:24] you sit here and say well God never did
[1:16:25] nothing for me here I am in this
[1:16:27] horrible topsy-turvy condition my life
[1:16:29] is turned upside down but can't you see
[1:16:31] what he's done for you by allowing you
[1:16:33] to stay on the wheel it means he has a
[1:16:36] use for you the reason you're still on
[1:16:37] the wheel don't give up don't let that
[1:16:40] devil of suicide get in your mind that
[1:16:42] devil of depression will try to come
[1:16:43] over and take over your life you're
[1:16:45] still on the wheel there's a reason for
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:48] yeah
[1:16:50] oh my
[1:16:52] god brother Branham tells us he said
[1:16:54] that's the way people today he said you
[1:16:55] don't like to get broke up see your own
[1:16:56] free will is what keeps us
[1:16:59] broken
[1:17:01] but you got to be broke up before you
[1:17:03] can be remade
[1:17:05] the prophet went down to The Potter's
[1:17:06] House to get broke up to get on the
[1:17:08] wheel and spun out something different
[1:17:11] if you're a sinner he said get on the
[1:17:12] wheel God will break you up mold you
[1:17:15] different shape your life up different
[1:17:16] shape your home life
[1:17:18] different
[1:17:20] you see it's it's so much better to have
[1:17:22] a broken Spirit than a broken life
[1:17:25] if God has to throw you on the wheel and
[1:17:27] toss you about he'll do that
[1:17:29] but it's so much better to have a broken
[1:17:31] spirit
[1:17:34] you'll have one or the other
[1:17:37] either we come to God in a broken and
[1:17:40] contrite spirit
[1:17:41] or if we're Gods we'll have a broken
[1:17:43] life
[1:17:44] because he is going to bring us to him
[1:17:48] oh my
[1:17:49] he and he already knows but he's going
[1:17:52] to bring us
[1:17:53] to him
[1:17:55] he said you know the prophet one time
[1:17:56] went down to The Potter's House to be
[1:17:57] broke up
[1:17:58] to be melded over if there's something
[1:18:01] wrong God don't just put a patch in
[1:18:03] anything he said you put a new piece in
[1:18:06] an old garment it'll make it worse than
[1:18:08] ever he said the thing to do is put the
[1:18:10] whole thing new so if you've done
[1:18:12] something wrong don't just get around a
[1:18:15] little and say well I'm sorry I did it I
[1:18:16] won't I'll try not do it again he said
[1:18:18] just break up yeah and get molded over
[1:18:22] again
[1:18:23] it's another piece see you can't hold on
[1:18:26] to part of the old and put it here with
[1:18:28] the new
[1:18:29] right now that that's true in doctrinal
[1:18:30] things it's true in in life and just
[1:18:33] things that you're going through you
[1:18:34] can't hold on to your whole life and try
[1:18:36] to bring that into the gospel it just
[1:18:38] don't happen it'll never fit that'll
[1:18:40] Rend the Garment will ring because it's
[1:18:42] an old garment with a new patch right
[1:18:44] it's new wine and old bottles
[1:18:47] it just don't work together to put new
[1:18:49] wines you've got to get new wine you got
[1:18:51] to have new bottles
[1:18:52] and so you can't bring the old into the
[1:18:54] new you can't take the old system that
[1:18:57] failed you and try to recreate that old
[1:18:59] system over and over again that old
[1:19:01] system failed
[1:19:04] let me let me let me say that with all
[1:19:07] about the old system failed let's not
[1:19:09] recreate that again
[1:19:10] let's not do that again let's do what
[1:19:14] the word says this time
[1:19:16] the old way failed the old many of you
[1:19:18] come out of denominational some of you
[1:19:19] come out of message circles where they
[1:19:21] taught a certain things it failed for a
[1:19:23] reason
[1:19:24] right and the reason wasn't well it
[1:19:27] wasn't the right people running it you
[1:19:29] know that's what they say about
[1:19:30] socialism I don't mean to get into
[1:19:31] politics but it's just an illustration
[1:19:33] they say well socialism doesn't work
[1:19:34] because it's never been tried by the
[1:19:35] right people
[1:19:36] well who are the right people because
[1:19:38] everybody who's ever tried it has failed
[1:19:40] and it's not just failed but but it's
[1:19:42] miserably failed for socialism to work
[1:19:45] it'd have to be run by angels
[1:19:48] it could not be run by human beings
[1:19:51] because human beings want more power and
[1:19:54] they're going to get it if they get at
[1:19:56] the head of socialism it becomes
[1:19:57] communism it always will fail don't you
[1:20:00] see it's the same thing with doctrines
[1:20:02] around this message with things around
[1:20:04] this message you got to come out of that
[1:20:06] in order to come into something that
[1:20:07] works you need to reject that theology
[1:20:09] that idea you got to count it all wrong
[1:20:11] and Paul said I counted everything I
[1:20:14] knew was done
[1:20:15] you said but there were good things in
[1:20:17] there sure Paul studied the scriptures
[1:20:19] he studied and and things he could use
[1:20:21] but first he had to reject it all in
[1:20:23] order to take what God Said
[1:20:26] around so off a different person with it
[1:20:28] was in there at work it won't work
[1:20:29] because it's against the word
[1:20:35] but he wants to make you a new creature
[1:20:37] aren't you glad to be a new creature
[1:20:39] today too glad he still made you new he
[1:20:42] wants to make you a new creature he he
[1:20:44] remakes you he said therefore If any man
[1:20:46] be in Christ he is a new creature a new
[1:20:48] creation old things are passed away
[1:20:50] behold all things are become new
[1:20:54] you realize he remakes the Earth in the
[1:20:56] same way
[1:20:57] now look he the Earth is an attribute of
[1:20:59] God we've talked about it before but in
[1:21:01] that being that attribute of God the
[1:21:03] Earth actually it was in God's thoughts
[1:21:05] so he couldn't destroy it but he's going
[1:21:07] to make it new so John in Revelation
[1:21:09] sees new heavens and new earth in
[1:21:11] Revelation 21 and in verse 3 he says I
[1:21:13] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[1:21:15] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:21:17] he will dwell with them and they shall
[1:21:18] be his people God himself shall be with
[1:21:20] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[1:21:22] away all tears from their eyes there
[1:21:24] shall be no more death neither that
[1:21:26] don't sound like the world we're in at
[1:21:27] all
[1:21:28] but it's the same attribute yeah remade
[1:21:33] are you hearing me today it's the same
[1:21:35] attribute but in this attribute there's
[1:21:37] no more death and this attribute there's
[1:21:39] no more sorrow no crying neither shall
[1:21:41] there be any more pain for the former
[1:21:43] things are passed away but the brand
[1:21:44] called us he burns up the atmosphere of
[1:21:46] sin
[1:21:48] oh my that's what needs to happen in our
[1:21:50] lives by the way the atmosphere of sin
[1:21:52] needs to be burnt up so we can be made
[1:21:53] new
[1:21:55] oh my
[1:21:56] God there will be no crying there'll be
[1:21:59] no more pain for the former things are
[1:22:01] passed away
[1:22:04] in Revelation 21 5 he said he that set
[1:22:06] upon the throne the Potter
[1:22:09] in The Potter's House
[1:22:11] to behold I make all things new
[1:22:16] and the whole earth is spinning on his
[1:22:18] wheel and one day he says time is no
[1:22:21] more
[1:22:21] he breaks it
[1:22:24] and remakes it
[1:22:26] oh my
[1:22:28] the purpose
[1:22:30] of an upside down world yeah
[1:22:33] so he can remake it in Redemption
[1:22:36] I hope you hear me today the purpose of
[1:22:39] an upside down life it is not useless it
[1:22:42] is not purposeless he has a purpose for
[1:22:45] it so he can remake it
[1:22:50] Jesus when he come to this earth
[1:22:52] was always eating with Sinners and tax
[1:22:54] collectors
[1:22:55] it's like eating with Democrats
[1:22:59] to be my political sermon for the year
[1:23:03] foreign I'll say this there's a vote
[1:23:05] coming up if you know what you're doing
[1:23:06] vote if you don't don't
[1:23:10] that's my politics for the Year bless
[1:23:12] God
[1:23:14] it's like eating some of us we had to
[1:23:16] eat with Nancy Pelosi
[1:23:21] there'll be some things said at that
[1:23:23] table
[1:23:24] tax collectors
[1:23:27] Jesus ate dinner
[1:23:29] with tax collectors
[1:23:33] politicians
[1:23:35] worst kind of Sinner there is
[1:23:38] sinners
[1:23:47] too many broken people
[1:23:51] but the Potter can't do nothing with a
[1:23:53] vessel that's already been fired and
[1:23:55] made the way it is
[1:23:57] he needs one that's broken
[1:24:02] it's the purpose of your upside down
[1:24:04] life it's the Potter needed one that was
[1:24:06] broken the purpose of this upside down
[1:24:08] this upside down world that Jesus came
[1:24:11] into was so that Christ could make it
[1:24:13] new
[1:24:15] he was going to make New Creations out
[1:24:18] of these publicans
[1:24:19] out of these sinners
[1:24:23] and he told him he said they that are
[1:24:25] whole have no need of a physician but
[1:24:27] they that are sick I came not to call
[1:24:29] the righteous but Sinners to repentance
[1:24:35] one of those sinners
[1:24:37] and I just want to
[1:24:39] talk to you for a minute before we close
[1:24:40] one of those Sinners was a Samaritan
[1:24:42] woman we've heard a lot about her
[1:24:45] but now think about her in this context
[1:24:48] you talk about an upside down life
[1:24:54] first of all she was a Samaritan the
[1:24:57] Samaritans were a mixed-race people who
[1:25:00] the Jews had nothing to do with
[1:25:02] the Bible even she said why do you ask
[1:25:05] me a drink I'm a woman of Samaria for
[1:25:08] the Jews have no dealings with the
[1:25:10] Samaritans won't even speak to them
[1:25:12] the Jews considered them worse than the
[1:25:15] Gentiles
[1:25:16] because they were half Jew and half
[1:25:17] Gentile and they brought some Pagan
[1:25:19] things into their worship yes
[1:25:21] and and we we saw recently in second
[1:25:23] Kings chapter 17 where he talks about
[1:25:25] how the Samaritans come from the king of
[1:25:28] Assyria bringing uh repatriating people
[1:25:30] into the land so it'd be like uh well
[1:25:33] I'm on politics this morning it'd be
[1:25:35] like border uh the the people from
[1:25:37] another country coming across the border
[1:25:39] illegal immigrants coming in and
[1:25:41] settling in the land
[1:25:43] so the woman at the well was someone who
[1:25:47] the Jews felt like didn't have a right
[1:25:48] to be there
[1:25:50] and that's found in Second Kings 17 24
[1:25:52] that they placed them in the cities of
[1:25:54] Samaria instead of the children of
[1:25:55] Israel and they possessed Sumerian dwelt
[1:25:57] in the cities thereof and for these
[1:25:59] people were hated by the Jews
[1:26:01] brother Brown said the immoral woman
[1:26:02] that Jesus found up at sidecar she was a
[1:26:05] Samaritan
[1:26:06] which was rather an off-caste people
[1:26:08] that really believed God he said they
[1:26:10] was about half Jew and half Gentile and
[1:26:11] they were a race they believed in God
[1:26:13] and they were expecting a messiah and
[1:26:15] sometimes in a greater way than the Jews
[1:26:17] themselves were but this little immoral
[1:26:19] woman in her condition very marred by
[1:26:22] sin
[1:26:23] he said in one day oh God perhaps that
[1:26:27] got discouraged with all the traditions
[1:26:29] of the elders
[1:26:31] I wonder how many people we've
[1:26:32] discouraged from the message of the hour
[1:26:35] by the traditions of the elders pots and
[1:26:39] Kettles and Washings
[1:26:42] are you hearing me today pots and
[1:26:44] Kettles and what traditions of the
[1:26:45] elders discouraged by Pentecostal
[1:26:47] tradition discouraged by message
[1:26:49] tradition
[1:26:51] she got discouraged by that and she
[1:26:53] didn't go to church no more
[1:26:55] because she got discouraged because all
[1:26:57] she heard when she went to church was
[1:26:58] that this this group taught this pot
[1:27:00] needed to be washed and this group
[1:27:02] thought that that pot needed to be
[1:27:03] washed and this group taught to wash
[1:27:04] their hands at a certain time and this
[1:27:06] one taught something else but she never
[1:27:08] heard nothing that could change your
[1:27:10] life
[1:27:11] she never heard nothing of redemption oh
[1:27:13] my but there was a redeemer coming
[1:27:16] to God
[1:27:18] oh my who would be revealed by the
[1:27:20] revealing of the son of man
[1:27:21] this little immoral woman in her
[1:27:23] condition very marred by sin she gave up
[1:27:25] on the traditions of the Elder she went
[1:27:26] out one day to the same old Jacob's well
[1:27:28] and she was going to let down her bucket
[1:27:30] to get some water and she changed
[1:27:33] Springs
[1:27:34] you've got to change Springs change what
[1:27:36] you're drinking from you've been
[1:27:37] drinking out of that Old Spring that old
[1:27:39] that old tradition you've been drinking
[1:27:41] a little sinful water you need to change
[1:27:43] Springs today drink from the Water of
[1:27:45] Life he said oh how she can remember
[1:27:47] that there was one sitting there that
[1:27:49] said in him was living water
[1:27:51] he said what a thrill it was to her when
[1:27:53] that Living Well revealed her sins and
[1:27:55] told her where she was wrong and
[1:27:57] described what she had did to her and it
[1:27:59] put a message in her heart and set her
[1:28:01] on fire with the glory of God and into
[1:28:02] the City and to the men
[1:28:05] that's good and that brings us to the
[1:28:07] second thing that she had against her
[1:28:08] she was a woman
[1:28:11] in that day and age it wasn't something
[1:28:14] that people looked up to
[1:28:17] now we live in a topsy-turvy world where
[1:28:19] a woman has become the queen of the age
[1:28:22] but in that age the woman being a woman
[1:28:25] she
[1:28:26] nobody would listen to her
[1:28:28] but it didn't stop her
[1:28:31] but the Brandon said it wasn't really
[1:28:32] legal in that country
[1:28:34] for a woman to go through the streets
[1:28:36] especially a woman marked with
[1:28:38] immorality
[1:28:41] I mean we look hard on them
[1:28:44] but at the local prostitute come running
[1:28:46] down through Hardy
[1:28:49] the local ill-fained woman come running
[1:28:52] down through Hardy knocking on doors hey
[1:28:55] I found the message of the hour
[1:28:59] I found the truth
[1:29:03] I wonder what our response would be
[1:29:05] yeah well I'm glad you got help
[1:29:08] thank you
[1:29:10] see they needed the same help that she
[1:29:13] did
[1:29:15] if they wouldn't need it if they didn't
[1:29:16] need it there would have been no Market
[1:29:20] there have been no way for her to do
[1:29:21] what she did look he said
[1:29:24] he said in water he said I'm telling you
[1:29:27] he said a woman marked with immorality
[1:29:28] but I'm telling you she got cleansed and
[1:29:29] a drink of that fresh water he said you
[1:29:32] try to stop her it was like trying to
[1:29:33] put a fire around a house on fire real
[1:29:35] dry and high wind and dry weather was
[1:29:37] really blowing that Blaze and you
[1:29:39] couldn't stop her because she'd found
[1:29:41] something that was real her sins were
[1:29:44] revealed and when her sins and wrong was
[1:29:46] revealed she can remember tonight in
[1:29:48] glory she can remember there was a
[1:29:50] spring for her
[1:29:51] there was a place where all the Creeds
[1:29:53] and churches are you hearing me this
[1:29:55] morning there was a place where all the
[1:29:56] Creeds and churches had turned her down
[1:29:58] but yet she found an oasis she found a
[1:30:01] place oh my she found a place where
[1:30:03] there's someone who cared
[1:30:05] what a rejoicing and how we can Rejoice
[1:30:08] with her we who was bound oh how we
[1:30:11] ought to Rejoice today we who was bound
[1:30:13] down with Creeds that pulled us away
[1:30:14] from God we found a fountain filled with
[1:30:17] blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins there
[1:30:19] we lost all our starchy conditions if
[1:30:22] you're still in a starchy condition you
[1:30:24] need to find the fountain again
[1:30:26] there we lost all our starchy condition
[1:30:29] and we drank from The Fountain and
[1:30:31] refreshed
[1:30:33] oh my
[1:30:34] she was a sinner
[1:30:36] oh my what a
[1:30:39] what a terrible life
[1:30:42] Jesus said to her go call your husband
[1:30:45] he goes right to the root of the matter
[1:30:46] he doesn't skirt around it he wasn't
[1:30:47] seek or sensitive
[1:30:49] he wasn't trying to save her feelings
[1:30:52] he said go call your husband come hither
[1:30:55] a woman said
[1:30:57] I have no husband
[1:30:59] she said Jesus said to us well said I
[1:31:01] have no husband
[1:31:03] for thou Hast had five husbands
[1:31:05] and he whom thou now Hast is not thy
[1:31:07] husband
[1:31:09] in that said Stout truly
[1:31:12] brother Brandon said that little woman
[1:31:13] at the well she'd seen so much Scruples
[1:31:15] about all their religion
[1:31:19] God help us today
[1:31:21] she had seen so much Scruples about all
[1:31:23] their religions and churches
[1:31:26] you realize what we're doing when we
[1:31:27] fight amongst ourselves
[1:31:31] we're keeping the woman at the well out
[1:31:34] she ain't gonna come into a place where
[1:31:37] they're fighting and fussing amongst
[1:31:39] themselves
[1:31:42] in the field you just need to give it up
[1:31:44] you won't hear somebody preach because
[1:31:46] you had a problem with them 20 years ago
[1:31:47] you need to give that up let that go
[1:31:50] you don't go to a certain church because
[1:31:52] somebody didn't treat you right or maybe
[1:31:53] you won't come here get somebody and
[1:31:55] treat you right at somebody you need to
[1:31:56] just let that go people are people
[1:31:58] they're going to be people they're going
[1:31:59] to be human
[1:32:00] but wait we want to be have a loving
[1:32:02] church we want we want to be able to
[1:32:04] accept everyone that will come and want
[1:32:06] to be changed that wants to be changed
[1:32:08] but people are going to hurt you at some
[1:32:10] point you're going to get because we
[1:32:11] have a sticky nature but you need to
[1:32:13] come back and say I don't want the
[1:32:15] Scruples I want the well I want the
[1:32:17] water hey man I'm sick and tired of all
[1:32:20] the Theology and the Scruples she didn't
[1:32:22] go to none of it he said don't know but
[1:32:24] she was just as well off
[1:32:26] poor child was maybe by bad parents let
[1:32:29] out on the street and should become a
[1:32:30] prostitute he said let me tell you
[1:32:32] there's a lot of bad women we know that
[1:32:33] but you can't be a bad woman without
[1:32:35] being a bad man you know
[1:32:37] so there has to be somebody make her bad
[1:32:39] so sometimes them kids are turned out by
[1:32:41] a bad Mammy run out to bar rooms and
[1:32:43] everything
[1:32:45] so he was on his road to Jericho
[1:32:48] he has to go up by the way of Samaria he
[1:32:50] came to the city sidecar about 11
[1:32:52] o'clock or 12. he sent the disciples
[1:32:54] into the city to get some victuals
[1:32:56] well they were gone an ill-famed woman
[1:32:58] of the city came out maybe a pretty girl
[1:33:00] she had probably you know been turned
[1:33:01] out by her parents and everything and
[1:33:03] she had seen nothing in the church
[1:33:08] in church sometimes I think we're the
[1:33:10] ones that need to be at the altar
[1:33:12] God help me today
[1:33:14] I want in my life in spite of all the
[1:33:16] Scruples and things and being raised the
[1:33:18] way that I was in the church and and you
[1:33:21] know you're raised with a certain set of
[1:33:22] values and things but in spite of all
[1:33:24] that I I want the love of God to be able
[1:33:27] to shine
[1:33:29] she's seen nothing in the church
[1:33:31] and again that's not just forget that
[1:33:33] sales people you can do what you want to
[1:33:35] do not the love of God
[1:33:37] saying you had five husbands one you
[1:33:40] have now is not yours but if you'll come
[1:33:42] to the well
[1:33:44] I have water that if you drink you'll
[1:33:47] never thirst again
[1:33:49] or something real that you could have
[1:33:51] will take away that thirst
[1:33:53] you'd been turned out she'd seen nothing
[1:33:55] in the church so she made her living in
[1:33:56] a bad way by having too many husbands
[1:34:00] and and I think that the woman at the
[1:34:02] well is probably not an actual
[1:34:03] prostitute but she was a woman who
[1:34:05] jumped from one man to the other for
[1:34:07] their money
[1:34:08] or perhaps because she was mistreated or
[1:34:10] something else we don't know the story
[1:34:12] but based on what brother Brandon said
[1:34:13] it sounds like she was making a living
[1:34:16] by having too many husbands
[1:34:19] with all these things against her
[1:34:22] why would the Potter
[1:34:26] come all the way down from Glory
[1:34:30] and take time out of his short three and
[1:34:32] a half year Ministry to go out of his
[1:34:35] way
[1:34:36] and come sit by the well
[1:34:39] foreign
[1:34:40] it was no accident
[1:34:43] she was a vessel that by free will
[1:34:46] had gotten into trouble
[1:34:50] can you imagine her that morning
[1:34:52] they just come to my imagination as I
[1:34:55] was sitting studying these things and
[1:34:56] began to think if she was sitting there
[1:34:59] and you she was she was sitting there
[1:35:02] and she's getting ready to start her day
[1:35:03] it's hard when you when you suffer with
[1:35:06] those things you in depression because
[1:35:07] you can't get over some of the things
[1:35:09] that you've done I'm here to tell you
[1:35:11] we're all we've all done bad things
[1:35:14] but many times that's the depression
[1:35:16] comes over us and you get in a place
[1:35:18] where you can't just hardly get up
[1:35:19] especially when you don't feel like
[1:35:20] there's any forgiveness or there's no
[1:35:22] hope and and so she got up that morning
[1:35:24] maybe late
[1:35:25] she gets up and she goes into her room
[1:35:27] and and she looks at the mirror maybe a
[1:35:29] cracked mirror hanging on the wall and
[1:35:31] she looks into it and she tries to wash
[1:35:33] herself up the best she can and she has
[1:35:36] to wait because she can't go to the well
[1:35:38] at the same time everybody else does
[1:35:40] so she says well I gotta hurry I could
[1:35:42] be there by noon because I don't want to
[1:35:43] go in the morning because some of them
[1:35:44] come in the morning I can't go in the
[1:35:46] afternoon because some of them come in
[1:35:47] the afternoon so it was her every
[1:35:49] intention to stay away from church
[1:35:51] all right
[1:35:54] she wanted so badly not to have to face
[1:35:56] anybody
[1:35:57] and so she wandered through the streets
[1:35:59] and she picks up her she said well I
[1:36:01] don't know how I'm going to make it but
[1:36:02] I guess I'll just put one foot in front
[1:36:03] of another
[1:36:05] she had gotten so discouraged in life
[1:36:07] she'd been married five times she'd been
[1:36:09] through five divorces
[1:36:12] she'd been through five divorces and so
[1:36:15] the six times she didn't even bother
[1:36:17] getting married
[1:36:19] she'd gotten into so much trouble
[1:36:22] that maybe she felt like that morning
[1:36:24] well there's no point yeah might as well
[1:36:27] give up I don't know who I'm preaching
[1:36:28] to this morning
[1:36:29] but you might as well give up you you
[1:36:31] just you just can't make it you can't do
[1:36:34] it
[1:36:35] but she said well today
[1:36:37] one more time
[1:36:38] I'll go to the well
[1:36:41] one more time I'll put One Foot In Front
[1:36:44] Of Another
[1:36:46] placed herself on the Wheel
[1:36:49] I'm being spun on this wheel I'm turned
[1:36:52] upside down I don't have any hope I
[1:36:54] don't have a future
[1:36:55] one more time I'm gonna put myself on
[1:36:57] the Wheel
[1:36:59] she walks towards
[1:37:01] the well where Jesus was sitting
[1:37:05] and when she got to the well
[1:37:08] oh God the wheel of her life it's funner
[1:37:12] right into the hands of the Potter
[1:37:16] who was there
[1:37:18] when she was marred
[1:37:23] you see what she didn't realize is that
[1:37:26] she had she was a fallen thought of God
[1:37:29] how many know brother random said that I
[1:37:31] could read you the quotes I was going to
[1:37:32] bring them all in but I don't have time
[1:37:33] she was a fallen attribute of God
[1:37:37] and because she was a fallen attribute
[1:37:39] of God we talked about it recently God
[1:37:40] had moved Heaven and Earth
[1:37:43] for that Nation to be there so that she
[1:37:46] could be there so that she could be
[1:37:48] saved because she fell from God's
[1:37:50] thoughts
[1:37:52] and so here she was and she's sitting
[1:37:54] there and she and and here comes this
[1:37:57] woman to her and that that wheel spun
[1:37:59] her around and here was one she didn't
[1:38:01] know he knew her
[1:38:02] so she acts real religious
[1:38:05] she argues with him about Doctrine
[1:38:09] God
[1:38:10] many times that's what people do they
[1:38:12] they hide behind a cloak of religion
[1:38:15] she had a religious spirit but really
[1:38:17] she needed help in another way
[1:38:21] and she hid behind that cloak of
[1:38:23] religion and she was hiding there said
[1:38:25] well you Jews don't treat us Samaritans
[1:38:26] right you're just a bunch of losers
[1:38:28] anyway you don't you don't even worship
[1:38:30] Pride or anything if Jesus said we know
[1:38:32] who we worship
[1:38:34] foreign
[1:38:35] why don't you call your husband and come
[1:38:36] here
[1:38:38] oh God
[1:38:43] I'm taking too much time on this but
[1:38:44] just bear with me
[1:38:45] he was calling for someone in authority
[1:38:49] over her
[1:38:52] to come and speak to him because she
[1:38:55] could not deal with him on the things
[1:38:56] she would deal with him on
[1:38:59] so he was calling for somebody who had
[1:39:01] Authority knowing that there was no one
[1:39:06] because the one she was with was not her
[1:39:08] husband
[1:39:09] glory to God
[1:39:11] and the old man has got to die how many
[1:39:13] believe that today
[1:39:15] you there's got to be a separation a
[1:39:18] divorce from your old husband I'm
[1:39:19] talking about the world now in order for
[1:39:21] you to come to Christ
[1:39:23] so she realized Jesus speaks to her to
[1:39:26] make her realize that there's no one
[1:39:28] that can keep her
[1:39:31] yeah
[1:39:32] oh to God I've never seen that before
[1:39:36] just looking at it just now think about
[1:39:38] it she she realized there was no one
[1:39:40] that could keep her he realized there
[1:39:42] was no one he was her husband
[1:39:46] oh God
[1:39:47] oh who can who can lay anything to the
[1:39:49] charge of God to the ACT it is God that
[1:39:52] justifies
[1:39:53] who could speak for her her husband
[1:39:55] could not defend her because he was not
[1:39:57] her husband
[1:39:59] so she stood there all alone
[1:40:01] before the mind of God
[1:40:04] and she she said well when Messiah comes
[1:40:07] he'll tell us these things he said I am
[1:40:09] he
[1:40:12] and she didn't wait
[1:40:14] she didn't stop
[1:40:15] she ran into the city
[1:40:18] she left her water pot the Bible says
[1:40:20] she forgot what she was doing she ran
[1:40:22] into the City and she said come see a
[1:40:23] man who told me all the things
[1:40:30] purpose and I'm closing with this and
[1:40:32] I want to deal with one more thing and
[1:40:34] I'm done
[1:40:35] the purpose of an upside down life is to
[1:40:37] bring the clay to the point of yielding
[1:40:40] I think of Simon Peter when I think of
[1:40:43] this because Simon Peter was marred Clay
[1:40:47] and he was religious
[1:40:50] boy he had a revelation of the message
[1:40:53] he could tell you who the prophet was
[1:40:56] even revealed to him by the father
[1:40:59] who God was
[1:41:01] who Christ was he knew all about it he
[1:41:04] was the spokesman for the group he was
[1:41:07] the lead man head honcho bodyguard for
[1:41:10] Jesus himself
[1:41:12] and Jesus recognizing that he would be a
[1:41:14] leader he said Peter
[1:41:17] he said when you're converted
[1:41:21] strengthen your brethren
[1:41:24] and Peter says I'll never turn you down
[1:41:27] what are you talking about Jesus you're
[1:41:29] talking about going to trial I'm not
[1:41:31] going to let you go to trial you're
[1:41:32] talking about being crucified man I'll
[1:41:34] get on Facebook and I'll support you and
[1:41:36] I'll stand for the message I well I
[1:41:39] would never do that I know who you are
[1:41:40] it was revealed to me I got a revelation
[1:41:42] when you're converted Peter
[1:41:45] the devil wants to sift you like wheat
[1:41:47] but when you're converted strengthen
[1:41:49] your brethren so you all know the story
[1:41:51] how the Peter goes down and when Jesus
[1:41:53] he follows along when he's off and and
[1:41:55] Jesus is there and there he is sitting
[1:41:57] by the fire wanting to know what's going
[1:41:59] on with curiosity but not being man
[1:42:01] enough to stand up and face the music
[1:42:03] he's a coward and he didn't know he was
[1:42:06] a coward until that moment
[1:42:08] and so he he what he does he sits there
[1:42:11] and here comes somebody who says wait a
[1:42:13] minute you talk like a Galilean you're
[1:42:15] talking about a prophet and a message
[1:42:17] and all these things what are you
[1:42:18] talking about you're not what are you
[1:42:20] doing down here in this Camp you should
[1:42:21] be up there with him
[1:42:23] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:42:26] and to prove that he couldn't be with
[1:42:27] Jesus he started cussing
[1:42:31] he denies him three different times
[1:42:34] you know why I denied him three
[1:42:35] different times because
[1:42:37] the Lord had to prove to Peter
[1:42:39] that he was a mess
[1:42:44] God knew Peter was a mess Jesus knew
[1:42:47] Peter was a mess everybody else knew
[1:42:49] Peter was a mess but the Lord had to
[1:42:50] prove to Peter you're a mess
[1:42:54] and so Peter said to Herod Here Comes
[1:42:57] Jesus and he sees him afar off and as
[1:42:59] soon as that third time he hears the
[1:43:01] rooster crowing and he looks over there
[1:43:02] and Jesus looked him right in the face
[1:43:05] imagine how he felt
[1:43:10] he was a coward and everyone knew it now
[1:43:12] he knew that women had told him Jesus
[1:43:13] had rose again he'd seen the empty tomb
[1:43:15] but he comes back the next day and he's
[1:43:17] discouraged
[1:43:19] he said you know what
[1:43:21] he said I'm
[1:43:22] I'm going fishing
[1:43:24] Peter always backsid to his business
[1:43:26] whenever he
[1:43:28] quit preaching
[1:43:30] I'm going fishing
[1:43:32] so he walked goes back to his old trade
[1:43:34] they didn't fish for fun they fished for
[1:43:37] money
[1:43:38] and so he goes back to his old trade
[1:43:39] Jesus isn't here anymore and he can't be
[1:43:41] any kind of leader he can't take his
[1:43:43] place because he's a coward it was proof
[1:43:46] to him that he's a coward
[1:43:49] and he hears he sees a man sitting on
[1:43:51] the shore well I'm so glad for the mercy
[1:43:53] of God today
[1:43:55] his life is completely upside down but
[1:43:57] he sees a man sitting by the shore and a
[1:43:59] man speaks out that he says children
[1:44:03] have you caught anything
[1:44:06] no
[1:44:08] he said we failed
[1:44:10] we've I failed as a disciple I failed as
[1:44:13] a fisherman I can't do anything right
[1:44:18] and someone tells him said that's the
[1:44:20] Lord
[1:44:22] they cast out on the other side of the
[1:44:23] boat and they catch the fish and
[1:44:24] somebody that's the Lord Peter don't
[1:44:25] even recognize it but he does something
[1:44:27] about it puts His Garment on him dumps
[1:44:30] into the water
[1:44:31] swims to the shore he gets to the shore
[1:44:33] and Jesus just fed him with dinner
[1:44:37] think about it he didn't get right away
[1:44:40] into it he fed him dinner and then after
[1:44:42] he fed him dinner he sat there and he
[1:44:44] and he began to ask him Peter do you
[1:44:46] love me
[1:44:48] musicians go ahead and come I'm closing
[1:44:50] with this
[1:44:52] do you love me
[1:44:54] you know I love you Lord I said feed my
[1:44:57] sheep
[1:44:59] Peter do you love me
[1:45:01] feed my Lambs
[1:45:04] Peter
[1:45:05] do you love me
[1:45:07] and Simon got it Peter got upset
[1:45:10] the Bible said he was grieved because he
[1:45:11] said to him the third time loving
[1:45:12] somebody remember he denied him three
[1:45:14] times
[1:45:16] you imagine how he felt by this point or
[1:45:18] you just wanted to torment me
[1:45:20] why did you even come back just just to
[1:45:22] ask me if I'm faithful I want to be
[1:45:25] faithful
[1:45:27] I want to be I want to be standing there
[1:45:30] and be in church I want to do right but
[1:45:32] this old flesh it gets in the way
[1:45:35] it just it won't let me
[1:45:38] but Jesus had to Clay in his hands
[1:45:42] Peter's life had been turned upside down
[1:45:44] because of what he did by free will but
[1:45:46] Jesus was coming to him notice what he
[1:45:48] said he said Lord he said the third time
[1:45:50] and finally Peter just gives up he said
[1:45:52] Lord you know all things
[1:45:54] Jesus said feed my sheep
[1:45:57] and then Jesus tells him something
[1:45:59] interesting he said verily verily I say
[1:46:01] unto you when you were young you girded
[1:46:03] yourself and walked whether thou
[1:46:04] wouldest but when thou shalt behold Thou
[1:46:07] shalt stretch forth thy hands and
[1:46:08] another shall gird thee and carry their
[1:46:10] wither thou with us not this fake he's
[1:46:13] signifying by what death he should
[1:46:14] glorify God and when he had spoken this
[1:46:16] he saith unto him follow me
[1:46:19] now I've never really understood why
[1:46:21] that in this moment when Peter feels so
[1:46:23] bad about what he's done why does Jesus
[1:46:26] suddenly tell him
[1:46:28] you're gonna die
[1:46:31] you're gonna die for the gospel
[1:46:33] but what's he telling him brother Joe he
[1:46:35] knew Jesus was telling him the truth
[1:46:37] what was he telling him he was telling
[1:46:39] him you're not going to give in again
[1:46:44] he took the clay in his hands
[1:46:47] oh my Peter do you love me Peter one day
[1:46:50] you're going to die but you're not going
[1:46:52] to die a coward
[1:46:55] oh Churchill we just recognize God wants
[1:46:57] to get you in his hands until he can
[1:46:59] Point At You he can look at you and he
[1:47:00] can tell you by his word you might give
[1:47:02] you might have a problems in life you
[1:47:04] might have circumstance but you won't
[1:47:06] give up you might have trouble but you
[1:47:08] won't give in amen you're gonna die on a
[1:47:11] cross but that just means you stood you
[1:47:14] won't do it again oh that's what he
[1:47:16] wants out of his church he wants to so
[1:47:18] remake us he don't want to leave us like
[1:47:20] we are the failures that we are the ones
[1:47:22] who have that besetting sin that we just
[1:47:24] can't get over and we keep doing it over
[1:47:26] and over and over again but he wants to
[1:47:28] remake you today he wants to remake you
[1:47:30] in such a way he said Peter you're when
[1:47:32] you get done in the upper room when the
[1:47:34] Holy Ghost comes into you and remakes
[1:47:36] you by the fire baptism of the Holy
[1:47:37] Ghost you won't be a coward anymore
[1:47:40] you'll stand until one day you'll
[1:47:42] actually die for me
[1:47:45] Peter would die a martyr crucified
[1:47:47] upside down on the cross
[1:47:50] and Peter you won't deny me again
[1:47:52] oh my that's what I want to hear from
[1:47:55] him don't you
[1:47:57] heads together
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:08] oh God
[1:48:12] foreign
[1:48:14] I don't know
[1:48:17] why I preached this today and maybe it's
[1:48:19] just for me
[1:48:23] but let's just sit in The Potter's House
[1:48:25] for a moment
[1:48:27] Place ourselves on the Wheel
[1:48:32] Lord I know you want different things
[1:48:34] out of my life
[1:48:36] I messed up my life is upside down
[1:48:40] not what I should be
[1:48:42] but you're making me into something else
[1:48:46] you're working Lord there's a reason why
[1:48:48] I'm still on the Wheel
[1:48:50] still in life I'm still in time
[1:48:53] I know Lord you haven't left your throne
[1:48:55] of Mercy oh God
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:00] but I know any minute that that will
[1:49:01] could stop
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:06] so while I'm on the Wheel
[1:49:09] I want to yield myself to the fullness
[1:49:11] of the will of God
[1:49:14] yield myself completely to the word of
[1:49:16] God
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:19] until I can't do anything but
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:24] I'm sure the Flesh of Peter still wanted
[1:49:27] to be a coward
[1:49:29] there's times it even shows that after
[1:49:31] he had the Holy Ghost when he went over
[1:49:33] with the Jews and wouldn't sit with the
[1:49:34] Gentiles that meet
[1:49:36] the Flesh of Peter still wanted to be a
[1:49:38] coward but when it come down to it and
[1:49:41] the going got rough
[1:49:43] he would not do what he did before
[1:49:45] because he was not the same vessel he
[1:49:49] had been remade
[1:49:51] oh God we come broken and even into the
[1:49:54] world we come broke
[1:49:56] we we sit we're on the wheel today of
[1:49:59] time and we're broken and we've got to
[1:50:01] be remade why don't you just let him do
[1:50:04] it today let him remake you till you're
[1:50:06] not a coward no more you're not afraid
[1:50:08] of the message of the hour you're not
[1:50:10] ashamed you're not embarrassed you're
[1:50:12] not embarrassed by the way you have to
[1:50:13] dress not embarrassed by the things you
[1:50:16] have to do
[1:50:17] not embarrassed by My Worship anymore
[1:50:20] I'm not embarrassed to be called
[1:50:22] Pentecostal
[1:50:24] because you've remade Me Lord
[1:50:27] I'm here on the wheel and you've made me
[1:50:29] into something new
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:32] still the clay still the same clay
[1:50:35] but by my own free will I got myself in
[1:50:37] trouble now I want to be new
[1:50:41] would you just talk to him for a moment
[1:50:42] I want to ask for a show of hands I just
[1:50:44] want you to talk to him for a moment and
[1:50:46] if you feel to come to the altar the
[1:50:47] altar is open this morning
[1:50:49] be glad to pray with you
[1:50:51] but maybe you just talk to him maybe you
[1:50:53] slip down right where you're at
[1:50:55] begin to talk to oh God
[1:50:57] I'm on the Wheel of Time today make me
[1:51:00] mold me while I'm still on the Wheel of
[1:51:03] Time let me it's not too late
[1:51:06] I haven't done too much the woman at the
[1:51:07] well she didn't even want to make that
[1:51:09] walk to the well that day she she
[1:51:11] probably was so depressed and so worried
[1:51:13] that somebody might see her but she went
[1:51:16] anyway
[1:51:17] because it was ordained by God for her
[1:51:19] to be sitting at that well to come to
[1:51:22] that well while Jesus was there Jesus is
[1:51:24] here this morning he said we're two or
[1:51:26] three are gathered together I will be in
[1:51:28] their midst why don't you come to the
[1:51:29] well why don't you just receive from him
[1:51:31] today new life why don't you let his
[1:51:34] hands remake your life into something
[1:51:36] new Heavenly Father
[1:51:38] Lord Jesus we we thank you for the
[1:51:40] promise of your word we thank you Lord
[1:51:43] that you promised there would be a bride
[1:51:45] without spot or wrinkle
[1:51:47] wash in the bleeding word
[1:51:50] there would be a people with no fault in
[1:51:52] them
[1:51:53] but Lord we know we are not that by the
[1:51:55] flesh but the Potter has us on the Wheel
[1:51:58] you have us on the wheel Lord
[1:52:00] you are making us into what you want us
[1:52:03] to be oh God by free will we messed up
[1:52:06] by free will we we we we get we gave
[1:52:09] ourselves all kinds of trouble Lord
[1:52:11] we're giving up today we're giving in
[1:52:13] Lord we want to be what you want us to
[1:52:16] be we want to surrender completely oh
[1:52:18] God surrender completely to the word of
[1:52:20] God I won't fight it anymore Lord I
[1:52:22] won't fight the will of God in my life I
[1:52:24] won't fight the maker anymore
[1:52:27] but I'll Follow You Lord to the ends of
[1:52:29] the Earth May that not be just a
[1:52:31] statement of our lips today God I'd like
[1:52:34] to think that if I was put before a
[1:52:36] tribunal if I was in the court and they
[1:52:37] said it would be death or you give up
[1:52:39] this message or it'll be death I would
[1:52:41] like to think that I would stand during
[1:52:43] that hour but Lord only you know that
[1:52:45] only you know but I know this oh God
[1:52:48] that you can make that vessel so strong
[1:52:50] that a coward would even stand when
[1:52:53] Peter come to that moment of judgment
[1:52:55] and the and the emperor said Peter
[1:52:58] you've got to give up you've got to give
[1:53:00] up Christ you've got to deny him
[1:53:02] he said I can't do it much as I would
[1:53:05] want to live as much as I would want to
[1:53:07] not be crucified I can't do it because
[1:53:10] I'm going to serve him with all my life
[1:53:12] and there's something in him his hands
[1:53:15] have remade me his hands have made me
[1:53:17] what I am today I didn't get here by
[1:53:20] myself I came by his will oh I pray you
[1:53:24] granted today Lord may that be each and
[1:53:26] every one of us may we each and every
[1:53:27] one come to that place Lord where we
[1:53:29] know we would stand for the message of
[1:53:31] the hour we we would stand for you or if
[1:53:34] there's one here like the woman at the
[1:53:36] well or maybe maybe he had a lot of
[1:53:38] trouble in life we don't know what the
[1:53:39] trouble is but we know that you do I
[1:53:42] pray oh God that you'd reach down help
[1:53:44] them to realize it's not too late
[1:53:46] they're still on the Wheel
[1:53:47] Lord help them to give in to the hands
[1:53:50] of the Potter let him make them over and
[1:53:51] over again

[1:53:54] they're yours Lord you won't throw it
[1:53:56] away we're so thankful for that today I
[1:53:59] pray you you'd move like Lord in Hearts
[1:54:01] right now you touch each one
[1:54:03] let us worship you oh God not not
[1:54:06] necessarily because we even want to but
[1:54:09] because there's something within us the
[1:54:11] Lord that drives us that pulls us to
[1:54:13] worship that seed you put there on the
[1:54:15] inside of the inside I pray you granted
[1:54:17] now we ask in Jesus name he
[1:54:21] hate with all my strength oh my with all
[1:54:27] I have oh I will see
[1:54:31] oh Jesus to honor his hallelujah
[1:54:36] amen oh I pledge
