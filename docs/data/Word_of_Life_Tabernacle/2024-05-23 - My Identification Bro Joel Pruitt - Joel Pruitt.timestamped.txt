[45:31] verse 26 in the same
[45:33] chapter verse 26 and God said let us
[45:37] make man in our image after our likeness
[45:40] and let them have dominion over the fish
[45:41] of the sea and over the foul of the air
[45:44] and over the cattle and over all that
[45:47] and over all the Earth and over every
[45:48] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[45:50] Earth so God created man in his own
[45:52] image in the image of God created he him
[45:55] male and female created he them in
[45:58] Deuteronomy chap 4 and verse 9 we'll
[46:01] just have one verse there Deuteronomy
[46:03] chapter 4 and verse
[46:09] 9 and it goes like this only take heed
[46:12] to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently
[46:15] lest thou forget the things which thine
[46:17] eyes have seen and lest they depart from
[46:19] thy heart all the days of thy life but
[46:21] teach them thy sons and thy son's sons
[46:25] and you may be seated may the Lord add
[46:27] His blessings to the reading of the word
[46:29] if I could title a sermon tonight I
[46:31] would speak on my identification and we
[46:33] are all identified as something every
[46:35] one of us in the in the sound of my
[46:37] voice we're identified as something or
[46:39] we're identified with something every
[46:41] one of us have an identity or we should
[46:44] if you if you don't have an identity
[46:45] then nobody knows who you are and and
[46:47] you probably don't exist so everyone
[46:48] that exists has an identity go God
[46:50] created you with an identity the
[46:52] identity that he gave you as a man you
[46:54] were identified as a man now you can in
[46:56] this day we live in a man can try to be
[46:58] a woman and a and a woman can try to be
[47:00] a man but really you're identified the
[47:02] way God has made you and you really
[47:05] can't change that identity there is no
[47:06] way to change that identity you can you
[47:08] can you can make believe your identity
[47:10] but uh your identity would really be
[47:12] revealed you can take a man that tries
[47:14] to be a woman but if you go all the way
[47:15] back to what God made him he's still a
[47:17] man if you take a woman that's become a
[47:19] become a man you can go all the way back
[47:20] to when they were born and they were
[47:22] born exactly the way God made them and
[47:25] so they have an identification even if
[47:27] they try to falsely identify themselves
[47:29] in some other way you're identified with
[47:31] your church a lot of times people say
[47:33] well you go to brother Ben's church or
[47:34] you go to brother Jason's church or you
[47:35] go to brother brother Matt's or Brother
[47:37] David you know any other church and a
[47:39] lot of times you're identified like that
[47:40] a Christian Tabernacle or Word of Life
[47:42] and and so people identify you with the
[47:43] church you go to or Baptist or Methodist
[47:45] or whatever and sometimes you you like
[47:48] that identity and sometimes you don't
[47:49] like that identity sometimes you're
[47:51] identified by your family and a lot of
[47:53] times we don't like to be identified
[47:54] with our family because a lot of you
[47:56] come from a background ground where
[47:57] you're not real proud of your family can
[47:58] you say amen that's just the way it is
[48:01] sometimes you love your family and we
[48:02] should always love our family but
[48:04] sometimes we're not real proud of the
[48:05] life we've come from or the lineage
[48:07] because not everybody come from a
[48:08] perfect home you know that to be true
[48:10] tonight so every one of us are
[48:12] identified by something and a lot of
[48:14] times it's identified uh your political
[48:17] preference can identify you I'm you know
[48:18] you can be identified as a Republican or
[48:20] a Democrat or an an independent or or
[48:23] whatever because every one of us and and
[48:25] we always want to be identified in a
[48:27] certain way but I think what we really
[48:30] should be focused on is our
[48:31] identification in the word can we can we
[48:34] be found in the word and identified in
[48:36] the word I I I think a lot of times we
[48:39] we we we want to be identified with a
[48:41] group of people in the message that we
[48:42] think is the Elite Class of the message
[48:44] but to me that is not how we should be
[48:46] identified H have we been walking in the
[48:48] word of God for this hour have we been
[48:51] have we found our place in the scripture
[48:53] because a prophet would say it like this
[48:55] if you knew who you were then we be out
[48:57] of here once the bride will recognize
[48:58] who she is then we'll be gone and I
[49:00] think that's what we need to do tonight
[49:02] let's find out who we are not what
[49:04] church we belong to or or what family we
[49:06] belong to but let's find out who we
[49:08] really are let's find out what kind of
[49:10] you know I you know how you dress can
[49:12] identify who you are if a lady with a
[49:14] dress walks down the street you're
[49:15] identified as different or crazy or
[49:18] something but you are identified why
[49:20] because you are identifying yourself
[49:23] with the word of God and dressing like a
[49:25] lady should dress and and if you're not
[49:27] you can find a a good Christian woman
[49:29] she may brother Brandon would say she
[49:31] would live true to her husband and be
[49:33] just a good woman but she would dress
[49:35] like the world you wouldn't know her
[49:36] from a street prostitute well come on
[49:38] somebody you wouldn't know the
[49:39] difference now I'm not saying that she's
[49:41] not going to heaven or maybe she's a
[49:42] good Christian and maybe that person
[49:44] will come in here and get saved and
[49:45] filled with the Holy Ghost and and make
[49:46] a rapture we don't want to judge them uh
[49:48] judge anything until it's time but but I
[49:51] would say it like this I think we need
[49:53] to find our identity today I think we
[49:55] need to know who we are because the end
[49:57] is just too close to be playing church
[49:59] can you say Amen brother Stuart here
[50:01] preached not too long ago there's no
[50:03] time for playing church and I think uh
[50:05] if there's ever been a time to preach
[50:06] that sermon it's now it's there's ever
[50:09] if there's ever been a time to find your
[50:10] identification in the word of God it's
[50:12] now brother brandham would say it like
[50:14] this he said we are identified with our
[50:16] families in this human life by marriage
[50:18] with our wives the one when we marry and
[50:20] our family is identified by the union of
[50:23] our marriage and then he said what to
[50:25] think what if this horrible thing would
[50:26] happened to you and you wouldn't be able
[50:28] to remember who you married that would
[50:29] be terrible for some and he said who
[50:32] would what if this terrible thing would
[50:33] happen to you who's your wife and which
[50:35] is your children and who is your father
[50:37] and mother and who's your neighbor now
[50:39] there's another word for that brother
[50:40] Brandon preaches a message called
[50:41] spiritual Amnesia how many's ever heard
[50:43] it well if you haven't you need to go
[50:45] listen to it that's a good one 1964
[50:47] spiritual Amnesia and brother BR would
[50:49] talk about that and but but you would
[50:51] forget who you are and you you just
[50:53] imagine Brother David you go home
[50:55] tonight and and you walk in in the house
[50:57] and you're like who are you and and Mary
[50:58] would say well I'm your wife but you'd
[51:01] forgot what is it it would be Amnesia
[51:03] that would set in and you wouldn't you
[51:04] would know who you're married to and I
[51:06] think sometimes as Christians we are the
[51:08] same way we see the word staring us
[51:10] right in the face well what does that
[51:11] have to do with me this is your word
[51:14] this is your identity this is where you
[51:16] belong Under The Fellowship of the
[51:18] message of the hour this is who you are
[51:20] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ well
[51:22] can you say Amen on a Wednesday night
[51:25] can you say Amen we are are the Bride of
[51:27] Jesus Christ but we've got to identify
[51:29] ourselves there by the word of God
[51:32] there's nothing else that can identify
[51:33] us there you know your status in the
[51:35] message will not identify you as
[51:37] bride but you will be identified by the
[51:40] word that you believe and live brother
[51:43] Brandon would go on to say we are
[51:45] identified again he said can identify
[51:47] ourselves in the human race by having
[51:49] intelligence there again I'd say some of
[51:51] us and and being different from animal
[51:53] life the animals cannot think he just
[51:55] goes by sounds and so forth
[51:57] and he has no soul but he said but what
[52:00] makes us different we're identified by
[52:01] having a soul and a conscience that
[52:03] tells us what's right and wrong so we're
[52:05] different we're not just a we're not
[52:07] just a an animal we're not just a bird
[52:09] or or an elephant but we are We Are a
[52:11] Human Being we are greater than that God
[52:13] has made us for a purpose and we can
[52:15] identify ourselves as such right in the
[52:18] scriptures brother B says You must be
[52:20] identified somewhere you must show your
[52:23] your life shows tonight where you are
[52:25] where you are identified you are
[52:26] identified either in Christ or out of
[52:29] Christ you are not halfway there's no
[52:31] such thing as a drunk sober man there's
[52:33] no black white bird you're either saved
[52:34] or you're not saved you're a saint or a
[52:36] sinner one or the other and your
[52:38] spiritual attitude towards God's word
[52:41] identifies you exactly where you're
[52:43] standing now I think that's pretty good
[52:45] I think our attitude tonight can tell
[52:47] you exactly where you're standing now
[52:49] when the word of God is preached and
[52:50] sometimes it's preached in a way that
[52:52] you can enjoy it and sometimes it's
[52:53] preached in a in a way you don't enjoy
[52:55] it so much but when the word of God
[52:57] when it when it hits your heart a real
[52:58] believer will have an attitude that says
[53:00] Amen to the word of God Amen you can't
[53:02] change that because that is your
[53:04] identity the word is your identity and
[53:06] when you when you can recognize yourself
[53:08] in the word of God nothing can change
[53:10] that word well come on somebody I said
[53:12] nothing can change who you are in the
[53:14] word you know you can backslide you can
[53:16] run from this message but you can go you
[53:18] can go so far to where you feel like you
[53:20] can never come back again but if your
[53:22] identity is in the word then you'll
[53:23] always come back to the word you'll
[53:26] always come back why because there's
[53:27] something on the inside of you that'll
[53:29] bring you back no more than no more than
[53:31] you could change who you are or what you
[53:32] are or you you've got to become a
[53:35] Christian and be identified with the
[53:37] word of your hour well can you say Amen
[53:39] tonight God's word Vindicated prove that
[53:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just
[53:43] the same as it ever was on the day of
[53:45] Pentecost or any other time and Jesus
[53:48] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[53:50] forever and your attitude towards that
[53:53] identifies whether you have spiritual
[53:55] Amnesia or not I want to be identified
[53:57] with that crazy bunch of Acts 2
[53:59] Christians I want to be identified with
[54:01] a bunch of Acts 2 Pentecostal I tell you
[54:03] what I think we need another blessing on
[54:05] the church again I think it's time we we
[54:07] just go ahead and say you know what
[54:08] we're going to take off the chains and
[54:10] we're going to just worship free again
[54:12] why because I'm identified with a with a
[54:14] couple guys who were sitting down in
[54:16] jail one night and they sang so loud and
[54:18] they worshiped so hard till the chains
[54:20] fell off well you tell me worship wrong
[54:22] I go ahead and say it like this let the
[54:24] worship happen let the praise happen and
[54:27] watch the chains fall off the people
[54:29] here tonight well I wish somebody preach
[54:30] with me I think it's time we quit
[54:32] holding back and our identifying
[54:34] ourselves with a bunch of cold dead
[54:36] formal Christians when what we need is
[54:38] to be identified again with a newborn
[54:41] Christian that we are I don't care if
[54:43] you have to you say well I've never had
[54:45] that experience yet then it's time you
[54:47] get down to the Altar and identify
[54:49] yourself with that bunch of screaming
[54:51] hollering act two Pentecostal
[54:54] babies well I tell you you well well I
[54:57] don't want to be a baby well you got to
[54:58] be a baby before you can ever have to
[54:59] get saved before the word's ever going
[55:01] to come alive to you can you say amen I
[55:04] tell you what tonight I think we need to
[55:06] have and he said your attitude towards
[55:07] that identifies whether you have
[55:09] spiritual Amnesia or not he said I
[55:12] whether you're a deacon or even if
[55:13] you're a preacher it doesn't matter he
[55:16] said they get it too we find out it's
[55:18] contagious and it hits the whole thing
[55:21] you got a preacher up there with
[55:22] spiritual Amnesia that don't believe the
[55:23] power of God can move anymore and you
[55:25] end up with a church full of people that
[55:26] don't believe the spirit of God can move
[55:28] anymore well can you say amen God wants
[55:32] people back in the Pulpit preaching the
[55:33] entire word of God and the power Bap and
[55:36] the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:37] coming down on the people brother
[55:39] brandom said that's the way God expects
[55:41] it that's what God wants he said we need
[55:43] preachers back in the Pulpit he didn't
[55:45] say preachers sit down but preachers
[55:47] back in the Pulpit preaching and the
[55:48] fire baptism of the Holy Ghost coming
[55:50] down well if that would work for a
[55:52] prophet if that's what a prophet wanted
[55:54] what about me tonight what about you
[55:56] tonight I'm not satisfied with just
[55:59] another Wednesday night service I'm not
[56:01] satisfied with just another religious
[56:03] formal Gathering but what I want to see
[56:05] tonight is the fire baptism of the Holy
[56:07] Ghost grab a hold of a young person or
[56:09] an old person and move on them and make
[56:11] a move like they've never moved before I
[56:14] think it'll do some good let's break
[56:16] some of these icicles off a little bit
[56:18] and just have church what do you say
[56:19] tonight can we just have church and just
[56:21] forget about everything around us
[56:24] today we need to be identified with that
[56:26] group of people that got so close to God
[56:28] they were expecting such a blessing that
[56:30] they got up in the upper room and and
[56:32] they stood there and they stayed there
[56:33] and they waited and They Carried they
[56:35] wouldn't leave they wouldn't even leave
[56:36] until they got the Holy Ghost why
[56:38] because it was a promise that was to
[56:39] come and today you've got the same
[56:41] promise that the Holy Ghost would come
[56:44] upon you if you've been
[56:45] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:48] Christ The Promise is here all you've
[56:50] got to do is accept it but you'll never
[56:52] get it coming down to the Altar for 5
[56:53] minutes and saying well maybe that was
[56:55] all I needed to do and a dry-eyed
[56:57] confession will never make it happen but
[56:59] what you need is to really get down
[57:00] there and I tell you what it may take
[57:02] some snot and some tears and it may take
[57:04] all kinds of things but let me tell you
[57:06] something I'd rather be right here at
[57:08] the altar and snotting and crying like a
[57:10] baby than to get to to get to heaven and
[57:12] he say well what have you done with the
[57:14] word that's been given to you well it
[57:16] made me look crazy in church it made me
[57:18] act different he said well if you're not
[57:19] identified with that group then depart
[57:21] because I never even knew you but I want
[57:23] to be identified tonight with a group of
[57:25] people people who are not afraid to
[57:27] Worship in the house of
[57:30] God there's never there's not a quote
[57:32] that tells you not to Worship in church
[57:34] so I don't even want to hear about it
[57:36] there's not a quot there's not even a
[57:37] quote that tells you that you have a
[57:39] right to sit there when the word of God
[57:41] is being preached and say well I don't
[57:43] need that word I I I've heard that
[57:45] before well if the word's being preached
[57:47] that's already been preached you've
[57:48] heard all of it
[57:49] before but if it's become common to you
[57:52] then you have not identified yourself
[57:54] with that word and become part of that
[57:56] word I tell you what if you got up in
[57:58] the morning brother Jeff and you said
[58:00] well sister Patty you were my wife
[58:02] yesterday but I'm kind of sick of that
[58:03] well that'd be a real bad marriage
[58:05] wouldn't
[58:05] it I'm tired of looking at you I told my
[58:09] wife that and I'd never get to see her
[58:11] again you know but let me tell you
[58:13] something what how we treat the word
[58:15] often times is how we treat everything
[58:17] else if we haphazardly handle the word
[58:20] of God then the next thing you know it
[58:21] trickles down to our homes and the next
[58:23] thing you know it trickles down in our
[58:24] work and we got to be careful we got it
[58:26] happens to all of us and we we get
[58:28] complacent and we get it it becomes
[58:30] common to us and and and I've heard this
[58:31] spiritual Amnesia tap probably a hundred
[58:33] times because it's one of my favorites
[58:35] and and I listen to it over and over but
[58:37] sometimes you just got to hey I forget
[58:39] about the last time I heard it I want to
[58:41] hear it again Lord speak to me again I
[58:43] don't care if I've heard that before
[58:45] speak to me again I need to be fed again
[58:48] just because I had steak yesterday don't
[58:50] mean I don't want it
[58:52] tomorrow right well I'll never go back
[58:55] to Golden Crow because I've had
[58:56] everything they've got to offer I've had
[58:58] everything they've had to offer hundreds
[58:59] of times and I'll still go
[59:01] back if you don't get this figure by
[59:04] staying away from Golden
[59:06] Corral but but think about it you're
[59:09] identified with something and if you're
[59:11] identified with the words you can't wait
[59:13] to hear the word of God because you want
[59:15] to hear what you're identified with tell
[59:18] me my family history sometime I love to
[59:20] hear about my family history the good
[59:21] parts I love to hear the good parts of
[59:23] my family history because you're
[59:24] identified with something right
[59:26] a and your family history wouldn't
[59:28] matter to me if you're not related
[59:30] right and everybody got
[59:33] quiet my family history wouldn't matter
[59:36] to you if you're not related to me well
[59:38] that's just somebody else's family
[59:39] history but when you talk about your own
[59:41] your identified with that I you know
[59:44] this might be too simple for you but I'd
[59:46] like to just let you know if you could
[59:47] ever actually get identified with the
[59:49] word of God you wouldn't question the
[59:51] message of the hour if you could ever
[59:54] identify yourself in the message of the
[59:56] hour it wouldn't be so easy to go back
[59:58] back out in the world and backslide over
[1:00:00] and over again if you could ever
[1:00:02] identify yourself with the message of
[1:00:04] the hour you would find yourself growing
[1:00:07] in the word and not always going
[1:00:09] backwards in the word I well I tell you
[1:00:11] what I think we need some Simplicity
[1:00:13] back in the Pulpit that'll tell you this
[1:00:15] you need to be saved and filled with the
[1:00:17] Holy Ghost and find yourself in the word
[1:00:20] again and let the word change your life
[1:00:23] and it will do it how many knows it'll
[1:00:25] do it I I think I'm looking at some
[1:00:26] people where the word has changed your
[1:00:28] lives you are not what you could have
[1:00:30] been had the word never crossed your
[1:00:32] path but did you know you didn't go
[1:00:33] looking for God he came looking for you
[1:00:35] why because his Spirit his seed was in
[1:00:38] you and he identified with that life
[1:00:41] that was in you and once that life came
[1:00:43] to M once that life met the met the
[1:00:45] spirit and then they could identify with
[1:00:47] each other do you realize that you and
[1:00:49] Christ had become one you are fully
[1:00:52] identified with Christ today just like
[1:00:54] you're identified with your family
[1:00:56] history just like you're identified with
[1:00:58] the word of God you and Christ have
[1:01:00] become identified as man and
[1:01:04] wife that's what I want to get to you
[1:01:06] tonight we are identified as Christians
[1:01:09] not just in Christian name only but we
[1:01:12] are identified as Christians because we
[1:01:14] have we have put off the world from us
[1:01:16] and we have laid down the things of the
[1:01:18] world oh yes the world's going to fight
[1:01:20] you and this flesh will fight you till
[1:01:22] the day you die you you're not going to
[1:01:23] get out of this flesh without a fight
[1:01:26] but what you'll do is you the spirit of
[1:01:28] God will raise up a standard how many
[1:01:31] knows that to be true that's Bible the
[1:01:33] spirit of God will raise up a standard
[1:01:35] in this last day and I believe you are
[1:01:37] the standard that will be raised up to
[1:01:40] fight the enemy in this day you are but
[1:01:43] it's the ones who are identified with
[1:01:46] Christ you'll have to find your identity
[1:01:48] to know where you are now brother B
[1:01:49] talks about to be an American he said to
[1:01:51] be an American you must be identified
[1:01:53] with your nation and he goes on down and
[1:01:55] he said what she is I am what she was I
[1:01:58] am no matter what she was I am still
[1:02:01] what she was to be an American I landed
[1:02:03] on Plymouth Rock now brother Bram talks
[1:02:05] like that and he talks about where he
[1:02:06] was I was here and I was there what he
[1:02:08] is saying if he is really an American he
[1:02:11] is identified with everything an
[1:02:12] American stands for and so not that he
[1:02:15] would agree with what she stands for but
[1:02:17] he's identified with it if I tell you
[1:02:19] I'm an American then everything that
[1:02:20] happens in America I'm I'm identified
[1:02:22] with the government I'm identified with
[1:02:24] our president I'm identif with all these
[1:02:26] things but you realize that you're
[1:02:28] identified because you are an American
[1:02:31] if you don't want to be identified as
[1:02:33] American I'm sure there's other
[1:02:34] countries it'll take you but if you are
[1:02:36] an American you are identified as an
[1:02:38] American if you was born in France
[1:02:39] you're identified with France and and
[1:02:41] what she would stand for but you realize
[1:02:44] that that that that that doesn't make
[1:02:45] you uh that doesn't make you come under
[1:02:47] subjection to the American rules or laws
[1:02:50] uh under the laws yes but under under
[1:02:52] things that would make you take you out
[1:02:53] of your Christianity would make you
[1:02:55] different you don't become an American
[1:02:56] like uh I want to dress like the the
[1:02:58] regular American people and act like the
[1:03:00] American people no America has went to
[1:03:02] hell in a hurry a and this this this
[1:03:05] nation has been has been has has has
[1:03:07] turned down God for the last time but do
[1:03:09] you realize that we are not part of that
[1:03:11] group but what we are is part of a group
[1:03:14] that is going out of here but your
[1:03:15] natural nation is an American you are a
[1:03:18] natural-born American but I was the only
[1:03:21] one in my family not natural-born
[1:03:22] actually so I'm not not a natural-born
[1:03:24] American I couldn't be
[1:03:27] president oh my goodness y'all are hard
[1:03:30] tonight I was born C-section okay one
[1:03:34] one out of eight how about that I was
[1:03:37] the biggest in my family too I bet you I
[1:03:38] bet you looked at Ben one time and said
[1:03:40] I don't believe
[1:03:42] that brother brandom said it like this I
[1:03:45] crossed the icy Delaware with George
[1:03:46] Washington y'all are you know I'm gonna
[1:03:49] have to make you laugh or something cuz
[1:03:50] y'all are hard
[1:03:52] tonight y'all are tough I stood with
[1:03:55] Stonewall Jackson when the odds was so
[1:03:57] great against him and they asked how can
[1:03:58] you stand like a stone wall when the
[1:03:59] odds is against you the little bashful
[1:04:01] blue-eyed fellow kicked the dust with
[1:04:03] his boots and said I never take a drink
[1:04:04] of water until I thank God for it I have
[1:04:06] to stand like a Stonewall with him I
[1:04:08] stood there with Stonewall Jackson
[1:04:10] brother brand says I'm identify with him
[1:04:12] and his stand so we go on down here and
[1:04:14] I'll try to to save time I'll just try
[1:04:16] to get through this as quickly as
[1:04:17] possible now to be identified American
[1:04:20] Americans has to stand for all America's
[1:04:21] shame and all America's Glory all she
[1:04:23] ever was all she is or what she will
[1:04:25] will be you are identified with it now
[1:04:28] to be a true Christian now this is the
[1:04:29] part that's important to you tonight now
[1:04:31] to be a true Christian you have to be
[1:04:33] the same you have to be identified with
[1:04:34] everything that a Christian would stand
[1:04:36] for he said we don't want to forget that
[1:04:38] all that he was I'm identified with him
[1:04:40] I'm identified with him notice he is in
[1:04:43] me and I in him then every Christian
[1:04:45] that's a real genuine Christian now
[1:04:47] there's the qualifier right there you
[1:04:49] can say you're a Christian and not be a
[1:04:50] Christian can you say Amen but what if
[1:04:52] you're a real genuine Christian then you
[1:04:55] were with him when the morning Stars
[1:04:56] sang together and the sons of God
[1:04:59] shouted for Joy before there was a
[1:05:01] foundation of the world we were
[1:05:02] identified in the immortal Realms with
[1:05:04] God 10 million years before the world
[1:05:07] was ever formed can you say amen I was
[1:05:09] back there with him if I got eternal
[1:05:11] life I was there with him I was
[1:05:13] identified with him and when the morning
[1:05:15] Stars sang together he said the sons of
[1:05:17] God Shadow her Joy I was there when he
[1:05:18] called Abraham at the age of 75 and his
[1:05:20] wife 65 and told him they were going to
[1:05:22] have a baby I was with him when he took
[1:05:24] his T upon thus say the Lord I'm going
[1:05:26] to have the baby see I was identified
[1:05:29] there and so I can find my identity now
[1:05:31] in the same scripture under the same
[1:05:33] those aren't just Bible stories to me
[1:05:35] those are realities to me because I'm
[1:05:37] identified with those men in the Bible
[1:05:40] I'm not just I'm not just saying well
[1:05:41] Abraham had Faith so maybe I can have
[1:05:43] faith no you identify yourself with
[1:05:45] Sarah if you need a baby identify
[1:05:47] yourself with with Abraham when he had
[1:05:49] to go put offer his son up to to the
[1:05:51] Lord remember go God will provide
[1:05:54] himself a ram God will provide himself a
[1:05:56] sacrifice identify yourself in the
[1:05:59] scriptures identify yourself with the
[1:06:01] men and women of this Bible listen you
[1:06:03] can find yourself in this Bible but
[1:06:05] don't find yourself on the wrong side of
[1:06:07] the
[1:06:08] situation I don't want to be identified
[1:06:10] with Judas I don't want to be identified
[1:06:12] with with the Rich Young Ruler I don't
[1:06:14] want to be identified with with those
[1:06:16] who would turn their back on Jesus no I
[1:06:18] want to be identified with Peter I want
[1:06:20] to be identified with Paul I want to be
[1:06:22] identified I can bring it on right down
[1:06:24] this day I want to be identified with a
[1:06:26] prophet named William brandham why
[1:06:28] because it's not the man I'm pointing
[1:06:29] you to it's I'm identified with the
[1:06:31] message that he brought because the
[1:06:33] message is Jesus Christ to you not the
[1:06:37] man not the flesh you've got to look
[1:06:38] past the veil and see what God has
[1:06:40] brought to this hour see we're we were
[1:06:42] saying well if I could look like Abraham
[1:06:44] or I could look you ever see I knew some
[1:06:46] people one time they they wanted to they
[1:06:47] they all had hair like Wesley they all
[1:06:49] tried to dress exactly like John Wesley
[1:06:51] and and act like him and look like him
[1:06:53] listen that didn't make them John Wesley
[1:06:55] you you want to you want to be you want
[1:06:56] to be what Jesus was do the works that
[1:06:58] he did don't try to dress like him just
[1:07:00] do the works that he did that's a good
[1:07:02] start and maybe people look at you and
[1:07:03] say well that's a Jesus man but let me
[1:07:05] tell you something we got to start
[1:07:07] somewhere and we might as well start
[1:07:08] with getting back to the word of God and
[1:07:11] finding ourselves there well if there
[1:07:13] was ever somebody healed in the Bible
[1:07:15] you can be identified with that person
[1:07:16] that was healed a leper or a lame or
[1:07:19] blind or whatever it was you can be
[1:07:21] identified in that story when he said by
[1:07:24] his stripes you are healed we are healed
[1:07:27] you can put your name there and say I'm
[1:07:28] identified with the word of God when he
[1:07:30] said Rejoice all ye people I tell you
[1:07:33] what I can put my name there and say I'm
[1:07:35] going to rejoice when I when he I tell
[1:07:37] you what when he said if you hold your
[1:07:38] peace the rocks will cry out I'm not
[1:07:40] going to let the rocks cry out in my
[1:07:42] place I'm going to identify myself there
[1:07:44] and say I'm going to speak out in the
[1:07:46] name of Jesus I'm going to say Lord I
[1:07:48] come by my way tonight because I need
[1:07:50] another touch from you I'm not here just
[1:07:52] to play church I'm not here just to find
[1:07:55] out who so and so is and what they've
[1:07:57] done but I'm here to say I'm identified
[1:08:00] with the word of God in this hour I'm
[1:08:02] identified with something I'm identified
[1:08:04] with something real I'm identified when
[1:08:06] a prophet said that the cloud was Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ he said that was Christ up there
[1:08:10] I identifi myself with that message I
[1:08:12] was there in the mind of
[1:08:15] God sir when a prophet could stand there
[1:08:18] and turn his back to the people and tell
[1:08:20] them their names and tell them who they
[1:08:21] were and where they come from I'm
[1:08:23] identified with that Ministry can
[1:08:25] identify myself in that in that place
[1:08:27] why because that's a Biblical Ministry
[1:08:30] that has come and it is the word being
[1:08:32] fulfilled I want to find myself always
[1:08:35] fulfilling the word of the
[1:08:38] hour brother Ram goes on and he makes
[1:08:41] all kinds of he said I'm identified here
[1:08:42] and he goes on with Moses and the Red
[1:08:44] Sea he said whatever Christians has been
[1:08:47] whatever Believers has been every
[1:08:49] believer now is identified with that
[1:08:51] same person whatever it is you must be
[1:08:54] identified don't forget that when you do
[1:08:56] you've got spiritual Amnesia and you've
[1:08:58] forgotten who you are I I don't want us
[1:09:01] to forget Who We Are Tonight I don't
[1:09:03] want you to forget that you are the
[1:09:04] Bride of Jesus Christ when many will
[1:09:06] walk away from this message and many
[1:09:08] will turn their back on this message
[1:09:09] don't let that be you when you young
[1:09:11] people are going to you're going to meet
[1:09:13] obstacle after obstacle and Spirits are
[1:09:15] going to come against you and there's
[1:09:16] going to be all kinds of pretty faces
[1:09:18] that try to turn your head and all kinds
[1:09:20] of things are going to come after you
[1:09:21] why because it's the age we live in but
[1:09:23] don't you fall for the Trap of the de
[1:09:25] identify yourself with an overcoming
[1:09:28] bunch of people tonight identify
[1:09:30] yourself that there will be someone
[1:09:32] without spot or recal in the end time
[1:09:34] that's going to take a stand for
[1:09:35] godliness and take a stand for Holiness
[1:09:37] and take a stand for what's right well I
[1:09:39] need somebody that'll stand up tonight
[1:09:42] and say I'm identified with the word of
[1:09:45] this hour I'm not identified with
[1:09:48] Methodist anymore I'm not identifi with
[1:09:50] Wesley's message or Lutheran's message I
[1:09:52] I but I'm identified with the same
[1:09:55] gospel that was preached by the first
[1:09:56] messenger and it was I tell you what it
[1:09:59] was preached in his fullness and I can
[1:10:01] identify myself there as a true Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost born believer listen we need more
[1:10:06] young people to say I'm not looking to
[1:10:07] the world no more I'm not running to
[1:10:09] movie theaters I'm not running to the
[1:10:11] I'm I tell you what well I'm sorry I
[1:10:14] stepped on somebody's toes but you know
[1:10:15] if we'd spend more time reading the
[1:10:17] message of the hour hearing the message
[1:10:19] of the hour spending time in church we'd
[1:10:21] be a whole lot better off than if we sit
[1:10:23] in a movie theater with all those other
[1:10:25] spirits around us listen I understand
[1:10:27] that that you got to live life and you
[1:10:29] got to live this world that we live in
[1:10:31] but I think we need to set some
[1:10:32] boundaries sometimes and identify
[1:10:35] ourselves as a true Christian born again
[1:10:37] in this
[1:10:39] hour I understand that we got to live
[1:10:41] with the world I understand we got to
[1:10:42] work around the world I understand
[1:10:44] sometimes you got to go to school around
[1:10:45] the world but let me tell you something
[1:10:47] when you rub shoulders with the world
[1:10:49] don't let the world rub off on
[1:10:51] you and when you do feel the complacency
[1:10:54] setting in run back to the house of God
[1:10:57] and get back down to the altar again
[1:10:58] just because you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:11:00] does not mean that you're that you're
[1:11:02] okay no you can get in a cold condition
[1:11:04] again and quit praising God again but
[1:11:07] what you need to do when you start
[1:11:08] feeling that world rub off on you a
[1:11:10] little bit say Lord I'm coming back to
[1:11:12] you because my love is waxed cold for
[1:11:14] you and I want to come back home to
[1:11:16] where you are and say Lord forgive me
[1:11:18] I've done some things that's wrong well
[1:11:19] let me tell you something if you would
[1:11:21] keep the heart of a child that's tender
[1:11:23] A and I tell you what I would say like
[1:11:25] this I think some old people need to say
[1:11:27] Lord tenderize my heart again so when
[1:11:30] wrong comes to me and when there's bad
[1:11:32] thoughts come in my mind I can say Lord
[1:11:34] forgive me immediately quickly run back
[1:11:36] to God and be so in tune with God that
[1:11:39] it's not condemnation that sets in but
[1:11:41] you feel the love of God over and over
[1:11:43] and over again why because he's always
[1:11:45] saying come back home come back into the
[1:11:48] fold you're okay you're coming back
[1:11:50] listen all you got to do is repent and
[1:11:53] move forward and identify yourself right
[1:11:56] back in the position you
[1:11:58] left you you you you're always going to
[1:12:00] find yourself fighting with the world
[1:12:02] you're always going to find yourself out
[1:12:03] here you know rubbing shoulders but let
[1:12:05] me tell you something we are not we are
[1:12:07] not identified as worldly people we are
[1:12:10] not identified as people going through a
[1:12:12] tribulation can you say Amen I'm not
[1:12:14] here for a
[1:12:15] tribulation I'm not here just to just to
[1:12:18] just to say well I believe the message
[1:12:20] and and I'm hoping it gets me out of
[1:12:22] here no I believe it's going to get me
[1:12:23] out of here I'm looking for body change
[1:12:25] I'm not looking for just a another
[1:12:27] another doctrine that come along well
[1:12:29] it's different so we can be different oh
[1:12:30] I'm not here to be different I'm here to
[1:12:32] say I stand for the message of the hour
[1:12:34] and my identity is tied to
[1:12:37] that I'm not here to be different I'm
[1:12:39] not here to just be another Christian
[1:12:41] I'm not here just to just to say well
[1:12:43] well I I I can stand up here a couple
[1:12:45] times a month and and preach to you
[1:12:46] people and I just have a good no no no I
[1:12:48] want to see lives changed I'm not
[1:12:50] satisfied with just service after
[1:12:52] service coming to church I want to see
[1:12:54] Soul SA saved and people filled with the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost that's my desire I I you may
[1:12:59] have to excuse me sometimes I might get
[1:13:01] an error and I might say something I
[1:13:03] shouldn't say and I I'll tell you what
[1:13:04] I'd say forgive me for that because if I
[1:13:06] could do anything I don't want to hurt
[1:13:08] nobody but I want to help people I want
[1:13:10] to see people saved I I want to see
[1:13:13] these young people grow up to be
[1:13:14] preachers I want to see these young
[1:13:15] ladies grow up and have a part in the
[1:13:17] Sunday school or or be young ladies with
[1:13:20] with children in the church and bringing
[1:13:21] their children to church listen I don't
[1:13:23] want to see another generation ation
[1:13:25] lost to people that don't know who they
[1:13:27] are we are identified as Believers and
[1:13:32] let's act like
[1:13:34] Believers I'm not identified with a
[1:13:37] Baptist Church that would say well it's
[1:13:39] okay to smoke and it's okay to drink and
[1:13:41] it's okay no no I'm not okay with that
[1:13:43] I'm not okay with what the world calls
[1:13:44] okay I might be crazy but I'm okay with
[1:13:47] crazy as long as the world calls me
[1:13:48] crazy and I'm okay with god brother BR
[1:13:52] goes on down here he says I gotta get
[1:13:54] way on down here
[1:13:55] he says I was with him when he raised up
[1:13:57] from the dead I come up on Easter
[1:13:59] morning with him in the resurrection
[1:14:02] whatever he did I was right there with
[1:14:04] him every believer was the
[1:14:07] same every one of you you say I want to
[1:14:11] go back and visit that tomb well you
[1:14:12] were already
[1:14:13] there you were there when he raised up
[1:14:16] think about how many people can say that
[1:14:18] not very many not very many people can
[1:14:20] say I was there on Easter morning when
[1:14:21] Jesus got out of the Tomb but we were
[1:14:23] there we were there I you might not be
[1:14:26] able to explain that to me and I can't
[1:14:28] explain it to you but I can tell you
[1:14:30] this I was there I believe in paradoxes
[1:14:33] I I was there brother brand said now he
[1:14:37] said uh he said and now I am seated with
[1:14:39] him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:14:42] with all the powers of Hell conquered
[1:14:44] through him every Christian believer was
[1:14:48] seated the same way because you have to
[1:14:50] be identified and he said now I find
[1:14:52] myself in this last days with the many
[1:14:53] of the believing Christians identified
[1:14:55] in his ministry he is the same yesterday
[1:14:58] today and forever I find myself in this
[1:15:00] day identified in his ministry he said
[1:15:02] you find yourself that way believing it
[1:15:04] walking with it notice the works that he
[1:15:06] did he said the believer would do the
[1:15:07] same thing can you say amen he said the
[1:15:09] works that I do he said then you can be
[1:15:11] identified with him he said then can you
[1:15:13] be identified with him when the reproach
[1:15:15] comes on the word Can You Stand The
[1:15:17] reproach like he did see identify with
[1:15:20] him I was identified with him I was with
[1:15:22] him on the day of Pentecost I was with
[1:15:23] the disciples up there identify with him
[1:15:25] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:15:26] said I wonder if the church hasn't got
[1:15:28] so Amnesia so much now that they don't
[1:15:31] some of them don't even believe there is
[1:15:33] such a thing as the Holy Ghost SE where
[1:15:34] the church has got a very bad case of
[1:15:36] Amnesia they have forgotten that that
[1:15:39] was Jesus Christ back there and they
[1:15:41] have forgotten what Jesus Christ was and
[1:15:43] they have forgotten they thought he was
[1:15:45] just a lawmaker or a prophet or a good
[1:15:47] man they forgot he was God can you say
[1:15:50] Amen they forgot he's the same yesterday
[1:15:52] today and forever and the church has got
[1:15:54] a bad case of spiritual Amnesia they
[1:15:56] have forgotten all these things and they
[1:15:58] don't understand it no more well that's
[1:16:00] the church but I want to say the bride
[1:16:02] has not forgotten who she is the bride
[1:16:05] has not forgotten that you are more than
[1:16:06] able to take the land the the bride has
[1:16:09] not forgotten that every promise in the
[1:16:11] book belongs to us amen right he said he
[1:16:15] said now they they've gotten all these
[1:16:16] things they don't understand it no more
[1:16:18] we must be with the disciples at
[1:16:20] Pentecost identify with him and he goes
[1:16:22] on down and he says now I'm identified
[1:16:24] in the same don't get spiritual Amnesia
[1:16:26] because you will if you will and you'll
[1:16:28] identify yourself with something else
[1:16:30] stay right with that word we was with
[1:16:32] the church when it was commissioned by
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ go into all the world and
[1:16:35] preach the gospel to Every Creature I
[1:16:37] want to be identified there all the
[1:16:39] world to every creature and these signs
[1:16:42] shall follow them that believe can be
[1:16:44] identified in that now listen brother
[1:16:45] Brandon wanted to be identified in that
[1:16:47] commission and I'll say we need to be
[1:16:48] identified in that today when there's
[1:16:50] groups in the message that would say we
[1:16:51] don't need preachers anymore a prophet
[1:16:53] said I want to be identif ified in the
[1:16:56] commission so I'll say it like this I
[1:16:58] want to be identified in that commission
[1:17:01] and if you take me out of that then I
[1:17:02] believeing something else I'm believing
[1:17:04] something wrong and I would say it's
[1:17:05] false Doctrine but I'll say it like this
[1:17:08] I'm not going to be identified outside
[1:17:09] of this message I'm only going to be
[1:17:12] identified in the message that I've
[1:17:14] heard and I I believe it with all my
[1:17:16] heart and if I believe it and I act on
[1:17:19] it I heard a brother say like this if if
[1:17:21] I'm in tune with the fashion move of the
[1:17:23] hour I'll tell you what that how could I
[1:17:25] stay here when every time God moved that
[1:17:28] then the pillar of fire moved and and
[1:17:29] the people would move with it then I
[1:17:31] want to be I want to be identify with
[1:17:33] those people that were with the pillar
[1:17:34] of fire back in the old days why because
[1:17:37] that same Pillar of Fire has proven to
[1:17:39] be here in this hour and so if I could
[1:17:41] if they were identified with a pillar of
[1:17:42] fire and it would lead them to the
[1:17:44] promised land then what will the pillar
[1:17:45] of fire do for
[1:17:47] us it'll lead you all the way home don't
[1:17:51] get amnesia don't get to thinking you
[1:17:53] don't know who you are just because the
[1:17:55] devil fights you and tells you you ain't
[1:17:56] good enough don't be letting the devil
[1:17:58] beat you up he don't even know he he
[1:17:59] don't even know who he is he's been cast
[1:18:01] down and beat up so much he knows I'm
[1:18:03] here to torment but but you know what I
[1:18:05] have no power but he starts tormenting
[1:18:07] people why because people listen to him
[1:18:09] he has no power over you if you won't
[1:18:11] listen to him can you say amen he has no
[1:18:15] power over you he's only got power if
[1:18:17] you let him have
[1:18:19] power brother B said it like this he
[1:18:21] said uh now you're identified with that
[1:18:23] or you've got spiritual amnesia you find
[1:18:25] out you don't believe those signs follow
[1:18:26] the Believers if you don't believe it
[1:18:28] then you've got spiritual Amnesia can
[1:18:29] you say Amen tonight he said you've
[1:18:31] forgotten that Pro God promised that and
[1:18:34] these signs shall follow them don't
[1:18:35] forget it you can't forget it and be a
[1:18:37] Christian yes sir amen I'll say that
[1:18:40] again you can't forget it and be a
[1:18:42] Christian this is in the midst of
[1:18:43] spiritual Amnesia you can't forget and
[1:18:45] be a Christian you must be identified
[1:18:47] with it you must be identified with St
[1:18:49] John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse
[1:18:51] he that believeth with me the works that
[1:18:52] I do shall he do also don't for forget
[1:18:55] it if you do then you've got spiritual
[1:18:56] Amnesia and you have forgotten who you
[1:18:59] are you've forgotten what your testimony
[1:19:01] means how about he said if you abide in
[1:19:03] me my word in you you can ask what you
[1:19:05] will and it shall be done are you
[1:19:06] identified there to believe that that is
[1:19:09] the truth Mark 11 when he said if you
[1:19:11] stay to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:19:12] doubt in your heart but believe he said
[1:19:14] then you have said will come to pass you
[1:19:17] can have what you've said and can you
[1:19:19] can you be identified there to believe
[1:19:21] that this is the truth now he asked that
[1:19:23] question and I would would like to ask
[1:19:25] us that tonight can we truly be
[1:19:27] identified in the word that we have been
[1:19:29] taught and so Faithfully given in this
[1:19:32] hour I I think it's time we we quit
[1:19:34] trying to find out if we're Thunders or
[1:19:36] return Ministry or this Doctrine or that
[1:19:38] Doctrine no let's let's just put all
[1:19:39] those things off to the side and just
[1:19:41] come back to the Simplicity that I am a
[1:19:44] true born again Christian and if you're
[1:19:46] trying to get me to follow after this
[1:19:48] man or that man then you can just leave
[1:19:50] me alone because I'm following after the
[1:19:52] fashion move of the hour and that is the
[1:19:54] Holy Ghost move of the hour that is the
[1:19:56] message that has been brought by a
[1:19:57] Vindicated Prophet now I'm not
[1:19:59] Vindicated I can't stand here and say
[1:20:01] well the prophet didn't he wasn't right
[1:20:03] here so so we'll just change a little
[1:20:04] bit and go this way no no I don't have
[1:20:06] the authority by the word of God to do
[1:20:08] that but what I can do is stand here and
[1:20:11] be identified with the word and say if
[1:20:13] the word says it you can be identified
[1:20:16] in it and it will come to pass because
[1:20:19] the word is always
[1:20:21] true you don't have to worry about the
[1:20:23] word being true it's always been true
[1:20:25] and it will always be true now brother
[1:20:27] bam said now you forget he said you lose
[1:20:29] your Christian balance you can't tell
[1:20:30] where you belong you say I'm a Methodist
[1:20:32] I'm a Baptist that's what I know about
[1:20:34] it I'm a Pentecostal I'm this that or
[1:20:35] the other he said watch out that might
[1:20:38] may that might mean the disease sign is
[1:20:40] showing on you that you've got some
[1:20:42] spiritual Amnesia you say well brother
[1:20:44] brandom I believe this and and I don't
[1:20:46] hardly he said just wait a minute if God
[1:20:48] promise to do these things and said they
[1:20:50] would be in the last day and your Creed
[1:20:52] will keep you from it that's a good sign
[1:20:54] I can see the disease sign on you he
[1:20:56] said you have forgotten to identify
[1:20:58] yourself with the word you say I don't
[1:21:00] believe that the sick are healed you've
[1:21:02] got spiritual Amnesia you see I don't
[1:21:04] believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:05] spiritual Amnesia I don't believe that
[1:21:07] God promised these things in the last
[1:21:09] days he said you've listened to a Creed
[1:21:11] or some Doctrine instead of the Bible
[1:21:13] you've got spiritual Amnesia well can
[1:21:15] you say amen I I I tell you what tonight
[1:21:17] let's not get in this this complacency
[1:21:19] place and let the message become common
[1:21:21] to us because if you do that you've got
[1:21:24] spirit Amnesia and you don't even know
[1:21:26] who you are you can't recognize who you
[1:21:28] are or your place in the scripture but
[1:21:31] he said you don't know where you do
[1:21:32] belong you're confessing a Christian and
[1:21:34] denying the word and that brings you
[1:21:35] right back to spiritual Amnesia again he
[1:21:37] said you don't know where you stand you
[1:21:39] got spiritual Amnesia you can't identify
[1:21:41] yourself with the scriptures you have to
[1:21:44] be with the disciples you have to be
[1:21:45] with all scripture with the church when
[1:21:47] it's commissioned but now when the
[1:21:49] church was commissioned he said he said
[1:21:51] that was her commission going into all
[1:21:52] the world and preach the gospel he said
[1:21:54] said but now he said they have forgotten
[1:21:56] and have a bad case of spiritual amnesia
[1:21:59] amnesia just like Eve got he said and
[1:22:02] through the garden one day now she is
[1:22:04] like Israel suffering from the same
[1:22:06] disease and Allergy from a seminary
[1:22:09] diet an allergy from a seminary diet
[1:22:12] that will give you spiritual Amnesia I I
[1:22:15] tell you there's a failure to
[1:22:16] intellectual Faith Brother David there's
[1:22:17] a failure to intellectual Faith
[1:22:19] intellectual faith will question every
[1:22:21] word of God when real genuine faith will
[1:22:23] believe every word of God God and what
[1:22:25] you'll find is intellectual Faith
[1:22:26] will'll say well was brother Brandon
[1:22:28] guessing it or or or maybe this was
[1:22:30] wrong or this was right let me tell you
[1:22:31] what the message is the message is an
[1:22:33] actual Vindication and a revealing of
[1:22:35] Jesus Christ in this hour and a real
[1:22:37] believer will say Amen to it I know you
[1:22:39] find Critics on the internet and they'll
[1:22:41] say well I I don't necessar I don't
[1:22:43] believe it because he missed this and he
[1:22:44] missed that and they wasn't even there
[1:22:46] and they have no proof but there's
[1:22:48] always going to be CR there's always
[1:22:49] going to be critics think about Jesus's
[1:22:52] day how many of them believed on Jesus
[1:22:54] not very many because they were
[1:22:56] intellectual Believers and in this day
[1:22:59] if you're an intellectual believer
[1:23:00] you'll never find yourself in the
[1:23:02] scriptures intellectual people will will
[1:23:05] will take this part of the word and
[1:23:06] they'll they they'll plot it against
[1:23:08] this part of the word and well we got to
[1:23:09] we got to take this part out because
[1:23:11] it's not inspired and we'll take this
[1:23:13] part over here because it fits our ideas
[1:23:15] and our intellectual ideas listen to me
[1:23:17] if you get an intellectual faith you'll
[1:23:19] never see this message
[1:23:21] correctly you might be smart in the
[1:23:23] message you might know what it says you
[1:23:25] might think you know what it says you
[1:23:27] might even think you you you have a full
[1:23:29] revelation of it but if all you've got
[1:23:31] is an intellectual Faith the devil can
[1:23:33] talk you out of this so fast that your
[1:23:35] head will
[1:23:36] spin we're not here for an intellectual
[1:23:38] Faith or an intellectual talk but what
[1:23:40] we're here for tonight is let the word
[1:23:42] of God penetrate the hearts of the
[1:23:43] Believers let the word of God change
[1:23:45] your life let the word of God come in
[1:23:47] there and do the work it was intended to
[1:23:49] do in your life personally well that's
[1:23:52] what I want I need the word of God to
[1:23:53] change me and I know there's some young
[1:23:55] people that's going to fight some devils
[1:23:57] and they need the word of God to change
[1:23:59] them I know I I know that to be true uh
[1:24:02] some of you remember when you were young
[1:24:04] a few of you do everybody but my mama
[1:24:07] remembers when they was
[1:24:09] young she
[1:24:12] forgot but think about it some of you
[1:24:15] young people are going through things
[1:24:16] that some of you have never been through
[1:24:19] sir and never will go through I know you
[1:24:21] think you've been there and you think
[1:24:22] you've done that but if you're if you
[1:24:24] were raised in the 30s 40s and 50s you
[1:24:26] really don't have a
[1:24:28] clue that hurt somebody I'm sorry let me
[1:24:31] tell you something though you didn't
[1:24:33] have the devil at the in your pocket
[1:24:35] like you do
[1:24:36] now you didn't have
[1:24:39] it you didn't have that you you didn't
[1:24:41] well come on somebody some of you even
[1:24:43] remember when ladies out in public
[1:24:45] actually dressed halfway decent that's
[1:24:46] not the case
[1:24:48] today I know it was the same devil it
[1:24:51] was the same devil that tempted you and
[1:24:52] it's the same devil tempting them but
[1:24:54] he's he's come up with different ways
[1:24:56] because there was some people that
[1:24:57] overcome the first time well we got to
[1:24:58] make it even more cunning we got to make
[1:25:01] it more deceptive listen that's the way
[1:25:02] it is you young people listen to me the
[1:25:04] devil's going to come with in ways you
[1:25:06] didn't even think he would come that's
[1:25:07] right because he's deceptive it well I
[1:25:10] need a phone because I you know I go to
[1:25:12] school and my parents have to get a hold
[1:25:13] of me and that may be a legit reason but
[1:25:15] listen on that phone has an access to
[1:25:18] everything the devil's
[1:25:20] got and I just said that because I don't
[1:25:22] know why because it's not in my notes
[1:25:25] maybe I'll put it in there for next time
[1:25:27] but listen that that's the that's the
[1:25:28] traps of the devil but if you'll
[1:25:30] identify yourself at a young age with
[1:25:32] with
[1:25:33] Believers then then you'll recognize
[1:25:35] when the devil's coming after you I'm
[1:25:37] almost done I promise I I promise I'm
[1:25:39] almost done I'm closing it's just a long
[1:25:45] close you've got to be identified with
[1:25:47] Christ and his life is living in you
[1:25:50] that's when you're identified with
[1:25:51] Christ as when Christ lives in you
[1:25:54] how simple is that you want to be
[1:25:56] identified tonight then you need to be
[1:25:58] identified with Christ because he you
[1:26:00] need him inside of you and you say well
[1:26:03] I don't have the Holy Ghost well I I'd
[1:26:05] say it's a good time to get it it's a
[1:26:07] good time to get it and if you've been
[1:26:09] if you've been cold in your experience
[1:26:11] and you feel like you've gotten a little
[1:26:13] I tell you when you start getting when
[1:26:14] the fruits of the spirit are not showing
[1:26:16] up anymore you need to go back and get a
[1:26:18] refilling of the Holy Ghost when Joy is
[1:26:21] not there like it used to be get a ref
[1:26:24] of the Holy Ghost when peace is nowhere
[1:26:26] to be found get a refilling of the Holy
[1:26:28] Ghost well can you say man that's what
[1:26:30] we need tonight more than anything is a
[1:26:32] refilling of the Holy Ghost you say well
[1:26:34] I've got the Holy Ghost no you need a
[1:26:35] refilling tonight when when when when
[1:26:37] your attitude just so bad nobody wants
[1:26:38] to be around you just get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:40] that's a sweet Spirit that'll follow you
[1:26:42] that's a dove likee Spirit you say well
[1:26:44] I've had a bad day well we all have bad
[1:26:47] days but we need a refilling of the Holy
[1:26:50] Ghost I want to say this in closing for
[1:26:53] real this time
[1:26:54] I'm identified with a group that knows
[1:26:56] he's unveiled that knows he's the same
[1:26:58] yesterday today and forever that knows
[1:27:00] that this is not a fanaticism it's Jesus
[1:27:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:27:04] forever I'm identified with that group
[1:27:06] here tonight yet they're called a bunch
[1:27:08] of Heretics a bunch of fanaticism on
[1:27:11] account of the word of God but I'm not
[1:27:13] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:27:15] for it's the power of God un salvation
[1:27:18] and I'm one I and I'm one I'm I'm with
[1:27:22] them living Epistles and I I and a
[1:27:24] Vindicated God veiled in human form in
[1:27:27] men and women can you say Amen tonight
[1:27:29] if our musicians would come my time is
[1:27:31] up I want to say this tonight if you if
[1:27:33] you feel cold if you're having a hard
[1:27:36] time finding yourself in the scriptures

[1:27:39] you need to find yourself back in the
[1:27:41] scriptures again well well I I I'm I'm

[1:27:49] that find a person in the Bible who was
[1:27:51] healed put yourself in their position
