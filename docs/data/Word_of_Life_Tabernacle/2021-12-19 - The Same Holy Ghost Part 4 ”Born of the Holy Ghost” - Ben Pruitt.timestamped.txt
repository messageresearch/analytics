[5:26] no service on wednesday night as well as
[5:28] you spend time with your families this
[5:29] week
[5:30] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[5:32] this wise
[5:33] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[5:36] joseph before they came together
[5:38] she was found with child
[5:41] of the holy ghost
[5:43] then joseph her husband being a just man
[5:46] and not willing to make her a public
[5:47] example was minded to put her away
[5:50] privately while he thought on these
[5:53] things behold the angel of the lord
[5:55] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[5:56] joseph thou son of david fear not to
[6:00] take unto thee mary thy wife
[6:02] for that which is conceived in her
[6:05] is of the holy ghost i want to tell you
[6:08] this this morning as
[6:09] we think about these things
[6:11] what has been conceived in your life
[6:14] even if you've just been saved you've
[6:17] just given your heart to the lord maybe
[6:19] you have a long ways to go to experience
[6:22] the full birth of the word and and to
[6:24] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:26] but let me tell you this that which is
[6:28] conceived in you
[6:30] is of the holy ghost
[6:32] amen amen god bless you today you may be
[6:34] seated
[6:40] someone wrote this i thought it was good
[6:43] the people of that time that first
[6:45] christmas time were being heavily taxed
[6:49] faced every prospect of a sharp increase
[6:51] to cover expanding military expenses
[6:54] they had a threat of world domination by
[6:56] a cruel ungodly power intoxicated band
[7:00] of men it was at just below the
[7:02] threshold of consciousness
[7:04] moral deterioration had corrupted the
[7:06] upper levels of society and was moving
[7:09] rapidly into the broad base of the
[7:11] population
[7:12] intense nationalistic feeling was
[7:15] clashing openly with new
[7:17] forms of imperialism
[7:19] conformity was the spirit of the age
[7:22] government handouts were being used with
[7:24] increasing lavishness to keep the
[7:26] population from rising up and throwing
[7:28] out the leaders
[7:30] interest rates were spiraling upward in
[7:32] the midst of an inflated economy
[7:35] external religious observance were
[7:37] considered a political asset
[7:39] abnormal emphasis was being placed upon
[7:42] sports and athletic competition
[7:44] racial tensions were at the breaking
[7:46] point
[7:47] but it was in such a time and amid such
[7:50] a people what sounds like today doesn't
[7:52] it
[7:53] it was in such a time and amid such a
[7:55] people that a child was born to a
[7:58] migrant couple who had just signed up
[8:00] for a fresh round of taxation and who
[8:03] were soon to become political exiles and
[8:06] the child who was born was called among
[8:08] other things
[8:10] emmanuel god
[8:13] with us
[8:15] you see as we look at this time of the
[8:18] year and we see people talking about a
[8:20] baby in a manger but him being there was
[8:23] not an impulsive act of a god who was
[8:26] scrambling
[8:27] to find a way to somehow fix the world
[8:30] that had broken
[8:32] but it was actually before there was
[8:34] ever a sin
[8:35] before there had ever been a fall before
[8:38] there had ever been a reality of being
[8:40] away from the presence of god or before
[8:43] even anything was created god already
[8:46] knew how he would become flesh he had
[8:49] already planned in fact the bible tells
[8:51] us that he was crucified before
[8:54] the foundation of the earth and so god
[8:57] had created in his own mind himself a
[9:00] body for the purpose of redemption and
[9:03] fellowship and so brother branham says
[9:05] this about it he said today when they
[9:07] try to make him just a philosopher or a
[9:10] teacher he said it just boils me
[9:13] well that boils me to day two that gets
[9:15] my temperature up when i try to make him
[9:17] just a philosopher or a teacher he was
[9:20] emmanuel
[9:22] hallelujah god created himself a body a
[9:27] son
[9:28] amen and came down and dwelt in that
[9:31] body god in
[9:33] christ
[9:35] amen he was the bible tells us in
[9:37] revelation 3 and 14 the beginning of the
[9:40] creation of god
[9:43] he is the beginning of the creation of
[9:46] god but the bible also says in ephesians
[9:48] ephesians 2 and 10
[9:50] we are his workmanship
[9:54] don't get down on yourself for the way
[9:56] you're made up and especially as you've
[9:59] received the holy ghost and you come to
[10:01] the house of god many times we get down
[10:03] on ourselves and you say well i wish i
[10:05] could be like so and so i wish i could
[10:07] be more like a brother so and so he
[10:08] seems to be so spiritual see we are his
[10:12] workmanship really what you're doing if
[10:14] you claim to have the baptism of the
[10:16] holy ghost and you claim that he's
[10:17] working in your life you're really down
[10:19] on him because the bible says we are a
[10:21] new creation i know that there's still a
[10:23] sticky nature on the outside and many of
[10:26] the things that were passed on to us
[10:28] from our from our family still
[10:30] represents itself in that sticky nature
[10:32] but if you have the holy ghost this
[10:34] morning and i trust that you do there is
[10:36] a controlling tower on the inside
[10:39] there's something on the inside that
[10:41] overrides that thing
[10:43] to the effect that we never have to give
[10:46] in we don't ever have to give up we
[10:48] don't ever have to let the flesh dictate
[10:51] to the spirit what our lives are going
[10:53] to be
[10:54] amen so don't get down on yourself quit
[10:56] making excuses because of your sticky
[10:59] nature because there's something on the
[11:01] inside that overrides that a creation a
[11:04] new creation of god we are his
[11:06] workmanship
[11:07] created in christ jesus can you imagine
[11:10] a man walking into a shop and here the
[11:13] the artist has placed all of his
[11:15] sculptures on display and you walk in
[11:17] there and you just start to criticize
[11:19] them you begin to look down on them and
[11:21] you begin to say well that that he's not
[11:23] much of an artist what are you doing
[11:25] when you when you put down the art
[11:27] you're putting down the artist
[11:31] i hope you're hearing me today when you
[11:33] talk about the art you're talking about
[11:35] the artist
[11:36] when you run your mouth about the art
[11:38] you are running your mouth about the
[11:40] artist quit spending all your time
[11:42] looking around and seeing how bad god's
[11:44] workmanship is and let him begin to work
[11:47] on your life
[11:49] are you with me this morning
[11:52] god we are his workmanship he we are
[11:54] created in christ jesus unto good works
[11:57] which god hath before ordained that we
[11:59] should walk in them
[12:02] amen now how did god create i want to
[12:04] look at that that this morning
[12:07] the bible says in the beginning god
[12:08] created the heaven and the earth
[12:11] period
[12:12] and then in verse 2 and the earth was
[12:14] without form
[12:15] and void
[12:17] and darkness was upon the face of the
[12:19] deep and the spirit of god
[12:22] moved we could say the holy ghost
[12:25] brother branham calls it the anointing
[12:26] the logos the light
[12:29] the spirit of god moved
[12:32] upon the face
[12:34] of the waters
[12:36] and god said let there be light
[12:41] and there was light
[12:44] now you'll find in that word moved and
[12:46] i've brought this to you before but i
[12:48] want to remind you of it today that in
[12:50] deuteronomy 32 and 11 where it says as
[12:53] an eagle stirs up her nest
[12:55] uttereth over her young
[12:57] spreadeth abroad her wings taketh and
[12:59] beareth him on her wings that word
[13:00] fluttereth is the same word that's in
[13:03] genesis 1 2 has moved
[13:06] moved it's actually moving in the nest
[13:10] fluttering in the nest i got to looking
[13:13] at that and i began to look at the
[13:15] the tactics that eagles use to keep
[13:17] their young
[13:18] to bring them to a birth
[13:20] and actually what they do you know the
[13:22] little eagle he's an eagle to begin with
[13:24] but the mother eagle and the father
[13:26] eagle have to take care of him to cause
[13:29] him to come to a birth if he's left by
[13:31] himself he'll never come to a birth
[13:34] you just think about that and say there
[13:36] had to be an eagle created at some point
[13:39] to bring the rest of the eagles to the
[13:40] birth
[13:42] amen well that's just the way it is
[13:44] spiritually as well
[13:46] but here now the mother and the father
[13:47] eagle build a nest and and they and the
[13:50] mother lays the eggs there in the nest
[13:51] usually too and they'll lay them there
[13:54] in the in the nest and actually they
[13:56] there is a constant movement in the nest
[13:59] it's not as still as what we think it is
[14:01] they actually keep it at a temperature
[14:03] of about 105 degrees fahrenheit and and
[14:07] they have to keep it hot and even
[14:09] and this just really struck me even the
[14:11] eagle will will pluck out its own
[14:13] feathers
[14:14] until there's a bare spot on its breast
[14:17] it's called a brood patch because what
[14:19] it does is trying to get the egg closer
[14:22] to the
[14:23] oh my to the internal heat of the mama
[14:26] eagle don't you realize that god plucked
[14:29] out his own feathers
[14:31] came down among human beings that that
[14:34] were little little lonely little eggs so
[14:36] didn't even know anything about him he
[14:38] come down among us
[14:40] so the heat of god's presence would be
[14:43] closer to us so he could brood over us
[14:47] or aren't you glad he did that for you
[14:50] amen
[14:52] and
[14:53] so
[14:54] here they actually what i want to
[14:56] emphasize this morning is that there's
[14:57] movement in the nest
[14:59] that it's not just a still
[15:02] place with heat but there's movement
[15:04] every two hours the eagle will take the
[15:07] egg and we're actually being careful not
[15:10] to puncture
[15:11] the fragile walls of the egg it'll
[15:14] actually turn it every two hours
[15:16] because otherwise the the embryo would
[15:19] actually stick to the side of the egg
[15:22] or it would not it would be cold on one
[15:24] side and hot on the other
[15:26] and you realize sometimes you think well
[15:28] why is what's happening why is it
[15:30] happening in my life why am i going
[15:32] through what i'm going through when
[15:33] you're just being turned in the nest
[15:36] right you're just being turned in the
[15:38] nest you say well brother ben i have the
[15:40] holy ghost i'm i'm a foreborn christian
[15:42] but you still have that sticky nature
[15:44] you still are living a body of flesh you
[15:47] still have to struggle with this flesh
[15:49] we are in one sense we we are saved we
[15:52] have been saved or already at calvary
[15:55] we are we were saved before the
[15:56] foundation of the earth for that matter
[15:58] we are being
[16:00] saved that we have been saved we are
[16:02] being saved and we will be saved because
[16:05] one day this body is going to be changed
[16:08] right and that's the fullness of
[16:09] adoption in our bodies is going to come
[16:11] to fruition at some point but you find
[16:14] then that
[16:15] that well you're in the nest and you
[16:16] begin to while we're in this world we we
[16:19] begin to feel movement and we think well
[16:21] if if god would just leave me alone for
[16:23] a while if he would just allow me to sit
[16:25] back and
[16:26] i could heal i could i could i could
[16:28] learn i could do something no he wants
[16:30] movement because he realizes that as
[16:33] you're going through life if you don't
[16:34] have some movement you're actually going
[16:37] to die in the nest
[16:39] and so he'll let things go be hard on
[16:42] you he'll let trials come your way why
[16:44] because he wants that movement to come
[16:46] in your life
[16:49] now he brews he fluttereth he moves in
[16:52] the nest he doesn't just
[16:53] he doesn't just sit quietly but if
[16:56] you'll watch an eagle or even a hen for
[16:58] that matter it's constant
[17:00] movement they're constantly shifting
[17:02] in the nest
[17:04] now the holy spirit is the atmosphere
[17:08] that brings the word
[17:10] to life how many believe that this
[17:11] morning
[17:14] now
[17:15] none of god's creation can have life
[17:19] without it
[17:21] we absolutely must have
[17:23] the holy spirit in our midst
[17:26] and in our own lives to be able to have
[17:29] life
[17:30] and that starts even before the token
[17:33] even before when you were first called
[17:35] by god it was the holy spirit calling
[17:38] you
[17:39] amen i hope you can see that today
[17:41] brother branham even talked about it
[17:42] being the holy spirit with your
[17:44] methodist grandmother he said or your
[17:46] pentecostal grandmother and you think
[17:48] well they didn't have nothing but they
[17:49] had the holy spirit
[17:52] even though they may not have known what
[17:53] to call it
[17:55] right but it was the whole same holy
[17:57] ghost brother random says that we have
[17:58] today but it's just in a different stage
[18:01] of the of the grain you understand now
[18:04] we have the fullness of it now
[18:06] we are the created children of god
[18:10] you know what that means
[18:12] we have a father
[18:20] some of you
[18:22] didn't have much of a father
[18:24] some of you had good fathers some of you
[18:26] are good fathers
[18:28] some of you didn't have much of a father
[18:31] but we have
[18:33] a father
[18:35] i want to and i got
[18:37] sometimes i get lost in these quotes and
[18:39] sometimes we'll just pull a little bit
[18:40] out of it you don't really see the
[18:42] breadth of what brother branham is
[18:43] talking about but
[18:44] he talks about this and and he says did
[18:47] you ever notice
[18:48] jesus said when he cast out a devil
[18:51] he done it with his finger
[18:53] if jesus said if i cast out devils the
[18:56] with the finger of god he said see what
[18:59] a devil is to him
[19:02] amen he said well my i got there's
[19:04] devils there's devils attacking me
[19:06] there's devils attacking my children he
[19:08] cast that out with his finger
[19:11] with his finger
[19:12] he said see what a devil is to him for
[19:14] healing it's just a little thing but
[19:17] watch when his sheep is lost he said
[19:19] what did he do he went and got the sheep
[19:22] and put it on his shoulders
[19:24] what's the strongest part of the man he
[19:27] said his back and his legs he said see
[19:29] the devil's nothing to him
[19:31] amen oh i hope we can recognize that
[19:33] today the devil is nothing to him he
[19:36] just puts him away with his finger cast
[19:39] him out with his finger but when it
[19:40] comes to the sheep he puts it across his
[19:43] shoulders and hold its feet
[19:46] and he packs it with the strongness of
[19:48] his body
[19:50] amen you're not held
[19:52] by his finger but you're held by the
[19:55] strength of his body
[19:59] oh that ought to make a bad dish out
[20:03] how to make somebody in hardy arkansas
[20:05] excited
[20:07] hey man even at christmas time when the
[20:09] world is in a doom and a gloom and
[20:11] wondering how they're going to pay off
[20:12] the credit cards that they spent way too
[20:14] much money on gifts for people that'll
[20:16] throw them in a corner somewhere they're
[20:18] wondering how they do it but even during
[20:19] that time it ought to make people happy
[20:21] to know that you're carried in the
[20:23] strength of god
[20:26] hallelujah
[20:28] so he said he packs it with the
[20:29] strongness of his body till he gets it
[20:31] back to the fold god
[20:33] loves his children
[20:37] he said well that's not very hard
[20:40] we wanted something harder don't get
[20:41] used to getting beat up
[20:44] god loves his children
[20:48] yeah we ought to get beat up sometimes
[20:50] but make sure it's by the word
[20:53] but don't just become an abused spouse
[20:54] gets used to being beat up god loves his
[20:57] children
[21:00] amen
[21:01] hallelujah he said now how did he get
[21:03] them this is a continuation of the quote
[21:05] he said the holy spirit went forth and
[21:07] brooded over the earth how did he get
[21:10] them
[21:11] how did they become children the holy
[21:12] spirit went forth and brooded over the
[21:15] earth in other words we could say it
[21:16] this way how did he bring them to
[21:18] manifestation
[21:19] the holy spirit went forth and brooded
[21:21] over the earth and as the he says as it
[21:25] went
[21:26] cooing he says he began brooding cooing
[21:29] he said let's just say for the talk's
[21:30] sake he was calling cooing like the
[21:33] evening dove when she set him
[21:35] cooing to her mate and as he begins to
[21:38] coo over nothing but a bleached desert
[21:40] of volcanic eruption he said look coming
[21:43] down the hill there i see some polish
[21:45] begin to move over with some calcium i
[21:47] notice again he said the strange thing a
[21:49] little moisture and petroleum begin to
[21:51] run together
[21:53] and right from under a little rock a
[21:55] little easter flower raised up its head
[21:57] life come on the earth
[22:00] and it
[22:01] screams
[22:06] did you know that the holy ghost was a
[22:08] worshiper yeah
[22:10] sure oh the prophet of god as he's
[22:14] drawing this drama for us he's showing
[22:15] us this picture life come on the earth
[22:18] and the holy ghost screamed
[22:21] said come father
[22:22] look at this
[22:25] all it was was the easter flower by the
[22:27] game
[22:28] it wasn't finished
[22:30] i hope your children are hearing me
[22:31] today don't get discouraged about where
[22:33] you're at
[22:35] because you aren't finished yet
[22:38] the old songs that he's still working on
[22:40] me
[22:41] he's not finished with you yet
[22:43] just an easter flower under a rock just
[22:46] a barren landscape it looked like
[22:48] something had come and just bombed it
[22:50] out it was just a void nothing there to
[22:53] it but the holy spirit began to coo over
[22:55] that certain spot under that rock there
[22:57] come a little flower and he screamed out
[22:59] and he said come father look at this
[23:03] amen
[23:05] oh i think it ought to make us happy to
[23:06] see even the slightest movement towards
[23:09] god
[23:10] you realize how many people don't move
[23:12] towards god at all
[23:14] how many people don't want nothing to do
[23:16] with god you say brother man i've made
[23:18] mistakes i've struggled i've done things
[23:20] that are wrong do you realize how many
[23:22] people never had the desire that you do
[23:24] to go to church they never had the
[23:26] desire that you do to hear the message
[23:27] of the hour never had the desire that
[23:29] you do to love god with all of your
[23:30] heart they never wanted it
[23:33] how many people never did want to see
[23:35] god never did want to come to god but
[23:38] you there was something placed on the
[23:39] inside of you before the foundation of
[23:42] the world that brought you directly to
[23:44] the house of god we ought to be excited
[23:46] about every sign of life
[23:48] we ought to be like the holy spirit that
[23:50] runs around and says look father
[23:53] amen there's a sign of life
[23:55] i see god begin to move
[23:58] amen
[24:00] go around critical well everybody in the
[24:01] church is dead will you be the sign of
[24:04] life
[24:05] that the holy ghost can come by and
[24:07] scream father look at this
[24:12] amen
[24:17] i wish i was 100 pounds lighter
[24:19] we'd really preach that
[24:22] notice
[24:23] you know wishing won't do it will it
[24:26] [Laughter]
[24:30] now
[24:32] he said god the father
[24:35] looks it over
[24:37] and said that's very pretty
[24:39] just keep on cooing
[24:42] hallelujah
[24:44] you realize that's how he looks at you
[24:47] you're the creation of god
[24:49] this is how he creates is by his holy
[24:51] spirit notice in the beginning but the
[24:53] man said the holy spirit began to brood
[24:55] over a bleak desert
[24:57] he said excuse my emotions but when
[24:59] there was nothing
[25:00] had never been nothing
[25:02] but the holy spirit was sent from god
[25:05] not an intellectual
[25:08] you don't brood by intellectualism
[25:14] i hope you're hearing me you mothers
[25:15] don't take care of your babies
[25:17] intellectually
[25:20] you do it emotionally
[25:23] and i hope you're hearing me this
[25:25] morning you don't brood over your child
[25:26] you don't take care of your children
[25:28] intellectually in fact even before
[25:30] they're born many times there's things
[25:32] that you desire and you want it's not an
[25:34] intellectual thing it's not because
[25:36] you've planned it all out and you've got
[25:37] it all like sometimes we do i know my
[25:39] wife had the baby book and all those
[25:40] things but we try to plan it all out and
[25:42] sometimes there's something that seems
[25:44] irrational why does mama want that
[25:46] because it's not an intellectual thing a
[25:48] birth is actually an emotional thing
[25:52] if you can put it you take care of them
[25:53] from compassion not from intellectual
[25:56] because intellectuals might say well
[25:57] leave the baby crying in the crib it'll
[25:59] be okay but brother branham taught us
[26:01] not to do that
[26:04] not that you could never let him cry for
[26:06] a minute but brother branham taught us
[26:07] not to just let him scream and cry he
[26:09] said take care of them show them love
[26:11] now why would a prophet care about that
[26:13] it's showing us something spiritually
[26:15] god's caring for us he's cooing to us
[26:17] it's not an intellectual conversation
[26:20] that we're having with heaven it's not a
[26:22] contract it's not us agreeing to certain
[26:25] things and god agreeing to certain
[26:26] things and when we get it all agreed to
[26:28] because we've got it all right then then
[26:30] we're going to make it in the rapture
[26:32] that's not what it is at all it's not an
[26:34] intellectual conversation
[26:36] [Music]
[26:37] how many of you are married
[26:40] good number of you now look how many of
[26:43] you had an intellectual conversation
[26:44] with your wife before you got married
[26:47] think about this
[26:49] some of you couldn't have an
[26:50] intellectual conversation if you tried
[26:54] i'm one of you
[26:56] but you don't have intellectual
[26:58] conversations
[27:00] in fact they seem silly to people that
[27:02] listen
[27:04] in i won't embarrass our engaged couple
[27:07] this morning but there's perhaps others
[27:09] of you that have unintellectual
[27:11] conversations
[27:14] huh
[27:15] you just walked up to somebody and said
[27:17] will you marry me
[27:19] i got three houses and
[27:21] three jobs and
[27:23] you looked like you'd make a good wife
[27:26] will you marry me if you agree and sign
[27:28] the contract will not no you don't have
[27:30] an intellectual conversation
[27:32] what do you do you get down on one knee
[27:35] will you marry me
[27:38] the hardest moment of your life your
[27:39] hearts are fluttering there's emotions
[27:41] involved in it
[27:43] you're not having an intellectual
[27:44] conversation
[27:46] those late night telephone calls if you
[27:48] were allowed to have them
[27:53] whether you probably had them whether
[27:54] you were allowed to or not
[27:58] it's not an intellectual
[28:00] conversation hope you hear me we don't
[28:02] deal with god by intellectuals
[28:04] he don't brood over us by intellectuals
[28:07] he don't come and brood over us by
[28:08] intellectuals it's with understanding
[28:11] but but not by intellectualism but it's
[28:13] the brooding of the holy spirit he is
[28:15] making love that's the way brother
[28:17] branham put it to his church
[28:22] brooding and cooling over it
[28:25] he says the holy spirit was sent from
[28:26] the presence of god to make love over
[28:28] the earth and as it was he stretched his
[28:30] big wings around the earth and began to
[28:32] make love or to brood cool over the
[28:34] earth he said i can see calcium and
[28:36] potash coming together and a little
[28:38] easterly stood up
[28:40] the holy spirit brooded out of the earth
[28:45] and he kept brooding and as he cooed and
[28:47] brood he said i began to see trees come
[28:49] up birds begin to fly from the earth
[28:52] animals begin to walk and then he kept
[28:54] cooing and a man came up called adam
[28:57] think for a moment if you had caught
[28:59] that in the middle of it somehow
[29:02] and maybe just right after that one
[29:04] easter lily was there under the rock
[29:06] and you heard a screaming and shouting
[29:09] god rejoicing over his his creation
[29:13] you might have looked at it and said
[29:14] there's no reason to shout
[29:16] there's no reason to be excited
[29:18] because there's nothing but baroness i
[29:20] don't see anything good but see when he
[29:22] saw the very first thing he's already
[29:24] seen it in his mind completed it's just
[29:26] as good as if it's completed the moment
[29:29] you gave your life to christ it was just
[29:31] as good as if yes you have to go through
[29:32] the process yes you'll feel the birth
[29:34] yes you'll you'll go through that you've
[29:36] got to you can't have a birth and not
[29:38] know it but from the very moment he knew
[29:40] who you were
[29:42] he knew all about it and he and he
[29:44] rejoiced over you
[29:47] amen
[29:49] now i'm not preaching that because some
[29:51] joel osteen kind of thing preaching that
[29:54] because a prophet taught it
[29:56] right
[29:58] that's not health wealth and prosperity
[30:01] only to the elect
[30:04] and sometimes to the elect he stands by
[30:06] while they struggle
[30:08] but it's still for their health
[30:11] their spiritual wealth
[30:13] and their prosperity
[30:16] that's kind of health wealth and
[30:17] prosperity i believe in
[30:20] now watch she said
[30:21] he said he kept coo and a man came up
[30:23] called adam and adam looked lonesome so
[30:25] he made a byproduct for him he took a
[30:27] rib from his side made him a sweetheart
[30:29] eve and he loved adam and he loved
[30:32] eve
[30:33] and i can see little eve as she laid her
[30:35] head against the shoulder of adam she
[30:37] was everything that a woman could ever
[30:38] expect and more
[30:40] as she laid against the big strong
[30:42] shoulder of her sweetheart adam they
[30:44] walked through the garden perhaps maybe
[30:45] the lion roared she couldn't be scared
[30:48] because there was no fear
[30:50] so he said sweetheart that is the lion i
[30:52] will call him leo the lion come forward
[30:54] she to the tiger you come here and lay
[30:56] down and they followed them like kittens
[30:59] the winds began to blow and the leaves
[31:00] hair began to blow and she said oh that
[31:02] wind peace be still and the winds obeyed
[31:05] him he was the son of god she was his
[31:08] sweetheart
[31:09] i can hear him say dear do you see the
[31:11] sun setting it's time that we talk to
[31:13] the father so they went up to the
[31:14] cathedral the great tree and as they
[31:17] knelt down all of a sudden a heavenly
[31:19] glowing light came down the logos the
[31:22] holy spirit that had brewed them out of
[31:24] the earth came down father god
[31:28] oh my
[31:30] not a different person but the same
[31:31] person
[31:33] came down the holy spirit the holy
[31:36] spirit that created himself in the womb
[31:38] of mary
[31:40] the holy spirit
[31:42] came down
[31:44] and talked to them he said children have
[31:46] you enjoyed yourself today yes father
[31:49] i've come down to kiss you good night to
[31:51] lay you down to rest tonight he kissed
[31:53] him on the cheeks and laid them down
[31:55] nothing
[31:56] could harm
[31:58] listen church we were given an insight
[32:02] into what it was like
[32:06] not from the standpoint of an
[32:07] intellectual but from the standpoint of
[32:09] how it must have felt
[32:14] and ever since i've heard it brother
[32:16] andrew i've wanted to go there
[32:18] i want to go to church there
[32:21] i want to be in that cathedral i want to
[32:23] sit there under that tree i want to hear
[32:25] him don't see i'm not content
[32:26] this message has restored us back it's
[32:29] restored us back to it brother ramon
[32:30] said pentecost plus
[32:32] he said that plus
[32:34] it's restored but i'm not comfortable
[32:36] yet
[32:40] i hope you're hearing me this morning
[32:42] i'm not ready to rest on our laurels i'm
[32:44] not ready yes we believe in healing yes
[32:46] we believe in salvation we believe in
[32:48] the holy ghost and coming on the church
[32:50] and all those things and blessing us but
[32:51] we want that same holy ghost to take us
[32:54] all the way back to where we can be in
[32:56] that eden again and it's going to happen

[33:01] not back just to pentecost but all the
[33:03] way back to eden
[33:06] hallelujah aren't you glad you serve a
[33:08] god that can take you back to that spot
[33:10] and a prophet of the hour came to show
[33:13] us what it was like
[33:15] i want to be in that church
[33:17] he lets us know what that's like once in
[33:18] a while don't he
[33:20] he just comes down among us and settles
[33:22] down and it's just like he's just so
[33:24] close
[33:26] amen
[33:27] and if it wasn't for these bodies
[33:30] that are still cankered
[33:32] sinful
[33:34] amen
[33:35] if it wasn't for this flesh you and i
[33:38] could fellowship with him
[33:40] in that extreme closeness that he meant
[33:43] for us too but one of these days brother
[33:46] joe this body's going to be changed
[33:48] and there will be nothing hindering us
[33:51] from walking in that garden and
[33:52] fellowshipping with him in the cool of
[33:55] the day
[33:57] hallelujah
[33:58] well i'm looking forward to it aren't

[35:11] everything was just right father was so
[35:14] pleased
[35:16] amen
[35:18] and then sin
[35:20] by knowledge intellectual he said i hope
[35:22] you're getting it by intellectual sin
[35:25] entered the world by trying to find more
[35:27] light getting something that wasn't in
[35:29] the word of god
[35:31] god said the day you eat there of that
[35:33] day you'll die but eve wanted something
[35:35] new
[35:37] he said oh can you see from my heart i'm
[35:39] not trying to cross up someone i'm only
[35:41] trying to lay out in view thus saith the
[35:43] lord the word nothing but that
[35:46] not fantastics and big churches and
[35:49] intellectuals but listen
[35:53] oh if we can just listen this morning to
[35:56] listen to the one who brewed us from the
[35:59] earth
[36:01] hallelujah
[36:03] sin entered he said and now friends
[36:06] listen to this
[36:07] watch this closely he said now friends
[36:08] if the holy spirit was the only
[36:11] instrument that god used to brood us out
[36:13] of the earth
[36:14] oh my and we did come from the earth we
[36:17] were here before there was an earth he
[36:19] said remember here is encouragement for
[36:21] you people that's to be praised
[36:22] if the holy spirit by brooding made the
[36:25] physical being who is the architect of
[36:27] our bodies who is the architect of our
[36:29] bodies if the holy spirit oh my made the
[36:32] physical being who is the oh if you're
[36:34] sick this morning grab hold of the
[36:35] promise of god if the holy spirit made
[36:38] the physical being who is the architect
[36:40] of our bodies he said oh god many people
[36:42] see it the holy spirit gave you your
[36:44] appendix
[36:47] hallelujah i'm be careful about letting
[36:49] them take it out you know
[36:52] prophet of god said the holy spirit gave
[36:53] it to me i know sometimes we have to
[36:55] have those things taken out in this
[36:56] imperfect world but originally god had a
[36:58] purpose for it
[37:00] the holy spirit gave you your appendix
[37:02] your eyes your nose your mouth your
[37:04] heart and put a new spirit in you and
[37:07] then come to live in you
[37:09] he's listening to this church and i take
[37:11] it as a challenge this morning do not by
[37:13] any means except intellectual things
[37:16] theology that's contrary to the bible
[37:19] but stay only with us saith the lord
[37:23] he was wounded for our transgressions
[37:25] with his stripes we are healed you say
[37:27] brother ben i don't understand why you
[37:28] read so many quotes why do you try to
[37:30] stay so close to the message of the hour
[37:31] listen if all i can be accused of when
[37:34] i'm done with whatever my ministry is on
[37:35] the earth is staying close to the
[37:37] message then i'm okay with that
[37:39] if all i can be accused with is staying
[37:41] close to the scriptures i'm all right
[37:43] with that
[37:44] if by preaching the gospel i'm staying
[37:46] close to the scriptures because he said
[37:48] to preach the gospel i'm okay with doing
[37:50] that
[37:52] i'll take your criticism
[37:55] are you with me now
[37:58] amen because i'm staying close to the
[37:59] word that's what every one of us need to
[38:01] do amen god help me to do it
[38:03] he said don't do not by any means except
[38:05] intellectual things the all is jesus
[38:07] contrary to the bible but stay only with
[38:09] thus saith the lord he was wounded for
[38:11] our transgressions with his stripes we
[38:13] were healed he said the holy spirit
[38:14] brooded his own body to live in jesus
[38:16] christ now we're coming down to it
[38:18] he's still in the same quote
[38:21] the holy spirit brooded his own body
[38:24] to live in
[38:27] that which
[38:28] is within you he said
[38:30] is of the holy ghost
[38:34] hallelujah
[38:35] well how do you think you're saved
[38:40] you're not saved by intellectualism
[38:42] you're saved by the holy ghost
[38:45] now think about you say well you say by
[38:46] the word that's true the word and the
[38:47] spirit are inseparable
[38:50] logos in the beginning was the holy
[38:52] ghost the whole the christ the anointing
[38:55] is the anointed word
[38:58] right if you have the holy culture say
[39:00] you have the holy ghost to feel the
[39:02] reign of the holy ghost and you
[39:04] don't and you deny the word you don't
[39:05] have it
[39:08] right
[39:09] you can't separate the two
[39:12] the holy spirit rooted his own body to
[39:14] live in jesus christ
[39:16] when he overshadowed mary and created or
[39:18] brooded a blood cell in the womb that
[39:20] brought forth the son christ jesus
[39:23] where god himself
[39:26] brother branham says that too many times
[39:27] for me to say anything different
[39:30] god himself tabernacled on earth for 33
[39:35] and a half years and he made was made a
[39:38] propitiation for our sins to redeem us
[39:41] and to bring reconciliation between lost
[39:43] man and a holy god to kiss them
[39:46] and reconcile them
[39:48] together
[39:50] that
[39:51] oh my think about this for this purpose
[39:54] that in the cool of the evening
[39:57] when the sun is setting
[40:00] over our brow when my life's journey is
[40:03] run and my race is finished i want him
[40:05] to kiss me to
[40:07] sleep hallelujah as he did stephen when
[40:11] he was baffled from hand to hand he said
[40:13] i see the heavens open and jesus
[40:16] standing at the right hand of god he
[40:18] said there you are what is that the same
[40:20] holy ghost
[40:25] not just the same one it was at
[40:26] pentecost yes he's the same one but the
[40:28] same one at the beginning of time
[40:31] at the very beginning that come out and
[40:33] moved on the face of the waters
[40:36] the same holy ghost that's moving over
[40:37] your life today the same presence that
[40:40] you feel
[40:41] amen aren't you glad you can feel it
[40:45] you wouldn't have to there's times you
[40:46] don't feel it but aren't you glad it
[40:48] gives you moments when you can feel it
[40:50] you can become sensitive to it
[40:53] i'm glad that we can luke 134
[40:56] mary asked the angel she said how shall
[40:57] this be
[40:59] seeing i know not a man and the angel
[41:01] answered and said unto her the holy
[41:02] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[41:04] of the highest shall notice overshadow
[41:07] thee
[41:08] therefore also that holy thing which
[41:10] shall be born of thee shall be called
[41:12] the son of god now notice that word
[41:13] overshadow is enveloped
[41:15] enveloped it's actually if you put
[41:17] something the word envelope comes from
[41:19] that if you put something in an envelope
[41:20] or an envelope you take it
[41:22] and you put it inside of it and you
[41:24] close it up
[41:26] so that it's sealed in
[41:30] hallelujah and you'll get that after a
[41:32] while
[41:33] it's sealed in
[41:34] the letter's sealed in the end you you
[41:37] envelop is to is to come completely over
[41:40] not to leave anything
[41:42] amen that would that would not be
[41:44] covered
[41:45] to put a tent oh my to put a tent over
[41:48] it
[41:49] oh we could go there for a while
[41:51] hey man i i want a tent i i'm not
[41:53] looking for for a canvas tent i'm
[41:56] looking for a covering of the holy ghost
[41:58] that envelops the church
[42:02] how carnal people can be now look to put
[42:05] a tent over
[42:06] now have you ever noticed that when a
[42:08] shadow comes
[42:09] it changes the atmosphere
[42:13] if you've ever worked out on the farm or
[42:15] out in the out in the heat of the day
[42:17] and i actually did that at once in my
[42:19] life one time in my life way back in the
[42:21] day i actually worked on a farm i know
[42:23] what it's like to be out there with the
[42:24] cows and out there and with the crops in
[42:27] the field and my grandpa had old
[42:29] equipment nothing he had had a cab on it
[42:31] so everything we were always out in the
[42:33] sun and out in the wind and the rain
[42:35] whatever that it was when we were
[42:36] helping him out he'd give us a dollar a
[42:37] day or take us and buy us a hamburger
[42:39] and that was a good uh boy i need to be
[42:42] quiet about this i know some of you all
[42:43] work for a living
[42:45] don't you dad's get your grandpa's
[42:46] getting the ideas
[42:48] but he'd take us out there by the bill
[42:49] and and make us work
[42:51] you get out there and you're just so hot
[42:55] and there may be one big tree left
[42:57] standing in the field i always wondered
[42:58] why he left that tree in the field and
[43:00] one tree in the cow pasture just one
[43:02] tree but if you go over there in the
[43:04] heat of the day as soon as you walk
[43:06] under it the atmosphere changes
[43:12] it's about 10 degrees cooler
[43:14] maybe 20. why is it so much cooler
[43:16] because when you're standing there it
[43:19] actually is changing the fact that the
[43:21] tree is there changes the atmosphere
[43:24] around it it lowers the temperature so
[43:27] the condition is right for you to sit
[43:30] and enjoy it don't you realize that's
[43:32] the kind of place the house of god ought
[43:33] to be that's the kind of place we ought
[43:35] to come to when we come to the house of
[43:37] god we ought to be able to walk in and
[43:39] come to a place not where everybody's
[43:41] criticizing one another making fun of
[43:43] one another talking about this one and
[43:45] talking about that one we that we should
[43:47] stop that you quit smoking years ago you
[43:50] quit drinking years ago quit talking
[43:52] about people
[43:53] it's just as bad
[43:56] if the holy ghost can take these other
[43:57] things out of your life you can take
[43:59] that out of your life
[44:02] that was extra right there
[44:05] but don't you want to be able to come to
[44:06] a place where you walk in and you know
[44:09] amen i believe your church that you go
[44:11] to can be like that and not only that
[44:12] your home can be like that
[44:14] when you walk into it you can have a
[44:17] place where it's not just worldliness
[44:19] and things going on yes you have fun yes
[44:21] there's there's laughter there but it's
[44:23] a place you can walk into and the
[44:25] temperature the atmosphere changes
[44:28] the thing you've been under at work the
[44:29] thing that you've been around why
[44:31] because under the atmosphere of the
[44:33] shadowing the overshadowing of the holy
[44:35] ghost the temperature changes
[44:38] oh i wish people would recognize that
[44:40] brother branham talks about that being
[44:42] out in the desert how that in the desert
[44:44] there will be little
[44:45] cactus he said and they got little
[44:46] stickers on them and he said the reason
[44:48] they do he said it's just leaves rolled
[44:50] up real tight
[44:51] he said the reason it is because of the
[44:53] atmospheric conditions that are there
[44:54] they never get any rain he said if you
[44:56] would let rain fall in the desert for a
[44:58] while it would begin to blossom like a
[45:00] rose and those things would begin to
[45:02] unfurl if you let the reign of i'm
[45:04] talking about the real holy ghost not
[45:05] just an emotion not just a sensation but
[45:08] the real reign of the holy ghost will
[45:09] change the atmosphere in the building
[45:11] where you're not all the time sticking
[45:13] one another and bleeding one another but
[45:15] till there's a presence of god listen i
[45:17] believe he wants to change the
[45:18] atmosphere of this area
[45:21] until you're not just sticking one
[45:22] another all the time but until you
[45:24] believe that all things are possible and
[45:26] you're sitting there under the tree
[45:30] hallelujah amen
[45:36] notice
[45:37] brother branham says god's life which is
[45:39] in the greek called zoe
[45:41] moving through them and in them
[45:43] quickened their minds to his word
[45:45] he said now let me say it real quietly
[45:47] now the spirit of god that moves among
[45:50] the people
[45:51] quickens the mind of the person to the
[45:53] promise of god
[45:55] he said see it does it he said look and
[45:57] i'm trying to show you let you realize
[45:58] that i'm speaking out of the church he
[46:00] said it also quickened the life in him
[46:02] he said although they only was his
[46:04] attributes to begin with but if god said
[46:06] in this day back in the beginning john
[46:08] doe will be my servant millions of years
[46:10] ago
[46:11] he said now john doe is born in sin
[46:13] we're all john or jane doe you
[46:15] understand
[46:16] amen that's who we are he's born in sin
[46:19] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[46:21] speaking lives because he's immortal
[46:23] but maybe he gets a little religious
[46:25] feeling he'll go join a church maybe
[46:27] he'll join a pentecostal church don't
[46:29] know he might join a message church
[46:31] might join anything but let him get
[46:33] under the atmosphere of god once
[46:36] he said john doe is bound to recognize
[46:39] who his father is
[46:42] hallelujah
[46:43] just as that eagle recognized who the
[46:46] mother is it's got to realize it you see
[46:48] when brother branham said that he said
[46:50] he was born again when he realized he
[46:52] was not the son of charles and elle
[46:55] branham but he was the son of god and
[46:57] people say well that means there was no
[46:58] sensation how did he come to that
[47:00] realization
[47:03] by being in the atmosphere of the holy
[47:04] ghost
[47:07] are you with me now
[47:09] it had to be
[47:11] now look
[47:12] john doe is bound to recognize who his
[47:14] father is just as that eagle recognized
[47:16] who his mother was he's got to realize
[47:18] it see he said only that john doe is
[47:21] god's attribute to become where you
[47:23] won't hear this down at the baptist
[47:24] church today
[47:26] i saw a lot of i
[47:28] bless their hearts you know people some
[47:29] of them serve god better than we do
[47:30] because they serve god by all we know
[47:32] all they know
[47:34] but i saw a little video of one this
[47:36] morning and they were coming out there
[47:37] their christmas sweaters and their
[47:39] reindeer and their santa clauses and
[47:41] everything he'd come out we were in a
[47:42] hurry he knew the people was in a hurry
[47:43] and wanted to preach a quick sermon but
[47:45] jason and i ran into uh one the other
[47:48] day and and it was a preacher that was
[47:51] come walking around and and come in the
[47:53] restaurant there where we were we were
[47:54] talking about preaching he walked in
[47:55] there he said i preach
[47:57] and we said okay and i guess he was a
[47:59] pastor somewhere he said yeah he said
[48:00] i've learned you can't preach longer
[48:02] than 12 minutes
[48:05] we looked at each other and
[48:07] we didn't want belly now we preach
[48:12] he said you can't keep people's
[48:13] attention longer than 10 minutes
[48:15] no not unless you have an atmosphere
[48:20] are you with me this morning not unless
[48:22] you can create an atmosphere that people
[48:25] want to be in the house of god
[48:28] a christian longs for that you see in
[48:31] that atmosphere john doe is bound to
[48:33] recognize who his father is just as that
[48:35] eagle recognized who the mother was it's
[48:36] got to realize it see only he said that
[48:38] john doe is god's attribute has become a
[48:40] word spoken and then the holy spirit
[48:43] seeks that word out
[48:45] i love that he said here it is he calls
[48:47] him gives him everlasting life and
[48:49] brings him into the presence of god
[48:52] god's word
[48:54] a christian as i said longs for that
[48:56] for that atmosphere for the
[48:58] overshadowing that produces the works of
[49:00] god in our mortal flesh
[49:04] brother branham said i certainly is
[49:05] speaking under a place and if you go
[49:07] back and look you'll find that this was
[49:09] just a few people under incorrect
[49:11] leadership
[49:13] historically it proved that out but
[49:14] brother branham saw a few people
[49:16] gathered together he'd come and preach
[49:17] to him in prescott arizona he said you
[49:19] can lay he said certainly he said if i
[49:22] said amen and walked out the door he
[49:23] said i'd say it would pay me every
[49:25] sunday to drive up here or have my
[49:26] children even to come up to sit under an
[49:28] atmosphere like this because it's always
[49:31] the atmosphere that brings the results
[49:35] and you wonder sometimes and i'm just
[49:37] preaching at home folks now y'all the
[49:38] rest of you can shut your ears but
[49:40] sometimes we wonder
[49:42] why we we get to a point where we just
[49:44] we get discouraged and you say well i
[49:46] guess i'll go back to church when i get
[49:48] encouraged again that's not the time to
[49:50] get go back to church
[49:53] it's when you're discouraged because
[49:54] that's where the atmosphere is
[49:57] like i said especially if the atmosphere
[49:59] at your home is broken and sometimes it
[50:01] just is
[50:02] you can come to the house of god and get
[50:03] that atmosphere and go back and change
[50:05] the atmosphere at your house
[50:09] look
[50:10] brother brown said you can he said it's
[50:12] the atmosphere that brings results you
[50:13] can lay a seed out there in the ground
[50:14] no matter how much that seed is
[50:15] germatized and lay it there it's got to
[50:17] have an atmosphere to make it live he
[50:19] said the sun has come has to come to a
[50:21] certain power he said bring it to a
[50:23] certain atmosphere an egg has to have an
[50:25] atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter
[50:27] how fertile it is it's got to have that
[50:28] atmosphere he said and i think that in a
[50:30] group like this
[50:32] amen he said i think in a group like
[50:34] this christians hatch out are born again
[50:36] in such an atmosphere as this he said
[50:39] this is the kind of atmosphere i was
[50:41] born under
[50:43] hallelujah he said no matter where i go
[50:45] and visit the cold world and mission
[50:47] fields and so forth i can even stand and
[50:50] close my eyes and think of this
[50:52] atmosphere
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:56] the holy spirit created the atmosphere
[50:59] that would bring a conception of the
[51:00] word by overshadowing mary listen once
[51:03] the holy spirit makes you a new creation
[51:05] what does that make
[51:06] you know what he created things certain
[51:09] things for certain reasons but when he
[51:11] created you what did he create you
[51:13] created you in his own image
[51:15] he created you to be a creator
[51:18] the messiah come to be the firstborn
[51:20] among many brethren to bring messiahs
[51:23] then what do you do you go and you're a
[51:25] little creator and you build your own
[51:28] atmosphere
[51:30] you get to do that by your words now i
[51:33] told you recently you got to watch what
[51:35] you tear down because everything that
[51:36] you say and that's why jesus said every
[51:38] idle word will be judged at the day of
[51:40] judgment he said
[51:41] if when you speak you either build up or
[51:43] you tear down every time you speak
[51:48] with every word that you say you either
[51:49] build up or you tear down now be careful
[51:52] what you tear down
[51:53] because when you tear something down you
[51:56] need to be able to build it up
[51:59] there are some times you have to tear
[52:00] down
[52:02] there are some times with your children
[52:03] you have to correct them be careful what
[52:05] you tear out of their lives when you go
[52:07] and you begin to criticize the ministry
[52:09] you begin to criticize people everybody
[52:10] around you and you just get that
[52:12] critical spirit on you what you're doing
[52:14] is tearing something down in the minds
[52:16] of your children and you don't realize
[52:18] that what god wants you to do is build
[52:20] up something that will bring a respect
[52:24] be careful what you how you use your
[52:25] voice because you're a creator and god
[52:28] didn't go out there and build with his
[52:29] hands he created by his words
[52:35] hallelujah
[52:36] and then the holy spirit rooted it to
[52:38] life
[52:39] you just go speak with no holy spirit to
[52:41] back it up you're going to get nothing
[52:43] but if you go and speak the holy spirit
[52:45] if you're
[52:46] if you're speaking with a heart full of
[52:48] love and you're speaking with the right
[52:50] motives and the right you know at the
[52:51] right time when god compels your speech
[52:54] all of a sudden you begin to see the
[52:55] holy spirit make it happen
[52:58] oh my we've all seen that haven't we
[53:00] no brother brandon said don't fuss
[53:04] don't fuss
[53:07] see i got a problem i can't get past
[53:09] some things brother brandon says
[53:11] i just can't get around don't fuss
[53:16] you say brother ben have you ever fussed
[53:17] yes sir
[53:18] yes ma'am it's probably a lady that
[53:20] asked that
[53:25] don't fuss
[53:27] he told us not to
[53:29] the holy spirit agrees with the word now
[53:30] brother bram didn't just say that he was
[53:32] a word prophet and the bible says that
[53:34] think on these things
[53:37] as much as is possible live peacefully
[53:39] with all men so he said don't fuss see
[53:41] temper breeds temper first thing you
[53:42] know you grieve the holy spirit away
[53:44] from you you'll be fussing back
[53:49] watch
[53:50] he said so he said don't fuss now
[53:52] sometimes you just have to walk away
[53:53] from a
[53:54] fuss that's what he's saying because
[53:56] pretty soon you'll be fussing back then
[53:58] the holy spirit takes his flight temper
[54:00] breeds temper and love breeds love
[54:03] be full of love jesus said this will all
[54:05] men know you're my disciples when you
[54:07] have loved one for another that's the
[54:08] fruit of the holy spirit is love notice
[54:10] he doesn't say the evidence but the
[54:12] fruit there was a time he considered
[54:13] maybe that love was the evidence of the
[54:15] holy ghost but he'd come to find out
[54:16] that wasn't true but it is a fruit of
[54:18] the holy ghost
[54:20] he said did you know you were a little
[54:21] creator yourself
[54:23] he said you know that certainly you've
[54:25] seen people that you just love to be
[54:26] around
[54:27] praise god he said you i know you all
[54:29] love to be around me he said you don't
[54:31] know why
[54:32] just that loving type of person
[54:35] have you seen that
[54:37] just as kind there you like to be around
[54:39] them they create that atmosphere
[54:44] by the life that they live
[54:46] the way that they talk
[54:49] their conversation
[54:52] see god didn't idly just walk around say
[54:54] well let there be light
[54:57] man that light don't look very good let
[54:58] there be darkness
[55:02] everything he said he meant
[55:07] oh if we can only realize the power of
[55:09] our words
[55:10] you walk into a into your house
[55:13] some of you know this
[55:14] walk into your house i was a
[55:17] actually 7 30 to 4 30 but eight to five
[55:19] kind of worker you know
[55:21] you come in at night
[55:22] walk in if dinner wasn't ready i got two
[55:24] options
[55:27] got two options so you smell something
[55:29] burning have you ever done that don't
[55:30] raise your hand
[55:33] you walk into a into your home you smell
[55:35] something burning i remember one time i
[55:37] i've told you the story before you just
[55:38] bear with me i'll close in a minute
[55:40] i was
[55:42] we just got married we were there in
[55:44] west plains in a duplex nest next to
[55:46] sister fritz she was our landlady at the
[55:48] time
[55:49] and we were in that little duplex and my
[55:51] wife was
[55:52] learning to cook and we had a little
[55:54] oven in there and she had a we bought
[55:56] some frozen pizzas and don't laugh about
[55:58] that
[55:59] it was good food at the time

[56:04] gained 80 pounds after we got married
[56:08] but we were sitting there and she was
[56:10] doing that how was it work and i come
[56:12] home and i can smell it burning
[56:14] isn't that an awful feeling you're
[56:16] hungry you walk in the house
[56:19] and it's burning
[56:21] and and what had happened she didn't
[56:22] have a regular pizza pan and she'd put
[56:24] it on her and it spilled off or
[56:26] something or maybe still when she tried
[56:27] to take it out i think it was and it
[56:29] spilled all over the place and it was
[56:31] burning the cheese was burning such an
[56:33] awful smell the burning of fake
[56:35] mozzarella cheese on the top of a pizza
[56:38] it's burning and as that aroma come in
[56:40] the door and i walked in i said what did
[56:41] you do you can't even cook pizza
[56:44] i had two choices
[56:47] i chose the wrong one
[56:52] now my wife's not the type to
[56:54] snap back
[56:55] she don't do that
[56:57] i thank god for that
[56:59] she don't snap back but she will get
[57:00] quiet
[57:02] and that day she just had about enough
[57:05] she just got real quiet i walked back
[57:07] out the door when i walked out the door
[57:09] i'll never forget it they're sitting on
[57:11] my doorstep
[57:12] was a turtle dove
[57:15] i walked outside the door and i slammed
[57:16] the door
[57:18] and the dove got startled and flew away
[57:22] i thought my god what have i done
[57:26] because brother branham said when you
[57:27] have that wolf nature
[57:28] the devil fly away
[57:32] and i
[57:34] i walked back in the house my wife was
[57:36] standing there crying trying to clean up
[57:38] the mess i think we're gonna have to eat
[57:40] we're gonna do something i can't
[57:41] remember what we did we'll get something
[57:42] else i'm sorry
[57:45] that atmosphere changed
[57:49] so you're a creator
[57:51] you got two choices this morning
[57:54] what kind of service you're going to
[57:55] have
[57:56] how are you going to worship god
[57:58] and some of us some of the atmosphere
[58:00] you're living in right now as a result
[58:02] of things you said to each other this
[58:03] morning
[58:12] see
[58:13] you've got to apply the holy spirit
[58:15] you've got to create an atmosphere
[58:18] i'm going to skip down here just a
[58:19] little bit
[58:21] the holy spirit is given to you you'll
[58:23] have to find me the holy spirit is given
[58:25] to you you must apply it
[58:27] yourself
[58:28] now brother bran i'm in the token that's
[58:30] where i'm going to now
[58:31] is in the token
[58:33] brother branham it says in paragraph 372
[58:36] he said get ready
[58:37] apply it
[58:38] believe it
[58:40] clean up
[58:41] he said let your children let your
[58:42] family let your loved ones see it
[58:45] in you he said that's right it'll take
[58:47] effect now you're you're the creator you
[58:50] have to apply the token no matter how
[58:51] much the token is available you've got
[58:54] to actually put it on the door
[59:00] how do you apply the token well your
[59:02] creator now look he said then apply the
[59:05] token in prayer he said with
[59:07] consideration
[59:09] with believing apply it with such
[59:12] love
[59:14] now i can remember hearing sermons about
[59:16] applying the token when i was a kid and
[59:17] they were always angry
[59:22] have you ever heard a sermon about you
[59:24] better apply the token
[59:26] getting dark out there better apply the
[59:28] token and there's there's some merit to
[59:30] that you know because we do it's a dark
[59:32] time
[59:34] right but brother branham didn't say
[59:35] apply it in anger
[59:38] he said apply it with such love
[59:40] and so forth to you know it's going to
[59:41] take
[59:42] place i heard a man say the other day
[59:44] some preachers never raised their voice
[59:45] unless it's in anger
[59:47] and that's you know that that's the
[59:49] truth
[59:50] god help us not to be like that
[59:52] lord if i'm going to raise my voice let
[59:53] me do it in worship
[59:57] listen he said
[59:59] he said apply it he said with love with
[1:00:02] such love and so forth you know it's
[1:00:03] going to take place it's going to take
[1:00:04] place that's all apply it in confidence
[1:00:07] believing it's going to help
[1:00:11] hey man when you talk to that child now
[1:00:14] some of you are going to go on christmas
[1:00:15] as i'm closing this morning you're going
[1:00:17] to be around family maybe that you're
[1:00:18] not normally around you're going to be
[1:00:20] in atmospheres that are different
[1:00:24] you're not always going to be in the
[1:00:25] atmosphere that you're used to being in
[1:00:28] and so you have to become a creator
[1:00:30] notice he said apply it he said in
[1:00:32] confidence believing it's going to help
[1:00:33] when you talk to that child when you
[1:00:35] talk to your husband talk to your wife
[1:00:37] talk to this loved one believe that it's
[1:00:40] going to help just stand there and say
[1:00:43] lord i've claimed them they're mine
[1:00:46] i'm getting them for you
[1:00:48] lord
[1:00:50] hallelujah
[1:00:52] who am i i'm getting them for you lord
[1:00:55] some of you all are claiming your
[1:00:56] children you should have claimed 20
[1:00:57] years ago by creating an atmosphere in
[1:00:59] your home
[1:01:01] i'm not saying that to make you feel bad
[1:01:03] but if you have children today claim
[1:01:05] them
[1:01:07] not after they leave
[1:01:11] while they're at home
[1:01:16] apply it you you claim by faith after
[1:01:19] they left but the best time to do it is
[1:01:21] to create an atmosphere while they're at
[1:01:22] home
[1:01:24] listen he said apply it create that
[1:01:26] atmosphere
[1:01:27] and he said around you that those well
[1:01:30] love this create that atmosphere around
[1:01:32] you that they'll just drop right into it
[1:01:39] that family member who smokes drinks
[1:01:43] cusses
[1:01:44] they come in that atmospheric atmosphere
[1:01:47] that you've created out of love
[1:01:49] and applying the token
[1:01:51] and they come in there and they think
[1:01:53] boy i haven't wanted to smoke for an
[1:01:55] hour
[1:01:56] or two
[1:01:59] for some reason
[1:02:01] maybe they feel convicted of their sin
[1:02:02] but there's something in them
[1:02:04] i want that
[1:02:06] and they just drop right into it
[1:02:09] he said oh you are he said if you got
[1:02:11] the token you create a spirit around you
[1:02:13] a power that when you walk people know
[1:02:15] that you're a christian
[1:02:17] they love for you to say something to
[1:02:19] them
[1:02:21] don't you want to be that kind of person
[1:02:24] instead of the person that everybody
[1:02:25] dreads to talk to because they know
[1:02:27] they're going to get criticized
[1:02:31] they love for you to say something to
[1:02:32] them by the bailey i don't mean to
[1:02:34] embarrass you'd be sitting back there
[1:02:35] but the bailly don't say much
[1:02:36] the herald doesn't say much but when he
[1:02:38] says something it's usually good
[1:02:40] i like that
[1:02:43] so i'll go around brother bailey and try
[1:02:44] to get him to talk you know
[1:02:47] i want him to say something to me
[1:02:49] because it's usually good
[1:02:51] don't you want to be somebody that

[1:04:42] situations
[1:04:44] that you don't usually find yourself in
[1:04:46] maybe a
[1:04:48] christmas party at work
[1:04:50] if you go to those things
[1:04:52] maybe i remember
[1:04:57] being in christmas parties
[1:04:59] there wasn't another person there there
[1:05:00] was one lady who was church of christ
[1:05:01] everybody else was just heathens
[1:05:04] where i worked
[1:05:06] every christmas
[1:05:07] they'd come
[1:05:08] i remember
[1:05:10] the one year
[1:05:12] my boss declared an alcohol-free chris
[1:05:15] christmas
[1:05:16] even though they all drank
[1:05:18] because they they knew i was a minister
[1:05:21] and every christmas i got to pray with
[1:05:22] those people
[1:05:24] the one time of the year they would
[1:05:25] listen to me
[1:05:27] they were thankful when i finished quick
[1:05:31] for several years i got to pray with
[1:05:32] those people every year i'll never
[1:05:34] forget that the atmosphere you create
[1:05:37] around you will have to make people have
[1:05:38] confidence in you
[1:05:40] and you've experienced this you know
[1:05:41] this when you go to work and somebody
[1:05:43] asks you to pray maybe they don't
[1:05:44] believe nothing like you
[1:05:46] but it's the atmosphere that's there
[1:05:48] create an atmosphere this christmas
[1:05:51] that is so full of the holy ghost
[1:05:53] you know to do that you've got to
[1:05:54] forgive
[1:05:55] to do that you've got to love to do that
[1:05:58] you've got to care about people
[1:06:01] you take the toke you say lord i can't
[1:06:02] do that by myself
[1:06:04] you take that token and apply the blood
[1:06:06] to the door
[1:06:08] let that atmosphere be a creator of an
[1:06:11] atmosphere of love in your house this
[1:06:13] christmas
[1:06:14] it'll cause the word to be born in your
[1:06:16] family
[1:06:19] it'll make you a real christian
[1:06:23] would you just talk to god for a moment
[1:06:25] just right where you're seated
[1:06:28] just talk to him for a minute lord
[1:06:30] i want to be a creator
[1:06:34] maybe you've created some things that
[1:06:35] are bad
[1:06:37] lord help me to tear down those things
[1:06:39] not with
[1:06:41] not with evil in my heart not out of
[1:06:42] malice but out of love
[1:06:44] to tear down what's wrong and to build
[1:06:47] up what's right
[1:06:48] to create an atmosphere in my home
[1:06:50] and among my family that people
[1:06:53] can be changed
[1:06:55] if all i ever got done in the ministry
[1:06:57] is to change the people in my family to
[1:07:00] see them progress to the holy ghost i
[1:07:02] want more than that i want to see
[1:07:04] everyone that god brings but it's all i
[1:07:06] ever got done is for my daughter sitting
[1:07:07] here on the front row to be under such
[1:07:09] an atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:07:12] that she would know that she needs to be
[1:07:13] born again
[1:07:16] she know what it's like to
[1:07:18] feel god tugging at her heart that's all
[1:07:20] i want
[1:07:21] that's enough
[1:07:23] could you just do that every one of your
[1:07:25] creators not just the preacher
[1:07:27] we work hard to create an atmosphere
[1:07:28] here in the church
[1:07:30] why don't you create an atmosphere in
[1:07:31] your home i know some of you have at
[1:07:32] heart i know some of you maybe you have
[1:07:35] parents that aren't right or children
[1:07:37] it's hard it's hard for a young person
[1:07:39] when mom and dad maybe don't serve the
[1:07:41] lord
[1:07:42] but you go create an atmosphere
[1:07:44] do it with your words
[1:07:46] do it by being like him
[1:07:48] maybe sometimes you just won't respond
[1:07:50] but you create the right atmosphere
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:53] miracles can be born in that atmosphere
[1:07:55] that's the atmosphere i was born under
[1:07:58] i trust you as well heavenly father
[1:08:01] lord jesus as i feel your presence here
[1:08:03] this morning
[1:08:04] lord we come down to christmas time and
[1:08:06] we know
[1:08:07] lord that what an atmosphere it is for
[1:08:09] us but the writer said it ought to be a
[1:08:10] time of worship we know you were born on
[1:08:13] december 25th but you were born lord
[1:08:17] the world just commercialized it and
[1:08:19] even some christians take it to a place
[1:08:21] where all they do is spend money and
[1:08:22] they hate this time of year
[1:08:24] but oh god may it be a reminder to us
[1:08:27] that you were born
[1:08:28] that you were that you not only were
[1:08:30] born but you walked the earth you were
[1:08:33] tempted and all like manner like we are
[1:08:35] you're a high priest that can be touched
[1:08:37] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:08:40] maybe you went to family gatherings that
[1:08:42] weren't so nice
[1:08:43] when you did
[1:08:46] you turned water into wine
[1:08:49] when they run out
[1:08:50] of the right atmosphere
[1:08:52] let me be the one that could be a
[1:08:54] creator
[1:08:55] and create that atmosphere back in the
[1:08:57] home again
[1:08:59] i pray you'd grant it lord you know what
