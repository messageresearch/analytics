or we'd be quick to give you your place your preeminence oh God we thank you for to heal the sick Lord I think of those especially who are sick this morning and not able to come I pray that you blessed him oh God heal them Lord as they're watching the service Lord and listening to the word I pray that you'd heal them Lord we ask it in your precious name amen amen Acts chapter 1 Acts chapter 1 and verse 1 I want to uh give you our our Easter greetings and uh and our sermon this morning but the steward will be preaching next week and whether I'm here or not depends on how that test comes back tomorrow so uh we'll just have one day and to decide whether we're going or not going if we don't we feel that's the will of the Lord if we do that'll be the will of the Lord and and so you can't force these things it just happens the way he wants them to happen uh but I I would like to go but I'd also like to be with you so whichever way but brother Stewart will be preaching next weekend regardless again we'll just have one service and then we'll get back to our regular schedule if I don't go I'll be here Wednesday night if not brother Joel will be here if he's able to do that and everybody's been a little bit under the weather but we believe that God is our healer we believe that he's I am the god that healeth all thy diseases and so we believe that today and and uh I'm feeling pretty good I think the Lord is has helped us and I trust that he'll help you as well Acts chapter 1 and verse 1 the former Treatise have I made o theopolis of all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day in which she was taken up after that he threw the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs yes being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence I want to speak to you this morning on proving his resurrection you may have your seats live in a time when everyone wants scientific proof or picture proof that what you're saying is true it's take a picture or it didn't happen because we have the ability to do that today and and so we live in a very cynical Age and and yet if you look at the death burial and resurrection of Christ it's actually that event that that develops the picture of who he was there was no real proof of who he was until his death burial and Resurrection it's as if it was there but it was only in a form that you couldn't you couldn't really see it the full picture of it but once they saw him and heard the word from him after his resurrection it was them actually seeing him of the Paul that that caused him to recognize this is real this is the truth and and I want to say this to us this morning that there was a time when every one of us was undeveloped if you could say it that way we could say that we were a Christian we could identify as a Christian we might have many times had little experiences and things in our lives that we thought well I've given my heart to the Lord but there had to come a time when we died to sin and through death burial and Resurrection through baptism and through the through the filling of the spirit of God we actually developed into what God wanted us to be and then the people could see here's a proof that this person is a son or daughter of God there was a time brother Stewart when you were just another message kid and I was just another message kid but through death burial and Resurrection I've been developed and you have been developed into where the people can see it's a proof of his resurrection we shouldn't take that lightly Church it ought to mean as much to us this morning as it did the very day that it happened and I want to tell you this each one of you children you've got to have that same thing happen in your life you can be a church member you can have everything going just right you can have all things said in order you could even get married and marry a Christian boy or a Christian girl you could live for decades and go to church and pay your tithes but there's got to come a time when there's a death burial and Resurrection in your life it's got to happen the picture has got to be developed and if you find yourself miserable in the house of God if you find yourself unable to to participate in the freedom of worship you find yourself unable to come to God you need to reach that place my own children the children of this church the burden of my heart this morning as I was praying let them see there's got to be a proof in their life there's got to be a death burial in a resurrection there's got to be a not more than just being a message person more than just being a singer more than even being a preacher there's got to come a proof when you come out on the other side and people can see he was dead but now he's alive Lord you've had for that today it was been a year sister Stephanie since that happened in your life and you could be a testimony this morning something happened death burial and Resurrection amen every one of us can have that do you believe it this morning every one of us can have that and we must have that so before his death burial and Resurrection there was no real proof that Jesus was so he said he was now I know what you're thinking you think well the scriptures but the scriptures had to be completely fulfilled and it was that event which which completed the Fulfillment of the scriptures in his life now we know that I they uh he had his the Virgin birth and Isaiah 7 14 they had been promised a virgin shall conceive in the story of Christmas it speaks to us of a time when he was born and it fulfilled the scripture but there was really only one person who knew for sure that that was the truth and that was Mary right she knew so to her that was a reality but to many others they had to believe all right they had to believe in the story of Christmas they had to believe that he came on a certain at a certain time and that God came down and and and actually and actually the Holy Spirit was the father of Jesus how he how he was she was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and they had to believe that and for most people they didn't believe it most people believe that this was a Roman soldier most people believed that it was some kind of a case where she was just too embarrassed or too ashamed that was the prevailing story and I'll be honest with you if you were just a a person who had nothing no knowledge of God no knowledge of the scriptures you wouldn't think that this was some kind of Supernatural thing you would think that poor girl's trying to hide something that's what it looked like yeah oh my and so to many of them they had to just accept her word for that they could look back and Trace his family lineage back to David they can trace it back on both sides but but yet and then they knew that that fulfilled the scripture if Isaiah 11 and 1 where it says he would be a root out of Jesse and they could trace that family scripture back or that family lineage back and it was true but again they had to believe it because there were many sons of Judah there were many people in that lineage thousands and thousands of people and then as he grew up and began his ministry begin to fulfill the word spoken about him and they begin to see things happen in his life they begin to see him that he was uh he he was a person that had extraordinary Miracles that happened in his life he had an extraordinary ability to reveal the word to them to speak to the truth and he began to come in Luke chapter 4 and verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he'd been brought up and as his custom was he he went to church on on the Sabbath day and stood up for the Reed and there was delivered on him the book of the prophet Isaiah when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me it's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind the Senate Liberties him that are bruised verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the Lord right and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day yes is this scripture fulfilled in your ears but you know what their response was to that out of town right they run him out of town and you find you say well that was his neighbors and friends because they looked at him and they've said you know we know his father we know his mother we know his family we were we've been around the carpentry shop he's just another guy right right he was well hidden in Simplicity yes he's well hidden today but he was well hidden in Simplicity and so they said we knew we knew about him we knew his uh who he was we knew where he come from we know his family history we know how poor he was we we know of the town that he come out of we know he's no King we know he's no Prophet we know he's no Messiah but they could they couldn't see who he really was they couldn't see beyond that veil of Flesh so they actually run him out of town even John the Baptist now think about it now we think we have a hard time believing today it's much easier to believe today than it was then because he was making claims see it's it's easier to believe him for who he was but you've not walked with him you've not eaten with him if it's one thing to say he lived and he was God in flesh it's another thing to actually sit down and eat with him and say he's God in flesh right because you know he got headaches you know that he he got sick sometimes probably caught whatever virus was going around I said Not Jesus absolutely he did he was a man he was tempted and all like men are like we are yet without sin so even John who baptized him and declared over him Behold the Lamb when he was under the anointing don't be too hard on yourself for doubting when you get in a hard spot yeah because that's just what we human beings do when John was under the anointing he stood there in front of the Pharisees and said this is him Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world you imagine what it must have felt like to be in that service as he stood there with the power and authority of the prophet of the Forerunner of God who stood there and said this is him a little while later he's sitting in prison yes sir sitting in prison right and if you go to that next scripture the Bible says that John heard in the prison The Works of Christ and he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another somehow in that prison brother said this Eagle Eye got filmed over he began to not really understand or not really come for him somehow with circumstances of life but that didn't mean he wasn't a Christian didn't mean he wasn't a Believer it just meant that he that he needed to be sure oh my but when you need proof today we do not follow cunningly devised fables we don't follow a message of some kind of a cult or some kind of an idea somebody had but if you need proof today there's proof for you that he's alive if you're willing to believe it and accept it we don't follow a a story we follow approved gospel now watch he come to him he said all right though he that should come and Jesus answered it yeah I love the way he did this he didn't go back and preach a series of sermons on John the traitor hey could have he could have come and preached it told the people well John used to used to love me but he is forsaking me you know well Jesus knew his heart yes he knew the hard time that he was in he said are you heathens should come or do we look for another and Jesus answered and said go show John again he'd seen it once but he said go show John again those things which you do here and see sometimes I think we need to go look again at what God's done in her day sometimes I think we need to go back and re-examine what God did in Malachi 4. what he did in Revelation 10. we need to go back and re-examine what he did in the prophets Ministry some of us need to go back and re-examine what he's done in our own lives we need to go back and look this is what I was and this is what I am today yes I have fault yes I have failures don't let the devil talk you out of what you have because you've made a mistake because you've done something that's not exactly said well I've messed up Don't Let The Devil talk you out of your death burial and Resurrection but you've got proof in your life that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever who do we believe it this morning he said go show John again that's a good sermon title right there with a joy Go and show John again those things that you do here and see the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up the poor of the Gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me even the disciples weren't sure he spoke to them about his death uh no no not going to happen Mark 8 31 he began to teach them the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again this is not what they wanted to hear he said no no you don't understand Jesus we're going to go in we're going to explain to the scribes and the Pharisees they're all going to see it and we're all going to have a national revolt against Rome he said that's not how it's going to happen you think this is going to be glorious but my Kingdom's coming in a way that actually I've got to die yes and you're all going to be scattered yeah yeah now look and he spake that saying openly and Peter took him to the side and said hey he quit preaching like that you're discouraging people you're just telling them the truth but they just couldn't conceive what he would do because they couldn't see past death oh I hope you're I hope you're listening this morning with spiritual years they couldn't see past death they saw death as a Fidelity because it had always been a finality yes they saw death as they saw death as something that if he died or was lost if he died it was all over and they didn't recognize that when he died it had just begun but they saw death as a phenology they saw death as something that would end it all right because they couldn't conceive what he would do and many times in our lives when we see trouble when we see trials when we see heartaches for the herald we see things happen we lose loved ones we have trouble in our lives we have struggle in our lives and we wonder what what is it and we look at it meantime we can't see past the death but if you can see past the death you begin to realize there's a Resurrection on the other side he said all things someone say all things this morning all things work together for the good but in the love God who called according to his purpose well what is that Romans 8 28 he's telling us that we are his elected children of God if we if we have to go through a death if we have to go through a trial if we have to go through persecution there's something better coming on the other side of it he's doing it for a reason yes it couldn't conceive of it of it and the scribes and Pharisees couldn't see it Matthew 12 38 certainly the scribes of the Pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee yeah but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas first Jonas was three days and three nights in the wells belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth he tried to tell him John Chapter 2 and verse 18. I know I'm reading a lot of scripture but just want to lay a good foundation before we move on this morning he said then answer the Jews and said unto him what sign show us thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple he said here's a sign destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up and then said the Jews 40 in six years was this temple in building we'll thou rear it up in three days took him 46 years to build the Third Temple herod's Temple and you say will you well you're going to raise it up in three days but he spoke of the Temple of his body all the way down to the end they couldn't see it even the disciples were still fussing with one another like many people do today if we're not careful we get caught fussing with one another instead of seeing the big picture and they were fussing with one another about who would be the greatest in the kingdom and each one of them jockeying for a great position right up to the very end he was having his last supper with them and they were still only concerned about who would be the Prime Minister and who would be the the great one in this in this great Kingdom that's coming up and they didn't see yeah what he'd been telling them it had not been proved to them who he was oh my it should have been they should have known they should have seen him he raised the dead he did the Miracles but it was the resurrection it took a resurrection to prove who he was yes watch this they watched as he went to the garden through Sleek filled eyes had they believed it they would have stayed awake yes but they didn't really believe that this would be the way it would all end yeah that this would be how it would happen they just couldn't believe that their little group was going to get broken up because God was fixing to do something better they watched him as he prayed in the garden and the blood and the sweats separated and and no blood in the water in his body separated and he had drops of of sweat perspiration like blood Peter even had a sword with him and when they come to get him and they watched Judas kiss him and and extend a hand of friendship to him and yet yet as a sign to tell him who he was and Peter recognized that and he picks up the sword and all he accomplishes is one guy that's really confused yeah because one minute guys coming at him with a sword imagine this poor guy these guys coming at him with a sword and he comes at him and cuts his ear off oh no he can feel it it's not there and here comes another guy they're going to get these criminals you know one of them does what a criminal's supposed to do fight back but the other one walks over to him picks up the air off the ground and puts it back on I tell you what that's more than a man yeah they should have known who he was but they didn't recognize it picks up his ear and puts it back that guy's confused yeah he probably thought it was all a dream yeah most of the disciples fled from the authorities Peter follows at a distance he gets down there and they put him through all these trials six different trials by the way that they put Jesus through in that night if you think about it he didn't sleep through all of that that kept him awake they beat him they put a crown of thorns on his head they spit on him what did he do during this time that as he was going through all of this Peter's watching him during the night and he's staying a distance away and he goes down there to the house and he's sitting around a fire with some others and somebody recognizes him and what does he do he doesn't stand there and say I have such confidence in Christ that I don't care if they burn me or crucify me or whatever I'm Gonna Stand what does he do he's so unsure uh if he's really who he says he is yeah yeah he stands there and says I'm not one of them see that's that's why that's why sometimes it's hard to pray in public yeah yeah young people sometimes have a hard time in school praying over your food you want to look like the world not sure I'll say this this flesh you're never going to convince the flesh but there's got to be a birth in the soul yes that's gonna hold that flesh brother Riley and no matter what you go through in life you know yeah yeah I know he's my God yes I know this message is true I know he's my savior I don't care what the internet says what what the what the people say I know who he is because he's raised in my heart I know that he's alive because of what he's done oh my God because of how he's raised me up from the death of my own sin see that's why it's hard many times to acknowledge Him publicly you might feel a little bit embarrassed about the message of the hour a little bit embarrassed about what church you go to because it's hard if you're not sure but let's be sure this morning let's let him prove himself to us let's let him make himself live in our lives hey watch the Roman soldiers beat him they watched him fall on the road to Calvary you all know the story are you with me this morning I don't want to bore you I know you've heard it before they watched him as he as he as he went he had the cross he's trying to carry the cross after you've been up for 24 hours he's he's been beaten over and over again and he he gets as far as he can go physically he just can't take anymore you ever been there his body fell and if he didn't go the rest of the way he could never redeem man he could never fulfill all the scripture you realize that he had to fulfill all of the word yes he had to fulfill all of the word he could never fulfill the Psalms where it says my phone say stare at me is he had died on the way if he was unable to pick up the cross and so he would stay he was he was under the burden of that cross he failed he could not move another step and God did not come down in supernaturally strengthened him but he had a man standing there by the name of Simon the siren I preached on it to you before he's standing there by the side of the road he just happens to be there an African man who just happened the Bible said to come out of the country and was found in an intersection and when he's at that intersection he don't know why he's there and he sees a crowd coming he sees the you see here's the noise and here comes Jesus and he falls right in front of him and a Roman soldier looks at him and he says you carry his cross what was it he was compelled to do it listen to me that's how I got called in the ministry that's how God calls his men it's not because they wanted to it's not because they've striven to make themselves preachers but it's because his body is weak and all of a sudden there's a there's a requirement there's a compelling the Holy Spirit points in your heart said you carry the crawl yeah that's right you do what's necessary they watched that I think it's interesting that Peter didn't do it James didn't do it right John didn't pick him up pick up the cross Simon did you want to change your family history pick up a cross you can go back and find the scripture much later that Simon's children were known to the people in the early church why because Simon picked up the cross yeah you want to break a curse in your family pick up your cross yes start going to church start living for God start doing the hard stuff disciples watched that they watched him fall yeah yeah they saw Simon pick up the cross they they saw him drag his body over the last few steps to Calvary they saw the nails putting his hands and his feet some of them did they watched his public execution they saw him give up the coast when he said it is finished they thought their lives are over that's right imagine how hard it would be to believe it may have been easier to believe back when the The Fish and Loaves were being handed out and back when they were so limbs restored and back when they saw demons delivered and they they saw different things happen the blind eyes opened it was easier to believe then than it was that day when they stood there and they watched him nailed to a tree they watched him die yeah watch the soldier break his leg break the other's legs and then take the take the spear and thrust it in his side blood water come out it's over imagine that was a hard weekend wasn't it yeah day one still over yeah I woke up in the morning nothing changed went to bed on Friday night what a what a Passover weekend they just well I guess the message is done for him it's over nobody's going to believe it nobody's going to receive it yeah he's gone there's nothing we can do about it hmm we'll just tell a few stories and sit around listen to some tapes do our thing they thought their lives were over yeah yeah but he wasn't done yet right right Hallelujah he wasn't done yet you see he believed the word that was written about himself and he goes down into the grave oh God but he doesn't stay there his Spirit leaves NOW Watch What Happens it goes down Into the Depths he preaches to the souls in prison he comes and empties Paradise and he comes up a mighty conqueror on the third day now watch and the Bible tells us on the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early she got to church first I love the story of Mary Magdalene I love it he said when it was yet dark unto the Sepulcher and see if the stone taken away now her first thought is not it's not he's risen her first thought is they've taken him yeah somebody stole a body yeah and she runeth and coming to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved I love the way John describes himself he was writing about myself I'd want to write about myself that way too it's kind of a humble brag right the one Jesus loved and so she comes to the disciple who Jesus loved and said they've taken away the Lord out of the Sepulcher we know not where they've laid him and Peter therefore went forth they weren't going to find him risen they were going to see they were going to see uh who had stolen him who'd ruined his who'd ruined their ability to mourn yeah their ability to come together and talk about what had been yeah oh God so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter came first to the septica he stood he's stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothesline yet waiting not in and then come as Simon Peter following him and went into the Sepulcher see at the linen closed line and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes notice the details they remembered later but wrapped together in a place by itself glory to God it's one thing to take them off it's one thing for them to steal the body but here they he's taking off the handkerchief he's taking off the The Veil if you put it that way and wrapped it left it there now watch and he says then when then also that other disciple which came first to the septica and he saw and believed he saw him believed now watch he did not believe in the resurrection he just believed he was gone and we know that because the next verse yes says for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must raise again from the dead now they had heard it but they didn't know it yeah come on that's right see that's the problem many times as we don't yet we know the scripture that said you must be born again but we don't really know the other he said you will receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you we we've heard it we've read it we've heard it preach but you got to know it brother Peter you got to know it it's got to become part of your life yeah it's got to become your overwhelming desire it's got to be something in your life that'll make you want to reach out it'll make you go the rest of your life and and tell the story as if you were there and you saw it can you imagine if you were Mary Magdalene if you were one of the disciples you went into that tomb you saw him laying there you saw the absence of a body and then you found out later that it matched the scripture can you imagine no one could ever get you to quit telling that story you tell it the rest of your life but let me tell you this this morning if you were dead and trespasses and sins and you come and wept your way in an altar and you were resurrected one day there ain't nothing but a sandwich ever gonna be able to take you away from that story you're going to tell it the rest of your life you'll tell your neighbors you why because you believe it you saw it it's been proved to you Hallelujah it heard it they were taught it from their youth yeah but they didn't know it verse 10. then the disciples went away again into their own home but Mary I love you stood without without a deceptica weeper and as she went she stooped down and looked into the Sepulcher and seeth two angels in white sitting I wanted the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had laid they said unto your woman why weep us now she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him yes and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and not that was Jesus and Jesus saith in her woman why we pastel yes whom seeketh now and she supposedly him to be the gardener saith on him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou slayed him and I will take him away let me be let me let me have my grief leave me alone in my morning I want to take him away and build a memory Memorial to him because of what he did and how wonderful he was and how much he loved me yeah oh God it's not what he wanted he wanted her to be the memorial Jesus said unto her Mary oh you'd see him you'd been to church over and over again but one day you heard a voice say Mary Ben you Paul come on what was it you may not have heard it in a literal form but you heard it what was it it was the voice of God Hallelujah it was speaking to you you'd heard tape after tape after tape you'd heard you'd read scripture after scripture but one day yes it spoke to you and you heard your name she said Mary he said Mary and she turned herself say that him ripponi which is to say master this was the same voice that it delivered her of Seven Devils he picked the right person to show himself alive to First the first proof the first infallible proof is the way that Luke puts it in the book of Acts the first infallible proof that Jesus was alive was to Mary Magdalene why Mary look at Mark 16 and 9 you know when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils so the scripture ties the fact of her being the first one with her being the one who was delivered of the most Hallelujah I feel like that's me no wonder Paul said that's the chief I'm the chiefest of Sinners yes that puts me in a good place to see it yeah you said my brother Ben you don't know what I've done you don't know what I've been you don't know what my past is you don't know the memories that I have we don't know the memories that she had but we know this we know she was the first one to see him if you've had a past if you've had struggles if you've had trouble just remember I just put you in a good place yeah yes the disciples who were raised good and raised with Godly homes and things and taught the scriptures they could not see him first but her that woman who had been delivered out of Seven Devils she saw him she recognized the presence of the Lord she heard his voice Hallelujah we need to recognize what we were delivered from yes so it can appear to us well I'm not one of the disciples why not one went on his own Earthly mother yeah you see Mary Magdalene would be the least credible Witness if all of them if you put her on the witness stand she's the one that would be believed the least because of what her passed had been yeah he was the one who got to tell the story first yeah glory to God listen brother says this he said Mary Magdalene knew his power she knew there was something about him was different from anyone else she had Seven Devils cast out of her he said everybody that's ever been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they're standing [Applause] Hallelujah no one can ever come in his great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore all right you see what I'm still the same you've never come in his presence you've never come in his presence if you ever did you'd never be the same person again sure has a story to you but it's got to become a reality yeah yeah glory to God amen he said no one can ever come and ever be the same person you're changed or something happens to you he said oh you can stand off in Psychology and imagine this and accept this a certain thing some theories or something like that but we don't believe in theology we believe in the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and when you come into His presence there's something that happens in your life that changes you oh we could we could shout about that this morning you're never the same anymore a man that's ever been in the presence of Christ but it mean what's wrong with you what's happened to you I've been in his presence have you made mistakes yes do you have a past yes have you gotten messed up in the past but I've been in his presence I can worship him I can recognize him I've been changing his presence is there anyone else here this morning I can say Amen to that I didn't change in his presence I've heard his voice I've seen him alive he's proved himself to me glory to God Hallelujah look at the Devil she had cast out of her said she had Seven Devils cast out of her Pride Envy and here's one she thought she was so pretty there was no one like her but when Jesus spoke he said be thou clean she become a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own side but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master she loved him I think about and we're going to tie this together after a little bit but I think about when he was proving himself alive in this generation how he come as I preached you many times to a widow named Hattie Wright Moser we call her Hattie right you know the story brother Brandon preaches my new ministry he tells the story for the first time and sister had me and her two boys are sitting there see the god that come in our day he didn't come and tell us later about these things he told us while the people involved were still alive yeah and you think about that's a powerful thing excuse me because in that first church age there were people there who were alive and you can say Jesus didn't raise but you have a hard time convincing Peter that yeah if a hard time convincing Mary Magdalene of that they were there people today can look back and say oh nothing happened with Hattie Wright but she was in the meeting yeah when he told the story yeah and he told her he said here stand up Sister Hattie there's a little widow woman that the miracle happened on first yeah amen and so and he said he talked about her husband how she was in a tragic he was in a tragic farm accident she lost her husband he tells the story he talks about it being in her house and he said it was the greatest anointing that he ever felt more so he said than when he stood in Africa and thirty thousand gave their souls to Christ at one time yes he said here stand up Sister Hattie here's the one the miracle happened on he said bypassing all the peoples of the world for that thing to happen first to that poor little humble widow woman up on the hillside up there trying to raise a crop of corn out of a crawfish ground out there to take care of her children he said that's the one that God honored the first time since the days of Jesus Christ and said ask what you will he said you know why the plutocrats didn't get it or the big folks like that it's because God knew they'd ask things it was no good for them but he gives it to people who he knows will ask the right thing why has he revealed the message of the hour to you why is he giving you the token why has he set you free why does he prove his resurrection to you because you're somebody who can handle it you're somebody who asked for the right thing glory to God yes amen after he appeared to Mary Magdalene he appeared to The Other Women we know the story then appeared to Peter privately Peter needed that yeah the Bible doesn't tell us exactly anything about that it was just meant for him that just says he appeared to him two of the two of the number who are not the Inner Circle they were not of the eleven and they probably were not preachers just lay people but they were on their way to Emmaus later that day yeah yeah going home after the day's events and they were talking about what had happened the Bible says they talked together for all those things which had happened and it come to pass it while they communed together and reasoned you want him to come around talk about him you can talk about the weather you can talk about everything going on that's going on in the world you can talk about politics but you want Jesus to come around in your house talk about him every once in a while talk about it they begin to talk about him Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk in are sad why are you sad he says there's no reason for you to be sad why would you be sad yes sir yes sir after the Passover and and one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him aren't there only a stranger in Jerusalem that's not known the things which are come to pass there in these days he said send unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed in word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and of crucified him but we trusted notice look they put it in the past it didn't happen we trusted that it had been he oh my which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yes yay and certain women also if our company made us astonished which were early at the Sepulcher when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the spectacular and found it even his soul as the women had said now notice why could they still not believe yeah him they saw not watch they hadn't seen him personally so there was no proof oh God and he said unto them Jesus gets ready to preach old fools what a great opening line for a servant whole fools and soul of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew not into the village whether they went he made us know that he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us after this six-hour sermon let's have some fellowship we need to take time to entertain him after we get done hearing the word we'll take a few minutes sometimes and entertain him so we have these brothers come up at the end and seeing it's not when I leave the platform that's not the time to end the worship but the time is you just soak sometimes you in quickly and that's fine but sometimes we need to just let it soak a little bit let the atmosphere come right why would we do that we want to make him welcome we want to come straight and stay with us for a while we need you at work this week we need you at home we need you in the school we need you we need you to be with us so come stay with us it's good he constrained them abide with us for it is toward evening and the day as far as being he went into tarry with them and made him welcome to pass as he said it meet with him he took bread and blessed it break it gave it to them I saw him do something he did when he was here that's how he proves himself yeah Yeah by doing what he did when he was alive yeah Hallelujah he blessed it and break and gave to them now if something happened to brother Joel he got sick and passed away God forbid I even saying that I could feel a cold chill go over the church but if something happened brother Joel I'm picking on him because I can because he'll take it but if something happened to him and he come back later and said he was resurrected and I buried him I put him there in the grave in the ground we said all our kind words about him you don't want to mess up a good funeral you know right that you got him you got him in the ground and you get him all you know and and here he comes back man messing up the program well you know the first thing you'd want him to prove who he was right you could be just a look-alike all right but but if he showed up at church and talks to everybody before service and everybody after you know it's Joel foreign because you know he did something are you with me this morning if if I come back from the dead and I never preached and I never never was me right I'm telling myself if I come back from the dead and I didn't eat biscuits and gravy Fried Chicken yeah yeah or you hearing me now you see me eat you wouldn't believe it was me but if I did something that I did before yeah and here come Christ taking the position as a Master of the House and the head of the table he sits down and he breaks the bread we've seen this before Hallelujah their eyes were open and they knew him Brandon said it was after cleopa said got Jesus in the room him and his friend and Emmaus Jesus broke the bread their eyes come open it was after that was done they could run all night long back up there and tell them disciples truly he's raised from the dead we've seen him right down there well they went back a lot quicker than they come up he said he said we we've seen him right down there and he done the same thing he did like he did before he was crucified he said oh brother today he said there's no need of this Gentile World Turning Away your last sign Jesus Christ has raised from the dead he's here tonight in the form of the Holy Ghost listen to me as brother Andrew likes to say we're not a helpless hopeless bunch of people but what are we today we are the children of God we're the ones who are proving his resurrection today we live in a time when he's done what he said he would do and he did it in our generation we've seen it yeah good yes sir all right and I'll go for a little further he's still doing it yeah we've seen it we yeah yeah we're not just another denomination yeah we've seen it there's no need of you Gentiles turn away your last sign he's here yes yes Hallelujah said he's here to perform and to do just like he did before his crucifixion he's raised from the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he said you could doubt that but if he comes on the scene in a few minutes and performs the same thing he did before his crucifixion he said then you're a sinner If you deny it yes yes oh God help us today yeah sir they turn around to one another and said wait a minute we didn't realize how good of a service that was yeah now that we know he's alive that six hour sermon was a lot easier to take did not her heart burn within us they didn't recognize that they had spiritual heartburn until after they'd seen him and knew that he was alive I knew who he was and then they looked back and said is this message good yeah yeah don't you love the opening of the word why have they've seen him for who he really was seen him do something he did when he was alive they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord has risen indeed now this is what the eleven were saying they come back and they said you can't believe what just happened to us the 11 said oh we know he's risen he appeared to Simon he was seen by 10 of them that evening as eight together and the next week he returns so even doubting Thomas could see he was alive he said come he said put your hands in in the put your put your hand on the hand on the scarf put him in the scars of my hands he said I don't have to Lord I believe now he said more blessed are they who have not seen it yet believe yeah he was seen by seven disciples at the Sea of Tiberius in John 21 3 when Simon Peter you know I preached a sermon one time on Peter's besetting boat because Peter's boat was what he always went back to when he got in a tight spot he always went back to his job that was his job he wasn't fishing for for fun right he quit preaching went back to work and Simon Peter said every time he got discouraged oh if you're discouraged this morning I want you to be encouraged in the fact that he's alive Peter got discouraged even after he had seen him once I said I'm going fishing they said unto him well I guess we got nothing else better to do either we've not been you know it's not like we've been given any kind of commission remember that came later they said we're going with you they went forth entered into his ship immediately the night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples once again they knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus saith unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said it to them casting out on the right side of the ship and you shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes oh God and therefore that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter Peter oh yeah I'm the disciple who Jesus loves you need to listen to me yeah it's the Lord amen Peter's a man of action he's not just going to stand there but it says Peter turn when Peter heard it was the Lord he heard his Fisher's coat unto him for he was naked it means he just had his under underneath his short tunicon and so he grabbed a hold of his Fisher's coat and got dressed to go swimming and cast himself into the sea now why was he so sure why was he so sure because Jesus had just done something that he did when he was alive you remember the first time they ever met yeah yeah Simon Peter is fishing out in the same Lake yeah and they're fishing perhaps that same body of water they're out there fishing they hear a voice from The Shore cast your net on the other side he said but I fished so night and haven't caught nothing and I know how to fish this is my job he said cast it on the other side he said at Thy word Lord I let down the net and he did and when he did it come up and there was more fish than they could handle and when it happened the second time he knew it proved to him that Jesus was alive let me tell you this morning in our generation he's come and done the same thing after 2 000 years he said it's happened again Glory we saw him do you can watch a video and see him do yes what he did when he was alive yeah yeah that's why we don't mimic that sign yeah we don't mock it we don't try to reproduce it yeah right yeah yeah because that sign was one to a generation wasn't just discernment yeah yeah it was a resurrection sign yeah wasn't telling us there was a prophet on the earth though there was but it was telling us there was a God yes same yesterday today and forever but Jesus Christ had risen from the dead yes I will skip forward a little bit because I've run out of time he cooked the fish for him and Jesus says come and die and none of the disciples just asked him said who art thou knowing that it was the Lord I skipped forward several several verses were go to acts 1 8 next to Peter he said let us tell me more than these you all know the story you've seen by James the Bible says another private viewing that James had of Jesus in his resurrection he's seen by the 11 again on the mountain in Galilee and finally he was seen by about 500 as they saw him sinned before he ascended he told them this he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit has come upon you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria under the uttermost parts of the earth when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and the cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee well I stand you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven so shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven now they knew that he was alive now but he did not appear in that form again once he ascended he did not appear in that form again at least to them and so how would they prove to Future Generations that he was alive think about it because eventually that generation would pass away so there had to come some further proof that he was alive and it comes in Acts chapter 2. with the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly he that ascended has also descended and there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they were sinning they appeared into them coven tongues it's like a fire and it said upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues since the spirit gave them utterance what was it it was a proof of his resurrection they became the proof glory to God John 14 or 12 he had told them verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do so he do also Greater Works than these shall he do because I go into my father years later Paul is writing to the Corinthians I love this as he's wrapping up and he's he's proving I love Paul because he proves this point and he's proven to them he says I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures you can deny that if you want to but God but that's what Paul said I believe what Paul said because there was Millions on the other side said we're resting on that glory to God and so now he says he was seen he was a scene of cephas that's Peter then of the twelve after that he was seen of about 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remaining to this President imagine what a powerful testimony that was yeah he said he was seen of these 500 but you know back in that day many of them that were there you know some of them didn't even go to the upper room in fact 380 of them never showed up because we're only 120 men women and children in the upper room so I don't know where the other ones went but maybe the persecution maybe they had a job maybe there was something going on but there was 120 in the upper room so many of them maybe were Witnesses but not Believers yeah think about that for a moment and yet they were seen of all these that were there yeah he said the great apartment of this present but some are falling asleep so now it's been some years later these are starting to die off yeah he said after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles and last of all he was not there when he ascended he was not there when he appeared during the 40 days yeah he was not there any of that time he had no claim to that yeah yet when he lists the witnesses he comes down to the end he says he was seen to me yeah he said about but brother B doesn't appear in that form but the same God turned himself back into the pillar of fire and struck Paul down on the road to Damascus you know the story and Paul every time he gets in a tight spot he goes right back to that testimony why is he why does he do that because that's where Christ appeared to him glory to God and we have to have something like that in our lives where we've met the pillar of fire where this meant this word these people that have seen it in our hour they've seen I've known sister Brown I've known many of the others that that new brother Branham or seen brother Branham or had their name called out and then seen the sign they knew that it was there many of those who've seen it have passed on thank God we still have the video and the tapes but many of those who have seen it have passed on but there's another generation coming up how will I prove to you that he's alive he was seen by granted by Sister Brown he was seen by many others he was seen by a hibiscus he was seen by Peregrine he was seen but last of all he was seen by me they saw him alive it was more than a prophet it was God reacting in this generation but you can declare with me this morning he was seen by me I mean you could say Amen to that today he was seen by me in the new bird he was seen by me I have met the pillar of fire I met the power of this message [Music] if you haven't met him today you need to meet that Pillar of Fire you need to come in those sacred Sams of all he would see to me he was seen by some at the Ohio River Christ making his announcement he was seen by people with that again we've met in the prayer lines performing the very same Resurrection sign he did when he was on the Earth picture was taken with a prophet that's not just a man that that's a pillar of Fire it was not the man but the man was a vessel he was standing by when Christ appeared he appeared in the cloud showed himself in the cloud it was our Lord up there we see him in the opening of the word how many sees him in the opening of the word we see him all through the scriptures like they did on the road to Emmaus but last of all he was seen by me personally yeah yeah when I met him one day Hallelujah Because He Lives I could live listen as the musicians come he said because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was yes what a resurrection this is Glory there had to be somebody who would carry the truth on the future Generations who would it be those who saw him yes after his resurrection in every generation we have seen him after his resurrection what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power what a resurrection it was two thousand years ago as Easter is next Sunday and and as you come to that brother Stewart will be
