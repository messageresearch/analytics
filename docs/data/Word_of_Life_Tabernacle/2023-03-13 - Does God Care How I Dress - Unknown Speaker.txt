Lord of what you are and who you are Lord and everything about us Lord we surrender to you today Lord we believe that you'll be the one that will keep us and help us through all of life's Journeys oh God I pray for this service today especially this afternoon would you just keep me from saying anything that would be wrong Lord may I may only say those things that would be according to your word Lord and I pray for the people today they would receive it in that manner Lord those that may watch or or somehow get a hold of this I pray God that you'd make the word clear to them Lord not the words of a man that's your words which has such value in our lives I thank you for that I pray that you'd heal every sick person touch every heart we pray and we ask you in the precious name of Jesus bless you this evening thank you for coming out to the house of the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 22 and verse 5. Deuteronomy 22 and 5. my purpose today this afternoon is to answer the question from the word of God we're going to take it strictly from the scriptures this afternoon does God care how I dress does God care how I dress I know some of you have asked that question and maybe you have relatives or friends that don't necessarily believe the way that we do and I want to try to answer that from the scripture today so that you can have ammunition and not to fight with necessarily with the people but actually to defend what you believe the Bible tells us to always have an answer for what we believe and and so that people would understand if they really care about the word of God that they would understand about why we do what we do Deuteronomy 22 and 5 I'll say this ultimately it has to come from the heart and so all of these things it has to be a revelation to you from your heart for you to be able to follow it Deuteronomy 22 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated this evening yeah I would say first of all the answer to the question does God care how I dress is yes He does care how I dress and the reason I know that is he expressed that to me in the word of God now if you do not believe that the Bible is the word of God then we have very little to discuss because the Bible has to be our ultimate it has to be our absolute and we live in an age when that is not the case but look at at what uh what happens when the scriptures are no longer the absolute we can even look at our nation and see the degradation of it and see what's happened because the scriptures are no longer the absolute for the nation and and we can look at other nations and see if you look at Russia at the turn of the last century they made a conscious decision to actually turn away from God so we don't want churches anymore we don't want God we uh we don't want anything to do with that we're going to make our own morality our own way of living and it was Alexander Solstice who was in the gulags and wrote the book the gulag archipelago uh and it it's a great book it tells you about communism and and the horrors of that and and as he was uh he was telling about that and he said when he was a child he said he recalled the elders during that time as he had seen this great Communist Revolution come over Russia and the elders were trying to explain to the younger people what had happened what what had caused all the death camps what was it that uh that made the people just become like animals and treat one another in that way and he summed it up this way he said men have forgotten God men have forgotten God and that was the oh that was the ultimate why they ended up the way that they did and so we want to understand today that when God is forgotten that Society goes into Decline and it ends up being a free-for-all people can do whatever they want to do but we do have a standard today we believe that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness uh the world the church today doesn't always believe that I I don't know how many of you know Charles Stanley uh Charles Stanley was a a great preacher he's a Baptist preacher and you can listen to him on the radio or on television uh Charles believed in the inerrancy of the word of God and as a Baptist we disagree on many things in theology but he agreed we did agree that the Bible is the word of God well the Next Generation doesn't necessarily believe that he has a son named Andy Stanley and it's uh been out there it's public knowledge I'm not saying something out telling Tales out of school tonight but Andy is also a pastor in Atlanta in the same city has a mega church and Andy's taking a different view on the Bible and I will say this if you take this view on the Bible then Anything Goes and this is his view of the scripture he said the time has come for us to take a step back onto a more sure-footing he said and I think a firmer foundation and to build our case for our congregations and for this millennial generation on the event of the resurrection and not on the authenticity or the infallibility of a text and the problem with that is you don't know that there was a resurrection unless you believe the Bible is true right we are we the Christian religion is about the resurrection of the death burial and resurrection of Christ but the word is the only way that we even know that that's true and so all things are negotiable if you believe that way with the Bible we believe that all scripture is inspired of God without the Bible we become slaves to our own morality or the lack thereof so we believe again that all scriptures someone say that with me tonight all scripture is given by inspiration of God so we believe that the reveal word of God is our absolute now I there's several objections that people will give you when you begin to talk about does God care how I dress I don't want you young people especially to listen tonight and and pay attention because you'll hear this in school or even if you're not in public school you'll hear this from family members and people that'll say well God doesn't care how I dress because he looks at the heart how many of you have told been told that right many of us have and it's it's true God does look at the heart right you could be a a person who dresses just right everything long dresses long hair and and nothing wrong at all in the way that you dress and you could be a sinner it has nothing to do with whether you're saved or not in that sense because when you're you could be you could be just as much a sinner as the drunkard is if you've never accepted Christ in your heart and believed and been baptized and been filled with the Holy Spirit those things are necessary for salvation dress is something that follows that we want to please the Lord and we want to follow the dictates of his word because it matters his word matters but they take that from first Samuel 16 7. it says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man who gets on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart this is David when he's walking out there a little bitty shrimp of a fellow and and and God is speaking to the prophet Samuel he says don't don't look at at their at their height or their stature Brother David aren't you glad God God doesn't just look at height and I'm so glad God this doesn't take skinny people or God doesn't just take one kind of person but he said he looks at the heart and yet we look at the scripture we know that we are fruit-bearing trees in Matthew 12 35 Jesus said a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things how many want to bring forth good things out of your life so a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart brings forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things now we must live the word Not Just Hear It the Bible says in James 1 22 but be doers of the word and not here is only deceiving your own selves or if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's liking to a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he wants but who's so looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continuous Therian he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the word this man shall be blessed in his deed I don't want to just be saved I want to be blessed I want to do what's right and I think it shows if you are saved whether you follow the word so the next thing that people will tell you usually is well God only cared about dress under the law right and and a lot of you probably heard that as well well uh the scripture that we read was in Deuteronomy right that's under Moses law so God doesn't care about that and they'll tell you something like well if you're going to wear a dress if your women wear dresses and your men wear pants and maybe we ought to go back and start sacrificing bulls and goats again and but we realize that the ceremonial aspects of the law were were filled up in Christ they were fulfilled in Christ right but I'll say this you say well I don't have to dress like that well does that mean you can go murder people because the Bible says thou shall not kill thou shall not murder right it says thou shall not steal that's Old Testament does that mean we can go steal steal things from people and it's okay right and people just don't they generally take what fits their idea but but I'll say this that God did care about dress under the law and he continued to care about it in the New Testament and so we have scripture for that now I will say this even if it were true that was only that it was only written in the Old Testament why would that matter because New Testament Christians understand that Christ come to fulfill the law not to destroy it in Matthew 5 and 17 he said Thank not that I've come to destroy the law or the prophets I have not come to destroy but to fulfill verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one shot or one till shall no wise passed them on in other words not even the punctuation will pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven you say well that's the least of The Commandments well he said whoever breaks the least of The Commandments shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven and I want to enter in don't you so these instructions that we read in our text The man shall not wear pertains to a woman the woman should not wear what pertains to a man that's not based on any ceremony right or any any kind of any kind of something that was fulfilled in Christ but it's based on the god-ordained
