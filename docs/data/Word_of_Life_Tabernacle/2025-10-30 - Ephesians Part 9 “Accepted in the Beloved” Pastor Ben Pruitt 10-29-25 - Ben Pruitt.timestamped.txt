[34:12] prophet taught us whatever you expect is
[34:14] what you get out of a service. If you

[34:30] message of brother Brandham was to come
[34:31] and declare that he is here [music]
[34:33] present among us and if we remember that
[34:36] he's the great one. We're all under him.
[34:39] There's no big eyes or little U's. We're
[34:41] all [music] we're all under him. We're
[34:43] all on the it's all at the ground is
[34:44] level at the foot of the cross. Aren't
[34:46] you thankful tonight? Amen. That there
[34:48] has been something great done in our
[34:50] lives and that we have a desire to be
[34:52] here and to hear the word of the Lord.
[34:54] So, as our pastor comes, I want you to
[34:56] be under expectation that if you have a
[34:57] need tonight, he can walk right down
[34:59] your aisle and into your seat [music]
[35:01] and he can do whatever you have need of.
[35:03] Brother Bill, he can raise you up,
[35:05] buddy. He sure can. Amen. I see several
[35:07] among us that have needs on your heart.
[35:09] Just hold your need on your heart
[35:10] tonight. Amen. I know God can meet every
[35:12] need. Do you believe it? Amen. Let's
[35:14] sing this with all of our [music] hearts
[35:15] now. Reach out and touch the Lord
[35:20] [music] as he
[35:23] goes [singing] by.
[35:25] And you'll [music] find
[35:28] he's not too busy
[35:32] to [singing] hear your heart's cry.
[35:37] Oh, [singing] he's [music] passing
[35:40] by this moment.
[35:43] your needs to
[35:46] supply. [music]
[35:48] Oh, [singing] reach out
[35:51] and touch the Lord
[35:54] as [singing] he
[35:57] goes by. Well, can you reach up? Reach
[36:00] [music and singing] up
[36:02] and touch the Lord
[36:06] as he [music and singing]
[36:08] goes by.
[36:10] And you'll find
[36:13] he's not too [singing and music] busy
[36:17] to hear your heart's [music]
[36:20] cry. [singing] Oh, he's passing
[36:25] by this moment, [music]
[36:28] your [singing] needs to
[36:31] supply.
[36:33] Just reach [music and singing] up
[36:36] and touch the Lord
[36:40] as he
[36:42] Oh, one more time with all your hearts
[36:44] now. Oh, reach out
[36:47] and touch [music] the Lord. [singing]
[36:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're fine.
[36:59] He's [singing] never too busy
[37:03] [music] to hear your heart [singing]
[37:06] cry.
[37:08] Oh, he's there.
[37:11] Sing by this [music] moment. [singing]
[37:13] Do you believe it tonight?
[37:15] He's to
[37:17] supply. [music]
[37:19] Oh, reach [singing] out
[37:22] and touch the Lord
[37:25] as [singing and music] he
[37:28] goes by.
[37:32] Let's bow our heads while they continue
[37:34] to play. Heavenly Father, we're so
[37:36] grateful to be your children, Lord, to
[37:39] be able to gather together with those of
[37:41] like precious faith. It's the most
[37:43] wonderful [music]
[37:44] thing, Lord. As the prophet taught us,
[37:47] it ought to be a thrill to us to gather
[37:49] together. And it is, Lord, we thank you
[37:52] for that. [music] I I pray that you just
[37:54] move in every situation, Lord. You know
[37:57] what every need is, every [music] heart,
[38:00] what's on it. Pray you'd move me out of
[38:02] the way, Lord. Lord, I I [music] realize
[38:05] I'm insufficient in myself to get across
[38:08] what you put on my heart, but I know
[38:10] that you're able, Lord, and I've seen
[38:12] you many times do it before. Won't you
[38:15] meet us here again, Lord, by [music] the
[38:17] well? Lord, discern the secrets of our
[38:20] hearts tonight by your word. We'll give
[38:22] you the thanks and the praise in Jesus
[38:25] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[38:28] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 6.
[38:31] Ephesians 1 and 6. We'll go right back
[38:33] into our series on the book of
[38:35] Ephesians. I trust that you've enjoyed
[38:37] uh so far. We haven't gotten very far.
[38:39] We're just down to verse six. But uh
[38:42] just the Lord has been blessing us and I
[38:44] I've really enjoyed preaching it. So
[38:46] good to have each and every one of you
[38:48] here tonight. Our look it's like our
[38:49] regular Wednesday night crowd. Some are
[38:51] missing. Praying for those that are sick
[38:53] and in need tonight and I'm able to be
[38:56] here. Good to have uh Brother Wayne here
[38:58] tonight and playing the guitar. It's
[39:01] just a wonderful uh wonderful thing. I
[39:05] uh watch our older generation as they
[39:07] get older. And you know, one thing you
[39:09] can say for them, they were faithful to
[39:11] the house of God. And I appreciate that.
[39:14] And I hope some of our younger ones
[39:15] emulate that in their lives because we
[39:17] wouldn't have a church if it wasn't for
[39:19] some of you older folks that just really
[39:22] were faithful to the house of the Lord.
[39:24] And so, it's good to see each and every
[39:25] one of you. Ephesians 1:6 says, "To the
[39:27] praise of the glory of his grace,
[39:30] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[39:35] beloved." He hath made us accepted in
[39:37] the beloved. I pray the Lord would add
[39:38] his blessing to the word. You may be
[39:40] seated this evening. That word accepted
[39:44] is uh I'll pronounce this wrong but
[39:46] herto. It's to bestow favor on someone
[39:50] to give someone a benefit out of favor
[39:53] and kindness. It's grace.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; It's what the word is from grace. So he
[40:00] has made us accepted means he has given
[40:03] us grace or he has made us grace. If
[40:07] that makes sense to you. The only other
[40:10] place in the New Testament that that
[40:12] word is used is Luke chapter 1 and verse
[40:14] 28 where the angel come to Mary and said
[40:16] hail thou that are highly favored. That
[40:19] word high that those words highly
[40:20] favored is the same Greek word that
[40:23] means to have grace. You've been given
[40:25] grace. And and uh I I believe that it's
[40:29] not just Mary that was given grace to
[40:31] carry the word, but you and I have been
[40:33] given grace today to be the word and to
[40:36] have the word birthed in our hearts. So
[40:38] he said, you have been accepted in the
[40:41] beloved. And we know that he is the
[40:43] beloved. You know, I've always kind of
[40:45] taken that verse wrong. It's amazing,
[40:47] brother Herald, as we go on in in life,
[40:50] we we learn things, don't we? We we
[40:52] learn things we never knew. And I've
[40:54] always taken that beloved as being
[40:56] accepted among the saints or accepted in
[40:58] the church. But that's not actually what
[41:01] it is at all. It's actually being
[41:03] accepted in Christ because the beloved
[41:07] is Christ. And yet we are beloved by
[41:11] being in Christ. So we are included by
[41:13] grace in his beloved. That's what it
[41:16] means to be accepted. Romans 9:25
[41:19] said quoting Isaiah as he said also also
[41:21] in Isaiah I will call them my people or
[41:24] Hosea rather I will call them my people
[41:26] which were not my people and her beloved
[41:28] which was not beloved. So he said I'm
[41:31] going to call you beloved. You were not
[41:33] beloved. You were not you were not what
[41:36] he was but because of him he said I'm
[41:38] going to call you beloved. Paul tells
[41:41] the Thessalonians in 1 Thessalonians 1:4
[41:44] that they were the beloved. And and he
[41:46] said, "We know this because of what God
[41:48] did uh through his ministry to reach
[41:52] them." And uh and he says it like this.
[41:54] He said, "Knowing, brethren, beloved,
[41:57] your election of God." Aren't you glad
[41:59] to be elected of God? Aren't you glad to
[42:02] be of the beloved? He said, "We know
[42:03] your election." Now look how we know it.
[42:05] 1 Thessalonians 1:5. For our gospel came
[42:08] not unto you in word only, but also in
[42:11] power and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[42:14] assurance as you know what manner of men
[42:16] we were among you for your sake. So he's
[42:20] saying that we know that you are
[42:22] elected. We know that you are beloved or
[42:24] that you are accepted in the beloved
[42:27] because of what God did to find you. I
[42:30] there's a great revelation there. God
[42:32] through a prophet. He did many mighty
[42:34] works in our day to find you. He said,
[42:37] "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[42:40] before the coming the of the great and
[42:42] dreadful day of the Lord." What was he
[42:43] doing? It was our gospel coming not in
[42:46] word only, but also in power to find us,
[42:49] proving that we were the elected. He
[42:52] sent a pillar of fire because we are the
[42:54] beloved of God. That was grace to us. He
[42:57] sent a an Elohim message. He sent a a
[43:01] son of man ministry so that we could
[43:04] know that we were the elected of God.
[43:06] Oh, that ought to make us shout all over
[43:08] the building tonight.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I know you're tired on a Wednesday night
[43:11] and you've BEEN WORKING, BUT THERE'S
[43:13] SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. BROTHER GABE,
[43:14] ought to mean something to you that THAT
[43:16] THAT WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOD
[43:19] BECAUSE HE'S DONE SO MANY GREAT WORKS IN
[43:21] OUR AGE. And not just with brother
[43:23] Brandham, but we've seen the miraculous
[43:25] in our lives. And why do WE SEE THAT?
[43:27] BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.
[43:30] You're the beloved of the Lord. You're
[43:32] accepted in the beloved.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; It's an assurance of election. Say 2
[43:39] Thessalonians 2:13 says, "But we are
[43:40] bound to give thanks always to God for
[43:44] you, brethren, beloved." I love that.
[43:48] Brethren, beloved of the Lord, because
[43:51] God hath from the beginning chosen you
[43:53] to salvation through sanctification of
[43:55] the spirit and belief of the truth,
[43:57] where to he called you by our gospel to
[44:00] the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
[44:02] Jesus Christ. So he called you to be
[44:05] accepted in the beloved. We are beloved
[44:07] in him as Mary was beloved. We are
[44:10] accepted in the beloved, greatly
[44:12] blessed, highly favored. How many
[44:13] believe that tonight? You say, "But I'm
[44:15] sick tonight." but you're greatly
[44:16] blessed. I'M SICK TONIGHT, BUT YOU'RE
[44:18] HIGHLY FAVORED. OH, IT DON'T MATTER WHAT
[44:20] CONDITION OF LIFE THAT WE'RE GOING
[44:22] THROUGH. WE'RE NOT ACCEPTED BY OUR
[44:24] CONDITION OF LIFE. WE'RE ACCEPTED in the
[44:26] beloved.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And and so, Brother Brandham comments on
[44:33] this scripture, and I'm so thankful for
[44:35] a word prophet in our day.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Where he says, "Wherein has made us
[44:40] acceptable by the person
[44:43] &gt;&gt; beloved, which is Christ, made us
[44:46] accepted. How? By him.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; How do we get into him? By one spirit.
[44:52] All baptized
[44:53] &gt;&gt; into him. So if you have the Holy Spirit
[44:56] today, you are accepted. You've been
[44:59] given grace, highly favored in the
[45:03] beloved, which is Christ.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I think one of the worst things
[45:08] that a believer can have is an
[45:11] inferiority complex.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Right? And we get that though sometimes,
[45:15] don't we? We we we get where we don't
[45:18] fit in. We don't, you know, I I don't
[45:20] because of my background or because of
[45:22] something I've been through or because
[45:24] of uh way things have happened in my
[45:26] life, we get an inferiority call. And
[45:28] I'm just going to preach to you a little
[45:29] bit tonight. And because I feel this
[45:31] myself that maybe you didn't get to go
[45:33] and do everything that everybody else
[45:35] got to go and do as a young person.
[45:37] Maybe you were in sin. Maybe you were
[45:38] raised in a home where things were
[45:40] wrong. Maybe you were raised in a church
[45:42] that didn't believe in the Holy Ghost
[45:43] and the move of God and you didn't get
[45:44] to do what everybody else got to do and
[45:46] and so now you're older and you feel
[45:49] kind of inferior and I said, "Well, if I
[45:50] had if id have come this way, if I'd
[45:53] have been raised different in a
[45:54] different church or in a different
[45:55] environment, BUT GOD BROUGHT YOU UP THE
[45:57] WAY HE BROUGHT YOU UP for a reason." AND
[45:59] HE BROUGHT YOU BY THE PATH THAT HE
[46:01] BROUGHT YOU BY FOR A REASON. Do we
[46:03] believe that tonight? AND WE ARE NOT
[46:06] ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF OUR BACKGROUND. WE
[46:08] ARE NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHERE WE
[46:10] COME FROM OR WHAT WE'VE DONE OR OUR
[46:12] EFFORTS EVEN IN THE CHURCH. WE ARE
[46:14] ACCEPTED IN THE beloved tonight.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:21] He He is accepted by one spirit. He's
[46:23] accepted us into him. So, we should not
[46:26] feel inferior. Our histories might be
[46:29] different, but our future is the same.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Bill, I could look around
[46:36] at each one of us. every one of us and
[46:38] see different histories
[46:42] &gt;&gt; and history might have been yesterday
[46:45] &gt;&gt; right
[46:47] &gt;&gt; our histories might be different but our
[46:50] future is the same
[46:52] &gt;&gt; if we have been accepted in the beloved
[46:55] oh we we ought not be rejected by the
[46:58] church
[47:01] &gt;&gt; right and yet sometimes we are
[47:04] &gt;&gt; but the answer to that is not h not to
[47:06] have an inferiority ity complex or to
[47:08] get a complex about it or to feel bad
[47:10] about it or pull off by ourselves and
[47:12] sit IN OUR HOME AND AND NOT GO TO CHURCH
[47:14] AND not listen to people, not do No, THE
[47:17] THING TO DO is to just REALIZE I'M
[47:20] ACCEPTED IN CHRIST. I DON'T HAVE TO BE
[47:22] ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE. I DON'T HAVE TO
[47:24] OH, COME ON, CHURCH. MY MINISTRY,
[47:26] LISTEN. UH I HAVE TO I HAD TO COME TO A
[47:28] PLACE IN MY MINISTRY. I REALIZED IT WAS
[47:30] NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTED BY EVERYBODY.
[47:31] I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY,
[47:33] BUT I'M ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED AND
[47:35] THAT'S ENOUGH. LET ME DO EVERYTHING I
[47:37] CAN DO. SURE, I'LL MAKE MISTAKES. SURE,
[47:39] SO WILL YOU. EVERY ONE OF US WILL. SURE,
[47:41] WE'LL FAIL SOMETIMES. BUT WE ARE NOT
[47:43] ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO. WE'RE
[47:46] ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE BY ONE SPIRIT, WE'VE BEEN
[47:51] BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY. HOW MANY BELIEVE
[47:53] THAT TONIGHT?
[47:55] &gt;&gt; WE ARE ACCEPTED. BEHOLD, HALLELUJAH.
[47:57] Because of who he is, we don't HAVE TO
[47:59] FEEL INFERIOR TO NOBODY.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. That's good.
[48:05] Hallelujah. Look at all the churches
[48:07] that Paul wrote to. They were all
[48:09] different.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; I sent Joel a scripture today where Paul
[48:15] told the Corinthian church, he said, "I
[48:16] robbed other churches, took wages from
[48:19] them to come to you." He wasn't happy
[48:21] with them.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; That word rob's pretty strong.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; He wasn't happy with what they were
[48:26] doing, but they were still saints.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:31] They all come up different ways and come
[48:33] from different backgrounds, but they
[48:35] were still saints of God.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; They were all different. He had to deal
[48:39] with them differently, but they were
[48:41] accepted in him. Ephesians 1:7, in whom
[48:45] we have redemption through his blood.
[48:47] And we're going to come back to this
[48:48] idea of accepted in just a moment. But
[48:51] he said we have redemption through his
[48:52] blood. So this is how we are accepted,
[48:55] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[48:58] riches of his grace. But Brandon said,
[49:00] "How can you preach predestination of
[49:02] God's fordaining and setting unless
[49:04] there's a sin atonement somewhere?"
[49:07] &gt;&gt; So there's got to be a sin atonement for
[49:09] us to preach predestination,
[49:12] &gt;&gt; right? And that's just the truth,
[49:13] church. I can't make it without
[49:15] predestination and an atonement,
[49:18] &gt;&gt; right? And and I can't make it without
[49:20] an atonement. even the predestinated and
[49:22] the fore ordained and even the the
[49:25] called and and whatever it is that you
[49:27] are you you must have an atonement for
[49:30] you to be able to make it. Brother
[49:32] Brandon said, "Why is it?" I know some
[49:34] people don't believe they've ever made a
[49:35] mistake, but Brother Brandham says
[49:37] differently. PAUL TAUGHT DIFFERENTLY.
[49:39] Each day,
[49:40] &gt;&gt; someone say, "Each day,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; you do wrong."
[49:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about running around
[49:46] with women. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DOING
[49:48] things that are, you know, uh just
[49:50] anti-word and antichrist. I'm talking
[49:52] about just living.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Right. Each day you make a mistake.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. EACH DAY YOU DO WRONG. BUT
[50:02] IF YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, man or woman,
[50:05] hallelujah, as soon as you MAKE THE
[50:07] MISTAKE, GOD KNOWS YOU'RE SORRY FOR IT.
[50:09] You would stand in the presence of
[50:10] President Roosevelt OR ANYONE ELSE, AND
[50:12] SAY, "I'M WRONG. GOD, FORGIVE ME FOR
[50:14] this thing." Hallelujah. He said, "You
[50:16] notice that sins
[50:19] from verse 7 that sins s i n s a sinner
[50:21] is a sinner. He he does not commit
[50:24] sins."
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told us not to not to think
[50:27] to be too hard on the sinner for
[50:29] drinking. Right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; It's just what sinners do,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't not too hard on them for
[50:34] doing drugs. That's what sinners do.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Christians don't do that. Sinners do
[50:39] that,
[50:40] &gt;&gt; right? But but he said he said he does
[50:42] not commit sins. But the church commits
[50:43] sins.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Does wrong, gets a wrong thought,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; a wrong impression,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; You you can be led wrong.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Right. You can be misled. You can be uh
[50:59] temporarily deceived if I can put it
[51:01] like that. The elect won't be deceived,
[51:03] but you can be temporarily misled,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; right? You you brother put it this way.
[51:08] He said wrong impression makes scruples,
[51:12] &gt;&gt; WOBBLES LIKE A LITTLE CHILD WALKING,
[51:15] TRYING this is a beautiful picture
[51:16] trying to learn how to walk. He just
[51:18] don't know how to walk good yet cuz he's
[51:20] a little boy. But we have a hand that
[51:23] reaches down and gets us and steadies US
[51:25] AND SAYS, "MAKE THIS STEP THIS WAY, SON.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; MAKE THIS STEP THIS WAY, SON." I
[51:31] REMEMBER WHEN Peter was really, really
[51:32] young and he and he was just learning TO
[51:34] WALK AND WE'D WATCH HIM, you know, and
[51:36] how you do it. We don't do that no more.
[51:38] You know, now if he falls in the living
[51:39] room, we all laugh. But
[51:43] there was a time when Peter would, you
[51:45] know, we sit there and I'd sit on one
[51:46] side, one couch, and she'd sit on
[51:47] another chair and and we'd watch Peter
[51:50] as he begin to walk by. Your kids were
[51:52] special to you. You were with them all
[51:53] during those times,
[51:55] &gt;&gt; right? And you you you were there when
[51:57] they don't even remember. You remember.
[51:58] And I remember sitting there and he just
[52:01] beginning to learn to walk. And when he
[52:03] made one step, it's like you did so
[52:05] good.
[52:08] You didn't sit there with a belt.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. I know you didn't.
[52:15] You You didn't sit there with a belt and
[52:17] whoop him because you didn't make two
[52:18] steps or five steps or whatever.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; No, you did everything YOU COULD TO
[52:22] ENCOURAGE THAT CHILD.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; MAKE ANOTHER STEP. MAKE ANOTHER STEP.
[52:26] THAT'S THE WAY WE OUGHT TO TREAT PEOPLE
[52:27] WHO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. MAKE
[52:28] ANOTHER STEP. LORD, HELP US to do that.
[52:31] Make another step. If they if they're if
[52:33] they're willing to say, "I'm a sinner. I
[52:36] NEED HELP." THEN HERE'S A HAND THAT CAN
[52:38] REACH DOWN AND HELP YOU.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Got to recognize they're a sinner. But
[52:42] if they're willing to do that,
[52:44] &gt;&gt; here's a hand.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't pick us up and spank
[52:50] us cuz we make a mist made a mistake.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He doesn't beat us to death because
[52:55] we're trying to walk.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; He loves us like we love our children."
[52:59] &gt;&gt; A real real daddy wouldn't whip his
[53:01] child when he's trying to walk. If he
[53:03] falls down on the floor, reach right
[53:05] down with a big strong hand. PICK HIM
[53:07] UP. TAKE BOTH HANDS A HOLD OF HIM AND
[53:09] SAY, "THIS is the way you do it, son.
[53:11] Walk like this." That's the way God does
[53:14] his church. Reaches down, gets him in
[53:16] his arm, picks him up, and say, "Walk
[53:17] like this, son. Here, DON'T SAY IT LIKE
[53:19] THAT. TALK IT LIKE THIS. I DON'T CARE
[53:21] WHAT THE CHURCH SAYS, WHAT this says,
[53:23] what that says. YOU SAY IT LIKE THIS."
[53:25] He said, "If my word preaches it, you
[53:27] stay right with it. Walk with it. STAY
[53:29] RIGHT WITH IT. DON'T CARE WHAT everybody
[53:30] else says. STAY RIGHT WITH IT. WALK LIKE
[53:32] THIS. THIS IS THE way you make your
[53:33] steps. Our sins, an atonement love FOR
[53:36] OUR SINS. OR WE NEVER HAVE A CHANCE. HOW
[53:38] MANY CAN CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH THAT
[53:40] THOUGHT TONIGHT? IF IT WASN'T FOR AN
[53:42] ATONEMENT LOVE, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE A
[53:44] CHANCE. HOW WE COULD JUST anchor on them
[53:46] words.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:50] Oh, that's enough right there. I know
[53:52] you say, "Brother Ben, I've heard it
[53:53] before." But I think we need to run it
[53:55] through our brain and let it get down
[53:57] into the soul AND BEGIN TO REALLY
[53:59] BAPTIZE US WITH THE REVELATION OF THE
[54:01] FACT THAT HE'S WANTING US TO LEARN TO
[54:03] WALK AND HE'S HELPING US WALK.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's atonement.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:13] I think sometimes we struggle with being
[54:16] accepted in the beloved because we've
[54:18] not really accepted
[54:20] but we are accepted.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; See if we know we are accepted in him
[54:28] and he is
[54:29] &gt;&gt; the beloved
[54:31] word beloved is agape by the way
[54:34] &gt;&gt; brother Brand was that great divine
[54:36] attribute of God called love. Right?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And we've been baptized by one spirit
[54:42] into the body. Why can why would we
[54:45] condemn ourselves
[54:47] or anyone else for that matter?
[54:50] Jesus
[54:54] &gt;&gt; happened to be there when the woman was
[54:55] caught in adultery and
[54:58] you know he knew her heart.
[55:02] Maybe she was in a situation that she
[55:05] didn't want to be in, but she was there.
[55:07] And and maybe maybe she did. Maybe she
[55:10] did want to be in it. She didn't want to
[55:11] be in it after they started stoning her
[55:13] or getting ready to. But
[55:15] &gt;&gt; they drug her out. And
[55:18] outside of the town and they were going
[55:19] to use it as a way to tempt Tim because
[55:21] they knew he
[55:23] &gt;&gt; he always took up for sinners. And
[55:26] &gt;&gt; so they drug outside the town. They
[55:28] said, "Jesus, you know what? Do you say
[55:31] about her that she was caught in the
[55:33] act?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; So her past was very recent.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; And you know person can be accepted in
[55:42] the beloved in a moment.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Right. You say but brother Ben I carried
[55:48] in something to the church. Well you
[55:50] might have got the Holy Ghost sitting
[55:51] here. You said that's impossible. No
[55:52] it's not because that's how it happened
[55:54] in Cornelius's house.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; While they heard the word they received
[55:58] the Holy Ghost.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Right. and become accepted in the
[56:01] beloved. So, you know, things like that
[56:04] can happen. And here was a woman sitting
[56:06] there or down on the ground where they'd
[56:09] thrown her. And Jesus of course said,
[56:11] "He that has s sin," he first he writes
[56:14] on the ground. He says, "He that has sin
[56:17] or no sin," he said, "ccast the first
[56:18] stone." And the oldest ones was the
[56:21] wisest. So, they left first. And then
[56:24] the younger ones finally realized, "Hey,
[56:25] you know, we got problems, too." And
[56:28] they left. And pretty soon it was just
[56:30] her and Jesus. And the truth is he was
[56:31] the only one that could condemn her and
[56:33] he wouldn't.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; But we we we want to be accepted,
[56:42] but what we want to do is be accepted by
[56:44] him. See, they were never going to
[56:46] accept her,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; but he would.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; he would.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; She just had to be willing to give up
[56:53] her life of sin. He said, "Go and sin no
[56:55] more."
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Right. She had to be willing to give up
[56:58] her life of sin. She couldn't stay the
[57:00] way she was. She couldn't fight him.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; But she was there as vulnerable as she
[57:05] was. And and he with the only opinion
[57:08] that mattered. And what did he do? By
[57:11] the message, he revealed his thoughts to
[57:13] her.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you can see it tonight. WHAT
[57:16] HAS HE DONE IN OUR AGE? WE WERE CAUGHT
[57:18] IN SIN. WE WERE A WOMAN CAUGHT IN
[57:20] ADULTERY. And he HE WROTE SOMETHING TO
[57:23] US. SEE, HE SPOKE SOMETHING TO US AND HE
[57:26] SAID, "GO AND SIN NO MORE." AND WE WERE
[57:28] ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; We were accepted in him. See, even if
[57:34] you're the most recent convert in the
[57:36] church, you're still accepted in the
[57:39] beloved one, Christ Jesus. Like I said,
[57:41] if you receive the Holy Ghost coming
[57:42] through those doors,
[57:45] right? If you if YOU RECEIVED IT WHILE
[57:47] THE PREACHING WAS GOING ON,
[57:50] &gt;&gt; you are still accepted
[57:52] &gt;&gt; in the beloved.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "SOMETIMES YOU PREACH
[57:56] HARD." I KNOW I do. I'VE GOT TO
[57:58] SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WE'VE GOT TO SAY
[58:00] THINGS THAT ARE HARSH. SOMETIMES WE GOT
[58:02] TO WE GOT TO REMIND people of sin
[58:04] because we WANT THEM TO REPENT BECAUSE
[58:06] WE KNOW IF THEY CAN REPENT, THEY CAN GET
[58:08] TO JESUS. WE KNOW IF THEY REPENT, THEY
[58:10] CAN BE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. WE KNOW
[58:12] IF THEY CAN LET GO OF THEMSELVES,
[58:14] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; They can be made whole.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Preachers are
[58:21] called prophets and teachers and
[58:23] evangelists and pastors." So where they
[58:24] receive the Holy Ghost and then a gift
[58:26] to do these things with it, but God
[58:29] don't have any little bitty children or
[58:30] great big children. They're all children
[58:32] to him. That's exactly right. And you're
[58:35] rightly positioned. It's sitting right
[58:37] now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[58:39] with every power. How many believe that
[58:41] tonight?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; That's where I belong.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandon, I'm the least
[58:45] in the church. I'm just a little bitty
[58:47] fellow." But remember, when he ascended
[58:50] on high, you are raised with him.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You're in the body and you're with
[58:54] Christ right now, seated in heavenly
[58:57] places. If you're the skin on the bottom
[58:59] of the feet, every devil is underneath
[59:02] you. [applause]
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do we believe that tonight?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. the church. He said, "Where the
[59:09] head is, the body is with it. And if we
[59:11] be buried, died, buried in Christ, and
[59:13] we're raised with him in his
[59:14] resurrection and set in heavenly places
[59:16] in Christ Jesus with every fire of hell
[59:19] under us. NO MATTER HOW LITTLE you are,
[59:22] every devil is under you." Why? Our
[59:24] great conqueror has conquered every sin,
[59:27] everything, every sickness, even death
[59:28] itself. That's right. We are more than
[59:31] conquerors in him. Do you believe you're
[59:33] accepted in the beloved? Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to deal and forgive me for
[59:38] being uh teaching a little bit tonight,
[59:39] but I want to deal with this idea of not
[59:42] being accepted by people. You know, Paul
[59:46] was predestined to be who he was.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; And he was accepted in the beloved once
[59:52] he was born again.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; But he was accepted by God before he was
[59:58] accepted by the church. And you say,
[59:59] "Why?" Because they are human.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Paul was a bad guy.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 9 verse1 Saul was breathing
[1:00:08] out threatenings and solder against the
[1:00:10] disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[1:00:11] priest and desired of him letters to
[1:00:13] Damascus to the synagogues. By the way,
[1:00:15] if you're questioning why did you go to
[1:00:16] Paul's? Cuz brother Brandham does an
[1:00:18] adoption.
[1:00:19] Said that if he found any of this way,
[1:00:21] whether they were men or women, he might
[1:00:22] bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; This man was going to be the messenger
[1:00:27] to the Gentiles. But you couldn't
[1:00:29] approve it right then.
[1:00:32] the angel to the first church age, one
[1:00:34] of the seven stars in his hand. And
[1:00:36] that's what he was going to be, but you
[1:00:38] couldn't have proved it to nobody there.
[1:00:40] And brother Brandon, he says this about
[1:00:42] that. He I'm actually using the context
[1:00:45] of that sermon brother Brandon preaches.
[1:00:47] He said, "How do you know that that old
[1:00:49] bootleger down here is not predestinated
[1:00:51] to life? How do you know that old street
[1:00:53] walker you won't even speak to? How do
[1:00:54] you know a little handshake and invite
[1:00:56] her to church wouldn't make a saint of
[1:00:57] God out of her yondering glory? How do
[1:01:00] you know she's not? He said, "That's
[1:01:01] what we don't know." So, we don't know
[1:01:03] who is or who isn't, but that's our
[1:01:05] duty. Like a fisherman threw a net in
[1:01:06] the sea and pulled out. He brought frogs
[1:01:08] and fish and lizards and water, spiders
[1:01:10] and everything else, but some of them
[1:01:12] was fish. He didn't know. He just cast a
[1:01:14] net. That's what we do. He said, "Watch
[1:01:17] Paul."
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; See, God gets a hold of him. Now, and we
[1:01:22] have to say, God really got a hold of
[1:01:23] him. He knocked him off of his high
[1:01:24] horse and knocked him off there in the
[1:01:27] sand. And he he he saw a light and heard
[1:01:29] a voice. He said Paul Saul Saul, why
[1:01:31] persecutest thou me? And he's laying
[1:01:33] there in the sand. He said, "WHO ARE
[1:01:35] YOU, LORD?" HE SAID, "I'M Jesus whom
[1:01:37] thou persecut us? It's hard for you to
[1:01:39] kick against the pricks." And he
[1:01:41] recognized who it was. AND HE GETS DOWN
[1:01:43] there and God REALLY GETS A HOLD OF HIM.
[1:01:45] But yet he was not accepted by the
[1:01:47] church. Look at Acts chapter 9 and verse
[1:01:48] 10. There was a certain disciple at
[1:01:50] Damascus named Ananas. And to him said
[1:01:53] the Lord in a vision, Ananas. And he
[1:01:54] said, "Behold, I am here, Lord." And the
[1:01:57] Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into
[1:01:59] the street, which is CALLED STRAIGHT,
[1:02:01] AND INQUIRE IN THE HOUSE of Judas, for
[1:02:03] one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold,
[1:02:06] he prayth." Now, Ananas was a prophet.
[1:02:11] And brother Brandham said, the Lord
[1:02:12] spoke to him and said, "There's a man
[1:02:13] coming down the road over yonder. He's
[1:02:15] just as blind as a bat,
[1:02:18] and his name is Saul.
[1:02:20] Saul of Tarsus." He said, "Lord, I've
[1:02:21] heard great things. Don't send me. I'm a
[1:02:24] little man. Don't send me after him. He
[1:02:27] goes on talking to the Lord and then he
[1:02:28] said, Lord, but this man's a terrible
[1:02:30] man. He said, but behold, he prayth.
[1:02:34] Now, YOU'LL GO DOWN THROUGH A CERTAIN
[1:02:35] STREET AND YOU'LL COME TO A FOUNTAIN.
[1:02:36] YOU PASS THAT FOUNTAIN ON THE LEFT AND
[1:02:38] YOU GO DOWN, THERE WILL BE A WHITE
[1:02:39] HOUSE. GO UP AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR. HE
[1:02:41] JUST LAYING THERE IN THE HALL. THAT'S AS
[1:02:42] far as they ever got him. HE SAID, "LAY
[1:02:44] YOUR HANDS ON HIM. TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE
[1:02:46] river of Damascus and baptize him in the
[1:02:48] name of Jesus cuz I tell you what I'm
[1:02:50] going to do. He's going to have to
[1:02:51] suffer many things for me for he's my
[1:02:54] messenger to the Gentiles. WHAT WAS IT?
[1:02:56] GOD HAD ACCEPTED HIM. BUT HE HAD TO
[1:02:58] REVEAL THAT TO ANANAS.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And Ananas went his way and entered into
[1:03:02] the house and put HIS HANDS ON HIM AND
[1:03:04] SAID, "BROTHER SAUL,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; but I want Come on, CHURCH. THAT'S A
[1:03:08] MORE DIFFICULT THING TO DO THAN WE
[1:03:10] REALIZE."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT, brother Saul.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't out. He wasn't looking for
[1:03:16] Christians to persecute anymore.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? LIFE HAD CHANGED.
[1:03:21] GOD GOT A HOLD OF HIM. THE PILLAR OF
[1:03:22] FIRE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HIS LIFE. AND
[1:03:24] WHEN IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, you can
[1:03:26] tell.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And here this here here it made such a
[1:03:30] difference. It changed him so much. And
[1:03:32] he walked UP TO HIM AND PUT HIS HAND ON
[1:03:33] AND SAID, "BROTHER SAUL, GOD WAS WORKING
[1:03:35] ON BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE. THE LORD EVEN
[1:03:37] Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way
[1:03:39] AS THOU CAMEST HATH SENT ME THAT THOU
[1:03:41] MIGHTEST RECEIVE THY SIGHT AND BE FILLED
[1:03:43] WITH THE HOLY GHOST."
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Now Ananas got it right. He was brother
[1:03:48] Saul
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; tuned to be brother Paul.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; But the rest of the church was still
[1:03:52] suspicious.
[1:03:54] He said, "Brother brother, but you you
[1:03:56] they could do one or two things about
[1:03:58] that, right? You either trust that you
[1:04:00] are accepted in the beloved or you can
[1:04:02] get hurt,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; right? I don't know why God put this on
[1:04:06] my heart tonight, but you just you just
[1:04:08] suffer with me for a moment."
[1:04:10] And and I'm, you know, even even to
[1:04:13] myself, you know, you sometimes you feel
[1:04:15] like you don't fit in and
[1:04:17] [clears throat] you feel awkward in
[1:04:18] social situations and you feel awkward
[1:04:21] at church and awkward among God's people
[1:04:23] and preachers feel awkward around
[1:04:25] preachers and some of them pull away and
[1:04:28] they quit fellowshipping and they just
[1:04:29] kind of sit by themselves and
[1:04:32] everybody's wrong.
[1:04:34] But what if we just trusted him
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; that we're accepted in him and just did
[1:04:39] our best in front of the people
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; to try to love him. Now when Saul was
[1:04:44] come to Jerusalem, he is saved to join
[1:04:46] himself to the disciples. But they were
[1:04:49] all afraid of him.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ben? Were they under some
[1:04:55] kind of spirit? Did they not have any
[1:04:57] love? No, they were human
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; and he'd killed some of their children.
[1:05:04] stoned help helped while they stoned
[1:05:06] STEPHEN AND AND DRAGGED SOME OF THEM
[1:05:08] INTO into jail and everything else.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe not that he was a
[1:05:14] disciple. But Barnabas took him and
[1:05:16] brought him to the apostles and declared
[1:05:18] unto them how he'd seen the Lord in the
[1:05:20] way that he'd spoken to him how he'd
[1:05:21] preached boldly Damascus in the name of
[1:05:23] Jesus. So he told him, "His life's been
[1:05:25] changed. We we've seen it changed. We've
[1:05:27] seen God. There's evidence of grace in
[1:05:29] his life. GRACE THAT SAVED HIM, THAT
[1:05:32] unmmerited favor that made him accepted
[1:05:34] in the beloved.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:38] Paul himself said it this way. 1
[1:05:40] CORINTHIANS 15:9, "FOR I AM THE LEAST OF
[1:05:42] the apostles, and I'm not meat to BE
[1:05:44] CALLED AN APOSTLE BECAUSE I PERSECUTED
[1:05:46] THE CHURCH OF GOD." OH, THAT'S THE
[1:05:48] ATTITUDE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE. LISTEN,
[1:05:50] I'M NOT WORTHY TO BE in the bride OF
[1:05:52] JESUS CHRIST, BUT HE CALLED ME. MY MY MY
[1:05:55] RECOGNITION OF MY UNWORTHINESS DOES NOT
[1:05:58] GIVE ME A A COMPLEX OF INFERIORITY. BUT
[1:06:01] I RECOGNIZE IF HE CALLED ME, HE MUST
[1:06:03] HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME TO DO.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; GOOD.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "But by the grace of God, I am
[1:06:12] what I am. And his grace which was
[1:06:14] bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I
[1:06:17] labored more abundantly than they all."
[1:06:20] He said, "It wasn't even me that did it.
[1:06:24] Yet not I, but the grace of God
[1:06:27] which was with me.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; When somebody really gets saved from a
[1:06:31] background like that, what happens to
[1:06:34] them? They they want to do everything
[1:06:36] they can to please God,
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; right? And turn that thing around and
[1:06:40] try to do everything they can for God.
[1:06:42] And God uses that many times. He used
[1:06:44] that with Paul. We know he used that
[1:06:46] with Stephen. PAUL LATER IN HIS LIFE
[1:06:48] SAID, "THERE'S A CROWN waiting for me."
[1:06:51] A crown. If you look at that WORD CROWN,
[1:06:53] IT'S STEFANOS A CROWN. Brother Brandon
[1:06:56] said he was thinking about Stephen when
[1:06:58] he talked about how HE WAS READY TO GO.
[1:07:00] It's better for me to leave and go on.
[1:07:02] Cuz he was thinking about Stephen
[1:07:03] already being there and he'd finally get
[1:07:05] to meet him and SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND
[1:07:07] TALK TO HIM. OH GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE
[1:07:09] THEM SITTING TOGETHER ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:07:10] WHEN IT WHEN HERE SAUL HAD CONSENTED TO
[1:07:13] HIS DEATH, BUT OVER THERE?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, OVER THERE THEY GOT TO SIT
[1:07:18] DOWN TOGETHER in the kingdom of God.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; So, I guess the only thing we can do is
[1:07:27] just trust God
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; and love one another and forgive
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; one another. Paul dealt with rejection
[1:07:35] not at the just at the beginning but at
[1:07:37] the end of his ministry reached a time
[1:07:39] when it looked like he was just washed
[1:07:41] up.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; In 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 5, he
[1:07:46] tells Timothy, "Watch on all things.
[1:07:47] Endure afflictions. Do the work of an
[1:07:48] evangelist. make full proof of your
[1:07:50] ministry. For I am now ready to be
[1:07:52] offered in the throne or the time of my
[1:07:54] departure is at hand. I have fought a
[1:07:56] good fight. I have finished my course.
[1:07:59] I've kept the faith henceforth. It was
[1:08:01] laid up for me a crown
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; of righteousness which the Lord the
[1:08:05] righteous judge will give me at that
[1:08:06] day. Not to me only, but unto all them
[1:08:08] also that love his appearing. Right.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But if you read this,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; you know, brother Brandham tells us in I
[1:08:18] believe it's in my new ministry or
[1:08:20] present state of my present stage of my
[1:08:22] ministry. I believe is the sermon that
[1:08:23] it's in. But brother Brandham talks
[1:08:25] about this and he it's almost like he's
[1:08:28] typing Paul to himself. Some of the
[1:08:30] things he's going through, how he was
[1:08:32] rejected and it almost seems like Paul
[1:08:34] is one minute he's triumphant and next
[1:08:36] minute he's really pitiful.
[1:08:39] Because then in verse 9 he said do thy
[1:08:41] diligence to come shortly unto me for
[1:08:44] Deus hath forsaken me having loved this
[1:08:46] present world departed unto Thessalonica
[1:08:50] Christians to Galatia Titus unto Dalatia
[1:08:54] listen they may have had good reason to
[1:08:56] go some of them Deus we know left for
[1:08:58] the world brother Brandon said he left
[1:09:01] for the church the worldly church he
[1:09:03] still said he was a Christian but he
[1:09:05] didn't just didn't follow Paul anymore
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; we've seen some like that too.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; But but and and and he just didn't
[1:09:12] follow the message, right? And and so
[1:09:16] but he he claimed to be a Christian.
[1:09:18] Deus has forsaken me, but he said Titus
[1:09:20] left as well and Christians only Luke is
[1:09:22] with me. Luke was Paul's personal
[1:09:25] physician. And brother Brandham said the
[1:09:27] people use that against him because if
[1:09:29] he's a divine healer, why does he have a
[1:09:30] personal physician with him?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Human beings misunderstand one another.
[1:09:38] Right? Are you with me now?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Take Mark and bring him with thee. Now,
[1:09:43] here's some misunderstanding. If you go
[1:09:44] back to Barnabas, we've talked about it
[1:09:46] before. Barnabas and and Paul split up.
[1:09:48] Had a bitter split up and and and
[1:09:51] bitterly disagreed over whether Mark was
[1:09:54] fit for the ministry.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Right? And and all this time later, Paul
[1:09:59] writes back and says, "By the way, I
[1:10:01] need Mark.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He's profitable to me for the ministry."
[1:10:06] SOMEONE WHO PAUL had rejected.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Because you know, AND I'M SURE MARK, he
[1:10:14] could have had a complex about that. But
[1:10:15] you know what he did? He went and found
[1:10:17] Paul.
[1:10:19] Went went to Paul's side. 2 Timothy
[1:10:22] 4:13, the cloak that I left at Trrowass
[1:10:24] with carpass when thou comest bring with
[1:10:25] thee. So he only had one coat and the
[1:10:28] books, but especially the parchments. He
[1:10:30] had some things to write to the
[1:10:32] Corinthians. You know, he was just going
[1:10:33] to
[1:10:36] Alexander the coppermith did me much
[1:10:38] evil. The Lord reward him according to
[1:10:40] his works. Of whom be thou ware also for
[1:10:42] heath greatly withstood our words.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is pitiful. And my first
[1:10:47] answer, no man stood with me, but all
[1:10:50] men forsook me.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; That's pitiful.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Paul standing there and said, "Everybody
[1:10:55] left."
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Jesus experienced
[1:10:59] that.
[1:11:01] He didn't get a complex about it. He
[1:11:03] just told Peter, "When you're saved,
[1:11:05] when you're converted, strengthen your
[1:11:07] brothers."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; No man stood with me. Oh man. Oh my.
[1:11:14] Look, but all men forsook me. I pray God
[1:11:16] it may not be laid to their charge.
[1:11:18] That's a different Paul than what was
[1:11:20] breathing, threatening, and slaughter,
[1:11:21] isn't it?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Look at him in verse 17.
[1:11:24] Notwithstanding,
[1:11:26] I just want to get this thought before
[1:11:28] we close tonight. I won't hold you long.
[1:11:30] NOT WITHSTANDING, THE LORD stood with
[1:11:33] me.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE REALIZING? I MAY EVERYBODY
[1:11:37] MIGHT HAVE LEFT. I MIGHT BE LAYING SICK
[1:11:39] IN A in a in A DUNGEON AND NOT ABLE TO
[1:11:42] DO WHAT I WANT TO DO, BUT YET THE LORD
[1:11:44] STOOD WITH ME. HALLELUJAH. THE LORD
[1:11:46] STOOD WITH ME AND STRENGTHENED ME. OH,
[1:11:48] SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO GET DOWN
[1:11:50] BETWEEN YOU AND GOD AND SAY, "LORD, I
[1:11:52] KNOW YOU CAN STRENGTHEN ME. I KNOW
[1:11:54] YOU'RE HERE WITH ME. I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
[1:11:55] LEAVE ME. YOU'LL never forsake me."
[1:11:57] Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord stood WITH ME AND STRENGTHENED
[1:11:59] ME THAT BY ME THE PREACHING MIGHT BE
[1:12:01] FULLY KNOWN AND THAT ALL THE GENTILES
[1:12:03] MIGHT HEAR. I was delivered out of the
[1:12:06] mouth of the lion. Look at verse 18.
[1:12:08] Look how quickly THE VIEW CHANGES FROM
[1:12:10] TELLING US WHAT HE HE WAS OPEN AND
[1:12:12] HONEST WITH US. TOLD US WHAT HE WAS
[1:12:13] GOING THROUGH. BUT YET THE VIEW CHANGES.
[1:12:15] HE SAID, "AND THE LORD SHALL DELIVER
[1:12:17] ME." I WONDER HOW MANY OF US THAT ARE
[1:12:19] GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS WOULD SAY THE
[1:12:21] SAME THING TONIGHT. THE LORD [screaming]
[1:12:22] SHALL DELIVER ME. DON'T THERE'S NO
[1:12:25] REASON TO GET DESPONDENT. THERE'S NO
[1:12:27] REASON TO BE IN DEFEAT, BUT YOU YOU KNOW
[1:12:29] IF HE IS WITH YOU AND YOU'VE BEEN
[1:12:31] ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED LIKE PAUL WAS
[1:12:33] ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED, I KNOW HE'S
[1:12:35] WITH ME. OH, COME ON, CHURCH. I KNOW
[1:12:37] IT'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT WE OUGHT TO
[1:12:39] REJOICE IN THAT FACT. THE LORD IS
[1:12:41] STANDING WITH ME. AND THE LORD SHALL
[1:12:43] DELIVER ME FROM EVERY EVIL WORK. YOU
[1:12:45] OUGHT TO PUT THAT ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR.
[1:12:47] NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL DOES TO YOU, NO
[1:12:49] MATTER WHAT THE DOCTOR HAS TO DO, NO
[1:12:50] MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, THE LORD
[1:12:53] SHALL DELIVER ME FROM EVERY EVIL WORK.
[1:12:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:02] [laughter]
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY, NO MATTER
[1:13:04] WHAT THE BOSS SAYS AT THE JOB, NO MATTER
[1:13:06] WHAT THE KIDS DO AT SCHOOL, NO MATTER
[1:13:08] WHAT ANYBODY ELSE DOES OR SAYS, THE Lord
[1:13:11] will deliver me
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and will preserve me unto his heavenly
[1:13:18] kingdom.
[1:13:20] Hallelujah. to whom be glory forever and
[1:13:25] ever.
[1:13:28] But the friend said, "Paul's lost his
[1:13:30] ministry." That's what Deeus must have
[1:13:31] thought. Why didn't if he had a gift of
[1:13:34] healing, why didn't he go up there and
[1:13:35] heal that buddy that has stood by him so
[1:13:37] faithful? He said, "I've left him up
[1:13:39] there sick.
[1:13:41] I ain't got no coat.
[1:13:43] I want you to bring me that coat along.
[1:13:45] Be careful. That copper smith just
[1:13:47] ruined the meeting in the city. Had to
[1:13:49] leave the town. He put me in jail.
[1:13:51] Imagine
[1:13:53] demon said, "What kind of a preacher has
[1:13:54] this turned out to be?" He said,
[1:13:56] "Brother, they got a lot of them demon
[1:13:58] spirits in the world today. They don't
[1:14:00] know what it's all about."
[1:14:02] No need trying to explain it to them
[1:14:04] because they won't get it anyhow.
[1:14:06] But a servant of Christ follows
[1:14:10] the footprints.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon brings up a dream
[1:14:13] that Tony Zable had. He was a deacon
[1:14:16] there at the tabernacle.
[1:14:18] and he saw a dream that he was he saw a
[1:14:21] man standing I believe clothed in black
[1:14:23] and he went to him singing songs. He
[1:14:26] went to him and he realized he was his
[1:14:27] first pastor.
[1:14:29] And then he pointed him a little bit
[1:14:31] further down the road and he comes to
[1:14:32] the next man and he said he was singing
[1:14:34] songs and he said that was his second
[1:14:36] pastor. He said and then I saw another
[1:14:38] man dressed in what brother Brandham
[1:14:40] calls overalls. And sometimes in the
[1:14:42] message, Brother Random calls overalls
[1:14:44] jeans and jeans overalls. But in that
[1:14:47] place, he called him overalls. And he he
[1:14:49] looked up there and he said there was a
[1:14:50] man didn't look like a preacher, right?
[1:14:53] But he said he got a little closer. He
[1:14:54] realized it was me standing up there. He
[1:14:57] said he climbed up till he got to me and
[1:14:59] said, "I got him by the arm and led him
[1:15:00] on up till I got top of the hill. There
[1:15:03] was a wilderness to go through." And I
[1:15:05] said, "Tony, I must leave you here."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember Jesus said, "I will
[1:15:12] never leave you."
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon was a man,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; right? And there's a point in our life,
[1:15:19] and I want you young people to
[1:15:20] understand this. And that's what brother
[1:15:22] Brandon is teaching us in leadership at
[1:15:23] the end of his life. He's telling us
[1:15:25] that brother Herald, a man can lead you
[1:15:27] so far. A PASTOR CAN LEAD YOU SO FAR.
[1:15:30] BUT SOME OF YOU ELDER PEOPLE, YOU know
[1:15:32] this is true. YOU CAN BE LED SO FAR, BUT
[1:15:34] BUT BUT THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A FRAILTY in
[1:15:37] a human being. There will be places they
[1:15:39] can't go with you.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE MOMENTS and seasons where
[1:15:43] they just can't. We wish they'd live
[1:15:45] forever. Wish our parents would live
[1:15:46] forever, but they can't.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; WE WISH OUR OUR LOVED ONES WOULD OH, AND
[1:15:50] HOPEFULLY everyone here will live to the
[1:15:51] see the coming OF THE LORD. BUT IF TIME
[1:15:53] GOES ON, WE REALIZE THAT NONE OF US LIVE
[1:15:55] FOREVER on this earth.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Right? This mort mortal must put on
[1:15:59] immortality. We've got to be changed to
[1:16:01] live forever.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; AND SO THERE COMES A POINT WHERE BROTHER
[1:16:05] RAND SAID, "I'M going to have to leave
[1:16:06] you here. I brought YOU THIS FAR, BUT
[1:16:08] I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE YOU. I'M
[1:16:09] GOING GO, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A
[1:16:10] WILDERNESS ALONE.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU MUST WALK SOME OF THIS BY
[1:16:14] YOURSELF.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOUR PASTOR CAN'T BE THERE
[1:16:20] WHEN BROTHER JOEL CAN'T BE THERE,
[1:16:21] BROTHER STEWART AND ONE OF THE
[1:16:22] PREACHERS, LISTEN, HE SAID, "I'LL STILL
[1:16:24] BE THERE."
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HE SAID, "I'LL
[1:16:27] BE WITH YOU AND EVEN IN YOU to the end
[1:16:29] of the age."
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "You must walk some of this by
[1:16:32] yourself." And he said, "Brother
[1:16:33] Brandon, what can I do from here on?" I
[1:16:35] said, "Come here, Tony. Look down there.
[1:16:38] Oh, church. YOU SEE THEM BAREFOOTED
[1:16:39] TRACKS WITH BLOOD IN THEM. I said,
[1:16:41] "That's what I've followed all the way.
[1:16:43] JUST STAY ON THAT." THAT'S THE ONLY
[1:16:46] THING I KNOW TO POINT MAN TO. NOT TO A
[1:16:48] CREED or a sensation of some sort, but
[1:16:50] to those bloody footprints that leads TO
[1:16:51] THE BIBLE, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. OH
[1:16:53] GOD, LET ME POINT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE
[1:16:55] ARM OF FLESH AND TO THE BLOODY
[1:16:57] FOOTPRINTS THAT EACH ONE OF US CAN
[1:16:59] follow
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; and make it home because we are accepted
[1:17:05] not in the preacher or in the church
[1:17:08] but in him.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; See Paul said, "Be ye followers of me
[1:17:14] even as I also am
[1:17:17] of Christ." Those bloody footprints.
[1:17:18] Brother Brandham got a complex he
[1:17:21] thought no one listened to him. There's
[1:17:23] a pretty common thing for a preacher
[1:17:29] and you know and then he went to Or
[1:17:32] Robert's headquarters in Tulsa. He's
[1:17:34] already going through it and gets up
[1:17:36] there and sees that big building and
[1:17:40] I he said I was standing there. I got
[1:17:43] real melancholy.
[1:17:45] I got thinking, God, each one of the
[1:17:47] brothers said they've seen the ministry
[1:17:48] you gave me. It started them on the
[1:17:50] field. I said to that, I'm grateful
[1:17:52] we're all working for one big place up
[1:17:54] there called heaven. I said, I'm
[1:17:56] thankful for that. But I said, I suppose
[1:17:59] maybe you could couldn't trust me.
[1:18:02] This wasn't the Lord, by the way. This
[1:18:03] was brother Brandham
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; because God did trust him.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; He held him in his hand.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That ministry was held in the right hand
[1:18:13] of Christ.
[1:18:15] But he but this is the man talking.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I suppose maybe you couldn't trust me.
[1:18:21] You knew I wouldn't be able
[1:18:23] take up money like that and I wouldn't
[1:18:25] have the intelligence to know what to do
[1:18:26] with it if I took it up. And I said, I
[1:18:29] guess it just happens to be that way.
[1:18:33] I was standing there kind of felt a
[1:18:34] little choked in my throat. He said, I
[1:18:37] just say this the truth. He said, I
[1:18:38] heard a voice just as plain as you hear
[1:18:40] me. Said, but I am your portion. Yes.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, Lord. I'll go
[1:18:48] anywhere, any place, at any time. I want
[1:18:53] to do what you would have me to do." And
[1:18:56] thanking God. You realize Brother
[1:18:58] Brandham couldn't have done what he did
[1:19:00] if he'd had Oral Roberts building. I
[1:19:02] think I got the pictures of that. That
[1:19:04] was the building as it stood there in
[1:19:06] the 60s. I don't know how well you can
[1:19:07] see it. It's off of an old postcard, but
[1:19:10] it's a beautiful or a great big huge
[1:19:12] building. At the time, it was covered in
[1:19:15] concrete diamonds. They [snorts] made to
[1:19:17] look like diamonds. They just went over
[1:19:19] the top and making it making it huge and
[1:19:23] large and impressive. One of the most
[1:19:25] impressive buildings in Tulsa. And but
[1:19:28] right, I'm standing in that marble
[1:19:29] foyer. And I wish I'd have brought the
[1:19:32] pictures of the interior of this place.
[1:19:34] Now, go to the next slide. I think
[1:19:35] there's a picture. This was this year
[1:19:38] they were actually taking off the marble
[1:19:41] exterior because it's falling apart.
[1:19:44] And you CAN GO ONLINE AND FIND PICTURES
[1:19:46] of of the inside that it's completely
[1:19:49] rusted and molded and and and decayed
[1:19:52] and nobody does anything in it. AND
[1:19:55] BROTHER BRANDHAM STOOD IN THAT BUILDING
[1:19:56] AND SAYS, 'WELL, I MAYBE GOD DON'T TRUST
[1:19:58] ME. BUT GOD BUILT A MINISTRY WITH
[1:20:00] WILLIAM BRANDHAM that would last
[1:20:02] SOMETHING THAT IN HARDY, ARKANSAS, WE'RE
[1:20:04] QUOTING TONIGHT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO FOR
[1:20:07] THE BUILDING. BUT GOD DID TRUSTED HIM
[1:20:09] WITH SOMETHING GREATER THAN A BUILDING.
[1:20:10] GOD DIDN'T TRUST HIM WITH MONEY OR A
[1:20:12] BUILDING, BUT HE TRUSTED HIM WITH HIS
[1:20:13] BRIDE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; TO BE THAT ELEER THAT WOULD CALL OUT
[1:20:18] REBECCA.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; TRUSTED SERVANT.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT'S COMING. WE
[1:20:24] MAY LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S LIFE ON INSTAGRAM
[1:20:26] OR FACEBOOK OR SOMETHING ELSE AND SAY,
[1:20:27] "WELL, MY LIFE ISN'T MUCH. I DON'T HAVE
[1:20:29] VERY MUCH GOING FOR ME." WE MAY LOOK AT
[1:20:31] ANOTHER CHURCH OR SOMETHING ELSE AND
[1:20:33] SAY, "WELL, WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH
[1:20:34] COMPARED TO THEM." DON'T LOOK AT WHERE
[1:20:36] YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT WHETHER OR
[1:20:38] NOT YOU ARE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. AND
[1:20:40] IF YOU ARE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED, YOU
[1:20:42] ARE YOU ARE ONE OF HIS. HE'LL BE WITH
[1:20:44] YOU ALL THE WAY.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I love this.
[1:20:51] Hebrews 13:5 as we close the musicians
[1:20:54] come.
[1:20:58] Paul says, "Let your conversation, let
[1:21:01] your lifestyle
[1:21:03] be without
[1:21:05] covetousness."
[1:21:09] It's like he's speaking right to brother
[1:21:11] Brandham in that situation
[1:21:13] and speaking to us tonight.
[1:21:16] Let let your lifestyle
[1:21:19] be your manner of life be without
[1:21:22] covetousness.
[1:21:24] Don't don't want what other people have,
[1:21:28] right? Because God gave other people
[1:21:29] what they have for a reason.
[1:21:32] Be content with such things as you have.
[1:21:35] That's so hard, isn't it? Especially in
[1:21:37] this age when you could get a credit
[1:21:39] card, you know, and buy it.
[1:21:49] Brother Caleb, I I don't want to
[1:21:50] embarrass you, but
[1:21:53] I watched Brother Caleb's family
[1:21:57] when [snorts] they came here a few years
[1:21:58] ago and when I first came and [music]
[1:22:02] Caleb was living in the fellowship hall
[1:22:04] at the time and he upgraded or maybe
[1:22:06] downgraded and
[1:22:09] moved out to a little trailer
[1:22:13] I know one thing I I wouldn't have dared
[1:22:17] to do that. And yet
[1:22:21] yet I you know if we had to that we'd do
[1:22:23] it but that didn't seem like much. And
[1:22:26] finally built a little house nice little
[1:22:29] house. They've got a nice little place
[1:22:30] there and
[1:22:32] not very big.
[1:22:35] But Caleb, you don't know how rich a man
[1:22:38] you are
[1:22:40] because [snorts] your family stayed,
[1:22:43] huh, in that little trailer. Didn't
[1:22:47] complain that much that I remember as I
[1:22:50] remember it. [music]
[1:22:53] They stayed there and hauled water, you
[1:22:56] know, did the things that
[1:23:00] But what the treasure was that you got
[1:23:03] people who are with you during that
[1:23:05] time.
[1:23:07] So Paul says, don't don't let your
[1:23:11] conversation let your lifestyle be
[1:23:12] without covetousness. So you don't want
[1:23:13] what somebody else has cuz what you have
[1:23:16] is enough,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:19] And it's it it's of such extreme value
[1:23:22] because how many people
[1:23:25] I look at this church and
[1:23:28] I know all of us have been through
[1:23:29] things in one way or another. Whether
[1:23:31] you're here recently, come recently or
[1:23:33] in the past, but you've been through
[1:23:34] some things. All of us have. All of us
[1:23:36] have a history. We've got a background.
[1:23:38] And you MAY LOOK AT SOMEBODY ELSE AND
[1:23:40] COMPARE YOUR LIFE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND
[1:23:41] SAY, "WELL, BUT THE VALUE OF IT IS THAT
[1:23:43] ALL THIS TIME HE NEVER FORSOOK YOU."
[1:23:46] LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. IF YOU'RE YOU CONTENT
[1:23:48] WITH WHAT YOU HAVE, HE HAS SAID, "I WILL
[1:23:50] NEVER LEAVE thee nor forsake thee."
[1:23:57] And I'm marveled at the fact that Caleb
[1:23:59] and Sophie could live there and then do
[1:24:00] what they've done with the church and
[1:24:02] move on from that and do what they did.
[1:24:04] And I thank God and them kids are so
[1:24:06] blessed to have parents like that. And
[1:24:08] I'm not just bragging on them. Every one
[1:24:10] of you know in your own lives, YOU PUT
[1:24:11] UP WITH THINGS AND and deprivation
[1:24:14] because you want to be in the house of
[1:24:15] God. YOU WANT, OH GOD, [laughter] AND
[1:24:16] AND AND YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS,
[1:24:18] BUT YET THAT YOU SAW GREATER VALUE. SEE,
[1:24:20] MOSES LOOKED BEYOND THE TREASURES OF
[1:24:22] EGYPT, AND HE SAID, "I COULD HAVE A GOOD
[1:24:24] JOB. I COULD BE THE KING AND PRINCE OF
[1:24:26] OF EGYPT AND BASICALLY THE king of the
[1:24:29] earth at that time." BUT HE SAID, HE SAW
[1:24:31] CHRIST. HE LOOKED AT THE unseen
[1:24:34] and saw THE WORD WAS MORE IMPORTANT. AND
[1:24:36] THERE'S SOME THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
[1:24:38] MONEY. THERE'S SOME THINGS MORE
[1:24:39] IMPORTANT THAN A GOOD JOB. THERE'S SOME
[1:24:41] THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE THINGS.
[1:24:44] I believe in having a JOB. I BELIEVE IN
[1:24:45] MAKING MONEY, but some things are more
[1:24:47] important.
[1:24:49] And remember, when you get to the lowest
[1:24:51] point of that, he said, I will never
[1:24:53] leave you or forsake you. And what value
[1:24:56] is there? If there's value in a wife and
[1:24:58] a family that won't,
[1:25:01] are you with me now? That'll put up with
[1:25:03] those things in order to achieve a
[1:25:05] better life. HOW MUCH TIME DID HE HOW
[1:25:08] MANY TIMES DID HE PUT UP WITH YOU WHEN
[1:25:09] YOU WERE IN SIN AND YOU WERE LOST AND
[1:25:12] YOUR HOUSE DIDN'T LOOK VERY GOOD AND
[1:25:14] THINGS didn't look like they were very
[1:25:17] you there wasn't much going for you
[1:25:20] but he said I won't leave you [snorts]
[1:25:22] verse six so that we may boldly say
[1:25:28] [gasps]
[1:25:28] oh we there ought to be hands up all
[1:25:30] over the building right NOW THE LORD IS
[1:25:32] MY HELPER AND WE CAN SAY AMEN TO THAT TO
[1:25:34] THE LORD IS MY HELPER I DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:25:37] WE MADE IT, EVEN WHERE WE MADE IT. BUT
[1:25:38] THE LORD IS MY HELPER.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:46] Some of y'all, I won't call your name,
[1:25:48] but some of y'all got married and I
[1:25:49] thought, well, I don't know if that I
[1:25:52] don't know if y'all can make it, but the
[1:25:54] Lord is my helper.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Some of us have been THROUGH SOME
[1:25:58] THINGS. WE DIDN'T THINK WE'D MAKE IT,
[1:25:59] BUT THE LORD IS MY HELPER. HE WALKED
[1:26:02] WITH ME IN A MOMENT WHEN THE PASTOR
[1:26:03] COULDN'T AND NOBODY ELSE COULD, BUT HE
[1:26:05] WAS RIGHT THERE WITH ME. OH, WE OUGHT TO
[1:26:07] REJOICE IN THAT TONIGHT. WE MIGHT BOLDLY
[1:26:10] SAY TONIGHT AND REJOICE IN THIS FACT,
[1:26:12] THE LORD IS MY HELPER. I WILL NOT FEAR
[1:26:15] WHAT MAN SHALL DO UNTO ME. I I WILL NOT
[1:26:18] HAVE A COMPLEX ABOUT NOT BEING ACCEPTED
[1:26:20] BY PEOPLE BECAUSE the Lord is my helper.
[1:26:22] I'VE BEEN ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. WE
[1:26:25] have redemption through his blood.
[1:26:28] Hallelujah. Let's follow those bloody
[1:26:31] footprints
[1:26:33] leading us home. Would you bow your head
[1:26:35] with me tonight? And
[1:26:43] oh God,
[1:26:49] excuse me for getting personal tonight,
[1:26:51] but I just I love each and every one of
[1:26:54] you tonight. Every one of you.
[1:26:57] I've seen some of the things you come
[1:26:58] through and I know that he's here
[1:27:01] [music] with you and able to help you so
[1:27:04] that you can boldly say, "The Lord is my
[1:27:07] helper and I will not fear what man
[1:27:12] shall do unto me."
[1:27:15] Oh, he's here tonight. If you [music]
[1:27:18] if you want to just throw your hand up
[1:27:21] to him and say, "Lord, I know you're my
[1:27:22] helper.
[1:27:24] I want to worship you in that. I want to
[1:27:26] thank you for that.
[1:27:29] I've come a mighty long way. You brought
[1:27:32] me through many things
[1:27:35] and the people that you gave me have
[1:27:37] stuck with me.
[1:27:39] I'm so thankful.
[1:27:44] I'm so grateful, Lord, that you brought
[1:27:46] me such a mighty long way [snorts]
[1:27:49] to stand here in your presence and say,
[1:27:51] "I know I will never be forsaken [music]
[1:27:55] by you." Heavenly Father, we love you
[1:27:57] tonight and we thank you, oh God. I
[1:27:59] thank you tonight for your mercy and
[1:28:02] your grace and your [music] goodness. I
[1:28:04] pray that you'd walk with us, Lord. Help
[1:28:07] us to follow those bloody footprints.
[1:28:10] We've been through some things, but
[1:28:12] you're the one who brought us through.
[1:28:15] We've seen the hard side of life, but
[1:28:17] you're the one who made it made it real
[1:28:20] and kept us during that time. I pray
[1:28:23] that you'd help us tonight. Keep us. We
[1:28:26] thank you for it, Lord. I pray that
[1:28:27] you'd move in a mighty way, Lord, that
[1:28:30] your presence would be with these
[1:28:32] people, that you'd help them, Lord, as
[1:28:34] they think back on their lives, Lord,
[1:28:36] and think of what you brought them
[1:28:37] through. Maybe there's someone here
[1:28:38] that's never received the baptism of the
[1:28:40] Holy Ghost. May they realize tonight and
[1:28:42] come to that revelation and that
[1:28:44] baptism, oh God, that they would know
[1:28:46] that they are accepted in the beloved
[1:28:48] and that's enough. Lord, we thank you
[1:28:51] for that in Jesus name. Amen. Oh, when
[1:28:55] he reached,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad he reached way down
[1:29:01] for me?
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad to reach
[1:29:09] way down.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; What have he done for you tonight,
[1:29:12] church? You might as well worship him
[1:29:13] for a minute. What has he done for each
[1:29:15] and every one of us? Oh, I was lost
[1:29:20] and undone
[1:29:23] without God [singing]
[1:29:26] for his son
[1:29:29] when he reach
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; down
[1:29:35] for me. I was nearing despair. Let's
[1:29:38] sing that now.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was nearing [singing]
[1:29:44] despair. Do you remember what that was
[1:29:46] like when he came
[1:29:50] [singing] to be there
[1:29:52] and he showed me Hallelujah that I
[1:29:57] Hallelujah could be free.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Oh then he [singing] lifted
[1:30:07] my feet.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave me glory. [singing]
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand and give him praise
[1:30:15] tonight? Give me prayer. The altar's
[1:30:17] open. Now his hand
[1:30:21] for me. [singing]
[1:30:24] Sing it now with all your heart. Oh,
[1:30:26] when he reach [music]
[1:30:29] out his [singing] hand
[1:30:33] for [music] me,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; he brought me up my
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, he had to [singing] reach
[1:30:41] way down
[1:30:44] for me. [singing and music]
[1:30:49] Oh, I was lost
[1:30:52] and undone without God without God or
[1:30:57] [singing] his son or his son.
[1:31:01] When he reached [singing]
[1:31:04] down his hand
[1:31:07] for me.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Since the Lord gave me peace.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, since the [singing] Lord
[1:31:16] gave me peace.
[1:31:18] Heavenly joy
[1:31:22] never cease.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I give [singing]
[1:31:27] all my life
[1:31:30] unto thee. [music]
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Oh guide my feet,
[1:31:39] hold my [music and singing] hand,
[1:31:41] oh grant with thee,
[1:31:45] I stand. [singing and music]
[1:31:47] Oh, you reach
[1:31:50] down his hand for me.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Sing that chorus down with all your
[1:31:57] heart. Oh, I'm glad he reached

[1:32:05] for me. [music and singing] He had to
[1:32:07] reach way down. Oh,

[1:32:13] way [singing] down.

[1:32:23] [music]
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, without God
[1:32:30] or his son [music]
[1:32:33] when he reached
[1:32:36] down his hand
[1:32:39] for me. How my heart doth rejoice.
[1:32:42] [music]
[1:32:42] [singing]
[1:32:43] Oh, and how my heart
[1:32:47] doth rejoice
[1:32:50] since I made
[1:32:53] him my choice.
[1:32:56] Oh, from [singing] the tempest
[1:32:59] to him,
[1:33:01] now I flee.

[1:33:10] on his arm. [singing]
[1:33:13] Well, I'm secure
[1:33:16] from all harm

[1:33:44] way down [singing]
[1:33:47] for me.
[1:33:50] Yes, [music] he did. Oh, I [singing] was
[1:33:53] lost
[1:33:55] and undone
[1:33:58] without God
[1:34:01] for his son.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; and he [singing] reached

[1:34:14] Amen. My God is real.
[1:34:17] Amen. Aren't you glad he's real? Amen. I

[1:35:35] Some [music] folks may doubt.
[1:35:39] Some folks may scorn.
[1:35:43] Well, they can all go on
[1:35:46] and leave [music and singing] me alone.
[1:35:52] But as for me, how about you here
[1:35:54] tonight? Oh, I'll take [singing] God's
[1:35:58] part.
[1:36:00] And my God is real, for I can feel him

[1:40:12] Well, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:40:16] of them.
[1:40:18] Well, there are people [music]
[1:40:20] almost everywhere whose hearts are all a
[1:40:23] flame. With the fire that fell at
[1:40:26] Pentecost, [music] which cleansed and
[1:40:28] made [singing] them clean. Well, it is
[1:40:30] burning now within my heart. [music] All
[1:40:33] glory to his name. Well, I'm so glad
[1:40:36] that I can't say I'm one of them.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm one of them. [music]
[1:40:43] I'm one of them.

[1:40:50] of them, [singing]
[1:40:52] but
