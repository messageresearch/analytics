[26:20] at whatever need that you have to lift
[26:23] that before the Lord I know he's willing
[26:26] and able to meet that need this morning
[26:28] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you
[26:31] for the ability that we have to still
[26:34] come together and join in one Accord
[26:37] even though we're not in one place this
[26:39] morning and so we ask you to come Lord

[26:57] disease or something Lord that would be
[27:00] among us I pray that you would cast it
[27:03] out Lord you said that your army cast
[27:05] out diseases and we believe that today
[27:07] father you are the same yesterday today
[27:10] and forever and so we ask you to do that
[27:13] Lord cast out fear and unbelief Lord
[27:16] everything that would be according to
[27:18] your word will give you the praise and
[27:20] the glory and the honor for it
[27:22] bless us each now each one in their home
[27:24] where they're at this morning and those
[27:26] that are here helping us I pray that you
[27:28] just speak to us today move me out of
[27:30] the way Lord and may you speak to your
[27:33] people we pray Jesus name Amen amen god
[27:38] bless you you can be seated this morning
[27:41] for a few minutes
[27:47] I wanted to make sure that we were very
[27:51] clear as to the current situation with
[27:55] coronavirus and what lies ahead for us
[27:58] and and make a little announcement Peter
[28:00] if you could turn these monitors down
[28:02] the platform speaker is just a little
[28:05] bit so I want to be very clear about
[28:08] this this morning we've had several
[28:14] families in the church as you know that
[28:16] are quarantined at this time and God
[28:18] bless you this morning if you're
[28:19] watching and maybe you've been stuck at
[28:21] home for a few days and it's an
[28:24] abundance of caution thing as far as we
[28:26] know there's no one in the church that
[28:28] has symptoms of coronavirus or has
[28:31] tested positive for coronavirus but it's
[28:33] just due to potential exposure and it's
[28:37] not just us or several other churches
[28:38] and the message dealing with the same
[28:40] thing this weekend and so we want to
[28:43] make sure that we do the right thing and
[28:45] we'll never be sorry for being careful
[28:48] and so we want to make sure that we are
[28:49] as careful as possible but I wanted to
[28:52] be very clear this morning that we don't
[28:54] have anybody that's tested positive for
[28:57] coronavirus and we've not had any as far
[29:00] as we know no one in the church like
[29:02] that and no one with symptoms but it's
[29:04] just a matter of being very careful
[29:06] because of exposure to someone who did
[29:09] test positive
[29:11] I want those families that are
[29:14] quarantined will be quarantined
[29:16] some of them that ends on Monday the
[29:17] 29th if they go the full 14 days for us
[29:21] as a church it would end this Saturday
[29:23] on the 27th would be the last possible
[29:26] day that there could be any symptoms
[29:28] show up and so we want to make sure that
[29:30] we go through that date so this
[29:32] Wednesday night I had previously invited
[29:36] brother Andrew Glover to come speak for
[29:37] us on Wednesday the 24th and he's agreed
[29:42] to go ahead and come so he's gonna come
[29:44] and preach on the internet so those of
[29:47] you that are watching this morning make
[29:49] sure that you're tuned in on Wednesday
[29:51] night and of course those that can be
[29:54] here will be here and but for most of
[29:56] you you'll be watching and so he's
[29:59] agreed to go ahead and do that service
[30:00] so
[30:01] as of today brother Andrew Glover will
[30:03] be here on Wednesday night and he's
[30:05] coming through the area anyway so I
[30:07] asked him to do that for me and with us
[30:09] moving and and I've been preaching
[30:11] back-to-back services lately and so this
[30:13] would be a big help to me to be able for
[30:15] him to be able to do that and I
[30:17] appreciate him very much for going ahead
[30:19] with that now as I said this will end on
[30:23] Saturday so Saturday night the Lord
[30:27] willing we're gonna have Church and I
[30:30] know some of you have family in a
[30:31] different things and and we'll just work
[30:33] it out whereas many of us can be here as
[30:36] possible Saturday night at 6 o'clock but
[30:39] Aaron McGarry is supposed to be here
[30:41] again
[30:42] that's obviously dependent on him
[30:44] showing up but as far as I know brother
[30:46] Aaron will be here Saturday night and
[30:48] we'll let you know if something changes
[30:50] but that's Saturday night at 6 o'clock
[30:52] we will have Church and everyone is
[30:55] invited to come because as a church will
[30:58] be there maybe some individuals that
[31:00] won't be able to be here but as a church
[31:01] we should be able to be here on Saturday
[31:04] night and so let's do that and then if
[31:07] we have anyone that wants to come from
[31:09] the community or whatever that would be
[31:10] fine as well and then Sunday morning our
[31:14] regular service at 10 o'clock with for
[31:16] the Aaron McGarry and I am looking
[31:17] forward to that it's been a while since
[31:19] I've been able to fellowship with
[31:21] brother Aaron and we're very good
[31:23] friends and and he's been a real friend
[31:25] to me and and and a great preacher of
[31:28] the gospel this message so we want to
[31:30] have him in if we can so this Wednesday
[31:33] brother Andrew Glover will be here but
[31:36] it'll be streaming only Saturday night
[31:39] but the Aaron McGarry will be here but
[31:41] we will be able to have Church as far as
[31:43] we know if nothing changes and then a
[31:45] Sunday morning as well
[31:48] services as I said this weekend will be
[31:50] open to the public and but we will
[31:52] continue to abide by the rules of social
[31:54] distancing as much as possible and that
[31:56] just continues we don't know when
[31:58] that'll end we try not to shake hands we
[32:01] try not COFF on each other and sneeze
[32:03] and and do things like that we've not
[32:05] been passing an offering plate the
[32:07] offering baskets are in the back if you
[32:09] want to wear a mask you're welcome to
[32:11] wear a mask you don't have to too
[32:12] it's not been made a requirement but
[32:15] you're welcome to do that try to
[32:17] maintain when you're seated a little
[32:19] distance between you if it's possible
[32:20] and someone else and the longer we
[32:23] continue to do that if we do those
[32:25] things and we don't have to shut down
[32:27] the church as often and so we want to we
[32:30] want to be able to gather together as
[32:31] much as we possibly can so thank you for
[32:34] your patience I want to say to this
[32:36] church those of you that are watching
[32:37] those of you that are here
[32:39] you're a wonderful group to preach to
[32:41] and so I want to have you sitting in
[32:43] front of me when I preach I mean that's
[32:45] that's my heart but we want to take all
[32:47] the precautions that we can and Peter
[32:51] I'm ringing just a little bit just bring
[32:52] the slider down a little bit I've got
[32:54] Peter back there on the sound he's
[32:55] learning how to do that so so but your
[32:59] wonderful group to preach to and and
[33:01] I'll say this and make sure I want to
[33:05] make sure I'm very clear on this as well
[33:06] I won't promise that we will deal with
[33:09] this the same way every time but we're
[33:12] learning as we go through this and thank
[33:14] you for being understanding god bless
[33:16] you for that every situation is
[33:19] different
[33:20] so if someone gets exposed and if
[33:21] someone in the church would test
[33:23] positive that might change everything
[33:24] and so we can't we don't always know how
[33:27] we'll deal with this and at some point
[33:29] the world's got to learn how to live
[33:30] with it and and we pray there will be a
[33:32] vaccine and that something will come and
[33:35] that we believe God can just get rid of
[33:37] it is brother David said and we believe
[33:39] God can do that we believe you will do
[33:40] that but until then we'll take all the
[33:43] precautions that are necessary and to
[33:45] keep our testimony in the community you
[33:47] love the Lord this morning it's so much
[33:50] easier to say when there's people here
[33:53] you can see if they get it or not but I
[33:55] think those of you that are here
[33:57] understand and and those of you watching
[33:59] if you don't get it go back and listen
[34:02] to it again and I'll try to post as well
[34:04] for those of you on social media so that
[34:06] you'll have that where you can reference
[34:08] it let's stand together and turn to
[34:11] Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 if you
[34:14] haven't learned by now I'm terrible at
[34:15] making announcements so I'm trying to
[34:17] get better at that Matthew chapter 5 and
[34:20] verse 38 let's go to the Lord again in
[34:24] prayer just for a moment
[34:25] before we go to the word Heavenly Father
[34:27] were so grateful to be able to come to
[34:31] your word again this morning and we
[34:34] asked you to just touch every heart
[34:36] father wherever they're at this morning
[34:38] I pray that Lord they'll be diligent to
[34:41] listen and Lord I believe there's
[34:43] something that you want to speak to us
[34:45] today father and I pray your spirit
[34:47] would just come in today and and as the
[34:50] word is going forth that it would just
[34:52] settle down and begin to brood over the
[34:54] hearts of the people or to bring out of
[34:57] that seed that's on the inside what what
[35:00] you put in there Lord and that it would
[35:02] be expressed in the right way and I pray
[35:04] that it would be so Lord move me out of
[35:05] the way as we've said and and just speak
[35:08] to your people now we pray as we
[35:09] approach your word in Jesus name Amen
[35:12] amen
[35:14] Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 you have
[35:19] heard that it hath been said an eye for
[35:21] an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say
[35:24] unto you that you resist not evil but
[35:27] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[35:28] cheek turn to him the other also verse
[35:33] 40 and if any man will sue thee at the
[35:35] law and take away that coat let him have
[35:36] thy cloak also verse 41 and whosoever
[35:40] shall compel thee to go to a mile go
[35:42] with him Twain verse 42 give to him that
[35:46] asketh thee and from him that would
[35:48] borrow of thee turn not thou away you've
[35:52] heard that it it has been said thou
[35:54] shalt love that neighbor and hate thine
[35:55] enemy but I saying do you love your
[35:57] enemies bless them that curse you do
[36:00] good to them that hate you pray for them
[36:02] which despitefully use you and persecute
[36:04] you and I want to want you to notice
[36:07] verse 45 that she may be the children of
[36:10] your father which is in heaven and he's
[36:15] not saying that this makes us the
[36:17] children of our Father but he's saying
[36:20] this is how the world will know that
[36:21] were the children of our Father that you
[36:24] may be the children of your father is
[36:25] literally that that you can be like the
[36:28] chil like your father people will know
[36:31] by looking at you that you're like your
[36:33] father and and I think that's
[36:35] appropriate on Father's Day said for he
[36:37] maketh his son to
[36:38] on the evil and on the good sendeth rain
[36:41] on the just and on the unjust for if you
[36:44] love them which love you what reward
[36:45] have you you do not even the publicans
[36:47] the same if you salute your brethren
[36:50] only what do you more than others do not
[36:52] even the publicans so be therefore
[36:55] perfect even as your father which in is
[36:58] in heaven it's perfect he says be
[37:02] perfect like your if we say it this way
[37:04] like your daddy is perfect right and
[37:07] this being Father's Day and happy
[37:09] Father's Day to those of you that are
[37:11] watching those of you that are here that
[37:12] are their dads but you can remember as a
[37:15] child if you had a dad that was around
[37:18] that you maybe thought well look at him
[37:20] I can't wait til I get that big I can't
[37:22] wait till I get that level of maturity
[37:24] in my life where I can drive and I can
[37:27] have a bank account I can do all of
[37:28] those things so he says look at God and
[37:31] be perfect like he's perfect
[37:34] be like your daddy and then I want to
[37:37] read one scripture in John 14 18 Jesus
[37:41] speaking to his disciples before he was
[37:43] to leave the earth just this one verse
[37:45] it says I will not leave you comfortless
[37:48] and that word is actually the greek word
[37:51] or Fanus which I won't leave you orphans
[37:54] or I won't leave you without a father I
[37:57] will come to you amen I pray the Lord
[38:00] without his blessing - the word you may
[38:02] be seated this morning
[38:10] have you ever heard someone tell you you
[38:13] remind me so much of your dad some of us
[38:16] hope not but we probably still get it
[38:20] from time to time you remind me so much
[38:23] of your dad and I've gotten that before
[38:27] I did my dad's funeral
[38:29] brother Ivy had come up to that place he
[38:31] told my mom at the funeral he said he
[38:35] said as long as your son's alive your
[38:37] your husband will always live because I
[38:40] look like my dad and you know there's a
[38:44] reason for that because we are our
[38:47] father's children and that's what I
[38:49] titled this this morning my father's
[38:50] children my father's children would be
[38:52] my brothers and sisters right so my
[38:55] father's children when we speak
[38:57] spiritually as all of you but we look
[38:59] like our fathers and we actually
[39:02] according to biology look like our
[39:04] fathers on average not that there could
[39:07] be someone sitting here or listening
[39:09] this morning that looks just like your
[39:11] mom and that's possible but there's a
[39:13] greater possibility that you look just
[39:15] like your dad and this is something that
[39:17] they've recently discovered because
[39:19] nature without human interference as it
[39:22] begins to play out we get 50/50 of our
[39:25] genes from our father and mother but the
[39:28] way those genes are expressed is not
[39:31] 50/50 that we actually are 60% more
[39:35] likely to have traits that are active
[39:38] because you get so many genes you may
[39:40] get a gene that has it's prone to a
[39:43] certain kind of sickness a gene that is
[39:45] prone to a certain type of anxiety a
[39:47] gene that is prone to being nervous or
[39:50] whatever that it is but your brother or
[39:52] your sister may have the same genes but
[39:56] it's not expressed in their life one may
[39:59] have a gene that makes them go bald and
[40:00] you have a brother that has hair or a
[40:02] sister that never had a problem with
[40:04] that you think why would they why would
[40:06] it not be expressed in their life well
[40:07] because the expression is different than
[40:10] just the gene or the DNA that's there
[40:12] but the expression is influenced by
[40:15] other things and so but we are more
[40:17] likely the genes that our father gives
[40:20] us are more likely to express in our
[40:22] lives
[40:23] and if we think about that spiritually
[40:25] I'm so glad that's the case that that
[40:27] the genes that come from our Heavenly
[40:29] Father that given if if we'll let God do
[40:32] what God does in our life that he
[40:34] expresses those so we can say that our
[40:37] father's genes in that way are more
[40:38] dominant they're more able to be
[40:41] expressed and that many people think
[40:43] well it's hard to live a Christian life
[40:44] brother Branham preached on that why
[40:46] it's so hard for some to live a
[40:47] Christian life well it's because they've
[40:49] never really been born again they've
[40:52] never really gotten inside the Holy of
[40:53] Holies if you do you realize your
[40:56] father's genes are more naturally
[40:58] expressed in your life if you're born
[41:00] again then even your natural genes your
[41:04] natural genes are still there but
[41:05] there's something about a Christian that
[41:07] just wants to be like his father or
[41:10] wants to be like her father now
[41:12] so you're 60% more likely to have traits
[41:15] that are active from your dad so you're
[41:17] active DNA you're active genes because
[41:20] nature is a natural preference to
[41:22] express the genes of your father and
[41:26] they call this and we'll go come back to
[41:28] it after a while so I'm not going to
[41:29] talk about DNA and genes all day but
[41:32] it's due to what's called complex
[41:34] epigenetics and epi is that Greek word
[41:36] that just means over and above so you
[41:39] have your genetics and you then you have
[41:41] factors beyond your genetics that
[41:43] influence who you are just to put it in
[41:46] simple terms so your genetics plays a
[41:49] role in the way you look and your eye
[41:50] color and all of those things that it
[41:53] impacts your health and wellness you
[41:55] think about this way if you inherit a
[41:58] severe health condition if you inherit
[42:01] it from your mom you're it's likely to
[42:03] be less severe and science has proven
[42:06] this if you inherit it from your dad
[42:07] it's likely to be more severe and again
[42:12] think of that spiritually just for a
[42:14] moment that he's our Heavenly Father and
[42:16] what we inherit from him the genes that
[42:19] we get is likely to express themselves
[42:22] more so it depends on which side of the
[42:26] family you inherit from you're more
[42:28] likely to inherit stronger genes from
[42:31] your father's side and so I would
[42:34] express to you this morning that you're
[42:37] more
[42:37] able to live the gospel than you think
[42:39] you are because you're the jeans seat of
[42:42] God and if you belong to God then you're
[42:44] likely to express that in your life no
[42:49] as we look at this then that nature
[42:51] comes from God it comes from God it is
[42:54] God and that's our spiritual gene but
[42:56] the RAM says there's only one form of
[42:58] eternal life and that comes from God he
[43:00] said in he for deigned every creature
[43:02] that would ever have it just as you were
[43:05] the gene in your father you as a gene in
[43:08] God one of his attributes to begin with
[43:10] or you'll never be there and so he says
[43:13] you come forth in the bedding ground of
[43:15] your mother your father didn't know you
[43:16] you were in his loins and when you come
[43:19] forth in the bedding ground of the
[43:20] mother then you become a human being and
[43:22] are made in the image of your father he
[43:25] says and now you can fellowship with him
[43:27] and the same thing by God if you've got
[43:30] eternal life and so that's your nature
[43:32] that's who you are
[43:33] but the RAM said the life that you come
[43:36] in the natural life physical life was by
[43:38] your father and this is where it gets
[43:40] tricky because you might say well but
[43:42] then if I express match more clearly the
[43:46] genes of my father what happened when I
[43:48] was in the world well the fact is you
[43:51] didn't express any of the genes of your
[43:53] father before you got saved of your
[43:56] spiritual father no but it doesn't mean
[43:59] that he wasn't there he was there
[44:02] because he said I won't leave you
[44:04] comfortless I won't leave you orphans I
[44:07] won't leave you without he said I will
[44:08] come to you but but he was there even
[44:12] his influence Holy Spirit could
[44:14] influence your life even at a young age
[44:16] but the expression of that gene could
[44:18] only come by the new birth because by
[44:20] your natural birth you have the
[44:22] expression of your natural father's
[44:24] genes so now he says the life that come
[44:28] you came in the natural life physical
[44:31] life was by your father
[44:32] and the only way you can come born again
[44:34] he said has to be from your heavenly
[44:36] Father his attributes all the father has
[44:39] given me will come to me he said you're
[44:42] here because your name was placed on the
[44:44] Lamb's Book of Life before there was
[44:46] even a foundation of the world
[44:48] that's exactly right you're a gene
[44:50] spiritual gene out of your heavenly
[44:53] father a part of God's Word oh I'm so
[44:57] grateful for that day what does that
[44:58] mean it means that I couldn't it
[45:01] wouldn't it wouldn't be possible for me
[45:03] to fail because God's Word can't fail
[45:05] right but we're talking about that gene
[45:07] seed we're talking about that other me
[45:09] we're not talking about the flesh so we
[45:14] realized that man has a body made from
[45:16] the dust but we have a spirit in the
[45:19] image of God and we have a soul which is
[45:23] the nature of that spirit and allows a
[45:24] man to choose and Genesis 1:27 God
[45:28] created man in his own image and the
[45:30] image of God created him male and female
[45:31] created he them and we know that he
[45:33] created him a spirit man in minute
[45:36] Genesis 2:7 the Lord God formed man out
[45:38] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[45:40] into his nostrils the breath of life so
[45:43] there you have the the spirit the body
[45:46] and the soul he said and the man became
[45:49] a living soul so it's a spirit man he
[45:52] was a spirit man than he was a flesh man
[45:54] now he's a living soul and we find that
[45:58] in the beginning Adam spirit would have
[46:00] been innocent right it wouldn't have
[46:03] been marred he wasn't his nature was not
[46:06] marred by sin but it was his own nature
[46:10] right but it was not marred by sin it
[46:14] was not corrupted but having a soul give
[46:17] him the ability to make a choice to
[46:18] follow his wife out of the Garden of
[46:20] Eden and because he could do that now
[46:22] that nature become marred and that's the
[46:26] nature that we inherit was from Adam
[46:29] when God made him a living soul when we
[46:31] become a living soul when we come into
[46:33] the earth we get that soul that ability
[46:36] to choose between right and wrong and as
[46:39] we reach a certain level of maturity
[46:40] we're able to choose between right and
[46:43] wrong and we're constantly choosing the
[46:44] wrong because we inherited that nature
[46:47] that's what shows up we're more likely
[46:50] to express the genes of our father our
[46:51] natural father Adam right and so you
[46:55] don't find people just live in perfect
[46:57] lives and doing or living in godly lives
[46:59] or whatever you find people doing
[47:00] everything they can do wrong why because
[47:03] that's your nature when you were born in
[47:06] the world you come in the world that way
[47:08] brother Brown says know the soul of man
[47:10] is not the body of man it's the soul and
[47:12] this is in souls that are in prison now
[47:15] but the brown goes into a pretty in
[47:17] depth it helps us understand a teaching
[47:20] here on the soul he said the soul is
[47:22] something that's the nature of the
[47:24] spirit he said and then when the nature
[47:26] of man that he said we're dead the
[47:28] scripture plainly tells us we were dead
[47:30] our lives are hidden God through Christ
[47:32] sealed there by the Holy Spirit he said
[47:35] no it wasn't your body that died it
[47:38] wasn't your spirit that died it was the
[47:40] nature of your spirit that died he said
[47:43] see the nature which is the soul he said
[47:46] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[47:48] born again and that's why brother
[47:51] Branham tells us in thirst that day and
[47:52] that message thirst is much more deep
[47:55] message than people realize there's much
[47:57] more in that because Branham says that
[47:59] what's you by what you desire you can
[48:01] tell it's on the throne of your heart
[48:03] because that desire comes from the
[48:05] nature of your soul and if you're born
[48:08] again the nature of your soul is God if
[48:10] it's not it's of the world he said
[48:12] anything that begin has to end so
[48:14] therefore the only way that you can have
[48:15] eternal life is to have a life that
[48:17] never did begin he said and then your
[48:20] life did begin when you were born when
[48:22] God breathed the breath of life into
[48:24] your nostrils you become a living soul
[48:25] he said you begin then but the nature
[48:29] that was in you by nature us of the
[48:31] world alienated from God you were
[48:34] actually but the remm says an animal he
[48:37] said anyone knows we're mammal and
[48:39] that's why the scientists today can say
[48:41] well we're just a mammal we're just
[48:42] cousin or whatever to the Apes or
[48:44] whatever that is was true we're just a
[48:46] mammal in our nature in our natural body
[48:48] we come in the world alienated from God
[48:51] we're mammal were warm-blooded animal he
[48:53] said but that is what we are by our
[48:55] earthly creation but you see what made
[48:57] us different from other mammals is that
[48:59] God put a soul upon us he breathed the
[49:02] breath of life but a soul on us he said
[49:05] now the other animals don't have to wear
[49:07] clothes no other animal has to wear
[49:09] clothes to hide his shame but us when
[49:12] the only ones it does because we have a
[49:13] soul and so you can see what
[49:16] happen in this hour that people take off
[49:18] clothes and go out naked in the public
[49:21] why animals do that all the time right
[49:24] but people haven't done that until this
[49:26] age why they're just going right back
[49:28] into that they're so deceived by the god
[49:31] of this evil age that they're going
[49:32] right back in where there's no shame
[49:34] again but the realm called it a lust
[49:36] veil that they have over them but but as
[49:39] human beings we have we know when we're
[49:41] naked right and it's proof that we have
[49:44] a salt mine and see he said then see
[49:48] after you've done made man in his own
[49:50] image he created a male and female there
[49:52] was no man to till the soil he put him
[49:54] in the dust of the earth and therefore
[49:55] he said he was that man he said this
[49:57] human man was mammal he was animal but
[50:00] he put this Spirit of God a life into
[50:02] him and he made him on the basis that he
[50:05] could make a choice he said but that
[50:08] soul that's in there see that soul is
[50:10] what God is working on if he can only
[50:12] get that nature that spirit to agree
[50:15] with him he said then that nature dies
[50:17] the nature and the love of the world
[50:19] dies and the things of the world is dead
[50:22] he said because if you love the world of
[50:24] the things of the world the love of God
[50:25] is not in you see a man must be born
[50:28] again
[50:28] so this nature has to die and the nature
[50:31] of God comes and lives in you and God is
[50:34] the only thing there is it never did
[50:36] begin or never can end no we're going to
[50:41] get into this a little bit more but you
[50:42] might think well if that's so then when
[50:44] I'm born again then I'm I do everything
[50:46] right from then on well we obviously
[50:49] know that isn't true just by experience
[50:51] we know that isn't true but the Word of
[50:53] God teaches us that it's not true you do
[50:55] sometimes the things that you hate right
[50:59] and yet at the same time we believe we
[51:01] have the right and the ability and the
[51:03] responsibility to live a Christian life
[51:05] but yet we live we sin and we do things
[51:08] that are wrong and so we have to have a
[51:11] new birth though and Nicodemus comes to
[51:14] Jesus and in John chapter 3 and again
[51:16] Jesus begins to tell him about the new
[51:18] birth and Nicodemus can't understand it
[51:20] and in verse 3 jesus answered and said
[51:22] unto Him verily verily I say unto thee
[51:24] except a man be born again he cannot see
[51:27] the kingdom of God and that we know that
[51:29] sister
[51:30] stand you can I'll understand the
[51:32] kingdom of God unless he's born again
[51:34] and that's why Nicodemus was struggling
[51:36] with it and in verse six he said that
[51:38] which is born of the flesh is flesh and
[51:40] that which is born of the Spirit is
[51:42] spirit and see Nicodemus couldn't
[51:45] understand that he couldn't separate the
[51:46] two
[51:47] my brother branham excuse me for reading
[51:51] this morning but I'm trying to get
[51:52] through this in a way that I don't bore
[51:53] you and also in a way that will get done
[51:55] quickly and that's because I know it's
[51:56] different sitting at home and trying to
[51:58] watch but but the man said you notice
[52:01] you take a woman if she is ever so foul
[52:04] when she becomes a mother a little while
[52:06] before that baby is born there's a
[52:08] kindness about that woman he said you
[52:11] get around her there's always something
[52:13] more she's more tender he said why
[52:15] there's a little angel spirit waiting to
[52:19] receive that natural body now we know
[52:20] that spirit is not an angel perhaps that
[52:23] it is and brother Branham talks about a
[52:24] guardian angel and different things but
[52:25] I think we're speaking here there's a
[52:27] spirit that is not touched by hasn't
[52:30] made any decisions to do wrong and it
[52:33] can't right it can't and so you get to a
[52:37] certain agent you get big like some my
[52:38] kids you get old enough to know when you
[52:40] do wrong right but when you're little
[52:43] you don't know that so it's a little
[52:45] angel spirit it's just a little little
[52:47] spirit has got a spirit but it doesn't
[52:49] have that really ability to make a
[52:51] choice yet so he says there's a little
[52:54] angel spirit waiting to receive that
[52:55] natural body just soon as it's born the
[52:57] breath of life comes into it and God
[52:58] breathes it in there it becomes a living
[53:01] soul he said now just as this baby is
[53:03] being born then the spiritual body is
[53:05] there to receive it
[53:06] he said now in this body and he takes it
[53:09] and types that to our spiritual birth he
[53:14] said when this body has dropped here in
[53:16] this earth like the baby has dropped
[53:18] also there is an immortal body waiting
[53:22] to receive the spirit back into itself
[53:24] again and that's why Paul said we
[53:26] already have one waiting so brother
[53:29] Branham says this he said we are now in
[53:31] Christ Jesus babies now look we you
[53:37] watch this you grow you you have a baby
[53:39] that's born and it's so cute and I was
[53:42] even the cute baby
[53:43] you can believe that and lots of babies
[53:45] are cute and so you your little in your
[53:49] cute and you can kind of say if I hear
[53:51] all the time while he looks like this
[53:52] one or he looks like that one and I
[53:54] can't ever tell but they're cute
[53:56] regardless so babies are cute or that's
[53:58] what they say anyway and and so babies
[54:02] you know they have certain features and
[54:04] things that are just neat to look at in
[54:06] small features and but as they grow
[54:09] older they may grow up ugly they're
[54:11] likely to grow up in the image of their
[54:13] father but they may grow up in the image
[54:15] of their mother something they grow up
[54:17] they may be they may be horrible looking
[54:20] right we see that evidenced and in many
[54:24] people so but what's happened is they
[54:26] had to mature into what the genes that
[54:29] was in them would become but those genes
[54:33] are not deterministic by themselves but
[54:37] and I want us to understand this this
[54:39] morning and I guess if I'm making any
[54:40] point this morning it's this that it's
[54:42] not our predestination just doesn't
[54:45] cover the gene from God the seed from
[54:47] God that comes in it that's in us at
[54:49] birth that's predestinated that's that's
[54:52] before time that was in his mind but it
[54:54] also is the nurture of that seed even
[54:59] before were saved and after we're saved
[55:02] if we could say it this way he's a good
[55:04] dad he's a good father he knows what
[55:08] he's doing and I'm grateful for that
[55:12] because I needed help I believe I'm a
[55:16] seed of God I believe you're a seed of
[55:18] God but we needed help we needed to be
[55:21] able to express something beyond our
[55:23] natural abilities we need to be able to
[55:26] express something beyond the culture
[55:28] that we live in we need to be able to
[55:30] express something beyond just what we
[55:32] would be naturally and so God doesn't
[55:35] just dump us in the earth and put a gene
[55:37] seed in us but he also nurtures that
[55:39] seed and he also controls and even plans
[55:42] our life in such a way so that we're at
[55:45] the right place at the right time under
[55:47] the right atmosphere hearing the right
[55:49] word so that we can that seed can become
[55:51] what he wants it to be because it is not
[55:55] just our nature and there's
[55:57] always been the argument in genetics is
[55:59] it nature or nurture but they found it's
[56:02] not really an argument at all because it
[56:04] takes both because of epigenetics
[56:07] because you're not just your genes but
[56:09] also the things that are influenced
[56:12] those genes can be influenced to express
[56:13] themselves at different times and again
[56:16] we know that's true because we did
[56:18] things that God would never do right we
[56:21] did things that God would never do
[56:23] because we're human we were in the image
[56:25] of Adam but yet that seat gene laid
[56:28] there and wasn't expressed but it had to
[56:31] come to a place of expression no some
[56:35] other man said we are now in Christ
[56:37] Jesus babies babes in Christ children of
[56:41] God waiting for the full deliverance
[56:43] that the coming of our Lord Jesus to
[56:45] receive us up and to himself when this
[56:48] body this mortal will take on
[56:50] immortality what do you do with the baby
[56:54] you watch over you constantly are there
[56:57] and Gian God being our father and also
[57:01] our mother if we could say it that way
[57:02] here he's our spiritual parent he comes
[57:05] in and takes care of us he nurtures us
[57:07] he brings us up to the place where we
[57:10] should be now what they found with
[57:13] epigenetics has set these these gene
[57:17] expressions change expressions change
[57:20] based on what we go through now what
[57:25] they've done is they've taken mice and
[57:28] they they make a mice a mouse some ice
[57:31] they make a mouse afraid of something
[57:34] right so what they'll do is they'll take
[57:36] a they'll take a a certain chemical that
[57:39] smells a certain way and they'll
[57:41] introduce that into the cage and every
[57:42] time they introduce that in the cage
[57:43] they shock the mouse and I know some of
[57:46] you are thinking you'll never get past
[57:47] this thing you'll never hear what I'm
[57:48] saying because all you think about is
[57:50] the poor Mouse but but they take the
[57:52] that sweet smell and then they they
[57:55] shocked the mouse and every time he
[57:57] smells that they train him to be afraid
[57:58] of it they train him that that's
[58:01] associated with that just like you train
[58:03] a puppy or anything else so the mouse is
[58:06] trained but what's funny is once he's
[58:09] afraid of it
[58:10] he passes that fear along not by
[58:13] behavior because you can that Mouse if
[58:16] you the father can have children and
[58:19] those children those baby mice grow up
[58:22] already afraid of that smell even though
[58:27] they've never seen or never been shocked
[58:30] and they've never seen him be shocked
[58:33] but he was shocked by it now think back
[58:35] and you think how this works just in
[58:38] your natural life you take someone that
[58:39] maybe had some traumatic event in their
[58:42] life and it shaped them so much that
[58:44] they found it actually impacts their DNA
[58:47] their genes so that they passed that
[58:49] fear along to their children and with us
[58:54] I guess the most common thing with with
[58:56] us purchases we're scared of the water
[58:58] just afraid of the water and I have no
[59:01] reason to be afraid of the water but my
[59:03] dad was afraid of the water and my dad
[59:05] never knew why he was afraid of the
[59:06] water
[59:07] and dad would and dad's going on to be
[59:10] with the Lord now but but he would get
[59:12] out you know he'd get in one foot of
[59:13] water and he just thought he was
[59:14] drowning I mean you could you could you
[59:17] he almost drowned in a bathtub he took a
[59:19] shower because he he was afraid of water
[59:21] and I have a hard time all of us have
[59:24] had a hard time learning to swim some of
[59:26] us can swim but it's been difficult
[59:29] because it just seems like it's passed
[59:31] on and we don't know why at some point
[59:33] it's on some level and it may have been
[59:35] a grandfather because what they found is
[59:37] these genes don't just pass through the
[59:39] children but to the grandchildren of the
[59:41] mice that they actually are continued to
[59:43] be afraid of that smell because and if
[59:47] something they can explain it's just who
[59:49] they are it's their genes because what
[59:52] it did is that mouse had a certain gene
[59:55] now to be afraid and it passed it on now
[1:00:00] the the gene that was the what made them
[1:00:03] afraid was already there but that actual
[1:00:07] problem that actual shock caused that to
[1:00:10] express and then it went on down to the
[1:00:13] kids so it's not just the genes that go
[1:00:16] down but the expressions that's why it
[1:00:18] matters what we do it matters what we do
[1:00:21] it matters how we treat our children
[1:00:23] matters whether we go to church or not
[1:00:25] you know my dad was always faithful to
[1:00:28] go to church and that's one thing and
[1:00:29] there were other things he wasn't so
[1:00:30] faithful in but going to church that was
[1:00:32] always something he did and for me it's
[1:00:34] never been a problem I've always been in
[1:00:36] church and that's that's and it goes on
[1:00:38] through generations I've seen it and
[1:00:40] unfaithful people the same way it works
[1:00:43] the same way you just can't hardly seem
[1:00:45] to make yourself go to church and you
[1:00:46] don't know why but it's just passed on
[1:00:49] but thank God we have the nature of God
[1:00:52] to overcome those things but now there
[1:00:56] is in these mice they found that if you
[1:01:00] take the same mouse that's got this
[1:01:03] depressed gene or anxious gene and then
[1:01:06] I'm mice that are depressed believe it
[1:01:08] or not it's just in their DNA to be
[1:01:10] depressed there are mice that are
[1:01:12] anxious we have a dog that struggles
[1:01:15] with depression and if you've ever had
[1:01:17] the dog it's the real thing
[1:01:18] dog just gets depressed if the kids
[1:01:21] aren't around he just depressed he just
[1:01:23] has a really hard time he won't eat when
[1:01:25] the kids aren't around he's so anxious
[1:01:27] that you could leave him for a week and
[1:01:28] he won't eat nothing because he just
[1:01:31] it'll get as skinny as a rail because
[1:01:32] he's afraid he's anxious when they're
[1:01:35] not around and so he struggles with that
[1:01:37] and there's actually they can get prozac
[1:01:38] to dogs because of that and so human
[1:01:42] beings are that way as well but we tend
[1:01:45] to pass those things on to our children
[1:01:47] but what they found is if you take that
[1:01:49] mouse and just give it the utmost care
[1:01:52] and just really treat it right as a baby
[1:01:55] it'll be less likely to exhibit that
[1:01:58] anxiety then its father was even though
[1:02:02] the genes are still there and I want to
[1:02:06] tell you this morning as God has a way
[1:02:08] of bringing people into our lives and
[1:02:11] things and yes there'll be hardships
[1:02:13] there will be trials but there will be
[1:02:14] times when God brings fathers into our
[1:02:16] lives mother's different ones to nurture
[1:02:18] us along so that those genes that are
[1:02:21] expressed would only be the right ones
[1:02:24] God knows that so brother Branham even
[1:02:28] talks about he would he would bring your
[1:02:29] mother and father together or your
[1:02:31] grandmother and grandfather together and
[1:02:33] then your mother and father God caused
[1:02:34] that to happen just so is it
[1:02:36] did but if he did that then he also
[1:02:38] caused maybe your grandfather to leave a
[1:02:40] certain place at a certain time go into
[1:02:42] a certain area of the country to be
[1:02:44] influenced by a certain type of
[1:02:45] preaching or a certain type of thing
[1:02:47] maybe they were just worldly people but
[1:02:49] they were influenced by certain things
[1:02:50] to make you what you are today and God
[1:02:53] not only controls your natural DNA but
[1:02:55] he controls that as well
[1:02:57] he doesn't just control your nature but
[1:02:59] he controls your nurture now so that's
[1:03:05] important and I think just as a side
[1:03:06] note it's important that we manage those
[1:03:09] things in our lives especially as
[1:03:10] fathers this being Father's Day a
[1:03:13] special day for us melody said it's
[1:03:15] Father's Day she said we can make daddy
[1:03:17] work I said no that's what daddy does
[1:03:20] every other day she thought of since it
[1:03:23] was Father's Day we were going to have
[1:03:24] we were gonna work real hard but you
[1:03:27] know that's that's just you know being
[1:03:30] father today we want to make sure that
[1:03:32] we that we manage these things in our
[1:03:35] lives because we can pass that on the
[1:03:38] strongest gene that there is that the
[1:03:40] father passes on to his children is not
[1:03:42] even hair loss or anything like that
[1:03:43] it's actually depression that's the gene
[1:03:47] that's most likely to express in your
[1:03:50] children is depression so we need to be
[1:03:52] careful with that and really come under
[1:03:54] and overcome those things because if we
[1:03:56] don't we're pulling pass that on to our
[1:03:58] children but think the Lord they have a
[1:04:01] an atonement as well aren't you glad for
[1:04:03] a savior today because you get into
[1:04:06] these things you begin to think well
[1:04:07] I've just planned to be what I am nobody
[1:04:09] but God planned you to be what you are
[1:04:11] and to be born again and to express
[1:04:13] those genes that he gave you now when
[1:04:15] you were born in this world you were
[1:04:16] born in sin shaped in iniquity the
[1:04:19] nature of your spirit was ungodly yet
[1:04:22] you were already being nurtured by God
[1:04:25] amen brother Brown says you know you
[1:04:29] grew from your birth when you was born
[1:04:31] he says and presented into this world
[1:04:33] God knew that you were going to be here
[1:04:37] in this earth and you grew from birth to
[1:04:38] maturity things that seem so strange to
[1:04:41] you and your young womanhood young
[1:04:42] boyhood as children now seems very real
[1:04:45] you couldn't understand it when you was
[1:04:47] a child but now is you become adult you
[1:04:48] begin to
[1:04:49] in and find out that everything was just
[1:04:51] set just right he said in you it really
[1:04:55] means something to you now so it is in
[1:04:57] your spiritual birth I must have not
[1:04:59] given that to them but just listen
[1:05:01] closely he said you do things that you
[1:05:03] don't understand
[1:05:03] he said then you're a little baby come
[1:05:06] to the altar you give your life to
[1:05:07] Christ you do such strange things you
[1:05:11] wonder why you did it
[1:05:12] but after a while you mature then you
[1:05:15] understand it he said see there
[1:05:17] something picks up you see why you had
[1:05:19] to do it your spiritual birth he says
[1:05:23] your natural birth types are spiritual I
[1:05:25] don't know when we're gonna get out
[1:05:27] because I didn't give them all the
[1:05:28] quotes said how it fitted to you in this
[1:05:30] life issue grew everything fitted right
[1:05:32] in because you were made for that he
[1:05:34] said wasn't it a strange thing the night
[1:05:36] she staggered into the mission the tip
[1:05:37] meeting a little church somewhere on the
[1:05:39] corner something the preacher preached
[1:05:40] on a certain subject you just fell right
[1:05:42] at the altar see God knew that before
[1:05:45] the foundation of the world it seems
[1:05:47] strange to you why you did it then but
[1:05:49] now you understand amen and he says you
[1:05:53] knew what happened it's so fitting to
[1:05:54] you in this life and will be also in the
[1:05:56] life that is to come in this world and
[1:05:58] it's life seems to advance as you mature
[1:06:00] everything seems to go right with you
[1:06:03] and that's exactly the way it is with us
[1:06:06] when it comes to God now I want us to
[1:06:08] look at Psalm chapter 139 and I hope I
[1:06:11] gave you that Slom chapter 139 and verse
[1:06:14] 1 I want us to look at this because I
[1:06:18] probably took those out yes I probably
[1:06:22] took those out just to save time go to
[1:06:25] verse 9
[1:06:26] you know David explains to us that God
[1:06:29] is there no matter where we are and he
[1:06:35] says if I take the wings of the morning
[1:06:36] and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
[1:06:39] sea he says even there shall I hand lead
[1:06:42] me my right hand shall hold me if I say
[1:06:46] surely the darkness shall cover me even
[1:06:48] the night should be light about me so
[1:06:50] he's saying God nurtured me through my
[1:06:52] life he was always there he was a good
[1:06:56] father hey man he says in verse 12 you a
[1:07:01] the darkness hide us not from me but the
[1:07:02] night show
[1:07:03] today the darkness and the light are
[1:07:05] both alike to thee now he goes back and
[1:07:08] he says for that was possessed my reins
[1:07:10] and what that means is it would have
[1:07:12] been the Jewish equivalent or the Hebrew
[1:07:15] equivalent of your DNA your inner
[1:07:17] workings of your body you possessed my
[1:07:20] reins that was covered me in my mother's
[1:07:22] womb in other words you you protected me
[1:07:25] even the way that I was made even as the
[1:07:28] genes started to come together you
[1:07:30] protected me in my mother's womb
[1:07:33] so he's using on one side he's saying
[1:07:35] you nurtured me here I was wherever I go
[1:07:39] if I make my bed in hell whatever that
[1:07:40] it is you're with me and the reason is
[1:07:43] because you've always been with me you
[1:07:45] possessed my rage you covered me in my
[1:07:47] mother's womb he said I will praise thee
[1:07:50] I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:07:52] marvelous are that works and that my
[1:07:54] soul knoweth right well my substance was
[1:07:58] not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:07:59] secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:08:02] lowest parts of the earth nine eyes did
[1:08:06] see my substance yet being unperfect in
[1:08:08] other words I wasn't complete but you
[1:08:10] saw it so when you were that first germ
[1:08:13] in your in your mother's womb he said
[1:08:16] you saw me though I was some perfect I
[1:08:19] wasn't completely formed in that book
[1:08:21] all my members were written which in
[1:08:24] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:08:26] there were none of them how precious all
[1:08:29] sort I thought son to me O God how great
[1:08:32] is the sum of them if I should count
[1:08:33] them there are more numbers than the
[1:08:35] sand when I awake I would still with
[1:08:37] thee so he is not only our father in
[1:08:40] that we all get our eternal genes from
[1:08:42] him and and I'm afraid sometimes we
[1:08:44] treat him like an absentee father that
[1:08:46] we think well God was with me and and he
[1:08:49] gave me a seat of God and now it's up to
[1:08:51] me to do all the rest no he's with us
[1:08:54] now he protects us now he comforts us
[1:08:57] now he nurtures us now he's still our
[1:09:00] Father and he's not an absentee father
[1:09:02] he doesn't that's the way of the serpent
[1:09:04] is to father children and then leave
[1:09:06] it's true that's what the serpent did
[1:09:08] but it's not what God does God takes
[1:09:11] care of his children
[1:09:13] hey man and so he is our Father
[1:09:16] he nurtures us everyday to express those
[1:09:19] genes that are right in our life just
[1:09:21] like you do your children because you
[1:09:23] know your children are gonna be like you
[1:09:25] and so you've been through some things
[1:09:27] and so you tell him no don't be like
[1:09:29] that you try to model something
[1:09:32] different maybe even than the way you
[1:09:34] were race but see God don't make no
[1:09:36] mistakes so what does he do he says be
[1:09:38] like me be like me he come down and
[1:09:41] wrapped himself in a robe of flesh with
[1:09:43] a Joel walked among us on the earth and
[1:09:44] he said follow me
[1:09:45] be like me why because he he was our
[1:09:48] Father and he come down among us and
[1:09:50] when he become a son when the father
[1:09:54] wrapped himself in the body of flesh to
[1:09:56] become a son he looked back at the other
[1:09:58] sons and said be like me hey man why
[1:10:02] because he was the father
[1:10:03] perfectly expressed are you with me this
[1:10:07] morning he was the father
[1:10:08] perfectly expressed and I'm you that are
[1:10:10] online you say man if you're with us
[1:10:12] this morning as well I'm being kind of
[1:10:15] hard on these that are here because I
[1:10:16] know you can only say Amen so many times
[1:10:19] and there's just a few of us but you
[1:10:21] know what we have a good father and our
[1:10:25] father we get our eternal genes from him
[1:10:27] but he also nurtures those expressions
[1:10:30] in our life to cause us to become more
[1:10:33] like him in Genesis 1 it talks about how
[1:10:36] the earth was without form and void and
[1:10:38] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:10:40] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[1:10:42] face of the waters you see the seeds
[1:10:43] were already there we could say like his
[1:10:45] children it was already there in the
[1:10:47] earth but the Spirit of God had to move
[1:10:50] on and that word is to brood on it we
[1:10:52] preached on it before how that he broods
[1:10:54] over it like that like an eagle or hen
[1:10:56] would over its chicks he he moves it he
[1:10:58] turns it he causes a movement to come on
[1:11:01] the face of the waters
[1:11:04] now brother Branham and condemnation by
[1:11:07] representation teaches us how that we
[1:11:09] are represented by Adam of sinners
[1:11:11] that's our natural DNA or natural genes
[1:11:16] he said now to you to say that it's
[1:11:18] wrong for you to be represented by Adam
[1:11:19] as a sinner
[1:11:20] what about through representation we
[1:11:22] have salvation also he said you can no
[1:11:26] more save yourself then you could take
[1:11:28] your bootstraps
[1:11:29] jump over the moon with it you're born
[1:11:32] in sin you're a renegade to start with
[1:11:33] every one of us we could not help
[1:11:35] ourselves
[1:11:36] how are we ever going to be saved one
[1:11:38] come to represent us aren't you glad
[1:11:41] that he did this morning
[1:11:42] Jesus he come to represent us before God
[1:11:45] as Sunnis listen he come to represent us
[1:11:48] before God as sons and daughters of God
[1:11:52] amen we were represented in him and what
[1:11:56] was he that perfect expression of the
[1:11:57] genes of God he was the perfect
[1:12:00] expression both by nature and by nurture
[1:12:04] Amen because the Bible said he even
[1:12:07] learned or he he actually learned
[1:12:10] obedience assess by the things that he
[1:12:13] suffer he said how could that be God
[1:12:15] caused nurtured those genes to be
[1:12:17] expressed he said this is my beloved Son
[1:12:20] in whom I'm well pleased oh my he was
[1:12:23] the gene seat of God we're the gene seat
[1:12:25] of God but he came to represent us
[1:12:27] before God as sons and daughters of God
[1:12:29] and he sent His Holy Spirit now that
[1:12:33] he's brooding over the place that's what
[1:12:36] he wants to do to our church that's what
[1:12:38] he wants to do in your home he wants to
[1:12:40] brood over you he wants to he wants to
[1:12:42] cause an atmosphere to come to nurture
[1:12:45] you in the right direction he wants to
[1:12:47] spend time with you oh my and that's
[1:12:51] what so many does we leave time for
[1:12:53] everything else but he wants to spend
[1:12:54] time with us just like we want to spend
[1:12:57] time with our children
[1:12:58] he wants to spend time with us amen and
[1:13:01] he come to brood over us to trying to
[1:13:04] bring us back to birth to die to
[1:13:07] ourselves to be reborn again to be sons
[1:13:10] and daughters of God to take God at His
[1:13:12] Word to believe God's Word listen he can
[1:13:18] brood he can come we know that the Holy
[1:13:20] Spirit comes all over the earth and the
[1:13:21] tear and the wheat and all rejoice in it
[1:13:25] but it only it only expresses the genes
[1:13:28] of God when that gene seed that
[1:13:31] predestinated seed is their brother man
[1:13:35] tells us wherever you are God knew that
[1:13:38] you would be here because you have to be
[1:13:40] one of his genes or his attributes
[1:13:42] hey man you had to be he said if you
[1:13:45] ever if you got eternal life it always
[1:13:46] was eternal life and God before there
[1:13:49] was a foundation the world knew that you
[1:13:50] would be here he said a window water the
[1:13:53] washing of the water of the word fell
[1:13:54] upon you it was expressed in a being he
[1:13:58] said now you have fellowship with your
[1:14:00] father God Justice you have with your
[1:14:03] earthly father said see you are citizens
[1:14:06] of the King you are not citizens that
[1:14:09] you were children sons and daughters of
[1:14:10] the Living God amen
[1:14:12] so not just citizens but we are children
[1:14:15] if it be that the eternal life twelves
[1:14:18] in you what do we do to children we
[1:14:22] teach the children and this I want to
[1:14:24] tell you this because I don't want you
[1:14:26] to be discouraged God's teaching us
[1:14:28] something you look at the coronavirus
[1:14:30] and the things that have happened God's
[1:14:31] teaching us something he said what you
[1:14:33] didn't respond like this other pastor
[1:14:35] did well God's teaching us something
[1:14:37] like teaching us something and sometimes
[1:14:40] we do right sometimes we do wrong but
[1:14:41] God's teaching us something it were sons
[1:14:44] and daughters of the Living God and so
[1:14:47] we have to be taught we have to be
[1:14:49] teachable if we could say it that way
[1:14:50] Galatians 4 and 1 and you can go read
[1:14:53] the rest of this but I'll just read the
[1:14:55] first two verses to save time he says
[1:14:57] now I say that the air as long as he is
[1:14:59] a child differeth nothing from a servant
[1:15:01] and though he be Lord of all but it's
[1:15:04] under tutors and governors until the
[1:15:06] time appointed of the Father and that's
[1:15:09] what we want to come to but we know that
[1:15:10] this flesh doesn't come to that until we
[1:15:12] have a new body that's that's the full
[1:15:15] adoption if you could say it that way
[1:15:16] yet we can come to a place of maturity
[1:15:19] as Christians now we look at this and
[1:15:22] he's under tutors and governors who is
[1:15:24] the tutor and you remember Mary was
[1:15:27] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and Jesus
[1:15:29] and and but the RAM uses that as the
[1:15:31] type that he said that if Mary was
[1:15:34] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost who was
[1:15:35] the father right it had to be the father
[1:15:38] had to be the Holy Ghost because the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost is the father it's one God
[1:15:42] and so if the Holy Ghost is the tutor
[1:15:45] who's the tutor the father the father
[1:15:49] actually comes down in the form of the
[1:15:52] Holy Ghost and becomes
[1:15:54] tutor what better tutor kids you have
[1:15:57] what better teacher could you have than
[1:16:01] your heavenly father in Galatians 4:6
[1:16:04] tells us because your sons go out a sip
[1:16:07] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:16:09] heart because your sons and we've talked
[1:16:11] about that before but that's the
[1:16:13] ultimate identification that you are a
[1:16:15] gene seat of God is to receive the token
[1:16:17] to receive the Holy Ghost because if you
[1:16:19] if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost you
[1:16:21] have to be a gene seat of God you could
[1:16:24] have the Holy Ghost on your flesh every
[1:16:25] day of your life and die and go to hell
[1:16:27] but if you ever get sealed by the Holy
[1:16:29] Ghost
[1:16:29] you are gene seat of God you can't be
[1:16:31] lost anymore than God could be lost so
[1:16:34] we find because your sons god sent forth
[1:16:37] the spirit of his son so Jesus says he
[1:16:39] says I'm gonna send you a comforter and
[1:16:41] then he says I will not leave you or fat
[1:16:43] off I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:16:45] will come to you a man he wraps himself
[1:16:49] in he changes his mask to another
[1:16:51] another we could say another part or
[1:16:54] another office of who he is and he comes
[1:16:56] down and dwells within us to express in
[1:17:00] our lives the gene seed of God he
[1:17:04] doesn't just leave us to our own devices
[1:17:06] he's also our tutor I've never seen a
[1:17:09] day like today when parenting was so
[1:17:11] hands off and excuse me for being an old
[1:17:14] fogey just for a minute but every time
[1:17:17] you go to the grocery store and somebody
[1:17:19] is asking their kid and making a deal
[1:17:21] with them to keep them from grabbing all
[1:17:23] the candy on the shelf that bothers me
[1:17:25] that really bothers me I don't make
[1:17:27] deals with my kids well not all the time
[1:17:30] anyway but you know you don't you don't
[1:17:32] just sit there and and and negotiate
[1:17:35] with the two-year-old right the
[1:17:37] two-year-old has to be taught it needs
[1:17:40] to be taught needs a father
[1:17:42] it needs a mother we thank God for
[1:17:44] mothers but it needs a daddy need
[1:17:46] somebody be able to step in and say no
[1:17:47] right needs the parents to be able to
[1:17:50] step in and do something for them but in
[1:17:52] this age we just let them do what they
[1:17:53] want to when you let them do what they
[1:17:54] want to and they end up on the street
[1:17:56] somewhere in Portland OR Seattle and
[1:17:58] making their own little country and and
[1:18:00] burning stuff that's what comes when you
[1:18:02] leave them to their own devices right
[1:18:05] but they but God give us father's for a
[1:18:07] reason
[1:18:08] hey man God give us father's for a
[1:18:11] reason impulsive sometimes your father
[1:18:12] would even for his own pleasure punish
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:15] in other words cuz he could just got mad
[1:18:16] but God doesn't do that God works in her
[1:18:20] lives and knows exactly what we have
[1:18:22] need of amen
[1:18:23] and he says that in Romans 8:26 now this
[1:18:28] is the spirit Paul is addressing both
[1:18:30] sides of it this is the spirit working
[1:18:32] in our lives that's the predestination
[1:18:34] working in our lives the Holy Ghost
[1:18:35] working in your life is predestination
[1:18:37] working that makes sense it's
[1:18:39] predestination working we look at those
[1:18:41] it's two different things but we are
[1:18:43] predestinated to become the sons of God
[1:18:45] and to predestination working in your
[1:18:48] life as the Holy Spirit working in your
[1:18:50] life Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit
[1:18:52] also helpeth our infirmities or our
[1:18:55] weaknesses for we know not what we
[1:18:57] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:18:59] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:19:02] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:19:06] you ever been to the store with your
[1:19:08] kids and they want certain things but
[1:19:10] you know that's not the best thing for
[1:19:12] them so what do you do you steer them
[1:19:14] towards a different aisle you steer them
[1:19:17] towards a different product because
[1:19:19] you're gentle with them but you want
[1:19:20] them to know that that's not what you
[1:19:22] need what you need is in the fruit aisle
[1:19:23] not in the candy aisle right so you
[1:19:26] steer them in the right direction don't
[1:19:28] you know that's what God has been doing
[1:19:29] brother David all of our lives
[1:19:31] he's been steering us in the right
[1:19:33] direction he'd been leading us through
[1:19:34] the aisles of life and he walks down
[1:19:37] through life with us and every time we
[1:19:39] would go for the candy we would go for
[1:19:41] something we didn't need he'd steer us
[1:19:42] in the right direction
[1:19:43] he just rebuked us just a little bit
[1:19:46] sometimes he'd spank us sometimes we get
[1:19:48] on just real good because he needed us
[1:19:49] he wanted us to go in the direction so
[1:19:52] that we could be the expressed image of
[1:19:54] God the spirit itself makes intercession
[1:19:56] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:19:58] uttered sometimes my kids want to order
[1:20:01] for themselves and I translate for them
[1:20:03] I want the the number one special
[1:20:09] whatever it is with all that innocent
[1:20:10] know what he wants is a grilled cheese
[1:20:12] with french fries why because sometimes
[1:20:16] you know what's the best in it but watch
[1:20:18] as they get older you trust them more
[1:20:20] right you trust them more
[1:20:22] that's what God is doing with us that's
[1:20:25] what he did with job we got to job was a
[1:20:28] man it was perfect before God he did
[1:20:29] everything right it seemed like but God
[1:20:32] said I'm gonna trust him a little more
[1:20:33] let some trials come in let some things
[1:20:35] come in and and let him realize and
[1:20:37] Satan come in his life and did
[1:20:39] everything he could but he still
[1:20:40] wouldn't curse God and die even though
[1:20:42] his wife told him to he still wouldn't
[1:20:44] do it why because he'd become a mature
[1:20:46] Son of God and God allowed that trial to
[1:20:49] mature him that much more the more
[1:20:51] trials you have the more things you go
[1:20:52] through it's just God trusting you but
[1:20:55] the spirit itself makes intercession for
[1:20:57] us so we groan but we don't know what
[1:20:59] we're growing for but he knows verse 27
[1:21:03] he who searches the hearts knoweth what
[1:21:05] is the mind of the Spirit because he
[1:21:07] maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:21:09] according to the will of God and you
[1:21:12] could take this back and I don't wanted
[1:21:14] to take much more time but you could
[1:21:15] take this back to David and you could
[1:21:16] you could look at David's life and you
[1:21:18] could see how that he grown in himself
[1:21:20] and he said my hands and feet they
[1:21:23] pierced my hands and feet he didn't even
[1:21:25] know what he was talking about but what
[1:21:27] was there was a spirit making
[1:21:29] intercession the spirit in his life and
[1:21:31] David and we look at the things that are
[1:21:33] going on our life we think well there's
[1:21:34] no purpose to my anxiety to the to my
[1:21:37] struggles in life to the things I go
[1:21:39] through but there's a purpose in it
[1:21:40] because we don't even know what it's for
[1:21:43] but he's already working for our own
[1:21:45] good and he says that he deserted the
[1:21:48] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[1:21:49] Spirit because he maketh intercession
[1:21:51] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:21:53] God and we know that all things work
[1:21:55] together for good to them that love God
[1:21:58] to them who are the called according to
[1:22:01] his purpose
[1:22:02] verse 29 for whom he did foreknow he
[1:22:04] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:22:07] the image of his son notice how it reads
[1:22:09] he said whom he foreknew he also did
[1:22:11] predestinate I must have took quite a
[1:22:14] bit of this out so we could be faster
[1:22:16] but I left it in my notes so we'll be
[1:22:18] all right
[1:22:19] whom he did foreknow he also did
[1:22:22] predestinate to be what to be conformed
[1:22:27] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:22:30] what the first war among my father's
[1:22:33] children the first one
[1:22:36] he could be the example he could be the
[1:22:37] our type before God he could be our
[1:22:40] representation before God the firstborn
[1:22:43] of many brethren amen
[1:22:45] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:22:47] he also called him he called him he also
[1:22:49] justified whom he justified them he also
[1:22:51] glorified and he says what shall we then
[1:22:53] say to these things if God be for us who
[1:22:55] can be against us he despair not his own
[1:22:57] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:23:00] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:23:03] us all things we have within us the
[1:23:12] genes of our father and mother and
[1:23:15] they're passed down from fallen Adam and
[1:23:17] Eve what we want is the genes of God and
[1:23:24] so sometimes we'll say something we
[1:23:25] shouldn't say we'll get angry when we
[1:23:28] shouldn't will react in a way that we
[1:23:29] shouldn't and you just think oh god oh
[1:23:32] god why did I have to do that I don't
[1:23:35] want to be like that I want to be like
[1:23:36] my perfect father to be therefore
[1:23:39] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:23:40] perfect
[1:23:41] I want to be like my perfect father but
[1:23:43] brother man taught us that alike
[1:23:45] Elijah's robe didn't fit Elijah the
[1:23:48] first time he put it on he put it on was
[1:23:50] too big and brother Brown said God
[1:23:55] didn't change the Rope to fit Elijah but
[1:23:58] he changed Elijah to fit the rope so by
[1:24:01] the time he got done following the
[1:24:03] prophets ministry but the time he got
[1:24:06] done Elijah's robe fit a light or
[1:24:10] Elijah's robe fit Elijah just right but
[1:24:13] the best thing you've got to alter
[1:24:14] yourself to meet God's Holy Spirit
[1:24:17] you've got to alter yourself to meet
[1:24:19] God's Holy Spirit God won't alter the
[1:24:22] spirit to meet your desire but you've
[1:24:25] got to alter yourself so what the Bible
[1:24:29] says Elijah had several years of growing
[1:24:31] to fit the rope oh my now when I don't
[1:24:37] know whether I get for the rest of this
[1:24:38] or not but I just want to go through a
[1:24:39] couple more quotes and then we'll close
[1:24:43] brother Bram says I hope the words not
[1:24:46] boring you
[1:24:47] and that's true this morning as well
[1:24:50] he said born Christians listen closely
[1:24:54] grow into the stature of Christ as they
[1:24:58] live but you've got to be born first
[1:25:01] you've got to be born again you must be
[1:25:04] born again because until you're born
[1:25:05] again you don't grow but the day you're
[1:25:08] born again didn't born Christians grow
[1:25:10] into the stature of Christ as they live
[1:25:13] they're born again and their lives begin
[1:25:17] to shape like a baby and we think why
[1:25:20] did this have to happen in my life it's
[1:25:21] God maturing us but he said their lives
[1:25:24] begin to shape like a baby it takes form
[1:25:26] and begins to grow first thing you know
[1:25:28] here they are in the full stature there
[1:25:31] you are
[1:25:32] day after day and see this is different
[1:25:34] from anything Pentecost taught from
[1:25:37] anything denominations taught because
[1:25:39] they taught well you're born again
[1:25:40] you're saved and then praise God you
[1:25:42] ready for the rapture but he said you
[1:25:43] grow into it you grow into the full
[1:25:46] stature of a son of God there you are
[1:25:48] day after day year after year they
[1:25:50] stayed the same
[1:25:51] he said now come back to the word if you
[1:25:54] abide in me brother Brent says they say
[1:25:57] I got born again hallelujah I joined
[1:26:00] them I joined this I joined I don't know
[1:26:03] last year I believed in Jesus name now I
[1:26:05] backed it out I believe this I did
[1:26:08] believe you had to be holy he said
[1:26:10] they're Wanderers tossed about with
[1:26:12] every wind of doctrine but be born of
[1:26:15] the Spirit and grow into the stature of
[1:26:17] Christ and brother man teaches us very
[1:26:21] clearly and yet and many message circles
[1:26:23] were taught that you have to grow into
[1:26:24] the birth that's not what you grow into
[1:26:26] you're born in the spirit and grow into
[1:26:28] the stature of Christ and those things
[1:26:31] are present in you but you increase
[1:26:33] those things he said you're growing into
[1:26:36] the stature of Christ though you're
[1:26:37] through your life he said it proves like
[1:26:40] if you were born a prophet you'll remain
[1:26:42] that if you were born a Christian you'll
[1:26:44] remain that if you abide in me and my
[1:26:46] words abide in you this grows you up
[1:26:48] into the stature of Christ he said not
[1:26:51] some young lawyer beating screaming
[1:26:53] crying and brother Brennan was making
[1:26:55] reference to a story that he told about
[1:26:57] a young lawyer who couldn't win the case
[1:26:59] because he's just the most
[1:27:01] but it took a seasoned attorney who who
[1:27:04] knew the facts of the case and presented
[1:27:05] them calmly but I been typeset to being
[1:27:08] born again really born against someone
[1:27:10] who's seasoned in the Word of God and
[1:27:12] someone who just has emotions so he said
[1:27:14] not some young law you're beating
[1:27:15] screaming crying tell you this out of
[1:27:17] the other make a lot of emotions but
[1:27:18] somebody who's grown into the stature of
[1:27:21] Christ through the years have seasoned
[1:27:23] out and proved standing at the helm he
[1:27:26] said no other on Christ the solid rock
[1:27:28] we've stand all other ground is sinking
[1:27:30] sand
[1:27:30] let denominations and creeds come go let
[1:27:33] isms keep me humble hard stay right with
[1:27:37] the word and move right on through the
[1:27:38] stream is that your prayers this morning
[1:27:40] she'll guide us to the shore he said
[1:27:43] that's full stature meant I don't know
[1:27:45] if that's a word but I think we know
[1:27:47] what he means fall statute when we grow
[1:27:50] up into the fullness of the measure of
[1:27:51] Christ the Branham says this is a dying
[1:27:55] spirit in a dying body and now you can't
[1:28:01] be in two bodies at one time but there
[1:28:03] can be two natures in you at one time he
[1:28:05] said know the nature of the Spirit of
[1:28:07] the Lord when you're born again you're
[1:28:08] not born a physical like the baby was
[1:28:10] but what's happened the spiritual birth
[1:28:12] has come to you while the spiritual
[1:28:15] birth is growing into your heart of God
[1:28:19] there is a physical or a celestial body
[1:28:22] growing to receive that spirit and when
[1:28:25] the life leaves this body it goes to
[1:28:28] that body just as when the body is
[1:28:31] presented to the earth the Spirit comes
[1:28:32] in and when the spirit goes out of the
[1:28:34] body there is a body waiting for we know
[1:28:37] that after this earthly tabernacle be
[1:28:39] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:28:43] what is he doing he's nurturing us all
[1:28:46] through life and we get down to the end
[1:28:47] of life and sometimes we think well I
[1:28:49] just don't know what he's doing and
[1:28:51] sometimes even at the end of life as
[1:28:53] people grow older we deal with things
[1:28:55] like Alzheimer's you deal with
[1:28:56] sicknesses and I know there's people
[1:28:58] that are just ready to go home and some
[1:29:00] that aren't even cognizant in any more
[1:29:02] of what's going on and you think why
[1:29:04] would God leave them in the body that
[1:29:06] way got to be some level of maturity
[1:29:10] he's reaching in that person we don't
[1:29:13] understand it
[1:29:14] they don't even understand it but he's
[1:29:16] he's doing something to express the gene
[1:29:18] seed of God even in that moment of
[1:29:20] weakness where they may not even know
[1:29:21] who they are and that's why we don't
[1:29:24] just go out and pull the plug on
[1:29:25] everybody God knew how long they would
[1:29:27] live God knew all about it
[1:29:29] maybe they live and suffer for years and
[1:29:31] we don't understand it but the moment
[1:29:33] that that spirit passes on the spirit
[1:29:37] goes out of the body there's a body
[1:29:38] waiting amen well I'm ready for that
[1:29:42] full adoption I'm ready for that but
[1:29:46] evidently he thinks I got more time to
[1:29:48] mature we think we're ready and I
[1:29:51] believe that we are we see the things
[1:29:53] going on around us we're ready for a
[1:29:54] rapture but God has some more maturing
[1:29:57] for us to do how can we be our father's
[1:30:00] children he and that's what we read when
[1:30:02] we started out he said if you love your
[1:30:04] neighbour you treat your enemies like
[1:30:06] your friends love your enemies that's
[1:30:09] hard to do said but if you do you'll be
[1:30:11] your father's children you have these
[1:30:15] fruits to the spear in your life you'll
[1:30:16] be your father's children how can you be
[1:30:18] your my father's children your father's
[1:30:20] children by letting the Holy Spirit
[1:30:23] brood over your life how do you do that
[1:30:26] you pray you read your Bible you go to
[1:30:28] church you give God time in your life
[1:30:31] don't get frustrated because you see
[1:30:33] things in your life that shouldn't be
[1:30:34] there - well I'll just quit church until
[1:30:36] it gets right know you'll never mature
[1:30:37] you just keep coming keep immature and
[1:30:39] keep working keep hearing the word until
[1:30:42] those things begin to be weeded out of
[1:30:43] your life until that God that seeing you
[1:30:45] that gene seed of God grows into what
[1:30:47] it's supposed to be and then you begin
[1:30:49] to express the things that God wanted
[1:30:51] you to express if the musicians would
[1:30:54] come with our heads together wherever
[1:30:59] you're watching and I know I've
[1:31:01] forgotten at times to acknowledge you
[1:31:03] that are watching this morning but I
[1:31:06] know that you're there and wherever you
[1:31:07] are maybe you can just bow your head
[1:31:11] where you are in your home or wherever
[1:31:13] that it is if we could play Amazing
[1:31:15] Grace if
[1:31:20] maybe you've just not expressed what you
[1:31:23] want to express in your life you don't
[1:31:26] understand what's going on
[1:31:27] God wants to express himself in your
[1:31:31] life but you just surrendered to him
[1:31:33] more fully this morning take a few
[1:31:35] minutes and let the Holy Spirit brood
[1:31:37] over your life you might think well I
[1:31:40] got things to do I've got work today
[1:31:42] I've got a Father's Day thing going on
[1:31:44] something's going on but would you just
[1:31:46] take a moment let the Holy Spirit
[1:31:49] atmosphere matters it matters we come to
[1:31:52] church for a reason we be gathered
[1:31:54] together for a reason because it matters
[1:31:56] that were under those wings we want to
[1:31:58] be under those wings but he said I'll
[1:32:00] never leave you and ever I'll never
[1:32:01] forsake you and so where you're at today
[1:32:03] he's there even if it's just you
[1:32:07] watching this morning he's there he's
[1:32:08] he's with you maybe you'll watch this
[1:32:11] later on but he's still there with you
[1:32:13] he wants to guide you and lead you he
[1:32:15] wants to express those scenes in your
[1:32:17] life maybe you that gene of anxiety was
[1:32:21] passed on from your parent that gene of
[1:32:23] depression those things that are passed
[1:32:25] on would you just let God come in and
[1:32:28] and let the gene seed of God begin to
[1:32:31] overpower those things that begin to
[1:32:33] silence those genes that are speaking
[1:32:36] through your life of fear and depression
[1:32:37] and and ungodliness and let the gene
[1:32:41] seat of God begin to grow in your life
[1:32:43] in the way that it should be would you
[1:32:44] just pray that way this morning maybe
[1:32:46] you don't fully understand but you say
[1:32:48] help me Lord to become your child that's
[1:32:49] what it's all about is becoming your
[1:32:52] child to be the children of our Heavenly
[1:32:54] Father Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:32:58] father's day
[1:33:00] or just another day here on the earth
[1:33:02] maybe one not as important as Mother's
[1:33:04] Day too many today we think of you as
[1:33:07] our Heavenly Father oh god we've had
[1:33:11] fathers of the earth and they didn't
[1:33:13] always do what they were supposed to all
[1:33:15] of us fail at some point or another
[1:33:17] maybe father's listening this morning
[1:33:19] maybe had some conviction in their life
[1:33:21] because they've let things display in
[1:33:24] their life that aren't right but Oh God
[1:33:25] but you just move Lord in our lives and
[1:33:28] nurture us today we want to be good

[1:33:48] we're so grateful for that Lord where
[1:33:50] we've not matured and we might say well
[1:33:53] Lord I've come to that place but as long
[1:33:56] as you're here there's room for that
[1:33:57] seed to grow and express itself in your
[1:33:59] life I pray you've granite Lord God I
[1:34:02] pray it would just move and express the
[1:34:05] things of God in our lives
