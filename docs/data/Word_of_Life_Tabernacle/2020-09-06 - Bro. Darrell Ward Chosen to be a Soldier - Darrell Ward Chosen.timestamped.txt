[20:04] man
[20:09] just had a little testimony about this
[20:12] song i'm fixing saying it
[20:14] really spoke to my heart and it brought
[20:17] back years ago
[20:18] uh when i first went out west and
[20:20] started elk hunting i didn't know a
[20:21] whole lot about it
[20:23] but jeff you'll appreciate this he's
[20:24] been out there with me time
[20:27] and uh i was coming down off the
[20:28] mountain one morning and we killed some
[20:30] game up there
[20:32] and i heard a commotion behind me and i
[20:33] looked and here come up
[20:35] a cow elk come down off the mountain
[20:37] behind me
[20:38] and she hit this valley that i was
[20:40] fixing to go into and
[20:42] i could see for 10 miles there wasn't
[20:44] nothing i mean it was open
[20:45] clear so she started out across this
[20:48] and she had to go however far it was
[20:50] there to get some cover
[20:53] but her tongue was hanging out of her
[20:54] mouth she was just running for all she
[20:56] was worth
[20:58] and uh i never seen that before and it
[21:00] concerned me because i didn't know
[21:01] anything about
[21:02] help i don't know how long she'd last i
[21:04] didn't think she would make it across
[21:06] that valley
[21:07] and there was an old resident that come
[21:09] down the hill behind me he no doubt had
[21:11] spooked her off of there and
[21:13] i told him i said sir i said i don't
[21:16] know a lot about elk but i said
[21:17] see that elk out there i said she just
[21:19] come out here and said her tongue was
[21:21] hanging out of her mouth and
[21:23] said i don't think she'll make it across
[21:25] there
[21:26] he looked at me and he said he said
[21:28] sonny boy said
[21:30] don't you worry about that elk said
[21:33] she's just starting to run when that
[21:34] tongue hangs out he said besides that
[21:37] said she's not
[21:38] planning on staying in the valley she's
[21:40] just changing mountains
[21:41] that's what she said and when i heard
[21:44] this song it was years later
[21:46] but i never i guess if i'd have been
[21:48] inspired and had the right inspiration i
[21:51] would have caught that song but
[21:53] i heard the words to this song the other
[21:54] day and it was a new song that a man has
[21:56] sung
[21:57] and it's called changing mountains and
[21:59] it just really spoke to my heart
[22:00] and sister mary i kind of throwed it on
[22:03] her but
[22:03] we're going to try it we may butcher it
[22:05] up but i want you to get the message of
[22:06] the song
[22:07] if nothing else so this morning
[22:11] when i decided i wanted to sing try to
[22:12] sing it because seeing brother daryl
[22:14] come out and preach like he preached

[37:03] privilege to have
[37:04] once again brother darrell ward with us
[37:06] i won't take any more of his time
[37:08] but i told him he could have 30 minutes
[37:10] or three hours

[40:21] isn't that wonderful you remember the
[40:24] day the lord first
[40:25] got a hold of your heart
[40:29] i hope i'd never forget that day
[40:32] december the 21st
[40:33] 1981 2 o'clock in the afternoon as a
[40:36] sunday afternoon i'd
[40:38] ashamed to tell you but i'd been out
[40:40] drinking the night before
[40:42] doing things you shouldn't be doing
[40:46] i was in old building by myself the
[40:47] place down in jonesburg tennessee you
[40:50] know
[40:50] antique top story
[40:51] [Music]
[40:54] i felt the presence of the lord come on
[40:56] me i i knew it was him because i felt
[40:59] him when i was a boy
[41:01] and i ran around that store and i got to
[41:03] crying and
[41:05] i thought i got to get out of here i
[41:07] just got out of the army i'm tough you
[41:09] know
[41:11] i run around there and turn the light
[41:13] off and run around turn the same light
[41:15] back on i just
[41:16] i got to the door i put my hand on the
[41:19] doorknob and there's a voice spoke to me
[41:21] just as real
[41:22] as i'm speaking to you right now he said
[41:25] if you go out that door
[41:27] i'll never call you again and right
[41:30] there at that door
[41:31] i knelt down i gave the lord my
[41:35] heart and i said lord wherever you lead
[41:37] me i'll follow you
[41:41] and you think that he would take my
[41:43] place
[41:45] that i could become an expression of
[41:48] christ
[41:49] in this hour and i was out in the field
[41:51] there the other day and i was telling

[46:46] as many of you well know this afternoon
[46:50] there is a war
[46:52] that is going on between two armies
[46:56] it is an army of darkness and it is an
[46:58] army
[46:59] of light and i want you to understand
[47:02] this afternoon that you
[47:04] have been chosen in this army of light
[47:07] to serve
[47:08] on the front lines you wasn't drafted
[47:12] you didn't have to register for the
[47:14] selective service
[47:15] i know they have a volunteer army but
[47:18] this is not a volunteer army
[47:21] you didn't have to nor could you choose
[47:23] to be
[47:24] here but you were chosen before the
[47:27] foundation
[47:27] of the world you were chosen by god
[47:31] to be a soldier in the army of god
[47:34] you say where do you get that at the
[47:36] bible says in john 15
[47:38] 16 ye have not chosen me
[47:41] but i have chosen you and ordained you
[47:45] that you should go forth and bring forth
[47:47] fruit that your fruit should remain that
[47:49] whatsoever you ask the father
[47:51] in my name he may give it to you
[47:55] so you can't volunteer for this army you
[47:57] can't raise your pick me pick me
[47:59] but i want you to know god chose you
[48:02] before the foundation of the world
[48:04] to be a part of his army for this last
[48:07] day battle
[48:08] the battle that you've been called to
[48:10] fight in has been raging for years
[48:13] the first great battle that was ever
[48:15] fought it began in heaven
[48:17] when michael and his angels fought
[48:19] against lucifer
[48:20] and his angels it first started in
[48:22] heaven
[48:23] the battle was in heaven and then it was
[48:26] cast down upon the earth
[48:28] it originated in heaven but it's on the
[48:30] earth this afternoon
[48:32] it was thrown down from heaven cast out
[48:34] of heaven to the earth
[48:35] and fell on human beings
[48:39] the battle from angels became human
[48:43] battles and i want you to know as we
[48:46] said this morning
[48:47] that satan has come to destroy god's
[48:50] creation
[48:52] what god created for himself satan hates
[48:56] that
[48:57] amen when god chose you he wanted your
[49:00] fellowship
[49:02] and the devil hates the fellowship that
[49:04] you have between you and god
[49:06] so he'll do anything that he can to
[49:09] break that fellowship
[49:11] satan wants to destroy what god created
[49:14] for himself
[49:16] hallelujah this bride of jesus christ
[49:19] does not belong to an organization
[49:21] she doesn't belong to a denomination she
[49:23] doesn't belong to a man
[49:25] but it's god's people god's bride god's
[49:28] army
[49:30] hallelujah amen
[49:34] amen he come to destroy that was his
[49:36] purpose was to destroy it
[49:39] oh how he wants to destroy young people
[49:41] take their lives while they're young
[49:43] and throw them into bondage of alcohol
[49:45] and drugs and
[49:46] prostitution all kinds of bondage
[49:52] satan was to destroy his purpose was
[49:56] to destroy the battle began on earth
[49:59] and it began in us and it's been raging
[50:02] ever since

[50:07] placed you
[50:08] in any part of the battle that he chose
[50:11] to place you
[50:12] in he could have placed you in the
[50:14] battle for justification
[50:16] he could have placed you in the battle
[50:17] for sanctification he could have placed
[50:19] you in the battle
[50:20] of restoration of the gifts but he chose
[50:23] to place you
[50:24] in this hour of great darkness
[50:28] god could have put you in any age he
[50:30] could have put us here when jesus
[50:32] himself walked the earth
[50:33] but he chose to place you here there's
[50:35] something god wants to accomplish
[50:37] in your life in the last day to show
[50:40] satan
[50:41] that his people can overcome amen
[50:45] he placed you in this hour of darkness
[50:47] called to the front lines

[50:52] kingdom

[54:35] church amen
[54:38] hallelujah what was the power of
[54:40] pentecost
[54:42] what fueled pentecost
[54:45] the bible said when the day of pentecost
[54:47] had fully come
[54:48] they were all in one accord in one place
[54:51] and suddenly
[54:52] there came a sound from heaven as the
[54:54] rushing mighty wind
[54:56] and filled all the house where they were
[54:58] sitting
[55:00] not just some of the house not just the
[55:02] preacher not just the song leader
[55:03] but from the front door to the back door

[55:26] personal in your life
[55:28] he wants to lead you as a commanding
[55:30] officer
[55:31] he wants you to be a soldier that he can
[55:33] use
[55:34] to fight against the wiles of the devil
[55:36] in the day that we're living in we don't
[55:38] have to point back to some other age
[55:40] well jesus if you was here

[55:44] time we rise
[55:45] and take our god-given rights

[56:38] them
[56:41] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[56:43] and began to speak with other tongues as
[56:44] the spirit gave them utterance
[56:46] the power of pentecost what fueled
[56:49] pentecost
[56:50] what was it that stirred pentecost what
[56:52] moved
[56:53] pentecost not don't misunderstand me but
[56:57] it wasn't a miracle
[56:58] it wasn't a gift it wasn't a tongue that
[57:00] wasn't what that was the manifestation
[57:02] of it
[57:03] that was the results of it that was not
[57:05] what fueled it but
[57:06] what actually full uh fueled pentecost
[57:09] it was the power of pentecost is god in
[57:13] his people licks of fire sitting upon
[57:15] each one of them
[57:16] god said in hebrews 12 29 i am a
[57:18] consuming fire
[57:20] hallelujah and god divided himself among

[1:02:31] his mind

[1:02:34] bring the past
[1:02:35] there's no demon there's no power
[1:02:37] there's nothing
[1:02:38] that can ever separate god's great
[1:02:41] immortal eternal

[1:06:33] boy scouts
[1:06:35] we're soldiers of the cross paul told
[1:06:38] timothy

[1:07:42] become a soldier to fight
[1:07:44] to fight the good fight of faith i

[1:08:01] see the trials and testings and
[1:08:03] afflictions of life
[1:08:04] why does god allow them to come if he
[1:08:06] loves us if he cares for us
[1:08:08] why should we ever have to cry why
[1:08:10] should we ever have to suffer why should
[1:08:11] we ever have to face disappointment
[1:08:13] god does that he allows those things
[1:08:15] into our life to mold us
[1:08:17] demote a character in us that's fit to
[1:08:19] reign
[1:08:20] he moses as soldiers to endure hardships
[1:08:26] amen the characters never earned
[1:08:29] characters never earned on top of the
[1:08:31] mountain it's the top of the mountains
[1:08:32] where you shout the victory you shout
[1:08:34] the victory on top of the mountain
[1:08:36] but it's in the valley that's where the
[1:08:38] victories were
[1:08:45] amen amen

[1:08:58] circumstance
[1:08:59] your current hardship or your current
[1:09:01] trial may be a direct
[1:09:02] result of being chosen by god
[1:09:07] for his army you see as the battle rages
[1:09:12] you become a real target
[1:09:16] the enemy may have an arson of weapons
[1:09:19] that he may try
[1:09:20] to keep you suppressed depressed
[1:09:22] compressed
[1:09:23] distressed burdened down come on
[1:09:27] somebody
[1:09:28] try to get your mind confused gets you
[1:09:31] all upset
[1:09:31] gets you nervous gets you down get you
[1:09:34] to all get you confused about what the

[1:09:41] and know that no matter what the devil
[1:09:44] throws at you
[1:09:45] the bible says that no weapon formed
[1:09:47] against me
[1:09:48] shall prosper
[1:09:52] i may be a real target you may be a real
[1:09:55] target but i want the devil to know
[1:09:57] we are a real army
[1:10:02] are equipped to fight god equips his
[1:10:05] army for the battle
[1:10:06] he's called them the fight ephesians 6
[1:10:08] 10 says it this way
[1:10:09] finally my brother be strong in the lord
[1:10:11] in the power of his might
[1:10:13] but on the whole armor of god that you
[1:10:15] may be able to stand against the wiles
[1:10:17] of the devil
[1:10:18] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:10:20] blood but against principalities against
[1:10:22] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:10:24] this world
[1:10:24] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:10:26] places
[1:10:28] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[1:10:31] of god
[1:10:31] that you may be able to withstand in the
[1:10:33] evil day and having done all to stand
[1:10:38] having done all to stand verse 14
[1:10:42] stand
[1:10:46] hallelujah stand
[1:10:49] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:10:51] with truth having the breastplate of
[1:10:53] righteousness and your feet sod with the
[1:10:55] preparation of the gospel of peace and
[1:10:58] above all take the shield of faith
[1:10:59] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:11:01] all the fiery darts of the wicked take
[1:11:03] the helmet of salvation
[1:11:04] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:11:07] word of god
[1:11:09] don't lay your weapon down stay in the
[1:11:12] word
[1:11:14] praying always praying always
[1:11:18] with proud prayer and supplication in
[1:11:20] the spirit
[1:11:22] he names all these weapons and then he
[1:11:24] gives us one more weapon
[1:11:26] that if we're honest we hardly ever use
[1:11:29] it like we should
[1:11:30] and that is the weapon of prayer
[1:11:34] prayer is not a burden it is a weapon
[1:11:39] you can eat too much god knows we do
[1:11:41] that you can laugh too much
[1:11:43] you can socialize too much but you'll
[1:11:46] never ever
[1:11:47] be able to pray too much
[1:11:51] paul said i would that men everywhere
[1:11:52] would pray always
[1:11:55] pray at the red light well when i get
[1:11:56] home i can get in my prayer closet yeah
[1:11:58] there's times for your prayer closet
[1:11:59] those times we should get in our prayer
[1:12:01] closet but you don't have to wait till
[1:12:02] you're in the prayer closet you can pray
[1:12:04] at the red light
[1:12:05] i guarantee you start praying at the red
[1:12:06] light the devil make it turn green
[1:12:12] because there's one thing he don't want
[1:12:13] you to do he don't want you to pray
[1:12:16] come on friends you know it's the truth
[1:12:17] you get down to pray the phone to ring
[1:12:19] it'll go all day you won't get one text
[1:12:22] and you get in the closet to pray
[1:12:25] why the devil don't want you to pray
[1:12:28] because he understands that when the
[1:12:29] weakest christian
[1:12:30] gets down on their knees to pray all
[1:12:33] hell trembles
[1:12:34] and i tell you there's enough of us here
[1:12:36] to give hell a nervous breakdown
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] praying always with all prayer and
[1:12:42] supplication in the spirit watching
[1:12:44] there until with all perseverance and
[1:12:46] supplication of all saints notice
[1:12:48] there's no armor in the back
[1:12:52] for we are to stand and not
[1:12:55] retreat we're not to retreat
[1:12:59] we can not flee from the devil that's
[1:13:04] what the devil wants you to do
[1:13:06] he says blue try to get you to run
[1:13:09] but you see it's wrong that's wrong
[1:13:12] according to the scriptures that's wrong
[1:13:15] for the bible says
[1:13:17] we don't flee from the devil but the
[1:13:19] bible says in james 4
[1:13:21] 7 that the devil flees from us
[1:13:25] hallelujah it's not the devil saying boo
[1:13:28] but it's you saying boo to the devil
[1:13:33] amen amen submit yourself therefore to
[1:13:37] god
[1:13:38] resist the devil and he
[1:13:41] will flee from you
[1:13:45] god's army does not retreat
[1:13:49] it goes on the army of god
[1:13:52] always marches forward
[1:13:55] always moving forward endure the
[1:13:58] hardness
[1:14:00] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[1:14:03] no man that wareth entangled himself
[1:14:06] with the affairs
[1:14:07] of this life that he may please him who
[1:14:10] hath
[1:14:10] chosen him to be a soldier
[1:14:16] no man entangleth that means no man goes
[1:14:19] to warfare
[1:14:20] to make a military operation to do
[1:14:21] military duty to be on active service to
[1:14:24] be a soldier to fight
[1:14:26] no soldier when in service
[1:14:29] gets entangled in the enterprises of
[1:14:32] civilian life
[1:14:33] his aim is to satisfy and please
[1:14:36] the one who chose him
[1:14:42] he said don't entangle yourself with the
[1:14:44] affairs of the world
[1:14:45] don't get so caught up in politics that
[1:14:46] you get so mad you can't even pray
[1:14:50] well i'm a democrat i'm a republican
[1:14:53] they both work for the same boss
[1:15:01] well gloria i'm going home i'm going
[1:15:04] soon
[1:15:07] people get so mad they can't even have
[1:15:09] family meals because they get to argue
[1:15:11] over politics
[1:15:12] we're christians don't entangle yourself
[1:15:16] in the enterprises of civilian life
[1:15:18] anyone that's ever been enlisted in the
[1:15:20] military is familiar with the term
[1:15:23] civilian anybody here ever been in the
[1:15:24] army yeah back there's one
[1:15:27] there's one god bless you for your
[1:15:29] service civilian
[1:15:31] it's a term when you become a soldier
[1:15:34] you understand this term of civilian
[1:15:37] life
[1:15:38] when a man is enlisted in the army or
[1:15:40] the military
[1:15:41] they find their self in basic training
[1:15:45] and once you're in basic training
[1:15:47] certain expectations are required of you
[1:15:50] the commander-in-chief expects you to
[1:15:52] act a certain way
[1:15:54] you no longer act like a civilian which
[1:15:57] is non-military
[1:15:58] but you are ordered you are expected to
[1:16:01] conduct yourself
[1:16:02] as a soldier and not a civilian
[1:16:06] so when you say civilian you're saying
[1:16:08] anyone that's not in the military
[1:16:10] is a civilian you are military personnel
[1:16:15] and once you're in basic training they
[1:16:16] expect certain
[1:16:18] things of you you can't act like a
[1:16:20] civilian
[1:16:21] because of seville let me say that again
[1:16:23] you can't act like a civilian
[1:16:25] brother what are you saying i'm saying
[1:16:27] this you can't act like the world and be
[1:16:29] a christian
[1:16:35] amen you have to act like a soldier
[1:16:39] i was 17 year old i joined the army when
[1:16:42] i was 16 my parents signed for me
[1:16:44] i went in a program called delay entry
[1:16:47] program so i could get the gi bill cause
[1:16:48] we was poor
[1:16:49] my mom and daddy couldn't afford to go
[1:16:51] to send us to college so the only way i
[1:16:52] knew i could get to college was go to
[1:16:54] the military and use my gi bill
[1:16:56] so i joined and they was they was
[1:16:57] phasing it out but you could join and
[1:16:59] delay for 11 months and still get the gi
[1:17:01] bill
[1:17:02] so i become a part of a program called
[1:17:03] depth delay entry program
[1:17:05] and my mom and daddy signed for me and
[1:17:07] my whole senior year
[1:17:09] i was already in the military just
[1:17:11] waiting to go to basic training when i
[1:17:12] graduated
[1:17:13] i graduated from high school on june the
[1:17:15] 9th and june the 14th i was in fort sill
[1:17:18] oklahoma
[1:17:19] in basic training
[1:17:22] oh i'll never forget it i was looking
[1:17:25] back and i was just a kid i thought what
[1:17:27] was i thinking
[1:17:33] they took us in there first thing we did
[1:17:35] had to take off all of our civilian
[1:17:37] clothes and put them in a box
[1:17:38] and they gave us a uniform and then they
[1:17:42] took us
[1:17:42] to the barber
[1:17:46] i didn't put this old boy in the chair
[1:17:47] i'll never forget it had this big old
[1:17:49] fro
[1:17:49] they wore froze back in the 70s had this
[1:17:51] big old fro
[1:17:52] and he sat down in the chair and the
[1:17:54] barber said how do you want it he said
[1:17:56] cut a little bit off the back and just
[1:17:57] kind of trim it up to the sides
[1:17:59] he said the barber said i could do that
[1:18:00] yeah
[1:18:04] he cried like a baby
[1:18:08] they took his throat
[1:18:16] um you could read the constitution
[1:18:19] through his hair
[1:18:24] look
[1:18:31] we were all recruits and they turned us
[1:18:34] into soldiers
[1:18:36] by being taught to endure hardness the
[1:18:40] hardness we endured
[1:18:41] is what may the soldiers these brothers
[1:18:43] will tell you if they was in the
[1:18:44] military they'll tell you the same thing
[1:18:46] they instilled in us the army's concept
[1:18:48] of discipline and obedience
[1:18:51] we endured hours of drilling endless
[1:18:54] parades
[1:18:55] long route marches constant pressure
[1:18:59] tasteless food that'd been a good time
[1:19:03] to have kobe we was eating some of that
[1:19:04] food
[1:19:05] we didn't have no sense of smell or
[1:19:06] taste
[1:19:11] i remember that had monkey bars
[1:19:14] at the front of the mess hall in
[1:19:16] oklahoma they didn't have no hood
[1:19:18] the bars were hot and you'd have to jump
[1:19:20] up and go across these monkey bars
[1:19:22] and if you went all the way through you
[1:19:23] could go in and eat if you fell off you
[1:19:25] had to go to the back of the line
[1:19:28] and those bars was hot and they would
[1:19:29] burn blisters on your hands
[1:19:32] or they'd be standing there and they'd
[1:19:33] say ben when's the last time you wrote
[1:19:35] home
[1:19:37] if it wasn't the day before they'd send
[1:19:39] you back to the barracks to write a
[1:19:40] letter
[1:19:41] and if you didn't get it wrote and
[1:19:43] stamped licked and put in the mailbox by
[1:19:44] the time
[1:19:45] chow was over you didn't eat you said
[1:19:47] that was cruel
[1:19:48] that was hard they shouldn't have done
[1:19:49] you that way but they were training us
[1:19:51] for the time when you're in combat and
[1:19:53] you can't eat at 11 o'clock
[1:19:55] you can't eat at one o'clock some days
[1:19:56] you have to go hours you have to go days
[1:19:58] without eating
[1:19:59] because you're in a foxhole at the
[1:20:01] enemy's in their position come on
[1:20:02] somebody
[1:20:03] and you have to endure the hardness of
[1:20:05] the soldier
[1:20:06] to defend your god-given rights of
[1:20:08] americans
[1:20:11] constant pressure tasteless food guard
[1:20:14] duty
[1:20:15] bullying of sergeants um
[1:20:19] thank god for god called pastors
[1:20:23] that you think bully you sometimes but
[1:20:26] you see it's only the love of god
[1:20:28] it's only the love of god when we come
[1:20:30] here sometimes and being skins are hide
[1:20:32] and hides are hung up all over the
[1:20:34] church he don't do that because he likes
[1:20:36] that
[1:20:36] he does that because he's called of god
[1:20:39] to mold you into a soldier
[1:20:41] who's fit to fight for you to endure the
[1:20:43] hardships
[1:20:44] of laodicea and to be an overcomer in
[1:20:47] this age
[1:20:47] they call it bullying it's not bullying
[1:20:50] it's god getting us ready
[1:20:56] exposure to inclement weather the whole
[1:20:59] procedure
[1:21:00] everything they'd done they had a
[1:21:01] purpose in doing it
[1:21:03] it was to harden us it was the toughen
[1:21:05] us up
[1:21:07] it was to make us soldiers
[1:21:12] i remember i'll never forget when we
[1:21:14] went to graduate from basic training
[1:21:16] i cannot even tell you the things they
[1:21:19] called us
[1:21:21] it's pretty bad they called us
[1:21:23] everything they could think to call us
[1:21:25] but i'll never forget the day of
[1:21:26] graduation from basic training
[1:21:28] and they called us to attention and they
[1:21:30] said we've been hard on you and we've
[1:21:31] called you some bad names
[1:21:33] and we've said some bad things but i
[1:21:34] want you to know today
[1:21:37] you are called soldiers
[1:21:40] he was a great starter brother it was a
[1:21:43] great honor
[1:21:45] to be called a soldier he proved
[1:21:49] you had endured the hardship you had
[1:21:52] took the training
[1:21:53] hallelujah he was not overcome by the
[1:21:56] hardship
[1:21:56] he was not overcome by the affliction
[1:21:59] but you used those things to make you
[1:22:02] a good soldier
[1:22:05] the roman soldiers of paul's day they
[1:22:07] were the toughest most disciplined the
[1:22:08] world ever known they were the most
[1:22:10] efficient soldiers
[1:22:11] and paul had known many of them and the
[1:22:13] example was in his mind when he reminded
[1:22:14] timothy
[1:22:15] that he was a soldier of jesus christ he
[1:22:17] had been chosen
[1:22:18] picked out by god
[1:22:21] to endure hardness a good soldier does
[1:22:24] not
[1:22:25] quit because he faces difficult tasks
[1:22:28] or dangerous situations he knows that
[1:22:31] his life
[1:22:32] is expendable when i was in the army was
[1:22:35] known as a band of brothers
[1:22:37] we left no brother wounded on the
[1:22:39] battlefield if a brother was wounded on
[1:22:41] the battlefield
[1:22:42] we get them off the battlefield because
[1:22:44] they belong to us
[1:22:53] you may get wounded you may get hurt i
[1:22:56] may get wounded i may get hurt
[1:22:57] i may get knocked down but it doesn't
[1:23:00] change who i
[1:23:00] am i'm still a soldier
[1:23:04] something built into us a purpose
[1:23:06] something in us to fight and we'll rise
[1:23:08] up and we'll try again
[1:23:09] let me tell you god don't see how many
[1:23:11] times you get knocked down
[1:23:12] god don't see how many times you fail
[1:23:14] god don't see how many times you mess up
[1:23:16] all god sees is how many times you get
[1:23:18] up and knock the dust off
[1:23:20] and go again and i say if you've been
[1:23:23] knocked down
[1:23:24] don't quit don't turn back don't give up

[1:23:40] fiery line
[1:23:40] if i can't shoot no more god give me
[1:23:43] grace to pass the ammunition
[1:23:49] hallelujah paul tell timothy don't act
[1:23:51] like a civilian
[1:23:53] you're a soldier don't get caught up in
[1:23:55] the affairs of the world
[1:23:56] you have a mission you're here for a
[1:24:00] purpose
[1:24:02] don't get caught up in secondary things
[1:24:04] our mission is not to get caught up in
[1:24:05] the world don't look like the world
[1:24:07] dressed like the world act like the
[1:24:08] world
[1:24:10] we carry scars from our past life sure
[1:24:12] things we've done things we're still
[1:24:14] ashamed of
[1:24:16] but that don't define who i am
[1:24:21] i remember i remember jessica my
[1:24:23] daughter had to put a feeding tube in
[1:24:24] her
[1:24:24] because she was her brain was so damaged
[1:24:26] she couldn't swallow she lost her
[1:24:27] ability to swallow so they had to feed
[1:24:29] her through her stomach
[1:24:30] and after the lord jesus raised her up
[1:24:32] and she got better you've all seen the
[1:24:33] video that they made
[1:24:34] i trust you having but she came through
[1:24:36] the house one day and she pulled up her
[1:24:38] little shirt and she
[1:24:39] always told her she was special because
[1:24:41] right above her navel is where they put
[1:24:42] the feeding tube and so i always told
[1:24:44] her i said jessica you're special
[1:24:45] you got two belly buttons
[1:24:49] she come to the house one day and she
[1:24:52] pulled her shirt up she said daddy
[1:24:55] when's that scar going to go away i said
[1:24:58] honey
[1:24:59] that's going to be there for a while but
[1:25:00] it's okay
[1:25:02] it's all right well that was good enough
[1:25:04] for her she just went on through the
[1:25:05] house playing and i'll never forget i
[1:25:07] was sitting at the table
[1:25:08] i was studying genesis 24. eliezer
[1:25:10] fetching the bride for isaac i was
[1:25:12] looking at that
[1:25:13] and i was sitting there and i began to
[1:25:14] pray and i said god
[1:25:16] i said you could take that scar from her
[1:25:18] and you've done so much for her
[1:25:20] it would be a sin for me to doubt that
[1:25:23] you could do that
[1:25:24] i know you can take that scar from her
[1:25:26] and while i was there
[1:25:28] all of a sudden i felt this warm feeling
[1:25:29] come over me it wasn't an olive voice
[1:25:31] but it was a voice just as clear
[1:25:33] as i've ever heard a voice and this
[1:25:35] voice said
[1:25:36] i could take that scar from her and i
[1:25:39] just laid my head down
[1:25:40] i never moved i just laid down on the
[1:25:42] table and i just laid there and it
[1:25:43] seemed like forever brother david but it
[1:25:45] must have been like two or three minutes
[1:25:46] or something and i just laid there never
[1:25:48] moved
[1:25:49] and i felt it come on me again just this
[1:25:52] warm
[1:25:53] feeling anybody ever know what i'm
[1:25:54] talking about just a warm
[1:25:56] feeling and this voice spoke to me and
[1:25:58] said i could take that from her
[1:26:01] but i left it so that every time you see
[1:26:05] it
[1:26:06] it'll remind you of where i brought
[1:26:09] her from i wonder sometimes brother
[1:26:13] david if the scars
[1:26:14] in my life from my past life i wonder
[1:26:17] sometimes
[1:26:18] if god am i forgiven yes god don't even
[1:26:21] remember that i ever done it
[1:26:23] it's dropped in his bleach never to be
[1:26:25] remembered against me no more
[1:26:27] but the scars and i wonder sometimes if
[1:26:30] god don't leave those scars
[1:26:34] so that you can look at those things and
[1:26:36] remember this is where
[1:26:38] he brought you from lord
[1:26:41] oh god what an awesome god
[1:26:46] we're chosen by god to be soldiers
[1:26:50] sometimes we get so busy living
[1:26:54] we forget what we're really living for
[1:26:58] listen to me church should not be a part
[1:27:01] of your life
[1:27:06] church should not be a part of your life
[1:27:09] it should be
[1:27:11] your life
[1:27:15] it should be our lives
[1:27:19] for this is not the church this is just
[1:27:21] the building where the church gathers
[1:27:23] you're the church
[1:27:26] don't entangle yourself in the cares of
[1:27:28] the world paul knew what it meant to
[1:27:29] endure hardships

[1:27:33] the faith

[1:36:02] do you love you listen to me
[1:36:07] i joined the army when i was young like
[1:36:09] i told you
[1:36:10] because i wanted to get an education and
[1:36:13] i wanted to see the world
[1:36:16] and i joined this army i was with the
[1:36:17] 18th airborne corps fort bragg north
[1:36:19] carolina
[1:36:20] i was with the first and 73rd field
[1:36:21] artillery we could be anywhere in the
[1:36:23] world in 24 hours ready to fight
[1:36:25] our life expectancy was in battle was
[1:36:27] like 90 seconds or something like that
[1:36:29] i was on an advanced party that we moved
[1:36:30] into an area and we drove the enemy out
[1:36:32] of the area so we could bring our guns
[1:36:34] in and set our guns down so we come in
[1:36:36] on helicopters and we jumped out of
[1:36:37] helicopters and engaged the enemy never
[1:36:39] had to do it in person
[1:36:40] but i did do it a lot playing army and i
[1:36:42] enjoyed it with those blanks so
[1:36:44] it was so much fun when they were blanks
[1:36:48] but that was what my job was
[1:36:51] and i wanted to see the world when i
[1:36:53] graduated from basic training you know
[1:36:55] where they sent me
[1:36:56] fort bragg north carolina one state over
[1:36:59] from where i live
[1:37:00] six hours from home
[1:37:06] i spent all four years in north carolina
[1:37:16] how could that be i put him for korea i
[1:37:18] put it for germany
[1:37:20] i put in for any place i could put in
[1:37:21] for
[1:37:23] but nope you're needful essential
[1:37:24] personnel you're needful
[1:37:28] so i got out of the army that was 21
[1:37:30] year old on december the 21st 1981
[1:37:35] it was that day on a sunday afternoon
[1:37:37] that i found out
[1:37:39] for four years i had been in the wrong
[1:37:41] army
[1:37:43] i was actually chosen by god for his
[1:37:45] army
[1:37:47] and since i have been in god's army god
[1:37:50] by his grace and i say it humbly
[1:37:53] but god has allowed me to be in over 32
[1:38:00] countries

[1:38:42] never forget what my mama told me
[1:38:44] it stayed with me for years she told me
[1:38:47] one day
[1:38:48] she was down to 84 pounds and she said
[1:38:51] daryl

[1:38:56] does not have me
[1:39:05] i may endure hardships and battles and
[1:39:07] trials
[1:39:09] but they do not define who
[1:39:15] i am a soldier in the army
[1:39:19] of my lord and i'll hope for that hour
[1:39:22] little brothers
[1:39:24] well i can stand before him and lay my
[1:39:27] weapon down
[1:39:29] and study war no more

[1:39:37] out god give me the grace to get up
[1:39:39] and gum him to death

[1:50:26] the truth stand in the gospel and preach
[1:50:28] the truth
[1:50:29] and has been given that not only the
[1:50:32] ability
[1:50:33] but to live the life and and to be the
[1:50:35] kind of
[1:50:36] the kind of christian that god would
[1:50:37] call us to be but brandon said if you're
[1:50:39] not a preacher don't try to preach he
[1:50:42] said live your sermon
[1:50:43] but if you are a preacher he said preach
[1:50:45] your sermon and live it too
[1:50:47] amen that's what we've seen with our
[1:50:49] brother amen let's bow our heads
[1:50:50] together uh if we could play i'm amazed
[1:50:53] that you love me if you know that i'm

[1:51:16] so we thank god for that everything else
[1:51:18] we do like brother daryl said
[1:51:20] church is not a part of our life church
[1:51:22] is our life because we are the church of
[1:51:24] the living god
[1:51:25] it's so wonderful that he loves us let's
[1:51:27] just talk to him for a moment heavenly

[1:52:05] that it would be so and
[1:52:07] lord that we would never give up that
[1:52:08] we'll still be there
[1:52:10] the greatest things in my life is to go
[1:52:12] somewhere
[1:52:14] lord and see someone serving the lord
[1:52:15] maybe years later go back and they're
[1:52:17] still
[1:52:18] serving god it means so much to us and i
[1:52:21] pray
[1:52:22] god that it would be so with us that if
[1:52:24] brother darrell will come back by if the
[1:52:26] lord tarries in 10 years or
[1:52:28] 20 years we'd still be here are the few
[1:52:31] terry and so
[1:52:32] i pray it would be so may we never quit
[1:52:35] or if we fall may we get back
[1:52:36] up and go forward and press the battle
