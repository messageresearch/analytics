[35:33] revealed Matthew
[35:37] 1613 my goodness I was listening before
[35:40] church and we playing a portion of the
[35:42] tape and and uh I just wanted to keep
[35:44] listening to that for a while my
[35:47] goodness and I was so thankful also for
[35:49] the song service hasn't God been good to
[35:51] us and we just feel the presence of the
[35:53] Lord here with us and I'm so thankful
[35:56] for that and and to know that he's here
[35:58] than anything is possible and everything
[36:00] we have need of we should just be a
[36:03] happy people tonight and blessed and uh
[36:06] thinking about that song living on the
[36:07] Hallelujah side that's where we're at if
[36:10] they could write that maybe a hundred
[36:11] years ago when that song was written I
[36:13] they could write that then what about
[36:15] today we could say the Amen to that in
[36:17] our age we're living on the Hallelujah
[36:20] side amen are you glad to be in church
[36:22] tonight hey man good to good to be here
[36:25] with you Matthew 16:13
[36:27] Jesus came into the coast of cesaria
[36:29] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[36:32] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[36:36] they said some say that thou art John
[36:38] the Baptist some Elias and others
[36:41] Jeremiah are one of the prophets he
[36:44] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[36:47] am now that's what's important what do
[36:49] we have to say and Simon Peter answered
[36:52] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[36:55] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[36:58] said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[37:01] Jonah or son of Jonah for Flesh and
[37:04] Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[37:07] my Father which is in heaven I say also
[37:11] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[37:15] This Rock I will build my church and the
[37:18] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[37:20] it you glad for that promise tonight
[37:23] amen let's uh you can have your seats
[37:29] I got a little bit of a ringing in the
[37:34] speakers last time we looked at this
[37:37] subject we found out that God uh
[37:40] foreshadowed what he would do in Christ
[37:43] in the
[37:44] prophets and and the Bible tells us that
[37:47] in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one he
[37:49] said God who at sunry times or at
[37:52] different times in in diverse manners in
[37:55] different ways at different times spoke
[37:57] in times past unto the fathers by the
[38:00] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[38:02] unto us by his son so not in at
[38:05] different times and different manners
[38:07] but through one person his son whom Heth
[38:10] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[38:13] also he made the worlds who being the
[38:15] brightness of his glory and the express
[38:18] image of his person the express image so
[38:20] he makes a difference they were images
[38:22] they were they were types they were
[38:24] Shadows but he was the express image of
[38:27] his person and upholding All Things by
[38:29] the word of his power when he had by
[38:31] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[38:34] right hand of the Majesty on high now
[38:37] what the part of the sermon that we're
[38:39] getting to and it's so wonderful he's
[38:41] talking about Christ in you and and what
[38:44] that means and what it means that that
[38:47] when you say you have the Holy Ghost do
[38:48] you know what that means in this age
[38:50] that we're living in we're saying you
[38:52] have the token you you have the literal
[38:54] Life of Christ dwelling on the inside of
[38:56] you what does that that mean for you as
[38:58] an individual it means that you have the
[39:01] one who all the prophets typed in you so
[39:05] what you have in you is greater even
[39:08] than what the prophets had or what they
[39:10] typed because they were they were
[39:11] wonderful men Noah and Jacob and and
[39:14] Jonah and all those men but they were
[39:16] types of something and you have the
[39:18] reality living in you but so many times
[39:22] the reason why you don't recognize that
[39:24] why I don't recognize it is for the same
[39:26] reason why they didn't recognize him
[39:28] because of the Flesh and so they didn't
[39:30] necessarily know what was going on but
[39:32] they they played out their part anyway
[39:34] and we'll play out our part now brother
[39:36] brand said all those things typed him
[39:38] just in type but yet the mystery was hit
[39:42] that men didn't know what they were
[39:43] doing they only knew that they were led
[39:45] by the spirit to do something so when
[39:48] David said uh they pierced my hands and
[39:50] my feet he didn't know who he was
[39:52] talking about he thought he was talking
[39:54] about himself but yet that was actually
[39:57] speaking of Christ he said they only
[39:59] knew that they were led by the spirit to
[40:01] do something now holding it back in the
[40:03] last days for the great Revelation he
[40:06] said but expressed himself in Moses and
[40:08] David and Joseph and Elijah and on down
[40:11] through he said we could take each one
[40:12] of those prophets bring their lives out
[40:15] and show it express Jesus Christ
[40:17] perfectly
[40:19] exactly yet never giving his secret in
[40:23] full in full waiting to make it known in
[40:26] the last last days as he promised that's
[40:28] Daniel 12:9 seal up the book to the time
[40:31] of the end making it known in the last
[40:33] days as he promised waiting for it to be
[40:35] fully comprehended see before he could
[40:38] express it now look he said because the
[40:41] Bible is written in Mysteries Jesus
[40:43] thanked the father for it he said see
[40:45] that was root in Mysteries you can find
[40:47] that in Luke 10:21 we've read it many
[40:49] times he said I thank you that you've
[40:51] hid it from the wise and prudent
[40:52] revealed it to babes he said now the
[40:55] coming of the Lord is in mystery we
[40:56] don't know when he's coming how he's
[40:58] coming but we know he's coming yes he's
[41:02] and and remember everything else was
[41:04] revealed except for the moment of his
[41:07] coming but yet even that we're sealed
[41:09] away into the mystery of going brother
[41:11] BR calls it the mystery of going the
[41:13] mystery of the Rapture so we can't miss
[41:15] it even though we don't know it we're
[41:18] part of it yeah does that make sense we
[41:20] don't know what hour it's coming but we
[41:22] can't miss it because we're part of it
[41:25] we'll get to that a little bit more and
[41:27] just just a moment so he didn't give his
[41:29] mystery in full he said so is all the
[41:31] Mysteries so God waited for this last
[41:33] day he said after it's already been
[41:36] completed and he reveals and shows what
[41:38] he's done om my never gave his mystery
[41:42] in full so it's got to be completed
[41:44] first this is why brother brandom can't
[41:46] preach couldn't preach the Rapture
[41:48] message until the very end of his
[41:50] ministry when last few days of brother
[41:52] Bam's life is when he preached the
[41:54] Rapture message why because he was going
[41:56] to clear to us that that the shout of 1
[41:59] Thessalonians 4 was a
[42:02] message right the shout was the message
[42:04] he couldn't say that before the message
[42:07] came the message had to come and then he
[42:09] told us what it was so it was the shout
[42:12] of first Thessalonians 4 being the
[42:14] message was revealed and so he had to
[42:17] wait until the last hours of his life
[42:18] because that was God unfolding himself
[42:22] and revealing what he was doing during
[42:24] that time brother B talked about the
[42:26] seven seals is just like this comparing
[42:28] the Seven Seals he said now when God
[42:30] used Martin Luther for the coming out
[42:33] for that first church or that church age
[42:35] and when he used johon Wesley and he
[42:37] gradually brought them out was revealing
[42:39] in them that church age so he revealed
[42:42] the Lutheran age in Luther's life and in
[42:46] the life of those who followed him he
[42:48] revealed the Wesleyan age in Wesley's
[42:50] life and in the life of the followers
[42:52] what's he going to do today he revealed
[42:55] Oh my he revealed
[42:58] the he reveals the bride age in the
[43:02] bride right so he used John Wesley and
[43:05] he was revealing in them that church age
[43:08] he said when it goes back to the Bible
[43:10] now and find out he said but in the last
[43:11] days the reason that was such a
[43:13] tremendous thing that he spoke of and
[43:15] showed those seven Thunders he said Life
[43:18] Magazine look in Life Magazine pack that
[43:20] Circle of a cloud and light there that
[43:21] they could not understand and don't know
[43:23] it yet he said but here telling go there
[43:26] and wait for these Mysteries to could be
[43:27] revealed months before it happened it
[43:29] happened exactly the way he said it
[43:30] would do the significance of the cloud
[43:32] is what happened while brother Brandon
[43:34] was there and what is that what is that
[43:37] it was he he preached a message said is
[43:39] this the sign of the end sir is what
[43:43] what is revelation 10 was this text is
[43:46] revelation 10 is everybody with me so
[43:48] far tonight we're going to go through
[43:50] some little deep Waters then we're going
[43:51] to get to some application tonight but
[43:54] is this the sign of the ERS is what it's
[43:58] Revelation 10 the sign of the end yes it
[44:00] was God answered that that it was so he
[44:04] said it's the opening of the word is
[44:06] that is this the sign of the end is it's
[44:08] that the revelation of the seven
[44:10] Thunders which are the Mysteries
[44:11] contained in the seals is it a mighty
[44:14] Angel saying time will be no more and we
[44:16] can look back at that and say yes it was
[44:19] he talks about the angel in the picture
[44:21] he said coming down with his wings back
[44:22] his head sing sideways he said there it
[44:25] is in the picture just exactly months
[44:26] before happened told here that he's
[44:28] going to bring the body of Believers
[44:30] together to reveal take up them lost
[44:32] ends he said here come Luther through he
[44:34] only preached justification just pounded
[44:37] away in that age he didn't know what
[44:38] that let me let me stop there he didn't
[44:40] know what the age
[44:43] was right he had no clue that he was the
[44:45] sixth Church age messenger or the
[44:48] fifth the fifth Church age messenger he
[44:50] had no clue Right Wesley at no point did
[44:53] Wesley know that he was a church age
[44:55] messenger that's right he just did it he
[44:59] he just oh my church you just realized
[45:01] tonight that what what a blessing it is
[45:04] that we know who we are and we'll also
[45:07] perform and manifest who we
[45:09] are but they didn't know who they were
[45:12] he didn't know what the age was here
[45:13] come Wesley through and he pounded his
[45:15] age through he said a lot of outfalls
[45:17] come from it other churches raising up
[45:19] he said then here come Pentecost
[45:21] pounding away they organized went right
[45:23] back into death again so we'll get to it
[45:25] in a few minutes right back into death
[45:27] don't watch that right back into death
[45:29] because we're going to come back to
[45:30] death later in the sermon and so he
[45:33] talks about they went back into death
[45:35] what was death
[45:36] organization he said and then comes the
[45:38] revelation of the mystery to reveal what
[45:41] it's all been about he talked about the
[45:44] little doctrines that were left off of
[45:45] the preceding three messages one of the
[45:48] criticisms of this message is that they
[45:50] say brother brandom plagiarized brother
[45:52] brandom uh actually uh took other men's
[45:55] thoughts and put them all together
[45:57] together well that's exactly what he was
[45:58] supposed to
[46:00] do right to tie up the Loose
[46:02] Ends it's exactly it's it's it's not a
[46:05] criticism really it's a commendation of
[46:07] what he was supposed to do then come
[46:10] back in the last days and pick up all
[46:11] those Mysteries and clearly explain it
[46:13] and reveal it why it's the last days
[46:15] when this great mystery that God had in
[46:16] his heart is being revealed and he said
[46:19] do you get it and they said amen
[46:21] probably some of them said amen that
[46:22] didn't get
[46:24] it right but he said if you fail come
[46:26] back to the this tape again he said I
[46:28] don't know how much longer I'll be with
[46:30] you remember this is the truth thus
[46:33] sayith the truth it's the truth look how
[46:35] he qualifies it's the truth it's the
[46:39] scripture and 2 Timothy 3:16 tells us
[46:42] all scripture is God breathed God
[46:45] inspired now watch every message
[46:49] Doctrine has a scriptural Foundation it
[46:52] has to or it's not
[46:53] right so it has to have a scriptural
[46:56] Foundation
[46:57] so we know that if you if you say well I
[46:59] believe brother bandam taught this but
[47:00] it doesn't have a scriptural Foundation
[47:03] then you must misunderstand it in some
[47:06] way because if it's a teaching in a
[47:08] message I've never found and I challenge
[47:10] you you won't find a teaching in the
[47:12] message that doesn't have a scriptural
[47:13] Foundation it may be updated and give
[47:15] light for our day but it Bel but its
[47:18] foundation is in the
[47:20] scripture look and if you I say well if
[47:24] I I say well I don't understand how it's
[47:26] scriptural
[47:27] then I need to put it aside until I do
[47:29] understand it because there's something
[47:31] wrong with my understanding because he
[47:33] was a word Prophet now just because
[47:35] something is difficult to understand
[47:38] doesn't make it wrong right
[47:41] right are youall with me tonight just
[47:44] because something's difficult to
[47:45] understand doesn't make it wrong just
[47:46] because something impacts your life in a
[47:49] negative way or you think it's negative
[47:52] doesn't make it wrong right just because
[47:55] the word
[47:57] uh affects me in a negative way doesn't
[47:59] make it wrong we've got to be careful
[48:01] that we accept the word for what it is
[48:04] right and then apply it the way it's
[48:06] meant to be applied and not try to say
[48:08] well he must not Adit that because that
[48:10] that bothers me well there's lots of
[48:12] things about the word that bother me but
[48:13] I just want to live it I just want to
[48:15] become it Lord let me let me let me
[48:18] manifest it instead of reject
[48:20] it so I need to I need to just because
[48:23] it's difficult to understand doesn't
[48:25] make it wrong just me I can't understand
[48:27] it right you don't understand how well
[48:30] most of you probably don't understand
[48:31] how the bank banking system
[48:34] works right but Allen's throwing up his
[48:36] hands I mean I don't understand how it
[48:39] works I just know you put money in there
[48:41] and they keep it for you and you get it
[48:43] out you know and I don't know how all
[48:45] that works but I don't have to know how
[48:47] it works I just put the money in there
[48:50] just because it's difficult for me to
[48:52] understand doesn't make it
[48:54] wrong are you with me now right so
[48:57] that's what Peter said about Paul in his
[49:00] Epistles speaking in them of these
[49:01] things he said in which are some things
[49:03] hard to be understood which they that
[49:05] are unlearned and unstable rest or they
[49:08] they struggle with it as they do also
[49:10] the other scriptures unto their own
[49:11] destruction so we don't want to wrestle
[49:13] with it we just want to accept it and
[49:15] believe it what we want to wrestle
[49:17] through is our own flesh trying to to
[49:19] deny that it's the truth right so Jesus
[49:22] spoke things that were difficult to
[49:24] understand for the disciples he said eat
[49:25] my I Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and
[49:29] they and they looked at the law and said
[49:31] well there's no way that's not even
[49:33] legal right and he never explained it to
[49:36] him he just said it and then when he got
[49:39] done saying it they all begin to leave
[49:42] and he looks at the disciples he said
[49:43] will you go too are you also going to go
[49:47] and Simon Peter answered him something
[49:48] great he said Lord to whom shall we go
[49:51] you have the words of eternal life and I
[49:54] want to say tonight that Christ still
[49:56] has the words of eternal life this
[49:58] message is not from Jeffersonville it's
[50:00] not brother brandham and and about just
[50:02] about him this message is Christ this
[50:05] message come from heaven and so we
[50:08] believe it's Christ speaking he alone
[50:11] has the words of life but the brandom
[50:13] said like the seven Mysteries of the
[50:14] seven last seals the mysteries of them
[50:16] the seals had done been broken every age
[50:18] had come down there they left a lot of
[50:20] scattering and God not willing that it
[50:23] should be scattered he comes back and
[50:25] picks up those things those doctrines
[50:27] they started and brought it on out and
[50:29] revealed the whole thing the same thing
[50:31] he's doing now in revealing the mystery
[50:33] of Christ how he was God's three-fold
[50:35] purpose for the church he said Oh my he
[50:37] said letting him out and he said to
[50:39] reveal reveal Webster says is to make
[50:41] known and especially in Divine truth
[50:44] that Revelation means Revelation it is
[50:46] Christ's way of making himself known to
[50:49] his church the word uh Revelation is is
[50:52] an unveiling that's what that word means
[50:55] it's an unveiling he said ' now we're
[50:57] we're going to say now brother brandom
[50:59] you're just saying this he said ' now we
[51:00] won't just say this what's he going to
[51:02] do he's going to take it back to
[51:04] scripture he takes it back to Matthew 16
[51:07] that we read earlier Matthew 161
[51:11] 13-17 and he said I'll quote it he said
[51:13] when Jesus come from Mount
[51:15] Transfiguration he says who does man say
[51:16] that I the son of man am some says oh
[51:18] they think you're Elijah some says you
[51:20] one of the prophets Jeremiah but that
[51:22] wasn't what he asked he said who do you
[51:24] think that I am he said now there is the
[51:27] church that he's talking to what does
[51:29] man think that I am today he's a
[51:31] philosopher the social religion he was a
[51:34] good man I believe his teaching is right
[51:36] it's a subject to be lived by I think
[51:38] it'd make us all better if we did we to
[51:40] have our churches or or so forth he said
[51:42] that's Santa Claus like a Santa Claus
[51:44] story it's just a story he said it's not
[51:47] expressions of some church that we
[51:48] should Express something it's a life
[51:50] that you don't live yourself but he
[51:52] comes in you and lives by himself and
[51:56] you become a prisoner to any human
[51:58] intellectual being at all you're led by
[52:00] the spirit he said and how do you know
[52:03] he said now you say I might know I was
[52:04] losing my mind he said maybe a man that
[52:07] loses his mind does that he said but if
[52:08] you have the mind of Christ Christ
[52:10] expresses himself through you it shows
[52:13] that it's him and not that you've lost
[52:15] your mind he said some people under
[52:17] illusions of things goes out and becomes
[52:19] insane so he's going to the BR is going
[52:21] to lay out something that's very
[52:22] practical and very needed especially for
[52:26] those of us that are more emotional in
[52:27] our approach now watch he said it's he
[52:30] said he said some people comes out goes
[52:33] out and becomes insane he said well he
[52:35] said we know that's wrong that's the
[52:37] devil trying to impersonate the real
[52:39] thing before it gets here always bogus
[52:43] see we don't order our lives by
[52:45] impression by
[52:47] sensation by illusion or by emotion we
[52:52] order our steps by the word don't you
[52:54] want to be like David when he said order
[52:56] my steps by Your Word oh
[52:59] Lord that we don't lead Our Lives by all
[53:02] these other things the Holy Ghost leads
[53:04] us to the word brother Bron said a real
[53:08] man is to lose his own thoughts and his
[53:09] own thinking he said not come up blindly
[53:13] like that now watch how you approach God
[53:16] if you want healing if you need healing
[53:18] if you come in a prayer line if you come
[53:19] to be prayed for here at the front of
[53:20] the church you don't come up without
[53:22] your
[53:24] senses right you don't come up and say
[53:26] well I'm just going to leave my mind
[53:28] blank well anything could come in right
[53:30] you don't work yourself up into a frenzy
[53:34] right that's not how you come to God you
[53:36] come to God claiming the promises of God
[53:39] lord you said I could be healed you said
[53:42] I could be saved you said I could I
[53:44] could be delivered you said my family
[53:46] would be saved so you remind God of his
[53:47] promises and you say Lord you said if I
[53:50] called for the Elders of the church and
[53:51] they anointed me with oil I could be
[53:53] healed I would be healed so you remind
[53:56] God of his promise he's the one that
[53:59] made the promise and you come to God in
[54:01] your right mind he said with your right
[54:04] senses you come up with your right
[54:06] senses and Christ takes you over and
[54:09] expresses himself you don't have to
[54:11] clear out your mind to do that he just
[54:13] takes you over because you're you're
[54:15] coming in your right mind according to
[54:17] the word he said and now to the world
[54:20] now to the world you're an insane person
[54:22] he said now if you're insane you're
[54:23] actually insane there's nothing the
[54:25] devil can't take you and complete
[54:26] control he said he'll make you do
[54:28] everything contrary to the word I I know
[54:31] and I I've said this many times but a
[54:33] lot of things have been blamed on God
[54:35] but that's not God he gets to blame for
[54:38] a lot of things he doesn't do but if
[54:40] it's not according to the word it's not
[54:42] God doing
[54:43] it right but when Christ takes you over
[54:46] he said that's what I want tonight he'll
[54:48] Express that word right through you
[54:51] because it's him he is the word see and
[54:53] then you can see the expression of
[54:56] Christ not some illusion of some sort
[54:58] but a real genuine Christ expressing
[55:00] himself right through you yes he said
[55:03] how
[55:04] beautiful how beautiful now watch he
[55:07] said who do you say I am who do you say
[55:10] I am he's asking the church say 12 the
[55:13] millions of that day he asked 12 the
[55:16] millions in the days of Noah he asked
[55:18] eight he said as it was in the days of
[55:20] Noah so will be the coming of the son of
[55:22] man where eight Souls were saved he's
[55:24] asking us tonight who do you you say
[55:26] that I am what do you say about the
[55:28] message of the hour every one of us has
[55:30] to answer that question well I go to
[55:33] church I go to Word of Life Tabernacle
[55:34] brother Ben is my pastor that that may
[55:36] be true but it's not enough right we've
[55:39] got to answer the question what do we
[55:41] say who do we say he is do we say that
[55:45] he's able do we say he's sufficient do
[55:49] we say the message is right right do we
[55:52] say that the word says whatever the word
[55:53] says is true what do we say about about
[55:56] him yes amen is he the Christ or is it
[55:59] just another just another religion is
[56:02] this message Christ or is it just
[56:04] another teaching now look he said I
[56:07] don't now I don't say there's going to
[56:09] be eight saved now he said don't get
[56:10] that all wrong how many people have
[56:12] gotten that wrong I never said that he
[56:14] said I don't know how many is going to
[56:16] be saved and you know what that means we
[56:18] don't know how many is going to be
[56:20] saved I don't know how many's going to
[56:22] be saved in that last moment toture that
[56:24] little group he said it'll be small
[56:26] group I'll tell you that there Traders
[56:28] the gate narrow us the way but few there
[56:30] will be that find it when the Great
[56:32] Ransom body through all ages comes up
[56:34] that's going to be a great Throne there
[56:36] Revelation 7 expresses a great number
[56:38] which no man could number through all
[56:39] the ages has come up and has walked in
[56:41] the light of the Bible as far as it was
[56:43] revealed to them listen it's not how
[56:46] much light you have that makes you the
[56:48] bride right cuz Luther was Bride for his
[56:51] day Wesley was Bride for his day they
[56:54] didn't have the light that we have it's
[56:55] not how much light you have have it's
[56:57] how much you walk
[56:59] in right it's how much you walk in how
[57:01] you walk in the light you do have that's
[57:04] what that's what tells us that's what
[57:06] that's how you know that you're the
[57:07] bride because you you you respond to the
[57:10] light he said now we know that Wesley
[57:12] had more light than Luther did we know
[57:14] Pentecost outshine Wesley certainly it
[57:16] does because it just gradually let loose
[57:19] as it did down through the prophets and
[57:20] so forth till it was perfectly made
[57:22] known the godhead bodily in Christ and
[57:25] now the Christ in the church is just
[57:29] being made
[57:30] known the whole thing is the revelation
[57:33] of God to take Eve back to her right
[57:36] position again with her husband notice
[57:39] and God is the husband of the church the
[57:41] church is his bride now Peter when he
[57:43] called he said Thou Art the Christ the
[57:44] son of the Living God he said now watch
[57:46] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah he said
[57:49] Son of Jonah see blessed art thou for
[57:51] Flesh and Blood never revealed this to
[57:52] you you never learned it from some
[57:54] school but my father Father which is in
[57:57] heaven has revealed it to you notice
[58:00] what he said Upon This Rock I want you
[58:03] to I want us to catch this because I'm
[58:05] going to slow down we're going to quit
[58:06] reading we're just going to we're going
[58:08] to dwell on this for a minute okay he
[58:11] said Upon This Rock that's Peter the
[58:14] predestined seat of God that had
[58:16] received this light and given the keys
[58:17] to the kingdom Upon This Rock of
[58:21] Revelation he just said that's Peter but
[58:23] now he says Upon This Rock of revelation
[58:25] of who Jesus Christ is and that's what
[58:27] brother B always taught that was the
[58:29] rock it wasn't Peter it wasn't
[58:31] Christ right but he was the rock of
[58:33] Revelation he said he is the full
[58:35] manifested God Upon This Rock not of
[58:38] Father Son and Holy Ghost and him being
[58:39] the second person Upon This Rock I'll
[58:41] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[58:44] will never shake it down never Prevail
[58:48] against it I'll build my church Upon
[58:51] This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:55] now you might be a question in your mind
[58:57] why did brother bandam say that that's
[58:59] Peter the predestinated seat of God well
[59:02] Peter literally means a little Stone
[59:05] Little Rock right and that's why the
[59:07] Protestants most of or the Catholics
[59:09] rather believe that Peter was the rock
[59:11] the church was built on but you that you
[59:13] build a church on a man that's what you
[59:16] get right you get all that that man is
[59:18] and all of his mistakes this message
[59:21] isn't built on a man it's built on
[59:24] Christ and it has to you're whatever you
[59:26] believe has to be built on the Scripture
[59:29] it has to be built on the word the
[59:30] revealed word of the hour he said Upon
[59:33] This Rock of revelation of who Jesus
[59:34] Christ is he's the full manifested God
[59:39] but he calls Peter a rock now again
[59:42] Matthew 16:18 I say also unto thee that
[59:44] thou art Peter the word there is Petros
[59:48] Petros A Little Rock and Upon This Rock
[59:52] a different word Patra which means a big
[59:55] rock I will build my church and the
[59:58] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:00:01] it two words for rock Peter's Little
[1:00:03] Rock Petra is large Rock I'm going to
[1:00:06] build my church he says on the
[1:00:08] revelation of who I am but what's he
[1:00:11] telling Peter by naming him Peter he's
[1:00:13] saying you're a chip off the old
[1:00:15] block right you've heard that expression
[1:00:18] what is he saying that's what his name
[1:00:20] literally means a chip off of a larger
[1:00:22] Rock and he said the Revelation is the
[1:00:25] larger your rock and you're the chip off
[1:00:28] of it what that means is that you're a
[1:00:30] part of the
[1:00:32] Revelation yeah right and that's why you
[1:00:35] can't leave that's why you can't quit
[1:00:37] that's why the devil's done his worst
[1:00:38] and you can't give up why because you're
[1:00:40] part of the Revelation you you've been
[1:00:43] called a part of a part of him said
[1:00:47] Peter you're a little rock but the
[1:00:49] Revelation is the big rock I'm going to
[1:00:51] build my church on that revelation of
[1:00:53] who I am you're a part of that
[1:00:56] Revelation I want you to watch now
[1:00:58] brother brandom this is just continuing
[1:01:00] just two more paragraphs here one more
[1:01:02] paragraph about about this same subject
[1:01:07] in Christ is Mystery of God revealed
[1:01:08] brother brand said look Christ in you
[1:01:12] makes him the center of life of the
[1:01:15] Revelation Christ's life in you makes
[1:01:17] him the center of the
[1:01:18] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:01:22] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:01:25] now watch
[1:01:26] Christ in you makes
[1:01:29] you someone say
[1:01:32] me huh makes
[1:01:37] you I wish we could realize what we are
[1:01:39] and who we are but see there's a problem
[1:01:42] you're looking at what you've
[1:01:44] done right you're looking at what you've
[1:01:46] done but we're not talking about what
[1:01:48] you've done we're talking about who you
[1:01:51] are right because there's three parts to
[1:01:54] you
[1:01:55] on the outside you got a flesh that's
[1:01:57] always going to fail always has
[1:02:00] failed brother Ben I'm so shocked that I
[1:02:02] failed in my flesh well that's what it
[1:02:05] does you just need more of Christ to
[1:02:09] come in and overwhelm that and overcome
[1:02:11] that and take over that flesh it's no
[1:02:14] shock when the flesh fails the flesh
[1:02:16] that's what the flesh does even Paul the
[1:02:18] Apostle cried out oh Wretched Man that I
[1:02:21] am but it's hard to see what he is when
[1:02:24] you're looking at what you are are but
[1:02:26] you got to look be able to look Beyond
[1:02:28] this you got to be able to look beyond
[1:02:30] the man in the mirror to be able to see
[1:02:33] there's Christ yeah you realize you have
[1:02:35] to be able to look Beyond me to be able
[1:02:37] to see that there's a preacher preaching
[1:02:38] the word you got to be able to look
[1:02:40] beyond your wife to be able to see
[1:02:42] there's a woman of God a child of God a
[1:02:44] daughter of God you got to be able to
[1:02:45] look beyond your husband to see there's
[1:02:46] a Son of God you got to be able to look
[1:02:48] beyond the flesh to see your brothers
[1:02:50] and sisters as children of God because
[1:02:52] they will make mistakes they will do
[1:02:54] things that are wrong
[1:02:57] absolutely they will but I'm so glad for
[1:02:59] the grace of God that even in my worst
[1:03:02] moments brother Harvey that word always
[1:03:04] called to me that word always grabbed a
[1:03:07] hold of my heart even in my worst
[1:03:09] moments for he he grabbed a hold of me
[1:03:12] made me who I am and if there's a pull
[1:03:14] in your heart don't you give up and
[1:03:16] begin to look at what you were look at
[1:03:17] who he is Christ in you makes you the
[1:03:21] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:03:24] that's what God wants to do he said
[1:03:26] that's what God is trying to do make you
[1:03:29] the complete revelation of who he is in
[1:03:33] the world today his hidden purpose
[1:03:37] revealed in you and me the purpose he
[1:03:38] spoke about in Colossians 1:26 even the
[1:03:40] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[1:03:42] from Generations now is made manifest to
[1:03:45] his Saints whom God would make known
[1:03:47] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:03:49] mystery in you which this mystery among
[1:03:52] the Gentiles which is Christ in you the
[1:03:54] hope of glory yes right amen I love that
[1:03:59] what else did he tell
[1:04:00] Peter he said he said you are Peter
[1:04:05] you're a chip off the old
[1:04:07] block Peter needed that didn't he he's
[1:04:11] about to go through some things he's
[1:04:13] about to deny
[1:04:15] Christ he's about to say I message you
[1:04:17] nothing to it what it would be like
[1:04:22] today don't give up on your kids CU they
[1:04:24] say there's nothing to the message
[1:04:25] because they may be like Peter they just
[1:04:28] need the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost Peter just needed to be converted
[1:04:33] right and and Jesus said not when not if
[1:04:37] but when you're converted strengthen
[1:04:39] your
[1:04:41] brethren so the devil wants to have you
[1:04:43] he said he'd like to sift you like wheat
[1:04:44] but I prayed for you yeah all right amen
[1:04:48] I love that he prayed for us too he said
[1:04:51] those that will hear by their word and
[1:04:53] when when they're converted when you're
[1:04:55] converted he said strengthen your
[1:04:56] brethren but look what did he tell him
[1:04:58] he said you're Peter you're chip off the
[1:05:00] old block and and Upon This Rock of
[1:05:03] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:05:06] Gates of Hell won't Prevail against it
[1:05:09] well I get to thinking about that and
[1:05:11] what is the gates of
[1:05:13] hell now brother Brandon told us over
[1:05:16] and over again he said the Gates of Hell
[1:05:17] will not Prevail he said it showed us
[1:05:19] that the gates of hell would be against
[1:05:21] it but it wouldn't be able to stop it
[1:05:25] and he talked about the Gates of Hell be
[1:05:26] an organization you remember earlier in
[1:05:28] this he said every time it organized it
[1:05:30] died yeah right death was there when
[1:05:33] Whenever there was an organization and
[1:05:36] and so he said the gates of hell would
[1:05:38] not Prevail he said organization would
[1:05:40] not be able to stop the bride right
[1:05:42] trouble would not be able to stop the
[1:05:44] bride whatever is released out of the
[1:05:46] entrances of hell would not be able to
[1:05:48] stop the bride but I got to thinking
[1:05:49] about that and I realized that the Gates
[1:05:53] of Hell quite literally is death now
[1:05:57] think about it for a minute it's death
[1:06:00] that's the gate or the entrance to hell
[1:06:02] it's death and and it shows us now that
[1:06:07] now if you have a gate of something it's
[1:06:10] either holding you
[1:06:11] in right from getting out somewhere or
[1:06:15] it's keeping you back from entering
[1:06:17] in right and but what it means is if you
[1:06:20] come against the gate it means the
[1:06:22] person behind the gate the person
[1:06:24] operating the gate is on
[1:06:26] defense think about that for a minute he
[1:06:29] said the gates of hell would not Prevail
[1:06:32] against you what it means is the bride
[1:06:34] the church is going to be on offense not
[1:06:37] on
[1:06:38] defense and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:06:41] Prevail against you when you come
[1:06:43] against it because there's something in
[1:06:45] you that's coming against hell that's
[1:06:47] coming against death and when what this
[1:06:50] Revelation means to us church here at
[1:06:52] the end time and I'm closing in just a
[1:06:53] moment but what it means to us is that
[1:06:55] death itself yes sir will not be able to
[1:06:58] hold
[1:07:00] us oh my sir we know he conquer death in
[1:07:04] his body but one day he's going to
[1:07:07] conquer death in our
[1:07:10] bodies
[1:07:12] right yes sir well that's the truth
[1:07:14] whether by Rapture or Resurrection he's
[1:07:16] going to conquer death in our
[1:07:19] bodies now I'm not going out on a limb
[1:07:23] here if you go back and I don't have
[1:07:24] time to teach it all tonight but if you
[1:07:25] go back you'll find brother brandom had
[1:07:27] a vision of a Mamba you remember that I
[1:07:29] preached about it here before he said it
[1:07:31] was a black snake it meant he said it
[1:07:33] was from Africa he say the the darkest
[1:07:35] snake that there ever was the the worst
[1:07:37] snake that there ever was and it meant
[1:07:40] death yeah it meant death and and in
[1:07:44] being that this Mamba which which is the
[1:07:46] most the deadliest snake I saw the other
[1:07:48] day I was looking through snake bite
[1:07:50] victims because we saw Copperhead at
[1:07:52] Mom's house so I was uh I was letting
[1:07:55] her know all had died of copperhead
[1:07:56] bites you know and cuz that's my job to
[1:07:59] do as a
[1:08:00] son saw this little baby copperhead at
[1:08:02] Mom's house so and we never did find it
[1:08:04] it crawled up under there somewhere but
[1:08:07] you know I was looking at copperhead
[1:08:08] bites and there was a person in the US
[1:08:10] killed by a Mamba how in the world does
[1:08:12] that happen well cuz he was handling
[1:08:15] it he he play was playing with it so you
[1:08:18] know he had to possess it and play with
[1:08:20] it if it's if it's in Africa leave it in
[1:08:22] Africa and let it do what it does over
[1:08:25] there but don't bring it over here but
[1:08:27] we got bad enough trouble with the
[1:08:28] Copperheads and things like that but
[1:08:31] brother brandom taught us that that
[1:08:32] Mamba was death right and when he spoke
[1:08:34] to it he gave him power to bind it and
[1:08:37] to unbind it what did he tell Peter I
[1:08:39] give you the Keys of the Kingdom of
[1:08:41] Heaven power to bind and to unbind and
[1:08:44] what did what did Brother brand say
[1:08:45] about the Mamba death he said I give you
[1:08:48] power to bind it and he bound it he said
[1:08:49] it crystallized turned like to Glass he
[1:08:53] said just so you know you have it I give
[1:08:54] you power to unbind it he Unbound it and
[1:08:56] it come back a snake again and then he
[1:08:58] bound it again and so what what was it
[1:09:01] he was showing him that death would be
[1:09:03] defeated by the message of the
[1:09:06] hour oh my now brother B taught us that
[1:09:09] the devil does have a power he said that
[1:09:11] that power is death yeah and after death
[1:09:14] the devil can do no more he's finished
[1:09:17] at death right yeah do you realize what
[1:09:20] it means when the Gates of Hell will not
[1:09:21] Prevail against you if death cannot
[1:09:23] Prevail against you nothing else can
[1:09:25] Prevail against you when he killed that
[1:09:28] Mamba you realize what happened he said
[1:09:30] it made an and sign in the air he said
[1:09:32] it meant that and everything under it
[1:09:34] was
[1:09:35] defeated oh Church death and everything
[1:09:38] under it was defeated oh what that ought
[1:09:40] to mean to us is Christians today death
[1:09:42] and everything under death so think
[1:09:44] about whatever problem you're facing
[1:09:46] everything under death has been defeated
[1:09:50] listen Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:26
[1:09:53] The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed
[1:09:54] is death behold I show you a mystery we
[1:09:56] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:09:58] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:10:00] an eye what is he saying this is how
[1:10:02] death is going to be destroyed at the
[1:10:04] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[1:10:06] and the dead shall be raised
[1:10:07] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:10:10] for this corruptible must put on
[1:10:12] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[1:10:14] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:10:16] shall have put on incorruption this
[1:10:18] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:10:19] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:10:21] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:10:24] Victory
[1:10:25] I I love to go back and see when Paul
[1:10:27] references an Old Testament scripture I
[1:10:29] love to go back and see it Isaiah 258 is
[1:10:32] the saying that he's referencing he said
[1:10:34] he will swallow up death in Victory and
[1:10:38] the Lord God will wipe away tears from
[1:10:41] off all faces and the rebuke of his
[1:10:44] people shall he take away from off all
[1:10:46] the Earth for the Lord has spoken
[1:10:50] him death will be defeated in these
[1:10:54] mortal
[1:10:56] bodies then won't lust be
[1:11:00] defeated huh won't won't ungodliness be
[1:11:04] defeated in these mortal bodies you say

[1:11:09] just keep feeding on the word you keep
[1:11:11] getting closer to God it'll be defeated
[1:11:14] sickness will be defeated everything
[1:11:15] under death is
[1:11:18] defeated because the rebuke of his
[1:11:20] people will be taken off the Earth
