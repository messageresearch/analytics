commit this service into your hands and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah psalm 16 and5 we're going to read Psalm 165 through 11 it's good to be back this morning in the presence of the Lord have all of our friends here with us Psalm 165 get right in the word because I've got just a little bit on our plate this morning says the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou maintain my lot lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yeah I have a goodly Heritage he said I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for thou wil not leave my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to seek corruption thou will show me the path of Life a presence is fullness of joy at the right hand there are Pleasures forever more I want to continue speaking this morning on building the individual building you going talk this morning about the path of life you may be seated there's a passage in the book Pilgrims Progress where Pilgrim is uh continuing on his journey and there's a uh two companions with him mistrust and timorous and as they are going ahead of him he sees them running back just as hard as they can go and in seeing that he he realizes there must be a danger ahead so he begins to look carefully and as he looks he sees two lions by the road and he says well that must be why that they're returning with such haste and and he began to be afraid and and he thought well maybe I need to turn back maybe I need to run at this time because there's lions in the way he thought nothing but death was before him but there was a porter at the lodge that uh of the town that the uh Road was going to and his name was watchful and watchful uh saw that Christian was about to make a halt and and he cried out to him and he said is thy strength so small fear not the Lions for they are chained fear not the Lions for they are chained and are placed there for a trial of Faith where it is and for discovery of those who have none he said keep in the midst of the path and no hurt shall come unto thee and as he begin to get closer and he begin to take to the directions of the porter he heard the Lion's Roar but they did him no harm because they were actually chained to the side to the gate they were unable to get in the middle of the road and I want to to tell you and as we begun this series of of sermons on the individual and how God deals with the individual I want you to understand that the Lions have been chained the the the the Troubles of Life the struggles the things that you look at and say well I'll never be able to overcome that I'll never be able to meet that challenge and you recognize the lions are chained you just got to stay in the word don't go outside the word do what the word says do stay in the word don't trust emotion don't trust sensation don't trust what the world says about it don't even trust what your neighbor says about it or your friend or your family member you trust the word of God because there's a porter crying out stay in the middle of the road I believe we had one in this age I believe we had a prophet who spoke out and he said stay in the middle of the road I want to Echo that this morning brother Stuart I want to say stay in the middle of the road the Lions cannot get you as long as you stay in the middle of the word yes sir yes amen so we find that our path is surrounded it's surrounded We Know by enemies but but David said my path is surrounded by you Lord he said you you you've encompassed my path you're you beset me behind and before and we read last week and the week before where he said if I make my bed in hell you're there if I fly with the wings of the morning you're there wherever I am in my life you're there that ought to make us excited this morning it ought to do something brother Kevin and our hearts to know that he's with us no matter what we're going through in life he was with you he he saw you he knew you before you ever knew him before you ever wanted him he already knew what you would be and so we found that our path is arrested by his grace I'm so glad for that today from beginning to end we're all swallowed up by Providence right we we found that the system is rigged yeah all right right not against us but for us sir come on I wish I could get that through to you this morning the system is rigged but it's not rigged against you it's rigged for you and if you'll just stay with the word you'll find in your life that everything happens for your benefit to those who love God those who are the called according to his purpose everything happens for a reason the system is not rigged against you it is not that everybody's out to get you the pastor is not out to get you the church is not out to get you the world's not out to get you in that sense but even your enemies are put there for a purpose and even like David said when the man threw a stone at him when he was leaving Jerusalem and everything seemed to be going wrong and he said maybe the Lord told him to do that if we could only get a revelation of that in our lives we'd understand that it it's not their fault you say but I got enemies I got people that are against me it's not their fault it's not because that they want something bad for you God allowed them to do that for a reason it's to bring you to a place where you ought to be in him yes the system is rigged for you all right oh my oh my you know if you knew I don't believe in playing the lottery so let's just get that out of the way but if you knew right that the system was riged and you went down to play the lottery at the gas station you would you wouldn't mind spending your money but see the problem with the lottery is the system's rigged against you right the system is rigged against you but the system if you think about it the economic system the the path of life that you've been set on is actually rigged in your favor yeah but it's not just rigged and see the reason we can't recognize that is it's not just our in our material favor or in our uh in our favor the way we want it or it's not wishful thinking it's not it's not health wealth and prosperity but it's actually uh rigged in such a way if I could use that word we're talking about the Providence of God the system is actually set up in such a way that actually God allowed this to be Satan's Eden he allowed this to be the time that you lived in he put you here on this Earth at this time for a reason he put you in the church that you're in put you in in the marriage that you're in put you in the situation that you're in put you in the job that you're in you don't even understand that I don't even comprehend that but he did it anyway but it's not always because it's just like if God gives you a job it doesn't mean it'll be easy right that's right if God puts you in a church it doesn't mean things will go easy yeah and things will go smooth it might it might not go smooth it might not but there's got to be some re realization in Your Heart Lord I know you put me here for a reason I know I'm doing this in my life for a reason the sister is rigged for me I'm a son or daughter of God I I I'm bigger if you can say it this way I'm too big to fail amen I'm to you remember back in the financial crisis in 2008 when GM they said what would happen if GM fa the economy will crash so the government just pump money into them because they said they're too big to fail you're too big to fail God's not going to let you fail come on but you don't always understand what success looks like right and so you think success success is getting what you want when actually success might be might be recognizing that the lions are chained but it's going to be tough but you're going to make it if you're going to have to sweat but you're going to make it you're going to it life might be hard but you're going to make it good are you with me so far now you say well I was born and poor maybe I was born jeans as we talked about last week that make me a certain way maybe maybe I'm big or little or ugly or beautiful that can be a curse too for to some people and I was born that way and it's just been my lot in life my my portion in life to be that way and say that that's against me but it's not right it's actually for you it's for you and comprehending that is what will make you settled but the B said it takes away the fear and the scare to know that you're elected by God yes now look what David said in psalm 16 we're going to just really dig into this Psalm we believe it's the word of God don't we how many believe the word of God is infallible the word of God is infallible what that means is it can't be wrong right right so it's always going to be right Psalm 16:5 the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup he said thou maintain my lot so he's telling us that the Lord is the portion in the Hebrew that that's a a word called meth which is a person's allotment what is given to a person in life he's saying to he's saying the Lord is my portion so uh my portion may not be what others portion are my portion or my cup is those circumstances of Life those things which have conspired to make me who I am those things which have uh genes plus the nature plus the nurture all the things that have come together to make me who I am he said you have actually uh determine that and not only determine that but you are my portion so he's saying even if I'm poorer than somebody else you're my portion even if I don't have uh all the talent that somebody else has you're my portion even if everybody else might get along better in life even if I might have been born with a disability or or some kind of a a disadvantage compared to other people but you're my portion Amen on so there's some reason for it there's something that that you've given me to do and as I think of Fanny Crosby he wrote many songs with Blessed assurance Jesus is mine and what a but she she had a a blindness that happened to her at a young age and and because she was blind they said well uh maybe that maybe maybe God could give you healing and she said if go if I was offered healing today I wouldn't accept it because she understood that uh that there was something about her life that was she was meant to be blind yeah do that makes sense and and you say well that's hard for me to understand and I believe God's A Healer God always wants to heal us don't get me wrong but there are things that are in your life for a reason yes because God glorified himself in her as a blind person in a way that he couldn't have if she had her sight right right and so he said the Lord is my portion you maintain my lot so now he's saying you're sufficient to meet all my needs now we know in the Bible we're taught that the ability to to accept one's portion in life is a gift of God Paul tells us be content in whatever state you find yourself in and it would it would do us a lot of good if we weren't always concerned about what tomorrow and what we're going to be but what is our portion today what has God given us and be content with that and be happy with what God has given us Ecclesiastes 5:18 it says behold that which I have seen it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh Under the Sun all the days of his life which God giveth him for it is his portion he said again every man also to whom God ha given riches and wealth and ha given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion to rejoice in his labor this is the gift of God so you find some people are never happy never satisfied even though God's given them a good job they've given a good family but they're just never happy and so they get themselves out of the will of God because they're unable to really accept what God's done for them what that he's given them their portion the portion that God gave you might have been kids that are healthy and you ought to thank God for that because not every child is healthy the portion that God gave you might be a family that serves God you ought to thank God for that he said but we don't have much money but you ought to thank God anyway because God is your portion or you might have Financial Resources you're looking over these other people say well they don't have health problems but they but they don't have money either right everybody's got something everybody's got a portion everybody's got a cup they've got a drink from oh my let me let me be satisfied with the portion God has given me that's good so he is my portion and David goes on in verse six to say the lions are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places he said yay I have a goodly Heritage I think this way we ought to look at life a goodly Heritage in other words now he's referencing Joshua and and the placing of the children of Israel in the land lines have fallen to me in other words it uh you know everybody got a part but my part's good for me yeah right everybody got a portion of the land but my portion of the land is exactly what I needed yeah well I wonder how many people could testify this morning everybody got something they got to do in life everybody's got something that some burden that they carry everybody's got some issues in their life but the things that God has allowed me to carry and the things God has allowed me to do was good for me yes yes but that's hard for me to understand but been because the things that I've done have been hard but I think we ought to pray like and I'm I'm getting away from my not this morning but I just feel like preaching I feel like you're listening and and we I've talked to you before about Caleb's daughter you remember Caleb's daughter was one who was given a Southland in other words she was given a part of the ngev desert which was all the way in the very south part of the land and it was a part had no water on it was just desert so she asked for a land and she was given a Southland and she went to her father and she didn't say change the land that you've given me but what she told him she come to him and she said give me also Springs of water give me Springs of water if you've given me a South Land If you give me a dry land if I've had got a hard lot in life let me have your spirit on it let me let me be anointed by your spirit let me be able to worship you anyway let me be able to praise you anyway even though my lot in life might be difficult but but you love me I know you love me you wouldn't have put me there for no reason so let me Praise You In The Storm let me worship you in the desert David I want you to understand that David knew this because he wasn't he didn't move to bethle think about it he was born there right he was born he said the lines have fallen to me excuse me in Pleasant places I want us to think spiritually for a moment David didn't move to Bethlehem he was born there you were born naturally where you were for a reason brother Bram said like he said there's many kinds of Hills like many kinds of rivers Springs Lakes he said they were here when you come here first because the kindness of your heavenly father placed them here because some men likes mountains some men likes Waters some likes deserts I don't know why but I guess some do he said so you see you're coming he knew your nature and what you would be he said so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it yeah he said oh I think that's a wonderful father see he know that he made it like this I'm I'm thankful and and then you'd say well this is a little thing but I'm thankful that God put me in the area that he put me in because I've lived in different parts of of Missouri and Arkansas and even North Texas and I've lived in in in places that I didn't like and and I do like the place where I'm at now but I think God has a way of orchestrating that doesn't he he has a way of putting you in a place that fits you right he's got there's something about you that it just fits you amen and so you you don't fit just anywhere but he made it just the way that you could enjoy it he said oh I think that's a wonderful father see he he know that he made it like this he said I'm glad he made mountains I like the mountains and he said where others say oh I can't stand oh he must have emptied his morar box out there he said well he emptied it out so I could enjoy it you see he says then I didn't say I like the PLS where I can see a long way well the two different Natures both of us Christians i' mentioned my grandfather before my grandfather loved uh loved the Wide Open Spaces he thought syon Missouri was the the pearl of the US uh of the US down in there he just loveed that bottom land CU Rich farmland and I didn't like that I like the hills the mountain God made me different for a specific purpose and a spe oh Church don't you realize he loves you today and he made you even naturally to be where you were supposed to be he said the two different Natures both of us Christians but the father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here your first coming here he had it ready for you when you got here amen oh I love that I love maybe you were somewhere where it didn't really fit but then something happened you said well it was just my job it was just this that or the other I changed I did this or I moved here but then you found yourself in a place where you could worship and you could praise God what was it it was God orchestrating your life yeah he chose your path of life and that's why we shouldn't always look let me just say this we shouldn't always choose based on what what's good or what appears to be good for us because God knows what's good for us right right and sometimes what appears good right now might not be good tomorrow so we don't choose what church to go to based on what church is bigger or what church is smaller what church has this that or the other we choose based on Lord where would you want me to be where where where can I get my soul fed and and so you do that you don't choose you don't choose who to marry based on uh uh based on some idea of perfect this this would be the perfect husband but you do it Lord what would you have me who would you have me to marry what there's a there's a path of life there's something God has chosen for you and it will never be against the word you will not have to break the word to do the will of God right you never have to so he chose your path of life he chose the place and time of your birth both naturally and spiritually now brother so when the mothers and them Hebrew women in labor give an utterance to those children being born it placed their name it told their birth it put them in the Homeland it set set them over to Eternity I love that it set them all the way over to Eternity he said then watch Jacob when he was dying there when he laid his hands on the Patriarchs and bless them he'd tell them exactly where they would be he said and that's exactly according to their name exactly according to their birth and sure it has something to do with you he said no that's your birth path he even talked about the heavens and the stars and different things like that he said that's your birth path that's what you are a natural man or natural woman he said but when you're reborn again he said that's not the outside conscience the outside is what you see taste feel smelling here but the inside of that is what you really are right right he said now this out here Satan just temps you and knocks you around every way here he said but down here he can't do it come on all right unless you let him do it right so now watch he said for in here you've got faith and Faith don't come from the outer conscience it reasons but in faith there's no reason he said you've got it from God you know it's there I don't care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right it's just sayth the Lord look we're talking about the word we're not talking about your emotions your feelings anything else but if the word says it it's thus sayith the Lord even if it looks wrong come on now yes sir it's thus sayith the Lord he said there's nothing going to bother that nothing can bother that it's moving right straight on difficulty means nothing to it it waits right on through it for it's the word yes right now where is the place of your spiritual birth where were you born now think about it you say well I was born in born again at Camp I was born again at the altar I was born again in Hardy that's not what he's asking where is the place of your spiritual birth you were born in Christ good right you were born in Christ no matter what Ministry it was no matter what time it was no matter what uh what was going on what song was being sung what what sermon was being preached you were born in Christ yes and so the place of your spiritual birth is is literally the bread of God John 6:35 Jesus said unto me I am the bread unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst so brother BR said if Christ had to become the bread of life to be born in Bethlehem which is life's bread house and every one of True Believers in Christ is born in Christ everyone so where were you born this morning you were born in Christ and if you're born in Christ you're born in God's Bethlehem yes he said that not only Jesus was born in Bethlehem he said I was born in Bethlehem you were born in Bethlehem sir so if you're born in Bethlehem with him listen you have Bethlehem potentials all right now remember in the Old Testament you couldn't just do like you do today and choose a career but where you were born and what tribe you were born into told what you were going to do y and what your nature would be right and what you would be like come on now right so if you were born into a city of Benjamin say your your nature was warlike right we went went through that with the Tribe of Benjamin how that they were warlike and and they they they were left-handed and they could they could use a sling yeah right so that was their nature was war they had that nature and there were certain ones born for certain things so if you were a bethlehemite you had potentials that people born in Jerusalem people born any other siloh any other City didn't have because they had the potentials of being born in a place that where there was a prophecy that was given that this is where the Messiah would come from I hope you're thinking deep this morning this is where the Messiah would come from was Bethlehem so Jesus had to be born in Bethlehem you remember they even had the tax and everything else so Jesus would be born in Bethlehem he had to be born in Bethlehem why did he have to be born in Bethlehem because that was the prophesied place for the Messiah to come from let me tell you this morning some can be born in Baptist they could be born Methodist they could be born Pentecostal but I was born in the word which means I have the potential of a messiah anointing on my life come on are you hearing me this morning only Bethlehem dwellers had the potential to be the Messiah oh I hope you hear me today only those born in Bethlehem had the potential to be the Messiah and only those born in Christ have the potential to be Messiah s good yes sir oh that ought to make a Baptist sh well it wouldn't but anyway oh but we understand don't we yeah you know what I'm talking about now John 14:12 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me oh it's fixing to get good here in a minute he said the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I going to my father look look brother B typed him to Papa Eagle he said he is Papa eagle and we are eaglets he is Messiah we are Messiahs he said now we find out he calls himself Eagle too he said he's Jehovah Eagle then he's got a bunch of eaglets a bunch of eaglets he said like Messiah eaglets he said I can see the big father Eagle as he's walking around over the nest he loves to look at his children he loves to look at it you still believe he does today he loves to look at his children oh my how he loves to look at them how do they look they look just like he does all right he said they're not hybrid they're not half buzzard and half Crow something else they're Eagles yes right so he looks at his children gathered together in party on a Sunday morning wherever they're gathered together around the world on a Sunday morning he looks at his Eagles gathered together and he looks at them and says they look like me they're feathers look like me their beaks look like me their attitudes look like me they don't go outside the work they stay right in the middle of the road they look like me amen they worship like me they do the works that I do they they do everything like I do yeah are you with me now they're Eagles yes they're not half buzzard and half Crow they're e Eagles you'll look down there and say well here's an eagle and here's a a CR Buzzard card and there's a crow that's a new one laugh at me Riley you GNA come up here and try it sometime you not looking around there see a bunch of little strange looking birds yeah you know what makes you a strange looking bird when you don't follow the word but if you're a an eagle you follow the word your diet is the word and you're producing something something of the word in your life little eaglet excuse me little eaglet he said oh how proud he is he said he likes he knows that they is thorough bread they got his flesh they got his blood they got his Spirit he said how proud he looks over his eaglets walking around oh Hallelujah I believe God's proud of you today if you're a born again Christian today I believe he's proud of you I'll say this if you're not a born again Christian but you got to see down in your heart some desire to serve God I believe he wants to be proud of you he wants to look at you he said what will that take it'll take you to be reborn yeah when you're reborn your nature changes you won't be resistant to the word but you'll love the word wonderful he said how proud he looks over his Eagles to the little eagles look at him and say how great thou art oh if I was looking at a great eagle and he was up there and I was a little Eagle little little Eagle that haven't fully developed yet but I'm just looking up from the nas looking up from the ground where I'm at I look up there here's this great Eagle eagle flying over I would begin to scream out oh how great thou art it would all me with this Majesty I don't think we have enough sense of the presence of An Almighty God I don't think we recognize how great he is and what he's done in our life for the game when we can look up that's what we ought to be doing this morning we look up from our troubles look up from our cares look up from the things we're going through and say God you're worthy of my praise you're worthy of you're worthy of everything I can give you I I I would never want to go to church with a bad itude because he's worthy of my praise I would never want to I would never want to cut short my time in the presence of God he's worthy of my praise yes oh do you believe it this morning hey man how great thou art he said look at myself oh I love it oh my going to take a flight one of these days ain't we Papa Oh my he said oh how he likes to look at them they look like him they act like him they're his flesh his blood his Spirit he just suppos to look at them you ever done that when you're a father I know most of you probably have done that you walk into the room you look down there and there's there's little Justin laying there right you can see them or you imagine you do anyway you know looks like me it looks like me got my whenever they act right it got my attitude you know whenever they act wrong that's your kid they look like me they look like him oh my I want him to be able to do that I want him to be able to walk down when I'm asleep I want him to be able to walk down when I'm whatever it is I'm doing in life what what what I'm when I'm as a pastor working when I'm with my family and we're doing something I want him to be able to look and say oh it looks like me it looks like me what about you this morning it looks like me he said they look like him they act like him they are his flesh his blood his Spirit he said the way God's church is his eaglets his Messiah they look like him they act like him they preach like him right they preach like him I know they're trying to do away with preaching today he said they preach like him amen they preach like him they do the works that he did he said what if he looked down at one of them little Eagles the first thing you know he had a bill like a buzzard all right he' said now wait a minute here there's something wrong yeah Old Crow jumped up on the nest began to say call call call the days of Miracles has passed call call call there's no such thing as Divine Healing he said ha he said I bet he'd just take his big paw and OU him right out if an eagle had a paw he'd break his neck sounds harsh don't it that's right he don't belong with the Eagles yeah he'd break his neck just as sure as the world oh he said there's no that's mental telepathy no such thing as them things these days he said you Buzzard of the flesh that's dead flesh too that's harsh isn't it it's truth though he said God wants eaget he wants the Messiah hats he wants men and women to have signs and wonders anointed ones come on that don't mean you're going to be jumping around running all over the church all the time I it's wonderful if you want to do that you have my blessing but that's not what he's talking about you could do that and be in the flesh but he wants a church with an anointed on who are anointed to do what God has ordained them to do in the hour that they live in yeah he wants a church is filled with the Holy Ghost you believe he wants that this morning a church reflecting him the same yesterday today and forever he said God didn't die just born the kingdom got his Messiah it's in it every word he says they say Amen to it every word he says they say Amen to it aren't you glad you can do that today every word he says they say Amen to it he said God wants eaglet amen he said they look like him he said they believe it they got the conductor moving right on out with signs and wonders following amen you believe that's what you are you were born in Bethlehem you have bethle him potentials that's good well the world's conspir against me oh God conspired for you back part of his mind Before Time began there was a conspiracy all right you want to believe a conspiracy theory believe that God conspired for me then why wouldn't I want to just let every area of my life just conform to his word yes because he has already laid it all out right that's all I can do now look at verse seven David said he's given me counsel he said I'll bless the Lord who have given me counsel he said my Reigns also instruct me we found out the Reigns was the actually the the DNA and your spiritual DNA is the word yeah right it's coded in there's information there and it's the word speaking back to the word so he says the Rand said the word speaks to the word when when you were born again it was the word coming to the word because the word had to be awakened in your life now he he didn't just leave me without instructions he's given me counsel yeah even the Bible says that the Holy Spirit helps our infirmities we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make its intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered yes and I don't think we could ever be too arrogant about knowing what's going to happen in our life because we don't even know how we should pray but but he does yes he does so we look at that and we begin to think well how do I know that the voice that's speaking to me this voice of the inward man this counsel that's coming from the inner man how do I know it's right because you can have lots of things that seem like God speaking and lots of people say God spoke and how do I know that that it's right well it'll be according to the word the Bible says in Psalms 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path one Psalm 11 19130 the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding into the simple Psalms 19133 order my steps in thy word could we say that today order my steps in Thy Word you remember he said he counts all our steps if he counts our steps he can order our steps order my steps in thy word let not any iniquity have dominion over me that's right I don't want to go outside your word let me order my steps in thy word Proverbs 6:23 for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life so in my path of Life he's going to give me correction and I'm so grateful for thaten aren't you glad for God's correction when you go the wrong way and God many times I've headed the wrong direction and God arrested me God turned me around he did it through a preacher or a pastor or he did it through a some spiritual person that would help me in some way God has helped me many times in that way he's corrected me he's corrected me by the Bible he's corrected me by the message of the hour many times and I I say God keep correcting me until I'm right make me right I don't want to play church I want to be right with God all right amen so brother Bram tells us that the time or not brother brandham Peter actually tells us the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God right and he said if it first begin at us what shall the end of them be obey not the gospel of God so God's going to correct his children first and brother Brenham taught us they would not stand correction then they were illegitimate right because that's what we have to do is come back to the word all of us do yes sir so brother BR when we come here we're here for one specific purpose this this is the house of correction this is the throne now look what David's saying look what he's saying he's saying God you instruct me you you give me counsel yeah he said and brother Bram tells us that when we come to the house of God the church he said this is the throne this is the throne this is the Throne of God now I'm not the judge God's the judge the word is the judge right but judgment Goes Forth from the house of God he said and here's where we come together Gather in love yes with one another as only Christians can love amen but in here he said we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Ghost is Among Us right and we're here to take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcoming how we can catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be he said and that's what we study ministers study these places for their people he said when they see the people to lack he said then they begin on that don't you realize what people sometimes get so upset about is actually God doing he he's he's correcting us he's he's surrounding our path of Life he's helping us again brother BR said Lord we are happy this morning to be back in the house of God in another service we pray God you will correct us to morning of all of our errors could that be our prayer this morning Lord correct me of all my errors he said show us the path that you have ordained that we should walk show us the path that you have ordained we should walk oh I love that and give us of thy Grace and love that we might follow those paths and instructions with all of our hearts that we might be found that day in Christ blameless for We Believe Lord that his appearing is soon what a prayer that is amen we correct everything by the word brother BR said the main thing of any gift is getting your own ideas away and let Christ he said then whatever is said he said if you want to know whether it's Christ or not just a sensation leave it alone but if it's just an emotion leave that alone but if if it's written in the word then it's God to always judge everything any Spirit tells you by the word so the word don't never get away from that word he said if you do you're lost that's strong but it's true look what David says in verse eight I have set the Lord are you still with me this morning I don't intend to hold you long but I just want to I just want to punch this in the Joel's going to preach tonight now listen he said he is first in my life he said I've set the lord always before me me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved all right he's first in my life Everything I Do I Do It the foot of his throne what a revelation that would be he said wherever you go brother B said wherever you go Place God if a man gets angry and cusses you place God between you and him if a guy calls you a Holy Roller Place God between you and him if the wife gets angry with you place God yeahoo praise the Lord now listen we've been taught how to do that brother brandom said you said well my wife if she's a Christian she'd never get angry that's nonsense that's what that is cu she's two-thirds unsaved just like you are sir right the soul the body and the spirit don't get saved they get controlled by the inner man that's right are you with me now so the wife gets angry sometimes sure she does but control it by the word and brother B taught us how to do that he said don't just don't just scream at him and say get out of here devil get out of you know she might or you might get out too but the wife gets angry Place God how do you do that he said show her love yeah right right same way with the husband the wife to the husband so if the husband gets angry Place God if the children aggravate you anybody got teenagers Place God are you with me now Place God between you and your teenagers I know some of y'all just had kids you know and they're little bitty and you just love them and I I was just loving on on uh on little Jonah last night man he just so lovable and you know he wants to hear me sing he's the only person on Earth that wants to hear me sing and and uh he'll sit there and just dance you know and just I just love that little boy but he's going to grow up to be a teenager one of these days the Lord terries that's where he's headed and there ain't nothing wrong with teenagers but they will aggravate you when they do what do you do place God Amen put it between you and that teenager you won't act inappropriate and drive them away amen whatever you do place God if Papa and Mama gives you a little spanking and corrects you place God yeah remember he said what God said about that bring up a child in the way it should go he said always remember Place God put God before you and you'll have reverence for God and respect for him yes something that's dying out in our age but we've got to reverence God yeah we've got to reverence the house of God we've got to reverence God's people that's Psalms 16:9 therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall rest in hope I love this even my flesh will rest in hope my heart is glad if I go by way of the Grave I'm going to rest in Hope rest in expectation verse 10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither Willl thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption so I can see David from the beginning of his life to the end of his life he's saying you've got it all planned out right and I don't understand why things happen the way they did but you understand Lord and you've got it all planned out for me so I I can rest in hope I can rest in expectation I won't settle for something that's against the word because I know you want what's best for me I've got something I know in the end I'm going to be resurrected I know you got my life covered from beginning to end sir yeah right you protected me he said you covered me in my mother's womb he said you even you you even influenced my my my gen the way I was born you covered me amen he planned you so now look he said he said when David was old and I want to speak for just a moment to those of you who have gotten older and I know some at home this morning and many of you are here our elders are are very faithful to the house of God and I thank you for that but I know as you're getting older you begin to look and you realize there's more road behind you than in front of you right and and recognizing that you realize that that well there's got to be something something that you hope for in the future well David said I can hope in this the same God who ordained my path of life to this point has also ordained a resurrection for me yes wonderful oh I hope you hear me this morning the same God who's dealt with me as an individual From This Moment up to this time that same God has also ordained a new body for me he said you've already got another one waiting all right you realize God's not up there frantically better hold off for while don't get in a wreck so I got I can make your new body that's not what he's doing but there's already Paul said there was another one already waiting sir right another Tabernacle another Mansion another body already waiting in the heavens when we leave this body there's already a word body a theophany body that's there so now David says I know that there's going to be a resurrection and even this body will be raised up in a glorified condition I know that I know that I wonder how many know that today what comfort that would give us as you get older I know that God's going to take care of me yeah that's good thou will not suffer th Holy One to see corruption brother BR said I see David when he was old getting down to the end of his road all the physical strength was just about gone he said moreover My Flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will not suffer his holy one to see corruption neither will he leave his soul in hell right he said he foresaw the resurrection of Christ and knowing that his body would not stay in the dust of the Earth but it would rise again right yes sir now Jesus took this and you realize now think about it David did some bad things the backs backslider and died with his family all tore up the kingdom actually got taken away from because of what David did right and and the prophet told him said you'll cause many to blaspheme but he was still a prophet that's right still had divine inspiration because he wrote in the Bible right and so so he's what what's he doing he's speaking the word and when he spoke the word God chose to write that down or have that written and passed on to the time of Christ so all Jesus had to know that he would be raised was the same thing you have he had psalm 16 sir right Jesus had Psalm 16:10 that's all he had and you say well I brother Ben I I just need a move of God and I believe in the move of God I believe in the move of the spirit you see what I need a real move of God to just just just change me I need I need to hear a word from the Lord Brother Ben you have a word from the Lord yeah come on I'm not saying God can't do special things for you he can and will yeah but you have a word from the Lord Jesus did not rely on a good service to tell him he was going to rais from the dead right he didn't rely on some preacher speaking over his life and doing it he didn't rely on on even something like that he r on the written word he could read this word oh my just like you can read it and it and it quickened to him because of who he was all right and God said That's you yeah amen oh because he was the word oh don't you realize today that that same word that you be you can be quick into that same word and say we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump you can actually be quick and that word the same way he was come on yes sir amen all right so now Jesus Took the word and believed it what did he believe it so much that he stood there and he told him he said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll rise it up raise it up look brother B said in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet Psalm 16:10 if you want to put it down said I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he said oh God that word has to come to pass it's God's word when are we going to quit playing with the word and just believe it when are we going to quit reasoning with it and just believe what it says and say I want it for my life I want it I want it because that's what's going to raise me up I'm not going to reason with it I'm not going to mess with it I want it for my life amen Wonder yes that word has to come to pass will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he said it's God's word plant it in your heart yeah he said if you want to go go in a Rapture how many want to go in a Rapture well it ought to be everybody I would think we'd all want to go in a Rapture you don't want to go through the tribulation then you want to go in a Rapture if you want to go in a Rapture he said if you want to be Christians genuine how many want to be a genuine Christian if you want to be a genuine Christian place this word come on put it before you always I'm going to be I can live as a Christian I can do what God says this word is true wonderful it's true no matter how I feel or no matter what's happened to me or no matter how many excuses I have the word is still true right that's good as he said I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up the prophet and the word would become the same we're living in that hour yeah there was a time God winked at ignorance brother Brenham taught us now that the seals have been open there's come a time when we're supposed to become the word yeah right all of the word go back to the beginning oh that's what I want yes amen it's a message of restoration he said notice every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed he said don't you let some educated Theologian out there try to pump it out of you don't you let him spray you with that carnal science and knowledge and education believe God how many can say Amen to that today he said let's think about David excuse me he said he got all stimulated too he said my cup is running over yeah he said I believe he really had a great event in his life what caused him to do that he said when he was in the spirit for he was a prophet he said the Bible say so Prophet David he was a prophet he was in the spirit he seen the resurrection he said if you'd like to read this in Psalms 168 to11 moreover My Flesh was made glad I rest in Hope because I I you'll not leave my soul in Hell neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption he said I tell you his cup got running over yeah right his cup got run over brother brand that's in the fourth still brother brand was talking about stimulation of Revelation he he said his cup got running over if it did that for David when he wrote it yeah what ought it to do for us I believe it did it for Jesus too when he saw it that's why he could say with such Assurance destroy this body in three days I'll raise it up yeah why he read that same word it was quickened to him and that same spirit is here today to Quicken the same word for ROM taught us that the mechanics and the Dynamics were here you said when did they get here they've been here the whole time since the opening of the word the mechanics and the Dynamics are here yes then it's time to be participate in that be a part of that yes let your cup run over amen with stimulation of Revelation because the word is true yeah that's good he was happy in his old age yeah so it is possible to live a long time and be happy yeah do you believe that I know we have some wonderful Elders here in the church that prove that he was happy in his old age because he saw the same God and knew him from his mother's womb would also raise him up Hallelujah but watch this before we close the BR said God has set all his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual working according to his word regardless of the conditions all right right regardless of the conditions a storm on the earth doesn't change the way the sun moves now I think about it I'm no scientist but every little every little thing that Earth does doesn't affect the way the planets move together why because they move by a higher law a stronger law a law of God and in nature that takes the form of like gravity and things like that so there's laws of God that he set in motion and scientists look at this and say ha there's no God we can explain all of this right yeah we can explain how the Earth standing there and all this this but who started it all where did the first Speck of life come from why is that a law they know gravity is a law we know why it's a law right so there is a law of gravity there's there's laws that God has that that make the the Earth and the moon and the sun all these things work according to his own word that law it's very simple it's just always going to do it that way now he said he his laws has to work according to his word he said he commanded the sun he commanded the moon he Comm commanded the Earth he commanded nature and they all fall right in line and all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word and the law of life that's in us he said will bring us to a resurrection yeah he said it's got to it's impossible for it not he said that's the reason he said the law of life that was in Christ he said when the word was spoke it said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell now look I want I want you to stop there for a minute don't read the rest of it until I now stop for just a minute look he said I won't leave you soul in hell that was a law right but remember Jesus was the word yeah he was born the word are you with me now he had instructions written in him when he was born to rise from the dead right it was a law of Life yeah the instructions were already there oh hope you hear now the instructions were there so because the law was there when he read the word and believed the word the word that was in him matched the word that he read That's why not everybody was saved like you were not everybody's life changed like yours did why did your life change because you read the word but one day it was Quicken to you and the word spoke to the word and the word the law of life that is in you actually matches oh I I just want to run around and Shout for a minute but I I won't I'll be good but look look there wasn't plus it would wi me to run around he said there wasn't but listen there wasn't enough time listen there wasn't enough Devils all right there wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in that grave till his body begin to rot because the law of God would bring the word to pass you just think about it for a minute when that first sell was just about like corruption was just about to set in I said no good there there's a law written inside of him the law of life was in Christ and he believed the word and anointed that word and when the oh my don't you realize you have that same law if you're a seed of God you you the said you weren't born on any day you always were in the mind of God if you're a seed of God there's something written inside of you when the Resurrection comes you will rise you can't help but raise up you've got to yeah law of life that's in us will bring us to a resurrection amen look he said and the law of God by his holy spirit brings any someone say any any promise to pass any promise yeah got to be a promise that's why if the spirit that's speaking to you telling you to do something doesn't match the word it's not a promise of God right and so the holy spirit will not be with you you might feel like it is yeah you might you might the devil will deceive you make you think that it is but it's not right it's got to be according to the written word it's got to oh my because the spirit will only Quicken the instructions that are already there does that make sense right right it can't bring uh uh something that's not a law of God to pass yeah he said and the law of God for the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass he said you get it regardless of the conditions job said though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I'll see God my regardless of how little little we are listen how low we are how impure we are oh you ought to take hope this morning listen God don't care what condition you're in yeah he doesn't care a bit what condition you're in but he wants to change you right and you've got to yield to the word to be changed there's no other way but surrender no other way but but but repentance yeah it's good you've got to come that way you can't come to God and dictate to God how you're going to be and what you're going to be God's got to do that in your life life right that's why he gives us pastors and and Men of God and evangelists and people that will preach repentance yeah right because you've got to repent to to achieve that that that's got to Die the seed that you have that're covered brother said it's a germ of Life inside a cird and the Cleber has got to die yeah yet the sticky nature remains but the inside of that's got to die so that you can be born something else right are you with me now so so no matter how Unholy we are how sick we are if you sick this morning how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue and says give it back Oh my he said oh if we could just think of that for a minute forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with his word yeah it's got to that's good it's got to it's wed to bring it to pass that's why I began this by saying you're not a victim you're a Victor that's the mindset we have to have now look musicians go ahead and come David said he was speaking of life he said now did you notice that last verse he said thou Wilt show me the path of Life thou Wilt show me the path of Life Brandon preaches the seron called the path of Life did you notice will you show me could he said it doesn't it doesn't say will you show me thou wi show me yeah he said not will you show me could you show me I hope you show me you will I might walk up and looks like the lions are going to eat me up but they can't yeah I'm a Child of God so there got to be chains somewhere right good there's got to be chain somewhere for all I need to know is where to walk yeah so I don't get eaten by the lon and God calls men you believe he still uses men God uses men to preach the word and cry out stay in the middle of the road stay in the middle of the word because if you get out of it you're going to get eaten by the Lions that's what they're there for and and the the mistrustful and the timorous they run away but those who believe the word they walk right down the middle of the road sure you you will show me the path of Life Lord when I get to that part of the road where it seems like there's no way out and it seems like nobody can help me and it seems like everything's gone wrong you'll show me yeah the path of Life brother BR said I believe everyone that God has called will hear and will come he said I believe that's what we're facing now in our meeting he said we can only seow the seed some will fall by the wayside some will fall One Way some fall another but some will someone say will will fall on good ground yes that's right we can't change the ground but we can we can seow the seed show me the path of life he said th will show me yes path of life amen let's bow our heads [Music] together [Music] I wonder if maybe the Holy Spirit has spoken to you today and as he spoken to me through his word maybe maybe he speaks like this and says you're too fearful you need to come back to the middle of the road you need to quit vulnerable to everybody that says they're a they're a preacher come back to the word you quit being vulnerable to everybody
