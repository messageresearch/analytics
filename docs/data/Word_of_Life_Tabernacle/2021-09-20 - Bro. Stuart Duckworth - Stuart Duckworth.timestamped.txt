[7:18] tonight
[7:21] due to romney the second chapter the

[8:14] you bless the word to your people's
[8:16] hearts lord may i be able to step aside
[8:18] lord that you can come to speak this one
[8:21] word lord that would mean so much to us
[8:22] tonight lord and lord may we just lord
[8:25] have the mind of god tonight we pray and
[8:27] we just ask you bless your word we ask
[8:29] in jesus name
[8:31] amen
[8:33] amen due to romney two and three
[8:36] and the lord spoke and said
[8:38] you have compassed this mountain long
[8:41] enough turn you
[8:43] northward amen you can be seated tonight
[8:52] amen god speaking
[8:55] speaking here telling the children of
[8:57] israel
[8:58] he said you've you've come past this
[9:00] mountain long enough
[9:01] amen for 40 years they went around
[9:04] the same old mountain
[9:06] on a journey a man on the same old
[9:09] mountain on a journey to a land that god
[9:11] had promised them
[9:13] and then they can pass this same
[9:15] mountain
[9:16] and that word can pass
[9:18] is to turn turn about around a side
[9:21] back towards go around surround and
[9:24] circle change direction
[9:26] so for 40 years they had wandered in the
[9:28] wilderness
[9:30] going to the land that god had promised
[9:32] them but just going every which way
[9:35] going around and around but that which
[9:37] would only truly be a few days journey
[9:40] turned into 40 years of wandering around
[9:45] amen we just want to stir up your pure
[9:47] minds and not by way of remembrance as
[9:49] the bible says amen we want to awaken
[9:52] our minds by the word and that's what
[9:54] the word must do to us in this hour amen
[9:57] to stir our spirits to stir us up amen
[10:00] to remember what the prophets have
[10:02] spoken the apostles our lord jesus
[10:06] and knowing that that peter said just
[10:09] speaking of the condition that peter
[10:11] said in the last days scoffers would
[10:13] come
[10:14] saying where is the promise of his
[10:15] coming
[10:16] amen it would be a spirit of unbelief
[10:19] that would mock the word
[10:21] and it mocks what we as christians are
[10:23] trying to uphold and this hour the goal
[10:25] that we're trying to get to what we're
[10:27] trying what we're trying to go amen
[10:31] amen and we've been called out of this
[10:33] world
[10:34] out of the systems of man to the word
[10:37] amen to be changed to be different
[10:40] to become the word and then we've been
[10:42] called to come out
[10:44] come out from the world to come up amen
[10:46] as john in the in the book of
[10:47] revelations to come up higher
[10:50] amen
[10:52] amen so the world would try to belittle
[10:55] that amen and it would be easy it would
[10:58] be easy if you don't keep yourself shook
[11:01] if you don't keep yourself awake and
[11:03] stirred up by the word to just to fall
[11:06] under that under that sleepiness and i
[11:08] think of the message that god
[11:11] that brother branham spoke and
[11:12] recognizing your daily message just how
[11:15] he would how he would say to us that he
[11:17] was trying to prepare for this but but
[11:19] he was fighting tiredness fighting
[11:21] sleepiness and that he said that satan
[11:24] was trying to cause that amen and if
[11:27] we're not careful we'll find ourselves
[11:29] in this hour falling under that that
[11:31] spirit of tiredness amen but the word
[11:33] has come to shake us amen we're in a
[11:36] journey amen we're in a journey no doubt
[11:38] we're in the wilderness we're on the way
[11:40] to the promise we're on the on the way
[11:41] to the rapture the promise of the
[11:43] rapture amen we've got to re we've got
[11:45] to shake ourselves by the word we've got
[11:47] to stay stirred up
[11:49] because there is a spirit of unbelief
[11:51] there's a spirit that would mock what
[11:53] we're trying to do
[11:57] amen so we're going somewhere
[11:59] we're going somewhere
[12:02] amen and
[12:04] you know we're

[13:47] it says by faith abraham when he was
[13:49] called to go out into a place which he
[13:51] should after receive for an inheritance
[13:54] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[13:56] whether he went
[13:59] the bible says by faith he sojourn in
[14:01] the land of promise as in a strange
[14:03] country dwelling in tabernacles with
[14:06] isaac and jacob the heirs with him of
[14:09] the same promise amen we're heirs of
[14:12] that same promise tonight amen amen
[14:14] we're heirs amen and the bible says for
[14:16] he looked for a city which had
[14:18] foundations whose builder and maker is
[14:22] god amen i believe tonight that we are
[14:25] the seed of abraham amen we are heirs of
[14:28] the promise do you believe that tonight
[14:30] and we as abraham we are sojourners in
[14:32] this land amen we're pilgrims and
[14:35] strangers and then walking by faith
[14:37] walking towards the promise walking
[14:40] towards what god has showed us in this
[14:42] hour and then we're seeking a city and
[14:44] we're seeking a place that has eternal
[14:47] foundations not something that's going
[14:49] to give away and crumble and be
[14:50] destroyed and be burned amen but i'm
[14:52] seeking a city tonight that has a
[14:54] foundation has an eternal foundation
[14:57] amen whose builder and maker is god and
[15:01] then john saw that same city abraham met
[15:04] the king of that city in melchizedek but
[15:06] john saw that city coming down the as a
[15:09] as coming down from god out of heaven
[15:13] you get tongue-tied there
[15:16] john saw that same city
[15:19] amen and we're searching amen we're
[15:21] going to a place where we're preparing
[15:24] to go to that place that's what we're
[15:26] trying to do now we're preparing
[15:28] ourselves we're walking by faith towards
[15:30] that promise

[15:45] there is a place beyond the darkness of
[15:47] this age be beyond the darkness and the
[15:50] corruptness and the evil and the
[15:51] unbelief and the spirit of mockery and
[15:54] there's a place beyond all this that

[16:12] amen
[16:14] amen we are not to wonder here aimlessly
[16:18] amen never never finding our position

[16:24] amen but we as a people are here to walk
[16:27] by faith
[16:28] amen to to be stabilized
[16:31] amen to have a sure foundation to know
[16:34] to know what we believe to know in whom
[16:36] we believe amen amen not wondering about
[16:38] from pillar to post amendment finding
[16:41] our position finding our position in
[16:43] christ and that is part of our maturity
[16:46] part of our perfection is to find that
[16:48] position and then find your place in the
[16:50] word not to try to take somebody else's
[16:52] place but find your place in the word
[16:54] and stay there and stand there amen and
[16:57] walk by faith and walk in the will of
[16:59] god knowing amen in whom you believe in
[17:01] what you believe
[17:04] and then we are to be stabilized
[17:11] i don't have covert
[17:13] i hope i don't
[17:15] excuse me
[17:21] excuse me
[17:24] amen
[17:26] amen to find our place to be stabilized
[17:29] amen to be about the father's business
[17:31] amen to be about the word be about what
[17:34] the word has called us to be and meant
[17:36] to be about the task at hand
[17:38] amen
[17:39] amen and that's all of us amen to be
[17:42] about the word
[17:45] amen and turning northward
[17:47] brother brown said it would be hard for
[17:49] israel to think that the promised land
[17:51] was 40 years away when they were
[17:53] standing on the other side of the red
[17:55] sea dancing
[17:56] shouting rejoicing when they were only
[17:59] merely just a few days from it
[18:02] so here they were
[18:04] 40 years from it little did they know 40
[18:06] years from it here standing on the other
[18:09] side of the red sea seeing their their
[18:11] enemies destroyed rejoicing having a
[18:13] pentecostal jubilee but yet it would be
[18:15] 40 years away
[18:18] amen brother branham said by walking you
[18:20] could make it in two days three or
[18:21] something like that amen you could go on
[18:23] to the promised land
[18:26] and just think of that it was right
[18:27] there
[18:28] it was right there but here they were
[18:30] wandering around in the wilderness going
[18:32] around and around and around the same
[18:36] old mountain amen and if you find
[18:39] yourself in that condition tonight and
[18:41] and we're all in a journey tonight we're
[18:43] all wandering around amen we're all
[18:45] we're all in a journey together towards
[18:47] the promise
[18:49] amen and no doubt it seems like it's
[18:51] taken longer than it should no doubt it
[18:54] seems like you just wonder when it will
[18:55] get there but god has a plan he allows
[18:58] things in the word and then he allows
[19:00] these things that have happened in the
[19:02] word amen for our edification amen to
[19:05] show us amen amen the journey that we're
[19:07] on
[19:09] amen who knew
[19:11] 30 40 years ago
[19:14] as as people come out of the end of the
[19:16] message and they come out of the
[19:17] denominations who knew that they would
[19:19] be here this long
[19:21] amen my parents and your parents say
[19:23] none of them thought that we would be
[19:25] this far along but yeah here we are
[19:27] and you begin to think of it in that in
[19:29] that wilderness journey i'm getting way
[19:31] ahead of myself here but i'm going to go
[19:33] ahead and do it
[19:35] there was a generation that had to come
[19:38] it wasn't time yet but there was a
[19:40] generation that had to come and the old
[19:42] fighters had to die off
[19:44] is that right
[19:46] i'll try not to get too too far ahead of
[19:48] myself here
[19:52] amen so here they were wondering
[19:54] wandering around and around the same old
[19:56] mountain
[19:57] amen but we've got to move on
[20:00] don't don't find yourself wandering
[20:01] around going back and going around and
[20:04] going every which way we've got to go in
[20:05] a line we've got to go towards the
[20:07] promise amen don't don't find yourself
[20:10] wandering around
[20:12] amen they were wandering around that
[20:14] mountain yet there laid the promise
[20:16] there laid the promising land just a few
[20:18] days journey
[20:20] but a few days turned into 40 years
[20:24] amen but there came a time when god
[20:26] spoke
[20:27] amen he said you have compassed this
[20:29] mountain long enough and then you have
[20:32] been in this condition long enough now
[20:35] is the time and brother branham says
[20:37] here an invisible union of the bride of
[20:38] christ he said some of you people that
[20:41] really believed this to be the truth
[20:43] that were entering another age were
[20:44] entering the raptured age you know the
[20:47] church can't go in its condition and it
[20:49] can't get any better it must get worse
[20:52] i mean he said how many knows that say
[20:54] amen he said it's got to get worse and
[20:56] it can't go like this he said it's got
[20:58] to be something instead it's it's moving
[21:00] now he said friend it's on he said the
[21:03] move is on for the bride that's the
[21:05] truth that's thus saith the lord and
[21:07] when the prophet amen directing his
[21:09] people as moses directed those people
[21:11] you have come past this mountain long
[21:13] enough amen we say it in these systems
[21:16] and man we've cowed down on denomination
[21:18] we've cowed down on these ideas it's
[21:21] time to move on with the word and man
[21:23] you've come past this long enough you've
[21:25] stayed in this condition long enough hey
[21:27] man it's the bright age it's the rapture
[21:29] age and then the prophet was directing
[21:31] it to you and i showing us and then
[21:33] calling us by the word to come out
[21:36] and he said the move is on for the bride
[21:38] it's thus saith the lord the bride won't
[21:40] stay in any old condition and then if
[21:42] she finds herself in the condition
[21:44] she'll be shook by the word she'll be
[21:46] changed by the word
[21:48] the move is on for the bride amen she
[21:50] won't stay here but she'll move on up
[21:54] so we must move up from this age we must
[21:57] move up from the conditions of this age
[21:59] even the lukewarm and the relaxed spirit
[22:01] and as brother earth said it will only
[22:03] get worse the church in his condition it
[22:05] will only get worse as time goes on the
