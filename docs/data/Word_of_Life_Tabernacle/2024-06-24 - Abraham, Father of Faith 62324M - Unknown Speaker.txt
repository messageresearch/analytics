Jesus name amen amen God bless you Genesis CH 12 and verse 1 Genesis 12 and 1 we continue to speak about Abraham father of Faith Genesis 121 says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a l unto a land that I will show Thee I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in the shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of Aaron man I pray the Lord that His blessings to the word you may be seated there are three covenants made in the Old Testament the first is the adamic Covenant the covenant made with Adam which is the Covenant uh that Adam and Eve broke and then there's the noic Covenant which we know uh they didn't keep very long as we heard about this morning how that they immediately descended into idolatry After the flood and then there's the abrahamic Covenant which is the Covenant that God made with Abraham when God made a covenant with Adam he said if you'll do these things I'll do this when God made a covenant with Noah he said if you'll do this then I'll do this when he made a covenant with Abraham he just said I will and so brother brandham said it was an unconditional Covenant unconditional Covenant I love that so uh he said Abraham was the beginning of our faith is that right oh Abraham had the promise and God called Abraham he said because he was a great man I guess he said no sir he come down out of Babylon in the land of Cala in the city of Earth and God called him and made his Covenant with him unconditionally unconditionally he said I'm going to save you and not only you Abraham but your seed unconditionally but said he was determined to save Abraham he was determined to save you aren't you glad that when God came down he didn't ask your opinion about it he said he was determined to save you Brother Sam he was determined you be in his family he was determined why he saw you before the foundation of the earth he was determined that you would be his child so he said I'm going to save you not only you but your seed unconditionally he was determined to say man listen Jesus said no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day he said you can't even come to me you can't follow me unless my father draws you right draws you John 15:16 you have not chosen me that ought to put the end to all of that right there he said I went looking for God I I did this and I did that he said you didn't choose me you didn't choose to be a believer in a message of the hour you didn't choose there was something inside of you he said you did not choose me but I chose you oh that gives me Comfort brother Bill that gives me Comfort that gives me the ability what does it do takes it out of my hands sir unconditional you have not chosen me I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so he said you've been chosen I just love this you've been chosen for a purpose and he said you're going to have fruit it's going to come out of your life and your fruit is going to be remain in other words it's going to uh be good fruit it's going to be continuing fruit it's going to be useful fruit whatever comes out of your life is going to be something God can use and God can use because he's the one that did it he said so I've ordains you that you should go and you should bring forth fruit so the believer works but the it's not the believer doing the work but it's God doing the work sir he said I ordained you for that sir I have chosen you for that that your fruit or your works the things that you do would remain I've chosen you for that and that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so he said I've chosen you to reach a place of maturity that you can speak the word word and things will begin to come to to pass you that's what this message is all about it's bringing us to that place of maturity but we wouldn't be no good to have a message if God didn't choose you but God did choose you aren't you glad that he did I'm always amazed to hear stories about people that come to the message that weren't raised in the message or weren't around it we love those that were raised in the message we want to nurture them as well and bring them up I was raised around a message home but yet I hear so many stories of people that hear about the message something happens in their life and brother West and them you you guys understand that you just one day you you come to a crisis in your life and and you and you find out about a prophet or you go back to listening to a prophet and you realize what God was doing I knew a man had come out of Memphis he was uh uh he was a Pentecostal Church of God Pentecostal man and he knew nothing about the message but his wife actually God spoke the name of William brandom to his wife he come in the message and his wife left him over it but that's how he come to God literally spoke to her she was a gifted woman but she couldn't receive the message but it was for him oh my it was God calling him and he's a Believer to this day God called him God called you so that your fruit might remain and whatever you ask the father in my name he said he may give it to you brother BR said the call that God gave was a supernatural call yeah right it was super beyond your abilities beyond your abilities to understand Supernatural not natural Supernatural he said but yet it never staggered Abraham no time he always knew it was God he said God's callings are Supernatural there's nothing natural God takes the Supernatural and works it out in the natural but the callings of God are Supernatural the Bible said gifts and callings are without repentance see it's for ordained by God now we know that with Abra and I won't hold you too long tonight because I know you're getting ready to go and have a nice day with your family but I'm so glad that you come and and I hate that you have to hear me this afternoon but we'll do the best we can but it it's a good thing that it was unconditional because Abraham immediately starts making mistakes he don't wait any time right the father of our faith immediately starts making mistakes soon as he's called his first mistake was a lack of Separation right and a lot of us can say Amen to that his first mistake was a lack of total separation Genesis 12:5 it says Abraham Abram took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and remember what did God just tell him separate from your Kindred right lot was his Kindred and the thing about lot was Abraham was always trying to help lot but he couldn't ever really be a blessing to lot until they were separate right he tried to help him all this time but he couldn't really help him until until he was in his right position and lot was in his because lot was a penny and he would never be a silver dollar he had a place in the economy of God but he would never be in Abraham he wasn't called to what Abraham was called to and many times the mistakes we make in our life is because we're trying to make somebody else be what we are and believe what we believe and do what we do no you can't make them do that they are what they are are let them be what they are but you be a silver dollar you follow the call of God so he told him to separate BR say he another thing he told him to do to separate himself now from his Kindred and all of his people he said God in order to get a man or a woman a boy or a girl to obey him you have to separate yourself from all someone say all from all unbelief he said that's right until you totally separate yourself from anything contrary to that word and believe it God calls for a total separation wasn't a request God commanded him get out from among your Kindred yeah all right now brother look Abraham is all Mortals not an immortal man not a man that can't make a mistake right you see how we build up these men sometimes we make them Immortal men but they're not Immortal men they're mortal men sir right that's a mistake for us to build them up like that because that God will allow something to happen that'll diminish them in our eyes if we're not careful even a pastor or somebody like that so Abraham is all Mortals not an immortal man not a man that can't make a mistake but constantly made mistakes but no matter how many mistakes he made his anchor still held for he had the promise oh doesn't that make you feel good about about being a Christian today doesn't that make you feel good good about being called by God he constantly made mistakes and you might come and say brother Ben I feel like I'm constantly making mistakes so did Abraham but God called him but see the thing he did he didn't quit all right he didn't go back to her he didn't stop being with Abraham he believed amen he believed God and he staggered not at the promise of God right amen listen he had the promise he took with him Sarah he took lot he took his daddy and as long as they was with him God could not bless him the old man finally died and they buried him he went on up a little further and lot back said he said you know what happened there and then he separated himself from him he said then God appeared to him again and said now Abraham look all over the ground it's all yours when he made the right choice that's it separates yourself from everything so our choices do have consequences but you're still Gods Abraham made a mistake made the wrong choice but God was leading him to the right choice he said maybe he said when you made the right choice separate yourself from everything maybe that's the reason some of us are not getting along so well he said we're holding on to things we ought to let go in the separation he said now what are the things you have to let go of you say well maybe that's my wife my husband my church that's not what he said he said a little doubt right come on preach with me this afternoon a little doubt separate yourself from a little doubt separate yourself from a little wonder wonder if that's right a wonder if that's right a little skeptic these are things we need to separate ourselves from he said wonder if it's right could this be could that be how could it be cut loose this morning oh that's what we ought to do cut loose and separate oursel from everything that would be against the word we should lay aside every unbelief that so easily besets us separate from it yet Abraham being the father of Faith he was slow to obey when it come to his family and many times that's the case with us but the Covenant was still unconditional I'm so glad it was God didn't fail Abraham failed but God didn't fail right maybe we'll talk more about that some other time Abraham's second mistake was leaving Canaan God told him to go to Canaan he didn't tell him to leave right and he went but then he he got in trouble he got in a in a in a drought and he left Genesis 12:9 Abram journeyed going on still toward the South there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sourn there for the famine was Grievous in the land brother R said that Abraham come out of the and sure crossed over the river of Euphrates many of you did when you was baptized you know that's what you were doing you were like Abraham when you were baptize you crossing over the river you know what that that that's what a Hebrew means it's HEB who passes over that's why they called Abraham the Hebrew he who passed over the river Euphrates he left Oh my he he was baptized he passed over you passed from being a sinner to being a Christian right yeah right and so you you crossed over and yet he had crossed over but yet he didn't stay there he went on down into Egypt he said now many of you crossed the river Euphrates was baptized come to the land now don't take right back down to Egypt stay right here in the land oh church we can only realize that you don't need to go down just CU you say well I'm dry I'm I'm discouraged I'm upset don't go down into Egypt and look for their uh their kind of uh life sustaining thing but go in stay in the land that's where God wants you it may be tough but that's where he wants you to be right I know sometimes it's hard I know sometimes we get to feeling uh unspiritual can I say it that way and when we feel unspiritual but JT we want to we don't really want to be in church it's the last place we want to be and the place we need to be that's not the time to leave that's the time to get right into the house of God that's the time to get closer to him when you don't feel like it that's the time to get down on your knees and really cry out to God yes now look he said stay right under the Holy Spirit stay right in don't pattern yourself after somebody in the world don't pattern yourself after him see watch him watch his life he said don't act like so and so does sister Susie or brother Jackson or whoever it might be don't look like he said don't act like them you just walk with him sir right feel my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly just stay right with him watch how it sweetens you and cuts all the world away he said oh my you don't care what the people says you're walking with God but Abraham goes down into egyp Egypt as many of us did if we were honest after we got baptized because God still had work to do in his life there was still sanctification there was still separation there was still the Holy Ghost the seal circumcision but Genesis 12:11 says it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt he said said unto Sarah his wife behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon this is a strange story I'm sorry imagine taking your wife down down among amongst a foreign country while we're here we're not going to be married cuz you're so beautiful number one Abraham thought a lot of his wife but you're so beautiful that they're going to kill me and take you so he says he some of y'all think like that about your wives don't you said they're going to kill me and take you so just say you're my my my brother or my sister which was a a white lie right it was technically the truth it wasn't all the truth CU they was half brother and sister so he said therefore should come to pass Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife they will kill me they will save thee alive I pray thee say I pray thee Thou Art my sister that it may be well with thee for thy with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of Thee boy Abraham had a yellow streak he was the father of Faith but he's got a streak of yellow and mile long he does now come on ain't knock none of us have ever been yellow you know afraid to do what God told us to do afraid to admit we were a believer in certain company all right right and Sarah does what Abraham told her she's a good wife and Abraham's fears came true probably wouldn't have done nothing about it if he hadn't said anything but the fact that he's back that he's out of the land and his fears come true and all the time Abraham now if you go read it you can read it all Abraham is making money on the deal that's true Abraham actually Pharaoh starts giving him stuff because he wants to marry his sister you know it it's funny how God makes those things is this cutting out on me I'm going to change mics I need a better mic anyway this afternoon y'all need to hear me so the Lord uh actually he you know Pharaoh's giving him money and the Lord begins to plague Pharaoh Genesis 12:17 with great plagues because of Sarah Abraham's wife and Pharaoh called Abram and said what is this that thou Hast done unto me why did thou not tell me that she was thy wife why said th she's my sister so I might have taken her to me to wife he said now therefore Behold thy wife take her and go thy way now watch he he immediately makes a mistake goes down and lies to somebody and seems to get away with it brother BR said Abraham no special man come down from the Tower of Babel perhaps come out of an idolator Bunch his father come down in the land of Shar down there to dwell in the city of er while he was there God spoke to him by grace not because he was different not because he was a better man but by Grace God called him the Bible clearly makes that known he said oh Abraham how Abraham he said oh Abraham how Abraham tested God's patience and sometimes I just want to put my name in there oh Benjamin how Benjamin tested God's patience oh you can probably put your name in there too right we how he tested his patience told him said Abraham stay in this land don't you go out of it but as soon as a famine come Abraham run he said Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by grace and how do we test his patience oh my today we're up tomorrow we're down one day we believe the next day we're wondering today we're a Methodist tomorrow we're a Baptist today we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow tomorrow the tummy a comes and we don't know whether we believe it or not but yet in the midst of all of that God wants us to stay put he said he said he wants us to stay put but he saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace of God we'd all be gone oh how many can say Amen to that today if it wasn't for the grace of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves Us by his grace Abraham was supposed to stay in that land but he went down into the calans he said or the Philistines went down there to sourn to get out of of famine things a little hard up in his country so he went down a journey down there with them done exactly what God told him not to do but yet the grace of God appeared to him kept the king from taking his wife the grace of God Abraham said it's my sister lied about it but yet the grace of God held him because he repented now look how he slips at he repented that's important Abraham repented right he said he didn't just get B by with it like we think he repented he said it's my sister lied about it yet the grace of God held him because he repented he was willing to repent he said and anybody someone say anybody anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you Hallelujah the grace of God is searching for you so that goes for you backsliders this morning he said the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient but he's looking for someone who's willing to repent not someone who said I'm doing good I'm doing good I'm doing good no someone who's willing to say I'm a sinner but I need the help of God now I'll be completely honest with you the first time Abraham does that doesn't bother me much but it's that second time because you realize Abraham does this again after meeting Elohim after his body change because brother random identifies Sarah and said look here goes old grandma with a Shaw on going down the land of the Philistines right and he said no she wasn't old grandma she' had her body change right after meeting Elohim Abraham again makes the same mistake now I'll be honest with you that offends my Wesley and Holiness sensibilities one shot and you're out right come on it does it does but God had Grace if you want it you got don't want it all right see the most important thing in your life and in my life is the attitude that we come to God with that's the most important thing the single most important thing the only way to get anything out of the service is to come with an attitude Lord I I want something from you today I need something from you Lord I I'm desperate for you today it's the only way to get anything you say well brother Ben I've been to church and it don't do nothing for me but because you didn't come with the right attitude but if you'll come expecting God to move god'll move you said well we haven't had a move of God in a while we haven't seen much Shadow R the AIS I tell you what if you if that's what you need you come expecting and watch God begin to move begin to expect God to save the Lost begin to expect God to do something begin to expect God to move as only he can but we got to come with the right attitude attitude of repentance but it does kind of offend me a little bit that Abraham went twice did the same thing but he was still God's man Genesis chapter 20 Abraham journeyed from this toward the South Country dwell between Kadesh and Sher and sojourned in guar land of the Philippines and Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my sister and ailec king of garent and took Sarah oh my now brother Brandon said that ailec was a Holiness man that's what he said he was a holy a righteous man and so God protected him from taking a prophet's wife so she had come into His household but he had not yet that that uh he had not taken her as his wife and so uh you remember uh that night brother Bram said he had a dream and God said you're as good as a dead man and when he had that dream ailec got up the next morning he said to Abraham what sawest thou that thou has done this thing I love AMC's respect to a prophet that he said what what caused you to do this well wasn't his prophetic Insight that caused to do it is because Abraham was a little bit of a liar right thank God for the Holy Ghost today right but Abraham was he told a truth something that wasn't true but yet he said what did you see and Abraham said because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place we might be surprised where we find the fear of God he said and they will slay me for my wife's sake the same fear he had before he said yeah indeed she is my sister she's the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother she became my wife now this was pre-planned and I want you to notice that a lot of times when we fail God many times it's because of something that's been going on for a long time and we never deal with it and then it pops up now this when they first got married and God first called them he said it came to pass when God caused me to wonder from my father's house I said unto her this is the kindness which Thou shalt show unto me and every place whether we shall come say of me he is my brother and and and so he had taught her to lie every time they got out of the land of Canaan because he was scared but notice it never happened in the land oh church we need to stay on fire for God we need to stay where God called us to be but the covenant's unconditional amen and ailec took sheep and oxen men's servants and women's servants this is a strange response I'm sorry gave them to Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife and AMC said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee and unto Sarah he said behold I've given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver love that he calls that his her brother in that place I've given thy brother thy brother wink and Nod a thousand pieces of silver behold is he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee with all other thus was she reproved now look this next verse is remarkable verse 17 so Abraham prayed unto God and God healed aimc and his wife and his maid servants and they bear children it's interesting that God cursed them with the same that problem that Abraham had remember he couldn't have kids right until Isaac was born but here this is during that time Abraham has had the same issue and now the king of gar is going to have that AMC's going to have that same that same issue and and because he has taken Sarah and it's already begin to show up in his household and Abraham prayed for them and they bear children now it doesn't make any sense to a legalist why God would let Abraham go down there but but I want you to look at ailec aimc is not respecting what Abraham did he's respecting who Abraham was right Abraham was a prophet you're a child of God right he was respecting the office and the position that he held I'll say this we ought to have more respect in the day and age we live in for God's men for the office of a whether it's a pastor or a deacon or whatever it is we got to have respect for that because God that person may do something that's not right they may do something you disagree with but even if you disagree with the person which is entirely okay don't don't disrespect the position because God will still honor that position right Elisha and the and the she Bears remember they come out and ate up the children brother B said that was not the spirit of Christ right God wouldn't have done that but he backed up his prophet's word so we need to respect God's men now he the next verse again that was just so remarkable Abraham had to pray for them brother said this king of gar fell in love with her and Abraham lied and said that's my sister he said this is going to shock Holiness people he said that's my sister so you find out that night after he took his bath I love the way brother brand dramatizes it he said he laid out and stretched his big feet out in the bed and you just see him laying there you know and he's so big you know he's got big guy you know and his feet are out under the covers he's sitting there wiggling his toes you know boy he's had a good day he found another pretty woman for his household you know and take for his wife he oh my this is the time and he said oh my Lord I'm so happy you gave me this pretty girl ignorant all the time of the fact there was another man's wife not to mention she was 90 years [Laughter] old they kind of left that part out she didn't look it ignorant all the time of the fact it was another man's wife he said and while he was laying there you can see him just laying there just pleased with himself now he said well remember he was a righteous man and so while he went to sleep the Lord come to him and said you're just as good as a dead man why he said' Lord why am I as good as a dead man he said well you got another man's wife out there see God and His Sovereign Grace protecting that stream of blood which come Jesus Hallelujah he said that's right God will do it don't you worry oh church we can just get away with all the worry today do away with all of it you can't make somebody a Christian stop worrying about it you say if everybody was nicer they'd be a Christian if everybody treated them better they'd be a Christian you can't make somebody a Christian you you don't worry about that don't you worry God will do it he'll take care of the rest of it you just let him alone he said just commit yourself to him he will take care of the rest sir he told aimc said you're as good as a dead man why he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart why he said you know that she told me that's my brother and he told me that's my sister he said yeah I know it I know it I know the Integrity of your heart and that's the reason I kept you from sinning against me he said look here's Grace I know you're a good man righteous man and everything he said but I'll not hear your prayer her husband is my prophet he said think of it a little liar now some of you kind of held back when I called Abraham a liar brother brandham did on multiple occasions he said a little liar backslid you say brother brandom I done something the other day I'm afraid the Lord won't heal me tonight I deal with this all the time as a pastor I deal with this all the time people come to church and they're sitting there convicted with condemnation saying oh I you know the way I've been acting I can't be healed I I I can't come to the Al I can't I can't worship so they just sit there all right and brother brand said Oh my he said oh yes he will oh yes he will don't you get scared you're a Christian you may have done something wrong but you're a Christian yeah sir you may have stepped outside Canaan for a little while and said something wrong or done something wrong but you're a Christian that's why you apologize that's why you repent you're a Christian just sit still repent for what you done and go on you say well I back said brother don't make any difference repent and go on see you're scared the first little thing comes along you turn your head one way now come on Brothers you know this the truth you turn your head one way and you think God's going to condemn you repent that's all doesn't make it right don't do it again but repent huh now he said that's all get right now look he said there was Abraham and anyone knows that God told Abraham not to leave Palestine and anytime that a person disobeys God he backslides there might be a whole lot more backsliding people than we realize anytime a person disobeys God he backslides because a drought come on Abraham instead of standing fa in the music he went and done exactly what God told him not to do so if you do what God tells you not to do you're backslid so Abraham was sitting out there backslid and telling a lie but God couldn't turn his child down Hallelujah God couldn't turn his child down he give him the promise unconditionally he said that's my Prophet you take his wife back and restore him if if don't you're as good as a dead man let him pray for you who Hallelujah who not that holier than thou are but my Prophet sitting out out there I'll hear his prayer Hallelujah there's the grace of God to the Holy Ghost Church oh do you believe you're the Holy Ghost Church today there's the grace of God to the Holy Ghost Church he said and you don't recognize it if we recognize it we'd be more free you know it if we recognize it we'd worship a little more free we'd be able to get into the service a little bit more cuz we'd realize it's not by our own Merit but it's by the almighty grace of God it's by his favor that we are where we are and who we are Hallelujah Abraham made his biggest mistake with ishmail maybe we'll get more into ishmail too at another date but it was a huge mistake ishmail was the seed of Promise slightly doubted that's what brother brand said the seed of Promise slightly doubted but just because the promise was unconditional doesn't mean Abraham couldn't make a mistake it just means God wouldn't give up on him amen he made his mistake he corrected him for it and he come right back back 13 years later and Isaac is born and when God speaks to to Abraham in Genesis 17 he speaks to him about ishmail or he speaks to him about Isaac begins to tell him what's going to happen and Abraham ishmail being about 13 years old at the time Abraham said to God all that ishmail might live before thee now think of the the carnality of of Abraham right even though he believed the promise sir but he said oh that that ishmail could be the Fulfillment of that right because it was even a miracle that ishmail was born but it wasn't by Sarah it wasn't God's provided way right and it speaks of denominationalism it speaks of false Doctrine it speaks of every slightly doubted promise but it becomes a wild man and it becomes what Ishmael is today he said oh that ishmail might live before theee see a prophet I've told you this before a prophet's desire is not thus sayith the Lord a prophet's desire what a prophet wants is not thus sayith the Lord but it's what a prophet speaks under inspiration that's thus sayeth the Lord because Abraham wanted ishmail to be the boy but God said it's going to be it's going to be Isaac and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him brother BR said this and I I'm I'm not going to hold you much longer this afternoon but he said this about Abraham and ishel he said he done made him a promise he said you know he said right then Abraham would have failed but the promise is unconditional the Covenant is unconditional how can we understand an unconditional Covenant I begin to ponder on this because I thought how I don't because every that I make is conditional right if I tell you that I'm going to meet you in the morning at 8:00 that's conditional on me waking up right and getting up and getting in my car my car starting and me getting up you know it may be it may be probable but it's not impossible that I could break that right so I I know that as a covenant maker because that's what a covenant is a promise that I can make you a promise and it's very rarely uncond there's very few unconditional covenants there are a few and think about it what's an unconditional Covenant well an unconditional Covenant you made an unconditional Covenant when you got married you realize that marriage is an unconditional Covenant boy got quiet some of y'all fixing to anyway look it's an unconditional Covenant God didn't say if she behaves if he behaves that's not the Covenant you made it's oh my it's for better for worse in sickness and in health in poverty or in Rich whatever it is it's unconditional that's one Covenant marriage covenant is an unconditional Covenant and another Covenant now think about this another relationship that we have that's unconditional is is our children right we love them unconditionally does that make sense Jehovah is Abraham's father and he loves him and in Revelation 3:19 he tells us something about this love he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasen it don't sound much like love does it but it is love be zealous therefore and repent now look brother in the church age book and I don't have time to read all of this but you can find It's a Wonderful study brother BR said let us examine the first phrase as many as I love in the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I he does not say as many would feel or as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours as many as I love amen he said so once again we find ourselves gloring gloring in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of God why because he said as many as I love now watch this love brother BR said is elective love it is love for his elect it goes beyond even parental love we'll explain that in a moment but it's elective love oh my and and his his children there is a difference in us and God we we make an unconditional Covenant with our children we I love them unconditionally and yet there's some things we can't perform in their lives right but God makes an unconditional Covenant right and there's nothing Hallelujah that he can't perform oh Church oh it just makes me want to worship him for a while makes me want I know we get kind of Stuffy sometimes we get kind of cold we getet in our ways we just want to go on but let's think about what we're saying for a minute that God loves us so much that he will not allow us to not be what he wants us to be he will not allow Abraham not to be the father of the faith he will not allow you not to be the RO Church Oh my he loves you so much Hallelujah and he can do it where me as a father I might not be able to my wife as a mother may not be able to but he can do it amen so it's not a helpless unconditional love but it's an active unconditional love are you with me now it's elective love it's his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit for it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself he goes on he said now he says to his own and me as many as I love I rebuke and chasen to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction chasing does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind he said I love and I chased and and again he says he HED in love a family of his own sir oh this is wonderful can can we just give it five more minutes of attention I know it's hot outside and it's not hot in here but only appear here on the platform but but you you realize what this means look oh church he wanted a family yeah you remember when you wanted a family something men you you wanted a family he wanted a family a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay oh my out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing he said then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk this is a god with a strong will he's not weak he's not doy right are you with me now he's got a strong will I will see my children right I'm going to make sure they're going to become something my children are going to be oh Church oh what kind of attitude ought we to have towards the promises of God if he has that kind of will towards us oh my look he said then he said he said this the choosing be his own choosing they are trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands isn't that beautiful if the hand given you the weapon come on Church come on how could we ever complain about the discipline of God on our lives when the hand doing the spanking it's got nail scars in it see you might question your Father's Love or your mother's love but you could never question his love he died for you he spread those hands and got nail scars in it he chases you with nail scarred hands you know that he loves you amen I think that's important even with fathers and mothers we our kids we've got to rebuke them we've got to chase them but they got to know that we love them he chases with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be oh I love him for that he chose all that lump of clay and in there I was there and I was chosen you were chosen as a vessel of Honor you didn't do anything to deserve that he just wanted a family just like you had a right to have a family he has a right to have a family an unconditional Covenant founded on overwhelming love I will now watch what he says in closing I will you didn't say I will if you will I I might maybe if it works out the Lord willing he was the Lord what' he say I will I will make of thee amen what's he doing to you Church what's he doing when he chases you what's he doing when when he puts you in the furnace what's he doing he said I'm making you something I'm going to make of you a great nation I Will Bless thee make thy name Great Thou shalt be a blessing I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed as musicians come this afternoon the the the most difficult thing about being a father I think and I haven't quite reached that age but my kids are reaching that age but I can see it is not being able to control actions and your children and I'm sure a mother feels much the same way that when your children begin to do things you have no control over it I got good kids I'm not talking about my own children but but yet you see that you realize that's coming that they're going to be adults and you lose that ability to say I will yeah at one time you had that ability I'll make you go to church right I will because they were children I will make you it's hard to see them become adults isn't it hard to see them take that step because we're losing that ability to say I will right and there's a trans transition time in there before they're full you know before they're grown where they still make they make a lot of stupid decisions but you can't really beat them over the head with it right because if you do you discourage them and and and they're going to just be ready to leave as soon as they turn 18 so brother BR said that's when they need a buddy right so then you can't just beat them up with that but you lost that ability to say I will even though I want to do that so bad I will make you I will make something out of you but God never lost that ability with his children and when Paul writes Abraham's biography under inspiration of the Holy Ghost we read it at the beginning yes sir he never mentions any of the mistakes I told you about tonight not one because he said I will hallelujah how did he do it on the cross he made a way sir he said I will all right glory to God I don't know what sometimes I don't know how we sit here and just he just overwhelms us with his love how can we sit just take that I guess we'll wait till the meeting and rejoice but you know we ought to Rejoice right now right today because he said I will and he did you see his reputation was at stake in Abraham's life that would be that would be a a mark on his reputation if one sin was counted against Abraham the father of faith it would be a mark against the reputation of Jehovah he was not disappointed in Abraham in the end he will never be disappointed in his children get that out of your mind you say well I've just been a disappointment to God he will never be disappointed in one of his elect he said I will make a you a great nation ain't going to let you go through some things but he's not embarrassed by you he he's not he he doesn't he he doesn't kind of step back when you come around say well I wish he wasn't my son no he said I will I know what I'm going to make of them he sends the tutor down our way and if we don't do right he'll chasen us he'll he'll put us through some things he'll allow us to go through many things but he will not be disappointed in the end result of Our Lives he will not in the end be one bit disappointed but will be just like Abraham's life he'll say they never made a mistake they were a perfect virtuous bride never did it in the first place Hallelujah you see if he could lose you he wouldn't be God he'd be a man like me his reputation is at stake you and we will fulfill every one of his attributes that he had in his mind before the foundation of the earth we ought to take comfort and rest in that it ought to Thrill us do something for us to think that way Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads before you Lord I I'm just overwhelmed by your love today I just feel like I could sit by myself and cry CU I think about my own mistakes Lord and I think each one of us could Lord we sit there we think oh God why do we have to do that why didn't we learn quicker [Music] sooner but Lord you you said I will I will make of you great nation I will have a bride at the end time because of your will Lord I know that I know that you are God you're able because of your will we will be that bride without spot or wrinkle and I believe we are now by the the washing of the water of the word you see us through the blood you made a way you said I will to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made Lord we place ourselves there by faith we are the Royal Seed of Abraham tonight we put our ourselves there and we say all of our sins have been forgiven all of my struggle all the things that I did wrong it's all been washed away and today today I stand cleansed Lord in your presence as though I never did it in the first first place may it be each of our prayer and our testimony tonight I pray you grant May there be no condemnation in the minds of your people as you've said there is therefore now no condemnation to them
