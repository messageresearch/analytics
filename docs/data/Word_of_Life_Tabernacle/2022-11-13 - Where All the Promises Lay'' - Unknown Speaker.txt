today Lord we we worship you today for who you are and for what you've done and I know how you work in our lives I pray that you move Lord in this service for you to help me Lord you see the weakness in my body Lord and my voice I I pray that somehow you'd move that out of the way and just speak Lord directly to your people Lord I know there's very real needs here this morning and only you can meet those needs I pray God that you'd reach down by your Supernatural power through the word Lord let you meet every one of those needs love him and we'll praise you in advance for what you do in Jesus name amen amen turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8 Hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 through 10 we'll go right into the word this morning something that's been on my heart for a while but I just had the time to approach it this week and you just bear with me this morning and pray for me and preach with me if you would and we'll get through it amen amen it's good to be here good to see all of you with us and those that are still sick we're praying for them this morning Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8. it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went so he was called to go out to a place and by faith he sojourned and what that word means is that he was a stranger there he was an alien so he did not he was not a citizen of that country but he's adjourned there as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles or tents with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations some place that was real someplace he could put his Stakes down and would not be a temporary dwelling place whose Builder and maker is God Amen I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated I want to title this this morning where all the promises lay Abraham was looking for a place where the promises given to him could be fulfilled and he knew that he was promised a certain land and he was directed to go out into that land and sojourned there it was the land flowing with milk and honey the place itself was a promise but also it was a place of promises so all of the promises lay in the land here as he would enter into the land he knew that as he would walk into it that that land contained all of the promises it would not only be a Promised Land itself but within it would be his body change within it would be the promised son within it would be his Blessing within it would he would become a blessing to others only in that land and so God told Abraham he said I'm going to bless you I'm going to make you a great nation I'm going to I'm going to preserve you I'm going to make you a blessing to other people and and that's us this morning we want to achieve all that God promise to us we we want to be everything that God wants us to be we're we're not here to go halfway in or or to step barely into the Waters of God but we want to go all the way in and and that's where Abraham was he said in order to be all the way in I'm going to have to journey in this land I'm going to have to make my temp in this land and you find that whenever he was in the land those promises could come true he was becoming a blessing to others he was a Sojourner a stranger he never owned a piece of that land until Sarah died and when Sarah died all of a sudden Abraham bought a piece of land and the reason why he decided at that time to buy land was because there was a promise of a resurrection and so he knew that the promises were yet unfulfilled there was something more than what he had experienced so far and so you could say well so far he had experienced the promised son he'd experience a body change he'd seen all of these things and yet he knew there was a spiritual promise for the job beyond that a promise of eternal life a promise of a resurrection a promise and so he knew that there was something coming and so he said I want to buy a piece of that land and do he buys Sarah the cave of mcpila and and he buys the land there and he buys himself a plot there and they were buried in the land of the promise brother Branham picks up on that and he said bury me in that land that's where I want to be is in the land of the promise because that's where the promises are so the resurrection promises in the land and his grandson Joseph was a mighty ruler and in Egypt and you know the story I went down into Egypt and yet he said don't leave me here because Egypt is not the Promised Land and what I want to tell you this morning in as a church where we want to go this morning it's good to have Catherine with us this morning you're always good to see each and every one of you but Catherine it's been a while uh her getting here so we're glad to have her today and and um one of these days maybe we'll we'll have more weddings who knows so but we've had a lot of weddings lately but Abraham going into the land and and and Joseph you know the land Egypt was not the Promised Land how many know that today it was a land where they could live but it was not the land where the promises lay it was a land where they could they could experience growth and even promotion but not the land where the promises lay and we want to be in the land where the promises lay denomination is not our land right the world is not our land we you might have a good job but that's not your land that's not where the promise lays the promise doesn't lay in your job the promise doesn't lay in your family the promise doesn't lay in some preacher somewhere but the promises in the word is in Christ amen so now uh he's his Joseph was a mighty ruler but he said bury me in that land are you with me this morning I wish I had the voice to preach today thank you but he said there come a time that the land would have to be possessed he said when you go back down there after 400 years I want you to carry my bones back to that land and but it was it was Joshua you know Moses could bring them out of Egypt but it was Joshua's Ministry that would take them in with the promises lay Moses could only take them so far but Joshua could lead them on in to the promised land and so as just kind of laying a background for where we want to go this morning and brother Branham sees a vision he relates it in Paradox and I've read it to you before but he said it was about three o'clock in the morning he said I'd gotten up and I looked in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan he said look like I was standing on the map of Palestine I was coming down to the Jordan and it seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to the Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river I looked back and seen which way I had come I was two-thirds of the way there to the Jordan yeah and I looked across Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay excuse me every promise lays in the promised land every promise lays in the promised land now again Abraham saw that as as a natural land he knew that all of those things that he was promised lay in that land and you and I have a land and and we can look at our land and say all the promises not not just some of them but all of them promise of healing lays in that land our promise to the Salvation of our children lays in that land yes everything good that we can have from God lays in that land so why should we look for something else or or for somewhere else to go the promises in that land he said brother Ben where is Our Land what is Our Land where do the promises lay I I want to take you to adoption the message adoption and brother Branham at the end of that message a man comes forward a brother says pray for me brother Branham to have the Holy Ghost he said I want to receive the Holy Ghost he said I have to I have a desire I have to receive the Holy Ghost and he said you have a desire to receive it you want to come into the land where all the promises is notice how brother Branham frames it he said you want to come into the land how many want to come into the land this morning So This Is Our Land This Is Where We Belong and it's why we want to have the atmosphere right in our services it's why we want to have the atmosphere right in our homes it's why we want to fight to stay in the land of the Holy Ghost because he said this is where you want to come he said I want the Holy Ghost he said well you want to come into the land where all the promises is and he said now Lord he's praying he said this boy is just across the river camped on the other side and Jordan is swelling and there's no way for him to cross except you make a way like you did for Joshua and for Israel and father I'm asking you as your servant let our precious brother o God let him enter into this Promised Land This Promise he said that on the other side as I was carried the other night may I have the privilege of grabbing him and throwing oh my arms around him in that other land saying my precious brother he said granted Lord may he receive the promise of God the Holy Ghost so we realize then that that land we could say in that land is the holy ghost or we could put it like this we know Joshua was the type of the Holy Ghost and we know that the land is the full Promises of God it's the fullness of what we are to become and what we are to be it's the fullness of the word we could say it's it's the open book it's it's the promise of God for our age the land that we're entering into is the rapture can we say it that way that's the fullness that's what we're longing for foreign into that land we've got to enter into that promise and the only thing that can take us there is the Holy Ghost we cannot be carried into that Land by by the law now think about it for a moment your pastor's instructions cannot carry you into the land I can tell you how to live I can advise you what to do but that's not going to take you into the land that's not Joshua are you with me now Joshua's the Holy Ghost your your church cannot carry you over right being a member of a certain Church won't take you over being a part of say I'm a message believer that won't take you over believing in a prophet won't take you over saying I love the message I love the prophet I love the things of God that's not going to take you into the land but it's the holy ghost that carries you into the land if you want to go into the land of promise what do you need today you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah do we believe that today devil so now we're going to enter into this this Promised Land where the promises of God can be take full effect in our lives where we can become something more than what we are in ourselves but the Branham even talks about that and we realize that in that Holy Ghost Land again it's all of the promises so we don't just stop when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it is that baptism of the Holy Ghost it carries us into the land and actually makes us become what God wants us to be it positionally places Us in the land of the word right and so now we want to enter into the full promises and brother Branham when he's preaching as I was with Moses so I will be with thee he's talking about his own Ministry he said the hour has come when I'm tired staying on this mountain I want to go up to Jordan I want to enter into the full promises how many can say Amen to that this morning I'm tired of of circling around this mountain I want the full Promises of God I'm tired of the devil getting to beat me up every day I'm tired of having to give in to him or you have been out I'm tired of having to beg and plead and I want to stand on the Promises of God I want to believe the word of God I want to be a happy I want to have a happy home I want to have a nice home I want to live for God I want to do what's right I want to I'm tired maybe you've struggled with some addiction or something in your life you say I want to go into the full Promises of God I'm tired of these besetting sins I'm tired of this lack of faith I'm tired of stepping back and wondering and just halfway living as a Christian and sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down I want to go into the holy of holies I want to go in with the promises right are you hearing me this morning I want to go in on the inside I want to go into a deeper walk I want to go beyond just a pastoral religion where it's just the pastor's religion and I take it or my mom and dad's religion or somebody else's I want to go beyond that I want to go in with the promises lay yes oh my where the Holy Ghost can take control over my life oh my this is the desire of my heart this morning he said I want to get Faith Within Myself not looking to a sign not looking to something God has revealed or some kind of signpost I want to look towards Calvary and say by faith I come Lord God I'm coming in the name of the Lord Jesus oh my so he's saying I want to get to a place where the promise is not in the future but the promise is right here all around me see there was a time when the promise in Israel was in the future they say here they were in Egypt they were not in the land and so they said well someday will be delivered someday will be taken out but there had to come a time when their feet walked on the land and they said now we are delivered huh now we're coming out now we're children of God yes now we can take a sword and say our enemy we were slaves in Egypt but we're Kings and Priests in the Promised Land so I want to get to a place where the promise is not in the future and this is why so many doctrines around this message it'll come up and and they'll put the promise some other time or some other place and they'll say well brother Branham you know he didn't get all the way into the promised land and so we're waiting on him to come back so he can go all the way in now I'm here to tell you he walked all the way into the third pole he walked all the way into the anointing of God he walked all the way into the open book and it was come back in our day we've already we've already seen the word common return in in word form Christ and word form return in our day what are we waiting on we're not waiting on anything we're just letting the Holy Ghost lead us through the land so we want to get to a place where the promise is not in the future or in some other Church all right I want to make us think this morning not in some other place well someday you know when the church grows and then we'll we'll all be you know on fire we'll have a real Revival what about today yeah someday all these kids will grow up will have a real youth group what about are we doing right now now it's time to get them saved right now it's time to get them in the atmosphere Now's the Time to really really begin to dig Now's the Time to show them what a real Praying Mother a real praying father is not going to get any easier the world's not going to get any lighter it's not going to get any it's not going to get any better it's only going to get worse but we're in the land hey man so it's all around us listen in Joshua 18 you'll find there that Joshua has they've come into the land and he's told them he's by Lots he's cast different ones he showed them where their land is and they come on into into chapter 18 and he and they set up Shiloh and they've got a place there where they can worship and and they've got to land and that's been taken part of it but yet seven tribes it's still not possessed the land and Joshua challenges them and he says how long are you Slack to go to possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you now this is years after he's LED them into the land and he showed them he said this is yours this belongs to you but he said and he described it even in a book he showed it to him he said describe it by seven Parts in a book and and show it to the people and so they described it and they walked through it and they said this is ours but they hadn't went out and walked on it yet so he said how long are you slack to go to possess the land which Lord your fathers hath given you so he's not preaching them something well there's something coming and one day you'll be able to do it but he's saying why are you slacked to go do it now what was this land that they were going to possess and we know and each patriarch was named by their mother under a certain promise that placed them in that land and their name actually spoke of the land that they would go to and be a part of and we don't have time to run through all of that this morning but you all understand and but the random deals with that on adoption and brother Bram says Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration letter of the Holy Spirit after being into the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there he said how that God has set some in the church now notice that that the mothers when they would have those patriarch babies they would they would actually as they were having going through the labor pains they would cry out their name and that name would positionally place them in the land and sometimes we wonder why we go through pain in life why are we why we have struggles and why we have why we have to fight through things and why Lord if you've called me to preach why do I have to fight so hard to stay in my position if you've called me to be a teacher or if you called me to be a uh some kind of a worker in the field whatever it is that you've called me to be why do I have to fight so hard to be in that position why do I have to do that well because those labor pains is actually what brings inspiration it's when you have to work for it that's when the inspiration comes are you hearing me this morning when everything's easy and the church is full and anybody can preach you now oh everybody's excited that's wonderful but when you have to work for it when you have to press for it when you got to fight the battle when you don't feel good and you come to the house of God anyway that's when the inspiration comes it's in those labor pains he said oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world and this is why we're persecuted he said Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise for the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains oh my because so many have stopped short they stopped short of the Holy Ghost they stopped short of the land of Canaan and thirds of the way say we can't go far any further he said but when they're born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists you see it's the labor pains that produce those Ministries it's the labor pains that identify those gifts are you with me now when the church goes through a labor pain when the church goes through a great trial that's what identifies who the pastors are who the evangelists are who the uh who the song leaders are who that's what happens when you're going through those pains you begin to see gifts raise up why because that's God uses them for deliverance oh my so the inspiration comes during that time he said when they're born positionally born into the kingdom of God God has said in the church some Apostles some Prophet some teachers some Pastor some evangelists he said then he's given to their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles but now the thing is you don't go into the land and say well let's see before I go in I want to I want to find out what I am I'm going to be a prophet and then you go into the land no that's no no it's the land itself that places you right it's your birth path your name your identification and the land itself that places you so you'll find that God wouldn't put a man with a gift for the for the seed to be able to work on boats God didn't put that tribe of men he didn't put them over in the middle of the country but he put them over by the ocean because they had a gift to do that right he put certain people in Hardy Arkansas right it takes a very special breed of person I hope you're with me now he doesn't put just everybody everywhere but he puts people specifically for a certain job a certain Church a certain place and he's placed you today and but he don't put you somewhere where you can't do the job he puts you somewhere where you can work where you can be apart I'm so glad for that today yeah but but the thing to do is not to go in and try to plan and so many times we overthink these things we try to think well you know if I go for a while and then they'll make me a trustee or they'll make me a deacon or or one day I'll get to be a preacher that's not what we plan for at all we get in the land and we put our shoulder to the wheel and God identifies the gift right the thing to do is get in the land you want to be a preacher pray more you want to be a song leader you want to be a you want to be a Sunday school teacher you want to be a part of the church you want to be a trustee pray more get in the spirit of God become a part be a help to the church and it'll identify the holy spirit will move you what we need is to get into the land so the Holy Spirit can identify where you belong right because if I just start handing out things I could identify somebody that maybe looked like they could do something but that don't mean they can only God can bring that inspiration as they're in the land of the Holy Ghost so again in Egypt Israel was a slave are you still with me this morning but in Canaan they were conquerors oh my where are we at today what is Our Land Ephesians parallels this and Ephesians 1 1 and brother Branham goes into this in adoption he addresses this in Ephesians 1 1 to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus brother Brown said watch how he addresses this this is not to the unbelievers this is to the church it's called to the called out ones the Sanctified and called ones that are in Christ Jesus he said now if you want to know how we get in Christ Jesus you turn to First Corinthians 12 it says by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body baptized by what the Holy Ghost not by water baptism he said you Church of Christ people but by one Capital s-p-i-r-i-t by one Spirit not by one handshake by one letter not by one sprinkle but by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body our possession the land that God give us to live in the Holy Ghost he said just as he give Canaan to the Jews he's give us the Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body he said now he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel who has possessed the land he said oh aren't you glad you come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the Wilderness and remember he said they had to eat Manna Angel's food out of Heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they had crossed over into the land the manatees to fall he said they were fully mature then and they eat the old corn of the land he said now not that you're not babies anymore he said now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the sincere milk of the Gospel you don't have to be babied and patted and persuaded to come to church he said now that you're fully mature Christians you're ready to eat strong Meats now you're ready to come into something yeah right I've had people tell me why do you read so many quotes well because we're in the land yeah This Is Our Land this is what the Holy Ghost anoints in This Hour this is the word of the day what else are we supposed to be anointed too hey man and so this is the word this is Angel's food we we've come out now and we've had Manna and and all of that but we're eating we're eating mature food now we've got something that'll make mature Christians he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and Rich he said oh we'll get into it directly and oh it's been hidden since the foundation of the world he said now that you've come into this I'm addressing this to you not to those who have just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that has received the promise how many has received the promise today you're in the promised land that means you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right if you don't have it you need to be seeking it yeah you need to you need to be getting in the land you need to be like that brother I must have it I must cross over but if you have it then you're in the land now this is who we're talking to right amen he said you're you're here he said oh how many has received the bad promise for the Holy Ghost he said oh aren't you glad you're in the land he said over here now eating the old corn eating the strong things of God got a clear understanding your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up I don't know if that's proper English but I understand it it's all unmuddled up your spiritual mind oh you might be going through a trial today you might you might have a struggle in your body you might have a struggle even in your in your mind as far as the world and and your finances and things going on out in the world but when you come when it comes to the gospel your spiritual mind is unmuddled up your mind is clear why you know I'm a Child of God it doesn't matter how I feel it doesn't matter what the devil tries to tell me it doesn't matter what the world says about me I'm looking at what God said I'm looking to the promises of God I'm coming fully into the promise of God I belong in the land I'm a Child of God I've been filled with the Holy Ghost ain't no devil can take me down ain't no mountains high enough ain't no devil big enough to scare me anymore I'm a Child of God I'm a Believer why your spiritual mind is unmuddled up devil try to come and tell you say well the bride's not going to make it you say I've already been told different yeah all the what the everything's going bad everything's going to go down and you're going to lose your children I've already been told different my children are already in this land my body changes already in this land huh have come into the land where the promises lay now watch he says he said your spiritual mind's all unmuddled up you know exactly who he is how many know who he is today you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going oh this this ought to excite us today oh this is us this morning you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against that day he said oh that's the one that's who Paul is talking to now amen he said now let me have the church to repeat that how do we get into Christ by joining Church by putting our name on a book by being baptized by Mercy oh we go a little bit farther in our day and age couldn't we by listening to a tape by being a member of Word of Life Tabernacle huh that's not how being baptized is good but it's not what puts you in the body being a member of world of Life Tabernacle is good but it's not going to put you in the body God listening to a tape is good but it's not going to put you in a body listening to me preach is good I hope so but it's not going to put you in the body how do you get in the body by paying tithes no by working in the church by being a deacon or trustee how do we get into Christ by one Holy Spirit we're all baptized into one promise the body and our partakers of all that belongs in the land to get into Canaan you got to go across Jordan you got to die like we all had to die you got to go through the same watery grave you got to walk across under a supernatural leadership of Joshua the Holy Ghost it's the only way into the land right and it's why people can't manifest the promises of canaanisms because they've never went in with Joshua they're just observers in the land right just one around but they've never went in they've never they've never went in they've never been baptized in Jordan they've never walked through spiritual death death to the old nature and come out alive on the other side alive in Christ now watch he said Mom when I get in this land I watch I I wish I had the voice to preach today so when I get in this land it's mine yeah it's not mine Plus brother Ben's it's not mine plus my wife or my husband or my kids it's mine it belongs to me that means if my wife don't go I'm still going to go yeah that's harsh but it's the truth if my pastor don't go I'm still going to go huh I'm gonna get my new body if my family don't go I'm still gonna go it's not it's not determined on whether they do it or not whether they still believe the message listen to me so many people are only in the message because their family is as a family religion yeah that's a family tradition yeah that's not why I believe the message I believe the message in spite of my family I love my mother being here in church with me and my brother and my sister but I tell you what I believe the message inspired in my family because I know that family will fail but God never fails this is the land this is the land this is the place that God has given us this is the word of the hour I believe it in spite of in spite of every everything that's happened all the trials and tribulation we got to believe it anyway why it's the word of God you believe it because it's true I'm because somebody else does it not because well so and so goes to church there I guess I should no you have to believe it because it's true I'm in the land when I get in this land it's mine I'm a home now I think that's why some people have such a hard time worshiping God yeah yeah they're not home in the land you're getting the Holy Ghost and people begin to begin to look around say well that's not really for me I begin to pull back why because they're just not home there yeah and probably why that's happening is because they don't do that at home but if you get on under the influence of the holy spirit in your home you're going to be at home when the influence of the Holy Spirit comes in church you're not going to be afraid of the Holy Ghost because you've been there you know what that's like to be prayed through you know what it's like listen church I think the Hours come we need to get into it we don't need to shirk back from the Holy Ghost today it's a trick of the enemy this is the hour to pray through this is the hour to get into the Holy Ghost this is the hour to get sincere about these things not not the hour to step back but the hour to go on into the fullness of it because now we can there was a time they couldn't now we can now look he said I'm subject I'm in Canaan I'm subject to anything God wants to use me for right say anything you know what that means you're a totally surrendered vessel in the land you're not your own you belong to God he said I'm subject to anything God wants to use me for I'm walking on holy grounds a child of the king all robed up and ready I've come out of Egypt come up to the promised land stood the trials passed over Jordan into this blessed promise oh how did I get it by one Spirit the same way Paul got it acted on me the same way it did on him the same way it did On You by One Spirit we're all baptized not sprinkled I watched he said just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good but it merged Thunder that's what baptism means it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost not the sprinkle of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're you're immersed hundred he said all made to being swim under in the Holy Ghost that's the promise oh aren't you glad to be in the land with the promises lay notice what he says to the to those who are in Christ Jesus Christ be to you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ he says not just some to the apostles and some to this but he's blessed us someone say he's blessed me blessed me he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ not just the apostles but he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost that made Mary shout and speak with tongues and to have a wonderful time and rejoice and the things that she did is the same Holy Ghost here tonight yeah the same Holy Ghost to let Paul on that Old Ship where it looked like it was waterlogged and was gone 14 days a night no moon or Stars he looked out there and every wave had a devil on it glancing gleaming his teeth and said I'll sink you oh boy I got you now and while Paul went down to have a little prayer that stood an angel and said don't you fear Paul this old ship's going to be wrecked up on a certain Island go ahead and eat your supper it's all right now he said here he come with them chains on his little old arms dragging them on his feet and said be of a good courage man for the god the angel of God who's servant I am stood by me and said Paul don't you fear he said that same Holy Ghost is here tonight the same spirit of God ministering to us the same someone say the same spiritual blessings amen that's the land yeah yeah I said my brother Ben you why why don't we receive more of it well we just need to walk into it yeah the blessings are in the land yes stay in the land now I know some of you can you bear with me for just a few more minutes I know my voice this week I I've only got so much breath I've sat in a chair for two weeks because I can't breathe laying down and and uh but just that time of year and just these things going on I know some of y'all suffered the same way but but we believe God's A Healer you believe that today you might say brother Ben it's the Holy Ghost is where all the promises lay why did the Pentecostals not finish the job and think about well they had the Holy Ghost well it's true they tasted of the Holy Ghost but the Pentecostal age was the age that Drew back yeah how many know that yeah that's Hebrews 6 4. he says it is impossible for those who are once enlightened remember it was the Pentecostal Church where he was outside the church knocking he said those who are once enlightened have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost they were made for takers and tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come and if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame Joshua said Moses took one out of every tribe every denomination he sent us over to spy out the land when we got there at the river and looked across and seen that amalekites the amorites and the parasites and what more and said they were giants said the people screamed out for fear well we can't do that if we ever respond to our meeting like that our organization will turn us out we just can't do it we can't have things like that it's too shady see we we can't why it's impossible and when they come back yet they had the evidence brought back grapes from that land and the trouble of it is how can a man listen or church or denomination that's ever tasted of the evidence that he is alive and then deny him when he is resurrected Among Us how can you do it Pentecost you spoke with tongues and interpreted tongues as you claim he said and then how could you turn the very promised word down for this age he said take part of it you say it's a good land we had no idea it was a good land it's proven to be a good land but that one bunch of grapes wasn't all of it all Palestine was full of it so the Pentecostals were the ones who went and got by the day that one bunch of grapes and they come back slobbering on them right they come back and said oh they're good grapes bless God it's an Evidence right it's evidence the holy ghost man that we we believe in it we believe the Holy Ghost they partook of it they grabbed the evidence of it but they didn't get the person of it they didn't get the fullness of it they didn't go on in they stopped two-thirds of the way are you with me now many in this message have done the same thing if we're not careful we walk two-thirds of the way and say God sent a prophet and we see God sent a prophet and we take it back as an Evidence we say but uh we say look there's 1100 tapes and we take that back as an Evidence look God moved through a Ministry we see a son of man Ministry we take that back as an Evidence God even opened the seals we take him back as an Evidence but there's more to it than that there's a land you've got to walk into huh you can't just go to the borderline and say there's an Evidence oh it's good but there's more where that come from how can you bring back the grapes and deny the word so that bunch of grapes wasn't full wasn't all of it all Palestine was full of it the same land has a body change in it oh Church you realize that this morning I wish I could preach that the same land yeah that you got the Holy Ghost in yeah the same land that healed you from all your diseases the same land that's brought you out of the world the same Holy Ghost that's done all that for you that same land has a body change in it that same land has your children in it that same land has your promises in it go get them press on into it keep pressing on don't give up now now's not the time to draw back now it's not the time to to cabbage down on evidence Now's the Time to press on amen yeah hey man he should not stop on one evidence there's more evidences there's homes how many believe there's homes today I can have a home where it's not all fighting and fussing right right that's there's that's in the my land yeah yeah you realize that the peace of God is in that land yeah the Prince of Peace is in that land Shiloh is in that land I don't have to lay over here where it's a bunch of rednecks fighting and fussing and killing one another I can go in the land are you with me now it's not a republican land or a Democrat land or a redneck land or an Arkansas land or a Canadian land it's a land of the Holy Ghost where my family can operate the way God wants it to him go into the land I want to go into the land I want what God wants for my family I want what God wants for my marriage well what God wants for the church are you with me now I want to go all the way in I don't want to just stop with a bunch of grapes right oh we got good music but I want to go all the way in we've got good preaching but I want to go all the way in we we hear the word but I want to go all the way in if there's gifts there I want to take advantage of them if there's power there I want to take advantage of it if the presence of God is there that'll make me drunk on the Holy Ghost I want to take advantage of it the power to live a Victorious Life let me not stop at a camp meeting let me not stop in a momentary excitement let me go on in not just an Evidence everything's good over there there's homes from the land there's places there's Gardens milk and honey good food many things water's flowing from the mountains everything's good over there just not a bunch of grapes but that's where we stop bless God we got the Holy Ghost the evidence is speaking in tongues he said that's all right show somebody went over there but why do you stand at this borderline made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the power of the world to come he said see that they'll fall back into the same old wrath the Methodist did the Baptist did the Presbyterian did and crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and bring him to an open shame go on in you don't have to stand there where you're up and down all the time you're always getting the Holy Ghost and losing it in and out one day you got it one day you don't because somebody told you you didn't go on in go in where you're sure go in where you know be on the shadow of a doubt it was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know yeah amen go into a no-sew religion go in something real hey man go in see we are not that group that goes back but Paul speaks in Hebrews 6 9 he said but beloved we are persuaded better things of you things that accompany salvation but we thus speak amen we're not going back we will not fail why because we're in the land we've crossed over we've been buried in Christ the church brother random says the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word and he patches the Bible he said denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall do we believe the word or don't we this one knows it and won't fall she is ordained Hallelujah she is ordained to not fall right she won't fail she is predestinated to it blessed is the man who God will not impute sin you just won't put it on his account I've often wondered why God led us have to fight while we preach but you know you realize it's just as much a fight to preach as this a fight to listen he said blessed is the man who God will not impute sin notice redeeming back with him going home back to eternal life in a human body oh God how many want to go all the way in we're not just going to Pentecostalism are you with me I'm not just going to a bunch of grapes we're going on in we're going on into the land we're demon all the way back back to eternal life in a human body eating drinking living forever Isaiah said they'll build houses and inhabit them plant Vineyards and eat the fruit don't you want to go back to that they'll not build in another taken the children won't take it but they'll be there with their offspring that's our land yeah yeah he'll build it and stay there hey man he don't build in another easy builds and eats it himself what is it his bride going back with him redeemed back to the original Adam and Eve again for death is Left Behind and look back at the cross and see death has been paid and now by faith we are resurrected with him sitting in Heavenly places and we can say right now right now looking back to what redeemed us waiting for the husband to come to march on home with him aren't you glad to be in the land today hey mass as far as I can go this morning let's Bauer hits why don't we just make a commitment this morning say Lord I want to go all the way into the land I want to go all the way in I don't want to stop

that wouldn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray Lord you'd fill them today for him to receive all the word hard that they could walk on their own two feet they could fight with their own sword
