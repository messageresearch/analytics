[45:21] have need of heal the sick touch every
[45:23] every heart we pray in Jesus name
[45:29] bless you turn with me to Isaiah 6 and 1
[45:32] and then we'll read John 12 32.
[45:36] Isaiah 6 1 and John 12 32. it's good to
[45:42] see you all here tonight but Dale's good
[45:44] to see you tonight and just got back I
[45:47] think recently from Africa from West
[45:48] Africa I've been there and and I think
[45:51] about the same place and and uh I know
[45:54] it's a hard trip so we appreciate you
[45:56] being here but I'm sure you've got lots
[45:57] of stories to tell so I know I did I'm
[46:00] still telling stories
[46:02] uh some of them just now remembering so
[46:06] they take on but Dale's older than I am
[46:08] so he may have worse problem with that
[46:09] than I do but
[46:11] I think you're older than me I hope so
[46:12] after saying that
[46:14] I figure he is he's got more kids than I
[46:17] do so
[46:18] good to be in the house of the Lord
[46:20] tonight amen God bless you I want to uh
[46:24] deal with this where we left off this
[46:26] morning in Isaiah 6 1 and then the
[46:28] second scripture in John 12 32. in the
[46:31] year that King Uzziah died I saw also
[46:34] the Lord notice his position sitting
[46:38] upon a throne high and lifted up
[46:42] and his train filled the temple
[46:46] we took that this morning and there's no
[46:48] room for any counselors no advisors said
[46:51] who's given the Lord counsel no one else
[46:54] there it's just him and at some point in
[46:56] our lives we've got to get to the point
[46:57] where it's just us and God
[46:59] no one else
[47:01] and then John 12 32
[47:05] he says and I
[47:07] if I be lifted up from the Earth
[47:11] this is a different kind of lifting up
[47:15] talking about his death
[47:18] to be lifted between the heavens and the
[47:20] Earth on a cross
[47:23] he said if I be lifted up from the Earth
[47:25] I will draw all men
[47:28] unto me
[47:29] I pray the Lord without his Blessing to
[47:31] the word you may be seated
[47:33] this evening
[47:36] talk about that tonight lift it up
[47:40] the Old Testament view of God was
[47:42] Isaiah's Vision God high and lifted up
[47:47] a mighty God God on his throne and I
[47:51] think we ought to see God that way today
[47:54] that he is on his throne he's high and
[47:57] lifted up in Psalms 47 and 1
[48:01] he uh he spoke this way he said oh clap
[48:03] your hands all ye people shout them to
[48:06] God with the voice of Triumph
[48:08] for the Lord most high is terrible
[48:12] terrible that word doesn't mean he's bad
[48:14] it means that he's fearful
[48:17] uh he he's he's to look at him you John
[48:21] when he saw him in his with his uh with
[48:24] his uh white hair and in his wig in his
[48:27] judgment position with his feet like
[48:29] brass and his eyes like fire he he saw
[48:32] him that way and he fell at his feet is
[48:34] dead he didn't even have any strength
[48:36] left in his body because he saw him
[48:38] lifted up
[48:40] he saw him in his position and I think
[48:42] we ought to see him that way sometimes
[48:45] we need to see him lifted up and above
[48:48] the world and and there's no room as I
[48:51] said this morning for anything else when
[48:53] he's in that condition the Lord most
[48:55] high is terrible he is a great king over
[48:58] all the Earth
[49:00] if we go back to Isaiah chapter 6 he
[49:03] says I saw him I saw the Lord sitting
[49:06] upon a throne high and lifted up his
[49:08] train filled the temple above it stood
[49:11] the seraphims each one had six wings
[49:14] with Twain he covered his face and with
[49:17] Twain he covered his feet and with Twain
[49:19] he did fly between his two and one Cried
[49:23] unto another and said holy holy holy
[49:26] it's the Lord of hosts the whole earth
[49:28] is full of his glory again it's filled
[49:33] up with the glory of God it's trained
[49:35] filled the Temple look at the image
[49:36] that's being presented to Isaiah who's
[49:39] just lost his friend Uzziah and how
[49:41] Uzziah tried to elevate himself and lift
[49:44] himself up to the position of a minister
[49:46] when that's what he wasn't called to do
[49:48] and here here was a man a prophet Isaiah
[49:52] who looked up to his friend who was the
[49:54] king and and that leadership could only
[49:57] take him so far but now he's reached a
[49:59] place where he needs to go beyond that
[50:01] he needs to take a step into the
[50:03] presence of God let me hear you let me
[50:05] hear me today church I I'm too tired to
[50:08] get my words out but you just hang with
[50:10] me tonight I I wish you could hear me
[50:12] today and that we would we would lift
[50:15] him up out of out of the doldrums of
[50:18] life and out of the regularness of
[50:20] everything that we deal with in life
[50:22] let's lift him up and let's get into the
[50:24] presence of God one time where we would
[50:26] know that he is worthy of our praise and
[50:29] he's worthy of of us living a life life
[50:31] that would be worthy of the Gospel
[50:35] amen
[50:36] and so they cried to one to another
[50:40] the whole earth is full of his glory
[50:43] post of the door moved the voice of him
[50:46] that cried
[50:47] and the house was filled with smoke he
[50:50] said God doesn't like noise well he did
[50:53] there
[50:54] in that vision of him and you realize
[50:56] that he doesn't always present himself
[50:58] that way and we're going to talk about
[51:00] that in just a moment but in that moment
[51:03] when when he's high and lifted up when
[51:05] he's Mighty he said shout unto the Lord
[51:09] right at the moment when he wants praise
[51:13] he wants you to acknowledge his
[51:15] omniscience as all my presence his
[51:17] bigness if you can say it that way he
[51:20] wants you to acknowledge sometimes we
[51:22] need to do that in the house of God we
[51:24] need to say Lord you're you're a great
[51:26] God
[51:27] you're a mighty God you're you're a God
[51:30] of ability sometimes we reduce him down
[51:32] to our little problems and our little
[51:34] things and we think well you know I just
[51:37] need God to take care of this and that
[51:38] and the other and it becomes like a
[51:40] servant or a butler that would bring us
[51:42] something good now and then but that's
[51:44] not what God is he's a mighty God he's
[51:46] bigger than your problems he's bigger
[51:48] than tiredness he's bigger than what
[51:50] you've been through through the day he's
[51:52] bigger than all of that
[51:54] he's a mighty God and he wants to be
[51:56] worshiped like that
[51:59] amen
[52:00] he said brother said let's look at the
[52:03] vision the prophet saw and break it down
[52:06] two Wings covered their faces
[52:09] so think of it even Holy Angels had to
[52:11] hide their sinless faces to stand in the
[52:15] presence of God
[52:17] I was giving Wings to hide their face in
[52:19] the presence of the holy God how are you
[52:21] and I going to stand there if the
[52:23] seraphim had to use Wings God's provided
[52:25] way to hide their face to stand in his
[52:28] presence to seeing holy holy holy is the
[52:30] Lord God Almighty he said in reverence
[52:32] in his presence
[52:34] he says now we don't have any reverence
[52:36] to God everybody now watch everybody
[52:38] just thinks he is so secured until they
[52:41] don't reverent God like they should
[52:44] I think that we message people and I
[52:47] don't like to even use that phrase
[52:49] sometimes because you know I believe
[52:51] we're God's people I I believe we're the
[52:53] bride but yet I think sometimes as
[52:55] message people we know who we are and so
[52:57] we re we read the things about us and
[53:00] that's good we have to know who we are
[53:02] but when we really know who we are and
[53:04] we begin to comprehend what he did for
[53:06] us it ought to bring a reverence to us
[53:08] we ought to become conscience of the
[53:10] presence of God but he said everybody
[53:12] just thinks he is so secure and well I'm
[53:15] predestinated I'm going to make it but
[53:17] when you get in the presence of a mighty
[53:19] God you still ought to fall down on your
[53:22] face and acknowledge he's God and I'm
[53:24] not
[53:27] amen
[53:29] so they can't
[53:31] brother remember said they don't they
[53:33] don't Reverend God like they should
[53:35] why do they do this because they're not
[53:37] conscience of his presence
[53:39] it's the reason people do that they
[53:40] don't recognize it
[53:42] they can't comprehend that they're in
[53:44] the presence of God now why can't they
[53:46] comprehend it because their minds become
[53:48] so perverted and taken up in the things
[53:51] of the world till they don't even pay
[53:53] any attention to it
[53:57] they go to church sure but to realize
[54:00] it's a different thing than just going
[54:02] to church
[54:03] to realize that you're in the presence
[54:05] of God
[54:06] he said not only in a church wherever
[54:08] you are you're in the presence of God it
[54:10] was David who said everything I do I do
[54:13] in the presence of God
[54:14] I can't leave your presence
[54:17] you say well brother Brandon you just
[54:19] said they were provided with two wings
[54:20] and so they were provided with something
[54:22] to be reverent with
[54:24] and brother Brown said you're provided
[54:26] with something too the blood of Jesus
[54:29] Christ is your covering well aren't you
[54:32] glad for that covering today I don't
[54:35] think people understand the blood you
[54:37] realize when the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:39] is applied and this goes to a question I
[54:41] was asked the other day about something
[54:43] and and the end result is people
[54:45] misunderstand the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:47] if the blood of Jesus Christ is applied
[54:50] to your life it covers past sin
[54:52] present sin and future sin you cannot
[54:56] sin and be a Christian right
[54:59] Christians don't sin that's right that's
[55:01] a direct quote where the random said
[55:03] that they make mistakes they don't sin
[55:06] and so the blood is your covering
[55:08] oh let's keep it applied today let's
[55:11] keep it on the doorpost and keep it
[55:13] applied because the blood is a covering
[55:15] it who am I if you just realize you're
[55:18] The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus
[55:21] Christ that's where you belong and that
[55:23] blood has a covering for you that's What
[55:26] Makes You reverent is the blood
[55:28] oh God he said you don't stand as a
[55:31] seraphim you don't stand as a cherubim
[55:34] you don't stand as an angel
[55:36] listen they have to cover their faces in
[55:39] the presence of God but you and I Paul
[55:42] says can behold with an open face
[55:46] why because you're more holy than an
[55:48] angel
[55:49] more sinless than a terrible
[55:52] I hope you're hearing me tonight because
[55:54] the blood of Jesus Christ is so great
[55:56] that it not only took away the sin but
[55:58] it washed you and made you his bride
[56:00] aren't you glad for that today
[56:01] look you you don't have those wings
[56:04] you stand as a redeemed son or daughter
[56:07] of God by this Blood you don't have to
[56:09] have those wings that they had he said
[56:12] there are special covering for them in
[56:13] that presence but you've got the blood
[56:15] of Jesus Christ for a covering to stand
[56:18] there he said now if you if you've got
[56:20] that blood he said then you honor God
[56:23] you love God you respect God and God is
[56:26] the word
[56:27] he said notice secondly with two Wings
[56:29] they covered their feet what did that
[56:30] mean humility before God and His
[56:32] presence and he goes into Moses and Paul
[56:34] and John and how they all showed
[56:36] humility before God he said here's a
[56:39] good example always be conscience
[56:41] of your littleness
[56:44] once you're in the presence of a big God
[56:47] high and lifted up
[56:49] this train fills the temple
[56:51] he said so be conscious
[56:53] of your littleness
[56:56] not your bigness
[56:58] he said today we Americans so much that
[57:00] we try to think we're big somebody
[57:02] we belong to Something Big some big
[57:04] organization he said oh great big big
[57:07] big is all we see
[57:09] brother Brown goes into that and he
[57:11] talks about Elijah in the cave with the
[57:13] still Small Voice and he said that if he
[57:15] typed that to Americans
[57:17] that we want something that that it's a
[57:19] fire or a flame or something like that
[57:21] but sometimes God don't move like that
[57:24] sometimes he can move that way
[57:27] but even when he does it's not the fire
[57:29] that's God or the earthquake or the
[57:31] flame that shows that you're in his
[57:32] presence but that's not that's not God
[57:34] but God spoke he used a still small
[57:37] voice
[57:38] and so again there's times when God he
[57:42] wants to show you his power
[57:44] and when he does that the cherubims and
[57:46] the angels are are screaming at the top
[57:48] of their voice holy
[57:50] it's the Lord God Almighty
[57:52] and other times he wants to speak
[57:56] and you have to let him do that by the
[57:58] way we don't get to pigeonhole God
[58:01] as far as how how we get saved or how we
[58:05] experience him
[58:07] Paul didn't get to pick his manner of
[58:10] conversion
[58:12] right Moses didn't get to pick how God
[58:14] would speak to him
[58:16] God chose a burning bush
[58:19] right and told him to take off his shoes
[58:20] he didn't get to say well I believe I'll
[58:22] take off my hat he didn't get to pick
[58:24] that
[58:25] you don't get to pick and so what we
[58:27] strive for in the church is not loudness
[58:30] but it's actually what we're striving
[58:32] for is freedom to be able to worship God
[58:35] in whatever way he would show himself to
[58:38] you
[58:39] can you see that tonight so we're not
[58:41] looking for people to uh just say well
[58:43] if we didn't run the house or or shout
[58:45] we didn't have a good service that's not
[58:47] it at all what we want is for God to be
[58:49] able to be God to be Lord to have
[58:51] preeminence in every part of the church
[58:53] so that if he wants to run he can run if
[58:56] he wants to scream he can scream if he
[58:58] wants to if he wants to worship he'd be
[59:00] worshiped he can be worshiped do you
[59:03] believe that today
[59:04] so if he wants to speak to you tonight
[59:06] speak directly to your heart and if it's
[59:09] so still and so quiet that it's a still
[59:12] whisper
[59:14] he can have that
[59:17] if that's what he wants
[59:20] because it's not about us
[59:22] now watch he said thirdly you just have
[59:25] to bear with me tonight I I'm just about
[59:27] I'm just about tired
[59:30] and uh
[59:31] you know he preached me to death and
[59:33] then expect me to come back and preach
[59:35] again you know
[59:37] we love we love those we love to hear
[59:40] the word don't we
[59:42] and some of it's my fault I've been
[59:44] traveling too now
[59:46] he said thirdly he could fly
[59:48] right and we're I'm using this as the
[59:50] background now to get where I want to go
[59:51] tonight so just hang with me
[59:53] he had to be put in action
[59:55] so he had to cover his face he had to be
[59:58] reverent humility before God and finally
[1:00:02] put himself into action
[1:00:03] he could fly with them two Wings he said
[1:00:06] two over his face two over his feet and
[1:00:08] flying with two now what was it
[1:00:09] reverence humility and inaction and
[1:00:13] brother random taught us that that was
[1:00:14] the hardest part was to be in action to
[1:00:17] be doing what God wants us to do to be
[1:00:19] led by the spirit of God
[1:00:21] now God again this was this view of God
[1:00:24] that the Old Testament Jew would have
[1:00:25] understood and and even during Jesus
[1:00:27] time during the days of the Pharisees
[1:00:30] and the Sadducees their God was a god of
[1:00:33] temples
[1:00:34] physical a physical Temple
[1:00:37] a God who came down and and parted a Red
[1:00:39] Sea
[1:00:40] a God who came physically and and
[1:00:43] brought a pillar of fire and when Elijah
[1:00:46] called for it and their God was this
[1:00:48] great God
[1:00:50] and they believed that even to be in his
[1:00:52] presence they wouldn't even speak His
[1:00:54] Name They removed the vowels because
[1:00:56] they were afraid to speak his name and
[1:00:59] even today they write it that way
[1:01:00] they're afraid to even write the entire
[1:01:02] name of God because they're afraid they
[1:01:04] would use it in vain they had a
[1:01:06] reverence for that kind of a God yeah
[1:01:08] but God didn't want to stay like that
[1:01:11] right now hear me just for a moment he
[1:01:13] wanted you to be able to talk to him he
[1:01:16] wanted to be approachable he wanted to
[1:01:19] be he wanted to fellowship with you he
[1:01:22] didn't call you just to so you could
[1:01:24] have this view of him in that way that's
[1:01:26] part of it but he wants you to
[1:01:28] Fellowship he wants to be approachable
[1:01:29] he wants to be a one-on-one so what does
[1:01:32] he do he comes he condescends to come
[1:01:34] down and as a man now they had
[1:01:37] difficulty seeing him as a man because
[1:01:40] now The Carpenter's son is claiming to
[1:01:43] be the Son of God and he's walking
[1:01:45] around doing Miracles but he's still The
[1:01:48] Carpenter's son
[1:01:49] and he's not in a throne room
[1:01:53] there's no cherubim flying around
[1:01:56] instead of
[1:01:57] oh God their God didn't need no
[1:01:59] counselors but here was a man walking
[1:02:01] around with 12 disciples who couldn't
[1:02:02] get along on anything
[1:02:06] constantly fussing and fighting and
[1:02:09] tearing and backbiting at one another
[1:02:10] just constantly they couldn't get along
[1:02:12] they they couldn't decide who was going
[1:02:14] to be the greatest and so here he is
[1:02:16] walking around with 12 men they were
[1:02:18] messing up they were falling they were
[1:02:20] doing things they shouldn't be doing and
[1:02:22] so he's looking at them none of them had
[1:02:23] the Holy Ghost by the way while he was
[1:02:24] here
[1:02:25] right so they were acting acting up and
[1:02:28] acting crazy and and people looked at
[1:02:30] that and said my goodness how could that
[1:02:32] be God how could it be good but it was
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:35] it was God showing himself now in a
[1:02:38] different form
[1:02:39] and he's going to be lifted up
[1:02:42] but not the way he was in Isaiah's
[1:02:45] vision
[1:02:46] in the temple he's going to be lifted up
[1:02:48] from the Earth
[1:02:50] oh my God now we know that man when he
[1:02:54] when God became man one of the ways that
[1:02:56] man falls is by Pride
[1:02:59] right that's how we fall that's how
[1:03:02] Satan felt it's how Uzziah fell
[1:03:05] if you read that story he fell out of
[1:03:07] Pride because he was the king surely he
[1:03:10] could go into the holy of holies but it
[1:03:12] wasn't his place
[1:03:14] Satan fell he said when he's speaking to
[1:03:17] Lucifer in Isaiah 14 thou had said in
[1:03:19] thine heart
[1:03:21] I will Ascend into heaven notice the
[1:03:24] language I will exalt my throne in other
[1:03:27] words I will be lifted up that's what
[1:03:28] lifted means in the Hebrews is exalted
[1:03:32] I will be exalted I will be lifted up my
[1:03:35] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:03:38] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[1:03:40] in the sides of the north I will Ascend
[1:03:43] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:03:47] be like the most high
[1:03:49] so Satan comes along and says I will be
[1:03:53] like the Creator
[1:03:54] the Creator who had reserved for himself
[1:03:57] this throne room
[1:03:58] whose train filled the temple no room
[1:04:00] for anybody else
[1:04:02] in that throne room
[1:04:04] only worshipers
[1:04:08] only worshipers oh my but there was no
[1:04:11] room for counselors or advisors or or a
[1:04:14] court of anybody else there's no room in
[1:04:16] it I tell you what it's still the same
[1:04:17] way today there's no room for any of
[1:04:19] that no one tells God what to do
[1:04:23] yeah right we we need counsel but we
[1:04:25] need counsel by the Holy Spirit we need
[1:04:27] advice we need the advice by the
[1:04:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:30] but now now watch what Satan says Satan
[1:04:34] says I will
[1:04:35] but Jesus said
[1:04:37] not my will
[1:04:40] right you see how similar the language
[1:04:42] is
[1:04:42] Satan says I will
[1:04:44] there's the difference in life and death
[1:04:47] there's a difference in being a real
[1:04:49] Christian
[1:04:51] and just being another uh another in the
[1:04:54] Heap of failed Christians
[1:04:58] I will
[1:05:00] I watched Satan I will be the pastor
[1:05:04] I will be a trustee
[1:05:06] I will do this I will make money
[1:05:11] I will I'm going to go I'm going to be
[1:05:13] the best of the greatest preacher in the
[1:05:15] message I'm going to go to the best
[1:05:16] church I'm going to sit in the great
[1:05:17] choir I'm going to be you know I will
[1:05:21] God has a way of taking us down a peg or
[1:05:23] two don't he
[1:05:26] but Jesus didn't say I will
[1:05:30] you hear me today
[1:05:32] he didn't say I will
[1:05:34] he said not my will
[1:05:37] it was not I will lift myself up
[1:05:41] but if it's your will for me to be
[1:05:43] lifted up
[1:05:44] on a cross
[1:05:47] not my will
[1:05:49] but time be done
[1:05:51] can you see the difference tonight
[1:05:53] not I will but not my will
[1:05:57] now watch Jesus heart was not lifted up
[1:06:01] his ego wasn't important
[1:06:03] but he allowed his flesh to be lifted up
[1:06:06] as an offering for sin
[1:06:09] he was so humble
[1:06:11] now watch it's a hard thing to hide all
[1:06:13] of God
[1:06:15] but Jesus successfully did it
[1:06:18] he was so humble see we have him by
[1:06:20] measure you realize brother Branham
[1:06:21] taught that we have him by measure he
[1:06:23] had him in his fullness
[1:06:25] we have the same quality but not the
[1:06:27] same quantity
[1:06:28] but he was all of God
[1:06:31] that's hard to hide
[1:06:33] but he successfully hid God
[1:06:37] from the eyes of the wise in prudence
[1:06:40] oh my they should have seen who he was
[1:06:42] but he hit him because he was so humble
[1:06:45] that he come in a manger and only the
[1:06:48] Shepherds the lowest of the of the
[1:06:51] workers in that day that could come down
[1:06:52] and see
[1:06:53] who he was
[1:06:55] now watch
[1:06:57] so he would be glorified
[1:06:59] but first he had to be lifted up in a
[1:07:01] different way
[1:07:02] from the earth listen John 3 14 as Moses
[1:07:06] watch lifted up the serpent in the
[1:07:08] wilderness even so
[1:07:12] look what he's comparing himself to
[1:07:15] you know what's always bothered me that
[1:07:17] type
[1:07:18] because you're looking at Jesus the
[1:07:20] Flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:07:23] and saying it's a brass serpent
[1:07:28] we don't even like think about our own
[1:07:29] flesh that way
[1:07:31] and this was the perfect sinless Christ
[1:07:34] that flesh had never been sinned in
[1:07:37] mine has
[1:07:39] yours has probably today
[1:07:42] but this was a flesh
[1:07:44] that was virgin born
[1:07:47] created by God in the womb of Mary
[1:07:51] both the blood cell and the Egg he
[1:07:53] created it by God
[1:07:55] created it created himself brother
[1:07:57] Brandon said I love that God created
[1:08:00] himself in the womb of a woman
[1:08:05] called Mary
[1:08:06] and when he did that God he said as
[1:08:09] Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:08:12] in the wilderness
[1:08:13] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:08:17] look at the type
[1:08:19] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:08:21] not perish but have eternal life listen
[1:08:24] if the if the most sinless the most
[1:08:26] perfect flesh that ever was had to be
[1:08:29] crucified
[1:08:31] what do you think has to happen to yours
[1:08:34] flesh and blood is not going to inherit
[1:08:36] the kingdom of God
[1:08:38] this corruption must put on incorruption
[1:08:42] this Mortal must put on immortality we
[1:08:45] can't go like we are that's why we call
[1:08:47] it a body change
[1:08:49] because this flesh there is nothing good
[1:08:51] Paul said there is absolutely nothing
[1:08:53] good in my flesh nothing and he had
[1:08:56] prayed for the sick and seen the the the
[1:08:58] death here and the blind sea and seen
[1:09:01] Miracles and visions and everything else
[1:09:03] and he said there's nothing good in it
[1:09:05] all wretched man that I am
[1:09:08] why could he say that because he knew it
[1:09:10] was a snake it was a serpent
[1:09:13] oh God
[1:09:15] it has to be a new body
[1:09:17] aren't you glad you have one already
[1:09:18] waiting
[1:09:19] a word body that's in that image of the
[1:09:21] original thought
[1:09:23] now watch
[1:09:25] he said even so much the son of man be
[1:09:27] lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[1:09:29] him should not perish but have eternal
[1:09:31] life
[1:09:32] so the way to glorification was by the
[1:09:34] lifting up of the Cross John 12 20 says
[1:09:37] there were certain Greeks among them
[1:09:39] that came up to worship at the feast
[1:09:41] now watch your Gentiles coming to see
[1:09:44] Jesus and they the same there came there
[1:09:47] for the Philip which was the baseda of
[1:09:48] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[1:09:52] would see Jesus now brother Brandon
[1:09:53] preaches a sermon of that title and it's
[1:09:55] actually he's doing more than just
[1:09:56] preaching a healing service he's telling
[1:09:58] us that there's Gentiles coming to see
[1:10:01] Christ and he's showing us that it's the
[1:10:03] revealing of the son of man that God
[1:10:05] reserved that for the Gentile age he
[1:10:07] didn't show that to them then
[1:10:09] right he didn't go to them but he came
[1:10:11] in this day and revealed the son of man
[1:10:13] to us right and showed us a sign of the
[1:10:16] Resurrection but there were certain
[1:10:18] Greeks that come up to worship at the
[1:10:19] feast and he said the same came there
[1:10:21] for the Philip which is of the set of
[1:10:22] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[1:10:25] would see Jesus Philip cometh and
[1:10:27] telleth Andrew and again Andrew and
[1:10:29] Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[1:10:32] them saying the hour has come that the
[1:10:34] son of man should be glorified
[1:10:37] oh my God so now he's saying for the
[1:10:40] benefit of you Gentiles a few Greeks
[1:10:42] The Hours come the son of man should be
[1:10:44] glorified verily verily I sent you
[1:10:46] except a corn of wheat Fallen to the
[1:10:48] ground and die
[1:10:50] it abideth alone but if it died it
[1:10:52] brings forth much fruit
[1:10:54] he that lose loveth
[1:10:57] can't speak tonight he that loveth his
[1:11:00] life shall lose it are you still with me
[1:11:02] tonight
[1:11:03] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:11:05] world shall keep it unto life eternal If
[1:11:08] any man serve me let him follow me and
[1:11:11] where I am there shall also my servant
[1:11:13] be if any man served me him one of my
[1:11:16] father honor Now watch how he's taking
[1:11:18] it from from this high God that's high
[1:11:20] and lifted up but that's the father in
[1:11:22] in that in that expectation that they
[1:11:24] had for him but now when the father came
[1:11:27] and dwelt in a body of Flesh what was he
[1:11:29] doing he humbled himself to the death of
[1:11:31] the Cross now watch he said now is my
[1:11:34] soul trouble and what shall I say father
[1:11:37] save me from this hour
[1:11:39] but for this cause came I into this hour
[1:11:43] father glorify thy name
[1:11:46] then came there a voice from Heaven
[1:11:48] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:11:52] glorify it again
[1:11:54] the people therefore that stood by and
[1:11:56] heard it said that it thundered others
[1:11:57] said an angel spake to him Jesus
[1:11:59] answered and said this voice came not
[1:12:00] because of me but for your sakes now is
[1:12:03] the Judgment of this world now shall the
[1:12:05] prince of this world be cast out now
[1:12:07] watch and I if I be lifted up from the
[1:12:10] Earth
[1:12:11] we'll draw all men unto me this he said
[1:12:13] signifying what death he should die and
[1:12:17] there's many types and things we could
[1:12:18] make in there but I can't do it to save
[1:12:20] time tonight so you can go and study it
[1:12:22] for yourself but but now he said the
[1:12:25] people answered him and said we have
[1:12:26] heard now what's their reaction to this
[1:12:28] we have heard out of the law that Christ
[1:12:31] abideth forever
[1:12:33] he's not the kind of a god a kind of a
[1:12:35] this Messiah this anointed in one would
[1:12:38] not be one who would die
[1:12:40] right he's Immortal he's the son of God
[1:12:43] right right he is God
[1:12:46] yes it's the relationship with Messiah
[1:12:48] to God he is God
[1:12:49] and so he they said we have heard that
[1:12:53] Christ abideth forever and how sayest
[1:12:55] thou the son of man must be lifted up
[1:12:58] who is this son of man
[1:13:00] oh they couldn't understand him they
[1:13:02] couldn't see it they couldn't see it the
[1:13:04] Way Up Is Down
[1:13:07] the way the glorification goes through
[1:13:09] the cross
[1:13:10] it goes through Calvary
[1:13:13] oh what a lesson that is for us
[1:13:15] then Jesus said unto them yet a little
[1:13:17] while is the light with you walk while
[1:13:19] you have the light let Darkness come
[1:13:20] upon you for he that walketh in darkness
[1:13:22] knoweth not whether he goeth while you
[1:13:24] have light believe in the light that you
[1:13:25] may be children of light he said these
[1:13:27] things fake Jesus and departed and did
[1:13:29] hide himself from them so the Way Up Is
[1:13:31] Down Philippians 2 and 5 said let this
[1:13:34] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:13:35] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:13:37] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:13:40] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:13:43] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:13:46] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:13:48] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:13:50] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:13:52] death even the death of the cross
[1:13:56] listen the Way Up Is Down
[1:13:57] you've heard that haven't you brother
[1:13:59] Branham deals with that a lot in the
[1:14:01] message and I want to deal with that for
[1:14:02] just a moment because this is how we get
[1:14:05] where we want to go
[1:14:08] excuse me this is
[1:14:11] we get up
[1:14:14] this is how we gain our position
[1:14:17] it's not by fighting and clawing and you
[1:14:20] say well I'd like to do something in the
[1:14:22] church well you don't gain that position
[1:14:24] by fighting for it by by putting it
[1:14:28] stepping on the necks of other people
[1:14:29] for it
[1:14:30] well I'd like to sing more I'd like to
[1:14:32] preach more I'd like to do this more you
[1:14:34] don't get that by climbing over other
[1:14:36] people
[1:14:37] but what do you do you get it by being
[1:14:39] little
[1:14:40] and you get small enough where you can
[1:14:42] be a servant that's when God can use you
[1:14:45] are you with me tonight
[1:14:48] amen the Way Up Is Down
[1:14:50] brother said he that humbles himself
[1:14:52] shall be exalted he exhausts himself
[1:14:53] shall be abased humbled himself don't
[1:14:55] try to be a big something
[1:14:57] Now watch how he says this though don't
[1:14:59] try to be big a big something try to be
[1:15:01] a little something be what you are
[1:15:05] now think about it let's go back to that
[1:15:08] go back one
[1:15:11] he said don't try to be a big something
[1:15:14] or try to be a little something people
[1:15:16] listen to it
[1:15:18] don't try to be a big something or try
[1:15:19] to be a little something
[1:15:23] I got somebody off guard didn't I
[1:15:26] be what you are
[1:15:28] be what you are
[1:15:31] but but you're not elevating yourself
[1:15:32] you're being what you are you're not
[1:15:34] trying to be little it flows
[1:15:36] are you hearing me it comes out of your
[1:15:38] nature
[1:15:39] you're a Christian that's what
[1:15:41] Christians do they're like Christ you're
[1:15:44] not trying to be and you see brother
[1:15:46] Brown was talking about people that
[1:15:47] would be uh humble in a proud way
[1:15:51] right if you ever got really humble then
[1:15:53] you'd be so proud of it you know and
[1:15:55] tell everybody about it and and be at
[1:15:58] pride in your humility so he said don't
[1:15:59] try to be a little something or try to
[1:16:00] be a little or a big something but be
[1:16:02] what you are he said be little in the
[1:16:04] sight of God belittle in your own sight
[1:16:07] everybody else is above you
[1:16:13] well it's a hard sermon on
[1:16:15] three o'clock four o'clock on Sunday
[1:16:17] afternoon isn't it
[1:16:19] who all did he say was above us well the
[1:16:22] pastor
[1:16:23] the Evangelist the prophet
[1:16:26] everybody
[1:16:30] pretty low isn't it
[1:16:33] everybody is above you
[1:16:37] you put everybody else first
[1:16:39] so I was saying God first family second
[1:16:43] work
[1:16:45] somewhere in there
[1:16:46] church somewhere in there everybody else
[1:16:49] somewhere in there
[1:16:52] you last
[1:16:54] night oh God that's different from this
[1:16:56] age isn't it
[1:16:58] the selfie would have never been
[1:17:00] invented
[1:17:02] if we realized everybody was above us
[1:17:07] let him be the greatest among you be
[1:17:09] ministered to all
[1:17:11] he said who can be greater than Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ who girded himself and washed the
[1:17:15] disciples feet a foot washing funky
[1:17:20] come
[1:17:21] the god of Heaven the creator of heavens
[1:17:24] and earth washing dirty feet for
[1:17:26] fishermen
[1:17:28] with manure and stuff and dust off the
[1:17:31] roads where their garments had swept it
[1:17:33] up and washing it off a foot washing
[1:17:35] flunky what he was I didn't never really
[1:17:37] understand this brother Joel until we
[1:17:39] went to Egypt and they wear those same
[1:17:40] long garments the farmers do even today
[1:17:43] and they walk down those same those same
[1:17:46] Dusty roads and the dust on those roads
[1:17:48] is not dirt
[1:17:52] huh
[1:17:53] it's manure
[1:17:55] because they have so many animals have
[1:17:57] passed over it donkeys and camels and
[1:18:00] everything that they have there past the
[1:18:01] horses it's all passed over it and so
[1:18:03] it's just it just lays there nobody
[1:18:05] picks it up
[1:18:06] they don't have street sweepers
[1:18:08] there's not somebody falling like they
[1:18:10] do in a parade with a little bucket and
[1:18:12] and a shovel there ain't nobody doing
[1:18:14] that
[1:18:15] it's all in the in the dirt
[1:18:17] and so and and they would have sandals
[1:18:20] on and and the long garments and the
[1:18:23] bottom of those garments gets very dirty
[1:18:24] and everything underneath not just the
[1:18:26] feet but the bottom part of the legs
[1:18:28] gets so filthy
[1:18:30] by walking around but they would walk
[1:18:32] for miles and miles and miles
[1:18:35] just like Jesus going to Simon's house
[1:18:37] walked for Miles maybe it took him a
[1:18:39] better part of a day to get there then
[1:18:41] he gets there and there's no one there
[1:18:42] to wash his feet
[1:18:44] oh God
[1:18:46] but Jesus who who the Pharisees didn't
[1:18:49] think he was important enough to make
[1:18:52] sure he got his feet washed
[1:18:54] but that same God
[1:18:56] he was God in flesh that same God
[1:18:59] condescended to come down and his
[1:19:01] disciples the same ones who were
[1:19:03] bickering and fighting and fussing and
[1:19:05] carrying on those same men
[1:19:07] that same God came down among them he
[1:19:10] got him in a room and washed their feet
[1:19:19] Simon who would betray him
[1:19:22] knowing that he would
[1:19:24] still washed his feet
[1:19:26] oh God give me an attitude like that
[1:19:30] wanted to fellowship with people who
[1:19:32] would all flee from him
[1:19:35] who would all fall asleep during the
[1:19:37] service that night
[1:19:39] oh
[1:19:40] they would all fall asleep every one of
[1:19:43] them that's more than what's to sleep
[1:19:44] here tonight
[1:19:46] even the ones he chose to come up there
[1:19:48] with him the few that he chose to come
[1:19:50] up with him they were asleep The Chosen
[1:19:53] Few Peter James and John laying there
[1:19:55] snoring
[1:19:57] well Jesus is fighting his greatest
[1:19:59] battle
[1:20:01] Gethsemane
[1:20:03] he washed their feet
[1:20:06] knowing they would do that
[1:20:08] oh God
[1:20:10] he said a foot wash funky is what he was
[1:20:12] then we think we're somebody
[1:20:14] we got to be doctor PhD so and so Oh my
[1:20:17] he said that ain't Christ that don't
[1:20:19] display the lovely Jesus Christ he
[1:20:21] became servant to to how many to all
[1:20:26] to all
[1:20:28] you want to learn how to preach
[1:20:31] you want to learn how to Pastor you want
[1:20:33] to learn how to be an evangelist you
[1:20:34] want to learn how to be a Sunday school
[1:20:36] teacher or a deacon take care of people
[1:20:41] you want to learn how to be a father
[1:20:43] huh how to be a mother take care of
[1:20:46] people
[1:20:50] now watch if you want any position
[1:20:53] take care of people because that's what
[1:20:55] it's about it's not about the chairs
[1:20:58] it's not about the about the floor it's
[1:21:01] not about the ceiling or the other
[1:21:02] instruments are or or the streaming or
[1:21:05] anything else it's about the people
[1:21:08] and he taught us an example that we
[1:21:11] should do to one another as he did unto
[1:21:14] us he said oh that's my Lord what makes
[1:21:17] him big because he made himself little
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:21] that's why by the game sometimes it's
[1:21:22] hard to do certain things
[1:21:25] it's hard to go certain places because
[1:21:27] we know we won't be received
[1:21:29] but when Jesus was invited to go down to
[1:21:33] to the place where he knew he would not
[1:21:35] be received he would not be welcomed
[1:21:37] when he was invited he went because
[1:21:40] Jesus keeps all his appointments yes
[1:21:43] are you with me tonight taught us that
[1:21:46] example
[1:21:48] but I won't go down there and they never
[1:21:49] invited me up to preach
[1:21:51] they never had me closed in prayer
[1:21:54] I'm preaching to myself tonight
[1:21:56] he said well that's that shouldn't
[1:21:58] bother you it does
[1:21:59] you're human
[1:22:01] it does bother they don't ever use me
[1:22:03] they don't ever do that go anyway
[1:22:06] then you'll be like Christ
[1:22:08] right anybody can love those who love
[1:22:11] them he said the publicans do that the
[1:22:13] tax collectors
[1:22:15] can love one another but who will love
[1:22:17] the tax collector
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] man he said oh he said that's my Lord
[1:22:23] what makes him big because he made
[1:22:26] himself
[1:22:27] little
[1:22:29] yeah oh my
[1:22:31] now brother Branham goes on he talks
[1:22:33] about how the person who made the
[1:22:34] artificial tooth made himself a
[1:22:36] reputation but the person who made
[1:22:38] himself a real tooth has no reputation
[1:22:40] a person who made an artificial leg made
[1:22:42] a reputation put his name on it
[1:22:45] but the person who made the real the
[1:22:47] real leg he made himself of no
[1:22:49] reputation
[1:22:51] but the writer says the Way Up Is Down
[1:22:52] always remember that be humble be sweet
[1:22:54] and kind be creative
[1:22:57] creative let Christ be in you and he
[1:22:59] goes on to talk about how you create an
[1:23:01] atmosphere wherever you go
[1:23:03] be creative
[1:23:05] he said now what was he yesterday now if
[1:23:08] he was a great rich man yesterday he
[1:23:09] would be a great rich man today but when
[1:23:12] he come yesterday we find out he didn't
[1:23:13] even have a place to lay his head he
[1:23:15] said that's right the birds of the air
[1:23:16] have nests the foxes has dense but I
[1:23:18] don't even have a place to lay my head
[1:23:19] when he come to the world he borrowed a
[1:23:22] womb to be born in they had no Cradle to
[1:23:24] lay him in so they laid him in a box of
[1:23:25] straw when he died he was nailed to a
[1:23:27] Roman Tree under capital punishment he
[1:23:30] had one robe to put on had been made for
[1:23:32] him walked throughout without a seam he
[1:23:34] had to borrow a grave to be buried in he
[1:23:37] said there's none of us that bad off
[1:23:39] and again we're not you don't have to
[1:23:40] attempt to be something that you're not
[1:23:42] God bless you with the ability to make
[1:23:44] money he didn't bless me with that but
[1:23:45] if he blessed you with that you know
[1:23:47] that's wonderful but it's not that it's
[1:23:50] it's it's being what you are and
[1:23:51] recognizing that everybody else is above
[1:23:54] you
[1:23:55] even if you can make money
[1:23:57] even if you can
[1:23:59] sing
[1:24:01] or preach
[1:24:04] huh
[1:24:05] everybody else is still above you
[1:24:09] he had one robe to put on
[1:24:11] he didn't have a grave to be buried in
[1:24:13] he had to borrow one he come to show us
[1:24:15] what God was anything that's high and
[1:24:17] hot he isn't God God is low and humble
[1:24:20] that's what made him God see something
[1:24:22] that comes low not them that goes high
[1:24:24] God doesn't dwell in hierarchies
[1:24:29] study on that for a while
[1:24:31] God doesn't dwell in hierarchies
[1:24:35] and thinks he dwells in humility that's
[1:24:38] why he made every Pastor Sovereign every
[1:24:41] Church Sovereign in the way that we deal
[1:24:43] with things now we're under God we're
[1:24:45] under the Holy Ghost but we're not under
[1:24:47] other pastors why because God wants to
[1:24:50] be able to deal with the little Humble
[1:24:51] Church like he does the big church
[1:24:54] and it's the same God being in the
[1:24:56] leadership
[1:24:57] right he said well my pastor is well
[1:24:59] he's led by God hopefully
[1:25:01] so is mine
[1:25:03] right every one of us can say that if
[1:25:05] you have a pastor your pastor is led by
[1:25:07] God I hope so if not you can find
[1:25:08] another pastor right but I trust that
[1:25:11] your pastor is led by God and we and
[1:25:13] that I'm led by God if so we're on the
[1:25:15] same level
[1:25:16] right right
[1:25:17] now watch
[1:25:19] and again if we're that way then we
[1:25:21] shouldn't bother us what happens to us
[1:25:23] but brother Ben I went to the meeting
[1:25:25] and they
[1:25:26] they didn't let me pray for the people
[1:25:28] they only give me the little cases
[1:25:30] that's all right
[1:25:31] somebody else probably had more faith
[1:25:34] well they didn't seek me up with the
[1:25:35] preachers they sent me back somewhere
[1:25:37] else that's okay they really knew me
[1:25:39] they probably wouldn't set me there
[1:25:40] either they probably sent me outside
[1:25:41] somewhere
[1:25:44] I'm just being honest with you
[1:25:46] yeah right and someone said that you
[1:25:48] know people talk about me said whatever
[1:25:50] it is it's not as bad as what I know
[1:25:52] come talk to me for a while
[1:25:54] huh
[1:25:57] all right
[1:25:58] you want to know some more I mean
[1:25:59] there's more but I'm a sinner saved by
[1:26:02] grace
[1:26:03] I'm a child of the king I'm a virtuous
[1:26:06] sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:09] amen who can bring a charge against
[1:26:12] God's elect
[1:26:13] nobody can
[1:26:15] hey man Hallelujah he said let him deny
[1:26:18] himself
[1:26:19] and follow me if any man
[1:26:22] will come after me let him deny himself
[1:26:26] take up his cross daily yes and follow
[1:26:30] me
[1:26:32] I forgot to start my timer just bear
[1:26:34] with me just a moment I think I'm almost
[1:26:35] out of time
[1:26:37] if you're cold and starchy now watch I
[1:26:39] want you to watch something God will not
[1:26:41] just let you be dealt with in the way
[1:26:44] you want to be dealt with see he's got
[1:26:46] to get you to crucify your flesh
[1:26:49] and so if you're the cold and starchy
[1:26:51] type individual God may actually come to
[1:26:53] you and he's not necessarily going to
[1:26:55] say okay you just sit there and I'll
[1:26:57] just fill you with the Holy Ghost but
[1:26:59] he's probably going to make you do
[1:27:00] something you're uncomfortable with
[1:27:03] right and it's also true that if you're
[1:27:05] the type of person who just loves to
[1:27:06] have a good old time run around the
[1:27:08] church God may wait and speak to you in
[1:27:10] a still small voice
[1:27:12] right because he wants to break down
[1:27:15] that flesh
[1:27:16] right because it's the flesh that has
[1:27:18] that preference that's not in the spirit
[1:27:19] that's in the flesh and so when we begin
[1:27:22] to look like that we begin to say well
[1:27:23] you know in my church we have it a
[1:27:25] certain way or this other Church there a
[1:27:27] different way but God wants to meet you
[1:27:29] where you're at but he won't necessarily
[1:27:31] it's not necessarily the hill you can
[1:27:34] come as you are and stay as you are you
[1:27:36] can come as you are but then he wants to
[1:27:37] change you
[1:27:39] he wants to make a servant out of you
[1:27:43] so if you come if you're the type of
[1:27:44] person that maybe you need to speak in
[1:27:46] tongues
[1:27:48] you just don't ever make a move
[1:27:50] that's scary Church
[1:27:53] never make a move toward God maybe you
[1:27:54] need to speak in tongues maybe you need
[1:27:55] to cry
[1:27:56] maybe you need to get down on an altar
[1:27:58] and just make a mess
[1:28:00] it's a birth is a mess
[1:28:03] but if it just comes naturally to you
[1:28:06] you can I've seen little kids in
[1:28:07] Pentecostal churches when I was growing
[1:28:08] up we'd go to Pentecost church a little
[1:28:10] bit of kids all speaking in tongues
[1:28:11] playing hands on you you had to hide
[1:28:13] from them they come a little gang of
[1:28:14] kids
[1:28:15] wandering around laying hands during the
[1:28:17] service speaking in tongues
[1:28:20] well we might be too good to have that
[1:28:22] but you know you know if you're cold and
[1:28:24] starchy again that comes naturally to
[1:28:27] some people but being like that comes
[1:28:29] naturally to some people but he wants to
[1:28:31] break you
[1:28:33] all right God
[1:28:37] now watch
[1:28:38] the new birth is a mess
[1:28:42] it breaks you
[1:28:44] I've told you before we don't come to
[1:28:46] the altar looking for something to get
[1:28:48] something we come to the altar to give
[1:28:51] up something
[1:28:53] and so many people misunderstand that
[1:28:55] and so they come and they wait because
[1:28:56] they say Lord give me something give me
[1:28:58] something no you come to give up
[1:28:59] something if you're not getting what you
[1:29:01] came for it's because there's a there's
[1:29:04] a problem with the flesh right and we
[1:29:06] all have it that you need to break you
[1:29:09] need to break through that that veil of
[1:29:10] the Flesh and then you can see the
[1:29:12] angels and brother Brandon said standing
[1:29:13] around but the Brandon said that so the
[1:29:16] new birth is a mess it's but it produces
[1:29:18] life it produces life what kind of Life
[1:29:20] servant life
[1:29:21] he said to humble yourself to deny
[1:29:23] yourself that's the kind of life oh they
[1:29:25] say but I've seen them cry and boo
[1:29:26] around the Altar and carry on sure
[1:29:28] they're being born it's a mess he said
[1:29:30] that you might get up your face all full
[1:29:32] of tears your eyes red your hands raw
[1:29:33] from beating on the altar but it's a
[1:29:35] birth yeah
[1:29:36] yeah it does something to you it makes
[1:29:38] you a servant
[1:29:39] it takes the starch out of you
[1:29:42] it makes image molding New Life
[1:29:46] New Creation you may be all messed up
[1:29:49] when you get up but you're born again
[1:29:51] aren't you glad for the new birth today
[1:29:53] you may be all messed up but you're born
[1:29:55] again no matter where you are it makes a
[1:29:57] new life it brings a new image to life
[1:29:59] it makes a servant out of you you want
[1:30:01] to serve then Jesus wants us to serve
[1:30:03] one another love one another and as we
[1:30:05] serve each other we serve him
[1:30:10] Mark 10 45 the even the son of man came
[1:30:12] not to be ministered unto
[1:30:14] to minister
[1:30:16] that word is not a word of Honor by the
[1:30:19] way Minister means servant
[1:30:24] he gave his life a ransom for many
[1:30:26] aren't you glad that he did
[1:30:29] now remember now watch if if you
[1:30:34] I got to get through this fine clothes
[1:30:38] brother random taught us there's only
[1:30:39] the sick that demands attention
[1:30:41] you realize that and I'm not condemning
[1:30:43] you for that but if you're a person that
[1:30:45] demands attention on yourself you're
[1:30:47] sick
[1:30:48] you have a sickness a spiritual sickness
[1:30:52] and and you need help right I'm not
[1:30:54] condemning you for that you have to be
[1:30:56] in the spotlight all the time you need
[1:30:58] help
[1:30:59] the sick demand attention
[1:31:02] right if you're in the hospital you
[1:31:04] demand attention you can't get up
[1:31:06] they're gonna come feed you they got to
[1:31:08] come change out the IV or whatever that
[1:31:11] it is if you've ever been in a hospital
[1:31:13] that they're taking care of you you're
[1:31:14] just laying there
[1:31:16] and so you're a sick person you're
[1:31:19] demand attention but if you do that at
[1:31:20] home your wife's going to say something
[1:31:24] right if you lay around at home feeding
[1:31:28] me honey
[1:31:30] I hope that don't sound too similar
[1:31:32] Brittany
[1:31:34] too familiar
[1:31:37] feed me just just put it in an IV
[1:31:39] bit in my veins bring me my coffee and
[1:31:43] you just expect to lay there you're
[1:31:44] needy
[1:31:45] right you're sick
[1:31:47] now when we get sick we like to make the
[1:31:49] most of it but you can't stay sick
[1:31:51] forever
[1:31:52] I realize there's some people have
[1:31:53] long-term illness that's not what I'm
[1:31:54] talking about but but spiritually now
[1:31:57] right now look what you're look what you
[1:31:59] are when you always demand attention
[1:32:02] and how do you know that you do that
[1:32:03] well you get your feelings hurt when you
[1:32:05] don't get it
[1:32:08] he said the sick they demand attention
[1:32:10] and when you see a preacher he said and
[1:32:12] may I not only limit it to a preacher
[1:32:14] but may I limit it to every church
[1:32:16] member that wants attention
[1:32:18] I'm somebody he said just remember
[1:32:20] there's a spiritual sick person now
[1:32:22] remember it does it doesn't mean that
[1:32:24] they don't need help they do need help
[1:32:25] he said they are needing attention
[1:32:27] but the attention they need is not what
[1:32:29] they think they need
[1:32:30] he said they need the attention of the
[1:32:33] spirit of God
[1:32:34] to give them something that'll take that
[1:32:36] attitude out of them heal them from
[1:32:39] their selfishness and big ideas and big
[1:32:41] me and little you he said the Holy Ghost
[1:32:42] makes us all the same what did Isaiah do
[1:32:45] when he saw him high and lifted up
[1:32:47] it made him conscious of his own
[1:32:50] littleness
[1:32:52] verse five Isaiah 6 5 then said I woe is
[1:32:55] me for I am undone I am a man of unclean
[1:32:58] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[1:33:00] people of unclean lips because mine eyes
[1:33:03] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[1:33:07] and one of the seraphims flew to him
[1:33:09] having a live coal in his hand which
[1:33:11] he'd taken with the tongues from off the
[1:33:12] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:33:14] said Lo this has touched thy lips that
[1:33:17] iniquity is taken away in thy sin Purge
[1:33:19] what did that experience do to Isaiah
[1:33:24] and made him a servant
[1:33:26] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:33:28] saying whom shall I send
[1:33:30] who will go for us
[1:33:33] and I said
[1:33:35] here am I
[1:33:38] I don't have a lot of room for great big
[1:33:41] Productions
[1:33:44] that don't make people servants
[1:33:47] we try to do the very best we can with
[1:33:50] the music and and with the streaming and
[1:33:52] with the seating and and that we do the
[1:33:54] best we can to keep the church clean but
[1:33:56] I don't have much room for a big
[1:33:58] production
[1:33:59] that doesn't make people servants
[1:34:02] that when they leave the building
[1:34:03] they've been in the presence of God they
[1:34:06] say Lord where would you send me
[1:34:10] here am I didn't come here just to get
[1:34:14] help
[1:34:15] come here to be a servant
[1:34:17] I didn't come here just to be healed but
[1:34:20] I come here to be healed so I can serve
[1:34:24] oh God I didn't come here to be Affirmed
[1:34:27] I come here to be an affirmation to
[1:34:29] others
[1:34:31] I don't want to continue remaining in a
[1:34:33] place where I'm constantly taking in you
[1:34:35] realize the Dead Sea is dead because it
[1:34:37] has no Outlet
[1:34:39] it constantly takes in and takes in and
[1:34:42] takes in and when when it has no Outlet
[1:34:43] there's no way for the minerals to leave
[1:34:46] and so it becomes more salty every year
[1:34:48] until there's no life left in it don't
[1:34:51] you realize that's what Satan wants to
[1:34:52] do to you he wants to make it where
[1:34:53] you're not a servant you never do
[1:34:55] nothing for nobody and so you come and
[1:34:57] sit in the presence of God and you sit
[1:34:59] there thinking well I'm somebody
[1:35:00] preacher preach to me I deserve a good
[1:35:02] preacher no we all don't deserve nothing
[1:35:04] we never deserve to hear the gospel
[1:35:07] twice when there's somebody that's heard
[1:35:09] it once but I'm so glad he graciously
[1:35:11] comes down and gives us the word of God
[1:35:14] gives us his word gives us ministers
[1:35:16] gives us pastors gives us evangelists
[1:35:19] gave us his word to read gave us things
[1:35:22] so we could listen to and we could hear
[1:35:24] we could know
[1:35:29] Isaiah he says
[1:35:32] he says I finally come to that place I
[1:35:34] can be led by God I know what it's like
[1:35:36] to be in the presence of God
[1:35:38] and that makes me realize how sinful I
[1:35:41] am
[1:35:41] and once I'm perched
[1:35:44] here I am
[1:35:46] send me
[1:35:48] send me to the neighborhood
[1:35:51] send me to the Church Fellowship Hall
[1:35:57] send me to the foyer
[1:35:59] send me Lord
[1:36:01] we don't get this
[1:36:02] he may send you to Africa
[1:36:04] he may send me he may send you to the
[1:36:06] Philippines I've been to Africa I've
[1:36:07] been to the Philippines we just got back
[1:36:09] from Egypt this year but he may send you
[1:36:11] there but when you go go as a servant
[1:36:16] go as a servant
[1:36:19] because there's people there don't ever
[1:36:21] have the opportunity to hear like we do
[1:36:22] but let's be servants yes
[1:36:24] we got the money let's use that to help
[1:36:27] them we got the ability we got the
[1:36:28] numbers let's let's use it if we've got
[1:36:30] even the way we have church and things
[1:36:32] like that some of them don't understand
[1:36:33] but let's use let's be an example
[1:36:37] yeah that's good to be servants who did
[1:36:39] Ellie Easter look for musicians go ahead
[1:36:41] and come who did Elisa look for
[1:36:44] when you come down and it's a very
[1:36:46] serious business he's got to choose a
[1:36:48] wife for Isaac
[1:36:50] what kind of wife would Isaac want
[1:36:53] does he want a jezebel
[1:36:56] saw some painted face Jezebel
[1:36:59] he knew that wouldn't work
[1:37:01] does he want some uh some woman of
[1:37:04] stature and commanding presence and a
[1:37:06] great train and a great a great dress
[1:37:08] and walking he knew that wouldn't work
[1:37:10] so he goes to the well
[1:37:13] where he knew the women would come out
[1:37:16] right it's like going to a youth meeting
[1:37:18] that's where you all the girls are
[1:37:21] he goes to the well
[1:37:24] right there's nothing wrong with that
[1:37:26] I'd rather do that and go down to the
[1:37:27] high school
[1:37:28] not nearly as many bride servants at the
[1:37:31] high school or you wouldn't think so
[1:37:32] anyway maybe
[1:37:35] come out of the world first
[1:37:39] please get to dating them
[1:37:42] but look here comes a
[1:37:45] here comes a woman
[1:37:47] and he said Lord
[1:37:48] How will I know the right one
[1:37:50] How Will I Know One
[1:37:52] that is fit
[1:37:54] to be with Isaac
[1:37:57] said let me the one
[1:37:58] that when I asked for a drink she'll say
[1:38:01] I'll give you a drink
[1:38:03] and let me draw for the camels now
[1:38:05] that's a big step she can take a cup of
[1:38:07] water take it out of her bucket and just
[1:38:09] pass it to him give you a drink
[1:38:12] but he had a whole herd of camels
[1:38:15] you realize how much work it was
[1:38:20] she had to be a servant pouring water to
[1:38:23] camels that can drink and they just
[1:38:25] walked across the desert they can drink
[1:38:26] gallon after gallon after gallon she
[1:38:29] might have been there for hours
[1:38:31] she got nothing out of it
[1:38:34] he didn't know that she it was just her
[1:38:36] nature
[1:38:37] he wasn't doing that to impress Isaac it
[1:38:40] was just her nature to be a servant
[1:38:42] oh God let that be my nature today
[1:38:44] there's the true bride someone who in
[1:38:47] the Holy Ghost comes down let me be a
[1:38:49] servant brother said she was watering
[1:38:51] the very power that would take her home

[1:38:56] take us home let us be servants in the
