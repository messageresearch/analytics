foreign [Music] it gives me faith that I can make it after all aren't you thankful that's the kind of faith that we need tonight that we're going to make it regardless of what comes our way regardless of what life would throw at us we're going to make it I think we could just that would do us a lot of good just to confess that don't you think so and if we could let's just bow our heads just for a few moments just invite the Lord to come Heavenly Father Lord as we we come this evening Lord I just ask you would just come and speak to these people Lord I pray you just help us to lay aside everything Lord that would that would be a hindrance to us to hear your word Lord anything that would come between us Lord and you that that we need to cast down lord I pray you would just come Lord in a special way tonight Lord move me aside Lord where the people can receive something from you tonight oh God I pray you just anoint the hearers Lord and anoint my lips as well to say something Lord that would be of value to these people Lord Lord and I just pray that we could go away saying Lord it was good to be in the house of the Lord and that we received a blessing from you we want to thank you we ask you all these things in Jesus name amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight tell you what if you're here on a night like this I'd say you wanted to be here so if you could let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 and verse 8. and I'll try not to hold you long I'll set my timer this time my brother text me and reminded me to do that so so I guess pastor's orders are not to hold you too long First Peter chapter 5 and verse 8 it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you and if we could go over to Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 Ephesians 6 and verse 10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil and if we could skip down to verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loin skirt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word and just tonight I was studying along the thought of the greatest battle ever fought and I know many of you you've all heard that message that brother Brandon preached the greatest battle ever fought and brother Branham tells us very clearly that the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind can you say Amen to that and so the greatest battle today I believe that we're still fighting is spiritual warfare and it is a constant battle in the mind because without the holy spirit in you there's nothing to counter the evil thoughts that would come there's nothing to keep the evil thoughts from staying there or roosting there and to to take root but the Holy Spirit produces a supernatural element in your mind but there is also an unconverted part of the mind and the prophet teaches us that there is always going to be a battle there there will always be a battle in your mind that that that's that you're just not going to get away from on this side there's always going to be two two Spirits talking to you and one is always going to be telling you uh how how good you are and and how how you are bride and the other one's going to be telling you you're not good enough to make it the other one's going to tell you you're going to fail and the other one's going to be and remember one of them is the devil talking to you and so if you know the word of God you can counter the devil and you can understand his tactics and everything he has to bring at you and brother Branham talks about it like this because there has to be two elements there at work and brother Bram talks about that a devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in he said you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion they had they they wanted to do more mischieviousness so they wanted to go into the Hogs the Devils must have something to work in somebody to work through and that's the way God does too aren't you thankful for that he has to have us he's depending on us to work through so we can be working for God or we can be working for Satan it's whatever voice we yield to in our mind and so and I believe God has got to have somebody who will lay aside the evil thoughts in this day and just believe God and take his word and I believe that will be the Overcomer and we don't take anything the devil tries to force on us without fighting that battle brother Brandon goes on to say overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks I think we need to do that tonight he said a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought he said don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real we know he's real but we're thankful that God is greater we know that God is also real but those two spirits will always work in you and in your mind now in the heart and the soul that the devil has no bearing on that unless you allow him to stay in your mind and sit there and stay there long enough he will cause doubt even down into your soul and so brother Brandon would go on and he said he said you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time you recognize him you know he's the devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that God is it is in you is greater and mightier than he is he said that's the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him oh I'm thankful for that tonight we are more than a match for the Dead level the devil's going to come he's going to fight you he's going to sit there and tell you all kinds of nonsense he's going to sit right on your shoulder in church service he's going to go in your car and ride down the road with you but you have a force within you that is greater than all the devils in the world aren't you thankful for that tonight he said there's real overcoming when you recognize he said he said there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus said walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he said then you realize that you've overcome he said you know he said he said you can say you can't say I got a sickness and and I don't believe it is a sickness he said oh yes it is you've got a cancer you don't believe it's cancer it is a cancer he said but remember greater is he that's in you that's in the world greater is you the greater is he that's in you than the cancer that's in you greater is the spirit of God in you than the spirit of the devil is trying to speak in your mind tonight he said and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible he said it's exactly the way the scripture is written I'd like to tell you tonight the devil knows he's a bluff but he don't know if you know it yet the devil knows it he knows he has no power over you he has no keys he has nothing to use on you anymore but you have been set free by the atonement of Jesus Christ and I think all we have to realize today is the devil knows he's a bluff now if we could realize the same thing that he would have no power over us anymore he said and brother Branham goes on and let's let's do this first Romans 12 and 2. I don't think I put it to you brother Robert but Romans 12 and 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be able to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so you'll see there you must be transformed by the renewing of your mind it's not something it's not good enough to say well I'll just sit here in this battle and Satan can sit here and tell me all he wants to tell me and he's just going to sit here and it's okay maybe I need an opinion every once in a while from him you don't need none of his opinions you don't need his nonsense what you need is to cast him out as soon as he comes you have every right to get rid of that devil as soon as he comes and tells you that you're not bride as soon as he comes and tells you don't go to church on a Rainy Night cast that devil out if there's any way to do it Lord I'm going to be in the house of God tonight why because you're casting him down and if you'll just cast him down time and time again remember the Bible says you feel resist him he will flee for from you I believe that tonight I think we need to believe that tonight if we'll resist the devil when he comes and talking to you and he tries to knock on your door that's when you need to cast down reasoning cast down the devil that's trying to talk to you tonight do you believe that we are Overcomers because of the one who overcome Force he said he said now do you know we've had Wars after wars and rumors of wars he said but you realize that there's really only two powers in all the universe of all of our differences between nations and between each other and everything it all mounts up to two Powers there's only two Powers there's only two kingdoms two Powers two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things are connected with either one of these powers and those Powers is God's power and Satan's power he said every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power he said because that's their only two Powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of death now that's the only two Powers now brother Brandon says that a lot there so I think he really wanted us to understand that there's only two powers in the universe today and Satan can only his power and he goes on and he kind of stutters through her he said he's got his perverted power of God it isn't no real power it's a perversion of God's power everything that Satan has death is only perverted life a lie is only the truth misthold adultery is only a an act misused righteous act misuse see everything that Satan has got something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here and one of the other power is going to control us one power or the other is going to control us today so you're either sitting here under the power of Satan or you're sitting here under the power of God and I'd much rather sit here under the power of God because he can heal you he can deliver you he can bring your family back but the power of Satan will only destroy you and he will torment your mind every day of your life and so I think it's important that we we cast down Satan's reasoning and his tactics and and take God at his word brother random goes on he said let's take our position like the stars of the heavens as the Bible speaks wandering Stars over the book of Jude foaming out their own shame and we don't want to be wandering Stars wonder if this is right wonder if that is right wonder if this will happen he said how could it be don't wonder stay like those stars of the heaven as a real soldier at his post of Duty stand there believing life and death he said now an army when a real army a nation makes ready to go against another Nation it should first go down and figure out what's right and wrong and whether they're able to go against that Nation or not he said Jesus taught that and if people would do that if nations would do that would sit down and stop and think those things both sides would have no more war he said we find out if a man doesn't do that if the military heads of the nation doesn't sit down first and figure out and see what they are he said their motives and the objectives are right and if they have enough strength and powers to overcome the next Army then they're sure to lose so you first got to make sure that you know the word you first have to make sure that you are in the will of God and if you are Satan and his power has no hold on you he said now therefore any battle can be put in a ray they first have to choose a meeting ground or a place where the battle is to be fought a selected place in the first world war it was so placed a man a No Man's Land places where they fought he said they've got to have a place selected like when Israel went to war with Philistines and there was a hill on each side where they gathered and that's where Goliath come down and called the armies of Israel he said that's where David met him in the valley when he passed over the little creek that run between the two hills he picked up the rocks and you know the story and he said there's Mutual ground No Man's Land he said and they fight here at this place they just don't fight one over here and one over maybe that's why Satan fights the mind that's no man's land for some of us and so he said they just don't fight one over here and one down here and run one over here he said that's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army tested strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place he said now don't miss this when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage how many knows that and that battled ground begins in the human mind now I know that was a lot right there but you have to think about it it's just like a real battle it's just like a real war going on and it's constantly going on in your mind in my mind in all of our minds and he said that Battleground begins in the mind he said there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for that place of battle he said where it was to begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind he said now he said now they never started it from some organization they never started it from the mechanical Affair the grounds never started there he said therefore that organization can never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice I believe there is a choice we've got to make tonight we are going to serve God where are we going to obey obey the voices in our head that are trying to tell us to go ahead and just go back a little bit it won't hurt us to backslide just a little and it won't hurt us to give up just a little bit here and and to let let loose a little bit over here and to give ground a little bit to the devil don't give the devil one inch of ground but come on under the subjection of the word of God and watch God move in your life watch God come on the scene when you need him the most because anybody brother says inside of the body is the soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons and affections he said that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit only has one sense the spirit he said oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense either dominates it is Faith or doubt he said that's exactly and there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on therefore Satan begin at the principle part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word and God begin at the principal part to lay his word in that Spirit he said there you are that's what does it if this church right now could be put together knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere he said there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but would receive it he said if you could just get that certain thing fixed there is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will now remember brother Brown's talking about the power of a thought you have to you have to believe that you can take God at his word and you have to believe then that the Holy Ghost is yours you have to believe that God is God and that when he promises something it will come to pass but you have to cast down the reasoning part in your mind you say well Satan is there and he's talking to me about the reasoning he's coming and telling me that I'm not good enough to receive the Holy Ghost in This day he's telling me I'm not good enough to walk a Christian life but that's the part you have to cast down you say will he come back yes he will but you cast him down every time and you tell him he can't stay around anymore don't let him make a home in your mind and tell you how bad you are you are the Overcomers you are the Bride of laodicea that were called out for this age I think it's time we quit playing with the devil quit playing church and tell him it's my time to fight it's my time to take my stand and to cast The Devils out of my mind it's my time to show my family who I am and tell them I'm not just a person that will be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine that comes along in the message and tells me I should go over here and try to believe the the return of brother praying more or go over here and try to say well just be a tape only believer if you want to that's Satan fighting the mind of the Believers today but if you could just get your mind stay on the word of God and when that evil thought comes in your mind and tells you to give up turn around go back and lay down remember that's the devil cast him down and I believe that that devil will flee far from you yes he's going to come back yes he's going to come there and he's going to sit on your shoulder and he's going to talk all kinds of nonsense to you but if you'll just give the devil a black eye every once in a while watch him flee from you watch the devil run away from you because God is greater I believe Satan is scared of what you've got inside of you Satan is scared to death and he knows he can't get but he wants to just give you something to think about something to doubt with he wants to get in there when you need healing and he wants to tell you well there's no healing anymore brother branham's done gone you have to wait on the little room before the healing can take place cast that nonsense back into the Lake of Fire and tell him I don't need that no more what I need is healing what I need is the word of God that says by his stripes I am healed he didn't say a prophet had to be on the scene for it to happen he said you are healed he didn't say you had to wait on a man to return from the dead to come back in the resurrection and raise up oh and then he can come and create Limbs and create arms and all these things what kind of nonsense has the message got into tonight is the night we need to stand here and say I believe the word of God just like it was spoken just like it was written I'm not giving in to the Devil he's not going to tell me to sit down and I can't preach no more because that's the devil trying to get into the mind of the real believer I'm not calling a person a devil but I'm telling you Satan will use men Satan will use the internet Satan will use all kinds of voices and he's not going to give up until the very end you don't think he'll come in just as slick and Sly as he can if he came and he was dressed in red and he had a great big Pitchfork every one of us would recognize that was the devil and we could get rid of him but when he comes in and he looks like your brother and he looks like your sister and he talks to you and tells you you don't have to live this part of the message you don't have to do this part of the message that's when you need to cut that devil down recognize the devil know who he is and cut that evil thought away from you because he is going to battle you but greater is he that is in you greater is he that is in the bride of Christ greater is he that is here tonight that he that is in the world and I'll tell you tonight I believe there's a bride of Christ sitting here at Hardy Arkansas who's not going to be tossed to and fro by every little doctrine that comes around I don't care if it's out of a denomination I don't care if it comes out through the message ranks what whatever it comes from if it's not in the word recognize it as an evil spirit recognize it as the devil and cast it down can you believe that tonight I tell you what I think there's a power and a thought and if you give the devil just an inch to get a hold of something in your mind and he'll come in there and he'll try to plant seed of Doubt well we maybe we don't need the ministry anymore maybe we just have to press play that sounds reasonable but is it the word of God let me ask you this do we need church services today a prophet said I'm so misunderstood he said you think I don't believe in going to church anymore can you believe what he said and take God at his word or are you going to give the devil just a little Edge to get in their well maybe we don't need Church no more maybe we can sit at home and play tapes maybe we can stream our favorite preacher but he said you will assemble yourselves and the word of God is still true today I don't care what the devil says can we take what God said can we take what he said take him at his word and overcome every one of them Devils that are coming after our families and every one of those Devils that are coming into our churches and trying to shut the church Doors Down remember he said the church doors might be padlocked someday but you know I don't believe it'll be I don't believe it'll be the world doing such I believe it'll be padlocked from the people that are sitting here refuse to come back why do you need the doors open if there ain't nobody to come well come on somebody you can sit there all night if you want to look at me but let me tell you this I believe God has got Warriors in the message of the hour I don't believe he called a bunch of sissies to join the message of the hour he didn't call a bunch of people who couldn't stand in the day of evil and who couldn't stand against The Wiles of the devil but he said in this day that's when you have to stand he said stand therefore with your law and skirt about with truth and I believe tonight that we have the truth of the hour I believe we know the truth of the hour but what is it it's important to know that when the Devil Comes among you and tries to tries to break this thing up his brother Brandon said he would try to come in and try to preach false doctrines to you and tell you you don't have to do this and you don't have to do that and a man can stand in the Pulpit be married two or three times well go ahead and say something you can say yes or no but listen to me when the prophet said it it's true when the Bible says it I can hang my soul on it because it's true anyway I don't care what some preacher tells me I don't care what some internet person tells me I can tell you what the word of God said and the word of God said to cast down reasoning he said to get rid of those Devils that come and sit on your shoulder remember the birds can come in and they can Roost there or they can come there to your mind but they don't have to roost there and I heard a brother say and I kind of liked it he said you can take your double barrel shotgun with 66 books of the Bible and you can blow them Devils away and I love that tonight I think that's the time that's the type of Christian we need that's not afraid to fight for the god-given rights that you have not afraid to fight the the devil that's going to come in this day oh he's going to come after you he's going to come after your family he's going to come after the church he's going to come after the pastor and every one of you sitting there tonight Satan is trying to get a hold of you and telling you you don't need to go to church and if you do show up you don't have to participate eight all you got to do is just sit there and just mark it off the calendar well I went to church twice this week or I went three times this week I'm doing a pretty good job no you need to get serious with God and believe the word of God we're not here just for a picnic but we're here to fight a battle we're here to fight the battle that is going on in every one of our minds and I think tonight is time that we quit playing around with that devil when he comes in it's time to cast him down with all that you've got if he tells you well I don't need to play tapes in my home anymore and I just need to not listen to that because you know the the kids aren't interested and I'll just go turn on the TV instead cast down that devil go ahead and turn on the tape in your home why don't you get the family together and pray a little bit I tell you Satan fights every one of us in that department um yeah every one of us when you go to pray you try to get your family together you're either too busy or Satan will try to tell you there's not enough time in a day you've got to get to work on time I'm telling you it's time that we had parents that will get together and get their family together and try to have prayer again in the home I think it's time for the family altar to take place of the TV well what if it did what kind of a home could we have how spiritual could we be when we come to the house of God if we put him first I know this is a little crazy but it's the message of the hour it's what he taught us he told us not to give in and I believe it's a positive message you say that sounds like a bunch of rules and regulations it's a positive message because this is a way to defeat Satan anywhere on any grounds and that's what we need to do tonight is to defeat Satan and because he is going to fight you I think we can agree on that brother Bram says this never permit a negative thought to come to your mind if you can help it he said when it starts don't entertain it will you say I can't help the thoughts from coming he said well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting he said that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come right and you can't Satan is always constantly filling your mind with some sort of a thought and it's not always good right but you don't have to entertain the thought right we don't have to entertain every thought that comes to our mind truth he said you don't entertain them just pass it on he said no sir Jesus Christ is my savior all things are mined by God and I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of him he said God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of your confession Hebrews he said he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it and brother Branham goes on he said it's not a Christian Science Mind Over Matter he said the mind accepts life which is the word of God he said and there brings to life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought in the channel of your thoughts see it's not as the thought as a Christian Science make it Mind Over Matter but your mind accepts it it grasps it what your mind controls by what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it do you believe that tonight that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you he said oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifesting you if you abide in me and my words in you he said then ask what you will and it'll be done for you he said then he said then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel he said the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God he said and then it goes out itself automatically I'd like to say that again if you'll get under the real channel of God we're standing here in a lot of doubt he said trying to accept what's out there he said stop up that come down to that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically think about that for just a second when you have the true spirit of God in you the thoughts cannot Roost there right it goes out itself automatically he said it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts is the inside Satan's approach is from the inside and he is the one that torments your mind when you know you've went to the Altar and and you've had your hands laid on you and you uh you've been prayed for right and you believed that you were healed any if you walk away from there Satan is bound and determined to tell you were never healed when you went up there he is uh it is his duty and his job to tell you that if you lay hands on the sick they will not recover right that's his job it's his job to tell you that the ministry does not need to be in the Pulpit today it's his job to tell you that we don't need to gather together as a body of Believers today it is his job to tell you that evil spirits cannot be cast out of the people but God had a different idea and when he gave you something he gave you not only a thought he gave you a spirit to fight Satan's Thoughts with because greater is the spirit of Christ in you then the thoughts that Satan tries to bring into your mind and so Satan will tell you all these bad things but I believe he said now he said now you say I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things he said that has nothing to do with it it's the inside no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are those things are respected but Jesus said except the man be born again see there's got to be something happen inside if you don't that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real so how do we overcome the evil thoughts of the devil in this day by the Holy Ghost how do we overcome the evil that is going to constantly come and remind us who we're not by the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost is in you then you can't dwell on those thoughts any longer when the Holy Ghost comes in you you can't dwell on the thought that my children can never be saved you can't dwell on the thought that I can't be healed now the thought can come the thought can come and it can it can affect you and it can battle you every day but it cannot stay there if the real Holy Ghost is on the inside because the Holy Ghost in you will rise up and drive that thought away you see where I'm going with this I hope because I I think you'll understand the Mind battles will always come we are going to fight Satan every day of Our Lives there's nothing we can do about that but what we can do to keep the things from sitting there and destroying us ruining our lives is to have the Holy Ghost on the inside to counter what Satan is always trying to bring on us and I think if you'll see that there is a power and a positive thought there is power in thinking that what you what you have is real there's power and you not being depressed all the time there's power in you not admitting your depression you say well I had a bad day yesterday and you just keep talking about it and I'm probably you know I've often said this and Isaac's going to correct me on this later because I'm preaching something I better live but you know sometimes on Wednesday that's the third Monday of this week I mean that's just the way some weeks go and and but you know it would do us a lot better it do us a lot more good if we would actually dwell on the positives of life and you now I'm not up here trying to tell you you know positivity is going to save you it's not but I believe a Christian should always have a positive testimony brother Brandon goes on here and he said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said will come to pass now I want you to notice what you have said will come to pass now you were positive about it the mountain can still be standing there there could still be obstacles in your way but the mountain will move because you said so there's power and a thought when you have the thought you speak it sometimes like if you're like me we speak before the thought gets there but you see what I'm saying we should have a real positive thought towards the promises of God and brother Brown goes on he said he said you get it he said there you are there's the Battlegrounds if you'd only get that started first he said well what's the matter with our Pentecostal faith today we've let too many things hinder it we've let too many things looking at somebody else and the devil is always trying to point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine he'll point you to a hypocrite he'll point you to someone impersonating something he didn't do it because he was impersonating but if it come from the true source of the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word cannot pass away it's got to stay there it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed in the heart now that's bringing it down to where I want to get to tonight we must accept the truth of the word in our mind and then it will come down and take place in our hearts he said then the word of God becomes a reality to us every senses of the soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up there's nothing can come up in the memory say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God and miss so and so try to trust God for healing one time and she failed he said but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come to the memory anymore he said no matter about Mrs Jones or what she did it's you and God together so you say somebody died of cancer but I don't have to somebody lost their children to the world I don't have to it also goes for you that have lost your children they're coming back and we went over that before and I believe that's I believe that's the message of the hour I believe they're coming back don't you doubt that and he said but there's your battle he said kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger it's stop it right now I like that part don't let the devil sit there and don't just say well I'm just going to fight with him a little bit no because he'll bring you down so low that you'll lose your strength to fight him anymore but if you'll cast him down when he first gets there that's why we must recognize when the devil's showing up if he's telling you something negative about yourself then it's the devil because you are children of God and God does not go around telling his children how bad they are now he will correct you and you'll know what is his correction because you'll remember what you did wrong you'll remember those things but remember once it's confessed that it's under the Blood cast that thing out of your mind and quit dwelling on it and go forward and believe that I am a Son of God and when Satan tries to come and reminding you of some past wrong or some little thing in your past history you say Satan that is in the sea of God's forgetfulness I don't remember it no more God don't remember it no more the church don't remember it no more why because it's been forgiven and I forgive them and they forgive me God has forgiven us it's time we just quit holding on to little grudges and little things around the church you say well so and so did me wrong 20 years ago well I don't care if they did or not you better forgive them or you're never going anywhere you've got to forgive your enemy you've got to do good to those that try to falsely accuse you and persecute you and do all these things you say well so and so you know they they hurt me they hurt my feelings every time they show up at church they try to do something to rub me the wrong way well brother maybe God put that person there for a reason maybe he put that person there so he could rub those rough rough edges off of you and bring you under subjection of the Holy Ghost remember we're always trying to find little reasons why we can't live a good Christian life but I think if we would just recognize it's the devil and cast him down when he gets there we can live a Victorious Life In Christ brother ramp tells us don't despise where God has got you serve your purpose there's coming a great Victory Day one of these days where the battle is over oh I hope you see that tonight there's coming a victory day today may not be that day for your body because your body and your soul and your spirit they're all put here for a purpose and your body is going to fight sickness and your mind is going to fight the devil but your soul can be anchored in Jesus and that's where we need to be denied I said I'm Anchored In Jesus the storms of life are going to come we're going to Brave every one of them because we're anchored in the Rock of Ages but listen to me Satan's going to come he's going to talk to you he's going to try to destroy you and your marriage and your children but greater is he that is in you than he that is battling your mind tonight greater is he that is trying to take over your life maybe you're a married couple maybe you're maybe you've got a family and maybe Satan is trying to come in and he's trying to use the internet to try try to get in there and break you up and break make you cold towards one another cast down that devil you say well I don't want to get rid of the internet maybe I use it for work but don't you don't have to dwell on it so much and use that devil you say well if I know something's killing me if I knew that there was something I was eating that was killing me and a doctor said if you eat that you're going to die would I continue to eat it and if I did I would be committing suicide right but if I told you that your lack of prayer life and your lack of study in the scriptures and your lack of hearing the message of the hour was going to kill you what would you do study more pray more hear the word more right if I told you that that that that pornography would ruin a marriage and it will then you would stop doing it right but no Satan will come around and constantly try to bring that back Satan is always at work Satan is always trying to to defeat God's children knowing good and well he can't do it and you know he tries to come in and he knows he can't get you in a certain way because you've overcome this and you've overcome that and you've overcome All These Little Devils that have come after you and so he'll come a different way and that's why we must recognize who he is if it's anything outside of the word of God it is a distraction to you and it is the devil trying to get you away from the word of God let me get on down here my time is up but brother Brandon says he said those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for us it doesn't seem like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he's let us hit this river to see what we'll do Moses led the children of Israel right right behind him and the dust boiling from a half a million men in arms and there was two million helpless Jews with nothing standing there men women and children and so forth and the Red Sea had cut him off the Dead Sea had cut him off he said there's no place to go but Moses had a victory day when he prayed through and we can have a victory day when we pray through he said Moses had that Victory Day see he said but Moses he said he and he began he went and began to cry out to the Lord and the Lord said why are you crying to me I commission you to do it speak to the children and they go in that line of duty he said there you are don't cry out to me your commissioned to take these people over just speak to them that they go forward he said stay right in the path of Duty what a courage that ought to be for the sick person what encouraged it ought to be for the backslider turn yourself around and start back stay in the line of duty it's God's business to open up the Red Seas it's God's business you just speak and move forward that's all you have to do so I don't have to dwell on the thoughts I don't have to dwell on the things that are constantly coming against me but I can speak and go forward because I know who I am you know who you are you've been positioned by the message of the hour you've been shown your place in God and you don't have to give in to the devil any longer aren't you thankful for that I believe that we should cast out the devil and when he tries to to to to tell you boo I think we should just tell him boo back you know just get rid of that devil and he said now what is the word of God he said the word of God is God himself so God gave the believer himself I love that I hope you maybe you didn't hear me God gave the believer himself God is the word God is God himself he said he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by in other words he's the Father the word is God then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children he said there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about the Rapture is sure the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised is ours It All Belongs to us so what are we scared because the devil is constantly telling you you should be scared but greater is he that is in you then he that's telling you that you got to be scared when a message could come and say what are you scared about it all belongs to us and I'll go on down here brother Brian said when you get out from behind that like Eve did he's talking about the word she was behind the word but when you get out from behind that like Eve did the Battle Is Lost he said now poor Eve she listened and she lost her place and and I would like you to think about that now for just a second brother Branham actually talks to this woman and she asked the question excuse me yeah this woman she asked a question brother Brandon what will we do something has settled over me I can't break it she had a dream that she was lost in white sand and it's getting dark couldn't find my way in this dream has stayed with me and and this dream was tormenting her now remember Satan can come to you in a dream this woman had this dream and she told brother Brandon she asked him what to do about this dream he said now now I am groping in darkness my son and his wife were included in my dream now they are also in darkness and we are desperate we are in desperation I believe God will show you what is in our hearts brother Brandon goes on and answers this question he said you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights he said your dream proves by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything's all right it's you yourself nervous he said let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset he said it's Satan now he recognized who it was but now that woman has to recognize that it's also Satan and he said it's Satan he said then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it so every one of the family try to do that each one of you children help your papa help your mama he said try to help the children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you are Christians you are born of the spirit of God you're the salt of the earth I love it how he lays these promises in here and tells you who you are he's telling this lady the devil come and told her and tormented her about something but he said this is who you are this is what you need to remember that don't listen to what the devil had it may come by way of dream it might might come by look maybe look very Supernatural to you it might come by a preacher in the Pulpit it may come by a friend or a family member but if it's against the word of God and if it's telling you that you're not something that you know you are cast that devil aside he said you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think about the wrong things and so brother Brandon goes on and I'm just about to close here I promise he said I need your strength for my health I cannot go forward without you I now accept you as my healer he's praying this prayer he said I renounce the devil in all of his works from this time henceforth I will think positive I will believe every promise is it important to think positive it is important it's important not to let a negative thought from the devil sit there in your mind it will it will torment you it will hurt your family he said it'll make one nervous then it'll go to the next it'll make your entire household a nervous wreck because you gave in to one spirit that is trying to attack you he said now I renounce the devil in all of his works from this time henceforth I will think positive I will believe every promise he said by his stripes I was healed I now accept it I believe it it is mine he said I thank you Lord I will continue testifying on my healing until I'm perfectly well I would like to this last quote and the musicians could come he said don't have a negative testimony every time you confess he said well I still feel bad today he said you go right straight back to that same rut that you was in the beginning he said there's not a man or a woman in here that is baptized with the Holy Spirit but what would start your confession he said I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me I believe I believe he said you'll go right down you'll never claim he said listen You'll never live above your confession brother random says this I'll never have a negative testimony no more I'm going to believe the Lord will you raise your hands and say I believe that and I now confess that he said God bless you I wonder if we could do the same thing today I will never have a negative testimony no more I am what God Said I am he said you're the salt of the earth he said you're children of God your children of the promise you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are the bride of Christ in the last day you are who God says you are not what Satan has tried to tell you are he's tried to bring you down he's tried to destroy your family and destroy your mind but today is the day of restoration today is the day of healing today is the day when your family can come back today is the day that we renounce every devil and everything that he has to bring against us I think it's time that we stand up and say I am not giving in one inch to that devil no more I'm not going to listen when he comes on my property because I am one of gods and you can't touch me devil I wonder if we can stand like that and say I'm going to be bold I'm going to be strong in the Lord I'm not letting the devil come my way no more I'm not ever letting Satan put a thought in my mind that I'm not good enough I don't care what the flesh looks like I don't care how many mistakes I've made but God God is a God that will forgive me God is the god that will heal me God is a God who is just but he's also faithful and he loves me I think we should have that as our testimony I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and I wonder if you could stand tonight and say this with all your hearts Satan get behind me Satan get out of my life Satan get out of my family Satan get out of my marriage Satan get off of my children it's time to take back your land tonight it's time to get the devil running away from you quit letting him come in and sit with you but run that devil right back to hell where he came from do you believe it tonight you believe it tonight tell God thank you for healing me thank you for saving my family thank you for delivering me from the evil works of darkness thank you Jesus and I think if that's our testimony nothing can stop us from moving forward nothing can stop us any longer because we're Chosen and loved by God God aren't you thankful we are blessed we are highly favored we are his children you believe it tonight let's just play something tonight if there's a need among you if Satan's sitting there tonight telling you who you're not trying to tell you you're not one of God's children telling you can't overcome I think this is your night cast down that devil cast down reasoning don't even let him have a moment to talk to you as soon as he comes recognize it's the devil recognize it make your confession a positive one let the weak say I'm strong tonight let the poor say I'm rich in love I'm rich in faith I'm rich in favor with God there's nothing can stop me tonight nothing can turn me around with your heads bowed I wonder if there be one Among Us you're more than welcome to come to the altar you can raise your hand where you're sitting tell God I'm sorry for having a negative testimony in my life I'm sorry for the things that I've done wrong and Lord I'm not going to let that devil Roost there any longer I'm going to shoot him down every time he shows up you say brother Joel he's gonna he showed up this morning and he showed up this afternoon and he showed up yesterday and no doubt he'll show up tomorrow but there's a promise that what is in you is greater than what is in the world whatsoever things are good whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things I wonder if we can think on these things now Satan's gonna constantly come Among Us and try to tell us different things but I wonder if we could just think on the things that God has given us say thank you Jesus for the grace that you've given me thank you for the love you've showed in my life thank you for my children you say well don't look like they're here but thank you anyway because they're coming if you just believe that and continue to confess it the faith of Abraham being Abraham's seed I believe it'll come to pass if you believe with all your hearts just sing tonight with all your hearts now oh I pledge allegiance to the land with all my strength and all I am I will see to honor his command [Music] to be just too the lamb oh yes I pledge allegiance to the land oh with all my strength with all I am I am I will see to honor his command oh I pledge allegiance to you know the verse that brother Allen well I've heard how Christians long
