[13:42] beasts and the four and 20 elders fell
[13:45] down before the lamb
[13:47] having every one of them hearts and
[13:50] golden vials full of odors which are the
[13:53] prayers of the saints
[13:56] that's those that started the altar that

[15:38] in jesus name amen
[15:41] amen god bless you tonight it's good to
[15:43] uh be with you by way of internet
[15:45] tonight and we're gonna go right into
[15:47] our breach study that we've been uh
[15:50] working on for a while now as you heard
[15:52] i played just a little bit of the tape
[15:55] that'll be part of what we're studying
[15:56] on tonight i titled this a cowboys
[15:59] meditation
[16:00] and and we're going to read first if you
[16:02] want to stand where you're at you're
[16:04] welcome to do that daniel chapter 7 and
[16:06] verse 9
[16:07] daniel chapter 7 and verse 9 and we'll
[16:09] stand and read the word
[16:11] it says this i beheld till the thrones
[16:13] were cast down
[16:15] and the ancient of days did sit
[16:18] whose garment was white as snow
[16:20] and the hair of his head
[16:22] was like the pure wool
[16:24] his throne was like the fiery flame
[16:27] and his wheels
[16:29] as burning fire oh i want to see him
[16:31] like that don't you
[16:33] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[16:36] from before him
[16:37] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[16:41] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[16:45] stood before him so there were thousand
[16:47] thousands or millions that ministered
[16:50] unto him and tens of millions who stood
[16:53] before him
[16:55] the judgment was set
[16:57] and the books
[16:58] were opened i pray the lord would add
[17:00] his blessing to the word you may be
[17:02] seated
[17:06] the
[17:07] breach sermon is ultimately
[17:10] about the lamb the kinsman redeemer
[17:13] taking the book and making a transition
[17:17] to a lion judge king
[17:20] and that's what he's accomplishing
[17:22] during these final years of the gentile
[17:24] dispensation so he's changing
[17:27] from being a kinsmen redeemer and yet as
[17:30] you heard on the tape brother branham
[17:32] said that hasn't fully happened yet and
[17:34] we know that it fully takes place at the
[17:36] time of the rapture that's when the
[17:38] sanctuary becomes smokey now
[17:40] uh through this time
[17:42] he is accomplishing this and it
[17:44] continues on through the tribulation and
[17:47] the salvation of the jews into the
[17:49] millennium where he reigns as the son of
[17:51] david and finally at the white throne
[17:53] judgment where he stands with his queen
[17:56] by his side
[17:58] and and so we're going to go to the
[18:00] breach to part of what we heard tonight
[18:02] in paragraph 269 it says he leaves the
[18:04] throne to be an intercessor as a slain
[18:08] lamb to be a lion
[18:10] king
[18:11] to bring the world to judgment so this
[18:13] is his purpose in leaving the throne he
[18:16] is bringing the world to judgment who
[18:18] has rejected his message he's not a
[18:20] mediator he said remember the old
[18:23] testament teaching now as we hurry when
[18:25] the blood went off the mercy seat what
[18:27] was it judgment seat and when the lamb
[18:30] slain walked forward from eternity
[18:33] out of the father's throne and took his
[18:35] rights it was a judgment seat once he's
[18:38] done that it's a judgment seat he said
[18:40] then he become not a lamb but a lion
[18:42] king
[18:43] and he calls for his queen
[18:46] to come to stand by his side oh that's
[18:49] what the message is about that's what
[18:51] the message of the hour is is the lamb
[18:54] the lamb calling becoming the king as
[18:57] he's becoming the king to becoming that
[19:00] judgment that that one who will be there
[19:02] at the white throne of judgment he calls
[19:04] for the queen to stand in judgment with
[19:07] him to come stand
[19:08] by his side no he not he said that the
[19:11] saints shall judge the earth
[19:13] daniel said the judgment was set and the
[19:16] books were opened and ten thousand times
[19:19] ten thousands of thousands ministered to
[19:21] him king and queen
[19:23] he said and then another book was open
[19:24] which was the book of life that's for
[19:27] the church
[19:28] and the queen and the king
[19:30] stood there and brother branham does an
[19:32] interesting thing at that time and you
[19:33] may have heard it if you tuned in early
[19:35] on the tape and you can listen to it on
[19:37] the breach brother branham gives a
[19:39] cowboys meditation it's actually kind of
[19:42] a poem
[19:44] and or a song
[19:45] and it says this last night as i laid on
[19:47] the prairie i gazed to the stars in the
[19:50] skies and i wondered if ever a cowboy
[19:53] could drift to that suite by and by
[19:56] there's a road to that bright happy
[19:57] region but it's a dim narrow trail so
[19:59] they say but the broad one that leads to
[20:02] perdition is posted and blazed all the
[20:05] way
[20:06] they speak of another great owner he's
[20:08] speaking about the terms of his cattle
[20:09] life he said if he was ever in a roundup
[20:12] you could see it playing brother branham
[20:13] would have been in a roundup very
[20:15] similar to that when he was a young man
[20:18] he said they speak of another great
[20:19] owner he's never overstocked so they say
[20:21] he'll always make room for a center that
[20:24] will drift on that straight narrow way
[20:27] they say he will never forsake you and
[20:29] he knows every action and look
[20:31] for safety we better get branded have
[20:33] our name
[20:34] on his great
[20:36] tally book for they say there will be a
[20:38] great roundup when cowboys like doges
[20:41] will stand to be marked by the writers
[20:44] of judgment he said them prophets and
[20:46] seers
[20:47] that's posted
[20:49] and knows
[20:50] every brand
[20:52] so brother branham says if he was ever
[20:54] in a round up see the boss stand out
[20:56] there and the riders and milling in that
[20:58] herd of cattle he'll see his own brand
[21:00] go by and he'll motion to the boss
[21:03] brother branham types this to the
[21:04] messenger of the h he said he'll motion
[21:06] to the boss and the boss will see it and
[21:08] give him the knot his pony runs right in
[21:11] around around this milling cropping
[21:13] bunch of horns like that and cut his own
[21:15] cows out see he said they say there will
[21:18] be a great roundup and cowboys like
[21:19] dogies will stand and will be marked by
[21:22] the writers of judgment that's posted
[21:24] and knows every brand so i guess i'll be
[21:27] a stray yearlings a man that's condemned
[21:29] to die is what the man the poem is
[21:30] saying
[21:31] unbranded he said they make soup out of
[21:32] him he said that we'll be cut in the
[21:34] bunch with the rustics when the boss of
[21:37] those riders come by
[21:39] he said see who it is the boss of the
[21:40] writers that's the lamb to the seven
[21:42] messengers who has posted and knows
[21:45] every brand you know what a confidence
[21:47] that ought to give us tonight that we
[21:49] who have been called to the message of
[21:51] the hour we're the ones who have been
[21:53] called out who've been cut out who've
[21:55] been
[21:56] who've been corralled if we could say it
[21:58] that way by the messenger of the age
[22:00] we've been corralled by the message of
[22:02] the hour and we've been placed in
[22:05] his group he saw his brand in us
[22:08] other people may not have saw much the
[22:10] world may not see much in you tonight it
[22:12] may see just a few people sitting and
[22:14] listening
[22:16] on a wednesday night that are sitting
[22:18] and listening at home but but god saw
[22:20] something in you that he sent the
[22:22] message by your way oh we ought to be we
[22:24] ought to be grateful for that tonight
[22:26] the boss of the writer said that's mine
[22:29] and so the messenger's message cuts you
[22:32] out from the denominations and the
[22:34] people the regular church if we could
[22:35] say it that way of the day and brought
[22:37] you out into the message of the hour i'm
[22:40] so glad to be a part of the message of
[22:42] this day
[22:43] amen now
[22:46] the bible tells us as we'll look at this
[22:48] now
[22:49] from the scriptures
[22:51] as we know that brother branham was the
[22:52] word prophet these things must come from
[22:55] the scripture
[22:56] the bible tells us what happens at the
[22:58] end of the tribulation of the battle of
[22:59] armageddon if you have your bibles
[23:01] you'll turn to the book of revelation
[23:03] revelation chapter 20
[23:05] and verse 1.
[23:07] revelation chapter 20
[23:09] and verse 1
[23:11] he says i saw an angel come down from
[23:13] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[23:15] pit
[23:17] and a great chain
[23:19] in his hand
[23:21] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[23:23] serpent
[23:24] which
[23:25] is the devil and satan and bound him
[23:27] a thousand years oh i'm looking forward
[23:30] to that i want to see him bound i want
[23:32] to see him down how is he bound by a
[23:34] chain of circumstance the prophet told
[23:36] his team he's bound he got nobody to
[23:38] work through
[23:39] so he's bound for a thousand years
[23:42] and cast him into the bottomless pit
[23:44] and shut him up
[23:47] i like that i like that i know it means
[23:49] to close the door but i can't wait for
[23:51] the devil to be shut up he said he shut
[23:54] him up and set a seal upon him that he
[23:56] should deceive the nations no more until
[23:58] the thousand years should be fulfilled
[24:00] and after that he must be loosed
[24:02] a little season
[24:04] a little season verse 4 and i saw
[24:06] thrones and they set upon them and
[24:09] judgment was given unto them
[24:11] and i saw the souls of them that were
[24:14] beheaded for the witness of jesus and
[24:16] for the word of god
[24:18] and which had not worshipped the beast
[24:20] neither his image neither had received
[24:22] his mark upon their foreheads
[24:24] or in their hands and they lived and
[24:26] reigned with christ
[24:28] a thousand
[24:29] years
[24:31] that's us we live and reign with christ
[24:33] a thousand years brother branham
[24:34] identifies that as the bride
[24:37] now and verse and that's the bride all
[24:39] down to the ages because it speaks of
[24:40] those that were martyred
[24:42] for the word of god
[24:44] and he said but the rest of the dead
[24:46] live not
[24:47] the rest of the dead so there are some
[24:49] who don't raise at that time the rest of
[24:51] the dead lived not again until the
[24:53] thousand years were finished
[24:55] this is the first
[24:57] resurrection
[24:58] blessed and holy is he
[25:00] that have part in the first resurrection
[25:03] so going by way of the grave as a
[25:06] believer in the in the message of the
[25:08] hour whatever hour it was that you were
[25:10] laid away in as a believer as a holy
[25:13] ghost-filled christian it's no detriment
[25:15] to you to go by way of the grave during
[25:17] that time
[25:19] but it's actually that you'll come up
[25:21] first and then there'll be a little
[25:23] group that will be alive and remain
[25:24] that'll complete that body at that time
[25:27] but it's no detriment to you that you go
[25:29] by way of the grave you don't lose
[25:30] anything you'll be in that same
[25:32] resurrection he said blessed and holy is
[25:34] he that hath part in the first
[25:36] resurrection on such the second death
[25:38] hath no power but they shall be priests
[25:41] of god and of christ and shall reign
[25:43] with him a thousand years they shall
[25:45] reign with him in other words they're
[25:47] going to be the ones that will sit in
[25:49] the throne
[25:50] with him
[25:52] now we won't take time tonight but if
[25:53] you read in in the rest of revelation
[25:56] chapter 20 from verse 7 down through
[25:57] verse 10
[26:00] you'll find that satan is loosed and he
[26:02] goes and he gathers his armies and
[26:04] finally he's defeated and then in verse
[26:06] 11 i saw a great white throne and him
[26:09] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[26:11] and the heaven fled away
[26:13] there was found no place
[26:16] for them
[26:17] and i saw the dead small and great
[26:20] that means big and little rich and poor
[26:23] every one of them every person you've
[26:24] ever known every person that's ever
[26:26] drawn a breath
[26:27] will stand before the one whose face
[26:31] from whose faith face the earth and the
[26:33] heaven flees away
[26:35] and he said i saw the dead small and
[26:37] great stand before god and the books
[26:39] were open
[26:40] and another book was open which is the
[26:42] book of life and the dead were judged
[26:45] according now notice judge out of those
[26:48] things
[26:49] which were written in the books
[26:51] according to their works so there is a
[26:53] group of people who are judged
[26:56] according to their works and it's not
[26:59] the bride you and i are not judged
[27:01] according to our works to us sin is not
[27:04] imputed aren't you glad brother peter
[27:06] that sin is not imputed to you as a
[27:08] believer amen aren't you glad out there
[27:11] on the internet streaming that sin is
[27:13] not imputed blessed is the man the bible
[27:15] says to whom the lord will not impute
[27:17] sin other words sin will never be
[27:19] charged to your account why sin has
[27:20] already been paid for on the cross
[27:23] and you're there with him
[27:25] amen but these are judged according to
[27:27] their work so i wouldn't want to go in
[27:29] that way with you i don't want to take a
[27:31] chance i want to go in while there's
[27:33] mercy i want to plead the blood of the
[27:35] lamb
[27:36] verse 13 of the sea
[27:38] gave up the dead which were in it and
[27:40] death and hell delivered up the dead
[27:42] which were in them and they were judged
[27:44] every
[27:45] man according
[27:46] to their works
[27:48] and death and hell were cast into the
[27:50] lake of fire
[27:52] this is the second death
[27:54] and whosoever was not found written in
[27:57] the book of life
[27:58] was cast into the lake of fire and
[28:00] remember the book of life judas had his
[28:02] name written in the book of life because
[28:04] he told them when they went and cast out
[28:06] devils and come back rejoicing judas
[28:08] being among them he told them he said
[28:10] don't rejoice because you can cast out
[28:11] devils but rejoice because your name's
[28:13] in the book of life and all their names
[28:15] were and judas was among them but his
[28:18] name was taken out but your name cannot
[28:20] be taken out of the bride amen of that
[28:22] of that book amen
[28:24] now
[28:25] another
[28:26] group coming at that time so there's a
[28:28] group of people who have to be judged
[28:30] we'll call that the nations
[28:32] another group coming out of that time is
[28:34] 144 000 jews
[28:36] revelation 14 and 1 says i looked and
[28:39] loyal lamb stood on the mount zion and
[28:41] with him 140 and 4 000 having his
[28:44] father's name written
[28:46] in their foreheads
[28:48] 144 000 having his father's name
[28:52] written in their foreheads
[28:53] another group in matthew 25 if you look
[28:56] there that's the there's a group but it
[28:59] identifies more closely these group
[29:01] these people the nations that will be
[29:02] judged
[29:04] this is after interestingly it's after
[29:06] the parable of the foolish virgin and
[29:08] the parable of the talents in matthew 25
[29:11] he then says when the son of man shall
[29:12] come in his glory and all the holy
[29:14] angels with him
[29:15] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[29:17] glory
[29:19] before him shall be gathered all nations
[29:22] and he shall separate them one from
[29:24] another so here he says it's not just
[29:26] that he's judging them for what they've
[29:28] done wrong but he's actually going to
[29:30] separate them because there's some that
[29:32] are sheep and some that are goats
[29:35] among these nations
[29:36] and verse 33 and he shall set he said he
[29:39] shall separate them one from another as
[29:41] the shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[29:43] goats verse 33 he shall set the sheep on
[29:45] his right hand
[29:47] but the goats
[29:48] on the left
[29:50] the sheep on the right hand but the
[29:51] goats on the left we're not going to go
[29:52] fully into that tonight maybe we'll get
[29:54] into it in a future service but there's
[29:57] a great truth there of those that and he
[29:59] talked about how that they gave a drink
[30:01] of water to one of these little ones he
[30:04] said if you've done that to them you've
[30:05] done it to me and they didn't even know
[30:07] it they didn't even know that they were
[30:09] righteous and they made it in oh my so
[30:12] there'll be a group like that isn't god
[30:14] good he is a good god he is he's long
[30:17] suffering to each and every one of us
[30:20] now the bride does not sit in that group
[30:22] they sit with the king in judgment
[30:24] because they are in the first
[30:26] resurrection the foolish virgin walk in
[30:28] all the light that they know and they
[30:30] have a measure of salvation but they're
[30:32] not the bride
[30:33] they go in the tribulation period and
[30:35] are killed
[30:36] 144 000 jews are saved as a nation
[30:39] during that tribulation period under the
[30:41] ministry of moses and elijah and are
[30:43] killed by the antichrist system
[30:45] all the others are the nations which are
[30:47] separated by the king and queen into two
[30:48] groups sheep and ghosts depending on how
[30:50] they treated
[30:52] the elect bride
[30:54] now and those are the groups so i want
[30:56] to be in that first group i want to be
[30:58] the bride don't you
[31:00] now
[31:02] brother branham says this about that he
[31:04] said the church the lukewarm
[31:06] anything outside of the elected bride
[31:09] will go through the tribulation period
[31:12] you're either going to be in the bride
[31:14] or you go to the tribulation
[31:16] that's
[31:17] there's no deal there's no way to get
[31:19] out of that you're either going to be in
[31:20] the bride
[31:21] or you'll go through the tribulation
[31:23] period they will not raise in the first
[31:25] resurrection you have to be bribed for
[31:27] your day to raise in the first
[31:29] resurrection the rest of the dead lived
[31:31] not for a thousand years just for
[31:33] ordained predestinated elected bribe
[31:36] god's own election you say what about
[31:37] that that loved one that died many years
[31:39] ago
[31:40] they didn't understand the message they
[31:41] didn't see it brother brown said don't
[31:43] count them out because they may have
[31:44] been sealed away in their hour they may
[31:46] be bribed for their day it's also
[31:48] possible that they could come up after
[31:50] in that second resurrection and actually
[31:52] be saved
[31:53] by how they treated the bride while they
[31:55] were living but they won't live during
[31:57] this time of the millennium now he says
[31:59] they will not raise in the first
[32:01] resurrection the rest of the dead live
[32:02] not for a thousand years just the
[32:04] foreordained predestinated elected bride
[32:08] god's own
[32:10] elections amen god's own elections he
[32:13] said who is it
[32:14] brother branham i don't know
[32:16] i can't tell you who it is but i know
[32:18] it's going to be there because the lord
[32:21] said they would oh that's what we have
[32:22] to hold on to church i can't tell you
[32:24] who it is but i know that there's going
[32:27] to be a bribe because god said that it
[32:29] would
[32:31] they're the ones that'll go up from the
[32:32] tribulation
[32:34] but the rest of them will go through the
[32:36] tribulation go down and everything will
[32:38] be killed notice everything will be
[32:40] killed before the millennium then the
[32:42] righteous shall come out in the
[32:43] millennium and live
[32:44] a thousand years
[32:46] and after the thousand years then the
[32:48] great white throne judgment comes and
[32:49] then the dead both right and wrong is
[32:51] raised and the books are open and the
[32:53] book of life was open and the saints the
[32:55] wife and the husband sent and judged the
[32:57] world
[32:59] and there it comes to pass the saying
[33:01] he'll judge all nations with a rod of
[33:03] iron
[33:04] all nations shall stand before him there
[33:06] and he'll judge them with the rod of
[33:08] iron he'll separate the sheep from the
[33:10] goats and say to the goats depart and
[33:12] the sheep come you blessed
[33:14] of my father
[33:16] notice that the jews the bride
[33:19] and the church are all in god's economy
[33:24] all of them are in god's economy
[33:26] he has a place for them
[33:28] see because brother branham taught us
[33:30] that he has a bunch of change in his
[33:32] pocket
[33:33] to be used for different
[33:35] purposes and you look at abraham and lot
[33:38] lot was always a hair in the biscuit he
[33:41] was always causing problems for abraham
[33:44] yet he was put there for that purpose he
[33:47] had a part in the economy of god and it
[33:49] was not a part of someone like like
[33:53] pharaoh that would be just his heart
[33:54] hardened and turned against god it was
[33:56] not that but it was less than what
[33:58] abraham was he could never be abraham
[34:00] and yet he was not lost he was not he
[34:03] was one who who would come out of sodom
[34:05] but yet he would go through many things
[34:07] now
[34:08] lot and abraham were very different but
[34:10] god made them different
[34:13] god made them that way
[34:16] thank you for that amen brother peter
[34:19] all these believers
[34:22] now brother branham said all these
[34:24] believers he's talking about abraham and
[34:26] lord he said this we could go on for
[34:27] hours all these were like a bunch of
[34:28] change
[34:29] out of your pocket if you're at home and
[34:32] you're listening maybe you've got a
[34:33] pocket full of change we don't really
[34:34] carry as much change as we used to i
[34:37] actually throw it in my truck but in my
[34:39] truck in a cup holder there's a whole
[34:41] cup holder whole little pocket there
[34:43] full of change
[34:45] he said you pull out a bunch of chains
[34:47] there's pennies
[34:48] nickels
[34:49] dimes quarters
[34:51] half dollars
[34:53] dollars all in coins
[34:55] now anymore you may not even bend over
[34:57] to pick up a penny
[34:59] but some people would my daughter melody
[35:01] would pick up a penny she does that
[35:02] sometimes
[35:03] she would pick up a penny and and gather
[35:06] it up but it's hard
[35:08] sometimes to even be worth picking up a
[35:09] penny but there's a worth there but if
[35:11] you saw a silver dollar you'd pick that
[35:13] up
[35:13] because it still has some worth to it
[35:15] but even a penny if you get enough of
[35:17] them has a place
[35:19] in the economy of god
[35:21] and that's why the pennies by the way
[35:23] are much more plentiful
[35:25] than the dimes than the nickels then the
[35:27] half dollars and the dollars the pennies
[35:29] are much more plentiful because it takes
[35:31] way more of them to do anything
[35:34] that's right even in the even in the
[35:36] church we could bring it on down to the
[35:37] local church we could we could bring it
[35:39] down to the bride as a whole but the
[35:40] pennies are much more plentiful don't
[35:42] discount the pennies because they're
[35:44] needed actually needed to keep the
[35:46] program of god going that god needs them
[35:49] he has a use for them they're just
[35:50] depending but they're god's change
[35:53] he said now that's what the world is in
[35:55] god's hand there are some people that
[35:57] just can have a pennies worth of it god
[36:00] can only use them in a penny way that's
[36:02] all they can buy don't reject them
[36:05] oh i love this he said don't reject them
[36:08] if they can't believe the real truth
[36:11] don't turn them down
[36:13] don't kick them out and say they're not
[36:15] in it because god uses
[36:17] pennies
[36:18] sometimes
[36:20] god uses pennies
[36:23] sometimes
[36:24] law was just a penny
[36:26] abraham was a silver dollar
[36:28] so it taken a hundred lots to make it
[36:30] abraham and so will it take a hundred
[36:33] carnal believers we'll never stand in
[36:35] the presence of a genuine christian
[36:36] that's amen that's separated from the
[36:38] carnal things of the world living in
[36:40] christ jesus where the word can flow
[36:42] through him so you say well if there's
[36:43] no difference i'll just be opinion no
[36:45] god made you to be more than that
[36:48] and i was as i've said many times
[36:50] the daryl ward told me years ago he said
[36:52] if you may only be a 10 cent preacher he
[36:54] said but if you're not all that you
[36:56] should be he said you're robbing god he
[36:58] said you're robbing god of five cents
[37:00] if you're only a nickel you're robbing
[37:02] god of five cents he made you to be
[37:03] something be all that he made you to be
[37:07] a hundred carnal believers could never
[37:08] stand in the presence of a of an abraham
[37:11] but yet those are needed
[37:14] a hundred carnal believers are needed
[37:16] many of them may even be there be in the
[37:18] book have their names in the book of
[37:19] life but only be
[37:20] a penny but thank god there's a silver
[37:23] dollar because no one can replace that
[37:25] there's got to be a silver dollar and
[37:27] i'll say as we've been saying recently
[37:29] there's got to be a bride at the end
[37:31] time there's got to be a people who
[37:32] don't make it just by the skin of their
[37:34] teeth god's not going to have a bunch of
[37:36] silver dollars out of the efficient age
[37:38] and silver dollars out of the thigh
[37:40] tyrant agent silver dollars out of
[37:41] philadelphia and then just a bunch of
[37:43] pennies and labels to see him god's got
[37:45] some silver dollars in laodicea that's
[37:47] willing to fight against the spirit of
[37:49] the age it's willing to not be lukewarm
[37:51] that's willing even if they're at home
[37:53] streaming they're willing to be on fire
[37:56] for god in their heart even if they're
[37:58] at the at work on the job they're
[38:00] willing to be on fire for god in their
[38:02] heart why there's something more than a
[38:04] penny
[38:04] there's something that god placed in
[38:06] them that's more than just a penny's
[38:08] worth it's a silver dollar it's meant to
[38:10] be a light to the world why do you
[38:12] christians why you ladies dress the way
[38:13] that you do why do you men act the way
[38:15] that you do because you're more than
[38:17] just a penny you're a silver dollar god
[38:19] puts something inside of you that's
[38:20] worth more
[38:23] hey man
[38:25] it's worth more
[38:26] you can only take a penny's worth
[38:29] he said lot was just
[38:32] let's go back he says he can only take a
[38:34] penny's worth that's all he's got
[38:37] he said that's all he's got so you see
[38:39] people that say i don't believe in
[38:40] divine healing
[38:41] he says i don't believe in those things
[38:43] just know that it's a penny
[38:45] but just let him alone
[38:48] he said just let him alone
[38:51] and
[38:52] he said
[38:53] he said i don't believe in a penny just
[38:55] he said i don't believe in these things
[38:56] just know it's a penny
[38:57] but just let him
[38:59] alone
[39:00] he said see just a penny's worth and so
[39:02] that's all he can buy don't stop him
[39:05] just let him alone remember that's just
[39:08] all the farther he can go
[39:11] and he goes on and he kind of apologizes
[39:13] for that statement
[39:15] he said i didn't really mean that the
[39:16] way it sounds
[39:17] he says well he said i mean if he just
[39:19] well i belong to this and that's what we
[39:21] believe he said it's just a penny go
[39:22] ahead see just a penny he said say well
[39:24] the lord bless you my brother well
[39:27] that's what we ought to say to the penny
[39:28] the lord bless you how much more the
[39:30] silver dollar
[39:32] see he said he's copper he can never be
[39:33] silver that's it so just let it go
[39:36] that's why he only shows up every now
[39:37] and then at church he's copper
[39:40] he can't he can't ever be a silver
[39:41] dollar but let him be what he is
[39:44] if you if you throw him out there let
[39:46] him be a copper if there's any use for
[39:48] him at all and some people
[39:50] really you know they make more trouble
[39:52] than what it seems like they're worth
[39:53] but if there can be just a penny and
[39:55] they can sit there and smile during the
[39:56] service if they can just hold the door
[39:58] open during this or whatever it is maybe
[40:00] they're a penny but god made them that
[40:02] but you'd be surprised who the silver
[40:04] dollars are the silver dollars may not
[40:06] be who we think they are they may not
[40:08] always be the people that do the most in
[40:11] the in the house of god that may be a
[40:13] pennies worth to god but god may take a
[40:15] little woman that's sitting at home
[40:16] tonight that really gets in touch with
[40:18] god by prayer that does nothing in the
[40:20] church but really gets a hold of god a
[40:22] prayer warrior that can shake the heaven
[40:24] god may take a little woman like that a
[40:26] little family that serves god with all
[40:28] the heart does nothing in the church god
[40:29] may grab a hold of those people and
[40:31] actually do more with them that may be
[40:34] the silver dollar and there may be some
[40:35] preacher pennies out there
[40:37] but don't throw away the penny just
[40:38] because he's copper that's it just just
[40:40] let it go ahead god can use him
[40:43] he said oh he is using it
[40:45] he is using it
[40:48] oh my he said i'd rather see him down
[40:50] there in a church than to see a bar room
[40:52] standing there on the corner
[40:54] wouldn't you
[40:56] i wonder sometimes
[40:57] he said sure he said so just let it
[40:59] alone
[41:00] god can use it anyhow you say well that
[41:02] church started wrong
[41:04] that church doesn't deserve to be a
[41:05] church
[41:06] maybe it's a penny
[41:08] brother brandon said let it alone
[41:11] that church isn't what
[41:13] they're not on the in crowd they started
[41:14] in the wrong way they're a split or
[41:16] something else let them alone god can
[41:18] use it he said maybe not very much but
[41:21] he'll use what he can use as much as
[41:23] they let him use
[41:24] maybe they'll let him use him use them
[41:27] more than the pharisee will
[41:30] see we can't change a penny into a
[41:31] silver dollar you can't change a silver
[41:33] dollar into a penny
[41:35] you but let them alone
[41:37] don't be a part of that system now you
[41:38] don't become a penny you don't try to go
[41:41] changing all the pennies that's not what
[41:42] we do
[41:43] no we we preach the to the elect and we
[41:46] preach to the pennies and we preach to
[41:48] the dimes we preach to the half dollars
[41:50] we preach to the silver dollars
[41:52] but we don't quit preaching a silver
[41:54] dollar message we continue to preach
[41:56] that we don't go back into
[41:57] denominationalism let them alone don't
[42:00] be a part of that system they couldn't
[42:01] understand the word it doesn't
[42:03] necessarily mean they go to hell it just
[42:05] means they're a penny in the economy of
[42:07] god
[42:09] brother branham talks about a man who is
[42:10] arguing against divine healing
[42:12] now it's interesting because there's two
[42:14] classes of people there's a class of
[42:17] people who are apostate in the sense
[42:18] that they can see
[42:20] what the truth is from an intellectual
[42:22] standpoint
[42:23] but they turn around and walk away from
[42:25] it that's an apostate
[42:27] and they can't ever be saved frankly but
[42:30] a person could look right at it and not
[42:32] be able to see it even like paul who was
[42:34] blinded up to a point until god opened
[42:36] his eyes
[42:38] a person could could look right at it
[42:40] and not be able to see it
[42:42] and then some people are never able to
[42:43] see it but yet they're not rejecting it
[42:46] because
[42:47] because they see it and they don't want
[42:49] it they're rejecting it because they
[42:51] don't understand it some people don't
[42:53] that person may not necessarily be bound
[42:56] for hell it may be someone who's a penny
[43:00] let's look at this there was a man
[43:01] arguing against divine healing
[43:04] and brother branham talks about how that
[43:05] he he went on he said i don't believe it
[43:08] and he said well it's not for
[43:09] unbelievers and in paragraph 166
[43:13] here of
[43:14] uh the sermon is the seventh seal in
[43:17] paragraph 166 he said i wouldn't believe
[43:19] i don't care what you could do how much
[43:21] evidence you can prove or anything like
[43:22] that i still don't believe it i said
[43:25] certainly it wasn't for unbelievers it
[43:26] was only for believers that's it
[43:28] what was it see he said you know right
[43:30] then the election is off
[43:32] the election is off i mean he can't be a
[43:35] penny but he's not a silver dollar he
[43:37] said don't fool with it at all
[43:39] don't fool with it at all jesus did the
[43:41] same thing he said let them alone if the
[43:43] blind leads the blind won't they all
[43:45] fall in the ditch
[43:47] but when he come i love this part
[43:49] because this is me
[43:51] when he come to a little prostitute when
[43:53] it comes to someone who was unworthy
[43:55] he snapped his finger he said it struck
[43:57] fire what was it it was an elected sea
[44:00] laying there that's seen it right now
[44:02] oh my oh what a blessing it is tonight
[44:05] if you can see the word of god when it's
[44:06] presented to you grab hold of it what a
[44:08] blessing that is to you
[44:10] he can see it right now he said when it
[44:12] come to peter there was elected seed
[44:14] laying there see and they saw it and all
[44:17] the fathers give half past tense given
[44:20] me they'll come they'll come to me oh my
[44:22] i love that yes sir notice the believers
[44:24] does believe it or if i had people here
[44:27] tonight we'd have a shout and spell
[44:30] maybe just uh my family will do that but
[44:32] you can have one at home i'll give you
[44:33] permission to do that the believers does
[44:36] believe it
[44:37] they does believe it even if there's
[44:39] snow on the ground they doesn't believe
[44:41] it amen if i can use the wrong english
[44:43] there
[44:43] if the believers does believe it the
[44:45] people of god are always going to
[44:47] believe god's word everyone else may
[44:49] turn it down but the believers does
[44:51] believe it
[44:53] hallelujah the unbelievers can't believe
[44:56] it
[44:57] he said so now if anybody wants to argue
[44:59] about the serpent seed and things and
[45:01] you try to show them they won't listen
[45:02] to it just walk away he said just leave
[45:06] them alone
[45:07] now listen he said see god don't argue
[45:11] neither does his children
[45:13] oh i wish we could underline that
[45:16] you got the seventh seal book at home
[45:18] maybe you could grab that and look at
[45:19] paragraph 170 and underline that put
[45:21] that on your refrigerator god don't
[45:23] argue
[45:24] neither does
[45:26] his children
[45:28] he said notice god's 144 thousand
[45:31] elected jews don't battle the beast
[45:33] now watch he's talking about the silver
[45:35] dollar now the elected
[45:37] here's how they are they don't bow to
[45:38] the beast
[45:39] it's denominationalism or statues or
[45:41] anything because in that jewish group
[45:43] there's the same as in the gentiles
[45:45] there's an elected group who 144 000
[45:48] there was those under the altar that
[45:50] fell
[45:51] under hitler and eichmann but now here's
[45:52] an elected group 144 thousand jews
[45:55] that's not going to do it he said
[45:58] he said that anything he said though
[45:59] their nation is in a covenant with it at
[46:01] the time
[46:02] israel is in a covenant but here is 144
[46:05] 000 that's not going to do it he said
[46:07] that's
[46:08] the elected
[46:11] same thing it is right here in the
[46:13] gentile church now
[46:14] he said is an elected group
[46:16] you can't pull them in that kind of
[46:18] stuff
[46:19] they won't believe it no sir when the
[46:21] light once struck them that settles it
[46:24] right then
[46:25] they see it happen then see it
[46:27] vindicated and proved
[46:30] like that now watch the characteristics
[46:32] of this elected group aren't you glad
[46:34] you're one of the elect tonight
[46:36] watch the characteristic of this
[46:37] electric elected group he said they look
[46:40] down here in the bible see that word
[46:43] just going that word is going like the
[46:46] wheel in the middle of the wheel it was
[46:48] moving it was always moving that's the
[46:50] way the word is it's always moving it's
[46:52] not a god of yesterday a god of 40 years
[46:55] ago a god of 400 years ago or 2 000
[46:58] years ago but a god of today the same
[47:01] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[47:03] and forever the word is moving for the
[47:06] elect
[47:07] for the elect the word moose but for the
[47:09] others for the pennies it just it just
[47:12] seems like it sits real still
[47:14] they always look back and say well
[47:16] things were better in the 70s things
[47:18] were better when brother branham was
[47:19] here things were better some other time
[47:21] in some other place
[47:22] but the for the elect the word moves
[47:25] he said that he said
[47:27] he said they'd look down here in the
[47:28] bible and see that word just going he
[47:31] said well you might as well well i love
[47:33] this just like you quit fooling with
[47:34] those others you know they're not elect
[47:36] he said you just quit fooling with them
[47:38] the elect because they believe it that's
[47:40] all he said they though they can't
[47:41] explain it i love this though they can't
[47:44] explain it but they know
[47:46] they got it
[47:48] they know they got it see he said so as
[47:50] i say there's a lot of things i can't
[47:52] explain
[47:53] but i know it's real anyhow
[47:56] oh if we could ever get down it's not an
[47:57] intellectual faith being elected is not
[48:00] about intellectually understanding
[48:02] everything that goes on in the messenger
[48:04] or that brother branham said but being
[48:05] elected of god is about knowing who you
[48:08] are it's about saying i may not be able
[48:10] to explain it but i know i got it
[48:12] hallelujah i know it's real anyhow i
[48:15] know it's real i was there when it
[48:17] happened the bible says and i guess or
[48:19] the song says i guess i ought to know
[48:22] amen
[48:24] let's look at the foolish virgin real
[48:25] quick what about them
[48:28] what about the foolish virgin after the
[48:30] bride is raptured
[48:33] will any of the foolish virgins be saved
[48:35] or will they all be lost
[48:38] brother branham takes that he says no
[48:39] see everything will be finished for the
[48:41] gentile church
[48:42] when will it be finished let's keep our
[48:44] balance here in these looking at the
[48:46] breach
[48:47] he said when will we finish for the
[48:49] gentile church when the bride is taken
[48:51] from the earth
[48:53] that's when it's finished the spirit of
[48:54] god leaves the earth
[48:56] he that's filthy is filthy still
[48:59] he that's righteous is righteous still
[49:02] he that's holy is holy still
[49:04] in other words the sanctuary becomes
[49:06] smoky
[49:07] where the attorney stands to plead the
[49:09] case
[49:10] christ leaves the sanctuary his day of
[49:12] mediatorial is over
[49:13] the rapture comes that's when it happens
[49:16] he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth
[49:18] and takes the book of redemption and
[49:19] claims everything he redeemed there's no
[49:22] more mediatorial work how many
[49:23] understands that
[49:25] now just a minute will the foolish
[49:26] virgin be saved no
[49:28] whatever happens happens
[49:30] now
[49:31] and i can't fully explain that to you
[49:33] but there's a level of salvation that
[49:36] they enter into
[49:38] though they're foolish
[49:40] they are virgins and there's an element
[49:42] of salvation that they enter into but
[49:44] not the fullness of it so they have to
[49:46] go through tribulation now
[49:48] he said after that time she's in the
[49:50] state now she will have to go through
[49:51] the tribulation period and the reason of
[49:54] it is because she is rejected no notice
[49:56] she rejected what the atonement in its
[49:58] fullness
[50:00] as i said not rejected it not going up
[50:01] to the border and seeing it and then
[50:03] turning around but actually rejecting it
[50:06] because you can't see it she has
[50:08] rejected the atonement in his fullness
[50:10] she's a believer a professed believer
[50:12] but she will have to go through the
[50:14] tribulation
[50:15] period
[50:16] that's from questions and answers number
[50:18] two in 1964.
[50:20] now again brother branham and i'm just
[50:22] i'm not reading these entire quotes you
[50:24] can go back and read the rest of them we
[50:25] won't have time this afternoon or this
[50:28] evening but just to kind of punch this
[50:29] real real hard really quick and then
[50:31] we'll we'll close
[50:33] but i guess i don't have to worry about
[50:34] holding you too much you can get up and
[50:36] go get a drink if you need to but
[50:39] but i don't want to hold my family too
[50:40] long
[50:41] now
[50:42] he said she
[50:44] uh the first thing he said
[50:46] the sixth seal he's talking about the
[50:48] sixth seal he said it was for a
[50:49] threefold purpose
[50:51] he said here was the purposes the first
[50:52] thing was that the sleeping virgin had
[50:54] to go through the tribulation period for
[50:56] purification she had to be purged over
[50:59] sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[51:01] message
[51:03] well if she rejected the message she's
[51:05] not even in the economy of god well it
[51:07] depends on why she rejected it
[51:09] i had someone heard someone say it
[51:11] always meant a lot to me they said
[51:13] everybody likes water but you don't want
[51:15] it thrown in your face
[51:17] so why did they reject it they were
[51:18] blinded for by something maybe actions
[51:21] of people in the message that they were
[51:23] blinded by but they were blinded by
[51:25] these things they were unable to be
[51:28] purged
[51:29] at during this time by the message of
[51:31] the hour they were not washed in the
[51:33] word because they were blinded for some
[51:35] reason they were not the elect of god so
[51:37] they had to be purged over sins of
[51:39] unbelief and rejecting the message this
[51:41] she was done in the tribulation period
[51:43] he said no she is not the bride but it's
[51:45] the church the pure people that didn't
[51:46] have the opportunity maybe to receive
[51:48] the message or in some way that they
[51:51] were blinded by these false prophets
[51:54] and they didn't get a chance and yet
[51:56] they're really sincere in heart now
[51:58] there's the key they're really sincere
[52:00] in heart and god knows their heart and
[52:03] here they are purged
[52:04] during this time
[52:06] again he says judgment was said the
[52:09] books was open books was open another
[52:11] book was open which was the book of life
[52:13] he separated from there the goats from
[52:15] the sheep is that right that had nothing
[52:17] to do with the bride she was standing
[52:19] right there in judgment the queen and
[52:21] the king
[52:22] together
[52:23] he come with his saints ten thousand
[52:25] times ten thousand ministered to him his
[52:28] wife then judgment was set and then the
[52:30] sheep was separated from the ghosts
[52:32] remember the other night me bringing now
[52:34] watch what he comes back to this is in
[52:36] questions and answers on the seals and
[52:38] he comes back this is sunday morning
[52:40] after the breach he had preached the
[52:41] previous week and he preached the seals
[52:44] all down through the week and he goes
[52:46] back to the breach of what we read
[52:47] earlier remember he said the other night
[52:49] me bringing that little meditation so
[52:51] you'd understand it the cowboy
[52:53] meditation
[52:54] so when god wanted us to understand the
[52:57] white throne judgment
[52:59] he gave a poem
[53:01] to a cowboy
[53:03] we don't even know if he was saved
[53:05] think about it church oh isn't god good
[53:08] we don't even know if he was saved but
[53:10] he gave a poem to a cowboy and it become
[53:12] a cowboy meditation
[53:14] and brother branham heard it
[53:16] and god inspired him in the breach to go
[53:19] and recite that poem and talk about the
[53:21] owner and the boss of the writers so
[53:23] that we would understand what the
[53:25] judgment would be like
[53:26] the separating of the sheep
[53:28] from the goats
[53:30] god didn't choose a great theologian or
[53:32] a great bunch of a language that was
[53:34] high for luton language but he chose to
[53:36] tell a story
[53:37] and give a little poem about a few cows
[53:41] that were being rounded up
[53:43] that great roundup in the sky oh my
[53:45] god uses things like that doesn't he he
[53:48] said remember me bringing that little
[53:49] meditation so you'd understand it aren't
[53:52] you glad that the god who created the
[53:53] universe is little enough that he can
[53:55] come down and use things that's what
[53:57] jesus did he come down and he talked
[53:59] about little things that the people
[54:00] would understand he talked about sower
[54:03] sowing seeds he talked about the country
[54:05] people would understand he talked about
[54:07] servants and about talents and about
[54:09] fish and about all these other things
[54:11] why did he talk about those things
[54:12] because the common people would hear him
[54:14] gladly that's the same thing we have
[54:16] happened in our time but the message of
[54:18] the hour
[54:19] he gave that cowboy meditation so you
[54:21] would understand
[54:22] he said no he said see that's the church
[54:25] the people that's in denominations that
[54:27] are genuine christians
[54:28] who receives the message
[54:30] he said and they will never
[54:32] see it
[54:34] it don't mean they never got a book or
[54:35] they never
[54:36] heard a tape
[54:38] but they don't see it
[54:40] they can't they can't understand it
[54:42] it'll never they don't they don't
[54:44] necessarily reject it but they just
[54:45] don't see it
[54:47] it'll never be preached to them
[54:50] and those who said in mixed crowds
[54:52] who it is preached to
[54:54] it'll go right over the top of their
[54:56] heads unless their name
[54:58] was on the lamb's book of life
[55:00] oh i'm so glad my name was on the lamb's
[55:03] book of life
[55:05] because it didn't go over the top of my
[55:06] head i heard it i may not understand all
[55:08] the ins and outs but i knew that's for
[55:10] me
[55:10] i heard the scream of the eagle and i
[55:12] said mama
[55:13] that's me
[55:15] he said but they will be good people
[55:18] they'll be raised up again and given
[55:19] trial
[55:21] and be judged now listen
[55:23] i love this be judged by the very group
[55:26] that preached to them
[55:28] don't you know the saints will judge the
[55:30] earth
[55:31] he said they'll be preached to see
[55:33] they'll be preached to by the very same
[55:35] people
[55:36] witness to them of the message
[55:39] to come out of it
[55:41] they'll be preached to by the same
[55:43] people who witnessed
[55:45] some of the people that i've preached to
[55:47] over the years other ministers that are
[55:49] listening some of the people that you
[55:50] preached over the years some of the
[55:52] people that you all have witnessed to
[55:53] over the years and they've sat there and
[55:54] said well i know brother branham was a
[55:56] prophet but i just can't see it i just
[55:57] can't understand it i just can't seem to
[55:59] live it don't you know one day you'll
[56:00] preach to them again
[56:02] you'll preach to them and they'll be
[56:04] given an opportunity
[56:06] amen
[56:07] amen
[56:09] look
[56:12] see the bible says we've used this
[56:14] before but the bible says the spirit and
[56:15] the bride
[56:16] say come
[56:19] oh that we don't ever quit preaching
[56:21] don't let the devil tell you that it's a
[56:23] lie of the devil we don't ever quit
[56:24] preaching
[56:25] don't never quit preaching because the
[56:27] people that you preach to you'll preach
[56:29] to them again one day they don't receive
[56:31] it they laugh in your face and call you
[56:34] names you'll preach to them but you'll
[56:36] preach to those who are good to the
[56:37] bride as well
[56:38] you'll preach to them they'll be
[56:39] preached to you by the very same people
[56:41] witness to them with the message spirit
[56:44] and the bride say come the bride's got
[56:45] something to say that's why we've got to
[56:48] preach it it's not enough just for a
[56:49] prophet to say it on tape we've got to
[56:51] preach it because we've got to stand
[56:53] before our generation let me tell you
[56:54] this brother branham will stand before
[56:56] those he preached to but i'll stand
[56:58] before those i preach to you'll stand
[57:00] before those you witness to i wonder how
[57:02] many will be in that group of people
[57:04] that you witnessed to you told them
[57:06] about the message but they couldn't see
[57:07] it for some reason but they'll be given
[57:09] an opportunity at that time
[57:11] and be judged according to their works
[57:14] and the spirit and the bride say come
[57:17] let him
[57:18] that heareth
[57:19] say come notice the bride is saying come
[57:22] and let him that heareth say come let
[57:24] him that is a thirst come
[57:26] and whosoever will
[57:28] let him take the water of life
[57:30] freely as we've said before that should
[57:32] be the attitude of the bride
[57:34] during this hour
[57:37] listen to me tonight the tribulation
[57:39] period is a time
[57:41] that you don't want to be in
[57:43] be the worst time
[57:45] that the world has ever known
[57:47] it'll be a time
[57:50] of men who cry out for the rocks and the
[57:52] mountains to fall down on them
[57:54] yet they will still not repent
[57:57] it'll be a time
[57:58] when women will see
[58:00] visions of of locusts with long hair
[58:03] and they'll see it coming on them and
[58:05] these awful things that you see in the
[58:07] movies will begin to come on the earth
[58:08] you don't want to be here during those
[58:10] three and a half years if you think the
[58:11] last two years has been rough you ought
[58:13] to see the next three and a half that's
[58:15] coming
[58:16] don't be a rejecter of the atonement
[58:18] during this time don't be somebody who
[58:21] turns it down but be somebody be a
[58:23] believer tonight a believer believes
[58:25] it's just what they do they hear the
[58:27] message and they grab hold of it they
[58:29] believe it whatever a prophet said
[58:31] that's what i believe whatever is
[58:32] written in the word that's what i
[58:34] believe this book is me this belongs to
[58:36] me i'm a believer i believe it i don't
[58:39] want to go through that tribulation time
[58:40] be a believer not double not someone who
[58:43] sees god 40 years ago or 100 years ago
[58:46] but someone who sees god right now
[58:48] someone who sees him moving the wheel in
[58:50] the middle of the wheel moving in his
[58:52] word moving in his bride today be in
[58:54] that elected group because you don't
[58:56] want to go through
[58:57] the tribulation period
[58:59] the foolish rejecters will reject
[59:01] because they cannot see it
[59:03] the willful willful rejecters will end
[59:05] up in the lake of fire
[59:06] but the boss of the writers is coming by
[59:09] and he'll point out
[59:11] which ones have the blood tag
[59:13] which ones have the token
[59:15] and they'll be identified in the hour
[59:17] that we live in don't you want to be one
[59:18] of those would you bow your heads with
[59:20] me one more time
[59:27] have you just taken this time to
[59:30] to fellowship and around the word
[59:32] i trust that you'd have could have a
[59:34] time of prayer there with your families
[59:36] and just reflect on these things lord
[59:39] what does this mean to me and my family
[59:41] i don't want to be a rejecter i want to
[59:43] be a believer
[59:44] someone who sees it someone who grabs
[59:45] hold or may not understand all the ins
[59:47] and outs of it but i believe it there's
[59:49] something about me that believes it
[59:51] heavenly father we love you today
[59:53] we thank you for your word
[59:55] we thank you lord for your presence that
[59:57] we feel
