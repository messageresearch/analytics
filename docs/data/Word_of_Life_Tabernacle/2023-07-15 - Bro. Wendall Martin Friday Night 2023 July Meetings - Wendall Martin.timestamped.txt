[1:23:23] little bit on
[1:23:25] Amen Thanksgiving unto the Lord as our
[1:23:30] brother
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:33] Glover mentioned last night and didn't
[1:23:35] brother Glover do such a wonderful job
[1:23:37] last night that was that was a wonderful
[1:23:40] message brother
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:44] and his scripture that he that he
[1:23:47] started with is this poor man cried
[1:23:50] and the Lord heard
[1:23:52] and the Lord delivered him out of all of
[1:23:56] his troubles
[1:23:57] this poor man cried David knew what it
[1:24:00] was he knew what troubles were all about
[1:24:05] I I think David we could read through
[1:24:07] the psalmist David was pretty
[1:24:08] transparent with his with his trials and
[1:24:11] the situations that he went through and
[1:24:13] brother uh the psalmist David went
[1:24:16] through a lot of Trials
[1:24:18] you can read in the Bible and and there
[1:24:20] he was anointed to be king and the next
[1:24:22] thing he knows he's he is out being
[1:24:24] chased by the king himself and he's
[1:24:27] living in caves David knows what it is
[1:24:30] to have to call unto the Lord and rely
[1:24:32] upon the Lord
[1:24:34] amen but but here we're when we look at
[1:24:38] this scripture that we're just reading
[1:24:41] David is is wanting to express something
[1:24:45] unto the Lord amen another place there
[1:24:48] in Psalms 103 and 1. he says bless the
[1:24:52] Lord all my soul and all that is within
[1:24:56] me bless His holy name
[1:24:59] bless the Lord somebody say bless the
[1:25:02] Lord
[1:25:03] all my soul and forget not all of his
[1:25:06] benefits
[1:25:08] who forgives all thine iniquities and
[1:25:10] who heals all thine diseases who redeems
[1:25:14] thy life from destruction who crowneth
[1:25:18] thee with loving kindness and tender
[1:25:19] Mercy who satisfy thy mouth with good
[1:25:23] things so that thy youth is renewed like
[1:25:26] unlike the Eagles
[1:25:28] as I begin to look at this what an
[1:25:32] incredible pyramid and David must have
[1:25:34] had is the man as he's looking back at
[1:25:39] what God has done for him and I think we
[1:25:42] could all even look back to that and how
[1:25:43] you've had some of those prayer meetings
[1:25:45] where you've where you've just begin to
[1:25:46] reminisce begin to go back and think
[1:25:49] about what God has done for you you've
[1:25:52] went back and seen that God's been
[1:25:54] faithful to you
[1:25:58] have survived
[1:25:59] four of God was with you when when it
[1:26:02] looked like everything else was gone and
[1:26:04] you were down for the last count no can
[1:26:06] you say man looking back where he
[1:26:09] brought you from and now he's
[1:26:10] established you upon his word amen God's
[1:26:14] been good to you I I think about David
[1:26:17] as he's reflecting on these things and
[1:26:19] his man and there must be something that
[1:26:22] begins to welm up in him bless the Lord
[1:26:25] oh my soul I I don't want it just to be
[1:26:28] a recipient of what you've done for me
[1:26:30] but I want to make sure that you know
[1:26:31] that I know that you have been good to
[1:26:34] me I want you to know that I know and
[1:26:37] that I am thankful for the blessings
[1:26:39] that you have given me I want you to
[1:26:42] know with everything that is within me
[1:26:44] that I am thankful for what you have
[1:26:48] given me in my life is there anybody in
[1:26:50] this building that is thankful to the
[1:26:53] Lord for His blessings upon your life
[1:26:56] amen you see when you look at this a man
[1:27:01] this desire it was a response what
[1:27:03] caused this response to uh from David
[1:27:07] brother uh or brother Branham would say
[1:27:09] it's a reaction to an action it's
[1:27:13] because God has been so good that David
[1:27:17] is now looking back and saying thank you
[1:27:20] for being good
[1:27:22] oh my too many times we come to church
[1:27:25] and we just sit here as you know knots
[1:27:27] on a log and and and we don't know what
[1:27:31] it is to live in Victory because we're
[1:27:32] not living in Victory at home but if you
[1:27:34] ever get in Victory at home that you'll
[1:27:36] have victory in the church
[1:27:38] when you have a think how he raised me
[1:27:41] how he lifted me up and turned me around
[1:27:45] how he placed my feet
[1:27:48] On Solid Ground it makes me want to
[1:27:53] shout
[1:27:55] hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord I love
[1:27:59] you amen I don't know how the rest of it
[1:28:01] goes praise the Lord amen but it's but
[1:28:04] but it's a song of thanks
[1:28:07] unto the Lord can you say Amen
[1:28:10] and I think David must have been really
[1:28:12] a man he must have got beside himself as
[1:28:15] he began to think about how God had been
[1:28:18] good to him how God had forgiven oh
[1:28:21] David had some problems in his life
[1:28:22] David had some situations in his life
[1:28:24] that looked pretty bleak amen but God
[1:28:27] forgave David and God brought him out
[1:28:29] and God redeemed David and God's loving
[1:28:31] kindness was with David and God's Tender
[1:28:34] Mercies never went out
[1:28:37] if it was thankful can you see man man
[1:28:41] what a reaction
[1:28:43] bless the Lord
[1:28:44] O my soul
[1:28:46] what a reaction a man that word bless it
[1:28:51] means to kneel it means to adore
[1:28:54] it means to salute
[1:28:56] it means to praise
[1:28:59] I will bless him with all of my might my
[1:29:04] soul and my strength there in Psalm 63
[1:29:07] and 3 it says because somebody say
[1:29:09] because
[1:29:11] thy loving kindness is better than my
[1:29:14] life then my lips
[1:29:17] shall praise thee somebody say because
[1:29:21] thy loving kindness is better
[1:29:25] Hallelujah my
[1:29:28] praise thee
[1:29:30] will I
[1:29:33] while I live I will lift up my hands in
[1:29:37] thy name my soul shall be satisfied as
[1:29:41] with moral and fatness and my mouth
[1:29:43] shall praise thee with joyful lips when
[1:29:46] I remember thee upon my bed and I
[1:29:51] meditate on thee in the night watches be
[1:29:55] clouds thou has been my help oh can I
[1:29:59] get a witness you see when you're
[1:30:01] looking at what he has done for you it
[1:30:06] creates a praise on the inside of your
[1:30:09] heart Hallelujah I think we need to go
[1:30:12] back tonight and begin to thank God for
[1:30:14] what he has done for us I think we need
[1:30:17] to go back and say God if it hadn't been
[1:30:19] for your grace if it hadn't been for
[1:30:22] your mercy if it hadn't been for your
[1:30:24] love amen this boy would not be here
[1:30:28] tonight but it's been because of your
[1:30:30] divine grace
[1:30:35] Hallelujah
[1:30:36] how can you say man amen because thou
[1:30:40] has been my help amen therefore in the
[1:30:44] shadow of thy wings
[1:30:46] will I rejoice
[1:30:50] that said there in second Peter 1 and
[1:30:53] 13.

[1:31:24] up in our heart there should be
[1:31:25] something amen that is bubbling up
[1:31:27] because God's been good to me
[1:31:29] man my boy shouldn't be here tonight
[1:31:31] amen when he was mama was pregnant with
[1:31:35] him Hallelujah it looked like it was
[1:31:38] totally impossible he was born too much
[1:31:40] premature and and it didn't look too
[1:31:43] good and there I sat at the hospital his
[1:31:46] mom on one into the hospital and I see
[1:31:48] you amen he was in the other end of the
[1:31:50] hospital and a baby I see you and their
[1:31:53] God wasn't given either one of or the
[1:31:55] devil wasn't giving anyone of them any
[1:31:56] chance the doctors had told me it just
[1:31:58] it just doesn't look good Hallelujah but
[1:32:01] I remember the day amen a week or two
[1:32:04] into it amen when the doctor came out
[1:32:07] and said listen something just happened
[1:32:09] to your wife she just lost 10 pounds of
[1:32:14] fluids her kidneys are starting to work
[1:32:16] you see I've got a lot to be thankful
[1:32:19] for
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:23] yeah
[1:32:24] the Daryl there's a reason you're crying
[1:32:27] every time you tell the testimony of
[1:32:29] Jessica
[1:32:30] when you think
[1:32:33] hallelujah oh come on Church God's been
[1:32:36] good to you
[1:32:38] God's been good to you can you say man
[1:32:40] you see amen the Apostle Peter is saying
[1:32:43] I want to stir you up
[1:32:48] by putting you in remembrance
[1:32:51] you've not followed some cunningly
[1:32:53] devised fable
[1:32:54] when we made known unto you the power of
[1:32:56] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:32:58] we're eyewitnesses of his majesty can
[1:33:00] you say man
[1:33:02] I will bless
[1:33:05] somebody say I will bless the Lord
[1:33:10] but you see the word blessed
[1:33:12] did you know bless first belonged
[1:33:16] to the Lord
[1:33:22] the word bless
[1:33:27] the word blessed came from God
[1:33:31] now I want you to think about that there
[1:33:34] it didn't belong to the Mortal being at
[1:33:36] all
[1:33:37] right amen what can you say man
[1:33:39] what by the way what could a mortal man
[1:33:41] ever give to God to make him any greater
[1:33:44] the word bless comes from the Hebrew
[1:33:46] word Barack
[1:33:47] it comes 330 times in the Bible
[1:33:50] and most always it is deity that is
[1:33:54] doing the bestowal
[1:33:56] they're in Genesis 1 and 22 and the
[1:33:58] Bible says and God blessed them
[1:34:01] and saying be fruitful and multiply
[1:34:03] we'll praise the Lord
[1:34:05] you see we think about our blessing we
[1:34:07] think about our giving thanks we think
[1:34:09] about our being a blessing but you see
[1:34:12] God is the one who was the first one to
[1:34:14] blast and it's because of God's
[1:34:16] blessings
[1:34:19] that you can reciprocate and bring back
[1:34:21] and bless him
[1:34:24] well praise the Lord amen all creation
[1:34:28] depends upon that blessing amen the Lord
[1:34:31] is the author of all life the Lord is
[1:34:34] The Giver of all Health the Lord is the
[1:34:37] bestower of all blessings well can y'all
[1:34:40] hear me tonight amen Psalms 104 and 27
[1:34:43] it says these all wait upon thee that
[1:34:47] thou mayest give them their Me In Due
[1:34:50] season that thou give us them they
[1:34:53] gather amen thou openest thine hand and
[1:34:56] they are filled with good thou hidest
[1:34:59] thy face and they are troubled thy
[1:35:02] taketh away their breath and they die
[1:35:04] and return to the dash thou sendeth
[1:35:07] forth thy spirit and they are created
[1:35:11] thou renew us to the face of the Earth
[1:35:14] so if it had not been for the blessings
[1:35:17] of God upon Humanity Humanity would have
[1:35:22] nothing to return with
[1:35:24] that it was God who said and God blessed
[1:35:27] Noah and God blessed Abraham and God
[1:35:31] blessed are y'all hearing me we are
[1:35:34] reliant upon the blessings of God
[1:35:38] Hallelujah we should never get too big
[1:35:40] amen for our britches we should be
[1:35:42] thankful for what God is doing we should
[1:35:44] be thankful amen I have nothing to give
[1:35:47] without you giving it to me first
[1:35:50] praise the Lord
[1:35:52] man
[1:35:54] Abraham
[1:35:55] the central theme to Abraham
[1:35:59] the central theme from God to Abraham is
[1:36:03] what
[1:36:04] God
[1:36:06] blessing Abraham
[1:36:08] we praise the Lord
[1:36:11] I'm saying that if God
[1:36:13] has been good to you
[1:36:17] there should be a desire within us
[1:36:21] to let him know how much we love you
[1:36:25] and you say Amen
[1:36:26] Hallelujah the Bible says there in in
[1:36:29] the book of uh Genesis it says amen uh
[1:36:33] are there in Genesis 28 and 14 and thy
[1:36:37] seed shall be as uh let's see here amen
[1:36:41] uh there your thy seed shall be as the
[1:36:43] dust of the earth and thou shalt spread
[1:36:45] abroad to the west and to the East and
[1:36:47] to the north and to the side and in thee
[1:36:50] and in thy seed shall all the families
[1:36:52] be blessed can you say amen he says I
[1:36:56] Will Bless thee and thou shalt be a
[1:36:59] blessing amen he comes back and he says
[1:37:01] I will bless them that bless thee
[1:37:04] another place he says in thee shall all
[1:37:07] the families of the earth be blessed
[1:37:10] Abraham was blessed because God dealt
[1:37:14] personally with him now now I I want to
[1:37:18] tell you Amen in this in this you know
[1:37:20] this Pentecostal age that we're living
[1:37:22] in to where stuff means blessings you
[1:37:25] know we're thankful for the thing things
[1:37:27] that God gives us but I'm here to tell
[1:37:29] you if God is dealing personally with
[1:37:30] you and revealing himself personally to
[1:37:33] you and showing himself in divine
[1:37:35] revelation to you that you ought to be
[1:37:37] thankfully here because there is no way
[1:37:40] that a man can ever come to God except
[1:37:42] God draws him first except God blesses
[1:37:45] him first except God brings him to
[1:37:48] himself first there is nothing
[1:37:51] what can you say man
[1:37:55] Abraham was blessed
[1:37:57] because God dealt with Abraham well
[1:37:59] praise the Lord
[1:38:01] now lot on the other hand he had a lot
[1:38:05] of materialistic things
[1:38:08] can you say Amen
[1:38:09] he had wealth
[1:38:11] prestige
[1:38:13] he was the mayor of the city
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:16] Mrs Lott was in the High class of
[1:38:19] society
[1:38:20] but hey but lot was not blessed
[1:38:26] you say now how can that be brother
[1:38:28] Wendell he's driving a nice car he's got
[1:38:29] a nice house he's the mayor of the city
[1:38:32] hey man they they are you're hearing me
[1:38:35] but you see he was not blessed God
[1:38:38] appeared unto Abraham he did not appear
[1:38:42] unto lot lot was blinded to the fact
[1:38:45] amen that Sodom was fixing to burn lot
[1:38:48] was blinded to the fact that he was
[1:38:49] fixing to lose his family lot was
[1:38:51] blinded to the fact amen that everything
[1:38:54] he had all of his possessions were
[1:38:57] fixing to burn but it was the blessings
[1:39:00] of God upon Abraham that opened his eyes
[1:39:03] and says I will not hold anything back
[1:39:07] from Abraham
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:10] Abraham was blessed
[1:39:17] but praise the Lord
[1:39:19] now Abraham was over there on the hill
[1:39:22] hot
[1:39:23] living in a tent
[1:39:27] waiting on a promise
[1:39:30] that he had been waiting on for a well a
[1:39:32] million years
[1:39:34] come on church
[1:39:36] amen and the Bible says when God showed
[1:39:39] up on Earth he says let's stop by
[1:39:41] Abraham he's my friend I will not hold
[1:39:46] anything back from Abraham I have
[1:39:51] already blessed Abraham I gave him my
[1:39:55] promise that through Abraham come on
[1:39:58] church amen if God gave his elect that
[1:40:02] promise then there should be a response
[1:40:05] from the elect
[1:40:06] there should be a response from the
[1:40:09] elect saying thank you Lord
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:17] can you see man
[1:40:19] Amen in fact when God appeared on
[1:40:21] Abraham Hallelujah he says they're
[1:40:25] they're in Genesis 18 and 19.
[1:40:28] he says for I know him
[1:40:30] I know him I'm going to stop I'm not
[1:40:33] going to hide anything from Abraham
[1:40:34] for I know him
[1:40:36] that he will command his children in his
[1:40:39] household after him and they shall keep
[1:40:41] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:40:43] judgment and the Lord that the Lord may
[1:40:46] bring upon Abraham that which he has
[1:40:50] spoken unto him
[1:40:51] amen that word command is not being
[1:40:53] bossy it does not mean being demanding
[1:40:56] amen but that word a command it simply
[1:41:00] means to make or create in the sense of
[1:41:03] appearing as a beacon or as a monument
[1:41:05] so the scripture should read this
[1:41:07] Abraham will erect as a beacon or a
[1:41:11] monument or as a token his children and
[1:41:14] his household after him to keep the ways
[1:41:17] of the Lord Abraham is blessed
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:24] I believe it was the psalmist that says
[1:41:27] Thou says seek my face
[1:41:31] and I said thy face will I seek
[1:41:36] it is God that does the drawing
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:42] and it is us that does the responding I
[1:41:46] think we heard a little bit about that
[1:41:48] last night
[1:41:49] the pool
[1:41:51] something pooling something drawing so
[1:41:54] come on church amen when you're in your
[1:41:57] trial you've got a you've got something
[1:41:59] to look at you're either gonna throw up
[1:42:01] those hands and say I believe I trust
[1:42:04] I'm standing on the promise or you're
[1:42:07] going to give in and give out and get
[1:42:09] the belly grubs and get all kinds of
[1:42:11] Amen you know looking at the doubts of
[1:42:14] your life stand upon the promise of God
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:20] can you say man
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:24] you see

[2:11:28] how brother Branham said in this last
[2:11:30] day in when he's opening the seals
[2:11:33] he says now the opening of these seals
[2:11:36] is the time when everything
[2:11:39] must worship
[2:11:44] come on everything must worship
[2:11:49] he said John was the type of the Bride
[2:11:51] he says he said John seen his name in
[2:11:54] that book and he got so excited he said
[2:11:56] he was having a Pentecostal Jubilee He
[2:12:00] says if I've ever seen one that's what
[2:12:02] John was having a Pentecostal Jubilee

[2:12:08] they've heard him under the Earth they
[2:12:10] hurt him on the earth they heard it they
[2:12:12] heard John just a shouting glory to God
[2:12:15] he said John must have really been
[2:12:19] heaven
[2:12:23] he said you know why
[2:12:25] because he's seen himself
[2:12:29] in the book
[2:12:31] [Applause]
[2:12:34] it was just guesswork
[2:12:37] but when the book was open yes sir yes

[2:12:42] when the book was open he found that he
[2:12:46] was blessed
[2:12:49] they found his name in the book
[2:12:52] he found that God had him in that word
[2:12:59] so when the book was open John seen his
[2:13:03] name and he begins to praise

[2:13:38] to enjoy it but we want to be blessed
[2:13:43] and the Bible says his your name was
[2:13:45] written

[2:15:44] this that and the other all we want too
[2:15:46] but we want the word to be placed over

[2:15:53] over the people the people can identify

[2:39:21] larger in the room
[2:39:24] that's what we're doing
[2:39:26] I wonder if we've lost our ability to be

[2:40:05] I don't know as a minister I know where
[2:40:08] the windows felt this he Brothers
[2:40:09] sometimes you just just can't touch
[2:40:11] somebody you try and you see them and
[2:40:13] you just can't get through to him and in
[2:40:15] the church they'll be sitting there and
[2:40:16] week after week week after week but one
[2:40:19] day God does something supernaturally in
[2:40:21] their life and all of a sudden they
[2:40:22] begin to hunger for God
[2:40:26] that's everything
[2:40:28] for one person
[2:40:31] sister Stephanie did that for you a
[2:40:33] little over a year ago
[2:40:34] that's why she can praise the Lord
[2:40:36] because she knows what she wants
[2:40:38] and she knows what God did for her
[2:40:41] having changed her life every one of us
[2:40:43] should know that
[2:40:44] all my life you have been faithful

[2:40:52] it wasn't perfect but you loved me
[2:40:56] and I'm gonna bow myself before a mighty
[2:40:58] God

[2:42:52] love him with all your heart if you love
[2:42:54] one another

[2:43:43] that you live inside of us Lord God
[2:43:47] then I believe we'd be a witness to the
[2:43:49] world and maybe we'd find that last seed
[2:43:52] we're looking for out there because the
[2:43:54] prophet of God said when that last seed
[2:43:56] comes in
[2:43:57] we're going to go
