Sun we're so grateful Lord that you've risen all the Gloom the Lord has gone away all the Mist is melted away Lord and we can see you Lord is the living Christ The God Who can take care of us who who intercedes on our behalf we thank you for that tonight I I pray for each one Lord for every need that was mentioned here tonight I think also these folks in Florida Lord with the hurricane bearing down on all my pray you bless them Lord and others Believers in that area but the Jeremy down there Lord about to go to work fixing the the electricity I pray you to help him and keep him safe Lord we we we're a body Lord we need one another for you to help us to know that Lord we thank you for the resurrection Lord that we feel Among Us oh God that we can know that you're alive Lord you're living if you're alive if you're in the house all death has to flee we're thankful for that we pray you to heal every sick body or all those that couldn't be here I pray you bless him tonight keep them safe we pray bless us now as we hear your word in Jesus name amen [Music] Hallelujah and you love the Lord tonight amen Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and then we'll read Romans 8 11. Once Again Luke 24 49 and Romans 8 11. we found last week that the Rising Sun dispels all Gloom amen so aren't you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight why because he he lives he's risen and so that means we preach a resurrected savior a resurrected gospel not a gospel of gloom and doom but one of happiness and joy and peace and a future and hope in a world of darkness and a world of fear in a world of pain and we feel that too because we're human aren't you glad for a message of Hope tonight amen Luke 24 49 says behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high Romans 8 and 11. so there's got to be a power come Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you aren't you glad you have that Spirit tonight amen I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated so the Rising Sun dispels Gloom and brother Branham goes on to explain how that happened he said the Trinity of the devil death hell and the grave for Satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hell and also the grave so I want you to notice now this is Satan encapsulating Lucifer if we could we could call him that by his original name Satan encapsulates the Trinity of the devil he is death hell and the grave because he's the possessor of that he was the possessor of hell he was the possessor of the Grave he was the possessor of death that was his territory that's who he was and that was the Trinity of Satan being caused by one thing that was death he said death you go at the grave and being a sinner you go to hell he said all the very one thing the Trinity of Satan so it's all represented in that one person and that becomes important later on he said all being represented in all the very one thing the Trinity of Satan which was death that had held man in captivity all these years but now he said the true Trinity of God being one manifested in Christ who was life and had broke the seals and conquered the enemy and Rose up the one and true Living God so here on one side is death hell in the grave and here is the Father the Son the holy spirit encapsulated in one Christ one anointed one who rose up from the grave broke the seals conquered the enemy you want to see who God is that's God that's God that's who he is Christ the Risen Savior the raising in a body but he didn't stay in that form but he poured himself out all the quality that was in Christ everything that he was he poured into the church do we believe that tonight we understand that from the unveiling of God that God in morphy changed his Mast from being the son that Rose from the grave he changed it that God came and dwelt in his people and he lives in you and I tonight that's quickening power amen so he rose up the one and true Living God I'm he that was dead and I'm Alive forevermore and have the keys of death in hell so the Trinity of God overcame the Trinity of Satan Satan you understand how brother Brown is using the word Trinity we don't believe in three different persons we believe in one person Jesus Christ all of those manifestations in Christ and so he said the true the Trinity of God being one manifested in Christ he said I'm he that was dead and I'm Alive forevermore God he said have the keys of death and held God and one made man and dwelt Among Us and conquered every enemy and had proved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered what does the resurrection do Resurrection proves that Satan has been conquered that's what it does in our lives when there's life among us when when the Resurrection comes in our lives when we're we're raised from the dead it proves that you're not just a church member it proves that you're more than just another follower of the message but there's a there's a reality to it and I want our young people to understand this I want our young married couples to understand this I want our old people to understand this I want to understand this myself that there's got to be at some point in our life where we prove who we are and we'll never prove that we're perfect but but in the flesh but we can prove who we are as Christians we can prove that we are the the seed of God how do we do that by raising from dead trespasses and sins and by living an overcoming life amen and by manifesting the power of God back into our generation amen we're not here just to play Church we're not here just to read sermons or or to or listen to a prophet that's not what we're here for that's baby stuff people can do that and it's good but it's stuff you anybody can do anybody can say they believe in a prophet anybody can come into church and sit on a Pew anybody can do those things but to become the word to become Christ he said well how do I be coming will you become him by by manifesting he is in your life when you would do certain things you don't do those things anymore why because of him and some things you would never do on your own you were you would be unable to do on your own but Christ does it in in you amen he said nothing is impossible to you amen I'm getting ahead of myself tonight but I just want to just just keep preaching it because that's the way brother random presented this if you go listen to the sermon it is the rising of the Sun he said he proved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered and that the Trinity of God was made known because only God Alone had power to bring life back again he was that Emmanuel God had been manifested in the flesh no wonder the Branham goes on to say no wonder he made these claims in Matthew 28 18 Jesus came and spoken to them saying all power someone say all power you know how much that means all of it all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth so how much power does the devil have all power was given to Christ Jason you could answer that then how much power does the devil have none no power well he's a bluff that's what we're taught he's a bluff he's toothless he doesn't have any rights to walk on your land he doesn't have any rights to come against you in sickness he doesn't have any rights he does it but he doesn't have a right to do it which makes him a criminal so we don't have to respect him when he comes in we kick him out right when he comes in our families we kick him out when he comes in the church we kick him out right because we're the beneficiaries of the resurrected Jesus Christ we we have his spirit that same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead we don't have to bow down to those things we don't have to give in to Leo to see us we don't have to give him to deadness and coldness I hope you hear me tonight church we don't have to give in to the way the world's going we can be different we can stand for God we can live for God we can be everything that God wants us to be that's right hey man so he made these claims all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you he says and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world so now he says I have given all power to you and and he said I want you to go and do this all power is given to me so I want you to go and do this using my power and he tells them what to do and then Peter does it on the day of Pentecost then we'll get to that in a moment now he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and come out Triumph with all the power in heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the Holy Ghost and all that there ever was was in him right amen I just love to talk about him don't you amen he said all powers in heaven and on Earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it and I think sometimes we give it I'm gonna try not to editorialize too much tonight because I'm I'm going to be pressed for time but we give things power that don't have any power by just assuming that we can't overcome it but just assuming that we're going to have to bow to it no he has no power Satan is powerless right right everything else is powerless he had conquered it he turned me down a little bit I'm probably hurting somebody's ears they're in the back he said now he said then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for I am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and I have the keys to death and hell I've already conquered it how many believe that tonight don't fear anymore for every someone say every every four ordained predestinated seed of God shall come to life when that light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel don't give up on your children don't give up on your loved ones don't give up on those that are out of the Ark of Safety every predestinated seed oh I'm so glad every one of them will come to life don't fear anymore everyone shall come to life when that light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel he said in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to do he had raised from the dead he said oh what a wonderful thing that is I am alive or quickened the word means the word Quicken he said the Greek word means that something that's made alive after death he said like the seed that goes into the Earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again now let's watch that closely every bit of the seed has to rot so don't think it's strange when you go through trials don't think it's strange because that outer that shell of the seed has got to rot have you ever looked at a seed in the microscope you see there's an outer shell and then there's an inner there's a pulp and there's three parts but the inside of that is a germ of life that's just like you that outer man's got to melt away it's got to got to rot there's got to be a rottening of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed everything that's going to have quickening power it's got to die before it can have quickening power you've got to die to yourself you got to die to your Ambitions you got to die I've got to die to what I want and what I what I see is as the future for myself and what you see as the future for yourself you got to be willing to die to that and say Lord I want what you want for me so the seed has to go to the Earth it has to die every bit of the seed every bit of the seed has to rot every middle of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he said he was quickened not only that he said and we'll send the same life that quickened me so not just him that was quickened but he said he would send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you to Quicken you that where I am there you will be also aren't you glad you can be with him how about the quickening power how are we going to go to heaven by quickening power by the Holy Ghost that's how we go to heaven in Luke 24 the 24th chapter of the 49th verse he said behold I send the promise to the father upon you but carry your weights you in the city of Jerusalem until you're being dude with power from on high he said to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it so that's for himself now what is he drawing the benefits out of it that seed the seed is the word all right the seed had to die but he draw all the benefits out of the Old Testament word right that was written about him he drew out all the benefits for the Joe all of it didn't leave any of it oh that's the way I want to be I want to be able to stand there like he did with Alan saying in the volume of the book it's written to me I'm going to draw all the benefits I'm gonna draw out healing I'm gonna draw salvation I'm gonna draw I'm gonna draw Joy I'm gonna draw peace I'm going to draw every bit of it out of that seed so he drew all of the promises he drew all the benefits but he didn't just stop there but he shared those benefits amen see we don't we don't have to die physically to draw those benefits because we couldn't atone for our own flesh our own salvation with the death of our own flesh so there had to come we die spiritually but we were crucified with him but he died physically so that you and I could benefit in this life right we can benefit in this life we don't have to die we couldn't pay for our own sins if we died then we couldn't repent we'd have no chance because we were Sinners he was not a sinner but he come to life he was the first round gets into it later in this sermon the first wave sheath that was waved across the people to show us what a resurrected son was the Bible puts it this way it was the firstborn among many brethren right so he come out to show us what was possible and he shared those benefits he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the foundation of the world put their names in The Book of Life and here they are on the Earth without a hope you say that he said he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed he said now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also germatized two requirements for the seed to live it had to be on the earth and it had to be germanized what that means is it had to it had to be with the male if you put it like that if you have a rooster and a hens the hens have to be with the rooster or the eggs won't ever come to life they're still good eating but they won't come to life I'll never be chickens right and so if there was no German germanization if you could say it that way if there was nothing there from from the father there was no quickening power the seed would just stay there on the earth who am I he said no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the son shines upon it he said notice now he come to share it with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news how many know that tonight the good news what if a man died for our sake that's good news if Christ was born that's good news but never was there news like this news that he who made the promise confirmed the promise he didn't offer us an empty promise or something it wasn't like a Salesman that would come along and say this is the way your new car is going to drive this is the way it's going to be he didn't do that what did he do he became the promise right he manifested the promise I've always wondered about Ford dealers that didn't drive Forts and Chevrolet dealers that didn't drive Chevrolets and Toyota dealers that didn't drive Toyotas but Jesus didn't tell us to do something that he didn't do right but he actually did it yeah and he did it on our behalf and he's alive forever more now that's the good news he said he's alive forever more you made the promises confirmed the promise He's Alive forevermore and have the keys of both death and hell in his hand all the Gloom was shook away there was no more Gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave you've been out on a foggy morning and especially gets foggy down here by this River and Hardy if you drive through there at a certain time in the morning at a certain time of the year the fog can be so thick that you can't hardly see but just as the sun comes up the fog begins to clear out and there's no way for the fog to remain past the midday Sun once the sun is fully risen the fog's gone where did it go it went back to where it came from the Gloom cannot stay or you hear me tonight the night time cannot stay the darkness cannot stay sin could not stay sickness could not stay disease could not stay depression could not stay right you realize why we need a resurrected Christ in our services a resurrected Christ in our preaching a resurrected Christ in our living why because when we when we come across darkness when we come across sickness when we come across he's already conquered those things so he's fighting for us he's already given us the keys to overcome those things and it shakes every bit of the Gloom away hey man hey man now he said there was no more Gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave there was no well he will come or he may come now watch this this is where it's important some people say well doctrine's not important yeah it is because if your Doctrine says he will come or he may come that he had already come the gospel good news go and read what Paul has to say about those who denied the resurrection he calls them out names them and comes down really hard on him he said their words will eat like a canker that's gangrene and it'll eat up your flesh their words will eat like a canker he said because they believe the resurrection has already passed so there's no that's the physical resurrection of this body there's nothing to look forward to so Doctrine does matter we believe that the Gloom has been shaken away and so now we we believe we are risen with him but there's a Resurrection coming right now he said the sun was up there was no well he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel good news he said notice the very message of the Gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen so now watch he says go into the upper room going and Terry in Jerusalem until until you receive power you're endued with power from on high so that was their mission was to go and do that and then their mission was to spread the gospel over the the ends of the Earth and by doing that brother Branham always taught us the gospel was not to just go and preach the word but it was to demonstrate the power and manifestation of the Gospel right and and we'll show that in just a moment now he said the very messages of the Gospel itself is to prove to the people that he's risen and that's why we can't preach one thing and live another because if we preach one thing God help me because if we preach one thing and live another if we preach happiness and live and Gloom right if we preach healing and live in a state of of unbelief if we preach and yet those things will come at us just like everybody else but we can't preach one thing and live another because if we do what we're doing is we're actually denying the very gospel itself because it wasn't meant just to be preached it was meant to be left right it was meant to be preached yes but also to be lived by the preacher that's why a preacher has to be living all right because we can send tapes and books and it's wonderful and we're trying doing our best to get them in every land in every nation and every every tongue we should do that but when they see a living a living manifestation of this message that's what the gospel preached is right right it's a living manifestation and so I have told you before I think but many times it's us going and just the effort of going and caring and and loving and showing that we care about them means as much to them as the words we say and I would say that that's true even in a church and I don't want to get myself in trouble here because maybe I don't always do but I will say it's if I don't it's because of ignorance not a lack of Desire but maybe not always do as much as I could but you show people that you love them you show people that you love them you show your family that you love them it's one thing to tell them about a prophet one thing to tell them about a message it's another thing to live that in front of them amen he said go tell my disciples I'm risen from the dead and I'll meet with them to confirm this to them he said oh God how in this last day now watch you he updates it he said there shall be light again across the Earth and I'll prove to my disciples Glory go tell them that I'm Not Dead I'm not a tradition but I'm a living Christ oh when we bring when we make this message of tradition we are we are doing a disservice to the living Christ I'm not dead I'm not a tradition I'm a living Christ that's why God always has to have a bride he always has to there always has to be a new generation and every generation has to have its own Revival you say well brother Ben we can't have Revival come Sunday morning we'll look at that maybe a little bit uh if we get to it in the sermon because the Lord's been stirring me about that well there's no Revival anywhere no there's not out there but there is right here hey man there may not be any Revival out there in the Gloom but we're in here the sun is risen are you with me now every one of us has that that in our hearts that resurrected Christ I'm not a tradition I am a living Christ I'll meet them who am I I'll meet them take this message to my disciples that I am risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we as beneficiaries are to prove his life is is in us now the beneficiaries of this life how would we prove and we'll get more into this maybe next Wednesday night but how could we prove that we are his beneficiaries well we have what he had right and we're beneficiaries of what his spirit that dwells in us so we have what he had what does that mean when he was reviled he reviled not again we do the same thing when he was persecuted he threatened not we do the same thing we act like he acted when he was confronted with death he believed God we was confronted even with his own death you realize he did not use his power to convince others and convince himself but he used the word brother the Bible said he went down believing the word of a backslidden prophet a vaccine King named David because he said I will not suffer you your soul to see corruption your bodies see corruption what did he do he went down he said I would not leave your soul in Hell we'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption and he went down believing the word of a backslid king because it was the word of God it wasn't about the man it was God that spoke it he went down believing and he come up Resurrected oh my We Believe like he believed we live like he lived brother man who said if I had the life of Beethoven I'd write music by the life of John Dillinger I'd go Robin I'd go Robin places if I had the life of brother Harold I could be an engineer and work on cars and work on things but I don't I have the life of John Pruitt running through my veins of my father and he was pretty much useless at everything and I am too but boy could he talk but but that's because that life is in me in the natural or you hear me today but there's a life in you that's more than your natural life your life is a spiritual life whatever he did you you can do that's a strong statement isn't it but the Bible says if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen we need to we need to accept that possibility tonight we need to just reach out and grab hold that possibility well brother Ben there's only you know 50 or 60 of us sometimes and it was just a little group and on a Wednesday night just a little group of adults and the kids half of us are asleep and well there's not very many Jesus had 12 and they were all asleep kept going praying and having to go back and wake them up to be like Jesus as part of that you put them to sleep you get to wake them up but he went back and woke him up and went back again they fell asleep again that don't mean it's not God sometimes you got to go through some things sometimes you gotta I heard a that message and I don't I want this church to grow on every every seat to be filled but Charles Spurgeon said this he said just because the church is Big doesn't mean it's right he said it could be swollen things get bigger after they die what are we holding on to it's not the numbers what is it it's Christ a living Christ a resurrected Christ and where the carcass is they're the Eagles will be gathered so we preach the word but the job of the island when we preach the word the the people come that want the word and the rest of them will never show up now look we are to prove oh that sounds harsh and I'm not I'm not Downy for being gone sometimes that's part of it but it's just we want the word something about the eagle wants the fresh kill of the word we won't live without it we won't make it without it amen or was I at he said we are his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life he said there never was a life lived like it Oh my he was the son of God he died that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is living and now listen okay and this is this is important he said how can we do it by word only how can we do it by word only now I know we've been conditioned to that or it's the word the word the word yes we need to have the word you must have the word without the word you don't have anything but how can we do it by word only for it is written the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive he said now if there is another gospel as Paul spoke to one of the groups I'm so surprised that you turned to another gospel now what gospel is that no no power word only try what he's saying if there's another gospel it's Paul spoke to one of the groups I'm so surprised you turn to another gospel which there is no other but a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news here's where Paul says that Galatians 1 6 I Marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there'll be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ Oh my he said and because I live you live also and I live in you in the works that I do John 14 12 The Works that I do will identify myself in you what a message he said no wonder we've had a dark world of theology and I've had people tell me Well we don't want to go back to Pentecost and I agree with that I don't want denominationalism I don't want the Dark World of theology Pentecost was wrong in their Doctrine they were wrong in their Doctrine it wasn't that they were just over enthused they were wrong because they they said speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost they wouldn't accept the light of the new birth they wouldn't accept the light of all these Mysteries that were revealed they rejected their messenger right they turned it down I don't want to go back to that but I don't want to go back to Luther either I don't want to go back to Westie either I want that plus hey man we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come alive again there will be a resurrection in the evening time he said it shall be light at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent he has risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive watch here he is again he said we cannot do it by word only yeah we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to so if you took a mirror or we don't really have mirrors much anymore we have selfie cameras have the selfie mode on them and you can turn them around look at yourself it only looks at it only reflects what it's looking at right the only way you could get an accurate reflection is by pointing it straight at the object what he's saying we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to now here's a quote I know you've heard I know you've heard it many times but now think about it in and this is why I do this the way that I do it now you've heard what he's been saying and we're going to go to this quote and then I'm going to get out of it is the rising of the Sun for just a few moments and talk to you about these things and then we'll we'll close but it's it's a quote that I'm sure you're very familiar with he said I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life aren't you glad he has life he that hath the son has life Christ now I've heard that preach many different ways mostly I've heard it preach that we needed to preach less about brother Branham and more about Jesus Christ but I don't think that's where brother random is going here because the Baptists Don't Preach about brother Branham they preached Christ crucified or they say they do right the methodists Don't Preach about brother Branham the Pentecostals Don't Preach about brother Branham they do everything they can to to not remember it but but even though the ones that live during that time had to confess that he was a prophet but they're not pointing people to brother random and but now you could take it that way and that would be fine we do the message the prophecy changed the light change shifted focused from the from the prophet to the prophecy well the Branham says that in uh in uh in his sermon when you begin to preach about John coming down there to the river he actually says what is the attraction on the mountain he says that the the change from the prophet to the prophecy so we could say that that's true but we must get them to Christ and not to denominational systems now but how do we do that do we do it just by talking more about Christ now think about it because again the Baptists have done good doing that they talk about Christ and that's good but many others that we could find the reformed they love to talk about Christ the the methodists love to talk about Christ they they talk about him constantly but they don't have the mirror replaced just exactly right right the mirror is not pointing to the real Christ now well if we want to know how to get them to Christ how can we do it well somebody has right Peter did on the day of Pentecost now remember when he talked about it as the rising of the sun we talked about quickening power he said he read that scripture that we read tonight he said go on tarry in Jerusalem until you're being dude with power from on high yeah so now he tells them to do that and then Peter gets up up on the day of Pentecost and gets them to Christ how does he do it well they were gathered there on the day of Pentecost and I won't read it because we've read it many times and you can go back and read to Acts chapter 2 but they were in one Accord in one place and tongues of fire fell on each one of them that were there and brother Reynolds says wow they were influenced by the Holy Ghost they went into action staggering like drunk man screaming speaking in tongues out into the street they went so the people thought that they were drunk and Peter stood up and he began to preach and you can go read the rest of the sermon but Acts 2 15 he said these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it as but the third hour of the day he said it is still mourning that they haven't gotten out and gotten drunk he said but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel this is God manifesting his word now Peter could have come and preached this same sermon without the manifestation of the spirit and it wouldn't amend anything to those people think about it it would have just been another sermon if Peter had said well all we need is word only and he walks out on the day of Pentecost he opens up his Bible and he comes up there and he just begins to teach them about Jesus they'd have stoned him off of there they'd run him up and put him on a cross and then one day they did but the reason why three thousand Souls were saved is because he got them to Christ yeah he got them to Christ now just hang with me for a minute it's God manifesting his word he says this is that so he goes on to indict them for crucifying their Messiah and he says in verse 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now watch he's getting them to Christ but not just with words think about him now Christ what is Christ is the anointed one it means the anointed person the anointed person the anointed one the divinely anointed brother random calls it the anointed word because he was the word and so if he was the anointed one and that one was the word it's the anointed word now it means the Messiah Christos Christ in the New Testament is Messiah of the Old Testament that was the Greek name for the Messiah so anywhere you see Christ you could say Messiah so he was the Messiah that was to come that they looked for the anointed of God and that's what Messiah means anointed one the anointed one that was to come they did not believe that there was coming a theory but they believed there was coming a person right they did not believe that there was coming another book of the law but they believed there was coming a person but they didn't they missed him when he came but now and I know this is a little bit of depth tonight but you just have to hang with me and go and study it out and you'll you'll see it I believe and then if I'm wrong you just come tell me about it later but now but I don't believe I believe this is what he's saying now our Lord Jesus Christ is is the logos the word the logos also over the ram calls it the anointing because you can't separate the two and make it Christ yeah right our Lord Jesus Christ what did he say he was the Trinity of God all in one hey man the quickening power the word became flesh now brother Joel was preaching about and it struck me when brother Joel was preaching about how that the wise men came and they saw a baby in a Manger they saw they come and they followed they didn't just sit there but they followed the star and went through the great Pains of two years of a journey over from India or Babylon where they were and coming across into all through that those swamps and everything else to come to the place where Jesus lay it was a two-year journey and they get there and and when they get there they don't go and look in in the manger and see a book and think about it they didn't go and see a Bible like this one they could have went and found that they probably had some where they were yeah The Babylon was actually the seed of Jewish learning they probably knew all about the book that's why they were looking for a Star to announce the Messiah but the Branham in fact said that Daniel taught them about that and so they they were following their their forefather Daniel had taught them how to do that and and so they were looking for that to come but when they come and saw him they didn't see a book they didn't see a manuscript they didn't see it and go a little bit farther they didn't see a video they didn't see a a tape they saw a person right right he wouldn't have been the Christ if he was a book you hear me he wouldn't be the Christ if he was a a tape he wouldn't be the Christ if he was uh something else some tangible object he was a person yeah oh God brother says God does nothing without the agency of man understand he he was the Christ God didn't send the book oh God I hope we realize this tonight he become flesh and so on that day on Pentecost when when he presented Christ to them what did they do they said what shall we do what should we do and Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what was he doing getting them to Christ that's right now watch how do we get people to Christ the same way that Peter did yeah we preach the word and point them to the Holy Ghost now think about it he got them to Christ but we know we can't take them to a living if there was a more a body a physical body here today that had had wounds in his hands and wounds he's still with me tonight I I just want to get this part out and then we'll quit but if he was a physical body and had blood running out of his wounds it wouldn't be Christ we're taught that it wouldn't be the son of man the day when the son of man was revealed he wasn't revealed that way he was revealed in another body oh God I feel like sometimes I I get into this stuff and it just for me but y'all just just hang with me tonight I we need to see Christ as in US he got them to Christ now one day that Corporal body will be there we don't want to take it too far we've seen that before but because there is a Corporal Body of Christ and brothers the Believers believe that they'll see him in that form again right but now in this form where is he at today if we're going to get people to Christ where are we going to take them to are we going to take them to a book or a tape or a denomination where do we take them to we take them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the quickening power right because when they receive the Holy Ghost they receive Christ the anointing oh God and they become anointed once now watch we've almost made anointed ones a Bad Thing anointed ones is not a bad thing anointed ones is a good thing we want to be anointed once I don't mean you jump and run and shouting well I'd have a heart attack and some of you did but that doesn't mean that I'm still looking for Levi to make that that cat holler to make that nod actually but I promised I'd run all over the church so but but you know some that don't mean necessarily that you do that anointed means you're empowered for service you got power in your life hey man when sickness comes around on Monday you got power in your life it doesn't mean you'll never suffer sickness it means there's power in your life to overcome there's power in your life to overcome pornography there's power in your life to overcome the things of the world there's power in your life to overcome lust power in your life to overcome sickness power in your life to overcome dressing like the world acting like the world living like the world are you with me now power in your life you're an anointed one oh my amen why you have the gift of the Holy Ghost now watch he got them to Christ now Paul deals with spiritual gifts in First Corinthians 12. if you go and read that chapter he's dealing with the Corinthians with spiritual gifts because they had them but they didn't understand them so they had a problem with using the spiritual gifts and so Paul comes down there and he tells them he said I know you were Gentiles LED away with dumb idols he said so you're not going to understand these things but oh my but but see the the Jews would understand but the Corinthians they they were willing to let them move but they didn't understand how to put it in order so he says this and they couldn't distinguish between good gifts good anointed ones and bad gifts bad anointed ones or as we would call false anointed ones right or we could say it this way anointed false ones right because they're they're ones who are false at the bottom but they are anointed with a true anointing with the spirit of God so watch what Paul says he said wherefore I give you to understand because they couldn't tell the difference here would be one brother random talked about the one man that spoke in tongues was living with somebody else's wife here come another man that interpreted those tongues and this man was as righteous as he could be right and he was right and this one both Anointed with the same spirit and brother Madam deals with that and tells us about the wheat and the tares but they're both anointed it's not a different anointing but it's the same anointing anointed ones are you with me now anointed ones but they do not but see Christ is if we're going to get the people of Christ we got to get to people to the anointed word so Christ was a particular person and why you knew that he was the Christ was that he fulfilled the prophecy written about him right that's how you knew who he was because others might have come and had Miracles and done signs and wonders but this one came and was the word and said this day the scripture is fulfilled right there's been many who claim to have the Elijah but in this hour God proved to us who Elijah was why because he did what Elijah was supposed to do at the end time are you with me now he's going to prove the bride the same way how would he do it any different by becoming what a bride is supposed to be that's why we fight to have church that's why we fight to be have be a body to love one another because these things have to be in US we've got to be a body of Christ we got to be a bride on the earth that is exactly what he said it would be right amen so he says I give you to understand no man speaking by the spirit of God Called Jesus accursed so now watch he said they're not going to go against the word no man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost right if they say with the word that's the Holy Ghost if they go against the word then that man is not is is is speaking heresy and again we understand it's real anointing but they couldn't tell the difference because one would say some wild Doctrine there were some wild doctrines back in those early ages and one would say some wild Doctrine but the other one would speak the truth both of them with the same amount of emotion both of them under the same anointing now again and there are false anointed ones and then there are just fakes right and we get a lot of that in Pentecost today scarecrows just fakes but there's a real anointing now does the gift point to Christ the word how do you tell a Ministry now it ought to be an anointed one a minister is an anointed one but if he's an anointed one what what is he pointing to is he pointing to himself is he pointing to a Doctrine is he pointing to some some thing that'll make him rich or something like that or is he pointing to Christ is he pointing to the word made flesh now watch if it points to Christ the word it's of God but Paul tells tells us and tells the early church he did not get them to Christ by word only Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power in the holy God are you still okay tonight we're almost done well some of you are in much Assurance thank you brother David I'm just going to preach to you for a while he said in much assurance that you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake who and again in second Corinthians 3 6 he said who also hath made us Abel Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life see the letter is not Christ the manifestation of the letter is Christ again they didn't go look for a book they went and saw a person and so let's bring it on down now we cannot get people back to the word without power being in the church we CA it's Inseparable you can't get people back to Christ the logos without there being a Christ there who does Miracles and signs and wonders and has uh joy in life there's no way you can do that are you hearing me now there's God it's it's got to go together we get the people to Christ the Messiah Now watch how do we do that by becoming anointed once that's what Peter did that's what made his message so powerful how did he get the people to Christ what's brother better saying he's telling us that we become the anointed ones we become the quickened ones we become alive and how did Peter get the people to Christ he said I'm afraid we're not getting them to Christ why because we're not becoming the word are you with me now we're not becoming the word we're not becoming well brother random calls Messiah ants or little Messiahs you can only reflect what you're pointing to now watch a messiah now what is that it's a Christ by measure we won't go all into that tonight as we hurry along to close but it's the same quality in a different quantity same quality that is in you is in Christ but a different quantity he was the fullness of the godhead then when God brother Brandon said was made flesh and become the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves there's the key yes huh Wednesday night and we're tired but if we can yield ourselves on Monday when you get up in the morning if you can yield yourself on Thursday whatever day that it is for the week when you get to school when you get to work can you yield yourself to becoming the Messiah the anointed one because your church needs the anointed one your your school needs the anointed one they don't need just the book they don't need just a tape yes that told who he was but they needed an anointed one Christ now watch he said then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become Messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be amen lights little anointed ones that's God's Church you want to be God's Church there's lots of churches call themselves The Church of Christ or the Church of God but there's no anointed one there right and again it won't be a false anointed one now the Bible does tell us there'll be false Christ false Messiahs Matthew 24 24 there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and they'll show great signs and wonders and so much if it were possible they'll receive the very elect mother Brown said the anointed of the same water that watered the wheat also Waters the tears anointed once he said only the elected or predestinator will be able to detect the difference between them what is that you've got the word in you amen and you don't have to worry about that you don't have to well if we see any emotion we might be deceived how can you be deceived if we hear a preacher we might be deceived how can you be deceived you are the word the word is in you and it's not it's a mustard seed word it's a it's an undivided word it's an un it's a word that has never been mixed with anything else you are the word and so you you you're not going to be deceived the right seed is the word and that plus the anointing or the rain manifests the weed listen the false anointed ones are not false because they're anointed they're false because they will not stay with the word and because of that their fruits are wrong right and when it grows up he said let them grow up together but then in this age we see them putting on fruits and they come up and preach the same message preached the same way had the same anointing but when they come up the fruits were wrong they begin it's manifesting time how many believe that tonight we want our fruits to be right brother random called their fruit their Doctrine the fruit of a Preacher is his Doctrine right that's his that's his fruit it's what he produces we want to we want to produce the right thing don't win he said now we become Anointed with that same Spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs of the last day they shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with the love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestations so there's nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe it is a substance and that creates a perfect faith the false anointed ones could not become true anointed ones they were false at the bottom right false from the beginning and they were anointed on the outer realm and we've been through that they were not anointed from the soul but you got something inside of you if you're a seed of God here tonight and I trust that we all are we don't I don't know but you know you can know and you can have confidence in that and so you if you're a seed of God what happens there's something inside of you that is the word and when the word falls on it it can't do nothing but manifest the weed oh my and this message is that love affair of God he's pouring himself into US pouring himself in what does that produce manifestation what does it manifest the same life that Christ had how did Peter get them to Christ he got them to the Holy Ghost how how do we get people this message we get them to Christ the word the Holy Ghost the token with me I'm not saying there's no place for teaching but we need a god with skin on it somebody that manifests the word manifest the gifts isn't that what you want to do musicians go ahead and come tonight closing manifest the gifts of the Spirit but you don't stop there you manifest the Fruit of the Spirit are you with me now because that's what he did he didn't just go about healing the sick but he also went about with love and compassion and long-suffering saying father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing it didn't he manifest that in his life that's what we're supposed to manifest right and so we manifest the gifts of the Spirit the fruit of the spirit and we live a life worthy of the Gospel we live a life above the things of the world why do we do that because the spirit of Jesus dwells in you and if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll also Quicken this Mortal body make it alive aren't you glad for that life tonight aren't you glad that he comes and just does away with the Gloom just goes away with it lets you become a messiah had an anointed one anointed by the Rising Sun let's bow our heads together there's probably way more there than what I should have attempted on a Wednesday night but I hope that some of it sticks we still live in bodies of Flesh that's the sticky nature on the outside but inside of that there's a germ of life it's not so much about what happens on the outside but eventually what happens on the outside will reflect what's happening on the inside we want to be Messiah it's anointed ones not to look down on or say well though that they have a bunch of emotions so they must be false that's not what it's about but it's about the life it's about the life what is the fruit show have they been laying in the presence of the sun to ripen this is an age that's calling for maturity it Demands a mature bride it was a time when we were an infant bride but this age is demands maturity oh God help us to be that bride today help us to be that mature bride help us to be in Revival help us to be what we ought to be that's your prayer tonight let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father oh God we want to be Lord your bride your your Messiahs in this age little Messiahs oh God we realize we are not sinless Lord we realize we are unworthy but God by your anointing we become by the anointing of the Holy Ghost we become little Messiahs oh God we can't do without that we must have the mechanics and the Dynamics oh God May that Dynamics pour itself out we know the mechanics are right we know Lord that this message is right we know we have the right word but oh God you didn't call the wise men to look into a Manger filled with a book but you called the wife men to look into a Manger that had a baby in it oh God May there be the person of Christ live it live yourself through our lives I pray you'd grant that today Lord Lord may be manifest not just in our services but also in our daily lives in our desire oh God oh God help us never to settle for coldness never to settle the world is so they ought to see us so such an influence in this day and I see it oh God Lord I could feel the pull of it and see it all around us but Lord may we not give in to the darkness but may we let yield ourselves to the Rising Sun Lord that wants to overtake every bit of Darkness that conquered death Hell In The Grave Lord that that fullness of the godhead that was you Lord and we believe that you're living within us now help us to recognize that Lord as we go through the trials of Life know who we are Lord me your word go directly to your people oh God I pray you'd take it Lord not just from my broken words but Lord may you arrange it in the way that it should be every heart and every mind I pray you granted now we thank you for this message and we thank you for the Holy Ghost Lord we want to point the people to Christ to you oh God how can we do
