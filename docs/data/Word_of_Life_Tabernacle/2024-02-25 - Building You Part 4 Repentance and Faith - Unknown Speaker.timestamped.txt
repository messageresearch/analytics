[48:51] 51 it says have mercy upon me oh God
[48:54] according to th thy loving kindness
[48:57] according unto the multitude of thy
[48:59] Tender Mercies blot out my
[49:03] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[49:06] my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[49:10] acknowledge my
[49:11] transgressions and my sin is ever before
[49:15] me pray the Lord would add his Blessing
[49:17] to the word you may be seated this
[49:24] morning
[49:26] my grandfather on my on the prit side
[49:29] was a good man he uh was a farmer he
[49:33] lived for uh most of his life in the
[49:37] same area there around Neda Missouri in
[49:39] Fort Scott Kansas he was a man who was a
[49:42] man of his word kept his word and in
[49:45] fact he told me that he said if you're
[49:48] five minutes late to an appointment he
[49:49] said you lied to me and he was that kind
[49:52] of a guy he a very moral God-fearing man
[49:56] uh he was he was also a difficult man in
[49:58] some ways because he had a difficult
[50:00] time saying I love you as many men of
[50:02] his generation did he fought in the
[50:04] second world war and and had seen some
[50:07] things and I believe God did something
[50:08] in his life he wasn't a a message
[50:11] believer he was a uh a Church of God
[50:13] Holiness man he was faithful to the
[50:15] church he was a Sunday school teacher
[50:18] and a few years before he died uh the
[50:20] Sunday school at the church there in
[50:22] Neda Missouri gave him this Bible I was
[50:25] recently given this Bible and I I uh be
[50:28] to look through it and I saw where he
[50:30] he'd read through it a couple of times
[50:32] there in the last couple years of his
[50:33] life but he had Psalms 51 written it's
[50:37] the only scripture that he wrote on the
[50:39] fly leaf of the Bible is Psalms
[50:42] 51 and the the difference in my
[50:47] grandfather and the situation David was
[50:50] in struck me because David was a middle
[50:53] eastern King with 500
[50:55] wives who uh had been he was a great
[51:00] musician and a a writer and and had a
[51:03] prophetic gift and my grandpa had none
[51:06] of that and he David had committed a a
[51:11] terrible sin and adultery and murder and
[51:15] as far as I know my grandpa had never
[51:16] been involved in anything like that and
[51:20] yet somehow that verse though he'd read
[51:23] through the the Bible and did that I
[51:24] think every year that that spoke to him
[51:28] in a way that maybe no other chapter in
[51:31] in the Bible did I got thinking about
[51:33] that and I I thought what could possibly
[51:35] how could he possibly identify with King
[51:38] David in that but I think every one of
[51:41] us at some point in our lives have
[51:43] prayed have mercy upon me oh
[51:47] god I've actually at times in my life
[51:50] went back to that scripture and I didn't
[51:52] know how to say I'm sorry because i' met
[51:55] messed up in some way and I come back to
[51:57] that scripture and I pray have mercy
[51:59] upon me oh God according to thy loving
[52:03] kindness not because I deserve it but
[52:05] because you're good Lord because you
[52:08] love me according to thy loving
[52:10] according to the multitude of thy Tender
[52:11] Mercies blot out my transgressions have
[52:14] you ever prayed like that and he just
[52:16] put it in such a wonderful way Wash Me
[52:18] thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me
[52:21] from my sin he said for I acknowledge my
[52:24] transgressions
[52:25] and my sin is ever before me and my
[52:28] grandfather had that underlined in his
[52:33] Bible I I know that as we were talking
[52:36] about building you building the
[52:39] individual God is doing something in
[52:41] your life as an individual yes and we
[52:45] know that we were chosen for the purpose
[52:48] of redemption right and well that means
[52:51] Redemption means that he's buying back
[52:54] something that he already owned that was
[52:57] already his so in 2 Thessalonians 2:13
[53:02] Paul tells us we are bound to give
[53:04] thanks always to God for you Brethren
[53:06] beloved of the Lord because God hath
[53:08] from the beginning chosen you to
[53:12] Salvation through sanctification of the
[53:15] spirit and belief of the truth Paul
[53:17] makes this very clear in Ephesians 1
[53:20] Ephesians 1: 15 having predestinated us
[53:23] into the adoption of children by Jesus
[53:26] Christ to himself according to the good
[53:29] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[53:31] the glory of his grace wherein Heath
[53:33] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[53:36] we have Redemption through his blood the
[53:38] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[53:40] riches of his grace and so we know that
[53:43] there's nothing we could do to earn the
[53:45] favor of God but we must accept his
[53:48] favor in the same way that they did at
[53:51] the beginning of the Gentile age through
[53:53] the process of repentance
[53:56] and Faith right and that's what I want
[53:58] to speak to you about this morning
[54:00] repentance and Faith as we continue to
[54:03] dwell on how God deals with us as
[54:05] individuals now in Acts 237 we find a
[54:09] group of people who have just heard what
[54:11] is really the First Gospel message that
[54:13] was ever preached as uh after the Holy
[54:16] Ghost fell Peter gets up and he begins
[54:18] to preach the gospel to him and he says
[54:20] he says this is what you've done you're
[54:23] responsible for the death of Christ and
[54:25] and this is this is how guilty that you
[54:28] are and the people the Bible says when
[54:30] they heard this when they heard the
[54:32] preaching of the word they were pricked
[54:35] in their heart they were pricked in
[54:38] their heart and every one of us has to
[54:40] be pricked in our heart at some time or
[54:42] another in order to be a Christian right
[54:45] amen and said unto Peter and to the rest
[54:47] of the Apostles men and Brethren what
[54:50] shall we do yeah now I want you to
[54:54] understand this morning that you cannot
[54:56] prick your own heart right right they
[55:00] were pricked in their heart but you
[55:02] can't do that to
[55:05] yourself that takes election it takes
[55:08] predestination it takes favor there's
[55:11] something that in your life that has to
[55:13] be there's something that has to be
[55:15] prickle if I can say it that way to coin
[55:17] a term it's got to be something that
[55:20] that is able to be pricked there's got
[55:22] to be something there there's got to be
[55:24] a conscience there
[55:25] so and that what that word means pricked
[55:28] it means to be goated and what they
[55:30] would do is they'd have a uh they'd have
[55:32] an ox go which was an instrument a stick
[55:34] with a very sharp end or very sharp
[55:36] point and it would actually prick the ox
[55:39] and cause actually a draw it would draw
[55:41] blood because it would it would hurt
[55:43] them but just just for a minute because
[55:45] they wanted them to turn a certain
[55:47] direction and so God wanted these people
[55:50] on the day of Pentecost to turn a
[55:52] certain direction and so he Pricks them
[55:54] in their their heart yes sir they are
[55:57] pricked by the preaching of the word
[55:59] Jesus told Paul he said it's hard to
[56:02] kick against the Pricks in other words
[56:05] it's hard when you're being pricked to
[56:07] go a different direction than he wants
[56:08] you to go I I want to thank God this
[56:11] morning for the overwhelming convicting
[56:13] power of the holy spirit that still
[56:16] convicts men of sin that still brings
[56:18] people to the altar that still makes
[56:20] them call out to God and cry out to God
[56:23] yes it's hard to kick against the prick
[56:26] if you're kicking against the Pricks
[56:28] this morning it's time to give in it's
[56:30] time to surrender it's time to just let
[56:32] him do his
[56:34] work acts 238 Peter responds to them
[56:37] this
[56:38] is he says this is what you what you're
[56:42] supposed to do to be saved repent and be
[56:46] baptized every one of you in the name of
[56:47] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[56:50] and you shall receive the gift of the
[56:53] Holy Ghost repent
[56:55] and be baptized repentance and Faith
[56:59] baptism being the outward work
[57:02] expressing an inward Faith
[57:05] repentance and Faith Paul in Acts chap
[57:08] 20: 21 he's looking back over his
[57:11] ministry and saying this is the things
[57:12] that that's been done in my Ministry and
[57:14] the things that the way I treated the
[57:16] people and things and the way I treated
[57:18] the word how faithful I was and so he
[57:21] says this in verse 21 testifying both to
[57:23] the Jews also to the Greeks repentance
[57:26] toward God and Faith toward our Lord
[57:29] Jesus Christ so it takes both of those
[57:32] things repentance and Faith this is the
[57:35] foundation of your walk with the Lord
[57:37] yes right repentance and Faith it always
[57:41] comes back to
[57:42] repentance and Faith so now he's saying
[57:46] we we we now Paul in Hebrews chapter 6
[57:49] and verse one he says therefore leaving
[57:51] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[57:53] let us go on under perfection now he's
[57:55] talking to people who have repented who
[57:57] have believed yeah but he tells us what
[57:59] the foundation of our faith is he said
[58:02] not laying again the foundation of
[58:04] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[58:07] toward God so he's saying there is a
[58:08] point as Christians when we need to come
[58:10] up high there's a point at which we need
[58:12] to we need to begin to establish that
[58:15] adoption in our lives be We Begin need
[58:16] to begin to establish the message as the
[58:19] rule of our life and those things but
[58:21] yet the foundation of all of that is
[58:23] repentance and faith and if you don't
[58:25] have repentance and Faith you cannot
[58:27] build there there's no place to build
[58:29] there's no Foundation to build on so
[58:31] that's the very bottom of the pyramid if
[58:33] we could put it that way is repentance
[58:34] and Faith yeah brother pandom talked
[58:36] about a man who preached on repentance
[58:38] every week and he said he that he preach
[58:41] on Sunday about repentance Sunday night
[58:43] about repentance Wednesday night he
[58:44] preached repent right and finally he he
[58:47] preached repent over and over and over
[58:49] and the Deacon board met with him and
[58:51] says why do you keep preaching
[58:52] repentance said we got that he said uh
[58:55] he said they said we we understand and
[58:57] they said why do you keep preaching on
[58:59] it he said well he said let them repent
[59:01] he said then I'll preach on something
[59:03] else right because you got to have a
[59:05] foundation right there's got to be a
[59:07] foundation of faith and repentance in
[59:10] your life now not everyone can repent
[59:15] because the ability to repent is a gift
[59:18] from God that's right amen acts 11: 18
[59:23] says when they heard these things they
[59:26] held their peace and glorified God
[59:28] saying then hath God also to the
[59:30] Gentiles granted
[59:32] repentance he has granted repentance if
[59:35] you are able to repent this morning that
[59:38] don't make you something more than
[59:39] somebody else it just means god granted
[59:42] repentance to you God granted a
[59:44] repentance Oh my he pricked your
[59:48] heart Hallelujah on not everyone can
[59:51] repent Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with
[59:54] all men and Holiness without which no
[59:56] man shall see the Lord so that's
[59:59] sanctification in your life looking
[1:00:01] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:00:03] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:00:06] springing up trouble you thereby many be
[1:00:09] defiled lest there be any fornicator or
[1:00:11] profane person as Esau who for one
[1:00:14] morsel of meat sold his Birthright for
[1:00:17] you know how that afterward when he
[1:00:18] would have inherited the blessing he was
[1:00:20] rejected for he found no place of repent
[1:00:24] repentance why was he rejected I want
[1:00:27] you to I want you to watch carefully was
[1:00:29] not rejected for not being seed we know
[1:00:32] that he was not seed right but he was
[1:00:35] not rejected for not being seed because
[1:00:38] he said whosoever will may come right he
[1:00:41] was rejected because he found no place
[1:00:43] of
[1:00:44] repentance though he sought
[1:00:46] repentance
[1:00:48] carefully he he he studied it yeah he
[1:00:51] tried to repent yes even did it with
[1:00:54] tears
[1:00:55] but he didn't find a place of repentance
[1:00:58] oh church if we'd realize what a gift it
[1:01:00] is to be able to find a place where you
[1:01:02] know your sins are forgiven when you
[1:01:03] know it's all under the blood when you
[1:01:05] realize the world as a whole can't can't
[1:01:07] be like that they can never experience
[1:01:09] that they don't know what it's like to
[1:01:11] lay their head on their pillow and know
[1:01:12] that everything is under the blood and
[1:01:14] you are The sinless Virtuous bride of
[1:01:16] Jesus Christ The World At Large doesn't
[1:01:18] know that but you know that brother the
[1:01:20] Justin how do you know it because
[1:01:22] there's something about you the word
[1:01:24] spoke back to the word in your DNA there
[1:01:26] was written repentance
[1:01:30] yes something in that seed that was
[1:01:32] inside of you caused you drove you
[1:01:35] caused you to seek a place of repentance
[1:01:37] and you found
[1:01:39] it good
[1:01:41] amen now
[1:01:45] look in that word repentance is
[1:01:49] literally a change of
[1:01:51] mind a change of mind it primarily
[1:01:54] refers refers to a comprehensive change
[1:01:56] of one's
[1:01:57] orientation toward following
[1:02:01] God it's a noun equivalent of the verb
[1:02:04] which means to change one's mind like
[1:02:06] the verb it originally referred to a
[1:02:07] change of mind but in the time of the
[1:02:08] New Testament taking on a meaning in
[1:02:10] Jewish thought of a return to God yeah
[1:02:13] so it's a change of Direction repentance
[1:02:16] is a change of Direction now we know
[1:02:20] that in the natural birth we have water
[1:02:23] blood and spirit brother Bren talks
[1:02:25] about that in future home he talks about
[1:02:27] how that the seed uh the seed uh the
[1:02:31] seed birth how the the seed has to rot
[1:02:34] in the natural that there has to be a
[1:02:36] stalk a tossel and a Shu he said that's
[1:02:39] the three stages that bring you to the
[1:02:41] grain right how how many understand that
[1:02:44] that teaching we we may go back over it
[1:02:46] so the children understand things but
[1:02:48] you all this morning just as we're kind
[1:02:50] of dwelling on just one part of this but
[1:02:53] the seed has got to rot first yeah and
[1:02:56] that happens during the first stage
[1:02:58] that's part repentance and Faith when
[1:03:00] you believe at that time you also the
[1:03:03] seed has to rot in other words the shell
[1:03:06] around it the I should say you got to
[1:03:09] Die the say you got to die to yourself
[1:03:12] you got to die to your old ideas you got
[1:03:14] to die to what you want you got to die
[1:03:16] to everything but the word come on and
[1:03:18] then the word of the Caleb Works inside
[1:03:20] of you to produce something in your life
[1:03:23] so you got to die everything but the
[1:03:25] word now brother Bram said God
[1:03:27] vindicates that he's talking about that
[1:03:29] process he said God vindicates that
[1:03:31] that's always been right he said God
[1:03:33] vindicates it to be true it shows
[1:03:35] plainly he said the predestinated is the
[1:03:37] only one that's considered in Redemption
[1:03:39] now how does it show that because only
[1:03:41] what has been a seed of corn will become
[1:03:44] a grain of
[1:03:45] corn right only what has be been a germ
[1:03:48] of wheat will become a grain of
[1:03:51] wheat right it's com oh my oh tell you
[1:03:54] what you are and who you are this
[1:03:56] morning so the predestin he said did you
[1:03:59] get it he said let me say it again the
[1:04:00] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:04:02] considered in Redemption he said people
[1:04:05] might be making like think they are but
[1:04:07] the real Redemption is those that are
[1:04:09] predestined because the very word redeem
[1:04:11] means to bring back yes sir to bring
[1:04:14] back to redeem anything is to bring it
[1:04:15] back to its original place he said
[1:04:17] Hallelujah so it's only the
[1:04:19] predestinated would be brought back
[1:04:21] because the others didn't come from
[1:04:22] there you said but I fail but you were
[1:04:24] brought
[1:04:25] back why are you back why did you come
[1:04:28] back to God why are you trying to serve
[1:04:30] God today but Daniel there's something
[1:04:32] there there's a seed of life there in
[1:04:34] the beginning it was with God it's going
[1:04:36] back to God and no matter what the shell
[1:04:39] wants to do how how much you you may
[1:04:42] fight that but something Pricks your
[1:04:43] heart and drives you to
[1:04:46] repentance right see he said he said the
[1:04:50] others didn't come from there he said
[1:04:52] being eternal with him at the beginning
[1:04:55] the eternal life that you had his
[1:04:56] thought of what you was he said he
[1:04:59] wanted you he said he wanted me to stand
[1:05:01] in the Pulpit say he wanted you to sit
[1:05:02] in the seat tonight he said then we are
[1:05:04] serving his eternal purpose and the one
[1:05:07] that left home only come to the Earth to
[1:05:09] serve his purpose he said and then after
[1:05:12] it's finished it's brought back in a
[1:05:13] glorified State it's matured and brought
[1:05:16] back again no wonder Paul could say when
[1:05:19] they was building a block to chop his
[1:05:20] head off he said oh death where is your
[1:05:22] sting oh great where is your Victory but
[1:05:25] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:05:27] victory he said death tell me where you
[1:05:30] can make me holler oh I love the way he
[1:05:33] puts it here grave tell me where you're
[1:05:34] going to hold me for I am a possessor
[1:05:37] how many can say I am a possessor I am a
[1:05:39] possessor of eternal life that's enough
[1:05:41] to make a Baptist shout I I am a
[1:05:44] possessor of eternal life he recognized
[1:05:46] it death hell grave nothing could hold
[1:05:49] him and nothing can hurt us we got
[1:05:51] eternal life he realized he was blessed
[1:05:54] with eternal
[1:05:56] life and when he types that to a do
[1:05:59] drop I love how simple the prophet was
[1:06:02] in his explanation he said the DW drop
[1:06:05] oh my yes sir you you've seen it in the
[1:06:07] morning when you go out and everything
[1:06:09] kind of shimmering because the de has
[1:06:12] fallen during the night and brother when
[1:06:14] the night gets cold and dark it falls
[1:06:17] from the heavens and drops upon the
[1:06:19] ground it fell from somewhere yeah but
[1:06:22] the next morning before the sun comes up
[1:06:25] it's laying there the little fellow
[1:06:27] shivering but just let the sun come up
[1:06:30] watch it go to shiny yes he said it's
[1:06:34] happy why the Sun is going to call it
[1:06:36] right back to where it came from yes and
[1:06:39] that's the way with a Christian he said
[1:06:41] Hallelujah we know when we walk into the
[1:06:44] presence of God something in US tells us
[1:06:46] that we come from somewhere and we're
[1:06:48] going back by that power that's ping us
[1:06:51] how many believe that this morning do
[1:06:52] you really believe it you came came from
[1:06:54] somewhere your beginning was not in
[1:06:56] Hardy Arkansas your beginning was not
[1:06:58] with your mistakes your beginning was
[1:07:00] not in your natural DNA but somewhere on
[1:07:02] the inside is something Eternal you come
[1:07:05] from God you're going back to
[1:07:08] God glory to
[1:07:11] God
[1:07:12] amen amen the Sun is going to call
[1:07:16] that's why you can't keep doing what you
[1:07:18] always did that's why something's
[1:07:19] calling you you may not even believe
[1:07:22] understand at all but your life begins
[1:07:24] to change and things begin to happen
[1:07:26] while you're being called right back
[1:07:27] where you came from righten and I'll
[1:07:29] encourage you today if there's a seed of
[1:07:32] God and that process begins it might be
[1:07:34] stunned at times it might go through
[1:07:35] some dark days but the sun is behind the
[1:07:38] clouds and it will shine again and that
[1:07:40] one that seed that's there has got to
[1:07:43] come back to what it
[1:07:45] was it will not be stopped
[1:07:51] right the parents said that's the way
[1:07:53] with the Christian and we know when we
[1:07:54] walk to the presence of God something in
[1:07:56] US tells us that we come from somewhere
[1:07:58] We're Going Back Again by that power
[1:08:00] that's pulling us Little D drop he
[1:08:02] glistens and shines and shouts Oh Glory
[1:08:05] to God because he knows he come from up
[1:08:08] there and that son is going to draw him
[1:08:11] right back up again and a man that's an
[1:08:13] attribute of God born of God knows
[1:08:15] Hallelujah when he come in contact with
[1:08:17] a son of God he is going to be draw up
[1:08:20] from here all right
[1:08:22] someday amen all right and we know that
[1:08:27] repentance is the first work of a new
[1:08:31] believer the first work it's the
[1:08:33] beginning of a new
[1:08:36] creature of redemption to The Sinner and
[1:08:40] restoration to the
[1:08:42] backslider repentance is where it
[1:08:46] starts look at the Ephesian Church age
[1:08:48] Revelation 2:4 he said nevertheless I
[1:08:51] have someone against thee because
[1:08:53] because he said thou has left thy first
[1:08:55] love your backslid yeah right that first
[1:08:58] age he's speaking to the age that acts 2
[1:09:01] happened in right right they've been
[1:09:04] filled and refilled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:06] but somehow over time they lost their
[1:09:08] first
[1:09:09] love he said remember therefore from
[1:09:12] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[1:09:17] the first works or else I will come un
[1:09:20] thee quickly and will REM remove thy
[1:09:22] Candlestick out of his place except thou
[1:09:25] repent I want us to understand today
[1:09:28] that repentance is not just for Sinners
[1:09:31] that's
[1:09:32] right repentance is for Christians right
[1:09:36] listen brother BR said God tells them to
[1:09:38] remember evidently something had left
[1:09:41] their minds they had forgotten something
[1:09:43] when you begin to see somebody live in a
[1:09:44] way that's not like a Christian but you
[1:09:47] know that they've been a Christian they
[1:09:49] they they they they believe the message
[1:09:50] of the hour they've been baptized they
[1:09:53] they've been filled with the the Holy
[1:09:54] Spirit but now they begin to live a
[1:09:55] certain way things begin to drift in
[1:09:57] their life and things begin to come in
[1:09:59] and they begin to do things that they
[1:10:00] would have never done you think why
[1:10:01] would that person be that way but you
[1:10:03] begin to realize they've fallen from
[1:10:05] something and there's something that
[1:10:07] they need to remember you need to
[1:10:09] remember where you came from you need to
[1:10:11] remember what it was like when you got
[1:10:12] saved you need to remember oh my you
[1:10:15] need to know what it was like to be a
[1:10:17] Christian again to to feel the joy of
[1:10:19] God in your life again and life gets so
[1:10:21] busy and you get so worried about
[1:10:23] everything else you forget what how much
[1:10:25] joy you had in the presence of the Lord
[1:10:27] you forget what it was like to sit in
[1:10:28] church and know that your sins were
[1:10:30] forgiven and everything was under the
[1:10:32] blood and the joy that that brought
[1:10:33] nobody can stop you but now you're
[1:10:35] worried about what everybody else thinks
[1:10:37] and what everybody else is doing wh what
[1:10:39] is it you need to remember and you need
[1:10:41] to go
[1:10:42] back what do you need to do repent right
[1:10:47] come
[1:10:48] back
[1:10:50] Hallelujah he said he told them to turn
[1:10:52] back in their mind signs to their point
[1:10:55] of origin the origin of the first age
[1:10:58] was
[1:10:58] Pentecost they had fallen from it now
[1:11:02] look don't don't you realize why Satan
[1:11:03] hates this message and he hates the
[1:11:06] preaching of it yeah and he hates the he
[1:11:08] hates it when you get into it he hates
[1:11:10] it when you listen to it he hates it
[1:11:11] when you read it he hates when it's
[1:11:12] preached right come on why does he hate
[1:11:15] it because it takes you back to your
[1:11:17] point of origin and if you could ever
[1:11:19] get back to your point of origin there's
[1:11:21] nothing that you couldn't overcome
[1:11:23] everything in your life is just a maybe
[1:11:25] a little bump but you can overcome it
[1:11:27] you can make it why because your point
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:31] origin I don't want you to get too
[1:11:33] discouraged cuz somebody you said well
[1:11:34] that person was doing good for a while
[1:11:36] now they're not don't get too
[1:11:37] discouraged the fact the devil's after
[1:11:39] them is proof that God already got a
[1:11:41] hold of them the devil don't fight those
[1:11:44] that are his he's fighting those that
[1:11:45] are
[1:11:46] God's so we ought to be able to Rejoice
[1:11:48] knowing God's going to get them all
[1:11:52] right now look look he said they'd
[1:11:55] fallen from it they' forgotten the glory
[1:11:58] and wonder of
[1:12:00] it oh they knew they were saved that's
[1:12:03] good they knew that they were they they
[1:12:05] were Christians but they forgot the
[1:12:07] glory of it they forgot the Wonder of it
[1:12:10] yeah he said it was time to go back oh
[1:12:13] church this morning it's time for us as
[1:12:15] Christians to go back in a place in our
[1:12:18] minds and in reality where we know the
[1:12:20] Wonder of it again all right come on
[1:12:22] where we know the uh take me back lord
[1:12:25] and I prayed this week Lord I Want To
[1:12:27] Know Your Wonder yes I Want To Know Your
[1:12:30] Glory yes was time to go back in mind
[1:12:32] and then in reality back to when they
[1:12:34] could say for me to live as Christ back
[1:12:37] to Purity when ananas and Safar were
[1:12:40] dealt with back to the gate beautiful
[1:12:43] yes what did they do there they said
[1:12:45] such as I have I give yes sir oh what a
[1:12:48] reproach it is he said to drift from God
[1:12:50] and countenance those acts that defile
[1:12:52] his name you see somebody putting up
[1:12:55] with and not only putting up with but
[1:12:57] promoting yeah sinful things all right
[1:13:00] they need to come
[1:13:04] back you can't you can't just promote
[1:13:07] things in that's go on here in the world
[1:13:09] it's wrong you say well I don't do it
[1:13:12] but I don't mind if everybody else does
[1:13:13] no it's
[1:13:14] wrong it's wrong and we shouldn't
[1:13:16] countenance those things when you begin
[1:13:19] to countenance those acts that defile
[1:13:20] his name let those who name his name
[1:13:22] depart from sin and keep their vessels
[1:13:25] pure for God can we say Amen this
[1:13:27] morning look at what you once were in
[1:13:29] your heart and mind and in your life
[1:13:32] then go back to
[1:13:34] it what is the way back the way is the
[1:13:38] way of
[1:13:39] repentance if a sinner has to come to
[1:13:41] God by way of repentance then the
[1:13:44] lukewarm or backslider will have to
[1:13:46] repent that much more all right repent
[1:13:49] bring forth fruits meat for repentance
[1:13:51] prove it by your life
[1:13:54] yes he said if you do not repent said
[1:13:56] God I will remove your lampstand
[1:13:57] certainly a church in that condition
[1:13:59] can't give life to the world it's light
[1:14:01] is turned to Darkness and people don't
[1:14:04] understand when repentance happens
[1:14:06] something
[1:14:07] changes it's not just a repentance of
[1:14:10] saying I'm sorry but something actually
[1:14:14] changes it's a it's a it's a burning up
[1:14:17] and a doing away and a and a and a
[1:14:19] rotting and a changing and it's a
[1:14:21] transforming it's something changes it's
[1:14:24] different and you'll see it in
[1:14:26] somebody's life somebody can say well I
[1:14:28] I've repented and then they have the
[1:14:29] same old attitude that they always had
[1:14:32] they they they just haven't really found
[1:14:33] a place of repentance right they might
[1:14:36] have said I'm sorry but they haven't
[1:14:38] found a place yeah I said church we need
[1:14:40] to find a place of repentance and that
[1:14:43] place is in the word of God that's good
[1:14:46] now look he said repent bring forth
[1:14:48] fruits meat for repentance Pro by your
[1:14:50] life if you don't then I will remove
[1:14:52] your lampstand and certainly a church in
[1:14:54] that condition can't give light to the
[1:14:55] world its light has turned to Darkness
[1:14:57] God will then take away his faithful
[1:14:58] messenger and faithful Shepherds and
[1:15:00] leave them to themselves they will go on
[1:15:02] talking about Christianity but be bereth
[1:15:03] of it repent quickly yeah quickly now
[1:15:08] you children can understand
[1:15:11] that when you when you put the Log on
[1:15:14] the
[1:15:16] Fire and you kick it out in the
[1:15:19] woods and you know you're the one that
[1:15:21] did
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:24] repent
[1:15:29] quickly right repent
[1:15:32] quickly don't
[1:15:34] hesitate you start lying and then you
[1:15:37] have to tell another lie on top of that
[1:15:39] lie right and you kids are old enough to
[1:15:41] understand that when is the time to
[1:15:43] repent when you do something
[1:15:47] wrong when you do something wrong at
[1:15:49] that moment you're going to do wrong sir
[1:15:52] you're going to mess up
[1:15:53] you're a human
[1:15:55] being but in those moments you you girls
[1:15:58] understand that you're going to mess up
[1:16:00] there's going to be times in your life
[1:16:01] Jasper that you that you mess up that
[1:16:03] that's part of being human but you
[1:16:04] repent quickly come back to the word
[1:16:07] repent quickly don't just say well I did
[1:16:10] that I might as well do something else
[1:16:11] might as well go no repent quickly you
[1:16:13] don't want to know what it's like to not
[1:16:15] have the presence of God in your life
[1:16:16] you don't want to leave the presence of
[1:16:18] God repent quickly come back to where
[1:16:20] you
[1:16:22] were
[1:16:23] don't hesitate no matter how
[1:16:25] embarrassing it might be to repent
[1:16:28] repent because it'll only be
[1:16:31] worse repent quickly don't hesitate
[1:16:34] evidently Ephesus did hesitate for a
[1:16:36] lifespan was not very long the glory of
[1:16:38] God decreased ever so rapidly it was not
[1:16:40] long until the city was in Ruins his
[1:16:42] glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass
[1:16:44] the land became a marsh inhabited by
[1:16:46] waterf the population was gone except
[1:16:49] for a few unbelievers in a squalet
[1:16:51] village there was not even one Christian
[1:16:53] left now think about it the book of
[1:16:56] Ephesians was written to a mature Church
[1:16:58] yeah it was the model Church in the New
[1:17:01] Testament yeah right and within a few
[1:17:03] years there was not even a church there
[1:17:07] right why because they did not repent
[1:17:12] right he said the lamp was rent from its
[1:17:14] place he said now it does not mean that
[1:17:17] she could not have repented it does not
[1:17:19] mean that we cannot repent we can but it
[1:17:22] must quickly it must be a true heart cry
[1:17:26] to God and sorrow and then God will
[1:17:29] restore amen the glory shall come
[1:17:33] again why why
[1:17:36] repent why does god
[1:17:38] require repentance well it's because we
[1:17:40] have a
[1:17:41] choice I've talked to you a lot about
[1:17:44] the seed and and how that you can't do
[1:17:46] anything to earn the favor of God and we
[1:17:48] believe that but he did put you here
[1:17:51] with a choice that when you are
[1:17:54] overwhelmed by his love you get to say
[1:17:57] yes yeah does that make
[1:18:00] sense when he arranges everything in
[1:18:03] such a way that that it seems like
[1:18:05] everything it's just the perfect timing
[1:18:08] you get to say yes now think about it
[1:18:12] Rebecca when elaser come down to get
[1:18:14] Rebecca she
[1:18:16] didn't she didn't have to hire the
[1:18:19] camels y all she had to do was water
[1:18:22] them y that's good she didn't have to it
[1:18:26] wasn't her servant that went out looking
[1:18:28] for
[1:18:29] Isaac she didn't have to go looking for
[1:18:31] him he came looking for her yeah and the
[1:18:35] servant came down the model servant
[1:18:36] elzer we know was the type of the
[1:18:38] messenger of the hour in this age he
[1:18:40] come down looking for her yeah the
[1:18:42] message came to you yes you didn't have
[1:18:45] to come to it it came to you right and
[1:18:47] it came to her and it came to her and
[1:18:50] her where where she was just going on in
[1:18:52] everyday life it came to her she had
[1:18:53] nothing to do with it coming but when
[1:18:55] the time come and they said will you go
[1:18:58] she said yes and that's what the true
[1:19:01] seed of God will do that's what the
[1:19:02] bride will do that's the one God has
[1:19:04] called that's what they'll do yes Lord
[1:19:07] when I hear the word yes Lord I will
[1:19:10] repent yes I'll live the word yes I'll
[1:19:12] do what God requires that's good yes yes
[1:19:16] Lord we have a choice the BR said you
[1:19:20] have a choice God made it so you can
[1:19:21] choose if you put Adam and Eve on free
[1:19:22] moral agency so they could choose and
[1:19:25] then they made the wrong choice he can
[1:19:26] do no more to you than he did to them
[1:19:28] he's got to put you the same thing so
[1:19:30] you can choose or reject
[1:19:33] yeah because there's times God shows his
[1:19:38] favor to people you know because not
[1:19:40] everybody even knows but there are times
[1:19:43] God will show his favor and it hardens a
[1:19:46] person we're going to get into that for
[1:19:48] just a moment and I want you to thank
[1:19:49] soberly this morning because it's
[1:19:52] important to us
[1:19:54] the the elect have a
[1:19:57] choice even the non-elect has a
[1:20:01] choice God knows their choice that's
[1:20:04] where forn knowledge comes in now
[1:20:06] Hebrews
[1:20:07] 11:24 now again looking at it from God's
[1:20:10] side he's not worried about you making
[1:20:11] the wrong choice that's right right but
[1:20:15] from down here where we look at it yeah
[1:20:19] our choices directly affect our life
[1:20:22] that's right does that make sense yes so
[1:20:25] we look at it from down here now the
[1:20:27] elect and the non-elect have a choice
[1:20:29] Hebrews 11:24 by faith Moses when he was
[1:20:31] come to years refused to be called the
[1:20:34] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:20:36] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[1:20:38] people of God and to enjoy the pleasures
[1:20:40] of sin for a season esteeming the
[1:20:43] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:20:45] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:20:48] respect to the recompense of the reward
[1:20:52] now watch he chose he is the elect he's
[1:20:56] the one God called but he had to
[1:21:00] choose now look at Paul as as he
[1:21:02] balances this out in Romans 9:14 he said
[1:21:05] what shall we say then is there
[1:21:06] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[1:21:08] he sayith to Moses I will have mercy on
[1:21:10] whom I will have mercy he had mercy on
[1:21:13] Moses that's why Moses could choose yeah
[1:21:15] it's good and I will have compassion on
[1:21:18] whom I will have compassion so then it
[1:21:21] is not of him that willth nor of him
[1:21:22] that runneth but of God that showeth
[1:21:24] mercy and Paul introduces the other
[1:21:27] character excuse me the other main
[1:21:29] character in the story of Moses is
[1:21:31] Pharaoh yeah
[1:21:33] Pharaoh had a choice as well all right
[1:21:36] yeah but he said to to Pharaoh even for
[1:21:39] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:21:41] right that I might show my power in thee
[1:21:43] that my name might be declared
[1:21:44] throughout all the Earth so there were
[1:21:45] many nations where the king never heard
[1:21:49] right Moses message yeah but Pharaoh
[1:21:52] heard heard it right you've heard it
[1:21:55] today now you get to make your
[1:21:57] choice right whether you accept it or
[1:22:00] reject it but many don't even hear
[1:22:03] they're not considered in that and
[1:22:05] they'll they they're part of the
[1:22:06] whosoever will many don't ever hear but
[1:22:08] but there are those who here who accept
[1:22:11] it and there are those who here who
[1:22:12] reject it who were meant to reject it
[1:22:15] yet God cannot make them reject it right
[1:22:18] oh my and even he has to wait until they
[1:22:21] reject it over and over and over again
[1:22:23] you say why why doesn't God punish the
[1:22:25] wicked because he's waiting until the
[1:22:27] cup is
[1:22:28] full the cup of iniquity has to be
[1:22:31] filled sir yes oh my but he's got a
[1:22:33] limit to his patience with the non-elect
[1:22:36] but the elect oh my his mercies are new
[1:22:39] every morning there's no limit to his
[1:22:41] patience with Jacob but with Esau
[1:22:43] there's a
[1:22:44] limit there's no oh God I hope you
[1:22:46] recognize it today if you can still come
[1:22:49] back to God you run to God yes say well
[1:22:52] I have have I crossed the line not if
[1:22:54] there's a desire in your heart there is
[1:22:55] a cup there is a limit to Esau but
[1:22:58] there's no limit to Jacob all right yes
[1:23:01] all right a limit to Pharaoh no limit to
[1:23:05] Moses that's right the scripture said to
[1:23:08] Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I
[1:23:09] raised thee up I might show my power in
[1:23:11] thee my name might be declared
[1:23:13] throughout all the Earth therefore have
[1:23:14] the mercy on whom he will have mercy
[1:23:17] whom he will he hardeneth that word
[1:23:19] hardeneth is to render stubborn yeah I
[1:23:22] want to be real serious with you this
[1:23:24] morning and brother Joel can preach you
[1:23:26] happy
[1:23:30] tonight I want you to understand
[1:23:32] stubbornness is a terrible sin the Bible
[1:23:35] says it's like
[1:23:36] witchcraft right right we cannot be
[1:23:38] stubborn with the word of God yeah even
[1:23:42] if we you say well I can't live it don't
[1:23:43] get in the way of somebody that can
[1:23:45] right and and trust that God can keep
[1:23:48] his word right don't be stubborn about
[1:23:51] it look look Moses had a deposit of
[1:23:56] faith in his life yeah he didn't put it
[1:23:59] there it was there right he could choose
[1:24:02] to follow the people of God because he
[1:24:04] could believe yeah oh
[1:24:07] Church in spite of what they look like
[1:24:10] he could believe right I wonder how many
[1:24:14] of you today while the church is doing
[1:24:17] good you you you can believe but when
[1:24:19] everything's going wrong can you believe
[1:24:21] yeah all right
[1:24:23] are you with me now when life is going
[1:24:24] good you can believe but what about when
[1:24:26] everything goes bad yeah can you believe
[1:24:29] right can you see past the nonsense can
[1:24:32] you see past the cultish behavior can
[1:24:34] you see past all the things that all the
[1:24:36] problems that have been around the
[1:24:37] message can you see past all of that and
[1:24:40] see this is God's people can you see
[1:24:43] past what you've been through can you
[1:24:45] see past the heartache can you see past
[1:24:47] the fear and can you say I know this is
[1:24:49] where I
[1:24:50] belong yes
[1:24:54] the faith in Moses caused him to make
[1:24:56] different choices than Pharaoh even when
[1:24:58] faced with the same set of circumstances
[1:25:01] yeah brother BR said Pharaoh with no
[1:25:04] faith seen God's children as Fanatics no
[1:25:07] faith he made them Slavs because he
[1:25:08] wasn't scared of what he said
[1:25:11] listen somebody will just say anything
[1:25:14] about the message Wonder somebody just
[1:25:17] run people down I
[1:25:20] wonder on look God help us today he saw
[1:25:24] the people of God as Fanatics because he
[1:25:27] had no faith he wasn't scared to say
[1:25:29] something about
[1:25:30] it he thought he was a God he wasn't
[1:25:34] afraid of God he thought he was a God he
[1:25:36] thought his gods that he served that he
[1:25:38] was a bishop he was the head General
[1:25:40] overseer his Gods was the one that did
[1:25:41] it nothing to this thing here so he made
[1:25:43] them slaves he laughed at them made fun
[1:25:45] of them just as the people do today the
[1:25:47] same thing exactly he said Moses fa seen
[1:25:50] them in the promised land now look
[1:25:51] Pharaoh had no faith so he could not see
[1:25:54] the people of God as being God's people
[1:25:56] I'm so glad that God put a deposit of
[1:25:58] faith in my heart that I can see past
[1:26:00] the veil of the flesh I can see past the
[1:26:02] problems can you see past it this
[1:26:04] morning I can see past the bondage and I
[1:26:07] can see this is God's people amen Moses
[1:26:11] Faith seen him in the promised land a
[1:26:12] blessed people it might be a hard fight
[1:26:15] to get them to the promise but Moses
[1:26:17] chose to go with them right so it's
[1:26:20] Faith caused repentance
[1:26:22] Moses to turn and go with them now the
[1:26:25] same Supernatural made Moses repent Jews
[1:26:28] the people of God made Pharaoh more
[1:26:31] stubborn right so brother B talks about
[1:26:34] Judas he talks about Pharaoh he talks
[1:26:36] about Esau how they were raised up for a
[1:26:38] purpose God knowing that they could not
[1:26:40] repent now we know and I I won't read
[1:26:42] all these quotes because I'm kind of
[1:26:44] running short on
[1:26:45] time we know that Judas was chosen by
[1:26:50] Jesus but he was not CLE
[1:26:52] clean you know that you find that in
[1:26:55] John
[1:26:56] 13:18 John 1310 through1 Judas was also
[1:27:01] given to Jesus by the father yeah John
[1:27:05] 17:12 and brother Bram said the choosing
[1:27:08] and the giving is the exact parallel as
[1:27:10] in the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh
[1:27:12] Jacob and Esau though Esau and Pharaoh
[1:27:14] were both forn they were predestinated
[1:27:17] to wrath or the end of Moses and Jacob
[1:27:19] was glorification right so we've stand
[1:27:21] in a great place today yeah on we get to
[1:27:24] choose all right sir whether we're seed
[1:27:27] of God or not I know that's that's a
[1:27:29] striking statement but if there is seed
[1:27:32] there there's a deposit of Faith to make
[1:27:34] that choice right does that make sense
[1:27:37] and so oh my so if you want to be saved
[1:27:40] I want I want you to hear this this
[1:27:41] morning if you want to be saved you can
[1:27:44] be
[1:27:44] saved right if there's a desire in your
[1:27:47] heart to cry out to God you can be saved
[1:27:51] yes
[1:27:52] now see God always warns somebody before
[1:27:55] judging them do you know that he always
[1:27:58] does he always does he he he never
[1:28:00] judges a man without warning him first
[1:28:02] but they man preach an entire sermon on
[1:28:04] that now look when Cain come it's a
[1:28:07] great example Eve got a man from the
[1:28:10] Lord right that's what she said that's
[1:28:12] why so many people stumble so well she
[1:28:14] how can he be serpent seed if he came
[1:28:15] from the Lord but brother bam explained
[1:28:17] that all babies are from the Lord yeah
[1:28:20] right all life is from the Lord yeah
[1:28:21] right so Eve got a man from the Lord but
[1:28:24] his choice showed there was no seed of
[1:28:27] Faith there because he was the seed of
[1:28:29] the serpent right right and God even
[1:28:32] tells him when he when he's all upset
[1:28:34] about it and he tells him if thou doest
[1:28:36] well shalt thou not be accepted and if
[1:28:39] thou doest not well sin lith at the door
[1:28:42] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[1:28:44] shalt rule over him so whether or not
[1:28:46] you're able to overcome that bitterness
[1:28:48] whether or not you're able to overcome
[1:28:50] that bondage whether or not you're able
[1:28:51] to overcome is all going to be dictated
[1:28:53] by choices you make and yet God put in
[1:28:55] you the deposit of Faith to make the
[1:28:57] right choice yeah so I want to encourage
[1:29:00] you this morning not to be a an
[1:29:02] unbeliever but to be a believer don't
[1:29:04] don't say well I just God made me this
[1:29:06] way I just can't do it I can't live it
[1:29:08] no you believe God oh yes and if you do
[1:29:12] well you'll be
[1:29:13] accepted that's good now another great
[1:29:17] example is is the country we live in
[1:29:20] America America had a chance to
[1:29:23] repent brother Brandon said he called
[1:29:25] him back off the mission field called
[1:29:28] Billy Grant back called Oral Roberts
[1:29:29] back and they they they crossed the
[1:29:31] country preaching
[1:29:33] repentance in
[1:29:35] 1956 they come preaching repentance but
[1:29:38] America turned it down God knew they
[1:29:41] would turn it down they were already
[1:29:44] written in the scripture to be that that
[1:29:46] that Beast that second beast that would
[1:29:47] rise up it's already there right
[1:29:52] start squeaking here in a
[1:29:54] minute it's already there oh my but yet
[1:29:58] they had a choice yeah oh God if I could
[1:30:02] just make you understand this morning
[1:30:03] you got a choice choose
[1:30:07] god
[1:30:08] listen America would not repent and so
[1:30:12] now their end is destruction brother BR
[1:30:15] said Ahab never repented at the rebuke
[1:30:16] of Elijah if Ahab would have repented
[1:30:19] walked softly before God the thing would
[1:30:20] never happen but David Ahab came down
[1:30:23] took ne's Vineyard had him murdered and
[1:30:25] all those evil things and I want to warn
[1:30:26] you here something else a Ahab did
[1:30:29] repent if you go read it for a while
[1:30:31] yeah but he didn't truly repent because
[1:30:33] he didn't completely change who he was
[1:30:36] right does that make sense he he he he
[1:30:39] he come back to church and we can say it
[1:30:40] that way walk softly before the Lord for
[1:30:42] a while but that's why Paul said judge
[1:30:44] nothing before the time we got to watch
[1:30:46] what our what the end result is for
[1:30:49] everybody that's me and you both now
[1:30:51] look Jezebel that Prophet walked out
[1:30:53] there he said with thus sayith the Lord
[1:30:55] but what did they do she only threatened
[1:30:56] to kill him what happened is prophecy
[1:30:58] was fulfilled the dogs eater looked
[1:30:59] ahab's blood just exactly according to
[1:31:01] his word he saw the cup full listen
[1:31:04] there the cup can get full yeah oh I
[1:31:08] tell you if I wasn't the elect of God I
[1:31:09] sure wouldn't want my cup to be full I'd
[1:31:12] want to do something good for those that
[1:31:14] are are you with me now but their cup
[1:31:18] can get full and God is patient with
[1:31:21] them look at the mercy of God he's
[1:31:23] patient with them until the cup is full
[1:31:25] that's why we're still here he's patient
[1:31:28] with them because the cup the cup has to
[1:31:30] get full but finally God saw that ahab's
[1:31:33] cup was full yeah Oh my he said Herod
[1:31:37] never repented when John said it's not
[1:31:38] lawful for you to have your brother's
[1:31:39] wife he never repented what did he do
[1:31:41] his wife re required the head of the
[1:31:43] Prophet listen you might have been
[1:31:44] caught up in the same thing Herod was
[1:31:46] caught up in but you repented why could
[1:31:48] you repent yes come on God help us today
[1:31:51] I don't give give you courage today not
[1:31:52] to look back at your past say well I did
[1:31:54] it no but to go forward and say but look
[1:31:56] what happened in my life I was not a
[1:31:59] Herod I was not in Jezebel I was not in
[1:32:02] Ahab I followed Christ sir
[1:32:06] good he said if no
[1:32:09] repentance oh
[1:32:11] God now look he said his wife required
[1:32:13] the head of the prophets he sure he
[1:32:14] didn't repent when he was rebuked to the
[1:32:15] Lord John told him no matter what he was
[1:32:17] a procurator whatever he was Emperor
[1:32:19] whoever he might be he must repent when
[1:32:21] God called areass upon him if no
[1:32:24] repentance and judgment is sure to come
[1:32:26] Hezekiah repented Nineveh repented
[1:32:27] Nineveh was not God's chosen people yeah
[1:32:31] right but they
[1:32:32] repented and they got another chance
[1:32:36] they ended up going back but they still
[1:32:37] got another
[1:32:39] chance look he said Ahab never repent
[1:32:42] Nebuchadnezzar never repent the people
[1:32:44] know it's time never repented judgment
[1:32:46] swept right on in he said now but he
[1:32:47] first warns everybody everybody gets a
[1:32:49] warning he said now seeing the time is
[1:32:51] at hand but everyone that feels that
[1:32:53] there is a warning how many know there's
[1:32:54] a warning this morning repent quickly
[1:32:56] before the wrath of God strikes you said
[1:32:59] now let's bring it down to the brandom
[1:33:01] Tabernacle see we have seen these things
[1:33:02] and know them to be the truth we know
[1:33:04] that it's absolutely the truth he said
[1:33:06] the commission of the word is if you
[1:33:07] will repent and be baptized in the name
[1:33:09] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:33:10] your sins you shall receive the gift of
[1:33:12] the Holy Ghost for the promises your
[1:33:14] children and them that's so far off you
[1:33:15] say well so many don't receive the Holy
[1:33:17] Ghost when they're baptized it's because
[1:33:18] they didn't do the first thing first
[1:33:20] repent yeah that's right and brother
[1:33:22] Brandon said if they're taught right he
[1:33:23] says that in one place he said we taught
[1:33:25] our people that that if they receive if
[1:33:26] they repented and he said and turned
[1:33:28] away from their sin and then were
[1:33:30] baptized that they would receive the
[1:33:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost when they come
[1:33:33] up out of the water yeah why God
[1:33:35] promised to give it to you he said he
[1:33:37] want he want you to have it more than
[1:33:38] you want it you got to repent first
[1:33:42] right now look repent and
[1:33:46] believe brother brandom talks about
[1:33:48] brother da in the first part he does
[1:33:51] this in the the first part of Christ is
[1:33:53] the mystery of God revealed we've been
[1:33:54] studying on Wednesday night we started
[1:33:56] on Wednesday night studying that
[1:33:58] sermon and he he talks to brother da and
[1:34:02] and this is another place he mentions it
[1:34:04] he gives brother da a spiritual checkup
[1:34:07] I me want to have a spiritual checkup
[1:34:08] this morning he gives me the da a
[1:34:11] spiritual checkup and he says he says
[1:34:14] this he said the same God that the and
[1:34:18] the same prophets that predicted the
[1:34:19] word of God or the Wrath to be poured
[1:34:20] out also told of these coming blessings
[1:34:23] he said I'm so glad but he he gave
[1:34:25] brother da a spiritual checkup he told
[1:34:26] him he said now if you went to the heart
[1:34:28] doctor he said he' look at his book His
[1:34:30] science book he said and tell you
[1:34:32] whether or not what you're experiencing
[1:34:34] what's happened in your life is heart
[1:34:36] disease he said so I'm going to tell you
[1:34:38] what the book says about what's happened
[1:34:40] in your life and he said you believed on
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ you were baptized in the
[1:34:45] name of Jesus Christ you received the
[1:34:47] gift of the Holy Ghost he said the
[1:34:48] doctor says you're going to heaven yeah
[1:34:51] right that's that's your condition oh my
[1:34:53] that's what you have that's your
[1:34:55] spiritual checkup yeah right but now he
[1:34:58] goes on he says God never does give a
[1:35:00] nation a destruction without warning it
[1:35:02] he never gives a man a destruction
[1:35:04] without warning it now if he does that
[1:35:05] we've got something that's happened to
[1:35:07] us the Vindication of the signs of the
[1:35:09] last days with us the great Holy Spirit
[1:35:11] moving Among Us charging the church with
[1:35:13] his presence vindicating his word he
[1:35:17] said then the church is getting ready
[1:35:18] for a climb into the skies one of these
[1:35:20] days by the power of God
[1:35:21] because it's a warning to lay aside
[1:35:23] every weight and the sin that does so
[1:35:25] easily beset us that we might fly with
[1:35:28] patience I love that he says Paul says
[1:35:30] run with patience brother Brown said fly
[1:35:32] with patience this race oh my you're an
[1:35:35] eagle today you can fly with patience
[1:35:38] just race it oh my that's set before us
[1:35:40] to the author and finisher of our faith
[1:35:43] he said God bless you Church hold to
[1:35:44] God's unchanging hand he said if you
[1:35:47] feel his presence go to
[1:35:49] him or if I can just just make it that
[1:35:52] clear to you young people if I can make
[1:35:53] it that clear to all of us when we feel
[1:35:55] his presence go to
[1:35:57] him go to him if there's anything wrong
[1:36:01] in your heart make it
[1:36:03] right we ain't got much time left to
[1:36:05] coming of the Lord that hand this is the
[1:36:08] hour of repentance the Bible says there
[1:36:09] were times when of ignorance God winked
[1:36:11] at but now commandeth all men everywhere
[1:36:14] to repent yes how do we
[1:36:16] repent as we come now we're going to go
[1:36:18] back to Psalms
[1:36:20] 51
[1:36:23] well that was kind of a foundation for
[1:36:25] just the next few
[1:36:27] minutes how do we repent first of all we
[1:36:30] acknowledge the nature of our
[1:36:33] sin and our sinful nature
[1:36:37] yeah now let me repeat that so you get
[1:36:39] it we acknowledge the nature of our sin
[1:36:42] and we also acknowledge our sinful
[1:36:46] nature look at Psalm 51:4 David says
[1:36:49] against thee the only have I
[1:36:52] sinned done this evil in thy
[1:36:55] sight that thou mightest be justified
[1:36:58] when thou speakest be clear when thou
[1:37:01] judgest in other words David says I'm
[1:37:03] not going to make any
[1:37:06] excuses it's
[1:37:08] me I'm the guy oh how different the
[1:37:13] results would be in our life if we'd
[1:37:16] approach
[1:37:17] repentance like this yes yes I'm not qu
[1:37:21] qualifying it I'm not going to make any
[1:37:26] excuses oh my I want you to be clear God
[1:37:31] this is
[1:37:32] me so that's the nature of my sin and I
[1:37:36] want to be clear Lord that I understand
[1:37:38] verse five behold I was shapen in
[1:37:42] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:37:44] conceive me this is not an excuse it's
[1:37:46] an acknowledgment yeah this is who I am
[1:37:51] and I need to be changed right I must be
[1:37:55] changed all right to live right to be a
[1:37:58] Christian yes David did not have the
[1:38:00] benefit that we have of the literal Life
[1:38:02] of Christ being able to come back on the
[1:38:03] believer he could only have him in a
[1:38:05] certain way in a measure but you and I
[1:38:07] can have the fullness of it aren't you
[1:38:09] glad for that and he said if you do
[1:38:11] these things you'll never fall amen oh
[1:38:13] what a promise that
[1:38:15] is but look here he said against the and
[1:38:19] the only I was shapen an iniquity
[1:38:21] inced my mother conceived me behold thou
[1:38:24] desirest truth in the inward Parts yeah
[1:38:29] in other words God you want me to be
[1:38:31] honest with myself
[1:38:36] yeah so whatever I'm doing I'm not going
[1:38:38] to try to excuse it I'm not going to try
[1:38:39] to qualify it I'm not going to try to
[1:38:42] say well this no you know I don't drink
[1:38:45] much yeah I don't smoke very
[1:38:48] often I don't do drugs but every now and
[1:38:54] then I I don't I don't lie all the
[1:38:58] time
[1:39:01] right sometimes I feel the presence of
[1:39:03] God that can be such a deceptive thing
[1:39:06] yeah because you realize you feel God in
[1:39:08] your outer realm right right you don't
[1:39:11] feel God from the inside you feel him in
[1:39:13] the outer realm yeah and we love to feel
[1:39:15] God but you can be backslid as all get
[1:39:18] out and still feel God right but you
[1:39:21] won't respond in the same
[1:39:23] way as if you were
[1:39:25] right look what he says you want
[1:39:31] truth you want me to be honest with
[1:39:35] myself that this isn't good yeah what
[1:39:39] I'm doing is not
[1:39:41] working I need help
[1:39:44] yes I've talked to people and tried to
[1:39:46] tell them the worst thing you can do is
[1:39:48] just try to try to defend yourself yeah
[1:39:51] yeah no just Lord I need help am I need
[1:39:55] I need a partner I need people I need I
[1:39:57] need to talk to somebody I I need I need
[1:40:02] help
[1:40:04] look he said you desire truth and in the
[1:40:08] hidden part Thou shalt make me to know
[1:40:11] wisdom I'm so glad he said he said
[1:40:14] you'll you'll make me understand the
[1:40:16] depth of my sin but you're also going to
[1:40:18] make me understand that I can be for for
[1:40:21] given that I can be clean that I can oh
[1:40:24] God I can come back I'm not stuck where
[1:40:26] I was come on good he says be honest
[1:40:31] with
[1:40:32] yourself and also acknowledge his
[1:40:35] ability to cleanse
[1:40:39] you so I think part of the reason that
[1:40:42] we're not always completely honest with
[1:40:44] ourselves is that we're afraid that
[1:40:47] maybe if we were really honest with God
[1:40:50] that he would somehow be unable to
[1:40:53] forgive us and it's a lie from hell all
[1:40:59] right there is no sin that cannot be
[1:41:02] forgiven right brother brandom talks
[1:41:05] about lady mcabe he talks about that
[1:41:07] woman who' done so many bad things and
[1:41:10] he said all the religions got together
[1:41:12] and they told about lady mcabe and how
[1:41:14] awful that she was all the blood she had
[1:41:15] on her hands and a man stood up and he
[1:41:18] said can any of your religion cleansed
[1:41:21] the hands of Lady makabe of her
[1:41:24] sins and they all sat in silence and he
[1:41:27] clapped his hands together and he said
[1:41:29] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[1:41:31] cleansed her hands it'll cleanse their
[1:41:35] heart all right she might have been the
[1:41:37] worst woman that ever was but God came
[1:41:39] for that kind of a person he might have
[1:41:41] been the worst man that ever was but God
[1:41:43] came for that kind of person but he
[1:41:45] wants you to recognize
[1:41:47] yourself want you to be honest he
[1:41:49] desires truth in the inward Parts
[1:41:52] yes knowledge he can do it Psalm 517
[1:41:58] David this this is worship man you talk
[1:42:00] about worship this is worship Purge me
[1:42:03] with his come on Gooden and I'll be
[1:42:07] clean yes sir I'm not going to live a
[1:42:10] defeated life David said I know I'm not
[1:42:12] happy I was I know what it's like to be
[1:42:14] happy in the presence of God I know what
[1:42:16] it's like to have the joy of my
[1:42:18] salvation and I'm not going to be
[1:42:19] content until I know it
[1:42:22] again what he say Let me let me know it
[1:42:25] Purge me and I know I'll be clean that
[1:42:29] takes Faith yeah that's the that's the
[1:42:31] second part of it you got to repent but
[1:42:33] you got to believe if you don't believe
[1:42:35] you'll never repent fully because you
[1:42:37] don't believe he can take it but if you
[1:42:39] if you know he can handle it you'll give
[1:42:41] it to
[1:42:42] him amen Purge me and I will be clean
[1:42:46] wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
[1:42:51] I know what I did you desired truth in
[1:42:53] the inward Parts I know how bad I was
[1:42:55] but if you'll Wash Me Lord I wonder how
[1:42:57] many of us can say that this morning I
[1:43:00] know what I've been I know what my
[1:43:02] sinful nature is every one of us can say
[1:43:04] that as I said about my grandpa I

[1:43:24] make me to hear
[1:43:29] Joy that's good he said Lord I've gotten
[1:43:33] in such a condition that I've become
[1:43:37] deaf to
[1:43:39] happiness
[1:43:42] y can hear
[1:43:47] Joy No matter how happy a situation
[1:43:50] might be how beautiful it is I can't

[1:44:25] which thou Hast broken which thou Hast
[1:44:28] broken May Rejoice God had to break some
[1:44:31] bones in David's life to get him to this
[1:44:34] place he had CA some there were some
[1:44:37] terrible scars like the wandering sheep
[1:44:39] that wanders off the off away from the
[1:44:42] herd and the and the shepherd has to go
[1:44:44] with it and break the leg of the sheep
[1:44:46] yeah but he said the same oh God the
[1:44:49] same leg that you broke you can
[1:44:52] restore the oh God the same God that
[1:44:55] made me convicted the same God that
[1:44:58] pricked my heart can make me dance in
[1:45:00] the house of God again can make me shout
[1:45:02] God I wonder if we realize that this
[1:45:04] morning I wonder if we really understand

[1:45:08] bring them back together again the same
[1:45:10] God that brought brought brought brought
[1:45:13] correction to my life can also make me

[1:47:36] our attitude towards our spouse it's got
[1:47:39] to change yeah or it's not real
[1:47:41] repentance right and so David said I

[1:50:36] to worship you God sorry I'm held you a
[1:50:39] little bit long this morning but can we
[1:50:41] just do this this morning with
[1:50:43] David can can we worship this with David
[1:50:45] as I imagine maybe my grandfather in all
[1:50:47] the limited knowledge that he had of the
[1:50:49] scripture but I remember his face
[1:50:50] lighting up in the house of God and he
[1:50:52] may have been a difficult man he might
[1:50:54] have had a lot of things going on in his
[1:50:55] life but he read the scripture he said
[1:50:57] Lord I Want To Worship You I want to go
[1:50:59] to the house of God I want to raise my
[1:51:01] hands again I want to praise you I want
[1:51:03] to feel what it's like to be in your
[1:51:04] presence I may have a I may be I may
[1:51:06] have a hard life I may have had a broken
[1:51:09] past but Lord he said deliver me from
[1:51:11] blood guiltiness oh God thou God of my
[1:51:14] salvation and my tongue shall sing where
[1:51:17] shall sing out loud my tongue will sing
[1:51:20] out loud out loud of thy righteousness

[1:52:17] Moses that's the difference in Esau and
[1:52:19] Jacob God Jacob was broken and he was
[1:52:22] broken so he could be remade when Esau
[1:52:25] got broken he tried to put the pieces
[1:52:27] back together but he never could yeah I

[1:56:09] God I don't
[1:56:11] know what you've been going

[1:56:52] if you need to repent run quickly to God
[1:56:54] but you can do that right where you're
[1:56:56] standing but many times I think we need
