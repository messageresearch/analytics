[45:23] that the Lord will take care of us 1
[45:26] Chronicles 15:3 as we've been preaching
[45:29] about the Ark of the Lord and how it was
[45:31] brought back to its
[45:36] place and David gathered all Israel
[45:39] together to Jerusalem to bring up the
[45:41] Ark of the Lord unto his
[45:44] place which he had prepared for it unto
[45:47] his place which he had prepared for it I
[45:49] want to speak to you this morning on the
[45:50] word in his place the Lord would add his
[45:53] Blessing to the word let's bow our heads

[46:37] reality in the lives of the people Lord

[46:44] could be met by the preaching of the
[46:45] word I pray God that you'd move me aside
[46:48] and speak directly to that situation we
[46:50] thank you for these people that have

[47:05] are welcome to come but I would like for
[47:08] our young ones tonight we got several of
[47:09] them sitting up here on the front I
[47:11] would like for our young ones to sit up
[47:13] front tonight and uh especially
[47:16] teenagers and um if you can do that
[47:19] we're going to use some of them my
[47:20] brother Peter there's a rumor brother
[47:22] Peter's going to lead some of the songs
[47:25] and um he say that's what I was told so
[47:28] we're going to we're going to try to uh
[47:30] do that and and just have a good old
[47:32] time in the Lord amen and use some of
[47:35] these young people in in the work of the
[47:37] Lord if you don't know if they can do it
[47:39] till you try it right so amen amen so
[47:43] we're going to do that tonight and and
[47:45] looking forward to that brother the
[47:46] Joel's going to preach in that service
[47:48] I'm just a little bit under the weather
[47:49] as you can probably already tell it's
[47:51] just the change of the weather I'm not
[47:52] sick and as far as uh I don't I don't
[47:55] have coid or something like that but I'm
[47:57] just a little bit under the weather from
[47:58] the weather change and so you pray for
[48:00] me this morning uh we need to pray for
[48:03] Israel I uh there's so much going on
[48:06] right now I don't have time to get into
[48:07] it all this morning but there a war
[48:09] there and I understand there's some 500
[48:11] people on the Israeli side that's
[48:14] already been killed and and uh it's such
[48:16] a tragedy such a tragedy of of a Nation
[48:20] but also because we believe Israel has a
[48:23] place in the end time and we see that
[48:25] that coming to pass and you know they
[48:27] haven't it's been 50 years since they've
[48:29] declared war uh in Israel and they
[48:31] declared war this morning and so I think
[48:34] we're maybe closer than than we think
[48:38] Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree put
[48:39] forth its buds and we understand that to
[48:41] be the the nation of Israel becoming a
[48:43] nation he said when you see that you
[48:45] know summer is nigh he said look up lift
[48:48] up your heads your Redemption draws nigh
[48:51] and so I believe that's the hour that
[48:53] we're living in and then uh you know
[48:55] there there's so much going on there and
[48:57] uh there's a I understand brother Doug
[49:00] Baker there's one of his deacons is
[49:02] there in Israel was there yesterday
[49:04] anyway and I'm able to get a flight home
[49:06] so we need to pray for that brother and
[49:08] his wife as well and I just believe the
[49:10] Lord's going to keep his hand on all all
[49:12] the elect all the Believers uh we know
[49:15] we're getting close church and these
[49:18] things have to happen but we also know
[49:20] that we're under the care of a mighty
[49:22] God a sovereign God but the Bible says
[49:25] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and we
[49:27] would be blessed so we'll do that
[49:29] continue to keep them in your
[49:31] prayers as we uh continue with our story
[49:34] this morning of uh David bringing the
[49:37] ark back or attempting to bring the ark
[49:39] back to the place uh to Jerusalem and to
[49:44] a place where it could be inquired of
[49:46] and it could be of use to the people of
[49:48] God as we found out last week he was
[49:50] right in wanting to do that but he did
[49:53] it in the wrong way and many times
[49:55] that's what happens is our good
[49:57] intentions are not always enough we've
[50:00] got to go by the word we've got to stay
[50:02] with what God Said regardless of any
[50:04] good intentions that we may have we've
[50:07] got to stay with the book we've got to
[50:09] stay with what God Said So Many but but
[50:13] what happened is that David when that
[50:15] happened and usza died as we talked
[50:17] about last week it woke him up he
[50:19] realized hey we did this thing wrong but
[50:22] he actually had an overreaction to it
[50:24] which is simp SAR to one that we have
[50:26] like uh we see people that go into
[50:29] excess you see the charismatic church
[50:32] today and many of the people that uh
[50:34] television preachers how they've gone
[50:36] into an excess of uh Financial gospel or
[50:39] Prosperity Gospel you see the people
[50:42] today that have gone in an excess of uh
[50:45] of worship without any word at all and
[50:47] so people tend to look at that and begin
[50:49] to get scared and David got scared he
[50:52] said here we had all the big meeting we
[50:55] we called called everybody together we
[50:56] had worship we had uh we had uh we had
[50:59] the tongues and interpretation and we
[51:02] had uh we had gifts we had all these
[51:04] things and yet it wasn't right and so he
[51:06] got scared of all of it and the Bible
[51:09] says that uh David was afraid of God
[51:12] that day saying how shall I bring the
[51:14] Ark of God home to me so in other words
[51:18] God if if God would here an innocent man
[51:21] would die even though I was doing my
[51:22] best to try to serve God how could I do
[51:25] it but I want to tell you this morning
[51:27] we should not be afraid of the presence
[51:29] of God we should not be afraid of the
[51:32] move of the spirit we should not be
[51:34] afraid there is a right way that we can
[51:37] have the fullness of the word we should
[51:38] not be afraid of digging into the
[51:40] message of the hour getting those
[51:42] nuggets out we should not be afraid of
[51:44] the word of God because so many have
[51:46] went into excess with it we should not
[51:48] be afraid of the opening of the word we
[51:50] should not be afraid of the Seven Seals
[51:52] we should not be afraid of God coming
[51:54] down in our day we should not be afraid
[51:57] to preach the message of the
[51:59] hour oh someone come make a cult out of
[52:01] it or do something else we should not be
[52:04] afraid of doing what God has told us is
[52:06] right to do in our hour we can still
[52:08] clap our hands we can still worship we
[52:10] can still call out to God we can still
[52:12] have altar calls we can still have
[52:14] prayer lines we can still work for God
[52:16] we can do that without doing it in the
[52:18] wrong way let's just stay with the word
[52:20] while we do
[52:22] it are you with me now
[52:25] so but David was scared and many folks
[52:29] today are scared to worship God that's
[52:31] right scared to really oh if I if I
[52:34] raise up my hands maybe I'll become a
[52:35] Target if I shout in church maybe on
[52:38] Monday I'll be a Target but I'll tell
[52:39] you this you might as well you're a
[52:41] Target anyway you might as well worship
[52:44] God in the house of God cuz the devil's
[52:46] got his sight on you anyway he's trying
[52:48] to destroy you anyway it doesn't matter
[52:50] what you do the devil's at to get you
[52:52] but God is for you he said greater is he
[52:55] that is in you than he that is in the
[52:57] world you might as well worship God
[53:00] might as well let the word come to its
[53:02] place yes sir in its
[53:05] fullness amen so we don't need to be
[53:09] scared to worship God right we don't
[53:11] need to be scared to to do the things
[53:13] that are necessary to go to church to
[53:16] have pastors to believe what God Said
[53:19] Yes it just because somebody did it
[53:21] wrong doesn't mean that we have to do it
[53:24] wrong
[53:25] 1st Chronicles 13:13 so David brought
[53:28] not the ark home what a tragedy that was
[53:32] see he could have just picked it up and
[53:33] did it right yeah and carried it on into
[53:36] Jerusalem but but he didn't do it
[53:38] because he he realized now that and
[53:41] there was another issue as well but he
[53:44] realized that that he he was scared
[53:47] because he was afraid they' do it wrong
[53:49] and so he carried it into somebody
[53:51] else's house it was obededom the gitite
[53:55] and the Ark of God remained with the
[53:57] family of OED Edom in his house three
[54:00] months like this remember everywhere it
[54:03] went it caused death and destruction but
[54:05] when it come into the house of OED Edom
[54:08] and all that he had he said the Lord
[54:10] bless that house and all that he had
[54:13] listen when you let the word come into
[54:15] your house the Lord will bless your
[54:17] house I've told people before I've
[54:19] challenged them if you'll just do what
[54:21] the word says if you'll just do the
[54:23] simple things that you know to do just
[54:25] the Bible scriptural things you know to
[54:27] do just follow the message the best you
[54:29] know how to do it and if you'll do that
[54:31] you'll begin to se God because obedience
[54:33] entitles you to the Token you'll begin
[54:35] to see God move in your life you begin
[54:37] to see Supernatural things just because
[54:39] you started doing the the simple things
[54:43] the things you know to do that's right
[54:45] and you'll see Supernatural that'll come
[54:47] from that so the Lord blessed the house
[54:50] I believe the Lord's blessed my house
[54:52] not because of who I am not because I
[54:54] did everything just right but because
[54:55] the word has comeing my house I've
[54:57] opened up my doors and said Lord I'm
[54:59] willing to let your word dwell right
[55:02] here in my house amen Thank You Lord For
[55:05] the First Time The Ark was a blessing
[55:06] and not a
[55:08] curse amen bring the word in your house
[55:11] and God will bless it don't be scared of
[55:12] it let it dwell
[55:14] there don't be scared well I don't want
[55:17] my kids to become some kind of man
[55:19] followers just let the word dwell in
[55:21] your
[55:21] house let it dwell there in its fullness
[55:25] now one of the reasons that David failed
[55:28] in bringing back the ark the first time
[55:30] is he failed to prepare a place for it
[55:33] see the ark needed a place to
[55:36] rest so he was trying to bring the ark
[55:39] brother brandom said to the city of
[55:40] David to his own denomination and
[55:43] there's where we fail so many times is
[55:46] we're trying to we're trying to bring
[55:48] the word of God and we're trying to let
[55:50] the Revival come with it but we want it
[55:52] in our own way we want it according to
[55:56] our own teaching the way we've been
[55:57] taught and our own church and and our
[56:00] own little group and our own little
[56:01] fellowship and and I see that so many
[56:03] places today so we're subject to that
[56:06] too say God well I would believe that
[56:07] way if it was in my church if it
[56:09] happened to me if it was like I said
[56:11] many people don't have a problem so much
[56:13] with what's going on with the Revival
[56:15] they just have a problem with the
[56:16] Revival not happening to them and so
[56:19] they criticize it because it wasn't in
[56:20] their Church they criticize it because
[56:22] it wasn't part of their organization but
[56:24] it's time we opened up our minds and
[56:26] opened up our hearts and said Lord
[56:28] however you want to do it wherever you
[56:29] want to do it whatever you want to do I
[56:32] believe it's time for you to
[56:34] move brother brand said he was trying to
[56:36] bring the ark to the city of David his
[56:39] own
[56:41] denomination and so he and and many
[56:43] times we we see Revival we see things
[56:45] begin to happen we criticize it just
[56:47] because it's not us yeah and we should
[56:49] never do that I say if the church down
[56:51] the road has a Revival let's support it
[56:54] if the people down the road if another
[56:56] Pastor is blessed thank God for the
[56:57] blessing I I I hope the cup gets so full
[57:00] and spill over on us come on now right
[57:03] that's the way we ought to be because
[57:05] because we realize what God does is
[57:07] Sovereign and what God does he does in
[57:10] his way in his time yeah in the place of
[57:13] his
[57:13] choosing so and this is what happened to
[57:17] brother Brandon when he started out in
[57:18] his ministry you know he said the the
[57:20] the Oneness wanted him the Trinity
[57:22] wanted him the Assemblies of God wanted
[57:24] him these other denominations wanted him
[57:26] but they wanted him in their own place
[57:28] yeah right they wanted him in their own
[57:30] place they wanted the the healing they
[57:33] wanted the restoration of the gifts but
[57:34] they wanted it in their in their
[57:37] church and and brother brand wouldn't do
[57:40] that and so many of them rejected it he
[57:42] said they wanted to bring it to the city
[57:43] of David why there was no place ready
[57:45] for it Oh my he said that's the reason
[57:48] you can't bring the message to a
[57:50] denomination word the ark Christ the
[57:53] same yesterday today and forever and all
[57:54] identification you can't bring it to
[57:56] your organization they'll never believe
[57:58] it cuz there's no room for it they got
[58:02] room for everything else but not for the
[58:04] word they got room for soup suppers but
[58:06] not the word they got room for
[58:08] charitable acts and that's wonderful to
[58:10] do charity charitable acts but they
[58:12] don't have room for the word and what
[58:13] has happened in our day when when music
[58:15] takes up all the all the service and
[58:18] there's nothing wrong with music but
[58:20] there's got to be a place for the word
[58:22] there's nothing wrong with there's
[58:24] nothing wrong wrong with programs
[58:25] there's nothing wrong with Sunday school
[58:27] programs and things activities for the
[58:29] kids but the word has got to have first
[58:31] place it's got to have a preeminence
[58:33] among us if it doesn't what are we doing
[58:35] here anyway yeah oh my the word is not
[58:38] my word but the word of God Christ has
[58:41] to have first place in our
[58:43] midst so he said he said they'll never
[58:46] believe it because there's no room for
[58:48] it he said there was no place ready for
[58:50] it at that time and so it is today he
[58:54] said these great Mysteries that's been
[58:56] unfolded by the Seven Seals there's not
[58:58] a place in any denomination he said
[59:01] would have to quit being a denomination
[59:02] to take
[59:04] it all the way from Luther on down to
[59:06] the Pentecostal Oneness there's not a
[59:08] place can receive it oh my but I'm so
[59:11] glad you realize that brother Brown even
[59:13] early in his ministry he couldn't bring
[59:14] those things because there was no place
[59:16] for it there was no people to receive it
[59:19] but there's a place for it now there's a
[59:21] place for the word to come back there's
[59:23] a place for the opening book there's a
[59:25] place for the ark there's a place for
[59:27] worship there's a place we can it can
[59:29] come back in our
[59:31] house there there's a place to receive
[59:34] it and 1 Chronicles 15:1 and David made
[59:37] him houses in the city of David and he
[59:40] didn't forget God he prepared a place
[59:44] for the Ark of God and pitched for it a
[59:48] tent the Lord wouldn't let him build a
[59:50] permanent Temple remember that was
[59:52] Solomon's job because my remember that's
[59:56] a type of the Millennium Solomon's Reign
[59:57] is a type of the Millennium there will
[59:59] come a time when the word comes into its
[1:00:02] incarnate body and Jesus Christ himself
[1:00:05] lives on the throne right that's why we
[1:00:07] watch what happens in Jerusalem because
[1:00:09] one day the Corporal body of Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ will set foot on the Mount of
[1:00:13] Olives that's what the Bible says he'll
[1:00:16] come in like manner as we saw him go
[1:00:18] away and he'll come back and set his
[1:00:20] foot on the Mount of Olives and when he
[1:00:21] does he'll Rule and
[1:00:23] reign right he'll Rule and Reign we've
[1:00:25] been looking at that on Wednesday nights
[1:00:27] when it comes to the uh when it comes to
[1:00:30] the seals and things that are going on
[1:00:32] and it gives you great light and comfort
[1:00:34] when it comes to the things that are
[1:00:35] happening in the news because we know
[1:00:38] what the end is we don't know exactly
[1:00:39] how it'll get there we know what the end
[1:00:41] is yes so David prepared a place not the
[1:00:46] temple but a tent now if you go to Psalm
[1:00:50] 275 you'll find that and I want to tell
[1:00:53] you this morning with without trying to
[1:00:55] scare you but I believe in a tent
[1:00:59] Doctrine I said I believe in a tent
[1:01:02] Doctrine I do a tent a
[1:01:06] tabernacle right brother brandom taught
[1:01:08] us in the Bible teaches if you look at
[1:01:10] the original you'll find that you'll
[1:01:12] find that a tent a tent was seen as a
[1:01:15] habitation or a tabernacle or dwelling
[1:01:17] place and so he talked about when Jesus
[1:01:19] come to Earth God stretched his tent
[1:01:22] right he made his tent among men his
[1:01:24] ation his his his Tabernacle his movable
[1:01:28] Dwelling
[1:01:29] Place amen so there's a tent that I
[1:01:32] believe in so he says in the time of
[1:01:35] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:01:38] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:01:40] hide me he shall set me upon a rock the
[1:01:42] word Tabernacle is tent yeah if you
[1:01:44] translate It Go in a modern translation
[1:01:46] that's what that is so in the secret of
[1:01:48] his tent shall he hide me he shall set
[1:01:50] me upon a rock now we know that's a
[1:01:52] scripture pertaining to the rapture
[1:01:55] right so now in in the secret of of a
[1:01:58] tent he's going to hide me now acts 7
[1:02:01] verse 44 tells us he said our fathers
[1:02:03] this is Stephen preaching that wonderful
[1:02:05] sermon before he got his before he got
[1:02:08] stoned sometimes you got to preach where
[1:02:10] you get stoned a little bit sometimes
[1:02:12] you just got to preach the word but acts
[1:02:14] 7:44 he said our fathers had the
[1:02:16] Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[1:02:18] as he had appointed speaking unto Moses
[1:02:20] as he should make it according to the
[1:02:22] fashion that he had seen which also our
[1:02:24] father fathers that came after brought
[1:02:25] in with Jesus into the possession of the
[1:02:27] Gentiles that Jesus there is Joshua whom
[1:02:30] God drave out before the face of our
[1:02:31] fathers unto the days of David who found
[1:02:34] favor before God and desired to find a
[1:02:36] tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[1:02:39] Solomon built him a house how be it the
[1:02:42] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[1:02:43] with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven
[1:02:46] is my throne and Earth is my foot stol
[1:02:49] what house will you build me he says
[1:02:52] what is the place of my rest all he was
[1:02:54] was always looking forward to a time not
[1:02:56] when he could be hidden behind a badger
[1:02:58] skin not when he could be hidden in a
[1:03:00] tent or in a temple in the holy of
[1:03:03] holies but he was looking forward to a
[1:03:04] time when he could be hidden in the
[1:03:06] hearts of men that's exactly what he
[1:03:08] wanted to come to that's exactly where
[1:03:11] he is this morning he's here in the
[1:03:13] church because he's in me he's in you so
[1:03:17] now he dwells not in the temple made
[1:03:19] with hands and you couple that with
[1:03:20] Hebrews chap 10 verse 5 he said
[1:03:23] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:03:24] he sayth sacrifice and offering thou
[1:03:26] wouldest not but a body hast thou
[1:03:28] prepared me a body he wanted a body to
[1:03:31] dwell in and he dwelt in Oh my he dwelt

[1:03:44] the upper room and on as many as would
[1:03:47] believe yeah right down Through the Ages

[1:10:37] glory of God but it's not always shaking
[1:10:39] it's not always running it's not always
[1:10:41] shouting sometimes it's just being in

[1:11:44] right the Holy Ghost is tabernacling
[1:11:46] deity your words is his words yes how do
[1:11:50] you prepare a place for the ark you
[1:11:52] prepare that place by the new creation 2
[1:11:54] Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man
[1:11:57] someone say If any
[1:11:59] man be in Christ he is what a new
[1:12:02] creature that word in the original is
[1:12:04] creation he is a new creation old things
[1:12:07] are passed away the old how many things
[1:12:12] All Things become new I don't know about
[1:12:14] you but I faced some moments in my life
[1:12:16] when I needed all things to be
[1:12:20] new I didn't want to be who I was
[1:12:23] anymore more yeah I didn't want to do
[1:12:25] what I did anymore needed all things I
[1:12:27] didn't want just a partial renovation I
[1:12:30] didn't want a kitchen redo I didn't want
[1:12:33] just just part of me I didn't want just
[1:12:34] my emotions just my just just that part
[1:12:37] of me I didn't want just the Flesh of
[1:12:38] the spirit Lord all things I need all
[1:12:41] things to become new the good thing
[1:12:43] about all things becoming new is nothing
[1:12:45] is recognizable anymore you walk into a
[1:12:48] place where all things have become new
[1:12:50] and you don't recognize anything there's
[1:12:52] no there's no a memory of the past
[1:12:55] although you may remember it in your
[1:12:56] mind and your flesh but to him all
[1:12:58] things have become new there's no memory
[1:13:01] of a past sin there's no memory of those
[1:13:04] things that drag you down there there is
[1:13:05] therefore now Romans 81 there is
[1:13:07] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:13:09] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:13:11] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:13:13] what is it you are tabernacling deity
[1:13:15] you are new creature in Christ all
[1:13:17] things are becoming new wonderful you
[1:13:20] become a new person not just an old one
[1:13:22] patched up by joining church or trying
[1:13:24] to turn a new page but you're a complete
[1:13:26] brand new unit yeah right right we've
[1:13:30] had to do a lot of work on our on our AC
[1:13:33] units over the past few years and it
[1:13:36] seems like every time you put one you
[1:13:38] start patching it up eventually you're
[1:13:40] just going to have to replace
[1:13:42] it eventually that thing's going to have
[1:13:45] you're going to have so many parts in
[1:13:46] that thing you're going to have to just
[1:13:47] replace the whole thing because the
[1:13:49] shell of it even will rot away because
[1:13:51] everything made by man is disposed osble
[1:13:54] you know that's the case with your
[1:13:55] vehicle at some point all things need to
[1:13:58] be made
[1:14:00] new right there's only that right sister
[1:14:03] Alison there's only so many things you
[1:14:04] can do that old van to make
[1:14:06] it the kids have been in there for many
[1:14:09] miles and and things have happened in
[1:14:11] that van and there's only so many things
[1:14:13] you can do to make that
[1:14:14] new right at some point all things need
[1:14:17] to become new at some point you need to
[1:14:20] be a new creature in Christ you need to
[1:14:22] be you don't need to be the the product
[1:14:24] of your mother and father but you need
[1:14:26] to be a son or daughter of Jesus
[1:14:29] Christ all
[1:14:31] right brother brand says God takes the
[1:14:33] old man burns him completely out with
[1:14:36] the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes
[1:14:38] himself sends down your representation I
[1:14:41] love that takes the old man and burns
[1:14:44] him completely
[1:14:45] out before the ark could come into
[1:14:47] Solomon's Temple it had to be brought
[1:14:49] into David's prepared tent before the
[1:14:52] word can come incarnate in the
[1:14:54] Millennium he must return in his full
[1:14:56] power in this
[1:14:59] tent amen can can you see the type this
[1:15:02] morning he must brother said it couldn't
[1:15:04] happen through the to the denominations
[1:15:06] but it had to take place before the
[1:15:08] millennial age there had to be a people
[1:15:11] who could bring him back into their tent
[1:15:13] 1 Chronicles
[1:15:15] 15:2 look what David does now as he
[1:15:17] starts to bring the word back he
[1:15:19] realizes his error of the past David
[1:15:21] said none ought to carry the AR of God
[1:15:23] but the Levites they messed up by
[1:15:26] carrying on a new cart messed up by
[1:15:28] thinking that that technology could
[1:15:30] overcome and could do it for them God
[1:15:33] uses people he said no not to carry the
[1:15:36] Ark of God but the Levites for them ha
[1:15:37] the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God
[1:15:39] and to minister unto him forever sir he
[1:15:42] got a revelation that God only works
[1:15:44] through man how many believe that today
[1:15:46] yes you don't use the agency of any
[1:15:49] mechanical
[1:15:50] device but agency of man a man that
[1:15:53] surrendered and consecrated to
[1:15:56] God brother brandom had a prayer line he
[1:15:58] said he said may as they pass through
[1:16:00] this line we lay our hands upon them may
[1:16:01] they recognize it's just not going by
[1:16:02] man but God and man is one God has come
[1:16:06] into man God does nothing apart from man
[1:16:08] that's what he does his works is through
[1:16:09] man he made man his
[1:16:11] partner amen what did Jesus say in Luke
[1:16:14] chap 10 verse two he said them the
[1:16:16] Harvest truly is great but the laborers
[1:16:18] are few pray ye therefore the lord of
[1:16:20] the Harvest that he would send forth
[1:16:22] laborers into his har Harvest when he
[1:16:24] looked on the Harvest he was the lord of
[1:16:25] the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe
[1:16:27] the laborers are few pray the Lord of
[1:16:29] the Harvest he may send laborers into
[1:16:30] his Harvest making himself with man so
[1:16:32] bound together that he works only
[1:16:34] someone say only he works only through
[1:16:37] the agency of man he chose man to work
[1:16:40] for him he could have chose a son to
[1:16:42] preach the gospel he could have chose
[1:16:44] the winds or the trees or the stars but
[1:16:46] he chose man he veils himself inside yes
[1:16:50] he hides himself from the unbeliever but
[1:16:52] reveals himself self to who he will
[1:16:55] praise revealing himself to you
[1:16:57] today David prepared a place and guess
[1:17:00] what he did first Chronicles 15:3 now
[1:17:02] let's look at it he had to overcome his
[1:17:04] fear and go ahead and have a
[1:17:09] meeting that's right that's what he did
[1:17:11] and so many people want to preach part
[1:17:13] of this but let's preach all of it yeah
[1:17:16] David had to overcome his fear to go
[1:17:18] together go ahead and have a meeting
[1:17:20] yeah to bring up the Ark of the Lord
[1:17:22] into his place which she had prepared
[1:17:23] for and this time there was a place a
[1:17:27] prepared place for the word to rest and
[1:17:29] David assembled the children of Aaron
[1:17:31] and the Levites what what's he doing
[1:17:33] he's getting a bunch of preachers
[1:17:36] together but but preachers fail
[1:17:38] absolutely they do preachers have
[1:17:40] problems yes they're human beings
[1:17:43] preachers do have problems but there's
[1:17:45] got to be somebody there to fulfill the
[1:17:47] word to preach the
[1:17:48] word somebody's got to be there to
[1:17:51] preach it somebody's got to be there to
[1:17:52] believe it CU a preacher nothing without
[1:17:53] a
[1:17:54] congregation I'll be honest with you I
[1:17:56] wish that they had talk about Pastor
[1:17:58] appreciation I wish they had
[1:18:00] congregation appreciation day maybe we
[1:18:01] ought to have that congregation
[1:18:03] appreciation day I tell you what every
[1:18:05] Sunday is congregation appreciation
[1:18:09] day why because you all what would we be
[1:18:12] without somebody to listen right but
[1:18:14] God's got to have preachers too where do
[1:18:16] the preachers come from they come from
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:19] body right I hope we're raising up some
[1:18:21] of them right here preachers come from
[1:18:23] the body Preachers Wives come from the
[1:18:25] body deacons come from the body trustees
[1:18:28] come from the body God's raised them up
[1:18:30] right among us if he terries very much
[1:18:31] longer we got more coming on I'll say
[1:18:34] this we shouldn't be intimidated by the
[1:18:36] young people coming on and beginning to
[1:18:38] do things we shouldn't be intimidated by
[1:18:40] that at all we should welcome that
[1:18:42] because all of us eventually if we we
[1:18:44] live long enough we're going to pass off
[1:18:45] the
[1:18:46] scene and the young people have got to
[1:18:48] step up and take that burden somebody's
[1:18:51] got to pick it up and I want my kids to
[1:18:53] do a better job than I
[1:18:55] did I don't want them to do just as good
[1:18:57] as I did I want them to do better than I
[1:18:59] did I want them to carry less complexes
[1:19:02] I want them to have less
[1:19:03] scars I want to have a place where the
[1:19:05] word of God can be real for the people
[1:19:07] come on good good
[1:19:11] amen David's getting a bunch of
[1:19:13] preachers called for zadok and abiathar
[1:19:15] the priests and for the Levites for all
[1:19:18] of those names that are listed
[1:19:21] there even call
[1:19:26] Joel verse 12 and said unto them you are
[1:19:28] the chief of the fathers of the Levites
[1:19:31] sanctify
[1:19:32] yourselves sir Joel and all the other
[1:19:36] Levites sanctify
[1:19:40] yourselves I hope you're hearing me
[1:19:43] today both you and your brethren that
[1:19:46] you may bring up the Arc of the Lord God
[1:19:47] of Israel into the place that I have
[1:19:49] prepared for it before it can be
[1:19:51] delivered into your heart it's got to be
[1:19:52] carried over the hearts of the
[1:19:55] Levites and to do that it requires
[1:19:58] Sanctified hands and Sanctified
[1:20:01] Hearts he said for because you did not
[1:20:05] do it you did it not at the first the
[1:20:07] Lord Our God made a breach upon us for
[1:20:09] that we sought him not after the due
[1:20:11] order sir and and an innocent person
[1:20:14] died we went through that last week
[1:20:16] because they didn't do it right I say we
[1:20:18] must do it right it's not optional
[1:20:22] caring the word on the Ark of the
[1:20:23] Levites let me let me say this is not
[1:20:26] optional having a preacher in the church
[1:20:28] is not
[1:20:30] optional right having the preaching of
[1:20:34] the word in the church is not
[1:20:36] optional it must it it's required it's
[1:20:39] God's
[1:20:41] order yeah true because they didn't do
[1:20:44] it and and someone died so the priests
[1:20:47] and the Levites Sanctified themselves to
[1:20:49] bring up the Ark of the Lord God of
[1:20:50] Israel brother BR said God let let this
[1:20:52] sink deep in the hearts word of God has
[1:20:55] no right to be preached out of an Unholy
[1:20:57] mouth it should not be preached out of a
[1:20:59] mouth of a man that would say that Jesus
[1:21:00] Christ was once one thing and now
[1:21:02] something
[1:21:05] else I'm preaching at me now y'all like
[1:21:09] it when I preach at somebody pre I'm
[1:21:11] preaching at
[1:21:13] me you know I'm the only person I pick
[1:21:17] on well I pick on Joel a little bit I
[1:21:20] saw brother Bill looking at me when I
[1:21:21] said that
[1:21:24] I'm My Own Worst critic that's right I
[1:21:27] may say something I hurt you sometime I
[1:21:28] don't mean to I don't do that to
[1:21:30] liberally I got to preach I got to say
[1:21:32] what the word says I I don't want to
[1:21:35] ever do that because I'm saw something
[1:21:37] or something's going on I'm just picking
[1:21:39] at you if I if there's something that
[1:21:40] serious I'll talk to you about it I'll
[1:21:42] come to you and talk to you about it but
[1:21:44] I don't I don't want that to be what
[1:21:45] this Pulpit is where I just pick at
[1:21:47] people but I I I will pick on myself
[1:21:50] today because we I got to be
[1:21:54] Sanctified I got to make sure that the
[1:21:56] word is carried by Sanctified hands I
[1:21:58] got to take time to pray take time to
[1:22:00] seek the mind of the
[1:22:02] Lord listen he said it should not be
[1:22:04] preached out of a mouth of man that
[1:22:05] would say that Jesus Christ was once one
[1:22:07] thing and now something else it must be
[1:22:10] preached by a power of the Living God
[1:22:13] through Sanctified lips that's dedicated
[1:22:16] to the service of the Lord let these
[1:22:18] ashes the Waters of Separation be kept
[1:22:21] in a holy place he said no believer that
[1:22:23] ever takes on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:25] that ever confesses him as Savior should
[1:22:28] ever do anything in the world he's not
[1:22:29] saying you should never uh never go out
[1:22:31] in the world and have a job or anything
[1:22:33] like that that's not what he's saying
[1:22:34] but something that would be against the
[1:22:36] word if he does he should repent of it
[1:22:39] quickly because them words are the
[1:22:40] Waters of Separation listen we don't
[1:22:43] just carry the word you carry the word
[1:22:45] must be kept in a holy Place handled
[1:22:48] with Clean Hands yes he said no man has
[1:22:51] a right to preach the gospel without
[1:22:53] first being Sanctified from the cares
[1:22:55] and things of this
[1:22:57] world that's strong but it's true you
[1:22:59] can say am man it's all
[1:23:01] right I believe I've done that I there
[1:23:05] is therefore now no
[1:23:07] condemnation right but look listen if I
[1:23:10] ever get to where I don't carry it that
[1:23:11] way you need to tell me about it you've
[1:23:14] got a responsibility to make sure that
[1:23:16] the word you're being fed is not handled
[1:23:18] with unclean
[1:23:19] hands that's that's your responsibility
[1:23:23] it's important you do not want your
[1:23:25] children fed out of a out of a
[1:23:29] slop I've been in Africa and watched
[1:23:32] them I stood in Togo Africa or benine
[1:23:35] actually watched them after a meeting
[1:23:37] and they fed all the people and I didn't
[1:23:40] eat but they fed all the people we'd eat
[1:23:43] at night you eat once a day cuz just so
[1:23:45] hot and there's no facilities or
[1:23:47] anything it's just a wall you know so
[1:23:49] you just you don't want to eat so so I
[1:23:52] would thereare and there's a thousand
[1:23:54] people no restroom facilities no clean

[1:23:59] I'm looking and and here's a a line of
[1:24:00] children I go out outside of the wall

[1:24:04] building I walk outside there and here's
[1:24:05] a great big pot of rice and they take
[1:24:08] that rice and put it in a a little bowl
[1:24:10] or container and then those kids they
[1:24:12] scoop that up with their fingers well
[1:24:14] there's no place to wash them kids are
[1:24:17] immune from everything man they never
[1:24:20] got
[1:24:21] coid
[1:24:23] they're just immune from everything and
[1:24:25] they're just they're just scooping it up
[1:24:26] plus they didn't have television so
[1:24:29] they didn't know about it but they just
[1:24:31] scooping it up you know and and uh and

[1:25:19] dirty pot thought about that by the J
[1:25:23] I don't want my kids eating out at a
[1:25:25] church where the word is handled by
[1:25:27] dirty
[1:25:29] hands I don't want
[1:25:31] it I go listen church we have a
[1:25:34] responsib I'm not saying this to you
[1:25:36] because that's happening I'm saying this
[1:25:38] to you because we should never allow it
[1:25:40] to happen preachers we need to stay in
[1:25:43] Revival we need to stay before the Lord
[1:25:45] we need to grab a hold of the horns of
[1:25:47] the altar sanctify ourselves for the
[1:25:49] people's sake yeah
[1:25:53] that's good no man has a right to preach
[1:25:55] without first being
[1:25:56] Sanctified John 17:19 for their sakes I
[1:25:59] sanctify myself they also might be
[1:26:01] Sanctified through the truth brother
[1:26:02] Bram said some of the most precious
[1:26:04] words in scripture is when Jesus said
[1:26:07] for their sakes yeah he told a story
[1:26:11] about a man who had a church that was
[1:26:13] lean legalist and he said there was
[1:26:15] something he didn't say what it was he
[1:26:16] said something they wouldn't allow that
[1:26:17] that would be fine to do but they didn't
[1:26:19] that church didn't believe in it and he
[1:26:21] said the pastor of that church come to
[1:26:22] him he said he said brother he said you
[1:26:24] I see you don't do that he said well he
[1:26:26] said my church doesn't do that he said I
[1:26:28] believe it would be okay he said but
[1:26:29] they don't do that he said so I sanctify
[1:26:31] myself for them brother Brandon said he
[1:26:33] wanted to grab them and hug
[1:26:35] them he said that's the way you preach
[1:26:37] that's the way you do
[1:26:38] ministry you sanctify yourself for the
[1:26:40] church you sanctify yourself for the
[1:26:43] people and listen if we're not willing
[1:26:46] to do that we shouldn't be
[1:26:48] preaching boy got quiet and it got hard
[1:26:51] but it's true
[1:26:52] I'm preaching at
[1:26:54] myself within reason right we don't need
[1:26:57] to make our we don't need to let every
[1:26:59] little every little legalists run around
[1:27:01] run the church that's not what I'm
[1:27:02] talking about but I'm talking about with
[1:27:05] the body of Believers there's something
[1:27:06] we know would bring a stumbling block
[1:27:08] let's just let's just not do
[1:27:11] it other words he had a right but Joel
[1:27:14] gets to follow this up tonight praise
[1:27:18] God brother brand said he had a right he
[1:27:20] was a man he had a right to a home he
[1:27:22] had a right to a family he was as much
[1:27:23] man as you are or I am as much human in
[1:27:25] his manhood as we are he had a right to
[1:27:27] it but he was training 12 men that was
[1:27:29] going to take the gospel to all the
[1:27:30] world so he Sanctified himself for their
[1:27:33] sake I sanctify myself for their sake
[1:27:36] there's a lot of things I do as a pastor
[1:27:38] I wouldn't have to do but I try to
[1:27:40] sanctify myself for your sake are you
[1:27:42] with me now but shouldn't we do that for
[1:27:44] the world listen as we just lived I'm
[1:27:47] going Beyond preachers now the BR said
[1:27:49] oh gifts of God you people who claim
[1:27:52] that you've received his Spirit keep
[1:27:54] yourself
[1:27:55] Sanctified keep away from the things of
[1:27:57] the world be Sanctified why you're a
[1:28:00] gift of God to the world you don't know
[1:28:03] who might be relying on your word you
[1:28:05] don't know who might make it to Heaven
[1:28:07] because you were nice to them yes come
[1:28:09] on oh come on Church there will be a
[1:28:11] great number the Bible says a number no
[1:28:13] man can number that pass through Great
[1:28:15] Tribulation that were not a part of the
[1:28:17] Bride but they they saw something about
[1:28:19] you that was real they saw something
[1:28:21] they your Sanctified life and they say
[1:28:23] oh God we need to preach sanctification
[1:28:25] again in the house of God we need to
[1:28:27] preach Holiness again in the house of
[1:28:28] God because they see the way you live
[1:28:30] and they see that there's something
[1:28:32] there they care about me they care about
[1:28:35] the church they care about the
[1:28:37] world it ought to be in our
[1:28:40] midst I don't know it's quiet but I
[1:28:42] think it ought it does US good you know
[1:28:45] it can't always just preach things that
[1:28:46] everybody agrees
[1:28:51] with
[1:28:52] sometimes you got to get down where we
[1:28:54] live or there's no it don't help
[1:28:57] us you know we like my kids like it when
[1:29:01] they go back to school and it's the same
[1:29:03] stuff that's told me that's the same
[1:29:05] stuff I had last year man I can speed
[1:29:06] through that don't even have to listen
[1:29:08] but when it's something new that's tough
[1:29:10] isn't
[1:29:11] it huh it's a it's one of them learning
[1:29:13] grades I don't know if that even exists
[1:29:14] but the Justin but that's supposedly my
[1:29:16] kids told me so some grades are easy I
[1:29:18] didn't go to school so but only
[1:29:20] part-time but my kids tell me that there
[1:29:22] some grades are easier than others you
[1:29:24] know and and uh at least kind of a
[1:29:27] repeat grade review grade and I keep
[1:29:30] thinking about that and thinking God I
[1:29:31] can't just keep repeating third grade
[1:29:33] like I did in real life you know
[1:29:36] I it's the best 10 years of my
[1:29:40] life but I that wasn't that
[1:29:44] long I can't keep repeating the same
[1:29:47] grade as a Christian I need to move
[1:29:49] forward what don't you want the Ark of
[1:29:51] God to move forward forward let's move
[1:29:53] forward we don't want to just keep
[1:29:54] repeating the same stuff let's move
[1:29:55] forward let's see what God has for us in
[1:29:57] this day let's sanctify ourselves for
[1:30:00] our neighbor sake yeah 1 Chronicles
[1:30:02] 15:15 says and the children of the
[1:30:04] Levites bear the Ark of God upon their
[1:30:06] shoulders with the staves there on as
[1:30:08] Moses commanded according to the word of
[1:30:10] the Lord and David spake to the chief of
[1:30:12] the Levites to appoint their Brethren to
[1:30:14] be the singers with instruments of music
[1:30:16] sultes and harps and symbols sounding by
[1:30:20] lifting up the voice yeah
[1:30:23] oh my with joy sir that's what brother
[1:30:26] BR said about them cows that were coming
[1:30:28] back with the Ark on it he said they
[1:30:30] were not moaning he said they were Lo
[1:30:32] they were singing yeah with joy why
[1:30:35] because they were bringing back the ark
[1:30:37] and now the ark wasn't going to be
[1:30:39] carried by cows it wasn't going to be
[1:30:40] carried on a new ark it was going to be
[1:30:42] carried under the shoulders of the
[1:30:44] Levites yes sir and so they come with
[1:30:46] joy lifting up the voice with joy now
[1:30:49] David was a musician but he was going to
[1:30:51] have others play in this meeting CU he
[1:30:53] was going to lead the procession he had
[1:30:55] some work to do so David then being a
[1:30:58] musician he he he made all sure all this
[1:31:00] was right he ordered the chiefs of the
[1:31:02] Levites to appoint their brothers as
[1:31:03] singers with instruments of song musical
[1:31:08] instruments musical in I don't want to
[1:31:10] break your tradition but musical
[1:31:12] instruments stringed
[1:31:15] instruments and
[1:31:19] symbols you know what symbols are
[1:31:24] that in digital
[1:31:28] form I you can't hardly here he turn
[1:31:31] them things
[1:31:32] up
[1:31:35] symbols right that's what a symbol is
[1:31:37] for those of you who didn't know it's
[1:31:43] drums say in the house of God well when
[1:31:46] the word comes back yeah come
[1:31:49] on Amen David uses the equivalent of
[1:31:53] fiddles sister Millenia is not here this
[1:31:57] morning but she said I play a violin not
[1:31:58] a
[1:32:00] fiddle but David used the equivalent of
[1:32:02] violins or fiddles guitars and
[1:32:06] drums that's right that's right look at
[1:32:08] the verse 17 so the Levites appointed
[1:32:10] hean the son of hean the son of
[1:32:13] Joel that's pretty good right
[1:32:16] there I don't know which one of you that
[1:32:18] is
[1:32:19] but of his Brethren as the son of bariah
[1:32:22] and the sons of marari their Brethren
[1:32:24] Ethan Ethan the son of kayah with them
[1:32:26] their Brethren of the second degree Zach
[1:32:28] see they weren't all on the same level
[1:32:29] you had starting musicians and backups
[1:32:32] and that's
[1:32:34] okay I said God if if you want me to
[1:32:36] clean the if you want me to clean the
[1:32:38] sanctuary let me be willing to do
[1:32:40] it let me be willing to do it I may be a
[1:32:43] backup listen I realize I I play an
[1:32:45] instrument I play the guitar and I don't

[1:32:56] help me to do to put be diligent about
[1:32:58] and do my best but if I'm not needed

[1:33:02] somebody
[1:33:04] better by the way we need a guitar
[1:33:06] player if anybody's
[1:33:08] interested but if there's you know we we
[1:33:11] shouldn't let I'll say this if we have a
[1:33:13] talent we shouldn't hide it let God use
[1:33:16] it if it' be a blessing to the people of
[1:33:18] God but but if it's whatever it is
[1:33:21] there's all always going to be people
[1:33:22] who are starting people who are second
[1:33:24] degree people who are third degree
[1:33:27] people who are like me who right at the
[1:33:28] very last of the last of the list of

[1:34:57] next verse used the word shth is musical
[1:34:59] terms so then he the next group of them
[1:35:01] he play with harps on shim that's a
[1:35:03] musical term it's been lost to us but
[1:35:05] they were playing different
[1:35:06] parts chin and I chief of the Levites
[1:35:08] was for song oh they had a song leader
[1:35:11] too he was instructed about the song
[1:35:14] because he was skillful and I think
[1:35:17] sometimes we look with suspicion on
[1:35:18] somebody that's skillful at something I
[1:35:20] say we shouldn't do that we should let
[1:35:22] them be skillful but don't let it go to
[1:35:24] your
[1:35:25] head I'll say this this chin and I was a
[1:35:27] regular Colby Martin he was skillful he
[1:35:31] could play he could sing and bariah and
[1:35:35] elen were doorkeepers for the ark that's
[1:35:37] some deacons there too praise God some
[1:35:40] ushers amen 1st Chronicles 15:24 and
[1:35:43] Shaniah and Jehoshaphat nethanel and all
[1:35:45] the others the priest did blow with the
[1:35:47] trumpets before the Ark of God and Obed
[1:35:50] obededom and were doorkeepers for the
[1:35:52] ark what A noise they must have
[1:35:55] made maybe not the doorkeepers but
[1:35:57] everybody else ver Chronicles 15:25 so
[1:36:00] David and the Elders of Israel and the
[1:36:02] captains over thousands went to bring up
[1:36:04] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out
[1:36:06] of the house of obededom with what Joy
[1:36:08] with joy yeah with joy and now they can
[1:36:12] have real Joy before it was just a
[1:36:13] denominational Revival before they
[1:36:16] played and they sang in the same way and
[1:36:17] played with all their might and all of
[1:36:18] that and danced before the Lord but it
[1:36:20] wasn't right because the word had not
[1:36:21] been restored but we live in a day when
[1:36:23] there's a place prepared for the word
[1:36:25] when the word has been restored let's

[1:39:52] I know that's an Affliction in our day
[1:39:53] and age yeah I hate sometimes even
[1:39:55] talking about the news because when it
[1:39:57] comes up people get
[1:39:58] nervous such an Affliction in our day he
[1:40:01] said the calmness of my nerves comes
[1:40:03] from God when I'm tore up I find my
[1:40:06] satisfaction in Christ not in a
[1:40:08] cigarette none of the things of the
[1:40:09] world not in joining some Creed but in
[1:40:11] finding him the promised word he said if
[1:40:13] I go away I'll come again to receive you
[1:40:16] I find my joy in that he is my joy how
[1:40:20] many can say Amen to that today I find
[1:40:22] my joy in him the full word has
[1:40:25] returned oh my there's joy back in the
[1:40:28] house of God again hallelujah oh we
[1:40:31] ought to worship God for that there's
[1:40:33] joy back in the house of God we don't
[1:40:35] have to serve God under drudgery we're
[1:40:37] not serving under slavery we're serving
[1:40:39] under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:43] hallelujah
[1:40:45] amen that's good Hallelujah verse 26 it
[1:40:50] came to pass when God helped the Levites
[1:40:52] to Bear the Ark of the Covenant I love
[1:40:53] that when God helped them I say God help
[1:40:55] me when I preach God help me when I
[1:40:57] carry the word he said when God helped
[1:41:00] them that they offered a sacrifice and
[1:41:03] David was clothed with a robe of fine
[1:41:04] linen and all the Levites said bear the
[1:41:06] ark and the singers and chinah the song
[1:41:08] leader with the singers David also had
[1:41:10] upon him an ought of linen he put on a
[1:41:12] put a suit on him I'm going go I'm gonna
[1:41:14] pass
[1:41:18] on that's all Isel brother Allan's not
[1:41:21] here this morning so brother Allen he
[1:41:24] said he put EOD on him brother Allan's
[1:41:26] going to come up here with a linen shirt
[1:41:29] on so thus all Israel brought up the Ark
[1:41:31] of the Covenant of the Lord with
[1:41:34] what shouting did God judge them for
[1:41:38] that did did an innocent person die no
[1:41:42] because they carried the Arc of the word
[1:41:44] right you see what it is it wasn't in
[1:41:46] the shouting it wasn't that was just a
[1:41:48] reaction to the word being brought up
[1:41:50] that was all okay but the problem was
[1:41:52] how they did
[1:41:54] it and there is no substitute for the
[1:41:57] word right I don't care how good a man
[1:42:00] is how long you've known him how
[1:42:01] wonderful a Ministry he has if he gets
[1:42:03] off the word he's off the word that's
[1:42:05] all there is to it God help us today
[1:42:08] because there's good men sometimes get
[1:42:10] off the word but we must stay with the
[1:42:11] word because that's how we can worship
[1:42:14] with without
[1:42:15] condemnation that's how we can love God
[1:42:17] with all of our heart brother brandom
[1:42:19] talks about kids p ing notes in church
[1:42:22] ain't been none of that going on on this
[1:42:24] front row my goodness these kids are
[1:42:25] good this
[1:42:26] morning brother brand talks about the
[1:42:28] kids doing that you know they pass notes
[1:42:31] some of y'all would have to move to pass
[1:42:34] notes but brother brandom talked about
[1:42:37] that how that made noise in the church
[1:42:38] and how that should be stopped but he
[1:42:39] said this he said of course somebody
[1:42:40] worshiping the Lord that's
[1:42:45] expected that's where it should be
[1:42:48] that's what you're here for is to
[1:42:49] Worship the Lord that don't disrupt the
[1:42:51] service on that's right amen he said
[1:42:55] just if you feel like praising God or
[1:42:56] shouting he said just go right on see
[1:42:59] cuz that's what you're here for is to
[1:43:01] Worship the Lord in your own way of
[1:43:03] worshiping everybody's got their own way
[1:43:05] of worshiping we don't condemn you if
[1:43:07] you sit there and smile we don't condemn
[1:43:09] you if you shout and run the aisles but
[1:43:10] we just want you to worship God how
[1:43:12] according to the way you worship just
[1:43:15] make sure you're worshiping
[1:43:17] God wonderful and don't despise others
[1:43:19] look what happens in verse 29 I know
[1:43:21] I've gone just a little bit over my time
[1:43:22] but I'm almost
[1:43:23] done verse 29 it came to pass as the Ark
[1:43:26] of the Covenant of the Lord came to the
[1:43:27] city of David Michael the daughter saw
[1:43:30] looking out a window saw King David
[1:43:32] dancing and playing well number number
[1:43:34] one why was she watching the stream and
[1:43:36] not at
[1:43:43] church she's like I don't feel nothing
[1:43:46] well you weren't
[1:43:47] there
[1:43:49] yeah
[1:43:51] there's a story behind that I texted
[1:43:53] somebody was sitting on the platform one
[1:43:56] recently and he was laughing I texted
[1:43:58] him because somebody I knew I wasn't at
[1:43:59] church I was sitting at home I texted
[1:44:02] him I said what what's so funny you
[1:44:04] responded back you'd have to be
[1:44:06] here he was
[1:44:10] right she she gets on Facebook you know
[1:44:13] watches the stream like ah look at that
[1:44:17] Bunch got be careful who we despise
[1:44:21] amen yeah she despised him in her
[1:44:24] heart you know David didn't always dance
[1:44:28] you know
[1:44:29] that the one time he was so so consumed
[1:44:34] by the loss of his family you remember
[1:44:35] the story that he he fell down on his
[1:44:38] knees to the earth and the people were
[1:44:40] going to Stone him but then the Bible
[1:44:42] says he encouraged himself in the Lord
[1:44:44] no mention of him dancing he just I like
[1:44:47] to think that David just started just
[1:44:49] started singing the Psalms he wrote and
[1:44:51] sometimes the way David encouraged
[1:44:53] himself was not with not with a bunch of
[1:44:55] upbeat numbers he had to he had to he
[1:44:58] had to seeing something that meant
[1:44:59] something I've been through trials but I
[1:45:02] know you're still my God I've seen the
[1:45:04] valley but I know you're the god of The
[1:45:06] Valleys in the
[1:45:07] mountains begin to encourage himself in
[1:45:09] the Lord David didn't always dance
[1:45:11] sometimes he cried go read the Psalms
[1:45:14] sometimes he meditated he said I
[1:45:15] meditated in the night watches on the
[1:45:18] word but on this occasion he
[1:45:21] danced why he danced because the word
[1:45:24] was being restored to its proper
[1:45:26] place oh brother brand said you say I I
[1:45:29] can't see those things I don't believe
[1:45:30] in shouting I don't believe in speaking
[1:45:32] tongues I don't believe in Divine
[1:45:33] Healing he said it shows you never got
[1:45:34] the victory right that's right but one
[1:45:36] time you get the victory then you got it
[1:45:37] then you have it he said yes sir then
[1:45:39] you can shout yeah you see one time I
[1:45:41] used to think about dancing in the
[1:45:42] spirit see somebody stand and dance in
[1:45:43] the spirit he said now I've seen the
[1:45:44] mockery put on of it but I've seen the
[1:45:46] real thing too so I come to find out why
[1:45:49] could people dance in the spirit well he
[1:45:51] said I've never seen one yet get out of
[1:45:52] the way see that was dancing in the
[1:45:54] spirit he said he saw the mockery of it
[1:45:57] he said I've never seen one in the
[1:45:58] spirit yet get out of the way never seen
[1:46:00] one yet act immorally I'll say this the
[1:46:02] spirit of God will not act
[1:46:04] immorally said I always see it just as
[1:46:06] decently and in order and sweetness even
[1:46:08] Sinners run to the Altar and get saved
[1:46:10] when it's going on you said well I
[1:46:11] wondered why it was I come to find out
[1:46:13] it's victory David danced before the
[1:46:15] Lord when the ark was brought back to
[1:46:17] its resting place hey man I want him to
[1:46:19] rest in me don't you
[1:46:21] when David brought the ark back he said
[1:46:23] David rejoiced and danced in the spirit
[1:46:25] around and around and why he saw the
[1:46:27] word back in his place yes what the word
[1:46:29] needs he said it's not out of some
[1:46:30] Seminary some theological mixup but an
[1:46:32] oldfashioned God sent preacher behind
[1:46:34] the pulpit with the word seeing God
[1:46:36] vindicate proof he said then David said
[1:46:38] glory to God this is it when did he
[1:46:41] dance he danced when the word came back
[1:46:43] when the preaching was going on yeah
[1:46:46] that'll be my pet Doctrine that's a time
[1:46:48] to dance but there's a time to dance
[1:46:50] there was music there too they had that
[1:46:52] but there was a word being restored
[1:46:54] that's why he was dancing he's said
[1:46:56] around and around and around and around
[1:46:57] his little stuck up wife set up there
[1:46:59] being the King's Daughter said why he
[1:47:00] embarrasses me and David said you don't
[1:47:02] like that watch this round and around he
[1:47:05] went again oh my what a time he had you
[1:47:07] know God looked down out of heaven and
[1:47:09] David you're a man after my own heart
[1:47:11] why he had done lost all his pride he
[1:47:13] said yet he was married to a king's
[1:47:15] daughter but that wasn't even considered
[1:47:16] then he knew he was acquainted with the
[1:47:18] possessor of heavens and earth and here
[1:47:20] was the word of God coming right back
[1:47:21] among them again and David was so happy
[1:47:23] he danced he just danced as hard as he
[1:47:26] could Maryam she grabbed the tambourine
[1:47:28] went down the bank dancing on the other
[1:47:29] side after she'd come to the Red Sea and
[1:47:31] seen her enemies drowned she could dance
[1:47:33] in the spirit when she seen the enemies
[1:47:35] that had tormented her dead then she
[1:47:37] danced in the spirit that's right he
[1:47:39] said see after after the battle's won
[1:47:41] then the glory of God comes down we
[1:47:43] fight a battle during the preaching of
[1:47:45] the word but when we get to the end of
[1:47:47] the service that's the time to worship
[1:47:50] we fought the Battle and won the victory
[1:47:52] I trust you've won the victory today
[1:47:54] just by sitting here some of you won the
[1:47:55] victory over tiredness you won the
[1:47:57] victory over disease you've won the
[1:47:59] victory over o over complexes and things
[1:48:01] just to sit here listen to the word if
[1:48:03] you've won the victory now it's the time
[1:48:05] to worship God with all of your heart
[1:48:07] when I see the open book musicians go
[1:48:09] ahead and come when I see the open book
[1:48:10] when I see the word in its place I can
