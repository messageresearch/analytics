bless you it's good to be with you this evening it's good to be back in the pulpit I been through a battle but we know our God is already won the victory for us and I want to turn to 1st Samuel Chapter 17 tonight it will read the first 10 verses for the Adam it's good to see you tonight buddy I've always been close with Adam and sister Becky and I appreciate them being here tonight and and I know several that couldn't be here tonight and there's some even that their employers are putting pressure on them to not be gather with a group of people but we know that God still God wherever you're at tonight and if you're watching or listening God still able to move don't don't sell him short his arm is not short he's able to reach us because the word as we said is powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword 1st Samuel chapter 17 and verse 1 I'd like to speak to you tonight on the challenge of a lifetime now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and we're gathered together at Shoko which belongeth to Judah and pitched between shoukata syke and FS the mean and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the Valley of Elah and set the battle in array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them went out of champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a span and had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed a coat of mail the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass he had Greaves of brass upon his legs a target of brass between his shoulders the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and a Spears head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried into the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set battle in a ray I'm not I have Philistine and he's servants to Saul choose you a man for you let him come down to me if he'd be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servants i prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us and the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together I pray the Lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening generations are defined but the challenges they face my late grandfather was born in 1923 and his peers he and his peers are called the greatest generation the reason why we call them that is because they faced impossible odds and they won and today we look at that those battles that they went through and in the Second World War in particular and we see how that they fought it we see Hitler has become almost a caricature a cartoon character and we see that the fight that they went through but we see it as an accomplished thing so we don't recognize but they did have to fight and many of them did have to die and many of them faced impossible odds and the ones who were there on the beaches of Normandy knew that the battle was real it wasn't made up it wasn't something that it was a real battle it was something that they would be in the fight of their lives the challenge of a lifetime they want it they overcome it it was an existential threat something that would take them out it was either us or them and and and so we even caused an atomic bomb to be dropped on Japan because it was us or them we look back at that now and think why did we have to do that but the choice was between life and death there were there was nothing else to do and this was the kind of challenge that David and the Israelites faced as he stood there it was a challenge between being a slave and being free between being alive or dead and I want to present to you tonight and just from my heart because I've gotten a couple weeks rest as you know but you know we've been through it and but but this battle that we face and I'm not speaking particular particularly of the coronavirus though that's part of it but the battle that we face in 2020 the battle that we that we face today it's the battle of our lifetime this is what we become known for how we approach and how we overcome and how we fight today is what we become known for and someday you'll be able to look back and see I was I was in the battle of 2020 I fought on those beaches I was there and I overcame by the blood of the lamb in the word of my testimony and so we can know that this is the kind of battle that we face today the Battle of Laodicea it's not a battle of well you can take it or leave it but you got to fight and you got to be willing to face those impossible odds and believe that you're able to win this was the nature of the challenge that David faced it was an absolute threat to their existence he says if I overpower him and kill him then you will be her slaves if I win you become our safes I'm trying not to get too wound up tonight but I'm pretty wound up I'm not very old but in my lifetime in the message we face many challenges I've seen doctrines come and go I've seen preachers rise and fall I've seen people come and go see men that I never thought would fall fall I've seen when that I always thought would serve God not serve God anymore and if you're older than I am today you've probably seen a lot more we've seen battles before but not like this and I'm speaking of the entirety of what we're going through today we've seen great preachers come and great preachers go we've seen churches rise and fall this is different because the nature of this challenge is personal as Goliath said choose a man the children of Israel I think it's interesting that they were perfectly willing to fight with Saul they were perfectly willing to to go with him and and fight Philistines together as a unit they went if you go back and look in the scripture and I didn't get it because I wanted to say focused on what I'm speaking about tonight but you can go back and look in the scripture and find that over and over again they defeated the Philistines the same through steam army in fact the Bible tells us that and you can if you're writing it down in 1st Samuel 1447 that wherever saul turned he vexed the Philistines that he actually fought them and overcame them over and over and over again and here they come again and I think they understood there was something there's something about the enemy that knows when the children of God are going through a hard time because now Saul had back Sid and he wasn't worried was supposed to be and he had not done what God told him to do and so now that same re that had been victorious over and over again but Joe now they become weak and he always comes in that weakened weakening time and tries to fight against the people of God but if they just hung together if they were just fighting together they could have still won I mean there's a reason why the Philistines didn't want to fight him as a whole because they'd already been beaten by a bunch of times they'd whooped them up one side and down the other so now they're they don't want to fight Nadezhda anymore so they said choose out a man that's the kind of battle we face today but then we face a personal battle Satan's out to get you he's out to get me he comes personally to you and tries to get you separated from your identity in the Bride of Christ and and tries to come directly to you and and challenge you as a believer and you've got to respond to that I have to respond to that so Goliath had been in the Philistine army the whole time the Bible says he's a man of war from his youth he was he was probably in those battles he probably fought Saul before in fact the Jews say that that he was there when the Ark of the Covenant was taken from the sons of Eli and they were killed they said a Goliath was there he was the one that did that he was a man of war from his youth now Satan's tactics had changed and his tactic now is to make each man speak for himself and it's Satan's strategy to divide and conquer us when Julius Caesar went into fight in Gaul a lot of people mistakenly think that the Roman army was just unbeatable but there's a reason why they did they always changed the odds they always beat everybody because they never fought everybody at wants so what they did is they went into going he they realized that they had many less fewer soldiers and were much weaker than the armies of God the armies of goers flit up and so what they would do is they would go in and Julius Caesar would go in and he would bribe one tribe and fight the other one and and then he bribed this one over here and fight this one and he did it over and over again till there were no tribes left he couldn't have faced all of them so he used to carrot and a stick he'd take this one and draw them in saying will make you citizens we'll do all these things all these promises needed fight over here and then when he beat these eternal and fought against feasts that he just had just given the assurances - he could not beat them as a whole so he devised the strategy to fight them one at a time and it worked we're all world for a thousand years because not because they were stronger but because they divided so they could conquer number the Bible says in the church age book he said now watch this carefully what did political pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered that was the seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth tore and devoured whom she tore and devoured could not rise again that's when she destroyed Carthage and so did assault he said the same iron seed remained in her when she arose it's the false church and her policies remain the same divide and conquer he said that is declared an ism and God hates it see what they would do is they would identify a chief and make him jealous of all the other chiefs and then they would put him they would divide him off from the rest of the people and then he would turn himself against his own and the Romans weren't his friends don't you see this the same thing the devil does today if he can get us to fight one another he don't have to do much work you don't have to defeat us and as brother Darrell Ward is quoted before but I think it bears quoting when Geronimo was where they were fighting against one another than the Indians and Geronimo said there's too few of us to fight one another there's not enough of us left to fight one another we're too few and so it's the same concept that the u.s. used against the American Indians as long as we can keep them tribal we can defeat them but see my enemy is your enemy David's enemy was Saul's enemy and Saul thought David was his enemy but it wasn't David that was an enemy was Goliath it was the Philistines they had a mutual enemy but the what Satan does is tries to divide us as much as he can and so again he names something in first Shane was 17 and 8 he stood in crying of the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in array not I have Philistines who he identifies who he is he said in ye servants to salt now they weren't servants of salt they were servants of God they weren't servants of Saul they were children of God how long is her identity was children of God they could fight together they could fight but he identifies them as the servants of Saul he said choose a man for you let him come down to me and the reason why it does that is he because if he can get you to put your entire confidence in a man in one single man or I'll help you hear me tonight because it's it's rampant today even and the message that people promote a man and then when you promote a man to a certain place and then that man becomes your salvation that man becomes it and so when he identifies services so if if Saul wouldn't come out and fight him then how could his service fight him if Saul got defeated then the service were defeated you understand why he does what he does for the marcelles mechanism to divide and conquer if you can defeat this man then you've got the people defeated because the people can't fight on their own Oh help us Lord choose your man he says let him come down see Satan did that to Adam and Eve he never tried to get them together but he waited to issue his challenge until evil us alone so it was an individual challenge it was also a challenge to bring fear and if there ever was a time when we're fighting fears today this is the hour when Satan brings fear in the minds of the people and you felt it you know what it's like I felt it when you sit there and I sit there on my first couple of nights and you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know what's going to take places so you're just sitting there about three weeks to go I'm sitting there I'm running this fever and I'm I'm getting sick and when got tested and I found out they had coronavirus and it's like a fear that gets on you like if someone told you you had cancer and for me and I'm not downplaying anyone else the symptoms kiss up for some people is much worse but for me it was like catching a bad cold but the fear of it was different the fear of it was something else and I actually was up all night you know praying that it didn't give it to anybody else and couldn't sleep because I knew that if I was sick and God moved marvelous settled I don't think we realized how much God has helped us that we were able to have church tonight we were able to were able to get together because God just intervened on our behalf to be able to do that but see this was this is glass ambition he never wanted to fight he never had any intention of fighting his armor was so heavy probably couldn't have fought much anyway a real good soldier looking to go ahead and think wait a minute you can't hardly move follow that iron and brass there was a valley between women and in the middle of the Valley of Elah there's a brook or like a ravine and which David went down into Goliath couldn't have even crossed it to get to him David had to go find him so he couldn't even but his idea was to bring fear to be so big and so massive that they were just power to him to get each and every one of them to stay home from the battle and he did it for 40 days the Philistine is censored for fame in 1716 that the Philistine drew near morning and evening every day he presented himself morning and evening he never let them forget that they were he was making this challenge every day every morning every evening when they woke up in the morning to ruin their in the evening to ruin their sleep every morning he made its challenge every evening he made his challenge you know I think you'd do us good and I I have a bad habit of this too you get up in the morning you read the news before you go to bed you read the news I think we ought to read the Bible and get some encouragement in the morning in the evening because glassmaking a boast he's making up he's challenging us today and he draws near morning and evening and presents himself he presented himself 40 days now brother Branham says that three is God's number in his numerology God is known by his numbers three is perfection 7 is worship 24 is worship he said 40 is temptation 50 is pinnacles Fortius temptation Jesus was in the wilderness for 40 days Elijah was as well rain fell for 40 days and 40 nights joshua spied out the land for 40 days there was a time forty is a signal or a type of the time that it takes to be tempted to be tested and to decide what you're going to do it's a set period it also represents judgment I'm so glad of that because there is an end and I want us to understand that tonight that there is an end there is an in my wife and kids sitting at home wondering if they'll ever be an end to the quarantine but there is an end there's a set number of days there's a set time it will come to an end listen we're only here for a short time we're only here life it's like a vapor in it it appears for a little while and then it goes this is our testing time this is the challenge of our lifetime this is what we have to face this is what we're up against then but it's only for a time and we even go through periods of our life there's periods of temptation but God is showing us by these 40 sets or dove days for this period of 40 days yes it does come to an end it's long it's not just a day or two it's not just an hour - but it does come to an end hey man you will not tempt you beyond overcoming ability I hope you're hearing me tonight you know we didn't know we could overcome what we've overcome until we did it David believed that he could overcome Goliath but when he overcame when he come out on the other side of the valley had Goliath had in his hand he knew hey bet he knew them that he can overcome he knew then that it was this big and giant as they said it was he knew then that it wasn't as big it would not be the thing that took him out of this life he believed before but now he knew his brother Adam preached I have heard but now I see now I see the reality of it there will come a set time there will come a period when we can reach the other end of the battle we look back and say I know that God moves for me in 2020 I know that God protected me in 2020 I know God kept me I know whatever it was that I had to go through it was a set period of time and it was over amen for Samuel 1711 let's look at the sphere that's coming on Saul in the children of Israel and so on all Israel heard these words those words of the Philistine they were dismayed greatly afraid and all the men of Istra when they saw the men fled from him and were sore afraid listen as we said he identified them in Saul's army and then he caused fear to strike so when he did he caused him to lose confidence in their ability to fight Oh they lost their confidence because they looked at this man and said this man failed so now we must fail but God didn't put his confidence in the arm of flesh he said he said even in the scripture that a man who has confidence in the arm of flesh it's like a heath in the desert he's like a tumbleweed that blows across the desert but a man has got his confidence in God it's like a tree planted by the rivers of water and so he identifies them assaults armed he comes to him to put their confidence in soul and then they lost because their champion the one who was hidden so shoulders above the rest was also afraid and he was a human being too and he was backside to boot now it's strange as I said that they didn't just keep fighting why not just ignore Goliath because you've beaten them before why not just fight glass couldn't have overcome the whole army but see it was Satan's fear tactics now the natural order of things and think with me about this for a moment the natural order of things was that the Israelites were the possessors of the land so God tells Joshua he said go be of good courage he said take courage be strong be very courageous I've given you the land he said every place that the sole of your foot tribes on he said that's yours so they they took the land they were on the offensive when Saul was first crowned King they went on the offensive they went into battle against the Philistines against the ammonites against the Moabites against all the different people they would stood him on every side bow and Saul back said what happened they become defensive and when they become defensive they didn't keep fighting but they just sit back in the camp too scared to fight see the natural order of things was for them to fight not for Goliath to be making the challenge but for them to be making a challenge to Goliath see had they faithfully observed the conditions that they had been given every time a new enemy had trespassed upon their borders they would have gone out against him in aggression that is the work of God's people excuse me I got something in my eyes it's what it is this is an sanitizer but that's an that some preachers didn't have to face a long time ago for the Harvey that's a new thing but aggression on the foes of God a man is the work of God's people that's our work and so when the natural order is reversed and when God's people are not aggressive when they are not on the offensive then they tremble at the aggressive on thoughts of their flow that should be our attitude towards evil are you here mate and I Church our attitude towards sin or how did you towards the enemies should never be defensive I'm sick and tired of sitting back and waiting to see what the devil does I'm tired of sitting back and waiting to see what the devil does to them to message people I'm tired of waiting to see what the devil does to my family I'm tired of waiting to see what the devil does put yourself there you're tired of waiting and seeing what the devil does and just reacting to everything the devil does in your life there's got to come a point where you step up and say hey I want to fight you say well there's nothing I can do I don't know the thing to do and I'm taking all these all these precautions and we should and we will continue to take every precaution that we can to keep everybody safe for listen it's time we went on the offensive it's time we quit just reacting to everything that was going on and went on the offensive how do we do that we do that because we can pray we serve an Almighty God we serve a God who's able we serve a God when I I'm shut in the house by myself there's nothing else I can do but pray I like to be able to reach out and touch people and shake their hand put my home run home but there's nothing else I can do but pray but it's probably the best way I can spend my time anyway are you now it's probably the best thing that we could do anyway is to pray and so the aggressive the aggressive the the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much we could say the aggressive prayer the prayer Lord as jay-bez says Lord and hurts my territory he was being aggressive he say Lord I don't want what somebody else has I don't want their land but I want everything that's mine I don't want to leave one stone unturned if there's something that's mine I wanted if healing is mine I wanted if salvation is mine I want it I know this is a little different tonight but I've been shut up for a couple weeks so if we do not make aggressive war against the enemy and we fight a spiritual enemy we will fight against flesh and blood we fight spiritual wickedness in high places we fight with spiritual weapons if we do not make war Satan will come in whenever you see what did David do when he made his mistake of Bathsheba it's because he did not make war against the enemy and if there's something the devil's trying to get us to do today is just to sit back and take it sit back and take it and just just sit back and let the devil do what he wants to do and run havoc but I'm here to tell you tonight I'm tired of sitting back and taking it Shambo had to get to a place you've heard the story so many dumb he had to get to a place he was tired of sitting back and taking it he said oh I've got her as an ox go but they left me an ox coat the Philistines had all the swords took him on our land of Israel and all they left him was a file to sharpen the Ox coat he said okay I'll keep the Ox code sharp and when they come around my time of year I'm gonna take the Ox coat and slay every enemy that gets in my way because I'm tired of sitting back I'm a son of God are you with me tonight you wonder why the devil just runs rampant it's because we just let him and I'm not being trying to be mean tonight y'all know that isn't that what we do when we lose why do we lose you know it's a big deal for a nation like this one to lose a war because we got everything on our side the US if we lose a war that's somebody messed up because we've got all the guns all the money all the weapons don't you realize that we're like that as children of God we've got all the weapons we've got all the guns we've got all we've got all the power of God behind us if we lose the war it won't be because of of what he did as but I he always told us he said we overcome with the blood of the Lamb in the word of our testimony the blood of the lamb is not the problem if there's a problem it's on the other end the blood of the Lamb works do we still believe that I'm trying not to get too close to you tonight the blood of the Lamb works the blood of the lamb is still the same blood that's the same powers that always did the same blood that save you can hear you the same blood that brought you out of sin can bring you into a place where you should be today the same blood and so you make those footsteps of possession that's your testimony in the Civil War I was reading a book while I was down and the book was about General Grant because you know they tried to tear down his statue here recently and so I got curious and I went back in I had read some things I had read part of his autobiography but I thought I'm gonna read this biography and they cut it up into five books I believe of his life so very detailed and I took one of those books and it was when he took over the the Army of the Potomac and he began to fight against robert e lee and what they had done from 1862 McCaleb until 1864 the army of the potomac was the greatest army that had ever been formed General George McClellan had made them into an army that was the best that could be at that time the most modern the most equipment they had the most men the most horses the most cannon everything was the best but they set back in Washington and watch General Robert Lee Lee with half the number of men running around all over Virginia and whenever he'd make a move they go try to stop him and he make a move over here they try to stop him and they'd win a battle and then withdraw and they did this for three years over and over and over again and finally finally General Grant took over the army and he said wait a minute I've got a big army I got more horses I've got more cannon there's no reason to lose and so he first won the Battle of Shiloh and when he fought at Shiloh the first day they got beat man they got beat bad in the first day after the end at the end of the day when they're surveying the wreckage and the damage and any other general would have just walked away from it cut its losses and cross back over the river and beseech General Grant knew something that the other ones the others didn't know he knew there were reinforcements coming because he'd already made plans that this was gonna be a long battle he's so many times we planned for it just being a day or a week or a month and so we get dismayed when it goes longer than that but now he knew he was in the Battle of a lifetime this was gonna make or break his reputation so he didn't just leave it to chance but what he did is he had 40,000 more soldiers on a boat headed that direction amen so at the end of the day they said boy it was a hard day wasn't it he said yeah we'll whip them tomorrow though will whip them tomorrow though why was he able to do that because because he knew oh my his army was bigger he knew he had reinforcements and and the Confederates didn't have any Church we could only realize tonight that what we have is more that's what that's what Elijah had to make his servant realize there's more with us and be with them there's angels at the position there's people there's angels standing all around you you can't see him but the brown said if you could all see with spiritual eyes he said you see angels at the position at every pew the Bible says the angel of the lord encamps around about them to fear him and so we know that that General Grant knew that there was some there's more with him than was with the enemy he was no robert e lee he was no military genius he had confidence in his army and his weapons he says and he made this strategic change he told his generals he said whatever robert e lee does we don't care about we don't care what he does we're going to Richmond and he sent back a telegram after they got beat a couple of times going to Richmond and President Lincoln asked him about it he sent back a telegram and says we'll reach he said we'll fight this battle will win this battle if it takes all summer and it did in the summer of 1864 was the worst summer of the war but they were on the winning track they were no longer being defeated every time and just going back and now they were on their way to Richmond and they weren't going to stop till they got there Oh church if we can only realized we've got a gold - we've got to go - we're gonna defeat death one of these days our generation has to defeat this somebody's got to defeat them if we're gonna defeat death we gotta set a goal we've got to set a goal and say I'm not gonna stop halfway I'm not gonna stop luck down the channel somewhere but I'm going to keep going if I have to fight it out on this line if I fall let someone else come in and stand in my place if I if I get wounded in the battle if someone else come let there be reinforcements ready because we're going to Richmond amen see brother brother says what is Satan's weapon against you it's to try to get you to just believe your weapon he disarms you if he can get you to just believe your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you he said look he's disarmed you and he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon he says don't you lay it down he says in one of the million speaking of David he says as we think of David as he was given a charge over a few sheep just a few one day a bear came in and got that one little sheep and took it out would have eaten it up like a cancer would eat up a body we're huge lion but David not too well equipped with a rifle not a swordsman but with only a slingshot he went after that she may not be too much equipped as a preacher of the Helen but I'm going after that sheep you may not be too equipped as a singer or whatever it is that you are but you're going after that she may not be the biggest Church in the message what we're going after those sheep huh he said David not you all equipped but he went after that sheep but when he found the animal that was about to kill the little sheep he's through it with the slingshot just a simple little weapon with a piece of leather and a string but he had confidence in it listen what brother branham says he's praying and he says we have no great genius among us Lord we are simple people with a simple little prayer but we are coming this morning after the father sheep that woman that has walked the streets miserably smoking cigarettes trying to find peace through the cigarette that man who has smelled the glass and tried to set it back but the enemy holds him tight that boy or girl has tried to do right that just can't find strength to break away from the wrong thing we come in the name of the Lord Jesus to claim that sheep what did Jesus do he went down any thought or he went down he left the 99 he went the Good Shepherd went to seek the one doctor today we've lost our focus what are we supposed to do what he what does David supposed to do he's supposed to go down after that sheep why because he believes his weapon is equivalent he believes his weapons better than hey he believes his weapon is better than anything the world has to offer I'm going after that sheep I feel like the mouse that fell into the brewery I'm not dying up here I'm out of breath because I'm bad that's most of it just lighten it up for you a little bit the story told the mouse fell into the brewery VAT you've heard the story the cat was chasing just every up one side and down the other he fell in there and swallowed a little bit of that and he come crawling out he said where's that cat but we got something more than false bravado what have we got we've got the sword of the Lord we've got a slingshot we've got confidence in let's go after that sheet I want to go after that she don't give up on them why should we give up one who says we have to give up one if there's one left let's go after that one that might be the last one he said but you don't know what they did let's go after that one if there's one left let's go we want our family safe what but what about that one what if we sign our family would it be somebody else entirely what if that one has no family left at all we really do after that one there's a son of God out there's a daughter of God out there this that's failed miserably to quit smoking failed miserably to quit drinking but we have a God who could save them from that place let's go after that one as a church let's not use this time to be defensive and sit back and say why we can't do all we normally do we can't have church on us go after that one let's get the baptistry and pull it up and get ready to baptize somebody let's go after that one are you with me tonight let's go after that one let's defy the enemy I don't want to lose one I'm not content with losing one of my children are you I'm not gonna deal with this one I brought after every one of them the Lord carries and they get old enough to kick the tracers and want to leave I'm going to come after that one but I've got some others I want to go after return your grandson played at my wedding I want to go after that one I wanna go after Truman I want to see them saved you guys are never gonna let me be quarantined again I won't go after that one I've been through a battle I know what it's like to come out on the other side something just stabbed but this last six months has been a battle we've been fighting but it's time we'd come out the other side but to come out with a head not to come out with the head of the enemy and wave it in front of the people and say we got proof that we can overcome we've got proof that we don't have to sit back and take it anymore people say you might as well give up you might as well quit why quit somebody's got to do it everybody said well if you do that if you go there if you preach there to do that you you'll ruin your ministry they probably said that to David do if you go that you'll just you get messed up you get identified as somebody who wasn't able to do it no I believe my God is able to do it that one that that's going off that one that's gone in the wrong way let's go after that one God let me come back in this area for a reason I'm sorry I'm being way too personal but let's go after those ones let's go after those ones we defy the enemy he said because it's a simple thing a slingshot of Prayer but we're coming to bring that one back to the father's fault that we might give an account remember with preachers on that recently we might give an account of those things that's been committed to our hand let's go after those ones oh my but the band says may the power of God now strike faith down in the hearts of the people may that lost soul return this morning may the temptations of this life turn him away let him go may find himself safely upon the Masters shoulders being carried back to safety again amen no I'm not presenting to you today that the strength of Goliath isn't real in Israel it was something that that present generation had he looked at before last that are always been there but he's saved with the pack now he stepped out in front now they knew his name now they knew what he wants and what he could do and I'm sure there were stories that begin to circulate around the camp and begin to say well Goliath is able to fight like nobody else you should have seen the king that he worked over here you should have seen the mighty men that have met the end of his sort he was so impressive to that generation that every one of them fell in fear these were not timid little men these were mighty men the Bible says that Saul picked the mightiest men in Israel to go out and fight and every one of them was scared at this giant because these stats weren't made up this was a real nine and a half foot giant they could see he killed other men they could go to hell to see well that happened and so-and-so searched he never recovered well these people that something happened to him and and they caught this and and it just destroyed the church they could look they saw the testimony from all around they could see on every side how real Goliath's sword was and it was a good excuse are you hearing me just because it was real didn't mean it didn't become an excuse and become a good excuse but it was still an excuse and as long as we keep making excuses the devil keep providing them so I said to David they were not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for the hour but he youth and he's a man of war from his youth David wasn't he wasn't sitting there saying oh he don't have a weapon that brass isn't real it's just clay he knew it was real but he had a weapon too hey bet I know what alcohol can do I've seen it destroy homes I know what infidelity can do I know what what but I know what the devil likes to do in a church I know what gossip can do I know what legalism can do I know what the power the enemy can do but weapons - you got weapons too we know the weapon is deadly but we have deadly weapons - the Challenger today is strong he's convinced mini to give up but see what is his challenge let's look at this for just a moment because I think it's important his challenge was not just what Goliath was saying but then David had to go into Saul skin you remember and what did he do he went to South Stan's all said okay you can go fight him here's some armor you can go fight him but first become like everybody else you can go fight him but first here's some armor here's some ecclesiastical ideas here's some denomination you can fight him but just be like the rest of the church's fighting like the rest of the churches do here's some armor and so he tries to put that armor on David and it didn't fit right you can't wear it because it would've made him like everyone else I don't want to be like everyone else because everyone else is losing let me have big churches but they're losing it may have lots of music and lots of things but they're losing I don't want to be like everybody else I want to be like David if there's only one of me let me be one that can defeat my enemy there was no one like David in the army nobody like David that would walk out before an armored man like that was just a slingshot but it was exactly what would meet the challenge of that hour and Satan would like to get us with a carrot and a stick and begin to tell us what it doesn't matter be like everybody else it's a carrot and a stick here's a stick will be the coronavirus or persecution or financial trouble and here's the carrot over here just come be like everybody else you won't have to deal with it if you didn't go to church at all you wouldn't have to worry about catching it at church what is the carrot and a stick so what the devil does like I said divide and conquer they can't get you at the stick he'll get you at the carrot and the stick just becomes an excuse to eat Garet well might as well because everybody else is losing anyway no we have a God who wins every time and so but the random in the Feast of the trumpets he takes this and he talks about what's coming in our day this is the challenge of our lifetime this banana is what we have to fight not just coronavirus that's a big thing that's a giant 2020 is a giant everything in the world's happened in 2020 I saw an eagle carrying a shark the other day and they said that would be 2020 would be like that you know and that's the kind of time we have we got everything to kill you killer Hornets killer viruses everything else every day there's something new that could kill you but listen wow what is our battle our battle is Satan trying to tell us to be like everybody else but the brain says what it's done it in the cunningness he said he come in like flatteries what has he done he's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council the world churches the spirit of Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter who's talking about that Jewish group there or the Hilary night Minh that we're driving those Jews back to their homeland talking about how they slaughtered five million Jews six million Jews but now that same spirit comes in an ecclesiastical realm gifts the bride he said bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride he said how lose some clothes loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride but here you'll get it he said the bride will go now go through that time and so it won't be like it was for the Jews we've got a promise of that church he said all we're all going to be closed up we're all gonna have to go out in the woods no as long as the bride is here we'll be able to have Church it might be persecution and things happen or well there may be all kinds of things change but there will be a people who be able to do what God said on the surprise here there'll be a way huh together together because he said do that more as you see the Day approaching so there will be away brother Anderson before they set us up will go up so he says the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will will not the bride he said ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put us through a lot of punishment or I love this I love this because he doesn't do with preachers either a man who chooses a bride doesn't bring a pastor along to punish the people he chose he doesn't he doesn't choose somebody to punish him he's already found grace with her bed and if there's anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand so the pastor might have to preach some things are a little rough but what it'll be it'll be to keep her from turning her hand they'll keep me to keep her from getting out of step hey man it's that call the message of the hour he said by the men do you believe the message how about I wouldn't have anything to preach without the message it's still the voice for the messenger crying out get back in line hallelujah well how do you know what if I say what he said I can say get back in line I know it's I know that that's what God's saying us what he wants to tell us listen God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined I skip forward a little bit he said he said he's already found grace to do with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if there's anything you'll keep her for every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride so it is on the bride aren't you glad for his grace today we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many lost in mind how many sinners was there in the world the hour I got saved God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what anyone else goes I want to do it and in the hour when I see all the churches the great glamour and and have need of nothing they say and see the miserable wretched blind he said then now notice what they would do patting you on the shoulder wanting you to compromise with them he said I was born for a purpose hey men and you go back and listen to the message of great warrior David but the RAM talks about how David was called and elected in place hey man he had already been anointed to do what he did and so he could not fail hey Ben and brother man the speech to the people and tell them you already anointed to be healed you already in order to be sane you're already in order to do that you were called if you don't you weren't called you can't do it but you're called to do it aren't you glad for that tonight they want you to compromise let me said I was born for a purpose that's to condemn that thing and to call to call it out this I do amen he said notice there she is now she's loosed listen what she used to do to call all these little loose ends say Oh else don't make any difference anyhow listen to me Church if you don't hear anything else I said tonight the real danger it's not the coronavirus and it's not maybe the obvious even false doctrines and things but it's that Devils speaking in your ear trying to tell you it doesn't matter the loose ends doesn't matter the things that a prophet restored to us don't matter anymore but its life are you with me now without this message I don't have anything and he whispers in our area pat you on the shoulder and says compromise a little bit doesn't matter you don't have to go to church to be a Christian but a Christian goes to church you don't have to and I'm not trying to condemn you I realize some of some folks have been my family sitting at home tonight watching this so I know my personal I've had to sit home you know how many times I've sent home on a Wednesday night in my life I don't know of any time until last week like I said it's a real devil it's something we have to fight we've got to fight it we're gonna do everything we can to make sure it doesn't impact us we'll do everything we can to be careful in all these things but don't let the devil tell you that it don't make a difference it does make a difference when you can't come to the house of God it does make a difference when you can't just say you'll sit there on your ear and tell you it doesn't make a difference doesn't make a difference if you don't do things like well the parent said it don't make a difference if you don't do things like the word teaches you to do don't make a difference you just put that to the side just do it how you want to do it and it becomes will worship don't make any difference it's all right surely God is a good God He loves us all but the brown said he doesn't he's taking that from Scripture that he loved Jacob and hated Esau here's so much about it being a good God he is a good god but being good he has to be just there is no goodness without justice there is no justice without no law without punishment penalty you see what's happening today everybody's calling for justice social justice but there's no penalty no law and what happens people die because of it in the real world people die because of it you can't just set up your own zone and say well there's no law here no police here why people will die you can't do that spiritual either so Thrones don't say well we'll just live according to how we want to because nobody does it right anyway we'll just sit out by ourselves you can't do that there's no law there there's no penalty there our God is a God of justice where chickenhead he's also a God of mercy and His mercy providing a way of escape for us in this hour and that way of escape is the message of the hour because you won't escape it because you sympathize with it or because you just say well I believe it but bream said that you taught us that on the token you won't escape because you say I believe it but you got it come under it you got to receive the token for yourself David said to Saul look there had to be a response I'm closing with these thoughts Satan has my soft living made it easy to get in the habit of always doing the minimum just staying in the camp not responding to the challenge everybody just set back and looked at the other fellow and said well he's not doing nothing so I'll just sit back - you ever dealt with kids you kids get about 10 or 12 years old you know what they do when you tell them clean your room well Peter didn't clean his room preach at him tonight since they're not here Esther didn't clean her room why does it matter I feel like telling them like Jesus told the disciples what is that to you what if what if he don't clean his room til the Lord comes told you to clean yours but that's what kids do that's what they were doing down in the camp of Saul he didn't go Saul didn't go Dave his brothers didn't go so we're all just gonna sit back and watch for somebody else to do it and sit back and be critical because nobody else is doing it but David shows up and hears it and says hey he said let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go he wants to make it personal we'll make it personal hey Ben fight with this Philistine I will fight because I will win hey Ben he took his staff in his hand and chosen five smooth Stones out of the brook and put them in his Shepherds bag which he had in a script and the sling was in his hand and the Bible says he drew near to the Philistine your eyes he had to go down into the valley sometimes to defeat the enemy you got to go down into the valley you got to go down into the valley he went down into the valley he went down to the little Brook the ravine that was there picked up five smooth stones Kapaa on the other side you know Goliath you know they say something about Giants Giants have poor eyesight what they say I guess that's what happened to me but the same condition that causes someone to be a giant ouch also causes him to have poor eyesight and so what they do it I give you see Goliath looking over and he's trying to look at he can't even see David David has the element of surprise because that glass can't even see him the very thing that made him a giant he didn't have the ability to see but you and I can see he's an ordered our eyes to see David could see him he was big enough to look at he's big enough to see and so here he comes he comes to Korean across the ravine picks up the five smooth stones that jes us from the right have talked about the FAI th he picks it up and he comes up on the other side and he begins to he begins to speak to Goliath and glass they just get close enough to me and I'll show you who's boss and David came near but not near enough to her glass could kill him but what did he do he come near enough to be seen bad and he says today you're gonna you're gonna be defeated listen brother branham puts it this way he said the spirit quickens the word he said he's the powder that sends the bullets out there with it like it was the powder when David met Goliath with a slingshot with a rock in it he only had one place to hit that was right between the eyes the only place with his whole body that wasn't covered so what did David do aim for that spot makes it easy right you don't have to sit there wonder where to hit him at he's got one spot uncovered and that's the spot that'll kill him hey bet you only had one place to hit that was right between the eyes the rest it was armored but God got in that spirit he said what was it he had five stones and a slingshot look FAI th and j esus here he comes something's fixing to happen cuz there's the word the promise and the power to sing it he said that's what we need today is a man that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him to press it out there and watch it come to pass he said that's God's army his word of fires army it's all dressed with the other precedence of himself in there going with us you said well it's not important God don't use men anymore listen to brother Ram says he said I'll go with you being you not Jesus speak at the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the works in his army he presents his army in the form of five officers first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists he presents notice he presents what did glass do he presented himself but God said I'm gonna put my army on the offensive hey men where they present they men they present but there's an army behind them hey man the fivefold ministry is not all of the army there's an army behind them but they be presence his army that way see that that's the public face of it that's what they're there in the front there in the battle they're the ones most likely to get hit too by the way because they're in the battle they learned in the civil war to shoot for the for the noncommissioned officers because they're the ones that were in the battle and they were trying to defy defeat them shoot them to demoralize the enemy but the man had a requirement it was kind of silly it seems like but it was did something to the men what he had to do is stand there with a sword and they may be 100 yards or 200 yards from the enemy but he stood there with a sword and he stood there and waited and as soon as the enemy come close enough he said fire and he went up and down the the line and who actually ride a horse up and down the line and tell the men to keep firing keep fighting he wasn't fighting himself what's he doing encouraging them to fight that's what we're doing tonight I'm encourage you to get on the battle line I'm encouraging you don't run away now it's not the time to run now's the time to be right in the battle he said well I have to say ho right now be in the battle be in the battle be right there if you have to do it from your couch be there if you have to do it don't let Satan steal one service from you don't let Satan steal one time a victory from you don't let him steal one hour of prayer from you you get shut up in your house turn it into a time prayer let God move in your life be let let yourself become his army he said that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers Oh with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the Word of God listen each one backing one another app but Allen did last Wednesday night that's what brother Stewart did Sunday morning each one backing one another up but it's more than that it's a worldwide bride we're not all of the bride if we are we got problems but there's a worldwide bride of Jesus Christ in each one backs the other up hey man each one backing one another up he said with him the chief captain not out there in front up here above her back behind but in them amen the chief captain is in them that's the army vindicating what vindicating his resurrection by the proof of his works jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also what is it it's God in the church in these five predestinated officers backing up every word that he has said with the Holy Spirit himself in there which is the word made manifest proving his resurrection proving that he's his you say well I've known a lot of men that failed don't you realize that's just a devil trying to get you to disbelieve one word of God's coming to you to talk tried to tell you it doesn't matter it does matter every little thing matters I'm not willing to cede one inch of ground I'm not willing to cede one inch of ground if God called for a church that would be a church with a hole in the center let's be a Holiness Church God called friends that there be a church with God with the power of God in it let's be a church with the power of God God called for morality and God calls for certain things in our lives let's live that way let's top-seed one inch of ground to there well it's a difficult time don't give in to the lie of the enemy don't give in to the challenge of the day well we're all the same we're all the same we all fight the same devil bore not all the same David was anointed to do differently means come we proved his resurrection we'd back one another up david's mighty men were known as giant killers why because david was a giant killer my jesus is a giant killer so if i got to follow him i couldn't follow anybody better yeah this preacher over here my fail that one over there my fail but thank god i'm not under any other headship but the headship of the word and the word never fails are you with me tonight the word don't fail if i was under that man and that man falls where does that put me if I'm under the word the word don't fail if you're under me and I feel and I might fail at some point I might fail god forbid that I would ever fail but there'll be times when I may be what makes the wrong decision but you don't have to why because you can you can even make a better decision than your pastor does sure there'd be times where you do why because you're under headship you're under different headship we all go over the same rule book brother man who says if you don't fight according to the rules play the game according the rules you can't win you get to the end to be disapproved but we play the game according to the rules it's not up to me God already has put him on a messenger in this age God already proved it by the pillar of fire God proved it by the Son of man appearing among us then we have to stand here and fight behind him behind him our chief captain the Word of God amen do you believe it tonight you were predestined to meet the challenge David was selected called an anointed to do the job brother man said then if you were a son of God or daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew what meant in time that you'd be planted
