[39:08] Sunday to be able to speak the word of
[39:12] the Lord I'm gonna read from Luke
[39:15] chapter 24 verse 1 and while we're
[39:18] turning there we can I'll tell you that
[39:22] we began a study on the book of 1st
[39:25] Corinthians on Wednesday night if you
[39:27] didn't get a chance to see that there's
[39:28] a link to the full video on our Facebook
[39:31] page there's we had some trouble with my
[39:34] internet at home I may have to do that
[39:36] from the church here but we'll get that
[39:39] done and and it's just kind of an
[39:41] introduction and we were kind of getting
[39:42] our feet on the ground but I think it'll
[39:45] be a blessing to us if we'll kind of
[39:46] follow along and and read through that
[39:48] book Luke chapter 24 and verse 1 if
[39:52] you're watching this morning I really
[39:54] appreciate you being there and say Amen
[39:57] say hello or something to us so we'll
[40:00] know that you're there and that you're
[40:02] able to watch if you have any trouble a
[40:03] TAS know someone was monitoring the
[40:05] stream this morning too so that they'll
[40:08] know Luke chapter 24 and verse 1 now
[40:13] upon the first day of the week very
[40:15] early in the morning they came unto the
[40:19] sepulchre bringing the spices which they
[40:22] had prepared and certain others with
[40:25] them and they found the stone rolled
[40:28] away from the sepulchre and they entered
[40:31] in and found not the body of the Lord
[40:34] Jesus it came to pass as they were much
[40:37] perplexed thereabout behold two men
[40:41] stood by them in shining garments as
[40:44] they were afraid and bowed down their
[40:46] faces to the earth they said unto them
[40:48] why seek you the living among the dead
[40:51] o might be a question for us this
[40:54] morning wouldn't it ycq the living among
[40:57] the dead he is not here but it's risen
[41:01] but you're glad for that this morning
[41:03] remember how he spake unto you when he
[41:07] was yet in Galilee they say remember
[41:09] what he said he told you he wouldn't
[41:12] stay in the tomb he said remember what
[41:15] he
[41:16] bacon - you saying the Son of Man must
[41:17] be delivered into the hands of sinful
[41:20] men and be crucified and the third day
[41:23] rise again they remembered his words I
[41:27] pray the Lord without his blessing - the
[41:29] word he may be seated this morning thank
[41:33] you to all of you that are helping out
[41:34] this morning I appreciate that very much
[41:37] and to sister Carla for that song and
[41:39] appreciate that more than you know just
[41:43] a blessing to be in the house of the
[41:45] Lord I want to speak to you this morning
[41:48] on Easter expectations Easter
[41:53] expectations an expectation is a strong
[41:57] belief that something will happen or be
[42:00] the case in the future it's a belief
[42:02] that someone will or should achieve
[42:04] something you might say that you have an
[42:07] expectation that your kids graduate from
[42:10] school that's an expectation it's a
[42:12] strong belief and in a father or
[42:15] mother's case it might be something you
[42:16] would be willing to go to great lengths
[42:18] to see happen because it's an
[42:20] expectation that you have recently I
[42:24] spoke on dealing with disappointment and
[42:27] disappointments come and many times
[42:29] because of our expectations we are
[42:31] disappointed and yet I want to speak on
[42:34] on a positive side of that this morning
[42:36] that if we don't expect anything we
[42:39] won't be disappointed but we also won't
[42:41] receive anything so there's got to be an
[42:44] expectation of blessings in our lives
[42:47] and and just if you look at your natural
[42:50] life there's got to be some things that
[42:51] you expect to happen and there's got to
[42:54] be some things that you expect to to be
[42:57] true and and every time you get in your
[43:00] car you expect it to start every time
[43:03] you cross the bridge you expect it to
[43:04] hold why because it's an expectation
[43:07] built by your experience you you believe
[43:10] it'll happen but I believe the Word of
[43:12] God is more sure than any bridge and
[43:15] it's more sure than any anything else
[43:18] but the game I feel like I'm a little
[43:20] loud up here this morning maybe just my
[43:21] monitors but you're it makes you more
[43:25] sure of the Word of God than you would
[43:28] be of anything else that you
[43:29] Specht and so we must have expectations
[43:32] when it comes to the Word of God
[43:35] I would ask us this morning to think
[43:38] about what we were expecting out of
[43:40] Easter you know a lot of people are
[43:44] disappointed this morning and some
[43:45] because they were gonna have a
[43:46] helicopter fly over and drop eggs you
[43:50] know on the on the grounds and they were
[43:51] disappointed that didn't happen well and
[43:53] I'm sure the kids especially would be
[43:55] disappointed by that but we weren't
[43:57] gonna do that anyway so we that wasn't
[44:00] an expectation of ours and you know
[44:04] there's other expectations that you
[44:05] might have depending on where you go to
[44:07] church or or if you don't go to church
[44:09] that you might have expectations of an
[44:12] Easter Bunny or some great program of
[44:14] some kind and people expect to have a
[44:17] full church on Easter you expect
[44:20] different things to happen maybe in your
[44:23] family you expect there to be a table
[44:25] with a ham on it or or whatever it is
[44:27] that you Kurt that you cook on on Easter
[44:30] and there'd be something there and maybe
[44:32] you're not able to gather the people
[44:34] like you'd want to or or your kids or
[44:37] your grandkids gather around a table and
[44:38] you might be disappointed by that today
[44:41] but our expectation for Easter has got
[44:44] to be something more than just a holiday
[44:47] that we observe no there's nothing wrong
[44:50] with observing it as a holiday but we've
[44:52] got to see it as what it really is that
[44:54] Christ rose from the dead and it's the
[44:57] single most important event of history
[45:00] that's ever been
[45:02] now many as I said of our expectations
[45:05] come from experience we expect our hard
[45:08] to start because it always has we expect
[45:11] traffic to flow smoothly when it doesn't
[45:14] we have we get upset why because we
[45:17] expected it to happen we expect to be
[45:20] able to go out and eat not right now
[45:23] though doesn't that bother you you think
[45:25] about that there years ago there wasn't
[45:27] a lot of restaurants around that you
[45:28] could go do that but for me that really
[45:30] bothers me to not be able to go out and
[45:32] eat sit down to the table and and be
[45:35] able to eat I never ate anywhere fancy
[45:37] but I just like to go eat Mexican or
[45:38] something you know just just anything
[45:41] almost any rest
[45:43] would do right now so we expect things
[45:46] to happen because they've always
[45:49] happened that way we've always been able
[45:51] to sit down at a restaurant we've always
[45:54] been able to do certain things when we
[45:57] go through times look we're going
[45:58] through now I think we ought to change
[46:00] and we're begin to look rather at our
[46:02] expectations than see what are we really
[46:04] expecting to happen spiritually what are
[46:07] we expecting to happen what are our
[46:09] Easter expectations we expect stores to
[46:15] be stocked we expect things to happen I
[46:17] found out that when I traveled overseas
[46:19] that my expectations didn't match up
[46:21] with what their expectations were
[46:23] because they didn't ever expect to be on
[46:25] time because something was always going
[46:29] to keep them from being there on time so
[46:31] you did you start having churching you
[46:33] just have to realize that you had to
[46:34] wait on the person to arrive you might
[46:36] be an hour late and you go upstairs and
[46:38] get ready after that and then you come
[46:41] back down and go with him and then by
[46:42] that time they've been in church for two
[46:44] hours but it's expectations they just
[46:46] don't expect you to be on time and the
[46:48] people arrive early but if they can but
[46:50] there's people coming all through the
[46:51] service because somebody's car broke
[46:53] down and there was an accident on the
[46:56] way a brother coming to get us had an
[46:57] accident on the way coming to get us and
[47:00] so it's just part of it they don't
[47:02] expect any different and the problem
[47:05] with that is you know we as Americans we
[47:07] expect a lot of things to work that can
[47:09] be a good or a bad thing but it's a good
[47:11] thing in the sense that we have
[47:12] expectations that they're not met we
[47:14] would have a riot and I say there's a
[47:16] good thing because we expect our freedom
[47:19] we expect to be able to go to church we
[47:22] expect to be able to have certain
[47:24] freedoms in our life and be able to go
[47:26] and do the things that we need to do and
[47:28] that's a good expectation right we
[47:31] expect these things to happen and so
[47:33] they do because we create by our
[47:35] expectation an environment that those
[47:38] things can happen in and in a place
[47:41] where there's no expectation there's no
[47:43] environment to be created that it can
[47:45] happen so I want us this morning to
[47:47] create an expectation that Christ will
[47:50] meet us here is that is it too much to
[47:53] ask you know as Americans we expect to
[47:56] be able to go to
[47:57] we expect to be able to put gas in our
[47:59] vehicle be able to go to the store and
[48:01] be able to get what we have Nina
[48:02] how much more should we expect God to
[48:04] meet his word and to be here when we
[48:07] come or wherever we're at this morning
[48:10] your expectations reveal what you
[48:14] believe and who you believe in but the
[48:19] Brandon tells us you get what you expect
[48:21] if you come to the meeting to find
[48:23] something to criticize the devil will
[48:25] show you plenty if you come for the good
[48:28] of it to be saved he says the Holy
[48:30] Spirit will speak to you oh my the Holy
[48:34] Spirit will speak to you if you're
[48:36] listening this morning for the right
[48:37] reasons expecting God to speak to you
[48:40] he'll speak to you if you come expecting
[48:42] to be healed the Holy Spirit will see to
[48:45] that you get what you expect so be
[48:49] expecting so and again but the round
[48:53] tells us expectations usually is based
[48:55] upon a faith you have to have faith
[48:58] before you can expect anything so even
[49:02] on an elementary level that's crossing a
[49:04] bridge you have to have faith that it'll
[49:06] hold up before you'd cross it and when
[49:09] it comes to the Word of God before you
[49:11] believe it you have to have faith that
[49:12] it works and then you begin to expect
[49:15] based on the promises of God so and
[49:18] those are the two things that
[49:19] expectations come from it comes from our
[49:22] experience but it also comes from his
[49:25] promises right and we could say even on
[49:28] a personal level if you make a promise
[49:30] to me I expect you to do it and yet I
[49:33] realize you're human so you might say
[49:35] brother Ben I'll be in church on Sunday
[49:37] and not be able to I might tell you what
[49:40] we're going to do a certain thing in the
[49:41] church and we just not able to do it but
[49:44] don't that's because we're human but if
[49:46] God ever said anything he did it right
[49:51] he didn't let one word fall to the
[49:54] ground voice but if he ever said
[49:57] anything that's why we believe like we
[50:00] do it's why we dress like we do look
[50:01] like we do and have the the the
[50:04] standards that we do is because we
[50:05] believe God keeps his word we don't
[50:08] believe in change
[50:09] with the flow of time in the whims of
[50:11] time we believe God keeps his word and
[50:13] if God keeps his word today we can
[50:16] expect God to save the center we can
[50:18] expect God to fill us with the Holy
[50:20] Ghost we can expect to see healing we
[50:22] can expect to see God moving in our
[50:25] midst why he promised it and if he ever
[50:27] did it one time David he'll do it again
[50:31] amen oh my I don't think we ought to be
[50:34] bound down by our limited expectations
[50:38] well is the coronaviruses going on all
[50:40] these things no we expect God to still
[50:42] be gone amen our expectations are not
[50:48] based on what's going on in the world
[50:50] what viruses are going around or
[50:52] epidemics or anything else it's not
[50:54] based on the the frailty of men it's not
[50:57] based on just with who's coming to
[50:58] preacher who's gonna be here how many
[51:00] people are gonna be in the service but
[51:02] our expectation is based solely upon the
[51:04] Word of God and if it's the Word of God
[51:06] it'll stand God keeps his word
[51:11] Simeon expected to see the Messiah
[51:13] before his death and he's sawing his
[51:17] expectation was Matt the people Shepherd
[51:19] account he's crazy but he saw him oh my
[51:23] he expected to see him and he was there
[51:26] and somehow he was led right to the
[51:30] place where his expectation was Matt
[51:34] Jesus came into Jerusalem for the
[51:37] Passover on the weekend of his death the
[51:43] people had great expectations we find in
[51:47] Matthew chapter 21 and verse 8 that a
[51:49] very great multitude spread their
[51:52] garments in the way others cut down
[51:56] branches from the trees and strawed them
[51:58] in the way and the multitudes that went
[52:01] before and that followed cried saying
[52:03] Hosanna to the son of David blessed is
[52:06] he that cometh in the name of the Lord
[52:08] hosanna in the highest
[52:12] when he was coming into Jerusalem all
[52:15] the city was moved saying who is this
[52:19] now they expected a messiah
[52:22] but they didn't know who he was even
[52:26] though he came exactly the way that God
[52:29] said he would come exactly word for word
[52:32] the way that the Prophet said he would
[52:34] come and yet the very same people would
[52:37] cry just another day later crucify him
[52:41] but the random says he was the answer of
[52:45] the prophets prophesy here he comes
[52:48] riding upon the foal of an ass what an
[52:50] attraction God was fulfilling his
[52:53] promised word the hour that had been
[52:57] waiting since four thousand years and he
[52:59] says in Genesis the third chapter and
[53:02] the fifteenth verse God had made the
[53:05] prediction the seed of the woman shall
[53:07] bruise the Serpent's head but his head
[53:09] shall bruise her heel that prophesy down
[53:11] through the Bible that had been
[53:12] predicted of this man coming so it all
[53:15] the whole scriptures spoke of that
[53:17] moment that he would come and he's that
[53:20] their king came to them and they even
[53:23] cried got caught up in and cried Hosanna
[53:25] and didn't know what they were talking
[53:27] about even though they understood
[53:30] something was going on and there were
[53:32] great expectations of a Messiah yet they
[53:34] didn't understand and that's what I want
[53:37] to really deal with this morning and in
[53:39] an in-depth way as we want to make sure
[53:41] we expect the right things when we
[53:44] expect what the Word of God is for the
[53:47] hour that we live in then we can see
[53:49] those expectations met and my my purpose
[53:54] then is not to limit your expectations
[53:56] but to grow our expectations because we
[53:59] don't want to settle for the word of
[54:00] another day we don't want to just go
[54:03] back to the word to what Luther had and
[54:05] Wesley had her Pentecost had but we want
[54:08] to be able to come into the fullness of
[54:10] what is expected to be in our day right
[54:14] now and so they come and brother Brennan
[54:18] says here those people that read the
[54:19] scripture day by day watch him come
[54:22] riding in and cried who is this they
[54:25] come to every day and they watched him
[54:27] and said who is this see it's God
[54:29] fulfilling his word to the people that
[54:33] should have known what it was but they
[54:36] didn't
[54:36] know it Jesus own disciples had
[54:41] expectations of his arrival in Jerusalem
[54:45] you know I think they came there that
[54:48] weekend expecting to take over and to
[54:51] them him coming in riding in like that
[54:53] and the people crying Hosanna they must
[54:55] have thought man this is this is it it's
[54:58] gonna happen it's finally gonna happen
[55:00] we're gonna be the rulers we'd find out
[55:03] they even begun to argue among
[55:05] themselves at the Last Supper they began
[55:08] to argue among themselves who would be
[55:10] the greatest and they had expectations
[55:14] of being the right hand man to the king
[55:16] they believed he would be a king but
[55:19] they didn't see that he had to die even
[55:22] though he told them right out that he
[55:24] had to die they still didn't believe it
[55:27] and so Jesus in going through this time
[55:30] he had his face set to Calvary but they
[55:33] were worried about who would be his
[55:35] right-hand man when he took over Israel
[55:37] not realizing that there had to come his
[55:41] death burial and resurrection then the
[55:44] entire Gentile age you know many times
[55:48] our expectations we there's things we
[55:50] don't know and that's a good revelation
[55:53] to get for all of us there are things we
[55:56] just don't know and we're never gonna
[55:58] know some things because we're finite
[56:01] even if you knew some things you forgot
[56:03] them before you even could think to use
[56:05] them and so there's things that we'll
[56:08] never know even though we have a message
[56:10] that's perfect that a god that's perfect
[56:12] and a word that's been opened in our day
[56:15] we have an open book but there's some
[56:16] things we just don't know but we know
[56:18] that God knows and the disciples there
[56:21] were things they didn't know so they
[56:22] base their expectations as if they knew
[56:24] everything right but we should only base
[56:28] our expectations on what we know what do
[56:30] we know what's written in the word and
[56:32] what's been revealed in our our that's
[56:35] what we know so we shouldn't be
[56:37] expecting things people are expecting
[56:39] another messenger to come or or
[56:41] something else to happen or there to be
[56:43] some kind of a thing happened before the
[56:47] rapture and you look at the scripture
[56:49] and
[56:49] message if you run it all the way
[56:50] through there's not anything promise
[56:53] before the rapture and we're gonna go
[56:55] into that but there's expectations that
[56:57] people have that there will be certain
[56:58] things that'll happen and in reality
[57:01] they're basing it on what they don't
[57:03] know but we want to base it on what we
[57:07] know what do we know we know there's a
[57:09] rapture coming what do we know these
[57:12] bodies are going to change what do we
[57:14] know we can have our healing what do we
[57:16] know these things we know we know that
[57:19] our redeemer lives we know that we're
[57:21] that he's the same yesterday today and
[57:23] forever we know that our our children
[57:25] will be saved we know there's certain
[57:27] things that we know and the things that
[57:30] we don't know we leave to God but the
[57:33] things that we do know we're going to
[57:34] stay with right now he was there and he
[57:43] come to his place Jesus began to do as
[57:46] the work they begin to do to him as the
[57:47] word said I can imagine that the
[57:51] expectations of the disciples changed
[57:54] that weekend it's kind of like they went
[57:57] from extreme one way to extremely up to
[58:01] extremely down because they were there
[58:05] in the city some of them watched he was
[58:11] beaten as they spit on him in the
[58:16] courtyard they watched as the crown of
[58:19] thorns was pressed down on his head they
[58:24] watched him as he was blindfolded and
[58:27] slapped by Roman soldiers and they said
[58:30] tell us who hits you we watched their
[58:34] king
[58:35] it's the crowd cried crucify him they
[58:41] watched him as he suffered and they
[58:42] watched him as he fell on the Via
[58:45] Dolorosa on the way to Calvary they
[58:48] watched him as he fell and Simon picked
[58:50] up his cross they watched if soldiers
[58:53] took a hammer and drove nails in his
[58:56] hands and feet and what you experienced
[59:00] teaches you things
[59:02] if you watch someone die you expect them
[59:05] to stay dead
[59:07] that's true if you watch someone whom I
[59:11] if you watch someone get sick in a
[59:14] certain way it's true to have faith many
[59:16] times we have to override our experience
[59:19] and they had experienced this they knew
[59:24] that he was dead they watched as he
[59:27] suffered for more than six hours Jesus
[59:31] hung on the cross as his lungs fill with
[59:33] water he's not able to breathe that he
[59:35] hung there suffering we cry to help my
[59:39] God my God why have stuff forsaken me
[59:41] and in that moment every one of their
[59:43] their faith must have been as low as it
[59:45] ever was he was unable to breathe and
[59:51] they brought him the the water and he
[59:54] refused it and finally they pour the
[59:55] wine that he refused it and finally he
[59:57] received the vinegar and he said it's
[59:58] finished they watched as the Roman
[1:00:02] soldier pierced his side watched as his
[1:00:06] broken body was taken from the cross
[1:00:08] maybe Joseph of Arimathea carried him he
[1:00:13] knew he was dead he carried his body to
[1:00:17] the tomb to the place where he would lay
[1:00:22] they watched as the stone was rolled
[1:00:25] over the grave they watch this the
[1:00:30] soldiers were placed on a guard and the
[1:00:32] seal was placed over the tomb but it
[1:00:35] could never be opened all the power of
[1:00:37] Rome would make sure that it was kept
[1:00:39] closed they watched him die it was over
[1:00:45] all of the expectation of human
[1:00:48] experience taught them that when a man
[1:00:50] dies he's dead we can go to job chapter
[1:00:57] 14 and reading about a man and what
[1:01:01] job's idea was and this is the common
[1:01:03] plight of a man job 14 and one man that
[1:01:08] is born of a woman as a few days and
[1:01:10] full of trouble he cometh forth like a
[1:01:12] flower that's cut down he
[1:01:15] also as the shadow and continue with not
[1:01:18] seeing his days are determined the
[1:01:20] number of his months are with thee
[1:01:22] now it's appointed his bounds that he
[1:01:24] cannot pass job says for there is hope
[1:01:28] of a tree if it be cut down that it will
[1:01:30] sprout again that the tender branch
[1:01:33] theraph will not cease though the root
[1:01:35] there have wax old and the earth and the
[1:01:37] stock thereof died in the ground yet
[1:01:39] through the sin of water it will bud
[1:01:41] bring forth boughs like a plant he says
[1:01:45] but man dies and wastes us away a man
[1:01:51] giveth up the ghost and where is he this
[1:01:55] is the experience of man he said as the
[1:01:59] waters fell from the sea and as the
[1:02:01] flood the chaos and dries up so man
[1:02:03] lieth down and rises not till the
[1:02:06] heavens be no more
[1:02:08] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[1:02:11] of their sleep listen they could take
[1:02:12] scripture and say he was dead and he
[1:02:15] would stay dead oh but thank God there
[1:02:20] was other scripture that would apply to
[1:02:23] that hour and job says hope that that
[1:02:27] would have tied me in the grave that
[1:02:29] that would have keep me secret until
[1:02:32] that wrath be passed that that would has
[1:02:34] to point me a set time and remember me
[1:02:38] now they remembered what the common
[1:02:41] plight of man was they remembered
[1:02:43] watching him die they remembered all the
[1:02:45] scriptures of how man dies and and his
[1:02:47] days are like grass and all of these
[1:02:49] things they knew that from experience
[1:02:52] all the wisdom of the Ancients told him
[1:02:55] a man dies he's dead even those that
[1:02:59] have been raised from the dead would die
[1:03:03] again
[1:03:04] no one could stay alive death was coming
[1:03:08] for every man there had been two in the
[1:03:12] Old Testament that had been raptured
[1:03:13] escaped death and yet those that had
[1:03:17] been raptured those that had escaped
[1:03:20] death had never died once you're dead
[1:03:22] you're dead that's what they knew
[1:03:25] oh my or what they thought they knew but
[1:03:28] they should have remembered that there
[1:03:30] was a promise for the Stewart of a
[1:03:32] redeemer and the same job that wrote
[1:03:37] about death wrote this he said oh let's
[1:03:41] go to job 1414 he said if a man die
[1:03:43] shall he live again all the days of my
[1:03:46] appointed time will I wait till my
[1:03:49] change come what right does he have to
[1:03:53] expect this he said thou shall call and
[1:03:56] I will answer thee that won't have a
[1:03:58] desire to the work of that hands listen
[1:04:00] Joe said because I'm yours
[1:04:02] you made me Lord so you're gonna want
[1:04:04] what you made
[1:04:06] oh my don't don't don't ever think that
[1:04:09] you've gone too far for God to redeem
[1:04:11] you why because you're his he said
[1:04:14] you'll have a desire to the work of your
[1:04:16] hands amen
[1:04:18] and then in job chapter 19 he said oh
[1:04:22] the verse 23 oh that my words were now
[1:04:24] written
[1:04:24] oh that they were printed in a book that
[1:04:27] they were graven with an iron pen and
[1:04:29] led in the rock forever for I know oh my
[1:04:34] I know this is something that he knew he
[1:04:37] wasn't he wasn't guessing at this he
[1:04:39] said I know my Redeemer liveth that he
[1:04:42] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[1:04:44] earth and though after my skin worms
[1:04:46] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:04:48] I see God whom I shall see for myself
[1:04:52] man I should be holding none another
[1:04:54] don't my reigns to be consumed within me
[1:04:56] so he's saying though I'm so dead that
[1:04:58] I'm actually decayed and the worms have
[1:05:01] eaten it up and everything is gone my
[1:05:03] insides and everything are gone yet I
[1:05:06] know I'll see him for myself
[1:05:10] amen they should have remembered when
[1:05:15] David said in Psalm 16 and 10 for that
[1:05:18] will not leave my soul in Hell neither
[1:05:20] wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[1:05:22] corruption and brother branham tells us
[1:05:23] that Jesus believed that one scripture
[1:05:26] about himself and went down into the
[1:05:29] grave and come back again believing that
[1:05:31] one scripture hey Ben they couldn't see
[1:05:36] past their experience to the promise can
[1:05:39] I just talk to you about that from all
[1:05:41] that's so many times what happens with
[1:05:43] us we can't see past what we're going
[1:05:46] through to see the promise ahead we
[1:05:48] can't see past the present to see the
[1:05:49] future and so the future many times if
[1:05:52] you look at what's happening now the
[1:05:53] future looks bleak but so many people
[1:05:56] are looking and getting it they're
[1:05:58] looking through dark glasses and they're
[1:05:59] looking at the world in a depressed way
[1:06:01] but I'm here to tell you on Easter he
[1:06:03] still if he's alive and he's no no less
[1:06:07] alive than he's ever been
[1:06:09] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:06:11] forever and so a god that rose from the
[1:06:15] dead has stayed present in our life has
[1:06:18] remained president in our lives so we
[1:06:22] expect certain things to happen and we
[1:06:24] expect my experience you say well maybe
[1:06:28] a man let's let you down and you expect
[1:06:30] a man to let you down maybe your kids
[1:06:32] are go certain way and you just expect
[1:06:34] them to continue that way maybe things
[1:06:36] are hard and you expect things to just
[1:06:38] continue the way that they are but
[1:06:40] remember he's the one who can change our
[1:06:42] expectations the disciples had every
[1:06:46] reason to expect that he would stay in
[1:06:47] the tomb and every reason to expect that
[1:06:51] the promise would not be fulfilled in
[1:06:54] Luke 24 21 two of them were walking on
[1:06:58] the road to Emmaus I'm trying hard to
[1:06:59] stay behind here today and for the we
[1:07:05] have one camera so I don't want to move
[1:07:07] but you know they said we trusted I read
[1:07:11] this the other day but it just I think
[1:07:13] it fits here as well
[1:07:14] they were disappointed they said we
[1:07:16] trusted that it had been he which should
[1:07:19] have redeemed this room they put it in
[1:07:21] the past tense and the word trust is to
[1:07:25] expect or to hope we expected we
[1:07:30] expected him to do this but he didn't
[1:07:32] and because he didn't we expect now that
[1:07:35] he won't oh my how many times have we
[1:07:39] went through that same thing we expect
[1:07:40] God maybe to do something and he doesn't
[1:07:42] do it the way we want it and so then we
[1:07:44] expect it to just be like that but God
[1:07:47] has different expectations for us now
[1:07:52] they said we trusted that it was him
[1:07:54] and verse 25 they they go through a time
[1:07:58] they tell him and it's interesting they
[1:08:00] testify to him here's the stranger
[1:08:02] walking with them and they're walking
[1:08:03] along the way and they begin to testify
[1:08:05] to him and they begin to say you know
[1:08:08] the women went to the tomb and they
[1:08:10] found it empty and we don't know why and
[1:08:15] verse 25 then he said unto them o fools
[1:08:18] and slow of heart to believe all that
[1:08:21] the prophets have spoken why because
[1:08:24] they actually could tell the stories of
[1:08:26] what God did and not recognize what he
[1:08:28] did how many people in this message have
[1:08:31] done the same thing that can actually
[1:08:34] tell the stories of what happened
[1:08:35] without what the prophet of God what God
[1:08:37] did in our day what happened they could
[1:08:39] tell the stories but not recognize God
[1:08:41] sent a prophet but more than that God
[1:08:43] sent His Word and he came down in our
[1:08:47] day amen to open up the word to us how
[1:08:51] many people can see what happened but
[1:08:53] can't see what it meant oh my I trust
[1:08:58] that's not us this morning listen he
[1:09:01] said o fools and so far to believe all
[1:09:03] that the prophets have spoken youyou
[1:09:06] believe some but you didn't believe all
[1:09:08] ought not Christ to have suffered these
[1:09:11] things and to enter into his glory in
[1:09:14] other words shouldn't you have expected
[1:09:15] Christ to suffer these things based on
[1:09:19] what he said based on who he was based
[1:09:22] on what the scripture said and how he
[1:09:24] fulfilled every scripture shouldn't you
[1:09:27] have expected him to do exactly what he
[1:09:30] did and I would tell you about the
[1:09:31] message of this hour shouldn't they have
[1:09:33] expected things to happen just like they
[1:09:35] did because if you go back you find all
[1:09:38] through the message that he said I must
[1:09:40] decrease it he might increase he said
[1:09:42] that the word was coming and it came and
[1:09:44] it fulfilled I heard it fulfilled the
[1:09:46] expectations of God but maybe people's
[1:09:50] expectations were unfulfilled he said I
[1:09:55] ought not Christ who suffers he's saying
[1:09:57] shouldn't you've expected these things
[1:09:58] to happen beginning at Moses and all the
[1:10:01] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:10:03] the Scriptures the things concerning
[1:10:06] himself
[1:10:08] hey Ben oh I'd like to listen to that
[1:10:11] sermon oh my we have the word in our day
[1:10:16] as well listen the word had to be open
[1:10:20] to them to change their expectations of
[1:10:24] what would take place and what had
[1:10:25] happened they had to have they had the
[1:10:29] word had to stand there and reveal to
[1:10:30] them look this is who I am that's what
[1:10:34] we need today we need the word to stand
[1:10:36] and reveal to us this is who I am this
[1:10:39] is what I'm doing today not not 2,000
[1:10:42] years ago but today this is what I did
[1:10:44] this is what these things are
[1:10:46] and he took it back to the scripture
[1:10:49] because if you if you have the word and
[1:10:51] it's really the word it identifies
[1:10:53] itself with the scripture it never
[1:10:55] identifies itself with some theory it
[1:10:58] doesn't identify itself with what a man
[1:11:00] said but it identifies itself with the
[1:11:02] promise hey man so the message this
[1:11:08] message that we hold dear came with
[1:11:10] great expectation the entire religious
[1:11:14] world was made aware that something
[1:11:16] supernatural was among them and I
[1:11:19] brought a picture of the takoma meetings
[1:11:23] in 1948 what a difference than that at
[1:11:26] any church this morning in the u.s. even
[1:11:30] if we had everybody here that's a lot of
[1:11:32] people a lot of expectation a lot of
[1:11:36] people who were believing a lot of
[1:11:39] people who were aware something
[1:11:41] supernatural was among them but we find
[1:11:46] in as brother Benno's ministry goes on
[1:11:48] that like Jesus when at first the crowds
[1:11:51] followed him but then they begin to
[1:11:52] dwindle and but the brownness ministry
[1:11:54] goes on and the same thing happens and
[1:11:56] so we find that at the end of the
[1:11:58] ministry supernatural things begin to
[1:12:01] happen and if you show that next slide
[1:12:04] we find in an attraction on the mountain
[1:12:06] and in Life magazine they carried it
[1:12:09] that here was here was a picture of a
[1:12:13] cloud and brother branham inspired to
[1:12:16] turn it a certain direction
[1:12:17] turned it to the right and realized that
[1:12:21] here was the head of Christ perfectly
[1:12:24] now people say well we can explain how
[1:12:27] it got there well but it's in a certain
[1:12:29] shape the importance of the cloud is not
[1:12:32] how it got there although I believe it's
[1:12:34] supernatural but it's how its what shape
[1:12:37] that it's in right it's identifying
[1:12:40] something and I'll tell you this that
[1:12:44] kind of off my topic but the cloud will
[1:12:47] never convince an unbeliever to be a
[1:12:49] believer it'll never do that it's not
[1:12:53] it's a sign if it's a sign to the
[1:12:55] unbeliever and it is it's a sign that
[1:12:57] judges the unbeliever because how many
[1:13:00] people open that Life magazine who saw
[1:13:02] that and never thought anything of it
[1:13:04] never turned it to the side to see never
[1:13:07] maybe you had an opportunity to hear how
[1:13:10] many people have had an opportunity to
[1:13:11] hear have turned away from us and it's
[1:13:13] nothing
[1:13:14] it'll be judgment to the unbeliever but
[1:13:16] to the believer it will never be
[1:13:18] scientifically proven to be true and
[1:13:21] people today say well if I could get it
[1:13:23] scientifically proven then I would
[1:13:24] believe it it never will be no more than
[1:13:26] that the resurrection of Christ will
[1:13:28] ever be scientifically proven you can't
[1:13:30] prove it by science but science is
[1:13:33] theory it is if you take science what we
[1:13:38] know about science today will change
[1:13:39] tomorrow they tell me that the base of
[1:13:42] knowledge in the world doubles or
[1:13:44] something like that
[1:13:44] I think someone here preached about that
[1:13:46] not long ago how that the base of
[1:13:48] knowledge in the world doubles every few
[1:13:49] days now because knowledge has increased
[1:13:53] since the scripture said that it would
[1:13:54] but it doesn't change the Word of God
[1:13:57] they can learn more but God can't right
[1:14:01] now so we find that this picture meant
[1:14:04] something and brother Brown says the
[1:14:06] observatory's and all of them in Tucson
[1:14:08] are still asking research of science to
[1:14:10] try to find out what it is he said it's
[1:14:13] so high that they can't be fog mist or
[1:14:15] nothing up there what did it where is it
[1:14:17] that they're just as puzzled as that
[1:14:19] supernatural halo hanging under the sky
[1:14:21] and say was when the Magi has come in
[1:14:24] following a star saying where is he this
[1:14:26] born King of the Jews
[1:14:27] what was it God fulfilling his word
[1:14:30] there shall rise a star out of Jacob oh
[1:14:33] my
[1:14:34] he said in the God of heaven promise the
[1:14:37] evening time would have evening lights
[1:14:40] and he says three years ago this mystery
[1:14:43] was a prophecy what time is it sir
[1:14:45] but now it's history it's past the
[1:14:48] promise is fulfilled people still can't
[1:14:50] see that but the promise is fulfilled
[1:14:52] what time is it sir
[1:14:54] what's this attraction God fulfilling
[1:14:56] his word he's the same yesterday today
[1:15:00] and forever so when this happened
[1:15:03] expectations once again came and people
[1:15:07] expected we begin to receive these
[1:15:09] things when you come in the message I
[1:15:11] remember as a kid seeing the picture of
[1:15:13] the pillar of fire and seeing the cloud
[1:15:15] and those things that I had certain
[1:15:16] expectations of what that would be what
[1:15:19] this message was and and really it was
[1:15:23] more than what I expected it was
[1:15:26] different but it was more because I
[1:15:28] didn't understand really what it meant
[1:15:30] to me
[1:15:31] I understood the the the historical
[1:15:35] significance of it I understood that
[1:15:37] that the people were excited about it
[1:15:39] but I didn't understand what it would do
[1:15:42] to my life but now we were looking at
[1:15:47] that and people were looking at that
[1:15:49] especially during that time and maybe
[1:15:51] they thought there would be a return of
[1:15:52] these great healing meetings and maybe
[1:15:54] there would be a return of these things
[1:15:55] that are happening but they didn't
[1:15:58] realize that there was coming something
[1:16:01] greater and that was the word and the
[1:16:03] word came and was revealed and brother
[1:16:08] Branham died and people begin to fall
[1:16:12] away and begin to be disappointed and
[1:16:15] begin to think that like they did on the
[1:16:18] road to Emmaus where we trusted that it
[1:16:22] had been he was the messenger of the
[1:16:24] seventh church age we trusted that these
[1:16:26] things were true but see he did what God
[1:16:30] expected him to do just not what man
[1:16:34] expected him to do he doesn't have to
[1:16:37] come back to fulfill that it's already
[1:16:39] been fulfilled now look Luke chapter 3
[1:16:41] and verse 15 we find that in John's time
[1:16:44] and we're going to tie this back into
[1:16:46] Easter in a moment so just
[1:16:48] with me he's in John's time he said as
[1:16:51] the people were in expectation and all
[1:16:55] men mused in their hearts of John
[1:16:57] whether he were the Christ or not you
[1:17:00] remember this what they did in
[1:17:01] Revelation that they fell down John fell
[1:17:03] down at the a at the angel he said don't
[1:17:05] do that I'm one of your brother in the
[1:17:06] prophets the one who was showing him
[1:17:09] those things and now here they were all
[1:17:12] people were musing is this cried the
[1:17:14] Christ and verse 16 John answered saying
[1:17:17] unto them all I indeed baptize you with
[1:17:20] water but one mightier than I cometh the
[1:17:23] latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
[1:17:24] to unloose he shall baptize you with the
[1:17:26] Holy Ghost with fire I can hear John
[1:17:28] answer back and said have you not read
[1:17:30] in the scripture what Daniel the prophet
[1:17:32] said the daily sacrifice will be done
[1:17:34] away with and that hour has arrived oh
[1:17:38] my now look they were wanting a return
[1:17:42] to the glory of Solomon's day they
[1:17:45] wanted to return to the kingdom of
[1:17:47] Israel they wanted to return but he said
[1:17:50] what's happening is exactly what was
[1:17:52] prophesied to happen it's just not what
[1:17:55] you expected he said that hour has
[1:17:57] arrived have you not read what I say it
[1:17:59] says in the fortieth chapter the voice
[1:18:01] of one crying in the wilderness prepare
[1:18:03] the way of the Lord and about that time
[1:18:04] the Prophet turned oh my and said behold
[1:18:08] there comes the Lamb of God that takes
[1:18:10] away the sin of the world and so I'm
[1:18:15] brother Branham I'm picking up and I
[1:18:16] read through the the scripture and then
[1:18:18] brother Branham picks it up he says
[1:18:20] about that time the prophet turns said
[1:18:22] behold there comes the Lamb of God that
[1:18:23] takes away the sin of the world he said
[1:18:25] now what's the attraction it's changed
[1:18:27] from the Prophet to his prophecy right
[1:18:30] so now people that are looking at the
[1:18:32] Prophet with the expectation he did what
[1:18:34] he was expected to do but now what who
[1:18:37] what do we look at what the expectation
[1:18:39] we look at what he said we look at the
[1:18:41] word to see what is expected in her hour
[1:18:45] now so when John turned away and he
[1:18:51] looks he's looking at the people and he
[1:18:53] tells them the the people you're not
[1:18:56] expecting the right thing many turns and
[1:18:59] said behold the lamb of God and here
[1:19:01] Christ the focus went to him or it
[1:19:04] should have but many people didn't focus
[1:19:08] on Christ because they couldn't see that
[1:19:11] he was what was promised they wanted
[1:19:14] something bigger something world-shaking
[1:19:17] not realizing that this would changed
[1:19:19] the world now as we said experience told
[1:19:24] them in that time that he was dead and
[1:19:26] that he had failed to do what was
[1:19:28] promised you might look and forgive me
[1:19:31] for this but your message experienced
[1:19:33] whatever time you've been in the message
[1:19:35] and you've been around the things of God
[1:19:37] you might begin to think well these
[1:19:39] things are not what I supposed them to
[1:19:41] be it's not exactly my experience and
[1:19:44] but but as I said maybe you begin to
[1:19:46] realize then that it wasn't for the
[1:19:50] world to see but it was for me it didn't
[1:19:54] come so that the world would be a better
[1:19:56] place because the world just gets darker
[1:19:59] and darker but it came for me it came
[1:20:03] for for you it came for those seat of
[1:20:05] God that we're here to get us ready for
[1:20:07] a rapture so experience might tell you
[1:20:10] that there's nothing going on that maybe
[1:20:13] there's a failure in the message of the
[1:20:16] hours that there's a failure even in
[1:20:17] your own life and you feel like you
[1:20:20] don't come up to the place where you
[1:20:22] should be and what happens is false
[1:20:24] prophets come along and use that they
[1:20:27] use those feelings of inadequacy to try
[1:20:29] to make you think when you better listen
[1:20:31] to me are you gonna be lost they lose
[1:20:34] use that feeling of of insufficiency to
[1:20:36] make you feel like well if you believe
[1:20:38] this you'd be different if you if you
[1:20:40] followed this man if if you did things
[1:20:42] this way but what do we have to do we
[1:20:46] have to do like Abraham did experience
[1:20:49] told Abraham that there was no hope of
[1:20:51] children it was the hope of a son out of
[1:20:54] Sarah experience told him because he had
[1:20:57] been her husband for all of these years
[1:20:59] that have never happened he had probably
[1:21:01] 60 80 years of experience that it would
[1:21:04] not happen there was the hope of a child
[1:21:07] but the expectation his expectation was
[1:21:10] based not on his experience with Sarah
[1:21:13] but it was based on a promise
[1:21:15] very bad we have that same promise today
[1:21:19] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:21:21] be changed aren't you glad for that
[1:21:23] today 1st Thessalonians 4 and 17 tells
[1:21:29] us our promise since we which are alive
[1:21:30] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:21:32] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:21:34] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[1:21:35] Lord wherefore comfort one another with
[1:21:37] these words that's that's a promise
[1:21:40] that's an expectation that we should
[1:21:42] have it may not be exactly like we see
[1:21:46] it in our minds eye but it'll happen
[1:21:48] right and if you can imagine you know I
[1:21:51] think we recognize that that the rapture
[1:21:54] itself will not be exactly the
[1:21:57] culmination of will not be exactly what
[1:21:59] we thought it's not going to feel like
[1:22:01] you think it's feel it feels does that
[1:22:04] make sense
[1:22:05] brother branham talked about a breeze
[1:22:08] come over you're a wave or something
[1:22:09] like that I don't know exactly what that
[1:22:10] is
[1:22:11] but I'm going to experience it it might
[1:22:15] be different than what I expect but it's
[1:22:17] still a promise are you with me now oh
[1:22:21] my and it'll happen it'll happen these
[1:22:24] bodies will literally change it won't be
[1:22:26] nothing spiritual in that sense it'll
[1:22:28] happen we don't have the spirit of
[1:22:30] spiritual eyes it'll happen we don't
[1:22:32] have to spiritual eyes seeing Christ
[1:22:33] he'll be there we're gonna see him in
[1:22:36] body form or the man said that's what
[1:22:38] believers believe so he he tells us to
[1:22:42] that we're gonna meet caught up together
[1:22:44] with them in the clouds and maybe we
[1:22:45] don't know exactly what our that takes
[1:22:48] place or when exactly that's gonna
[1:22:51] happen you say well it's between 6 and 9
[1:22:52] but then you can begin to think about
[1:22:53] different time zones different parts of
[1:22:56] the world and you begin to think how's
[1:22:58] it gonna happen well if you sit there
[1:22:59] and try to figure it out you're just
[1:23:00] going to end up not knowing any more
[1:23:02] than you do now but if you realize that
[1:23:04] God has it in his time and his in his
[1:23:07] control then your expectation begins to
[1:23:10] be not that I can change or know the
[1:23:15] event of what's going to happen but that
[1:23:16] I can be changed to be able to go now
[1:23:22] our promise it's not of a worldwide
[1:23:26] revival
[1:23:28] in recognizing your day in its message
[1:23:29] brother Brown said see where everything
[1:23:31] is Israel where the church were the
[1:23:32] immoral where the bride is standing
[1:23:34] what's left
[1:23:35] the next thing taking up of the pride he
[1:23:40] said of course every church is looking
[1:23:41] for a great thing Who am I
[1:23:45] he said every church is looking for a
[1:23:46] great thing I don't come to bring you
[1:23:49] any great thing this morning but the
[1:23:51] steward if he's preaching doesn't come
[1:23:52] to bring you any great thing we come to
[1:23:54] bring you the Word of God but every
[1:23:56] church is looking for a great thing the
[1:23:57] Pentecost say glory to God
[1:23:59] there will come a days that they're
[1:24:00] going to do this and they're going to do
[1:24:01] that see he said there are professors
[1:24:03] they do believe and he says I'm skipping
[1:24:07] through this but you can find it
[1:24:08] recognizing your day in this message he
[1:24:11] says why I go in the businessmen
[1:24:13] convention with them they say glory to
[1:24:14] God then preachers get up and just stir
[1:24:16] the crowd and say there's coming a great
[1:24:18] revival the hands of the Lord is going
[1:24:20] to be upon the earth how the people are
[1:24:21] going forth running like and don't
[1:24:24] realize that's under the trumpets for
[1:24:25] Israel why do they do it he said it's
[1:24:29] because their Christian professors and
[1:24:30] don't realize neither did kfs realize
[1:24:33] what he's doing you realize what they
[1:24:35] were doing they were prophesying of a
[1:24:37] great revival and trying to kill the
[1:24:39] revival at the same time here they were
[1:24:43] prophesying of a great revival he said
[1:24:45] canvas didn't know what he was doing
[1:24:46] they don't realize that they're
[1:24:47] rejecting the very message that sent to
[1:24:49] them oh my and their expectations should
[1:24:54] have been of a rapture in a resurrection
[1:24:56] what should our expectation be at Easter
[1:24:59] time it should be going home going home
[1:25:03] but they failed to see the opening of
[1:25:07] the word which identified the promise
[1:25:09] for their day even though the veil was
[1:25:11] rent from the top to the bottom they
[1:25:13] still couldn't see it he was in plain
[1:25:16] view but they were blinded by a
[1:25:17] traditional veil or Church we could just
[1:25:21] recognize there's got to be some time
[1:25:23] when our eyes are open we can see God
[1:25:24] this is what you did in our hour
[1:25:27] aren't you glad he still moves today now
[1:25:33] brother Branham says in spiritual
[1:25:36] amnesia he said now look he said I want
[1:25:38] to ask you something what if he does
[1:25:39] come tonight oh you say he isn't
[1:25:42] he said I don't know whether he is or
[1:25:44] not I'm somewhat coming tonight so I
[1:25:46] don't know whether he is or not this is
[1:25:49] the last sign said remember thus saith
[1:25:53] the Lord did you ever hear me say that
[1:25:56] but what it was true you are seeing your
[1:25:58] last sign that scriptural you've seen he
[1:26:03] said your last sign Pentecost he said
[1:26:06] don't get mixed up now with what he
[1:26:08] promised Israel after the rapture he
[1:26:11] said that ain't you he said you're done
[1:26:14] see he said now is your day now is your
[1:26:16] sign now is your time don't reject it
[1:26:18] don't do it you better come but they did
[1:26:21] reject it now in matthew 16 and 4 it
[1:26:26] says a wicked and adulterous generation
[1:26:28] seeks after a sign there shall no sign
[1:26:31] be given unto it but the sign of the
[1:26:34] prophet Jonah now what was that sign but
[1:26:38] the brown calls it the sign of the
[1:26:39] resurrection we could say it this way it
[1:26:43] was the Easter sign right Easter was
[1:26:47] he's alive that's what he strips about
[1:26:50] it's not about the bunnies or the or the
[1:26:51] eggs or anything else he's alive hey man
[1:26:54] he's living and after being buried and
[1:26:58] dead denominational twos he came forth
[1:27:00] in our hour and proved himself to be
[1:27:03] alive he was alive the whole time but
[1:27:06] they'd shut off the effects of it to the
[1:27:08] people that's what the denominational
[1:27:09] Creed's did but the render says the Holy
[1:27:11] Spirit was bound by those demons in the
[1:27:13] Euphrates River bound by denominational
[1:27:16] demons for 2,000 years but now it's been
[1:27:19] loosed just like the demons were loosed
[1:27:22] so as the Holy Spirit been loosed he was
[1:27:26] bound the effects of it were bound to
[1:27:29] the people because of denominationalism
[1:27:31] but now we have the ability to come and
[1:27:34] believe in a resurrected Christ so he
[1:27:38] said don't you have the sign of the
[1:27:39] resurrection and brother Barrett says
[1:27:41] and today well I'm so glad we had a
[1:27:44] prophet that could be certain of what he
[1:27:45] was talking about he said today after
[1:27:48] 2,000 years we still see Jesus Christ oh
[1:27:54] my
[1:27:56] that ought to make us happy this morning
[1:27:57] we still see Jesus Christ why can you
[1:28:00] believe that he's not just the story
[1:28:02] it's not just something we share on
[1:28:03] Facebook but he's alive
[1:28:06] we still see Jesus Christ in the power
[1:28:10] of his resurrection standing among us
[1:28:13] doing the things that he did then and
[1:28:15] promised to do he said a wicked and
[1:28:18] adulterous generation will speak after a
[1:28:20] sign always wanting to show me this if
[1:28:23] you can do this and do this they'll get
[1:28:24] it the sign of the resurrection bed now
[1:28:30] look he said he is the same yesterday
[1:28:33] today and forever the word made manifest
[1:28:36] welling among us how we should thank God
[1:28:39] for his great sign see I don't need
[1:28:44] miracles to prove God is true I believe
[1:28:45] in miracles I believe miracles are here
[1:28:48] but it's because he's here
[1:28:49] I don't need miracles to prove God is
[1:28:51] true I don't need a bunch of people in
[1:28:54] the church to prove that God's alive we
[1:28:56] don't need to have a great revival to
[1:28:58] prove the God's alive we'll have a great
[1:28:59] meeting or whatever in people I'm sure
[1:29:01] I'll be right there with him I love to
[1:29:03] shout I love to get in the spirit but I
[1:29:05] don't need that to prove God's alive God
[1:29:07] proved himself to be alive he proved
[1:29:10] himself in our generation and now it's
[1:29:12] come down by the David into our life and
[1:29:14] he's proved to in us he's living amen he
[1:29:20] hasn't proved anything in me what were
[1:29:22] you what were you what are you now you
[1:29:28] want to know if you're born again what
[1:29:29] were you what would you have been had
[1:29:32] your life's not been affected by this
[1:29:34] message what would you have been if
[1:29:35] you'd not been born again what would you
[1:29:37] have been you look at maybe you got
[1:29:39] family members that are out of the Ark
[1:29:41] of safety and maybe the drunks or
[1:29:43] whatever else that they might be and you
[1:29:44] think that's what I would be I'm no
[1:29:47] better than them but for the grace of
[1:29:49] God what is it this message changed me
[1:29:55] oh my it's more than just a set of rules
[1:30:00] for a bunch of words on a book but this
[1:30:01] message is Christ risen from the dead to
[1:30:06] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:09] so I would ask what should we be
[1:30:11] expecting this Easter what should we be
[1:30:14] expecting and I begin to think on these
[1:30:16] things what should I expect as a
[1:30:19] minister standing here before you what
[1:30:21] should I expect what what should you
[1:30:23] expect when you come to here what should
[1:30:25] we expect when we read the word in our
[1:30:27] hour what should we what should we be
[1:30:30] expecting to happen of course we're
[1:30:33] expecting a resurrection we're expecting
[1:30:35] a body change but what about now today
[1:30:37] if it's tomorrow what about today what
[1:30:41] should we be expecting today yes we're
[1:30:43] expecting that to take place but in the
[1:30:45] meantime what do we expect but the
[1:30:50] random goes through this and if you get
[1:30:52] a chance read the end the last 30
[1:30:55] minutes or so we're listening to it of
[1:30:56] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[1:30:57] and I've cut through it and so you just
[1:31:00] bear with me but there's some things
[1:31:02] that brother Branham says that just just
[1:31:04] completely explain to us what we should
[1:31:07] be expecting brother Brown said then we
[1:31:11] can see that the marriage supper is at
[1:31:13] hand hey Ben I skipped ahead
[1:31:17] he said now we see the promises being
[1:31:20] fulfilled
[1:31:22] I'm back on that previous one now we see
[1:31:25] the promise being fulfilled sister
[1:31:27] Joanna's doing her best back there and
[1:31:28] I'm skipping around but I just feel the
[1:31:30] presence of the Lord here this morning
[1:31:32] you believe he's here
[1:31:33] a man he'll he'll speak to you if you
[1:31:36] let him this morning he said now we see
[1:31:39] the promise being fulfilled Christ the
[1:31:41] true headship going in coming in his
[1:31:43] bride doing the same works that he did
[1:31:46] at the beginning and making ready and
[1:31:48] fulfilling his word as he did it first
[1:31:50] in John 14:12 he that believeth on me
[1:31:53] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:31:56] notice he says then the head and the
[1:31:59] body are becoming one better
[1:32:03] listen in works and in sign and in life
[1:32:10] think that through put on your spiritual
[1:32:13] thinking cap this morning the head in
[1:32:15] the body of becoming one in world
[1:32:17] and in sine and in life vindicated by
[1:32:21] God his self through his promise word
[1:32:23] for the last days he promised this in
[1:32:27] the last days he said now if your
[1:32:30] spiritual you'll catch it they said well
[1:32:33] there be a great meeting a great healing
[1:32:35] meeting that's what he promised though
[1:32:36] that's already been fulfilled Sun of
[1:32:39] righteousness come with healing in his
[1:32:40] wings has been fulfilled but what does
[1:32:42] he promise for our day for the head in
[1:32:44] the body to become one hey man it warps
[1:32:48] and sign and in life hey man he said
[1:32:53] then we can see that the marriage
[1:32:55] suffers at hand
[1:32:56] he said now if I never see you again
[1:32:58] remember the marriage separates at hand
[1:33:00] and then the kingdom according to the
[1:33:02] promise is ready to be issued in the
[1:33:04] great millennium they're taking up for
[1:33:06] the Church of the destroying of the
[1:33:07] wicked not say well glory to God we
[1:33:10] shout hallelujah we see that ain't it
[1:33:12] said I'm a missionary have been seven
[1:33:15] times practically over the world I've
[1:33:16] seen heathens devils and everything else
[1:33:18] dancin shall said I've seen all kinds of
[1:33:20] fleshly manifestations that's carnal but
[1:33:22] I'm talking about the headship of Christ
[1:33:24] so he's not he's not saying that it's
[1:33:27] wrong to dance and shout because brother
[1:33:28] Branham did it it's not wrong to be
[1:33:31] excited because that's the natural
[1:33:33] reaction of the flesh when it feels the
[1:33:35] spirit right but what he's saying is
[1:33:37] that ain't it just like to Elisha the
[1:33:40] wind wasn't it the whirlwind wasn't it
[1:33:42] and and the storm wasn't in all those
[1:33:45] things but when he heard a still small
[1:33:47] voice that moved the Prophet to come out
[1:33:49] of his cave hey man and I believe when
[1:33:52] we hear the voice of the word it ought
[1:33:53] to move us to come out of our our
[1:33:55] Creed's come out of our denominations
[1:33:57] come out of what we think and say Lord I
[1:33:58] believe you'll keep your word
[1:34:02] he said I'm talking about the headship
[1:34:04] of Christ notice being personally
[1:34:07] identified by the original headship we
[1:34:10] have the answer to the devil's question
[1:34:12] oh by the devil question said to Jesus
[1:34:18] if you're the Son of God he questioned
[1:34:21] him and said are you really him and the
[1:34:23] answer was that he did what the word
[1:34:25] said he would do hey bet he rose from
[1:34:28] the grave
[1:34:29] then I tell you today we have the answer
[1:34:32] to the devil's question he said amen
[1:34:34] glory we have the answer to the devil's
[1:34:36] question he Christ is risen and has paid
[1:34:39] the price so the devil comes today is
[1:34:42] there are you really a Christian he's
[1:34:43] risen are you really are you really
[1:34:47] expecting your healing he's risen are
[1:34:49] you really expecting God to overcome the
[1:34:51] coronavirus he's risen are you really
[1:34:54] expecting to come up out of that valley
[1:34:55] that you're in he's risen hey Ben he's
[1:35:00] alive he's risen but look he said we
[1:35:04] have the devil's answer he said he's
[1:35:08] he's risen and paid the price and
[1:35:09] raising up the the body he said you
[1:35:12] think I'm beside myself I'm not we've
[1:35:15] got the devil's answer not me that
[1:35:18] liveth but Christ the word living in me
[1:35:20] that's why he can't stop us by putting
[1:35:23] us in our homes he can't stop us if we
[1:35:25] have to stay home he can't stop us if we
[1:35:27] can't all congregate together
[1:35:28] it won't stop nothing because the body
[1:35:30] is uniting with the head we don't unite
[1:35:32] with the head at church are you with me
[1:35:35] now you don't have to be here to be
[1:35:36] united with the head you don't have to
[1:35:38] be in any other person's Church see
[1:35:39] you're not with the head you don't have
[1:35:41] to live in Harding you don't have to
[1:35:42] live in the u.s. you can be anywhere
[1:35:44] where God has called you to be you'll go
[1:35:46] to church because you're United with the
[1:35:48] head you'll live right because you're
[1:35:50] United with the head you believe the
[1:35:52] right thing because you're United with
[1:35:53] the head oh my man he Christ has paid
[1:36:03] the price raised up the body he said you
[1:36:05] think I'm beside myself I'm not he said
[1:36:09] we've got the devil's answer what is
[1:36:12] this answer not me that liveth but
[1:36:15] Christ the word living in me whatever
[1:36:19] question the devil might have on Easter
[1:36:20] however our expectations were built up
[1:36:23] and then - whatever it is - swing on we
[1:36:25] have the answer to the devil's question
[1:36:27] Christ living in me man this is not my
[1:36:30] idea
[1:36:31] it's his power it's not my idea it's
[1:36:34] this word he promised it here it is hey
[1:36:38] he said it would be here and here it is
[1:36:40] we got his answer hope I stir all over
[1:36:46] the world is a season of hope for the
[1:36:50] Baptist's they believe in a Christ that
[1:36:51] was and lived and and they believed he
[1:36:53] can come in your heart but we see a
[1:36:56] Christ that is alive today for the
[1:36:59] Methodists or whatever that it is they
[1:37:00] serve God and maybe the best thing to
[1:37:02] hell but today I'm telling you there's
[1:37:04] been a furtherance of the gospel of the
[1:37:06] word that we can see Christ as he is as
[1:37:10] he really is and how is that to see him
[1:37:13] in us Christ the word living in me he
[1:37:21] said Christ is risen and has paid the
[1:37:24] price for our Redemption what God in
[1:37:28] Christ manifested he gave that flesh and
[1:37:31] that blood that in the blood might come
[1:37:34] to life and the flesh be redeemed that
[1:37:37] God I love this that God in this
[1:37:41] redeemed flesh
[1:37:42] she couldn't manifest his word for the
[1:37:45] day as he did in that day that's how God
[1:37:49] manifests his word he don't manifest his
[1:37:51] word through through pages he manifested
[1:37:54] this is his word but he manifests his
[1:37:56] word in flesh are you with me this
[1:37:58] morning I'm trying hard to stay caged up
[1:38:01] here but to put some of them baby gates
[1:38:03] up here around me oh my you believe that
[1:38:08] this morning we have Satan's answer
[1:38:11] because we are the answer in this
[1:38:16] redeemed flesh God and this redeemed
[1:38:18] flesh could manifest his word for the
[1:38:20] day as he did in that day he said we
[1:38:23] have Satan's answer God has vindicated
[1:38:25] himself again I'm skipping through here
[1:38:27] but just kind of hitting the high points
[1:38:29] you can go back and listen I mean he
[1:38:30] said God has vindicated himself God has
[1:38:34] proved himself in hit to his promise in
[1:38:38] this day he did what he said he could do
[1:38:40] just think about how that they run all
[1:38:43] over the earth those 12 men those 11 men
[1:38:46] that stayed with him and and they all
[1:38:48] saw that he rose again and they believed
[1:38:50] it they went all over the earth
[1:38:51] read the gospel not one of them ever
[1:38:53] denied it after that
[1:38:55] they might have had faults and failures
[1:38:57] and everything else but they never
[1:38:58] denied again that he was risen from the
[1:39:00] dead what made him not denying the fact
[1:39:03] he came inside of him the fact that they
[1:39:06] could walk in the Holy Ghost the fact
[1:39:08] that they could live under the power of
[1:39:09] the Holy Ghost he came in them and they
[1:39:11] never denied it
[1:39:12] but listen we'd had the same thing
[1:39:14] happen in our day we've seen God
[1:39:16] supernaturally prove who he is the sign
[1:39:19] of the Resurrection then we can also go
[1:39:22] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:39:25] he's risen he's alive and he's proved
[1:39:30] himself alive we have the answer to the
[1:39:36] devil's question he said God has
[1:39:40] vindicated himself God has proved
[1:39:43] himself to his promise in this day
[1:39:45] listen this is a profound statement
[1:39:47] hallelujah
[1:39:48] he said the headship is here hey bet
[1:39:52] Christ the risen Lord is here wasn't
[1:39:56] talking about himself people so carnal
[1:39:58] he wasn't talking about about about
[1:40:00] another man that would come some
[1:40:01] prophets some preacher but he said the
[1:40:03] headship is here this thing we didn't
[1:40:05] need another prophet the one we had said
[1:40:07] behold the lamb of God who takes away
[1:40:09] the sin of the world he said he said the
[1:40:18] headship is here Christ risen Lord is
[1:40:20] here in the same power of his
[1:40:21] resurrection he ever was manifesting
[1:40:23] himself
[1:40:24] there's the devil's answer and Brent
[1:40:26] talks about some people that were raised
[1:40:28] from the dead in that time and he said
[1:40:30] that's the reason why this when this man
[1:40:32] sitting here dropped dead the other day
[1:40:33] sitting here we could say come back life
[1:40:35] because the Holy Spirit said so hey Ben
[1:40:39] he said what is it I'm skipping on down
[1:40:42] and he said nothing people the headship
[1:40:44] in the body has become one unit it's God
[1:40:47] manifested in his people that's the
[1:40:49] reason he said the husband and wife is
[1:40:51] no longer Twain they're one God in his
[1:40:53] church is one Christ in you consecrate
[1:40:56] revelation glory to God even bearing his
[1:40:58] name his name is Jesus The Anointed so
[1:41:02] the reason he's called Jesus he's the
[1:41:03] anointed
[1:41:05] the anointed body of Christ proving
[1:41:07] manifested God like that body did the
[1:41:11] anointing it's not a feeling
[1:41:12] but anointing is an empowerment so you
[1:41:16] are the anointed why because you're
[1:41:18] called Jesus mrs. Jesus Christ you've
[1:41:21] taken on his name the reason he's called
[1:41:23] jesus is he is the anointed
[1:41:25] it's the anointed body of Christ proving
[1:41:27] manifested God like that body did and
[1:41:30] that body love this that body that they
[1:41:34] saw died that body that they saw beaten
[1:41:37] that body that they saw tore up and
[1:41:40] falling and not able to hardly make it
[1:41:42] even to the cross that body that they
[1:41:44] saw cry my foot my god my god why has
[1:41:47] thou forsaken me that body has redeemed
[1:41:50] this body hey man that body has redeemed
[1:41:55] this body every of this these bodies and
[1:42:00] he said he said every of these bodies
[1:42:04] and through their God works just three
[1:42:05] full manifestation going to the kingdom
[1:42:08] risen paid the price were redeemed God
[1:42:11] has proved it vindicated it see justify
[1:42:15] on this site why are we justified we are
[1:42:18] his victory the church is his victory I
[1:42:22] told you I think I preached here long
[1:42:25] ago but the bride cannot fall the bride
[1:42:29] cannot fall and we should have gotten
[1:42:32] that through our head after these years
[1:42:33] as ministers we tend to get gloomy
[1:42:36] sometimes and I even do sometimes you
[1:42:37] wonder because you see people just
[1:42:39] aren't doing what they're supposed to be
[1:42:40] doing I'm not talking necessarily about
[1:42:42] you it like I said it gets kind of
[1:42:44] personal with all ten of you in here but
[1:42:45] but but just as a whole you see people
[1:42:48] not doing what they're supposed to be
[1:42:49] doing you get discouraged because bride
[1:42:51] won't fall we got to remember that his
[1:42:54] bride won't fall that's his word that's
[1:42:56] just promise there's already been a
[1:42:59] bride that fell and I see but there was
[1:43:01] a bride that wouldn't fall and so we are
[1:43:06] his victory if he doesn't have us he
[1:43:09] doesn't have victory we are his victory
[1:43:10] the church is his victory we come forth
[1:43:13] in this last days with this glorious
[1:43:15] gospel showing
[1:43:16] his victory he died for this purpose and
[1:43:19] we are proof of his victory when we see
[1:43:23] him coming down and living among the
[1:43:25] church that's his victory o Muhammad
[1:43:29] ready to close in a moment listen he
[1:43:32] said it shows that he couldn't keep him
[1:43:34] in the grave neither that can they keep
[1:43:37] us
[1:43:37] we're already potentially arisen because
[1:43:41] we've raised from the dead unbelief in
[1:43:43] his word from denominational Greece to
[1:43:45] an eternal word of the eternal God which
[1:43:47] is him himself working through us
[1:43:50] manifesting himself
[1:43:51] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:43:53] forever he said brother men they just
[1:43:55] don't excite me we're like you it don't
[1:43:57] have to it don't have to you I believe
[1:43:59] your skill God's but I tell you there's
[1:44:01] something about it it just moves me
[1:44:03] there's something about it that just
[1:44:04] makes me want to say Lord let me say
[1:44:06] true to that word because if I stayed
[1:44:08] true to that word you'll always be there
[1:44:11] that word is true today just as it was
[1:44:14] true in the past he's still moves today
[1:44:20] musicians can go ahead and come I told
[1:44:22] you I was closing I didn't lie that time
[1:44:24] it was a at a conversation yesterday
[1:44:27] with the brothers that I went to Africa
[1:44:30] with last year or the year before and he
[1:44:34] just got back from northern Africa from
[1:44:37] Algeria Mauritania and I sent you the
[1:44:40] some of the stuff on that but he called
[1:44:42] me yesterday and gave me some details on
[1:44:44] something that happened it just thrilled
[1:44:46] me because we believe God is alive today
[1:44:50] and this man was well he went into he
[1:44:54] got the last ticket into Algeria before
[1:44:57] they shut everything down and some of
[1:44:59] those countries have really gotten
[1:45:00] serious about it because if it comes in
[1:45:02] their borders it's over you know there's
[1:45:04] nothing they can do about it it
[1:45:05] shouldn't kill a lot of people and so
[1:45:08] they shut down come from Mauritania
[1:45:10] which is a really really poor country
[1:45:11] into Algeria which is a little more
[1:45:13] wealth and it's at the very top of
[1:45:15] Africa it's a Muslim country and he gets
[1:45:18] into Algeria he's literally the last
[1:45:20] ticket they issued that they would honor
[1:45:22] to go in he gets into Algerian gets to
[1:45:25] the hotel and it's closed they have to
[1:45:28] find another hotel
[1:45:30] put them up and they finally get into a
[1:45:32] hotel and they're trying to figure out
[1:45:35] how they're gonna do this how they're
[1:45:36] gonna meet anybody there's only a few
[1:45:37] believers in the entire country so they
[1:45:39] don't know what their contexts are gonna
[1:45:41] be and after they've been there for a
[1:45:43] while it won't either come and knock on
[1:45:45] the door and it's a Muslim man with his
[1:45:47] robes on and everything and he comes
[1:45:49] knocking on the door and I brought the
[1:45:51] brother told me he said I didn't know if
[1:45:53] I was gonna get beheaded or what and he
[1:45:55] had been told by someone else that there
[1:45:57] was a man from America Christian
[1:45:59] minister that had come into that country
[1:46:02] and he had come to to pray for the sick
[1:46:05] and end to to preach the gospel and so
[1:46:07] the man come up there he said my brother
[1:46:08] is at the point of death he said I want
[1:46:12] you to come pray for it he said I didn't
[1:46:14] know he said but I felt led to go he
[1:46:16] said because I could've got my head cut
[1:46:17] off so he said I win he said this man
[1:46:19] lived in and like a palace a really nice
[1:46:20] house he said he went into his house his
[1:46:23] brother was laying there and their whole
[1:46:25] family was gathered around and their
[1:46:26] Muslims and brother Robert took that
[1:46:29] opportunity to preach the gospel to them
[1:46:31] and then he had all of them laid their
[1:46:33] hands and there was one one sister I
[1:46:35] think and and the brothers like eight or
[1:46:37] nine brothers that were there this man
[1:46:38] that was those dying and they all the
[1:46:41] brothers laid their hands but they don't
[1:46:42] believe a woman can touch a man so
[1:46:45] that's not her husband so they wouldn't
[1:46:46] let her touch and he said the Bible says
[1:46:48] all so he had her lay her hands on him
[1:46:51] too and they laid their hands on that on
[1:46:54] that man and prayed for him and every
[1:46:57] one of those people in that room gave
[1:46:59] their heart to Christ and so there's
[1:47:02] there's all these Muslim people and they
[1:47:05] leave from there and don't know what
[1:47:06] they're they're doing and they find
[1:47:07] another place of two hours away
[1:47:09] and they they end up accidentally in in
[1:47:12] another city that they'd wanted to visit
[1:47:14] originally and they end up in that city
[1:47:16] and end up being able to meet with a
[1:47:18] group of Christians and and they're
[1:47:21] unable to baptize anyone but they're
[1:47:23] gonna have work on getting on baptized
[1:47:24] because of the lockdown but they were
[1:47:26] able to meet with a group of Christians
[1:47:27] and actually livestream the services
[1:47:29] during that time to people who knew
[1:47:31] nothing about the message and nothing
[1:47:33] about the gospel and he said he was
[1:47:35] getting questions like this why did
[1:47:36] Jesus have to die
[1:47:39] you see there's got to be an elected
[1:47:42] seat out there somewhere
[1:47:43] if God would allow man to get the last
[1:47:45] ticket into a country and a Muslim man
[1:47:47] come asking for prayer that's more than
[1:47:49] most Americans would do I stopped the
[1:47:51] stripper by the side of the road one
[1:47:52] time a man on the way to church it over
[1:47:54] it but I've Eason a man was was laying
[1:47:56] there with blood all over him he'd
[1:47:58] gotten his truck had wrecked and I asked
[1:48:00] him if I could pray for him he said if
[1:48:01] you want to he said if it helps me he
[1:48:04] said but I don't really go for that kind
[1:48:05] of thing
[1:48:06] and I prayed with him but it was just he
[1:48:08] didn't want it oh my but they wanted it
[1:48:12] there's somebody somewhere that wants it
[1:48:13] what am I telling you that I'm telling
[1:48:15] you that because it encouraged me as I
[1:48:17] was studying on these things that he is
[1:48:19] still working through his bride the same
[1:48:22] as he did back there he's still the same
[1:48:24] yesterday today and forever maybe for us
[1:48:26] it doesn't happen just that way but the
[1:48:28] people that you meet on an everyday
[1:48:29] basis you don't know why there's people
[1:48:31] I met years ago that just now my
[1:48:33] ministry is having an impact on him and
[1:48:35] I met him years and years ago why is
[1:48:37] that because God wants to move in your
[1:48:39] life he wants to he wants to move he
[1:48:41] wants to use your hands and use your
[1:48:43] feet he is proving that he's alive today
[1:48:45] do we believe it today what are we
[1:48:48] expecting this Easter I'll tell you what
[1:48:50] I'm expecting I'm expecting God to keep
[1:48:52] his word I'm expecting healing can you
[1:48:55] say amen to that today wherever you're
[1:48:57] at this morning you say I'm expecting
[1:48:59] healing I'm expecting the word to be
[1:49:01] true I'm expecting if God said he would
[1:49:03] heal me he would do it I'm expecting my
[1:49:05] children to be saved I'm expecting God
[1:49:08] to move in our services I'm expecting
[1:49:10] I'm not expecting some great worldwide
[1:49:12] revival but I'm expecting God to come
[1:49:15] down and honor his word why because he's
[1:49:17] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:49:19] today the head and the body had been
[1:49:21] united together oh if I could just tell
[1:49:24] you that to encourage you today because
[1:49:26] he lives because he's shown himself
[1:49:28] alive in our day we can know that he's
[1:49:30] living in us bow our heads I'm sorry I
[1:49:33] got too excited by do you believe he's
[1:49:39] living in you
[1:49:41] amen you believe it this morning you
[1:49:46] really know it maybe you've had
[1:49:52] experience in your life and viewed by
[1:49:54] your heads also out there as you're
[1:49:57] listening and watching just for a moment
[1:49:59] pause if you're cooking whatever it is
[1:50:02] that you're doing just pause for a
[1:50:03] moment if you can what are you expecting
[1:50:08] this Easter as I said I'm expecting God
[1:50:12] to keep his word I'm expecting and you
[1:50:15] can look at whatever may be your
[1:50:16] requests that you had this morning
[1:50:18] you're expecting God to meet that or
[1:50:20] that need but maybe the experience of
[1:50:24] your life has made you expect the worst
[1:50:25] and some people as I said they look
[1:50:28] through dark glasses and they just
[1:50:29] expect things to go bad why not come to
[1:50:32] the word today let him take your life
[1:50:36] and mold you to the expectation of the
[1:50:37] word that he's able to live in you he's
[1:50:42] able to walk through you and if there's
[1:50:45] a Muslim man on the other side of the
[1:50:47] world and he wants you to talk to that
[1:50:48] one man and that one family he's able to
[1:50:50] do that if there's someone at the
[1:50:52] supermarket he's able to he's alive and
[1:50:55] well in you today to walk to that person
[1:50:57] maybe for years you've lived before
[1:50:59] someone you don't think it's had any
[1:51:00] impact one day you'll realize it had an
[1:51:03] impact
[1:51:04] one day you'll preach the last sermon
[1:51:07] that someone will ever hear because I've
[1:51:10] never listened to a sermon like this one
[1:51:11] but they watch your life
[1:51:14] and he's alive and because he's alive
[1:51:18] you can still reach out he's still
[1:51:20] reaching he's still forgiving as he
[1:51:23] forgave when he was here he's still
[1:51:25] living through you he's still healing
[1:51:27] he's still doing the things through his
[1:51:29] body because the head and the body have
[1:51:31] come together in our day if you're not
[1:51:34] if you if your life doesn't match the
[1:51:37] word today you know that if it is I want
[1:51:39] to give you this opportunity wherever
[1:51:42] you're at this morning I know it's
[1:51:43] different we can't come to an altar here
[1:51:45] but if your life doesn't match the word
[1:51:47] you're doing things that you know are
[1:51:48] wrong I don't have to run over I don't
[1:51:51] have to tell you what's what's right and
[1:51:52] wrong you know in your heart if you just
[1:51:56] stop doing the things you know are wrong
[1:51:57] didn't you'd be you'd be more like
[1:52:00] Christ but if you could just in your
[1:52:04] life just say lord I can't handle it on
[1:52:07] my own come to the word today come to
[1:52:10] Christ it's that simple accept him into
[1:52:13] your life he said well I don't
[1:52:13] understand all these things that you'd
[1:52:15] preach this morning you don't have to
[1:52:17] you have to believe it and he'll give
[1:52:20] you the understanding as you have need
[1:52:22] of it
[1:52:23] let him raise your life maybe you're
[1:52:26] bound by drugs I don't know why I'm
[1:52:28] dwelling on this this morning but maybe
[1:52:31] you're bound by alcohol maybe you're
[1:52:32] bound by lust let him take over today
[1:52:36] you down on your knees where you're
[1:52:38] added just begin to call up to God he
[1:52:40] can meet you there he's alive and well
[1:52:43] he's not limited to here but he can meet
[1:52:45] you where you're at this morning

[1:52:50] there's a people Lord that are gathered
[1:52:52] together wherever there's even two or
[1:52:54] three or maybe there's just one
