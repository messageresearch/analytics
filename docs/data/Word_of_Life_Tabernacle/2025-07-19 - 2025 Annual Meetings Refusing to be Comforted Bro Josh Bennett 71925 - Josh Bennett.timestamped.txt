[51:27] buddy. God bless you.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many's happy to be
[51:29] here?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; You know, it's my first time here.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; I asked myself, where have I been?
[51:37] You know, Brother Ben said last night,
[51:39] he said, uh, he didn't know what I was.
[51:41] Well, my wife's married to me for over
[51:43] 30 years, and she still don't know. So,
[51:44] it's all right. Everything will be fine.
[51:48] Amen.
[51:50] Well, uh, this is an old Pentecostal
[51:52] song, but I really think it fits the
[51:54] message a lot better than it does, uh,
[51:55] the Pentecostals. So, uh, you pray for
[51:58] me. I'll try to sing it tonight or this
[52:01] morning, I guess.
[52:04] Well, it's not for
[52:08] and it's not passion.
[52:10] Well, it's salvation sent from God. It
[52:14] suits me fine.
[52:17] Said it's
[52:19] good. It's my plan.
[52:23] I love this Holy Ghost.
[52:29] Well, it's my
[52:33] fashion.
[52:35] Well, it's salvation.
[52:38] It suits me.
[52:40] I said it's all true. It's my plan. It's
[52:46] true. I praise God. This Holy Ghost is
[52:50] to you.
[52:52] Well, on the day of Pentecost,
[52:56] there are simple but a few. But the most
[53:00] important thing that to Heat. Heat.

[55:42] experience the Holy Ghost. There's
[55:44] nothing
[55:46] you want.
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:58] your wood.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Kenny, let's go ahead and stand
[56:03] together. We're going to invite our
[56:05] pastor. And actually, Brother Wendle,
[56:07] you want to sing this morning?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Come on up. Come on. We stay standing
[56:12] for a minute. Brother Wendle's going to
[56:13] get ready to sing for us uh uh in he's
[56:16] got to sing every service
[56:20] and at least at least a song. And so we
[56:22] appreciate brother Wendle. Do did you do
[56:23] you love Brother Wendle?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a message last night. What
[56:27] can we say about last night?
[56:35] It was over the top. No. Wonderful. And
[56:38] uh we appreciate Brother Wendle. He uh
[56:41] he he's just been such a blessing here
[56:42] at the church, hasn't he? Amen. I want
[56:44] to say this as brother Wendle's coming.
[56:46] Today is a very special day. I don't
[56:48] think our pastor come out here because
[56:49] he was scared I would do this. But
[56:52] today, Brother Ben turns 40 years old.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; 40 years old.
[57:07] And he may never come out now, but uh
[57:10] but he we love our pastor. We're very
[57:12] thankful for his burden of fellowship
[57:14] here in the area. Amen. I see these
[57:16] meetings every year and it's exactly
[57:18] what he told me when he when he come in
[57:20] here. He said, "I want to see unity and
[57:22] fellowship and and and I believe that
[57:24] it's just y'all y'all all have made that
[57:26] possible by coming and showing up and
[57:28] fellowshipping and and just putting
[57:30] everything else aside.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; But uh Amen. loving one another and and
[57:34] just coming to hear the word of the
[57:35] Lord. That's what we come to do. Amen.
[57:37] And our pastor has had that burden. And
[57:39] we're thankful for a man who carries
[57:41] that burden of the people and who loves
[57:43] every one of you. And and even though
[57:45] he's old now,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; man, he he stands here. And some some of
[57:52] y'all are sitting there thinking, "Are
[57:53] you sure he's only 40?"
[57:58] Was overseas and somebody thought he was
[57:59] my dad,
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:07] you know.
[58:08] He told one brother, he said, "No, I'm
[58:10] 30." I think he was 37, almost 37. We
[58:13] went over there and he said, "I'm 37."
[58:15] And they wanted to see his ID. They
[58:16] didn't believe him. And uh I'm not sure
[58:20] that's right either, but he's claiming
[58:21] 40 and and and holding on to that. So,
[58:23] as brother Wendle sings for us this
[58:25] morning, you can be seated for a moment.
[58:27] Amen. Give the Lord a big hand as you're
[58:29] seated. God bless you.
[58:37] Praise the Lord.
[58:42] Amen.
[58:45] When it was dark
[58:48] in my heart,
[58:52] you brought life to me.
[58:56] A child of darkness
[59:00] became a child of light.
[59:05] [Music]
[59:07] &gt;&gt; When my soul
[59:10] was so dry,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; you and I needed drink.
[59:18] The waters
[59:21] of life
[59:23] you became to me.
[59:27] [Music]
[59:28] I am.
[59:31] I am.
[59:35] You gave to me.
[59:39] I am alpha.
[59:41] I am Omega.
[59:43] The in between.
[59:49] I am.
[59:52] I am.
[59:55] You said to me,
[59:59] I'll be what it takes
[1:00:03] to meet your need.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You were the widow's cruise of oil.
[1:00:14] and oh Elijah's me.
[1:00:18] You were the shelter for Noah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; A shepherd for the sheep and in the
[1:00:28] fire.
[1:00:30] You were the fourth man
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; and a cloud by day.
[1:00:38] A fire by night for your children
[1:00:43] to lead the way.
[1:00:47] I am
[1:00:50] I am.
[1:00:53] You said to me
[1:00:57] I am Alpha.
[1:00:59] I am Omega.
[1:01:01] The in between.
[1:01:06] I
[1:01:07] am
[1:01:09] my arm.
[1:01:12] You said to me,
[1:01:17] I'll be what it takes to meet your need.
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:25] I am.
[1:01:28] I am.
[1:01:31] You said to me,
[1:01:36] I am the bread of life
[1:01:40] standing.
[1:01:43] I
[1:01:45] am.
[1:01:47] I am.
[1:01:50] You said to me,
[1:01:54] I'll be what it takes to meet your need.
[1:02:03] I'll even go the way to Calary.
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:14] Aren't you glad for that? Glory to God.
[1:02:19] Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] Thank you, man. Give the Lord another
[1:02:26] big hand.
[1:02:29] You can feel my cup, Lord. Feel my cup
[1:02:31] of tea. And we'll stand together. I'm
[1:02:35] going to turn it over to our pastor. And
[1:02:37] let's just sing this with all of our
[1:02:38] hearts now. Fill my cup.
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:46] I
[1:02:49] love
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:55] come
[1:02:57] and praise
[1:03:01] this thirsty
[1:03:05] my soul
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:12] bread
[1:03:14] of heaven. Won't
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:18] you fear?
[1:03:22] I want
[1:03:28] you
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:36] and make me.
[1:03:39] Let's sing it like this now. Here's my
[1:03:41] cup, Lord.
[1:03:43] Oh, here
[1:03:46] I come.
[1:03:48] Lord, I lift it up, Lord. I
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:56] want to fill your cup this morning.
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:13] Make it your prayer right now. Oh bread
[1:04:17] of heaven,
[1:04:21] won't you be
[1:04:24] me?
[1:04:26] I want
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:33] my God.
[1:04:36] Fill
[1:04:37] it up and make me
[1:04:46] Let me get ready for the word this
[1:04:47] morning. I want to thank you for being
[1:04:50] here and being a part of the meetings. I
[1:04:52] recognized some people last night, but
[1:04:54] if I've missed you, I'm I'm sorry. One
[1:04:56] of the people I did miss was Brother
[1:04:58] Josh Bennett and his wife uh and his
[1:05:01] sons with us this weekend. Aren't you
[1:05:03] glad that Brother Josh was able to be
[1:05:04] with us? We're so happy to have them.
[1:05:12] such a privilege to have him. And we've
[1:05:15] been, my church has been telling me for
[1:05:17] a while, our church here has been
[1:05:18] telling me, "You've got to get Brother
[1:05:20] Josh out to preach." And
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; I went to True Word Camp last year, and
[1:05:25] while we were there, uh, he preached a
[1:05:27] sermon out there that I think everybody
[1:05:30] ought to hear, young person and old, and
[1:05:32] it was just a marvelous, marvelous
[1:05:34] message. And after that service, I asked
[1:05:36] him to come and preach these meetings.
[1:05:37] So, he'd been scheduled for about a year
[1:05:40] just for this service this morning. So,
[1:05:41] it's just such a special treat to have
[1:05:43] brother Josh Bennett with us from North
[1:05:46] Carolina and we're just going to give
[1:05:48] him his liberty today. Let the word
[1:05:50] speak to us. We've got all day,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; so we might as well have church.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; If you got a need today, I believe that
[1:05:57] need can be met.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; I had a brother testify to me last
[1:06:02] night. He said while the word was going
[1:06:04] forth Thursday night, he said he he
[1:06:08] said, "I I've dealt with depression for
[1:06:10] two and a half years." And he said
[1:06:13] during the service, he said, "I felt
[1:06:14] that lift and it's gone."
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He's still God.
[1:06:21] He can do that this morning.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live with that.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; He can do that for you.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I uh my goodness, we're just looking
[1:06:31] forward to a good day in the Lord. If
[1:06:33] you need anything while you're here with
[1:06:35] us fellowshipping, uh, just ask me or
[1:06:37] brother Joel or one of the deacons.
[1:06:39] We'll be glad to help you any way that
[1:06:40] we can. I know some have to go home
[1:06:42] after this morning's service. Some more
[1:06:43] will maybe be coming in, but we're glad
[1:06:46] to have each and every one of you. Thank
[1:06:47] you pastors that have supported us. As
[1:06:50] brother Josh comes, could we sing that?
[1:06:52] Thank you, Jesus, for the grace that
[1:06:54] you've given us.
[1:06:56] Let's sing that. I want to say thank
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:03] Jesus.
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] Oh my
[1:07:08] for the grace that you have
[1:07:12] given us.
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:16] Though I can't repay from my heart. I'd
[1:07:21] like to say that I
[1:07:25] Oh, thank
[1:07:27] you. Could you lift your hands to him
[1:07:29] and sing it now? I want to say thank
[1:07:33] you. Oh, yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:07:39] Oh, for the grace that you have
[1:07:44] given us. Thank you, Lord. Although I
[1:07:49] can't repay
[1:07:51] from my heart, I'd like to say that I
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:07] Jesus,
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] what the gra
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:23] from my heart like to say I
[1:08:30] thank you.
[1:08:33] Amen. How many believes he's worthy?
[1:08:36] Amen. I tell you, uh, we ought to be a
[1:08:38] thankful people. Amen. It's just good to
[1:08:41] be here and, you know, we're honored to
[1:08:43] be a part of these meetings and, uh, we
[1:08:46] sure, uh, love and appreciate. I look
[1:08:48] out and see uh uh some faces I maybe
[1:08:51] don't know, but I I see a lot of u good
[1:08:54] friends and old friends. And I was just
[1:08:57] thinking u um first time I come out here
[1:09:02] and preached in uh here at the church, I
[1:09:05] felt like a kid. I guess I probably was,
[1:09:08] but um you know and here we are
[1:09:13] all these years later and and uh so many
[1:09:16] things have happened through the years
[1:09:19] and but you know we're still here and
[1:09:24] God's still God and
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I tell you such a a
[1:09:29] comfort in our hearts to know that you
[1:09:32] know through all the storms
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; he's never left us. That's right.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful for that. But
[1:09:38] we appreciate Brother Ben. And today
[1:09:40] being his birthday, I I I just say uh
[1:09:43] you know, want to wish him a happy
[1:09:45] birthday. And u and he's catching up
[1:09:49] with me. So I mean, you know how old he
[1:09:53] is and I'm older than him, so we're
[1:09:54] getting old.
[1:09:56] But uh we um we sure appreciate him and
[1:09:59] his wife and the hospitality. And it is
[1:10:01] good to have my wife with me and I sure
[1:10:04] appreciate her coming. Amen. But we'll
[1:10:06] just get right into the word. You
[1:10:08] forgive me. I'm not very good at the
[1:10:10] formalities.
[1:10:12] Um but we uh we do love you. Amen. Maybe
[1:10:16] we could just bow our hearts together
[1:10:18] just before we look into the word. Lord
[1:10:21] Jesus, we just thank you for another
[1:10:23] opportunity that you've given us. And
[1:10:26] Lord, the services that we've had so far
[1:10:28] and the brothers that have ministered
[1:10:30] and Lord, the word that we have heard.
[1:10:34] Lord, it's just been tremendous. And
[1:10:36] Lord, there's a power in that word.
[1:10:39] Lord, I believe that even this morning,
[1:10:41] if we're hungry, the word is bread.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; God, I if we're sick, Lord, you said you
[1:10:47] sent your word and healed the people.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, if if there's somebody in bondage,
[1:10:53] your word is like a hammer. Yes, Lord.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, it can break the chains.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I believe that if we're in
[1:11:00] battle, and truly we're in a great
[1:11:02] spiritual warfare, but your word is a
[1:11:04] sword. So God, we know that Lord,
[1:11:07] whatever we have need of is in the word
[1:11:09] of God. And so Lord, as we take and we
[1:11:12] open the pages of this Bible, Lord, as
[1:11:15] the prophet said, anybody that has the
[1:11:17] ability to read can read the words, but
[1:11:20] Lord, we want the author of the book to
[1:11:22] come. Lord, we're inviting you just to
[1:11:25] come and Lord, you take and break the
[1:11:27] scriptures to us. And Lord, maybe we
[1:11:30] could have an experience here today like
[1:11:32] they had with you on the road as they
[1:11:35] was walking. And Lord, their hearts were
[1:11:37] troubled. And
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, there they were slow of heart. But
[1:11:41] Lord, you Lord appeared to them and
[1:11:44] begin to walk with them. And Lord, you
[1:11:46] begin to open up the scriptures. Lord,
[1:11:49] reveal yourself through the word. And
[1:11:51] Lord, about the evening time, they
[1:11:53] constrained you to come in. And then you
[1:11:55] begin to break the bread. And oh God,
[1:11:58] their eyes were open and they knew you.
[1:12:00] And Lord, I pray God that that would
[1:12:02] happen here in this service even, God,
[1:12:04] that the word would be opened up to us.
[1:12:06] And Lord, that you would just come and
[1:12:08] do something like you did, Lord, before
[1:12:10] and we'd know you, Lord. And Lord, at
[1:12:13] the breaking of the bread. So Lord, we
[1:12:15] invite you to do that now. And Lord
[1:12:18] Jesus, we'll give you all the glory and
[1:12:19] the honor. And Lord, we thank you for
[1:12:21] all things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:26] If you turn with me uh this morning to
[1:12:28] the book of Jeremiah, I'd like to read
[1:12:30] from Jeremiah chapter 31. And I'm going
[1:12:34] to read from the 15th verse, a few
[1:12:36] verses there. And then also I'd like to
[1:12:39] read from um the book of Matthew in the
[1:12:42] second chapter of Matthew. and just a a
[1:12:46] simple thought, but um it's just uh what
[1:12:49] the Lord had laid upon our heart and I
[1:12:52] trust that it'll be a blessing to you.
[1:12:55] Um we um you know, God hides himself in
[1:12:59] simplicity and
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; and uh he also reveals himself in the
[1:13:03] same. So I mean we're so thankful for
[1:13:06] that. Jeremiah 31:15.
[1:13:09] Thus sayeth the Lord, a voice was heard
[1:13:12] in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping.
[1:13:15] Rachel weeping for her children. Refuse
[1:13:19] to be comforted for her children because
[1:13:21] they were not. And thus saith the Lord,
[1:13:24] refrain thy voice from weeping, and
[1:13:27] thine eyes from tears. For thy work
[1:13:30] shall be rewarded, saith the Lord, and
[1:13:33] they shall come again from the land of
[1:13:35] the enemy. There is hope in thine end,
[1:13:39] saith the Lord, that thy children shall
[1:13:42] come again,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; to their own border. In the book of
[1:13:46] Matthew in the second chapter,
[1:13:51] Matthew chapter 2 and verse 16, this
[1:13:55] is um a scripture around the birth of
[1:13:58] Christ. And we're actually going to see
[1:14:00] a fulfillment
[1:14:02] of the prophecy of Jeremiah
[1:14:05] here in Matthew chapter 2
[1:14:08] verse 16. The Bible says, "Then Herod,
[1:14:11] when he saw that he was mocked of the
[1:14:14] wise men, was exceeding wroth, and is
[1:14:17] and sent forth and slew all the children
[1:14:20] that were in Bethlehem,
[1:14:22] and all the coasts thereof, from two
[1:14:24] years old and under, according to the
[1:14:26] time which he had diligently inquired of
[1:14:29] the wise men." Then was fulfilled that
[1:14:33] which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet
[1:14:35] saying in Rama was there a voice heard
[1:14:38] lamentation and weeping and great
[1:14:40] mourning.
[1:14:42] Rachel weeping for her children and
[1:14:44] would not be comforted because they are
[1:14:47] not.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the Lord would just add his
[1:14:50] blessings, you can be seated.
[1:14:54] I'd like to take from these scriptures
[1:14:57] this morning and
[1:14:59] speak to you just for a few minutes on
[1:15:01] refusing to be comforted.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And uh we see here in in the scripture
[1:15:07] the Bible speaking of uh Rachel weeping
[1:15:10] for her children. And of course um uh
[1:15:14] she this is u speaking of uh of you know
[1:15:19] an old testament uh
[1:15:22] a lady of the old testament which
[1:15:25] actually in the book of Ruth in Ruth
[1:15:27] chapter 4 uh the Bible says that all the
[1:15:30] people that were in the gate and the
[1:15:31] elders said that we are witnesses that
[1:15:33] the Lord make the woman that has come
[1:15:37] into thine house speaking of Ruth like
[1:15:40] uh Rachel and Leah, which two did build
[1:15:44] uh the house of Israel. Amen. And so the
[1:15:48] Bible actually attributes to Rachel and
[1:15:51] Leah uh uh that they actually built the
[1:15:54] house of Israel because we know that
[1:15:56] they were the mothers of of of the
[1:15:59] patriarchs. They were, you know, it was
[1:16:01] by their womb. And so, you know, and the
[1:16:04] scriptur is talking about how that
[1:16:05] Rachel uh refused to be comforted. And
[1:16:09] uh I'd like to just start by saying that
[1:16:12] as I looked, you know, of course that is
[1:16:14] speaking of of Rachel's own desire to
[1:16:17] have children
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; and she was a barren woman and she had a
[1:16:21] desire to bring forth life
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; and and and and speaking of that desire,
[1:16:26] but but as I was looking at the some of
[1:16:28] the meanings and the definitions of uh
[1:16:31] uh uh you know how you do when you start
[1:16:33] digging into the scripture, you want to
[1:16:35] find out, you know, what it actually
[1:16:36] means. Sure.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And uh as I I found this u in in in a
[1:16:40] commentary and I hope it's all right to
[1:16:42] use it because I would like to uh build
[1:16:44] off of this, but it says that she
[1:16:47] refused to be comforted for her children
[1:16:49] because they were not. And and in like a
[1:16:52] passionate woman, she refused all
[1:16:54] arguments of comfort of comfort. In
[1:16:58] other words, she refused all arguments.
[1:17:00] In other words, I I maybe just put it
[1:17:02] like this that I believe actually she
[1:17:05] refused to be comforted by any argument.
[1:17:09] In other words, any you couldn't go and
[1:17:11] tell Rachel, well, you know, you just
[1:17:12] got to be satisfied the way things are.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Or, you know, you're really not the
[1:17:17] woman. You're not you're you know, God
[1:17:20] will fulfill this through Leah or God
[1:17:22] will fulfill this through somebody else.
[1:17:24] Amen. And you just got to be satisfied.
[1:17:26] This is your portion. And you know, God
[1:17:28] has chose you for something else. Amen.
[1:17:30] But you see, Rachel refused any argument
[1:17:34] to bring comfort to her. Amen. Because
[1:17:36] she said, "I've got to have a child."
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Genesis 30:1,
[1:17:43] "And when Rachel saw that she ha have
[1:17:45] she had bare Jacob no children, Rachel
[1:17:48] envied her sister and said unto Jacob,
[1:17:51] give me children or else I die."
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Think about that. She said, "Give me
[1:17:55] children or else I die." Yeah.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And Jacob's an anger was kindled against
[1:17:59] Rachel and said, "Am I in God'sstead
[1:18:03] who has withheld from thee the fruit of
[1:18:05] the womb?" And God remembered in verse
[1:18:08] 22 of the same chapter, "And God
[1:18:10] remembered Rachel, and God hearkened
[1:18:13] unto her, and opened her womb, and she
[1:18:16] conceived and bare a son, and and said,
[1:18:19] God had taken away my reproach." And she
[1:18:22] called his name Joseph and said, "The
[1:18:24] Lord shall add to me another son." Amen.
[1:18:27] You see in this scripture, it was a
[1:18:29] desperation to bring forth life. Amen.
[1:18:32] And there's all kind of examples of this
[1:18:34] in the Bible. You see it in Sarah. You
[1:18:36] see it in Rebecca. You'll see it in
[1:18:38] Rachel. You see it in Tamar. And Amen.
[1:18:41] Even, you know, we know the story of
[1:18:43] Tamar and how that her her husband died
[1:18:46] before she was given seed. And and then,
[1:18:49] you know, according to the law, Amen. uh
[1:18:51] uh uh you know her father-in-law would
[1:18:53] give her another son and her her
[1:18:55] husband's brother would raise up seed in
[1:18:57] his place but we know how the story went
[1:19:00] to the place that you know even her
[1:19:02] father-in-law refused to give his last
[1:19:04] son to her. Amen. Because they kept on
[1:19:06] dying. Amen. But but you know uh she
[1:19:09] played a part of a harlot. But Amen. And
[1:19:11] think about what she done and and the
[1:19:13] actions that she done no doubt was if
[1:19:15] you look at it it's just wrong. But but
[1:19:17] the motive that she had was right. Amen.
[1:19:20] And the point of the thing is at the end
[1:19:22] of the story, the testimony was this.
[1:19:25] Even Judah said, "You're more righteous
[1:19:28] than I." Amen. Why? Because there was
[1:19:30] something in here. Listen friend, she
[1:19:32] wasn't after pleasure. Amen. She was
[1:19:34] wanting to bring forth life. Amen. She,
[1:19:37] Amen, was desiring. Amen. That she would
[1:19:39] have seen that she would bring forth
[1:19:42] something. Amen. Amen. She was going to
[1:19:45] bring forth life. And it was
[1:19:46] desperation. You see it, Amen. Again, in
[1:19:48] Hannah. Amen. Think about the story of
[1:19:50] Hannah in the Bible and how that you
[1:19:53] know there she was in a time that the
[1:19:55] that the that the tabernacle was being
[1:19:57] polluted and you know the ministry was
[1:19:59] failing and amen there was all kind of
[1:20:02] problems in the church but it was in
[1:20:04] that kind of a time. Amen. And Israel
[1:20:06] was in that kind of condition but there
[1:20:08] was a little woman. Amen. And she had a
[1:20:10] barren womb but she had a desire that
[1:20:13] she wanted to have a son. Amen. And
[1:20:15] listen friend her desire becomes so
[1:20:17] great. Amen. that she amen went to the
[1:20:20] temple. Amen. And she and she be to call
[1:20:23] on God to such a place that they thought
[1:20:25] she was drunk.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kind of desire that
[1:20:28] Hannah had. Amen. And she be to pray in
[1:20:31] her desperation. Amen. Her prayer
[1:20:34] reached to God. Amen. And God remembered
[1:20:37] her.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. You see what it is?
[1:20:41] Amen. She the these women in the
[1:20:43] scripture, Amen. They had a desire to
[1:20:46] bring forth. They they they wanted to
[1:20:48] have children. How you know because at
[1:20:50] the time when the Bible was written,
[1:20:52] Amen, it was actually a reproach unto a
[1:20:55] woman, amen, to not have a child.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. How different it is today. You
[1:20:59] know, it it's almost the complete
[1:21:02] opposite because Amen. You know, now it
[1:21:04] would be a reproach for a woman to have
[1:21:06] a child almost. And even brother
[1:21:08] Brandham talks about that in the
[1:21:10] invisible union. You know, he said today
[1:21:12] if you notice Jesus spoke of it and he
[1:21:14] goes to the scripture of Luke. Amen. in
[1:21:16] Luke 23 and he says, "And there followed
[1:21:19] him a great company of of people and
[1:21:22] women which also bewailed and lamented
[1:21:24] him. But but Jesus turning unto them
[1:21:27] said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
[1:21:29] for me, but weep for yourselves and for
[1:21:31] your children. For behold, the days are
[1:21:34] coming that they will say, "Blessed are
[1:21:36] the barren and the womb that never bear
[1:21:38] and the paps that never gave suck." Just
[1:21:41] think of it today. Amen. The prophet
[1:21:43] said, "It's a degra, it's a disgrace for
[1:21:45] a woman to have a child." See, then they
[1:21:48] begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on
[1:21:50] us and the hills to cover us for for I
[1:21:53] if they do these things in a green tree,
[1:21:55] what shall they do in the dry?" Amen.
[1:21:57] Speaking of a day that would come when a
[1:22:00] woman wouldn't want to have children.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; See, they they'll take a dog or a cat,
[1:22:04] and I better just stop there and say,
[1:22:06] "Listen, hey, Amen. I ain't preaching
[1:22:08] against you dogs and cats. We all love
[1:22:10] animals, right?" Amen. Praise God. The
[1:22:13] prophet of God is saying, "Amen. Don't
[1:22:15] use that as a substitute."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's what he was against. Amen. Is a
[1:22:20] is a is a woman. Amen. That God put in
[1:22:23] her. Amen. To mother. Amen. To be a
[1:22:27] mother. Amen. But she's trying to
[1:22:29] substitute that. Amen. With something
[1:22:31] else. Amen. He'll go on to tell you why.
[1:22:34] They don't want to mess up their bodies.
[1:22:36] And they don't want to Amen. They They
[1:22:37] don't want to bear the reproach of that.
[1:22:39] Amen. Well, I might as well just say it.
[1:22:41] He was pointing all this out. Amen. To
[1:22:44] show you a spiritual condition of the
[1:22:46] church because a woman represents a
[1:22:49] church. Amen. And he was showing you.
[1:22:51] Amen. Listen. Amen. The these women of
[1:22:53] today, these modern w they've got their
[1:22:56] careers and they got their Amen. They
[1:22:58] don't want to mess up their bodies and
[1:23:00] they don't want no screaming snot young
[1:23:02] and hanging around. Amen. Because you
[1:23:04] know it's such a trouble to them. Amen.
[1:23:06] And he's saying that's the condition the
[1:23:08] same condition of the church. He said
[1:23:10] the church don't want none of them Acts
[1:23:12] 2:38 tongue talking, screaming,
[1:23:15] hollering youngans. Amen. But I'll tell
[1:23:17] you what he said. He said, "But that's
[1:23:19] the only kind that the word can
[1:23:22] produce."
[1:23:25] Hallelujah.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Oh. Amen. You see the condition of the
[1:23:29] time that we're living in. Amen. But I
[1:23:32] want to say just as sure, Amen. As there
[1:23:34] was a Rachel in the Bible that refused
[1:23:37] to be comforted. Amen. She had the
[1:23:40] attitude, "Give me a son or else I die."
[1:23:43] Amen. There's got to be a bride
[1:23:44] somewhere that's got that same kind of
[1:23:47] testimony. Amen. We going to have life
[1:23:50] or we're going to die. Amen. We're going
[1:23:51] to have reality or we're going to
[1:23:53] listen. We ain't interested in religion.
[1:23:56] Amen. We are not interested in who can
[1:23:59] preach the best and who's got the
[1:24:01] biggest church and amen and all that
[1:24:03] kind of stuff. Amen. We want life. Amen.
[1:24:05] Give me life or else I die. Hallelujah.
[1:24:08] I believe there's still a bride
[1:24:10] somewhere that says, "Hey, we want real
[1:24:12] conversions in our church." We want a
[1:24:15] church, amen, with the reality of Christ
[1:24:17] that young people can still be saved.
[1:24:20] Amen. That lives can still be changed,
[1:24:22] that people can still be filled with the
[1:24:24] Holy Ghost. Listen church, I want to
[1:24:26] tell you, let's don't never get to a
[1:24:28] place, Amen, that we get to where, like
[1:24:30] the prophet of God said, Amen, that that
[1:24:32] there was a place in the church that
[1:24:33] they come to a spot that the only point,
[1:24:36] amen, of argument that they had was to
[1:24:39] debate doctrine
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; and fuss over scripture and and try to
[1:24:44] figure out who was right and wrong.
[1:24:45] Listen, God never intended for his
[1:24:47] church to be that. We are not here to
[1:24:50] debate scripture and argue about quotes.
[1:24:52] We're here to be a living manifestation
[1:24:55] of the word of God. Come on, church.
[1:24:58] That, Amen, is an argument that will
[1:25:00] convince a sinner. Not how well you know
[1:25:03] the Bible, but how well the Bible lives
[1:25:05] in you. When they see something that's
[1:25:08] real,
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; brother, that's what I want.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be like Rachel and say,
[1:25:15] "Hey, give me life or else I die.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I want something real. I want reality.
[1:25:25] Yes sir. The
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Bible even talks about Hannah how that
[1:25:28] the scripture says she was in bitterness
[1:25:30] of soul. She prayed to the Lord and wept
[1:25:34] sore. Amen. Brother Brown said in
[1:25:36] desperation he said we find out in James
[1:25:39] 5 the Bible said the effectual fervent
[1:25:42] prayer.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; See
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; amen. It's desperation. The fervent
[1:25:46] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[1:25:49] Yeah.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And when a righteous man, a good man
[1:25:51] gets in travail.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get in travail,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 16, the Bible speaks in
[1:25:59] John 16:20, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:26:01] you that you shall weep and lament, but
[1:26:04] the world shall rejoice,
[1:26:07] and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
[1:26:10] sorrow shall be turned into joy."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. A woman when she is in travail has
[1:26:18] sorrow because her hour is come. But as
[1:26:21] soon as she is delivered of the child,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; she rememberth no more the anguish for
[1:26:26] the joy that a man is born into the
[1:26:29] world.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And you now therefore have sorrow,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; but I will see you again,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; and your heart shall rejoice,
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; and your joy no man taketh from you.
[1:26:43] Friends, I want to tell you, I'd rather
[1:26:44] I'd rather be on that side of the
[1:26:46] scripture.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, listen, a lot of
[1:26:49] us, even right now, Amen. We're going
[1:26:51] through travail. We're going through
[1:26:53] sorry, you're going through hard times.
[1:26:55] Amen. I'll just say this. I believe I
[1:26:57] could probably say it this way. Amen. Of
[1:26:59] everybody that's in this building this
[1:27:00] morning. Amen. You're either in a trial
[1:27:02] or you just come out of one or you're
[1:27:04] getting ready to go into one.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's just where we're
[1:27:08] living at. This is Amen. That's Amen. in
[1:27:10] this life. Amen. We have trouble and
[1:27:13] it's actually promised us in the
[1:27:14] scripture to be that way. But we also
[1:27:17] have a promise, amen, that weeping
[1:27:19] endure for a night, but joy comes in the
[1:27:22] morning. And right now, you'll have
[1:27:24] sorrow, amen, but your sorrow is going
[1:27:26] to be turned into joy. And sometimes you
[1:27:28] get to feeling sorry for yourself and
[1:27:30] you look around and it seems like
[1:27:32] everybody else has got it good and and
[1:27:34] they're just getting by and everything's
[1:27:36] going good and you look at them and
[1:27:38] almost with envy. But I want to tell
[1:27:40] you, there's people on this earth today
[1:27:42] that are living their best life right
[1:27:43] now. And their best times is right now.
[1:27:46] But I want to tell you friends, amen,
[1:27:48] our best days, Amen. are not behind us.
[1:27:52] Amen. They're in front of us.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we may have sorrow this
[1:27:57] morning. Amen. But I tell you what, we
[1:27:59] may weep, but we shall rejoice
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; cuz our sorrow be turned into joy.
[1:28:08] And
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; as Jesus is preaching this, he goes
[1:28:10] straight to a woman in travail.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:28:15] you know that word in the Greek, it
[1:28:18] actually means to bring forth or to be
[1:28:21] delivered.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; To bear, to produce
[1:28:26] the fruit of the seed.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; A woman giving birth.
[1:28:32] And you know if you look at it in the
[1:28:34] English and the definition of the
[1:28:37] English word it means a painful labor.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So the travail is a painful labor.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I'll just say you know there's always
[1:28:47] pain to bring forth. How many knows that
[1:28:49] even the scripture says in Genesis 3:16
[1:28:52] after the fall, he said unto the woman,
[1:28:54] I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; and thy conception and in sorrow shall
[1:28:59] thou bring forth children and thy desire
[1:29:01] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:29:03] rule over thee. Amen. God is speaking to
[1:29:05] the woman that actually prophesying that
[1:29:09] that her sorrow will be multiplied. See,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. and in sorrow she would bring
[1:29:14] forth.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say this, every birth, Amen.
[1:29:21] It is there's pain that goes along with
[1:29:24] it.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, know and brother Benham would
[1:29:28] would always type the natural birth with
[1:29:29] the spiritual birth.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a new birth comes under
[1:29:34] travail.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; See, that's what's wrong with our our
[1:29:38] modern, you know, Christianity. They
[1:29:41] want a Christianity with no suffering.
[1:29:43] Come on. Come on.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; People want authority and and they
[1:29:49] actually, you know, they would love to
[1:29:51] have even character as a gift
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and not a victory.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and people like to, you know,
[1:29:58] they've even made it. Amen. You know, a
[1:30:01] substitute of the new birth. Amen. by
[1:30:03] joining a church and
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; just putting your name on a book and
[1:30:08] amen, you know, just coming up to an
[1:30:10] altar and repeating a sinner's prayer
[1:30:12] and amen and all those kind of things.
[1:30:14] And well, you know, you make a decision
[1:30:15] for Christ and you just walk down to an
[1:30:18] altar repeating the sinner's prayer,
[1:30:19] you're saved for all time and eternity.
[1:30:21] Come on. All right.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You see, friends, and and and you know,
[1:30:24] a lot of us sitting here today would
[1:30:26] say, "Yeah, hey, that's Baptist uh
[1:30:28] that's Baptist theology and that's Billy
[1:30:30] Graham's idea and that's, you know, and
[1:30:32] we're putting it off on somebody." But I
[1:30:34] wonder sometimes if we haven't adopted
[1:30:36] some of the same ideas. Amen. And we got
[1:30:39] the thought that, you know, just believe
[1:30:41] God sent a prophet and you going to
[1:30:43] heaven and you just go to a message
[1:30:45] church and you going straight in the
[1:30:46] rapture. Church, I want to tell you that
[1:30:48] is a that is a deception. Amen. Because
[1:30:51] I can hear a prophet say, "This rapture
[1:30:53] is only for the Holy Ghost filled." And
[1:30:57] Jesus Christ said, "You must be born
[1:31:00] again."
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Even said, he said, "Here's the old
[1:31:06] sawdust trail."
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; The mourner's bench down here for you.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Stay here and moan and groan under labor
[1:31:13] pains
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; until God comes down and fills you with
[1:31:17] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; We all know the Bible teaches a new
[1:31:21] birth. And they've substituted
[1:31:23] handshakes and everything else for the
[1:31:25] new birth, but it'll never take the
[1:31:27] place of a new birth.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; It's got to be an experience, a born
[1:31:31] again.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believes in a born
[1:31:35] again experience?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be an experience, a
[1:31:39] born again. We all know that any kind of
[1:31:42] birth is a mess. When a baby's born, if
[1:31:44] it's on a floor, if it's in a shuck pile
[1:31:47] or in a pink decorated hospital room,
[1:31:50] it's a mess,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; but it brings life.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what a new birth is. It's a
[1:31:55] mess, but it brings life. It ain't a
[1:31:57] style or a put on or a declaration of
[1:31:59] creeds. It's the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:01] Ghost. And that's the secret of the real
[1:32:04] believing church born again. Oh, I know
[1:32:06] you get up from the altar crying and
[1:32:08] boohooing and squealing and slobbering,
[1:32:10] but it brings life.
[1:32:12] It'll take the starch out of you. It'll
[1:32:15] make something that Amen. It'll make you
[1:32:17] something that you ought to be. It takes
[1:32:19] all the world and the stiff neck out of
[1:32:21] you. And today, we like to just walk up
[1:32:23] and say, "I take Jesus as my personal
[1:32:25] savior." That'll never take the place of
[1:32:28] a new birth. When a men when men and
[1:32:30] women come to an altar and forget, amen,
[1:32:32] where they are and who's around them
[1:32:34] until they really die out and are born
[1:32:37] again. Amen. We need to get back to the
[1:32:39] all night prayer meetings. the power of
[1:32:41] the Holy Ghost back in the church again.
[1:32:44] That's what we need today is a good
[1:32:45] old-fashioned St. Paul revival. Amen.
[1:32:48] And the Bible and the Holy Ghost preach
[1:32:51] back in power.
[1:32:53] That's
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; how many believe that's true.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, Brother Josh, this is a this
[1:32:58] is a special meeting on a Saturday
[1:33:00] morning. Why you preach something like
[1:33:01] this? Ain't no better time to preach
[1:33:02] it."
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, hey, we got visitors
[1:33:06] around here. We don't, you know, we we
[1:33:09] don't know people getting the wrong idea
[1:33:10] about us. I just believe it this way,
[1:33:12] friends. If you got truth, you ought to
[1:33:14] proclaim it.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; We I I feel I just feel inspired to say
[1:33:20] something right now. Amen. I believe
[1:33:22] that the devil has got some of us
[1:33:24] preachers at a place that we're almost
[1:33:26] ashamed of the message we believe.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If we believe this
[1:33:31] message is the answer and it's got
[1:33:33] raptured faith in it, we ought to stand
[1:33:35] on the highest mountain. Amen. And
[1:33:37] proclaim it. Amen. We ought to do it on
[1:33:39] our jobs. You ought to do it in the
[1:33:41] school. Amen. Because it is the answer.
[1:33:44] It's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday,
[1:33:47] today, and forever. And I tell you this,
[1:33:49] amen. My heart is to help people. And I
[1:33:51] believe that I serve a God that can take
[1:33:54] a prostitute and make a saint out of
[1:33:56] her. That can take a drunkard. Amen. and
[1:33:59] make a a saint out of it that can
[1:34:01] deliver. Amen. A amen a drug addict.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that what God done for
[1:34:10] me, he can do for somebody else. And
[1:34:13] it's because I believe it that way that
[1:34:15] I preach it this way. Amen. Listen
[1:34:17] friends. You ain't got to accept a
[1:34:19] substitute. Why will we Amen. accepts a
[1:34:22] substitute when the sky is full of the
[1:34:25] real. If you want the Holy Ghost, you
[1:34:28] can have it this morning. If you want a
[1:34:30] real experience with God, you can have
[1:34:32] it. You can have it in these meetings.
[1:34:35] Amen. If you ain't born again, Amen. You
[1:34:37] ain't got to leave that way. If you know
[1:34:39] you ain't got the Holy Ghost, you ain't
[1:34:41] got to leave that way. Hallelujah. You
[1:34:43] can walk out of this service with a
[1:34:46] testimony. I know that. I know that. I
[1:34:48] know. Hallelujah. Amen. He didn't just
[1:34:52] save me. He filled me.
[1:34:56] And he lives in me.
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends will probably say,
[1:35:08] "We're not playing church."
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Christ is a church
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; and and we are in Christ.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And the mystical body of Christ, we're
[1:35:19] born into it.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; You can't join it.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. You can't join it. You got to
[1:35:25] be born into it.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I've been I've
[1:35:30] been in the with the Brandham family for
[1:35:32] almost 55 years, and they never did ask
[1:35:35] me to join.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I was born a Brandon."
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And that's the way you're a Christian.
[1:35:42] You're born a Christian.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Not joined into it. You're born into it.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And everybody is afraid of the birth.
[1:35:49] They got some nice clean way of taking a
[1:35:52] little hand and signing a little card or
[1:35:55] or a salt shake with some water in it. I
[1:35:57] don't even know what that is. But Amen.
[1:35:59] Amen. That's not a birth. A birth is a
[1:36:02] horrid thing. A birth is an awful thing.
[1:36:05] Amen. You don't want to give up. You
[1:36:06] don't want to do this. You don't want to
[1:36:08] do the other. Amen. But the tears, Amen,
[1:36:10] will wash that paint right off your face
[1:36:13] and make you a different person. If
[1:36:15] you're born again, it'll make a mess out
[1:36:17] of you. Amen. But when you'll come forth
[1:36:19] a new creature. Amen. They don't want
[1:36:21] that. They want some easy way. Amen. But
[1:36:24] there ain't no easy way.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; There ain't no easy. There ain't no
[1:36:30] substitute.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Friends, this is exactly where we're at.
[1:36:34] Amen. They want a Christianity with no
[1:36:36] repentance.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. They want an altar with flowers
[1:36:40] instead of blood.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. They want to serve God without
[1:36:44] sacrifice. Amen. But I want to tell you
[1:36:47] something, friends. Amen. There ain't no
[1:36:48] easy way. Amen. And I I'll just say it
[1:36:51] as much as I can say it this morning.
[1:36:53] Amen. The God of the Bible is still the
[1:36:55] same God and he still requires the same
[1:36:57] thing. We heard it last night. Amen.
[1:37:00] Listen, Abel had to climb up and die on
[1:37:03] the same altar that his lamb did. And if
[1:37:06] you ever going to get where anywhere
[1:37:07] with God, you're going to have to do the
[1:37:09] same thing. You're going to have to get
[1:37:10] on the same cross. Hallelujah. Amen. You
[1:37:14] got your cross, too. And Jesus had to
[1:37:16] die as a sacrifice. But friends, we got
[1:37:19] to die to ourselves.
[1:37:22] [Applause]
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; That we might be born again.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; There's no birth without travail.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; The earth is in travail.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; How many knows that's true?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said in the sixth seal, he said,
[1:37:42] "Look at it. Not only here but the world
[1:37:45] over the thing is polluted.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Nature. Amen. He said the whole world is
[1:37:52] in birth pains.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; The world is trying. She's travailing.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; She's trying to bring forth a new world
[1:37:59] for a millennium.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; man. Is is that right? She said, brother
[1:38:03] R says she's in birth pains.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; How many remembers prophet talking about
[1:38:07] Israel in her birth pains? He said as
[1:38:09] she would get away from God, God has
[1:38:11] sent her a prophet. Yeah.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And he said that prophet would shake her
[1:38:15] into a birth pain.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And that birth pain would shake her back
[1:38:18] to the word.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God, Amen. It
[1:38:23] shows us that the world has been in
[1:38:25] birth pains.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the New Testament church, Amen.
[1:38:29] You see a birth pain under Martin
[1:38:30] Luther. There was a birth pain under
[1:38:32] John Wesley. There was a birth pain in
[1:38:34] 1906 Pentecost. And listen, God sent us
[1:38:37] a prophet in this last day. Amen. as a
[1:38:40] as a birth pain to shake us back to the
[1:38:43] word.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He talks about how the whole earth
[1:38:47] is travailing. Paul would talk about it
[1:38:49] in Romans 8.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:22. For we know that the
[1:38:53] whole creation groanth and travaleth in
[1:38:55] pain together unto now. And not only
[1:38:57] they, but ourselves also which have the
[1:39:00] first fruits of the spirit, even we
[1:39:03] ourselves grown within ourselves,
[1:39:05] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:39:07] redemption of our body. Yes, sir.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is Paul saying? That there's
[1:39:11] a groaning that is going on within a
[1:39:14] believer.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; I'll just say this, friends. If you're
[1:39:18] comfortable in this world, there's
[1:39:20] something wrong with your testimony.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; There's not a groan or a travail in your
[1:39:25] soul, not a cry in your in your heart
[1:39:29] that says, "Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1:39:31] You need to come to you need to find an
[1:39:33] altar."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; I tell you what the problem is is we've
[1:39:36] Amen. We we've been we we're we're being
[1:39:39] rocked asleep with a lullabi of Satan
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; in this leodysian age and and sin has
[1:39:45] been so presented to us. Amen. Until
[1:39:48] Amen. You know the Bible even talks
[1:39:49] about over in Daniel 7. Amen. That that
[1:39:51] that it talks about and I'm not trying
[1:39:53] to misuse scripture so don't
[1:39:55] misunderstand but I'm just giving you an
[1:39:56] example that the scripture says that
[1:39:58] that that that that one that would rise
[1:40:00] up that little horn will wear out the
[1:40:03] saints or wear down the saints. Amen.
[1:40:05] you just actually wear them out. Amen.
[1:40:08] And it's just a constant. Amen. Uh you
[1:40:11] know, when something wears you out, it's
[1:40:12] just something that's just constant,
[1:40:13] always just coming at you. And it just
[1:40:15] it just wears you down. And amen.
[1:40:17] Listen, that's the world you're living
[1:40:19] in. You can't even pump gas at a gas
[1:40:21] station. Amen. Without seeing amen a
[1:40:24] projection of Hollywood and the spirits,
[1:40:26] Amen. You can't go to Walmart. You can't
[1:40:29] go anywhere. Amen. Without sin being
[1:40:32] pressed and pushed on you.
[1:40:35] You know what the devil's trying to do?
[1:40:37] He's trying to put it in front of you so
[1:40:39] much that you'll get numb to it.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; You just get numb to it. You've seen it
[1:40:44] so much that it don't bother you no more
[1:40:47] cuz it's just all the time. I tell you
[1:40:49] what I think we ought to do. We ought to
[1:40:51] turn it on the devil and say, "Devil,
[1:40:53] the more I see it, the more I hate it.
[1:40:55] And the more you put it in front of me,
[1:40:57] the stronger my desire gets to get out
[1:41:00] of here. The only thing you're doing is
[1:41:02] making me more desperate.
[1:41:07] Hallelujah.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole creation is groaning and
[1:41:11] we ourselves.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Oh, do you see it?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; All creation is grown." And Paul said,
[1:41:17] "Everything is growing. Look at these
[1:41:19] trees, how they struggle.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Look at the flowers, how they struggle
[1:41:23] for life." Amen. Just Amen. for the
[1:41:26] frost to tear them down. Look at the
[1:41:27] trees. They struggle to hold their
[1:41:29] branches out a and sing the glories unto
[1:41:32] God. Amen. Everything, all nature, all
[1:41:35] animals, the birds. Amen. How he flies.
[1:41:38] Oh my. Everything is groaning. Amen. And
[1:41:40] we ourselves, Paul said, we grown too
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; with them.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; For we're waiting on the redemption of
[1:41:46] our body.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; But now, Amen. They they did all those
[1:41:51] years until now. But now we have the
[1:41:55] earnest
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; of our inheritance.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What do we have? We have the
[1:42:00] evidence that God lives. We have the
[1:42:03] evidence that God is with us. We have
[1:42:06] the evidence that God has not forsaken
[1:42:09] us. Amen. We are his and he is ours.
[1:42:12] Amen. Because in our bodies, we
[1:42:14] tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that
[1:42:17] cries out, "Aba, Father, and there's
[1:42:19] nothing that can ever take away." Amen.
[1:42:21] We've anchored in Christ. The trees
[1:42:23] don't have it. Nature doesn't have it.
[1:42:25] Amen. But yet, it's still groaning.
[1:42:28] Amen. With the Amen. But because Amen.
[1:42:30] uh they haven't yet received the
[1:42:32] fullness because we haven't rather
[1:42:34] received the fullness of our adoption.
[1:42:36] Amen. But we have the earnest.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that quote right there
[1:42:42] because the prophet of God said that
[1:42:43] tree out there is struggling and
[1:42:46] groaning. Amen. For the manifestation of
[1:42:48] the sons of God and it's doing it
[1:42:50] without the earnest.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The birds and all
[1:42:55] creation are groaning and they ain't got
[1:42:58] the Holy Ghost. I want to tell you
[1:42:59] something. If there's a tree out there
[1:43:01] that's trying to hold on to its leaves
[1:43:04] just so that it can praise God a little
[1:43:06] bit longer. If there's a bird that lives
[1:43:09] in this wicked world. Come on, friends.
[1:43:12] Don't you You can't tell me it's easy on
[1:43:14] nature right now. This is the hardest
[1:43:16] time that animal life has ever lived in.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And their homes are being destroyed and
[1:43:22] amen. And their nests are being
[1:43:23] destroyed. Amen. They're constantly
[1:43:25] having to move and and deal with
[1:43:27] pollution and air pollution. But you
[1:43:29] know what? They get up just the same and
[1:43:32] sing the praises of God. Oh, come on,
[1:43:35] church. And if they can do that without
[1:43:37] the Holy Ghost, what about the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost fil of God? Oh, everything might
[1:43:42] not be going your way, but what
[1:43:45] difference does that make?
[1:43:48] I got the earnest, amen, of the
[1:43:51] expectation.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say this, if a bird
[1:43:55] can sing, Amen. I believe I can, too.
[1:43:58] And if a tree will hold on to its leaves
[1:44:01] just so it can praise God a little bit
[1:44:03] longer. Amen. I amen will not forsake.
[1:44:06] Amen. To come to the house of God and
[1:44:08] give him praise.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Because there's something groaning
[1:44:17] within.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; We're waiting on the fullness of our
[1:44:25] adoption. Glory.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; The fullness of our adoption. How many
[1:44:30] knows that's the change of your body?
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet said, "Oh, don't
[1:44:38] that make us old folks feel good?"
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Don't that make y'all Don't that make
[1:44:45] y'all
[1:44:47] Don't
[1:44:49] that make you old folks feel good?
[1:44:53] Hey, I'm telling you, I'm trying to hold
[1:44:55] on to as long as I can, brother.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he goes on to say, "It ought
[1:45:00] to make us all feel good."
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you ain't old, just
[1:45:05] live a little while. You're going to get
[1:45:06] there.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do is just keep on
[1:45:10] living.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to get there.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And you're going to start understanding
[1:45:15] what it's all about. Amen. But but the
[1:45:17] prophet of God said, "Don't that make
[1:45:18] you feel good?" It ought to make us all
[1:45:20] feel good waiting for this hour. We
[1:45:23] understand that this will take place at
[1:45:24] the first resurrection sea. Nature is
[1:45:26] groaning. We are groaning. Everything is
[1:45:28] groaning because we realize that there's
[1:45:30] something that's not right. And the only
[1:45:32] way that you can groan and wait for it
[1:45:34] is because there's been a new life come
[1:45:37] in here that speaks of a new world.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah. Why are you groaning this
[1:45:42] morning? Amen. Because there's something
[1:45:44] on the inside of you. Amen. That's
[1:45:47] crying. Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; A burning desire in your soul.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Now, look at the travail that that
[1:46:02] Israel was under.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. at the time of the
[1:46:05] birth of Christ. You got to remember,
[1:46:08] brother Brown will talk about how that
[1:46:11] he said in birth pains all down through
[1:46:13] the ages, every prophet that come to
[1:46:15] Israel would throw into a birth pain.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; He said until she was finally delivered.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Of a manchild.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; He said the word made flesh.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] And if you want to see a picture of that
[1:46:35] in Ro or in Revelations 12, the Bible
[1:46:38] says, "And there appeared a great wonder
[1:46:40] in heaven, a woman
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; clothed with the sun, and the moon was
[1:46:46] under her feet, and upon her head was a
[1:46:49] crown of 12 stars, and she being with
[1:46:52] child cried travailing in birth and pain
[1:46:54] to be delivered."
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And there appeared another wonder in
[1:46:58] heaven. And behold, a great red dragon
[1:46:59] having seven heads and 10 horns, and
[1:47:02] seven crowns upon his head, and and his
[1:47:05] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[1:47:07] heaven, and then cast him to the earth.
[1:47:10] And the dragon stood before the woman,
[1:47:12] which was ready to be delivered, for to
[1:47:14] devour her child as soon as he was born.
[1:47:17] And she brought forth a manchild, who
[1:47:18] was to rule all the nations with a rod
[1:47:20] of iron, and her child was caught up
[1:47:22] unto God into his throne.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; If you want to know what that means,
[1:47:26] listen to what the prophet said. That
[1:47:27] was the Orthodox church standing there.
[1:47:30] The sun shining down. The doctrine of
[1:47:32] the apostles, the twel apostles. The
[1:47:34] moon was under her feet. The law and the
[1:47:37] shadow of things to come. The gospel
[1:47:39] light that's shining now. The law has
[1:47:41] faded away where the sun has come out.
[1:47:43] She was pained to be delivered. And she
[1:47:45] brought forth a manchild which was
[1:47:47] Christ Jesus and he was caught up to
[1:47:50] God. But but here it is. As soon as a
[1:47:52] dragon, amen, saw the woman ready to be
[1:47:55] delivered, he stood right there to
[1:47:57] devour his the child as soon as it was
[1:48:00] born. And when Jesus was born, the Roman
[1:48:03] emperor issued a proclamation to kill
[1:48:07] all the children from two years old and
[1:48:09] and down. Amen. He was trying to kill
[1:48:12] Christ Jesus,
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; but God pulled the wool over his eyes
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and took him down in Egypt and hid him
[1:48:20] at
[1:48:21] Just like he did with Moses the same
[1:48:24] way.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Brown said,
[1:48:28] "There's that red dragon. The devil,
[1:48:30] where's his seat at?" Not in Russia, in
[1:48:32] Rome. Amen. And the devil gave him his
[1:48:34] seed and his authority. Amen. Listen.
[1:48:36] And he goes on to say, "And the red
[1:48:38] dragon, amen, stood there before that
[1:48:40] woman. And as soon as a woman's
[1:48:41] delivered of the child, amen, he was
[1:48:43] there to devour that child as soon as it
[1:48:46] was brought forth." Amen. Now, amen. He
[1:48:48] said that was a Israelite church. Amen.
[1:48:51] And there the red dragon to devour her
[1:48:53] child which was Jesus as soon as he was
[1:48:55] born. Amen. Herod issued the
[1:48:57] proclamation. Amen. To kill all the
[1:48:59] children. The very things that same
[1:49:01] thing that Pharaoh done to catch Moses
[1:49:04] which was a type of Christ and
[1:49:06] slaughtered all the children. Amen. But
[1:49:08] they missed him
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; because God knows how to hide them.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Oh, aren't you
[1:49:18] Aren't you glad you're hid?
[1:49:21] Oh, there's a hiding place. Amen. The
[1:49:24] Bible said, Amen, that we are dead and
[1:49:26] and and our lives are hidden God in
[1:49:29] Christ. Amen. The prophet of God said,
[1:49:31] Amen, that that's exactly what Herod was
[1:49:33] trying to do was the same thing Pharaoh
[1:49:35] was trying to do was to kill that seed,
[1:49:38] to stop the promise.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; But God knows how to hide his seed.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And God hid Moses.
[1:49:48] Amen. And God hid Jesus Christ. Is that
[1:49:51] right? And he said, "And you are here,
[1:49:52] too."
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are here, too. Listen,
[1:49:57] friends. What is this whole battle
[1:49:58] about? Satan's trying to stop the seed.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; But God knows how to hide his seed.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, there's
[1:50:07] still a hiding place today in Psalms 27.
[1:50:10] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:50:12] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[1:50:14] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[1:50:17] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[1:50:18] enemies, and my foes come to eat of my
[1:50:20] flesh, they stumbled and fail. And
[1:50:22] though a host should encamp against me,
[1:50:24] and this, amen, my heart shall not fear,
[1:50:26] the war should rise against me. And this
[1:50:28] will I be confident. One thing have I
[1:50:30] desired of the Lord, that I will seek
[1:50:33] after, that I may dwell in the house of
[1:50:35] the Lord all the days of my life.
[1:50:38] Hallelujah. For in a time of trouble,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall set me upon a rock.
[1:50:47] Listen friends, how many knows that's
[1:50:48] the background for the rapture according
[1:50:50] to the message of the hour. And we're
[1:50:52] living in a time of trouble. And Satan
[1:50:55] is trying to stop the promise. But I
[1:50:57] want to tell the devil this morning. You
[1:50:59] come too late. Amen. And God has done
[1:51:01] hid the seed. And there's a secret
[1:51:03] place.
[1:51:06] The prophet said the devil couldn't get
[1:51:07] to you if he wanted to.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; I I I'll just say this.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:51:25] was not born in a time of convenience.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; All right. That's true.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And the circumstances were not,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; you know, think about it.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When Jesus Christ come to this
[1:51:38] earth, when when he was born,
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Rome was in power.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Sure was.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; The people of God were in in a in a
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; in captivity in a form of it, at least
[1:51:52] in
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; under Roman rule. That's right.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And and and there was trouble
[1:51:58] everywhere.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And actually, even at the time when it
[1:52:03] got real close for him to be born, they
[1:52:05] they they taxed the whole Right.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, Caesar taxed the whole earth.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Sure did.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; He sure did.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; You know, he done all that. I thought
[1:52:12] about that before. I thought, man, all
[1:52:14] them poor people having to pay taxes and
[1:52:17] travel and
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; all the in inconvenience. I mean, it
[1:52:21] wasn't just Joseph and Mary that was
[1:52:22] being inconvenient. Everybody was being
[1:52:24] inconven. And all that was happening
[1:52:26] just so that the prophecy
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; could be fulfilled
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; because he had to be born in Bethlehem.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; And all this trouble and unrest and
[1:52:37] Amen. bad circumstances and everything.
[1:52:40] Amen. And here is Mary. Amen. Riding up
[1:52:42] on her camp on her on her donkey rather.
[1:52:44] Amen. And she's heavy with child on a
[1:52:47] great journey. By the way, brother Brown
[1:52:48] said here she was heavy with child on a
[1:52:51] great journey. And I got to thinking
[1:52:52] about that and I thought, think about
[1:52:53] that. Here we are. Amen. Listen friends.
[1:52:55] This ain't the most convenient time to
[1:52:57] be a Christian.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; This is not the most convenient time to
[1:53:02] live holiness. This ain't the most
[1:53:04] convenient time to believe what you
[1:53:06] believe. Amen. This ain't the most
[1:53:08] convenient time for there to be a
[1:53:10] rapture. Amen. For God to have a bride.
[1:53:12] Amen. But do you realize, friends, that
[1:53:14] all this was done that the word of God
[1:53:16] might be fulfilled. Amen. Listen, all
[1:53:19] the stuff you see around you. Amen. In
[1:53:21] the condition of the age that you live
[1:53:23] in ain't nothing but prophecy being
[1:53:25] fulfilled. Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And it ain't a
[1:53:30] convenient time. And here we are heavy
[1:53:34] with child and great burdens on our life
[1:53:37] and we're on a great journey. But
[1:53:39] church, I want to encourage you. We're
[1:53:41] on our way down to Bethlehem. Even our
[1:53:44] hour of deliverance is near. Come on,
[1:53:47] church. This ain't the time to give up.
[1:53:49] This ain't the time to look back. This
[1:53:51] ain't the time to give in. This ain't
[1:53:53] the time to compromise. I tell you what
[1:53:55] we need to do. Travail. Press on. Refuse
[1:53:59] to be comforted.
[1:54:03] Hallelujah. Let us be like Rachel this
[1:54:06] morning. Amen. And say, "I will not
[1:54:07] accept any argument."
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I'm just going to preach
[1:54:13] right here for a little while. Amen. I'm
[1:54:14] telling you. Amen. We got to come to a
[1:54:16] place as a bride of Jesus Christ that we
[1:54:18] quit letting people explain it away from
[1:54:20] us or put it down the road or point back
[1:54:23] to a time go in the past or sometime in
[1:54:26] the future. Listen, you got to start
[1:54:28] believing. We are the bride.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; We are that church. We are, Amen. the
[1:54:35] the bride of the last days that will
[1:54:37] bring forth Jesus Christ on the earth
[1:54:39] again.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're the overcomer of this
[1:54:43] age.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to listen to
[1:54:48] no argument against you. Don't come tell
[1:54:50] me, Amen, that Mark 16 ain't for me.
[1:54:53] Don't come tell me that St. John 14:12
[1:54:56] is not for me. No sir. Amen. Don't tell
[1:54:58] me. Amen. That's only for the apostles
[1:55:01] or that was just for one man or that was
[1:55:03] just for brother Brandham and we can't
[1:55:05] have it. Listen, I refuse to be
[1:55:07] comforted. I refuse to accept any
[1:55:10] argument.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's our promise. Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe, amen, that we can't
[1:55:21] have young people that can overcome in
[1:55:23] this age.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe, amen, that we can't
[1:55:28] have a church that's full, amen, of the
[1:55:30] life of Jesus Christ. I refuse, amen, to
[1:55:33] believe
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; that the God of this message is not
[1:55:38] still the same, amen, the same today.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:46] Good preaching.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; I I won't accept any argument.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Windle read this quote
[1:55:57] last night. I was actually praying
[1:56:01] and I I'd asked the Lord, you know, hey,
[1:56:05] you
[1:56:06] you come to meetings and things and
[1:56:10] sometimes you have a lot of things you'd
[1:56:12] like to preach. And
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; that was where I was at. You know, just
[1:56:16] so many things and you're trying to go
[1:56:20] through this thought and that thought
[1:56:21] and you're just praying and
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; sometimes the thing God inspires you,
[1:56:25] you just say, "Man, I I really don't
[1:56:27] want to preach that
[1:56:29] and find yourself arguing with the
[1:56:30] Lord." And
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; and but you'll find out like who was it?
[1:56:36] Jeremiah in the Bible, he said, "I found
[1:56:37] out God's greater than I am.
[1:56:42] It's like a fire shut up in my bones.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, I was just praying,
[1:56:48] God, lead me. Show me. Just let And I I
[1:56:50] come to church. I said, Lord, just let
[1:56:52] brother Windle say something
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; that would give me direction that would
[1:56:56] let me know that your will is, you know,
[1:56:59] friends, I'll just be honest with you.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; You know, we've been in this thing for a
[1:57:05] while now, and
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; I just come to a place of realize that
[1:57:08] good sermons don't really amount to a
[1:57:09] whole lot.
[1:57:12] It's finding the mind of God.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach good sermons. I
[1:57:17] want to help somebody.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; When I get done this morning, if y'all
[1:57:21] thought, "Man, that guy's crazy." And
[1:57:23] man, I
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; if just one person could be helped.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; That's all that matters to me.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, after all, the Bible said it's a
[1:57:32] foolishness of preaching. That's right.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; You know, brother, brother Windle come
[1:57:37] to a place in his in his message and
[1:57:40] just the whole direction, you know, of
[1:57:42] being desperate and things like that.
[1:57:43] And
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; then he read this quote and I had this
[1:57:46] quote. I just been reading it before I
[1:57:50] come to church. And the prophet of God
[1:57:52] said, "We find out that the modern
[1:57:54] church, a modern world church,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen." He said, "And and also there's a
[1:57:58] spiritual church, and they're both
[1:58:00] pregnantated
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; to give birth to sons.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; One of them, a denominational birth, is
[1:58:06] going to give one of these days." Amen.
[1:58:08] At the World Council of Churches wi
[1:58:10] which will produce to the world the
[1:58:12] Antichrist through a denomination.
[1:58:14] That's exactly the truth. A I may not
[1:58:16] live to see it. I believe I will. But
[1:58:17] you young people remember that you heard
[1:58:19] a minister say that. Amen. It'll finally
[1:58:21] wind up. It's the mark of the beast when
[1:58:23] she forms the world council of churches
[1:58:25] and she'll give birth to her son, the
[1:58:28] antichrist.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; The other is pregnant by the word of God
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; and will bring forth the body, the
[1:58:33] finished body of Jesus Christ, which is
[1:58:36] the bride.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; The body of Christ isn't finished yet.
[1:58:39] How many knows that a man and woman is
[1:58:41] one? Christ is one body. The word, the
[1:58:43] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:58:45] body.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; So, if there's a bride that's
[1:58:49] pregnantated,
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends. I
[1:58:52] I just feel to say this before I go on
[1:58:54] any further. Amen. Once you get to that
[1:58:56] spot, Amen. You ain't no changing it.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; You're going to travail whether you want
[1:59:03] to or if you don't.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Travail will come on you.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I know they got stuff
[1:59:12] today and they can give a woman a shot
[1:59:13] and it can prolong it and it can stop
[1:59:15] labor and it can, you know, all that,
[1:59:17] but they they can only do that so long.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; After a while, she's going to have a
[1:59:22] child.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Whether she wants it or not, it's
[1:59:25] coming.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the pains will come on her.
[1:59:29] The travail will come on. Come on,
[1:59:31] church. We ain't trying to fast our way
[1:59:32] into a rapture. Amen. The it's coming on
[1:59:35] us.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because a seed is planted in
[1:59:39] you. You're already pregnantated by the
[1:59:43] word of God. And the labor pains is
[1:59:45] coming upon us. We shall be delivered.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it this morning.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, there's only one
[1:59:59] comfort we will accept. Amen. We won't
[2:00:02] accept any argument. Amen. We won't
[2:00:04] accept any comfort. I mean, I can just
[2:00:06] imagine, oh, Jacob, coming down to
[2:00:08] Rachel and say, "Oh, Rachel, honey, I
[2:00:10] love you. It don't matter if you have
[2:00:12] any children or if you don't, I love you
[2:00:14] anyhow. Don't you know, I think you're
[2:00:15] so beautiful. I I worked 14 years to
[2:00:18] have you." Amen. You know, Amen. And
[2:00:20] he's trying to pat her on the back. You
[2:00:22] ain't got to have no children, baby.
[2:00:23] Hey, listen. Amen. You're my wife.
[2:00:25] You're my queen. Amen. But she would not
[2:00:27] re She refused that comfort. She refused
[2:00:31] to be comforted. She didn't let nobody
[2:00:33] tell you, "You're good like you are.
[2:00:35] You're pretty like you are. You ain't
[2:00:37] got to have that manifestation of the
[2:00:39] word. Amen. Just be a good church. Just
[2:00:42] be a good Christian. Oh, come on. Just
[2:00:45] be a good church member. That's all you
[2:00:47] got to do. That's good enough. Amen. She
[2:00:49] refused the argument. She said, "You
[2:00:51] give me a son or I'll die." And I
[2:00:54] believe there's a bride that's got the
[2:00:55] same attitude. You give me the word or
[2:00:58] I'll die.
[2:01:00] I'm going to tell you this. There was
[2:01:01] only one thing that comforted Rachel and
[2:01:03] that's when she took a son in her arms
[2:01:08] and she held the word,
[2:01:11] the manifestation of the word. Oh
[2:01:14] church, I want to tell you, there's only
[2:01:16] one thing that'll comfort this bride.
[2:01:18] It's the manifestation of the word of
[2:01:20] God in this hour.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I tell you what'll comfort us. It's
[2:01:27] called thus sayith the Lord.
[2:01:30] That's right.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's going to comfort us.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Let me let me try to
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what time I started.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; It's all right.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; But just a few more minutes
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; because you think about, you know,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I got to think about that woman in
[2:01:52] Memphis.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Come on.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; And and and remember, God gave her a
[2:01:59] son.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; And and and and God gave her that son.
[2:02:04] And brother Daryl, she you know, I just
[2:02:08] if y'all allow me, I'll just dramatize a
[2:02:10] little bit, but I'm not trying to add to
[2:02:11] the story. And I'm not trying to say it
[2:02:14] was that way. I'm just saying maybe it
[2:02:16] could have been this way.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; You know, her boy got sick and he was
[2:02:19] dying. Maybe some of the neighbors
[2:02:21] stopped by and said, "Hey, if there's
[2:02:23] anything we can do,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; you know, we we bring food or
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; uh you know, if there's anything we can
[2:02:29] do,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; that's all right."
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; And and and you know, they were trying
[2:02:31] to comfort her and
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; and maybe you know, others stopped by
[2:02:34] and say, you know, honey, we're going to
[2:02:36] be praying for you. God give you grace
[2:02:37] to go through this. Looks like the
[2:02:39] Lord's going to take your boy home. And
[2:02:41] you know, and they meant well and then
[2:02:43] I'm not trying to say anything against
[2:02:44] that. and they they had good well good
[2:02:47] intentions and you know just trying to
[2:02:49] comfort her heart and you know well
[2:02:50] you'll see him again and you know and
[2:02:53] and you know but there was something in
[2:02:54] her heart she wouldn't she wouldn't
[2:02:56] accept the comfort
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; she said God gave me this boy
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; and you know what she did she went in
[2:03:02] this Bible and she found herself
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; and she said Lord you showed me I'm that
[2:03:06] shinomite woman and my womb was barren
[2:03:09] but you gave me a son but now my son is
[2:03:12] sick and he's on his deathbed amen but
[2:03:14] If I'm that Shinomite woman, where's
[2:03:15] your Elijah? Hallelujah. Amen. In her
[2:03:18] desperation, Amen. Grounded a plane over
[2:03:21] in Memphis. And Elijah, amen, was guided
[2:03:24] by the Holy Spirit. Go right to her
[2:03:26] house. Come on, church. Why? Because she
[2:03:29] would not accept any argument of
[2:03:31] comfort. Amen. There was nobody could
[2:03:33] talk her out of it. Amen. Her revelation
[2:03:35] was God gave me the boy and God's going
[2:03:37] to heal the boy. Come on. I tell you, is
[2:03:40] there any mama in here feels like that
[2:03:41] this morning? Amen. Maybe you got waver
[2:03:44] children. If that woman in Memphis could
[2:03:46] believe for the healing of her son, why
[2:03:48] can't you believe for the salvation of
[2:03:50] your children? And I don't care where
[2:03:52] they are. I don't care what kind of
[2:03:54] Listen, they might be in drugs. They
[2:03:55] might be alcoholics. Amen. They might
[2:03:59] Come on, church. Amen. But if God gave
[2:04:01] them to you, Amen. Lay a claim on it
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; and refuse to be comforted.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; What about that? that that that mother
[2:04:13] down there in Mexico.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; She had a little baby and the baby died
[2:04:19] that morning.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And the doctor, Amen, already declared
[2:04:22] that baby dead. But that woman heard
[2:04:25] there was some meetings going on and and
[2:04:27] that the man of God, Amen, had come down
[2:04:30] there and there was great miracles
[2:04:32] taking place and that God had used him
[2:04:34] to raise the dead. Amen. And that woman,
[2:04:37] Amen, hey, she refused it. She refused
[2:04:39] to be comforted. She refused any
[2:04:42] argument against it.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. She pressed her way through and
[2:04:45] the prophet of God said 100 ushers
[2:04:47] couldn't stop her.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; She climbed right over the top of them.
[2:04:53] Amen. She was so desperate and kept
[2:04:56] pressing until even the prophet looked
[2:04:57] at her and said he turned and looked. I
[2:04:59] believe Jack Moore, one of them brothers
[2:05:00] standing there. He said, "You just go on
[2:05:02] down and pray for her. She ain't going
[2:05:03] to know the difference anyhow." In other
[2:05:05] words, even brother Bama's going to try
[2:05:07] to comfort her.
[2:05:09] Just go on down there, brother Jack. Go
[2:05:10] on down there and comfort her. Lay your
[2:05:13] hands on her. Just, you know, try to
[2:05:14] appease her a little bit. Amen. Comfort
[2:05:16] her. Just pray for the, you know, and he
[2:05:18] said, but about the time, Amen, that he
[2:05:20] said that, he turned and looked back
[2:05:21] over the audience. He said, wait just a
[2:05:23] minute. He said, you bring out that
[2:05:26] woman to me. He said, cuz he saw a
[2:05:28] little Mexican baby smiling.
[2:05:31] Hallelujah. A vision broke. The baby was
[2:05:35] healed. I want to say this is what when
[2:05:37] we get a church like the woman in
[2:05:40] Memphis and when we get a church like
[2:05:42] the mother in Mexico, I tell you what
[2:05:45] you're going to see. You're going to see
[2:05:47] backsliders restored. You're going to
[2:05:49] see the sick heal. You're going to see
[2:05:50] life changed.
[2:05:54] Hallelujah. Don't tell me it ain't it
[2:05:57] ain't a reality. I tell you it is.
[2:06:01] I tell you this is a testimony. My
[2:06:03] wife's sitting right back there. Amen.
[2:06:05] She's got brothers. She's got a bunch of
[2:06:07] them. She's got six. Amen. And cut two
[2:06:09] of them was in our church. Amen. But
[2:06:12] Amen. She had a a lot of her brothers
[2:06:14] was just living in sin. And Amen. Not
[2:06:17] even serving God. Amen. And I I watched
[2:06:19] her pray. Amen. And claim and pray.
[2:06:23] Amen. And and she just kept holding on.
[2:06:25] Amen. And and six, eight months ago, I
[2:06:28] don't even know how long it was. Amen.
[2:06:30] And one of her brothers, which was
[2:06:32] actually the one that Hey, we've been
[2:06:33] through like all y'all too.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; We've seen everything around this
[2:06:38] message.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; All kind of nonsense and hurts and
[2:06:42] church hurts and we've been hurt by
[2:06:44] preachers and
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; And these boys have been scarred by
[2:06:50] these things.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; And her one brother was so bitter.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, just, you know, bitter
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; against the message.
[2:07:00] and
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden, God starts dealing
[2:07:04] that boy's heart. I don't I didn't even
[2:07:05] know it was happening.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; He's he's listening to tapes.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, man.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Then one day, one of our other brothers
[2:07:14] told me, he said,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; he's listening to our services.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; And I'd been on a series in over in the
[2:07:20] book of Hebrews, and I've been
[2:07:21] preaching, and I'd already covered some
[2:07:23] of the verses, and and God started
[2:07:25] dealing my heart. And I thought, Lord, I
[2:07:27] done preached that.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:29] I mean, we I need to move on. I'm slow
[2:07:31] enough as it is. I mean, I've been
[2:07:33] preaching in he Hebrews for two years
[2:07:35] already. And I need to move on.
[2:07:40] And and I I I and and I, you know,
[2:07:42] again, I found myself arguing with the
[2:07:44] Lord. Went to church that morning. I got
[2:07:46] to preaching and the Lord was inspiring
[2:07:48] me in certain verses there in Hebrews.
[2:07:50] And I got to preaching on the prodigal
[2:07:51] son.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; I turned and looked and there said her
[2:07:56] brother.
[2:07:58] Oh yes.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; And he ain't missed he ain't missed
[2:08:02] hardly a service since
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; completely surrendered his heart to God.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; She had another brother
[2:08:12] and and and he was he's a good boy.
[2:08:15] Lived a good life, you know, but just,
[2:08:16] you know, didn't go to church. He served
[2:08:18] God. Ain't interested.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:21] The next thing, right after our meetings
[2:08:23] we just had in June, one day he text me
[2:08:26] and he said, he said, "I don't know how
[2:08:28] to say this." He said, "But I got to be
[2:08:30] saved."
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know how to do it."
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I just need you to tell me how
[2:08:36] to be saved."
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; And I led that boy to Christ and just
[2:08:41] baptized him just two weeks ago.
[2:08:48] She still got another one out there. But
[2:08:50] he's coming too. I tell you what, that's
[2:08:53] what'll happen when you refuse to be
[2:08:55] comforted. I won't accept no argument
[2:08:58] against it. Hallelujah. Amen. I refuse
[2:09:01] to let anybody tell me anything
[2:09:03] different. If God said he'll heal me,
[2:09:05] he'll heal me. If God said he'll give me
[2:09:07] my family, that's what he's going to do.
[2:09:10] And I refuse any argument against you.
[2:09:12] Amen. I tell you what, I believe that
[2:09:15] was there's some Rachel's in the house
[2:09:16] of God. Hallelujah. Amen. And we refuse.
[2:09:20] Amen. We got the same attitude like
[2:09:22] Hannah.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I might be barren, but God
[2:09:28] will open my room. The conditions might
[2:09:31] be getting worse.
[2:09:34] Come on, church. Amen. This ain't an our
[2:09:36] convenience, but the travail has come.
[2:09:41] Hallelujah.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you this in closing as the
[2:09:48] musicians come this morning.
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Amen. Thus sayeth the
[2:09:58] Lord,
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; refrain thy voice from weeping."
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. and thine eyes from tears.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; For the works, for the works shall be
[2:10:07] rewarded,
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord, and they shall come
[2:10:12] again from the land of the enemy, and
[2:10:15] there is hope in thine end, sayeth the
[2:10:18] Lord, thy children shall come again to
[2:10:21] their own border. Amen. I tell you,
[2:10:23] that's the only comfort that the bride
[2:10:25] of Christ will accept is the comfort of
[2:10:28] thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. I will
[2:10:31] not be denied. I will not turn back. I
[2:10:34] won't be talked out of it. I might as
[2:10:36] well say it. I don't care how many books
[2:10:38] they write. I don't care how many
[2:10:39] websites they build. I don't care what
[2:10:41] they say about the message. I refuse to
[2:10:44] be comforted. Hallelujah. This message
[2:10:46] is rapturing grace. It's going to change
[2:10:49] my body. Hallelujah. And the only
[2:10:52] comfort I will accept is a manifested
[2:10:55] word. Brother, I tell you, your comfort
[2:10:57] is coming. Because one of these mornings
[2:11:00] between 6:00 and 9, a sweep is going to
[2:11:02] sweep over and the old is going to be
[2:11:06] gone
[2:11:08] and our bodies are going to be changed.
[2:11:11] There's going to be a resurrection,
[2:11:13] friends. And that is the comfort of this
[2:11:16] bride. Thus sayeth the Lord, brother
[2:11:19] Dale, your work shall be rewarded.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Andrew, your work
[2:11:25] shall be rewarded.
[2:11:28] Yes.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, mama. Your work shall be
[2:11:30] rewarded.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; And your children shall come again.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Can I show it to you in the scripture?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; As we as we just stand our feet,
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; first Thessalonians 4:16.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's comfort.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself.
[2:11:57] shall ascend from heaven with a shout.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; And the voice of the archangel and the
[2:12:02] trump of God and the dead in Christ
[2:12:04] shall rise first.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen friends, don't tell
[2:12:08] me my comfort's already on the way.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Because a shout is already happened.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord is already descending.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as he's coming, he's
[2:12:18] bringing my comfort with him.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we which are alive and remain
[2:12:23] shall be caught up together with him in
[2:12:25] the clouds and meet the Lord in the air.
[2:12:27] And so will we ever be with the Lord.
[2:12:29] Wherefore, comfort one another with
[2:12:32] these words. Come on, listen friends. I
[2:12:35] won't accept the comfort. Don't tell me
[2:12:38] I can't be a part of the bride. It ain't
[2:12:40] for me. It's not for my day. I refuse
[2:12:43] that. But if you want to comfort me,
[2:12:45] just start telling me this. The Lord has
[2:12:47] come. The message is here. Hallelujah.
[2:12:50] Rapturing grace has been given.
[2:12:52] Hallelujah. Comfort one another with
[2:12:55] these words.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's try to sing, brother. I would
[2:13:04] not be denied.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can try this morning.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When pains of death cease,
[2:13:13] oh my soul.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:26] I would not be denied.
[2:13:30] Oh, I would not be denied.
[2:13:36] I would not be denied
[2:13:41] till Jesus came. He made me whole. I
[2:13:47] would not be denied.
[2:13:52] I shake up in the days of old. I wrestle
[2:13:58] with the Lord.
[2:14:02] And in stood with a courage bold, I
[2:14:08] stood upon his word.
[2:14:12] Oh, I would not be denied.
[2:14:18] I would not be denied.
[2:14:22] Till Jesus came, he made me whole. I
[2:14:28] would not be ding out.
[2:14:33] Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[2:14:39] would not hear my prayer.
[2:14:44] Praise
[2:14:46] the work
[2:14:49] and the Lord.
[2:14:53] Oh, I would not be.
[2:15:02] You feel that way.
[2:15:06] He made me whole. I would not be denied.
[2:15:14] Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[2:15:20] could not.
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:40] I would not be
[2:15:45] till Jesus came. He made me whole. I
[2:15:50] would not be. One more time with all my
[2:15:54] heart. Oh
[2:15:56] my
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:16:01] good.
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:13] Sing it one more time as a declaration.
[2:16:16] I would not be
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:26] Jesus.
[2:16:28] He made me
[2:16:32] not.
[2:16:35] Give the Lord a great hand of praise.
[2:16:38] Hallelujah.
[2:16:40] I refuse to be talked out of it.
[2:16:45] Don't try to comfort me.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll bring forth life.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; This bride, you are the bride.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I told the church
[2:16:59] right after they elected the pope out of
[2:17:01] America,
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; you know, they said they even the
[2:17:06] Catholic Church, you go study it. Yeah,
[2:17:09] I was, you know, reading all kind of
[2:17:12] news and articles building up to that
[2:17:13] and they said people are saying it's a
[2:17:15] it's a
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; it's a long shot.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; There ain't no chance.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Even the Catholic Church said
[2:17:21] themselves, they said, "We'll never have
[2:17:22] a pope out of America as long as she's a
[2:17:24] superpower."
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; But Bible prophecy
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; See, that's what they didn't factor in
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; was Revelations 13.
[2:17:37] And the prophet stood and looked at the
[2:17:38] prophecy and said, "According to the
[2:17:39] prophecy, there's a pope will rise up
[2:17:41] out of America."
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; But friends, don't forget the rest of
[2:17:43] that.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "At that time, there'll be a
[2:17:46] church." Now, I'll tell you this. I
[2:17:48] don't know. I'll say this.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; There's never been a pope out of
[2:17:52] America. Now, there is one.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; We don't know if he's the Antichrist. I
[2:17:56] mean, how could we know that? But but
[2:17:57] there's a pope out of America.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Never happened before, and it's happened
[2:18:01] now. Come on.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; But I can say, well, I don't really know
[2:18:04] if that man is the actual man that will
[2:18:07] fulfill all the
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you one thing,
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; the rest of that quote,
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; he said, "At that time, there'll be a
[2:18:15] church
[2:18:17] so bound together by the love of God."
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Now, church, I don't know if that's the
[2:18:21] right man, but I know you're the right
[2:18:23] church.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:29] I believe the prophecy is being
[2:18:30] fulfilled. And don't tell me if God can
[2:18:33] put a man in the in the Vatican and God
[2:18:36] can put Russia in her position and God
[2:18:38] can put a president in the White House.
[2:18:41] Don't tell me he can't put a bride in
[2:18:42] the rapture.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; We are that church. We are that church
[2:18:48] that will rise up with the power of God
[2:18:50] that'll speak the word. Amen. And
[2:18:53] lightning will flash. Listen friends,
[2:18:54] the thing that the prophet said, the
[2:18:56] thing that the scripture said, Amen.
[2:18:58] Don't put it off to another age. Don't
[2:19:00] let nobody talk you out of it. You're
[2:19:02] the people.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; You are
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I love you with all my
[2:19:08] heart.

[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; He thought we were worth saving. I
[2:20:18] believe he's he thinks enough of us to

[2:20:41] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:20:43] the surge of the Holy Spirit we feel in
[2:20:45] this building this morning. Father, as
[2:20:48] your word was ministered in power and
[2:20:50] demonstration,
[2:20:51] Lord, we thank you for the truth, Lord.
[2:20:54] And we thank you that you've sent us a
[2:20:56] comforter at this hour, Father, to
[2:20:58] comfort our hearts, that you would not
[2:21:00] leave us fatherless, Lord. You would not
[2:21:02] leave us headless, Lord. You would not
[2:21:04] leave us in confusion, but Lord, you
[2:21:06] would send us a promise. Now, Lord,
[2:21:09] these things we've heard this morning,
[2:21:10] Lord, may it not be just another sermon.
[2:21:13] Father, may it not be just another good
[2:21:15] time in your presence, but Lord, Father,
[2:21:18] may it become strength as Abraham nursed
[2:21:20] from El Shadi, Lord. Father, may we
[2:21:22] nurse from the promises of God we've
[2:21:24] heard this morning. Nursing into our
[2:21:27] body the strength to bring forth this
[2:21:28] miracle, Lord. Father, I pray you bless
[2:21:31] your servant this morning. May you
[2:21:32] anoint him, Lord. May you, Father,
[2:21:34] restore everything to him that he's
[2:21:36] poured out here today. Father, as we
[2:21:38] prepare for the evening, I pray you
[2:21:40] would anoint your servant, Brother
[2:21:41] Daryl. Lord, Father, may you pour into
[2:21:44] him everything we have need of, Father.
[2:21:46] Lord, may faith be increased in the
[2:21:48] building this morning, oh God. That
[2:21:50] Lord, needs would be met here tonight,
[2:21:52] Father. Your will would be performed, oh
[2:21:54] God. Lord, may healing take place here
[2:21:56] tonight, Father. We are looking to you,
[2:21:58] the God of miracles, Lord, as we prepare
[2:22:01] to depart from this place today, Lord.
[2:22:03] Father, may we not leave here and leave
[2:22:05] you in this building, but may we take
[2:22:07] you with us, Lord. And Father, may we
[2:22:09] prepare our hearts for the service.
[2:22:10] Bless the food that's been prepared,
[2:22:12] Lord. Lord, bless the hands that have
[2:22:14] prepared and all the efforts and labors
[2:22:16] that's gone into it, Lord. May you
[2:22:18] reward the servants, Lord. May you give
[2:22:20] them their portion, Lord. I pray as
[2:22:22] they're serving your bride so faithfully
[2:22:24] here this weekend. Now, Father, we
[2:22:26] commit this meeting and this day in thy
[2:22:28] faithful hands. We love you and thank
[2:22:30] you for visiting with us this morning.
