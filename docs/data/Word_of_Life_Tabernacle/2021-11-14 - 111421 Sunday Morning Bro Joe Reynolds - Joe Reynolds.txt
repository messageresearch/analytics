the lord with you amen just turn you you've got your bibles this this morning it's it's just turned to ephesians chapter one verse three man technology huh you got to love it then you got to hate it amen we'd like to minister just uh this morning on flourishing in the courts of our god and let's hear in ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 it says blessed be the god and father of the lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to his good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of the grace where in he hath made us already accepted in the beloved amen god bless you can have your seats this morning hey band so i was looking at this actually wednesday night and and i was preaching a little thought actually on he had made us and i was looking at the parallel between joshua and ephesians here that uh after the death of moses and how the new administration was going to come in power and authority and and i got to thinking about how god rich in mercy has um has already before the foundation of the world and you know blessed us and and brother brown said it like this that he placed that the wedding band of grace upon your finger before the foundation of the world so we want to look this morning just for a few moments i'm flourishing in the courts of our god and and i got to thinking about how that how that god was a spirit and how that he was in that spirit form that every attribute there ever was going to be was laying right there he was wanting to be a father he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer and a bed so the condescending down of almighty god he was a spirit so he was he was god above us and he been so when he had a plan that he was going to become a redeemer and then his plan was provided in jesus christ so is god with us so god was condemned sending down to humanity that he wanted to become you he been that you can become him by grace and so we when the holy ghost was provided it produced what what god had had in his mind before the foundation of the world god above us god in us and my what a perfect family heading back to a garden time experience again so let's pick it up here brother brown said he had made us there are certain truths that we won't need to emphasize and this is one of them he he have made us salvation is his doing he has made us it's his work salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for that purpose he brought us for that purpose he bought us for that person purpose we are kings and spiritual kings oh he said we're going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sets on the throne but now can you say now with me this morning we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom and he said colossians 1 13 says who had delivered us from the power of darkness has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son catch this now this morning says right now we reign with christ having dominion in other words having power over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and his glory showing forth himself have been the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the god above us god with us now god in us right now reigning with christ have a dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praises and his glory he said showing forth himself do you like that this morning for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are setting in heavenly places in christ jesus what a position to be in this morning amen then now that we had a message of the hour he had a a prophetic gift in this hour he better caught a glimpse of the uh of the mind of god and it came and brought it to to you and i as believers blessed are your ears that you can hear and blessed are your eyes that you can see and hey bestow the message begin to declare that we are free and we begin to declare where we came from if we know where we came from we know where we're going and this present day that we're living in we can live victorious knowing hey but nothing on earth no power of hell could ever stop the plan of god's redemption hey before he said in his word he couldn't lose one of us do you believe that it's impossible for god to lose one of us amen and we had a message in this hour to begin to declare true justification amen that he wasn't an initiator but he began to restore all those truths and begin to pound together and brought a picture of grace to you and i that amen that we can begin to see true justification as though you've never done it in the first place they better told you that you was a part of god before the foundation of the world and he been told you that sister jamie that you was never a chick and you always was an eagle because if you was a son you always was a son amen and it would begin to tell us little stories and and how that began to echo in our hearts and everybody told us about the three hebrew children how that they would have been beginning to walk to death row and before they ever got there that the prophet god said that the lord jesus or god rather a bed took the heat out of the fire and let the fire keep burning on hey but what he did he took the very element to destroy them out of the picture and that's exactly what happened that day at calvary he bet he took it he said he'd allow the fire to keep burning on but he took the very element to destroy you out of the equation hey man so he began to catch these little nuggets up from the message of the hour and because we see where we came from and we'll see where we're going we can live victorious in 2021 knowing if god before us who can be against us you believe that this morning and because we know where we came from and we know that we came from god we're going back to god and my says plan of redemption now john 4 13 says jesus answers said unto her whosoever drank of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life even in other words this water is not going to forsake you hey but actually the word everlasting comes from a greek word meaning a adios it never had a beginning and never can't have it in even that which always has been and always will be and it can never cease it could never go into extinct amen what a god race in this hour they've been there was god above us amen that had a plan then it was god with us jesus provided the plan that god had abandoned when he extended up on high he rewrapped the gift and he sent it in the form of the holy ghost with the same power with the same authority hallelujah able to come and live and you and i that we can be victorious that we can be jesus and pride form with the same power with the same anointing never to cease no wonder god our brother brandon could pick up the mind of god and say you can die no more than god can die you can no more cease than god can cease because in you hallelujah in you is a well springing up to everlasting life and hell can't put it out amen brother brown says it like this he says that when the human element goes out well that's the greatest battle and the spirit of god fills that vacancy where you empty yourself he said then will it be when church is in the power of his resurrection of the lord jesus listen to what brother brown says here he says we'll walk in his steps we'll walk in his power we'll walk in his thoughts we'll walk in his being and in his moving he said you see what i mean then your thoughts would become words and words would become material he said that's when the church is in power and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you brother man said like this he said the rod in moses hand is jesus name and his bride or the church amen if the surroundings couldn't stop moses with a rod in his hands i believe this morning amen by the grace of god i am what i am there's no surroundings going to be able to stop this bride either she's made out of stuff that just can't be bluffed it goes beyond our power it goes beyond our ability it's amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the rest like me amen he said that's when the church is in power even where's you empty yourself out and the churches and the power of the resurrection of the lord jesus no wonder brother that he said he said what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is hallelujah we pass from death unto life hallelujah my that should make you want to shout this morning amen so there's something within us there's something within you goes beyond your human ability acts 1 and 8 says but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you come means to descend and operate in one listen god isn't operating above us behind us but in us hallelujah so if you shall receive this power from this dynamo the strength of god is greater than any affliction that cometh can come upon you amen first john says it like this but you have an unction and brother said the word unction comes from a greek word that means dynamite from the dynamo and the dynamo is a in a forceful energetic being amen it provides your power it provides your strength when you're ready to give up he's a provider this morning do you believe that hey ben brother i tell you this morning hey ben be hey hey if you're not plugged into the dynamo you're going to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine wherever you're going to be ran by your emotions feelings affections memory conscience what you can see what you can hear what you can smell what you can taste or feel amen you'll be wavered by what that but praise god there is a pride that walks not by the flesh but walks by the spirit do you believe that hallelujah so when brother danny came down to my house and began to run wire we began to run wire power before you came down i couldn't run a water heater before he ran the wire and the power to get there a dynamo begin to be plugged up into that building hey but now it has the power hey man it has power to run a heater it's got powder and refrigerator hey then because there's somebody that got the power to my house from a source hallelujah it was god above us and his great spirit but he saw you brother mark before the foundation of the world he saw you living victorious over sin the world and the devil he bet so he had a plan that he's going to bring a redeemer he's going to become kin folk about so he condescending down to to a man called jesus christ and jesus was the tabernacle that god dwelt in hallelujah this wasn't just ordinary blood this was the blood of jesus christ christ which was god never had a beginning never had an end can never lose his power thank god for the blood of this innocent lamb the life of that lamb could come upon you and what a dynamo and you shall receive dynamite after you plug into the dynamo he says to make the light up there it takes two pieces of material a dynamo turning it together it's just like you it'll make light it'll make faith it'll make power it'll make healing when a believer a believer said with me this morning a believer and god not just not a church not a man but when a believer gets turning with his god i'm gonna get ahead of myself this morning when they get turning together it generates in other words it brings power or it manifests the power not of your resurrection but his resurrection see you're hooked up not with a church but a forceful energetic being i'm here to tell you god's not dead i'm here to tell you god's alive and he's living in us and this world is not our home we're just passing through hallelujah and these little bumps in the road is temporary trials are temporary battles are temporary but what's down inside of you as a believer is from god and the world can't take it away hallelujah they say 120 was up in the upper room brother brown said that great unction that great dynamite he said was in their soul that blowed out the roots of carnality that blowed out the roots of humanity hallelujah they went in as cowards but something happened he bet there was a there was a god in one man but when they came out out of the upper room there was 220 of them filled with power dynamite that had the ability to blow out carnality bitterness hatred malice strife or you hear me this morning you can try to get over those things all you want to but until the dynamite begins to blow up the power of almighty god down inside of you begins to blow it out you'll never get rid of it you can hide it you can put it under a rug somewhere but it'll raise its ugly head again but let me tell you friends if you ever get this dynamo hey bent down in your soul and begin to turn together he'll take the very desire out of your heart do you believe that hallelujah blow it out he said your glorified body is standing near you right now in christ jesus to give you a strength like a charge going into a battery he said the holy spirit's in you it's a charge your body to give you a new strength to heal you from your sickness to make you well hallelujah amen so you're standing right next to you sister carla is a glorified body amen so you can hook up to this dynamo and draw a new strength it'll charge your body your body's what gives you problems as to this morning amen the problem god said it like this the word will correct the error hey ben this that word will begin to throw this body in other words it's going to be a battle it's going to be a trial it's not going to come easy but this word will throw this body under subjection to his word hallelujah what is it you're standing right next to the strength giver hey when you're plugged up to a dynamo not to a church baby if you're hooked to the church hey man you'll be here today and gone tomorrow but if you ever get hooked up to this dynamo it doesn't matter who hurts your feelings it doesn't matter what somebody does to you doesn't matter what uh what this that or the other what matters if you're hooked up to a source that you can never lose even death doesn't do nothing to you but only changes your dwelling place do you believe that now psalms 92 and 13 says those that be planted in the house of the lord those that are plugged up to the source the dynamo shell the word shell just simply means must brother bobby and can if you're planted in the house of the lord you must and can flourish which means to grow achieve bud bring forth thrive flowers sudden burst if you're plugged up to this dynamo you're going to grow you're going to achieve you're going to abide you're going to bring forth you're going to thrive you're going to fly in the courts of our god hallelujah hey but in other words amen it doesn't matter what comes our way today we're going to lift our hands up real high and say hallelujah anyhow he's been whining because he's holding on the other side hey then our chest master says there's something within us a fire that is burning that light that's been lit by god don't you like that this morning it wasn't lit by a man if it's lit by a man a man can blow it out but he said this there's something within you a fire that's a burning that's not lit by man but lit by god and no say it with me this morning no priestess can blow it out are you hearing me this morning there's no coach spells in the church he says he says there's no persecution of the world can blow out the flame that god has lit for it's god's purpose that the torchlight of freedom will burn unto the coming of the lord and no powers can blow it out they would only make it burn that much brighter as they blow now keep that in mind this morning he said when you die out to yourself a new picture starts on the inside then that new creature christ jesus began to show itself through and one of these days he will come and receive you unto himself then the whole thing will be changed he said then the negative shadow will become the positive hallelujah that part of you that never had a beginning he said the kingdom of god is coming the kingdom of god is coming it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it being see he said we're just drawing closer to god all the time therefore when the positive becomes closer to the negative the negative is swallowed up in the positive listen friends darkness cannot swallow up light but light can swallow up darkness the negative can't swallow up the positive the deposit were built to possess the gates of his enemy hallelujah no wonder paul would say like no corruption corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality he been oh death this is not just a saying paul was seeing the victory faith is the victory that overcomes the world and the prophet said if you believe it it causes a substance and that substance creates a perfect faith and that perfect faith masters every circumstance so no matter what you're facing this morning if you would take god at his word and believe it and that believing causes a substance and that substance is a direct positive and that direct positive creates a perfect faith hallelujah and that perfect faith has the ability to master every circumstance no wonder paul said oh death where is this thing he was looking death right in the face but he wasn't seeing what the world was saying hey then he looked past it not just a saying he meant that what was happening death was being swallowed up of the positive death he was looking at it remember we don't have to take the stinger from death god jesus christ already done it hallelujah that that this greatest weapon already was defeated that day at calvary hallelujah and we're beneficiary of that no wonder paul was looking right and death in the face with a natural high sister allison but he would scream out oh death where is dasting grey where is thy victory but thanks be to god which given us a victory through our lord jesus christ he been darkness cannot swallow up light but like the negative amen begin to be swallowed up of the positive and that's what's going to happen church as we are drawing closer to god even this world a man that doesn't have no ties on us at all and we're going to walk right out of this dimension into that dimension hey but in this negative amen was going to be swallowed up from the positive that part of you that never had a beginning and never will have an end and that positive is down inside of your soul right now every time you fall every time you make a mistake everybody down inside of humanity is laying the churn seat of life hallelujah and that is the positive because brother brown said it like this he said he took a picture of you he been and placed it on file before the foundation of the world amen he said that's the absolute that's the positive this is only the negative we're born of a woman in a few days and full of trouble hallelujah but down inside of you amen we don't receive the seed out of the altar we always was the seed amen you was born in this world you weren't born to chicken you was born to eagle you might not know that for so long but when that and that scream come past your way when that shout came forth amen blessed all your ears are here and your eyes to see amen it was a predestinated moment of time hey man there's nothing can ever blow it out something down inside of you is drawing you back where you came from amen now john tells us no man can come to me except the father draw with him draw means from an inward power drawn caused by to be moved and continuous toward to come or attract a an attractive force listen what he says here all the fathers has sent me will draw him and i don't you like that this morning not you not your church not a man not a prophet but he says and i will raise him up at the last day another word sister betty he that begun this good work in you is also going to bring it to an end he's the author and the finisher of our faith he said in christ the mystery of god the first even knew it but she failed but this echoes she'll know it but she can't fall why because he's came himself he condemned send it down back to humanity that he can live in you and live a victorious life for you that you can overcome lady osea not by your own abilities by his grace hallelujah i will raise them up those that are planted in the house of my god they've been those that has plugged up to the dynamo i will lift them up i will cause them amen to continue or to come to be attractive hallelujah like a little dewdrop he bet he don't know how he got there but he knows one time brother stewart that he was from the heavens and he's living now on earth it's dark it's gloomy it's wary of sometimes but he said if that dew job could talk he could say it like this just in a few moments there's going to be a rising of the s-u-n and that s-u-n has the ability to pull me back draw me out of this lady oh see a condition back into the presence where i came from hallelujah that's the reason why brother joe we can be a happy and excited here trapped in humanity because this world is not our home we're just a passing through and then the dawning of this s-o-n has the ability to keep drawing us out of our feelings our emotions or whatever we may be going through listen to this brother says talking about jacob's ladder he said but god made the covenant unconditional brother joel he made this unconditionally not will i have and brother man says no ifs attached not if you do this for the harvey not if you do this not if you do that he said but this was a covenant unconditionally and he hooked it in christ jesus and he anchored it there's no slipping there's no sliding there's no way of getting around he said what is it it's hooked by god above and by the son of god beneath he said what is it it's a pathway for travelers from earth to glory and you say with me this morning you you can't fail don't believe the devil's lie this morning you can't fail amen though the son of god he said through the son of god we extend to him and you can't fail oh my says that's what are you scared about our promise is hooked between god and christ and we are between them angels get charged over you he says nothing can harm you there was something about that little ark he said in the days of noah that floated on the top of the water it was a drawing power from above that's right he says to that glory of god shine down from heaven upon that ark he said today friend hear my word there is a draw in power not from a church not from a pastor but from glory this baptism of the holy ghost is moving down in that light channel to draw up a church that's the power of god the holy spirit alone he said his god's drawing power the condemning sinning of god oh isn't it wonderful he been from god of spirit to god with us now he's kept condescending down now is god in us oh hallelujah and he'll draw it out of you he said let it anchored it's anchored and catch this this morning there's a rope of salvation that holds a human heart that's a man that's ever been born again it's passed from death unto life all devils out of hell couldn't make him doubt it there's something holds within there let a rock let her shake she'll hold every time it causes christ jesus it's the promise of his word just remember he said it'll start tightening up i will draw them if i be lifted up i'll draw them he'll draw you out of you everything that you have need of even the rapture is already within you and he said the only thing that can get that out of you is the holy spirit the holy spirit alone he said is what draws it he draws it right out of you hallelujah it's this dynamo amen if god be for us who can be against us all that comes to me i will give him my life i will place him zoey life that never can perish can never be done away with in other words everyone comes to me i'm gonna wrap them in me and he will become part of me he can no more die than i can die his soul's immortal and can't die and i'll raise him up again at the last day don't you like that hey man so there there's a boat and there's a nut they're meant for each other through every trial or you

spirit comes and he is the one that begins to draw you back to him eventually every trial that you go through is only a process of the holy spirit tied you up to your absolute ain't been not here today and gone to my home every trial every battle he's never left you it's only his drawing power don't look at a battle amen there's something that god has against you or something you did wrong listen friends my god is the great shepherd nothing comes in his field without me knowing it that's reasonable romans 8 can tell us all things wait for the good and he said it's anchored in jesus christ on earth and around the throne of god in the heaven and you're in between there he said angels of god ascending and descending bringing you healing bringing you strength where are you going church reference to the great our church is at hand hallelujah in this army there's no retreat we're going oh that's the reason why you can say and i'll draw them to me i will lift them up i will cause them to be victorious i will lift them up it's drawn us right out of this world every day we wake up we're a step closer to that changing of dimensions do you believe that you either believe your message or need to hold amen and that's what the message taught us don't look at your surroundings they're temporal look to god the often the fears of our faith because listen friends we are going home every trial that we go through every battle ever every famine every tribal hell he's torn us back into the presence we're going home there's no gap in between us we're going to become so much like him that brother sounds so glad that a man can completely surrender to god that the devil just don't know what to do with you hallelujah and get to the place as moses did so he plagued egypt so much but still what we find moses saying pharaoh i'm not going to compromise i'm taking everything i got i'm taking my family i'm taking my cattle i'm not going to leave a hook behind hold myself when he tormented and plagued egypt with the power of almighty god into a place where the devil pharaoh amen and begin to tell him moses take all that you got he began to testify what moses already said because it wasn't the words of moses because his thoughts became god's thoughts and that thought became of god's words and words become material hallelujah about so when he begin to speak i'm not going to compromise with the harvey i'm not leaving hook behind and now we find just a few days later he was tormented by the power of god to a place he begins to testify what moses already said take all your god don't but joel don't leave a hood behind hallelujah hey brother man i'm so glad a man can surrender so much to god where the devil just don't know what to do with him not that you don't hurt not that you don't go through trials but we have a peace that path is all understanding knowing the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah do you believe his word and every trial you're going through is tightening you up to your absolute he's drawing you right out of this mortality because the word said we shall shall means must and can we shall be changed this mortality will be swallowed up with immortality this corruption must and can be swallowed up by incorruption it's coming church don't you hear it hey man we already caught a glimpse of our heavenly home amen we've already got a glimpse amen this world is not my home we already caught a glance where we came from amen oh hallelujah he says oh we we feel like we're going through a great time of distress and trials can you say it man am i the only one here this morning it feels like we're going through some great trials hey man look around you the religious wars political wars family wars come on church hells is an all-out attack all of hell has been released in the hour that we're living in but god found favor in you before the foundation of the world and knew what time and error to plant you in you think god is sitting back wearing what's going on in the white house what's going on in this that no sir he's planted you here he knows what's going on he has it all in control do we believe it or not this morning how many believes that god's got it all in control i'm here to tell you it's going home signs it's getting the bride in a place of desperation she's ready to come quickly lord come lord draw me back home there's pressures and he says don't you feel that way great time of distress and trials perplexity of time distress between nations and all kinds of things happening and sometimes i get engulfed this is a prophet of god sometimes he says with all this going on a man of god a prophet of god says sometimes i get engulfed everywhere i look he says i like like on a he said in a ship out there in the sea i've been given charge of the boat how we going to make it don't you feel that way sometimes how we going to make it and here comes one of the white caps 100 times bigger than my ship oh my but he says but a conjunction with a difference it begins a but here begins to make everything before irrelevant he said but this white cut is coming it's a hundred times bigger than we are he says but a bit but we'll crest them every one of them we are more than victors to him why he says because the captain the chief captain has got a hold of the string on the other end of the ship hey ben he can't let go it's impossible for our god to ever let go hallelujah he said you know what crest means it means to draw you to the top hey ben we'll craft every one of them we're going to crest every one of them are you hearing me this morning brother mark all the way to the top we're going to crest every one of them what about death death doesn't change anything we're going to rise above it that's already been conquered hell has already been conquered the captain is pulling on the other side he he'll heal not a church catch it this morning catch the words i will draw you he said he'll pull it through we don't know how we're going to get through this situation sometimes we'll get in a financial bind we don't know how god's going to take care of it but all of a sudden god shows up and shows out just when you needed him the most that's my god this morning he never fails us one time he might be four days late but he's always on time can you say amen listen he'll pull you through we'll crest every one of them we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us can you say praise the lord they can't sink us whatever your goliath is this morning listen to the words of the chess master the prophet the prophetic prophetic gift says you'll crest every one of you brother stewart it can't sink you brother mark he says it can't drown you sometimes we feel like we're getting been drowned by the pressures of this life but the prophetic gift says you can't sink it you can't drown it i'll lift it up i'll bring you out you're going to be victorious right now you reign with christ over the world sin death and hell in the grave and all the flesh and all of hell don't you love him they can't drown us they put us in a grave we'll come out again and the grave doesn't stop god's drawing power that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there will crest every one of them cause calls are you hearing me not because who your mom and daddy is that's it it does he doesn't say because brother being your pastor hey then you go to branham tabernacle he said we'll christ everyone calls our great chief captain is calling on the other side he's pulling us hallelujah hey ben that's our absolute this morning that's our absolute this morning i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'm pulling you through this trial hell can't hold you grave can't hold you hallelujah why because when sam he's pulling you from the other side he's got this this morning he's got this all in control even brother brown said did you keep your religion no what'd he say he kept me come here sam hey man so if sam turns around and i got a hold of sam he can't let go you know why because he ain't got a hold of me i got a hold of him and i've already read you he said what he does he comes down brother danny and he wraps his arms around you and engulfs you and every time when you're ready to give up and brother brown said it like this he said i would elect to go a long time ago but he said it wasn't me holding him it was him holding me that's the way each and every one of us in our gethsemane when we're ready to give up we're ready to give up we're ready to quit we're ready to take our own lives but down inside of humanity is something greater than we are and it begins to shake you hallelujah all of a sudden that brother branham said that lying had been that's been running loose he said job begin to think about god's resurrection power right in the midst of joe's gethsemane he said brother rem said all of a sudden that line tightened up to its absolute and then brother then he began to scream in a different language oh the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord i know my redeemer liveth and brother said the word liver there means a continuation he was always there even when he was going through his greatest trial god was tightening him up to his absolute do you believe that so the greatest weapon in the world brother brown says is not atomic bombs but he said a believer in contact with his maker hallelujah don't you believe that hey but when he's got a hold of you atomic bombs ain't got nothing on you when you're plugged up to this dynamo the atomic bombs has nothing on you he said but a believer in contact with his maker changes his whole attitude changes his mental changes his habit changes his body changes his nature then brother harvey brother brown throws in the whole barrel everything when you come in contact with your maker it changes your attitude it changes your mental it changes your habit it's going to change your body then the prophet said it's going to change your nature it's going to change everything you're going to be a different creature you're made out of stuff that can't be bluffed any longer you're not here today and gone tomorrow but now you can scream like psalms this is the day that the lord hath made ah we will rejoice we will rejoice and be glad in it why regardless of circumstances regardless of the trial we're going through we're ascending up he said what we need in macon and all the rest of the country tonight is some more mary's she don't she didn't wait till she felt live she didn't wait till she felt anything she didn't wait till she was positive she took god at his word and began to rejoice glory to god i'm going to have a baby knowing no man we find brother battle doing the same thing he said i'm healed praise god i'm healed how do you know jesus said so and i believe it and believe causes a substance and a substance creates perfect faith there you are he says oh i like to throw it in the face of devil every chance i get don't you like to do that this morning the devil comes in like a flood like i put it right back in the face of the devil said what about this my god's a healer my god's a savior my god is a deliverer hallelujah he said throw it right back in the devil when he stood there at males the group of dogs are women brandon you are finished jesus said i'm healed hallelujah i tuck him at his word yes he hates me i know he does but christ loves me all right he said i like to push it back on him every time i get a chance he said you don't feel any better brother brown than you ever felt when i come out come out of here i said oh boy if you want to hear me praise god stick around i ain't going by feelings i'm telling you my god's a healer he healed me 2 000 years ago hallelujah extra extra read all about it praise god i'm healed hey ben i'd like to put it right in the face of the devil and when it comes back see you still have that circumstance you still have the symptoms you say blue devil oh hallelujah i'm taking god at his word listen he said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and walk after the flesh but the spirit he says and walking according to the holy spirit not the ways of a simple world he can look in the face of hell and judgment and rejoice hallelujah can you do that this morning with everything going on amen there's the sound of the gospel lift up your heads and rejoice for your redemption draw nigh hallelujah luke tells us this notwithstanding and rejoice not that spirits are subject to you and they are he said but rather rejoice because your names were written in the heavens before the foundation of the world god wrote your name on the land's book of life all devils out of hell can't erase it out of it he said they can't erase it out of there god wrote it brother harvey and he said he spoke it hallelujah before there was a world amen before there was a creation before there was a satan before you ever sinned before you ever came to this world hallelujah god wrote your name on the land's book of life and spoke your name amen and his word can never return unto him void he spoke it and it will come to pass hallelujah can never never come back void he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never never fade away never cease never be stopped and before there was a world hallelujah and listen nothing in time can change what she was there in eternity don't rejoice because spirits are subject to you this morning but rejoice before there was a world before there was satan before there was a hell god spoke your name and placed it on the land's book of life he placed it in his book a predestinated seed it's his book oh hallelujah it's his family tree it's his family i'm not going to lose one of them nobody can prime out then the scripture will talk about how beasts would rise up out of he said and begin to conquer and begin deceive all great and small so many church memories pretend christians and deceive all whose names brotherhood i'm glad that he didn't stop there but he said he was going to save all great and small every church member he deceived all whose names were not written not in a church book but in the land's book of life before the foundation of the world he said god wrote your name in the land's book of life by his spoken word hallelujah he been maybe not literally with a pen but he wrote your name in the land's book of life abandoned spy his spoken word that can never be defeated that's reason why he said that picture of you a fan that god put on file can never cease that the devil no devils out of hell can break that image and here you are in humanity and what you were you came this world amen the same way every one of us did besides jesus christ amen but now this earth begins to pull you back where you came from but there's another drawing power they've been from above is drawing your soul back where it came from so it's a constant battle as we get older this this whole earth begins to draw our shoulders and wrinkle our faces the aches and the pains why because we're being pulled back to the earth where we came from but down inside of that old draw down body called flesh is a germ seed of life amen that god has drawn it back so it's a constant battle it's a battle in humanity but greater is he that is in me than the he that's in the world this body ain't gonna have the last save hell's not gonna have the last say hallelujah have been parting or noise this is a sound of freedom amen because this pride is rejoicing because now she knows where she came from and where she's going and nothing in time can change hallelujah don't you love the lord this morning amen before there was a foundation of the world god wrote your name in the land's book of life and spoke your name hallelujah and he goes on he says he said let everything that has breath praise the lord god's wanting to give it to you more than you want it are you hearing me those are planted in the house of the lord their god shall flourish we're not a beat down church we are the bride of jesus christ we're not we're not surviving we're thriving he met how we thriving by his presence this message came to declare he's not coming but he is here hey man he's here to guide us he's here to lead us he's there to protect us he's going to draw us right out of humanity back in the very thoughts of almighty god where we came from they've been nothing in earth nothing to come there's no hell there's no demons can ever stop this predestinative pool of almighty god i say we're going home we're going back where we belong this world can't hold us listen friends great things come to those that lifts him up when jesus is lifted up great things happen true believers that are connected to him in such a way when they begin to lift their voices and worship god begins to come down and inhabit their praise hallelujah god comes down and inhabits their praise and brother man says like this is long

the harvey and comes down and comes down right into your soul he said every muscle in your body begins to [Music] he said that old frown that you've been carrying around because that's where it wants to go it's easy to frame because our body's going back to the edge where it comes from he said all of a sudden that frown begins to turn back into a smile those hands that's been hung low begins to lift up those chains that's been dropped begins to lift up what's happening there's excitement there's stimulation there's something happening down inside church i don't believe this is a dead movement i don't believe this is a dead church this is a very alive church jesus christ in bright form with the same power same authority and a many member pride for she is the final voice to the final age underneath her messenger here we are church you're his hands you are you're his feet you're his voice don't you want to praise him this morning thank you lord for saving me thank you lord

in the world no demons out of hell can ever erase what god has spoken in the heavens hallelujah don't you love him this morning ain't god's grace good nothing can harm you he's pulling you right back sister shea where you came from don't you feel the pool this morning don't you feel the pool this morning god knows what to say in a special situation at a special time i was preaching at a church just a few weeks ago and and got a sentence sister sent me a a a a a letter to my wife to give to me and and she told me why i was preaching i got on a certain subject i can't even remember what i got on guess the lord just dropped down in a special way and began to minister to her heart and the very things that i said abandoned was a very thing that she lived out and she was delivered of something that she had for a long time and it was a healing process that god delivered just like he said not me he's the same yesterday today and forever don't you believe it amen he's the same god he delivers he's the same god he heals he's the same god this morning that wants to come down and have it your praise if you want it if you really want deliverance if you want if you want more joy if you want more happiness it's right here he says here it is this is for you this morning hallelujah we all get to that place church where we need a spiritual touch from the master we need a feeling we need to hear him we need to we need to have a little talk with him we need to feel him in such a way because we've been dragged down by humanity and all the trials of life also when you feel that in closing when you feel that strain that never left you you feel that tug that was always there and because of trials of life you that you have been feeling like you used to feel but all of a sudden maybe in a service like this or maybe you're driving down the road saying the songs of zion all of a sudden you begin to get that charge from your glorified body all of a sudden that frown begins to change and something comes down your heart and it echoes oh hallelujah and you really know no matter what happens you're one of them no matter what you're going through you're still one of them and all you feel that charge from the dynamo and that dynamite begins to blow out every funny feeling every malice every hatred every bitterness and that same spirit begins to make you love everybody okay come and contact somebody just love them oh lord drop that down in each and every one of our hearts this morning that we can look past one another's failures and faults and have enough love in our heart that you could bitterly disagree and still hug shoulders shake a hand help us all this morning don't you love him don't you feel the holy spirit this morning and we bow our hearts to him this morning father god we come to your throne of mercy and grace this morning lord we ask you come lord god and you did lord god you you come to a special way this morning lord the holy spirit was so sweet lord
