just remember he lives deep inside so why should I worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus is always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name until the storm passes by thank you we read in the Bible how he walked with him brought light to their darkness when the way grew dim how great it would be to have his steps leading mine to walk with the master of

Worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus he stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name until the storm passes by so why should I worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus is always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name until the storm passes we read in the Bible how he walked with them brought light to their darkness when the way he grew so dim how great it would be to have his steps leading mine to walk with the master all of the time and wind Trials come and death seems so nice just call on the master he'll be there on time and when sickness comes and my body's in pain all I have to do is call on his name so why should I worry why should I feel I fear when the very same Jesus he's always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name to the storm passes by I'll call on his name until the storm passes by amen he may appreciate that song tonight amen amen let's just stand together and my brother being to come to this time on his name let's sing white as snow was where the bean comes tonight amen thankful of our sins [Music] why is snow though think about it as you sing it tonight now Lord I know Lord I know and forgiven to through the power of your blood through the Wander of Your Love through faith I know that even you believe it tonight amen hard to believe but we we gotta believe it amen sing it to the beginning [Music] oh my seat all right I know that I'm clean and forgiven all through the path where of your blood Through The Wonder of Your Love walk through faith in you I know that I can be oh why why there's no I want you glad for that tonight those power hits together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father such a privilege to be here hard in your presence and to know that you are here or where two or three are gathered together because of your promise we can have confidence tonight and know that you'll meet us at the point of our need Lord I pray for each one that would have a need tonight maybe physical maybe spiritual maybe mental or hard in some way we need you tonight and I pray Lord that you'd meet every one of those needs we know that you will according to your word Lord and so we just ask to be used as vessels Lord that by which those needs may be meant for you move me out of the way Lord speak your word directly to the people tonight Lord when we leave here may we have that understanding that we're white as snow cleansed by your blood so thankful for that tonight we ask these things in the precious name of Jesus [Music] amen hallelujah you can be seated just for a minute so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight I uh it seems like it's meeting season everybody's having meetings and I'll try not to hold you too long tonight I know everybody's tired uh if you work today you're tired and I'm tired as well but I heard the singing and sister Allison was singing it just seemed like it made me feel better and so we're thankful for that tonight there's something about being in the presence of the Lord and hearing the words of the songs and and the music and things that helps us and it gets us ready for the word and so we're thankful for that tonight as I said it seems like meeting season we've got so many meetings going on I failed to mention and different places you all know what some of them are I know maybe some of you will be going down to evening light for the Tims I won't be going down there this year I I've promised the folks at Moundville that we would come up there and so we're going to go up there Thursday and Friday so be praying for us on the roads and we're going to come back so we'll be here this weekend and we'll have our regular Services here this weekend hasn't got been good to us here in our in our regular Services it's still wonderful but I I want you to go to meetings and just always remember that I always want you to go to meetings I understand you can't go to meetings all the time but brother Matt Morris next week that church they're having uh their regular yearly meetings and this year if you were here at our meetings you know that they supported us really heavily and they were here and brother Matt got up on a Wednesday night before those meetings and told the people that I want you to go and and treat that like it's our meetings and really encourage them to go so I'm doing that I'm returning the favor tonight and I want you to go and and be at brother Matt's meetings I'm going to go and they've got some good preachers over there what we're going to do make that a little bit easier on you is let out church next Wednesday night now I know that not all of us can go and it's in a tent so there'll be plenty of room but it might be a little bit cool and I understand that some of you won't be able to go because of the distance or the fact it's outdoors or whatever but in the tent but I'm sure it'll be fine and maybe several of us could go and and kind of support them in the meetings so we'll uh we'll we'll do that so no service here next Wednesday night and I didn't tell nobody that because I just decided that right on the right tonight so no service next Wednesday night we'll go down there to the tent meeting and support those Ministries I know whether Andrew Glover will be there and and uh brother uh Wayne Lawson and Brother David Seiler and I think they have another Minister as well so it'll be good meetings good meetings down there and uh let's try to do that and we'll just have our regular Sunday Services though this Sunday and next Sunday so we're looking forward to that and if you get to go I'm sure it'll be a blessing I might attend I wouldn't want to have to try to put on a tent meeting in this day and age but I'm glad they're doing it and maybe it'll attract someone from the outside and you know when that last one comes in we get to go home so if that last one comes in through a tent meeting I want to put all my my shoulder to the wheel and put all the effort that we can to support them in doing that we're brothers and sisters in Christ and and we ought to treat one another like that amen let's stand together we'll go right into the word tonight so no service next Wednesday here but we'll be at brother Matt's meetings if you want to come to that and they'll go Wednesday through Sunday but of course we'll have our regular Sunday services let's go to Romans 8 8. we'll continue on our series on quickening power I hope you've been enjoying this I know I have we're just getting into the meat of this message brother brand I'm always prefaces it with many things and we're getting to the last of that tonight and then he really gets into the meat of the wave Chief and the mechanics and the Dynamics so many of the doctrines we understand of the of the buzzwords we say it that way around the message that you've heard for years come out of this one sermon and uh and some of the best quotes that we've quoted over the years and so I thought it would be good that we'd see them in context and and kind of go into it in depth and it's just a wonderful sermon it is the rising of the sun Romans 8 and 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit how many are in the spirit tonight he said you are in the spirit he said if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated once again I want to go back to the last quote that we read from last Wednesday night brother Branham said I'm afraid today but too many of us are not giving people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one how many believe that tonight he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life so we must have Christ in order to have life so Paul tells us that he says if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're none of his you don't have the spirit of God of Christ you're none of his and so we have a different teaching in the message of the hour than they do in denominational circles especially when it comes to Holiness circles or or Pentecostal circles or even Baptists for that matter because they believe that when you're saved and you're born again when you accept Jesus into your heart and then later on you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but that's not actually what brother Branham taught that he taught that the new birth was actually not complete until you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so unless you have the spirit of Christ you are none of his right and so when I say we must get people to Christ that's what we're saying You must get people to the Holy Ghost we must I want to dwell on this a moment and then we'll move on into it is the rising of the Sun but you cannot have true baptism of the Holy Ghost and go to hell how many understand that tonight it's a seal to your Eternal destination once you once you have it you can't unhave it right you can't not have it it's yours it belongs to you it's a seal it's a sign you're going there and so to say you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a great thing the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's why brother Brandon stood so hard against sensation or or again speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not an Evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost why because there's got to be a change that takes place anybody Anointed with the Holy Ghost could speak in tongues anybody Anointed with the Holy Ghost could shout but there's got to be a new birth there's got to be a a new life a growth that comes from that and and that's what it is and so he said that the it was not the speaking in tongues but that your life copes with every word right and and that is evidence of the Holy Ghost now you can have that Holy Ghost anointing on your flesh brother random taught that clearly it's the same Holy Ghost by the way the same Holy Ghost not a different anointing but the same one but but if there's no seed there it won't Quicken it but here's the other side to that if there is a seed there it will Quicken it and when it does Quicken it it's awakened and that once it's awakened it's it's finished you're still living the Flesh and so the body is still dead because of sin but the spirit is life through Jesus Christ so again you cannot have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism in this hour the way we understand it to be the new birth of God and go to hell you can't do it and I will go this far you can't have it and be and not be a seed of God because how can you be birthed to be a son or daughter of God if you if you're not a seed of God you had to be in his thoughts to receive the token in this hour amen and so now but what is it why why does so many say well not everybody has it that's true because the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net the Bible says it was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind every kind and when it was full they drew it to Shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bat away and he said so shall it be at the end of the world now brother random says there's only one thing that we know to do is to follow the instructions that our Lord left us preach the gospel to Every Creature are you with me tonight I'm going to push through it so y'all just hang with me tonight he says he knows who is saved and who is not so our job is to preach the gospel to how many every creature right preaching the gospel is is throwing out the net I'm going to throw out the net that's what I'm doing tonight I'm throwing out the net now when I pull the net in there's all kinds of fish in the net right and so now he said he knows who has saved and who is not we do not that we just cast The Net into the sea bring forth of all kinds but God knows who is saved and who is not and no man can come to him except the father has drawn him and all the father has given him someone say all all the father has given him will come he said we know that so we can't say this one is a Christian and that one isn't when you're casting the net because nothing's manifested itself yet right they might have all spoke with tongues or all ran the aisles or all jumped and shouted or all done none of those things right but they're all in the net they all had some response to the word I'll say that if you haven't if you've had no response to the word you're not even in the net right but these have had a response to the word they believed if we could say it that way they're all believers they're all at least what they think believing is they're all believers at least in the intellectual way because they're in the net and he said when you've taken the net in he had all kinds of things in there he said and there would be water spiders bugs snakes fish scavenger fish good fish he said but you see the water bugs and things finally oh I love this they finally crawl back in the water again let me let me encourage you tonight the fact that you're here the fact that you're still caught that you're still in the net is a very good indication that you're a fish quit letting the devil beat you up oh I'm not saved I'm Not Elected I'm not the Bride of Jesus Christ the fact that you're here when so many water bugs crawled back and so many lobsters crawled back and so many other things crawled back in but you're a fish you're what he was fishing for amen you're the one the gospel came to and you're still caught by him you're still in the net it's still there's something about it you might have made mistakes you might have had all kinds of problems but there's something about it when you hear the gospel preach there's just something in you but Alan the response to that you're still in the net the tears still flow down your cheeks you still there's something there right you're still in the net yeah God help us if we ever get to the place where we have no faith and we just say well I go to church but no if you're in the net there's a response to the word you're still in the net hold on to that don't let the devil take that away from you you're in the net a good indication that you're a child of God amen now watch the good fish was Kept For The Master now we don't know which is we just casting out remember that water bug was the water bug when the net went over him the influence of the meeting was what caught him the snake was still a snake the gospel net just pulled him in and the scavenger fish was a scavenger fish and the turtle was a turtle crawfish was a crawfish we could go a little bit farther and say the Baptist was a Baptist right he said but then I was a Baptist but inside you were something different the Church of Christ was the Church of Christ the smoker was a smoker the drunker was a drunkard and they all went back where they come from but we're here we're still in the net on a Wednesday night where are we still on the net we were a real fish he said the Crawfish was a crawfish but the real fish was the fish to begin with so he knows which is he has their names on his book put there when the lamb was saying before the foundation of the world so that when I'm talking about getting people to Christ that's what I'm talking about we want to draw the net and pull them to Christ and then the ones that are are Creole seed of God can receive the true baptism the Holy Ghost and go on in now brother random deals with that and I don't have time tonight but if you go and read in the smyrnian church age in the church age book there's a part of that titled the new birth in every age how many has ever read that a few of you have the new birth in every age go read that and you'll understand what brother Branham means by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not just a sensation or not just something like that but it's a new birth it's being born again so believing it's not the Holy Ghost that's just being caught in the net we find that in Acts 237 they were pricked in their heart what does that mean it means they were caught in the net and so they said what shall we do they were in the net now Peter draws them in he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul found some that were caught in John's net you remember he threw out the John throughout the net of repentance and and pointing them to belief in Christ and it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth I'll pass through the upper coast and came to emphasis and found certain disciples and said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you were caught in the net now think about it since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said it to them and to what then were you baptized they said unto John's baptism and then said Paul John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied they were real fish right they were real fish so they began to manifest they begin to manifest what a fish does Glory now so if we go back to the rising of the Sun so we want to get people to Christ don't we how do we do that preach the word preach the gospel and bring people to the Holy Ghost because if you get people to the baptism the Holy Ghost you're literally getting them to Christ oh we need the Holy Ghost tonight how we need it we need it we need him to be our counselor we need him to be our guide we need him to be our friend we need him to be the one that carries us through life we can't make it without the Holy Ghost we were not meant to make it without the Holy Ghost Jesus said well it's needful for you it's expedient that I go away because when I go away I'm going to send the Holy Ghost and when I come back in that form he said I'm coming back to you when I do I'm going to be your counselor I'm going to be your guide I'm going to lead and guide you into all truth that's what we need tonight trust that's what we have now brother said it's the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived so again I'm not taking this out of context in this random says we've got to get them to Christ and this is what Christ is if the life of a man that's dead be projected and you will live you'll live the same life he lived he spoke in other places of Beethoven or John Dillinger he would do what they do the token it's the literal life of Jesus Christ lived through the believer we understand that so brother Branham goes on he said if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of one man into another he would absolutely be that type blood and if your spirit that's in you is reckoned dead and you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you he said Romans 8 11 said if the spirit the race Christ from the dead dwells in you will also Quicken your mortal body that same life them same powers and them same beneficiary he saw somebody ought to preach with me tonight he said that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was foreknown by God whose name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word he said how did we know he was the Christ what's a good question isn't it how did we know he was the anointed word how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about how will people know that we are Messiah yes little Christ right how will people know because we proved by our daily life what we're talking about Genesis 1 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass herb yielding seed in the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so so he's saying let everything bring forth after its kind that was God's method let the seed bring forth its kind and the Earth brought forth how do we know what a grass is talking about Blades of grass how do we know what a fruit tree is what an apple is right you've seen an apple that's how you know the fruit of it yeah that's how you know what an apple is because you've seen it it's been manifested in front of you when you plant it in the ground you you know they always put something on the package but how do you know that that's the truth you can tell anybody you're a Christian it can be written right there on the package and you can sit in your little Row in church you know how when we planted a garden we used to put the seed packet over the over the little stick at the end of the row some of y'all know what I'm talking about and you can put that right on the end of your row and it can say Christian right on it message believer right but the seed will prove what it is coming up Lord and the ultimate proof of what oh God if we could just see it that the ultimate proof it's one of these days your body is going to change and you're going to come up if you go by way of the Grave you're going to be in a resurrection you'll come up to proof we were dead in trespasses and sins but around spring of the year at the rising of the sun when the message light began to come on us it warmed the Earth and we begin to come up and that's the proof of what we are and Who We Are right oh glory to God the Earth brought forth grass an herb yielding seed after his kind the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw said it's good amen Howell again brother I'm asking a question how will I know the message of the hour How will I know the message of the hour and I want to challenge you with this there's been other people that said they were Elijah how do we know that this one's right How will I know the message of the ri was listening to English History the other day and as I was listening to this podcast on Ancient English not ancient really but Middle Middle Ages English History the last man who was ever burned at the stake in England was born at the stake for saying he was Elijah that was to come Malachi 4. but he didn't manifest Elijah if you go read about his life How will I know the message of the hour the aunt proves what he promised Glory and he talks about it every time you hear some a little preacher that comes around and I don't think that screen's on back there brother Peter oh there it goes um you know every time some little two-bit preacher comes around claims to be something you know and and it's something that they're not just watch and see what they bring forth God's not going to do this thing in the corner but when God sent the message of the hour he produced something why did he produce you and I yeah amen he said God proves what he promised and he talks about it he said that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about you you could come and tell him he said brother Ben I know I'm getting off here but I think it's it's good to illustrate it so we'll understand you can come and tell me say I'm a good Carpenter all right I can tell you that I'm a good Carpenter but at some point you begin to say where's the proof but the joke come up to me and say I can paint where's the proof we know brother Caleb can paint because he painted this church right it's the proof of it we know brother Joel can paint because we've seen him paint we know some of you can sing because we've heard you sing we know some of you can't huh right the proof is what you are oh God and I know I'm a Christian I know I'm a Child of God because I came up and I began to live as a child of God and I began to worship God and I begin to desire God and I hungered and thirsted after God what was it I was a child of God Amen nothing could take that away from me don't let the devil steal away your joy trying to tell you well you're not a Believer you're not a child of God you are a son or daughter of God why because you came up you come up out of a message house or you come up out of a dead Church system or you come up out of the world but you came up and begin to worship God Oh Glory to God amen he proves what he's proves what he has talked about what he promised to do in Christ amen he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proved it what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it and all the days of the Apostles he proved it now in this day he proves what he said be because they are a part of that seed they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again he said oh what a message see the message is not it's not books and tapes the message is proof Hallelujah you said on Easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in Christ at his crucifixion they were in him at his resurrection we are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness the darkened world of unbelief were churches and denominations and so forth has drawn us out he said and there's something in his calling oh we want God we're hungry and thirsty for God is that why you're here on a Wednesday night there's something in you calling we want God we're hungry and thirsting for God what is that proof of Who You Are right we joined the Methodist Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterians and what more and still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all of a sudden while we was groping in darkness the great Resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of God said like he was the manifestation of the promised word of God I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to seek corruption he manifested every word of God that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on the Easter morning he said now them who were once groping in darkness and wandering around he said if they should wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules now look all those things passed away because the proof that you're a message believer is not how many tapes you listen to and it's not even how many services you attend or not who your pastor is right or what day you wash feed on are you hear me today whether you have two or three services or one service or once a month or once a year that's not the proof of it now I believe you'll follow the word but what's the proof of it what is it what is it you were wandering around but all those things passed away why because the resurrection something raised in you he said for there was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man made reason he said there had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again there will be people come and tell you listen to me young people there will be people come and tell you they can prove the message wrong they'll tell you by scientific proof we can prove it wrong they told Noah in his day we can prove there will be no rain we can prove there won't be a Rapture but he said he defied the scientific proof that they had by raising again when they say that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever that his power isn't the same that his gospel is the same when the Bible says it's the same he said God defied every denomination every Creed and he moved forth with his holy spirit as he promised and proved it to us that he is alive as he proved it to you and and so and I'm going to go on but there's two sides to this you know there's a historical side we can look back and we can see God proved it in the message of the hour and I think that's important by the way because we don't want our kids to forget what God did in this hour and we're we're in a junction time right now where many new brother Brandman walked with him were passing off the scene and some of the we had the opportunity as older folks many of us knew people who were in the meetings we fellowship with them we talked to them we knew what it was we believed their stories now we're getting to a place but the Bible says more blessed or they have not seen all right but even my generation we didn't see directly but we we could talk to them but my kids will never have that opportunity you think about it they have very little opportunity to ever meet somebody who was in the meeting so that becomes a historical thing so I think we ought to keep that alive we ought to remind them of those things we had to show them the video we ought to do those things for them but it can't stop there because it just becomes a dead religion of 40 years ago or 50 years ago now but but it's just a dead religion if that's all it is but not only did he prove himself 50 years ago but he proved himself in my generation he changed me he quickened me and he's leading me away from the world and straight to Calvary it leads me away from the way this world culture is going and leads me to himself we are the benefactors of his resurrection he's proved to us that he's alive not only in a prophet but also in a bride thank you Lord we are the benefactors of his resurrection quick and after being dead in the world in sin and trespasses he's Quicken us together with him raised with him now sitting in Heavenly places Christ Jesus his Spirit brings his same life again on the Earth now watch he says if the spirit of God raised up Christ the body the anointed body what did the spirit do it raised up the anointed body the Christ what does the spirit do today that's why you can't have it only in mechanics he said you can't can't be just word only right because the spirit raises the anointed body if the spirit of God anointed that body in such a way when that seed fell into the Earth he just wouldn't let him rest there glory and we could all go back to our own lives and see that when the spirit of God Anointed The the anointed body which is us when it anointed us what did it do it wouldn't let us just lay there oh we've been through that but again we know what it's like to fail we know what it's like to be in a dead cold grave we know what it's like in dead trespasses and says even if you've been raised in a message you know what that's like if you've ever been born again you know what it's like to not be able to live an overcoming life but you've been raised you've been raised searching God for that today he wouldn't let him rest there quickened him and raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same Signs by the same power but the same signs being you it'll also raise you up aren't you glad for that promise today now watch brother Branham and it is the rising of the sun then goes into teaching on the wave sheath and I'll have to hold that back for next time because it's a wonderful thing but this is a resurrection message proof that God is alive after two thousand years but I want to present this to you tonight before we close see what was proof he keeps his word right he kept his word and we can say that he kept his word 2000 years ago right we can say that he kept his word on the day of Pentecost he kept his word even to Lutheran to Wesley at the Pentecost he kept his word in a prophet I think we could say he kept his word on Malachi 4. behold I sent unto you Elijah he kept his word on Revelation 10. a mighty Angel come down with an open book he kept his word on Luke 17 30. and the day when the son of man is revealed but if he kept his word about that he also keeps his word about me and about you about the bride now what position are we in in this hour under this are we a dead body laying there waiting on a prophet to come back to bring us up out of the Grave or are we a quickened bride right and we we get to decide that in Europe because what you believe is what you are you can't you can't be nothing you don't believe you are right so you've got to believe you're a quick and body and if you're a quick and body what are you you're Washed by the Water of the word listen he tells in in Ephesians 5 25 Paul's talking to husbands and wives but it's such a greater mystery than that but yet that's a mystery in itself but now Ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word so we stand today what sanctified the same message that promised Malachi for the same scripture that promised that is promising this that he might present it to himself a glorious Church I love the word glorious what that means is shiny sparkly glorious is over and over the top now what's he saying he's not going to present a church that's barely dressed barely ready barely clean and oh God got in by the skin of their teeth but a church with quickening power he might present it Oh Glory to God a glorious Church and look at somebody tell them if there's anybody beside you look at somebody and tell them you're a glorious Church you're a glorious Church a glorious Church what else does it say not having spot yes sir yes sir you can quit saying it now Gabe that's enough sorry not having a spot are you with me tonight not having spot he's going to look at one another and say you don't have a spot or a wrinkle and we're not talking about the outside but you don't go by this is how he sees you he said he he presented to himself when is this supposed to happen in this age he might present it to himself I love that you realize it was the message that presents us to Christ Christ is the message amen presenting himself a bride glory to God presuming himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish a faultless bride completely sinless amen oh is that what he said about you Hallelujah now watch he kept his word how many could say Amen to that tonight he glorious Church I am without spot or wrinkle but Paul or brother Branham rather took that and he said you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ ready and waiting for a rapture Hallelujah I just take that I'll take the word of a prophet over the word of India of anybody else in this age he said I was complete pure virtuous sinless he didn't say I needed somebody else's Ministry to come along and make me that but he said you are that but then if he kept his word about that let me believe that tonight I'm gonna close in just a minute we'll be right on time he will keep his word in First Corinthians 15. now this I say brother verse 50. this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last truck for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptor will must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality listen to the word of the scriptures we get ready to close so in this corruptible shall it put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory he said oh death where is thy sting why do you have to be scared of church own grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord if he kept his word about Malachi 4 if he kept his word about Ephesians 5. then he'll keep his word in First Corinthians 15. and first Thessalonians 4 and all the other scriptures that speak of a rapture and a body change musicians go ahead and come I I read a story that when Wellington one of his great victory over Napoleon at Waterloo they set up signal flags signal back home what they were trying to Signal back was Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo that was the message Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo but you know what happens across the English Channel it gets real foggy and the people receiving the message on the other end didn't get the whole message they only got the first two words Wellington defeated so all night long while the fog persisted they thought Wellington was defeated but when the sun came up Glory when the sun came up are you hearing me tonight that's that's the hour that we live in I know it's been very simple tonight and not much but if you just see it on a Wednesday night the sun has come up it is the rising of the sun he didn't say it might be it could be it is the rising of the sun when the sun come up we could see that Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo it looked like it looked like Jesus had been defeated they had killed him put his body in a grave but when the sun came up on Sunday morning they've got the whole message and can I say to you as we close here today that when it may be it may be look like it may be foggy everywhere that you are you may look out here and see Darkness everywhere but when you see the signal when you see the message and begin to read it as the sun comes up and begins to burn the fog out of your brain begins to burn it out of your soul you begin to realize I am not defeated but I have risen there's been a sunrise in my day Wellington was not defeated the bride is not defeated but she's alive just the same as he was alive you and I are alive today quickened we are we are a lively bride Lively Stones quickened by a living God do you believe it tonight hey man let's stand together brother Helen come Satan has been defeated Christ has won do you believe it tonight if you believe that anything is possible all things are possible Wellington has not been defeated Wellington defeated Napoleon Christ has not been defeated Christ defeated the devil that's the clear message it's not clouded anymore by denominational systems but there's been a resurrection in our day what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is hallelujah I'm living in that Resurrection oh let me be part of it today amen just
