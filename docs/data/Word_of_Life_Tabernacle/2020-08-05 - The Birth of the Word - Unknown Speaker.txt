brother daryl today still suffering with this this virus but lord you're bigger than a virus and you're able lord to come and meet his need today and i don't know lord what needs we have lord or we might have tomorrow but you're bigger than whatever we might face lord the doctor could give us a diagnosis or there could be a a failure lord of the system in the economy or whatever that it is but you don't ever fail us lord and we're so grateful for that today so thankful for your continuing love that is expressed in our lives through your word i pray you'd bless us now every one of us lord and heal every sick person touch every heart we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to john chapter 3 and verse 3. we'll just read that one verse tonight it's good to be here on a wednesday night some that couldn't be here some are traveling and some that are watching tonight and so i pray the lord would bless you as well if you're watching but i'm so glad for those of you that are here that made the effort to come it's always good to see you you know it's good to see all of you but i thought especially tonight of you with your families your young families it's so good to see the children in the house of the lord it means something to bring them to church on a wednesday night and it'll do something good for them i know it did for me growing up that it meant something that my parents brought me to church on a wednesday night so god bless you parents i know you don't always get a lot out of the service but i pray that god would give you a blessing a special blessing tonight i wanted to tell you brother ivy will be here on sunday remind you of that and if you can be here and be here on sunday i'm sure it will be a blessing to you my wife and i are going to eat at the fellowship hall i don't know if he'll be able to stay or not and join us but if you wanted to do that to bring your food and have a little time of fellowship that's fine it'll be open uh we'll just have the one service on sunday but it will be open and we'll remind you we need to maintain our requirements as much as we can for covid and try to prevent that as much as we can and still be a church so so but if you want to come and bring some food that'd be fine bring food for yourself or your family also there's some some things in the back for you on the carpet and we're going to make a decision pretty soon on that so if you want to get your have your voice heard and as far as the color or something like that it don't matter much to me but but for the ladies i know that it does so take a look at that and and we're going to try to get that rolling as soon as we can and some of the other surveys that you all wrote stuff on there and mentioned stuff to us there's um we took note of that and i'm so glad for your feedback there's some things that we're doing that were mentioned on there that we didn't realize needed to be done and that we're doing in the background and we're working on that i can promise you that on all of the things that we can do john chapter 3 and verse 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee whenever you see that in the scripture he's saying this is the truth this is the truth except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening i enjoyed that song service very much my entire sermon could be summed up in that song tis so sweet to trust in jesus have you ever looked at the words to that you sung them just a minute ago just so sweet to trust in jesus just to take him at his word that's a big thing just to rest on his promise just to know thus saith the lord oh we know it in this hour don't we and then it says i'm so glad i learned to trust him i learned to trust him precious jesus savior friend and i know that he's with me not just with me today but he'll be with me to the end i love it it says just so sweet to trust in jesus just to trust his cleansing blood and in simple faith to plunge me beneath the healing cleansing flood i i could listen to that all day i want to speak to you tonight on the birth of the word this is important so i want us to i know you say well brother ben i've been born again but none of us have made it yet all of us are still traveling because when you made it brother harvey you won't have them gray hairs right when we made it we'll look a little bit different than we do now and and act a little bit differently than we do now so we're on our way and jesus said unless you're born again you you can't even understand the kingdom of god and so the new birth or the birth what we call the birth of the word that's what i want to title this tonight the birth of the word it's that part of the process of redemption that manifests the potential of the seed that was in our father and he is the original owner he god is our father he is the one that the seed the thought the what we are if we're anything in god it come from him if we are going back to god we had to come from god and so that seed is is what was in him but being born again is when that seed begins to manifest its potentials and i won't say that it manifests all of its potentials because we won't see that until the culmination of it until we leave here until our work is over but it you begin to see a baby so it makes sense that you you've gone through the pregnancy and and and caleb and sophie could explain that to you better than i could right now because they've just been through that but you've gone through that and and you've been through the water and the blood and the spirit you get to the other end of that there's a baby there there's a reality to what you've been supposing there's a there's a realness to it that wasn't there before and that that's the new birth that it manifesting the potential of that seed that baby's alive it's outside the womb it's it's breathing on its own and and it's got it a life in it and that life we know is the holy spirit that that the spirit part of that of the water blood and the spirit is the holy spirit that's that's in you and then you grow from there you grow from there and we grow up into christ and so the seed that's in you anointed by the life of christ begins to manifest the word in your life and it manifests in in many different ways that people don't realize that just you coming to church tonight or you watching and listening to the word is a manifestation of the word in your life it's something that that you're doing something that a lot of people don't want to do but you do it because there's a hunger there for the word there's a desire there to hear the word and so it's a manifestation and yet that wouldn't be the only manifestation but there would be a change something take place in your life there's a baby you're born again and i think all of us that have been around for a long time and i say us i use that a little bit loosely because i've not been around as long as some of you but if you've been around for a long time you've seen a lot of people come and go and you've seen churches fill up and empty and you've seen preachers come and go and you've seen great revivals and lack of revival and you've seen a lot of things and some of you have been around a long time and we've got some elders here tonight and i see a different one sitting here and brother harvey and brother jt and brother danny and all of you that point them out just because they're old but really but harvey's not that old but but you've been around a long time and then some of you that aren't that old have been around a long time you know that not everybody that comes through and gets excited about the message sticks right you know that and not everybody that seems to be the best christian and i was talking with my brother about it the other day and i said you know it seems like that something to this effect that it seems like that the ones sometimes that that shout the most and are the most anointed and are the most uh excited are the ones that don't last and that's not always true because i've got my pentecostal credentials i like to shout i like to to speak in tongues i like to see the gifts of the spirit moving but but those are things that that don't necessarily tell you anything about how whether a person is going to stick because one person might do it and be saved another person might do it and be and never be saved never even live right and so there's something that does make a difference and that's the new birth and if you stuck around that that tells something it's a genuine new birth there and more than that that you've grown you're different than what you were right and and so you're different than what you were last week or or a year ago or 10 years ago and you go through something now and you look back at brother jt what the way you would have viewed that 10 years ago 20 years ago 50 years ago it had been different than what it is today because you've grown up in christ and you see it differently you see through different eyes than what you used to see it's a birth that's taken place in your life and what i want to see among us and i think what is lacking the most in our churches and all around us is a genuine new birth just a genuine birth of the word that people can say that there's a seed there and we can see the evidence of it in our lives not a a not a legalism not going back to a look looking at how long your dress is or how long your sleeves are but a genuine experience with god that you know that person changed when they come to god how long has it been since we said that about somebody who come to the house of god and see that person changed and i know that god still does that he still does that but it's not an overnight thing and that's what so many people are looking for but you might look at it tonight and sometimes the devil likes to play with their minds and say how do you know that you're born again how do i know that i've really gotten that birth of the word that i've really been changed because especially when people fall away or when different ones don't make it or maybe you see them doing things that are against the word and you think how could i could i do that is that what i am am i ain't no better than they are in that sense and we're not in the flesh but am i would i be able to do that and yet there's something in your heart that's real how do i know that i'm born again and in the roman catholic church they said well if you do these good works and you you you say these prayers and you take this wafer then you're that means that you're going to make it but it'll be just by the skin of your teeth you might have to go to purgatory for a while but you'll eventually get there if you do all of these things and we know that's not right but among the calvinists they said that well you're saved because you're the elected and you know it you confess it that makes you saved luther taught justification by faith if you believe on christ you're saved and then which was true which is true but then in the baptist church that that became shaking hands with the preacher and today it might be in in the message it might be that we uh we listen to our favorite preacher and that preacher because we see how anointed they are and and how wonderful they are that makes us saved it doesn't mean anything to salvation or our pastor is a certain level or something that respected among the people and that that makes us saved that doesn't mean that you're saved but the man is fine he's fine but it doesn't mean that you're saved you have to be saved no matter whether the man is standing on the pulpit is saved or not because the truth is if you're around for 30 40 50 years and if the lord tarries i don't know how many years we have left we may not have a year left we may not have a day but but if there's 30 years left you'll see you'll hear more preachers that aren't saved at some point there'll be somebody standing behind the pope and you all know it and they'll preach sometimes the real word but not have it themselves not be born again and so you can't base it on that if it's the word you you say amen to it but it doesn't affect our or what who i am and and so the holiness people where my family come from they took john wesley where he said his heart was strangely warmed in the in the meeting at alder's gate in england and and he said it felt like his heart was strangely warmed and so the holiness people said well that's a witness of the spirit and so they they said well if you shout that means you felt that right and so they'd say as brother brandon would put it if you shout you've got it and the pentecostal spoke with tongues and said well that must be the evidence of the holy ghost because in the new testament many times they spoke with in other tongues when they received the holy ghost so they said that's the evidence of it and to some of us it becomes if we believe a certain doctrine if we go to a certain church or if we you know can say certain words a certain way we're born again and it doesn't mean anything it really doesn't other than that you can read a parrot we could teach a parrot to say to say what the prophet said actually but he would still be a parrot right and that's where yes it's necessary to say what he said but you've got to be born again and so we today we see in the pentecostal church that become great things happening great emotions but we find in the scripture that there was a wind and an earthquake and a fire and they all come to elijah but he did not move until he heard a still small voice and sometimes as ministers and i'm just preaching to you from my heart today but sometimes we move people by our emotions and we move people by and i believe in those things and i i tend to get emotional myself but but that's we move people by that and we learn how to move people like that and the truth is you could work people up into a certain thing to where every service we had people that were worked up into an emotion but still the seed would be saved and the elect would be saved and the non-elect would not right it wouldn't change that but but sometimes what happens is even we'll give people and brother branham calls it a false birth that when we begin to pointing to those things instead of to the word we actually hinder the work of god we're not helping it and so elijah heard a wind and an earthquake and a fire but he did not move until he heard a still small voice and and those things were he said god was not in those things but those things were the effects of the presence of god where did they come from god allowed them to happen or caused them to happen but that wasn't god right and you've been around long enough that you know that there's times when you feel the effects of god's presence but that's not god what the god is in his word right and it's when that presence comes and settles down among us that we know that yes god is near us but when he's near us that's the time when we really need to buckle down and say lord what do you have for me today how can how can this word affect my life today and that's what we really need to grow in christ now brother branham kind of gets almost frustrated with the pentecostal people because they put all of it over on that and in a sermon called what does thou hear he says brother sister i've been back in a cave long enough and you have two to know there's been a lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot of noise and fusses and stews things like that in big meetings where has been god out of it he said that's the reason i said what i did this morning there's got to be something deeper than a healing service there's got to be something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues there's got to be something deeper than a rushing mighty wind the wind went forth but god wasn't in it we've had rushing mighty winds all over the country and sensations and blood in the face and the hands to all kinds of signs but where's god at and i think so many times we look at a special service we think well during that special service that's when god can really speak to me listen we we underestimate the ability of the word to speak to our hearts on a wednesday night when we're socially distanced not because we have to or want to be but because that's just the case but sometimes on that wednesday night service god steps in and begins to speak to our hearts something that will change us something real not just a a a rushing mighty wind he said we've had rushing mighty winds all over the country and all these sensations well where is god at and he says all the great fuss and america is guilty of listening to those noises oh we love noise but god is not in the noise and i know our minds will go to where brother branham said that where jesus is there's a lot of noise and those two things are both true but jesus wasn't making the noise he was the word we make the noise and we should all right but we're human beings we make the noise we say lord i'm so grateful to you for being here and we recognize his presence we should do that we should make the noise but it wasn't him making the noise he was moving fulfilling his father's will that's what he's doing today and so he says we love noise but god is not in the noise although as honorable in things as they are yet god isn't in noise he said if that would have been so when the africans beat the tom thomas you never heard such a noise and rhythm god wasn't in it and you know now you don't hear that just you say in the jungles but where we were at i was in this city in lomi togo in a hotel on a probably about three stories high and long building and i went in there one night and went to bed because you generally went to bed early because you're so tired i went to sleep and about an hour later i was awakened to the noise of the tomtoms and it sounded like a war party well i've never been in africa before i didn't know i thought well you know it could be they're coming to get me i mean i don't know it could be that it could be there's a war breaking out had no idea and what it was is there's tourists there at that hotel and the locals would come and dress up in their native dress and play their music and do their little dance and all for the tourists and then they go back and dress in their street clothes you know when they got done but they they were given their little dance and stuff for them and and and brother brandon said if that if god was in noise and i i concur with that boy you talk about noisy and there's nothing you could do about it and it just went on and on and on through the night but but if that was god then they would have god but they needed god same as we did he said you've never heard such a noise in rhythm god wasn't in it he said we've had rushing mighty winds we've had all kinds of fires and earthquakes and shakings and great revivals and things like that god wasn't in it if it had been it would have showed itself up but after that come a still small voice then god was in the voice oh i love that god was in the voice romans 10 17 tells us that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so we hear the word of god and we get faith to be saved and that's what we call that light striking the seed and then the seed begins its transformation there may be a whole lot of effects and brother brown talks about how a birth is always a mess no matter where it's at and as i've said before you don't come to an altar to get anything you can get right where you're at you come to an altar to give up things right to surrender to die and so brother brown said talk about that pig nature he said you need to die until that pig is consumed at the altar and then that lamb nature can come in but now we are not saved because we come to an altar or how long we cried or anything like that but by faith after hearing the word but all those things come with it but now those things can be impersonated two people could come both cry two people could come both shout won't be right and one be wrong what cannot be impersonated listen this ought to give us comfort because you think and you look and say well maybe i could fall maybe i could be just like maybe i could be one who could go out and never want to come back obviously any of us could backslide because we do it all the time right but i mean fall away to the point where we reject the message of the hour and those things that we've helped most dear and we think maybe i could do that and you begin to think well all these things can be impersonated but what cannot be impersonated is the seed itself it's an original it's not hybrid and so the life that that seed produces cannot be impersonated oh my you may have somebody that looks just like you out there in the world you may have i believe it's called a doppelganger someone who looks just like you do you may walk around and see that person they look just like you i hope there's not one out there that looks like me i feel sorry for them but probably there is somewhere they say everyone in the world has a twin somewhere so there may be somebody just like you but if you hang around them long enough you would recognize or people that were with you would recognize that's not you no matter how much they look like you because the characteristics would be different and when we're born again we bear the characteristics of christ it's an original there's something about a life but you can't observe that all at once because they maybe look like you in church it may look like you for a while but eventually you realize that's not them that's not it so we judge nothing before the time now so we have to trust what god has done for us and in acts 4 13 this is when peter and john went and healed the men at the gate beautiful and spoke to him and and when they did the pharisees and the sadducees saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they were as i said before ignorant ignoramuses and it says they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus we remember somebody else who was bold like this we remember that these men have been with jesus and that boldness was in contrast to their previous behavior which was to hide and to deny but now they begin to step out what had happened pentecost had happened they've been born again and in acts 11 26 we find that when paul and barnabas paul find some folks in antioch that need to be taught the word and so he goes to he goes to find paul and he brings him back barnabas goes to find paul brings him back and it says when he had found him he brought him into antioch and it came to pass to the whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and i just love the way this scripture reads because it tells us what happens when people hear the word when people hear the word the word itself is enough and we have to hold on to that because sometimes with allen it seems like that nothing is taking place nothing's happening but the word is sharper and powerful than more powerful than a two-edged sword it never said my ministry would be never said that another ministry would be but it said the word is more powerful the word is power the word has power the word is life and so as they assembled themselves with the church for a year all of a sudden the disciples were called christians why because paul and barnabas had been teaching them the word for a year and it began to bear fruit in their lives why they had a new birth it had an experience yes but it grew in their lives that's how you know the one from the other that's how we know we're born of god is because the word produces something in our lives now look acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it says then they that gladly receive his word received his word were baptized and this is when peter said that great statement when he talked about that if you repent and are baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and they that gladly receive that word were baptized in the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls and notice and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking a bread and a prayers and fear come upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles now i don't want to go beyond i don't want to presume this but i believe this that if the experience at pentecost had not been followed by them continually continuing steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship it would have been shown that it was a false birth but the proof that this was that was the fact that they continued in the apostles doctrine that after they come according to dr peter's prescription how do we know that the prescription worked because they did it and they were changed right now excuse me for yelling at you i hate yelling at a few people oh brother branham in the rapture and you could take all of these things and go find and you'll find them not saying something brother branham didn't say in the rapture he's brother brown says when it comes to an oh glory i got the anointing and it's the genuine anointing he said remember kf has had it too and prophesied so did balaam have it in prophesied but that don't have nothing to do with this inside he said unless that was god's seed i like this he said it don't have anything to do with what's inside unless it's god's seed amen it's gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished so if it's not god's seed it doesn't matter he said i don't care how much you shout speak with tongues run shout that has nothing to do with it kokober can count just as much as any of the rest of them he said i've seen heathens raise and shout and speak in tongues drink blood out of a human skull calling the devil he said so he said any of them sensations and things forget it he said it's your heart in that word listen to this church this is enough right here to make us shout he said it's your heart in that word and that's christ bring in there he said and watch it make itself known and see you maybe you've got your family would act a certain way brother joe i don't know how your family acts but but i know a little bit about how you act and that's good and you you've gotta but there's something you're different maybe than even some what your family would naturally do and you've grown into that why because your heart is in the word and it's opened up it's made itself known in your life and you can see that in some little way and you think well you know my my grandfather or my uncle or someone in your family i don't know who it would be that that you would know that maybe they wouldn't have reacted like that and there was a time i wouldn't have reacted like that but now i can see that something's changed i'm different than what i was what is that the new birth and so brother branham says if your heart your heart and the word watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed think about it from one you don't have to be a theologian to think about how the seed rots and dies and then the life that's inside of it is awaken and begins to grow when that moisture hits the seed and all the sudden and the light hits the seed all of a sudden it begins to grow it begins to open up what it is but it don't become that overnight it becomes that over the lifetime of the plant right until finally it reaches its full age he said just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the age it's living in amen now i want to go to first peter chapter one and maybe this will help us tonight and if we have trouble understanding this and i know i have in the past so if you all haven't you bear with me but i've had trouble at times understanding why people act the way that they do it and i do believe in having an experience with god but there's more to it than just an experience because it's a continuation of your walk with god and the scripture tells us that if you endure to the end you'll be saved it tells us judge nothing before the time and you can't tell anything by watching somebody for 15 minutes in church and it's why we don't promote people just quickly to positions that's why we watch and try to pray and hold on to things you shouldn't marry somebody quickly because i guess i'll talk speak to my children there's not very many of marrying age but they're not either but i mean they will be and you shouldn't marry anyone before the time right because if you do you'll end up in trouble down the road and it may be years later but there'll be trouble and so and even in the best marriages we have problems i consider my marriage to be one of the best but we still have we've had problems not not anything that would because we're committed to one another but just the things of life it's hard enough if you've got the right one it's much harder if you get the wrong one and do it hastily so we should wait and we should pray for these things and and and the same thing is true of any life when we're watching somebody's life it's a process over time you won't know and and i know this and i know that sometimes i'm not easy to get to know but my purpose here is not to just make you my friend and i want you to be my friend okay but that's not my entire purpose here i want to bring the word and that's the main thing and but i want to be your friend too but you may not get to know me quickly but but don't judge it before the time you know let's walk down this road a little bit because sometimes it takes a long time to get to a point where you realize i can put confidence in in a ministry and that's okay i i get that but we always should have confidence in the word so now first peter 1 13 peter talks about this and he says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end we're going to read down to verse 25 so if you if you have your bibles that would be good to to open up to that he says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ hope to the end as i begin reading that that stuck out at me as i was reading it just right before church you don't hope and say well well i've got it i've got everything i need but you keep that hope to the end right that expectation which is what biblical hope is not just maybe it'll happen but an expectation of the grace is to be brought unto you the revelation of jesus christ said i've got all the grace that i need he didn't he said you didn't but there's something to be brought into the revelation of jesus christ what is that the change of our bodies that's rapturing grace now he said gird up the loins of your mind and of course you know as people in those eastern countries they would when they were traveling or running would take their long garments and tie them up so they wouldn't get tripped up your mind is what will trip you up when it comes to the new birth huh because the devil will try to make you think you have it when you don't it'll try to make you think you don't have it when you do and people sometimes worry about that and sometimes the best clue that you've got it is when the devil tries to tell you you don't right because he's obviously going to lie to us he's the father of lies and so people would do that they would they would gird up their loins to keep from tripping and so wesley put it this way he said gather up all your thoughts and affections keep your mind always disencumbered prepared to run the race and we know in in second corinthians and i won't go there to save time but paul tells us to cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought that's the same idea gird up the lord you say what does that have to do with the new birth well we'll see in a moment you've got to gird up the loins of your imagination to tie yourself to the word where you don't get tripped up by an emotion or a sensation but bring your mind into obedience to the word because today you may feel safe tomorrow you may not feel saved gird up the loins of your mind today you may make a mistake tonight and say well i'm not safe today i need to be re-saved no girl up the loins of your mind don't let your imagination tell you you're not what you are right gird up the loins of your mind like don't let your imagination run away with you and tell you well i'll just be like everybody else i'm just you know my family's this way or so and so this way i just got to do what they do know keep your mind girded up grab all those thoughts and bring them into captivity so that you can look at the word sanely and soberly and i am who the word says i am not because of how i feel because i know and as i said some of you young younger folks my age but my kids are getting older and i'm going to leave all the rest of the children to y'all but when it comes to having kids in church i never had to deal with that so much but my wife didn't get anything out of church for years because of that or very little but you know what sometimes you don't feel safe during that time all i do is take care of kids sometimes i don't feel safe dealing with kids now you can your imagination gets running away with you say well i don't always act like i should at home i don't always know what does the word say cast down those imaginations and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ i said well if i went to this certain meeting or went heard a certain preacher no cast down imaginations what does the word say verse 14 has obedient children not fashioning yourselves notice that word fashioning not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance that word fashioning is the same word that's found in romans 12 2 where he talks about not conforming be not conformed to this world it's the same greek word it's the only two times it's mentioned in the new testament don't be fashioned don't be conformed to the world but he says be transformed so the idea is not forming or modeling your life they were not to make their own former principles and conduct the model listen when we start a home sometimes we want to make our family the model for that home and there's some things that are good we can get from our family but the model has to be the word when we start a church we want the model to be some other great church but the model has to be the word so he said don't don't fashion yourself don't model yourselves according to the way you used to act you're to be different you're governed by new laws molding your life in a different way so paul tells us don't be conformed to the world but be transformed and that word transformed is metamorphosis it's a changing of a creature into something else so brother brown said it goes into that he said now this word transformed i'll come back to first peter chapter one in a moment this word transformed he said i looked up in the dictionary he said when i almost lost track of the time that i was to be up here he said i was looking for a text and he said i found the scripture in the dictionary it's something that's changed it's to be changed transform made different than what it was that's what god did for us isn't it made me different from what i was well you said when did he do that well it may have been at a certain time we can point back to but that's not when you were fully changed because you're different now than you were as i said 10 years ago and hopefully better as a child of god you change for the better but what's happened you're being transformed so he said don't be conformed but be transformed it's he said it's made different than what it was it's been his character and everything has been changed to transform and he said i was thinking this morning in genesis 1 that this world was without form and it was void darkness was upon the earth nothing but a complete chaos when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of eden that is the transforming power of god i love this that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it so he says don't be fashioned according to this world don't be molded to this world but be transformed like he did at the beginning what did that at the beginning the word and then the spirit come down and brooded over the word and brought it to life amen oh aren't we grateful for the word of god today when the world is in that condition and think about it you say well my life right now is chaotic but think of the garden of eden and how it came out of that chaos how did it reach that place because somebody there was seed there that that manifested itself into a garden of eden it was the word of god god said let there be whatever god has spoken about you has already been spoken it's already been thought you realize that we've already been it's already been thought he's not going to change it now whatever he thought about you has already been thought and so the fact that he won't change it means you don't have to worry it's going to come out all right why because he's going to take a total chaos over here to a garden of eden he's transforming but he doesn't do that overnight it doesn't happen in one meeting doesn't happen there may be a time that it clicks but that won't be the end of it it'll continue to be transformed aren't you glad some of you have known 10 15 20 years some of you haven't i've just recently met but aren't you glad that you don't have to be the person you was when you met me and i don't have to be the person that i was when i met you glad i'm not the person that i was first time i think i i come here one of the first times i come here brother john lafontaine was here i'm glad i'm not that 16 year old anymore and i remember after that coming and allen was on the drums but i'm he's probably glad he's not the same person back then or now that he was back then all of us i think could say that what is that the transforming power of god amen it takes something that's nothing that's me make something wonderful out of it to be transformed is to be changed and made something different i love the way a prophet of god just explains this so simply he said like a tadpole it's transformed from a tadpole to a frog even our children can understand that it's a tadpole it doesn't look nothing like a frog but after a while you begin to see little legs sticking out after a while its body begins to change it loses that fat then it goes different places and it comes down it's got a little bug ice what is it it's a frog that's what it was all the time that's the potentials that it had but it has to become that so he says be transformed like a tadpole is transformed from a tadpole to a frog see once he looked like a catfish he swims around he's got a head on his tail everything looks just like a catfish after a while he begins to lose he loses the tail and he's transformed from one specie to another like a butterfly being changed from what he is and that's what metamorphosis is that's where we get that from that greek word we should be transformed be changed from a from a little caterpillar to a butterfly verse 15 says but as he which has called you is holy first peter 1 15 so be holy in all manner of conversation that's lifestyle not just part of your life but all of your life all manner of lifestyle big manner of life because it is written be holy for i am holy and brother branham says this about this it's godliness sanctification he says you believe in sanctification be holy for i am holy now you cannot be holy well that's interesting he said be holy and the prophet of god says you can't be holy he said i'm not depending on my holiness that's why we need a new birth because it's something inside it's not us you can't be holy i'm not depending on my holiness i have none but i'm depending on his holiness it's his holiness that i'm looking at not with not what i was but what he is amen you don't have to tell a sheep to bear wool or you go up to a sheep as brother branham taught and he must be born again you don't sit there and tell it manufacture me some wool well it can't do it it bears wool and if you take that sheep and feed it the right diet and give it the right kind of care it'll always bear wool the same thing is true of our lives if you've been born again then you just take that sheep and you just you just put it in the right atmosphere it's going to do what sheep do other times it might act like a goat and usually it's because it's in the wrong atmosphere but that's not what's on the inside verse 17 he says if you call on the father who without respect of persons judges every according notice to every man's work without respect to persons whether it's a a pastor or or a laity whether it's a man that's been in the message for 40 years or one that's been a message for a year or a man or a woman or a boy or a girl doesn't matter he judges according to every man's work so he said pass the time of your journey here in fear and that fear is not torment as we know but godly fear in proverbs it says happy is the man that feareth always happy is the man that feareth always now that's not to be afraid and you know that to be to be in terror all the time but it says he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief so what is fearing is keeping a soft heart happy is the man that's always respectful and recognizes that god is watching and david says i'm paraphrasing but in the psalms he says everything i do is at the throne of god i know he sees me amen so in verse 18 first peter 1 18 says for as much as you know you were not redeemed with corruptible things silver and gold from your vain conversation or your vain manner of life received by tradition from your fathers you can't be saved by those works either good works or emotions so he said you had a a manner of life and they would dress a certain way and have a certain identity as jews but that doesn't make them born again and if we're not careful we get into that in the message where we have a certain way of doing things and we think well that saves us but he said you weren't saved by your vain manner of life received by tradition from your fathers you can't be saved by works you can't be saved by anything you do you saved verse 19 with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you aren't you glad he was manifested for you that which was predestined listen he said he was fortunate for ordained before the foundation of the world but that which was predestined become a reality and predestination doesn't exist just in god's mind but he predestined us to be conformed to the image of his son to make it all the way through it's not just a concept but it's a reality first peter 1 21 who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren you don't have to fake loving god's people why because you've been born again you're the same blood of the same spirit he said unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently i like the way the god's word version puts this it says love each other with a warm love that comes from the heart after all you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth as a result you have a sincere love for each other verse 23 this is what i'm getting to tonight and all of this is peter writes it all together he's telling a story he's giving us an example some examples he says being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever what are you born again by by the word by the word brother brown says and i'm going to hurry through this because we're losing time and i know what time it is tonight so we're losing time but brother branham says if a man is born of the word being born again he quotes the scripture he says he will produce the word that makes us all check up doesn't it the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him his works therefore will be scriptural he talks about what an indictment that will be to that pergamy and age and he goes on on the next quote he said in fact the word is judging even now it is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it cuts us under the cardinal from the spiritual it makes us living epistles read and known of all men to the glory of god he said i know your works i know that works and brother brahman says this if a man fears that he might not please god then let him fulfill the word he said well i can't be saved by works right but your works show if you are saved that's true you can't be saved apart from works in the sense that brother branham said it's like this that he said you'd say you have faith but after a while if you say you're married and the wife never shows up after a while people quit believing you you say you're married she don't ever show up and say every time i invite you over it's just you saying where's that wife at so that's the way works are they show up eventually because it's part of who you are he said if a man wonders if you'll hear those words well done good and faithful servant that's what i want to hear that's what i want to hear at the end i want that from you if i'm here for 20 years 50 years if god terry's if i'm here for a year i want to i want to hear from you that that i was faithful but most of all i want to hear from him isn't that your desire today if a man wants to hear those words let him fulfill the word of god in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of truth was the criterion then it is the criteria now there isn't another standard there isn't another plumb line is the world is going to be judged by one christ jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is how he is making out let him do as james suggests look into the mirror of god's word verse 24 this is important for born of were born of corruptable seed he says not incorrupt or incorruptable seed not corruptable and this is why he said because why that's important because all flesh is grass is as grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withers and the flower thereof falleth away and so if our works are what saves us or if an emotion is what saves us when that withers we're not saved anymore if we're saved because we trust a man any man even ourselves our own flesh we're saved because we trust anybody man if we say because we trust in any arm of flesh when that withers when that falls away we're not saved no more but he says verse 25 the word of the lord endures forever then if you're saved god didn't save you to lose you right he saved you to keep you he didn't bring you in to lose you so if you're saved not to be lost then what happens the word of the lord endures forever if you're saved to not be lost you have to be saved by the word and so this is the most important thing but it's the thing sometimes we give the least time in in our lives but the word is so important because this he said this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you what word the word that saves you the word that keeps you to the end now if we're not careful as brother brown said you must be born again he talks about false teachers who bring false births god help us to not do this false teachers bring false births why because they point to something else other than the word that's why brother branham is so careful not to draw us away from the word and to tell us if he didn't have scripture for it that he didn't right because sometimes people take this both ways they'll tell the people you can do whatever you want to based on what their own word well then salvation comes from him and it produces false births and then on the other side people say well you can as long as you don't do this that makes you different it means you're saved we need to be careful about pointing out any one thing and calling out that the antichrist any one thing and calling that the the thing that'll no it's it's a life in christ that makes you saved that shows that you're saved but we call it one thing we say well that's the antichrist that's the wrong thing but the word of the lord endures forever and if you point out just if all you do is become against what that one thing you produce false births it's a lopsided teaching of the gospel and i say god help me to do that because so many people it's easy to differentiate yourself you realize that if you preach false doctrine more people come and i don't say that because i believe god's going to fill this church up so i don't say that because i want to have a small church but that's that's my faith to believe that empty pews never inspired anybody right but but but in reality you say well that's not true well look at the message and look at denominations who has the biggest churches the people that are that are the craziest when it comes to what they believe i mean you look at the huge mega churches in this country and they don't teach anything right they don't teach anything at all most of them why because people people will flock to that but the real bride has to hear the word and false teachers bring false verse but true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word christ false prophets will bring false birth the birth of churches the birth of creeds the birth of denominations that's where isms come from in the message false prophets producing false births to produce an ism that makes people think they're saved because they believe it and we're not over that it'll come again the lord tarries there'll be more there'll be more we've seen many come down the pike but there will be more people with with a special revelation or something different and people will flock to that because it makes them feel revelated but false teachers produce false births and it's a birth of denominationalism he said here you are a pentecostal brother he said false sensations tell a man he's got the holy ghost because he speaks with tongues i've seen devils speak with tongues pencils lay down write an unknown toast he said that don't mean a thing see it's got to be a life by their fruit so you know you shall know them brother branham do you believe in speaking in tongues yes sir do you believe in shouting yes sir to be a christian i believe that i believe god's word but if the life isn't there to back it up you see when mary left jesus at the temple but the realm talks about a birth of the word it's the birth of christ and he types that and he talks about how that it's been revealed in this hour that we understand that that birth was without sensation now why is that important it means that man didn't handle it man wasn't involved in it he was god it wasn't it wasn't joseph that did it it wasn't mary that did it but without sensation the seed was put there oh my now so mary when jesus becomes 12 years old she leaves jesus at the temple and then she comes back and she says your father and i have been looking for you for days and brother branham is kind of hard on mary if you go back and listen to it he really is he says he says she denied the word and i know what you know just if you think about her at that time you know thinking about that all she was thinking about man we found him she thought she lost what she'd been entrusted you know it's a big deal you lost the virgin born son of god at the in jerusalem somewhere it's one thing we leave one of our kids in in walmart or something but she lost god if we could put it like that and she went back to find him and when she found him she said your father and i have been doing that because peace you know people when they deny the word in their lives they usually do it in a stressful situation but by doing that she attributed the birth to a sensation father and i she pointed to something that they could do in other words we brought you into the world we can take you out no not in that situation why i can tell my kids that because it's true but they couldn't say that why because she was not his earth his mother in that sense she he was joseph was not his father but he was the created son of god amen and brother branham says that he said pentecost took speaking in tongues he said and they denied the birth of the word and this is what he's talking about he said that's exactly what it did he said it'll take so much of it but it won't take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like mary did he said but watch there will not be any more organizations after this why because this bride will have a birth in the word and will not deny it will not attribute it to any man well that gives me hope tonight that gives me faith as we're closing in just a moment that that this bride will not fall why because they will not attribute the new birth to something other than the work of god will not attribute it to any man and i don't care which man it is he had nothing to do with your birth because if he did you've got a problem you're only as saved as he is oh church and no flesh is saved only the seed so there has to be a birth of the word that will not deny that the word is all that it took visions 2 8 tells us for by grace that you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast and say i did that for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus so it wasn't that god got together with your pastor and produced you as the son of god no god got together with brother branham and produced you as the son of god that's not how it works we're his workmanship how by the word we're created in him what created him that word circled the earth for all of those years a virgin shall conceive and one day it dropped down into a predestined vessel what happens with us the word comes to us at a predetermined time and place and we become birthed by the word and no one had any part in it but god you say well it was when brother so-and-so was preaching but it's not him that did it he was just preaching the word it was a certain song that i heard it could be that a certain testimony but it was the word not just the emotion of the music but the word saved by the word we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained we should walk and the musicians come how do i know i'm born again how do i know i'm saved because the word awakened that transforming power of christ in my life to change me from a tadpole to what i was meant to be i know this doesn't make everybody excited but i think it'll feed our souls i pray it will i'm changed from a tadpole that's what i was just a you ever if you've handled a tadpole just a gooey lump of cells swimming around in the dirt somewhere i remember my grandpa had a farm and out on the farm there would be holes where he got a tractor every little holes when it would rain there would be puddles of water and tadpoles coming in puddles of water and swim around in that muck and that fire that's what i was but i believe what god says is true amen i believe that the word is true you believe it tonight that his requirements have come god's provided way have come according to the word and and one day i began to look at the fruit of my life and i began to see evidence but i had to believe it first saved by faith through grace amen amen and then they're saved by grace through faith and then i believe what god says i met his requirements all of a sudden the evidence begins to show my faith this truth was true brother brandon put it this way god come down in that muck where what you were and sought you out and brought you out he said and then after creating a perfect love look what you was look what you are what did that what transformed you somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word we believe that tonight we should judge nothing before the time because this has changed yet even your own flesh because the body of this flesh is not saved because of that we'll always have to believe as long as we're in this body one day what we believe becomes reality one day i'll just look at my hands and they're different one day i look at my feet and they're different i'm in a new body i've endured to the end and either endures to the end to be safe i say well does that make you fearful no it makes me confident it makes me determined to keep on going there's nothing before the time don't judge me before the time but let me go on i might fall and and have problems here and things that you know maybe maybe i just misconstrue something or get something wrong but i'm coming back up i'll get back up why i'm a son of god the old flesh will do a lot of things but i have faith that what he promised will come to pass and one day i can say i've endured to the end that which is perfect is come that which is perfect is coming i can say it's sweet to trust in jesus just to take him at his word it just meant so much to me that just just to rest on that promise say thus saith the lord to know thus saith the lord bow your heads with me i apologize i've dragged it out a little bit tonight but i know you're tired but i i believe the word of god can change us we need our life rewritten we needed the story of our life to be rewritten and mercy did that i'm so grateful for that but we keep changing we don't stop so i try to give us an opportunity every service if i can just take a moment reflect on the word and say lord change me change me make me different what i was i was a tadpole i've come i've got to decide something in me i can see that there's part of me that still wants that world that flesh it's on me but there's something inside of me it's changing i'm not going to rest on emotion i'm not going to rest on something that happened at one point although those things are wonderful but i'm going to rest on the word you say i'm saved lord you say i belong to you and so i believe that i believe that with all of my heart and my faith i'm going to walk forward i'm going to keep growing let that be your prayer tonight heavenly father i'm so grateful for your mercy and your love so grateful for your presence that we feel among us lord maybe there's one on streaming tonight that lord they've heard this and maybe they realize i'm a son of god i don't belong to the world i don't have to live this way anymore you just grant that to them lord they'd be able to be saved to be changed to be cleansed oh god for us that are here and for those that are watching that are saved born again i pray heavenly father that you'd help them pray that you'd help me lord we want to grow we don't want to ever stop growing help me never be contented lord lord as we we're trying to work and fix up things around the church and do everything we can may we be that way spiritually lord may we be restless when it comes to these things and always though we rest in your promise but when it comes to our works may we always look and see lord i can do this better i can move forward i can build up those fortifications even when i'm not on the battle let me build up the fortifications because i know a battle is coming let me gird up the loins of my mind let me grab hold and take every thought captive because it begins as a thought and then it becomes something that'll make me do something that i wish i hadn't done oh god let me let me follow you with all of my heart god with my family tonight lord what i am at home is who i am just being honest tonight lord lord would you help me to be a better light to my family or when i am at home if i'm if i'm not the person at home that i am at church it does nothing none of this matters oh god help me to be the right kind of a husband the right kind of a father oh lord each one of us father we want to be close to you we want to walk right we want to do the things we should do or we know it's not about our works it's what you did for us you it was your mercy and it continues to be your mercy lord but you give us little opportunities to clean things up and wash our feet that have been dirty and dusty because of the world that we live in help us to do that tonight lord forgive us forgive us of sin forgive us of lord not taking the diligent look at our lives that we should have forgive us lord where we've been negligent the lord did not testify not not done the things we we should have done oh god forgive us lord sometimes we lack and not worshiping you like we should lord would you forgive us for that you've done so much for us lord truly where you are there's a lot of noise but you're working
