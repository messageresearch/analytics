[17:28] Well, I was on the verge of giving
[17:33] [Music]
[17:35] over. The strength within myself just

[18:28] my

[26:12] morning, we want to send our condolences
[26:14] to uh the Ward family. Brother Danny's
[26:16] younger sister passed away earlier this
[26:19] week and we just want to say uh we want
[26:21] to be in prayer for the family and just
[26:24] remember them through this difficult
[26:25] time. and and we are a family here at
[26:27] the church. And so when one goes through
[26:29] something like that, you know, it
[26:30] doesn't just affect them, although it
[26:32] affects affects them the hardest, but we
[26:34] want to just really just buckle down and
[26:36] pray for the family. And just like it
[26:38] was your own family member that passed
[26:40] away. So just remember, but I know where
[26:42] she is. And I believe I I love the
[26:44] testimony from Sister Vicki. She said,
[26:46] "We know where she's at. You know, she's
[26:48] got her new body." And so they will, you
[26:50] know, as Christians, we have a hope that
[26:52] we will see each other again. Amen. And
[26:54] that's what that's what really keeps us
[26:56] going through the battles of life. That
[26:58] even if death would take you out, that's
[27:00] not the finality of it at all. Amen. But
[27:02] there is a land. You believe it? There
[27:04] is a land. So just remember brother
[27:06] Danny and his family in prayer. Also, um
[27:09] Richard Mansfield, there's an unspoken
[27:12] request from Sister Alice for him. So
[27:14] just remember that need in prayer. The
[27:16] Lord knows every need. And brother
[27:18] Stewart, I'm going to ask you to come
[27:20] and uh grab one of them microphones
[27:22] there, buddy. just take these needs to
[27:24] the Lord in prayer. If you have a need
[27:26] on your heart this morning, would you
[27:27] just make it known by an uplifted hand
[27:29] and you love the Lord this morning?
[27:33] Let's just go before him in prayer.
[27:34] Lord, we love you so much. Lord, we just
[27:37] come before your throne this morning, a
[27:39] needy people, Lord, and we come boldly,
[27:42] Lord. And knowing that you're able,
[27:44] Lord, you're you went through every
[27:45] temptation, every bit of suffering,
[27:48] Lord. And and Lord, you know what it is
[27:50] to be human this morning. you know what
[27:51] it is for your children to go through
[27:53] things. And so we come this morning in
[27:55] the name of Jesus Christ to the one that
[27:57] can that can move on our behalf, Lord.

[28:13] richer, we pray that you would just move
[28:15] upon this person's life and whatever the
[28:17] need would be there, Lord, you're more
[28:19] than able. We just pray this morning for
[28:21] the Ward family that you would bring
[28:23] comfort, that you would bring strength,
[28:24] Lord, and in their time of of of what
[28:27] they're going through, Lord. We just

[28:40] of the day and the next week. And Lord,
[28:43] may we just be able to benefit and get
[28:45] everything we can from this service.
[28:47] Lord, may we just enter into worship,
[28:49] enter into your presence, Lord, the
[28:51] things that are said and done here. We
[28:53] pray that you would bless it, Lord, our

[28:57] quite well, but we pray that you would
[28:59] just touch him now, Lord. May you just

[29:03] morning, Lord. We love you so much. We

[41:04] day, the prince of
[41:07] darkness stood in his
[41:10] way. The angel overthrew him. I can hear
[41:14] Daniel
[41:16] say power in
[41:21] prayer. There's power in
[41:24] prayer. If you
[41:27] believe standing right there for you to
[41:33] receive problems you
[41:36] face all that you need.
[41:40] power in
[41:43] prayer. He's the God that won't
[41:48] fail you
[41:50] down. Cast all your cares on
[41:56] him. You can take a heartache, turn it
[42:02] around in prayer.
[42:08] Now I have prayed and no answer
[42:13] came. Days turned to weeks, grief turned
[42:18] to pain and I cried. Oh Lord, it seems
[42:24] that you haven't heard my prayer.
[42:31] God said, "I heard the first time you
[42:36] called, but Satan tried to block your
[42:40] answer and stall. Reinforcements been
[42:44] made. Satan's had to
[42:47] withdraw. There's power in
[42:52] prayer. There's power in prayer. If you
[42:58] believe standing right there for you to
[43:04] receive problems you
[43:07] face all that you
[43:10] need power in
[43:14] prayer. He's the God that won't fail but
[43:19] friends let you down.
[43:22] Cast all your cares on him cuz I
[43:26] found he can take a heartache, turn it
[43:32] around. It's power in
[43:36] [Music]
[43:38] prayer. Now I have prayed but no answer
[43:42] came.
[43:44] Days turned to weeks, grief turned to
[43:49] pain, and I cried. Oh Lord, it seems
[43:54] that you haven't heard my prayer.
[44:01] But God said I heard the first time you
[44:06] called. Satan tried to block your answer
[44:11] and reinforcements been made. Satan's
[44:15] had to
[44:17] withdraw.
[44:23] Power in prayer.
[44:26] If you
[44:28] believe standing right there for you to
[44:33] receive the problems you face, he's all
[44:38] that you need. His power in
[44:44] prayer. He's a God that won't fail when
[44:48] friends let you
[44:50] down. Cast all your cares on him. I
[44:56] found he can take a heartache, turn it
[45:01] around. There's power in
[45:05] [Music]
[45:07] prayer. He can take a heartache, turn it
[45:12] around. There's power in prayer.
[45:19] [Music]
[45:23] You believe that this morning that
[45:24] there's power in prayer? Amen. Let's
[45:26] stand together as we change the order of
[45:28] the service. Let's do that. Holy Spirit
[45:29] rain down in the key of
[45:31] F. Amen. Did you come to just hear the
[45:34] word of the Lord this morning and
[45:35] receive from what God has for us? Amen.
[45:38] How many's ready for the word?
[45:41] Amen. Sounded so good worshiping God. I
[45:43] believe God is pleased with your worship
[45:45] this morning. And I believe if you can
[45:47] just pull on the gift of God, I know the
[45:49] pastor's just a little under the
[45:50] weather, so just pull on him extra hard
[45:51] this morning. make him work for it. And
[45:54] uh I believe the Lord's going to come
[45:56] down and just touch somebody in this
[45:58] service this morning. You believe it?
[45:59] And if you have a need as the word goes
[46:01] forth, I know I say this every time I
[46:03] get up here, but I believe it with all
[46:04] my heart. As the word goes forth, it can
[46:06] change lives, bring deliverance, it can
[46:08] heal your body. I believe the word's got
[46:10] power in it. And I believe we might as
[46:12] well just go ahead and let it work on us
[46:14] this morning. So with all our hearts as
[46:15] our pastor comes, Holy Spirit
[46:21] rain
[46:23] down. Won't you
[46:27] rain? Rain
[46:30] down. Oh
[46:34] comforter and
[46:37] friend, how we need your touch once
[46:42] again.

[46:50] down. Won't you just
[46:53] rain pray
[46:57] down? Let your power fall. Let your
[47:02] voice be
[47:04] heard. Come and change our hearts as we
[47:08] stand on your word, Holy Spirit.
[47:16] Rain, rain down with all your hearts
[47:20] now.
[47:22] Oh, Holy Spirit,
[47:26] rain. Is that what you wanted to do this
[47:28] morning? Oh, won't you
[47:33] rain? Rain down.

[47:59] rain rain down?
[48:02] Oh, let your power fall. Let your voice
[48:08] be heard. Come and change our hearts as
[48:13] we stand on your word, Holy
[48:18] Spirit. It
[48:21] rain. Oh, rain
[48:25] down. Beloved this morning. Amen. You
[48:28] can have your seats for just a moment.
[48:29] That's all the music that we'll have
[48:31] this morning. Thank you for that. Just
[48:34] wonderful, wonderful words in the songs
[48:36] this morning. Because he lives, I can
[48:39] face tomorrow. Because he lives, all
[48:41] fear is gone. And and we heard about the
[48:44] goodness of God and the power of prayer.
[48:46] And that just blessed my heart this
[48:47] morning to see that. I There's a couple
[48:50] things I wanted to um go over with you
[48:54] before I begin preaching this morning.
[48:55] You just pray for me. I'll be able to
[48:57] that you'll be able to hear me and we'll
[49:00] make it through this morning.
[49:03] Um we're
[49:06] uh we've got just a couple of things.
[49:09] Brother Justin is most of you probably
[49:12] know this, but Justin White's going to
[49:13] be hope I'm not embarrassing you this
[49:15] morning, but he's going to be taking a
[49:16] new job back in Tennessee. And uh in his
[49:19] line of work, you kind of have to move
[49:20] where the work is, I guess. And and uh
[49:23] they're going to go back to Tennessee
[49:24] and and do that. They felt led to do
[49:27] that. And uh we've appreciated having
[49:29] them here, haven't we, for the last
[49:30] couple of
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:35] years. And so, uh, it's been such a
[49:38] blessing to have them here. Sister
[49:40] Stephanie shared with me, I'm hearing a
[49:42] ringing. I don't know if it's just me or
[49:43] if it's up here, but Sister Stephanie
[49:46] shared with me how much help she
[49:48] received here at the church. And and I
[49:51] appreciate you doing that. that meant so
[49:53] much to me because sometimes people come
[49:55] and go and and you don't think anything
[49:57] happened and and the Lord just really
[49:59] helped her through the ministry here and
[50:01] through you as a church body and and and
[50:03] I want to thank you for that. You always
[50:05] do that. You're so welcoming and so
[50:07] loving and I appreciate you. We want to
[50:09] stay that way. We don't want to ever get
[50:11] to where we're cold and formal and we
[50:13] don't we don't welcome new people. So,
[50:16] uh, we appreciate them, but we want to
[50:17] support, uh, Brother Justin, Sister
[50:19] Stephanie, and the children, and, um,
[50:21] maybe the Lord will wind their way back
[50:23] this direction one day. That's what I'm
[50:25] I'm praying for, but we'll be praying
[50:27] for them and believing the Lord will
[50:29] help them in their new venture. Uh, and
[50:32] so, we appreciate them. Uh, we've got, I
[50:36] never haven't mentioned brother Walt and
[50:37] Sister Alice Morgan with us and their
[50:39] daughter. So, Linda, it's good to have
[50:41] each one of you. and uh they've made
[50:44] this their church home for a few weeks
[50:45] now and I failed to mention that, but
[50:47] it's good to have you and we sure
[50:49] appreciate you being here with us. Go
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:53] ahead. We've got a couple of families I
[50:56] want you to keep in prayer. And the
[50:58] reason is because they haven't been able
[50:59] to be here lately because of work. And
[51:02] the Kings, Brother uh King and Sister
[51:04] Denise, they're um they've been gone for
[51:08] Nathan and Sister Denise, they've been
[51:09] gone for uh maybe a couple months now, a
[51:13] few months, and they're faithful. They
[51:16] count this as their church. They watch
[51:17] and pay their tithes and things, but
[51:18] they're out of state working. And would
[51:21] you just pray for them? We realize most
[51:23] of you that grew up in this area know
[51:25] how difficult it is to have a job.
[51:26] That's why so many of you drive so far
[51:28] to come to church. And you know how
[51:30] difficult that is. And yet, God has
[51:32] blessed us tremendously with jobs here
[51:34] in the church. And and people have been
[51:36] able to uh do things that uh uh kind of
[51:40] boggle my mind sometimes. how blessed
[51:41] that they've been financially and yet
[51:44] there's others that struggle and we want
[51:45] to pray for them that God will help them
[51:47] be able to find a job local. That's, you
[51:49] know, that's what we want so they can be
[51:50] in church and and I know there's others
[51:52] as well. Brother uh Jeremy Erskin, what
[51:55] a big blessing Jeremy and Rebecca have
[51:56] been to us and they've been in
[51:58] California lately. I think Rebecca may
[52:00] be coming back soon, but uh he's had to
[52:02] work out there. Um and uh we're just
[52:05] praying the Lord just changes that
[52:07] situation as well because we'd rather
[52:09] have them around us. And I think they'd
[52:12] be better off as well. And uh that's
[52:14] what we want to believe anyway. And but
[52:15] the Lord has a plan, doesn't he? And but
[52:18] it's our it's our uh desire that they'd
[52:20] be able to be here and be in the church
[52:22] service with us. Just know that you got
[52:24] more support. I know sometimes on
[52:25] Wednesday nights uh the crowd can get
[52:27] kind of small and then on Sunday morning
[52:29] you see most people here and it's
[52:30] exciting. But but uh there's there's
[52:33] more out there. It's kind of like when
[52:35] Elijah felt like he was all alone. He
[52:36] said there's 7,000 that haven't bowed
[52:38] their knee to bail. just sometimes jobs
[52:40] keep them out and things keep them out
[52:41] of the house of God. We're just
[52:43] believing that'll change and and and
[52:45] maybe it be some that maybe don't have
[52:46] the desire they need to have to come to
[52:48] church. We pray God will change that too
[52:51] because that you know there's got to be
[52:53] something in your heart. We don't we
[52:55] don't require attendance. We don't count
[52:57] which how many services you attend in a
[52:59] year. But we're just believing that uh a
[53:01] Christian is going to want to be in the
[53:03] house of God as much as they can. And
[53:05] there will be things that keep you out.
[53:07] But we're just believing the Lord will
[53:08] will help each one of us as we go
[53:10] forward. We don't know how long we've
[53:12] got here, but we know we're going to
[53:14] fight. We're going to keep planting our
[53:15] potatoes. We're going to keep building
[53:16] the church, doing everything we can for
[53:18] the church, for your families. We're
[53:19] going to do everything we can until the
[53:21] day we leave here. Can you say amen to
[53:23] that today? Let's just bind together and
[53:25] do that. Amen. Amen. I think that um uh
[53:29] well, there's a couple other things. One
[53:30] is our banquet. We got our meetings
[53:32] coming up and that's exciting in July,
[53:34] but our banquet in August. Uh some of
[53:36] your young people if you want to go
[53:37] ahead and sign them up. I know $25, you
[53:39] sitting there thinking, well, I could
[53:40] wait and spend that $25 later. But if
[53:43] you have any trouble with that, if you
[53:44] got several children and that's a a
[53:46] burden to you, just ask me and I'll I'll
[53:48] cover that for you. We're going to have
[53:50] a catered meal uh for that banquet for
[53:52] the young people 13 to to 30 unmarried.
[53:55] if we don't fill up, maybe some of our
[53:57] 12-year-olds kind of on the edge can go
[53:59] uh as well, but we'll just wait and see
[54:01] how that works. But if you're eligible
[54:03] to go, go ahead and sign up if you want
[54:05] to and and so we know who all is going
[54:07] to be there. And um so we'll do that.
[54:10] It's been five years since we were voted
[54:13] in officially. This Sunday is five
[54:15] years. And all I've got to say about
[54:17] that is through many dangers, toils, and
[54:19] snares, we have already come. and his
[54:23] grace that brought us safe this far.
[54:26] Aren't you glad for his grace and grace
[54:29] will lead us home. I couldn't be more
[54:31] happy with you as a church. Brother
[54:33] Brandon said if the church is happy and
[54:34] the pastor is happy then then uh things
[54:37] will get along real well. So I sure and
[54:39] I sure want to do the best job I can for
[54:41] you. If I'm ever not doing what I'm
[54:43] should be doing or I miss you in some
[54:44] way, come and tell me. I I'd be glad to
[54:47] to hear that. But I I want sure want to
[54:49] do the right thing for you and uh we'll
[54:51] get all out of here one of these days. I
[54:53] know I can't carry people to heaven, but
[54:55] I'm going to do everything I can to
[54:56] encourage them to go. So, we're just
[54:58] believing that. And brother Joel here
[55:00] with me. What a blessing Brother Joel
[55:02] has been. And brother Stewart, Brother
[55:03] Stewart's ministry has just taken off.
[55:06] And I've watched Joel's ministry. I'm
[55:07] kind of have to keep him here uh because
[55:10] I feel like he's going to be going out
[55:11] more, but we're just believing that that
[55:13] he'll just decide to stay here with us
[55:15] and preach for us more. But but brother
[55:17] Stewart ministry's deepened so much over
[55:19] the last couple years and what a
[55:21] blessing he is to me uh in in doctrinal
[55:24] things and things like that. I I really
[55:26] appreciate that. We that's what we feed
[55:27] on is the word and that's when
[55:29] everything else gives way, we always
[55:32] want to come back to the word and
[55:33] realize we got a hope in the word of
[55:35] God. This message is everything to us
[55:37] and so we we love it and we believe it.
[55:40] Let's stand together. I believe he that
[55:42] has begun a good work will keep it until
[55:44] that day. Do you believe that?
[55:46] Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[55:48] bearing with me for just a moment. I
[55:50] can't preach real long this morning
[55:51] because I forgot to plug in my my iPad.
[55:57] So, so it uh we'll just see how that
[56:01] goes. Of course, brother Joel, his
[56:03] wouldn't matter if his died or not.
[56:05] But I want to speak to you this morning
[56:08] out of Matthew 5:13. Matthew 5:13-16.
[56:12] I want to title this this morning basket
[56:15] cases. Basket cases or why we are
[56:19] unafraid of fellowship. That's kind of
[56:22] an odd title, but I think you'll see
[56:24] where I'm going after we get going this
[56:26] morning. Matthew 5:13 says, "You are the
[56:29] salt of the earth. But if the salt have
[56:32] lost his savior, wherewith shall it be
[56:34] salted? It is thenforth good for nothing
[56:37] but to be cast out and to be trodden
[56:39] underfoot of men. Ye are the light of
[56:42] the world. A city that is set on a hill
[56:44] cannot be hid. Neither do men light a
[56:47] candle and put it under a bushel, but on
[56:50] a candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[56:51] all that are in the house. Let your
[56:54] light so shine before men, that they may
[56:56] see your good works and glorify your
[56:58] father which is in heaven. I pray the
[57:00] Lord would add his blessing to the word.
[57:02] Let's bow our heads for just a moment.
[57:03] Heavenly Father, we want to approach you
[57:05] in prayer before we begin. And Lord,
[57:07] realizing that the the success of the
[57:09] service is completely up to you. I pray
[57:12] God that you'd move me out of the way
[57:13] and speak directly to each individual.
[57:16] Lord, maybe there'd be something that's
[57:17] not even in my notes, Lord, that that
[57:19] you'd have me to say that would help
[57:20] somebody. And I pray that you you'd help
[57:22] me to be humble enough and simple enough
[57:24] to do that. Pray you'd grant that, Lord.
[57:26] Move me out of the way and speak. We
[57:28] pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[57:31] You could be seated this morning.
[57:34] basket cases or why we are unafraid of
[57:38] fellowship. Jesus is making the case to
[57:40] the disciples if you read back a little
[57:42] bit that even during
[57:44] persecution and especially during
[57:47] persecution salt needs to contact
[57:50] because it can't save, it can't preserve
[57:53] unless it contacts. And light needs to
[57:56] be public, right? Salt needs to contact
[57:59] and light needs to be public. You you
[58:03] are salt. That's what Jesus said. You
[58:05] are salt as long as you have savor. In
[58:08] other words, as long as you have lost
[58:10] your potency. And and so, you know, salt
[58:13] is kept fresh in private, right? And
[58:16] that's the way our lives are. We we're
[58:18] kept fresh in private. We That's where
[58:20] we gain our strength. That's where we
[58:22] gain our potency to be a witness. It's
[58:24] in private. It's in our prayer time.
[58:26] It's in our study of the word. It's in
[58:27] our It's in our wrestling things out
[58:30] with God. That's where that's where salt
[58:32] actually gains its its potency or keeps
[58:35] its potency. But it must contact to do
[58:38] any good. So you've got to take the salt
[58:40] and you got to put it on the food. Is
[58:42] that right, brother Trip? You you just
[58:44] got to take the salt and put it on the
[58:45] food. You can't you can't leave the salt
[58:48] off or your food is unseasoned and it
[58:50] won't won't be saved. So salt is not
[58:53] used for itself, right? It's used to
[58:57] save other things and season other
[58:59] things. So, it's used for completely for
[59:03] Nobody goes and gets a bunch, at least I
[59:05] don't think they do. Nobody gets a bunch
[59:06] of salt and just sits there and eats it.
[59:08] But it's really good when you have it on
[59:11] other things. So, salt is used to save
[59:14] other things and season other things.
[59:16] And and then he uses the example of a
[59:17] candle. A candle actually consumes
[59:20] itself to give light. So it's kind of an
[59:24] oxymoron, but the the the brighter the
[59:27] candle burns, the more it is consumed,
[59:30] right? So you you find that the faster
[59:33] it melts because it's burning brighter.
[59:36] But that's its purpose, right? Its
[59:38] entire purpose of the candle is to is to
[59:42] burn up so that others can see. So in
[59:47] Matthew 5:14 again, he said, "You are
[59:49] the light of the world. A city that is
[59:52] set on a hill cannot be hid. Like you're
[59:55] going to see it. It's going to be found.
[59:57] Verse 15. Neither do men light a candle
[1:00:00] and put it under a bushel. Now that word
[1:00:02] bushel actually means a basket. It's a
[1:00:05] basket used for measuring grain. So you
[1:00:08] don't put your candle under a basket or
[1:00:10] you are quite literally a basket
[1:00:14] case. You see what I'm doing there?
[1:00:18] That may be a little bit of a reach, but
[1:00:20] I just wanted you to remember it. So, if
[1:00:21] you if you put your candle under a
[1:00:23] bushel, you're quite literally a basket
[1:00:25] case. So, and what is a basket case? If
[1:00:28] you go look up the definition of the
[1:00:29] word, it actually means useless.
[1:00:32] Useless. A basket case is somebody that
[1:00:34] is just lost it emotionally. They just
[1:00:37] they just can't uh can't do anything and
[1:00:39] because they're just a basket case,
[1:00:41] right? They're just useless because
[1:00:43] they're so stirred up or so upset. And
[1:00:45] so you say someone is a basket case
[1:00:47] there. Uh and and so uh a basket case
[1:00:50] light under a bushel is literally
[1:00:52] useless and will go out. So brother
[1:00:56] Brandham speaks of
[1:00:57] denomination as that bushel basket right
[1:01:02] that that hides the light. So I want you
[1:01:04] to keep that in your mind. organization,
[1:01:06] denomination is the bushel basket that
[1:01:09] hide hides the light because in an
[1:01:12] effort to keep the light in an effort to
[1:01:15] preserve it, in an effort to uh to make
[1:01:19] sure that nothing bothers it, maybe to
[1:01:20] shield it from the wind. We we had
[1:01:22] denominational basket weavers that made
[1:01:26] uh baskets to put over the light of the
[1:01:28] word and said, "This is as far as we're
[1:01:30] going to go." But that candle was meant
[1:01:32] to be burned up in its age and the next
[1:01:34] one to come on, right? But but yet they
[1:01:37] couldn't see that. And so they built a
[1:01:38] denominational bushel basket put over
[1:01:41] it. Brother Brandon says, "You are the
[1:01:42] light of the world." But if it's hid by
[1:01:43] a denominational bushel basket, how are
[1:01:45] they going to see it? For your
[1:01:47] traditions, you make the light of no
[1:01:49] effect. So the the the denominational
[1:01:52] bushel basket could be creeds and dogmas
[1:01:54] and traditions outside the message of
[1:01:56] the hour. And and sometimes even as
[1:01:59] message people, we tend to get into that
[1:02:01] where we're adding things to the
[1:02:03] message, adding burdens that we don't
[1:02:04] want to bear ourselves, but we add
[1:02:06] burdens for other people to bear that
[1:02:08] brother Brandham didn't really say or
[1:02:09] the or the Bible doesn't speak of
[1:02:11] clearly. And so we just kind of kind of
[1:02:13] our opinion and we just kind of add it
[1:02:15] like it's fact. And what are we doing?
[1:02:17] We're building a basket over the light.
[1:02:19] And we're if we're not careful, our
[1:02:21] tradition makes the light of no effect.
[1:02:23] He said by trying, he said, you
[1:02:25] denominational trying to keep the light
[1:02:27] away from your church. He said, neither
[1:02:29] you, he said, you won't go in, neither
[1:02:31] will you let them. Yeah. Right. So there
[1:02:34] the the basket keeps everything out,
[1:02:36] keeps everything in.
[1:02:38] So the basket obviously is turned upside
[1:02:41] down on the the candle and it hides it
[1:02:44] from its purpose. So Jesus again is
[1:02:47] speaking of persecution when he says
[1:02:49] that knowing it would be natural to hide
[1:02:51] from persecution. But he said, 'If you
[1:02:53] if you hide, you can't serve your
[1:02:55] purpose. And I wish more people in the
[1:02:58] message had understood that earlier on,
[1:03:00] maybe we'd be further down the road than
[1:03:01] what we are. But if we hide, we can't
[1:03:04] serve our purpose. There's no point in
[1:03:06] hiding our services. There's no point in
[1:03:08] hiding. And people say, "Well, you
[1:03:09] should just cut everything off and hide
[1:03:11] everything from the from the public." I
[1:03:13] don't see a point in that when we're
[1:03:15] actually called to be the light of the
[1:03:17] world. If we believe what we're
[1:03:19] preaching, if we believe what we're
[1:03:20] saying, if we believe this is the best
[1:03:22] way to live, if we believe that the
[1:03:24] Lord's coming, if we believe that things
[1:03:25] are things are only going to get worse
[1:03:27] in the world, but we're going up one of
[1:03:28] these days, we should want everybody to
[1:03:30] know about that.
[1:03:34] So, my purpose
[1:03:35] today, and Satan has fought me this
[1:03:38] week, and in my body, but I think it's
[1:03:41] just a maybe maybe it's meant to be
[1:03:44] said. Maybe I needed to slow down to say
[1:03:46] it in the right way. But my purpose
[1:03:48] today is to be a voice and not to be
[1:03:50] different, but to explain and defend why
[1:03:54] we do what we do when it comes to
[1:03:56] fellowship and outreach and and
[1:03:59] spreading the light and even missionary
[1:04:01] work. So we I want to defend what we do.
[1:04:04] And when I say what we do there, I have
[1:04:06] an approach. We have an approach as a
[1:04:08] church to uh to the way we fellowship
[1:04:11] with people and who we fellowship with.
[1:04:12] And we get to choose that, right? We we
[1:04:15] get to choose who we fellowship with,
[1:04:16] who we promote, what meetings we go to,
[1:04:18] things like that. And I want to defend
[1:04:20] because most of you know I've kept that
[1:04:22] wide open. And I've tried to go even
[1:04:24] when it wasn't convenient for me to go.
[1:04:26] But I've been questioned about that. And
[1:04:28] I've had people, not from our church,
[1:04:29] but I've had people that uh told me I
[1:04:32] was pandering. I've had people that told
[1:04:34] me that I just trying to get in a group
[1:04:36] and things like that. And I want to I
[1:04:38] want to challenge your thinking on that
[1:04:39] because we haven't changed what we
[1:04:40] preach here. We haven't changed what we
[1:04:43] do here, right? What we do is is is our
[1:04:46] local church, the sovereignty of our
[1:04:47] local church. And the things that I
[1:04:49] preach are the things I've preached most
[1:04:50] of my life. It's just more depth of the
[1:04:52] word and and things that we've come
[1:04:53] into. But I've not changed what we do or
[1:04:56] what we preach. I've been doing this for
[1:04:57] for 25 years. We don't uh I'm not
[1:05:00] changing that. I still believe in the
[1:05:01] blood. I still believe in the cross. I I
[1:05:03] still believe in in grace. I still
[1:05:05] believe that that that the last one
[1:05:07] hasn't come in or we would be gone. And
[1:05:08] and so on. The big things, we've stayed
[1:05:10] the same. And so I I I want people to
[1:05:13] understand that uh you know a lot of
[1:05:15] times what people think is compromise.
[1:05:17] And what they think is is is actually in
[1:05:20] a church if you can do it right, it
[1:05:22] could be compromise if you did it wrong.
[1:05:24] But if you did it right, it could
[1:05:26] actually be shining a light and helping
[1:05:28] people that need it. Because and let me
[1:05:31] say this, we need help, too. We're
[1:05:33] nobody anointed us as the only church in
[1:05:36] the message. That's right. There's other
[1:05:37] churches that can help us, other pastors
[1:05:39] that can help us. And my criteria for
[1:05:42] having a man to stand behind this pulpit
[1:05:43] is not how big his name is or or
[1:05:45] anything like that. It's regardless of
[1:05:48] that. I don't I don't use him because
[1:05:49] he's a big preacher or a small preacher.
[1:05:51] I use him because he helps the people a
[1:05:53] and because of fellowship and things
[1:05:54] that's helped the church. And so we'll
[1:05:57] do that and we'll continue to do that.
[1:05:58] So I I want to defend us a little bit in
[1:06:02] that and kind of help you understand why
[1:06:03] we do what we do if you ever wonder or
[1:06:06] if anyone questions it. Now, uh, and
[1:06:08] given that this has been 5 years since
[1:06:10] we've been here, you kind of know what
[1:06:11] we do, so I don't have to go into that
[1:06:13] too deeply. Now, in my experience, most
[1:06:16] of the separation that we see in the
[1:06:19] message, most of it, not all of it. Some
[1:06:22] of it need it needed to separate.
[1:06:25] But most of it is due to personal
[1:06:27] complexes,
[1:06:29] fights between preachers
[1:06:31] or congregations
[1:06:33] and differences of of opinion on
[1:06:35] something where there is no scriptural
[1:06:37] teaching, no clear scriptural teaching,
[1:06:39] no clear message teaching, and people
[1:06:41] just have a little different opinion
[1:06:42] over this. This person said, "Well, they
[1:06:44] don't believe the word." They don't
[1:06:45] believe your version of it.
[1:06:48] Right? That's really what it comes down
[1:06:50] to. And we need to learn to have grace
[1:06:52] for one another because the truth is
[1:06:53] we're not all going to do things the
[1:06:54] same. I'm reminded of that as my kids
[1:06:56] get older. And and and I'm not going to
[1:06:59] handle my children the same way you
[1:07:00] handle yours. And that's okay,
[1:07:04] right? I don't have to handle my ch You
[1:07:05] don't have to you don't have to take me
[1:07:07] as a as I'm just going to do what you
[1:07:09] do. You don't have to do that. You go
[1:07:10] according to the word. And I appreciate
[1:07:13] you taking advice and things like that,
[1:07:14] but you you go according to the word
[1:07:16] with your children. Don't just do what
[1:07:18] we do as a church. you you do what uh
[1:07:20] what what you know is right to do and
[1:07:22] you'll come out all right because we we
[1:07:25] uh a lot of times people will separate
[1:07:27] even in the church they'll get a little
[1:07:28] click here a little click there because
[1:07:30] that family's different or this person's
[1:07:32] different and they do things differently
[1:07:33] than they do and we don't want that here
[1:07:35] we we want to all come together and when
[1:07:37] we're together we need to be together
[1:07:38] and and and there's going to be natural
[1:07:41] divisions in the sense that some of the
[1:07:42] older men I noticed in the fellowship
[1:07:44] hall they'll come sit together and the
[1:07:45] younger men will sit together and that's
[1:07:47] natural birds of a feather flock
[1:07:48] together. But yet at the same time, we
[1:07:51] got to take time to cross out of those
[1:07:53] groups now and then. Talk to people we
[1:07:54] don't normally talk to because you might
[1:07:56] be a big help. Some of you young people
[1:07:58] might be a big help to some of our
[1:07:59] elders if you'd spend some time with
[1:08:00] them and talk to them and encourage them
[1:08:03] because they face discouragement every
[1:08:05] day. How do you know, brother Ben?
[1:08:06] Because I'm getting
[1:08:09] old. I'll be 40 this year. So, some of
[1:08:13] y'all that are twice my age, I don't
[1:08:14] know how you do it. I
[1:08:16] just It's just impossible. But the Lord
[1:08:18] helps you. I'm sure
[1:08:22] sometimes sometimes it's simply fear.
[1:08:26] Fear. A lot of times it's fear of a
[1:08:29] pastor because a pastor will feel like,
[1:08:32] well, I'm not as good a preacher as this
[1:08:33] other preacher. So if I have him in to
[1:08:35] preach or if I go to his meeting and
[1:08:38] support him, I'll lose people to him.
[1:08:41] And that's a real fear because, you
[1:08:43] know, in a small church, you miss
[1:08:44] everybody that leaves, right? You don't
[1:08:47] you it's not it's not that you don't
[1:08:49] notice. You really notice. There's a
[1:08:51] hole there. And so a lot of pastors just
[1:08:53] get to where they're defensive on that.
[1:08:55] And and but but it's still not right.
[1:08:59] Yeah. It's explainable, but it's not
[1:09:01] right.
[1:09:02] And and so and but sometimes it's fear
[1:09:04] of of fellowship. So they'll say, "Well,
[1:09:06] if I'm seen seen preaching to those
[1:09:08] people or fellowshipping with those
[1:09:10] people, I'll be excommunicated from my
[1:09:13] group or I'll lose pulpits." And I'll
[1:09:16] say this to ministers. We don't have
[1:09:17] very many ministers here this morning,
[1:09:19] but we got brother Stewart and brother
[1:09:21] uh Brother Joel, but uh we uh as they
[1:09:24] call him Brother Juel, but
[1:09:27] uh Brother Juel in the making right
[1:09:29] there. But if we if we uh what was I
[1:09:35] going to say? I cracked myself
[1:09:38] up. But in when talking to preachers, we
[1:09:41] want to make sure that we don't operate
[1:09:43] out of fear, but out of a desire to help
[1:09:45] people. And and my advice to young
[1:09:48] preachers, if you start preaching, you
[1:09:49] young men, maybe Jaden would be a
[1:09:51] minister or or or one of these boys
[1:09:54] right sitting right here, you all uh
[1:09:56] these these are fine young men, aren't
[1:09:57] they? and and they might decide and
[1:10:00] brother uh Landon over here with his
[1:10:03] suit on and tie. There's three young men
[1:10:05] sitting there with a suit and tie on and
[1:10:06] I like that. And and these young men are
[1:10:08] there and they're all different, but
[1:10:10] they might be preachers one day and not
[1:10:12] just the ones wearing suit and ties
[1:10:13] either because I didn't always wear a
[1:10:15] suit and tie when I was younger, but but
[1:10:17] you you know, you might be a minister
[1:10:19] someday. And remember
[1:10:20] this, find a way to support yourself.
[1:10:25] And that may sound like just kind of
[1:10:26] carnal advice, but you need to because
[1:10:29] if you can't support yourself where you
[1:10:31] can be dependent, what happens is then
[1:10:34] as your ministry grows, if you are, if
[1:10:36] God has called you with a gift to help
[1:10:37] people, eventually you get to the point
[1:10:39] where uh you feel like you're dependent
[1:10:41] on the whims of pastors and the whims of
[1:10:44] churches, you can't really preach what
[1:10:45] you want to because your family's going
[1:10:47] to suffer. And I'll say pastors
[1:10:50] shouldn't do that, right? There may be a
[1:10:52] man come and preach a weekend here and
[1:10:55] he may come and preach something I don't
[1:10:56] agree with at all. I will not withhold
[1:10:58] his offering because of that. That's
[1:11:00] right. Right. Especially if it's a
[1:11:02] full-time evangelist because the man's
[1:11:04] living from that. And the Bible says
[1:11:06] they have a right to do that. And I'm
[1:11:08] thankful y'all have kept me full-time
[1:11:09] these five years. But I've got a career
[1:11:12] that I could go back to if I had to.
[1:11:14] Right? Because and it's something that
[1:11:16] uh something that you do. You need
[1:11:18] something to do because you don't want
[1:11:20] to get to the point where you have to
[1:11:22] call people to go out and preach, right?
[1:11:24] You need to you need to be able to and I
[1:11:26] know there'll be others listening to
[1:11:27] this and I I've been very clear about
[1:11:29] this personally with some young men, but
[1:11:31] you need to you need to make sure that
[1:11:32] you're not calling people, but they're
[1:11:34] calling you. And that's when you know
[1:11:36] it's time to go full-time is when you
[1:11:38] can't stay home because they're calling
[1:11:40] you all the time. So, and there's very
[1:11:42] few because the world doesn't like what
[1:11:44] we preach much and and the worldly
[1:11:47] church doesn't like what we preach much.
[1:11:49] But, but I'll tell you what, I'd rather
[1:11:50] preach what we preach and work and and
[1:11:52] do the things I need to do, work with my
[1:11:54] hands if I have to, right, to preach
[1:11:56] what we preach because we believe it's
[1:11:57] the truth. Do you you believe it this
[1:11:59] morning?
[1:12:01] So, that was all introduction.
[1:12:05] So, I I want to and we'll start this
[1:12:07] this morning and maybe finish up just a
[1:12:09] few minutes before communion tonight.
[1:12:12] I'm looking forward to our communion
[1:12:13] service. I haven't had one in a while.
[1:12:15] But what should our attitude be towards
[1:12:18] these kinds of people? Number one,
[1:12:20] like-minded believers. And they've
[1:12:23] already got that on the screen. And then
[1:12:25] number two, believers with whom we
[1:12:27] disagree. Number three, nominal
[1:12:30] Christians. And then tonight we'll deal
[1:12:33] with those who are apostate or who have
[1:12:34] left who uh refuse to live right or
[1:12:38] something but claim to be believers. and
[1:12:40] those who were
[1:12:41] sinners. But and there that's actually
[1:12:43] more positive than you think it is. So
[1:12:45] don't say I'm going to skip tonight's
[1:12:46] service. That sounds really negative.
[1:12:48] But it's more positive than what you
[1:12:49] think because every one of us were
[1:12:50] sinners one
[1:12:53] day. Thank God for grace. So but I want
[1:12:57] to deal with like-minded believers,
[1:12:58] believers with whom we disagree and
[1:13:00] nominal Christians uh this morning. And
[1:13:03] and what I want to show you is Paul's
[1:13:05] actions towards these folks because he
[1:13:08] is the pattern for every ministry. I got
[1:13:10] that quote. I'll read it to you tonight
[1:13:12] and the actions of our messenger as well
[1:13:15] who followed that pattern. So we know
[1:13:16] that Paul, we know that Paul had a
[1:13:19] pattern to his ministry and we know that
[1:13:21] brother Brandon followed that pattern
[1:13:22] because beyond the curtain of time, they
[1:13:24] said you he said I preached what Paul
[1:13:26] preached and they said we're resting on
[1:13:28] that. So he taught the same thing. So
[1:13:31] like-minded believers, that's the very
[1:13:33] uh the easiest one that we can come to.
[1:13:34] In 1 Corinthians 1:10, he says, "I
[1:13:36] beseech you, brethren, by the name of
[1:13:37] our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[1:13:39] speak the same thing, that there be no
[1:13:41] divisions among you, be perfectly joined
[1:13:42] together in the same mind in the same
[1:13:45] judgment." And that that that's pretty
[1:13:47] easy if you all can achieve that because
[1:13:49] we flock together because we're nearly
[1:13:51] identical birds,
[1:13:54] right? And so we do flock together and
[1:13:56] it's easy to do that. But I want to warn
[1:13:58] you that this group doesn't even include
[1:14:00] everyone in your own church. Right.
[1:14:03] Right. You're not going to be
[1:14:04] like-minded always with any that's what
[1:14:06] we should strive for to have the same
[1:14:08] mind to have the same unity. But it's
[1:14:10] not always going to be everybody in the
[1:14:12] same church. Not everybody's going to
[1:14:13] think like us about music. Not
[1:14:14] everybody's going to think like us about
[1:14:16] h about how our kids uh how we be how we
[1:14:19] discipline our kids. Not everybody's
[1:14:21] going to think like us on different
[1:14:22] things. And and we have a word. We have
[1:14:24] a message we all agree on, right? Right?
[1:14:26] We believe that the the Bible is our
[1:14:28] standard. We believe the message of the
[1:14:30] hour is the light on that scripture that
[1:14:32] without it, we wouldn't know how to
[1:14:33] live. And yet at the same time, we have
[1:14:35] different diverging opinions of that.
[1:14:37] And that's okay. Yeah. That's okay. It's
[1:14:40] But it's wonderful when people can be in
[1:14:42] unity. Come on. Right. When people can
[1:14:44] come in unity, and I found that many
[1:14:46] times it's not that you don't have any
[1:14:48] differences, but it's that you put them
[1:14:49] aside and you say, "This morning we're
[1:14:51] going to have church, and this morning
[1:14:53] we're going to live for God. This
[1:14:54] morning we're going to see our loved
[1:14:56] ones saved this morning. And when you
[1:14:57] put them together for a common goal like
[1:14:59] they did on the day of Pentecost, they
[1:15:00] were different. They had differences,
[1:15:02] but they came in one mind, one accord.
[1:15:07] So the Bible tells us to not forsake the
[1:15:10] assembling of ourselves together as a
[1:15:13] manner of summas, but exhorting one
[1:15:15] another so much more as you see the day
[1:15:19] approaching. So he teaches us that we
[1:15:21] should exhort one another to meet
[1:15:23] together to assemble and that is
[1:15:26] literally the synagogue the church right
[1:15:29] assembling of ourselves what that word
[1:15:31] means it's the body of believers that
[1:15:33] assemble in the church as you see the
[1:15:35] day approaching and we find that Paul
[1:15:38] and brother Brandham both assembled
[1:15:39] themselves with local believers I know
[1:15:40] this is elementary but we're going
[1:15:42] somewhere this morning they assembled
[1:15:44] themselves with local believers in Acts
[1:15:47] 11:25 uh Barnabas then departed Barnabas
[1:15:50] to Tarsus for to seek Saul. When he
[1:15:52] found him, he brought him to
[1:15:54] Antioch. And it came to pass a whole
[1:15:56] year they assembled themselves with the
[1:15:58] church and taught much
[1:16:00] people. So Paul went to church even when
[1:16:03] he wasn't
[1:16:04] preaching, right? And the disciples were
[1:16:06] called Christians first in Antioch.
[1:16:09] That's when they begin to be noticed and
[1:16:11] when their light begin to shine, right?
[1:16:14] Come out under the from under the bushel
[1:16:15] basket. I know people think that
[1:16:17] assembling together is denominational,
[1:16:19] but it's actually anti-denominational
[1:16:22] and because when we assemble together,
[1:16:24] that's one way that our light shines.
[1:16:26] Now, Ephesians 2:6, he hath raised us up
[1:16:28] together, made us sit, someone say with
[1:16:30] me this morning, together. He made us
[1:16:33] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:16:35] Christ Jesus. Brand said, "Oh, what
[1:16:37] could happen tonight if we would be
[1:16:38] sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere
[1:16:40] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[1:16:42] heart that's been regenerated and become
[1:16:43] a new creature in Christ Jesus?" all
[1:16:46] sins under the blood in perfect worship
[1:16:48] with our hands up to God, our hearts
[1:16:49] lifted, sitting in heavenly places in
[1:16:52] Christ Jesus, worshiping together in
[1:16:53] heavenly. Isn't that wonderful when that
[1:16:55] happens? You can come together and
[1:16:57] worship God. And we want to encourage
[1:16:59] that. We want more of that. We don't put
[1:17:02] your differences aside and worship God.
[1:17:04] He's worthy of our praise. Even when we
[1:17:06] don't feel good, even when things aren't
[1:17:08] going right, he's worthy of our praise.
[1:17:13] Those times are wonderful. But you know,
[1:17:16] many times what happens is people get to
[1:17:18] weave in baskets.
[1:17:21] I I don't mean this offensive. If
[1:17:22] there's any basket weavers here, y'all
[1:17:24] just go ahead and do that. That's we're
[1:17:26] talking about
[1:17:27] spiritually. But we go to weaving
[1:17:30] baskets said, "Let's protect this the
[1:17:32] way we have church." Come on. Right. Our
[1:17:35] style of worship. And so we put
[1:17:38] traditions over it and denomination
[1:17:42] organiz organize it and the light goes
[1:17:45] out becomes ineffective to people.
[1:17:50] We are to continue to assemble in
[1:17:52] whatever way possible with other
[1:17:53] believers. Do we leave the earth by
[1:17:54] grave or rapture?
[1:17:56] That's a challenge to us. I know some of
[1:17:58] y'all don't, especially our older folks,
[1:17:59] you don't feel like coming to church,
[1:18:01] but we're called to do that. Now, there
[1:18:03] may be a times that you can't come, but
[1:18:04] we have streaming for that. And I'll say
[1:18:07] this sometimes I wish streaming didn't
[1:18:09] exist, but I'm grateful for it for those
[1:18:10] that can't come because it really does
[1:18:14] make a difference if you can't be in the
[1:18:16] house of God and you want to
[1:18:18] be because people that don't want to
[1:18:20] come to church probably won't watch the
[1:18:21] stream either.
[1:18:25] So people that you agree with pretty
[1:18:27] easy, right?
[1:18:30] Brother Brandon tells us you can't stay
[1:18:31] home and be just he said how can you
[1:18:32] stay home and be just as good a
[1:18:33] Christian as you would be at church?
[1:18:35] can't do it. That's pretty flat.
[1:18:38] But when brother Brandham, he says that
[1:18:40] twice in the message, and if you'll find
[1:18:42] where he goes back and ties it to, he
[1:18:44] does not just throwing that out there.
[1:18:46] He ties it back to Hebrews. Ties it back
[1:18:50] to assembling ourselves together. Uh and
[1:18:53] and much more as we see the day
[1:18:54] approaching. He ties it back to
[1:18:56] scripture because brother Brandon's not
[1:18:59] just saying that. He's saying this is
[1:19:01] what the Bible says. This was the light
[1:19:02] on the scripture.
[1:19:04] So the the second one is believers with
[1:19:06] whom we disagree. And we're going to
[1:19:07] spend more time on this
[1:19:09] one, but there will be good people in
[1:19:13] the church who you disagree with.
[1:19:19] I know y'all are angels, but for me,
[1:19:22] right? And some of it's
[1:19:23] misunderstanding. You just somebody come
[1:19:24] by and say something to you like, "Well,
[1:19:26] that's not right." You know, maybe you
[1:19:28] don't know where they're coming from.
[1:19:30] And so we give them the benefit of the
[1:19:31] doubt most of the time. and we just let
[1:19:34] it go. But there will be good people we
[1:19:36] disagree. There will be good people in
[1:19:37] other churches, including pastors whom
[1:19:40] we disagree with.
[1:19:43] And I'll teach something a certain way,
[1:19:44] maybe they teach something a little
[1:19:45] different. And and I had to get this
[1:19:48] revelation. And I think it'd do good for
[1:19:49] all of us to have this revelation. My
[1:19:51] grandpa always put it this way. He said,
[1:19:53] "We could all He said, "We could all be
[1:19:55] wrong, but we can't all be right.
[1:19:58] There's only one truth. But we could all
[1:20:01] be wrong because there's many errors.
[1:20:04] And I believe we have the truth. I
[1:20:05] believe we stand for the truth. But
[1:20:07] there I have enough about me to
[1:20:09] understand that I don't understand
[1:20:11] everything perfectly. And some things
[1:20:14] that I thought were wrong in the past,
[1:20:15] I've turned to it. So I you have to have
[1:20:18] the humility to to kind of do that. So
[1:20:22] many times uh we enter a conversation as
[1:20:25] if we were omnipotent.
[1:20:32] Right? But David said
[1:20:35] always we do we just walk in the
[1:20:37] situation say this belongs here and this
[1:20:39] this is what you do and this is what
[1:20:40] this is what God says. All right.
[1:20:45] Especially with other people's kids you
[1:20:47] know other churches. Well, this is what
[1:20:50] that pastor ought to do with his church.
[1:20:53] Ronald Reagan told that joke about,
[1:20:55] excuse me for joking, but it just comes
[1:20:57] to mind. Kind of fits. Ronald Reagan
[1:20:59] told that joke about being in uh the
[1:21:01] Russian man and the American man
[1:21:03] talking. The American man said, "We got
[1:21:04] freedom in our country." He said, "I can
[1:21:06] walk up to Ronald Reagan's desk." He
[1:21:07] said, "I can pound on the desk and say,
[1:21:09] Ronald Reagan, I don't like what way
[1:21:11] you're running your country." And the
[1:21:13] Russian man said, "Well, I can do that,
[1:21:15] too." He said, "I can walk in
[1:21:16] Gorbachov's office in the Kremlin. I can
[1:21:18] walk up, pound on the desk, and say, "I
[1:21:21] don't like the way Ronald Reagan's
[1:21:22] running his country."
[1:21:28] Is that the way we are so many times?
[1:21:32] We're not omnipotent.
[1:21:35] We're always looking at what other
[1:21:36] people are doing wrong. And then that's
[1:21:37] natural. That's human. But we got to
[1:21:39] examine ourselves sometimes and realize
[1:21:42] that, yeah, if I'm going to be able if
[1:21:44] I'm going to criticize, I got to be able
[1:21:45] to take criticism.
[1:21:47] And the way you're raising your family
[1:21:49] right now may not be the best way, but
[1:21:51] I'm glad for grace and mercy because if
[1:21:53] you're doing your best by the word,
[1:21:54] he'll he if you raise them up right, he
[1:21:56] he promised he would honor that. But but
[1:21:59] you may make mistakes. I've made many
[1:22:01] mistakes with my children. And things I
[1:22:03] wish I could do differently. But as we
[1:22:05] grow, we learn and and you got to learn
[1:22:07] some things. And it's just part of
[1:22:08] growing up. And you may do things
[1:22:10] differently. And I'm not just talking
[1:22:12] about children, but churches as well. We
[1:22:14] may do things. There's things I did five
[1:22:15] years ago I wouldn't do today, right?
[1:22:18] There's things we just wouldn't do that
[1:22:19] maybe we did back then. But it's just
[1:22:21] you learn how to do things, right?
[1:22:24] Hopefully, you get better and not worse.
[1:22:26] Hopefully, you grow. And how do we grow,
[1:22:28] though? We grow by being around people
[1:22:30] who are smarter than us,
[1:22:32] people who know more than us. And that's
[1:22:34] just about everybody for me.
[1:22:40] See, if we go into a conversation as if
[1:22:43] we're an omnipotent being, that there's
[1:22:45] no way for that to come out good.
[1:22:46] Because if they disagree with us,
[1:22:47] they're disagreeing with God.
[1:22:53] But I want to ask you this morning, what
[1:22:55] do you have to believe to be a believer?
[1:22:57] Come on.
[1:22:59] I want to challenge us on that. What do
[1:23:01] you have to believe to be a believer?
[1:23:04] I'm not going to answer it either.
[1:23:06] I want you to think about that.
[1:23:09] What do you have to believe to be a
[1:23:11] believer? I hate it when preachers ask
[1:23:12] questions they don't answer,
[1:23:15] but you realize maybe it's not what we
[1:23:17] think. Yeah. Right. You got to settle
[1:23:19] that in your own heart. What do you have
[1:23:21] to believe? Do you have to believe
[1:23:21] Brother Ram was a prophet? Do you have
[1:23:23] to believe in the opening of the word?
[1:23:25] Do you have to believe in Jesus? Does
[1:23:28] that make you a believer? Like what what
[1:23:29] is it that makes you a believer? Think
[1:23:32] about it. say, "Well, we can fellowship
[1:23:34] with believers, but what makes you a
[1:23:35] believer?"
[1:23:37] I'll say this. We're baptized into one
[1:23:39] body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:42] And brother Brandham says this about
[1:23:43] differences. He said, "God give them the
[1:23:45] Holy Ghost and give me the Holy Ghost."
[1:23:47] He said, he said he give the Holy Ghost
[1:23:48] to them that obey him. He said, "So they
[1:23:51] must have obeyed him to get the Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost." So we may have a difference, but
[1:23:54] they must have obeyed God. They wouldn't
[1:23:57] be sealed in that way in that manner. So
[1:23:59] what what do you have to believe again?
[1:24:01] What what would you have to what what
[1:24:03] would someone have to be to be a saint?
[1:24:09] Now, I want everybody to do something
[1:24:11] this morning. This wasn't planned at
[1:24:13] all, but I want you to think of
[1:24:15] somebody. Don't say it, but just think
[1:24:18] of somebody that you think of as a
[1:24:22] saint. A
[1:24:24] saint. I, you know, I don't mean a
[1:24:26] Catholic saint. I mean a real saint in
[1:24:28] the church.
[1:24:30] And I know some of you thought of
[1:24:33] brother Danny.
[1:24:36] A lot of us thought of Sister Fritz.
[1:24:39] Sister Vicki, some of these elders that
[1:24:41] are out here. I'm going to leave the
[1:24:42] wives out. I'm always promoting Brother
[1:24:44] Danny. He's my buddy. But some of you
[1:24:47] thought of different ones. Some of you
[1:24:48] thought of
[1:24:51] yourself. But you know what saint
[1:24:54] means? Sanctified one. How many here are
[1:24:58] sanctified? by the blood. You don't do
[1:25:01] that by your you your life has changed
[1:25:03] from what you were to what you are now.
[1:25:05] That's sanctification.
[1:25:07] Well, then you're a saint. Good.
[1:25:10] Right. That's right. And and so we can
[1:25:13] fellowship around that.
[1:25:15] Saints. Now the the Corinthian church
[1:25:18] when Paul comes to the Corinthian
[1:25:19] church, he had that church had
[1:25:20] immorality in it. Extreme immorality.
[1:25:23] Yeah.
[1:25:24] Divisions, different ideas about holy
[1:25:27] days and eating meat and the gifts so
[1:25:30] out of order unbelievers thought they
[1:25:31] were crazy.
[1:25:35] He said, "The unbeliever walks in and
[1:25:36] says, "You're mad."
[1:25:41] And so when Paul writes to him, you
[1:25:43] know, the first
[1:25:45] thing we might expect Paul to do is say,
[1:25:49] "I know not many of you believe,
[1:25:52] but maybe there's somebody there who's
[1:25:54] willing to listen." And Paul is very
[1:25:57] hard on the Corinthians. Very, very
[1:25:59] hard. Yes. Go read it. It's very
[1:26:01] difficult. He said, "Do you want me to
[1:26:02] show up?" He said, "I'd be even harder
[1:26:04] on you if I showed up instead of writing
[1:26:07] a letter."
[1:26:10] But look what he calls him. Paul called
[1:26:11] to be an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[1:26:14] will of God. And Sustines, our brethren,
[1:26:16] our brother unto the church of God,
[1:26:20] including those who had divisions.
[1:26:23] Yeah. Those who said, "I'm a Paul. I'm a
[1:26:24] Peter. of Christ. Y including those who
[1:26:29] including those who were And you say,
[1:26:31] "How do you know it includes those?"
[1:26:33] Because that's what he dealt with,
[1:26:35] even including the man who was
[1:26:38] committing immorality.
[1:26:40] But he had to be dealt with, right? But
[1:26:43] he was included in the church. That's
[1:26:45] the reason he had to be dealt with.
[1:26:47] Yeah. if he was part of the church which
[1:26:49] is at Corinth to them that are
[1:26:51] sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be
[1:26:55] saints with all that in every place call
[1:26:58] upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:27:00] both theirs and ours. Grace be unto you
[1:27:03] and peace from God our father from the
[1:27:04] Lord Jesus Christ. You say, "Well, maybe
[1:27:06] he changed his mind in his second letter
[1:27:07] when they didn't really some some of
[1:27:09] them didn't obey." Because he gets even
[1:27:11] harder in his second letter, although
[1:27:12] some things get changed. But in 2
[1:27:15] Corinthians 1:1, he says, "Paul, an
[1:27:17] apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of
[1:27:18] God, Timothy, our brother, he said, unto
[1:27:20] the church of God, which is at Corenth
[1:27:23] with all the saints which are in
[1:27:25] Akayiah, grace be to you and peace from
[1:27:27] God, our father, from the Lord Jesus
[1:27:29] Christ." If you listen to Paul, no
[1:27:30] matter what he's got to say to them, he
[1:27:33] really comes out hard on the Galatians
[1:27:35] early. But but no matter what he's got
[1:27:37] to say to them, he always greets them as
[1:27:38] church saints.
[1:27:41] And he always tells them, "You're called
[1:27:43] of God. You're elected. You're going to
[1:27:46] make it. Now, who has bewitched you?"
[1:27:51] All right. Go read the letters of Paul.
[1:27:53] He deals with them in a very blunt way.
[1:27:55] But they were believers. They were saint
[1:27:58] sanctified ones. And so Paul taught that
[1:28:00] there were different levels of faith.
[1:28:02] Romans 14:1, "Him that is weak in the
[1:28:03] faith receive you." But not to doubtful
[1:28:06] disputation. So in other words, if
[1:28:07] they're going to just argue, right? That
[1:28:10] you can't have that. You can't have just
[1:28:12] constant argument in the church. But if
[1:28:15] they'll sit there and listen, receive
[1:28:16] one that is weak. For one believeth that
[1:28:19] he may eat all things, another who is
[1:28:21] weak eateth herbs.
[1:28:23] So, one believes he can eat the but
[1:28:25] strong in faith believes he can eat
[1:28:27] bacon. I don't think we have any Amen.
[1:28:29] They said I don't think he I don't think
[1:28:31] we have any problem with that. I mean,
[1:28:33] most of us, just by looking around, I
[1:28:35] suspect we most of us eat
[1:28:37] bacon. But, but one believeth that he
[1:28:41] may eat all things. Another who is weak
[1:28:42] eateth herbs. He's weak, but he's a
[1:28:45] brother. Good. They're weak, but they're
[1:28:48] a sister. Amen. Let not him that eateth
[1:28:50] despise him that eateth not. Let not him
[1:28:53] which eateth not judge him that eateth.
[1:28:54] For God hath received him. Who art thou
[1:28:57] that judge another man's servant?
[1:29:01] In other words, if I had a servant, he
[1:29:03] was my butler, let's say, and he he kept
[1:29:06] the house and he set the table and he
[1:29:08] did all of that. Who are you to judge my
[1:29:11] servant?
[1:29:13] Right? You can judge your own servant,
[1:29:15] right? Tell him how to set the table.
[1:29:17] Tell him how to greet guests at the
[1:29:18] door. But you can't judge my servant
[1:29:21] because I'm the one that pays him. So he
[1:29:23] said, "Who art thou that judgeth another
[1:29:25] man's servant? To his own master? He
[1:29:28] standeth or fallth. Yay, he shall be
[1:29:30] holden up, for God is able to make him
[1:29:33] stand. One man esteemth one day above
[1:29:35] another, another esteemth every day
[1:29:36] alike. Let every man be fully persuaded
[1:29:39] in his own mind." Oh, Paul, you got to
[1:29:41] bring clarity to this. You got to you
[1:29:42] got to bring you realize even in the
[1:29:44] message there's some things brother
[1:29:45] Brandham doesn't bring complete clarity
[1:29:47] to and some things he waits for years to
[1:29:49] bring complete clarity to because he
[1:29:51] doesn't want to hurt people
[1:29:54] you say is he compromising no he's doing
[1:29:56] what God called ministers do he's
[1:29:58] following the pattern
[1:30:00] right and that's not to say we shouldn't
[1:30:02] stay with the word if there's a clear
[1:30:03] teaching of the word but sometimes
[1:30:04] people have to they got to grow out of
[1:30:06] what they are to what they will be
[1:30:09] none of us would want to be approached
[1:30:11] with the things we understand now when
[1:30:12] we first come in the message when we
[1:30:14] first were saved we we'd be blown away
[1:30:16] by it but we understand now more than we
[1:30:19] used to understand or hope that we do
[1:30:21] and why is that because because there's
[1:30:23] something in our heart that is matured
[1:30:25] and God called ministers work with us to
[1:30:28] help us to grow us into that maturity
[1:30:32] he said he that regardeth the day
[1:30:34] regardeth it to the Lord that regardeth
[1:30:36] not the day to the Lord he does not
[1:30:37] regard it he that eateth eateth to the
[1:30:39] Lord he giveth the Lord thanks he that
[1:30:40] eateth to the Lord, he eateth not and
[1:30:42] giveth God thanks. For none of us liveth
[1:30:45] to
[1:30:46] himself. No man dieth to himself.
[1:30:49] Whether we live, we live to the Lord.
[1:30:51] Whether we die, we die to the Lord.
[1:30:53] Whether we live, therefore, or die, we
[1:30:54] are the
[1:30:55] Lord's. And and and again, uh verse 10,
[1:30:59] keep down to verse 10. But why dust thou
[1:31:00] judge thy brother? Why dust thou said it
[1:31:03] not thy brother? In other words, say
[1:31:04] he's nothing because he don't have the
[1:31:05] faith I do.
[1:31:07] For we shall all stand before the
[1:31:09] judgment seat of Christ. Every one of us
[1:31:11] is going to answer either here or at the
[1:31:13] white throne
[1:31:15] judgment. Right? All of us have to stand
[1:31:17] before the judgment seat of Christ. For
[1:31:18] as written, as I live, sayith the Lord,
[1:31:19] every knee shall bow to me and every
[1:31:20] tongue shall confess to
[1:31:21] God. So then every one of us shall give
[1:31:23] account of himself to God. Let us not
[1:31:26] therefore judge one another anymore.
[1:31:29] But judge this rather, that no man put a
[1:31:32] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[1:31:36] in his brother's way.
[1:31:39] So we're not to entrap people. Yeah. Put
[1:31:43] something out there that's difficult for
[1:31:44] them to understand. Wait for them to
[1:31:47] trip over it and laugh at them when they
[1:31:49] do. Come on. Right. That's not what
[1:31:52] we're supposed to do. That's right. He
[1:31:54] said, "I know and am persuaded by the
[1:31:55] Lord Jesus, there's nothing unclean of
[1:31:57] itself. But to him that esteemth
[1:31:58] anything to be unclean, him it is
[1:32:00] unclean. But if thy brother be grieved
[1:32:02] with thy meat, now walkst thou not
[1:32:03] charitably, destroy." This is a powerful
[1:32:06] scripture. Destroy not him with thy meat
[1:32:09] for whom Christ died. Now when he says
[1:32:12] not to doubtful disputations, if
[1:32:13] somebody comes in tries to make
[1:32:14] everybody else do that, you got to deal
[1:32:17] with that. Yeah. But if somebody's
[1:32:18] willing to just sit themselves and say,
[1:32:20] "Well, this is what I believe. This is
[1:32:21] my revelation." Let them sit there good,
[1:32:24] right? Don't destroy with your with your
[1:32:27] meat what God what God whom Christ died.
[1:32:30] Let not then your good be evil spoken
[1:32:32] of. For the kingdom of God is not meat
[1:32:34] and drink, but righteousness and peace
[1:32:35] and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that
[1:32:38] in these things serveth Christ is
[1:32:39] acceptable to God and approved to men.
[1:32:40] Let us therefore follow after the things
[1:32:43] which make for peace and things
[1:32:46] wherewith one may edify another. Good. I
[1:32:49] want to ask you, I want to challenge
[1:32:50] this this morning and not just to us,
[1:32:53] but but especially to us. Was Paul a
[1:32:55] compromiser? Was he a panderer? Did he
[1:32:58] go up to the council of Jerusalem just
[1:33:00] to be seen or he identified with a
[1:33:01] group? He didn't agree with them. Right.
[1:33:04] In fact, he disagreed vehemently. Had
[1:33:06] heated arguments with with Peter,
[1:33:08] Barnabas, and Mark, and James,
[1:33:11] right? Heated arguments with them. And
[1:33:12] they were all Holy Ghost fil men. Yes.
[1:33:16] But he never put a basket over his light
[1:33:19] by dysfellowshipping with him.
[1:33:22] Brother Brandham tells us, "If you can't
[1:33:23] disagree with a man and things, then
[1:33:24] shake his hand, still have the same
[1:33:26] feelings towards him, there's something
[1:33:28] wrong with you." If I can't disagree
[1:33:30] with a man bitterly from one side to the
[1:33:32] other. So, it's not wrong to disagree.
[1:33:34] Some things need to be challenged
[1:33:37] and still think as much of him as Christ
[1:33:39] would, then there's something wrong with
[1:33:40] my spirit. I have the spirit of Christ.
[1:33:42] So, I have to be able to think that way.
[1:33:45] Listen, you young people, you say,
[1:33:46] "Well, there's nothing in this for me."
[1:33:47] Yeah, there is. When you disagree with
[1:33:48] your
[1:33:49] parents, do you still love them? You
[1:33:51] still have the spirit of Christ about
[1:33:52] it,
[1:33:54] right? Or do you say, "Well, I can't
[1:33:55] wait till I'm 18." You know, tell you,
[1:33:58] ask Peter, "How much changes when you
[1:33:59] turn 18?" You know,
[1:34:03] not much if you don't have much money.
[1:34:12] I'm proud of my son. Now
[1:34:15] look, Brother Brandon proved I know I'm
[1:34:18] taking it slow. I have to no other way
[1:34:20] to do it, but my iPad's about to run out
[1:34:22] of battery, so we'll have to close. So,
[1:34:24] that's
[1:34:25] good. Brother Brandon proved how he
[1:34:28] dealt with he proved uh that he believed
[1:34:31] this and that it was how he dealt with
[1:34:33] the churches in his area. There's five
[1:34:35] churches that I know of that I found in
[1:34:38] the immediate area that Brother Brandham
[1:34:39] called sister churches. Some of y'all
[1:34:40] may know of more. If you do, tell me
[1:34:42] later.
[1:34:44] But one was Brother Graham Snelling.
[1:34:47] You've heard that name on the tapes
[1:34:48] probably. Brother Graham Snelling.
[1:34:50] Brother uh Brother Graham was the
[1:34:53] associate pastor at the tabernacle until
[1:34:56] 1950. And he was uh had to leave. uh
[1:35:00] there was some things in his life and
[1:35:02] that he had to
[1:35:03] leave and him and brother Brandham
[1:35:05] didn't agree on deacons and things like
[1:35:07] that so he had to leave and brother
[1:35:09] Brandham did not let that hinder their
[1:35:11] fellowship in fact brother Graham
[1:35:12] Stelling started a church right down the
[1:35:15] road a few miles away brother Graham he
[1:35:18] said met me today and said now brother
[1:35:20] Bill I'm sure that you understand I'm
[1:35:21] not here to start up another work in
[1:35:22] opposition to the tabernacle because I'm
[1:35:24] part of the tabernacle he feels upon his
[1:35:26] heart that he wants to hold a revival
[1:35:28] and the Lord holding leading him to do
[1:35:29] and he invites the converts and he has a
[1:35:31] church to pour them right down. Here's a
[1:35:33] church home. If you get in, get
[1:35:34] converted. And it's our duty as
[1:35:38] Christians to back him with everything
[1:35:40] we can.
[1:35:42] Where do we reach the place that just
[1:35:43] because they weren't our church don't
[1:35:44] mean if they can be a help? Yeah. Not
[1:35:47] everybody does things the way we do
[1:35:49] them, but if they can be a help, I wish
[1:35:50] there were churches in every community
[1:35:52] that that promoted the light of the
[1:35:53] message of the hour. If they can be a
[1:35:55] help, let them be a
[1:35:57] help. Right now, it's our duty as
[1:36:00] Christians to back him up with
[1:36:01] everything we can. And the Lord blessed
[1:36:02] Brother Graham. And you're everyone
[1:36:03] cordially invited to Brother Graham's
[1:36:05] meeting up here with full permission
[1:36:06] from this church with the full
[1:36:08] cooperation to help him in any way we
[1:36:10] can for lost souls and for the kingdom
[1:36:12] of God. Brother Brandham wasn't building
[1:36:13] a kingdom, right? He was building the
[1:36:15] kingdom of God, right? He said, "Lord,
[1:36:17] bless you, brother Graham. Give you
[1:36:18] great meetings. He don't know when he's
[1:36:19] going to close. He's just starting." So,
[1:36:21] Brother Graham has had it like myself,
[1:36:22] many ups and downs. That's the way life
[1:36:24] runs. He said, "It makes you appreciate
[1:36:25] the upset. He went through the downs. He
[1:36:27] said, "If a man makes a drop and lays
[1:36:29] there, he's a coward." Come on, church.
[1:36:31] Why would we want a man to continue to
[1:36:33] lay down? Come on. If he falls, why
[1:36:35] would we want him to continue? What kind
[1:36:36] of a spirit would be in us would want a
[1:36:38] man to continue to wallow in his sin?
[1:36:41] Yes.
[1:36:42] We want him to come out of that. Or a
[1:36:44] woman, we want him to come out of that.
[1:36:46] We don't want to sit there and every
[1:36:47] time they every time they get up, knock
[1:36:49] them back down again. We want to see
[1:36:51] them come out and be helped. Come on.
[1:36:54] Cuz somebody helped me. Somebody saw
[1:36:56] something in me. Let's see something in
[1:36:57] our brothers and sisters. Yes.
[1:37:01] Brother Junior Jackson had a
[1:37:02] disagreement with brother Brandham over
[1:37:03] church order. This is relevant right now
[1:37:06] in the message. Never thought it would
[1:37:08] be at this late stage, but it is.
[1:37:11] And brother Junior Jackson, he he talks
[1:37:14] about church order. He said he had a
[1:37:15] right to disagree with that. He wants
[1:37:17] his church that people all want to speak
[1:37:19] with tongues and things in the audience.
[1:37:20] That's brother Junior's troubles. That's
[1:37:21] up to him.
[1:37:26] He said, "But Junior Jackson believes
[1:37:28] this message the same as any of the rest
[1:37:29] of us does."
[1:37:32] He's one of us and it's not a dead bird
[1:37:34] to go there. Junior Jackson is a man of
[1:37:36] God that I love with all my heart and
[1:37:37] it's not here tonight so I can really
[1:37:38] pour it on the way I want to. He said in
[1:37:41] Don Rutle, I don't think Don's here
[1:37:42] tonight because they got a church of
[1:37:43] their own. But if I seen every person
[1:37:45] come to this tabernacle walk out and go
[1:37:46] to Don Rutles or Brother JT Parnell's or
[1:37:48] these brothers here, this our brothers
[1:37:50] here and fellow citizens of the kingdom,
[1:37:51] I'd be so happy. I wouldn't know what to
[1:37:53] do. I'd say, "Lord, fill this one back
[1:37:56] up again. Let's pour it out and fill up
[1:37:57] another one. I'd love it. I'd love to
[1:37:59] see those boys." Said, "They're my
[1:38:00] children." He said, "Now, JT, ready, the
[1:38:02] rest of them don't have to believe just
[1:38:03] like I do. They don't have to do that.
[1:38:04] As I told you this morning, I don't even
[1:38:06] agree with my wife." Somebody said,
[1:38:08] "Amen." She don't agree with me. What if
[1:38:11] I went to the table and Junior got apple
[1:38:13] pie and I got cherry pie? Brother, we're
[1:38:15] both eating pie. We'll agree that. He
[1:38:17] said, "We both preach the same gospel."
[1:38:19] He said his church discipline. And he
[1:38:20] said, you know, Peter and Paul had
[1:38:21] differences, not in their doctrines, but
[1:38:22] the way Peter was behaving himself. And
[1:38:25] listen, Peter was wrong.
[1:38:27] But he wasn't not a brother. There's a
[1:38:29] difference. We can point out a wrong,
[1:38:32] but but that's still a brother. It's
[1:38:34] when you It's when you put the bushel
[1:38:36] basket over.
[1:38:39] Come on, church. And you begin to say,
[1:38:41] "Well, they're we're different than we
[1:38:43] are on how they let the gifts operate.
[1:38:45] So, we're going to build our bushel
[1:38:46] basket and put it over our light." Very
[1:38:49] good. How could we ever help somebody?
[1:38:52] And I've got enough confidence in you as
[1:38:54] a church that I believe you you are
[1:38:56] going to be a help to somebody. I
[1:38:58] believe we've grown from milk to the
[1:38:59] meat of the word. I believe we can help
[1:39:01] people by fellowshipping with people. I
[1:39:03] don't believe we're we're noviceses
[1:39:05] anymore. Most of us are not noviceses.
[1:39:06] We we know some things. We've been
[1:39:08] around for a while. Let's try to love
[1:39:10] people and help people and be a light to
[1:39:11] people. Yes. Good.
[1:39:15] Brother Don Ruddle was the third one.
[1:39:18] And brother Brandham was preaching at
[1:39:20] Graham Snelling's church. Brand preached
[1:39:22] for them and and dedicated some of their
[1:39:25] churches. Can you imagine a new church
[1:39:28] starting in this area? Don't do
[1:39:31] it. Can you imagine, brother Stewart, a
[1:39:33] new church in starting up in our area
[1:39:36] and me going and preaching the
[1:39:37] dedication?
[1:39:41] Brother Brand looks at things
[1:39:42] differently than we do.
[1:39:47] So, they were all I hope I'm not boring
[1:39:49] you this morning. I I felt like I needed
[1:39:51] to preach this and I'm just kind of
[1:39:53] fighting through some things. So, y'all
[1:39:55] thank you for your
[1:39:57] prayers. Brother Brandon was at uh Don
[1:39:59] Graham Stanley's church singing Room at
[1:40:01] the Fountain, old song. He said, "I
[1:40:03] remember when we used to sing it, get
[1:40:04] down at the altar on our knees and sing
[1:40:06] it down at the tabernacle years ago." He
[1:40:09] said, "You know this kind?" He said,
[1:40:10] "Y'all still got that free religion
[1:40:11] here."
[1:40:14] You know what? This going to shock you.
[1:40:15] There were things about Brother
[1:40:16] Brandham's own church he disagreed with.
[1:40:19] True.
[1:40:21] He didn't kill people over it. He didn't
[1:40:23] run them out.
[1:40:25] There were things about his own church
[1:40:26] he'd rather have different,
[1:40:28] right? But we're human beings, we're
[1:40:31] trying to make it. So he said, you used
[1:40:34] to have, you still got that, oh, I want
[1:40:35] that free religion here. I want it to
[1:40:37] always be here. He said like we used to
[1:40:38] have down at the tabernacle. You can
[1:40:40] still clap your hands and praise the
[1:40:41] Lord and have a good time. So, they tell
[1:40:43] me, "Brother Ruddle here has got that
[1:40:44] kind of tabernacle out on the highway.
[1:40:46] I'll slip out and hear him one of these
[1:40:48] nights. He had an awful time getting him
[1:40:50] pushed out, but he's finally burning
[1:40:51] them up out there now. God bless you,
[1:40:53] Brother Rutle." Brother JT
[1:40:55] Parnell, Brother JT Parnell, and I I
[1:40:58] want to say this, none of these men
[1:41:00] fully embraced the message.
[1:41:02] None of them did, right? Some of one
[1:41:05] church became uh full
[1:41:07] gospel. Most of the other churches are
[1:41:09] are gone. There's one church that's in
[1:41:11] real extreme doctrinal uh differences
[1:41:14] and things, but brother Brandham treated
[1:41:16] them. So, it wasn't like, well, I just I
[1:41:18] know what they're going to be, so I'm
[1:41:19] going to be patient with them. No, he
[1:41:20] was treating them right because it was
[1:41:21] the right thing to do.
[1:41:24] Right. So, he he said about brother JT
[1:41:27] Parnell, who's another pastor, another
[1:41:28] church, he said, "Don't forget these
[1:41:30] little churches." He's encouraging
[1:41:31] people to come to church on Wednesday
[1:41:33] night at the Brandom Tabernacle. He
[1:41:35] said, "But don't forget these little
[1:41:36] churches like Brother Ruddle, Brother
[1:41:37] Jackson, Brother Parnell, all those
[1:41:38] little brethren who are struggling hard
[1:41:40] out there." See, he said, "They feel
[1:41:41] like that we are their sister church
[1:41:42] here. See, we kind of like a little
[1:41:44] mother group to them. That's where they
[1:41:45] were born out of here, pastors and so
[1:41:47] forth." Brother Ed Hooper was another
[1:41:49] brother. And he said, "I seen brother
[1:41:51] Junior Jackson standing there. I seen
[1:41:52] brother Ruddle." He said, "Then brother,
[1:41:54] that's our sister church that's led out
[1:41:55] and the others. We certainly appreciate
[1:41:57] it. I see Brother Hooper standing up
[1:41:59] along the wall there from Udica, the
[1:42:00] church there. We certainly appreciate
[1:42:02] y'all's fine cooperation in this. Yes.
[1:42:05] Five different churches plus the
[1:42:06] tabernacle. So, there's six churches in
[1:42:08] the area. All disagreed on things, but
[1:42:12] they were willing to fellowship. So,
[1:42:14] Brother Brandham fellowshipped.
[1:42:16] Huh? Now, if they're not willing,
[1:42:18] there's nothing you can do about that.
[1:42:20] But if they are willing, you try to
[1:42:22] fellowship.
[1:42:24] And without fellowship, what do we
[1:42:25] become? And I want to challenge us. I
[1:42:27] want to challenge us a little bit
[1:42:28] tonight on even with sinners. Like we've
[1:42:30] got to touch shoulders with the world,
[1:42:33] rub shoulders with the world because if
[1:42:34] we don't, we can't be a light to them,
[1:42:38] right? We want to be public as public as
[1:42:40] we can be because we don't know who the
[1:42:43] last one is. We want to be a light. We
[1:42:46] want to be a city on a hill. We want to
[1:42:47] be a a candle that hasn't had a bushel
[1:42:49] denominational bushel basket set over
[1:42:51] it.
[1:42:54] So even with nominal Christians, that
[1:42:55] would be the third one. But without
[1:42:57] fellowship with believers you disagree
[1:42:58] with. Now they are believers. There is a
[1:43:00] difference in a believer in a
[1:43:02] denominational church.
[1:43:05] Right? We don't promote meetings in
[1:43:06] denominational churches. Now, if you had
[1:43:08] a family member, a friend that you
[1:43:10] wanted to go to one, that'd be up to
[1:43:11] you. That'd be fine. I I just make sure
[1:43:13] you don't take in that teaching. But but
[1:43:16] that'd be fine, right? You could you
[1:43:18] could fellowship as long as you knew you
[1:43:19] could help them. But but we don't
[1:43:20] promote fellowship with denominational
[1:43:22] because that denomination will come and
[1:43:23] try to take away from you what you have.
[1:43:26] But we do promote fellowship with fellow
[1:43:28] believers we disagree with. Right? Are
[1:43:31] you with me now? If not, you become a
[1:43:33] basket case.
[1:43:36] Right? And you just sit there and
[1:43:37] there's nothing going on. And you
[1:43:39] wonder, we never baptize anybody. Well,
[1:43:40] maybe because you don't ever want to
[1:43:42] baptize anybody. Nobody's good enough.
[1:43:45] Yeah. Nobody knew ever comes to church.
[1:43:47] Well, maybe because nobody's ever good
[1:43:48] enough to come to church. You don't so
[1:43:50] you you don't think they're bride
[1:43:51] material. I I I got to where I almost
[1:43:53] hated that phrase. I know brother
[1:43:55] Brandham says bride material, but the
[1:43:57] bride material, listen to me. The woman
[1:43:59] at the well was bride material.
[1:44:02] And and the and the a and the uh the men
[1:44:05] there, the Pharisees, the priests, the
[1:44:06] priests who didn't do one thing wrong in
[1:44:08] their whole life, they were not bride
[1:44:10] material. They had no representation in
[1:44:12] heaven. You can't look at somebody and
[1:44:14] say, "Well, that's not bride material."
[1:44:16] You don't know who the bride's going to
[1:44:17] be.
[1:44:23] There may be bride in the prisons.
[1:44:28] Locked up for life, never able to come
[1:44:31] to church, but they're elected by God.
[1:44:33] And somehow word will get through to
[1:44:34] them.
[1:44:38] That's the truth of
[1:44:41] it. Paul preached in the synagogue every
[1:44:45] chance he got. That was the closest
[1:44:47] thing that we have to nominal Christians
[1:44:48] today would have been the Jewish
[1:44:50] synagogue. Now anywhere Paul preached,
[1:44:52] they kicked him out. Why? He preached
[1:44:53] the word. He preached Christ. So every
[1:44:56] city he goes in, he preaches the
[1:44:57] synagogue for a while and then they kick
[1:44:58] him out. Goes to another city, preaches
[1:45:00] the synagogue for a while, kick him out.
[1:45:02] The same thing happened to brother
[1:45:03] Brandham as he get farther along in his
[1:45:04] ministry. The doors closed because of
[1:45:07] what he was preaching. So I don't
[1:45:09] believe that a man of God could stand in
[1:45:10] the Baptist pulpit for year after year
[1:45:12] after year and preach and not get kicked
[1:45:13] out. Right? that it's going to happen
[1:45:16] unless they all come to the message
[1:45:19] right in that church and then things
[1:45:20] would be different. But brother Brandham
[1:45:22] always makes a great effort to
[1:45:23] distinguish the people from the system.
[1:45:26] And he took a question and I'm not going
[1:45:28] to read this because I don't have time.
[1:45:29] I'm running out of time. So I'm going to
[1:45:31] skip several paragraphs here. Brother
[1:45:33] Robert and I
[1:45:34] apologize. But brother Brandham talks to
[1:45:37] a Methodist uh couple. Her husband is
[1:45:39] Methodist and she's a believer and she
[1:45:42] said, "Should I go with him?" And he
[1:45:43] tells her, he says, 'Go with him when
[1:45:45] we're not having church, right? When
[1:45:47] we're not having church, he said, ' It's
[1:45:49] okay for you to go with him. He said,
[1:45:50] 'But because he was letting her come to
[1:45:53] church, so keep coming to church, right?
[1:45:54] You need church, but he said, if you if
[1:45:57] you want to go with him when he's not,
[1:45:58] he said, that's fine. He said, but he
[1:46:00] said, if I be lifted up, he said, I'll
[1:46:02] draw all men to me. This is the last
[1:46:04] quote in that questions and answers. I'd
[1:46:07] go, but be real careful. Don't join
[1:46:09] their church, though. So, see the
[1:46:11] difference in that? If it's somebody we
[1:46:13] maybe disagree a little bit with, but
[1:46:14] they're in the message, right? And I'm
[1:46:17] not talking there's some things you
[1:46:18] can't support, like some immorality and
[1:46:19] things you got to, right? You you got to
[1:46:22] you got to walk away from that until it
[1:46:24] gets fixed. But watch for
[1:46:26] reconciliation. But there's some things
[1:46:28] that that you can you can swallow your
[1:46:30] pride. And because they have longer
[1:46:32] services than us, which almost everybody
[1:46:34] does, believe it or not,
[1:46:37] doesn't mean they're not Christians.
[1:46:41] And because their music's different from
[1:46:42] ours don't mean they're not Christians.
[1:46:44] Right? They're just not as revelated as
[1:46:46] us yet. Praise God.
[1:46:49] Right? Are you with me now? But when it
[1:46:53] comes to denominational churches, you
[1:46:54] have to be careful, right? Because of
[1:46:56] that system. But you still want to be a
[1:46:58] light to the people, right? Don't join
[1:47:00] their church. So if there's any church
[1:47:03] of message persuasion, I'd go to it. But
[1:47:05] we're not all the same.
[1:47:07] Listen, as long as we can work with
[1:47:09] somebody and not be swallowed up in the
[1:47:11] system, we'll do that. Do the very best
[1:47:13] we can to work with them. There's people
[1:47:14] who do good work for uh for homeless
[1:47:16] people and things like that. We we don't
[1:47:18] have the ability to do that. I would
[1:47:20] gladly send somebody to work with
[1:47:21] somebody like that if they have the
[1:47:22] chance and opportunity. There've been
[1:47:24] people helped even uh connected to us by
[1:47:26] churches, nominal churches who had a
[1:47:28] good program for alcoholics and drug
[1:47:30] addicts and things like that. We don't
[1:47:32] have that. You know, God bless him for
[1:47:34] helping people,
[1:47:36] right? But that's not our our job.
[1:47:38] Brother Brandon said, I was listening to
[1:47:39] it yesterday, he said to Merlin Anon
[1:47:42] when he was uh when he ordained him, he
[1:47:44] was a Salvation Army preacher. He said,
[1:47:45] "Now, the Salvation Army has their work,
[1:47:47] a great work that they do." He said,
[1:47:48] "But we we love what they do." He said,
[1:47:50] "But we've been called to deliver a
[1:47:52] message." He said, "So, you want to come
[1:47:54] and do that with us, right? We got a
[1:47:56] message to preach." And that's not our
[1:47:58] our our our main goal. We can help
[1:48:00] people at times, but it's not our main
[1:48:02] goal to help people financially and
[1:48:04] things like that. Yet, whenever we have
[1:48:05] an opportunity, we will. But there's
[1:48:07] people who do a wonderful work, and I
[1:48:08] support them in
[1:48:10] that. But, Brother Billy Paul said
[1:48:14] something, and I believe it because of
[1:48:16] what I've what I hear every time I turn
[1:48:18] on a
[1:48:19] tape. Brother Billy Paul in his
[1:48:21] testimony, he said, "The greatest
[1:48:22] miracle he ever saw was that Brother
[1:48:23] Brandham treated his enemies no
[1:48:26] different from his friends. That's
[1:48:28] right. You couldn't tell which ones were
[1:48:29] which.
[1:48:31] Good.
[1:48:33] And again, you say, "Well, that's just
[1:48:34] Brother Billy's testimony." But that's
[1:48:36] what you hear on the tapes. Right. Look
[1:48:39] at Jack Moore. Jack Moore never did come
[1:48:42] in the message. And brother Brandham
[1:48:45] talks him up, preaching that he was
[1:48:46] willing to fellowship. See, there was a
[1:48:49] willingness there. It wasn't a He wasn't
[1:48:51] trying to Jeff Moore wasn't trying to
[1:48:52] get Brother Brandham in to to deceive
[1:48:54] the people. He was he was getting
[1:48:55] brother Brandon in because he was his
[1:48:56] friend. But he never understood the
[1:48:57] message. Deus Shakarian never understood
[1:49:00] the message and supported and I showed
[1:49:03] you that one time. Deus Shakarian is
[1:49:04] responsible for Joel Ostein.
[1:49:07] He financed his father, got him out of
[1:49:09] bankruptcy and also financed brother
[1:49:12] Brandham around the world, right? So you
[1:49:14] see those two vines coming up together,
[1:49:16] but it's just it's it's still brother
[1:49:18] Brandham used that he was willing to to
[1:49:21] be friends with those men. Gordon
[1:49:23] Lindsay calls brother Brandham no end of
[1:49:24] trouble. One of the last sermons that
[1:49:26] brother Brandon preaches, he welcomes
[1:49:27] Brother Gordon and stands in a prayer
[1:49:29] line with him. Yeah. Has him come up and
[1:49:31] pray with him. Yeah. In the prayer line.
[1:49:33] And he caused him he caused him
[1:49:35] financial trouble and everything else
[1:49:37] and was actively working against him.
[1:49:40] Yet, brother Brandham did that. See, so
[1:49:42] we so I believe it when he says we don't
[1:49:45] know his friends from his enemies
[1:49:46] because listen to the tapes, you
[1:49:47] wouldn't know, right?
[1:49:49] And if you look, I know everybody uses
[1:49:51] Moab as an example, but it wasn't Israel
[1:49:54] who refused fellowship. Go back and
[1:49:56] listen to the story. Read the story of
[1:49:58] Moab. It was Moab that refused
[1:50:00] fellowship. They wouldn't allow passage,
[1:50:02] right?
[1:50:04] Until until Balam taught them to come in
[1:50:06] with flatteries and intermar. See,
[1:50:07] that's what we can't do. But Moab was
[1:50:09] always the type of denomination, right?
[1:50:12] Organization was never the type of other
[1:50:14] believers. Yeah. Right.
[1:50:17] But see, if we're not careful, we form a
[1:50:18] denomination
[1:50:20] by by by taking these things and well,
[1:50:23] we're got to be so careful. We got to be
[1:50:25] so careful. Well, I'll tell you this. If
[1:50:26] we make it, it's going to be because of
[1:50:28] God. It's not going to be because of my
[1:50:30] efforts. Come on. Come on, church. I I
[1:50:33] want to make an effort. I want to live
[1:50:34] for the Lord because I love him. Because
[1:50:37] that's that's my desire. It's my only
[1:50:39] desire. My only desire in my heart. Can
[1:50:41] I be honest with you? My only desire
[1:50:42] ever was to preach to a congregation
[1:50:44] like this, a lovely group of people. and
[1:50:46] and preach to you and come up on Sundays
[1:50:48] and care for your your needs and things
[1:50:49] like that. That's the only desire I've
[1:50:51] ever had. I've had that desire since I
[1:50:53] was probably 10 years old. I've always
[1:50:55] wanted to do that and I want to do that
[1:50:57] with all my heart. I don't I don't want
[1:50:58] to be laxed in doing that. But but I
[1:51:01] can't make you a Christian. I I can't do
[1:51:03] that. I I can't I can't force you into
[1:51:05] the kingdom. I do that because I love
[1:51:07] God. All of my work doesn't mean one
[1:51:09] thing when it comes to the end. When it
[1:51:11] comes time, my rewards are based on my
[1:51:13] work, but my salvation is not based on
[1:51:15] works. Not one bit of it. Yeah.
[1:51:21] It's based on the blood of Jesus. Aren't
[1:51:22] you glad for that? Say, "Well, we're
[1:51:25] afraid we're going to be
[1:51:26] deceived." Well, the bride can't be. So,
[1:51:33] right. Pattern Paul left is one of
[1:51:35] self-sacrifice for the cause of the
[1:51:36] gospel. You can read Philippians 1 15-18
[1:51:40] later. 1 Corinthians
[1:51:44] 9:20. He says this. He said, "Unto the
[1:51:47] Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain
[1:51:50] the Jews. To them that are under the
[1:51:51] laws, under the law, that I might gain
[1:51:52] them that are under the law. Them that
[1:51:54] are without laws, without law, being not
[1:51:56] without law to God, but under the law to
[1:51:58] Christ that I might gain them that are
[1:51:59] without law. weak I became as weak that
[1:52:02] I might gain the weak. I made all things
[1:52:04] to all men that I might by all means
[1:52:06] save some. This I do for the gospel sake
[1:52:09] that I might be a partaker thereof with
[1:52:10] you. Listen, he wasn't compromising. He
[1:52:13] wasn't pandering.
[1:52:16] He walks into a a Pharisee a chamber of
[1:52:21] Pharisees and Sadducees and he tells the
[1:52:22] s Pharisees he said it's because I
[1:52:25] believe like you that have been brought
[1:52:27] in here under question because of the
[1:52:29] resurrection of the dead. You know what?
[1:52:31] He got them to fight on his side.
[1:52:36] But he wasn't being a hypocrite. He was
[1:52:38] following. He was setting the pattern.
[1:52:39] Brother Brandham wasn't being a
[1:52:40] hypocrite when he would speak highly of
[1:52:43] men in their pulpits and then go blast
[1:52:45] their denominations
[1:52:47] sometimes in the same service.
[1:52:50] He wasn't being a hypocrite. Go listen
[1:52:52] to birth pains. I believe it's birth
[1:52:53] pains where brother Brandham he he
[1:52:55] stands up to preach and there's a a
[1:52:57] Catholic priest gets up because brother
[1:52:58] Brandham was preaching with a Catholic
[1:53:00] priest on the platform. You talk about
[1:53:02] identifying yourself with something.
[1:53:03] Come on.
[1:53:05] He's preaching with a Catholic priest on
[1:53:06] the platform and the Catholic priest
[1:53:08] gets up and and says and led by the Lord
[1:53:12] to say what he said. He said, "Don't be
[1:53:13] nervous, son." He said, "There'll be
[1:53:15] something that'll happen." And and
[1:53:17] remember the pages were stuck together
[1:53:18] and it was this day this scripture is
[1:53:19] fulfilled
[1:53:21] that that that happened. Brother Brandon
[1:53:23] ties that back to when Jesus stood up
[1:53:24] there and the priest handed him the
[1:53:26] book. He handed him his the Catholic
[1:53:28] priest handed him his Bible. Probably
[1:53:30] wasn't even King
[1:53:36] James. Now listen, but he in that sermon
[1:53:40] he blessed denominational systems. Go
[1:53:43] listen to it. Bless
[1:53:45] them. So he wasn't being a hypocrite or
[1:53:47] a pander. He was following the pattern.
[1:53:50] Paul wasn't compromising when he spoke
[1:53:52] to the philosophers on Mars Hill. You
[1:53:54] realize when Paul spoke on Mars Hill, he
[1:53:56] never directly quotes the scripture. He
[1:53:59] doesn't walk out there with a B with an
[1:54:00] Old Testament and say, "Now, in Isaiah,
[1:54:02] now he did that to the Jews, but he
[1:54:04] never does that on Mars Hill." He walks
[1:54:07] out and talks in general terms. He said,
[1:54:09] "I see a tomb to an unknown god. Let me
[1:54:12] talk about him."
[1:54:14] What a remarkable sermon. Yes, sir. We
[1:54:16] had to do some of that in Egypt. We
[1:54:17] realized these people didn't know
[1:54:18] anything. So you kind of had to back up
[1:54:20] and introduce Christ to them and
[1:54:22] introduce the word and then introduce
[1:54:24] brother Brandham later, you know, and
[1:54:25] and and so you had to kind of take it in
[1:54:28] steps because they just weren't getting
[1:54:29] it. You can't go over there and just
[1:54:30] preach the son of man and then accept it
[1:54:33] because they haven't they don't even
[1:54:34] understand who a prophet is. They don't
[1:54:35] understand who Jesus is really why they
[1:54:37] need to be baptized and things like
[1:54:39] that. And and so Paul does that. He
[1:54:41] stands up there. He quotes two Greek
[1:54:44] poets in the scripture. Go look it up.
[1:54:49] Two Greek poets in that sermon never
[1:54:51] quotes the
[1:54:53] scripture. Just an oblique reference and
[1:54:56] most of them mocked him. But if you go
[1:54:58] to the end of that scripture, it says a
[1:54:59] few believed.
[1:55:01] What was he being? A light in the house.
[1:55:03] Yeah. A candle with no bushel basket
[1:55:06] over it. Yeah. Right. A city on a hill.
[1:55:10] Why is this a serpent harmless as doves?
[1:55:12] Yes. And I wonder sometimes if we've
[1:55:15] taken the pattern of the basket we came
[1:55:17] from. All right. Instead of the pattern
[1:55:19] of Paul, instead of the pattern of of
[1:55:22] the prophet of this age. Yeah. When
[1:55:24] brother Brandon come to Burke call, we
[1:55:26] told the story here recently about the
[1:55:27] mother deer. He didn't compromise with
[1:55:29] Bert Call. He was being salt and light.
[1:55:31] Yeah. He was helping him. He never
[1:55:33] compromised with him. He never
[1:55:35] compromised with the infidel when he
[1:55:36] talked to him about the apple tree.
[1:55:38] Yeah. He just met him where he was.
[1:55:41] Yeah.
[1:55:42] I'm so glad as the musicians come. I'm
[1:55:44] so glad that Jesus met me where I was.
[1:55:47] Aren't you glad he met you that way?
[1:55:50] Amen.
[1:55:55] You know, we're we're billboards.
[1:55:57] Brother Ren teaches that and I've told
[1:55:58] you before, but Brandon teaches that in
[1:56:01] Let Your Light So Shine Before Men,
[1:56:02] we're billboards.
[1:56:04] He said, "We're not salesmen.
[1:56:08] We're not basket
[1:56:10] cases trying to persuade more people to
[1:56:13] move under our
[1:56:16] basket. But brother Brandon talked about
[1:56:18] how he's driving down the road and he
[1:56:19] said he's going at a pretty good rate of
[1:56:21] speed
[1:56:22] and he sees a billboard just has one
[1:56:25] word in the main part of the board. It
[1:56:26] says hungry with a question
[1:56:30] mark. Hungry. He said down at the bottom
[1:56:32] it said three miles ahead. He said it
[1:56:34] caught his attention because
[1:56:36] most
[1:56:37] billboards, he said, had a picture of a
[1:56:41] steak or had some kind of artwork on it,
[1:56:44] a lot of
[1:56:46] words. But this one wasn't catering to
[1:56:48] fancy diners or people who wanted a
[1:56:51] certain kind of
[1:56:54] food. There's churches for
[1:56:57] that. There's people who will go out and
[1:56:59] they have a Methodist flavor or a
[1:57:01] Baptist flavor. There's there's places
[1:57:03] for that, but that's not what this
[1:57:06] billboard was catering to. It just said
[1:57:12] hungry. If you're hungry, we got
[1:57:15] something for you to
[1:57:17] eat. The Bible says, "Blessed are those
[1:57:19] who hunger and thirst after
[1:57:21] righteousness."
[1:57:23] And brother Rand said, "There's not very
[1:57:24] many that's really
[1:57:26] hungry, but if there was a traveler
[1:57:29] traveling on that long
[1:57:30] road and they saw that sign and they
[1:57:33] were
[1:57:34] hungry, that's where they would
[1:57:38] stop. We're not called to be salesmen.
[1:57:41] We're not called to make everybody like
[1:57:43] us. We're not called to force other
[1:57:45] churches to follow our pattern of
[1:57:47] worship. That's not what we're called to
[1:57:49] do.
[1:57:51] I go to churches sometimes and I sit
[1:57:53] there and I want to I want to just break
[1:57:54] out so bad and worship and I know that
[1:57:56] that church may be a little quiet and I
[1:57:59] try real hard
[1:58:00] to just fit in
[1:58:03] and we don't we want to have freedom
[1:58:07] here,
[1:58:08] right? See that's but what is that? You
[1:58:11] say, "Well, did you compromise?" No,
[1:58:12] we're trying to trying to help
[1:58:15] people. Trying to help people. We just
[1:58:17] got to sign up. says, "Are you
[1:58:19] hungry?" You say, "Well, you can't help
[1:58:21] that person. He going to always do what
[1:58:23] he does." But what about them children?
[1:58:25] Them young
[1:58:26] people. I know people look at pastors
[1:58:28] sometimes. They say, "Well, they're
[1:58:29] going to fail
[1:58:30] anyway." What about the young
[1:58:33] people? What about their families? What
[1:58:35] about the church? I don't want nobody to
[1:58:38] fail because I know the damage that it
[1:58:42] causes. Are you hungry this morning? We
[1:58:46] were driving. you forgive me for holding
[1:58:47] you just a few minutes
[1:58:49] long. We were driving the other day from
[1:58:52] Branson where I spent a few days with
[1:58:53] Ben, brother Ben Beard and with Andrew
[1:58:55] Glover and we've done that for the last
[1:58:56] couple
[1:58:58] years. We were driving and I see a barn.
[1:59:01] You remember the Marramck Caverns
[1:59:03] barns and it looked like the the roof
[1:59:05] was pretty freshly painted. Marramck
[1:59:08] Caverns. If you drive down I44 towards
[1:59:10] that place, that's all there is. We
[1:59:12] started counting them one day and lost
[1:59:13] count how many billboards there are for
[1:59:15] Marmet Caverns. But to me, the most
[1:59:18] effective is the is the barns. That
[1:59:21] makes me want to
[1:59:22] go. I kind of disappointed when I went.
[1:59:24] It wasn't all it was cracked up to be,
[1:59:26] but but the barn was there. But I
[1:59:29] noticed something. I almost didn't see
[1:59:32] it. Even though it had been freshly
[1:59:34] painted, or seemed to have been, it
[1:59:36] wasn't
[1:59:37] faded, but there was weeds grown up all
[1:59:41] around it. and them trees had grown up
[1:59:43] all in front of it and that barn had
[1:59:45] been evidently abandoned and and they
[1:59:47] didn't take care of the the ground and
[1:59:49] so all around it just almost covering it
[1:59:51] up was
[1:59:53] brush. I wonder sometimes if that's not
[1:59:55] where we're at as Christians that God
[1:59:58] wants us to be a billboard. He just
[1:59:59] wants us to set a sign out there say
[2:00:01] hungry. You say it doesn't matter if I
[2:00:03] go to the house of God or not. Doesn't
[2:00:05] matter if I go to church does it
[2:00:07] not? Does it matter if you're on the
[2:00:09] side of the road? If you're a billboard,
[2:00:11] what's happened? You've let you've let
[2:00:12] creepers grow up and trees grow up and
[2:00:14] things grow up to obscure the view. But
[2:00:16] it's time we cut that stuff down. And
[2:00:19] Lord, I that's complexes, roots of
[2:00:21] bitterness that grow up all around the
[2:00:23] barn, all around the the place where it
[2:00:25] ought to be a billboard. Now you can
[2:00:27] barely see it. And if they let it go,
[2:00:29] you won't be able to see it at all.
[2:00:33] No man takes a candle and hides it under
[2:00:35] a bushel, but he puts it in the house
[2:00:38] among the believers and he associates
[2:00:40] with
[2:00:41] believers. Are you with me now? That's
[2:00:44] my You'd say, "Brother Ben, I don't
[2:00:45] agree with that. I'll do something
[2:00:46] different." That's that's fine. I could
[2:00:48] I realize that the way we sometimes
[2:00:52] approach the word can be different, but
[2:00:54] for me, I want to be wide open. Say,
[2:00:56] "Well, I'll get hurt. It's
[2:00:58] okay." I'd rather get hurt than not have
[2:01:01] friends.
[2:01:02] I'd rather get hurt than not help, my
[2:01:04] friends. I'd rather get hurt than not
[2:01:06] help
[2:01:08] people. So, we just lay ourselves wide
[2:01:10] open and say, "Lord, what would you have
[2:01:12] for us to
[2:01:14] do?" And every one of us has something.
[2:01:17] You got something that you do in the
[2:01:19] place where you are. And I can start
[2:01:20] calling names. And every one of you with
[2:01:21] the trip, I've heard you at there at the
[2:01:24] at where you work and I've testimonies
[2:01:26] come back to me that you do a good job
[2:01:28] at your work and you're you're you're a
[2:01:29] good young Christian gentleman. That
[2:01:31] means a lot to
[2:01:32] me. What is that? It's a billboard. A
[2:01:35] big
[2:01:36] one. Says
[2:01:38] hungry.
[2:01:41] Hungry. We all are. What are you
[2:01:44] advertising
[2:01:46] today? Let's advertise Christ in our
[2:01:48] lives. Just love one another. Love other
[2:01:51] people. Love other churches. Love
[2:01:53] people. Let's bow our heads together.
[2:01:56] Heavenly Father, I I don't really know
[2:02:00] how to close this service. I just know
[2:02:02] that you want us to be humble and our
[2:02:05] approach. You want us to love one
[2:02:09] another. I pray that we would do that
[2:02:11] here in the
[2:02:12] church. We would not cut ourselves off
[2:02:15] from people. I realize there's some
[2:02:17] things and talk about that tonight. Some
[2:02:19] situations where we got to push away for
[2:02:22] a while.
[2:02:24] But Lord, I I pray for
[2:02:28] reconciliation. Lord, I don't want my
[2:02:30] worst enemy to be
[2:02:32] lost. Oh
[2:02:35] God, Lord, when I realize what you saved
[2:02:37] me
[2:02:38] from, how you've kept me, Lord, I I
[2:02:42] don't want any I don't want any of my
[2:02:45] Lord, those that would maybe even come
[2:02:47] against me or even come against this
[2:02:48] message, I don't want them to be lost.
[2:02:51] Well, sometimes we've got to watch them
[2:02:53] from a distance, save them with fear,
[2:02:56] hating even the garments spotted by the
[2:02:58] flesh. But Lord, may we recognize you in
[2:03:02] it. Pray you'd grant it. May we watch
[2:03:04] for opportunities of reconciliation. I
[2:03:06] pray we thank you for it now in Jesus
[2:03:09] name. Amen. If you need to pray, the
[2:03:11] altar's open. Be glad to pray with you.
[2:03:13] I I love you this morning. If I don't
[2:03:16] shake your hand, you know why. But I
[2:03:18] appreciate you. We love you all.
[2:03:21] Hallelujah.
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:25] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:03:28] Could we just worship him together?
[2:03:29] Let's stand together.
[2:03:33] Praise his name.
[2:03:37] He's in the house. I know he's in the
[2:03:42] house.
[2:03:44] And death has to flee. Why don't we
[2:03:46] worship him a minute, church? He's
[2:03:48] worthy of our praise.
[2:03:50] Let's be a billboard where the darkness
[2:03:53] used to be. Oh, now there is hope.
[2:03:59] There's no more doubt. Oh,
[2:04:03] praise his name.
[2:04:06] He's in the house. Oh, thank you,
[2:04:10] Lord. Hallelujah. Little girl was lying
[2:04:14] there.
[2:04:16] People all were weeping.
[2:04:19] They just laughed at
[2:04:21] Jesus when he said she's lonely
[2:04:25] sleeping. Oh yes. As he took her by the
[2:04:29] hand, she be to live again. Glory. Some
[2:04:35] begin to praise the Lord. Some begin to
[2:04:40] say, "Hallelujah.
[2:04:45] He's in the house. Glory. And death has
[2:04:49] to flee.
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:52] Now there's light where the darkness
[2:04:57] used to be. Oh, now there is hope.
[2:05:02] Oh, there's no more doubt. Hallelujah.
[2:05:07] Praise his name. Oh, he's in the house.
[2:05:14] Thank you, Lord. I was like that little
[2:05:17] girl. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Dead in all
[2:05:20] my
[2:05:22] sins. But Jesus touched this heart of
[2:05:25] mine, gave me life
[2:05:29] again. Well, I am just a house of
[2:05:33] clay. But ever since that blessed
[2:05:36] day, there's a light that shines in me
[2:05:40] for all the world to see.
[2:05:45] Oh yes, he's in the
[2:05:50] house and death has to
[2:05:53] flee. And now there is
[2:05:57] light where the darkness used to
[2:06:01] be. Now there is
[2:06:04] hope and there's no more
[2:06:07] doubt. Can you praise?
[2:06:11] Oh, he's one more time with all your
[2:06:14] hearts now. Oh, he's in the
[2:06:18] house and death has to
[2:06:21] flee. And now there is
[2:06:25] light where the darkness used to
[2:06:29] be. Now there is
[2:06:32] hope and there's no more
[2:06:35] doubt. Can you praise his name?
[2:06:40] He's in the
[2:06:45] house. An amazing
[2:06:50] grace shall
[2:06:52] always be my
[2:06:56] song of praise.
[2:07:01] For it was
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:05] grace that
[2:07:07] bought my
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:14] liberty. Oh, I do not
[2:07:18] [Music]
[2:07:20] know just why he
[2:07:24] came to love me so.
[2:07:30] But he looked
[2:07:34] beyond all my faults. Aren't you glad he
[2:07:37] did it this morning? And he saw my
[2:07:43] needs. And I shall
[2:07:50] forever lift mine eyes to Calary.
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:07:59] to you. That old
[2:08:04] cross where
[2:08:06] Jesus
[2:08:07] died for
[2:08:13] me.
[2:08:15] How the
[2:08:18] less the grace that called my
[2:08:24] falling soul.
[2:08:28] He looked
[2:08:31] beyond all my faults and he saw my need.
[2:08:37] I like this second verse.
[2:08:41] Well, it was God's
[2:08:46] grace that brought me
[2:08:50] out of
[2:08:55] darkness
[2:08:57] into the
[2:09:01] light where I can clearly
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:10] Well, I'll shout it
[2:09:15] from the
[2:09:17] mountains and the
[2:09:23] valleyies that he looked. Oh, aren't you
[2:09:27] glad he looked beyond your faults this
[2:09:29] morning? All my faults and he
[2:09:33] saw my need. And if you believe it, can
[2:09:36] I hear you sing it
[2:09:37] now? Well, I shall
[2:09:43] forever. Oh yes. Lift mine eyes to
[2:09:52] Calary. Oh, just to view that old
[2:09:58] cross where
[2:10:00] Jesus died for me.
[2:10:05] and he died for you. How
[2:10:11] marvelous. Oh, the grace that caught my
[2:10:17] falling
[2:10:20] soul. He looked
[2:10:25] beyond all my faults and he
[2:10:30] saw my need. Can you give the Lord a
[2:10:33] hand clap of praise this morning? Amen.
[2:10:37] Let's go back to the old song, Meeting
[2:10:38] in the Air, KFC. Amen. Aren't you
[2:10:40] thankful for the fellowship that we can
[2:10:42] have? Amen. If the blood of Jesus is
[2:10:44] shed abroad in our hearts, Amen. We can
[2:10:46] have love one for the other. Aren't you
[2:10:48] thankful for the word of the Lord this
[2:10:49] morning? Did you enjoy it? Amen. I
[2:10:51] believe that'll do us good if we'll just
[2:10:53] put that in action. Amen. That's why we
[2:10:55] do what we do is because there's no big
[2:10:57] eyes. There's no little U's. Amen. We're
[2:10:59] we're all level at the foot of the
[2:11:01] cross. And Amen. Amen. If we believe
[2:11:02] this message of the hour, I believe that
[2:11:04] we can have fellowship around that and
[2:11:06] love one another. Isn't that what you
[2:11:08] want to do? Amen. And someday there's
[2:11:09] going to be a meeting in the air and I'm
[2:11:11] going to be there. And if you disagree
[2:11:13] with me and you're there, we're going to
[2:11:14] have fellowship right there around the
[2:11:16] one that we love. So, let's just sing
[2:11:17] with all our hearts now. Amen. And
[2:11:19] you're free to go whenever you feel like
[2:11:20] it. We're just going to sing this song.
[2:11:22] Amen. As you go. Well, there is going to

[2:11:31] sweet by and
