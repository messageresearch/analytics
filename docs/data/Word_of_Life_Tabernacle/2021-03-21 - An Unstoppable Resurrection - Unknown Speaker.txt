you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand i know that god sees in every need he's a real god today that wants to meet your needs whatever they might be heavenly father you see these needs that are represented among the people you see the needs lord in my own body as well in my own life lord one of us are human god and we're subject to the things of the world but yet we believe there's a higher power here today that can take every need lord that we have and make it like nothing that mountain that is before us lord if we speak to it by your word you can be gone in the name of jesus and so we believe that today and we trust god that you would just move in a mighty way i pray lord for each one that's sitting here today each one that is streaming lord on the internet i i pray god that you would just move in every home and every life may we not be the same when we leave as when we come in but may we recognize the power of your word lord to change us and make us different than what we are i pray you'd grant it today we we humble ourselves to your word today father i humble myself to your spirit lord may you just move today in a mighty way lord as as the songs spoke of heaven this morning and the place that we're going to lord we're looking forward to that while we're here let's press on lord and help us to keep going and keep moving until that moment we reach that place and pray granted now bless each one we pray in jesus name amen amen loving this morning hey man it's good to have each and every one of you with us this morning it's good to have our visitors today and and i hope you feel welcome here and and uh it's always good to to see people come to the house of the lord and see smiling faces good to see my sister here from hot springs this morning and and laney it's good to have each and every one of you if you could turn me down just a little bit i feel like i'm i'm echoing to myself i don't like to hear myself that much amen i think it's assumed that preachers like to hear themselves talk but that's not why we do it or shouldn't be why we do it anyway is that right amen isaiah chapter 60. i want to read verses one through three and then i'll have you be seated and then we'll read isaiah 61. isaiah chapter 60 verses one through three but keep your bibles open if you wonder what we believe we believe the word of the lord and we believe that the bible is the word of god and it was written for our edification and every scripture is for that purpose and so we want to be edified by it today isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1 arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people we're living there gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen what a promise says and the gentiles that's us shall come to thy light kings to the brightness of thy rising i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated and then we're going to read again from isaiah 61 and verse 1 so just keep your bibles open isaiah 61 and 1 it says the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings and to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion given to them beauty for ashes all of joy for mourning so in other words at a time when they should be mourning i'm going to give them joy and so it relates to us in a time of darkness they'll have light and the time of when they should be mourning they'll have joy the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness notice the planting of the lord that he might be glorified it says in verse 4 they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations you see brother ben but you don't realize what's in my family and what my family's been like what my situation is but he said they'll rebuild the waste cities and the desolations of many generations sin that has continued generation after generation they'll break the cycle amen and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons and the aliens shall be your plowmen and your vine dressers but you shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god you shall eat the riches of the gentiles in their glory shall you boast yourselves for your shame you shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering he says and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed listen to verse 10 and verse 11 now as we come to our our sermon this morning he said i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god where he hath clothed me with garments of salvation it covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and that's the time of year that we're living in right now the earth is bringing forth her blood and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it notice the wording the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations do you believe what you read amen we could close up and shop right now and go home but i want to talk to you this morning about an unstoppable resurrection an unstoppable resurrection you see the nature of a seed is to reproduce itself for the salmon exactly right if you plant a corn into the ground a seed of corn you expect a corn plant right if you plant a tomato you you expect tomatoes that's what you expect to see because the seed within itself is the ability to reproduce notice what uh god says in genesis 1 11 it says and god said let the earth bring forth grass now think about this think about the power of a god who can do this and this is why we we focus on the word we make the word the most important part of the service because when god said god said not the pastor said not somebody else said but god fit remember what we said the absolute is what god says right and god said let the earth bring forth grass and grass came out and if there's a god that's that powerful to be able to bring grass out of the ground because of his word how much more could he could he affects your life by the word amen and again you say well i don't i i you don't know my past you don't know what i've been through but i know my god and i know a god who come to an earth that was full of chaos an earth that was without form and void in genesis 1 1 and he come to it and he said let there be light and when the light come it began to form something by the david out of all that chaos out of all that confusion out of all the darkness that was there in the earth at that time god began to form and make a light god began to make a world out of that oh my if we could recognize that same god is here this morning and he's willing and wants to make a world that that is according to his own liking he wants to in your life he wants to see a family that serves god a people that love god of people that worship god he wants to form that in your own life and god said we can't stop like that on every word we're going to be here a while god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and notice how he says that not just that it would come but it would yield seed right and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind christians produce christians this isn't legalism this is just what we believe that the word if you believe it it will reproduce the word in your life right if god is in us and we believe that he is then he we reproduce the word in our lives it don't mean we're perfect we make lots of mistakes but that's the flesh but there's something inside of us that reproduces the word and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind notice whose seed is in itself go back just a moment a little bit too fast for me there brother robert whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so i feel bad for brother robert i go so fast he has to anticipate my my next move so the seed is in itself and it was so now the next verse and the earth brought forth grass notice what happened when god said it that's what it did amen aren't you glad to serve a god like that and the herb yielding seed after his kind it didn't bring anything else god said an apple that's what it was god said let it be whatever that it was and there was nothing hurtful there there was no thorn or nothing that that could hurt you remember the thorns and thistles come up after the fall but it was god in that original creation that everything was just the way he was supposed to be and was just perfect in his creation and you can see the elements of that today still in creation that you can see how one feeds off of another how each one fits just perfectly in the ecosystem so that if you take one kind of animal or fruit out of an ecosystem it begins to fall apart why because god made it just so perfect the way it was amen and god saw that it was good now the tree yielding fruit the seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good now what do we have today he said well brother ben how come everything's not perfect today well because of something we would call hybridization we the seeds that god put on the ground all came out of the out of the essence of who god is right so whatever god said if god was goodness and light and purity and holiness and grace whatever seed god produces had to be that right it had to be that it couldn't be anything else but that so it has to be goodness has to be love and that's what the word of god will produce in your life you see how do you know that well i know because the word says so because i know it because it does it right in our lives we can see it and so he he produces that out of himself every every kind of thing that was there so but if you take those things you begin to mix them because satan can't create all he can do is pervert and you see that in the world that we live in today and so god made it a certain way but you take those things and begin to change the definition of it and mix it and make it something it wasn't supposed to be and what happens god saw it was good originally so what would be the perversion of it it would be something that's not good right if what god said is good then if i take it and begin to mess with it it's something that's not good and so in leviticus 19 and 19 is an old testament principle says you shall keep my statute thou shall not let thy cattle gender with the diverse kind i shall not sow thy filled with a mingled seed neither shall a garment mingle of linen and woolen come upon thee which i probably break that law right here today just having these clothes on but it was for a purpose god was doing something he hated the mixing of seeds because it changes what the seed becomes right oh god didn't make any seedless watermelons much as we like them the the thing about being seedless is you can't plant it in the ground i remember when we were kids we'd take them watermelons and eat them and and throw the rinds over the side of the of the fence and next year there'd be watermelons come up because there was still seeds on them watermelon and they began to come up why because it reproduces itself you can take a seedless watermelon out there all day and i don't think you'll get much it may have something that kind of looks like a seed but it's got no life in it and that's the best the church can do today in its hybrid condition that's what the modern church in the modern world becomes is a is a seed that can't produce a life all it is is a is an ineffective little little approximation of what a seed should be but the real seed of god will produce a watermelon every time right so god doesn't make it seedless like that as convenient as it might be right and i have no problem with you eating a seedless watermelon that's the kind i like too if i eat it in the house but god didn't make it that way right now notice the wording in genesis chapter 2 genesis 2 and 1 says thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the hosts of them notice he says finished finished and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested now why did he rest not because he got tired he rested because it was complete right it was finished it was what he wanted it to be you seeing god wants to work in your life until it's what he wants it to be amen so he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and verse three and god bless the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made now notice god never created anything else now watch he said god still creates yes he does but he creates what he's already created he doesn't create a new form of life after creation god could create a squirrel today right we know that we believe that but it's going to be something he already created why because it was good he was resting because everything was the way he wanted it amen hallelujah everything was just the way he wanted he didn't make anything else and so he didn't leave any of his attributes to be expressed at least the ones that were to be expressed at that time were all expressed are you with me now and whatever other attributes he had like mercy and grace and those things could not be expressed because it wasn't needed yet right and so there had to come a fall and this is what we don't understand god wants to do things in your life but sometimes you have to watch a life get broken before it can be remade and the reason for that is because god wanted something to express a particular attribute of salvation a mercy of love in your life he wanted to show that in you and so he had to let you break yourself he didn't do it to you but he let you do it just like he let his children do it in the garden of eden so that you'd come out on the other side and he could express that attribute so all the attributes he could express at that time were expressed now brother branham tells us that he does the same thing with salvation he rested and you become a sealed finished creation and you rest from your works when you receive the holy ghost right and you say brother ben how do you believe that you received the holy ghost well you do it according to the original prescription which is acts 2 peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost right and you may shout haul or scream speak in tongues they did that day they staggered like drunk men right and but those things were all done but the fact that you followed god's commands full obedience to the word of god entitles you to to the token which is the holy ghost now which a token is something that you take and excuse me if i'm being elementary this morning but i'm trying to help us understand completely what i'm talking about as much as i can and the lord will help you with the rest but a token is something that you have to have to get on an airplane you have to have to get on a train and he said the holy spirit the blood will be a token for you so that you can make it to the other side you can make it in a rapture now when you receive that token you're finished work god's rest in your life as far as the attributes he can express in this body because there's things he can't express in this flesh body you'll have to express on the other side but yet in this body we're limited by the flesh but god everything the potential they say well why isn't my life look different why can't i speak to the storm why can't well because it has to grow right those things that are planted in your life you're the planting of the lord but you've got to water it you've got to come to church you've got to live for god not because somebody makes you do us but we don't have membership we don't have any you sign up for anything but but you come because you want to grow you want to become more like christ you want to become more like him and so you you become that now brother branham talks about about hybridization and power of transformation excuse me i'm going to read some this morning but you'll be able to read along with me so i trust it won't be too hard on you but but this i believe this is the light that we've received in this hour on the word of god now uh brother brown says now look they take certain things and put certain things together it makes a chemical that will destroy that weed killer brother david that we used out in the parking lot you used up a parking lot yesterday that weed killer is made up of chemicals but where do they get the chemicals from well on some basic level it has to be it has to come from the earth right they can't create it they just mix it together right he said now leave them in their right position they're all right but put them together they're all wrong that'll make you think differently when you say boy that preacher can really put it together well you have to be careful what you put together because you don't want a cow eating grass in the top of the tree right you don't belong there right so he says to put them together they're all wrong see it brings death and he says when you try to take the word of god and put it in the religion of this world you bring death to yourself it kills the subject it kills the person he said you've got to let everything fall aside and take the word only are you willing to do that today let everything else fall aside and take the word only whatever god says not what the pastor says see you can't do it just because i get up and say this is the way you should live that that's a poor way to live because i said so or because some other man said so or because you see everybody else doing it but because the word of god says so right you've got to let everything fall aside and take the word only stay right with that word don't leave when god said so that's just what it is he says i don't care what education can prove because education can tell you well if you hybridize it it'll create something but it can never be as good as what it was in the beginning amen amen are you with me this morning i said that wednesday night and i wasn't sure now he said but they say today he said in the days of noah they could prove there was no water if they're in the skies but god said there was some coming down and it come and they say today there's no fire up there to fall but watch it fall one day how are we going to do this and that watch god do it he will he said it would do it amen and that seed will take a hold somewhere hallelujah there's something about it you don't know what it is you don't even know why you're attracted to it but there's something about it it's so different from everything else but it attracts you why there's something original inside of you that speaks to that original word inside of you is a betting ground or a place for the word to be planted amen hallelujah now he said how are we going to do this and that watch god do it he will he said it would do it he said that seed will take a hold somewhere glory to god the only thing he's looking for today is a bedding ground somewhere that it can bed it'll start in somebody now watch it will but now he says they'll pervert it and spray it like he did eve it started in eve for her to bed forth and report sons of god not sons of satan but she was a betting ground that fell in the wrong place so the word fallen an unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic remember he told her don't do this huh but instead of that instead of her following the word she stepped out from behind the word and did what she was told not to do right you understand and and now she become a betting ground for the wrong thing and produce the wrong thing because of unbelief now he said so the word phone an unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic it'll make a church member out of them but never a son or daughter of god see being a son or daughter of god so much different from being a church member being a son or daughter of god means being a church member means that you expect that when the baby falls sick that you can call the pastor and you should you should be able to do that but being a son or daughter of god means that you expect to be able to pray and god to hear that prayer amen and so you expect the things to come to pass in your life and so he says he said you tell them to let their hair grow they laugh in your face you tell them to do this or that or the man to do with the left in your face it's not sons of god you tell them what the word says they won't do it you see he said it's the wrong bedding ground yet they're holding the seed see the false anointed ones are anointed yes with the holy spirit speak in tongues do signs and wonders but it's of satan he said well that's hard to understand listen jesus said many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have not i cast out devils work great mighty works in wonders and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity what is iniquity david said if i conceive iniquity in my heart god will not hear me and iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but you won't do it it's iniquity see the condition is just just too much brother ben to do it you know why i take my coat off i know i shouldn't do it because it looks better when my coat's on when you're my size in shape but the conditions are too hot right that's what people are they know they should stay with the word but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of god and do what the organization says well i don't know my church says we should do it this way and i believe it this way see and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it that's iniquity depart from me that you that work iniquity he said look at the great saint paul in first corinthians 13 he said though i speak with the tongue men and angels he said now you that one or somebody want to lay onto that that's the evidence of the holy ghost but also though i speak with tongues like men and angels have not charity he said i am nothing no he said you can speak with tongues yes because it's the word right now whatever the word says but we're not going to attach then see what the pentecostal church did they said if you speak in tongues that's the evidence that you have the holy ghost but the bible didn't say that right so they added something different to what the word says and when they did it produces something that's not right not original right and so he said but the true he said let me go back there 174 you can speak with tongues yes because it's the word a preacher can take this word and go forth and preach it and say that word and that word will grow but the preacher could be a hypocrite himself it's the word right and that's why somebody could say well well i can't listen to no preacher because there's no preacher good enough but it's the word right it's not the preacher it's the word i believe the preacher ought to live what he preaches or stop preaching right but you don't look at that even if the preacher doesn't live it is it the word or not right now but the true living creature of god takes all the purpose the word man all that god purposed all the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out and you add something else with that you get a perverted plant he said if i started out here with a wheat put a cocklebur with it and would interbreed them together if it could be done so by the pollen but in there i got a weak cuckleberry it looks like a wheat yet it's a cockle bird ain't genuine life it can't reproduce itself again it'll come forth but it can't reproduce itself it's important it can come forth it looks like the original but it can't reproduce itself a donkey can breathe to a mere horse she'll bring forth a mule but the mule can't breathe back to a mule it's a hybrid he said let every word bring forth of its kind see it can breed once and the church can come in as an organization once but it can't re-breed itself and brings out another organization that's why we say every organization goes to seed i see in every age there's a there's a sowing and a heart and a reefing in every age as the light comes across every age there's a sowing and reaping the sowing of that age and a reaping of that age but that that that which was not right that which was not correct goes to seed why it's been in the field too long you know what that is you leave it out there long enough it'll go to seed and so brother brandon talked about denominationalism going to seed it'll pick out something and count down on it and make that its focus instead of preaching the whole word of god well i could stop there and preach for a while and all it preaches is one thing because it's went to seed and it can't it it dies every time it dies he said it can't he said lutheran can't breathe to the lutheran and brought out a method of methodists brought out a pentecostal and now he said he said see it can't rebreat back because it's dead it can't start a revival where did god ever start a revival in an organization look over your history what happened he started a revival in the organization kicked it out every time that's what what it does look back in history look over history never did it's the organization that forms behind the revival when luther the man of god come forth with the message of justification behind him come to lutheran church they could never could build up then god sent a man by the name of john wesley there come a revival behind that what they do organized it never could rebring itself again it's sterile he said hallelujah but the word of god shall ever endure that's right it'll bring forth after it's kind what do you need to do brother ben to have revival in the church preach the word amen i don't need to pump it up prime it up whatever i have to know i don't need to bring in a great big band or have or lower the lights or anything else what do i need to do preach the word because the word will produce word verse and it'll produce what was on the day of pentecost hallelujah amen the word of god shall ever endure it'll bring forth of its kind if it ever brought forth a church it was on fire it'll bring forth another church that's on fire if it ever brought forth the people that love god with all of their life families that could serve god together people that could have relationships that were clean and godly if it ever produced that loss it'll produce it again hallelujah don't tell me it's just for another day or it's another time or your old fashioned no god if it ever worked it'll work again preach the word i got reeled down a couple weeks ago and i i was struggling to see my way out and i asked god said god i need you to speak to me and he only told me one thing he said preach what else can i do but preach amen amen and it will produce what god wants it to produce why is it budding this time of year what makes the seeds come out of the ground we think about that they come out just at the right time and and you know we have those 70 degree days in february and you're sitting there thinking well man everything's going to come out and then it's all going to be frost bit or we have a big snow like we did and it'll all be covered over but there's a reason why it comes out when it does and the reason is it waits because it's built into the seed to recognize temperature and time and and how much sunlight it gets right that's built into the seat god knows what he's doing very bad amen so temperature you know in our latitude temperature cycles between the coldest or the heat of summer not the coldest summer the cold of winter so temperature is a signal it can be a useful signal for plants but temperature fluctuates day by day so the plants wait through the temperature they wait through that because there's something in them that in order to survive they've got to know that this is not just a one-day thing this isn't just a campground experience right it's not just a one-time thing but it's got to have the right temperature for the right amount of time to thrive so it waits through that and then and so temperature by itself would not be a reliable signal but it's added to it something called photoperiod which is relative length of the day and night what plants do is actually measure the length of the darkness and when the darkness begins to be pressed together why is it so dark right before the coming of the daylight because the darkness the sun is pushing back the darkness it's a simple way to say it but the sun is pushing back the darkness amen it's so dark it'd be so pitch black but any amount of light will push it back amen and so that what it measures is the length of the darkness so when the days begin to grow longer and longer and the nights go shorter it's watching though it may seem ever so dark but the plant realizes it's time to bud pretty bad because whether they do daylight savings time or not the day's getting longer right amen what god said has got to come forth when the days reach the point and so the darkness it measures the darkness church if we can only recognize that today the hour that we live in what's going on in the world why is everything going crazy why does everything look so crazy you look out here and wonder why does the world look like even the church world's going insane why is everybody going and saying why is everybody crazy all of a sudden i heard of an actor in australia that's decided he wants to be called a tree not a he or a she or they or them or uh whatever are people but it caught a tree and it gets offended and it's a real thing it they thought he was joking he's not he gets offended when people don't call him tree and i feel sorry for him that's mixed up man huh it's not just a you know it's something that really wrong with a person that because you got to be something right you've got to be something and why wouldn't we want to be what god made us see and a prophet coming this agent told us god made you to be happy and free he didn't create you to be frowning all the time he didn't create you just to be under stress all of your life he created you to be free of anxiety he created you to be free of worry he created you to be to live like children before the father he created you that way amen hallelujah why would you want to be anything else but the darkness shows us amen there's something inside of the seed that measures the darkness and shows that it's at the right time of the year hallelujah for the plant to come forth now amen so the plant has to detect light and measure time and translate that information into growth commands right if you look at a c it's very similar to a to a dna technology it's very similar to computer code if you put it in you put one plus one equals two and i don't know how to code but it's something you push the right numbers and put them together in a string it produces something in a computer and you do the right things like that god coded it in such a way that it translates the information of light and time into growth commands listen to zechariah chapter 14 and verse 6. i'm going to try to hurry now as we go through so you just say with me zechariah 14 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which will be known to the lord not day or night how can you measure the time you see why so many people are mixed up how can you measure the temperature how can you measure the time how do you know what kind what time of year it is because when it's cloudy and 50 degrees outside it might be february it might be early in the morning in july right you don't know it might have been a storm pass over there's no way to measure it might be december you don't know what time of year it is it should be one day it's not day or night and the world doesn't know where it is but it shall come to pass in an evening time hallelujah that evening time it shall be light amen amen let that darkness so dissipate the light's coming on amen he said now he has promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seed that would be sown for this day he said the seed is in here that's what he said the seed is the bible amen but it couldn't come to life until the light of the hour hit it right and so you read your bible you're confused you don't know what time do i live in should i go build a boat right that's what god told noah do i need to start go back and start my watching my dietary restrictions and start watching whether i'm mixing certain clothes that's what god told moses right should i do i need to go back and at a certain time wear sandals and long hair and try to look in physical appearance like jesus now what hour do i live in what time is it see i agree all that is the seed of god it's the word of god but what season am i am i in amen that's the song said even the fool can see by the shape she's in this whole world's about to fall hey ben kenny infant song he said now he's promised to send you heavenly you he's promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seed that would be sown for this day the seed is in here the seed is the bible why jesus said so the word is the seed that the sower sowed you remember the parable of the sower you can go read that when you have time but now amen amen now he said now before you can have any crop no matter if you sow the seed it's got to have light to ripen that seed oral rot won't do no good it'll perish and so you sit and you wonder sometimes why does the word not work the way it should in my life i read the bible i read it i sit there and i go over and over and you got to have the light on the word you've got to be able to measure the time and the temperature you can only do that when the sun comes up in the evening light right now with the right kind of sunlight on it it's got to ripen he said and he promised in the last days in the evening time the sun would come out to ripen that seed it's the next quote i know i skipped some of it and he said the seed is being preached the son of god is ripening that seed now watch the seed is being preached and the son of god is ripening that seed by vindicating it amen there's got to be some vindication it can't be just dead later that's why paul even in his day he said i didn't come just with just with the letter only the letter killeth but the spirit gives life there's got to come some manifestation of the word right to bring light see the the son of god is ripening that seed by vindicating and making it push out before you proving it's right he said so you can recognize your day now brother branham preaches a sermon titled it is the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun not it was or will be it is there is a man here who can turn on the light huh you notice it is it is the rising of the sun there is a man here who can turn on the light shalom arise shine your light has come amen now brother branham tells us that christ is the light and i'm reading the end of this quote and the light is the life and the word manifested is the light of the hour amen and again he says listen close we have seen the light his word that he promised for his day proven and vindicated it's the truth in the light of the hour he said oh my i'm so glad there is nothing wrong god knows what he's doing can we just rest in that he said well my baby got sick i don't understand god knows what he's doing god wants to heal your baby god wants to take care of you god but god knows what he's doing it's the truth he said we've seen the light his word that he promised for this day proven and vindicated it's the truth the light of the hour there is nothing wrong nothing wrong now you could couldn't have told jonah that when he was running from god a man running from the presence of the lord but in god's mind there was nothing wrong because he come out on the other side and a fish spit him out and the people said oh it's go it's our gods fish he come out of out of a big fish hooked out on dry land and god turned his stubbornness into a supernatural event hey bad think god don't know what he's doing brother branham in that sermon there's a man here who can turn on the light he tells a story about a minister who went and got his car fixed because the minister of course couldn't fix the car himself preachers aren't that handy i did hear a story about brother homer we talked about him this morning homer longoria and this is his face so brother homer if this is wrong if you listen to this god bless you i'm sorry but someone told me that brother homer was preaching one time at a certain place and he he uh something was wrong with his car all of a sudden he's back here studying in the office and he realizes what's wrong with it or what he thinks is wrong with it and so he runs outside to fix it and they start and they call him out call him out and call him out and he don't come and they walked outside and he got his sleeves rolled up he's working on his car because he just had that idea of what it was but see most of the time preachers aren't very good working on cars because you're usually only good at so many things right and there's a good life lesson to learn i got to get back to preaching here in a minute that's a good life lesson to learn you're only good at so many things and the things you are good at you probably need to do right and the things you're not good at you probably don't need to do amen brother joe isn't that right for you for me and brother joe that's right the things we're not we're good at certain things not the same things but now the little mechanic turned around now he went to get his uh car fixed let me tell the whole story went and got his car fixed and the mechanic can't figure out what's wrong with it he got no idea he's looking at he's saying this is it's one of these newfangled jobs got all the bells and whistles on he can't figure it out he's having a well-dressed man come into the mechanic shop that day he said can i tell you how to fix it he said well i i don't know what i'm doing so he he said let me do it so he walked over there and he moved this here and moved this over here and tightened this up here and it started and the little mechanic turned around and said say who are you he was the engineer he was general motors chief engineer that's the first problem it was general motors well that ain't doctrine but he said he made the thing are you with me today don't you feel just relaxed in the presence of god today he made the thing he was the one who designed it hallelujah and today when we're talking about methodist baptist presbyterian but the chief mechanic is here it was the same way in jesus day they had pharisees and sadducees in the scenes and all the different denominations and quotes that were out there everything was different but all at once the chief mechanic walked out and it took john who was not that light but he bare record of the light hallelujah it took john to shine a spotlight on the one who was coming and he didn't say behold my methodist behold my baptist behold my sadducee behold my pharisee what did he say behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world listen he didn't say behold word of life tabernacle be all been pruitt behold something else he said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world the chief mechanic is here the designer of his word the man who created the heavens and earth and designed his church brother ben why do you do things like you do we try to stay just as close to the word as we can stay why do we do that because the designer said it a certain way we want to be that way hallelujah amen he said does he know more about what it takes for the rapture or does the methodist or baptist church know more about what it takes he is the designer he knows what it takes he is well dressed in the power of his resurrection very bad he looks like a chief engineer he's well dressed in the power of his resurrection hallelujah he's walking among us today in the power of his resurrection he is walking among us today we're not waiting on him we're not looking for light to come light has come he knows what it takes hallelujah to put a church in rapture order he designed it and put the parts together here in the bible amen he said just let the current flow through it now watch it operate let faith in his promised word of today flow through you'll see how it operates i gotta calm down you're gonna see a fat man shout he said why he designed the thing amen he designed his church by the word that's what he puts together not by methodist or baptist or presbyterian or pentecostal organization but by his word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god so he says get out of them glares in the midst of darkness this dark time that we're living in now in the midst of darkness who is going to bring the little bride out who knows about it the chief designer hallelujah light brings about an unstoppable resurrection brother david you spray them weeds spray that grass it just keeps coming keeps coming keeps coming why the earth is warmed up well i pray that god would do that for us here what are you doing brother man what are you doing week by week and week after week what are we doing letting the earth warm under the rays of the message of the hour and when it gets to a certain temperature all of a sudden seed begins to come up people begin to prosper people begin to come up and receive the blessings of god take advantage of the promises of god why because it's reached that point hallelujah you can't stop it you build a sidewalk across it'll come out underneath it it'll crack concrete you've seen it it'll come up every time why it's an unstoppable resurrection you can't stop the spring go ahead and try to do it it may be delayed for a while the groundhog may come out and say oh so many more weeks but he don't know he's famous for being wrong but once the spring comes you know it and you can't unsee the resurrection right that tree out here it's it's flowering it's blooming and you can't see that it's producing flowers it's producing them lovely white flowers that you just get up in the morning you drink it in oh it just feels so good drink in the pollen and you get sick you can't stop that resurrection by them trees they plant them everywhere and they just spread why you can't stop a resurrection and what hour are we living and we're living in the time when the seed is to be resurrected so what does the devil do now once that atmosphere is right that seed has to come out so the devil has only one thing you can do try to put a shadow over it we were down here at grand gulf state park here the other day and we're looking in the middle of winter and there's trees out there that grow up like this and like this and like this so straight up it's like a an elbow in a in a pipe under your under your sink think how in the world why'd it grow like that shade shadows sunlight all right it's going to reach for the sunlight amen hey man now watch the devil can't stop you so he tries to cast a shadow over you to affect your growth you don't think satan's trying so hard to do that that's why he wants to make people mess up in such a way that the world will know and say oh these people aren't christians trying to stop the growth but it is an unstoppable resurrection there's all these dead trees you go to a place where the trees men all burn off and here's these old tree trunks standing there now why did the fire have to come because the old trees were keeping the sun from reaching all the undergrowth from reaching the new new seeds that would come up and replace them right so seeds that were planted in another day in another light in another atmosphere we'll tend to block out new seeds right so those seed planted in a denominational light will grow up become great big and block out everything else but when a new day comes when the time comes god will send a wildfire through that'll burn it all up and when it does it'll just be a trunk an old old black trunk and what it does is it mourns brother brandon talked about that and it mourns in his sister and said tries to make it seem like just awful creepy kind of a place why because it's morning it is trying to keep anything cast a shadow all the shadow that it can cast but when the time comes and it's been burnt off here comes every little seed that's in the ground begin poking its way up and those little those little saplings that a prophet said could move in the wind amen those little saplings will begin to come up regardless why because he tried to throw a shadow over him but satan can't stop god what did they do to jesus they tried to throw a shadow over his ministry say he was illegitimately born say he wasn't really virgin born all these things don't you realize what science is still doing that today they're trying to tell you all evolution did this and and this is the way it was but god said in the beginning amen god created the heavens and the earth period hallelujah amen they try to cast a shadow over that brother brahmana said the pharisees i'm closing in just a moment just hang with me for a moment he said the pharisees and leaders of his they always tried to belittle him before the people it was just a way that the devil had of working all the pharisees and the teachers of his state constantly tried to belittle jesus all the throw-off that they could give to him they'd done it they watched him constantly to find where they could find a fault you realize where that spirit comes from if you identify yourself with a fault finder that's always trying to find fault do you know where that spirit come from it didn't come from god oh it's the devil constantly watching jesus watching the word to see if he could find a fault and they never spoke of his good things they were always finding something that they could belittle him about and say you see looky here if he was a man of god he wouldn't do it this way really satan will even let that spirit get down in your own relationship in your marriage and your church and it'll come down you begin to find fault with everything that don't come from god he never does he'll try to come down and and brother brown would say spray his poison malice spray his poison spray of malice anger hypocrisy huh find something they could belittle him about say you see look at here if he was a man of god he wouldn't do it this way if he was a man of god he wouldn't do it that way they were trying to cast a shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieve him that's the work of the devil i don't want to do the devil's work do you he he's good enough at it as he is let him do his own work i don't want to do it i don't want to do that in my marriage i don't want to do the devil's work god help me sometimes we get negative and i'm i'll be right there with you i know i've lived through that i know what that's like you get down you get negative and pretty soon you're doing the devil's work in your own marriage and you know there's nothing you want more than to keep the marriage alive and keep it going and you keep bringing up stuff that's doing the devil's work i'm sorry i that wasn't in my notes now that's the work of the devil but in all of that amen the ones that believed him we got somebody here that believes him this morning and loved him and had seen his scriptural miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him those who loved him stood by him they would not see what others pointed out to them or if we could be that if we could just not see if somebody would come around here and say you know what they say you're pentecostal not by the denomination and see that's what people try to do say what are you they try to find out what what are you are you pentecostal or your baptist are you this that or the other no i'm what god said this is that which was spoken of in the scripture right but they try to say that so they can cast a shadow on you with shade on that seed not by denomination you hear them kind of baptized in jesus name yeah that's right well let me tell you something i know a man one time was baptized like that he did so and so but lookie that has nothing to do with it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow on you they're always trying to point you to some old ship that got wrecked upon the seashore watch those that work that do the work of the devil always trying to point you to some old ship that got wrecked upon the seashore but they're not pointing you to the one that made the voyage safely amen and somebody that's all their ministry is point to the wreck point to the wreck but let's point to the one who made the void safely always trying to throw a crowbait out there and i had to look that up i'll confess i didn't know what a probate was crowbait is an old horse or an old animal is just about to die they're always trying to throw a crowbait out there and say this is the example here here's what the message produces here's what the word of malachi 4 produces here's what here's what a christian look at this old crowbar they tried to throw some some internet preacher some some preacher off of television somewhere well all they want is money here's what they produce some old crowbait hey man here's what did it this is the example i know if a certain preacher was a holiness preacher he did this out of the other but they don't point out others that wasn't holiness did that also they don't point listen and they don't point the great things that god did amen like somebody say oh here this man went too far he went too far he might have done that he wrecked himself up he went too far he'd become a fanatic he might have done that but while they're pointing out to how many that went one went too far how about these millions that never went far enough you fail to see that why those people over-emotional but how about the millions that never never even felt god so the people tried them pharisees and sadducees and hypocrites and herodians all tried to cast a shadow on jesus but them true believers it was predestinated to hear that message heard it and seen no fault in it at all hallelujah same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't listen they don't see anything wrong with his people did i tell you i don't see anything wrong with you today does that mean there's nothing wrong with me brother ben i'm going straight to heaven bust the pearly gates wide open that's between you and god but i don't see anything wrong in you why because i believe you're produced by the word and what the word produces is good they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see jesus you see where the devil would like to point you to people and he'll point you to so many people that have done it wrong that you'll never come back to church again because it points you to this pastor that misled this man that fell this woman that did this this man that did this this business meeting that went wrong whatever it is this is what it is and here here's the crowbar but if they're predestinated eternal life they don't see anything wrong with this people they just take sides with jesus and stay there hallelujah amen musicians go ahead and come or i'll keep preaching first thessalonians 4 15 it says this be saying to you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord that is the word right the same god what god said let every tree bring forth after his kind every seed bring forth out of his kind god said those who are which alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall be caught up together with him in the clouds god said god said but that that's been in the scripture all this time but it takes the transforming light of this hour oh god i hope you see it today it takes the power of god the transforming power of god has taken us from the chaos of science and education the things of the world the understanding of this modern day has transformed us now into sons and daughters of god and even death itself can never hold us in the grave ain't no grave can ever hold my body down even death itself can never hold us in the grave we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye is it all you mean to say i mean to say that's the truth jesus that word stood on the earth which was the word the one that raised up and raised lazarus he said i am the resurrection of the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die there is no way to stop the living word of god it's got to rise again are you hearing me this morning sorry i don't mean to scream at you but i'm just telling you what i feel this morning it's got to rise again you see the springtime coming up it's an unstoppable resurrection when christ went into the ground it was an unstoppable resurrection because the word said i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption i'll not leave his soul in hell so it was unstoppable because the word of god said so that same word said if you go on the ground you're a believer you've been manifesting the light of the hour you'll come up not only will you come up but you're already risen it is the rising of the sun you risen from dead creeds denominations to the word of god from out of this chaos of modern scientific eden we're living in a culture science and education all this modern stuff will rise the roboflesh will drop and rise and seize the everlasting prize we'll go through the air and this will all be over for the word of god that's brought us from the modern thinking of our mind transforming our mind into the renewing of our hearts towards god and our spirits that same spirit that spoke that has transformed us this far and it will also take us into his presence into his glory with a glorified body would you bow your heads with me this morning it's an unstoppable resurrection oh what hope that gives to minister the gospel you stand here and i heard that charles spurgeon told his a young preacher he said young preacher come to scourge he said i don't ever see anybody baptized no one ever gets saved he said well how many do you expect to get saved he said that's it [Music] you have to believe that god will do what he said he will do i believe he'll do that today maybe this is your time and your moment you'd like to just slip up a hand you say there's no power in that the word of god said that there is you define gravity by raising your hand in fact the word says that while the word was preached in the book of acts they received the holy ghost the holy ghost fell on the audience i believe it could be that way today you don't have to wait even to be baptized to receive the holy ghost you receive it right now he said brother ben what will i do well the word the holy spirit the spirit comes without sensation so it don't create a sensation but there's something about it when you receive it i believe it'll do something for your life it'll change you whether you shout jump run haul or scream you might do all that because that's the effects of its presence but it'll change you from what you are would you just slip up your up your hands say brother ben i i need that work that word to work that way in my life i want it to work according to the bible i want to be a bible christian god bless you this morning god bless those hands i want to be a bible christian pray with you now heavenly father we believe lord that you have some bible christians today is it so simple that we could become more like you just by acknowledging our need of you i believe it is i pray heavenly father that you would just move over this congregation maybe there's troubled minds today unsettled not sure i pray god that you'd move over their hearts and their lives today and just help them to soak in the word of god lord to be like the bereans that were more noble than the others because they went and searched the scriptures to see if the things that paul said were true i pray it would be so in every one of our hearts for each one that raised their hand lord i pray that there would be an unstoppable resurrection it would be a real bible christian that wouldn't let anything affect them no shade no shadow for of old dead trees keeping them back holding them back from doing the what god said they could do i pray you'd grant it lord we believe we can live a victorious life we don't live under a law or a bondage but we live a life that we now live in the flesh is because of the son of god risen in our hearts we thank you for that today thank you for all that you do thank you for producing joy and happiness in our lives and for bringing us to the springtime lord winter don't last forever we grieve with those who grieve lord but mourning only only lasts for the night joy comes in the morning weeping endures for the night but joy comes in the morning we believe that today god i pray that joy would come in every heart lord that you just move and move everything out of the way bring about that unstoppable resurrection out of the shade out of the shadow from under the concrete it's been buried under speak to each and every one of these people we pray in jesus name amen would you stand
