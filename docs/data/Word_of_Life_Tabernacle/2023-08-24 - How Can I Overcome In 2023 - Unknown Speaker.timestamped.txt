[44:09] chapter 3 and verse 21.
[44:13] Revelation 3 21
[44:16] we'll forget we have the uh brother
[44:18] Allen teaching on finances Sunday at 1
[44:22] 30. we'll uh
[44:25] try to let you out an appropriate time
[44:27] where you can get to that those of you
[44:28] that want to go I would encourage you
[44:31] especially us younger couples to go if
[44:33] we can and we'll have that this weekend
[44:35] and then the next weekend we'll have to
[44:37] skip that week because it's a holiday
[44:38] weekend Labor Day and so we're going to
[44:41] not have a second service on Labor Day
[44:43] as is our custom on holiday weekends so
[44:46] if you're planning something for Labor
[44:47] Day we'll just have one service that
[44:49] that weekend and I believe it's Labor
[44:51] Day coming up isn't it not very good on
[44:53] the holidays so just be remembering that
[44:56] brother Wendell Martin has meetings the
[44:58] brother that preached here for us he has
[45:00] meetings coming up I'm going to go to
[45:02] those in two weeks starting in two weeks
[45:04] from tonight I'll be here on Wednesday
[45:05] but then we'll go up there on Thursday
[45:07] of that week and so anybody that would
[45:10] like to go he extended his invitation to
[45:13] you and and said that they'd find a
[45:15] place to put you up if you wanted to go
[45:16] so if anybody was thinking about going
[45:18] let me know if you didn't have a place
[45:21] to stay I'm gonna go and and try to
[45:23] fellowship with them we appreciate their
[45:25] friendship and I'm sure it'll be a good
[45:27] meeting I'm sure you have good Services
[45:29] here as as well and and then we'll just
[45:33] continue on and believe in the Lord
[45:34] hasn't God been good to us these Sunday
[45:37] night services lately just been the
[45:39] presence of God so real I believe that
[45:41] can be every service and and it just we
[45:44] just need to commit ourselves completely
[45:46] to the Lord and let him do what he does
[45:48] through US amen amen and Revelation 3 21
[45:52] good to be in church with you tonight
[45:54] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[45:57] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[46:01] overcame and am set down with my father
[46:05] in his throne I pray the Lord when that
[46:08] is blessing to the word you may be
[46:10] seated this evening
[46:11] I want to speak
[46:13] to you tonight on how can I overcome in
[46:16] 2023
[46:18] how can I overcome in 2023 I
[46:22] was thinking of preaching I've got a
[46:25] series that I'm studying on something
[46:27] doctrinal maybe that will be coming up
[46:30] but as I begin to think about these
[46:32] things I I realize that we're all uh
[46:35] there's things that we all need to
[46:37] overcome and the age that we live in and
[46:39] we've been given a message that it
[46:43] enables us gives us the tools to do that
[46:45] and I don't care whether you're 16 or or
[46:48] 86 in the service tonight there's some
[46:51] things that you need to overcome and I
[46:54] have things that I have to overcome
[46:56] having something to overcome doesn't
[46:59] mean that you're a sinner it means that
[47:01] you're a Christian and and you need to
[47:03] overcome that and I see so many people
[47:05] when they begin to things begin to
[47:08] happen maybe they fail in some way or or
[47:10] they struggle in some way and so they
[47:12] start hanging out at church and and they
[47:15] begin to fall back a little bit from the
[47:16] house of God and and they begin to kind
[47:19] of kind of move back from the presence
[47:21] of God no that's the time to move closer
[47:23] that that's the time to go to church
[47:25] that's the time to really press the
[47:27] battle is when you're struggling because
[47:29] that's the hour when you need him the
[47:31] most
[47:32] because the word of God tells us how to
[47:35] overcome in our day don't you love that
[47:38] tonight that the word of God has given
[47:40] us the tools that we need as I said here
[47:42] not long ago brother Branham didn't
[47:44] leave the scene and and take the tools
[47:46] with him and and say finish the work
[47:48] with no tools that's not what he did but
[47:50] he gave us the tools the message of the
[47:52] hour so that the work could be finished
[47:54] we can go home one of these days
[47:57] so we have the tools to do that now
[48:00] everybody fails everybody makes mistakes
[48:03] if you don't make mistakes it means
[48:05] you're not doing enough
[48:07] right and and there's one thing someone
[48:09] said there's one redeeming thing about a
[48:11] mistake it proves that somebody stopped
[48:13] talking long enough to do something
[48:17] and the old saying I'd rather try and
[48:20] fail than fail to try
[48:22] right we make mistakes brother Branham
[48:24] says it this way it always struck me he
[48:26] said I'd rather be on the battlefield
[48:27] making mistakes than criticizing someone
[48:30] that's trying to do something for God
[48:33] so I'd rather be on the battlefield and
[48:35] even though I might make a mistake out
[48:37] there at least I'm in the fight
[48:39] right so we but we make mistakes and yet
[48:42] even in our mistakes we don't do things
[48:45] as Christians I believe I'm speaking to
[48:46] mostly Christians here tonight we don't
[48:49] purposely go against the word of God and
[48:51] and cross the word of God and yet every
[48:53] day we do things maybe that we would
[48:55] like to do better or or some Omission
[48:58] some mistake of you know sometimes I I
[49:00] find myself I need to deal with
[49:02] something and I just don't deal with it
[49:04] in the kind of with the kind of urgency
[49:06] that it needs to be dealt with and
[49:08] that's on me that that's a problem that
[49:10] I have but the word of God teaches me
[49:12] how to do that
[49:13] how to deal with things and and even in
[49:17] my family my home in the church and all
[49:19] of us come to that same place we make
[49:21] mistakes but we are washed from our
[49:23] mistakes by the water of the word we are
[49:26] not victims we are not we are not well
[49:28] uh well we'll just we'll just have to
[49:30] keep doing what we're doing we're not a
[49:32] bunch of people that have to keep
[49:33] repeating the mistakes of the past we
[49:35] don't have to do what our parents did we
[49:37] don't have to do what the what they did
[49:39] 20 years ago or 10 years ago or five
[49:42] years ago or one year ago we can change
[49:44] things and it's up to us to do that and
[49:47] every day we ought to be vigilant about
[49:49] that
[49:50] right can I give you a little reference
[49:53] of something I I read today actually and
[49:56] it's kind of carnal but I read that uh
[49:59] you know the the Chiefs have won the
[50:00] Super Bowl a couple times recently and
[50:02] but Joel you can just shut your ears for
[50:04] a moment but they won the Super Bowl and
[50:07] I was reading about their coach and and
[50:09] his attention to detail and and they
[50:12] said what he'll do is he'll actually you
[50:14] come in one time and he called over the
[50:16] management he said he said did you
[50:18] notice the goal post when when we came
[50:20] in and they said no we didn't notice the
[50:22] goal post he said go look at it and
[50:23] there was a was a scratch on the goal
[50:25] post he said he said now what do you
[50:27] think he said when you bring a player in
[50:28] here that we want to we want to make him
[50:30] a Kansas City chief he said what do you
[50:33] think that does to us as an organization
[50:35] how that represents the Kansas City
[50:37] Chiefs to have a scratch on the goal
[50:39] post well he had a guy go out and paint
[50:40] it and it's easy to do but hard to see
[50:44] right and the thing is we get little
[50:46] scratches on the goal post we get little
[50:48] things that we just don't take care of
[50:49] and pretty soon there's something else
[50:51] and pretty soon there's something else
[50:53] and after a while it's something else
[50:54] and we let a little depressed Spirit sit
[50:57] around us for a while and some little
[50:58] Spirit of something else been around us
[51:00] for a while we don't deal with it pretty
[51:02] soon we uh we find ourselves out of
[51:04] church we found ourselves back slips wow
[51:06] we didn't deal with it while we had the
[51:07] opportunity now's the time to deal with
[51:09] it the Bible says today is the day of
[51:12] salvation today's the day to change your
[51:14] life for the better don't wait everybody
[51:16] loves a good Redemption story but don't
[51:18] wait until you're washed up or or to you
[51:20] on your last legs until you're uh get in
[51:22] by the by the skin of uh of your
[51:25] fingertips but wait but now is the time
[51:28] to serve God
[51:29] especially if you're young give him the
[51:31] strength of your youth serving while
[51:33] you're young
[51:36] so
[51:37] we we come to church
[51:39] we come here for a purpose brother Brown
[51:41] said for one specific purpose
[51:44] he said this is the house of correction
[51:46] this is the throne have you ever thought
[51:49] about it like that he said this is the
[51:51] Throne of God and and judgment Goes
[51:54] Forth from the house of God
[51:56] he said the Holy Ghost is among us and
[51:59] we're here to take Reckoning among us to
[52:02] see where our short places are now
[52:04] that's just not your short places that's
[52:06] my short places
[52:08] some of us have shorter places than
[52:10] others but we do we have short places
[52:12] places where we don't meet the mark he
[52:15] said how we can catch from where we
[52:17] should be over to where we ought to be
[52:19] now where we are and where we ought to
[52:22] be he said and that's what we've studied
[52:24] ministers studied those places for their
[52:27] people when they see the people the lack
[52:30] he said then they begin on that
[52:32] I said brother Ben why are you always
[52:34] preaching about certain things well it's
[52:37] because you study where the people are
[52:40] that's what you study and then that's
[52:42] where you preach and and hopefully those
[52:44] two are the same things now because we
[52:46] don't if I can preach against something
[52:47] nobody here is doing and I can preach
[52:49] against that number said praise God for
[52:51] that you know and everybody's happy and
[52:53] everybody's excited get behind it we can
[52:55] we can attack some group over somewhere
[52:57] I could spend all my time on that but
[52:59] that's not what we're dealing with
[53:00] that's not what we're fighting here
[53:03] are you with me now so we got to deal
[53:06] with what we're what we're what are our
[53:08] challenges what do we need to overcome
[53:10] in 2023
[53:12] that's good and so I typed into Google
[53:15] and if you could show that brother
[53:17] Robert I believe I put a picture on
[53:19] there
[53:20] of this I typed into Google how can I
[53:22] overcome and you know Google has
[53:24] suggestions
[53:25] and what this is based on is what this
[53:29] is based on is you probably can't see it
[53:31] from the back but what it's based on is
[53:32] uh is searches that are done in our area
[53:36] so it locates you and then it it says
[53:39] this is what this is the searches that
[53:41] have been done how can it overcome
[53:43] and I thought this was interesting it
[53:45] says how can I overcome depression
[53:48] how can I overcome anxiety
[53:51] how can I overcome social anxiety do you
[53:53] see a trend
[53:55] how can I overcome fear
[53:57] how can I overcome jealousy how can I
[54:00] overcome procrastination
[54:02] how can I overcome loneliness it's a big
[54:05] one how can I overcome lust how can I
[54:09] overcome stress
[54:11] I need that one how can I overcome my
[54:13] anxiety again and so those are the top
[54:16] 10 results of what people are actually
[54:18] searching for in our area so it's not
[54:20] just us but guess what we're human
[54:23] beings
[54:24] we're human beings so we're affected by
[54:26] this the same as anybody else see
[54:28] because your flesh is no more saved than
[54:31] any other flesh
[54:33] and we need to disabuse ourselves of the
[54:35] notion that when we receive the Holy
[54:37] Ghost somehow we become some type of
[54:39] Superman and Super women that were able
[54:41] to just fly from other clouds the Holy
[54:43] Ghost is what gives you the ability to
[54:45] overcome the ability to fight but then
[54:48] you still got to overcome you still
[54:50] gotta fight he wants Sons and Daughters
[54:52] he don't want Angels If he if he wanted
[54:54] Angels he'd just let the Angels do it
[54:57] but he wants Sons and Daughters of God
[54:59] who've overcome something have been
[55:01] through something have character in
[55:03] their lives
[55:04] so these are things we all deal with at
[55:06] some point in our lives I'm not going to
[55:07] preach on those things because brother
[55:08] random when he preached how can I
[55:10] overcome he stops it there he doesn't
[55:13] say how can I overcome this or that or
[55:15] the other because the things the tools
[55:18] that he gave us and how can I overcome
[55:20] was actually telling us what we could
[55:23] overcome no matter what it was
[55:26] he's telling us how to overcome it not
[55:29] what to overcome if there's some things
[55:31] that we fight as I begin to think about
[55:33] it there's some things that are specific
[55:35] to 2023 maybe they didn't fight in 1963
[55:38] but they fight we fight on today and yet
[55:41] the the antidote for it the formula for
[55:43] uh for overcoming it is still the same
[55:46] we we fight a great religious deception
[55:49] of course they did then but it's just
[55:51] gotten worse
[55:53] in in the world that we live in there's
[55:54] religious deception even even in a
[55:57] Messengers religious deception we fight
[55:59] that
[56:00] we fight bad attitudes
[56:03] we should say sinful attitudes
[56:06] influenced by and expressed on social
[56:09] media
[56:11] right right we fight that
[56:13] we fight soft living
[56:15] somebody said amen he said is this a
[56:18] Wednesday night brother Ben or a Sunday
[56:19] morning well
[56:22] but all of us do I'm not particularly
[56:24] directing this to this little crowd
[56:26] sitting here tonight I'm talking about
[56:28] all of us
[56:29] we fight soft living which makes us
[56:31] unwilling to resist the devil because of
[56:33] difficulty
[56:35] we fight over stimulation
[56:39] by entertainment
[56:43] even our children fight that we hand
[56:46] them one of these and and they become
[56:48] overstimulated so they can't sit in
[56:49] church
[56:51] and and all children have a problem
[56:53] sitting in church but it makes it even
[56:54] harder if they're on this all the time
[56:56] have a hard time sitting still
[56:58] we fight adults fight over stimulation
[57:01] by entertainment if you've always got
[57:03] something in front of you you always
[57:04] have to have something in front of you
[57:05] and the thing is what did stimulate you
[57:07] won't stimulate you in the in the future
[57:10] and so what happens if you're
[57:11] overstimulated by entertainment many
[57:13] times with men that leads and sometimes
[57:15] with women as well but especially with
[57:17] men that leads to boredom which leads to
[57:19] infidelity or sexual sin
[57:21] we fight that
[57:24] huh we fight that brother Branham had
[57:27] the cross in his car for a reason
[57:30] I have to fight that you have to fight
[57:32] that come on church not a bunch of
[57:34] angels
[57:36] we fight that and we better fight it or
[57:38] if we don't fight it we've given into it
[57:42] we fight a casual attitude towards the
[57:44] things of God we talked about that on
[57:46] Sunday
[57:48] he said but brother Ben I have the Holy
[57:50] Ghost but that's wonderful but as I said
[57:52] you're empowered now to overcome in John
[57:54] 1 and 12 but as many as received him to
[57:57] them that's to us today to them gave him
[58:00] power to become the sons of God even to
[58:03] them that believe in his name not that
[58:05] you weren't always in the seed of sun
[58:07] but that seed had to be expressed as a
[58:09] son or a daughter of God see you you
[58:12] have to fight and become come to your
[58:14] position you've been given power to do
[58:15] that Romans 13 and 14 but put you on the
[58:18] Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision
[58:20] for the flesh to fulfill the lust
[58:23] thereof so you are a Christian but you
[58:24] got to put on the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:26] Galatians 5 16 this I say then walk in
[58:30] the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[58:33] lust of the flesh First Corinthians 10
[58:35] 12 wherefore let him to think if he
[58:37] stand and take heed lest he fall
[58:40] I remember many years ago I came when I
[58:43] was pastoring I think in bransville when
[58:45] I was very young I came and heard Aaron
[58:47] McGarry preaching this Pulpit many years
[58:49] ago and he stood here and he used that
[58:51] scripture and he said it was after a
[58:52] youth camp and the youth had gone to
[58:54] Louisiana he preached on Wednesday night
[58:56] I'll never forget what he said he said
[58:58] that scripture wherefore let him think
[59:00] of these stand to take take heed lest he
[59:01] fall he said he'd have to be standing in
[59:03] order to fall
[59:05] so it's not something just thinks they
[59:06] stand but somebody that that thinks
[59:09] they're okay
[59:11] right they're standing but they fall who
[59:13] is that a Christian
[59:14] but thank God you can get back up
[59:16] as a Christian you will get back up
[59:21] it's always stuck with me
[59:23] brother Brandon was asked the question
[59:25] is it possible for a holy ghost-filled
[59:27] person to be influenced to do minor
[59:29] things he doesn't want to do
[59:31] and he answers that and he says you're
[59:33] right in the place then to be drove by
[59:35] those things you just put yourself up a
[59:38] Target
[59:39] in first John 4 and 4 here he says
[59:43] you're of God Little Children how many
[59:45] believe that tonight you are of God in
[59:47] other words you're the seed of God you
[59:48] have the Holy Ghost you've been born
[59:51] again and have overcome them because why
[59:55] have you overcome them the greater is he
[59:57] that is in you than he that is in the
[59:59] world it's not that he that is in the
[1:00:00] world is not fighting you but it's
[1:00:02] because see that's in you is greater or
[1:00:04] aren't you glad for that tonight he
[1:00:07] that's in you is greater than he that's
[1:00:09] in the world
[1:00:11] so how do we overcome in 2023 is this
[1:00:13] okay tonight I I trust that it is the
[1:00:16] same way they did 60 years ago which as
[1:00:19] I was studying this I didn't realize
[1:00:20] that in two days it'll be the 60th
[1:00:23] anniversary of this sermon he preached
[1:00:25] it on August 25th in 1963.
[1:00:29] we fight it the same way that God's
[1:00:32] people have always overcome
[1:00:34] now brother Branham when he when he goes
[1:00:36] into this and takes the scriptures and
[1:00:37] things he begins to bring out some
[1:00:39] points and I don't have time if the
[1:00:41] sermon's about two hours long if you go
[1:00:43] and listen to it do you good to listen
[1:00:45] to it I I know that it would it's just a
[1:00:48] it's just a blessing to help you and
[1:00:50] give you the tools to overcome but I
[1:00:51] just want to draw some things out of
[1:00:53] there tonight if I could and then and
[1:00:55] then we'll let you go home I won't hold
[1:00:56] you too long tonight but the first thing
[1:00:58] that brother Branham begins to address
[1:01:00] and this is by no means all that he
[1:01:02] addresses but he begins to address he
[1:01:04] said you've got to keep life in you
[1:01:06] if you want to overcome keep life in you
[1:01:11] keep the Life of Christ he talks about a
[1:01:14] log in the water and how that that law
[1:01:16] when it's in the water he said I I was
[1:01:18] out walking across the stream and I've
[1:01:20] actually done this where you're walking
[1:01:22] across the stream and you see a log
[1:01:24] that's in the water but you don't want
[1:01:26] to get wet so you step on the log where
[1:01:27] you're going to get wet
[1:01:29] because if it's been in there very long
[1:01:31] it's been cut off from the Life Source
[1:01:33] and so the log is becoming Dody which is
[1:01:37] the word it means it's beginning to
[1:01:38] crumble it's beginning to get old that
[1:01:41] word don't you hear Brother Brown music
[1:01:42] in the token as well it speaks of a
[1:01:45] person as they get older and they begin
[1:01:46] to lose some of their mental faculties
[1:01:48] they begin to lose some of their
[1:01:49] strength and some you know we you may be
[1:01:51] getting older in body but our experience
[1:01:53] with God should never get Doty it should
[1:01:56] never get to a place where we're about
[1:01:58] to well there's just a there's nothing
[1:02:00] worse than a bunch of uh uh Funeral Home
[1:02:03] Christians and and a dead Theology and a
[1:02:06] dead Christianity or a dead message
[1:02:08] religion something that's just it just
[1:02:10] doesn't actually do anything for them it
[1:02:12] has the form of a law but you can't walk
[1:02:14] you it won't do nothing that's no life
[1:02:16] in it God help us from becoming that
[1:02:19] you're not save us from becoming that we
[1:02:21] want to have life even on a Wednesday
[1:02:23] night there's got to be life there
[1:02:24] there's got to be a passion there to
[1:02:27] serve God there's got to be a strength
[1:02:29] there to overcome the enemy
[1:02:31] yeah so he said if you want to overcome
[1:02:33] keep life in you overcome keep life in
[1:02:35] you when life went out he said that's
[1:02:37] what brought that log to that condition
[1:02:39] and it made it worse than ever when it
[1:02:41] laid it in the branch where the water
[1:02:42] was
[1:02:43] that's a sobering thought but going to
[1:02:46] church he said I attend church and I
[1:02:49] want you to attend church I want you to
[1:02:50] be here every service if you can but you
[1:02:52] need to be more than a church attender
[1:02:54] because a church attender without the
[1:02:56] Life of Christ actually rots faster
[1:03:00] than someone who doesn't attend church
[1:03:03] because he says then he said you take a
[1:03:06] Christian that's supposed to be a
[1:03:07] Christian let the life of God go from
[1:03:10] him and the experience the joy of
[1:03:13] serving Christ Living in a church where
[1:03:16] such is going on now watch he's living
[1:03:19] in a church where the presence of God is
[1:03:21] there the spirit of God is there they
[1:03:23] preach the truth
[1:03:25] he's living in a church but he has no
[1:03:27] life
[1:03:27] so instead of the water feeding the tree
[1:03:30] when it was planted by the rivers of
[1:03:32] water the tree pushed shout and
[1:03:34] blossomed and bore fruit but now it's
[1:03:36] laying in the water and because it's
[1:03:37] only laying in the water it has no life
[1:03:39] in it it begins to be destroyed by the
[1:03:42] water itself
[1:03:43] because it takes a religious spirit and
[1:03:46] there's no Spirit harder to break than a
[1:03:48] religious spirit I say God take the
[1:03:50] religious spirit away from us let us be
[1:03:52] real Christians let us be real men and
[1:03:54] women of God there's nothing worse than
[1:03:56] a message more there's nothing worse
[1:03:58] than a than a denominational more no
[1:04:01] matter what kind of more what names on
[1:04:02] the building there's nothing worse than
[1:04:04] some place where the life of God is no
[1:04:06] longer there God help us we would never
[1:04:08] be that
[1:04:10] huh
[1:04:15] you say Well I'm
[1:04:16] I must not have had anything maybe you
[1:04:18] just let the life of God get out of you
[1:04:21] you know it's possible but brother
[1:04:22] Brandon says when you have a certain
[1:04:23] kind of attitude a certain kind of uh
[1:04:25] you do certain things said that you'll
[1:04:27] fly up because he won't leave you we
[1:04:28] flapping the Gable end of your soul
[1:04:31] it's an interesting way to put it isn't
[1:04:33] it
[1:04:33] what happens the influence of the Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost leaves you
[1:04:37] and he leaves you to your own for a
[1:04:39] little bit because if you're a real
[1:04:40] Christian you can't live that way
[1:04:43] you'll come back
[1:04:45] you'll come back
[1:04:47] he said you let the life and live in a
[1:04:49] church such is going on he rottens twice
[1:04:50] as quick right living right under he
[1:04:52] said so if we're trying to follow the
[1:04:53] message of the hour or at least this
[1:04:55] part of the message we should live
[1:04:57] constantly someone say constantly
[1:04:59] constantly in the Life of Christ
[1:05:02] because if you don't you lay around and
[1:05:05] know that these things that you're
[1:05:06] supposed to do and don't do it the Bible
[1:05:08] said he that knows to do good and doeth
[1:05:10] it not to him it's sin then you become
[1:05:12] Doty there's that word again
[1:05:14] Dodie rotten when you're separated from
[1:05:17] the life of God so strive with all
[1:05:19] that's in you to stay in the Life of
[1:05:21] Christ can we do that tonight let's
[1:05:23] strive with all that's in us to stay in
[1:05:25] the life
[1:05:26] that you would be fruit bearing see Paul
[1:05:29] puts it this way he said you're running
[1:05:31] a race he said we're foreseen we also
[1:05:33] are compassed about with so great a
[1:05:34] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:05:36] every weight and the sin which does so
[1:05:39] easily beset us he's talking about
[1:05:41] Christians let us run with patience the
[1:05:44] race that is set before us
[1:05:47] oh aren't you glad he's giving you the
[1:05:48] ability to run
[1:05:50] let's run it with patience stay in the
[1:05:52] race
[1:05:54] save the race
[1:05:55] don't sit down you say well I'm hurting
[1:05:57] don't sit down your muscles are hurt
[1:06:00] your spiritual muscles you'll feel like
[1:06:03] sitting down you'll feel like giving up
[1:06:04] but stay in the race even if you have to
[1:06:06] walk even if you have to shuffle even if
[1:06:09] you if you can't barely put One Foot In
[1:06:11] Front Of Another stay in the race
[1:06:13] if you don't have the joy that you did
[1:06:15] have the peace that you did have you
[1:06:17] said I remember when I got saved what it
[1:06:18] was like brother remember said today so
[1:06:20] you should be closer to God today than
[1:06:22] you ever were God help me to be like
[1:06:24] that
[1:06:25] the peace that you didn't have the Zeal
[1:06:27] that you'd have do something about it
[1:06:30] right don't just accept it
[1:06:33] was just the way I am right now what can
[1:06:35] you do you can do something go back
[1:06:37] where you left it
[1:06:39] how many people have how many times have
[1:06:41] I seen people they begin to get out of
[1:06:43] church and speak mostly it's because
[1:06:45] they decided to put something in front
[1:06:46] of Christ
[1:06:49] something in their life came in front of
[1:06:50] God the word
[1:06:52] and then they backslid
[1:06:54] how do you get back go take care of that
[1:06:57] go start putting God first
[1:06:59] and then you begin to see God move again
[1:07:01] in your life
[1:07:04] church I'm not I'm not hollering at you
[1:07:06] tonight you that are here on a Wednesday
[1:07:07] night during the school year man you're
[1:07:09] you you all are heroes
[1:07:13] but stay in the race
[1:07:15] I'm just encouraging you number two the
[1:07:18] second tool that he gives us and tells
[1:07:20] us of how to overcome get in the ark
[1:07:24] get in the ark he talks about Noah he
[1:07:27] says think hard now if you're laying
[1:07:28] around getting Doty
[1:07:30] get in
[1:07:32] hurry quick because the door might close
[1:07:35] at any time
[1:07:36] and there's always been an ark in God's
[1:07:38] economy there was an ark in the days of
[1:07:40] Noah for the savings of his people it
[1:07:42] was an ark in the days of the law Arc of
[1:07:43] testimony in the days of the law they
[1:07:45] followed the ark and there is a third
[1:07:46] dispensation now like Noah's time lost
[1:07:48] time now this time there's an ark now
[1:07:50] and that Ark is not a denomination
[1:07:52] neither neither is the good works that
[1:07:54] you do it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 we
[1:07:57] were all baptized into one body in the
[1:07:59] domain of that Kingdom one spiritual
[1:08:01] baptism no matter how good how bad
[1:08:03] whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost baptism he said that's the oh he
[1:08:07] said well he didn't preach that after
[1:08:08] the seals this is after the seals
[1:08:11] he said that's the only way you overcome
[1:08:13] it's all that is under the shed blood is
[1:08:16] Overcomers he said you cannot overcome
[1:08:18] yourself it's he that overcome for you
[1:08:20] you're resting what does that mean it
[1:08:23] means you're in the ark get in the ark
[1:08:24] What We should strive to do the Bible
[1:08:28] tells us to strive to enter into rest
[1:08:31] that seems like an oxymoron while I work
[1:08:34] to get into rest what what does that
[1:08:36] mean you know it's the same as if you're
[1:08:38] but I was gonna be talking about
[1:08:39] finances if you're building you know
[1:08:40] what are you doing you're working hard
[1:08:42] now so you don't have to work so hard
[1:08:43] later
[1:08:44] you're striving to enter into rest and
[1:08:46] once you enter into rest then you can
[1:08:48] rest
[1:08:49] but we are resting but we're striving to
[1:08:52] stay there
[1:08:54] are you with me now that's the thing
[1:08:56] just that you can't you can't do it on
[1:08:57] your own he said brother Ben I've tried
[1:08:59] for years to overcome cigarettes I
[1:09:01] understand uh what a horrible Demon I've
[1:09:03] seen people be they'd be able to give up
[1:09:05] drugs they'd be able to give up hard
[1:09:06] drugs they still can't give up
[1:09:07] cigarettes
[1:09:09] it's a hard thing
[1:09:10] but strive to enter in
[1:09:13] you're gonna have to you're gonna have
[1:09:15] to care about it you're gonna have to
[1:09:16] seek God for it because that thing will
[1:09:18] kill you if you keep doing it
[1:09:21] oh
[1:09:22] but how do you overcome you can't do
[1:09:24] that by just mentally thinking well I'm
[1:09:25] going to get rid of these cigarettes I'm
[1:09:26] gonna get rid of these cigarettes no
[1:09:27] strive to enter into the word get close
[1:09:29] to God get so close to God you don't
[1:09:31] want them cigarettes no more get so
[1:09:33] fulfilled with the Holy Ghost until the
[1:09:35] Holy Spirit cleanses you from that thing
[1:09:39] are you with me now
[1:09:43] he said so you can't just do it because
[1:09:45] I'm gonna quit smoking I'm gonna quit
[1:09:46] drinking get in the life
[1:09:48] strive to enter in get in the ark
[1:09:51] he said how how will I know then brother
[1:09:53] Brown that I'm in there isn't this good
[1:09:56] he said watch what kind of a life you're
[1:09:58] living just look around see if it just
[1:10:01] lived out of you automatically or do you
[1:10:03] have to strain and pull you said see
[1:10:05] then you're doing it
[1:10:07] all right but don't try to do it I love
[1:10:09] that you use the example of a baby
[1:10:11] putting on a coat
[1:10:12] all right if we took one of these little
[1:10:14] one-year-olds two-year-olds to find well
[1:10:17] maybe
[1:10:18] maybe she's old enough my little niece
[1:10:20] back there if she's she's probably old
[1:10:21] enough to put on her own coat probably
[1:10:22] wants to but you take one about one year
[1:10:24] old and they try to put on their own
[1:10:26] coat to go out that's frustrating man
[1:10:28] trying to watch that what do you do you
[1:10:30] pick them up brother Brown said you got
[1:10:32] them with gentle hands
[1:10:34] into the coat that's what we want here's
[1:10:37] a coat of the word we need to put it on
[1:10:39] here's the dress that God gave us to be
[1:10:41] dressed in let's Let The Gentle hands of
[1:10:43] Jehovah the holy spirit guide us into
[1:10:46] the arms of that coat
[1:10:48] he said now don't struggle not him that
[1:10:50] willeth or him that runeth but God just
[1:10:53] say God just yield yourself to him and
[1:10:55] walk on with a perfect satisfied faith
[1:10:58] that what God has promised he promised
[1:11:00] he would deliver you from those things
[1:11:02] he is able to perform not joining one
[1:11:05] denomination another denomination
[1:11:06] running this side or the other trying
[1:11:09] this just yield yourself to God walk
[1:11:11] with him peaceful quiet not interrupted
[1:11:14] just keep on walking with him
[1:11:17] hallelujah it's everyday faith
[1:11:19] how could I overcome in 2023 expect to
[1:11:21] be tested
[1:11:24] that's part of overcoming is learning
[1:11:26] that test is coming
[1:11:28] trials are coming you're going to get
[1:11:30] knocked around a little bit people are
[1:11:32] going to disappoint you you're going to
[1:11:34] have disappointing things happen to you
[1:11:35] and many times you're going to be like
[1:11:37] you're going to be like Joseph when he
[1:11:39] went down before he went up
[1:11:41] Harry was headed he knew what his future
[1:11:43] was it's been revealed to him by a dream
[1:11:45] but he had to go into the prison before
[1:11:48] he could go to the king's Palace
[1:11:50] sometimes that's the way we have to go
[1:11:52] we've got to many times God will allow
[1:11:55] something to happen to us and just knock
[1:11:56] us off our feet we say why did he do
[1:11:58] that because he's got something better
[1:12:00] for you that's why we should never get a
[1:12:02] bad an ill temper or upset about
[1:12:04] something that happens or decisions that
[1:12:06] are made Let's just let God sort it out
[1:12:08] it'll be okay it'll be okay well my boss
[1:12:11] they did this out of the other my
[1:12:13] employer did they said it'll be okay
[1:12:15] it's going to be okay why because the
[1:12:17] one that loves you is taking care of you
[1:12:19] is looking out for you if you if you
[1:12:21] don't want you to have that job he'll
[1:12:23] make sure you don't have it
[1:12:25] something better is waiting for you
[1:12:28] right so expect to be tested first Peter
[1:12:31] 4 and 12 beloved take it not strange
[1:12:34] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:12:36] try you as though some strange thing
[1:12:38] happened unto you First Corinthians 10
[1:12:40] 13 there hath no temptation taking you
[1:12:43] but such is this common to man
[1:12:45] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:12:48] you I love this to be tempted above that
[1:12:50] you are able but will with the
[1:12:52] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:12:54] that you may be able to Bear it he
[1:12:57] didn't say make it easy but he said make
[1:12:59] a way to escape if you go back in the
[1:13:01] original there it's the image of of uh
[1:13:04] of a man in the ocean he's been
[1:13:05] Shipwrecked but he's he's swimming and
[1:13:08] he knows if he can swim long enough he
[1:13:10] can see the shore
[1:13:11] there's always a way of Escape amen and
[1:13:14] that is by the Cross of Christ
[1:13:17] he always makes a way of Escape
[1:13:19] and we have to have faith to believe
[1:13:20] that now but the Reynolds that we're
[1:13:21] expecting to be tested either coming to
[1:13:24] God must first be tested tested what
[1:13:25] with the word that's God's test he said
[1:13:28] Do you believe it either coming to God
[1:13:29] must be tested he said that only shows a
[1:13:32] true child then be tested you can't
[1:13:34] overcome unless there's a test given to
[1:13:36] you and when test is given is to see
[1:13:38] whether you can overcome or not and
[1:13:40] Jesus said to him that overcometh the
[1:13:41] test the test is the greatest thing that
[1:13:44] ever happened to you
[1:13:47] it's hard to see why you're in the test
[1:13:49] it's hard to see maybe for some years
[1:13:51] after the death but one day you're going
[1:13:53] to look back and you're going to say by
[1:13:54] the bill the test that I went through
[1:13:55] what's the greatest thing that ever
[1:13:57] happened to me
[1:14:00] amen it's a testing time it's one good
[1:14:03] evidence
[1:14:04] he said if God loved me he wouldn't put
[1:14:06] me through that no the test itself is
[1:14:09] evidence that God is with us
[1:14:11] when we are tested for all children of
[1:14:13] God our tested and tried
[1:14:18] number four I don't have very long so I
[1:14:21] got to hurry through these don't look
[1:14:22] back
[1:14:24] if you want to overcome don't look back
[1:14:27] brother Branham talks about how the
[1:14:28] people left Creeds and dogma's
[1:14:30] denominations to follow the revealed
[1:14:31] truth
[1:14:33] and many of us have left that but I
[1:14:34] think our young people maybe we haven't
[1:14:36] left Creeds and denominations but we
[1:14:38] left we leave behind a life of sin so
[1:14:41] the imagery still works we come out of
[1:14:43] bondage we leave our old life and come
[1:14:46] into Christ
[1:14:47] and maybe your life of sin wasn't as big
[1:14:49] or as fancy as somebody else's but thank
[1:14:52] God for that but you still left the old
[1:14:55] man come to the new man
[1:14:57] right you had something to overcome and
[1:14:59] so
[1:15:00] so but you don't look back
[1:15:02] he said well lot's life did the same
[1:15:03] thing you know she set out to go with
[1:15:05] lot follow her husband her children or
[1:15:07] loved ones
[1:15:08] but it wasn't in her heart now notice
[1:15:10] that's why I followed her husband
[1:15:13] her children her loved ones
[1:15:16] she didn't follow because she believed
[1:15:18] it
[1:15:19] she followed because it was them
[1:15:21] but because she didn't really believe it
[1:15:23] it wasn't in her heart she turned around
[1:15:25] and looked back
[1:15:27] oh my
[1:15:28] she never overcome he said she still
[1:15:30] loved the world she never
[1:15:36] never won big long last look
[1:15:39] that's where she got caught he said
[1:15:41] don't even look back don't have no
[1:15:43] desires keep going could I encourage you
[1:15:45] tonight keep going little bride keep
[1:15:47] going there's a there's a goal out there
[1:15:50] for you to reach
[1:15:51] keep going amen there's something ahead
[1:15:54] of you much better than what you're
[1:15:55] going through right now there's a land
[1:15:57] over there that's much better than this
[1:15:59] land well I'm so glad for that if Paul
[1:16:02] said if in this life only I had
[1:16:04] confidence or peace with God he said I
[1:16:05] am of all men most miserable if this is
[1:16:07] the only life I believed in he said I am
[1:16:09] of all men most miserable but he's
[1:16:11] sitting in a jail cell jailed up but he
[1:16:14] said I have peace and joy because for me
[1:16:16] to live is Christ but to die is gain I'm
[1:16:19] going to a better land I'm going to a
[1:16:22] better place
[1:16:24] you got to get a vision of that and
[1:16:26] believe that
[1:16:27] in order to make it through the trials
[1:16:29] of life
[1:16:30] in order to overcome he said don't even
[1:16:32] look back don't desire to put your mind
[1:16:34] on Calvary keep moving towards Christ
[1:16:36] Paul says that this way in Hebrews 10 39
[1:16:38] we are not of them who draw back into
[1:16:40] perdition
[1:16:41] can somebody say Amen that tonight
[1:16:43] because if we say Amen to that we are
[1:16:45] not of them you put your name there
[1:16:47] Benjamin Pruitt is not of them who draw
[1:16:49] back in the prediction I am not one who
[1:16:52] rejects the message I'm not one who
[1:16:54] makes it almost all the way and then
[1:16:55] leaves at the end I don't care what
[1:16:57] happens between now and then but I'm
[1:16:59] going home why that's where I came from
[1:17:01] I'm going back where I came from I'm not
[1:17:04] going to a strange place I'm going to a
[1:17:07] place where there was a thought of God
[1:17:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:11] thought of God's coming home
[1:17:13] no matter what has to happen in the
[1:17:15] meantime
[1:17:17] are you with me now
[1:17:19] we're not of them that go back but of
[1:17:20] them that believe to the saving of the
[1:17:23] soul but the brown said not he that
[1:17:25] starts he that finishes many start to
[1:17:27] race but there's one finishing him
[1:17:29] there'll be many churches start many
[1:17:31] groups of people but there will be one
[1:17:33] group finished that's the Overcomers
[1:17:37] Hallelujah
[1:17:40] number five be like Reverend Mr Lily
[1:17:43] you remember the story Reverend Mr Lilly
[1:17:46] who was Reverend Mr Lilly you kids you
[1:17:49] kids if you don't know that story go
[1:17:50] listen to how can I overcome brother man
[1:17:52] talks about it Reverend Mr Lilly he said
[1:17:54] it was a lily was was planted in the
[1:17:56] muck
[1:17:57] it's planting the bottom of a pond he
[1:17:59] said they built the Tabernacle there
[1:18:01] over a Lily Pond what had been a Lily
[1:18:03] Pond and he said it down in the middle
[1:18:05] of that and down in that muck that that
[1:18:07] seed sinks all the way down till it
[1:18:09] can't even see the light
[1:18:11] but somehow
[1:18:13] in the spring of the year
[1:18:15] there's just enough warmth
[1:18:19] even though that seed maybe the direct
[1:18:21] light never reaches that sea but it
[1:18:24] warms the dirt around the seed
[1:18:27] Hallelujah and you oh my you've
[1:18:30] experienced that this is the dirt around
[1:18:32] the seed this is the muck and the mud
[1:18:35] and the mire that the seed had to get
[1:18:37] through
[1:18:38] so Reverend Mr Lilly was planted there
[1:18:40] in the in the in the bottom of the pond
[1:18:42] but he comes up through the muck and up
[1:18:44] to the mire and up through the different
[1:18:46] levels of dirt and he comes up and he
[1:18:48] pokes his head up above but he's not
[1:18:50] finished yet
[1:18:51] because he's not going to live in the
[1:18:53] water he's going to live in the presence
[1:18:54] of the Sun
[1:18:56] so he pushes his way up until he gets
[1:18:59] above the water above the mud above the
[1:19:01] muck above the dirt above the stone
[1:19:03] above everything everybody tries to pile
[1:19:05] on it amen he pushes his way up
[1:19:08] why there's a seed there that's going to
[1:19:11] produce what God meant for it to be
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:15] he overcome but the Bible said that's
[1:19:17] the Overcomer he overcome the mud he
[1:19:19] overcome the things of the world and now
[1:19:21] he freely gives himself out everybody
[1:19:23] can look at him his life you can't put a
[1:19:25] finger on it but he didn't start that
[1:19:27] way
[1:19:28] listen Church don't don't get don't get
[1:19:30] nervous don't get upset don't worry he
[1:19:32] said well brother Ben we haven't started
[1:19:34] well I I just got married and we're
[1:19:36] having problems sir we just I'm a young
[1:19:39] person I'm having problems we all did
[1:19:42] huh all of us did some of us that didn't
[1:19:46] well you said well I didn't have any
[1:19:47] problems well they'll come later
[1:19:51] they just haven't pushed yourself up to
[1:19:53] the muck yet there's going to be
[1:19:54] problems in life there's going to be
[1:19:56] things you have to overcome but you
[1:19:57] overcome if you have overcome great
[1:19:59] things you've overcome great difficulty
[1:20:01] but you but you get to a place where you
[1:20:04] can look at their life you say you can't
[1:20:05] put a finger on it but Danny Ward wasn't
[1:20:07] always Danny Ward
[1:20:09] right Mark Crowder wasn't always Mark
[1:20:10] Crowder you you men and women that are
[1:20:13] sitting here tonight you weren't always
[1:20:14] sister Patty wasn't always sister Patty
[1:20:16] you had you were something else at some
[1:20:18] point but God had to make you what you
[1:20:19] are
[1:20:21] Amen in order to be a giver in order to
[1:20:23] be somebody who's a help to the church
[1:20:25] in order to be somebody who's a who's a
[1:20:27] a net positive to the body of Christ
[1:20:31] there had to be many setbacks
[1:20:34] but you pushing your way up
[1:20:36] he said he's a real Overcomer you can't
[1:20:38] say nothing about him now
[1:20:41] huh
[1:20:43] so you come out of the mud but he's not
[1:20:44] in the mud now
[1:20:47] Lord God oh I love it he come out of the
[1:20:51] mud he's not in the mud now he's on top
[1:20:53] of it
[1:20:55] Hallelujah you can't then point back to
[1:20:57] what he was
[1:20:58] what is he now he's on top then the bee
[1:21:02] comes by and said that's wonderful
[1:21:03] perfume I believe I'll go and get my
[1:21:05] part he just opens up his heart says
[1:21:07] come on now Hallelujah
[1:21:10] all right everything takes from him see
[1:21:12] he's a he's a real Pastor I love this he
[1:21:15] expresses the glory of God if he calls
[1:21:17] him Reverend Mr Lily he expresses the
[1:21:20] glory of God look where he come from he
[1:21:22] had to overcome to do that one time
[1:21:25] now watch what some of us have to
[1:21:27] overcome
[1:21:28] some of us
[1:21:29] one time he or she was young and fair
[1:21:31] and beautiful
[1:21:33] one time
[1:21:36] but brother Harvey I have overcome that
[1:21:44] all of us
[1:21:45] all of us trying to get back what we
[1:21:47] were I am too
[1:21:48] it alarms me I'm trying to lose weight
[1:21:50] you know and I was trying to get back
[1:21:52] where we were but one time
[1:21:54] see he or she was young and fair and
[1:21:55] beautiful they had a lot of Temptations
[1:21:57] to go through but they overcome that
[1:22:01] I love that they overcome now they're
[1:22:04] maybe not so young and fair and
[1:22:06] beautiful but they're steady
[1:22:09] they're solid more ways than just one
[1:22:13] you ain't gonna move them
[1:22:16] it's steadfast Paul says unmovable why
[1:22:18] they come up through the mud but they
[1:22:20] got on top of it amen they've been
[1:22:22] through trials and battles but they
[1:22:24] didn't stay there
[1:22:26] come up that's the key overcoming
[1:22:28] depression anxiety all those things that
[1:22:30] we all those things God's doing
[1:22:32] something in your life
[1:22:33] just climb over it yeah maybe maybe feel
[1:22:36] like swimming in mud ask a preacher the
[1:22:38] other night what was I was preaching
[1:22:40] liking he said it was like walking
[1:22:41] through mud
[1:22:43] I said well you know it's hard when you
[1:22:45] don't get any amens
[1:22:46] but I'm glad we have an amen in church
[1:22:48] I'm glad I'm not talking about y'all but
[1:22:51] but you know that's what it's like
[1:22:52] sometimes when you get depressed and you
[1:22:54] get down and you begin to get anxiety
[1:22:55] it's like walking through mud but keep
[1:22:57] putting your feet between One Foot In
[1:22:59] Front Of Another because you're called
[1:23:00] to overcome that you're gonna be on top
[1:23:02] one of these days and if you realize
[1:23:04] that it won't take you under
[1:23:09] how can I overcome be like Reverend Mr
[1:23:11] Lily
[1:23:13] oh
[1:23:17] we overcome he said Reverend Mr Billy
[1:23:20] overcome through humility by humility so
[1:23:22] to Jesus
[1:23:23] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:23:25] in Christ Jesus he overcome the mud the
[1:23:28] flesh
[1:23:29] see the seed of God
[1:23:30] I love the fact that God amorphed
[1:23:34] himself into a seed brother Brown said
[1:23:37] all that God was become a seed
[1:23:40] foreign an embryo we could say it like
[1:23:43] that in the womb of of Mary
[1:23:47] he poured himself into Christ
[1:23:50] and in doing that he took on mud
[1:23:56] oh it's hard to hear about Jesus but
[1:23:58] it's true
[1:23:59] yes sir that's why he could have
[1:24:00] headaches
[1:24:01] that's why he could be tempted he took
[1:24:03] on a flesh body
[1:24:06] flesh like our flesh
[1:24:08] only he did no sin
[1:24:12] I got to preach on that one day the
[1:24:14] difference what's the difference because
[1:24:16] there's sin in there's original sin that
[1:24:18] he he did no sin but he wasn't tied to
[1:24:20] the original sin he was virgin born so
[1:24:22] that he could overcome so we can
[1:24:24] overcome
[1:24:26] so by living in the Life of Christ what
[1:24:28] are you doing you're overcoming your
[1:24:30] first birth
[1:24:32] he was in the form of God and thought it
[1:24:35] not Robert to be equal with God but made
[1:24:36] himself with no reputation took upon him
[1:24:38] the form of a servant was made in the
[1:24:40] likeness of men that men is flesh being
[1:24:44] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[1:24:47] himself
[1:24:48] became obedient unto death even the
[1:24:50] death of the Cross that's random deals
[1:24:52] with that a lot more but that's the way
[1:24:53] to overcome is by humility
[1:24:56] number six recognize the devil in every
[1:24:58] one of his tricks
[1:24:59] right that's how brother random defines
[1:25:01] overcoming he said his overcoming is
[1:25:03] recognizing the devil and every one of
[1:25:05] his tricks
[1:25:06] a lot of people says there is no devil
[1:25:08] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:25:09] that there's a real devil just as real
[1:25:11] as you are anybody real devil you must
[1:25:13] recognize him real you must know he's
[1:25:14] the devil then at the same time you
[1:25:16] recognize him and know that he's the
[1:25:17] Devil he's against you and to overcome
[1:25:20] you must recognize that the god in you
[1:25:21] is greater and mightier than he is
[1:25:23] that's what David recognizes Goliath
[1:25:27] right and and that's the one that's in
[1:25:28] you has already overcome him and by his
[1:25:31] grace you are more than a match for him
[1:25:32] you look back and say I'm doing this and
[1:25:34] I'm doing that he said then no you're
[1:25:36] defeated but there's no condemnation to
[1:25:38] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:25:40] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:25:41] he said then you realize that you've
[1:25:43] overcome he said and you know that he's
[1:25:45] the devil you can't say I got a sickness
[1:25:47] I don't believe it is a sickness oh yes
[1:25:48] it is a sickness you've got cancer you
[1:25:50] don't believe it's cancer it is cancer
[1:25:51] he said but remember greater is he
[1:25:54] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:25:57] world you must realize that the Holy
[1:25:59] Spirit that's in you has already
[1:26:00] overcome this thing and he's in you and
[1:26:03] you can overcome by him you see the
[1:26:05] weakest light overpowers the greatest
[1:26:07] Darkness I could turn all the lights out
[1:26:10] in this room and I could have one little
[1:26:12] flashlight or the light off of my iPad
[1:26:14] or my phone and I can shine and you can
[1:26:16] see it because the weakest light
[1:26:18] overpowers the greatest Darkness you
[1:26:20] know what happens with Darkness we ever
[1:26:23] thought about that what happens to the
[1:26:24] darkness light literally
[1:26:27] wallows up
[1:26:28] Darkness
[1:26:30] do you know that scientifically light
[1:26:32] swallows up light particles Hallelujah
[1:26:35] swallow up the darkness the darkness
[1:26:37] doesn't have to do anything to be there
[1:26:39] it's just there
[1:26:40] you realize that Darkness you don't have
[1:26:42] to create Darkness
[1:26:43] turn off all the lights and that's what
[1:26:45] you get
[1:26:46] right no nobody could create oh my
[1:26:48] darkness is just the absence of light
[1:26:51] but what the light does is it literally
[1:26:53] the light particles swallow up the
[1:26:55] darkness death is swallowed up in
[1:26:57] Victory
[1:27:00] that's the one that's in you it's life
[1:27:02] and the one that's in the world is
[1:27:03] Darkness so the light has proved to
[1:27:05] overcome the darkness and the man that's
[1:27:07] in Christ and knows that he's overcome
[1:27:08] the things of the world it has no more
[1:27:10] ties to you at all you're free walk in
[1:27:12] the light as he is in the light and the
[1:27:14] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:27:15] all sin we have Fellowship one with
[1:27:17] another do you believe that tonight
[1:27:19] remember seven this is the last one
[1:27:20] don't listen to The Devil's proposition
[1:27:24] very good Satan's always going to be
[1:27:26] giving you ideas
[1:27:28] you know that that's why we don't that's
[1:27:30] why we don't preach everything comes in
[1:27:31] our minds
[1:27:32] let me back it up with the word
[1:27:35] because everything that comes in your
[1:27:36] mind that's why if you're going to not
[1:27:38] use notes you better be really in the
[1:27:41] spirit
[1:27:43] all right you can do that I've seen
[1:27:45] preachers do that wonderfully without
[1:27:46] any notes at all just the spirit of the
[1:27:49] Lord catch them just like that and I've
[1:27:50] also seen people that get in the flesh
[1:27:53] just start hammering people because they
[1:27:55] didn't have any Direction they didn't
[1:27:57] study
[1:27:58] his brother Andrew said you said you
[1:27:59] didn't study and they said we can tell
[1:28:02] huh
[1:28:03] but now
[1:28:05] but we study I appreciate these young
[1:28:07] men doing that taking time when they're
[1:28:09] working and things I know how hard that
[1:28:10] is I did it for many years
[1:28:12] and but
[1:28:15] but Satan's got a proposition for you if
[1:28:17] he can give it to the preacher he will
[1:28:18] if you can give it to you he will
[1:28:19] sometimes Satan can take you when you
[1:28:21] think you're doing the will of God can
[1:28:22] make you a proposition you'll fall for
[1:28:23] it
[1:28:24] he said let's take for instance like our
[1:28:26] sisters they're pretty he can get you to
[1:28:27] a place if you let your hair grow out
[1:28:28] you didn't realize it looked so nice on
[1:28:30] you and the first thing you know you get
[1:28:32] kind of feeling a little stuck up a
[1:28:34] little above something else
[1:28:37] he said some of you men you know what I
[1:28:39] mean well not me because I've never been
[1:28:41] proud of my hair
[1:28:47] maybe we get proud of something else for
[1:28:48] the bill
[1:28:51] get a little money a little prestige a
[1:28:53] little standing
[1:28:55] we get lifted up with the brown said a
[1:28:58] pastor get lifted up by the people until
[1:28:59] he thinks he can do anything get by with
[1:29:01] it
[1:29:02] God help us today
[1:29:04] he said he can take the same thing he
[1:29:06] said you get kind of feeling stuck up he
[1:29:08] can some of you men he said you take
[1:29:09] that same thing and proposition it with
[1:29:11] you I tried he said you've got to
[1:29:13] overcome that right just remember you're
[1:29:15] living for God you have one objective
[1:29:17] and that's Jesus Christ outside of that
[1:29:19] there's nothing else counts that's him
[1:29:21] he said then secondly for your family
[1:29:22] thirdly for yourself
[1:29:24] first for God
[1:29:26] next your family and next for you so
[1:29:30] anytime you make a decision say first
[1:29:32] for God
[1:29:34] next for your family third for you
[1:29:37] I tell you when you become a help to the
[1:29:39] churches when you start putting your
[1:29:40] church family in with your family
[1:29:45] that's when you really become a help
[1:29:46] to the body
[1:29:48] thirdly for yourself
[1:29:49] first for God then your family next for
[1:29:51] you your number three that's the end of
[1:29:52] the road put yourself last he did
[1:29:56] amen I'm glad he did
[1:29:58] we got we'll take these things seriously
[1:30:02] let's be rugged Christians
[1:30:04] and fight to live in this land where all
[1:30:06] the promises like musicians go ahead and
[1:30:07] come I
[1:30:10] a little bit over my time
[1:30:12] one minute brother Joe one minute
[1:30:18] a soldier is not confident in his
[1:30:19] weapons
[1:30:21] his weapons will fail
[1:30:23] he's not confident in them if he's not
[1:30:26] confident in his support he'll hesitate
[1:30:28] you know that they say the biggest thing
[1:30:30] biggest reason soldiers get killed in
[1:30:32] armies that are not well trained is
[1:30:35] because they hesitate
[1:30:36] because many times they're hidden right
[1:30:39] and if you're carrying a bazooka I don't
[1:30:41] know what shoulder you carry a bazooka
[1:30:43] on but if you're carrying a bazooka and
[1:30:45] you've got a bazooka probably the other
[1:30:46] one you get a bazooka out there and you
[1:30:48] got it trained on an enemy tank
[1:30:50] but now two things are going to happen
[1:30:51] like you can take out the tank
[1:30:54] but if you do your position is exposed
[1:30:57] right so in order to take out the tank
[1:30:59] to do what you what you've been trained
[1:31:02] to do you've got to expose yourself so
[1:31:04] you've got to have confidence in the
[1:31:05] people behind you and the ones standing
[1:31:07] with you you're not going to do it and
[1:31:09] that's the way many people are with
[1:31:10] overcoming they hesitate that's why
[1:31:13] well-trained armies just a few
[1:31:14] well-trained men can overcome many many
[1:31:16] hundreds of of people that are not well
[1:31:18] trained because they hesitate
[1:31:20] they don't want to get shot I mean if we
[1:31:23] fail to overcome because we think well
[1:31:25] if I attack that I don't have the
[1:31:27] ability or the strength to overcome it
[1:31:29] if it comes back at me
[1:31:31] but don't you realize who's on your side
[1:31:33] don't you realize those angels are
[1:31:35] encamped around about you don't you
[1:31:37] realize the Holy Ghost is inside of you
[1:31:39] don't you realize that the church is
[1:31:41] behind you the people of God all of
[1:31:43] Heaven is behind you you're an overcomer
[1:31:46] all that are in Christ are Overcomers
[1:31:49] oh my we are Overcomers in this age what
[1:31:52] was it the Old Testament Saints raised
[1:31:54] with him brother said and the New
[1:31:55] Testament Saints are risen with him
[1:31:58] they raised with improving they were
[1:32:00] Overcomers we are raised with him from
[1:32:02] dead trespassers and sins proving that
[1:32:04] we are Overcomers you're an overcomer
[1:32:06] it's time we begin to act like it pick
[1:32:08] up our bazooka and start taking out some
[1:32:10] enemy tanks
[1:32:12] take out doubt take out unbelief take
[1:32:15] out all of them whatever you've been
[1:32:16] struggling with to overcome take it out
[1:32:18] get rid of it deal with it
[1:32:22] relationship don't have to continue to
[1:32:24] be like that that that that ungodliness
[1:32:27] doesn't have to be there
[1:32:29] deal with it
[1:32:30] Let It Go
[1:32:32] Isaac Watts wrote this and I'll let Alan
[1:32:35] sing but he said must I be carried to
[1:32:37] the skies on flowery beds of ease While
[1:32:39] others fought to win the prize and sail

[1:32:43] I would Reign increase my courage Lord
[1:32:46] I'll bear the toil endure the pain
[1:32:48] supported by Thy word there's some
[1:32:50] lesser known verses he said thy Saints
[1:32:51] in all this glorious War shall conquer
[1:32:54] though they die they see the Triumph
[1:32:56] from afar by face Discerning Eye when
[1:32:59] that illustrious day shall rise and all
[1:33:01] thy armies shine in Robes of Victory

[1:33:06] thine do you believe that today amen God
[1:33:09] bless you tonight brother Alan just come
[1:33:11] and lead us in in a little bit of
[1:33:12] worship before we go do you love him I

[1:33:15] Wednesday night but don't you want to be
[1:33:17] an overcomer amen God bless you tonight
