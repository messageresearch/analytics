bless you this evening turn with me to Galatians chapter 5 and verse 1 Galatians 5 and 1. read down through verse 6. it's good to be in the house of the Lord on a Sunday afternoon I know it's a little bit of a hard time of year with all the sickness and things and then with hunting season going on that's like a national holiday around here so we have to kind of we I think marriages even stop around here for hunting season but not ours we I I just fish so I'm too spiritual to hunt so brother Branham never said to you you know that you time wasn't watered to you when you were hunting he said timeless time was a lot of doing you were fishing so that's my Doctrine I'm gonna stick with it but we're glad to have all the hunters I'll take all the free deer meat that I can get I'll tell you that right now but we're gonna hunt out the word tonight this afternoon and just look into the word a little bit isn't the word always good you know you just open up your Bible and find something that that would be good just anything anywhere you'd read in it but let's read from Galatians chapter five and verse one Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty we're with Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage so you are free so he said Stand Fast in that freedom yes and make sure you remain free be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing so if after having been free you voluntarily Place yourself back under the law Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law Christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law you are fallen from Grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love I pray the Lord of that is blessing to the word you may be seated I'm holding this mic to try to get a little bit more volume tonight I don't have much voice but we're going to try to preach anyway and I want to talk to you tonight about choosing Grace yes choosing Grace we know that when we were saved we didn't choose Grace chose us right I wasn't looking for Grace it would be an oxymoron to choose Grace in that sense because Grace is unmerited favor you didn't do nothing for it you couldn't work your way into it you couldn't you couldn't tell yourself about the message of the hour you you couldn't put yourself in your family you couldn't you couldn't uh you couldn't give yourself conviction you couldn't there's nothing you could do to Merit the grace that you've been given he chose you out of a bar room or off of a church pew or off the street how many you say Amen to that this afternoon he chose me it was his unmerited favor just like he did the disciples in John chapter 15 he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you that's pretty straightforward isn't it he said it ordains you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain so he said I've chosen you and I've chosen you for the purpose that your fruit was going to remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so we find then that the Bible tells us that the children of Israel are God's chosen people if you ever notice it never says that God was there he was their chosen God right they never chose him as their God but he chose them as his people aren't you glad for that the Romans chose gods the Greeks chose Gods the Egyptians chose God yes but he but the Israelites never chose a God right God chose them God come down to Abraham and he said you're mine you belong to me and that's what he wants to do to each and every one of us yes excuse me he wants to come down and say you belong to me and I believe that's what he's done that's how he chose us so he come down and he chose us and so uh we we don't have a god of our choice we don't have a worship of our choice we don't get to choose how we worship her or who we worship but we worship according to the scripture because that's God's word and it's the grace that's revealed to us right and we found the children of Israel were the same way they come out about three months they left Egypt and they come to the Red Sea and the bitter Waters and they finally come down to Sinai Mount Sinai and I want to look at that this afternoon for just a moment in Exodus 19 and 1. because many times when you're chosen by God then you have to choose to remain a free people because the opportunity will be there to place yourself under a system of works to try to bring you back into a a religion of your own making and so we we need to be careful that we don't do that in the message of the hour but that we we remain a free people that we don't go back into a religion of works because we were chosen by God and and so after we are chosen by Grace we need to choose Grace we need to continue in Grace so he said don't be uh don't be entrapped again in the Yoke of bondage Exodus chapter 19 and verse 1 it says in the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day they came into the Wilderness of Sinai but they were departed from refuen or come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and their Israel Camp before the mount and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called into him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you've seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you to to myself well what a wonderful story of Grace he said now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests a holy nation he said these are the words which I shall speak into the children of Israel notice it was all positive if it was all I've chosen you I've brought you out it was all about what he did yeah right but now they're wanting but the herald to turn it around because they they could not they were overwhelmed so much by what he did but they couldn't respond in a way that they wanted to and they actually turned it into a legal thing so it seems like it's a great time when God's telling them look this is what I've done for you but brother Branham tells us that it's in this 19th Chapter of Exodus actually that the Israelites chose law instead of Grace they weren't happy with how they've been let out they weren't happy with the way that he brought them out yes he brought them out on the Eagle's Wings he brought them out without a man had nothing to do with it God did it all by himself right but they said we want something more we want a religion we want something we can something that'll tell us what to do and where to go and and when to have church and all of these other things but God brought them out by grace and he wanted them to stay that way yes right amen that's a great brother said was the greatest mistake that Israel ever made they said to Moses finally in Exodus 2019 20 Exodus chapter 20 verse 19 they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we were here but let not God speak with us lest we die yeah so we want we want to we want you to we we want to hear from you and not from God so they set up an intermediary Branham said that's when they chose law instead of Grace he said the greatest mistake that Israel ever made was it Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had already provided a savior it had already provided to deliver it had already provided an atonement to shed blood and Israel said don't let God speak let Moses speak they wanted to law our Commandments or something they could do themselves he said you see the nature of man trying to find something to do himself towards Merit salvation yes again brother Branham tells us that the law was given to Israel because they required it can you imagine that yeah now think about it these people were traitors yeah right they were great trades people they they were people who who uh would uh would make money off just about anything but they made some pretty bad swaps yeah think about it they traded Grace they had free Grace and they traded it for law voluntarily they choose law when they were chosen by grace and so now brother Brandon said Grace had provided the lamb provided a savior and they said give us something to do they required it they actually said we want a system we want some way that we can serve God because they just couldn't see themselves serving him just by grace and I think we've got to be careful with that brother said listen Christians yeah the areas where you'll make your fatal mistake yeah there's where Israel made her fatal mistake when she asked for a law to serve God by they actually chose judgment over Mercy notice what they chose in Exodus 19 16 are you still with me this afternoon I don't want to put you to sleep Exodus I you can tell I'm struggling through this do you just bear with me Exodus 19 16 it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings in a thick cloud and the voice of the trumpet exceeding louds all the people that were in the camp trembled brother Brown tells us that was judgment yeah yeah it marched out there and God given them Grace to travel by but they demanded a law now now watch where brother Brandon takes this he said God wanted them to be inner denomination but they wanted to make a denomination out of it got to watch what you asked for right right said something they could argue about instead of just following God and living under his jurisdiction under his power they wanted something to argue about right Grace had provided a prophet can we say Amen to that today yes Grayson provided an atonement of lamb Grace had provided all these things yet they wanted judgment they wanted something they could do yes God said assemble them together I'll let them know what it is I'll show them what it is he said read listen and the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder until it shook the Earth he said you see what judgment is I don't want that how many can say Amen to that tonight I don't want his judgment and that's when they said don't let God speak let Moses speak right they couldn't stand under his judgment because they chose that instead of Grace he said I don't want that give me mercy you've got to come to a time where you choose Grace you choose Grace for yourself and you choose Grace for other people yes you got to come to a time where you get to the point where you just quit criticizing people right I said Lord if you found me you can find them yeah if you was good enough that you found me if Grace could find me Grace can find my children Grace can find other people in the church I don't have to I don't have to live their lives for right I don't have to set up a denomination and sit around and criticize everybody that's not what it's about I want Grace I want to choose Grace amen and Moses in Exodus 19 17 brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mountain and mount Sinai was all together on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in Fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of the furnace and the whole Mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by voice the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai on the top of the mountain the Lord Called Moses up to the top of the mountain Moses went up and the Lord said unto Moses go down charge the people let's say breakthrough into the Lord to gaze and many of them perish he comes back down with the Ten Commandments we look at that today and that's a wonderful thing yes but it was after it rejected Grace that they got Commandments yes Brandon said was the most fatal mistake that Israel ever made was Exodus 19. the grace had provided them all these things had given the Revival they still required a law right though they could have schools theological trained ministers and be just like the rest of the people he said something they could fuss about something they could separate one another break up a fellowship or Brotherhood yes we believe this and we believe that he said if they just let it go on the way God had it going it would have been all right we could say Amen to that right there yes if we just let this message go on the way God has it going we'd be all right but when we try to put our ideas in yeah yeah he said when we inject our ideas when we inject our theology into God's spirit it takes God's spirit away that's a profound statement right there when we inject our theology into God's spirit it takes God's Spirits away how many times have you have I seen God working something out in someone's life can I just talk to you for a minute I've seen God do that he's working it out for the person and yet they inject their theology or their way of thinking into that Grace yeah yeah and he and the spirit of God's just working it out yeah but they can't accept that because of the way they were raised or or something that's happened in their life and they have a Theology and they've got to make it fit that theology just like God do what he does let him heal you yeah yeah let him save you let him take care of you he wants to do it let me believe that tonight he wants to take care of you he wants to let you live like children before the father he wants to work in your life he wants to move in your life but many times we won't let him because we have a preconceived idea of how we want him to work or if you're going to work you've got to present it this way you've got to come through this preacher it's got to do it this way no just let him work just let him do it yeah don't fuss with him don't inject your own theology into let him heal you yes take over your life when we inject our theology into God's spirit it takes God's spirit away he said that's the way it was in that day they were on the road but they wanted something they could do themselves through their fussing they sort of tell us something yeah through their fussing and through their carrying on they found out then that they drove the spirit of God away from them yes it was a great mistake oh my what happens when we fuss the dove takes its flight right and that's our Mercy we want the mercy of God we have the mechanics we want the Dynamics to come down on that right because if we don't if we only have the mechanics we only have the law the dove takes his fight they wanted to have something they could do themselves some Sabbath days they could keep or some ordinances they could do or something another that was brought into them that they could do themselves he said and if you can't do one thing to save yourself he said then there's not one Speck of it Grace yeah if you can do one thing to save yourself there's not one Speck of it Grace law is what you do in regards to the grace that God has showed you by Saving you as I've often said I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me I don't run around with other women because I love my wife that's it I don't believe you should run around he said but the law isn't what keeps it it's like I told the couple yesterday I I told him I said you marriage license isn't going to keep you married that's just a legal document I won't keep you married if it's not built on a foundation of love there's nothing there right there's nothing there to hold you and that's the same way with our Christian walk he said it's the reason I love God he said not because I'm afraid he'd send me to hell I don't believe he'd do that but because I love him so much I don't want to do it yes there's nothing in me to make me do it I love him too much I wouldn't hurt him for nothing right right certainly I love it he said when men and women get to a place well I really ought to stay at home and see this good play tonight but I'll tell you they'll think I'm back said if I don't go on down to church well how many times we've not come to or we've come to church well they'll think I'm back said if I don't go he said you sit there and sleep anyhow you might as well stayed home looked at something you'd enjoy more he said but when your joy becomes the Lord yeah and the Lord is your joy you can't stay away from church then you're getting somewhere yeah brother random always takes it back when he talks about the church choosing law for Grace he said that's what Pentecost did we talked about it this morning how they come up to the borderline then they pulled back and he said Pentecost of 1906 they that Pentecostal Revival they they come up but they wouldn't they wouldn't go all the way they chose law instead of Grace and he said that church was in better shape 40 years ago for the coming of the Lord Jesus and it is tonight now we're not talking about that tonight or today because if we're not in better shape today than we were 40 years ago something's wrong right but we believe we're we believe the message of the hour and we're going up we're not going down but this was the Pentecostal Church he said they were in better shape 40 years ago than it is tonight he said they were closer to God they had more God among them and more Spirit among them than they got tonight what did it because he said because we separated ourself each little group to itself going out there and telling the other one well that's all Buzzard Roost over there this is that there they haven't got it we got it I wonder how many times we get the same attitude yeah we got another message around here we can have that attitude about one another you said in your little differences of doctrines and so forth and God wouldn't pay that much attention to it he said if we haven't got love what good does it do anyhow that's right you love the word this afternoon yes he said the church now is like Israel the church is like Israel when you come up out of Egypt Israel was down there in Egypt God by His Marvelous Grace without any organization or anything else he called Israel to his health he called them to their inheritance Grace furnish him a prophet Grace give them a pillar of fire Grace give them a lamb a sacrificial lamb Grace give them power Grace give them Deliverance Grace give them Victory Grace give them all these things and they danced in the spirit and shouted and praised God about it and little did they know when they were dancing on the banks of the Jordan or the Dead Sea that they were 40 years away from the land he said there was only about five days away but they made their rash mistake in Exodus the 19th Chapter when they accepted law instead of Grace where they turned down God's way away for themselves give us something to do he said that's been man's idea all along yes and he said they had Grace they had a prophet they had a sacrificial lamb they had Redemption they had been brought to the Red Sea they had been healed of their diseases and water from a smitten rock that man out of Heaven everything they had need of had been supplied and still they wanted something else he said now that's the perfect type of our Ephesians today exactly he said we come out under Luther we went through sanctification under methodists come into the restoration under Pentecost exactly like it was the Wilderness journey and when God brought us out we did very well but what did we do he said we wanted to be like the rest of them right now we find out that Grace is the only thing that takes us through never long right amen listen Hebrews 12 18 says you're not coming to the mount that might be touched it burned with a fire torn to Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore but they could not endure that which was commanded so much as a b to be with us through with the dark they couldn't endure what was commanded and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you're coming to Mount Zion listen to the different picture that he paints to them he says to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem aren't you glad you come to a different place this afternoon to an innumerable company of angels well that ought to make a shout this afternoon but the random says you can see past the veil of Flesh you'd see Angels at their position and every pew he said an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to God the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant the blood of sprinkling this speaketh better things than that of Abel what is it this is Grace choose Grace don't go back to the Yoke of bondage yes yes don't go back to denominationalism don't go back to trying to make it work yourself right don't go back to saying well if you're not part of our group you're not part of it right you know long in the message don't go back to that yes and I see so much of that today see Hebrews 12 25 said don't refuse him that speaks yeah see that you refuse not him to speak it for if they escape not who refuse him to spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying it once more I shake mouth the Earth only but also heaven we've been brought out of Egypt the world given the Holy Ghost placed in the Church of the firstborn seated in Heavenly places in Christ we find ourselves in the land today we've had a prophet we were exactly where where the Israelites where we find ourselves where the Galatians were as well yeah and yet Paul spoke to the Galatians in Galatians 1 6 he said I Marvel that you're so soon removed from him that hath called you into the grace of Christ into another gospel which is not another but there'll be some that trouble even would pervert the gospel of Christ yeah but we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed why would we go back under bondage yes yes why would we go back under a man's leadership when the Holy Ghost let us out yes why would we go back under do's and don'ts and the laws of legalism when when God brought us out into Grace and it's Grace that makes us want to live for God hey man why would we go back yes Paul goes on to tell his story to the Galatians how the church had agreed not to add the burdens of the law to Gentile believers he goes on to talk about Sarah and Hagar he typed Sarah as a free woman and Hagar is a Bond woman you said the seed can't be air with the shut the seed of the free woman on the air with the seed of the bondwoman but the Branham took that and he preached he said the hawk can't fly with the Eagles right he said he's just trying to impersonate an eagle don't try to go back don't try to put law with it just just let God be God listen he said it must have been difficult for Abraham to let Ishmael go but he would have marred Isaac's inheritance there's got to be there can't be any alliance between the free and the bound let them go start their clicks and denominations we'll stay with the word you say Amen to that tonight amen we don't want to add anything to Faith yes we've been chosen by Grace Let's Stay Free let's stay Freedom that's my whole thought tonight and I know I'm getting it across poorly but let's stay free yeah let's not go back into the things of the world let's not go back into the bondage of denominationalism let's not go back into the bondage of a man we've had enough of that let's stay free yes he said oh foolish Galatians who have to be with you that you should not obey the truth but for whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you that's only what I learned of you received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or the hearing of Faith he said how did you get the Holy Ghost did it come by grace did it come by faith or did it come by works he said are you so foolish haven't begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh you say well you know they were trying to tell the Galatians said well if you eat meat you'll be lost if you aren't circumcised you'll be lost he said that's not what saved you that's right meat didn't save you circumcision didn't save you and said in fact if you if you get circumcised now for the purpose of Salvation he said you actually deny Christ yeah now today we hear the same thing if you don't go to my church you're lost right if you don't believe a certain Doctrine you're lost it's nonsense if you have a Christmas tree you're lost if you're seeing a certain type of songs in your church you're lost it's nonsense yeah as I told you last Sunday night you don't you can't go from being bride to being lost yeah right that's not how that works true if you love God you'll do the works of God you can't be lost but you just follow God you follow the word not what some man adds to it we don't want to go back under legalism Abraham received a seal of circumcision as a sign of his faith yeah and today when we believe God with all of our heart and accept his son the Lord Jesus and God recognizes that faith is true in him then he sends them back down the Holy Spirit of promise and steals us until the day of our Redemption brother Brandon said my that takes all the scare out of it there's no negative thoughts yes listen to this now unless we close there's no negative thoughts at all in Christianity that's right that's a powerful statement right no negative thoughts at all in Christianity everything is past tense it's already finished hey man I wonder if the musicians would come tonight we'll sing that it's already done it's already finished it's taken care of all right amen I read a story about an Indian man that he couldn't understand the difference between law and Grace and and they were kind of fussing about it and had a little counsel and but he had been brought out to this Council of theologians and and on the way there they'd written on a train and he said he said you know he said I think I can explain the difference between law and Grace they said well what is it he said well he said you know when I got on the train he said back then they had chewing tobacco and they'd spin it he said they had a sign up on the beautiful train station had a sign up and said no spitting he said but everywhere I looked around that sign people spit around the sign he said I didn't understand it why would they want to spit at that beautiful train station he said but you know what I did he said I found myself doing the same thing he said that the sign didn't stop me everybody else was doing that might as well do it too he said but I went in a really nice home he said everything was beautiful and he said I've never been in a home like that he said they had beautiful Furniture he said they didn't have no signs up nothing they said don't spit he said but I could tell they took care of the home they loved the home the Indian man sat there and he said you know he said it never even occurred to me to spit he said because I could tell they loved their home there was love there they cared about it somebody would care about it well that's the difference in law and Grace we don't have to put up a sign no spitting on the floor no we wouldn't do that we don't want to do that because we care about this home we care about this house that we live in we care about this Tabernacle because God cares about He Loves Us hey man that's the difference in law and Grace you put up all the signs you want to you'll still you'll still pass it but there's no Scare at
