Lord saying that it was good to be in your presence tonight I pray be with us now we ask in Jesus name amen and how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen I I I had this little thought on my heart today and I hope we can get through it I don't have much time I I put myself on a timer and I'm going to stick to it it's Wednesday night I think uh school's back in and and I'll I'll get you out of here in a good time tonight got just a little rebound brother Gabe you can turn me down these hotpots just a little if you want to or in the monitor just a little bit amen amen are you happy to be in church tonight amen if you got your bibles if you could turn to Mark chapter 9 and uh we'll start with verse 17 Mark 9 and verse 17 and there's I've got a several couple scriptures here to read so I'll try to get right through it here tonight Mark chapter 9:17 says and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teth him him and he foth and naseth with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to the disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he answered him and said oh faithless generation how long shall shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him brought unto him brought him unto him and when he saw him straight way the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it a go since this came unto him and he said of a child and often times it casteth him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us that's the way we have to come to Jesus isn't it and Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straight way the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief that that portion of scripture has always got me just a little bit I believe but help thou mine unbelief and in James chapter 2 and ver14 James 2:14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word I was reading that scripture and and I was I was listening to a tape and I may have stolen my title from a message brother Brandon preached in 19 55 I believe it was faith in action and if you listen to that sermon brother brandham just I mean he just preaches his heart out and uh just really gets after it and preaches and and at the end he has a prayer line and the spirit of the Lord just moves in and uh as he as he so often did and because he knew where he stood he knew who he was he he had faith and that what God told him as a little boy was right and so you could see in a prayer line that was more than just a prayer line that's Faith and Action and so I was listening to that sermon and I got to reading some of the things that Jesus said about faith and and and the disciples would say about faith and and this quote stood out to me it's a little bit lengthy so bear with me for just a moment it said now Faith is not based based upon the shifting Sands of man's ideas if I come here and told you there was an angel of the Lord that was in the building and these things happening if I didn't have something to prove that to you you'd have a right to doubt it if I said God gave a gift to do a certain thing and you've seen it come right back around and fail he said you'd say that's wrong aren't you glad it never did he said but when it comes back and God proves it every time to be perfect then that's right God has proved it so that's the way we have to have faith to have a resting place so you have to have faith in something and many times we have to see something and feel something to to have the faith it shouldn't have to be that way but we really have to I mean if brother Brandon would have come along and never showed the first poll to us we would have no reason to believe the second and the third pull but he had to come along and show us something for us to have faith in what was to come and so he said he said if I had if if I come along and said I could do a certain thing and and it didn't happen then it would fail you'd say that's wrong but when it comes back and God proves it every time to be perfect then that's right God has proved it so that's the way we have to have faith in the resting place and he goes on down he says if you're going to get married and the woman that you'd marry or the the boy that you would marry you have to have faith to do that because that's the only way it's going to last you have to believe that who you're marrying is meant for you brother Justin on your anniversary you have to believe that that one is for you because if you don't then then you know it's going to be a long road if you're always questioning did I make the right decision no you believe you made the right decision you believe that's the one for you and so when you get married you have to have faith everything you do in life there has to have there has to be Faith involved everything you do the job you take you have to believe that job's going to provide for you you have to believe that job's going to be good for you you don't want to get into a miserable situation you have to have faith it all comes down to believing and having faith so in everything you do there's got to be Faith involved yes and so he goes on down and he said the only solid resting place for faith is on God's word can you you say Amen to that so I believe tonight if you really want to find a place to put your faith it's in the word of God we can put Faith in a man and the man will fail you you can put Faith in in in in a president and the president's going to fail you you can have faith in nothing but the word of God because all else will fail all of ground is sinking sand but the word of God stands sure and will last forever I believe that faith I is is got to be you've got to be sold out with faith to the word of God he said he said any faith that anybody wants to have the supernatural it must be placed first in the word of the Living God he said now how how it's been through the age how that when uh men of old in all ages when they would really find the word of God and could grasp it Faith went into action right away and he talks about Noah here and he said and Noah he said when God spoke to Noah and said the word of God came to Noah and told them to build an ark for the saving of his household and he said you know the world stood upright before the anian destruction and it wasn't leaning back like this to bring water and when God told Noah he said it's going to send a flood and a rain he said you know he had all kinds of critics he said but Faith doesn't look at the circumstances come on somebody Faith doesn't look at the circumstances Faith doesn't look at the critics but Faith looks at the word of God and he said Faith looks to What God Says and Faith doesn't try to reason Faith just takes it at its face value now he said there's two different kinds of what we call Faith today he said and I'm sorry to say this to my audience tonight but I'm pretty sure I'm tooo sure of this or or real sure of this that there's too much intellectual faith in the stead of being heart faith and I would say today intellectual faith will fail you but faith in the word of God will never fail because that is an eternal faith on an eternal word can you say Amen so what you if you realize today I just want to bring you down into the message here for a minute if you really understand the message and you really look into the message there is no reason to doubt this message even from an intellectual side amen you can't disprove the message of the hour but Satan uses intellectual faith in a person and what they'll do is they'll say well I I don't have any facts for this and I don't have any facts for that well I I can show you all through history we don't have facts for a whole lot of things but lay down your intellectual faith and take God at his word we don't have facts that Noah was there we don't have facts that a lot of things Jesus said happen happened but we believe it by faith in the word of God and then a prophet would come along in a day that we're living in and prove by the very same works that it really did happen you you can be Baptist and you have no proof that Jesus ever lived you could be Methodist and there's no proof that Jesus ever lived but in the message of the hour we have proof that Jesus Christ is alive because he did the same works that Christ did so today we should have more faith than anybody else because we've seen it we've heard it we have proof of it and yet there's still an intellectual faith that the Believers take a hold of that causes them to doubt think about it tonight there's still an intellectual uh aspect to our faith and Satan will get in there and try to make you doubt but if you'll take the word just like it's always been the program of God has never changed it never will change if somebody tries to change it you can look at that and say that's not with the word you may be my brother you may be my sister you you may be a friend but if you're off the words you're off the word that's all there is to it but you've got to stay with the Vindicated word of the hour and and he said see so many revivals are going across the country he said revivals are going across the country and people are claiming to be saved and great evangelist saying they had so many thousands saved and so forth he said I believe it's been and then you go back and find out those people don't stay he said what is it just an emotion in the meeting and they worked and they worked away many people in the meeting raised up and claim healing and walk away more by emot or more by psychic than they do by real Divine Healing of or divine revelation of healing he said and the first little pain strikes and they give up and say well I didn't get my healing now that's an intellectual Faith well I thought I got it I think I got it but I didn't feel good afterwards that's an intellectual Faith let's cast down that intellectual Faith tonight he said he said that's right cuz your faith he said he said but now now you really must believe with your whole heart 10,000 pains would never make you give up come on somebody your faith is already went into motion then he said you're in action right there and I would like to say this if you come on the basis of the word of God and accept your healing and you've accepted your salvation if it's on the basis of the word don't let anybody talk you out of it because if somebody tries to talk you out of something that is a true experience with God you can look at that and say no that's an intellectual Faith that's Faith that's trying to take me out of out of the program of God but over over here I can look at the word of God and have perfect faith in a perfect word a and a perfect program because God is always doing the same thing the same way right so if you had faith for your salvation then you use that same faith for your healing well I'm saved I have no doubt about it but I just can't claim my healing the same Faith same Faith now if you can't have faith for your healing then you better check up on your faith for salvation when the battle gets hard and it gets tough yes don't be one of those that fall away because you just had a a feel-good emotion that you got saved or you thought you got saved no it's got to be a lasting Faith it's got to be something I I I tell you when them disciples went down and they started getting killed off every one of them stood true to their testimony they didn't back up what was it because it was faith that Jesus was really the son of God and today we've got to have the same Faith it's really just as as simple as that you've got to have faith in the word to believe the word if you don't have faith you're not going to see it and you're not going to believe it can you say Amen now brother Bram goes on down he talks about Noah some more and he said he said now God spoke to Noah and told him the impossible some people listen about their kids and say well you said my kids could be saved that's impossible no it's not impossible because God's always proved that the impossible is still possible With God all things are possible and he said when Noah he said he told him the impossible now there was no rain had never rained never was a cloud in the sky nothing but Noah knew that it was going to rain because God said so the weatherman didn't say so but God said so you know I I you all kinds of people can tell you that message ain't right the message ain't right the YouTube channels can can make their videos the message is wrong and he failed here and he failed there but God said it's right and I really don't care what nobody else says you say well how can you prove it because the word of God is is still doing the same thing that it did 2,000 years ago 4,000 years ago it has never changed that's how I know it's still God because a prophet came well why would you believe in a prophet because God always sent a prophet why would you believe a prophet's words because that's what we have in the Bible is a prophet's word we don't have anything else to rest our souls on but the word of God by a Vindicated Prophet that's what we believe here tonight because that is faith believing what God did he still does does why do you believe that the message is so real because it is exactly in line with the biblical program of God and if he never changed and if you believe he never changes then he sure can't change today that's brother Bram said Noah knew that it was going to rain because God said so now he was considered fanatic and so are we today you fit in a whole lot better if you go to a a nominal church right and you you you're you know maybe you're have a better name in society and but I I tell you we don't need a better name in Society what we need is a better name up there we need our name written down to where it doesn't matter about the the book of who's who or or I you know I've got a good status down here on Earth no that don't really matter not to the believer because this is just a temporary home but we're going somewhere we're going where there's peace where there's joy where it don't matter what your last name was it don't matter what your family history was come on somebody it don't matter what you did you're going to a place where you're completely redeemed and made whole and you're young again brother Bill you don't have to get up with them aches and pains no more but you're going somewhere where you can be changed back that's a word I want to believe in that's the word I'm going to rest my soul on because I can have faith in the word like that well how do you know it's true because one day there was a man named Enoch who had lived all them hundreds of years and he walked with God and one day he was changed and he wasn't seen here no more well how how could that be because it's going to happen a whole bunch more times I believe I'm looking at people here today who are going to walk out of this body and you're going to have a body change one of these days you say brother B bill for the bill can look and say well I'm getting old I may go by way of the Grave oh he may not he may be the first one out of here you never know he might he might wake up tomorrow in a new body we might wake up tomorrow at a new body the youngest person could have a body change by morning I think we ought to just have faith that if God did it once he can do it again I have faith for a Rapture because God already translated one and I believe he can do it for me see it's not just a myth it's just not something we're talking about it's something that God's actually done for us it's something God's proven in his word and if he proved his word then we need to have faith now if you really have faith then you'll prove your faith by your actions yes right now your actions won't prove your faith I can stand up here and say I'm a Christian I'm a Christian but if my actions don't prove it then I'm not a Christian you can say I have faith for my healing I have faith for my healing and you need to confess that even if your faith is weak you believe that I I I mean confess it until you do have the faith I'm not saying not to do that but what I'm saying is at some point if you've really got the faith it's going to take hold and you're going to get your healing and so hold on to your faith don't doubt because it doesn't happen right away but be strong giving praise to the Lord for your healing be strong giving praise to the Lord that your children are coming back come on somebody be strong in faith and put your faith in action so if you have believe the word of God then you're going to do what the word of God says right if you really believe it you're going to do it I that's just that's believing and acting that's what you do you say well I believe the message of the hour then well we have a message on tape we have a message in the books the preachers will stand here and we're going to preach at the best of our ability to tell you what it says then you got to put it into action it don't do you no good to hear at every service if you're never going to put it into action but I think we need to take a hold of the words that we've heard take a hold of what a prophet said and put our faith into action tonight I think we would be so much much farther up the road if we could really take hold of what we already know we want to know more revelation we want to know more and it's good we need to always trying to have a progressive revelation and I I think we need that I think we need to know more about the message and and I believe in the teaching and things like that I'm not against that but take what you already know and put that faith into action I think if we start there then we can add to these things let's start let's you know be faithful over the little things then God will make you ruler over much let's let let's take the little things the the little obedience thing put your faith in obedience to the word of God and watch God bless you well I need a new job well just believe for it pray for now if you say well I just want a new job and sit back and say well God you're obligated to give me one no that's not the way you come to God he's not obligated to give you nothing but you come in faith believing and saying Lord you know what I have need of come on somebody you know what I have you know I'm not going to make it if you don't heal me you know that I'm coming down to the end of my life if you don't heal me if you don't make this right if you don't heal my marriage you know it's not going to last that's how you come in faith believing say but Lord I know that if you've ever healed one person of cancer or diabetes or or anything else if you've ever healed one you can heal me even so be it unto me the three Hebrew children were standing there getting ready to go in the fiery furnace it was okay for them to say the Flames can't hurt me God is able to deliver me but they had to believe it they didn't go in kick it and screaming but they went right on in there believing their testimony they believe that what they said could really happen do you believe you could really go on a Rapture then get ready for it see your your action will prove if you really believe in an in a Rapture because if you really believe in it you're going to get your life just as close as you can to the word that came because if you if you're still living like the devil say well when when I start seeing the squeeze come on or come on somebody when I see brother brandom come back and start talking amongst his loved ones are I start seeing my loved ones come oh it's too late then church we got to get ready now we got to get ready now to see our loved ones because it is going to happen but you've got to get ready for it see that's putting your faith in action putting your faith off and say Well when it starts to happen I'll get right with God that's not the way we come to God we don't owe God doesn't owe us anything God doesn't owe you more time to get ready God doesn't owe you nothing but you owe your whole life to him can you say Amen God is not someone who we just we just use as an object to get what we want kind of like your kids do when they want something dad I need this right no dad I need this but I don't have the money for it can I have it Dad I really need you know I need I WHYY it's sitting there I need some more football cards I need a new phone I you know yeah already seven years old I need a phone no you don't need a phone but but you know that's the way God is he don't always give you what you want but ask him ask abundantly and ask in a way that he would actually want to give you something if they come to me and say hey you need to get me this I'm not going to get it you go to God and say hey can you come down here and you know raise my pay by $10 an hour already cuz I'm getting tired of living like this now he's put you where you are for a reason he's giv you what you got for a reason but what you need to do is really get in touch with God and and say Lord this is something I really need see the faith to move mountains don't just go out here and start rearranging the national parks but the faith to move a mountain is when there's a mountain that needs to be moved your faith can move it when there's a tree he said that needed to be moved and plucked up and set over here by the water if if you need it to happen if it's something you need to happen have faith that it will happen and it will happen because that's what you come to God but we don't come to God just just I I I want all this stuff that don't even that I don't really need and you know God wants to give you everything you want but he also knows what you need he knows what's best for you we don't always know what's best for us because we have no idea what tomorrow holds but he does so let's do what he wants to do and so staying with the word obedience to the word is Faith and Action I believe that if you obey the word that's putting your faith that you say I believe the message of the power put into action put it into action by obedience to the word it's just pretty simple it's pretty simple you that are sitting here on a Wednesday night you have you put your faith in action to be here tonight right you put your faith in action when you when you got up and opened your Bible this morning and prayed you were putting your faith into action that's right when you get down when you get home tonight and you sit there and you start to pray with your children or maybe you sit down and you start to read your Bible or or listen to a tape that's putting your faith into action it's more than saying I'm just a Christian when I'm at church but you got to be a Christian when you get home you got to be a Christian in front of your children or else they're going to realize someday that he wasn't really a Believer he was just a make believer now brother Bram said there's three kinds of Believers there's a Believer a make believer and an unbeliever and you know which one he said was the worst kind the make believer right so you know who a Believer is you can watch them you watch them they will do I mean they they do everything they can to do what they can what to to live the message of the hour to the word of God they'll do everything they can to live it now I guess you could say they could fool you it's possible that they could really live like that and then someday fall away I guess that's possible but you know what make believer is really the worst kind because you know sometimes they're real spiritual sometimes they tell you everything you want to hear come on somebody you never met nobody like that they tell you everything you want to hear because they're the most spiritual person in the church but then you go out here watch their life and they start you know running people down and cheating somebody and and all this kind of stuff that that's just a makeb believer that's what they are can they become a Believer I believe they can but they've got to get in line with the word of God and start putting that faith that they say they have into action because I don't mean this I don't mean to yell at you I did enough of that on Sunday but but I but I yeah somebody said that's true I heard you I heard you but uh listen I don't mean to yell at you tonight but I but this was a this thought really come to me really because I started looking at myself you know I can stand up here and I can preach to you and I can sing I can do whatever I want you know I can stand up here and do all that stuff but that that ain't going to save me coming to church ain't going to save you but if you're saved where are you going to be when the doors are open if you really are a holy ghost filled Christian you can't wait to be where other Christians are and you know when you say things like that all the people that can't make it and they have legitimate reasons they start feeling bad I don't mean to make anybody feel bad but if you can do what the word says do what the word says and I believe God will bless you for it I really do I see people out here tonight that are driving an hour on a Wednesday night I I say praise God for people that'll still put forth effort because they see it in the word and they want to do what the word said it's a whole lot easier not to do that but you know what it's going to be a whole lot better for you when you really put your faith in action then when you need something from God think about it if my kids actually are doing something for me and they're actually cleaning their rooms don't ever happen but if they do no they really do they're pretty good kids two two or three out of the four are and so they're pretty good kids but you know what if they really just start disobeying what I've asked them to do and then they start coming around asking for good gifts now my initial reaction is I say my kids are good and I got one crawling all over the place you know they'll embarrass you quicker than anything I promise but if but but really if they if they've just treated me real bad and they don't listen to me and then I then they come around and they want something brand new and they want to add to their toy collection that they already can't take care of now as a father it's probably best if I don't just give in to what they want but as a Christian come on somebody I I hope this is okay I'm not trying to preach at anybody this might all be for me tonight but as a Christian I can't go out here and live like the world 6 days a week come to church on Sunday and say Lord I need a blessing he don't work that way he wants you to give all that you've got for him I know he'll take what you give him but he wants more from you he wants more praise more worship he wants more of your time in prayer he wants to hear from you once in a while not just when you want to call him but he needs you to talk back once in a while say Lord here I am it's me again you know I think sometimes he may not know what you sound like cuz you don't talk to him enough but he wants you to talk to him too or sometimes maybe he just wants you to get quiet enough to listen to what he's got to tell you now I'm just saying that as a father I may change my mind when they're teenagers I may say the Lord would like to kill all the kids you know they get bad I know I all the parents are already warning me and I'm like yeah I'm sorry I'm do my best I don't know what I'll do when I get there you know we're we're always going to do better than everybody else until it comes around and it's our turn right well I've watched their mistakes I would never make that mistake and then God laughs gives you the worst kid you could even possibly think of I'm way off but here I go Moses or Noah was a fanatic he said most always when you find people that'll dare to take God at his word they're considered neurotics or Fanatics can you say amen he said that's right the real True Believer has never had the world to Pat him on the back it's always against him because he takes God at his word and God has never been a friend to the world in the way of the world uh friend of God I mean he said they're against God because they can't understand God so it it's it's a constant battle they're they're always fighting God whether they know it or not and so they're not a friend to God I think tonight we need to be a friend to God I want to put my faith in action so that I can believe his word do what he said and quit fighting against the program of God can you say amen he said and he said you'll never know God Only by faith and he said but no he moved with fear now that's not a fear as in I'm scared but in in a knowing that God was going to keep his word so he moved with fear knowing that there was coming a destruction and he built an ark because he had his faith rested upon God's Eternal Word no matter how much the people said it can't be done no matter how much science comb the globe and said there'll never be clouds up there there's no rain to come down if God's word said that it's going to rain it's up to God to make a way for the rain if God said so that settles it there's an old saying that says I if the prophet spoke it I believe it that settles it I I'll just put it like this I I hate to add to that but you know if if the prophet spoke it if God said it and the prophet spoke it I believe it I'll act on it and that'll settle it because you can say you believe it hey brother Bram said it's not enough to believe it go listen to the Token message it's not enough to believe it it's not enough to say I'm a Believer in the message of the hour but you've got to put your faith in action and if you really believe it your works will prove that you're a real believer come on somebody if you're here on a Wednesday night you can take it because you're saying I'm I'm here I'm putting my faith in action but when tomorrow comes around and Satan comes at you and you feel like you're just too sick to get out of bed that's the time to put your faith in action well you and I'm not talking about people that really get sick and you know you've got to have faith too but sometimes you just really can't get out of bed but what you got to do is remember that the same God that healed anybody and brought them off their sick bed can still do it for you we just got to believe we just got to have faith and and I don't have much time left so I'm going to get you out of here on time but but he said he said uh don't don't make no difference how it looks it don't reason it there we are in that intellectual Faith again don't reason the word of God don't reason with your faith intellectual faith will reason every time but and it'll try to Pro prove God wrong can you imagine trying to prove God wrong when he's made the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak and the blind to see and the dead to live again can you imagine trying to prove that wrong can you imagine trying to prove a a message wrong when the messenger came and literally stood before thousands of people and could tell somebody their name and their address and tell them who they were tell them what was wrong with them I knew a sister in Hot Springs I went to church with her for 10 years and she said that she was in California to meeting and it's on tape she let me listen to it she said brother brandham actually spoke to her she was I I forget how many rows back seven or eight back in a in a big colge see him there in California and she's sitting in the audience and brother brandom said sister I see you and he said now nobody else could see you where you're at because you were in your bathroom and you were getting dressed and there was a big uh big lump there on your side this woman didn't walk up to the front this woman didn't come in for prayer she had no prayer card and the family I knew every one of them I went her her brother-in-law was my pastor for 10 years and I'm here to tell you brother brandham had no idea who that family was but because he saw a vision you said I'm going to prove that man wrong no I'm going to tell you right now God already proved him right he can stand there and look at things that you could never know never seen I'm not lifting up a man but I'm saying God showed in this generation that he still had a Vindicated prophet he always had a Vindicated word I'm not here to try to prove it wrong I'm not here to bring up his mistakes well come on somebody you know when Abraham made mistakes and he actually doubted in the Old Testament go read what God said about him in the New Testament he said he staggered not at the promises of God so you know what if God can't see the mistakes I'm not here to bring them up I'm not here to talk about it what I'll tell you is this yes he was a man but God used that man God used that man to bring you a message that was Vindicated we need to lay down our intellectual Faith well was the cloud in this certain spot was brother brandom in the right place at the right time well oh come on somebody lay aside your nonsense and stay with the word that God has proven to be true well do we just not believe no I tell you what we wasn't there we don't know exactly what happened brother brandom says he wasn't even standing there but I'm tell you this if God would vindicate a lie then God is not even right God doesn't vindicate a lie but he Vindicated that Prophet come on somebody I I just feel to go here for a minute if it's okay but God Vindicated him not because he was a perfect human being but because he was God's chosen man for the hour now I want to just go here for a second he also said he would have a people on Earth who would do the Greater Works he would have somebody here doing the same works that he did now if you can just get your faith and put it in action you don't have to take a backseat to nobody what the prophet did you can do what Jesus did you can do what the apostles did well you can't just do it but you will do it because these signs will follow them that believe it didn't say it would follow the preacher it would follow the deacons it would follow this one or that one or this great evangelist no it would follow everyone that could believe on the word of God that's who it's going to follow so tonight if you put your faith in action you don't have to worry about your children no more can you say Amen if you put your faith in action you don't have to worry about you know about the way the church is going to go but you come here believing and praying for your pastor and praying for the ministers and praying for the singers and praying for yourself that you can get something from God see it's putting your faith in action it's not enough to come and sit and say Well I this is just going to be another service no this is a service where all things are going to be restored this is another service where I'm going to get a little bit closer to a Rapture and a body change I think that's the way we need to come to church come believing that our faith is going to take hold of the promises of God that's putting your faith in action can you say Amen tonight that's putting your faith where it needs to be it's not a faith that you say you have but it's a faith that God sees God sees your faith and he rewards your faith brother Bill can get up in the morning I don't mean to pick on you brother Bill you're you're my one of my favorites I'm not picking on you here but I I hate to keep calling him out but I know brother Bill Gets in pain a lot and and I know that he he tries to go down here and walk he walks around Walmart you get down there real early one morning you might see him down there but he gets down there and walks and I know sometimes he don't make it all the way around because he hurts he's trying to do it he's trying to walk he's trying to he's trying to do something to keep himself active and and I commend you for that if I'm your age and I can still walk I'm going to do the same thing maybe not Walmart but whatever's around at that time but but what what he's doing is when he gets out of bed in the morning he's going to have to defeat a devil because he hurts every time he gets out of bed sometimes he can't hardly breathe and he comes here to church you say why does he do it then because he's obedient to the word of God and that's putting his faith in action you think God won't reward that I I I believe this with all my heart I was preaching here a few months back and I got to preaching on the uh the Promises of God and how your children could come back to the Lord and I looked over here and I saw sister Karen and as soon as I looked at her the there was something come over me and said you don't have to worry about your kids you can just believe for it and they had a grandkid in trouble at the time it wasn't me come on church I'm just trying to say this because their faith actually touched Heaven during a service and it it was like a next service or the service after that that young man was was was was out of trouble well come on somebody and he come back saying I you know brother Bill actually came up to the altar that service and his heart he was crying and he said you just don't know the shape my children are in right now but I believe that same faith is the faith that saved you and the faith that's bringing you out here when you don't feel like coming that same faith is going to have every one of your children standing there waiting for you you say I don't I don't believe it what he does that's all that matters what about the condition of them tonight it don't matter what the condition is it don't matter how dark it looks but what I'm telling tell you is God keeps his word and if you just believe the word that's putting your faith in action he don't have to go out and tell his kids say say I know you're going to be saved so you can just live no no he's praying that they come right here and get the same experience that he got but what he's really believing is it doesn't matter if he ever sees that happen he knows he's going to see him on the other side because the Bible said it would happen thine thy house shall be saved don't worry about it that's just faith on that's just Faith do you realize that anyway to get to heaven yourself you got to have faith for your children to get there we know they got to have an experience for themselves we know they've got to be saved we know that all these things but if you really have faith for yourself that same faith will bring them to that same place and that's what we believe as Christians when you I've been to funerals where I've looked at family members and I'm like Lord how in the world could they make it I know the condition but I have to look to a promise that if I believed for them then I know they're going to be there I don't know what the last minute of their life was like come on somebody I've been to funerals where I I I don't know that I could preach them to heaven but I'll say this after reading the word of God I can say this it don't matter what happened to him I'm just believing that something happened on their deathbed to get them there well I don't believe in deathbed experiences well I don't put a lot of stock in myself but I'll say this if you believe you just believe that they're going to be there hold on to faith no matter what the circumstances look like well I believe as long as they're living cuz they got a chance no believe yes believe until you're not even around no longer to believe just keep believing believe for your family believe for your church you say well I want to see our church more more on fire for god well just start believing for it you become on fire for God I I want to see people you know really come more often and and F the pews well me too but listen I got to just believe it's going to happen I got to believe for those people see we're we're believing for each other we're loving one another we've got to have that love and this time when everything's so cold everything's so hard anymore but we've got to have a love for one another to have faith for each other and then we can put our faith in action we don't look around to see who's missing on a Wednesday night but I'm here because I'm going to put my faith in action I'm going to put my faith with your faith and we're going to believe for those who couldn't make it that God will restore them God will raise them up God will give them a desire whatever they need maybe God will heal them whatever it is to get them back in the house of the Lord I think about brother Harold there who's so faithful to the church too so faithful to the house of God and Satan come in and tried to take him out but you know what it don't matter because Satan's not going to win because we're believing for his healing we're praying for him and I believe your prayers matter I believe your your prayers can still Touch Heaven I believe you can be sitting there just like brother Bill was and sister Karen was and your heart for your children your heart for your loved ones sitting in this building tonight can still Touch Heaven and Heaven can come down and restore him back to where they need to be that's putting faith in action I believe that's what the church needs tonight now this is what's on my heart I hope it's okay but we need faith in action let's not talk about it let's do it let's put it in action let me get right down here to where I can close I I'm I'm out of time I'm I'm going to get right down here where I can close and we'll stop he said what we need today is some real genuine Faith put into action he said yes sir we need real Faith men who dare to put God's word to their heart and apply it to themselves he said you try to apply it to the generation gone by but the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he's forever God and he never fails somebody say never he never fails he said he's forever God he's the same in principle he's the same in power and he's the same tonight that he was when he walked on the banks of Galilee and he appears nightly on this platform brother BR said he appeared nightly well Christ wasn't there oh yes he was he appeared nightly he said and he proves himself alive from the dead can you say man you don't have to take history about it it's right now present time fact that we see it now that's what a prophet said in 1955 but I believe we can apply that tonight if he's Jesus Christ then and he was forever then he's Jesus Christ now so I can stand here with confidence and say it tonight that Jesus Christ is standing on the platform here tonight that don't make me nothing but what it does is makes the word true and puts my faith in action I can believe he's here you can believe he's here because the word said he's here well you say well brother Bram didn't say he's in Word of Life and Hearty no but he said he's the same yesterday and today and forever and if we're Believers wherever two or three are gathered we are in his midst and he is in our midst so I would say this tonight if he's here anything you have need of put your faith in action tonight step out on it and believe it you know I believe brother Daryl Wards preached it and brother Brandon preached it too but he's he's still in the boat tonight I believe he's an ontime God he's still right among his people you don't have to worry about nothing because you've got a Vindicated word we don't have to wonder is this word true it's Vindicated to be true you don't have to wonder C can God still do the same thing he's proven to still do the same thing he's proven to still be alive tonight all we have to do is believe it and put the faith that we say we have in action how many Believers we have here tonight then take what you say you believe in and put it in action here tonight I challenge The church here tonight don't just say it don't just talk about it but believe it with all your heart and and really step out on faith and say Lord I I I need more of you I Lord I believe but help thou my unbelief Lord I believe everything you said but help thou my unbelief cuz Satan's going to come and he's going to try to talk to you and try to get you to have an intellectual faith and that'll never make a Rapture but you've got to have a perfect faith in a perfect word and you will take a hold of a perfect promise do you believe that here tonight if our musicians would come let's stand to our feet my time's up and I want to just say this in closing if I can get to it here he said the heroes of the Old Testament they had Faith they put it in action you've got them for an example he said you've got them for an example now we've got faith but he said you won't put it into action he said ride away on the powers of the Holy Spirit that's how we're going to get out of here that's how you're going to get out of here is a Rapture real yes intellectual faith will say prove it but a real genuine faith in the word of God says I believe it that's what we got to have here tonight I believe the word of God I believe everything he said well that was like brother brandom's opinion I'll take his opinion over about anything else you can give me because I'll take a Vindicated Prophet come on on somebody I'll take a Vindicated word I'm not the one who was standing here Vindicated but he was it didn't vindicate a human being what it did was vindicate that Jesus Christ could still do the same works today and I believe by the word that he spoke you can still do the same works that he did do you believe that tonight amen if there's somebody in here that needs needs to be prayed for the altar is open I just want you tonight I want you to leave encouraged that what you have is enough I need more faith no if You' got the gra if you got faith like the grain of a mustard seed just put that faith in action just put that faith in action well I I don't understand the Mysteries quite yet well just put the faith You' got in action do you believe that God sent a prophet put that faith in action do you believe that he came with thus sayith the Lord put that faith in action Malachi 4 said behold I send you Elijah put that faith in action I'll tell you what I I if we just put the basic things in action do the basic things we know to do God will add to your revelation God will add to your to your to your stature God will do those things but let's just get the Holy Ghost and believe what we do know and let's believe that with all of our hearts amen let's bow our heads if you play something there amen let's just I I just want to read this as they play something by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death yes and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God God now I read that excuse me mean to be a baby but when I read that I thought can I have that testimony before I before I'm changed that I pleased God that's what I want it it my Works aren't going to save me but can I please God with what I'm doing can I please God by doing what his word said that's what I want tonight because I believe just like Enoch was translated we're going to be translated and I want my testimony to be I pleased God not by my works but by faith in the word of God and my Works Pro that I really had that Faith amen do you believe that tonight how many wants that testimony I want to please God I want more of you I believe a translation's about to happen let's just get ready for it he said without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him by faith Noah by faith Daniel by faith Moses by faith Joshua by faith brother Brandon By Faith put put a name there but now I want you to put your name there by faith brother Bill by faith sister Karen by faith brother Logan by faith brother d David he's still with us when he was in the hospital and we thought he might not come out with Co but he's still here why somebody had faith and prayed for him there's testimonies all over the building sometimes we forget how good God's been to us sometimes we need to look up and say Lord thank you for the good things you've given me we've got more faith than we think we've got there's been Greater Works done than what you think's been done but I want I I I just want to please you Lord for what you've already done I'm not looking I'm not looking for more works for myself I'm not looking for for you to do more for me I just want to do more for you and that's the kind of son that a father wants to reward that's the kind of daughter that the father wants to look at and say you know I want to give you something special because you love me and you've put your faith in action you really believe me you've proved that you believe me why was Abraham tried because he wanted to he wanted to show us as an example that somebody could withstand a test of their faith amen if you bow your heads with me Heavenly Father you see the church here tonight if there's one in this building Lord that would say I I'm struggling to put my faith in action I'm struggling to just believe what a prophet said I'm struggling to to do what the word says Lord God I pray you would just anoint us with a special anointing to withstand the spirits that are coming against us in this day of intellectual faith and intellectual knowledge is trying to rep place of real heartfelt Faith but Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation restore unto me the faith for a Rapture restore unto me the good things that you've already given me Lord restore to me a a belief that that what you've done what you've promised you're able to keep I pray you would be with each one of these people that have made the the drive out here tonight Lord be with them tomorrow through this week Lord may they just stay in your word may they just study and and listen and and Lord may they come on Sunday morning with just a heart to receive receive something from you I pray you would be with us now go with each one we ask in Jesus name Amen brother Allen if you would sing for us may the altar is open if you need it God bless you I'm going to
