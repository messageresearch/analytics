of you looks like we have a visitor here in the back God bless you this morning uh hope you feel welcome here and we just enjoy the presence of the Lord and worshiping God together and uh we're just the body of Jesus Christ we want to remain that amen amen 1 Chronicles 15 and3 as brother Brandon would say we we don't have any Creed but Christ no law but love no book but the Bible and so we want to uh just always want to stay with that always want to believe that trust that the Lord will take care of us 1 Chronicles 15:3 as we've been preaching about the Ark of the Lord and how it was brought back to its place and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto his place which he had prepared for it unto his place which he had prepared for it I want to speak to you this morning on the word in his place the Lord would add his Blessing to the word let's bow our heads together for just a moment wonder if there's any special need this morning by way uplifted hand you'd like to make known God sees each and every unspoken request Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for being a Healer we thank you for being a savior we thank you for for being our healer and our savior we thank you for that Lord I I pray that you'd move in this service today I pray that your spirit would be with us Lord that your word would be preached Lord I pray you'd move me out of the way help me Lord I I know I'm insufficient to approach your word without your your help without your anointing I pray that you'd anoint me today I pray that your word would be a reality in the lives of the people Lord as we as we preach may you move us aside and maybe there be some need Lord that could be met by the preaching of the word I pray God that you'd move me aside and speak directly to that situation we thank you for these people that have gathered here thank you for your word and your spirit in Jesus name name amen God bless you you can be seated we're going to have a youth service tonight and but any all of you are welcome to come but I would like for our young ones tonight we got several of them sitting up here on the front I would like for our young ones to sit up front tonight and uh especially teenagers and um if you can do that we're going to use some of them my brother Peter there's a rumor brother Peter's going to lead some of the songs and um he say that's what I was told so we're going to we're going to try to uh do that and and just have a good old time in the Lord amen and use some of these young people in in the work of the Lord if you don't know if they can do it till you try it right so amen amen so we're going to do that tonight and and looking forward to that brother the Joel's going to preach in that service I'm just a little bit under the weather as you can probably already tell it's just the change of the weather I'm not sick and as far as uh I don't I don't have coid or something like that but I'm just a little bit under the weather from the weather change and so you pray for me this morning uh we need to pray for Israel I uh there's so much going on right now I don't have time to get into it all this morning but there a war there and I understand there's some 500 people on the Israeli side that's already been killed and and uh it's such a tragedy such a tragedy of of a Nation but also because we believe Israel has a place in the end time and we see that that coming to pass and you know they haven't it's been 50 years since they've declared war uh in Israel and they declared war this morning and so I think we're maybe closer than than we think Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree put forth its buds and we understand that to be the the nation of Israel becoming a nation he said when you see that you know summer is nigh he said look up lift up your heads your Redemption draws nigh and so I believe that's the hour that we're living in and then uh you know there there's so much going on there and uh there's a I understand brother Doug Baker there's one of his deacons is there in Israel was there yesterday anyway and I'm able to get a flight home so we need to pray for that brother and his wife as well and I just believe the Lord's going to keep his hand on all all the elect all the Believers uh we know we're getting close church and these things have to happen but we also know that we're under the care of a mighty God a sovereign God but the Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and we would be blessed so we'll do that continue to keep them in your prayers as we uh continue with our story this morning of uh David bringing the ark back or attempting to bring the ark back to the place uh to Jerusalem and to a place where it could be inquired of and it could be of use to the people of God as we found out last week he was right in wanting to do that but he did it in the wrong way and many times that's what happens is our good intentions are not always enough we've got to go by the word we've got to stay with what God Said regardless of any good intentions that we may have we've got to stay with the book we've got to stay with what God Said So Many but but what happened is that David when that happened and usza died as we talked about last week it woke him up he realized hey we did this thing wrong but he actually had an overreaction to it which is simp SAR to one that we have like uh we see people that go into excess you see the charismatic church today and many of the people that uh television preachers how they've gone into an excess of uh Financial gospel or Prosperity Gospel you see the people today that have gone in an excess of uh of worship without any word at all and so people tend to look at that and begin to get scared and David got scared he said here we had all the big meeting we we called called everybody together we had worship we had uh we had uh we had the tongues and interpretation and we had uh we had gifts we had all these things and yet it wasn't right and so he got scared of all of it and the Bible says that uh David was afraid of God that day saying how shall I bring the Ark of God home to me so in other words God if if God would here an innocent man would die even though I was doing my best to try to serve God how could I do it but I want to tell you this morning we should not be afraid of the presence of God we should not be afraid of the move of the spirit we should not be afraid there is a right way that we can have the fullness of the word we should not be afraid of digging into the message of the hour getting those nuggets out we should not be afraid of the word of God because so many have went into excess with it we should not be afraid of the opening of the word we should not be afraid of the Seven Seals we should not be afraid of God coming down in our day we should not be afraid to preach the message of the hour oh someone come make a cult out of it or do something else we should not be afraid of doing what God has told us is right to do in our hour we can still clap our hands we can still worship we can still call out to God we can still have altar calls we can still have prayer lines we can still work for God we can do that without doing it in the wrong way let's just stay with the word while we do it are you with me now so but David was scared and many folks today are scared to worship God that's right scared to really oh if I if I raise up my hands maybe I'll become a Target if I shout in church maybe on Monday I'll be a Target but I'll tell you this you might as well you're a Target anyway you might as well worship God in the house of God cuz the devil's got his sight on you anyway he's trying to destroy you anyway it doesn't matter what you do the devil's at to get you but God is for you he said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you might as well worship God might as well let the word come to its place yes sir in its fullness amen so we don't need to be scared to worship God right we don't need to be scared to to do the things that are necessary to go to church to have pastors to believe what God Said Yes it just because somebody did it wrong doesn't mean that we have to do it wrong 1st Chronicles 13:13 so David brought not the ark home what a tragedy that was see he could have just picked it up and did it right yeah and carried it on into Jerusalem but but he didn't do it because he he realized now that and there was another issue as well but he realized that that he he was scared because he was afraid they' do it wrong and so he carried it into somebody else's house it was obededom the gitite and the Ark of God remained with the family of OED Edom in his house three months like this remember everywhere it went it caused death and destruction but when it come into the house of OED Edom and all that he had he said the Lord bless that house and all that he had listen when you let the word come into your house the Lord will bless your house I've told people before I've challenged them if you'll just do what the word says if you'll just do the simple things that you know to do just the Bible scriptural things you know to do just follow the message the best you know how to do it and if you'll do that you'll begin to se God because obedience entitles you to the Token you'll begin to see God move in your life you begin to see Supernatural things just because you started doing the the simple things the things you know to do that's right and you'll see Supernatural that'll come from that so the Lord blessed the house I believe the Lord's blessed my house not because of who I am not because I did everything just right but because the word has comeing my house I've opened up my doors and said Lord I'm willing to let your word dwell right here in my house amen Thank You Lord For the First Time The Ark was a blessing and not a curse amen bring the word in your house and God will bless it don't be scared of it let it dwell there don't be scared well I don't want my kids to become some kind of man followers just let the word dwell in your house let it dwell there in its fullness now one of the reasons that David failed in bringing back the ark the first time is he failed to prepare a place for it see the ark needed a place to rest so he was trying to bring the ark brother brandom said to the city of David to his own denomination and there's where we fail so many times is we're trying to we're trying to bring the word of God and we're trying to let the Revival come with it but we want it in our own way we want it according to our own teaching the way we've been taught and our own church and and our own little group and our own little fellowship and and I see that so many places today so we're subject to that too say God well I would believe that way if it was in my church if it happened to me if it was like I said many people don't have a problem so much with what's going on with the Revival they just have a problem with the Revival not happening to them and so they criticize it because it wasn't in their Church they criticize it because it wasn't part of their organization but it's time we opened up our minds and opened up our hearts and said Lord however you want to do it wherever you want to do it whatever you want to do I believe it's time for you to move brother brand said he was trying to bring the ark to the city of David his own denomination and so he and and many times we we see Revival we see things begin to happen we criticize it just because it's not us yeah and we should never do that I say if the church down the road has a Revival let's support it if the people down the road if another Pastor is blessed thank God for the blessing I I I hope the cup gets so full and spill over on us come on now right that's the way we ought to be because because we realize what God does is Sovereign and what God does he does in his way in his time yeah in the place of his choosing so and this is what happened to brother Brandon when he started out in his ministry you know he said the the the Oneness wanted him the Trinity wanted him the Assemblies of God wanted him these other denominations wanted him but they wanted him in their own place yeah right they wanted him in their own place they wanted the the healing they wanted the restoration of the gifts but they wanted it in their in their church and and brother brand wouldn't do that and so many of them rejected it he said they wanted to bring it to the city of David why there was no place ready for it Oh my he said that's the reason you can't bring the message to a denomination word the ark Christ the same yesterday today and forever and all identification you can't bring it to your organization they'll never believe it cuz there's no room for it they got room for everything else but not for the word they got room for soup suppers but not the word they got room for charitable acts and that's wonderful to do charity charitable acts but they don't have room for the word and what has happened in our day when when music takes up all the all the service and there's nothing wrong with music but there's got to be a place for the word there's nothing wrong with there's nothing wrong wrong with programs there's nothing wrong with Sunday school programs and things activities for the kids but the word has got to have first place it's got to have a preeminence among us if it doesn't what are we doing here anyway yeah oh my the word is not my word but the word of God Christ has to have first place in our midst so he said he said they'll never believe it because there's no room for it he said there was no place ready for it at that time and so it is today he said these great Mysteries that's been unfolded by the Seven Seals there's not a place in any denomination he said would have to quit being a denomination to take it all the way from Luther on down to the Pentecostal Oneness there's not a place can receive it oh my but I'm so glad you realize that brother Brown even early in his ministry he couldn't bring those things because there was no place for it there was no people to receive it but there's a place for it now there's a place for the word to come back there's a place for the opening book there's a place for the ark there's a place for worship there's a place we can it can come back in our house there there's a place to receive it and 1 Chronicles 15:1 and David made him houses in the city of David and he didn't forget God he prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched for it a tent the Lord wouldn't let him build a permanent Temple remember that was Solomon's job because my remember that's a type of the Millennium Solomon's Reign is a type of the Millennium there will come a time when the word comes into its incarnate body and Jesus Christ himself lives on the throne right that's why we watch what happens in Jerusalem because one day the Corporal body of Jesus Christ will set foot on the Mount of Olives that's what the Bible says he'll come in like manner as we saw him go away and he'll come back and set his foot on the Mount of Olives and when he does he'll Rule and reign right he'll Rule and Reign we've been looking at that on Wednesday nights when it comes to the uh when it comes to the seals and things that are going on and it gives you great light and comfort when it comes to the things that are happening in the news because we know what the end is we don't know exactly how it'll get there we know what the end is yes so David prepared a place not the temple but a tent now if you go to Psalm 275 you'll find that and I want to tell you this morning with without trying to scare you but I believe in a tent Doctrine I said I believe in a tent Doctrine I do a tent a tabernacle right brother brandom taught us in the Bible teaches if you look at the original you'll find that you'll find that a tent a tent was seen as a habitation or a tabernacle or dwelling place and so he talked about when Jesus come to Earth God stretched his tent right he made his tent among men his ation his his his Tabernacle his movable Dwelling Place amen so there's a tent that I believe in so he says in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock the word Tabernacle is tent yeah if you translate It Go in a modern translation that's what that is so in the secret of his tent shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock now we know that's a scripture pertaining to the rapture right so now in in the secret of of a tent he's going to hide me now acts 7 verse 44 tells us he said our fathers this is Stephen preaching that wonderful sermon before he got his before he got stoned sometimes you got to preach where you get stoned a little bit sometimes you just got to preach the word but acts 7:44 he said our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses as he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our father fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles that Jesus there is Joshua whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me he says what is the place of my rest all he was was always looking forward to a time not when he could be hidden behind a badger skin not when he could be hidden in a tent or in a temple in the holy of holies but he was looking forward to a time when he could be hidden in the hearts of men that's exactly what he wanted to come to that's exactly where he is this morning he's here in the church because he's in me he's in you so now he dwells not in the temple made with hands and you couple that with Hebrews chap 10 verse 5 he said wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me a body he wanted a body to dwell in and he dwelt in Oh my he dwelt in the Tabernacle of Jesus Christ but when he left the Earth what happened to him he left and he sent down his Spirit to dwell yeah right on the on the 120 in the upper room and on as many as would believe yeah right down Through the Ages so he veils himself in the tent of his body what tells us what is the Tabernacle now what is the Tabernacle where does God dwell he dwells in a body yes God tabernacling in a body right amen he veils himself in the tent of his body that's why I believe in a tent Doctrine he veils himself in the tent of his body the bride this is where the full word had to come back to listen we are the place prepared for the word and I tell you it might be scary to bring the word back you say well I'm scared something bad will happen no just make your heart ready make sure you're ready to receive the word you can't just receive it in any old way but you got to receive it in a heart that that surrendered to the spirit of God surrendered to the word of God willing to follow the word if God if God if you said it I'm going to do it if you said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm going to do it because that's what you said to do amen he said as many as believe would be baptized and I'm going to believe and I'm going to follow the word of God he said that that we should do the things that we do and why do we do what we do because we want a place where the word can dwell in the midst of leoda in the midst of a world that's gone crazy we want a place where the Bible can still be manifested where the word where Christ can still show himself where the word can still dwell in the hearts of men and women he fails himself in the tent of his body the bride we are the place prepared for the word I'll say this when we come to church we ought to prepare ourselves for the word yeah right right we should prepare ourselves we should be ready for the word if we have to get here early we have to pray if we have to get ready on Saturday night so we be at church on time on Sunday morning I don't know who gets here on time and who don't I don't watch that so that's just for everybody whatever we have to do so it's not hectic and all running around why because we want a place prepared a place prepared for the word to be able to live in a place for the word to be able to make his home a tabernacle to come back to yeah oh I want to be that place don't you I don't want there to be any ill feeling you know if you come with a grudge in your heart if you come that way you can't receive the word everything you receive it'll be it'll go through the filter of that Grudge yeah if you come with a bad feeling toward somebody you need to get rid of it come on you said but they did me wrong I they they did this that or the other listen if you're going to get offended by those petty little things when the word wants to come into your heart listen the word wants to make his Abode with you Christ is knocking at the door and here you're keeping him out because of some little petty problem you've got with somebody else I said let it go and let God Walk Into Your Heart yeah you shouldn't hate nobody we shouldn't hate nobody I don't care who they are or what they've done we are we are not we are not uh as we can say we're Christians We believe We don't believe in retribution we don't believe in Revenge we are our our Master our King the one whose Spirit dwells within us he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing let go of that unforgiveness let go of that bitterness so many people I've seen carry bitterness and don't even don't even understand why let go of it but I don't understand something that happened to me just let it go the only person that's hurting it's you right it keeps you from receiving the word because you got a filter on you good it makes you scared to really worship god really do what God said yeah right now watch we are the place prepared for the word brand said we pledge this Lord to you as a people after this message he said no matter what denomination what sensation what we have done whether we have shouted whether we have scream whe we have spoke with tongues whether we have danced in the spirit any of these Sensations now we believe in those things yeah but that's not what he what it is yeah Oh my he said oh God let the Holy Spirit bring it into the hearts of the people now to know that those things doesn't count what's he saying it does not that don't mean you're saved right that just means you're happy yeah right if you shout that don't mean you're Sav cuz some of y'all shout at ball games too right and that's okay as long as you shout at church as well right but some people some people make noise and some people don't that's all right that's all right but if you're going to make noise I might you might as well make noise about the return of the word yeah but he said no matter what you've got no matter what you got going on whether you shouted or danced or spoke with tongues you said oh God let the Holy Spirit bring it into the hearts of people now to know that those things doesn't count that it's tabernacling deity yes sir oh God do we realize where we're at church it's more than just running around and and and dancing and screaming that's part of it I love that but that's not what we're our goal is the goal is not an emotional experience the goal is tabernacling deity in our hearts and when deity is there Everything Changes yes that's what we want right we want to be real Christians that the world can see we're Christians because the world may not see you dance the world may not see you shout but the world may see you smile yes right the world may see the way you treat them at the grocery store the world may see how you treat the poor person the world may see how you treat the the one who's less fortunate the world may see how you treat your neighbor the world may see how you treat one another oh my are you a Christian how many can say I'm a Christian this morning you believe you're a Christian I believe we should all say that by faith you should never testify to not being a Christian if you're not one come and be one today what do you have to do have to join this church absolutely not we don't even have church membership what you have to do is is follow the the word of God believe it and accept it in your heart yeah you have to just sayl I'm willing to do what you say now watch but but it's tabernacling deity to be a Christian you must be Christlike tabernacling deity in you with the Holy Ghost like fell in the day of Pentecost not some emotion he said but I mean a real Pentecost again he said I've never believed the Holy Ghost was shaking I've never believed the Holy Ghost was evidence of speaking in tongues or crying or shouting it was emotional Sensations he said I believe the Holy Ghost can do that but the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity that's right right oh my oh I want to be a tabernacle so that if if I shake let it be and you remember when he come in and Tabernacle in the temple the the doors were moved by the glory of God but it's not always shaking it's not always running it's not always shouting sometimes it's just being in the presence of God and being so changed that you go out a different person than when you came in oh that's what I want I want to be a new person when I go out I don't brother Joe I don't want to be the same old guy when I come in the presence of the shikina glory of God I want to go out a different person I want to go out a new man I want to be different to my family I want to be different to the world around me I want to be a tabernacle for deity Amen brother Bron said that's what the must the matter today people get worked up and excited emotion he said and it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity listen what he says your words is his words yeah oh my CU you could shout and run all over the church and say well just not going to make it cuz I was up today and down tomorrow but if you if you Tabernacle deity there's something in you says I'm going to make it I'm going to say what the word says about me I'm not going to say what people say about me I'm not going to say what my past was I'm going to say what the word says all right the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity your words is his words yes how do you prepare a place for the ark you prepare that place by the new creation 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man someone say If any man be in Christ he is what a new creature that word in the original is creation he is a new creation old things are passed away the old how many things All Things become new I don't know about you but I faced some moments in my life when I needed all things to be new I didn't want to be who I was anymore more yeah I didn't want to do what I did anymore needed all things I didn't want just a partial renovation I didn't want a kitchen redo I didn't want just just part of me I didn't want just my emotions just my just just that part of me I didn't want just the Flesh of the spirit Lord all things I need all things to become new the good thing about all things becoming new is nothing is recognizable anymore you walk into a place where all things have become new and you don't recognize anything there's no there's no a memory of the past although you may remember it in your mind and your flesh but to him all things have become new there's no memory of a past sin there's no memory of those things that drag you down there there is therefore now Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what is it you are tabernacling deity you are new creature in Christ all things are becoming new wonderful you become a new person not just an old one patched up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you're a complete brand new unit yeah right right we've had to do a lot of work on our on our AC units over the past few years and it seems like every time you put one you start patching it up eventually you're just going to have to replace it eventually that thing's going to have you're going to have so many parts in that thing you're going to have to just replace the whole thing because the shell of it even will rot away because everything made by man is disposed osble you know that's the case with your vehicle at some point all things need to be made new right there's only that right sister Alison there's only so many things you can do that old van to make it the kids have been in there for many miles and and things have happened in that van and there's only so many things you can do to make that new right at some point all things need to become new at some point you need to be a new creature in Christ you need to be you don't need to be the the product of your mother and father but you need to be a son or daughter of Jesus Christ all right brother brand says God takes the old man burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself sends down your representation I love that takes the old man and burns him completely out before the ark could come into Solomon's Temple it had to be brought into David's prepared tent before the word can come incarnate in the Millennium he must return in his full power in this tent amen can can you see the type this morning he must brother said it couldn't happen through the to the denominations but it had to take place before the millennial age there had to be a people who could bring him back into their tent 1 Chronicles 15:2 look what David does now as he starts to bring the word back he realizes his error of the past David said none ought to carry the AR of God but the Levites they messed up by carrying on a new cart messed up by thinking that that technology could overcome and could do it for them God uses people he said no not to carry the Ark of God but the Levites for them ha the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God and to minister unto him forever sir he got a revelation that God only works through man how many believe that today yes you don't use the agency of any mechanical device but agency of man a man that surrendered and consecrated to God brother brandom had a prayer line he said he said may as they pass through this line we lay our hands upon them may they recognize it's just not going by man but God and man is one God has come into man God does nothing apart from man that's what he does his works is through man he made man his partner amen what did Jesus say in Luke chap 10 verse two he said them the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth laborers into his har Harvest when he looked on the Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest he may send laborers into his Harvest making himself with man so bound together that he works only someone say only he works only through the agency of man he chose man to work for him he could have chose a son to preach the gospel he could have chose the winds or the trees or the stars but he chose man he veils himself inside yes he hides himself from the unbeliever but reveals himself self to who he will praise revealing himself to you today David prepared a place and guess what he did first Chronicles 15:3 now let's look at it he had to overcome his fear and go ahead and have a meeting that's right that's what he did and so many people want to preach part of this but let's preach all of it yeah David had to overcome his fear to go together go ahead and have a meeting yeah to bring up the Ark of the Lord into his place which she had prepared for and this time there was a place a prepared place for the word to rest and David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites what what's he doing he's getting a bunch of preachers together but but preachers fail absolutely they do preachers have problems yes they're human beings preachers do have problems but there's got to be somebody there to fulfill the word to preach the word somebody's got to be there to preach it somebody's got to be there to believe it CU a preacher nothing without a congregation I'll be honest with you I wish that they had talk about Pastor appreciation I wish they had congregation appreciation day maybe we ought to have that congregation appreciation day I tell you what every Sunday is congregation appreciation day why because you all what would we be without somebody to listen right but God's got to have preachers too where do the preachers come from they come from the body right I hope we're raising up some of them right here preachers come from the body Preachers Wives come from the body deacons come from the body trustees come from the body God's raised them up right among us if he terries very much longer we got more coming on I'll say this we shouldn't be intimidated by the young people coming on and beginning to do things we shouldn't be intimidated by that at all we should welcome that because all of us eventually if we we live long enough we're going to pass off the scene and the young people have got to step up and take that burden somebody's got to pick it up and I want my kids to do a better job than I did I don't want them to do just as good as I did I want them to do better than I did I want them to carry less complexes I want them to have less scars I want to have a place where the word of God can be real for the people come on good good amen David's getting a bunch of preachers called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the Levites for all of those names that are listed there even call Joel verse 12 and said unto them you are the chief of the fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves sir Joel and all the other Levites sanctify yourselves I hope you're hearing me today both you and your brethren that you may bring up the Arc of the Lord God of Israel into the place that I have prepared for it before it can be delivered into your heart it's got to be carried over the hearts of the Levites and to do that it requires Sanctified hands and Sanctified Hearts he said for because you did not do it you did it not at the first the Lord Our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order sir and and an innocent person died we went through that last week because they didn't do it right I say we must do it right it's not optional caring the word on the Ark of the Levites let me let me say this is not optional having a preacher in the church is not optional right having the preaching of the word in the church is not optional it must it it's required it's God's order yeah true because they didn't do it and and someone died so the priests and the Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel brother BR said God let let this sink deep in the hearts word of God has no right to be preached out of an Unholy mouth it should not be preached out of a mouth of a man that would say that Jesus Christ was once one thing and now something else I'm preaching at me now y'all like it when I preach at somebody pre I'm preaching at me you know I'm the only person I pick on well I pick on Joel a little bit I saw brother Bill looking at me when I said that I'm My Own Worst critic that's right I may say something I hurt you sometime I don't mean to I don't do that to liberally I got to preach I got to say what the word says I I don't want to ever do that because I'm saw something or something's going on I'm just picking at you if I if there's something that serious I'll talk to you about it I'll come to you and talk to you about it but I don't I don't want that to be what this Pulpit is where I just pick at people but I I I will pick on myself today because we I got to be Sanctified I got to make sure that the word is carried by Sanctified hands I got to take time to pray take time to seek the mind of the Lord listen he said it should not be preached out of a mouth of man that would say that Jesus Christ was once one thing and now something else it must be preached by a power of the Living God through Sanctified lips that's dedicated to the service of the Lord let these ashes the Waters of Separation be kept in a holy place he said no believer that ever takes on the name of the Lord Jesus that ever confesses him as Savior should ever do anything in the world he's not saying you should never uh never go out in the world and have a job or anything like that that's not what he's saying but something that would be against the word if he does he should repent of it quickly because them words are the Waters of Separation listen we don't just carry the word you carry the word must be kept in a holy Place handled with Clean Hands yes he said no man has a right to preach the gospel without first being Sanctified from the cares and things of this world that's strong but it's true you can say am man it's all right I believe I've done that I there is therefore now no condemnation right but look listen if I ever get to where I don't carry it that way you need to tell me about it you've got a responsibility to make sure that the word you're being fed is not handled with unclean hands that's that's your responsibility it's important you do not want your children fed out of a out of a slop I've been in Africa and watched them I stood in Togo Africa or benine actually watched them after a meeting and they fed all the people and I didn't eat but they fed all the people we'd eat at night you eat once a day cuz just so hot and there's no facilities or anything it's just a wall you know so you just you don't want to eat so so I would thereare and there's a thousand people no restroom facilities no clean water and they're gathered together and I'm looking and and here's a a line of children I go out outside of the wall there little wall Sur around the building I walk outside there and here's a great big pot of rice and they take that rice and put it in a a little bowl or container and then those kids they scoop that up with their fingers well there's no place to wash them kids are immune from everything man they never got coid they're just immune from everything and they're just they're just scooping it up plus they didn't have television so they didn't know about it but they just scooping it up you know and and uh and there's looking at that I thought my goodness brother spirit I would not want my children to stand in that line they my children are little Americans man we eat at McDonald's we take our our food out of wrapped paper you know plastic and open it up first time it's ever seen a pathogen is when you you open it up and and so we man we prepared at home we clean everything rinse it and hot water and stuff there's no rinsing them utensils and and things it's like it's like eating back when we were at home actually brother Joel When We Were Young not really my mom's very clean but we did we did live in the woods but but I looked at that I thought I don't want my kids eating out of that dirty pot thought about that by the J I don't want my kids eating out at a church where the word is handled by dirty hands I don't want it I go listen church we have a responsib I'm not saying this to you because that's happening I'm saying this to you because we should never allow it to happen preachers we need to stay in Revival we need to stay before the Lord we need to grab a hold of the horns of the altar sanctify ourselves for the people's sake yeah that's good no man has a right to preach without first being Sanctified John 17:19 for their sakes I sanctify myself they also might be Sanctified through the truth brother Bram said some of the most precious words in scripture is when Jesus said for their sakes yeah he told a story about a man who had a church that was lean legalist and he said there was something he didn't say what it was he said something they wouldn't allow that that would be fine to do but they didn't that church didn't believe in it and he said the pastor of that church come to him he said he said brother he said you I see you don't do that he said well he said my church doesn't do that he said I believe it would be okay he said but they don't do that he said so I sanctify myself for them brother Brandon said he wanted to grab them and hug them he said that's the way you preach that's the way you do ministry you sanctify yourself for the church you sanctify yourself for the people and listen if we're not willing to do that we shouldn't be preaching boy got quiet and it got hard but it's true I'm preaching at myself within reason right we don't need to make our we don't need to let every little every little legalists run around run the church that's not what I'm talking about but I'm talking about with the body of Believers there's something we know would bring a stumbling block let's just let's just not do it other words he had a right but Joel gets to follow this up tonight praise God brother brand said he had a right he was a man he had a right to a home he had a right to a family he was as much man as you are or I am as much human in his manhood as we are he had a right to it but he was training 12 men that was going to take the gospel to all the world so he Sanctified himself for their sake I sanctify myself for their sake there's a lot of things I do as a pastor I wouldn't have to do but I try to sanctify myself for your sake are you with me now but shouldn't we do that for the world listen as we just lived I'm going Beyond preachers now the BR said oh gifts of God you people who claim that you've received his Spirit keep yourself Sanctified keep away from the things of the world be Sanctified why you're a gift of God to the world you don't know who might be relying on your word you don't know who might make it to Heaven because you were nice to them yes come on oh come on Church there will be a great number the Bible says a number no man can number that pass through Great Tribulation that were not a part of the Bride but they they saw something about you that was real they saw something they your Sanctified life and they say oh God we need to preach sanctification again in the house of God we need to preach Holiness again in the house of God because they see the way you live and they see that there's something there they care about me they care about the church they care about the world it ought to be in our midst I don't know it's quiet but I think it ought it does US good you know it can't always just preach things that everybody agrees with sometimes you got to get down where we live or there's no it don't help us you know we like my kids like it when they go back to school and it's the same stuff that's told me that's the same stuff I had last year man I can speed through that don't even have to listen but when it's something new that's tough isn't it huh it's a it's one of them learning grades I don't know if that even exists but the Justin but that's supposedly my kids told me so some grades are easy I didn't go to school so but only part-time but my kids tell me that there some grades are easier than others you know and and uh at least kind of a repeat grade review grade and I keep thinking about that and thinking God I can't just keep repeating third grade like I did in real life you know I it's the best 10 years of my life but I that wasn't that long I can't keep repeating the same grade as a Christian I need to move forward what don't you want the Ark of God to move forward forward let's move forward we don't want to just keep repeating the same stuff let's move forward let's see what God has for us in this day let's sanctify ourselves for our neighbor sake yeah 1 Chronicles 15:15 says and the children of the Levites bear the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves there on as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their Brethren to be the singers with instruments of music sultes and harps and symbols sounding by lifting up the voice yeah oh my with joy sir that's what brother BR said about them cows that were coming back with the Ark on it he said they were not moaning he said they were Lo they were singing yeah with joy why because they were bringing back the ark and now the ark wasn't going to be carried by cows it wasn't going to be carried on a new ark it was going to be carried under the shoulders of the Levites yes sir and so they come with joy lifting up the voice with joy now David was a musician but he was going to have others play in this meeting CU he was going to lead the procession he had some work to do so David then being a musician he he he made all sure all this was right he ordered the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of song musical instruments musical in I don't want to break your tradition but musical instruments stringed instruments and symbols you know what symbols are that in digital form I you can't hardly here he turn them things up symbols right that's what a symbol is for those of you who didn't know it's drums say in the house of God well when the word comes back yeah come on Amen David uses the equivalent of fiddles sister Millenia is not here this morning but she said I play a violin not a fiddle but David used the equivalent of violins or fiddles guitars and drums that's right that's right look at the verse 17 so the Levites appointed hean the son of hean the son of Joel that's pretty good right there I don't know which one of you that is but of his Brethren as the son of bariah and the sons of marari their Brethren Ethan Ethan the son of kayah with them their Brethren of the second degree Zach see they weren't all on the same level you had starting musicians and backups and that's okay I said God if if you want me to clean the if you want me to clean the sanctuary let me be willing to do it let me be willing to do it I may be a backup listen I realize I I play an instrument I play the guitar and I don't play it well but I've been a backup before I've played with when they needed me right but see that's if I'm needed then God help me to do to put be diligent about and do my best but if I'm not needed thank God because that means there's somebody better by the way we need a guitar player if anybody's interested but if there's you know we we shouldn't let I'll say this if we have a talent we shouldn't hide it let God use it if it' be a blessing to the people of God but but if it's whatever it is there's all always going to be people who are starting people who are second degree people who are third degree people who are like me who right at the very last of the last of the list of musicians you would use right that's going to be there but we still want to be part anyway let's be a part let's show up at practice show up said but I I don't never get to play show up anyway maybe one day you will you don't know everybody else could get struck by lightning you might go to church and say praise God today I get to play you don't know be ready are you a preacher be ready to preach are you a singer be ready to sing are you a backup to the backup to the backup be ready if you're you got a willing heart God's got a place for you amen you young people learn learn to be I I want you to be so good that we can't not use you and be so full of the spirit of God that it projects over your music we can tell when you're when you're in the presence of God and you're playing in the presence of God and we can feel that presence yes sir when you play when you sing the singers he He-Man and Asaf and Ethan were appointed to sound with symbols of brass play the drums had three drum players Zachariah and as and shimar and J and uni and Eliah and Messiah BAH with sultes on alamoth alamoth and and the next verse used the word shth is musical terms so then he the next group of them he play with harps on shim that's a musical term it's been lost to us but they were playing different parts chin and I chief of the Levites was for song oh they had a song leader too he was instructed about the song because he was skillful and I think sometimes we look with suspicion on somebody that's skillful at something I say we shouldn't do that we should let them be skillful but don't let it go to your head I'll say this this chin and I was a regular Colby Martin he was skillful he could play he could sing and bariah and elen were doorkeepers for the ark that's some deacons there too praise God some ushers amen 1st Chronicles 15:24 and Shaniah and Jehoshaphat nethanel and all the others the priest did blow with the trumpets before the Ark of God and Obed obededom and were doorkeepers for the ark what A noise they must have made maybe not the doorkeepers but everybody else ver Chronicles 15:25 so David and the Elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the house of obededom with what Joy with joy yeah with joy and now they can have real Joy before it was just a denominational Revival before they played and they sang in the same way and played with all their might and all of that and danced before the Lord but it wasn't right because the word had not been restored but we live in a day when there's a place prepared for the word when the word has been restored let's bring the ark back with joy there's men and women he said neing right here it's been Christians for years I don't un christianize them what I'm trying to tell them is that the devil it's a haunting them have you ever been haunted by the devil come on be real I've been haunted by the devil before it seemed like every day I woke up he tells me you're no good you're not going to make it you're you're an unbeliever you're you're not even a real Christian every day he haunts you does he he tries to tell you're not worthy you're not going you got too much of a past he haunts you what's he doing he's keeping you out of the full Joy he said they're being haunted by the devil keeping them out of full Joy he said the Holy Ghost is Joy brother I wake up drunk I go to bed drunk I'm drunk all day long drunk all night long what an admission for a preacher to make listen how he's drunk oh I just love I go fishing I'm just pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry yeah I go hunting and singing the Praises of God may not get you many deer but it's it's good isn't it I'm preaching everywhere I go he says I don't don't you want to be that way full of the Holy Ghost it stimulates you or stimulates you as brother Brandon put it it stimulates you Oh my he said it's a joy unspeakable and full of Glory how the old saints of God used to sit around and sing the Redemption Song Sing of the blood and the power of God he said today it's cold and zero nearly he said you don't have them oldfashioned songs you used to sing now listen what kind of oldfashioned songs he liked you don't see their faces light up no more singing not a bunch of sorrowful stuff look like you're in a hostage situation he said singing clap their hands raise their hands to God and praise God and pray all night and lay out in the corn fields and things he said why you can't sit in church 30 minutes without grumbling and growling nip that in the bud didn't we he said it's the truth borderline lukewarm leoan he said my shame on you oh my I sit here not long ago brother Fred and I brother Tom bunch of us went to a noted Baptist Church in the City of Tucson he said we couldn't see if we couldn't find a little something that would give us maybe a little fresh feeling brother Brandon wanted a fresh feeling absolutely he was human just like I am I need sometimes to come to church and get a little fresh feeling that's right and the minister said something another about the people in Egypt when they left they was eating Garlic and so forth they wanted to go back again and eat that he said that's something like people of today he said and we everybody said amen he said I've never seen such a bunch the whole church lost sight of the preacher and look back to see who it was and said amen he said like to scared them to death they didn't know what it was I've been in churches like that you said when David said Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord Praise Him upon Harvest praise him with the Salt Tree let everything that has breath praise the Lord and praise ye the Lord he said God rejoices in his people let them of the learn say Amen when anything is said right when anything is said right he said why not turn from this system and sists of the world to the faithful system of God which is the Artisan well Jesus Christ why don't you turn to him or God is our abundant supply of Joy our abundant Supply in Praises our abundant Supply in satisfaction listen what he says he said the calmness of my nerves comes from God I know that's an Affliction in our day and age yeah I hate sometimes even talking about the news because when it comes up people get nervous such an Affliction in our day he said the calmness of my nerves comes from God when I'm tore up I find my satisfaction in Christ not in a cigarette none of the things of the world not in joining some Creed but in finding him the promised word he said if I go away I'll come again to receive you I find my joy in that he is my joy how many can say Amen to that today I find my joy in him the full word has returned oh my there's joy back in the house of God again hallelujah oh we ought to worship God for that there's joy back in the house of God we don't have to serve God under drudgery we're not serving under slavery we're serving under the power of the Holy Ghost [Music] hallelujah amen that's good Hallelujah verse 26 it came to pass when God helped the Levites to Bear the Ark of the Covenant I love that when God helped them I say God help me when I preach God help me when I carry the word he said when God helped them that they offered a sacrifice and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the Levites said bear the ark and the singers and chinah the song leader with the singers David also had upon him an ought of linen he put on a put a suit on him I'm going go I'm gonna pass on that's all Isel brother Allan's not here this morning so brother Allen he said he put EOD on him brother Allan's going to come up here with a linen shirt on so thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with what shouting did God judge them for that did did an innocent person die no because they carried the Arc of the word right you see what it is it wasn't in the shouting it wasn't that was just a reaction to the word being brought up that was all okay but the problem was how they did it and there is no substitute for the word right I don't care how good a man is how long you've known him how wonderful a Ministry he has if he gets off the word he's off the word that's all there is to it God help us today because there's good men sometimes get off the word but we must stay with the word because that's how we can worship with without condemnation that's how we can love God with all of our heart brother brandom talks about kids p ing notes in church ain't been none of that going on on this front row my goodness these kids are good this morning brother brand talks about the kids doing that you know they pass notes some of y'all would have to move to pass notes but brother brandom talked about that how that made noise in the church and how that should be stopped but he said this he said of course somebody worshiping the Lord that's expected that's where it should be that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord that don't disrupt the service on that's right amen he said just if you feel like praising God or shouting he said just go right on see cuz that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord in your own way of worshiping everybody's got their own way of worshiping we don't condemn you if you sit there and smile we don't condemn you if you shout and run the aisles but we just want you to worship God how according to the way you worship just make sure you're worshiping God wonderful and don't despise others look what happens in verse 29 I know I've gone just a little bit over my time but I'm almost done verse 29 it came to pass as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came to the city of David Michael the daughter saw looking out a window saw King David dancing and playing well number number one why was she watching the stream and not at church she's like I don't feel nothing well you weren't there yeah there's a story behind that I texted somebody was sitting on the platform one recently and he was laughing I texted him because somebody I knew I wasn't at church I was sitting at home I texted him I said what what's so funny you responded back you'd have to be here he was right she she gets on Facebook you know watches the stream like ah look at that Bunch got be careful who we despise amen yeah she despised him in her heart you know David didn't always dance you know that the one time he was so so consumed by the loss of his family you remember the story that he he fell down on his knees to the earth and the people were going to Stone him but then the Bible says he encouraged himself in the Lord no mention of him dancing he just I like to think that David just started just started singing the Psalms he wrote and sometimes the way David encouraged himself was not with not with a bunch of upbeat numbers he had to he had to he had to seeing something that meant something I've been through trials but I know you're still my God I've seen the valley but I know you're the god of The Valleys in the mountains begin to encourage himself in the Lord David didn't always dance sometimes he cried go read the Psalms sometimes he meditated he said I meditated in the night watches on the word but on this occasion he danced why he danced because the word was being restored to its proper place oh brother brand said you say I I can't see those things I don't believe in shouting I don't believe in speaking tongues I don't believe in Divine Healing he said it shows you never got the victory right that's right but one time you get the victory then you got it then you have it he said yes sir then you can shout yeah you see one time I used to think about dancing in the spirit see somebody stand and dance in the spirit he said now I've seen the mockery put on of it but I've seen the real thing too so I come to find out why could people dance in the spirit well he said I've never seen one yet get out of the way see that was dancing in the spirit he said he saw the mockery of it he said I've never seen one in the spirit yet get out of the way never seen one yet act immorally I'll say this the spirit of God will not act immorally said I always see it just as decently and in order and sweetness even Sinners run to the Altar and get saved when it's going on you said well I wondered why it was I come to find out it's victory David danced before the Lord when the ark was brought back to its resting place hey man I want him to rest in me don't you when David brought the ark back he said David rejoiced and danced in the spirit around and around and why he saw the word back in his place yes what the word needs he said it's not out of some Seminary some theological mixup but an oldfashioned God sent preacher behind the pulpit with the word seeing God vindicate proof he said then David said glory to God this is it when did he dance he danced when the word came back when the preaching was going on yeah that'll be my pet Doctrine that's a time to dance but there's a time to dance there was music there too they had that but there was a word being restored that's why he was dancing he's said around and around and around and around his little stuck up wife set up there being the King's Daughter said why he embarrasses me and David said you don't like that watch this round and around he went again oh my what a time he had you know God looked down out of heaven and David you're a man after my own heart why he had done lost all his pride he said yet he was married to a king's daughter but that wasn't even considered then he knew he was acquainted with the possessor of heavens and earth and here was the word of God coming right back among them again and David was so happy he danced he just danced as hard as he could Maryam she grabbed the tambourine went down the bank dancing on the other side after she'd come to the Red Sea and seen her enemies drowned she could dance in the spirit when she seen the enemies that had tormented her dead then she danced in the spirit that's right he said see after after the battle's won then the glory of God comes down we fight a battle during the preaching of the word but when we get to the end of the service that's the time to worship we fought the Battle and won the victory I trust you've won the victory today just by sitting here some of you won the victory over tiredness you won the victory over disease you've won the victory over o over complexes and things just to sit here listen to the word if you've won the victory now it's the time to worship God with all of your heart when I see the open book musicians go ahead and come when I see the open book when I see the word in its place I can dance like David danced my victory is the word and the word has been restored to my heart Let Me dance to dance a victory with David because the ark has returned to his Tabernacle do you believe that today amen amen let's just raise our hands to him and thank him oh Lord Jesus we love you oh we thank you for the word coming back lord I
