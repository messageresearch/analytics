on but i will thank you for your purpose being manifest among us this morning even as we are approaching the wet week without it the meeting cannot be complete we invite you to come among us being the author of the word may you open the seal of the word speak to our hearts help me lord to be able to say that which is needed to be said and to say it in the right way that somebody will be blessed somebody will be healed somebody will believe it vaccine will come back home bless our pastor bless the officers of the church and bless the entire church father we thank you in jesus name we pray amen will you turn with me to galatians galatians the fourth chapter and we want to read from the fourth to the seventh verse galileans i read but when the fullness of the time was come god sent for his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that way under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he our son god has sent from the spirit of his son into your heart crying about father wherefore thou art no more a servant better son and if a son then a hair of god through christ yes may the lord have his breakthrough you may be seated yeah we thank the lord uh for the scripture right this is a well-known scripture unto us and i believe some might have even read it this morning before coming here but they also please god that i speak on the scripture the scripture we ref speaks paul writing this to galileans that when the fullness of time was come you know god has time for everything does everything according to his time that is why we need to wait upon the lord he is never late right he is always on time yes sir when the fullness of time came he sent his son made of a woman made under the law yes to redeem them that way under the lord that we may receive the adoption yes of course yes amen that we might be made sons yes that we might take our positions our sons right he went on to say and because they are sons god sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying about father yes because we were sons we were sung before the foundation of the world right we only lost our position we thank god that he sent his son that we might be redeemed to our original position is there wherefore thou art no more a servant hallelujah we are no longer servants we are sons of god we are doctors of god we no longer serve the devil the devil has no dominion over us the devil has no power over us we are sons of god amen he said and if sons then hear of god through jesus christ then we are hears of god we are here with jesus christ we have we share the same inheritance because we are sons of god this morning i want to speak on another topic knowing who you are knowing who we are it is very important to know who we are if a man knows who he is or she is it influence whatever he does his way of speaking his way of dressing his way of behaving among people shows who he or she is and this can only be done if he knows who he is if maybe a president comes here knowing that he's a president there are certain things he may not do because he knows that he's a president but if he is not or he doesn't know who he is he may do things and people will start questioning is it not the president he's not this man why is he behaving this why is he doing this amen i understand there are many things we do as children of god today is because we forget who we are tonight i want us to know who we are if we know who we are then we know our position and the prophet said our position is our authority amen in a message entitled jesus christ the same yes the prophet made a statement here i want to ask to read he said i've often said i met two classes of people in my times around the world in mission work i met two classes of people one of them is pentecostal the other one is founder mentor the fundamentals positionally know where they stand he takes it by the word i am a son of god by my confession see he positionally takes the stand but he's got no faith in what he is talking about hallelujah they claim they are sons of gods they confess this yes but unfortunately they don't have faith in what they are confessing hallelujah if we don't have faith in what we are confessing then it means that we we don't know what we are saying we must be able to have faith in whatsoever we confess we need to have faith in our position we need to have faith in whom we are then of course we can have authority to act to behave like that person but this class of people the prophet said they don't have faith but they confess yes amen there he got no faith in what he's talking about the pentecostal has no not has the pentecostal has a lot of faith but don't know where this where he stands he don't know who he is it's just like a man has got money in the bank and he don't know how to write a check and the other man write a check and and got money in the bank one class of people the prophet said they have money in the bank but unfortunately for them they don't know how to write the check the other people don't have money in the bank but they have they know how to write a check he's talking about the fundamentals and the pentecostals he said and the fundamentals and and fundamental doctrine or vice versa make the pentecostal realize who they are they are sons and doctors of god already dead buried rose again and sitting in heavenly places have healthy places in christ jesus not you would you are amen [Music] we need to know who we are even like the prophet said the fundamentals and the pentecostals there's something yes that is lacking lacking in the two of them they all lack something but i want to say this morning that we need to have a money in the bank and we need to know how to write a cheque yes amen is that if the two come together yes then we are sons and daughters of god and hearts of the kingdom we have to claim our rights amend we don't allow the devil to press us down we are the children of god god said it he made it and the devil has no right the prophet said he said there are many that are looking at signs or symptoms yes even though the pastor prayed for them they come back when they are asked how do you feel he said somehow i'm feeling better they are still looking at signs they are still looking at symptoms yes the devil always uses symptoms against us but sometimes have nothing to do once god said you are healed you are healed once god said you are delivered you are delivered yes one god said you are a son of god you are a son of god we need not to look at the symptoms the symptoms are deceitful the symptoms discourages us the symptoms take us from claiming the promises of god if we go to the days of jonah the scripture made us to know that god called jonah as his servant and sent him to the ninevites to go send a message to them pray to them that they shall repent for god is going to destroy the land the scripture said you're not god ready he took off for the journey but unfortunately for jonah when he arrived at where he was going to take the boat the prophet said he thought of going to vacation in taxes instead of going to nineveh because jonah was a jew and he was sent to the gentiles so the brother said his intention was because god was judging them in 40 days he waits when the days are getting closer then he will go and then when he goes when he preaches they will believe it so when he arrived [Music] at the seaside or the riverside instead of going to take the boat going to to nineveh he took the bulls going to taxes and the scripture said along the line god started hunting him he was running from the presence of god we can run from the presence of god heaven is his throne earth is his fulfilled where can we run from where can we run to from the presence of god jonah thought he was running from the presence of god and the scripture said god started started hunting him and there was tom they did all they could but nothing happened finally they thought of casting a lot knowing very well that he was running from the presence of god he went and hit under the boat having a nice time there relaxing the scripture said they cast a lot in the front of that there's somebody and the lot felt on jonah when it fell on jonah jonah knew what was happening he could have prayed but he never prayed but because he knows that it is not a matter of praying it is a matter of restitution it is a matter of doing what god wanted him to do yes sir so all he told them was i am the cause and the only way we can save the situation is to throw me into the sea jonah was not a simon jonah may not know how to swim but they buy his hands they burn his feet and he threw him into the sea the scripture said in the sea he started praying hallelujah and when he prayed god sent a feast to come and swallowed him and in the feast bella the prophet said jonah could have looked to the symptoms or he could have looked into the belly of the fish but jonah did not look at this he looked at the promise of god he looked at the word of god because when solomon was dedicating the temple he prayed that every jew that would be in trouble wherever he is if he can turn to the temple and pray god should answer him so jonah in the fishbelly managed to turn to the direction of the temple hallelujah and the prophet said jonah could have looked at the symptoms he could have looked at the condition in which he was and this condition would have discouraged him but he did not look at the condition but he looked at the promises of god he looked at what god said brethren and says the lord it is time we stop looking at the symptoms and look at the promises of god he that has made the promise he is able to fulfill it even though he carries he will surely do it because he is god praise the lord jonah started praying and the prophet said god instructed the fish that he should send jonah to navy and at that time the fishermen the universe they were fishermen they were washing their nets out of seaside behold their fish came around and the prophet that fish was the fish that they worshiped and when he came informing jonah jonah preached they believed they prayed they fasted they were so close and god also repented from heaven god stopped what he was going to do brendan said lord the prophet said jonah could have looked at the symptoms he was bind his feet was burned his legs were bind his hands were burned but he never looked at the symptoms sometimes when we look at the symptoms it discourages it makes us not to have faith it brings doubt into our life and as a result the promises of god cannot be made manifest in our life brethren say lord it depends on what we are looking at amen don't look at who you are but look at the promises of god look at the covenant that god has made with you amen he thought himself in calvary and he swore by himself he took his body to heaven and he returned his spirit upon us he gave us his spirit back the spirit of god is in the church to lead the church the same life that was in christ is in the church now is in the church this morning in the form of the holy spirit going to perform the very things that he performed what he was here on earth because he's the same yesterday today and forever we got a promise we got a covenant let us know that we are covenant men we are not just an ordinary people we are covenant people we are sons and doctors of god we need to know who we are we need to know our position we need to know our calling we need to know hallelujah what god is doing in our life that is what gives us the authority amend if you don't know who you are you continue to fail and the devil will torment you yes but if you know who you are you realize who you are it makes a devil mad when a child of god a daughter of god realize who he or she is it makes the devil mad hallelujah and it gives us fit it gives us authority it gives a power hallelujah and when we are praying we pray with faith we pray with assurance because we pray as children of god for we know where we are standing and we know our position our position in christ is our power this morning if you can know your position you know your power you can speak the prophet said we can create even another world we can create an atmosphere if we know who we are our problem is not the word of god our problem is not the message our problem is not our brother our problem is not our sister our problem is not our dickens our problem is not our pastor our problem is we do not know who we are let us pray that god give us a revelation about who we are the prophet said when we have a revelation when the church gets a true revelation it becomes an invisible army that is why the devil doesn't like revelation but we like revelation because by revelation we defeat the enemy by revelation hallelujah we doubt every we will reject every lie of the devil we need revelation we like revelation but the devil hates revelation because with revelation we know the tatties of the devil and the prophet said to overcome the devil is to know the tactics of the devil we are overcomers yes event he overcome for us and we are living in that overcoming spirit satan don't care about who you are if you don't know your position satan don't care about your jumping up and down it will still lay there but when you move from there and you come to know who you are as a child of god it gives you faith and then you can now enjoy the blessings of god you can enjoy the healings you can enjoy the deliverance you see the power of god in your life you see god moving in your life when you know who you are amen and every unbelief will be taken away my brother my sister unbelievably sin if we don't know who we are then we live in sin yes and when we know who we are then hallelujah the devil cannot do anything or somebody asked brother brown a question he said can every son of god be anointed to he can do miracles can every son of god be anointed till he can do miracles signs and wonders amen let us listen to what the prophet said or is it just is this the direction of the holy ghost the prophet said yes it is the direction of the holy ghost if you are a son of god or a doctor of god whatever you are when you have received the holy ghost then the holy ghost will direct you to do things hallelujah when we receive the holy ghost as sons and daughters of god the holy spirit will direct us to do things yes then we don't behave anyhow we wait upon the spirit of the lord the scriptures as many of us are led by the spirit of god they are sons and doctors of god we need the leadings of the spirit in this difficult time that we are living we need the holy ghost to lead us to direct us it is only by the holy ghost that we can please god it is only by the holy ghost that we can do his will it's only by the holy ghost hallelujah that the mind of jesus christ can be revealed to us yes it is only by the holy spirit that we can hear his voice we are living a time when there are many voices yes there are voices of jesus there are verses of men but to hear the the voice of god it takes the holy spirit to hear the voice of god and the voice of god to the children of god is a special thing that is what we need amen therefore as children of god we will be led by the spirit of god we have to realize who we are amen he is among us this morning is that where two three are gathered in my name there i am and he's here he's here to meet us at the point of our need he's here to do something special in our life and the only way he can do it is we have to give him the avenue we have to allow him we have to accept him we have to believe him we have to come out from every doubt and know who we are oh my brother my sister don't forget who you are amen once we are born again our sons and daughters of god we are madame jesus yes hallelujah we are mrs jesus and if we are missing jesus yes that we share his truth with him we share his power with him we share his authority with him what he has we have it because we are his wife our wife share our property with us i will share what we have they shared with us so it is with christ if we can recognize if we can know if we can realize that we are the bride of jesus christ living in this end time then we are a special people we can live above sin sin can no longer influence us sin cannot dominate us we will be influenced from our path and we know that we are from a different place that's right brethren this is the lord he promised us and he will fulfill his promise let us not listen to what the devil is saying the devil is a liar he only bluffs right we are co-equal with jesus we are in his presence satan doesn't have any right of doing anything because in cavalry he was stripped off yes and the scripture said the last word that jesus said was it is finished yes it is finished i want to assure you this morning that your problem is finished when we said something is finished it means it is ended jesus said it is finished at the cross it says it is finished our sit next problem is finished our sin problem is finished everything is finished the devil has no right the devil has no power the devil is just lying it is finished amen once it is finished the devil has no legal right anymore in our life no sir the only thing that is left for us is to believe is to know our position many a times we say it is the devil that has done this it is the devil that has done this it is the devil that has done it let us leave the devil alone for the devil cannot do anything in the life of a child of god no even though god permits the devil to do it god will give it a limit yes the prophet said god can use the devil against the disobedient children of god but god would give him a limit like god gave him a limit in the life of job he said you can destroy everything but you don't have right to his life so we saw the devil did everything to europe but the devil could not take job away because god has given it a limit my brother my sister the devil has no legal right in the life of a child of god therefore let us stop magnifying the devil it is the devil it is the devil no if you knew your position the devil can do nothing in your life oh and my sickness and my headache has come back again my bodily pain has come back again my whispering has come back again it shows that you are making that demon your possession the prophet said he said every sickness is a demon even though they might give it a scientific name at the end of the day is the devil in action therefore if we continue to say my sickness my headache my waistband my body pains [Music] then we are still maintaining the devil in our homes in our life now as children of god we have right to cast the devil away to speak yes and stop everything that the devil is doing in our life every sickness every trouble every demon every problem we can speak yes and it will be done hallelujah but before we can speak we need to know who we are amen we need to know we are believers we need to know that the sting of death that the devil got has gone the devil has no strings any longer amen oh my brother my sister let us look at calvary we can show the devil the resurrection the scripture says we reckon ourselves dead we are buried with him in the baptism into his death and we were raised with him in the resurrection now that we are going to be raised with him we are already raised with him and where are we now the scripture said we are with him in the heavenly places at the right hand of god and that is the authority of god amen we are sitting with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus we need to realize that heaven is our place even though we are sitting here this morning we are sitting in the heavenly places as believers we need to take our position in christ we need to stand by our position in christ we need to demonstrate the power of the resurrection and make the devil know that we know who we are and make the devil know we know our position and make the devil know that we know that it has no power amen oh my brother and sister the devil is defeated is defeated every form that is making itself manifest is defeated but our problem is we do not know you know in africa we do buy chickens say you go to the market to buy a chicken you buy the lake and when you buy the lake and you bring it back home you lose the leg but sometimes because the chicken has stayed so long in that rope even though you lose the rope the chicken things is still being bind and it will lie there quietly even though you push it it will not go in his mind i am still being bind that is the problem of many children of god today they've been delivered yes but because they have suffered so much in in their life and it has created something in their mentality they never knew that they has been delivered they have been loosed they still stand as if they are still buying my brother my sister what the bride of christ needs today is to know who he is and the word that christ has done for us the prophet said he said to sin you know you will not be condemned for that because sin is unbelievable he said we'll be condemned because the work that christ did for us we don't recognize it we don't accept it and because of that we crucify him the second time it's because we are not conscious of what he has done for us we don't know he has delivered us we don't know he has made a sense and doctors of god that is where we are living under the privileges that god has given us instead of living above the privileges we are living hallelujah under the privileges oh what we need today is to know who we are to know our position in christ we should know that we have been delivered we should know that we have been saved we should know that the devil cannot do us anything any longer the devil will just bluff the devil is just like a lion that has no teeth in his mouth it can only rule but it cannot do anything and remember in africa there's a tribe there are cows but they have mouth when you have problem with them they'll be jumping going forward coming back if you don't take care i'll kill you now i'll stamp you i'll do you this and you'll be frightened it's only muff they are just boasting if you can stand they will run away from you that is what the devil is this morning the devil is a defeated food if we can tell the devil you are defeated in my life you are defeated in my family you are defeated in my home you are defeated in my business you don't have any right again we will start enjoying the blessings of god amen hallelujah know your position praise the lord we have got the power of god in our life to do things we could speak the world into existence we have powers church the scriptures say what we buy on earth will be bound in heaven god has given his church authority god has given us as children of god sons of god authority he has given us power if we can use them the devil will be defeated anywhere in the ground in any condition all things are possible to them that believe the prophet said we are not called to reason with the word of god we are called to believe the word of god and if we can believe what god says all things are possible and the child of god must be a believer must believe every promise of god must believe every word of god every promise in the bible is ours yes and we have to take it and hope and take god by his word yes it is only when we know who we are god promised joshua he said whatever the soul of your faithful truth will become yours and the prophet said that promise has not gone it has not ended up with jesus right it's still today that every son and doctor of god wherever our feet will truth will become ours amen once we are saved and we are children of god and we know who we are we can overcome the enemy and the scripture said faith is arbitrary and by faith we can overcome the world we're going to overcome the devil we can change things harry lawyer the prophet said he said entirety is not in heaven the deity is in a believer and he went on to say the believer does not pray to god in heaven we pray to god that is in us yes and if the deity is in us and god is in us then whatsoever we pray for we need to believe that we have it yes and we need to realize that the almighty god lives in our life then we have right to life and we have right to everything we have right to every promise of god amen then we know who we are and if we know who we are then we can leave our best scene the prophet said we are loosed from sin and sin has no longer dominion over us we are our best sin sin has no power over us we can make mistakes anyway but thank god that the blood of jesus christ forgive us all our mistakes forgiveness of our sins a sinner that is one page has no more desire for sin he can make a mistake but he cannot sin hallelujah brethren say lord when christ came here he came according to the word of god but before he could exercise his authority he must believe all that the scripture said about him he must act upon the scripture he said i do nothing i said that which i see the father has done i do nothing except what the scriptures says about me he told the pharisees and the sadducees you claim you know the bible and you read the bible and in them you have eternal life examine it examine what i'm doing and see if i'm not doing what this creature said i would do none of you can condemn me he had faith in what the word of god says about him and that is what we need today if the word of god says you are a child of god you have to believe that you're a child of god no matter who you are no matter the condition in which you are once god has said it believe it yes and when you believe it when god says you are healed believe it and once you believe it and you go confessing it your body will obey it and you see it fulfilled in your life so jesus has to believe what the scripture says about him and we also need to believe what the scripture says about us even god himself the brother said in the message entitled the sixth sense is that when god spoke the word for the word to be fulfilled he delivered it is let it be light and he believed it and it was light yes our problem today is that we are not seeing what god has done for us our problem today is we are not believing what god said about us oh there is power in what god says about us if only we can believe it if we can rely upon the word of god another compounds idea not of our idea but what the word of god says about ourselves what the word of god has made us if we can believe it hallelujah we are always overcomers nothing of the devil can pull us down no as believers let us rely on what god has made us he has made the sons and daughters of god it is not our making it is not your making it is not my making the scripture said at the fullness of time he sent his son because we were sown we were in him before the foundation of the world and the prophet said once we are sung and we were him we have always been songs and at the right time he brought us up and nothing can change us a sound is a song like the prodigal son he left he took his share of the inheritance he went and lived in a life that he thought he could leave but he lose the properties but he could not lose his sonship when he came back when the father saw him after the scripture said he said this my son was dead but now he's alive he's come back again oh my brother my sister once you are a son and a doctor of god nothing can take you out of it if you back light at all at the appropriate time god will bring you back but the scripture said the father said let us feast let us make merry because our son was dead but now he is alive he couldn't lose his sonship you cannot lose your sonship stop listening to the devil stop listening to the life of the devil you cannot lose it once you are son you are a son once you are a doctor you are a daughter of god before you were part of him he knew you before the foundation of the world and at the right time the right disposition he brought you up amen and not only are we his sons but we are his wife we are married to him we are married to the word and we are living in the word we are living in christ and if we are living in christ who is perfect then we are also perfect oh my brother my sister there is nobody that can condemn you once you are in christ even the devil the prophet said before the devil can do you something the devil need to go through these processes devil need to repent the devil needs to be justified the devil needs sanctification and the devil needs the baptism of the holy spirit before it can come to where you are and once the devil goes to this prophet these processes before he reaches you it becomes your brother he becomes your sister amen oh my brother my sister we need to know who we are that is our problems if we know who we are then we can be identified with jesus christ we can be identified with the word then we can stand in the word because we are sons the scripture said he sent the spirit of his son into our hearts because we are sons because we've been sons because we are always sounds he sent the spirit of his sons into our hearts christ came and died to have this purpose accomplished to restore it back to our original position our position of being sonship our possession of some being sons of god being the test of god he came and he paid the price hallelujah and he purchased us he redeem us back to our position as sons and doctors of god all we need is to accept it yes all we need is to believe it all we need is to walk into it all we need is to walk by it all we need is to confess it all we need is to believe it all we need is to see it oh brother sister a gift is not a gift until it is received yes amen the brothers a pardon is not pardoned until it is received as a pardon oh my brother my sister we need to recognize who we are we need to know our position we need to know who we are the scripture says because we were sons not because we are going to be songs because we were sung he sent the spirit of sonship into our hearts hallelujah oh this morning he has a purpose in your life yes whether you are small whether you are big whether you are important whether you are not important no matter who you are hallelujah he has a purpose in your life that is why he brings you here this morning there are people in the churches they think that we are nothing yeah i want to tell you this morning that you are something god needed you here that is where he brought you here i remember there was i had a problem at home we left the key in the room and we locked the door there's no way we can get to the room and we didn't have the spare key but at home the windows we do it with bar and there are space inside just to avoid the teeth from breaking into it so finally what we thought was we have our little child we carried it we put the head through the bar and the head went through so we managed and put the child through the window through the bar and the child went there to go and pick the key where the key was the child went and picked the key brought it we receive it and we opened the door i asked myself that day there is nobody that we can say is of no use this little child has saved us from this embarrassment this little child has saved us from breaking the door buying another lock we couldn't do it because we are too big to go through the window but that little child our child was small at that age and it could go through to go bring the key all i want to say this morning is don't look down upon yourself don't underestimate yourself don't say i am nothing you are something you are special to god he has your name written in the land book of life before the foundation of the world because of you he came down because of you he went to calvary he took your place instead of you being condemned instead of you being being crucified he said no let me take his place bring all his accusation upon me everything that he did put it into my account and he died for us oh my brother my sister paul looked at it and he said we are expensive because we are bought with the price recognize who you are recognize your position i always say if we recognize our position we recognize who we are that's not going to be fine there's not going to be quadrant there's not going to be a problem we will fit to where god wants us to be we will not start impersonation we will not start copying somebody because we know what we are able to do we know what our brother is able to do we know we need our brother and he also need us in a way that is how god made it therefore this morning no matter who you are whether you are little whether you are big whether you are poor whether you are rich whether you are important whether you are not important we are all sons and daughters of god jesus when he was here he spoke of a rich man who wanted to celebrate the feast marriage field for the doctor and what he did was he make sure that he has dresses packed at the gate whosoever comes to the feast must go through the gate you remove your dress whether it be expensive dress whether it's poor you remove it and they'll give you a dress there anyone that comes through the door has to receive address and the prophet said that dress is the holy spirit he wants everybody to be of the same yes the same position the same dress there's no there's not going to be discrimination there's not going to be a big man there's not going to be a slow small man but unfortunately for a man instead of passing through the gate he he climbed over and when the fist was at his peak this man went around and he saw him he said gentleman by which way did you come in he said i climb over he ordered his servants to bind him by leg by feet by hands and threw him into total darkness and the prophet said that there's only one way and that is jesus christ we cannot come by any other way he said i'm the life the truth and the way the life and the truth no one comes to the father except by me if we can go through the door then we are all going to be dressed alive don't underestimate yourself know who you are this morning live by your god-given privileges the brother said when we repented when we believed christ all that we need for the journey he gave it to us as a package all that we needed to to to travel the way he gave us to us as a package therefore let us recognize ourselves let us recognize who we are as i bring my meeting to an end of my sermon to an end my question is do we know who we are let us come out let us away from our slumber and let us know our position let us know who we are and let us believe who we are let us not allow the devil to deceive us in any way the devil is always a liar there has never been a liar like the devil it will continue to deceive and to lie yes it's a devil it's a liar to begin with and it will continue lying
