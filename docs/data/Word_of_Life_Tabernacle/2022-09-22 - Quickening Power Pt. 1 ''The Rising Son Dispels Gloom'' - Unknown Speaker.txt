word would be so clear to us Lord that we could never deny it but Lord we would always say Lord that you are Risen Lord and you are risen in our lives we thank you for that I pray you bless the word Lord and may you hold my tongue keep me from saying those things that I shouldn't say Lord I'll say only those things that I should we pray in Jesus name amen and God bless you turn with me to Mark chapter 16 tonight Mark chapter 16 verses 1 and 2 and then Romans 8 11 I'm going to take an Easter text and we're going to look at this for some time and you might be as you're turning in your Bibles you're thinking brother Ben doesn't know what time of year it is but actually Easter is every every day it's a resurrection we honor the resurrection of the Lord and I thought this was appropriate or may spend a few weeks on it I want to study from the sermon it is the rising of the sun brother random subject in that sermon was the quickening powers what I want to call this he preached out on April 18 1965. we're going to look at some of the things brother Branham said I think it's appropriate for the time that we live in even for the time of year because it's the fall say well why would that be appropriate for the fall because it's when things are dying that's when you need to know that there's life on the other side yeah right and I think as you reach that time of your life or or as the ebb and flow of Life comes and goes that that we need to know there's a quickening power and there's something more than just church churchanity than just coming to church and being here but there's got to be a life on the inside of us so I want to look at that tonight and so let's go to Mark 16 and 1 and it says and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Shalom bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun and then Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this evening there's so many questions today as to what the holy spirit is and what it does that I thought we would go to this sermon and study it I want to stay as as balanced as we can and and and and try to uh get the thought of the sermon across to you and point out some things as we have time that I'm so grateful that I wasn't my responsibility to bring the message and just my responsibility to preach it and so I can take my time I'm not I'm not hurried in that way as far as getting a message out we have the message and but it's my responsibility to get it to you and your responsibility to receive it not just from me but from the messenger of the hour and and we know ultimately the messenger was Christ right not that brother Branham and his flesh was Jesus Christ but the messenger was Jesus Christ speaking through a prophet and so we need to recognize our day and our hour and understand where we're at and why we preach the things that we do this is a message church we need to preach the message right and so we're going to do that to the best that we can and and and like I said sometimes we uh we we preach as as ministers we present a certain side of the message or a certain uh slant on it based on our own personality but I don't want to do that I I want to try our best to present the gospel and declare the whole Gospel of Jesus Christ and that's why sometimes I know you you probably get whiplashed because we're going back and forth from teaching and preaching and doing the things that we do and using the other Ministries that we do but I think it's necessary you you may like steak but you can eat steak all the time well some people do but uh it it you know it's just probably in the end not as healthy as if you'd have a balanced diet and and so we want to have a balanced diet don't we and what do we feed on we're Eagles aren't we we feed on the word we feed on the words of God and so we want to get into that word now this sermon was preached two years after the seals so you can believe it you can if you're the of the persuasion you can't believe anything before the steals but I don't believe that I think brother random was always a prophet when he preached the things that he did and but he grew in his understanding and so as we get to the end uh towards the end of brother random's life he uh this is to the spot where he has matured and is understanding in his teaching and you'll notice that as we go through some of these things and and but brother Branham didn't stop believing in the Holy Ghost after the seals he didn't stop believing and having church and and going to church and serving God and and calling people to an altar and laying hands on the sick in fact brother Branham did more of some of those things after even than he did before and and so we're going to show some of that as well so brother Branham begins that sermon and he begins by calling attention to the picture of the cloud and it's Cloud that was in Life Magazine we put it up here you may have it there in the back to put up on the middle screen but it's the cloud that was in Life magazine and and what it does it's a sign it's not that the cloud is any particular virtue in itself but brother Branham if you go and look at these sermons later in his life he's constantly calling attention to that and he says this he said now he said they asked to know he said science one of them in Tucson wanted to know any significance so they reached out to brother random for that he said but I didn't tell them he said you all knew it told beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you he said and so there he spoke to me he said and said the Seven Seals will be open the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed so he's saying that when that cloud was there he said he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be revealed he said and we yet a humble little group I I think we could identify with that tonight we yet a humble little group compared with all the world he said we've enjoyed now notice how he puts it now in past tense he said we've enjoyed these blessings hearing those Mysteries right so people try to tell you well some of them have been revealed and some of them haven't and so much of it's been revealed he said we have we have enjoyed these blessings these Mysteries that's that we've heard these mystery that's been revealed he said marriage divorce serpent seat right all of that the the understanding of all of that was revealed at the opening of the seals he said he said marriage divorce serpent seed all these different questions has been completely revealed to us someone say completely completely revealed to us so we don't have to re-reveal it right it's been completely revealed but there's so much that we can get into so much we can be a part of and we need to be a part of it I would say this if you're a Christian of struggling and maybe you say well brother Ben here you are preaching on doctrinal things that I'm struggling with my life and and just trying to serve the Lord and and get a get ahead a little bit on my paycheck and I'm struggling with the everyday things of life but I think you'll learn as you go along in life that if you would if you would grab a hold of the mysteries of God you'd grab a hold of the of the deep things of God that will actually help you in those other areas of your life because you realize this is not the end and this is not what I'm here for this is not what it's all about the everyday mundane things of life and we'll deal with those things too as we did on Sunday but we need to know who God is and and what he is and and his nature and what he does we need to have an understanding of that in order to make it in this age this is our age this is for us this is bride food are you hearing me today this is bride food and the bride ought to want to eat bright food amen I know I want to eat it you get some food that I like I've never liked peanut butter I don't want anything to do with it I've never tasted it or they don't smell good so I've never eaten peanut butter so you can put all the peanut butter out here you want to I'd starve to death I was in the Philippines and and we've been gone for out preaching all day and I come back at night and I had a friend who was flying in he'd gotten delayed for a couple days in Japan he didn't like Japanese food I'd have been perfectly happy in Japan but the McDonald's was closed in Japan so at the airport where he was so he never ate well he was there for two days and he gets in late one night and we're sitting there on top of a roof in the Philippine islands and and I'd preached all day it's about midnight and host there the brother that was keeping us he ran downstairs he wanted to find something we could eat so he went downstairs he got a big old jar of Jif peanut butter and a spoon and that's what we had Jif peanut butter and a spoon I didn't eat any of it I was hungry but not that hungry right because it wasn't something I liked if you find yourself not like well I could take church or leave it you need to find something you like and if you don't like the word there's a problem there ought to be a hunger and a desire I didn't want nothing to do with the peanut butter but you put a nice steak in front of me you put some mango in front of me I love the mango brother sister Tracy got me a mango here a while back I love the mango but I out you can take the peanut butter and give me the mango why because it's something I like this is something I like right the open book is something that I like I like to eat it and it ought to means something to us amen we ought to like it now excuse me for getting off on that tangent now he said I'm getting to that place Brother David where I get a little self-conscious because I know you've all heard these stories before so whenever you tell that story you know I know I've told that two three times so y'all forgive me I thought only old pastors did that and washed up but you know now brother Branham says he said he spoke to me there and we've enjoyed these Mysteries and he said it's been completely revealed to us not by man noticed but by God yeah not by man but by God himself he said brother Ben how could brother Branham say that well what does the Bible say the lamb opened the seals the Bible does not say that brother Branham opened the seals lamb opened the seals and then he took the Revelation and showed it to his Prophet messenger but it was a lamb who broke the seals so he said these things have not been revealed to us by man and that's why so many people are they're still not revealed to them because it takes a revelation from God he said by God himself that's opened those seven Mysteries again I don't know how you get past this that's open to those seven Mysteries past tense of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days now there's a there's a Doctrine today that brother Branham was God's voice he was his human voice when he was speaking just like he would speak to you but then when he uh when a tape recorder was turned on as soon as the the switch was flipped he become God's voice that that was God's voice speaking so whatever he said then would be infallible now that would be all right except brother Branham didn't teach us that and we need to always remember that okay and and if he didn't teach us that we need to be careful now what they're teaching that but listen what brother Branham had to say about it if he approached the word now in this sermon he said now he said I want you to you to turn in your Bibles as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word he said I always read that he said because it my words my words it's the word of a man it will fail but the word of God can never fail aren't you glad for a prophet that told us the truth now we can take that back to the scripture and something that I want to do as we go through this as we did with the breach I want to I want to although this won't take nearly as long but I want to go back and show you uh in the scripture some of these things that brother Branham references or alludes to but we want to actually pick up the scripture itself and and pull it out because we want you to know he's a word Prophet if he wasn't he couldn't be a prophet he wouldn't be the messenger to the age the fact that he's a messenger the age means it has to come from the Bible his authority was not to write a new Bible although he was a prophet a major prophet but that wasn't what God commissioned him to do he was commissioned to open this open the book and and show us what was there to shine a light on the scripture that was already written so it was not to write a new book so Matthew 24 35 said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away aren't you glad for that when the world's shaking and everything's going down and everything's turning loose and everything else we can look at it and say my words shall not pass away you know if you go and study I've been studying the book of Kings if you go and study in Elijah's Ministry you look at the things Elijah prophesied some of them didn't take place for years later and then it was taking place in a way that you wouldn't have suspected based on the prophecy itself because of the things that God told Elijah to do and he didn't even do it himself other men did it later on in another time in another place but the prophecy was still fulfilled and so we don't need to get discouraged about these things God sent a prophet in our day and and there's certain things that are spoke but we don't have to spend so much time worrying about what they are or how to place them but just let God fulfill his word it'll be fulfilled every word of God is fulfilled it does not fall to the ground void aren't you glad for that today that means that your life isn't void that it's not meaningless it means something so he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away brother Branham goes on and I I skipped through some of this because it relates directly to Easter the day but he talks about the importance of Easter and how he should put it in its proper place and but he says this he said as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on Thursday on Friday we should take the communion now we look at this in the message and I know there's churches that maybe somebody wouldn't go to a certain church because they don't take communion every month or some wouldn't go to a certain church because they did and and and there might be a difference over wind at washed feet and and so that's what brother Brown was talking about some people want to say once a year on Friday we should take the communion and they just think you're a real sinner if you don't take communion on Good Friday and some people have different doctrines that they've made up about that and but that's not the life that's not going to get you to heaven yeah yeah and that's brother Brown's point in this sermon he's saying he said some say we should wash feet once a year on Thursday on Friday we should take the communion we you know we get to decide that as a church body but that's not the life how many services we have on Sunday one or two or five brother Isaac's going to three right now I don't know why he's going to three services on Sunday but two's just not enough for him so he runs down to another place and must be some really good preachers down there and and uh has a third service on Sunday but but you know and there's maybe some other things driving him to do that but but that's not what it's about right that's not what it's about it's not about our doctrines of how many services we should have or when to wash feet or or those things that we're taught to do it right right but that's not what it's about he said they argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be a Sabbath day or the first day of the week he said all these things are just merely tradition he said what good would any of it do you whether you had lint or not lint if there's no life in you oh God you imagine I I used to work at Burger King I know we would always stock up on fish sandwiches for Lent because the people were still going to eat but they were going to give up red meat so here were the all the Catholics and the lutherans would come through on lent and they would order fish sandwiches at Burger King which was the worst fish sandwich in the business but that's beside the point but we would stock up a lint so we knew when lent was coming because they were going to come in and order fish sandwiches sometimes we didn't even carry them the rest of the year but you carry them around lint you'll see them advertising why people think they put their faith in that but that's not where we put our faith we don't put our faith in how many times we wash feed and how many times we go to church or any of that we put our faith in the life it's about the life yeah and that's why we can take an Easter sermon and preach it in September because it's not about the the tradition of it it's about the life he said if there's no life in you it's only a memorial yeah which there's nothing against it but they've certainly carried out their Traditions but left off the main thing oh that's not an indictment of people today and and I would say even as message people many times we carry out our Traditions to the letter but have we left off the main thing well I pray that we have and I pray that that we have Christ amen we have that life Satan listen this is a famous quote you've heard it before but I think now you'll see it maybe in the context of it he said Satan doesn't care how religious you are right or how right you are in your Doctrine right Doctrine is still the letter that kills yeah he wasn't talking about false Doctrine when he said the letter kills that's its job is to kill to make you feel guilty to make you aware of what's Happening that's the job that's the right Doctrine that's the job of it but that's not what we rely on but it's to life amen the letter kill us but the spirit brings life it's the life so the doctrine yes it has to be right but right Doctrine the devil don't even care about that how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life amen you won't come up anyhow right what good is a bunch of letters and you've got everything right and you studied and you your Theologian and you got everything just right but it won't get you out of a grave because every one of us is going down there one of these days if we don't go in a Rapture brother Danny we're going down in the ground yeah they're going to put us and throw dirt on top of our Graves every one of us none of us are exempt from that and none of us know when it'll happen either yeah none of us have any idea about that and so we live this life the best we can live it we live between the lines if you've ever looked at a tombstone there's a date here there's a date here this is when they were born this is when they were taken off the Earth but in between that that's what you live what was the life that's what he wants to know that's what he's concerned with yes yes what was the life what kind of a life do we live in the middle oh my he said no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again yep do we see people today putting putting emphasis and making a Doctrine out of not just having church but when to have church or not just having a preacher but which preacher yeah that's not the life the life is not going to a certain church or hearing a certain preacher even a good message preacher you don't have life because you hear me preach many people have heard me preach and died and and not made it yeah that's just a sad reality of life yeah I've I've preached for 25 years of my life and I've preached to many people who probably never make it most people that Jesus preached to probably didn't make it but they didn't get the life but if you can get the life regardless of which preacher you hear regardless of what church you go to if you can get the life you want to feed on the word you'll want to go to church you'll want to live for God you'll want to stand for the message of the hour but it's not about the tokens and the I mean the the physical tokens of all that it's the token the life of Jesus Christ that's right now he said it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again therefore if God raised up Jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this Resurrection morning only one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this well it's Wednesday night for the band I can't get too excited but are we benefactors of his resurrection he said what does it mean to me I think that's a good question yeah yeah what does it mean to you he said now we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me he said that was 2 000 years ago if we're not careful these things become history and they become a good history lesson have become a tradition but the brown calls it a family tradition that when they would go and lay their hands on the Lamb on the head of the Lamb they were supposed to feel that there was supposed to be a feeling in it but he said they they lost the feeling of it and become a family tradition didn't mean anything to him and so they began to bring the Blind and the crippled and and all these lesser sacrifices to God there's got to be a life inside of us that makes us want to go to church for the right reasons makes us want to serve God for the right reasons makes us want to read our Bibles for the right reasons makes us hunger and thirst after the things of God oh my there's got to be a life yeah there's got to be something there and I would say again if you don't love the word you need to check up because entertainment will take it away from you the world will take it away from you it'll make you so uh the devil has a way of making your life so busy that your soul your mind is so clouded but it's this life that dispels the Gloom when you get a revelation of the life when you when you see it when you allow it to become your your focal point in your life that's when it dispels all those other things begins to melt away the fog and the things but the devil do everything he can I can't tell you all the things the devil has done over the past two days to try to cloud my mind so I couldn't preach to you on a Wednesday night just a tremendous amount of things that the devil's tried to do over one thing after another after another what is it it's the things of life that's the devil's job but it's our job to look past that look away from the things look away from the things that we can see look away from the temporal things look away from Hollywood look away from the things of the world look away from our jobs and say Lord I know you are the life huh I don't know why I'm dwelling on that today maybe it's because I've been through it I know what it's like as a preacher to get to where you're not hungry anymore you just don't you just don't want to there's something not anything there to really want to search for God you got to shake yourself out of that and the thing is it's because your diet has become too rich and the things of the world and you end up you you've gorged yourself and I'm not speaking to any one individual tonight like I said that's happened to me at times in my life you Gorge yourself on the things of the world not bad things just things and it doesn't mean anything to you anymore and you're not excited about it but what what does it mean to me what does it mean to you he said now we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was two thousand years ago so that was brother branham's introduction to this sermon it is the rising of the sun which actually the title is the quickening power it is the rising of the sun was his text and he goes back to the beginning of time it's always a good place to start a sermon because the possibilities are endless he goes back to the beginning of time but we used to joke that you knew when a preacher was going to be long-winded when he started in Genesis 1. well here we go Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light now brother Branham said now the son at the rising of the sun he said well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form was void it was all covered with water was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere he's talking about you and I and you'll watch as brother random parallels this he's not talking just about the world he's talking about you and I there was a time when we were laying in utter Darkness we were without form void who covered over with water we were laying in a dark get some gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light now God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water I love this there was seeds that he had planted Hallelujah and it had to have that sunlight to make it live right and so the seed was there even in the darkness even in the Gloom even the fog and everything that was on it it couldn't it didn't it didn't manifest itself at all in fact when the random goes on later in the summer to talk about how it has to have rot it has to die completely it did not could not manifest itself in that current state yet that state was necessary to it but there come a time light had to cross its path so now he said let there be light he said and it had to have that sunlight to make you live and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light he said in order to bring forth now watch a creation of joy he didn't do that to bring forth misery to bring forth death even though that's what we see now but that's not what his original creation was meant to be God did not create us to be miserable even after he gave adam Eve he still was not miserable right they they still were happy but it was after the fall that they become miserable he wanted to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the Earth now again think about that as an individual that's what he's trying to do to us that's what the word of the hour does for us that's what the Holy Spirit does for us which by the way as we get into this we'll see you can't separate the two the spirit and the word always go together it's Christ Christ is the anointed word the word and the spirit together the word moving the spirit moving on the face of the waters and the word speaking let there be light and the spirit bringing the word to pass so it's always together it's never separate and so you have to have both and he said and so brother Branham really knocks this because and I know or some people will say well brother being all we need is the word all we need is the word you go into this sermon and begin to listen to it brother Branham knocks that and he begins to say you can't say word only yeah that's right you gotta have a life right there's got to be some reality to it at some point it's got to matter right right at some point all the knowledge you have about the Bible all the teaching that you've had all the things have got to matter yeah and when is it going to matter well when you're dealing with the mechanic when you're talking to the uh down at the grocery store when when you got church problems when you got marriage problems at some point the words got to matter right it's got a Michael itself manifest and that's why brother Branham when he's preaching in the token and we talked about it on Sunday but he said it's not enough just to believe yeah do you know he said that he said it's not enough to believe yeah you've got to have the token because anyone can say they believe he said but if you really believed you would manifest what you believed because the Life of Christ would be there to manifest it so this is manifesting time and brother Branham even talked about that in the token he said there's there was a time when you could put up the lamb and inspect it he said but not this hour this is manifesting time so if we were created to have joy guess what should be manifested in our life Joy oh God give it to me oh you say well how do you have joy well just let Christ manifest himself in your life many times we don't have joy because we steal it from ourselves we're going if we had a joy if Joy was a tangible object and you had it in a uh I'm preaching this without thinking about it first so I may need to be careful but if you had joy in a in a safe and it was a tangible object and you could put it there in the tangible object in in the safe and it was sitting there and you could uh you say well every night it's getting stolen every day it's getting stolen and so you're going to set a trap for the thief and you get out and and do all the stuff that it takes to catch him and you put a camera on it and one night you get a notification here it comes up you look at it it was you yeah you stole your own Joy how did you do it by letting things bother you by letting things come and get between you and the word because the word brings Joy the light bring brought Joy to the Earth it was created for that and so we many times we steal our own joy we steal our own happiness we just let God be God a lot of the joy would come back yeah just let him do what he does a lot of the atmosphere would change but see because we because we're falling and in this condition we we tend to go towards that depravity of losing joy and losing life but this word came to bring joy and to bring life upon the Earth he said then the spirit of God isn't moved with love and compassion I love that I love the way he says that the spirit of God moved with love and compassion in other places he said it brooded or it made love to the Earth right you're like a dove cooing and the word there is as a hen in Deuteronomy it says an eagle fluttereth stirth her nest flutereth over her young that word flood Earth is the same word diffused in Genesis where it says he Broods over the Earth he moves over the face what he like a like a hen or or a eagle sitting on a nest and moving to keep the eggs in just the right the optimal atmosphere oh God that's what he's doing in our lives today he's moving with love and compassion when we come to church on Wednesday night he's moving with love and compassion when we come on Sunday he's moving with love and compassion he said at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and slept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed he said that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning he said this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater Sunrise than ever because it came with greater news than this Sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning he said this this Sunrise brought a news that he has risen he is quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead he said the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing forth a message that there will be life upon the Earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising yeah he said sun rising it was not only s-u-n Rising it was the son had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promise seed by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth oh my no more could the botany life lived back there at the beginning without the issue and to bring it to life no more than today when sons of God is upon the Earth it takes the s-o-n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on Easter morning then in this dirt somewhere oh my in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time why because Adam come from the dirt God created him out of the Dust so all of us were in Adam so we came from the dust too yeah so everything that would be us everything oh my was laying there in the earth he said in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and In Heaven There was a book of memory no he's putting it like we can understand it yeah I don't know that there necessarily would say well there's a book here with a quill pin but it's like so we can understand that God has a a memory of it a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing oh Hallelujah knowing that because the Son of God raised it would also Race To Life every son yeah someone say every son then what are we worried about right why do we stress why do we why do we uh spend so much time worrying about our loved ones and I know it gives us pause and makes us think and we should be desperate for Souls but but it ought to raise the desperation ought to come from love not because of worry because all that worry does is separate us from that life but that life will bring to life every son every son that was for ordained to this great time well where does he get that brother Ben is he just pulling that out of his own mind no he gets out from the scripture Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called then he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified you're going to make it we've preached on that before you're going to make it you're going to be okay yeah why because let me call he justified those who he justified he glorified he knew it would be he said in what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at the time when it first dawned now he said on this great breaking of the Easter seal now he calls it an Easter seal and I think I've looked at this before with you but an Easter seal was a seal that you would put on a letter we don't send letters today but that's hard to apply to email Isn't it most of you probably don't even send email my daughter does she uses email at school and then emails me when she has a problem or something sometimes just to email me she'll send me an email but I like email it's what I used it works so if you want to email me that's fine but you can't put that on an email it was a physical seal that you're taking you put on the back of a letter and then some of you may remember doing that now don't age yourself but they would take a physical like a stamp put it on a letter and then when you open the letter you broke the seal right that's the Easter seal the ram talks about an Easter City talking about that physical thing he broke the letter but brother Brown told us he said there was a message on the inside of the seal yeah yeah oh my the the event of breaking the fields wasn't the main thing right the main thing was the message on the inside of the seal Oh Glory he said and now he said the true Easter seal on this Sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed how is God going to show us what life after death was in a person oh God how's he going to show us what a Rapture is in a people yes that's right we're going to see our loved ones and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed the Bible says we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment and twinkling of an eye what what's it telling us that the seal will be broken off of life after death but how can we know that's going to happen because it's already happened right the Great Seal of life after death was broken on the resurrection morning right he said in the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know see God interprets his word by bringing it to pass so he says the world growth grouped in darkness groped around man's suspicion theories was among men's heart tradition made up that's the very thing that divided the Pharisees and the Sadducees was the resurrection some believed in it and some didn't but the Pharisees had no clue that the resurrection was a person because Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life amen because even even Martha she believed in the resurrection but Jesus said I don't just believe it I am the resurrection amen I believe we can say the same thing about the Rapture today I don't just believe in the Rapture I am the Rapture the Rapture can't leave without me brother Brown said everything you have need of to make it in a Rapture is already laying in you right now oh that ought to make us excited tonight you take a bunch of Pentecostals running around shouting about gifts that fell 120 years ago think about this the Rapture the coming event what's coming up that's not history that's something that's happening right now you're a part of that it's laying right inside of you if anything ought to make people excited it's sad yeah it feels broken Glory now he says they worship the son they worshiped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people that made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning and everyone liked it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and life John 14 19 says yet a little while in the world seeth be no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and he said when he come forth on that morning because I live you live also Not only was he the beneficiary of the Resurrection but all those seed someone say all oh that includes Me and You by the way if I understand the definition of a Double L it includes me and you because I lived you live also all those feet that was resting in God's Great promise was a benefactor of that Resurrection to life because he said because I live you shall live also that was the breaking of the seal Glory because he was brought up so will everyone that's in Christ be brought up with him oh my I'm going to skip past this but you can go write it down if you're if you're keeping notes so you want to come back to it first Corinthians 15 verses 16 through 22. we'll skip past it because I'm already out of time but if you want to go back to that Paul gives us a glorious glorious explanation of the resurrection and an argument for it that without the resurrection we're of all men most miserable but because the seal has been broken we can have joy when the sun came up it dispelled the gloom and when the sun comes up when you when you have a revelation that he has risen not that he was risen 2 000 years ago but he's risen by the Jason in your heart when you have that Revelation when you can't grab a hold of that then Joy comes in your life because no matter what happens There Ain't No Grave gonna hold my body down there ain't no tomb Gonna Keep Me From making it in a Rapture there ain't nothing why because he's already risen in my heart amen Hallelujah amen he said at this glorious Sunrise God had proven or Vindicated his word all the glooms and doubt that had moved in people's minds was taken away because here was he who once lived eat drink and fellowship with mankind that said I have power to lay my life down I have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made that statement but he proved it to be the truth oh what a glorious thing that is he said I'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already someone say already I'm having you do that to wake you up we have already raised from the dead for we were in him Glory he said notice now is the Gloom covered the earth and the seeds could not live without the s-u-n to rise and Gloom had covered the Earth and now the son was risen all Gloom was vanished by this light as it spread across the Nations to the people he is not here but he has risen what a statement he had proved his word he had proved it to be true for he had now conquered death Hell In The Grave he proved it to be true when he rose again and he showed himself to his disciples but now after 2 000 years he's proven it true again what was the sign of the son of man the sign of the Resurrection he proved it to be true and he didn't just prove it 40 years ago or 50 years ago but he's proved it to be true in our lives amen that's why we're not hotbed plants we don't have to be babied and pampered we're Children of the Resurrection we don't go to church because somebody babyed us and made everything just right for us and said oh I love to be able to do that church I'd love to be able to have everything just the way you wanted it but I tell you what that's not why we come to the house of God that's not why we feed on the word we do it because we love God we're Children of the Resurrection we've raised from dead creeds proved it to be true now I if you let me just for a minute I want to dwell on that Gloom for just a minute now as we kind of move away from it is the rising of the Sun and I'm I'm over time but many times we feel that Gloom we live in it we deal with it and you know brother random taught us that someone telling us get next to yourself doesn't work you know he said that over and over again he said that you can't just tell somebody who genuinely has a Gloom in their life just get next to yourself because you get next to yourself you may see things you don't like yeah that don't work he taught us he said you need something to put your foot on something to melt away the Gloom I don't know what you're dealing with tonight but I know many times especially in these midweek services but you can feel it off of people you come in and and I'm not saying you tonight but just in general people will come in you feel Gloom you feel depression feel nervousness you feel stress and sometimes it's all here because it happens that's why God called human beings to preach to human beings right you come as a man not as an angel he called human beings to deal with human beings and so many times we deal with that and we need something to put our foot on something to melt away the Gloom brother random talks about to somebody a woman that comes up before him he said between you and I comes a dark shadow it's shaking and jumping and there's only one thing that can mean that that's a demon a demon of nervousness he says you think sometimes that you've lost your mind isn't that right but he's a liar I don't know how many times I stood here at the altar and reminded some of you and and stood where I've preached before and reminded the people the devil's a liar if the devil's telling you that guess what it's not true the best compliment you could get from the Devil is for him to say you're not going to make it you're not a Christian right because he's a liar yeah yeah but he said he's trying to get you down lady don't you pay no attention to that he said Do you believe me to be a servant look he said let me tell you something you've tried so long to even get one place you thought if you could just like put your foot you could start from there it's that right I'm not reading your mind but you was praying about that so that's right you said many times in your thoughts in there if I could just get one place to start from and many times in our lives that happens we this happens many times brother Branham said when he preached even back then he said 90 of the audience I dare say today is probably a hundred percent yeah people deal with nervousness anxiety and he said back then it was 80 to 90 of the audience that dealt with that and so he said if I could just get one place to start from he said this is your starting place right here where could you start from now watch the Earth had to have a starting place it was without form and void we don't know how long brother Brown said God in the beginning God created the heavens and earth period well that's an eye-opener isn't it we don't know what happens until he began it said it begins to say the Earth was without without form and void but the brown calls it the seeds of a pre-existing civilization I don't even know what that means I really don't but there's all kinds of things laying there but the random he taught us those were seeds that God had planted that we're laying there and so but it was gloomy it had to have a point to start from where was the starting point listen to me tonight the starting point is always the word and the Holy Spirit goes to work on the word the starting point is always the word let there be light again he said look this way lady what are you scared of you got a nervous condition that's been bothering you for a long time you believe God can heal that nervousness he said 90 of this audience is vibrating with the same thing right now he said that's exactly right see he said you want a place to put your foot always he said they they all tell you get next to yourself and believe this and that but you've got to have a starting place you're on it right now he said believe it well you're the word of God says you're free could we grab a hold of that today can we hear that like the seed that was there under the muck under the mire but when the sun the warmth of the sun when he said let there be light in the sun because that ball of ice or whatever that was there and God it warmed up solely and when it come to life and it began to shine down on the Earth all the seeds that were down there in the Frozen cold dark muck of the water all the seeds that were there began to warm up and gradually they begin to break open and they begin to express what they were from the beginning oh God what was it the light that did it there's got to be a starting place there is a starting place it's this word are you tired are you weary are you anxious go back to the word put your foot down on it find out what the Bible says find out what a prophet had to say you're having a hard time to say well I I can't it just seems like sickness after sickness after sickness put your foot down on the word yes the devil's going to do that to you but he said I'm the god that heals all your diseases financial trouble whatever it is put your foot down on the word this is your starting place the word of God so the word of God says you're free you believe it let me believe it tonight all right he said go be free of that thing brother Branham wasn't quoting himself when he said you're free it's quoting the word the word of God says you're free he didn't have to have a vision for that right brother Brown taught us he said when I go I say go and be healed he said I'm not saying that because because I have any power to heal them he said I'm saying what the word says that's right where can you put your foot down put it down here Revelation 117 he spoke about the one who came you remember his his hair was white like wool who was it who was it that he saw the same Christ that we saw on this age the same God that's here today in word form but he saw him John saw him there in the form of a judge and he describes him and he said when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead overcome overwhelm with nervousness with anxiety with fear and he laid his right hand upon me singing to me fear not I am the beginning and the end what a statement I am the first and the last I am the Alpha and the Omega he that liveth and was dead you think about that statement brother man you don't know what I've dealt with this week deal with this let go of that for a minute and deal with this scripture in your mind I am he that liveth and was dead we either believe that or we don't and if he's alive it's enough if he's alive he calls me his child yes if he is alive I am his redeemed if he is alive I am the Beloved I'm accepted in the Beloved if he's alive his word is true amen he proved it true he broke the seals off of the scriptures hey man he said I'm he that liveth and was dead behold I'm Alive forevermore hey he said that I have the keys he'd preach a whole sermon on that one but this is one of the scriptures that brother Brandon read as he began this sermon he said I have I have keys walking around there and John he's scared he said don't be scared John and he just takes him keys and begins to shake him hey look look John I got the keys you ever see anybody a janitor at a school or somebody that walked around with keys all over their pocket brother Bailey's probably got that on his pocket right now you got a key you got keys hanging on your pocket and hang on a chain when the janitor walks up and down the hall an important person used to mean that you were important now they tell me now that if you have no keys at all that's the most important person other people open doors for them but that meant you were important you could open doors said don't be afraid I have keys I don't just have keys I have specific keys the ones to hell and death what are you afraid of yeah hey man I have the keys of hell and death I have the keys of hell and of death I am the beginning in the end hey man brother Brandon man I'm closing with this musicians go ahead and come he said away with Satan in his Gloom and up with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the faith of almighty God faith can take its holy stand on the Rock of Ages and Pierce an Eagle Eye through every storm cloud when the very waves of death and disappointments trying to wash its foundation out from under it you don't think the devil don't try that with me every time we come to a Wednesday night and the crowd's a little bit thin the devil tries to bring them waves of Gloom and disappointment every time you come to the house of God the devil tries to do it to you too every time you go to work the devil tries to do it every time you you have a situation at home the devil tries to do it but don't be afraid John I have the keys of death and of hell amen and he got them keys not for himself he's already been there he didn't bring out the keys for himself you're the beneficiary Hallelujah the key and hands it over to Peter he says here you go Peter Peter knew exactly what to do with it walked on the day at Pentecost and opened the door he said how should we be saved how can we escape death and Hell yeah isn't that what they asked what can we do to be saved repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what was he telling him he was unlocking the door Wendy how'd he get the key Jesus gave it to him Hallelujah the same key works tonight he took it out of the grimy hands of Satan himself what are you afraid of sinned in the beginning it's bigger than the car problems bigger than the money problems bigger than the family problems he's risen Christ amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father I'm so grateful to be able to come here on a Wednesday night and preach these things I feel a little bit tired myself and body and a little stressed but Lord I I'm so thankful for your word so thankful for what you've done in this hour we can always come back to it it's always true men may fail us people around us families and and churches and and and situations everything's that can be shaken will be shaken but not you Lord you have the keys of death and of hell you are he that was a lie that was dead and now is alive we're so thankful for that Lord because you live We Live also oh God would you help us to recognize that tonight to get a vision of it hard to look past our problems and see the word make it a starting place that dispels the Gloom where the sun can raise in our lives dispel the Gloom shake away all the things all the things that have happened not trying to minimize those things Lord but we know that next to you they're nothing Lord there's no gate that you exceed the Swirl seed of Abraham can't possess Lord we believe that and we know it tonight then we must know that we are that seed or we belong to you we've we've come your provided way we've done what you've said to do in your word and you accepted us and we fill your presence here tonight and we thank you for that Lord I pray that you would dispel every bit of Gloom and your Holy Spirit brood over this church that you have so many times before or does we worship you we thank you for what
