thankful for that am that Jesus rescued me how many's been rescued here by Jesus amen Thomas come here buddy brother Thomas is 20 years old and single and uh not completely single but there's no ring on a finger anywhere yet and uh he's going to sing for us but before he does uh brother Ben ask him to greet the people and he's going to do it brother Thomas is a minister from North Carolina from Brother Josh Bennis church so give brother Thomas a nice hand for coming amen thank you like you said I'm Thomas cross uh many of you know my mom and dad brother Daniel and Sister Crystal cross and uh over the years it's spent a lot of time coming up here and it's been a while but it's so good to see everyone and uh you know I just love and appreciate all you you know talking to Sister Carla and me many memories coming up here helping them build the house and stuff and just good to see all of y'all you know it's always kind of funny the the Lord's always given me a heart to travel and I love it but it's also kind of bittersweet because I hate saying goodbye to people and you know it's just uh I told somebody one time I don't like making friends but I like to make family and it's always so hard on me saying goodbye but it's so good to see y'all and even tell brother Ben is just always know it's great to have church with people who make you feel welcome and know they love you but I'm ready for the word tonight are you you know I'm ready for the word tonight I think it was uh you know brother Ben told me I could get up here I just can't preach he said but I can greet the people and uh anytime I can uh just lift the message up I like to do that it was uh you know I think about Jesus he with the crowd there he said uh he said you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood and many of them were falling him and they just they couldn't take that and they turned away they called him a vampire and they called him a devil a crazy man and you know he he looked up broken heart and he said will you go to talking to the disciples and you know it always resonated with me because Peter spoke up it was you know Peter the one who denied him and the one who had cutting the solders ear off he was sleeping in the garden when Jesus was praying but he said to whom would we go and you know I think where else will we go if it weren't for this message he said the prophet said Peter saw something in Jesus that he couldn't see in any other man he said it wasn't a place he didn't seem to you know to where would we go but he said to whom would we go and you know all my hope lies in this message message and you know it's a it's a hard World we're living in and I'm thankful you know for the message cuz it's this message that's going to carry us on you know to the coming of the Lord all right you know the Bible says here we have no continuing City but we look for one to come and it's this message I believe that's going to take us to that place and you know brother brandom you know Heaven it's always kind of you know it's just something special to think about brother brandom said his dog was there and he he had a horse there and you know even his favorite chair that they came and take cuz he couldn't make payments on it but most of all he wanted to see Jesus and that's my desire I want to see Jesus I believe it's this message I'm homesick go ahead and sing it with me if you know

and appreciate you all and amen I was thinking the other day amen just uh you know how you start going back down through Memory Lane sometimes and thinking about the um first times we was coming out here and ministering to you and speaking to you here in the church and amen it's been a few days ago but we're still Amen Alive and Well and serving the lord and amen we're still pressing the battle and still believing that any minute our bodies are going to be changed and so I just want to say thank you into this church for all the years of support and love and prayers you've given to us and the ministry and amen it is very uh very humbling and very thankful for all that you stand for and you've done for us and our Ministries and tonight we want to go to the word of the Lord I know it's a Sunday afternoon and amen we want to uh be very uh conscious not to uh amen uh create a pharaoh situation here and not let God's people go amen amen amen amen I'm glad you you uh you said amen Joel amen amen we we sure love and appreciate brother Joel don't we amen he's such a wonderful brother and amen does such a wonderful job and we we sure sure appreciate him and amen is that how you wanted me to say that okay amen The Book of Revelation the e8th chapter amen we want to go to Revelation chapter 8 you love the Lord this afternoon amen Revelation chapter 8 and verse number one I know this is a very familiar reading to us and amen I'm going to uh maybe speak a little bit here tonight on Thanksgiving if that's okay Revelation 8 and verse one the Bible says says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour in Revelations chapter 10 I want to go back to Revelation chapter 10 and I want to look there in the eighth verse we were speaking this morning on the voice of the seventh angel not being the voice of a man but the voice of God veiled in the man in the eth verse and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings now the Bible said when the seventh seal was open there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother br tells us in Feast of trumpets he said Revelations 10 is the seventh seal so when you look at Revelation 10 it begins to talk about open book and eating that open book I remember I heard a brother say it one time like this he said when the seventh seal was open there was a feast amen tonight I want to speak to you for a few moments on the bride's Thanksgiving feast let's just bu our hearts together Heavenly Father Lord we are indeed grateful to be your children Lord we're thankful for this special time that you've given us here together this weekend Lord the youth meeting Friday evening the time of Fellowship yesterday Lord the service is today around the spiritual and natural food alike now father as we stand here tonight to look into your word we are very well aware that we're not here by ourselves but Lord there's an unseen host of angels that have gathered in this building tonight to minister to the needs of your children for Lord these are The Heirs of Salvation so father I pray tonight for a few moments you would help help me to get myself out of the way Lord May the anointing come in for a few moments and just push back tiredness Lord father I pray that if there be specific needs up in lives and hearts oh God lord may your word speak directly to the situations oh God now father we commit this meeting tonight in thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight as you can have your seats amen as I said I want to talk talk to you for just a few moments here on this thought of the bride's Thanksgiving feast amen the brides Thanksgiving feast you know we are in uh right now a season of Thanksgiving and you know to many we find that Thanksgiving is a Time amen of just eating a turkey or getting together or you know sitting around and talking with one another uh to the world Thanksgiving has actually become just another day of the year or just another time I think of how that many many years ago you had Thanksgiving on Thursday and then you'd have what they called Black Friday on Friday to go get all the shopping and all the sales and you know that never would open till about 6 or 7 a.m. the next morning but as you see how the world is so taking over today amen it's come right into the time of our Thanksgiving feast with our families and so the world has totally redefined amen what Thanksgiving is but I believe as Believers tonight that we celebrate Thanksgiving amen as those who are thankful amen and Gathering Together around on the table with our friends our family our loved ones amen and most of all giving thanks unto God now when you think of this giving thanks unto God we have been given a direct commission Amen to give thanks in 1st Chronicles 16:34 he said oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and for his mercy endureth forever Psalms chapter 105 and verse one he says oh give thanks unto the Lord and call upon his name and make known his deeds among his people brother BR would say tomorrow is Thanksgiving it's a day that set aside where our Pilgrim forefathers set that day aside to give thanks to God for what he had done for us for blessing them and giving them crops and so forth he said it's one real American day he said all other days like St Patrick's and so forth come from across the seas this American holiday is Thanksgiving day he said now tonight I want to say there's so many things amen that I am thankful for I don't know how to give thanks to God for so many blessings he said But be sure to remember that tomorrow if your church has a service then attend it tomorrow night he said look if you don't have church service then at home get the family together and sit down and take God's word and read it amen tell your children about it tell them that this nation amen was built upon such as that our forefathers who fought Amen to bring this freedom to us amen that we would have the freedom of worship and the freedom of speech and the freedom of press he said and we're thankful yet for it we don't know how long we'll have it amen but I say this long may our lands be bright amen with freedoms Holy Light protect us by thy might great God Amen our King so we find then that the day we're living in amen that there's actually two kinds of conditions there is the condition amen of a famine and there is the condition of a feast now the prophet Amos prophesied he said behold the days come so this was in the future right amen behold the days come saith the Lord that I amen will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing amen the words of the Lord when you look there amen at that word famine it means to hunger amen it means to hunger for Jehovah's word so there would be a famine Amen in the land where people would literally be hungering for the words of Jehovah now the prophet of God said it very beautiful he said there's more preaching being done than ever in the world Amen and less practiced than we ever did in all the world he said do you know the scripture says there will be a time in the last days when there will be a famine strike the land it'll not be for bread and water but for hearing amen of the word of God he said the people are seeking to hear the word of God Amen but they are failing to get it now when you think of this famine this famine we're speaking of Amen would not be a natural famine amen but it would be a spiritual famine not a famine now listen not a famine for word amen because we have plenty of word amen but there would be a famine for the hearing of the word now in 1962 brother Ram receives a vision he says now dreams are very funny he said but there I was he said and in this dream he said there was a Boatman come over he handed the little canoe about 2 and 1 half three feet long he said it was real white just plastic and white and he said here's your boat I said oh I couldn't cross for that and that he said we'll run about 5050 M an hour up and down the way I said it might up and down the shore but it won't out here he said now look in this dream he said now they're not even Boatman I said I know that I said I'm a Boatman and I know about a canoe to handle it but I said they'll never they couldn't make it I would like to go that anyhow he said well they love you and said why don't you go back up here and store up he said so I went back and the little place where we've been out there little place called kondak about 45 or 40 or about 40 miles yeah he said little store out there he said look like it was a condac and it turned out to be this Tabernacle he said I was standing right there and I was calling in great barrels amen the prettiest food I ever seen he said there were radishes looked like three foot long turnips and greens and potatoes and everything he said now store in plenty of it see and I was standing there amen just storing it in he said and I woke up but I couldn't understand it now how many knows when a dream comes there has to be a prophet Amen in order to interpret that dream he said now here's the interpretation Lord you gave this Vision some two years ago Amen to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables amen that I saw in the vision being stored here Amen in this Tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full amen or a tap Lo that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us Amen in the hour that we live to give us amen sustaining strength amen the spiritual strength for the task amen that lays ahead I'll say this what the Church of the Living God needed amen was more than just a good service amen what they needed was more than just a theologian or a doctor of divinity Amen to expand upon the scripture amen but they were starving to death spiritually amen they needed a feast he said if the children get the right kind of vitamins they always feel good he said and what we need is some spiritual vitamins Amen in the church today what we need is some spiritual vitamins in the church today now brother talking about vitamins he tells us amen how there were two farmers amen and they had raised two Cals y'all remember that story he said now here's what was happening he said the food they were eating amen was what separated them one from the other he said that puts me in the mind of some of these old churches see amen this great big tall aspiring place with a $1,000 pip organ plus seats and everything amen but is there anything to eat there he said that's the next thing you get some little Old Mission somewhere amen you know you might find a little a whole lot in there amen some spiritual vitamins God has got them amen to help your spirit pep it up a little amen that's the preaching of the Gospel he said if that won't pep up the church there's nothing that will amen for Faith Cometh From hearing the word of God listen we are not chickens amen who are trying to barely scratch around the Barnyard Amen in a famine and find something to eat amen but we are Eagles and Eagles require amen Eagle vitamins I say what a blessing it is Amen to be an eagle in this generation and what a blessing it is to be able to receive amen the broken bread of life amen as a feast in the hour of famine that has been sent down from our father you say what is the bread of life well the prophet of God said amen the bread of life is the revelation of Jesus Christ in those two notable messages brother BR preaches around the time of Thanksgiving the first one is amen the token 1963 and the second one was the invisible Union yeah on of the Bride of Jesus Christ he said in the token I'm looking for a Time To Break Forth amen of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapturing faith amen just before it comes he says I believe we're now at the time amen that the word should have the preeminence in another place he said see amen sometimes it means a lot sometimes it cost you something anything that doesn't cost you something it isn't worth having and all these great things amen has to be paid for that's the reason amen that we are worshiping today amen the freedom of religion in this Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of a many American millions of them he said but it's worth something and this religion that we have this Pentecostal holy spirit amen that's fell on us to bring back to us a resurrected Jesus Christ alive after 1900 years it's worth all of our time and it's worth all of our effort amen everything we do it's worth all Amen to us I love what David said he said in Psalms 26:7 he said that I may publish amen with the voice of Thanksgiving amen entail of all his wondrous Works another place David said let sacrifice amen the sacrifices of Thanksgiving amen and declare amen his works with rejoicing many times people amen they want to thank God for the big things amen but they don't want to thank him for the Small Things amen but I love how I heard it said one time amen what if we woke today amen with only the things that we thanked him for yesterday he said we should live amen with the spirit of Thanksgiving listen I don't think it's aie ver we should just visit Thanksgiving Amen in November but I think as a Believer amen we should live Amen in the spirit of Thanksgiving unto God when I think of this this this season or this Feast of Thanksgiving amen the scripture prophesied amen that at the time there would come a feast Amen to bring an end to the famine amen it would come in an unthankful generation the Bible said this know also in the last days amen that perilous times shall come come listen there's a famine that shall come and perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves they shall be Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents amen unthankful and Unholy look at this word unthankful it means unpleasing now when you think of this Thanksgiving amen it is a time of gathering it is a Time amen gather around something it is a time of remembrance and reflection amen but it's also a Time amen that the spirit of thankfulness amen has set in Amen to where the more we have the less thankful we become listen an unth thankful generation for the natural blessings but look then that moves into the spiritual blessings and they begin to take the things of God for granted when is the last time amen that you just took time and thank God Amen that he sent you a prophet and he sent you a message and he give you a clear understanding amen by the spirit of Revelation that your eyes would be enlightened to understand and to know the things that you know brother said help us in our homes as we go amen not to be like a pig Amen to sit down and eat but may we look up to the Creator and say thank you Lord Jesus amen for giving to me this food amen may we tonight not go to bed as unthankful children but may on our knees we spend a long time in prayer and Thanksgiving amen and rising to tomorrow and saying father I can't travel this day by myself amen but take my hand amen and Lead me through the day amen I don't know about you but why don't we right now amen just take a moment of Thanksgiving amen thank you Lord for saving my soul amen thank you for saving my family amen thank you for healing my body thank you for the message of the hour amen thank you for the blood amen that washed me white as snow amen thank you for the power of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord amen that I've got some books and tapes that I can feed on the famine or the feast in the hour of famine amen thank you Lord that I got my right mind amen thank you Lord that my bills are paid thank you Lord I may not have everything I want amen but you give me everything I

truth amen thank the Lord amen when's the last time you thank God Amen that you got some people interested in your young people amen thank you Lord that they're not going to a church amen where they're just throwing them aside amen but they're investing time and they're investing effort into sin amen the talents of God develop oh church if anybody's got a ride Amen to GA around the table and have a Thanksgiving feast is the Bride of Jesus Christ well somebody give him some Praise In The House of God I'm talking about God who is give us everything that we have need of in the hour that we're living this bride's Revival amen is a feast but it's not feasting on the day to carry on it is feasting on Fresh Mana when you look here at this word Feast it means a large meal amen which is typically one in celebration of something I'll just say this you all know these things amen but the fresh Mana of the hour amen is the hidden Mana that has come from almighty God now that hidden Mana amen it's not for everybody but the hidden Mana amen is only for the Overcomers amen of the age now you know where that come from don't you amen Moses in the Old Testament the Bible said he had a golden pot amen and they put their Mana in there brother picks that up and he said now remember only Believers only the elect amen comes into that amen God has chosen you he said now you said well amen no he that overcometh amen is the only ones that will receive of that hidden manner you say well praise God I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about amen there's a whole lot more goals to Christianity but besides not smoking cigarettes amen or drinking whiskey but he that overcometh amen shall inherit all things and he will be my son and I will be his God now listen I will give him of the Hidden Mana listen I will hide him away and I will give him the hidden things that the world on the outside of the curtain amen they don't know nothing about it amen though they eat Mana they don't know about this amen but I will give to him the hidden Mana I will give him a white stone with his name in it I love what the prophet says brother Joel he says do you get what I mean amen entering into the adoption or the hidden place with god listen this Feast of the Mana of hidden word is going to bring you into an adoption as a Son of God remember said Ministers of the Gospel amen don't care about your denomination or what the world thinks amen but seek Amen to enter into that hidden Mana where the fool revelation of God is amen make love perfect in your heart and you and God and everything else is at rest now Jesus in Revelation 2 and verse 17 he says now to him that overcometh will I grant to eat or will I give to eat of the Hidden manner R picks that up in the church age book he said now the spirit amen is promising the hidden manner he said a revelation of the word is given to the angel of that age amen for for it's hid from everywhere amen and revealed back the hidden manner it's addressed Amen to the angel of the church do you see do you get it are y'all ready for this he said it's a little bigger revelation of what Christ is and maybe a little higher call amen so this hidden Mana is a more Fuller Revelation that is calling you to a higher position oh church amen when the famine has struck the denominations and they're s satisfied just putting their name on a church rooll they're satisfied amen just going to church whenever it's convenient amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen predestinated you to receive this Mana in this age that it would give you a fuller Revelation and would bring you to a higher place in Jesus Christ therefore Jesus said amen I am the living bread somebody shout the living bread amen I am the living bread which came down from heaven and if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give amen for the life of the world in the book of Peter it says ye also as Lively Stones amen are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood Amen to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ in the end time evangelism feed us with that hidden manner that you said in the Bible was given that laid back just for the priest only but we are taught amen that we are priests of God and we are offering spiritual sacrifices that is the fruit of our lips amen giving praise unto his name so when you begin to feed on this food you can't help but praise God Amen because it is a reaction on the inside of your soul that you're feeding on something that the world has no idea about but you are thankful oh Hallelujah you are thankful to be feeding on this Mana said in the lay out of sin age he said there's going to be some Overcomers in there how many believes that how many believes you're one of them amen there's not just going to be some Overcomers amen there are some Overcomers he said remember each Church age the one preceding it inherits all the other ones were offered now watch up here everything written that he promised they will eat amen of that hidden manner do you know that hidden Mana was a type as we said of the Mana that fell in the wilderness for the children of Israel and the Bible said that it was a perfect food brother comes along he said it was a perfect food he said it was amazing how them little pellets of food amen kept them in perfect health he said now the bread from Heaven amen it symbolized by Mana one day amen came down from heaven and became life for all who believe on him said see what his word is his word is bread now if his word is bread amen then that tells me the bread is the carcass that the Eagles are feeding upon so there in Matthew 24 wherever the carcass is amen there will the Eagles be gathered together but man said the church is so carnal it feeds itself on a worldly of carrying dead things of the world Amen just like the vultures do he said they've gotten lazy soft and compromising he said did you ever see an eagle comp compromise amen no sir because there is no compromising in him neither does a genuine Christian he ain't soft amen he will hunt till he finds it he will hunt until he finds it he said look he will find his meat amen he wants fresh Mana he said he'll get down there and dig till he finds it he'll fly higher and higher if there's n in this Valley he'll raise a little higher because the higher you go amen the more you can see listen the day you stop feeding on this heavenly Mana is the hour you quit seeing things amen above what the world is seen but this Mana is calling you Amen to a higher place in God with a fuller Revelation he said so what time is it it's time for the Eagles of this day amen to get to Flying higher amen dig into God's promises amen not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago amen get out of it listen he said politics voting in voting out saying this or the other amen and the Holy Spirit has no more right away in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with God Amen to fulfill fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever he said just relies on half rot man May theology listen but neither will a Christian amen eat on that Dad carryon amen from old denominational doctrines and things he says they want the word of God they want the fresh word the promise of the hour amen God promised rabbits in the days of Luther but he promised other things in the days of others but now are you with me now amen but now he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu amen for all the Seven Seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God Amen to those who can receive and when he had opened the seventh seal there was a space of Silence in heaven amen but I want to say there was a feast amen that was being prepared for the Church of the Living God you say preacher what do you mean I'll tell you what I mean I'll say the seventh seal amen brought the menu of the word of God Amen back to the Church of the Living God and I'll say this whatever is on the menu is available for today right what whatever is on the menu amen it's available for today somebody say well amen I go to a restaurant you go in there and and and nobody likes to go to a restaurant amen and sit down and look at the menu and what you pick out they say we don't serve that no more amen well why is it on the menu amen if it's on the menu it ought to be able to be served and I'll say this the pro God said look if your man May theology just give you a little cater and told you to wait amen then you go ahead and wait he said but I got a full course dinner of the Holy Ghost they want to tell you to stand off right here and eat some peelings or GW on some bones and tell you the chicken is all gone from years ago amen don't you believe that because God has a full Square meal for a full man that's got full faith in the Son of God and believe it and will follow the instructions listen what the menu read the menu read to whosoever will Amen Let come and the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call that's right Brethren amen the same holy spirit with the same signs same wonders same power yes sir it's God's holy spirit oh Church of the Living God the seventh seal amen was the opening of the word was the bringing of the revelation of Jesus Christ and was the restoring to the church of the reality that there is no two holy ghosts there's only one Holy Ghost and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is still available in the house of God listen you want to talk about Thanksgiving amen give thanks to God that's the same holy ghost that brother brandom had is what your children can get amen give thanks to God that the same Miracles and the same signs and the same wonders and the same blessings and the same nature and the same power of God can be accessed and can be experienced by this generation today amen it's not a famine to the bride it's a feast and the Bible said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word somebody say every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God in St John chapter 7 in verse 37 the Bible says in that in the last day amen the great day of the feast somebody say of the feast the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man notice it didn't say the great day of the famine in the great day of the feast If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink for he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly amen shall flow somebody say flow shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spy of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now look here at this great day of the feast it was the Feast of Tabernacles which here it is spoken Amen to be the last day amen or the e8th day of the feast now the feast is spoke of Amen in Leviticus 23 as well as John 7 so what you're reading in Leviticus 20 or John 7 is actually coming from Leviticus 23 let's look at Leviticus 23 and 35 it says on the first day amen there shall be an holy convocation I want you to look at this and ye shall do amen no servile work therein Amen on the first day of the Holy convocation ye shall do amen no servile work therein look at this word servile it means to labor it means to service it means to work of a servant or a slave it is of captives amen or of subjects amen so this great day of the feast was the announcing amen that the days of sural work and labor and subjection those days are now over because what was spoke of in a type has now come in a fulfillment he said to understand what I just said amen let me say it like this brother in the church agent book can I just take time and read this he said do understand what I've just said is to clear up my students have never ever found Paul saying at any time time be born again and then be spirit filled he said they have interfered it is there and fear there and they don't and they have put their own meanings to make it say it amen but the scripture does not say that and Jesus never said it either then he reads John 737 through 39 and he says now says it here distinctly and emphatically somebody say distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking by coming unto Jesus in faith would have rivers of Living Water amen pouring out of him look here and it places this experience at Pentecost which in John 4 and: 10 it says if thou knowest the gift of God who it is that saith unto thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water skip down to verse 14 but what's but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him amen shall never thirst amen but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water amen springing up into everlasting life remember said this same living water is mentioned amen but this time it is not called a river it is called an artisian well there is where the people make their mistake because it is called a whale and a river they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and then the next place where it's called a river implying a great dynm it is to be the spirit now given as an indument of power he said not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power amen and that came at Pentecost you say a Thanksgiving feast yes sir amen a Thanksgiving feast that the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is fallen in the church today and is bringing us into an hour of Thanksgiving listen friends Leviticus 7 amen speaks of a peace offering I'm going somewhere amen or an offering of Thanksgiving look here in Leviticus 7 y'all want to read it with me Leviticus 7 and 11 this is the law of the sacrifice of Peace offerings look here which he shall offer unto the Lord if he offer it for Thanksgiving then he shall offer with the sacrifice of Thanksgiving unel cakes mingled with oil and unle Wafers Anointed with oil and cakes mingled with oil and fine flour and fried fried so it must be in the South but beside the cakes he shall offer for this offering amen leaven bread with the sacrifice of Thanksgiving of his peace offerings and of it he shall amen offer one of the whole oblation for an for a heave offering of the Lord and it shall be the priest amen that sprinkle the blood of the peace offerings and the Flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for Thanksgiving amen shall be eaten the same day that it is offered he shall not leave it until the morning but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow or a voluntary offering it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice and on the tomorrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten but this but the remainder of the Flesh of the sacrifice on the third day amen shall be burnt with fire this was a Thanksgiving offering and the whole reason that they were offering a Thanksgiving unto God Amen was a return amen for the F for the mercies of God that had been bestowed upon them you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about Ephesians 2 and4 yeah but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us look here the Thanksgiving offering of Leviticus 7 was a return of Thanksgiving or praise amen for the mercies that God had rained down upon his children he said you once in times Past Dead you were dead even many here tonight amen can look back and know you were dead amen but now why aren't you dead tonight as you were then amen you deserve to be that way because you was a sinner amen but God who is rich in Mercy that's the thing amen God who was rich all these things that we were amen somebody say all these things that we were but God that made the change right there God who is rich in Mercy oh I'm so glad that he being rich in Mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in material which he is but yet the greatest thing is being rich in Mercy let me declare to you tonight his mercies amen are new every morning therefore there should be a spirit of Thanksgiving upon the church every hour of every day because his mercies are new his mercies are new Every Morning Lamentations three this I recall to mine therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions they fail not amen they are new every morning and great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him and to the soul that seeketh him these offerings were to be done voluntary amen something you wanted to do so you weren't made to give a peace offering you weren't made to give a Thanksgiving offering but because of what God had done are you with me now amen because of what God had done which was an action sister Vicky there would be a reaction amen so there was an action amen but the reaction would be what you give back for the action that God gave in the first place listen that acknowledgement of special mercies received from God Amen such as Deliverance Amen in Travels by land or sea Redemption from captivity and a restoration to health enumerated in Psalms 107 it is to this sacrifice that the Apostle alludes when he says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually listen Friends by him are you with me therefore let us amen offer the sacrifice of praise to God on Sunday morning or on Sunday afternoon or on Wednesday evening or in a special convention no let us offer the sacrifice of praise Amen to God Amen Contin well that tells me we ought to praise him in the morning and we ought to praise him in the noon day and we ought to praise him in the evening time we ought to praise him at work we ought to praise him in the car we ought to praise him in school we ought to praise him in the grocery store we ought to praise him in our house we ought to praise him at the doctor's office we ought to praise him listen wherever the Sons and Daughters of God are there ought to be a praise because you're not just church members you have been rescued amen from the Famine of food and the drought of water amen God by his Mercy has restored unto you a feast in the hour of famine listen you ain't dying you ain't starving you ain't thirsty God has opened a wh God has prepared a Banting table all right yes sir now this age you're living in Jesus spoke of it you know what he said he said it was an age of insanity he said it would be a time in Luke 23 there would come a time when it would be a shame amen for a woman to even have a child can you say today we're there see we can turn and we can say this day is this scripture this day is the scripture fulfilled Luke 20 23:26 and as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a Serene coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus yeah and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me amen but weep for yourselves and for your children now why would he say that amen because these daughters or these women amen had been given a sacred trust they had been given sacred virtues because the oldest institution of the world Amen is what marriage amen are you awake is marriage look at verse 29 for beh behold the days are coming in the which they shall say look here in the days they shall say thus that are the barren and the wombs that never bear and the paps which never gave suck amen so the very thing that Hannah was went to the temple to get off of her was going to become a blessing in the last days and church were here today amen blessed are the baren and the wounds that never bear and the PS which never gave suck amen then shall they begin to say the mountains amen fall on us and do the Hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree amen what shall they do in the dry but look here in 1965 when the time has changed we've just come out of the Roaring 20s amen they just introduced the flapper girls amen they they what was that brother said roll them down roll them down all the all the all the scandalist and all the all the perversion listen women has just become amen an idol Amen in rejec and giving a child to their husband at the same time a prophet comes and preaches in The Invisible Union of Jesus Christ and says now Romans 7 Paul is speaking Amen on marriage and divorce what a prophet is doing is he is bringing the church amen into the message of Grace he is bringing Liberty to the bride of Christ amen to marry the new anointed word are y'all hearing me what is happening the natural amen is happening in the spiritual in the natural they're happy amen that their wounds are no longer bringing for children and the paps are no longer given suck amen at the same time in the pits they have quit preaching that there is a power of the Holy Ghost that can change a man and convert him and they're happy just to be church members brother said at the end time both trees are coming to the seed and proving themselves here we are right here today Lea and the bride somebody say leosa and the bride can I say what a prophet said there's a distinction between Le oosa and the bride just as clear and pretty as it can be in the scripture right here before your faces you cannot serve God in Mammon you can't be a virtuous Bible believing Christian and Associate yourself in the denominational Affair you just can't do it at the same time amen one has got to be dead and let the other one live neither can you bear God's word son neither can the church bring forth they don't want any of them screaming children amen shouting speaking in tongues and all them things they can't do that in a denominational Church they won't have you they don't bring them like that they take them up and shake their hands and say if you believe you got it as long as you put your name on the book that's all you have to do amen I'm just going to say what a prophet said he said see it's illegitimate children to the word though they still claim to be religious are you hearing me amen so amen I'll just say this I remember I was I was studying this one day and I went to town and I went into a into I was in a uh I can't remember I was in a shop or something an office somewhere I was in oh yeah I was in a in a in an urgent care I went by an Urgent Care amen I was actually getting ready to go out of the country and had to go by there and get a a shot or yellow fever shot yeah that's what it was so I go in there and I'm sitting there and there's two women sitting over FR me in the in the do in the in the office there and I'm just sitting there and I've just been studying invisible Union and this one woman she speaks over to the other she says so how's things going for you and she said oh thanks are going good she said I hear you're married now she said yeah she said how long you been married she said well actually I've been married 15 years and she said 15 years said so do you do you have any any children or do you have a family she said oh no she said she said we don't want no children I said and I'm sitting there thinking okay I just heard a prophet preaching about what I'm hearing in a doctor's office and she said no we don't want no children she said our parents are happy with grand dogs and Grand cats and and I'll just I'll just go ahead and tell you what she said right there she said I I refuse Amen to ruin my body having a child and I thought is that not what a prophet taught is that are we not living in the hour but listen friends it's come right in the church not from the natural but to the spiritual amen let's not get no screaming let's not get no hollering let's not get no bursts on the altar amen let's just shake a preacher's hand or let's just join a church amen but I want to tell you if you are the bride and you're having a Thanksgiving feast you are feasting on this the old Mana is gone the old ways are gone and there is a feast on the Revelation and this Revelation is producing birth said you say what's all this got to do with Thanksgiving what you talking about brother B here it is quarter nine you don't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion the pilgrim fathers were thankful for their new found way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creeds they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for for their age come on for their day listen to what separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up like Luther Wes and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together there's good people and there got to be some come out but what did he do are y'all ready for this what did he do he opened up to this to us the Seven Seals of the last message you notice them Seven Seals All the mysteres of seven Church Ages were sealed with the Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed Revelation the Seven Seals it's opened to us in this last days from a prophecy that went forth in Arizona what are you saying I'm saying the old ways are dead and the new Mana the fresh man of the Heavenly word has come into the church and now there's a bride on the earth who is willing to bear and bring forth the child the word the Christ brother said some people make the gospel a funeral procession he said others make it a Frolic he said some make it a Frolic just a thing time to go and play a bunch of music jump up and down on a platform Dance all over the platform or down the aisle run sit down talk about their neighbor some of them thinks they ought to stand out and say the doxology and the Apostles Creed so-called I want somebody to show me one written in the Bible he said it's not a funeral procession and neither is it a frolic it's a feast it's a feast with Christ when the believer comes and DS let me say this you don't offer Thanksgiving until something has been done to generate a Thanksgiving offering that's good you don't offer Thanksgiving until something has been done to generate a Thanksgiving offering let me say this the message of the hour the opening of the word the revealing of the son of man the revelation of the Mysteries the time of Loose Ends the third pull the the word being revealed all these things has generated a Thanksgiving in our hearts that in the time of famine we are feasting I will praise the name of God with a song and will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving oh come let us sing in the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king he is above all gods right Isaiah 51:3 for the Lord shall Comfort Zion he will Comfort all her waste places he will make her Wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of the Lord joy and gladness shall be found therein Thanksgiving and the voice of Melody re said what we need today is not a lot of material things we have that what we we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations we don't need more on Radio and on television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God if they haven't got a penny and will pray till that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and a Revival takes place on the inside of their heart and changes their attitudes and the atmosphere that they live in brother you may not have a pair of shoes on your feet you might be dressed in rags but there's something in your heart yeah that's singing The Melodies of God I'd rather have that than all the money in the world can I say this to you in Proverbs 15:15 all the days of The Afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart somebody say a merry heart he that is of a merry heart are you ready for this have a continual Feast oh my oh yeah B said there's two phases of this Christianity I spoke on it Friday night he said there's the int or mental conception he said but then there's the experimental experience he said that God has given the man in his heart he said the one intellectually is a hungry he's feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out but the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and Anor as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all right I think about this they have seen something about them people who are Christians and they're trying to live for God what what do you saying I'm going to I'm going to tie it up and close on this point right here there is a secret to this continual feast in First Kings chapter 17 the Bible says that there was that all lied to the tisp was of the inhabitants of Gilead he said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be Doom nor rain these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hint and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the brck cherith that is before Jordan and it sh be that thou shalt drink of the book Brook and I I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there said notice feed thee there not somewhere else but there Elijah during this secret during this time this time of famine he had a secret place that God had ordained for him to go that's the thing we want to see about Elijah had a secret place provided by God himself a secret place to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply run out God said I have commanded the Ravens and they'll feed you amen what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in Christ he said we notice again the word is in us and has come to us it did Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which was hid from the world the spiritual food is ready and it's in season now and each one of you can have this food if you wish it if you're if you're willing to steal away from all the unbelief of this hour if you're ready to come into Christ come into his promise remember his promise is Malachi 4 it's Luke 17:30 it's John 14:12 it's Joel 2:28 what would he do in these last days how the prophet said it'd be light in these days how it would work what it would do all the scriptures amen pointed this last day and this is Christ if you can hide away in that now are you ready for this if you can hide away in that now in that secret place look you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God if you can hide away from the Famine of Leota if you can get away from the modern Trends if you can get away from the world and the cultures and the Traditions if you can get away from the famine if you can get away from the drought brother Danny there's a secret place we can go in god there is a feast listen it's a banquet it's a prepared meal for a special occasion come on church let me say this he didn't leave you in the famine he opened the Seven

Services church it's a banqueting house it's a feast the prophet of God said what is it he said it's a banquetting which means wine and what is wine wine is the stimulation oh of the Revelation are y'all hearing this B said there'll be a Remnant there'll be those who will know God and who are waiting and who are charged and they'll see him come on church amen we go on an airplane ride and we about go crazy if our phone goes dead are y'all are you hearing me come Brother David you know what I'm talking about it's a time where everything's got to stay charged got to stay charged I tell you

battery yes sir hallelujah hallelujah what are you talking about I'm talking about a prophet of God said they'll be charged they'll be waiting and they'll see him for they will for he will come as a thief in the night but we'll be called up to meet the Lord in the air L listen here a secret going away of the church a secret going away of the church let our musicians come tonight not only Christ was slain to take away sin but your name was written y in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God wrote your name and associated with his before the foundation of the world now I love what a prophet says he says now Satan make them get scared now get them to doubt that before the world ever began God called your name you Christians and wrote it in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world ever started sayith the Bible that's God's word he spoke back there revealed through his servants the prophets and we are enjoying the blessings of resting and waiting upon the coming thank you Lord of the Lord listen there is so many people there who say the holy spirit is not real today while tens of thousands them and millions are saying it's not so there's that many enjoying the blessings of it brother said most of your poor people people who've been who've been dejected and rejected by the world who's been thrown out of the churches because they believe God to be God but they've been filled with his Spirit they are one in purpose they are one in heart who are these people he said Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic Jehovah Witness Orthodox Jew all together they become one not one to a Creed not one to a denomination that's the work of the devil through intellectual conception but the working of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you listen and God sits on the throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God fills you with his love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ talk about a feast a new nature brother said Remember When Elijah went in that secret place by the plan of God by the call of God and the word of God Elijah s Elijah entered into this secret place by God's forn knowledge plan and the call upon his life and according to the word he said now listen if that ain't the way we entered I don't know why we get there we noticed before the drought began before the drought began Elijah went into this place of Secret for his living a very type of before the Judgment starts to strike the Earth the church is already called out the bride is already Chosen and just waiting before the Judgment strikes already waiting eating the food of God and enjoy in the blessings of God won't you stand to your feet tonight listen friends this bride's Feast is an open book take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey look at this word to to eat it means to consume by eating to eat up to devour of consumption of the strength of body and mind by strong emotions I took the little book How The Angel's hand ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey but as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter but he said unto me prophesy again before many prophets and Nations and tongues and Kings I love what the prophet of God says he said in this Sevenfold book of seven Redemption plans has been brought to us and that's what this book holds brother Jeff it's powerful he said now we're going to get over in the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaimed something and he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but it was but it in his lips it was sweet he said now when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody's telling you're a Holy Roller you're this there the other see you're off of your head so it's hard to digest but when you're testifying of Glory it's sweet in your lips you say why is it this message why is it it don't go to denominations why is it it don't go to these big great Crusades it's not their food on it's not the church so- calls food it's the bride food it's spiritual food and season it would make them sick at their stomach oh yeah it's too rich for them brother Danny it's too rich for him amen they can't eat that seventh seal on they can't eat that third pull they can't eat that a prophet spoke and squirrels come into existence they cannot eat that the church does not or the bride does not go through the tribulation she goes in the Rapture they cannot eat that you had a seed in your soul from before the foundation of the world they cannot eat that your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life associated with God's name by the blood of the Lamb they cannot eat that you are the sinless Spotless bride they cannot eat that you never done it in the first place therefore they're in a drought but thank God there's a bride on the earth tonight who can eat the strong things of God hallelujah and it's more than a service it's a feast it's a feast you say preacher what are you saying I'm saying you're not feeding on a man yes it's a feast Glory said listen it gives me great pleasure to get to see when you know that you have a message from God I love this quote brother Ben you have a message from God and you give it to the people and see the people respond

vitamin every day he said now the reason he took that vitamin he said because it didn't kick in in the beginning of the race he said it didn't even kick in halfway he said but that one specific vitamin that he took he said when you got down there to the end of the race and you felt like giving up you didn't feel like you could cross the finish line you could see the finish line but you didn't think you could cross it he said that vitamin stored in his body he I I can't even explain how he said it he said but while he was running he would just kind of do something while he was running he said he could feel that vitamin releasing his body and he could feel it kick in and he could feel that surge of energy coming forth amen can I say this to you amen amen feed on these tapes
