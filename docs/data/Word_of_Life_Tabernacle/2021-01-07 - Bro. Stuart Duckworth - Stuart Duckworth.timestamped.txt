[58:22] he is to come off the throne he
[58:25] continues to sit
[58:26] in that place of majesty he continues to
[58:30] sit in that place of sovereignty
[58:32] and authority and power and supremacy
[58:36] he sits there to not empower and
[58:38] authority

[59:32] going
[59:33] amen but that doesn't mean we have to go
[59:35] in that direction and that doesn't mean
[59:37] that we have to put our faith in our
[59:38] confidence

[59:41] got my faith
[59:42] tonight and the one who sits on the
[59:44] throne i've got my faith

[59:47] power and authority
[59:49] amen that that man can do nothing to me
[59:52] unless god allows him to do it
[59:54] and i don't have to live in fear of what
[59:57] man can do to me

[1:00:48] that's sitting in power
[1:00:50] that's sitting in authority and then we
[1:00:51] can confess his word back to him

[1:00:56] believe my word amen and i'm going to
[1:00:58] come down

[1:01:14] father
[1:01:14] with a need amen with a situation amen

[1:01:29] and knowing what we've seen knowing what
[1:01:31] we've heard
[1:01:32] and knowing that that god amen he's the
[1:01:34] same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:36] amen that when brother branham left the
[1:01:38] scene that that god didn't leave but
[1:01:40] he's still here
[1:01:41] and we can call upon his name
[1:01:45] amen amen is the mighty god tonight
[1:01:49] do you believe that he's the mighty god
[1:01:51] unveiled before his people and then he's
[1:01:53] shown himself in this day
[1:01:55] in revelations it says that he's the
[1:01:57] alpha and the omega the beginning
[1:01:59] and the end that he's the amen and that
[1:02:02] ain't got nothing to do with a man
[1:02:04] or a woman ain't got nothing to do with
[1:02:08] that
[1:02:09] amen but amen means so be it and the
[1:02:11] bible says that he is the
[1:02:13] amen amen and that his word and what he
[1:02:16] has said in his word is final
[1:02:19] and his word is unchanging his word is
[1:02:21] unfaltering amen
[1:02:23] and his word remains true tonight and he
[1:02:25] is the amen
[1:02:27] and the amen has the final say
[1:02:31] amen you can't let your past define you
[1:02:35] amen but let his word define you you

[1:02:44] i mean we got to we got to stay with
[1:02:45] this word and let that define
[1:02:48] who we are and then he's the faithful
[1:02:51] and the true witness
[1:02:53] and in the church age book he says that
[1:02:55] he is both creator
[1:02:57] and sustainer the great creator savior
[1:03:00] god is faithfully working
[1:03:02] amongst his own right now as the great

[1:04:52] with the word amen stay with the message
[1:04:55] of the hour
[1:04:56] stay stay in the word because by that
[1:04:59] we'll overcome
[1:05:01] amen the bible says that we overcome by
[1:05:03] the blood of the lamb
[1:05:04] and by the very word of our testimony
[1:05:07] i mean it's i believe that our testimony
[1:05:10] won't just be
[1:05:10] of this and that and in our own thinking
[1:05:13] and our own logic
[1:05:14] amen but i believe our testimony will be
[1:05:16] exactly
[1:05:17] what the scripture says amen that the
[1:05:19] word will so
[1:05:20] become flesh and you and i amen that
[1:05:22] that's what comes forth from us
[1:05:25] amen we become the word amen and we
[1:05:28] overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:05:30] amen by the by the power of the holy
[1:05:32] ghost the broken blood cell
[1:05:34] we overcome by the holy ghost in us amen
[1:05:36] in the word
[1:05:37] amen the holy ghost feeding upon the
[1:05:40] word amen
[1:05:42] but god is obligated to his word and
[1:05:45] brother branham says here god is
[1:05:46] obligated god's obligated to his word
[1:05:48] and of the words in you
[1:05:50] then he's obligated to you with his word
[1:05:54] the bible says that heavens and earth
[1:05:56] will pass away but my words shall never
[1:05:58] fail so
[1:05:59] if the word is in you if god is
[1:06:00] obligated to the word
[1:06:02] then we can never fail because the word
[1:06:05] is
[1:06:05] in us and brother branham says he said i
[1:06:09] challenge any person
[1:06:10] under any condition to take god at his
[1:06:12] word and see
[1:06:14] if it's not right i challenge any person
[1:06:17] he says under
[1:06:18] any condition to take god at his word
[1:06:21] and see if it's right god will always
[1:06:24] honor his word
[1:06:25] amen his word went out and it will not
[1:06:27] return unto him void
[1:06:28] and then he's obligated to his word he's
[1:06:31] obligated to his people
[1:06:32] amen and i believe tonight that we ought
[1:06:34] to believe the word of god amen
[1:06:36] we ought to take the word of god and
[1:06:38] believe it from the very heart
[1:06:39] amen it's got to come from here down to
[1:06:42] here
[1:06:43] amen it's got to be more than a head
[1:06:45] knowledge or what the preacher says but
[1:06:47] you've got to take it for yourself
[1:06:49] you've got to take it for yourself and
[1:06:50] identify yourself with the word and when
[1:06:52] you do that god is obligated
[1:06:54] to take care of you he's obligated to
[1:06:57] keep you
[1:06:58] to sustain you amen the creator of
[1:07:00] heavens and earth amen the very
[1:07:02] the very god of eternity is obligated to
[1:07:04] you and i tonight
[1:07:08] because we believe his word amen
[1:07:12] i think brother brown said one of the
[1:07:14] greatest honors we can do is to
[1:07:16] to read god's word and to believe his
[1:07:18] word
[1:07:19] amen amen
[1:07:23] i'm gonna drink a little bit of water
[1:07:26] here
[1:07:37] but if we'll humble if we'll humble
[1:07:39] ourselves to his word
[1:07:41] as the scripture says he will exalt us
[1:07:43] in due time
[1:07:45] he'll exalt you you think of you know
[1:07:48] he's going to raise me up above my
[1:07:49] brother he's going to raise me up above
[1:07:51] my sister he's going
[1:07:52] he's really going to show something in
[1:07:53] my life but that's not what it means
[1:07:56] he said he'll exalt you and do time
[1:07:58] he'll and that word exalt means
[1:08:00] to raise to a place of dignity to raise
[1:08:03] to a place of honor
[1:08:05] and happiness i mean that's that's what
[1:08:07] i want to attain to tonight
[1:08:09] and i don't want to be better than
[1:08:10] somebody else and that's not what god's
[1:08:12] called us to be but he's got a place for
[1:08:14] us
[1:08:14] he's got a position and in a place of
[1:08:17] dignity
[1:08:18] a place of honor a place of happiness
[1:08:20] and god wants his children to be happy
[1:08:23] and then he's got a place that he can
[1:08:24] exalt us to amen to our to our god-given
[1:08:27] privileges
[1:08:28] in the word to our god-given given
[1:08:30] privileges in jesus christ to heavenly
[1:08:32] places

[1:08:39] you'll if you'll humble yourselves under
[1:08:40] the mighty hand of god he will exalt you
[1:08:43] and then he'll bring you to this place
[1:08:45] in due time but we've got to humble
[1:08:46] ourselves
[1:08:47] we want to we want to try to think
[1:08:49] things out for ourselves we want to try
[1:08:51] to try to go down our own path but we've
[1:08:53] got to humble ourselves
[1:08:55] under the mighty hand of god aiming to
[1:08:58] bring us to heavenly places in christ
[1:09:00] jesus amen
[1:09:01] amen to where we can enjoy the holy
[1:09:03] ghost
[1:09:04] amen to where we don't just walk around
[1:09:06] in this flesh and in the anointing
[1:09:08] amen of this day and under the anointing
[1:09:11] of
[1:09:11] of the of the chaos and the and the
[1:09:13] things that the media

[1:09:28] things amen
[1:09:31] amen walking in the holy ghost amen
[1:09:34] walking in the holiness of god
[1:09:36] walking in the purity of the word amen
[1:09:39] as the bride
[1:09:40] of jesus christ amen amen amen
[1:09:43] coming to a place amen where we can be
[1:09:45] so filled with the power of god
[1:09:47] amen we can be so filled with this
[1:09:49] presence amen
[1:09:51] that in the hard times of life amen he
[1:09:54] could
[1:09:55] carry us through a man as sustainer as
[1:09:57] creator amen he could carry us through
[1:09:59] and raise us up by his grace
[1:10:01] amen where we could walk in the joy of
[1:10:03] the lord amen
[1:10:04] we all we all get to a place where we
[1:10:06] lose the joy of our salvation
[1:10:08] and then we've all been to that spot
[1:10:09] amen but god wants to exalt us tonight
[1:10:12] man he wants you to be happy he wants
[1:10:14] you to live in a place of honor

[1:10:28] strength from it's not living in the
[1:10:30] marley grubs
[1:10:31] of laodicea living in the moly grubs of
[1:10:34] politics
[1:10:34] under that anointing because under that
[1:10:36] anointing under that anointing is
[1:10:38] destruction amen
[1:10:39] but i believe we've been called to
[1:10:41] something greater something higher than
[1:10:43] that amen we've been called to a body

[1:10:51] the holy ghost
[1:10:52] amen walking not in the spirit of this
[1:10:53] flesh but of the spirit of the word
[1:10:56] that's the only way we're going to get
[1:10:58] there
[1:11:00] amen the joy of the lord is our strength
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:04] amen we live too far below our
[1:11:06] privileges
[1:11:07] but if we'll humble ourselves before him
[1:11:09] he'll exalt us in due time
[1:11:14] brother branham says here he says you

[1:11:45] there's nothing that you could receive
[1:11:47] in the life
[1:11:48] in this life that would be greater than
[1:11:50] the power and the favor
[1:11:52] of jesus christ amen i want that favor

[1:12:46] hath delivered us from the power of
[1:12:48] darkness
[1:12:49] and i translated us into the kingdom
[1:12:51] reign of his dear son
[1:12:53] and brother branham says he says right
[1:12:55] now we reign with christ
[1:12:57] having dominion over sin the world the
[1:12:59] flesh and the devil
[1:13:01] showing forth his praise showing forth
[1:13:04] himself for its christ
[1:13:05] in us willing and doing of his good
[1:13:07] pleasure for it's
[1:13:09] so it's not us but it's he himself
[1:13:12] in us doing of his good pleasure and
[1:13:14] that our lives would give him glory
[1:13:16] that our lives would give him honor that
[1:13:18] our that our lives were giving praise
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:23] i like how he says he says right now we
[1:13:26] reign with him
[1:13:27] over these things right now in this
[1:13:29] present world in this body
[1:13:31] amen not in the future but right now we
[1:13:34] reign over these things
[1:13:35] he in and we were made to have dominion
[1:13:39] we were made by god to have dominion do
[1:13:42] you believe that tonight
[1:13:44] we were made by god to have dominion
[1:13:46] over the devil
[1:13:47] do you believe that amen we were made by
[1:13:50] by god to have dominion over sin genesis
[1:13:54] 1 he said and god said let us make man
[1:13:57] in our image after our likeness and let
[1:13:59] them
[1:14:00] have dominion let them have dominion
[1:14:03] over the fish
[1:14:04] let them have dominion over the things
[1:14:05] that that would crawl upon the earth
[1:14:07] they would walk upon the earth amen
[1:14:09] amen and god and adam was a god
[1:14:12] of the earth he was god of the earth
[1:14:16] he spoke to the winds and they obeyed
[1:14:19] if something seemed out of place to eve
[1:14:23] and many had the power to move it and
[1:14:26] you know how women are there they're
[1:14:28] particular
[1:14:29] they like things a certain way so eve
[1:14:32] had that within her
[1:14:34] even though they were they were in an
[1:14:35] eden but if something seemed out of
[1:14:38] place because god
[1:14:39] gave them that position amen as god
[1:14:42] as god of the earth and they were one
[1:14:45] their minds
[1:14:46] were as one as as eve thought so did
[1:14:49] adam
[1:14:50] think and as adam thought so did eve
[1:14:52] think they were one
[1:14:55] they were one
[1:14:58] but man was made to have dominion over
[1:15:00] the earth
[1:15:02] and i say tonight that we were made to
[1:15:03] have dominion over this body
[1:15:06] amen we were made to have dominion over
[1:15:08] our surroundings do you believe that
[1:15:11] amen amen if eve didn't like something a
[1:15:14] certain way
[1:15:15] adam had the power to move it he had the
[1:15:17] control
[1:15:19] they controlled the atmosphere and their
[1:15:22] surroundings
[1:15:23] that they lived in being fortified
[1:15:26] behind the word and being in the
[1:15:28] position that god ordained them
[1:15:30] to be in amen and then they were behind
[1:15:34] the word
[1:15:35] and then as long as they stayed behind
[1:15:37] the word amen amen god was with them
[1:15:39] remember when they got out from around
[1:15:41] the word they got out of their position
[1:15:44] and remember while they were behind the
[1:15:46] word and when they had control
[1:15:48] of the atmosphere they had control of
[1:15:50] every living thing around them they had
[1:15:52] control
[1:15:53] of the atmosphere in which they lived in
[1:15:57] do you believe that tonight but they
[1:16:00] fell
[1:16:01] from that but we are here to take that
[1:16:04] position
[1:16:05] back amen we're here to take that
[1:16:08] position back
[1:16:09] of what they held being the redeemed
[1:16:13] by the second adam jesus christ
[1:16:17] amen we're here as the redeemed sons and
[1:16:19] daughters of god
[1:16:20] aiming to take back our position do you
[1:16:22] believe that tonight
[1:16:23] when jesus overcame by the word he
[1:16:26] showed us the way
[1:16:27] jesus had power within himself to do
[1:16:30] whatever he wanted he had the very
[1:16:31] creative spoken word whatever he said
[1:16:35] it would be amen but that's not how
[1:16:37] we're to overcome so jesus
[1:16:39] couldn't set that thing forth amen but
[1:16:41] he come under the word
[1:16:43] he come under the power of the word and
[1:16:45] that's how jesus overcame
[1:16:46] and that's how you and i overcome
[1:16:49] tonight and we shall
[1:16:50] i believe we shall and we will i believe
[1:16:53] there's overcomers tonight but i believe
[1:16:54] we've got more to overcome
[1:16:56] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[1:16:58] sit with me on my throne
[1:16:59] it's a continual overcoming battle amen
[1:17:02] but i believe we'll overcome
[1:17:04] i believe we'll conquer amen we'll have
[1:17:06] dominion
[1:17:07] and then we'll stand in our position by
[1:17:10] the word
[1:17:10] and his spirit in us
[1:17:14] amen and not only stand behind the word
[1:17:18] as adam and eve did but to become the
[1:17:20] word
[1:17:22] amen because jesus wasn't just part of
[1:17:25] the word he was all of the word
[1:17:27] and so his bride comes in this day she's
[1:17:29] not she's not just part of the word she
[1:17:32] is the word
[1:17:33] she is she is miss jesus christ
[1:17:37] do you believe that tonight
[1:17:40] amen you got to set the you got to set
[1:17:43] the standard high
[1:17:45] amen for the bride of leo of this layout
[1:17:47] to see an age
[1:17:48] because that's what we're part of and
[1:17:51] when we're part of that but we're the
[1:17:52] final bride
[1:17:54] we're the bride that's not going to fall
[1:17:56] we're the bride that's going to stay
[1:17:57] with the word where the brother

[1:23:00] that i that i have need of give me more
[1:23:02] of it
[1:23:02] give me the love that i have have need
[1:23:05] up for my brother
[1:23:06] from my sister we can come to god
[1:23:10] amen he's not a god just some way out
[1:23:14] somewhere sitting on a in a big chair
[1:23:16] but he sits upon the throne of your
[1:23:17] heart
[1:23:18] he sits upon the throne of your heart
[1:23:20] and we know that he is out there we know
[1:23:22] that
[1:23:22] but it's not as far away as we think
[1:23:25] amen and god is not the impersonable god
[1:23:27] that we make him out to be
[1:23:28] amen but he's here with us he's here in
[1:23:30] us he said he never leave us nor forsake
[1:23:32] us that he'd be with us and he said
[1:23:34] greater is he
[1:23:35] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:23:36] world
[1:23:38] he just wants you to call upon his name
[1:23:41] give him your everything and then give
[1:23:44] him all your fears your worries
[1:23:46] all your all your complexes brother ben
[1:23:48] spoke about this
[1:23:50] sunday morning and i got a complex
[1:23:53] because brother ben
[1:23:54] preached on complexes because i wanted
[1:23:56] to preach on complexes
[1:23:59] and that's how that thing starts starts
[1:24:02] out over nothing
[1:24:05] that's where it goes
[1:24:08] but a complex give him give him your
[1:24:11] complexes give him your worries give him
[1:24:13] your cares
[1:24:14] give him everything that holds you back
[1:24:16] as a son or daughter of god
[1:24:18] amen from living in your divine
[1:24:20] privileges and your god give him rights
[1:24:22] give it all to him he wants us to cast
[1:24:25] our cares upon him
[1:24:26] i mean he wants you to give him your
[1:24:28] everything amen he wants to give him
[1:24:29] your needs your time your life your
[1:24:32] everything and when your failures
[1:24:34] your ups and downs he wants you to come
[1:24:36] him into his presence amen
[1:24:37] where you can be changed in those
[1:24:39] complexes and i won't touch this song
[1:24:41] but
[1:24:42] a complex is just a little thought that
[1:24:43] comes into your mind
[1:24:45] i mean a thought that someone doesn't
[1:24:46] like you or that god doesn't love me
[1:24:49] and then our hearts aren't right towards
[1:24:51] our brother
[1:24:53] and we get cut off from the blessings of
[1:24:55] god because we believe we think that god
[1:24:57] doesn't care about our need our
[1:24:58] situation
[1:24:59] that i can't ever get my healing so
[1:25:01] therefore god doesn't love me
[1:25:03] and you build this little thing up to
[1:25:04] where you can't really believe the word
[1:25:07] like you should
[1:25:08] and that's where it all starts just a
[1:25:10] little something amen but
[1:25:12] we've got to move beyond those things
[1:25:15] we've got to put those things behind us
[1:25:17] we've got to come to his throne amen
[1:25:19] amen and if we've got to come to the
[1:25:21] word
[1:25:23] we've got to come to a word because if
[1:25:25] you allow those things and then to rule
[1:25:26] your life it'll set
[1:25:28] the wrong kind of atmosphere around you
[1:25:30] and then it'll drive people away from
[1:25:32] you
[1:25:32] and it'll make you in a pitiful
[1:25:35] condition
[1:25:36] but if we'll take what god has said
[1:25:38] about us and i believe
[1:25:40] this tonight and i'm closing here but if
[1:25:42] we'll take what god has said about us in
[1:25:44] his word
[1:25:44] and truly believe him from the heart
[1:25:47] it'll create the right kind of
[1:25:49] atmosphere
[1:25:50] in our lives it'll it'll create the
[1:25:52] right kind of mindset that we can
[1:25:54] set forth today amen not with our heads
[1:25:56] drooped down but with our hands lifted
[1:25:58] high
[1:25:59] and then we can walk in victory amen not
[1:26:01] as a defeated
[1:26:02] person amen but as a son of god as a
[1:26:05] daughter of god
[1:26:06] amen knowing what the word is said about
[1:26:08] you amen knowing that you are the word
[1:26:12] and we can walk in faith we can walk in
[1:26:14] peace and joy and the power of god
[1:26:16] and then we can be healed amen because i
[1:26:18] don't have any kind of complex anything
[1:26:20] built up in my mind against god
[1:26:23] i can have my joy restored amen because
[1:26:26] we're always in need
[1:26:27] we're always a people in need and when
[1:26:29] the people of laodicea they're rich and
[1:26:31] increased with goods
[1:26:32] and have need of nothing amen but we as
[1:26:34] the bride we as the church
[1:26:36] is the final voice of the final aj man
[1:26:38] amen we we
[1:26:39] the bride is is the last she's the last
[1:26:42] one she's going to stay true to the word
[1:26:44] but she's always in need
[1:26:45] and then his sons and daughters are
[1:26:47] always in need

[1:27:28] sisters humble ourselves before
[1:27:30] before god amen if you
[1:27:33] if you love god you'll love his people
