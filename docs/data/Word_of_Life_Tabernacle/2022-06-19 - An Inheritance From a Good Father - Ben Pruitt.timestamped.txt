[52:52] see you back here this morning each and
[52:54] every one of you happy father's day to
[52:55] you i uh
[52:57] my kids my daughters well all of my
[53:00] children gave me a card this morning and
[53:02] and uh it was a good card but they
[53:05] signed it kind of differently they they
[53:08] put down there esther she started off
[53:10] like she said well
[53:12] she said dad she said i'm aren't you
[53:14] glad that i'm not like these other
[53:16] children
[53:19] she said my siblings that are you know
[53:21] give you such a hard time she said
[53:23] aren't you glad that i'm not like that
[53:25] and reminded me of the pharisee praying
[53:27] in the temple you know
[53:29] and
[53:30] melody had on the other side she had her
[53:32] own
[53:33] little blurb there that she had written
[53:34] and she said aren't you glad i'm not
[53:36] like my other siblings you know
[53:39] and uh
[53:40] peter he just wrote his name so he had
[53:43] no defense
[53:45] but uh it was glad to get that but you
[53:48] know we passed that on to our children i
[53:49] uh
[53:50] uh was thinking that that's you know me
[53:52] and joel we do that you know to each
[53:54] other and all the time and so we leave
[53:57] things to our kids i i read a story
[53:59] where there was a small boy sitting at a
[54:01] dinner table and just shoving food in
[54:03] his mouth with both hands and his father
[54:06] said son don't make a pig out of
[54:07] yourself
[54:08] and it didn't slow the boy down and
[54:11] father said son do you know what a pig
[54:12] is
[54:14] and he's still shoving in the food and
[54:15] the boy said yes sir it's an old hogs
[54:18] little boy
[54:21] so
[54:22] we
[54:25] we definitely teach our children don't
[54:27] we
[54:29] i want to preach to you about a good
[54:30] father this morning the kind of
[54:32] inheritance a good father gives because
[54:35] the bible says a good man leaves an
[54:37] inheritance to his children's children
[54:40] a good man
[54:41] a good father is difficult to find
[54:44] good men are harder to find than pianos
[54:46] at church of christ convention
[54:48] and some of you'll get that later but
[54:52] you know our culture doesn't value
[54:54] fatherhood right i uh
[54:57] and i won't get into the difference in
[54:58] mother's day and father's day we won't
[55:00] go there but
[55:01] we don't value fathers like we should i
[55:04] fathers are important i
[55:06] they say that one in four children live
[55:09] without any kind of a father not
[55:10] biological stepfather or adoptive father
[55:13] one in four live without any kind of a
[55:15] father in the home
[55:17] and that's enough children to fill new
[55:20] york city twice or los angeles four
[55:22] times over without fathers
[55:25] and they shows research shows that it
[55:28] impacts children in a negative way
[55:30] they're four times they have a four
[55:32] times greater risk of poverty they're
[55:35] more likely to have
[55:36] problems in their behavior
[55:38] they are twice as likely to die as
[55:40] infants
[55:42] they're seven times more likely to
[55:43] become pregnant as teens the girls
[55:46] they're more likely to face abuse and
[55:48] neglect more likely to abuse drugs and
[55:50] alcohol twice as likely to suffer
[55:52] obesity
[55:54] twice as likely to drop out of school
[55:56] and you know and we see that fathers are
[55:59] often portrayed in the media as
[56:01] goofballs drinking beer and watching
[56:04] sports and telling bad jokes and maybe
[56:06] some of that fits but
[56:08] but you know i
[56:10] i challenge you if you go out in the
[56:11] media today you don't find a positive
[56:13] father figure you if you do they try to
[56:15] portray them with some kind of a meek
[56:17] man who never says anything and stays
[56:19] home and washes the dishes hasn't that
[56:21] been a change in our time that uh
[56:23] nothing wrong with the man washing
[56:24] dishes but the commercials during our
[56:26] time all the detergent commercials now
[56:29] have men in them and and they expect
[56:31] that and the women are portrayed as
[56:33] dominant and go out in the workforce i'm
[56:35] glad god made a woman a real woman and
[56:38] put her in her in the right place where
[56:39] she's supposed to be where she does a
[56:41] good job and i'm glad god made a man a
[56:44] real man and and able to do what god
[56:46] wants him to do and but you look at the
[56:48] commercials that are that are out there
[56:50] and
[56:51] and how that they've changed and we
[56:53] could look around and you could see
[56:55] maybe even in your own life you say well
[56:57] i i don't see very many good fathers
[57:00] maybe you didn't even have a good father
[57:01] some of you did
[57:03] but others maybe perhaps didn't have a
[57:04] good father and
[57:06] and you look at the example of that and
[57:08] you think where will i find the example
[57:10] of a good father
[57:12] where could there be an example that
[57:13] could be shown to me something that i
[57:15] could look at and i could say that's a
[57:16] good father well i think we'll find that
[57:19] in the scriptures and
[57:20] and i think when i think of a father in
[57:22] the scriptures i think of abraham
[57:25] the bible says
[57:26] in 8 genesis 18 17 the lord said shall i
[57:29] hide from abraham that thing which i do
[57:33] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[57:35] a great and mighty nation and all the
[57:38] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[57:40] him why he said because i know him
[57:43] i know him that he will command his
[57:45] children and his household after him and
[57:48] they shall keep the way
[57:50] of the lord to do justice and judgment
[57:53] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[57:55] that which he has spoken of him he says
[57:58] i know he'll be a good father
[58:01] so abraham is a father that not the
[58:04] world calls good the culture didn't say
[58:07] that he was a good father the people
[58:09] around him it wasn't his kids that made
[58:11] him father of the year but it was
[58:13] actually god himself and i'll tell you
[58:15] what as a dad myself today that's what i
[58:18] want i want god to say
[58:20] you're a good father
[58:22] you're a good father you've done the
[58:24] right things and you've taught your
[58:25] children correctly and so the bible says
[58:27] he'll command his children
[58:30] and you think about it this father of
[58:31] the year why why was he father of the
[58:33] year in heaven he was there because he
[58:36] put god first
[58:38] you remember it was abraham who took his
[58:39] own son now we wouldn't put him up for
[58:42] father of the year because he takes his
[58:44] own son
[58:45] makes him carry the wood
[58:49] seems like a mean dad don't he
[58:51] makes him carry the wood
[58:53] to be sacrificed
[58:56] on the mountain and the boy looked at
[58:57] him he'd been taught well he said here's
[58:59] the wood here's the fire but where's the
[59:01] lamb
[59:03] oh my
[59:04] but god said he's a good father because
[59:07] he put god first
[59:09] he said somehow god's going to protect
[59:11] my children i'm going to put god first
[59:13] i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm going
[59:15] to go to church and god will take care
[59:17] of my children where is the father like
[59:19] that today he will stand up and say i'm
[59:22] going to put god first i'm going to
[59:23] believe the word i'm going to do what
[59:25] god says
[59:27] god will take care of my children if
[59:29] i'll put god first
[59:31] he's a good father who'll command his
[59:32] children
[59:33] to do the right things
[59:35] the bible tells us god is our father in
[59:37] matthew 6 and 9
[59:39] says after this manner therefore pray ye
[59:40] our father
[59:42] our father which art in heaven
[59:45] well if you don't have a good father
[59:47] on the earth you've got one in heaven
[59:51] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[59:53] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[59:57] done in earth as it is in heaven
[1:00:00] notice how he
[1:00:01] how he tells us to pray like children
[1:00:04] it's a children's prayer but he didn't
[1:00:06] limit it to children
[1:00:08] right a child can pray it he said give
[1:00:11] us this day our daily bread
[1:00:14] and forgive us our debts
[1:00:16] as we forgive our debtors
[1:00:20] lead us not into temptation
[1:00:22] but deliver us from evil
[1:00:24] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:00:27] and the glory forever
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] why would he would he give us such a
[1:00:32] simple
[1:00:33] prayer such a such a direct thing with
[1:00:35] at such contrast to the way the
[1:00:37] pharisees prayed when they went out and
[1:00:39] made long speeches and prayed for the
[1:00:41] governor and the president and
[1:00:42] everything else and
[1:00:43] and used all kinds of big words but he
[1:00:45] said just say our father
[1:00:48] because your father knows what you have
[1:00:50] need of
[1:00:51] your father is capable amen a good
[1:00:54] father is capable of taking care of the
[1:00:57] ones that he produces they're his
[1:00:59] children listen to me this morning
[1:01:00] you're god's children you don't belong
[1:01:02] to the devil you don't belong to the
[1:01:04] world you don't belong to the culture
[1:01:06] you're a child of god
[1:01:08] and because you're a child of god you
[1:01:10] could look at him simply and say my
[1:01:11] father
[1:01:12] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:01:15] give me my daily bread he'll take care
[1:01:17] of you he knows what you need
[1:01:20] you don't know how much you need of an
[1:01:22] allowance but god knows
[1:01:25] are you with me now he gives you an
[1:01:27] allowance you know i give my kids
[1:01:29] well i really don't but
[1:01:31] i'm supposed to give my kids an
[1:01:33] allowance manny do you get an allowance
[1:01:36] you don't even know what that is yeah he
[1:01:37] does
[1:01:38] get an allowance and what that means is
[1:01:40] that you get a little a certain amount
[1:01:42] well you know you don't usually get to
[1:01:44] pick the amount
[1:01:45] because if you pick the amount you'd ask
[1:01:47] for more you should go home and ask for
[1:01:48] more
[1:01:50] but
[1:01:52] asking faith that's right
[1:01:54] but if you pick if you picked the amount
[1:01:56] it would be a lot
[1:01:58] right but he knows how much you need
[1:02:02] and if and if my father only gave me 25
[1:02:04] cents he wasn't going to give me 25
[1:02:06] cents and expect me to go out and make
[1:02:08] do with that 25 cents and pay the light
[1:02:10] bill and take care of no he was going to
[1:02:12] take care of me
[1:02:14] are you with me now if god gives you an
[1:02:16] allowance of joy if you give you an
[1:02:18] allowance of peace if you give you an
[1:02:20] allowance of of the good things of life
[1:02:23] and you say well that's not enough lord
[1:02:24] don't you know he's got enough to take
[1:02:26] care of you he's got enough extra to
[1:02:28] take care of you whatever he gives you
[1:02:30] you just be grateful for that
[1:02:32] give us our daily bread give us what we
[1:02:34] have need of give us enough yes
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:38] do you believe he's a good father today
[1:02:41] brother branham said oh isn't he a good
[1:02:43] god
[1:02:44] jesus is so good to us
[1:02:46] he said and it's well expressed that our
[1:02:48] god is a good god he is so good to his
[1:02:51] children he has provided every good
[1:02:53] thing for us
[1:02:55] everything that we have need of he has
[1:02:57] provided it do you believe that today
[1:03:00] truly you can say our father who art in
[1:03:03] heaven because he is a father and though
[1:03:06] we be disobedient though we be arrogant
[1:03:09] he still provides for us just the same
[1:03:12] oh do you believe that today
[1:03:14] though we'd be dead listen when you
[1:03:16] your father if you had a good father
[1:03:18] here on the earth if you messed up if
[1:03:20] you acted inappropriately he may have
[1:03:23] chastised you he may have given you a
[1:03:24] spanking hopefully he did but if but
[1:03:27] when it come when it all come out in the
[1:03:28] wash he didn't quit providing for you he
[1:03:31] didn't quit caring about you he didn't
[1:03:33] quit giving you what you had need of are
[1:03:35] you with me this morning we think many
[1:03:37] times well i've messed up i i've done
[1:03:40] things that are wrong and so god won't
[1:03:41] provide for me anymore but he's a good
[1:03:43] father he still cares about you he'll
[1:03:46] correct you he'll let you go through
[1:03:48] some trials but he's a good father he
[1:03:50] won't tempt you more than you're able he
[1:03:52] won't put you through more than what you
[1:03:53] can take you believe that today he's a
[1:03:55] good father
[1:03:57] amen he said though we were disbe
[1:03:59] disobedient
[1:04:01] though he'd be arrogant
[1:04:03] he still provides for us just the same
[1:04:06] whether we are good or whether we are
[1:04:07] bad he gives us food to eat
[1:04:10] clothes to wear a house to dwell in
[1:04:14] oh he is so good
[1:04:16] if we would just look around and count
[1:04:18] the good things
[1:04:19] that he is to us
[1:04:21] he said we don't stop to consider that
[1:04:24] what if you had no eyes
[1:04:28] what if you had no eyes
[1:04:30] that's the person said i thought i was
[1:04:31] having a bad day
[1:04:34] because i didn't have new shoes until i
[1:04:35] met a man who had no feet
[1:04:39] what if you had no eyes
[1:04:41] what if you had no nose
[1:04:42] you had no mouth you had no ears what if
[1:04:45] you had no feet or limbs you could not
[1:04:46] walk around
[1:04:48] but see he provided you feet
[1:04:50] what if you had no eyes and could not
[1:04:52] see yet you could hear noises but you
[1:04:55] knew not what they were he said now then
[1:04:57] it's all in the five senses that he
[1:04:59] provides
[1:05:00] but then i love this so he provides that
[1:05:03] for us in the natural all the things we
[1:05:04] have need of
[1:05:06] he provides that for us but then if
[1:05:09] we'll just live close to him
[1:05:11] he'll provide something else for us
[1:05:14] he said that is an insight that we can
[1:05:16] see what the ordinary person never sees
[1:05:20] when we're born again we see him
[1:05:23] that's why some people can't see him
[1:05:25] it's because they've never been born
[1:05:26] again
[1:05:27] when we're born again he gives us an
[1:05:29] insight he provides even for those who
[1:05:31] reject his word
[1:05:32] oh don't you see the loving hand of
[1:05:35] jehovah today the loving hand of god
[1:05:37] that provides even for the just and the
[1:05:39] unjust but if you're born again he gives
[1:05:41] you an extra insight
[1:05:43] he gives you beyond what the ordinary
[1:05:45] person can see
[1:05:46] he said you know him you've seen him he
[1:05:49] will abide with you forever oh he is a
[1:05:52] good father he is the fountain of
[1:05:54] goodness how many believe that today the
[1:05:56] great resources of all resources of all
[1:05:59] goodness and fatherhood belongs in our
[1:06:01] god where would we look today and see an
[1:06:03] example of a good father where could we
[1:06:05] look and see an example of someone who
[1:06:08] who would be a
[1:06:09] father that we could look up to we can
[1:06:11] look around and we can see many good
[1:06:13] fathers but if we look to heaven we see
[1:06:15] a perfect father
[1:06:17] one who provides exactly what we have
[1:06:19] need of
[1:06:20] yet many of his children
[1:06:22] look at him and say oh he's not good
[1:06:25] word isn't good he hasn't given me
[1:06:28] enough
[1:06:29] oh but the ungrateful children don't
[1:06:31] change
[1:06:32] how the father feels
[1:06:34] about his children
[1:06:37] amen aren't you glad to be his children
[1:06:38] today
[1:06:40] you see a good father the scripture
[1:06:42] tells us a good man
[1:06:45] leaves an inheritance
[1:06:47] not just to his children
[1:06:49] but to his children's children i want to
[1:06:52] dwell on that now in them if you put
[1:06:54] your spiritual thinking caps on in a
[1:06:56] spiritual way because we know that's
[1:06:58] true in the natural a good man will work
[1:07:01] and provide for his family
[1:07:03] and he provides in such a way and i
[1:07:05] don't mean just materially but also in a
[1:07:08] in a spiritual way he provides in such a
[1:07:10] way it'll go down to his kids and to his
[1:07:13] grandkids because he's provided for them
[1:07:15] he provides a home he provides a place
[1:07:18] for them he provides he'll go to church
[1:07:20] he'll maybe move his family across the
[1:07:23] country to get them in a good church why
[1:07:25] it's a good man
[1:07:26] and his children benefit from that
[1:07:30] his grandchildren benefit from that
[1:07:33] a good man his children benefit his
[1:07:35] grandchildren benefit but now look at it
[1:07:37] in a spiritual sense because if our god
[1:07:39] our god is a good god he's a good father
[1:07:43] if he's a good father he leaves an
[1:07:44] inheritance to his children's
[1:07:48] children
[1:07:49] and we know there's no
[1:07:51] grandchildren when it comes
[1:07:53] to the lord to the spiritual things but
[1:07:55] we are
[1:07:56] an inheritor
[1:07:58] of another generation generation after
[1:08:00] generation has come and gone since he
[1:08:03] came and and he died here on the cross
[1:08:05] for us
[1:08:06] generation after generation has come and
[1:08:08] what that means is that the inheritance
[1:08:11] is not diminished by generation
[1:08:16] are you hearing me this morning
[1:08:18] what the first age got yes
[1:08:21] amen the same holy ghost that they got
[1:08:25] is the same holy ghost that we get
[1:08:28] a good man right
[1:08:30] oh my when i looked at this it's a
[1:08:32] simple thought but when i begin to think
[1:08:33] about it i begin to think lord what is
[1:08:35] it that that you're trying to show me
[1:08:37] you're trying to show me that you're the
[1:08:39] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:08:41] you leave an inheritance not just to the
[1:08:44] ones in the first church age but to this
[1:08:46] age
[1:08:47] to my day
[1:08:48] not just to brother branham's time the
[1:08:50] inheritance didn't run out in 1965 right
[1:08:53] the inheritance didn't run out in 2010
[1:08:56] it didn't run out whenever you you
[1:08:58] received the holy ghost but it's still
[1:08:59] the same today
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:03] the inheritance is not diminished and
[1:09:04] the bible tells us that the holy ghost
[1:09:06] is the earnest of our inheritance or it
[1:09:08] is that portion of our inheritance that
[1:09:10] we receive on this side
[1:09:12] does that make sense
[1:09:14] he's given us an earnest a percentage
[1:09:17] of our inheritance it's not the fullness
[1:09:19] of it because one of these days we won't
[1:09:21] have to worry about getting sick no more
[1:09:23] we don't have to worry about being hot
[1:09:24] no more
[1:09:25] we don't have to worry about getting
[1:09:27] cold we won't have to worry about
[1:09:29] shelter or food or any of these things
[1:09:30] we don't have to worry about it because
[1:09:32] he's going to provide us a new body and
[1:09:34] a home and all of those things
[1:09:36] but now
[1:09:37] we live in a body of flesh but the holy
[1:09:39] ghost is the earnest or the down payment
[1:09:42] or the portion of our inheritance
[1:09:45] that we get now
[1:09:47] and back in bible days you could
[1:09:48] actually get a portion of your
[1:09:50] inheritance early you remember the
[1:09:51] prodigal son he took his inheritance
[1:09:53] early
[1:09:54] and he went out and spent it but he was
[1:09:56] still the father's son
[1:09:59] amen but now the holy ghost is given to
[1:10:01] us as the portion of our inheritance the
[1:10:03] earnest
[1:10:04] of our inheritance to down payment on
[1:10:07] our inheritance so it's a guarantee and
[1:10:09] we could go into that this morning
[1:10:11] it's a guarantee and a seal that says
[1:10:13] that that inheritance cannot be
[1:10:15] diminished
[1:10:17] so if it is diminished in our life and i
[1:10:19] want us to be serious about this today
[1:10:21] as we've talked about fathers and all
[1:10:23] these things but if the holy ghost has
[1:10:25] diminished it all in our lives it is not
[1:10:27] because of the holy ghost
[1:10:30] it's not because it's not for us
[1:10:33] it's not because it's not for our day
[1:10:36] but if the holy ghost is diminished in
[1:10:38] our life if the influence of it is
[1:10:39] diminished in any way for you and i it's
[1:10:42] because that we have backslid from him
[1:10:45] because we've grieved him away
[1:10:47] he said but brother ben what should i do
[1:10:49] you should come back to it
[1:10:51] you should go back to where you left him
[1:10:52] and you should say lord i know your holy
[1:10:55] ghost is for me i know this inheritance
[1:10:57] is for me i know healing is mine i know
[1:11:00] salvation is mine
[1:11:02] i know the word is mine
[1:11:04] so if it is diminished in any way
[1:11:08] in our lives
[1:11:09] we need to go back where we left it
[1:11:12] because he's a good father
[1:11:15] he gives the inheritance to his
[1:11:16] children's children notice
[1:11:18] it's not diminished or used up in acts 2
[1:11:21] 39
[1:11:22] he said for the promise it's unto you
[1:11:25] say thank the lord it's to them
[1:11:28] and to your children
[1:11:30] and to all that are afar off
[1:11:33] even as many
[1:11:35] as the lord our god shall call
[1:11:37] hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the
[1:11:40] same
[1:11:41] yesterday today
[1:11:43] and forever now
[1:11:44] brother branham said we know exactly
[1:11:46] from the word which was recorded by the
[1:11:47] holy spirit how the first or original
[1:11:50] church was founded so we don't have to
[1:11:52] guess about what the inheritance was
[1:11:57] what did it mean for them to have the
[1:11:59] holy ghost
[1:12:00] we went through that in acts chapter 2
[1:12:02] how that they staggered out like drunk
[1:12:04] men but that wasn't the end of it right
[1:12:06] it wasn't just an emotion or a feeling
[1:12:08] though that was part of it
[1:12:10] they received that they had an emotion
[1:12:12] they had a feeling they staggered like
[1:12:13] drunk men they had a good service but
[1:12:15] they went beyond that and the bible says
[1:12:17] they broke bread daily
[1:12:19] with the apostles they they fellowship
[1:12:21] together their lives were changed they
[1:12:23] were called christians because they
[1:12:25] walked like christ and the people could
[1:12:27] see they'd been with jesus and they go
[1:12:29] down to the gate beautiful and they walk
[1:12:30] down there as a man who's laying from
[1:12:32] his from his birth and he says such as i
[1:12:34] have i give why that was the inheritance
[1:12:37] are you with me today
[1:12:39] the inheritance is not diminished
[1:12:42] and if you're here this morning you're
[1:12:44] sick or you're
[1:12:45] or or there's sin in your life or
[1:12:47] there's something that you think well i
[1:12:49] i just can't seem to overcome that the
[1:12:51] inheritance is not diminished
[1:12:54] from generation to generation
[1:12:56] that's why i still believe god calls
[1:12:58] preachers today
[1:13:00] i still believe god calls men and women
[1:13:02] today of the word i still believe he
[1:13:05] calls a church today to be like that
[1:13:07] first church
[1:13:08] and we know what that first church was
[1:13:11] because it was recorded by the holy
[1:13:13] spirit
[1:13:14] how it was founded yes
[1:13:16] and how god manifested himself in her
[1:13:20] he said the word can't change or be
[1:13:22] changed
[1:13:24] because the word is god in the beginning
[1:13:26] was the word and the word was with god
[1:13:28] and the word was
[1:13:29] god
[1:13:30] so he goes on to say to change one word
[1:13:32] of it is did he bring sin
[1:13:35] and death
[1:13:36] it says in revelation 22 18 if any man
[1:13:38] shall add unto these things god shall
[1:13:39] add to him the plagues that are written
[1:13:41] in this book any man shall take away
[1:13:42] from the words of the book of this
[1:13:44] prophecy god shall take away the part
[1:13:45] out of the book of life out of the holy
[1:13:47] city from the things which are written
[1:13:48] in this book why would you want to add
[1:13:49] to or take away when a good father gave
[1:13:52] it to you in the form that it is
[1:13:55] he's a good father
[1:13:57] he said now he said that's what the
[1:14:00] church was at pentecost
[1:14:04] he didn't say was the standard
[1:14:07] but is the standard
[1:14:11] he said well we're not what they were at
[1:14:12] pentecost now wait a minute when you say
[1:14:14] that
[1:14:15] you may not be
[1:14:18] yeah brother branham always said it this
[1:14:20] way he said don't he said i may not have
[1:14:22] the faith that enoch did he said i won't
[1:14:24] stand in somebody else's way
[1:14:28] are you with me this morning somebody's
[1:14:30] got to
[1:14:32] what the church was at pentecost is the
[1:14:34] standard but i think if you go back and
[1:14:36] study it out you'll find they were still
[1:14:37] human
[1:14:39] you'll find they still fuss sometimes
[1:14:41] you'll find they still had church
[1:14:43] problems they needed deacons
[1:14:45] to take care of the church problems
[1:14:47] because people were getting offended at
[1:14:48] one another i'm so glad deacons are in
[1:14:50] charge of that
[1:14:53] just messing with you brothers that's
[1:14:56] why deacons were invented you know that
[1:14:58] that's why god allowed deacons in the
[1:14:59] church it's because because the the
[1:15:01] greeks and the jews got offended at one
[1:15:03] another but who was getting served first
[1:15:05] at the at the buffet
[1:15:08] at the church potluck
[1:15:12] and so the preacher said we don't have
[1:15:13] time to mess with this
[1:15:15] we need to be giving time to the word
[1:15:17] you deacons go take care of it
[1:15:19] and so god appealing to men full of the
[1:15:20] holy ghost to take care of it
[1:15:22] but that's the pattern
[1:15:25] that's the pattern that's as much part
[1:15:27] of the pattern as them staggering like
[1:15:29] junk men out of the upper room that's
[1:15:30] the pattern there is no other pattern
[1:15:33] right yes sir are you with me this
[1:15:35] morning no matter what the scholars say
[1:15:38] god has not changed that pattern
[1:15:41] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[1:15:44] on doing until the church ages close
[1:15:48] oh my
[1:15:50] do we believe a prophet or don't we
[1:15:53] he said those scholars may tell you
[1:15:55] scholars we have scholars today
[1:15:58] try to tell you that the apostolic age
[1:16:01] is over don't you believe it
[1:16:05] yes
[1:16:06] don't you believe it a good man's
[1:16:09] inheritance
[1:16:10] is left to his children's children
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:15] he said such a statement is wrong on two
[1:16:17] counts first of all it is wrong to
[1:16:18] suppose there aren't any more apostles
[1:16:21] because the original 12 were dead he
[1:16:22] said an apostle means a sin one there
[1:16:24] are many sent ones today they are called
[1:16:26] missionaries yes
[1:16:28] we don't need to go back and call them
[1:16:29] apostles brother says the same thing
[1:16:31] yeah
[1:16:32] right but we know what they are yeah he
[1:16:34] said they're called missionaries we
[1:16:36] don't have to make them something else
[1:16:37] to make them lords over a bunch of
[1:16:38] churches
[1:16:40] right because that spirit exists out
[1:16:42] there but but that's not what we do when
[1:16:44] we go overseas we don't go over there to
[1:16:46] become the apostle of a bunch of
[1:16:47] different churches
[1:16:49] we go as missionaries or or as a pastor
[1:16:52] as an evangelist to help the bride of
[1:16:53] christ in another part of the world
[1:16:56] right but they have their own pastors
[1:16:59] right the goal is to set them up where
[1:17:00] they have their own pastors they have
[1:17:01] their own teachers their own deacons
[1:17:04] and we won't have a word to say about
[1:17:05] what they do
[1:17:06] or who they have in to preach
[1:17:09] because that's not apostolic that's
[1:17:11] catholic
[1:17:12] but he said as long as men are being
[1:17:14] called as long as men are being called
[1:17:17] and sent forth with the word of life
[1:17:20] there is an apostolic age
[1:17:22] going on
[1:17:24] so god called men will not sit down
[1:17:28] and quit preaching
[1:17:31] i i know i talk about this a lot but
[1:17:33] it's important for us today
[1:17:35] you understand god called me and they're
[1:17:37] not going to quit preaching see whatever
[1:17:39] standard we believe in is the standard
[1:17:41] that we'll hold ourselves to
[1:17:43] if we take the standard of the church of
[1:17:46] being however we grew up
[1:17:48] then that's all we'll ever be that's all
[1:17:50] the potential we'll ever have right
[1:17:52] if the standard of the church
[1:17:55] is what the world is now if you could
[1:17:57] look out and say so-and-so's church in
[1:17:59] the world and
[1:18:00] and a mega church of some kind if what
[1:18:02] you see on television is the standard
[1:18:04] for the church then that's all we'll
[1:18:06] ever be
[1:18:08] but the church today is cold and formal
[1:18:10] and powerless having a form of godliness
[1:18:13] but denying the power thereof
[1:18:16] are you with me that's the laodicean
[1:18:18] church
[1:18:18] that's not our standard
[1:18:21] and so we have to struggle for a higher
[1:18:24] standard just like you do and said dad
[1:18:26] you got to struggle to a higher standard
[1:18:28] you may not do everything like you're
[1:18:30] supposed to do at times you may make the
[1:18:32] wrong choices the wrong decisions but
[1:18:34] what do you do you struggle for a higher
[1:18:35] standard because we have one
[1:18:38] our standard is not some cartoon
[1:18:40] character
[1:18:43] in my time it's went from
[1:18:45] andy taylor on tv to homer simpson if
[1:18:48] you know who that is
[1:18:50] i'm sorry
[1:18:53] but it went from the from from from
[1:18:56] being positive to being negative
[1:18:58] but the standard is not
[1:19:00] what's portrayed on television
[1:19:03] the standard is not even what other
[1:19:04] people do
[1:19:06] the standard is the word
[1:19:10] the standard is the word
[1:19:12] and the word said as many amen as the
[1:19:15] lord our god shall call then if the word
[1:19:18] said we can have church we can have
[1:19:19] church if the word said we can we can
[1:19:22] shout then we can shout if the word said
[1:19:24] the gifts were supposed to be in the
[1:19:25] church they'll be in the church if the
[1:19:26] word says
[1:19:28] are you with me this morning if the word
[1:19:30] says by his stripes i'm healed i can
[1:19:32] claim my healing this morning because
[1:19:34] god said so that's the standard
[1:19:37] amen he said no there's not even one
[1:19:40] scripture
[1:19:42] he said that suggests that
[1:19:45] but many
[1:19:46] conclusively state
[1:19:48] otherwise
[1:19:50] look at his standard it's the scripture
[1:19:54] he said here is our proof now the one
[1:19:56] thing that they were saying is that the
[1:19:57] apostolic age is over because there's no
[1:19:59] more missionaries the other they were
[1:20:01] saying is that the that was just for the
[1:20:02] age of the apostles
[1:20:04] he said here's our proof that both these
[1:20:06] charges are false
[1:20:07] then peter said unto them repent
[1:20:09] be baptized everyone this is the proof
[1:20:12] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:20:13] christ for the remission of sins you
[1:20:14] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:20:16] but the promise is unto you and your
[1:20:17] children and all that are far off even
[1:20:19] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:20:23] so brother branham says that this way he
[1:20:24] said the promise of power with which the
[1:20:26] apostles were endured at pentecost is to
[1:20:28] you jews
[1:20:30] to your children jews and all that are
[1:20:32] far off gentiles
[1:20:35] amen to his meaningless the lord our god
[1:20:36] shall call both you and gentile
[1:20:39] until he stops calling
[1:20:41] the pentecostal message in power come on
[1:20:44] will not cease yes sir
[1:20:47] oh hallelujah do you believe that today
[1:20:49] and what does that do it gives us hope
[1:20:51] today it gives us hope we can have
[1:20:53] families that are by the word it gives
[1:20:55] us hope we can have real dads we can
[1:20:56] have real moms we can have real children
[1:20:59] in the faith we can have real pastors it
[1:21:00] gives us hope we don't have to set any
[1:21:02] other standard yes then what he said
[1:21:06] until he stops calling the pentecostal
[1:21:08] message in power will not cease
[1:21:10] listen he says what the church had at
[1:21:12] pentecost
[1:21:14] is her inalienable right right yes sir
[1:21:20] now someone tried to come and take your
[1:21:21] gun off of you
[1:21:23] don't raise your hand if you've got a
[1:21:24] gun with you in church
[1:21:27] huh but somebody tried to come take your
[1:21:28] guns off of you
[1:21:31] huh think about it
[1:21:32] what would you do
[1:21:34] that's my inalienable right
[1:21:38] you wouldn't be sitting there just
[1:21:40] complacent
[1:21:42] let them do it promote safety
[1:21:47] boy it's sticky right now
[1:21:50] you wouldn't let them take that away
[1:21:51] what if they took you right to free
[1:21:52] speech
[1:21:54] you can only say what the government
[1:21:55] tells you to say
[1:21:58] huh
[1:22:00] i would fight for that
[1:22:02] right
[1:22:03] what if they took your right to assemble
[1:22:06] to peaceably assemble
[1:22:07] we take advantage of that right every
[1:22:09] sunday morning
[1:22:10] and the right to free speech
[1:22:12] you realize that the right to free
[1:22:13] speech is the right to to good speech
[1:22:15] and stupid speech
[1:22:18] it's the right to speak
[1:22:20] right but you would never let somebody
[1:22:22] take that from you why you're an
[1:22:24] american i think sometimes we forget who
[1:22:26] we are
[1:22:27] we're sons and daughters of god
[1:22:30] you have an inalienable right to what
[1:22:32] the church had at pentecost you believed
[1:22:34] the word of god this morning you have an
[1:22:36] inalienable right to what the church had
[1:22:38] at pentecost
[1:22:40] an inalienable right he said originally
[1:22:42] she had the pure word of god she had the
[1:22:44] power of the spirit manifested in
[1:22:46] diverse signs and wonders
[1:22:48] he said in gifts of the holy ghost
[1:22:49] that's what she had and if that's what
[1:22:52] she had that's what we can have
[1:22:54] how many believe that today
[1:22:57] amen
[1:22:58] amen
[1:23:00] sorry i
[1:23:02] get too excited
[1:23:04] brother branham goes on to read
[1:23:07] hebrews chapter 2.
[1:23:10] hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1
[1:23:12] it says therefore
[1:23:14] we ought to give the more earnest heed
[1:23:16] to the things which we have heard
[1:23:18] lest it anytime
[1:23:20] you've heard it you're right
[1:23:23] he said we ought to give heed to that
[1:23:25] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:23:28] yes
[1:23:29] float away
[1:23:31] drift
[1:23:32] for if the word spoken by angels was
[1:23:35] steadfast and every listen people today
[1:23:38] say well you can't preach the gospel
[1:23:39] anymore but jesus said
[1:23:43] preach the gospel
[1:23:45] to every creature
[1:23:47] if the word spoken by angels was
[1:23:49] steadfast
[1:23:51] and every transgression and disobedience
[1:23:54] received a just recompense of reward how
[1:23:56] shall we escape
[1:23:59] i love paul's language here if we
[1:24:01] neglect
[1:24:04] not if we reject
[1:24:06] but how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:24:09] yes
[1:24:12] so it's our responsibility not just
[1:24:15] to say there's preachers in the church
[1:24:17] to say there's gifts in the church but
[1:24:18] to make sure they're there right yes sir
[1:24:23] how shall we escape
[1:24:25] if we neglect
[1:24:27] so great salvation
[1:24:29] oh my that's how so many is backside
[1:24:31] today i tell so many why so many are not
[1:24:33] in church not because they rejected it
[1:24:35] not because they turned around or they
[1:24:37] got on some website and they told them
[1:24:38] something different but because they
[1:24:40] neglected it
[1:24:43] how shall we escape
[1:24:45] yes
[1:24:47] oh god
[1:24:48] if we neglect to pray
[1:24:50] if we neglect to read our bibles if we
[1:24:53] neglect to believe that that power is
[1:24:55] for us
[1:24:56] how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:24:59] so great salvation
[1:25:02] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:25:04] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:25:06] them that heard him
[1:25:08] god also bearing them witness
[1:25:10] notice how it was given to us both with
[1:25:12] signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:25:14] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:25:16] according to his own will
[1:25:18] this is my inheritance
[1:25:21] this is what came down to the children's
[1:25:23] children
[1:25:25] from a good father
[1:25:27] it was salvation it was sanctification
[1:25:30] it was healing
[1:25:32] amen it was gifts of the spirit
[1:25:34] it was a five-fold ministry
[1:25:36] it was the word the full word the open
[1:25:38] book of the hour this is my inheritance
[1:25:42] it's time we begin to supply in the
[1:25:44] world creep into our homes and the world
[1:25:46] creeps into our churches and and a lacks
[1:25:48] idea say well it doesn't really matter
[1:25:50] what kind of service we have doesn't
[1:25:52] really matter if we ever pray it doesn't
[1:25:54] really matter if the holy ghost ever
[1:25:55] strikes us if the atmosphere is never
[1:25:57] right we'll just keep on going on
[1:25:58] because we're predestined anyway no how
[1:26:00] shall we escape if we neglect
[1:26:03] such a great inheritance has been given
[1:26:05] to us
[1:26:06] amen that come with diverse miracles and
[1:26:09] gifts of the holy spirit well if it came
[1:26:11] that way it's still the same today

[1:26:57] that the locusts have eaten the cake

[1:27:04] each worm come down began to eat away to
[1:27:06] bark at the fruit and the bark and

[1:27:36] not eating
[1:27:38] oh i was raised in my mama's house where
[1:27:40] if we didn't eat plenty it wasn't
[1:27:42] because there wasn't plenty it was
[1:27:44] because we weren't eating are you
[1:27:46] hearing me now at my house it's not
[1:27:48] there's plenty of food in the fridge
[1:27:49] there's plenty if you come to my house
[1:27:51] and you don't eat plenty it's because
[1:27:52] you're not eating if you come to the
[1:27:54] house of god in this day whether it's a
[1:27:56] full seven course meal and you're not
[1:27:58] getting fat off of it spiritually if
[1:28:00] you're not beginning to rejoice
[1:28:01] spiritually it's not because the meal is
[1:28:03] not there it's because you're not eating
[1:28:05] it

[1:28:09] and praise the name of the lord your god

[1:28:17] midst of israel that i am the lord your
[1:28:19] god and none else and my people shall
[1:28:21] never be ashamed to keep repeating that
[1:28:22] brother branham comes back from india
[1:28:24] and preaches a message called ashamed
[1:28:26] because he talks about missionaries
[1:28:27] going overseas he said and they should
[1:28:29] be they come back ashamed because they
[1:28:32] can't produce the works of god
[1:28:34] oh but we don't have to be ashamed
[1:28:37] because the years have been restored to
[1:28:39] us
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:42] verse 28 it shall come to pass afterward
[1:28:45] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:28:48] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:28:49] prophesy your old men will dream dreams
[1:28:52] your young men will see visions also
[1:28:54] upon the servants and upon the handmaids
[1:28:56] in those days well i pour out my spirit
[1:28:58] i will show wonders in the heavens and
[1:29:00] in the earth blood and fire and pillars
[1:29:02] of smoke
[1:29:04] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[1:29:06] the moon into blood before the great and
[1:29:08] terrible day of the lord come and it
[1:29:09] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:29:11] call in the name of the lord shall be
[1:29:12] delivered
[1:29:13] oh do you believe we're living in that
[1:29:14] day
[1:29:15] for in mount zion and jerusalem shall be
[1:29:17] deliverance that's the lord has said and
[1:29:19] then the remnant whom the lord shall
[1:29:20] call
[1:29:21] peter gives us the revelation of that
[1:29:23] verse and i won't read it all but he
[1:29:24] comes back in acts 2 16 and says this is
[1:29:26] that
[1:29:28] this is the inheritance
[1:29:31] that a good man leaves to his children's
[1:29:33] children yes
[1:29:35] hallelujah this is that which was spoken
[1:29:37] by the prophet joel he said now you tell
[1:29:40] me is god still calling you tell me is
[1:29:42] god's still calling
[1:29:43] if god is still calling then the
[1:29:45] apostolic age is still in existence
[1:29:48] certainly as many as the lord our god
[1:29:50] shall call ever call ever will call as
[1:29:52] many as he shall call it will still be
[1:29:54] the apostolic age for jesus christ is
[1:29:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:59] amen he teaches us in seed of
[1:30:00] discrepancy anything else is the seed of
[1:30:02] discrepancy
[1:30:04] so we believe that today do you believe
[1:30:06] it
[1:30:07] oh my he said yes sir it's time to
[1:30:09] return
[1:30:10] return to what
[1:30:12] return back to the organization i come
[1:30:14] out of
[1:30:15] no return back to your inheritance
[1:30:19] oh my if you're not receiving your
[1:30:20] inheritance if you're not eating and
[1:30:22] plenty and being satisfied it's not
[1:30:23] because the inheritance isn't here
[1:30:26] it is here the holy ghost is here the
[1:30:28] open book is here
[1:30:30] then it's not because the inheritance is
[1:30:32] not here but it's time to return
[1:30:35] return back to your inheritance
[1:30:37] i know it's a little bit evangelistic
[1:30:38] this morning but i want you to i want
[1:30:40] you to see it i want us to understand it
[1:30:42] to know if there's something there
[1:30:44] that's not what it was back then we have
[1:30:46] a standard we have a good father
[1:30:50] we can ask for it
[1:30:53] amen we can be as bold as my daughters
[1:30:55] were this morning
[1:30:57] hey man as bold as they've ever been my
[1:30:59] daughters when they want something they
[1:31:00] they don't ask once they don't ask
[1:31:02] christ they keep asking they keep asking
[1:31:04] over and over again until i finally tell
[1:31:05] them it's enough
[1:31:07] but sometimes i'll act you know this i
[1:31:08] hate to admit this even i shouldn't
[1:31:10] admit this in front of them but
[1:31:11] sometimes you act just because they keep
[1:31:13] after you
[1:31:14] because they know you
[1:31:16] oh my sometimes we act just because they
[1:31:18] keep after us and said and jesus told us
[1:31:20] that if if the children of the world get
[1:31:22] what they want just by their what he
[1:31:24] calls importunity just by coming and
[1:31:26] asking and asking and asking how much
[1:31:28] more will your father give you amen
[1:31:31] i'm getting ahead of myself but now
[1:31:33] that's that's the promise that we have
[1:31:35] yes
[1:31:36] he said what kind of inheritance did he
[1:31:37] leave
[1:31:39] he said wait you in the city of
[1:31:40] jerusalem until you're endured with
[1:31:41] power from on high that's the
[1:31:42] inheritance now go join this one and go
[1:31:45] join that one go join this one wait till
[1:31:47] the power comes from on high
[1:31:49] how long until one day two days wait
[1:31:51] until
[1:31:52] don't take some little emotion some
[1:31:53] little frustration wait there
[1:31:55] until you're dead and buried and born
[1:31:57] again anew in christ jesus and every
[1:31:59] pulsation of your life beats out jesus
[1:32:01] christ
[1:32:02] till you can see the life of christ
[1:32:04] reflected right in your living oh isn't
[1:32:05] that what you want this morning the way
[1:32:08] you go yes or two you can find that
[1:32:09] power like they had back there in the
[1:32:11] beginning
[1:32:12] back to a pentecostal inheritance
[1:32:15] yes sir
[1:32:16] oh if i had more voice to cry with this
[1:32:19] morning i'd cry back to a pentecostal in
[1:32:21] it that don't mean back to the
[1:32:22] denominational pentecost
[1:32:24] that's not what he's saying
[1:32:26] they lost their inheritance
[1:32:28] gave it away
[1:32:30] and said speaking in tongues was the
[1:32:32] evidence of the holy ghost and gave away
[1:32:33] the word
[1:32:36] amen but this possession he said
[1:32:38] denomination is not your possession
[1:32:42] oh god denomination will tell you what
[1:32:45] to do and what to preach and what to say
[1:32:47] and where to build your church and what
[1:32:48] time to have church that's the
[1:32:50] nomination that'll tell you that that's
[1:32:51] not your possession
[1:32:53] amen that's not your possession
[1:32:55] denomination is not your possession
[1:32:57] pentecost is your possession how many
[1:32:59] believe that today
[1:33:00] pentecost is your possession not a
[1:33:02] pentecostal organization your father's
[1:33:04] come out of such a thing the pentecostal
[1:33:07] experience is your possession
[1:33:10] that's what a good father does
[1:33:12] he gives good thanks
[1:33:14] let's read luke 11 and 5.
[1:33:19] he said unto them which of you shall
[1:33:20] have a friend so going to him at
[1:33:23] midnight
[1:33:24] saying to him friend
[1:33:27] lend me three loaves
[1:33:29] i think i've told you before but if i
[1:33:30] had a friend like that i might not
[1:33:32] listen
[1:33:35] but as your pastor you know i'm
[1:33:37] i'll do that if you need bread at
[1:33:39] through midnight
[1:33:43] i'll be glad to help you
[1:33:46] don't make a habit of it
[1:33:52] he said which we have a friend going to
[1:33:54] him at midnight
[1:33:55] saying to him friend
[1:33:57] he ain't much of a friend to me
[1:33:59] lend me three loaves
[1:34:01] for a friend of mine and it's in his
[1:34:04] journey it's come to me
[1:34:06] and i have nothing to set before him
[1:34:09] and he from within shall answer and say

[1:34:13] children are with me in bed i cannot
[1:34:15] rise and given thee

[1:34:55] yet because of his opportunity
[1:35:00] i hurt my knuckles
[1:35:02] huh
[1:35:02] he keeps coming back and asking yes
[1:35:07] have we forgotten what church is all
[1:35:09] about what prayer is all about
[1:35:12] i wonder sometimes we've forgotten how
[1:35:13] to pray completely
[1:35:15] i don't mean to say that to judge you i
[1:35:17] i don't know many of you some of you
[1:35:18] pray probably more than i do
[1:35:21] but even myself sometimes i wonder if
[1:35:22] we've forgotten what prayer is
[1:35:25] come back to god
[1:35:27] say well i prayed before i come up from
[1:35:29] prayer before
[1:35:32] have you heard you knock lately

[1:36:28] knocking

[1:36:32] but because of his opportunity he'll
[1:36:34] rise and give him as many as he needs

[1:40:15] harvest jesus said the harvest is ripe
[1:40:17] the laborers are few pray the lord of
[1:40:18] the harvest to send laborers into his
[1:40:20] harvest

[1:40:43] he is depending
[1:40:45] on you
[1:40:47] asking
[1:40:50] the almighty all-sufficient
[1:40:53] elohim
[1:40:56] is depending
[1:40:58] on you
[1:41:00] asking him
[1:41:03] lord send missionaries yes

[1:41:11] oh god
[1:41:12] lord sin men will stand by the word

[1:41:20] he's depending on you asking him to sin
[1:41:22] the lord of the harvest is standing
[1:41:24] there looking out at the whiteness at
[1:41:26] the ripeness of the harvest and he says
[1:41:28] ask yes
[1:41:30] pray that the lord of the harvest
[1:41:32] will send laborers
[1:41:34] into his harvest
[1:41:37] i'm closing in just a moment caleb was a
[1:41:40] good father
[1:41:42] and joshua 15 and 16.
[1:41:46] caleb said he that smiteth courageous
[1:41:48] seifer and taketh it to him while i give
[1:41:50] oxf my daughter to wife
[1:41:54] and othniel the son of king has the
[1:41:56] brother of caleb took it
[1:41:58] he you know it was a walled city
[1:42:02] caleb takes all the other city said well
[1:42:03] there's one left but at least something
[1:42:05] for my future son-in-law to do
[1:42:09] so he tells him he said go mow the lawn
[1:42:14] and we'll see how you do mowing the lawn
[1:42:18] but actually if you look into that and
[1:42:19] i've preached to you about it before but
[1:42:21] i wanted to bring it in here because i
[1:42:22] believe it fits
[1:42:24] and
[1:42:25] that actually that name of that city
[1:42:27] means book
[1:42:29] and so it's a type of christ he said
[1:42:31] he took the book
[1:42:33] off neil amen who was a blood relative
[1:42:36] to caleb
[1:42:37] took the book
[1:42:39] and he gave him his daughter as his
[1:42:41] bride
[1:42:43] oh my
[1:42:45] verse 18 it came to pass as she came
[1:42:47] unto him that she moved him to ask of
[1:42:49] her father a field
[1:42:51] and she lighted off of her ass and caleb
[1:42:53] said to her what what is thou now you
[1:42:56] can imagine how this went down that she
[1:42:58] is they're riding along and they're just
[1:43:00] newly married and you know how it is
[1:43:02] your wife she's poking him and say right
[1:43:04] along hey hey off neil
[1:43:08] that land's mighty dry
[1:43:10] my daddy gave me a good inheritance but
[1:43:13] it needs some more water
[1:43:15] he gave her a south land it means a
[1:43:18] desert land
[1:43:19] and she watched all the other children
[1:43:21] get all these other things
[1:43:23] and she said you know what
[1:43:25] my land's mighty dry but i have a good
[1:43:27] father
[1:43:32] so she pokes him
[1:43:33] there's gabe
[1:43:36] ask my daddy
[1:43:41] asked my daddy
[1:43:43] said to give me
[1:43:44] something some water
[1:43:46] he sat there and said i can't look like
[1:43:48] that in front of your dad
[1:43:50] woman be quiet
[1:43:54] he might not have given it
[1:43:55] to the son-in-law
[1:43:58] oh god
[1:44:00] but she got down when they got there she
[1:44:01] was so fed up
[1:44:04] she got that she slid off of the donkey
[1:44:06] and she said okay so what do you want i
[1:44:08] can tell you want something or you
[1:44:09] wouldn't be here
[1:44:10] you know when your adult children come
[1:44:12] along come around
[1:44:16] after they're married they come around
[1:44:17] they're just hanging around the house
[1:44:18] you know what do you want
[1:44:24] she said give me a blessing
[1:44:27] you've given me a southland land with no
[1:44:30] water in it
[1:44:31] give me also springs of water
[1:44:36] she said give me something to sustain
[1:44:39] the land the productiveness of my land
[1:44:44] oh god
[1:44:46] we have that inheritance today
[1:44:48] we have a good father
[1:44:51] so that we don't have to be dead and dry
[1:44:55] are you hearing me today we don't have
[1:44:57] to be dead and dry
[1:44:59] we can get down in front of our father
[1:45:04] we can get down in front of our father
[1:45:06] and say lord
[1:45:08] you've given me a portion of life that
[1:45:11] has trouble in it
[1:45:13] you've given me a in-laws that give me
[1:45:16] trouble
[1:45:17] you've given me outlaws to give me
[1:45:18] trouble
[1:45:19] you my family we don't have the money
[1:45:22] everybody else does we don't we don't
[1:45:24] have the things everybody else does
[1:45:26] there are certain things and all of you
[1:45:27] have something in your life that you can
[1:45:28] look at like that we we don't have i
[1:45:30] have to work maybe more than some other
[1:45:32] men do and some of you could say that or
[1:45:34] i have to do things that they're
[1:45:36] different and i have to provide for my
[1:45:37] family lord
[1:45:39] i may not be able to do what so and so
[1:45:41] does
[1:45:42] because of my south land that the place
[1:45:45] the place where you put me the kind of
[1:45:47] work you gave me to do
[1:45:48] and the things that you give me it's
[1:45:50] hard for me it's difficult for me
[1:45:52] because of the inheritance i have but
[1:45:54] lord i don't believe you'd have given
[1:45:55] that to me
[1:45:57] without giving me a way to sustain life
[1:46:00] lord
[1:46:01] give me a southland
[1:46:03] and give me water
[1:46:05] give me also springs of water and he
[1:46:07] gave her upper springs for mountaintop
[1:46:09] experiences nether springs for
[1:46:11] experiences in the valley when she's in
[1:46:13] the valley
[1:46:14] yes he gave her a way to sustain
[1:46:18] life on her land on her inheritance
[1:46:21] it was jabez you pray lord enlarge my
[1:46:23] territory
[1:46:24] caleb said give me my mountain
[1:46:28] huxley said give me springs
[1:46:30] of water
[1:46:33] as i've told you my daughters love to
[1:46:34] ask me for big things
[1:46:36] things i can't even do right now
[1:46:39] but they just want to plant a seed
[1:46:45] oh god
[1:46:47] sometimes as men
[1:46:50] just talk to us a minute it says father
[1:46:51] some close musicians go ahead and come
[1:46:53] wait i will close
[1:46:56] as father sometimes we
[1:46:59] we we
[1:47:02] are determined to do it ourselves
[1:47:06] we're determined and we know we're dry
[1:47:08] we know we need help from god
[1:47:11] we're determined to be we're determined
[1:47:12] to be self-made
[1:47:14] i got my job i
[1:47:16] i got the things i have to do
[1:47:18] i'm a man of the wilderness
[1:47:20] hunting fish and
[1:47:22] go out and do i'm a man i'm a he-man
[1:47:25] my father
[1:47:26] my dad
[1:47:28] we're kind of like
[1:47:30] ox's husband
[1:47:32] we don't want to ask
[1:47:36] but you're also the bride of jesus
[1:47:37] christ
[1:47:40] and and sometimes we feel like well for
[1:47:42] me it would be humbling for me
[1:47:44] but if anybody
[1:47:46] should ask
[1:47:48] shouldn't it be the father's
[1:47:51] because we have a father
[1:47:54] and when our children aren't being
[1:47:56] provided for in the right way
[1:47:58] or we're worried about what might happen
[1:47:59] at school or we're concerned about the
[1:48:02] direction that they're heading we've
[1:48:04] tried our best and done everything that
[1:48:05] we can do some of you your children have
[1:48:07] grown and they've gone out and you're
[1:48:08] concerned
[1:48:10] but you still have the ability
[1:48:14] to get down on your knees and cry out to
[1:48:16] god and say lord you're my father
[1:48:19] if i could do it for my children i would
[1:48:22] if i could do it for myself i would if i
[1:48:24] could give myself a greater portion of
[1:48:27] the holy ghost if i could if i could
[1:48:28] fill my life with goodness and joy and
[1:48:31] and long suffering and gentleness and
[1:48:33] kindness i would do it but i can't do it
[1:48:36] i can't do it without you as men we have
[1:48:38] to be humble enough that we're able to
[1:48:40] get down in front of him and say lord
[1:48:43] give me springs of water
[1:48:45] enlarge my territory
[1:48:48] not just give me my mountain to fight on
[1:48:50] but give me also springs
[1:48:53] of water
[1:48:55] let me be like my daughters
[1:48:57] who are willing to ask
[1:49:01] our father dwells in heaven
[1:49:03] you see as a father i don't always have
[1:49:04] it to give
[1:49:06] but our father who dwells in heaven
[1:49:08] has everything
[1:49:10] that we need
[1:49:12] i
[1:49:15] i don't mean to point out esther this
[1:49:17] morning but she always looks at houses
[1:49:19] she's done this for years
[1:49:21] we just bought a house
[1:49:23] but she always looks at bigger houses
[1:49:28] better houses
[1:49:30] he's always looking at houses well when
[1:49:32] that girl gets married her husband's in
[1:49:34] trouble
[1:49:36] she looks at bigger houses and better
[1:49:38] houses and i'm i'm a man of small things
[1:49:40] and
[1:49:41] limited abilities
[1:49:43] as far as fixing things and building
[1:49:45] things
[1:49:47] but
[1:49:49] she always asks me i want or she don't
[1:49:51] and sometimes she don't even ask she
[1:49:52] just does it she just looks i wonder why
[1:49:54] you keep looking at houses
[1:49:57] because she trusts enough
[1:49:59] in her dad
[1:50:01] that maybe someday there will be an
[1:50:03] opportunity
[1:50:05] my wife gave up years ago
[1:50:09] but maybe someday there'll be an
[1:50:10] opportunity to have that big house
[1:50:13] we have a nice home i'm not complaining
[1:50:14] but it's just you see the the faith of a
[1:50:16] child
[1:50:18] of a little girl that's the way we ought
[1:50:19] to be
[1:50:22] lord you're a good father
[1:50:24] you're a good father what do you need
[1:50:26] this morning
[1:50:27] ask him for it
[1:50:30] yeah well he didn't answer
[1:50:35] keep knocking
[1:50:37] because your father who dwells in heaven
[1:50:39] has everything we need he said don't
[1:50:41] don't ask for things of tomorrow as for
[1:50:43] today lord give me my daily bread
[1:50:45] because i'm willing to come back
[1:50:47] tomorrow
[1:50:48] at the same place at the same time
[1:50:51] and ask for bread and water again
[1:50:54] what do you need ask your father he'll
[1:50:56] give it to you this morning
[1:50:58] do you believe it if you believe it you
[1:51:00] can have it
[1:51:01] this power heads together
[1:51:03] what do you need you need to see a
[1:51:04] revival
[1:51:06] i didn't mean to be harsh with you but
[1:51:10] are you knocking

[1:51:16] are you praying
[1:51:19] are you digging
[1:51:22] we've got revival services coming up
[1:51:24] we've
[1:51:25] spent a lot of money to bring in
[1:51:26] ministers and
[1:51:27] and bring in people and try to have
[1:51:29] fellowship with other people but that's
[1:51:30] not what it's all about
[1:51:33] we want to see the spirit of god move
[1:51:35] among us
[1:51:36] we want to see that in our regular
[1:51:37] services and we do see it many times
[1:51:40] but we want to see it more and more
[1:51:43] you have a need today
[1:51:46] are you knocking
[1:51:48] are you asking
[1:51:50] you gotta get so desperate he loves to
[1:51:52] hear you cry he loves to hear you call
[1:51:54] out say lord
[1:51:55] you're my father i acknowledge my
[1:51:58] inability but i also acknowledge your
[1:52:00] ability to give me the thing i have need
