together for a word of Prayer a gracious heavenly father and such a privilege to be in your house this morning more than that to be your house so grateful that you are God and father that your sovereignty means that everything is in your hands father you knew where we would be this morning what we would be listening to what the condition of our life would be as we come to this moment help us to grow in your word today and or just to drink in of the of the goodness of God the grace that you've given us the word of the hour may we continually grow father and not not stop or put a period Lord on on what we are and what we become but we know we've got further to go there's a road yet to walk Lord until that day when our body's changing so I pray Heavenly Father that you would just help us to become more like you father lord I pray for every request that was made these folks Lord that are here and those that are listening father by way of streaming I pray God that you would just move in their homes where they are God and we know that you're able to do that and you're not constricted like we are and so we ask you Father to touch them Lord I'd like to be able to go to each one of them and fellowship with them today and you know that's my heart my god I know that you can do that today and Lord and you can provide a fellowship that Lord that can be beyond anything that we can have humanly I prayed that you bless the word today and all that said or done we ask in Jesus amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to John chapter six verse 63 we'll just read that one verse John chapter six verse 63 it's good to be fellowshipping around the word this morning we posted on the internet but we are going to try to do our best reopen the church in a timely manner so y'all just bear with us thank you for for being with us for being a part of those that have come and helped and those that those that have been unable to come but want to be here and I know that you do and you that are watching I know that you want to be here and and so we appreciate that and and nothing would thrill my heart more than to see everybody here this morning but it won't be very long we're planning if everything continues to go as it is and there's not any more problems or planning on trying to reopen on May the 3rd but there will be some restrictions and things we still have to deal with and so you just keep praying with us we believe God is good to us and allows us to do the things that we need to do and and guides us to do the right things at the right time so we're gonna follow the leadership of the Lord and use our brains as well and use common sense and and I'm glad that we've all stayed safe through this and I know there's been time so some of you do work jobs and things where you could have been exposed but you've been able to be safe and I appreciate that and we want to thank God for that also Joanna's birthday today and over the David already mentioned that and the reason I'm bringing it up again is because I noticed on my calendar that brother Joe's birthday was on the calendar at home my kids put it on there so they found out his birthday and put it on our calendar they didn't have yours on their sister join us you've got a little work to do there so they had Jose put on there I thought that was interesting I don't think they had mine on there but they've got Jojo they've got your birthday on the calendar at home alright let's read from John chapter 6 and verse 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life she grateful for his word this morning I want to speak to you on the elements of the Christian life and I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word as you're seated this morning an element is the simplest principle of a thing it's its most basic part we know that the elements in water are hydrogen and oxygen and if you just have one you don't have water right he takes both to make water and both elements are necessary and it's h2o I think it's two parts hydrogen one part oxygen or maybe vice versa if I was making water I might not be able to do that but but you know there's an elements that have to be there and as you look at the Christian life there's some things that have to be in the Christian life and we find that people today there's countless people who have a desire to live right I think there's people that are on the earth today that want to do the right things and they want to live right they want to have a the ability to overcome their problems and the situations of their life that they're dealing with and they just can't seem to do it they just can't seem to live in overcomers life and they try to take the word and maybe millions around the world have the Bible and read it and want to do the things that are written in the Bible but many times they're unable to for whatever reason and of course you know there's Hippocrates there's make believers but I believe there's people who really want to do it but yet they don't know how or there's something that that's keeping them from doing that there's something that's lacking and it's like brother Branham talked about the mechanics and the dynamics it's like there's something missing that they're unable to make it work and that's what I want to talk about this morning is those elements that make the Christian life actually work and so you today that living a Christian life when we think about that many times we think about just living a good life and we think about living a sanctified life when we think about living a Christian life not smoking not drinking not doing those things and that's part of it there's part of being a Christian but there's more to being a Christian than just that because if that's all it takes to be a Christian then the Pope qualifies and then others there's others that would qualify that as well and so but they don't have what it takes to live like Christ to me and and I think I can prove this by the word that living a Christian life is to manifest the word of the hour and we could put it this way to make the word work that's supposed to work in the hour that you live in it's not only sanctification it's not only manifestation but it's sanctification and manifestation together that brings out a life that lives through you it's not something that you put on but it's something that you just are and so you just actually do the things that you're supposed to do in the hour that you live in and you believe the word that you are supposed to believe because that's how you do what you do because of what you believe so we find that that should be evident in our lives in acts 4:13 they looked at the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men and it says they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and you know I think it ought to be evident in our lives as well that that we've been with Christ that there's been a resurrection take place in our lives that were different than what we were so they said these men have been with Jesus and it wasn't because they'll just live better lives because the Pharisees live better lives but these men had been with Jesus because they had the boldness to speak the word of their hour they were living and manifesting the very word that was spoken about them and I believe today that there's a people on the face of the earth that are actually manifesting the word that is spoken about us that there's somebody but the Harvey that's willing to put action and manifest the word that was given for this day so it's a manifestation now but the random tells us in in a message called is your life worthy of the gospel he says no the only way to live a life worthy is to let Christ and His Word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and then return back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word like the way he puts this in these future days so he's fulfilling his word in these future days whatever word is written about us and just to kind of make it where we could understand it this morning you know there was a time when it took a certain amount of power to move an automobile because the mechanics of that automobile were simple and so it took a certain amount of power to be able to move that and it was an amount that and you say well what amount is right well whatever amount it takes to move the wheels and to make it operate the way it's supposed to so if you went and got a 1956 Chevy and you could have maybe low horsepower compared to what you would have today and but yet it would be it would have the power that it needed and maybe even use a different type of gasoline er I believe leaded gasoline or whatever but it would be different than what we have today and it's because the mechanics have improved on the automobile now we know that God doesn't change but he does add things that we didn't know yesterday to what we know today right so the word if you could look at it this way that they had and brother Branham types it to the horse and buggy and then he typed it to the automobile is still transportation but it's just a different method of transportation but you still he's just revealing more of himself so if you can take automobiles you could take a 56 Chevy and move that up to today they're quite a bit different and it takes a maybe a different mixture maybe use fuel injectors instead of a carburetor you're doing something a little bit different to make it work but the right the elements are still there are the basic elements of a of an engine or still have to be there in order to make it work right and so the word of this day is not a horse and buggy but it's actually a it's actually a spaceship put it that way a rocket and ship and so it takes a certain mixture of fuel to be able to get that rocket ship off the ground and you say well how do we know what that is well he provides that to us and we'll get into that that the word of the hour actually has the life in it that we need and God no he will not leave his word as a dead body I hope you understand this today that maybe yesterday's word there people who can take the word for Noah's day and understand that and believe it but we live in a different day and that word you could look at that but the ground looked at it as a a buzzard eating a carcass of yesterday but today we have a word for today and the holy spirit anoints that word and actually in dwells that word and comes on a living body a living church to make it do what it's supposed to do and then the church operates under that and it operates the way a church is supposed to operate at the end time are you with me so far now and so that's why many can't put it together but we've heard a message that we can live a Christian life we don't live the life of a cult somewhere we live a Christian life but it looks different from what the world lives because they can't put those elements together to make this machine of the word work in our day and you look at it look at the the message of Luther today or the message of Wesley or them to Pentecost it fails the people that believe in it and it fails the ones who hold to it the most it fails them the most because they've not moved on into another light and and so what happens is though they may be sincere it seems like it's a struggle for them and many of them may be sincerely will be a foolish virgin or they're in some way they're in the economy of God they're sincere in it but they don't under they just can't make it work but for us it's not making it work it just works right or it ought to be that way it just works oh my I'm so glad for a gospel that works this morning I'm so glad that it works wherever we're at if you're sitting out there today in your home and you're sitting there thinking well I'm not a preacher I'm not a singer I'm not anything else but it works where do you live the gospel works this machine of the gospel of the endtime gospel works in your life you can look back at what you were and you can look back at yesterday and you can say I'm not what I was because the word is working in my life that explosion has taken place that the meaning of the mechanics and the dynamics and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit has come and now I'm able to live it man it may be simple it may not be what everybody's looking for but I'm able to live the word for my day now so brother Branham says that we're return back in the form of the Holy Spirit and fulfill this promise word of these future days now in John 4:23 he says but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth but the father seeketh such to worship Him God is the spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth these are the elements that it takes to make a Christian life brother Branham again calls this the mechanics and the dynamics or the word and the quickening power so it's the same thing it's just calling it something different now either element and I want us to understand this today because as a church as a people and I think that we we need to understand where we are and what we have because a lot of times people are looking for something different there were something more and I don't believe there is anything more and if you want to hear something more you're probably listening to the wrong preacher because I believe where it's going home time and I believe that it's getting just getting closer and closer and I believe there's more revelation as far as personal revelation when it comes to the Word of God we have what we need to go home so want us to understand that what we need or what we have is sufficient to make it work but it takes both these elements to make it work because you could take the message by itself or the Bible by itself and read it and become a student of it and understand it in the mind and it still wouldn't work but if you if that same scripture if those same quotes were quickened to you we're made alive to you then it would work because this is my scripture says the letter kill us but the Spirit bring his life and we can read it like this the letter alone killeth it takes both elements together it's also true that the Spirit by itself will not cannot produce a life worthy of the gospel and that that sounds strange but the Holy Spirit will anoint people but it cannot end well anything but the word right it can't come into your life and that's why so many people are looking looking for the Holy Ghost but if you're looking for the Holy Ghost give your heart to Christ repent and be baptized and follow Christ and and actually do or obey the Word of God and you'll receive the Holy Ghost because he comes to that temple that sanctified he comes to that person that is we could say has been awakened to the word and it's the Holy Ghost that does that but then it's the Holy Ghost that indwells the person and he will not end well anyone that is not the word I'm going to show that to you in just a moment there's got to be some part of you and I'm so grateful that when we fail or when we don't do what's right that we have to realize that we would not have the Holy Ghost today if there was not some part of us that was the word because he won't come to anything but the word now but it's not this flesh our flesh it's not the word we are not Emmanuel he was and I'm kind of getting ahead of myself today but just just bear with me because I'm I'm thinking about this while I'm while I'm preaching to you and I've been praying about it now for days and and just trying to think how to bring it to us that we would understand because we need something that works and we need something that's real we need something that's alive but yet we could go and if you just put that on manifestation of the Spirit that jumping and shouting and there's lots of churches that shout more than we do lots of churches that jump more than we do around the house and that's wonderful you know I'd run the Isles too I love it but you know when it comes down to it that's the effects of his presence that's his anointing but what you have to have to make it out of here is the indwelling of the Spirit because you will come and anoint an entire church and you've seen it work you have three kinds of believers you know sinners and saints sitting together and the Saints rejoice and the sinners rejoice and everyone together begins to rejoice in the presence of God but what we want is to get out of here and in order to get out of here we actually have to have him not just anointing us but indwelling us so there's got to be something that will work in our lives not just the effects of his presence not just as we've referenced recently but Elijah hearing the whirlwind or seeing the fire whatever that it was he saw those things and those were effects of his presence but he waited until he heard the still small voice for the cabin when he heard it then he knew God was speaking because the Holy Spirit only comes to the word now so you might ask the question which is more important the Holy Spirit or the word the mechanics or the dynamics the word of the quickening power which is more important I'll ask you this if you go out to your car and you want to drive somewhere you got somewhere to be what's more important the battery or the gasoline you need both right you need a spark now maybe you can start your car like my grandpa you start his tractor and roll it down the hill and pop the clutch always parked his tractor on a hill and just pop the clutch and maybe you can start your car like that but but you need a spark and you need gasoline to be able to run it so you'd say well we'll happen we have more of the spirit or we have more of the word well it's actually the same thing because what we need is Holy Ghost filled people then you have the spirit and the word right now the key is not to have we say well we have more of the spirit or we have more of the word but the key is to have the spirit and the spirit and enough power in our lives to make the mechanics of our age the word of our age run it's got to be able to operate it's got to be able to move and the word they put it down on a basic way the word and the spirit in us shouldn't it could make a shout it could make us speak in tongues but it will make it work in our lives so it'll make a church work the word and the spirit together in your life will be able to operate if you have the office of a deacon or trustee or or if you're a musician or if you're just a housewife or or if you're a factory worker the word will operate in you so that the church can benefit from you being there right that's the word and the spirit actually working together and you don't realize that and you say well I don't run the aisles but maybe you you faithfully support the church and you faithfully come and you're faithful to be there in the same man or however that you can do it and you don't realize that you're making the church work all right you're making the church work and so just as much as the preacher is just as much as the musicians are just as much as the song leader of the Deacons you make the church work and if you have the Holy Spirit then you have what it takes in you to make you're part of the body work with the other members of the body and it won't produce a church a denominational Church a church of another day but it'll produce a church of the word and this day right now so the key is that we have to have the same spirit and the same word even though we have more revelation of it today boy it's the same word and the same spirit that he had because we want a resurrection like he had now Romans 8:11 and we've read this I think every week recently but he said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you in other words it'll make you alive it'll work and I know I'm bearing down on that but I just wanted us to get that and so I kept reminding myself of that in my notes it'll work it must not only be the anointing of the spirit but the Spirit has got to dwell in it it won't just have works it won't just have works it won't just have numbers but it'll manifest the word for the day however that is and it'll manifest it under distress under persecution you look at that first age how that the the enemy come against them and and look during the Dark Age if how the enemy came and just destroyed them but the word still worked the anointing that they were under anointed the word for their day and it worked and it'll work today it'll work for a family that's struggling to get by the word and the Spirit will work in your life it'll work for it'll work for a church that maybe it is small and not as big as some others but the word will still work it's still effective they'll still lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's you'll still see healing you'll still see the Word of God manifested why because the word still works just like it did back then so the anointing of our day works to produce the Word of God in our lives now I want you to understand this morning that the Spirit will only dwell in a word house and I'm trying to refrain from saying are you with me because a little hard for those on the internet to tell me that but you know I trust that you are with me this morning wherever you're at button but it's got to dwell in a word house I mean let me reiterate that the word or the spirit will only dwell in a word house you know there's some motels that you won't stay in something that I won't stay in and we may have a different standard but there's some there's some that I you know just try not to stay in if I'm not in the foreign country and I have choices I'll go down the street right and so there's some places some houses maybe you wouldn't live in some cars you wouldn't drive you have standards and the Holy Ghost has standards and his standard is that he will not live in an unclean house and not only is it people do not live in an unclean house because you know there are those who clean up and then the devil comes right back in because they're not filled and Jesus told us that in the parables but yet there are there has to be someone who not only has cleaned up but is the work so there has to be well he will only dwell in a house that the word built and you can go back and if you want to get real technical with it you can go back to - to Moses when he saw a pattern of the tabernacle in the heavens he couldn't just build it anyway he wanted to but it had to be built a certain way a pattern had to be shown that they would build everything just the way they should and then if you go to David's time there had to be a pattern and then God revealed to David you'll find the pattern the house of God and then Solomon built that house but it was by revelation it had to be patterned brother Brown tells us it was patterned after the one in heaven that there had to be a pattern he would not come into something that was not patterned according to the word and and our lives have to be patterned according to the word but let me tell you what he comes into because you might say then well what what about the ones on the day of Pentecost who received the Holy Ghost knowing nothing and all they knew was to be baptized and they received the Holy Ghost and many find many examples of people who received the Holy Ghost without coming through a bunch of steps and jumping through a bunch of Hoops how is that even possible well it's possible because it's not what's in an order it's not your flesh but what's in order is the seed and that seed has been awakened by the Holy Spirit so he says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ in order for you to believe what he said and follow those directions there has to be something wakening inside of you and then if you follow those directions and believe what he said there must be some word there that was had an ability to be awakened so he comes to that so he doesn't wait I hope we understand this today he doesn't wait till we're perfect to give us the Holy Ghost he doesn't wait even till were mature to give us the Holy Ghost but he gives us the Holy Ghost and then matures us by the Holy Ghost he gives us the Holy Ghost and then he grows through us by the Holy Ghost I hope you're with me now now so there's got to be somebody who the spirit would dwell in the act 7:48 system Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands so he comes to dwell in a body you know you go back to the dove that Noah released from the ark and the Dove would not land on a dead body and the devil is the type for the Holy Spirit it flew out there and there was carcasses laying in the water and he sent out a crow and the old crow just sat down on the carcass and started to eat he was happy to be there but the dev wasn't happy like that that's the way a Christian his if he flies around he finds out the Holy Spirit in you will not settle on dead carcasses will not feed on those things so brother branham puts it this way he said in Hebrews chapter seven number one he says some of you people going to church and just living by your membership people still do that today that doesn't mean and this is that that quote and X quote some of you people going to church and just living by your membership he said you go out here and do everything in the world and then still go back and say yeah I belong to the church he said well that's a long ways from belonging to God and as I said people still do that today and it's just a message Church instead of a Baptist Church but that's belonging to this church or any other attending church that's not what makes you a Christian no more than it's been said many times being in a living in a garage makes you a car right but it's something that you are and so you go to church because of who you are but the branches but you see people doing that you can tell other good church members that's true you can still be a church member and do those things but you can't be a Christian and do them he said he said I said this morning the Old Crow ever was a hypocrite it's the crow him and the doubt said on the same Ark said in the same roost and the Old Crow was satisfied when he was turned loose and got out of that church oh my that he could go out there and set on one old dead carcass and call call and eat off this one eat off the horse eat off the count whatever it was he was satisfied with rotten flesh oh what the Dove couldn't do that but when Noah turned the dove loose she could find no rest for the soles of her feet she had listen to this she had just as much right to sit on a dead animal as the crow did just as much right but it was two different natures hey Ben one of them she was a dub to begin with he was a crow to begin with now so we know then that the Holy Spirit will not settle down will not dwell with corruption we find that even illustrated in the story of the resurrection because Jesus when he went into the grave he went in with this promise that he said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption he was the word and there had to be a resurrection because the Holy Spirit that spirit that was in him which the Holy Spirit is the person of Christ the Spirit of Christ it would not dwell in a corrupted body and so brother Branham toasts the story and I'm kind of trying to go through this as I can and then we'll finish and I won't take as long as it sounds like I'm gonna take so just bear with me but but the random tells his Eagles score and he talks about how that the the farmer you know set a Eagle egg under a chicken and it hatched because the atmosphere was there for it to hatch and so it it went around the barnyard and scratched just like all the other little chickens did and and they tried to be a good chicken but it just couldn't make it as a chicken you know I tried to be a factory worker one time and that didn't work out very well they just couldn't ever find a place to put me where it worked real well I just you know my mind wanders I'm just not a good factory worker but I've done it and I would do it to support my family but it's just how it was hard on me and it just never seemed to fit and you just can't make an ego fit a chicken's lifestyle it just it's just always uncomfortable scratching in the dirt always uncomfortable eating the bugs he was made for something different and so he was an eagle but he thought he was a chicken and brother man makes a statement but just telling him his an eagle he's an eagle it's not enough but the realm says no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle and I think this many times where we make mistakes with our children is and where I do is I try to tell them you're not a chicken you're an eagle you're an eagle you're an eagle but the the word has to tell them that the has to be a dynamics that comes down into their lives because me telling me you're an eagle that should be obvious the way we live you're an eagle you're not a chicken but it has to become obvious to them and sometimes and so many times we worry when our children get to a certain age and they begin to explore and go out and do things they shouldn't do but sometimes I think it for some people especially they have to come to that place because they have to realize that it doesn't suit them they have to come to the place like the like the lost son did that he said hey I don't I don't belong here in the Pigpen I don't belong here I'm a prodigal I I don't fit in with everybody else I don't like pig scraps and sometimes it takes time for him to realize that but we have a promise we believe that we'll have them now he's brother Brown said no matter how many tried to tell him I Eagle he didn't know what he go was yet he wasn't eagle he would not understand it until he saw something that reflected him or that he said he reflected I like that saw something that he reflected because we're reflections of Christ he was a reflection in his DNA of his mother oh my and so he saw her when he saw her than he knew and brother Brennan said when we've seen how the denomination not a PhD not a lld not a good neighbor but a son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power or mine don't you realize it's more than just hearing you're an eagle he said with the dynamic power of God to answer the request of this day so like I said if that engine is demanding a certain amount of power then we have the quickening life of the word that comes in to our age to give it just that much power that's how much it demands that so much we'll have listen it's a hard age to live especially right now I've watched people over the years and as wise as a pastor I work I worked there as just in ministry over the years I've worked to bring to get people in church and there's a reason for that because when people fall away from the church they fall away from God I mean in cases and I don't mean that they're lost but when people quit coming to church they quit living like they did and you see that and you've seen that over the years it happens not 99 times out of a hundred but a hundred times out of a hundred and brother Branham talks about in what house could you build me and he talks about how that he himself and his children he said we saw we said we got away from the things that we should have been doing and did things we shouldn't have been doing not because they weren't Christians but because they got away from the house of God and so it matters to be gathered together it matters to have an and during this time that it's hard for us to be together and yet the devil could take advantage of that but yet I believe that the spirit and the word today the power the resurrection power of Christ that we have today is able to keep us even during this time even when it seems like there's there's no fellowship even when it is hard and even when it seems like it would be easy to backslide the word is able to keep us because he gave us the dynamics we would need for this age and he knew there would be an epidemic he knew there would be a before we knew anything about it he knew what the body count would be he knew how contagious it would be he knew everything about it he knows more about it today than the doctors do and if they even get anything from it i brother david said if they're able to get it we can pray for that and we should pray for that they'll be able to find a vaccine or some kind of a cure for it but if they're able to do that it'll be because of inspiration from God because he already knows the molecular structure and everything about it do we believe that today but then if he knew that he knew the church wouldn't be able to gather together like we want to wouldn't be able to hug one another like we want to wouldn't be able to shake hands brother Joe like we want to but he prepared us for this hour and he give us enough dynamics in this hour to be able to meet the challenge of our day so brother Barrett says the Son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the requests of this day amen that's what we have he said that he's the same yes today today and forever he said there ain't no hen gonna hold you hey Ben Amen now he says here he said he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of God's Word why he's an eagle I know this is what I want to get to he said an eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation and the word to the word now you are the word in the sense that you are the thoughts of God and when I say you I'm speaking to the part of you that's eternal not to the flesh right because the flesh may die and then be decayed and be down here in the morgue but but yet there's something on the inside that's not there anymore it goes somewhere so there's a part of you that's the word you were in the thoughts of God he said the word before the foundation the words are the word the word predestinated - the word written for the hour oh I love that he said this Ben this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of God to obedience to the Word of God so when he wanted to know how he could get there with her and that's what I wanted to know for the joke when I saw an eagle when that when when my life began to be quickened to the message of the hour I was raised in a message but there had to come a time that the life that was in me became quickened and when it began to be quickened I saw her and I said I want to be like her the word I wanted to be like that eagle I wanted to be like that message not just to conform to the words of a book but to be have that living in me and so there's things that she did he wanted to be like that he wanted to learn how to fly he wanted to learn how to how to defeat his earthbound condition well mine every one of us are in that same stage as we go through life when we're awakened to the call of God we want to learn how to fly we want to learn how to be spiritual creatures and not be just bound to the world and it swims you wanted to know how he could get there with her he'd been taught that he couldn't do that he'd been taught he couldn't do that listen that's the thing that we have to be careful of because when you promote denominations over the word then the denominations teach we you can't ever get there so you just come and take the sacrament and then you know I'm just gonna preach here for a minute you come and take the sacrament and then you'll be okay the Catholics say if you come and stick out your tongue and take the wafer you'll be okay come and do the mass about to say if you come shake the preachers hand you'll be okay many cases around the message we say well if you listen to a tape or if you listen to a certain preacher you'll be okay but listen that's not going to save you that's not going to get you there and if we're not careful we teach the people that they can't do that we teach the people that's for the preacher that's for the Prophet that's for someone else but no it's for you it's for me that we can fly like that we'll have to to get out of here one of these days we've got to be able to fly we will never have the gifts with a random hat will never have the office from other random hat but we have to be able to fly we've got to be able to fight we've got to be able as I said to operate in this age you've got to be an eagle you can't just be in Hawks no Dalek says I could never do that a lion could even say I could never do that but if you ever get the quickening power of an eagle you can fly and it takes that quickening power the eagle to be able to fly an hour an hour he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't get no higher than you can jump he's a chicken see any bad oh don't you see I want more than just jumping want more than just shouting I want to go beyond the heavenlies and yes I'll jump yes I'll shot but I'm going beyond that I'm going back to the beginning again he said he's a chicken but this Eagle said that's not so well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are you're an eagle very bad oh if we could just realize that today we don't have denominational expectations no matter what the chickens are you're an eagle just start spreading those wings get a little exercise in then start moving up and he says this he says the word - the word and this is a continuation of that quote he said the words of the word the works that I do show you also hey man he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also see because I live he lives also and it's the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you it quickens your mortal body and people misunderstand because they think well that means I'll be walking along the street casting out Devils and healing the sick that means you could do that but you're the body of Christ you're a part of the body of Christ and brother branham explained it this way that someone in the body speaks in tongues someone in the body has a gift of healing someone in the body has a gift of being able to minister and things like that but there you're a part of the body it may be the soul on the bottom of the feet but you're still part of the body although I have that place reserved for myself but if you want to be that that part of that - you'd be part of the foot - but you're still part of the body right so we find that we have to have something that'll help us to be able to make the word work though it may not be a show and it won't be because as we read last week that brother Branham was talking about how they were expecting some great worldwide revival he said that's to the Jews it won't come in that way to us it's already came to us and we have the word that we need but what do we need today to continue to grow in the word and to continue to receive the Spirit of God to be refreshed by the Spirit of God to actually fulfill the promise of our day now I want us to go to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 he says this he says and you hath he quickened just ponder that for a moment you have to quickened you could put it like this me happy quickened me have two guys bad English but me happy quickened he quickened you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins notice how Paul includes us all in that you were dead but he has made you alive so he puts it in the past tense not in the present in the future he says you are quickened or you are already quickened so if you're born again you've been made alive so he says wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our lifestyle in times past our conversations manner of life in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but I love this but God who is rich in mercy aren't you glad he was rich in mercy aren't you glad he is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ has made us alive together with Christ by grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus so you could say well how am i quickened and like I said it doesn't come from working your way through a set of steps and I know it's been taught before around the message that you've got to work your way all the way through the pyramid before you can receive the Holy Ghost don't find that in the scripture because as I said they receive the Holy Ghost even while the word was preached the Holy Ghost fell so it's not working your way through a pyramid and saying well I have faith and virtue and all these things now I can receive the Holy Ghost but it takes the Holy Ghost to even have those things in your life and then you have those things must increase in your life add to your faith virtue and all of those things but there's got to come a Holy Spirit indwelling that makes you actually be able to live those things and if that indwelling can't happen until after you're got your life all perfect then very few of us would ever have hope of ever growing in Christ but it's got to be by grace see we are justified by faith and it's the Holy Spirit that does the justification brother Branham puts it this way he said the spirit of the life I'm sorry I'll back up he said then how do we get into this body first Christmas well by one Spirit we were all baptized into this body he said by one Holy Spirit baptism he said his first Corinthians 12:13 he said by one Spirit we were all baptized and the Spirit is the life of Christ he said the life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life that's pretty simple the life of any seed brings the seed to life oh my said you get it if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit come upon it it is bound to bring the seed that seed life he says so he's saying that the life is already in the seed but when the Holy Spirit falls on it it brings it to life now how does the quickening power how does that take place looks by faith by faith Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith now we don't just have faith and receive the Holy Ghost no but he indwells us after we've had faith does that make sense you have faith justified by faith we have peace with God now say where does the faith come from well you can't have faith yourself for anything the faith has to come from somewhere but one day you believed in spite of yourself you believed where is the capacity for faith there's some people who just can't believe but for for us there's something inside of you that just has the capacity to believe oh by what makes you believe faith and what makes you have that faith oh my it's already in there the word comes to the work now Romans 5:2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace when we stand where does the faith come from we find it's the faith of him and efficients 3:12 and whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him now watch the faith is in the seat but the faith is made alive by hearing the word where does the faith come from it comes by hearing Romans 10:17 then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God we could say it like this your faith is awakened and increased by hearing the faith of God in you I'm keep backing up and rephrasing myself but the faith of God in you actually causes you to begin to manifest the works of God the faith of God in you is awakened by hearing the Word of God but the Branham says it this way God lives in his word so we don't serve a dead God the message of the hour is not dead letter and when people say well the word is just dead it's not dead it's not dead it's life because the life comes and dwells in the word oh my so he says he says God lives in his word faith cometh by hearing hearing the word by faith you're safe through grace not by anything whether you shake or speak with tongues whatever takes place that has nothing to do into it at all jesus said he that heareth my words and believe it's on him that sent me hath eternal life he that hears my word some believe it's been made quickened to him hath eternal life there it is doesn't matter he said what little thing that you do if you go back and look at that in Hebrews chapter five and six he talks about how that the people were putting all their faith in shaking or running the aisles or something like that speaking in tongues he said but it doesn't matter what little thing that you do don't those are the effects of his presence but what is it it's the faith that you have if you hear the words of God and there's the ability there somehow you understand it hey men what is that it's the grace of God to you and sometimes we begin to look for something else when what we have is what God give us grace to half now look the word of this hours and dwelt with the spirit the same as he was Matthew 3:16 I'm closing in a few moments just bear with me Matthew 3:16 people will ask you is it hard to preach to a lot of people to a big crowd and that's not true it's actually hard to preach to a small crowd because you feel like you're yelling at everybody so I apologize for that but I know there's others watching and I trust that the entire church is able to see this this morning and you know that's that's just part of it and in and I don't want to I'm self aware this morning more than I should be but I don't want to I don't want to make it too personal to you but I think that we do need to take the Word of God personally if the shoe fits wear it just don't put on anything that's not yours so the word of the hour is indwelt by the spirit Matthew 3:16 Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and brother branham always adds the verbage he said would come from the original I'm pleased to dwell in I'm pleased to dwell in it was the indwelling of the Holy Spirit which could not come even to John but had to come to the word it could not come to anything else but he was the word right he was the word he was the Incarnate God he was incarnate brother Branham said that seed that came was Jehovah that first seed that was in Mary was not Mary and it was not human it was it was God made in human form he was incarnate God but yet the indwelling of the Spirit come down and in dwelt the word what does the Holy Spirit come down on he comes down on the word that's what he's indwelling and so if you think I just don't live a good-enough life I'm just not good enough no you can receive the Holy Spirit if you come God's provided way and how you receive that is you let him and dwell the word in your life he's not indwelling your flesh because if he was we because it'd be costly have belief right and we can grieve him but we're not grieving him from the work what are we grieving him from the effects on our flesh right we can't feel him anymore we lose the joy of our salvation but we don't lose him why because he doesn't end well the by the flesh hope you're with me this morning he indwells the word and when the dynamics and the mechanics come together in your life you may even backside but you'll come back why because he's indwelling the word hey Ben oh my huh but the brown says the Dove which was God and this is improving his word he said descending from heaven with a voice saying this is my beloved son and whom I'm pleased to dwell what did he come to do to redeem that part of the earth he was the beginning of the creation of God what does the Holy Spirit come into the word for to redeem oh my oh my because he again you could you could do things that were wrong and you would you would grieve him but he would still be in the in the word but what does he want to do he wants to redeem you he wants to redeem you he wants to bring you back and we know that this flesh is never fully redeemed until we get a change right but yet he wants to redeem the earth oh my look so it's not that you'll get the Holy Ghost they just go live any way you want to but that was that Holy Spirit that in dwells the word comes to redeem the body are you with me now now what did he come to do were to redeem that part of the earth he was the beginning of the creation of God because God is not a creation only in Christ he is a creation because God is eternal and a spirit a spirit is not created he was the beginning of the creation of God and God redeemed that body see when he come down this is my beloved son I'm well pleased in him so he said God coming down after going through this and now every son he said that you eat and born of a natural sexual birth the way you come when it comes to a place where you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down with the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him oh my the Holy Ghost in God is the same spirit and so he comes in and dwells the word so that he can increase until he can claim the entire being oh my because he's gonna have all of you amen and so it comes down and claims he said the Holy Ghost from God is the same spirit so it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost I'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of his head will even Paris he said that is the beginning of the creation of God speaking of Christ he said this is a continuation of the creation of God oh my so now look and I hope I haven't confused you so far but I've done it to make a point haven't confused you to make a point but I've said these things to make a point when we come to Christ everything that we have need of is within us to be born again to have the resurrection but we've got to grow into it and if the word is there to be quickened then he will quick in that life until he is able to end well it and when he indwells that word he will then quicken you and he doesn't stop until you get there now with visions 4:11 tells us the speaks of the fullness and I'm gonna skip down I'm sorry for doing this but I'm it's hard for when I skip around for the people on the on the slides but I'm gonna skip down to verse 14 because we we understand the first part of that to give some apostles and prophets and so forth he said that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro so there's a purpose for the ministry there's a purpose for hearing the word and remember faith comes by hearing of the word so there's there's a seed there there's faith there but yet that faith has to be awakened you see fully explain that I can't but you already have the faith you need yet your faith comes by hearing the word somehow it awakens that it increases that when we come to Christ we have all these things but we don't want to be when we come we're children we don't want to be children so we want to grow up into the stature of a perfect man so he said carried not carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head in even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now but the Branham explains that he said when you see that little plant about like that just out of an apple seed he said have set it out there in every apple that will ever be on there it's got in it then potentially hundreds of bushels of apples that you'll collect off of it and it ain't a half inch high he said there you are where does it come from it's in the Apple then so it's impossible for you not to overcome and what that does for us does not make us we're okay I'll overcome regardless what I do know it makes you without excuse makes me without excuse all right if I don't overcome with the word that I have there's something wrong and it's not something wrong with the word because you will overcome and like I said you may fall everything else but in the end you will overcome we judge things by pictures on Facebook and we judge things by moments and time and tweets and we judge things by whether somebody comes to church now or not but yeah if you look at in the entirety of life an overcomer overcomes somewhere in that life they're gonna overcome by the Danny there's got to be something in them that overcomes it may not happen all it wants maybe for years they were a drunk or maybe for years they were doing things they shouldn't but there comes a time they will overcome and I want to tell you this morning you will overcome you say well if I could just shout if I could just speak in tongues so everything you have need of is inside that apple seed but you've got to get to the place where you just surrender to that and it begins to grow in your life let it grow in your life it has it includes shouting coming to an altar letting hands be laid on you whatever it is but let it grow you said you set the little plan out every Apple to deliver beyond there Scotty in it then hundreds of bushels of apples that you collect off of it and sometimes we can't see inside the seed and so that little seeds got things in it got potential in it right and that little seeds got a deacon in it somewhere but you don't see that Deacon when he's running around cruising you know down the streets as a teenager you don't see that preacher when it's a young person acted up in the church right you don't see the potential of what that seed is you don't see that resurrected son of God when they're smoking dope they're doing drugs you can't see that but it doesn't mean it's not bad oh my and it goes to the power of the preached word because I can preach and there's nothing I can do to make you more of a Christian there's nothing I can do to make you grow there's nothing I can do but preach the word and when I preach the word or someone else comes behind this pulpit and preach the sword what does it do it causes you to hear the word that's pretty simple isn't it when you hear the word what happens first weren't there it'll respond to the word it will respond to the word and as it responds it grows and pretty soon we see that deacon coming out we see that preacher that song leader coming down we see something coming and everybody has known you all your life we'll look at that and say there's no way he could do that but God saw it in the beginning God saw the entirety of the life he knew exactly what he wanted him you know exactly what he wanted you to go through so he sees inside of that seat everything that it will be we can't see that but we have to have faith to believe and so I don't believe people are serpent seed when I preach to him what good does it do to believe that what good is to do sit there and say well there's three kinds of believers so we try to figure out who they are doesn't do any good why because when I do that all I do is limit what God can do I don't know but some of you may not make it and I pray that every one of you does some of you may not but there may be somebody that we haven't even heard of yet that'll be the last seed that comes in it may be somebody that's on the worst kind of you look at today may be the worst saying that people around here do this mess and you see a meth-head walk around with their teeth falling out and everything like that and you think how could that ever be the Son of God tattoos all over them let me tell you God can save them as much as he saved you then what is our responsibility to to call it to make that explosion happen and how can we do that we can't make it happen just by preaching the word oh my so we keep the church open so the word can be preached and the people can hear it and we can all grow into what that seed ought to be hey Ben where does it come from he said it's in the Apple then he said and when you're planted into his death burial and resurrection planted in Christ and receive His Holy Spirit life in you everything that you've got need of all the way through this journey is in you right then for you become the seed God in his word he said now what does a tree have to do this is in show us the father and it was suffice as he said when you plant it the only thing you have to do is water it and then it's got to drink the leaves are in it the apples are in and everything is right in the tree but it's got to drink and this is my prayer today said it's got to drink more than its portion more than its portion now I look at that for a moment go back again to the prayer of Jabez and jay-bez praises to the Lord and large my territory he's not saying he wanted what somebody else is supposed to have but he said Lord I want to make sure that my portion is sufficient enlarge my territory so he says you drink it drinks more than its portion when I pray I say God help me to drink more than my portion help me to drink more than what I need just to preach to you I need to drink something that'll caused me to grow you see why I'm minister has to say in the word because you've got to drink more than your portion Oman don't you see why I Christian has to stay in the word but Harvey because you've got to drink more than your portion you can drink you could get by with just reading scriptures once in a while you can get by with just reading the quote now and then but you drink more than your portion because you don't want to just get by you want to grow and as it drinks it push this out and push this out leaves it pushes out blossoms and you've seen that and I've seen it all the sudden as it grows as it begins to drink in the word as you see even children young people they begin to drink in the word it begins to push out blossoms you begin to see peace in their life and joy and long-suffering you begin to see the qualities of a Christian the fruits of the Spirit in their life you begin to see maybe somebody begin to do things around the church they didn't used to do begin to be a help instead of just dead weight dragging around why because it's drinking more than its portion when you see a Christian that is just dead weight and continues to be dead weight year after year after year and I'm not talking about someone who's physically unable to do I'm talking about somebody that just constant drag criticizing and carrying on all the time if they're just dead weight year after year after year what's happening they're just not drinking enough they're just not feeding on the word enough because if they would just feed on that Living Word if they would just drink more than their portion they would begin to boss them out push out apples he said but it's got to keep drinking drinking drinking in order to push out when we take a promise of God drop it into our heart we keep watering it with faith and it keeps pushing out pushing out hallelujah he said when Christ is planted in our heart the Holy Ghost the only thing we do is drink the Word of God well you say well I need a certain amount of emotion I need to certain own the only thing you do is drink the Word of God it'll come in a motion at times it'll come in different ways effect as God has ways of putting making the atmosphere to be right around us oh we need to do is strength the Word of God it pushes out salvation it pushes out divine healing it pushes out glory it pushes out everything that we have needeth is right in us when we're planted in Christ Jesus you see the Holy Ghost inefficient 1:14 is the earnest or the seal of the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession so he's given us our guarantee and we want to look at that some more in just a moment but then next next week especially the Lord willing if we're still here and we want to make sure I believe we'll still be here unless the Lord comes but he may come in the next week and so we want to we want to look at the earnest in the in the guarantee of it but he said the person of Christ or it says it's the earnest of our inheritance that's the person of Christ and dwelling in you and that gives you the potentials of full redemption no brother Brent says I'm just gonna read this for lack of time he said quickly he said now notice he said it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit as vend welling in you the potential of it notice you are now on your way when do you get started on your way when you receive Christ when you believe in Christ that's when you get started on your way you say well those people are you know just starting they're just not like me you're still started on your way you're still continuing on your way all right well I have the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean you stop that means you started it means you accelerated right so notice he said you're on your way now growing to the full resurrection no tree comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the grace of knowledge of God you are baptized into the Holy Spirit he said now it's the Pentecostal church baptized into the Holy Spirit it's begin growing limbs has died they was pruning them off but the trees took growing is still going on because it's got to come to the rest should he said they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickening as you come he said to the first limb the second limb the 3rd limb on up it just keeps quickening the Spirit of God keeps quickening to you he said notice that Pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received he said that makes me feel religious now here was a man fishermen tax collectors humble little women ordinary housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth do we believe that today they believe that when Jesus died they believed on him and rose up again from the dead they believe that to be the absolute testimony of God that he had quickened them to life quickened him to life now they go up to the day of Pentecost he says to receive their abstract and then he begins to explain to abstraction we want to go there maybe next week but but look the indwelling of the Holy Ghost is our abstract and when brother Brian was talking about it and I want to get this before we go brother Adam is talking about an abstract he's not talking about the beginning of the search now I did title insurance for 15 years many times I've been handed abstracts and when I first came in they still did some abstracts and back in the day and some of you elderly folks so anybody that's been around buying houses for more than about 30 years knows what an abstract is and anymore we do title insurance well an abstract is a document right that that it has a list of all of the deeds in it and it shows through seeing your name well think about it when do you receive an abstract but the browser said they went up there to receive an abstract you don't receive an abstract when you make the handshake and so that's the parts if you show that side that's the parts of the closing process is when the contract is the handshake agreement or the written agreement that you make that says I'm gonna buy this but the contracts already made at this point right and then the closing is actually when you make the payment you you bring money or the bank brings money somebody brings money to the table you sit down at the table you sign all the documents and it's yours and brother branham calls out getting the title getting the title that's when you get the title and they take it in an escrow door whatever but there comes a time when you receive the abstract and what that means is or what I meant to brother branham in that day would have been actually getting it from the abstract office you would have went up there knocked on the door because it was too big to mail in many cases and now we mailed policies out but they would have the abstract and your original deed and they would have it together because during this time they've been paying off all of the lumps they've been curing all of the liens right that's what we did we pay off all the loans we investigate all the leads and we make sure there's nothing against the property and then we type up the abstract to renew it from the thing is when these mics go off we could say whatever we wanted to and those out there couldn't hear it but we won't do that but the abstract is when you get it back does that make sense you've gotten it back when you get it back whether it's mailed to you you went up to the office knocked on the door said I want my abstract it's time and what they did is waited for the return of the abstract during this time he's leading captivity captivity he's gone down preach the souls in hell all these things have taken place for their Redemption and he made the payment and they came on the day of Pentecost and waited until the abstract came back and it was no longer in the name of Jehovah it was no longer with a mortgage under Satan's law or under Satan's hold but now it would come out the other side paid for and redeemed it belonged to them by what is the abstract what is the Holy Ghost it is the guarantee the document or the proof that says it's in my name this belongs to me I wasn't there at the closing I didn't make the payment I couldn't I couldn't even make the cousin it I couldn't even make the agreement but the abstract a man is in me the abstract has shown me that it's mine it belongs to me listen what it did but the Brennan said let take a look at the faithful once at Pentecost they were all in the upper room and they were all scared and I know some of you may be scared this morning you may be scared and maybe maybe not just because of the coronavirus but there may be fear that puts on us it put gets put on us in all kinds of ways fear gets put on us so we believe that what we're just not gonna make you we're not good enough Christians but he said they were that way they were all scared they had the title all right but they were afraid and all at once there came a sound from heaven the abstract sit down to them like a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting and they were so quickened by that till all their cowardliness he said one of them was afraid that even deny he wasn't a Pharisee yet he wasn't a Sadducee yet maybe there's somebody listening like that maybe afraid to identify themselves with the message of the hour afraid to say I'm not a Baptist I'm not a Methodist I'm a believer he was afraid to deny that he wasn't a Pharisee yet it wasn't a sad to see but when that Holy Ghost fell and baptized him into Jesus Christ he became flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word he was a new creation he was a new person it quickened his body aren't you glad today we're not just going to the closing process listen and that's why you don't have to wait on the Holy Ghost you don't have to sit around and Jerry and wait and stay in an altar for hours and hours no you just received the Holy Ghost why the payments already been made the abstracts already been prepared it's in your name it's time to receive it this morning hey man god bless you this morning musicians come I'm so amazed that he loves me I'm amazed that the power the word in the spirit to make it work in my day he's here not only that it's here but I have it I can make it work if I don't live it that's not on him because the indwelling of the Spirit is here and the quickening power to make it live I'm so grateful for that
