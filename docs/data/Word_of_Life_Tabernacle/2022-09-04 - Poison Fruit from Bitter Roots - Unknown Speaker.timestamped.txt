[0:01] it does no good to blame the ones who
[0:03] did the wounding
[0:05] what if we were working say in
[0:07] construction and
[0:09] and are you still with me this morning
[0:11] let's imagine that we were on a job and
[0:14] and i was messing around and maybe i was
[0:17] trying to help and i'm not much of a
[0:18] construction worker but i remember one
[0:20] of the things that was a no-no on the
[0:22] job if there's a board with nails in it
[0:24] you don't leave it on the ground with
[0:25] the nails sticking up
[0:27] right
[0:29] so it's there's a board with nails in it
[0:31] but the caleb and maybe you and i are
[0:32] working out there on the job and
[0:34] that's that's a terrible thought isn't
[0:35] it
[0:37] you've worked with my brother you know
[0:38] what that's like
[0:39] but we'd be working out there and on the
[0:41] ground and and i'll leave a board out
[0:43] like that well i've been yelled at that
[0:44] before when i was a kid we helped out on
[0:46] construction sites and and they'd yell
[0:48] at me and say hey don't do that turn it
[0:50] around stick the nails in the ground or
[0:52] take it and throw it in the scrap heap
[0:54] don't leave it out there on the ground
[0:55] somebody will step on it
[0:57] right so i leave it on the ground you
[0:58] walk by you're not looking and you walk
[1:00] by but you don't you expect the sight to
[1:02] be clean you walk by and you get a nail
[1:04] in your foot
[1:07] now watch
[1:08] no no you've got a choice
[1:11] what you're going to do about that
[1:13] you can stand there and yell at me
[1:16] for leaving a board up
[1:18] yes it's my fault
[1:22] but you need to go to the doctor
[1:25] make sure you've had a tetanus shot
[1:29] and why do they do that i know some of
[1:30] us don't think that's necessary
[1:32] why do they give tetanus shots because
[1:34] if you get
[1:36] lockjaw if you get the the the disease
[1:39] that comes from that
[1:41] one out of 10 people with that disease
[1:43] die
[1:45] so you could literally die
[1:47] from stepping on a rusty nail
[1:50] and your family might gather around and
[1:52] at the funeral and they say oh brother
[1:53] ben was so terrible he left out a nail
[1:56] and but what really killed you
[2:00] think about it
[2:02] because there's a
[2:04] there's an antidote available
[2:07] you all you had to do was get a shot
[2:12] and then you can blame me all you want
[2:15] but you wouldn't die
[2:17] are you hearing me today there's an
[2:19] antidote available you need to deal with
[2:22] it because that rusty nail will spread
[2:24] that poison will spread
[2:26] and if you've been wounded in your
[2:27] spirit it does no good to stand there
[2:30] and yell at the person who did the
[2:33] wounding
[2:35] it does you absolutely no good
[2:38] you'll stand there and die
[2:40] your body will begin to die
[2:43] why because that bitterness spreads
[2:45] through your body
[2:47] and you say but i died of the nail no
[2:49] you didn't you died because of your
[2:51] refusal to deal with it
[2:55] the wound was not fatal
[2:57] but the poison that wasn't dealt with
[2:59] was fatal
