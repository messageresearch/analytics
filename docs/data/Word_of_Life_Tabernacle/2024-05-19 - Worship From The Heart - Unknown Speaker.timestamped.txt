[44:21] 58 and when he had taken the book The
[44:24] Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell
[44:27] down before the lamb having every one of
[44:30] them Harps and golden vials full of
[44:33] odors which are the prayers of saints
[44:37] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[44:40] Worthy to take the book open the seals
[44:43] thereof thou was slain and Hast redeemed
[44:46] us to God by thy blood out of every
[44:48] Kindred and tongue and people and nation
[44:53] and H has made us unto our God Kings and
[44:56] Priests
[44:57] and we shall reign on the earth and I
[45:00] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[45:02] angels round about the throne and the
[45:04] Beast and the elders and the number of
[45:07] them was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[45:10] thousands of thousands saying with a
[45:13] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb was slain
[45:17] to receive power and riches and wisdom
[45:21] and strength and honor and glory and
[45:24] blessing every creature which is in
[45:27] heaven and on the earth and under the
[45:29] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[45:33] that are in them heard I saying blessing
[45:35] and honor and glory and power be unto
[45:38] him that sth upon the throne and unto
[45:41] the lamb forever and ever and the four
[45:45] beasts said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders
[45:48] fell down and worshiped him that liveth
[45:52] forever and ever I pray the Lord would
[45:54] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[45:56] seated this
[45:59] morning I want to speak to you this
[46:01] morning on worship from the
[46:04] heart what is
[46:07] worship the dictionary my the dictionary
[46:11] that I use for words for Old Testament
[46:13] New Testament words defines worship as
[46:15] the odd response to the saving acts and
[46:19] praiseworthy character of
[46:22] God you think about the 4 and2 Elders
[46:25] falling down
[46:27] before the lamb what else could they
[46:30] do because they recognized his
[46:33] worthiness and who he was in the Old
[46:36] Testament worship encompassed a variety
[46:38] of activities bringing forward an
[46:40] offering to God was an act of worship
[46:43] bowing down in the presence of God was
[46:45] an outward display of an inner attitude
[46:48] of reverence before the
[46:51] Creator the there was a verb uh in in
[46:54] the original there several uh HEB HEB
[46:57] words translated worship or exalting or
[46:59] lifting up or
[47:00] praise and the word uh room it's rum
[47:05] could indicate that a person was lifting
[47:07] up or exalting God With Praise it's
[47:10] another part of worship it provides a
[47:13] rich image of worship people bow before
[47:16] God and lift him up we we bow before him
[47:20] because of who he is and we lift him up
[47:22] for what he's
[47:23] done right and so the verb uh Halal in
[47:28] in the original was used to the act of
[47:30] celebrating God and I believe he's
[47:32] worthy of celebrating today and and and
[47:36] there was celebration of God that's
[47:38] where we get our word hallelujah which
[47:40] is derived from the Hebrew phrase which
[47:43] means praise Yahweh and the praise could
[47:47] involve uh singing that was a type of
[47:49] Praise zamar Worship could be described
[47:52] as as serving God as well the the old in
[47:56] the old test Testament the uh the the
[47:58] priest who would dedicate their life to
[48:01] the service of God that was worship
[48:03] because their entire life was spent in
[48:06] the service of God there's other words
[48:08] for for praising God it's carried over
[48:11] in the New Testament with words like uh
[48:13] proo which means to bow down as an act
[48:16] of worship and and compto which means
[48:19] bending the knee or bowing and reverence
[48:21] to God there's a word uh for praising
[48:24] God that's doxazo where we get doxology
[48:27] it's the act of giving God glory ulo
[48:30] which is praising or blessing God where
[48:32] we get the word eulogy for telling God
[48:35] who he is you say well God already knows
[48:37] who he is but he wants us to know who he
[48:39] is and to acknowledge who he
[48:43] is you know we have church and and just
[48:46] from my heart this morning you think
[48:48] well I I brother Ben I worship God every
[48:51] day and we should worship God in all
[48:53] that we do and in all that we are and in
[48:56] everything that say in every breath that
[48:58] we have we should worship God at home we
[49:00] should worship God at work we should
[49:02] worship God and yet we know we're
[49:04] distracted by many things and there's
[49:07] many things that happen in our life that
[49:09] we have to work we've got to take care
[49:11] of our families we've got to do those
[49:13] things so we set aside a moment on
[49:15] Sunday morning and on Sunday evening and
[49:18] on Wednesday night for worshiping God
[49:21] and during that time the entire service
[49:24] which even the word service gives you a
[49:26] clue as to what's happening God is
[49:29] serving us the word and we are serving
[49:32] God
[49:34] worship right so he is serving us and we
[49:37] are serving him and so we come to the
[49:40] service to see not just what we can get
[49:43] from God but what we can give to God
[49:46] what what part of uh can we give back to
[49:49] God what is he Desiring what does he
[49:51] want from me today what would please him
[49:54] in my attitude in my actions in
[49:56] everything that I am what would please
[49:58] God today in My
[50:00] Worship so we set aside these times and
[50:03] and you know in a message church we we
[50:05] do peculiar things we we have a a time
[50:09] of quietness before the service and we
[50:11] don't run around in the sanctuary why do
[50:13] we do that why do we have deacons that
[50:15] uh enforce that and set that aside you
[50:18] kids sometimes they'll stop you from
[50:20] running in the church why do we do that
[50:22] it's not because we just want a bunch of
[50:23] rules and we're want to make people feel
[50:26] bad we do that because this is a place
[50:28] of worship this is a place that we've
[50:30] designated it could be any place it
[50:32] could be a field but we've chosen this
[50:34] place to come together and and this is a
[50:37] place where Lord I'm going to focus on
[50:39] you I'm going to forget about everything
[50:41] else and I'm going to I'm just going to
[50:43] Bear down and focus on the almighty God
[50:47] I I'm going to Bow myself before someone
[50:50] who is so much greater than I could ever
[50:53] be and he can take care of every problem
[50:55] that I have
[50:57] and he's worth worshiping he's worthy of
[51:02] Our Praise but every part of the service
[51:06] is
[51:07] worship from the
[51:09] pre-service to the the
[51:12] singing the
[51:14] offering the everything that's done is
[51:18] worship brother brandham says that this
[51:20] way he said I want to read this morning
[51:22] some of the Bible he said I like the
[51:24] word don't you you like the word
[51:27] oh come on and we get a better response
[51:29] than that you don't have to like the guy
[51:30] that's preaching the word but do you
[51:32] like the
[51:33] word right you like the word I know
[51:36] sometimes we'll say things like that and
[51:38] worship is a
[51:39] response you realize that sometimes
[51:41] we're distracted and and a preacher will
[51:43] get up and say everybody that's a
[51:44] Christian raise your hand three people
[51:45] raise their
[51:48] hand look Danny steam was preaching last
[51:51] night at Christian Tabernacle and I got
[51:53] a kick out of it he said uh turn around
[51:55] and look at all these perfect people you
[51:57] know and everybody turned around and of
[51:59] course nobody's perfect but in the eyes
[52:00] of God they are and then he said he said
[52:03] turn around look at your enemy and tell
[52:05] them you love them or something like
[52:06] that people start looking
[52:10] around you know but but every response
[52:13] that we have is an act of
[52:16] worship that's why when we're asked to
[52:19] do something as a part of worship if we
[52:21] can we should do it and I understand
[52:24] sometimes when we're standing or
[52:25] whatever some of you Elders that you
[52:26] can't stand very long and you have to
[52:28] sit down and that's perfectly fine but
[52:30] when we are asked to do something if we
[52:32] do have the capability of doing that we
[52:34] ought to do that if it's clapping or
[52:36] raising our hands or whatever it is
[52:38] because there's someone up here not just
[52:40] up here you're not up here we're not up
[52:42] here to just make a show brother Allen
[52:44] doesn't get up here so everybody can see
[52:45] his new tie or or his shoes or something
[52:48] like we don't get up here so you can see
[52:50] us we're up here to Lead You In Worship
[52:53] but it's not one-sided see that was the
[52:54] problem with romanism that's a problem
[52:56] with Catholic it become just a priest
[52:58] doing everything and the people just sit
[53:00] back and watch I don't want that to be
[53:02] what our church is or what we are as a
[53:05] part of the Bride of Jesus Christ we got
[53:07] to participate in Worship in whatever
[53:10] way that we can that don't mean you'll
[53:11] be the loudest person in the room it
[53:13] just means in some way there'll be a
[53:15] response to the word of God there's
[53:18] something there that responds when you
[53:20] hear the word is something that grabs a
[53:22] hold of you so he said I like the word
[53:25] don't you he said now we've worked
[53:26] worshiped the Lord now he's he's just
[53:29] beginning his sermon he said we've
[53:31] worshiped the Lord and we'll continue to
[53:33] worship Him He said now let's worship
[53:36] him as a cutting sharp edged sword so
[53:40] during the preaching we're worshiping
[53:43] him as a cutting sharp edged sword as it
[53:46] moves through us to find out where we're
[53:49] standing you realize that's part of
[53:51] worship right we're worshiping him in
[53:54] that way and so our resp response to
[53:57] that is
[53:58] worship and our lack of response to that
[54:00] is
[54:01] worship right it depends on our lack of
[54:04] worship it depends on how worthy you
[54:06] think he is and whether you believe the
[54:09] word being preached or not what response
[54:12] that you have to the word now even I I
[54:15] said and I'll go back to this brother
[54:17] brandham taught us that an offering was
[54:19] part of worship and I'm I'm seeing you
[54:21] know some of these little things
[54:23] matter and I begin to see us in the
[54:25] message we drift away from taking
[54:27] offerings and and I understand why
[54:29] because you don't want to over and I I
[54:31] I've made a commitment we'll just have
[54:33] one offering of service no matter what
[54:35] because I don't want to over uh tax the
[54:37] people that's not what we're here for so
[54:40] we put a box in the back and things like
[54:42] that but but an offering is a part of
[54:45] worship brother brandham says that it's
[54:47] a direct quote he said an offering is a
[54:49] part of worship and he said he in one
[54:52] place in his in his campaigns that he
[54:55] quit doing the offering he said and the
[54:57] Lord didn't bless it he said and people
[55:00] were wondering where can I give my
[55:01] offering because they wanted to Worship
[55:02] in that way he said that's right I know
[55:04] more than that that than that than ever
[55:07] since the other day when I was going to
[55:09] give Hattie right back that $20 that
[55:12] she'd pledged toward the new Tabernacle
[55:13] in Jeffersonville you that know the
[55:15] story of hady Wright you know that she
[55:17] gave brother bandam $20 and the only
[55:19] reason he's in her
[55:20] house because he come to give it back
[55:23] right and when he come to her house to
[55:25] give it back
[55:27] the Lord said don't do
[55:29] that he said the Lord said just let her
[55:31] alone sir he said because the the widow
[55:34] woman walked by and Jesus never stopped
[55:36] her from giving her two mights he didn't
[55:38] want her money he didn't need her money
[55:40] but it was an act of
[55:43] worship and said the Lord said just let
[55:45] her alone he said in a few minutes later
[55:47] I see why he said let her alone because
[55:50] it was that act of worship that led
[55:53] towards her receiving the promise and
[55:55] being the first human being being to
[55:56] ever speak the word and have the word
[55:58] spoken to her in that Supernatural way
[56:01] look at listen that is exactly she
[56:03] wasn't a prophet she wasn't a great
[56:05] person but she was somebody who believed
[56:07] God and was willing to submit herself to
[56:09] the word of God for the hour and say
[56:11] it's nothing but the truth but it began
[56:13] with an
[56:15] offering I'm not saying that to get your
[56:17] money today but I'll say this you young
[56:19] people and brothers that take up the
[56:21] offering we should take that
[56:24] seriously whether there's a whole congre
[56:26] here or just a few of us we should make
[56:28] sure everybody's offering is taken that
[56:30] wants to give and the reason for that is
[56:33] because we we that person wants to
[56:35] Worship in that way they're not just
[56:36] doing that that's a part of their
[56:38] worship it may be a dime it may be a
[56:40] dollar but it's a part of
[56:42] worship and we don't want to we don't
[56:44] want to let that
[56:45] go praise is a part of
[56:49] worship how many believe that this
[56:51] morning praise is a part of worship
[56:55] Psalm 149 says Praise You the Lord sing
[56:58] unto the Lord a new song and his praise
[57:01] in the congregation of saints now again
[57:04] you can worship God wherever you're at
[57:06] you can worship God and sing in the
[57:07] shower but there's a time that we've
[57:09] designated to come together to worship
[57:12] God and to focus on this very thing in a
[57:15] place where we know that he is and so
[57:18] we're going to worship him because he's
[57:20] here so Psalms 149 said sing unto the
[57:24] Lord a new song is praise in the
[57:25] congregation of saints let Israel
[57:28] rejoice in him that made him let the
[57:31] children of Zion be joyful in their King
[57:35] let them praise His name in The Dance
[57:38] Let Them sing praises unto him with the
[57:41] timberl and heart but the lord taketh
[57:43] pleasure in his people he will beautify
[57:47] the meek with salvation now the idea of
[57:51] worship began with the idea of a king so
[57:55] he said let's praise the King and we
[57:57] don't understand As Americans we don't
[57:59] understand what it means to have a king
[58:02] brother Bram talked about how the king
[58:04] would go through and he said Ern Baxter
[58:06] who was a Canadian he said a tear would
[58:08] run down his face because the King was
[58:10] coming by it means something to him and
[58:13] there's a Majesty to that office it
[58:15] would be
[58:16] Unthinkable to not bow in the presence
[58:21] of the
[58:22] king in in old times it would be a
[58:25] desence
[58:26] to not bow in the presence of a king Not
[58:31] only would they bow in the presence of a
[58:32] king but they would bow in the presence
[58:35] of a king's minister or even a king's
[58:39] I'm not saying to bow in the presence of
[58:40] preachers but like a like a head of
[58:42] state they would bow in the presence of
[58:45] they would bow in in the presence of a
[58:47] king's garments or a king's Insignia or
[58:51] the Ring of a king they would actually
[58:54] because they were submitting themselves
[58:56] to a higher authority listen you don't
[58:58] have to submit yourself to me but you do
[59:00] have to submit yourself to him and if
[59:02] the king is in the room what kind of
[59:04] attitude should we
[59:07] have the king's in the room you say well
[59:10] I left my my my cro poot on I'm afraid
[59:13] it's going to burn but the king's in the
[59:16] room are you with me now I oh I I I've
[59:19] had trouble at work this week but the
[59:20] king is in the room I've struggled with
[59:24] with neighbors I've got trouble with my
[59:25] neighbor I got trouble with my family I
[59:27] got trouble at the church but the king
[59:29] is in the room then what should we do
[59:32] when we come in the room this is a house
[59:34] of worship this is not a place for me to
[59:37] elevate my complexes this is not a place
[59:40] for you to elevate your
[59:42] complexes this is a house of worship
[59:45] this is a place where we lift him up
[59:48] where we lower oursel and we lift him up
[59:51] and I say Lord be lifted up Among Us be
[59:54] lifted up be welcome Among Us amen take
[59:57] pleasure in your people he said let them
[59:59] praise His name in The Dance Let Them
[1:00:01] sing praises unto him with a timberl and
[1:00:03] harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his
[1:00:05] people he will beautify the meek with
[1:00:08] salvation oh I love that you think of
[1:00:12] this sense of awe the sense of reverence
[1:00:15] that would come with being in the
[1:00:17] presence of a king you wouldn't have
[1:00:19] time to get on your phone and and look
[1:00:21] on Facebook you wouldn't even think of
[1:00:24] it if you knew you in the presence of a
[1:00:27] king right and that's why we take this
[1:00:29] time to get apart from all that stuff
[1:00:32] right we take we wouldn't have time to
[1:00:34] to sit there and well you know I don't
[1:00:36] think brother so and so really likes me
[1:00:38] but you're not in brother so and so's
[1:00:40] presence you're in the presence of the
[1:00:43] king and so we don't come together to
[1:00:46] worship us we come together to worship
[1:00:49] the king there's an awe and a reverence
[1:00:52] that comes with that sometimes weeping
[1:00:54] comes with that in the presence as ER
[1:00:56] backer the tear run down his face
[1:00:58] because of the king and it's not
[1:01:00] necessarily because you're a sinner many
[1:01:03] times You Weep because just the presence
[1:01:05] of the king you realize that he's here
[1:01:07] and when you recognize that he's here it
[1:01:09] does something to you it it squeezes
[1:01:12] your heart as I've heard I'm sure you've
[1:01:13] heard brother Daryl Ward say that he
[1:01:14] said he squeezes your heart and the
[1:01:16] juice runs out your eyes but it's just a
[1:01:20] it's it's his
[1:01:21] presence and that's a Biblical form of
[1:01:24] worship lifting up of hands
[1:01:26] crying shouting dancing
[1:01:30] singing all biblical forms of worship
[1:01:34] listen we didn't make that
[1:01:36] up and when someone accuses me of being
[1:01:38] Pentecostal the Assemblies of God didn't
[1:01:41] make up dancing in the
[1:01:43] spirit right and the people of the
[1:01:46] people of the world didn't make up
[1:01:48] dancing in the spirit before there was
[1:01:50] ever a rock and roll
[1:01:52] party there was dancing in the spirit
[1:01:55] before there was ever a a a sports
[1:01:58] Stadium filled with screaming
[1:02:00] fans there were sons of God when the
[1:02:04] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[1:02:07] of God shouted for Joy brother brandom
[1:02:10] they told Brother brand they said you
[1:02:11] got some of this new religion where you
[1:02:13] where you shout and things like that he
[1:02:14] said no I got a a new case of oldtime
[1:02:17] religion amen a new case of old time
[1:02:20] religion he said because he said that
[1:02:22] when the morning Stars sang together I
[1:02:24] was there when the sons of God shouted
[1:02:26] for joy in the mind of God I was
[1:02:30] there that's that's been going on
[1:02:32] forever we didn't start
[1:02:35] that and I think sometimes we lose track
[1:02:39] because we did have a voice of authority
[1:02:41] in our age and it's not
[1:02:43] me right it's a prophet in our
[1:02:46] age that was a voice of authority
[1:02:48] because we had the the written bible we
[1:02:50] had to have somebody to come and tell us
[1:02:53] the light bring the light to those
[1:02:54] scriptures
[1:02:56] and and so I would follow the example of
[1:02:58] a
[1:02:59] prophet and the words of a prophet
[1:03:02] before I would follow my own words or
[1:03:06] what I feel like when it comes to
[1:03:08] worship and a lot of people for whatever
[1:03:11] reason I I told you you know it seems
[1:03:13] like we're doing away with offerings and
[1:03:15] it's like we begin and I'm not
[1:03:16] criticizing other people I'm just
[1:03:17] thinking ourselves what we want to do
[1:03:19] what we want to be but it it seems like
[1:03:21] we're also doing with
[1:03:23] worship especially at the end of the
[1:03:27] service you realize why we do that
[1:03:30] because brother brandom taught us to do
[1:03:33] that right sir now now look how brother
[1:03:35] brandom defines worship he said I like
[1:03:38] to worship don't you he said now we
[1:03:40] don't come to church just to hear a
[1:03:42] sermon that goes with it but we come to
[1:03:44] church to worship Worship in the spirit
[1:03:47] and in truth he said you've heard the
[1:03:50] truth that's the word now to worship is
[1:03:53] to express yourself to
[1:03:58] him this is how you feel about
[1:04:02] him oh church and I know many of you
[1:04:05] feel about God you feel that he's holy
[1:04:09] you feel that that that he's great you
[1:04:11] feel his majesty you feel his love you
[1:04:13] feel that you you you you feel that but
[1:04:15] many times we don't know how to express
[1:04:17] it but worship is something that we
[1:04:20] learn to do to
[1:04:22] express the word of God and it has
[1:04:25] nothing to do because you could be a
[1:04:26] worshipper you could be someone who
[1:04:28] worships God not be a seed of God but a
[1:04:30] seed of God will worship
[1:04:32] God right you could be a you could be
[1:04:35] someone who was a a Cain Cain built an
[1:04:38] altar but he didn't worship under the
[1:04:40] blood but you and I are under the blood
[1:04:42] we're under the atonement an atonement
[1:04:44] of the token an atonement of the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost an atonement of the message of the
[1:04:48] hour you think about where we're at and
[1:04:50] what we believe and and what time it is
[1:04:52] it's a time for worship if there ever
[1:04:55] was one but uh that worship now he said
[1:04:58] you've heard the truth he said that's
[1:05:00] the word to worship is to express
[1:05:03] yourself to him I want him to know how I
[1:05:07] feel about
[1:05:09] him
[1:05:11] right now you know you have special time
[1:05:15] set aside for your wife special time set
[1:05:17] aside for your children special time set
[1:05:20] aside for your family some people do
[1:05:21] that in birthdays we're not much of on
[1:05:23] birthday parties I we didn't do them
[1:05:26] that much we had parties but I I my
[1:05:28] birthday was in July and my party was in
[1:05:30] May so we kind of lumped all that
[1:05:32] together big family you know and it's
[1:05:34] it's fine I have no I don't have any
[1:05:36] issues from that I've not had to see
[1:05:38] anybody about
[1:05:40] it
[1:05:44] but but you know that's just what we did
[1:05:46] we're not big birthday party but we do
[1:05:47] take special time for people and I
[1:05:49] remember one of the things my dad would
[1:05:51] do is he'd take me with him to work on
[1:05:53] his birthday and and we'd get to go what
[1:05:55] for a few years there when we were
[1:05:56] younger we would go with him because he
[1:05:58] was a traveling salesman sold Insurance
[1:06:00] we' go with him and we would uh get that
[1:06:02] day off from school or whatever we were
[1:06:04] doing and and we'd go play Ministry golf
[1:06:05] it was a big deal I remember how badly I
[1:06:08] felt one day cuz we were leaving and it
[1:06:11] was pouring rain just dumping rain and
[1:06:13] dad said no miniature golf
[1:06:15] today man this was my chance to go to
[1:06:18] McDonald's in the mall and and and get a
[1:06:22] Happy Meal cuz we never got to get a
[1:06:23] Happy Meal right so you got to get one
[1:06:26] once once a year twice a year something
[1:06:27] like that it's too expensive to get
[1:06:29] everybody a Happy Meal so you got a
[1:06:31] Happy Meal and then you uh then you uh
[1:06:33] you got to go to the miniature golf
[1:06:35] place we and and that day I I remember
[1:06:37] that feeling I still remember that and
[1:06:40] sitting there in my little heart and how
[1:06:42] man it's so terrible and then the sun
[1:06:43] come out and I think we ended up playing
[1:06:45] miniature golf but I remember the
[1:06:46] feeling that I had because today was my
[1:06:50] day right wonder how God
[1:06:54] feels we said it side Sunday morning for
[1:06:56] a couple hours try not to drag out the
[1:06:59] service I wonder how he feel sometimes
[1:07:01] when we come in all we got and running
[1:07:02] our minds
[1:07:04] complexes all we got is our insecurities
[1:07:06] and what we've been through and we're
[1:07:08] afraid and Lord I need your help I need
[1:07:10] your help and that's good we we need he
[1:07:12] he does help us he does it over and over
[1:07:15] again but I watched these young people
[1:07:17] you know when they went to camp and how
[1:07:18] they worshiped God at camp and and they
[1:07:21] worship God here too and all of you do
[1:07:22] and I'm proud of you but but you know
[1:07:24] when you set aside that special time why
[1:07:26] do people tend to worship more at Camp
[1:07:28] well it's the atmosphere and you set
[1:07:29] aside that time and you're away in a
[1:07:32] place where your phone don't work and
[1:07:33] nothing works and you're just sitting
[1:07:34] there you're with other people and so
[1:07:36] you just
[1:07:37] worship you just worship there's nothing
[1:07:39] else to
[1:07:42] do I wonder how many of you know we're
[1:07:44] not present sometimes at our kids'
[1:07:45] birthday parties I'm not rebuking you
[1:07:47] for that but you know how it is you kind
[1:07:49] of you go you're there but you're not
[1:07:51] there wonder how that kid
[1:07:54] feels right if you've been a kid maybe
[1:07:56] you know how that
[1:07:57] feels I wonder when we celebrate the
[1:08:01] King how he feel sometimes when we just
[1:08:03] clock in and cluck
[1:08:06] out you ever think about it we just came
[1:08:10] and we had our church we had our service
[1:08:12] we we we did Church order we we did
[1:08:15] everything we're supposed to do we sang
[1:08:16] Our three songs and we get up at the end
[1:08:18] we sing a song we leave I wonder if he
[1:08:21] felt
[1:08:22] welcome I wonder if I wonder if he he
[1:08:24] felt like he'd
[1:08:26] the need that he had for worship that's
[1:08:28] the whole reason he made you was to
[1:08:31] worship and you realize he'll do
[1:08:33] anything to get that out of your
[1:08:36] life and sometimes you wonder why have I
[1:08:38] been through what I've been through and
[1:08:39] many times you know it's not punishment
[1:08:41] and I talking to the brothers about that
[1:08:42] earlier it never is we talked about that
[1:08:44] Wednesday night God can't punish you
[1:08:46] because you're in his body and you
[1:08:48] already paid your the price for your
[1:08:50] sins he cannot punish you no matter how
[1:08:53] bad or how wrong you've been if you're
[1:08:54] born again you can't can't be punished
[1:08:56] for
[1:08:57] sin right you can be
[1:08:59] corrected but I wonder how many times
[1:09:01] it's just from he wants to get that
[1:09:03] worship out of our lives and he realizes
[1:09:06] the only way to do that is just allow us
[1:09:07] to be squeezed a little
[1:09:11] bit and maybe we get sick or we get in
[1:09:14] trouble or and all of a sudden people
[1:09:15] begin to worship you begin to see it and
[1:09:18] as a pastor you know people have said
[1:09:20] well brother Ben are you scared slow
[1:09:22] times will come and are you scared of a
[1:09:24] depression are you scared of persecution
[1:09:26] no because I've seen during times of uh
[1:09:29] when the economy was tied and the people
[1:09:31] didn't have any money I've been to
[1:09:32] Africa I've been to the Philippines I
[1:09:34] I've been to Egypt I've been to
[1:09:36] different parts of the world I've been
[1:09:37] to those places where there's
[1:09:38] persecution I've sat there and preached
[1:09:40] when there was there was a guy with a
[1:09:42] machine gun sitting outside the door
[1:09:44] waiting on a terrorist to come across
[1:09:45] the street I've been there I've preached
[1:09:47] under that kind of protection and I've
[1:09:49] sat there in a Muslim area and watch
[1:09:50] them people worship God with all of
[1:09:53] their heart and they don't know what you
[1:09:54] know they didn't have what we have I I
[1:09:56] preached in an Evangelical Church didn't
[1:09:58] even know about the message but when
[1:10:00] they heard the message of the hour they
[1:10:02] rejoiced to hear it they they pulled on
[1:10:05] the gift of God why because there was
[1:10:07] something in their heart to respond to
[1:10:09] that even though all you say are you
[1:10:11] scared of that happening no it would
[1:10:13] just bring a worship out of our Lives
[1:10:16] what causes us to not worship many times
[1:10:18] is the is the curse of leoa which is
[1:10:21] soft
[1:10:22] living that's what makes us the way we
[1:10:24] are many many times it's just and not to
[1:10:26] say I want anything bad I don't want
[1:10:28] anything bad to happen to you but I'll
[1:10:30] say this our worship has got to come
[1:10:32] from the heart and sometimes the only
[1:10:34] way you can get that from us is to let
[1:10:35] us go through a little bit of a hard
[1:10:41] time we got to learn to express
[1:10:44] ourself we got to learn to be present in
[1:10:48] worship and not just
[1:10:53] there the Old Testament they were
[1:10:54] commanded to worship but our worship
[1:10:57] comes from the heart should be sincere
[1:11:00] we should sing from the heart Psalms
[1:11:01] 138:1 I will praise thee with my whole
[1:11:06] heart you realize that's why we have to
[1:11:08] forgive one another because we can't
[1:11:10] praise him with our whole heart if we
[1:11:12] keep unforgiveness in our
[1:11:14] heart you realize if you've held on to
[1:11:16] bitterness for years it's been years
[1:11:19] since you really worshiped
[1:11:22] God I got real quiet but now think about
[1:11:27] it that bitterness just keeps you
[1:11:29] because he got to worship with with your
[1:11:30] whole
[1:11:31] heart said before the gods will I sing
[1:11:34] praise unto thee speaking to yourselves
[1:11:37] Ephesians 5:19 the New Testament in
[1:11:39] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:11:42] singing and making Melody where in your
[1:11:46] heart to the Lord should come from the
[1:11:50] heart Colossians 3:16 let the word of
[1:11:51] Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:11:54] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:11:56] what songs hymns spiritual songs singing
[1:12:00] with
[1:12:03] Grace you got to have a revelation of
[1:12:05] grace before you can sing with Grace we
[1:12:07] preached about that Wednesday night you
[1:12:09] got to have a revelation of Grace
[1:12:11] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[1:12:15] Lord Brother Band speaks about sincerity
[1:12:17] and we get caught up a lot of times on
[1:12:19] music and we think well if it's old it's
[1:12:21] good if it's new it's bad or sometimes
[1:12:23] we reverse that and say well if it's new
[1:12:24] it's good if it's old it's bad and
[1:12:27] that's not the question at all brother
[1:12:29] BR talks about these oldfashioned hymns
[1:12:31] he said where he said what's going with
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:34] sincerity where's those oldfashioned
[1:12:36] hymns we used to sing and rejoice in the
[1:12:38] spirit of God see there there's the key
[1:12:41] lots of places sing old hymns and don't
[1:12:43] Rejoice don't worship but he said
[1:12:46] where's those oldfashioned HMS we used
[1:12:48] to sing and rejoice in the spirit of God
[1:12:49] and tears roll down our cheeks and now
[1:12:52] we try to hold our breath until we ain't
[1:12:53] got enough breath in US till her face
[1:12:55] turns blue to try to show we're some
[1:12:57] sort of a singer he said see we've
[1:12:58] copied that off of Hollywood and all
[1:13:01] these programs that we see through this
[1:13:02] intellectual hymn singing training of
[1:13:05] voice he said I like to hear good
[1:13:07] singing I like to hear good
[1:13:09] old-fashioned heartfelt Pentecostal
[1:13:11] singing right he said but I sure hate to
[1:13:14] hear that squeaking they call singing
[1:13:16] today so that's right I think that's the
[1:13:18] most ridiculous thing it's a perversion
[1:13:21] so it's not a
[1:13:23] performance and we shouldn't treat treat
[1:13:25] it like a performance and I'm saying
[1:13:27] that to both the singer and the
[1:13:31] congregation right if you sit there and
[1:13:33] judge the person how they
[1:13:36] sing and then applaud if you really
[1:13:39] liked it or maybe a little less if you
[1:13:41] didn't like it is that worship I'm not
[1:13:45] against Applause but what should we be
[1:13:47] doing how do we sing the songs that we
[1:13:49] sing I can I go off on a little bit of a
[1:13:51] tangent here I I'm asking your
[1:13:53] permission you forgive me
[1:13:55] how do we sing what we sing and not
[1:14:01] worship sing songs like Oh The Blood of
[1:14:05] Jesus how do you you can't get that far
[1:14:08] in The Pongal it just it just overwhelms
[1:14:15] you we sing songs like our god is
[1:14:18] awesome he's
[1:14:20] awesome how does that not inspire a
[1:14:23] sense of the awe and the presence of God
[1:14:25] in our in our
[1:14:27] hearts I think sometimes we get cold
[1:14:30] with it we we get to where it was just a
[1:14:32] performance it's just it's just well I'm
[1:14:34] afraid to sing because I don't know how
[1:14:36] I sound the people around me and I think
[1:14:38] we should try to sound good we we should
[1:14:40] try to blend in with all the other parts
[1:14:42] of the church but that's not what it's
[1:14:43] about it's
[1:14:45] worship and we didn't come to worship
[1:14:47] you and we didn't come to worship me we
[1:14:50] come to worship the king and the king is
[1:14:53] in the room and if he's in the room what
[1:14:56] should we do what should our reaction be
[1:14:59] how can we sing a song
[1:15:01] like on a hill far away stood an Old
[1:15:04] Rugged Cross an emblem of suffering and
[1:15:08] shame oh was on that old cross Jesus
[1:15:10] suffered and died what what how could we
[1:15:12] sing
[1:15:13] that how could you sing it as well with
[1:15:16] my
[1:15:17] soul and not feel the import of
[1:15:21] that and recognize it and so I think we
[1:15:25] ought to worship if you want if you want
[1:15:27] to help the person singing a special
[1:15:30] worship while they
[1:15:33] singing Sometimes some of these songs
[1:15:35] that you sing I see these young people
[1:15:37] really I've watched some of these young
[1:15:39] people change I've seen their attitudes
[1:15:40] change and and and how they and their
[1:15:43] faces change and how they sing and how
[1:15:45] they worship people maybe wouldn't have
[1:15:46] sung and now they sing with all of their
[1:15:48] heart to God cuz Something's Happened in
[1:15:50] their heart and it does something to me
[1:15:53] sometimes in the back room I'm back
[1:15:54] there rejo Ing and worshiping tears
[1:15:56] running down my face and crying out to
[1:15:58] God because I know where that person
[1:16:00] come from and I realize they're they're
[1:16:02] actually worshiping God they're worship
[1:16:05] I know what they've been through and
[1:16:06] they're worshiping God we got great
[1:16:07] singers in this church but it shouldn't
[1:16:09] be a performance we ought to recognize
[1:16:11] that's a that's a brother that's a
[1:16:12] sister and while they worship let me
[1:16:16] worship while they cry out to God let me
[1:16:19] cry out to
[1:16:22] God I'm not rebuking you this morning I
[1:16:25] just want to I want to see us worship
[1:16:28] because I know the good that will do to
[1:16:30] you if you worship sir I know how that
[1:16:35] worship and how praise and glorifying
[1:16:37] God fills in the cracks of a church and
[1:16:41] and welds us together and makes us one
[1:16:43] and brings unity and brings love and
[1:16:46] brings forgiveness because we bring our
[1:16:48] Focus off of our problems and we take
[1:16:50] our Focus off everything going on and we
[1:16:52] take our Focus off one another and we
[1:16:54] look at the K and say he's worthy he's
[1:16:56] still worthy even though I may not get
[1:16:58] along with everybody but he's worthy I
[1:17:00] may not have everything going in my way
[1:17:02] but he's worthy my kids might be acting
[1:17:05] oh I want every part of this church
[1:17:06] every place let the nursery be a place
[1:17:08] of worship let the back rows be a place
[1:17:11] of worship let the foyer be a place of
[1:17:13] worship every part of the church let it
[1:17:15] be a house of worship in this time that
[1:17:18] we've designated to give it to God let's
[1:17:20] give it to him with all of our heart if
[1:17:22] we're going to do it we might as well do
[1:17:24] it with all of our heart
[1:17:28] heart did your dad never tell you that
[1:17:31] if you had a father present in your life
[1:17:33] did he never tell you if you're going to
[1:17:34] do it do it with everything you
[1:17:35] got if it's worth doing it's worth doing
[1:17:39] right I say that's a that's right when
[1:17:41] it comes to the things of the Lord
[1:17:46] especially New or Old a song has to be
[1:17:48] heartfelt to be
[1:17:50] worshiped and you know you think about
[1:17:53] brother brandom's time
[1:17:55] the songs that were new then are old
[1:17:57] now songs that were old then are really
[1:17:59] old
[1:18:01] now but I heard someone say that we
[1:18:03] still sing them not because they're old
[1:18:05] but because they're good and so we love
[1:18:08] some of the old songs but only believe
[1:18:10] was a new song when brother brandham
[1:18:12] heard it so is down from his glory and
[1:18:15] wings of a
[1:18:16] dove the tune to I love him come from a
[1:18:19] Steven Foster song I don't want to burst
[1:18:22] your bubble this morning but Steven
[1:18:25] Foster was not a hyw
[1:18:27] writer the tune come from Steven
[1:18:30] Foster My Old Kentucky
[1:18:32] Home that's he wrote that one too only
[1:18:36] believe was a jazz
[1:18:41] tune down from his glory was an Italian
[1:18:43] love
[1:18:45] song Right sometimes it's how you sing
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:53] right listen and brother brand said oh
[1:18:56] he said don't that scour you out now
[1:18:58] that's something I when I think of that
[1:19:00] I see maybe I'm picturing this wrong but
[1:19:01] I see a an old uh dish pan or something
[1:19:05] you know like a Chili pot and and it's
[1:19:07] sitting there and and and and you take
[1:19:09] it and it's got all kinds of black on it
[1:19:11] and stuff and you just take a scrubbing
[1:19:12] pan you just go to work on it and you
[1:19:16] get done and it's clean that thing's
[1:19:18] been rubbed raw man it just if it could
[1:19:21] speak man you put it through it and
[1:19:23] brother brand when he gets done
[1:19:24] preaching a lot of times he'd say
[1:19:25] doesn't that scour you
[1:19:28] out don't you feel clean after hearing
[1:19:31] the
[1:19:32] word might have hurt but don't you feel
[1:19:34] clean might have pricked your conscience
[1:19:35] but don't you feel
[1:19:37] clean he said don't you love those old
[1:19:39] songs he said I'd rather have them than
[1:19:41] all any of these other kind of songs you
[1:19:42] can have them good old heartfelt song
[1:19:45] heartfelt songs oh my I feel so good and
[1:19:49] happy when I seen them just good my just
[1:19:52] feel like rejoicing now look he said if
[1:19:55] there's anything I don't like it's an
[1:19:56] overtrained voice we'll stand up and
[1:19:58] sing like they got the colic to that we
[1:20:00] hold their breath till they're black in
[1:20:01] the face they're not singing they're
[1:20:03] just making a noise what I like is a
[1:20:05] good oldfashioned heartfelt Pentecostal
[1:20:07] Born Again person singing from their
[1:20:10] heart now listen if you got a trained
[1:20:11] voice use that trained voice but don't
[1:20:14] just sing out of training sing because
[1:20:17] there's something in your
[1:20:19] heart he said if they can't carry a tune
[1:20:21] in a bucket they still got the spirit
[1:20:22] there you listen you can feel it tearing
[1:20:25] through
[1:20:27] you oh that when I sing let me sing in
[1:20:30] the spirit Paul said let it be something
[1:20:33] that when I sing that people can feel
[1:20:35] that I believe the words that I'm
[1:20:38] singing right you know what there's some
[1:20:42] songs and forgive me for this it's hard
[1:20:44] to sing Standing on the Promises sitting
[1:20:49] down
[1:20:52] right it's just the words don't don't
[1:20:54] match the
[1:20:57] actions some Sunday mornings joy
[1:20:59] unspeakable is a very difficult song to
[1:21:03] sing right because people don't feel
[1:21:05] unspeakable the fact that Joy is
[1:21:07] unspeakable sometimes on Sunday mornings
[1:21:08] is the fact people don't have any
[1:21:12] Joy but but it's he's still
[1:21:16] here he's still worthy I wonder if we
[1:21:20] could just run those lyrics to our
[1:21:21] brains a few times just just let them
[1:21:23] sit in let them settle in what what are
[1:21:26] we singing what what are we saying what
[1:21:29] are we saying when we sing songs like I
[1:21:31] will I will praise him or or I will
[1:21:34] praise the Lord something like that what
[1:21:36] how can you how can you sing I will
[1:21:38] praise the Lord are we talking about a
[1:21:40] future
[1:21:41] date are we going to do it when we get
[1:21:44] home
[1:21:46] right I know you love me come
[1:21:51] on you I will praise the Lord when
[1:21:56] he's just as worthy right now as he ever
[1:21:58] will
[1:22:02] be oh
[1:22:04] God he said now you say well I'm not a
[1:22:06] singer he said that doesn't matter Make
[1:22:08] a Joyful Noise then unto the Lord the
[1:22:11] scripture says
[1:22:12] so now it's not just singing But
[1:22:15] shouting you know shouting is a
[1:22:17] scriptural form of
[1:22:18] worship now I know some of yall don't
[1:22:21] know what shouting is but shouting is
[1:22:23] making a loud noise
[1:22:25] am right shouting is just being loud
[1:22:29] that's
[1:22:30] right well brother Ben I couldn't be
[1:22:32] loud in church because he said to be
[1:22:34] quiet in the church go look up what
[1:22:36] quiet
[1:22:37] means be still and know that I'm God
[1:22:40] doesn't mean be like this it means don't
[1:22:43] be
[1:22:46] anxious don't worry know that I'm
[1:22:50] God right but but we shouldn't do things
[1:22:53] out of order but shouting over the word
[1:22:55] is not out of
[1:22:56] order shouting even over over when we're
[1:22:59] moved by the spirit of God during music
[1:23:01] is not out of
[1:23:03] order right I'm going to show you that
[1:23:05] in a moment now listen the Bible says
[1:23:08] thus all Israel brought up the Ark of
[1:23:09] the Covenant of the Lord with with what
[1:23:12] with shouting that's another thing seems
[1:23:14] like it's drifting away in our in our
[1:23:16] age is shouting it seems like we're just
[1:23:18] worship has become very corporate but I
[1:23:21] think when God blesses you individually
[1:23:22] it shouldn't matter if everybody else is
[1:23:23] shouting or not
[1:23:25] you know it should maybe the Lord only
[1:23:26] blessed you with that song everybody
[1:23:28] else sitting there scratching their head
[1:23:29] saying what in the world but if it
[1:23:31] blesses you it blesses
[1:23:34] you and you ought to be willing to bless
[1:23:36] the Lord Worship the Lord so the they
[1:23:40] brought up the Ark of the C of the Lord
[1:23:41] with shouting with sound of the Cornet
[1:23:43] it's like a a flute or with trumpets
[1:23:46] with symbols
[1:23:48] drums
[1:23:50] basically making a noise with sultes and
[1:23:53] harps string instruments
[1:23:55] guitars imagine what it must have seemed
[1:23:58] like it comes up just a cacophony of
[1:24:00] noise and David danced with all his mind
[1:24:02] you sit there and think well brother Ben
[1:24:03] you know David brought the ark back
[1:24:05] wrong not this
[1:24:07] time I chose that scripture carefully 1
[1:24:09] Chronicles
[1:24:11] 15:28 1st Chronicles 15:28 he said he
[1:24:14] said they were making a noise with Sul
[1:24:16] trees and harps what was it it was David
[1:24:20] not the time he brought it back wrong he
[1:24:21] made a noise then too but they never
[1:24:23] consulted of the Prophet but this time
[1:24:26] he brought it back correctly and he
[1:24:28] danced in the spirit and when he did
[1:24:29] Michael despised him in her heart and
[1:24:32] God shut up her
[1:24:34] womb in Ezra 3:11 the Bible says when
[1:24:38] this is when they laid the foundation of
[1:24:40] the house of the Lord they were so happy
[1:24:42] I told you people that have been through
[1:24:43] hard times they know how to
[1:24:46] worship so why some of our elders know
[1:24:48] how to
[1:24:49] worship and just stop there for me some
[1:24:51] of our elders know how to worship
[1:24:52] because they know what it's like to go
[1:24:53] out and the and bck cotton they know
[1:24:56] what it's like to not have much
[1:24:57] schooling and they know what it's like
[1:24:58] to go out you say oh that's just Tales
[1:25:00] of yesterday but listen they got
[1:25:01] something in their heart they know they
[1:25:04] didn't come up in the era that we come
[1:25:05] up in of so much ease and comfort
[1:25:07] although we have our own issues our own
[1:25:09] problems I realize that but they come up
[1:25:11] in a different era and so the people of
[1:25:13] God back in the day Baptist shouted and
[1:25:15] will praise God and the Methodist
[1:25:17] shouted and praise God and worshiped the
[1:25:19] Lord why it was because they had had
[1:25:21] been squeezed out of them through hard
[1:25:22] times and tribulation and depression and
[1:25:24] everything else but today we got
[1:25:26] everything right at our fingertips and
[1:25:28] it seems like we can't worship him like
[1:25:29] we used to but I say let today be the
[1:25:33] day of worship don't look back to what
[1:25:34] yesterday was but let today be your best
[1:25:37] time of
[1:25:39] worship are you still with me this
[1:25:42] morning look they sang together by
[1:25:46] course I love that in praising and
[1:25:49] giving thanks to the Lord so in other
[1:25:50] words first part of the congregation
[1:25:51] would sing then another part of the
[1:25:53] congregation would sing the part of the
[1:25:55] Levites would sing and they'd sing
[1:25:57] they'd answer back there was a lot of
[1:25:58] response in the Psalms it would be one
[1:26:00] here the the leader would say one sing
[1:26:02] one verse and the people would sing the
[1:26:04] next verse and it was back and forth a
[1:26:06] response because congregational singing
[1:26:08] is congregational
[1:26:11] singing right so it's not just a
[1:26:14] performance but look and all the people
[1:26:16] shouted oh he said give thanks to the
[1:26:18] Lord because he's good for his mercy and
[1:26:19] doth forever toward Israel and all the
[1:26:21] people shouted with a great Shout when
[1:26:24] they praise the Lord because the
[1:26:26] foundation of the house of the Lord was
[1:26:28] laid you said but you could shout and
[1:26:29] not have it absolutely you could that
[1:26:32] don't mean you're saved but the people
[1:26:34] of God
[1:26:36] shout are you with me now again Psalm
[1:26:39] 32:11 be glad in the Lord and rejoice
[1:26:41] you righteous shout for Joy all ye that
[1:26:43] are upright in heart I think sometimes
[1:26:46] what keeps us from really worshiping God
[1:26:48] is condemnation but don't you realize he
[1:26:50] said all you that are upright in heart
[1:26:52] you may have done all kinds of bad
[1:26:53] things but are you forgiven is it under
[1:26:56] the blood then you ought to be able to
[1:26:57] worship like never before if anybody
[1:27:00] ought to be able to worship it ought to
[1:27:01] be the person who's been through hell
[1:27:03] and back and yet they know that God
[1:27:05] delivered them they know that God
[1:27:07] brought them out of the pit they know
[1:27:09] that what they were and they know what
[1:27:10] they are today it don't bother me you
[1:27:13] say well that person was a sinner let
[1:27:15] him praise God let her praise God they
[1:27:18] know where they come
[1:27:21] from not scandalized by that
[1:27:26] you that are upright in the heart you
[1:27:27] shout for
[1:27:29] joy and that know that your sins have
[1:27:31] been forgiven they've been placed under
[1:27:33] the blood of the
[1:27:35] Lamb you that make mistakes and are
[1:27:38] troubled and everything else but yet you
[1:27:40] know that your heart's
[1:27:43] right you
[1:27:46] shout brother BR that's what's the
[1:27:48] matter with the church today they say I
[1:27:50] don't believe in that their kind of
[1:27:51] religion makes you shout and call it
[1:27:52] heartfelt religion I don't believe in
[1:27:53] such things as that he said no wonder
[1:27:55] you've never come into it
[1:27:57] yet he said you come into it really get
[1:27:59] under the Shina glory of God when the
[1:28:01] power of the Holy Ghost is falling down
[1:28:02] upon you you don't know something
[1:28:03] happened to you you passed from death
[1:28:06] into life become a new creature God is
[1:28:08] first and I know the objection to that
[1:28:11] is many times well brother Ben is not my
[1:28:12] nature to shout I want to show you what
[1:28:15] brother random had to say about that let
[1:28:17] me say this I I know some people are
[1:28:19] quiet and and and people can be quiet
[1:28:22] I'm not quiet in church some people are
[1:28:23] very quiet in church and I get that but
[1:28:26] you know it's funny how it
[1:28:28] spreads right and and you watch people
[1:28:31] being quiet and and that's good many
[1:28:33] times there's a reason sometimes there's
[1:28:34] a purpose for being quiet sometimes we
[1:28:35] need to be quiet there's times we don't
[1:28:38] need to be running 100% we need to slow
[1:28:41] down and be in all the presence of God
[1:28:44] we need to hear the word right because
[1:28:46] it doesn't do any good if you can't hear
[1:28:48] it because it's the word that matters
[1:28:50] not the emotion that it's given in and
[1:28:52] yet we want the presence of God to be
[1:28:53] there yes sir right but but so there's
[1:28:56] times to be quiet and some people are
[1:28:57] not you know but if you
[1:29:01] shout and and what I mean by that is you
[1:29:03] get real animated at the ball game you
[1:29:07] can shout in
[1:29:09] church you just
[1:29:11] don't now let's just be real honest with
[1:29:19] ourselves you say well I can't be happy
[1:29:21] in church it's just I'm always reminded
[1:29:22] of my sin well somebody come and brought
[1:29:25] you if everybody that you knew come
[1:29:28] today and come to your house said we're
[1:29:29] going to have a day for you today your
[1:29:31] day and we're all going to bring our
[1:29:33] gifts and come in and celebrate brother
[1:29:35] Allen today we're all going to go to
[1:29:37] your house well brother Allen wouldn't
[1:29:39] be happy but most
[1:29:42] people if you all showed up at my house
[1:29:44] bearing
[1:29:46] gifts even brother Allen you know you
[1:29:48] might say well I don't want people in my
[1:29:49] house but if they all come bring in
[1:29:50] hunting gear say right
[1:29:54] right fishing poles and bows and guns
[1:29:58] and everybody come in brings their
[1:29:59] present in and says just wanted to bless
[1:30:01] you today brother Allen you know what
[1:30:03] you do so
[1:30:06] woo be a smile on your face you'd have
[1:30:09] to tell that story every time I'd see
[1:30:11] you say you wouldn't believe what
[1:30:13] happened to me everybody in my life come
[1:30:16] and brought me something oh God you know
[1:30:19] sometime we act like we don't want it I
[1:30:21] remember my 30th birthday party I told
[1:30:23] my wife no party
[1:30:24] I'm getting old I'm feeling it don't
[1:30:28] want nothing she said okay first time
[1:30:30] she's ever listened to
[1:30:32] me no that's not true at all sister
[1:30:36] Fritz will get on to me if I say that
[1:30:37] she knows that's not true sister Fritz
[1:30:40] was there with us when we were first
[1:30:41] married she knows how submissive and my
[1:30:43] wife is and what a wonderful Christian
[1:30:45] she is but I heard her say one time I'll
[1:30:47] give this Rose to my wife since it's my
[1:30:49] anniversary and I I got to spend the
[1:30:51] next few days with her but
[1:30:54] sister fris told me one time she said
[1:30:55] I've never met a a woman that fulfills
[1:30:58] that part of the scripture more than
[1:31:00] your wife does as far as being
[1:31:01] submissive and things for their husband
[1:31:03] and and supporting their husband I
[1:31:04] thought that's that's high praise and
[1:31:07] and I appreciate that I appreciate my
[1:31:08] wife that's all
[1:31:10] right I appreciate my wife but you know
[1:31:15] sometimes we act like we don't want it
[1:31:16] and I act like I didn't want that 30th
[1:31:17] birthday celebration but it did
[1:31:24] and I was at associate pastor at a
[1:31:26] church and my 30th birthday passed and I
[1:31:28] didn't get a cake and that day for
[1:31:30] whatever reason nobody called me people
[1:31:32] called me the day before or something
[1:31:34] you know nobody called me nobody
[1:31:36] contacted me I didn't look at Facebook
[1:31:40] nobody I pretty
[1:31:44] down say didn't anybody
[1:31:46] remember right and I'm the one that did
[1:31:48] it to
[1:31:50] myself right now listen if everybody
[1:31:52] brought you a gift wouldn't you be happy
[1:31:55] doesn't the psalm say forget not the
[1:31:57] Lord forget not his benefits he said he

[1:32:33] back and lived in the church and he's
[1:32:35] here this morning the king is here this
[1:32:37] morning and that ought to make every one
[1:32:39] of us happy it ought to make every one
[1:32:41] of us excited about that in whatever way
[1:32:44] we can get
[1:32:47] excited now look what brother Brandon

[1:36:03] something has to happen he said you do
[1:36:06] believe the good old time heartfelt
[1:36:08] salvation brings tears of joy and
[1:36:10] happiness peace that passes all
[1:36:13] understanding for he's the river amen oh
[1:36:16] he's my everything I just can't praising
[1:36:19] him enough and say enough about him what
[1:36:21] he means to me I wonder if that's us
[1:36:23] today this is the example that a prophet
[1:36:25] said he said it's no wonder he said it's
[1:36:27] a nature in you when you're born of the
[1:36:28] spirit of God you got a nature in you to
[1:36:30] make you scream out and he uses that
[1:36:32] Luke 19 and 40 when they recognized that
[1:36:35] what the word was being fulfilled there
[1:36:36] was something in the people they begin
[1:36:38] to cry out hosana and lay palm branches
[1:36:40] down in the way why because the King was
[1:36:43] there and he uses that scripture he
[1:36:45] answered and said to them I tell you if
[1:36:46] these should hold their peace the stones
[1:36:48] would immediately cry out amen he said
[1:36:51] something had to take place Hallelujah
[1:36:53] when we see him coming down out of
[1:36:54] Heaven riding on that white charger you
[1:36:56] talk about some noise oh there's going
[1:36:59] to be something to happen then when we
[1:37:00] see all these things we've talked about
[1:37:03] brought into
[1:37:05] reality but there's the key isn't
[1:37:08] it he was still there on the cross but
[1:37:10] they weren't
[1:37:11] shouting CU they didn't recognize him in
[1:37:14] that
[1:37:15] form they thought if he was a king he'd
[1:37:17] have taken over many of the same people
[1:37:20] who shouted the day before didn't
[1:37:21] recognize him on the cross wonder if we
[1:37:24] recognize him
[1:37:26] today I wonder what kind of attitude
[1:37:28] we'd have towards the king if we really
[1:37:32] knew that that he was here you know in
[1:37:35] Old Times all your whole life depended
[1:37:37] on the generosity of a king or a noble
[1:37:40] like everything depended on that you die
[1:37:43] without the generosity of a king he
[1:37:45] owned the woods he owned the deer he
[1:37:48] owned the the pigs he owned the Surfs he
[1:37:51] owned the land
[1:37:53] and so you were a
[1:37:55] subject and so all you can think about
[1:37:57] is how can I please the king so he'll
[1:38:00] give me what I have need of he'll
[1:38:02] provide for me do you realize that
[1:38:05] everything in this world belongs to God
[1:38:08] even Satan though he's he's taken it and
[1:38:10] perverted it he can't even create he can
[1:38:12] only pervert what God
[1:38:14] created he has the cattle on a thousand
[1:38:17] hills his word is
[1:38:20] law
[1:38:21] amen and if you recognized the king it
[1:38:24] was such a sense of awe and Majesty when
[1:38:26] a person saw their King maybe not
[1:38:29] somebody else's King but their King when
[1:38:31] they come in his presence they fell down
[1:38:33] and prostrated themselves on the ground
[1:38:35] in awe at that presence pagans would do
[1:38:38] that before an imaginary God I don't
[1:38:40] have time to get into this brother
[1:38:42] Robert I'm sorry I'm going to I'm going
[1:38:44] to skip through some of this but brother
[1:38:46] brandom talked about how that that we
[1:38:48] prostrate ourselves before the king he
[1:38:51] said and pagans would actually go and
[1:38:54] prostrate themselves before an idol that
[1:38:57] they would set up an image of what they
[1:39:00] thought God looked like and they would
[1:39:02] take that then and they would prostrate
[1:39:04] themselves before it and they would
[1:39:07] imagine in their heart anointed by the
[1:39:10] devil they would imagine that that that
[1:39:13] Idol could
[1:39:15] speak and they lay themselves down and
[1:39:18] they cry out to it
[1:39:21] speak speak to me
[1:39:24] and they thought they heard it
[1:39:26] speak because in their imagination had
[1:39:29] grown Wicked and dark and they thought
[1:39:32] that that piece of wood that they
[1:39:33] created could actually talk back but
[1:39:36] brother Brandon tells us that we don't
[1:39:39] have an imaginary Idol we have a living
[1:39:43] God how many believe that today we have
[1:39:46] a living God and a living God is before
[1:39:51] us Abraham must have seem strange to the
[1:39:53] idol worshippers Abraham was an idol
[1:39:56] worshipper but everybody built altars
[1:39:58] everybody prostrated themselves and
[1:40:00] worshiped but Abraham did it with no
[1:40:04] image right to the Unseen
[1:40:06] God right but listen what brother BR
[1:40:09] said he said Christian worship is that
[1:40:12] not that the idol speaks he said but God
[1:40:15] actually when the worshipper prostrates
[1:40:17] himself before God when you humble
[1:40:20] yourself before God when you come into
[1:40:22] His presence and you let go of all the
[1:40:25] things that are going on and you just
[1:40:26] say Lord would you come and what happens
[1:40:29] is he he don't speak to you he speaks
[1:40:32] through
[1:40:33] you oh
[1:40:35] hallelujah oh he comes he doesn't come
[1:40:38] into an idol but he comes into living
[1:40:40] human beings and speaks his own
[1:40:43] words through
[1:40:45] men are you with me now and we are his
[1:40:48] living images created in His image and
[1:40:50] for his work and for his
[1:40:52] glory oh
[1:40:54] then who should be speaking and people I
[1:40:57] know people question ask say Well only
[1:40:58] certain people have a right to speak no
[1:41:00] I think we ought to be speaking the
[1:41:02] words of God because if we're really
[1:41:04] worshiping we have to
[1:41:06] speak because it's his words in us we
[1:41:10] have to speak and you said but brother
[1:41:12] Ben that's Pentecostal to worship that's
[1:41:16] that's the the Baptists even do it now
[1:41:18] they have praise bands and worship bands
[1:41:20] worship
[1:41:21] teams but who should be
[1:41:24] worshiping what kind of worship who
[1:41:26] would God receive worship from who who
[1:41:29] would Delight his heart to worship Him
[1:41:33] brother B said there's fine people in
[1:41:35] the world fine churches but there's one
[1:41:37] Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's
[1:41:40] coming for how many believe that today
[1:41:42] that's who he's coming for that's where
[1:41:44] his name lays there is where his worship
[1:41:47] is in her and her
[1:41:51] alone oh my
[1:41:53] so he comes in churches like this think
[1:41:56] about it I don't want to make this
[1:41:57] exclusive but but we believe that the
[1:41:59] bride hears the word of the hour we've
[1:42:02] heard the word of the Hour come out of
[1:42:03] her my people and we've come together to
[1:42:05] be his wife to be his bride of no
[1:42:08] adulteration or anything of the word the
[1:42:09] pure word we've been married to Christ
[1:42:12] the word here on the earth we're going
[1:42:14] to the marriage supper brother said but
[1:42:15] we had the wedding happens here and so
[1:42:18] we've been married to Christ the word
[1:42:20] what people should worship him more than
[1:42:22] us
[1:42:24] it would be a shame if any group on the
[1:42:26] earth had more worship among them than
[1:42:28] the bride of Christ did if there was
[1:42:30] ever I'm not going to leave it I'm not
[1:42:31] content to leave it to the Pentecostals
[1:42:34] I'm not content to leave it to the to
[1:42:36] the rocks to cry out I want to worship
[1:42:38] him with with all that I've got with
[1:42:41] everything that I
[1:42:42] am
[1:42:44] Hallelujah we have a different take on
[1:42:46] worship and any other group of people on
[1:42:48] the Earth as I said because a prophet
[1:42:50] taught us that he came to turn our
[1:42:52] hearts back so we can worship from our
[1:42:55] hearts the message didn't come to turn
[1:42:58] our heads back come to turn our hearts
[1:43:02] back and and God must be worshiped Jesus
[1:43:05] says in John 423 and 24 he's a spirit
[1:43:07] and he worship Him must worship Him in
[1:43:09] spirit and in
[1:43:11] truth with Brandon preaching he said I
[1:43:13] just love to feel this way I love to
[1:43:15] worship God in quietness like this
[1:43:18] something that's got real meaning to it
[1:43:20] just to feel that something is
[1:43:24] near what what happened he said at the
[1:43:26] altar call when those Sinners accepted
[1:43:29] Christ I think about it for minut you
[1:43:31] people come to the Altar and they pray
[1:43:33] he said when those Sinners accepted
[1:43:35] Christ you don't realize all Heaven's
[1:43:36] waiting on you they're waiting on you to
[1:43:39] give in and they know you're on the
[1:43:41] schedule but they're just waiting for
[1:43:43] you to do
[1:43:44] it right so because if you're a seed of
[1:43:47] God you're gonna surrender to his
[1:43:50] will Hallelujah those sinners
[1:43:53] he said' when those Sinners accepted
[1:43:55] Christ the Angels raised up from their
[1:43:57] seats see he said that's what makes you
[1:44:00] feel this way said this is worship when
[1:44:04] the soul is worshiping God the word has
[1:44:08] gone forth see he said the holy spirit
[1:44:10] is blessing and watering now can I have
[1:44:13] just a few minutes to to do this I get
[1:44:16] five minutes from everybody I won't do
[1:44:18] that but look brother brandom is the one
[1:44:22] who taught us to worship at the end of
[1:44:24] the
[1:44:25] service I've been uh I guess I was
[1:44:28] blessed or I don't know what you'd call
[1:44:29] it I grew up going to all kinds of
[1:44:31] different churches and I've been in
[1:44:33] Baptist Churches Methodist churches
[1:44:34] Pentecostal churches uh maybe a Catholic
[1:44:37] Church I yeah I have been in a Catholic
[1:44:38] church I've been in all kinds of
[1:44:41] services everything you can
[1:44:43] imagine and in that we don't ever find
[1:44:47] worship after the service they may sing
[1:44:50] a song and they go home the worship is
[1:44:52] before
[1:44:53] brother brandom taught us we do worship
[1:44:55] before but we worship our main worship
[1:44:58] is after did you know
[1:45:00] that our main worship is after the
[1:45:03] preaching and now I'm preaching it
[1:45:06] myself maybe as preachers ought to leave
[1:45:07] more time for
[1:45:10] it but
[1:45:12] look that's unique to the message listen
[1:45:15] to how brother brandham did it he said
[1:45:17] our heavenly father is the beautiful
[1:45:19] sacred presence of the Holy Spirit now
[1:45:21] standing here blessing his children
[1:45:23] many times he's had to correct them for
[1:45:25] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:45:27] be chastened and tried received child
[1:45:29] training reproofs not no exceptions
[1:45:32] everyone but when we endure the
[1:45:34] correction of our father it yith forth
[1:45:36] the present and pleasant a pleasant
[1:45:40] fruit I pray God that you just let each
[1:45:42] child know that not go away just kind of
[1:45:45] Imagine but let them know that this is
[1:45:48] your blessings to them so the word has
[1:45:50] come he said let them know that this is
[1:45:53] your blessings to them the sincere milk
[1:45:56] of the Gospel pouring down in their soul
[1:45:59] milk and honey out of canaan's land new
[1:46:02] wine to stimulate them in faith
[1:46:05] worshiping Hearts bowed before thee
[1:46:08] hands up tears running down cheeks
[1:46:12] quietly reverently
[1:46:15] worshiping and there's a time again as I
[1:46:17] said for shouting and worship and praise
[1:46:19] and the symbols and everything else but
[1:46:22] sometimes when the word is there and
[1:46:23] it's been preached it's just a reverence
[1:46:25] to it what is it you're submitting
[1:46:27] yourself to the word what are you doing
[1:46:29] when you worship after the word comes
[1:46:30] out you're saying God I know you're
[1:46:32] right I may not be right but I know
[1:46:34] you're right I'm acknowledging the word
[1:46:35] is true I'm acknowledging you were here
[1:46:38] in your word and because you are the
[1:46:41] word I'm acknowledging that Lord and I'm
[1:46:43] saying Lord change me make me different
[1:46:46] cleanse me wash me out I Love You
[1:46:49] Lord Oh my he said oh God I'm so happy I
[1:46:53] just love you so Lord I want to express
[1:46:55] to you my feeling if I can just in
[1:46:58] Thanksgiving expressing the very
[1:47:00] Adoration of my heart that I adore thee
[1:47:02] thou matchless one I love
[1:47:05] thee you said but brother Ben you got to
[1:47:08] have a sermon on worship to worship
[1:47:09] that's not true that was in Revelation
[1:47:12] book of
[1:47:13] symbols look at the worship after the
[1:47:15] seals but the brandom wasn't working it
[1:47:18] up but it was just there because the
[1:47:20] Holy Spirit brother Stuart mentioned it
[1:47:22] the other day when you preach this
[1:47:24] message huh there's a different
[1:47:26] anointing that comes with that and the
[1:47:29] spirit of God moves sometimes in here on
[1:47:30] Wednesday night I know we're all tired
[1:47:33] but sometimes I can't hardly even leave
[1:47:34] because I know the presence of God is so
[1:47:38] real why he's honoring his
[1:47:40] word not cuz I preached it no matter who
[1:47:43] preached it he honored his
[1:47:46] word listen he said just the Holy Spirit
[1:47:48] just cleaning your heart from all
[1:47:50] unbelief putting you right back in track
[1:47:52] with God again you see the importance of
[1:47:55] that little time we have at the end of
[1:47:56] service he said oh now is the time to
[1:47:59] worship him the message is over let's
[1:48:01] just worship him once again in this song
[1:48:02] as we sing I love him and I know some of
[1:48:05] you are elders and things and you got to
[1:48:07] get up and go and you got reasons for
[1:48:09] that and I understand that and if you
[1:48:10] have to leave I I say if you have to
[1:48:12] leave early that's fine but those of us
[1:48:14] who can stay and worship just even a
[1:48:17] little bit even if it's just a minute
[1:48:18] but just long enough to tell him Lord I
[1:48:20] love you I praise you I'm I'm going to
[1:48:23] I'm going to thank you for the word I'm
[1:48:24] going to soak in it for just a
[1:48:28] minute because you're good
[1:48:32] Lord oh God see brother Ram taught us to
[1:48:35] think about what we what has been
[1:48:38] preached while we
[1:48:39] worship he said the message is over
[1:48:41] let's just worship him once again in the
[1:48:43] song He said everyone just quietly and
[1:48:45] sweetly close your eyes look with your
[1:48:47] spiritual eyes he preached about Elijah
[1:48:49] and the meal offering and he said look
[1:48:51] with your spiritual eyes towards him see
[1:48:53] what he done for that
[1:48:55] Widow if you're a widow here this
[1:48:57] morning or someone who who who doesn't
[1:48:59] have a husband to provide for you look
[1:49:01] he said see what he did for that Widow
[1:49:04] you're as dear to him as that Widow he's
[1:49:08] preserved your life too don't you love
[1:49:11] him isn't that a reason to
[1:49:14] worship amen see worship is
[1:49:18] obedience did you know that especially
[1:49:21] worship after the word cuz sometimes it
[1:49:24] is
[1:49:25] hard sometimes we hear things we don't
[1:49:27] like and that maybe we're doing
[1:49:29] something and the word speaks against
[1:49:32] that and it bothers
[1:49:34] us but then when we worship our heart
[1:49:38] begins to cleanse the word the washing
[1:49:40] of the water of the word begins to work
[1:49:42] in our life because we're acknowledging
[1:49:45] yeah I heard that but I still love you
[1:49:49] Lord I heard that and that hit me right
[1:49:52] to the own that that two-edged sword
[1:49:54] that just cut me but I still love
[1:50:00] you worship is
[1:50:03] obedience we surrender ourselves to the
[1:50:05] word in worship brother when the father
[1:50:08] finds a child that's obedient how he
[1:50:09] likes to come and say now watch He's
[1:50:12] dramatizing this as if the Holy Spirit
[1:50:14] would go to the father and we know
[1:50:15] they're the same person but he's
[1:50:17] dramatizing it the Holy Spirit you said
[1:50:19] would come to the father you see when
[1:50:21] the father finds a child that's so he
[1:50:23] likes to come and say sir your boy is a
[1:50:25] perfect child how obedient your children
[1:50:29] are now how are they obedient how they
[1:50:32] love to worship you they gather together
[1:50:37] all right all right right isn't that
[1:50:40] what we're doing is an act of
[1:50:42] obedience oh I don't want to be
[1:50:44] disobedient to the word we come together
[1:50:46] out of obedience to the word how he
[1:50:48] likes to come and say sir your boy is a
[1:50:50] perfect child how obedient your children
[1:50:52] are how they love to worship you they
[1:50:53] gather together they raise their hands
[1:50:56] the tears run down their cheeks they're
[1:50:58] just so full of joy how the Holy Spirit
[1:51:00] must love to do that for God is an
[1:51:03] object of worship and God wants to be
[1:51:04] worshiped in spirit and in truth Jesus
[1:51:06] said so but we get so starchy we just
[1:51:09] can't make a
[1:51:13] grunt he
[1:51:15] come among
[1:51:17] us what we did
[1:51:19] was what he got out of us
[1:51:25] if we did that at our kids birthday
[1:51:27] party think about it for a
[1:51:29] minute at the time you set aside for you
[1:51:32] and your wife maybe go out on a date go
[1:51:33] out to dinner you just sit there and
[1:51:36] grunt at her the reason why she's
[1:51:41] mad are you with me now you're taking
[1:51:44] texts on your phone and your other place
[1:51:46] I'm preaching to myself
[1:51:48] too these kids they know riding with me
[1:51:51] Landon's learned that if I'm I'm on the
[1:51:52] phone if I'm in the car so everybody
[1:51:55] just learns to you know if you ride with
[1:51:57] me everybody just learned that's I'm
[1:51:59] either on the phone or I'm preaching at
[1:52:00] somebody so that's just what we do you
[1:52:03] know and and we're busy but if I take
[1:52:05] that time with my wife I gotta I got to
[1:52:07] focus
[1:52:10] sometime it might as well be
[1:52:12] now we get so starchy we can't make a
[1:52:15] grunt we couldn't say Amen we just sit
[1:52:17] there he said see how the Holy Spirit
[1:52:20] must dread to say that to the
[1:52:23] father but when we are obedient and love
[1:52:26] him and praise him and give him glory
[1:52:29] how the Holy Spirit must love to bring
[1:52:32] that to him oh I want to have the kind
[1:52:34] of services I want to be the kind of
[1:52:36] worshipper that the Holy Spirit could go
[1:52:39] back and say father I was there with
[1:52:41] them in service today and they worshiped
[1:52:44] you they lifted their hands to you the
[1:52:46] tears run down their face they they
[1:52:48] loved you they didn't all Worship in the
[1:52:50] same way but each one of them their
[1:52:52] heart was in
[1:52:53] it oh my you know he'd say father you
[1:52:57] know your son's just like you oh it's
[1:52:59] just
[1:53:00] perfect and if we'd say it here in our
[1:53:01] street expression just a chip off of the
[1:53:03] block why he loves you he's
[1:53:06] obedient again brother BR said Don't You
[1:53:08] Love to Worship the messages sometimes
[1:53:10] so cutting with the word but then you
[1:53:11] know after we've all been corrected and
[1:53:13] stand Guiltless in the presence of the

[1:55:12] hallelujah you say I must skip way down
[1:55:14] brother Robert I'm
[1:55:17] sorry Matthew
[1:55:20] 18:20 tells us where two or three here
[1:55:22] gathered together my name there am I in
[1:55:23] the midst of them you say well brother
[1:55:25] Ben I don't feel
[1:55:27] anything when I feel it I'll worship you
[1:55:29] know that's not how we
[1:55:31] worship do you know that he's
[1:55:35] here now he promised in his word that he
[1:55:38] was here and we had a prophet who stood
[1:55:40] up and said this is my Ministry to
[1:55:42] declare him that he is
[1:55:46] here to say he's
[1:55:48] here and and brother BR says this he's
[1:55:51] talking about Mary when the angel come
[1:55:53] to her he said this he said just start
[1:55:55] thinking about him and worship him in
[1:55:58] your heart and all of a sudden you'll
[1:56:01] feel the close Fellowship of the holy
[1:56:04] spirit all around you and it gets so
[1:56:07] anointed till you can't hold it any
[1:56:09] longer you'll raise up your hands or do
[1:56:12] something you just can't stand still
[1:56:16] when it
[1:56:17] comes see what what a worship this was
[1:56:20] as we come back to our text
[1:56:22] what a worship this was when they all
[1:56:24] fell down before the lamb said listen
[1:56:26] what a worship this was the elders the
[1:56:28] Beast everything fell right before him
[1:56:30] he said see like that when he made his
[1:56:32] complete plan it's time of worship now
[1:56:36] who should worship us when should we
[1:56:39] worship
[1:56:40] now brother Brown said the the first of
[1:56:42] the 14th verse of the fifth chapter of
[1:56:44] Revelation reveals the time for the lamb
[1:56:46] to be worshiped both in heaven and in
[1:56:48] Earth the seven seal book The worthy
[1:56:50] lamb the Kidman Redeemer and from the 8
[1:56:52] verse to the 14th Angels worship Him
[1:56:54] Elders worship Him living creatures
[1:56:56] worship Him and John worshiped him now
[1:57:00] brother brandham it's not real a parent
[1:57:02] from the scripture but brother Bram
[1:57:03] pulls that out and he turns it around
[1:57:05] and play on words he says that I I John
[1:57:08] heard I John he said John worshiped he
[1:57:12] said tell everything I heard him he said
[1:57:14] and John worshiped him so much every
[1:57:15] creature in heaven and the Earth
[1:57:16] underneath the Earth heard me saying
[1:57:17] blessings Glory power wisdom might be to
[1:57:19] the lamb who was John a type of the
[1:57:21] Bride
[1:57:22] during this worship time who was
[1:57:24] worshiping the elders were worshiping
[1:57:26] the four beasts were worshiping the the
[1:57:28] the powers were worshiping the Angels
[1:57:30] were worshiping but now the bride was
[1:57:33] worshiping Hallelujah he said it's the
[1:57:35] worship time for the king
[1:57:38] lamb oh my now look he said now the
[1:57:41] church is gone remember it's showing
[1:57:42] what's happening in heaven but think
[1:57:43] about there will be a time of worship in
[1:57:47] heaven in fact it'll be
[1:57:49] forever you realize that's all will
[1:57:53] for eternity is worship in whatever way
[1:57:55] that that plays out I don't
[1:57:57] know but it's worship time for the king
[1:58:01] lamb you say well after the church is
[1:58:03] gone and the church age is
[1:58:07] over what is this bride time I don't
[1:58:11] mean I know we're still in leosa I
[1:58:12] realize that but this is the bride
[1:58:15] part right this is us for us it's bride
[1:58:19] time this was a great time of worship
[1:58:22] Worship in the heaven it's also a great
[1:58:25] time of worship here on the earth see
[1:58:28] worship is in order in the house of God
[1:58:31] how many realize that brother Brandon
[1:58:33] when he set the church in order he said
[1:58:35] course somebody worshiping the Lord
[1:58:36] that's expected that's what it should be
[1:58:40] that's what you're here
[1:58:41] for just if you feel like praising God
[1:58:44] or shouting just go right on cuz that's
[1:58:46] what you're here for see but is to
[1:58:48] Worship the Lord in your own way of
[1:58:50] worshiping see this is a temporary place
[1:58:52] of worship musicians go ahead and come
[1:58:54] I'm almost done this is a temporary
[1:58:56] place of worship the B said this little
[1:58:58] Tabernacle along with the temple that
[1:59:00] Solomon built him along with the others
[1:59:02] are only temporary places of worship
[1:59:05] until the time comes when the real
[1:59:07] Tabernacle will be set upon the Earth he
[1:59:08] said well I wish I could have been there
[1:59:10] during that time when brother Brandon
[1:59:11] was speaking and and bringing the seals
[1:59:13] what a worship that that was well I wish
[1:59:15] I could have been there too but God
[1:59:17] didn't choose for me to worship him
[1:59:18] there he chose for me to worship him
[1:59:20] here not in that tab but in this
[1:59:23] Tabernacle in Word of Life Tabernacle in
[1:59:25] Ben prits Tabernacle this Tabernacle of
[1:59:30] Flesh and you say well won't it be a
[1:59:32] time when we get up there and I think of
[1:59:34] that song but the jewel used to sing it
[1:59:36] he said won't it be a time walking with
[1:59:39] the angels and as brother juel I've
[1:59:41] watched our precious brother juel as
[1:59:42] he's gotten older and had difficulties
[1:59:44] in his body and I'm thinking one day
[1:59:46] there he'll have his strength again to
[1:59:47] be able to sing won't it be a time that
[1:59:50] song has more meaning than it ever did
[1:59:52] I think some of you as you get older you
[1:59:54] begin to realize it has more meaning
[1:59:55] than it ever did won't it be a time but
[1:59:57] brother Bram tells us not to wait till
[1:59:59] that time he said let us purpose in our
[2:00:01] heart today while we have our strength
[2:00:04] while we have our voice let us purpose
[2:00:06] in our heart today that in commemoration
[2:00:08] and waiting for that Tabernacle to come
[2:00:10] that we will so characterize oursel by
[2:00:12] his Spirit we will worship in this
[2:00:16] place this place as if we were in that
[2:00:19] other place waiting for that place to
[2:00:24] come sir what did they sing when they
[2:00:28] worshiped they saying thou are worthy
[2:00:31] sing a new song they could only sing th
[2:00:34] are worthy in other words you know
[2:00:37] worthy means you deserve
[2:00:38] [Music]
[2:00:41] it I want to ask you is he less worthy
[2:00:45] today than he was in John's time
[2:00:53] is he less
[2:00:54] Worthy is he less
[2:00:56] deserving than he was in 1963 when the
[2:00:59] seals were open I don't believe he
[2:01:02] is if anything he's just unfolded
[2:01:05] himself
[2:01:06] more he just revealed himself
[2:01:10] more is he less worthy because we're the
[2:01:12] bride I would think us being the bride
[2:01:15] to be that much more
[2:01:17] worthy CU he's our husband our our
[2:01:20] leader our creator Our God our
[2:01:24] King he's
[2:01:26] here we've been taught that by a prophet
[2:01:30] we've been told that by the scriptures
[2:01:32] we've been taught that from the word and
[2:01:34] we know it because we we sense his
[2:01:37] presence God allows us to feel him you
[2:01:39] believe that brother BR said a man that
[2:01:41] believes God can feel God and know that
[2:01:43] he's there we we know that he's here
[2:01:46] there's something different about the
[2:01:47] service he's here in our midst and he
[2:01:49] promised to be here then if he's here
[2:01:52] he's
[2:01:53] worthy is he less worthy because the
[2:01:55] trouble we're going
[2:01:57] through we need to challenge ourselves
[2:02:00] sometimes is he less worthy because
[2:02:02] we're struggling no he's
[2:02:05] worthy he's worthy he worthy as he ever
[2:02:08] was ever will be so if he's worthy and
[2:02:12] he's here let me worship him from my
[2:02:15] heart with all my heart with everything
[2:02:19] that I have could we do that today
[2:02:22] let's just let's just practice a little
[2:02:26] bit as if he was
[2:02:29] here you just think about it you close
[2:02:31] your eyes and think about it as if he
[2:02:33] was
[2:02:34] here cuz he is and if you have a need
[2:02:37] today and you come with a need the altar
[2:02:39] is open we'll be glad to pray with you
[2:02:41] that's a part of
[2:02:43] worship we love to pray with
[2:02:46] you this is where we're not here to
[2:02:48] judge you we this where you find help
[2:02:52] he said why an altar well because many
[2:02:54] times it takes that because you got to
[2:02:56] humble yourself God can meet you where
[2:02:57] you're at but many times it takes a
[2:02:59] humility in our lives to bring us before
[2:03:03] him is he worthy today just imagine as
[2:03:07] if he was
[2:03:09] here he is here but can you make
[2:03:12] yourself believe
[2:03:14] it can can you really make yourself
[2:03:16] believe it can you say Lord I I know it
[2:03:18] I know it I know your word is true I I
[2:03:21] recogn that you're here you come in a
[2:03:23] prophet and showed us that you were here
[2:03:25] but not you didn't stop there you're
[2:03:26] here today the same yesterday today and
[2:03:30] forever and if he's here I'm going to
[2:03:33] Worship You Lord Heavenly Father Lord
[2:03:37] Jesus I want to worship you today with
[2:03:38] all of my
[2:03:40] heart Lord I pray that the children
[2:03:42] would worship you as I saw even a a
[2:03:45] young child last night a little baby
[2:03:47] that had seen people in church raise
[2:03:49] their hands or was something when you
[2:03:50] heard the music begin to go he began to
[2:03:52] raise his hands and worship I said oh
[2:03:55] God he may not even realize what he's
[2:03:56] doing but you receive that even from the
[2:04:00] heart of a baby if he could recognize
[2:04:02] the presence of God oh how about
[2:04:04] us what about us
