[40:43] both services on Sunday. And then on
[40:46] Monday, would y'all be praying for me?
[40:48] I've got uh, uh, some dental work being
[40:50] done. And I've got uh to have my wisdom
[40:52] teeth cut out. So, I'm going to have
[40:54] even less wisdom than I do now, I guess.
[40:56] But
[40:58] we're uh going to have that done. I've
[41:00] needed to have that done for about 10
[41:01] years, so I put it off. And but we're
[41:04] going to have that done Monday. And then
[41:06] I'm hoping to be able to travel by
[41:08] Thursday cuz we'll be going to Brother
[41:10] Wendell Martins. The meetings up there.
[41:12] Those start on Thursday. I If anybody
[41:14] wants to go, let me know. I'll help you
[41:17] get there and help you get a room. If
[41:19] you want to go to the meetings, we'd
[41:20] sure they support us so well. So, I know
[41:24] Brother Joel's going too, but he'll come
[41:25] back for Sunday for that Sunday. Brother
[41:28] Stewart will be with us as well. But,
[41:30] uh, they've been good friends to us. So,
[41:32] we want to help them and support that
[41:34] meeting all that we can. And then
[41:36] hopefully by the next week, I'll be all
[41:38] healed up and back with you. So, we'll
[41:40] just see how that goes. But, I
[41:42] appreciate your prayers. Thank you so
[41:43] much for being here on a Wednesday
[41:45] night. Did you come to hear something
[41:47] from the Lord? I know we all got needs
[41:50] and they're real needs. They're things
[41:52] that we really need from God. And and
[41:56] you know, it's not about who's
[41:57] preaching, but Lord, direct that
[42:00] preacher to speak something that would
[42:02] speak directly to my heart. And and I've
[42:05] seen it. I I've seen the Lord do it so
[42:07] many times when I was in need that the
[42:09] speaker the preacher would just preach
[42:10] something directly to my need. And and I
[42:14] just pray the Lord would do that
[42:15] tonight. I got needs just like you do
[42:18] and I want to see God speak to those
[42:20] tonight and you move brother Joel out of
[42:21] the way and just speak to us. Amen. How
[42:24] we going to pull on the word tonight.
[42:26] Amen. Let's do that. Let's uh let's sing
[42:29] that u worthy of it all. Let's just sing
[42:32] this for a moment. Worship the Lord as
[42:34] brother Joel comes.
[42:36] Oh, you're worthy of it all.
[42:42] Oh, do you believe he is tonight?
[42:44] You are worthy of it all.
[42:48] [Music]
[42:52] For from you are all things.
[42:56] To you are all things.
[43:00] You deserve the glory.
[43:05] Sing it now. You are worthy.
[43:09] Could
[43:12] we just lift our hands to him and sing
[43:13] it now? You are worthy of it all.
[43:22] Oh, for from you are all things
[43:27] and to you are all things.
[43:31] You deserve the glory.
[43:37] Oh, you are worthy of it all,
[43:45] Lord. You are worthy of it all.
[43:51] [Applause]
[43:53] For from you are all things,
[43:57] and to you are all things.
[44:01] You deserve glory.
[44:05] One more time now. Oh, you are worthy of
[44:10] it all,
[44:15] Lord. You are worthy of it all.
[44:24] For from you are all things
[44:28] and to you are all things.
[44:32] They deserve
[44:34] glory.
[44:38] Amen. Aren't you thankful to be able to
[44:40] serve a God who is worthy of it all?
[44:43] Amen. I wonder if we could just bow our
[44:44] heads for a moment in a word of prayer.
[44:46] If you have a special need on your
[44:48] heart, just make it known by no lifted
[44:49] hand if you would. Heavenly Father, as
[44:52] we approach your throne of grace this
[44:53] evening, Lord, we want to say thank you,
[44:56] Lord, for the opportunity to be able to
[44:58] stand here and call you father.
[45:00] Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord,
[45:02] for the opportunity to humble ourselves
[45:04] and and come together in fellowship, not
[45:06] looking at one another and and status,
[45:09] but Lord, we're looking at one another
[45:10] through the eyes of grace and mercy that
[45:13] you've given each one of us to be able
[45:14] to stand here tonight. Lord, I ask you
[45:17] would move me out of the way, Lord, so I
[45:18] wouldn't speak anything that would be
[45:20] unlike you or displeasing to you. Lord,
[45:23] I ask for every person in the building
[45:24] here tonight, Lord. Open their ears,
[45:26] Lord, to hear what you would have for
[45:27] them, Lord. Lord, not what a man would
[45:29] have to say, but Lord, something that
[45:31] would be directly from the throne, Lord,
[45:33] just walk down the aisles tonight, Lord,
[45:35] and let the word be the discerner in the
[45:37] building and to move upon every need we
[45:39] pray. In Jesus name we ask. Amen.
[45:43] And are you happy to be in church on a
[45:45] Wednesday night? Amen. If you have your
[45:47] Bibles, uh if we could, let's turn to
[45:49] Genesis chapter 1. Genesis chapter 1 and
[45:53] verse, uh verse 26. Genesis 1 and verse
[45:57] 26. If I if I could title this tonight,
[46:00] it would be reflecting the image of
[46:02] Christ. And we would just like to speak
[46:04] on that as uh for just a moment here
[46:07] this evening. Amen. Genesis chapter 1
[46:11] and verse 26. Say amen if you have it.
[46:15] Amen. And God said, "Let us make man in
[46:18] our image, and after our likeness, and
[46:21] let them have dominion over the fish of
[46:23] the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
[46:25] and over the cattle, and over all the
[46:27] earth, and over every creeping thing
[46:30] that creepeth upon the earth." So God
[46:32] created man in his own image, in the
[46:34] image of God created he him, male and
[46:38] female created he them. You may be
[46:40] seated. May the Lord add his blessings
[46:42] to the word. And if you uh could go with
[46:44] me over to Philippians uh chapter 2.
[46:48] Philippians chapter 2 and verse uh and
[46:50] verse 5. Philippians 2 and verse 5. Just
[46:54] to lay a background here this evening.
[46:56] You love the Lord tonight. Amen.
[46:59] Philippians chapter 2
[47:02] and verse 5. 5-7. There. Let this mind
[47:06] be in you which was also in Christ
[47:08] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[47:11] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[47:13] God, but made himself of no reputation,
[47:16] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[47:19] and was made in the likeness of men. And
[47:23] that'll be all the reading there for
[47:24] now. But I want to just draw your
[47:26] attention uh to something that a prophet
[47:29] would say. He said all the things of
[47:31] shadows and types. When God made the
[47:33] heavens and the earth, he made the moon
[47:34] to shine. In the absence of the sun to
[47:37] give light while the sun was gone. See a
[47:40] beautiful type of Christ in the church.
[47:42] The church is the moon to give the light
[47:45] to the world while the sun is gone. So
[47:48] in the absence of Christ, I mean the
[47:50] moon, the moon is giving light. But he
[47:53] said the moon was not the the moon was
[47:56] not Christ. It was not the light, but it
[47:58] was a reflection of the light. And so
[48:01] the light was the sun. The light was the
[48:03] son of God. The light was was Christ
[48:05] made flesh to us. Amen. He was the
[48:07] totality of light. He was everything
[48:09] that God was was expressed. Amen.
[48:12] Through Jesus. And so there was no there
[48:15] it wasn't just part of God, but it was
[48:17] the fullness of the Godhead. We all know
[48:18] that as believers here tonight. Amen. So
[48:21] so the moon would be a type of the bride
[48:23] and it would actually just be a
[48:24] reflection. Now the moon I if the sun
[48:27] refused to give its light then the moon
[48:29] would have no light. And so if we don't
[48:31] have the spirit of Christ on the inside
[48:33] of us it is impossible for us to shed
[48:36] the light of Christ in our lives. And so
[48:39] we've got to have the sunlight in order
[48:41] to reflect the life of Christ. Are you
[48:43] with me so far here tonight? Brother
[48:45] Brandon would go on like this. He said
[48:46] now he said see what I mean a lesser
[48:48] light. He said otherwise the moon and
[48:50] the sun is husband and wife as Christ in
[48:52] the church is husband and wife. The wife
[48:54] being the weaker vessel only gives a a
[48:57] smaller light in the absence of her
[48:59] husband. And the church can only make
[49:01] manifestations of the Holy Spirit. So
[49:05] the the when when you do something that
[49:07] is let's say you lay your hands on the
[49:09] sick and they're healed or or you even
[49:11] maybe you prophesy or you speak with
[49:12] tongues. Amen. That is not something
[49:14] that you can do on your own but it has
[49:16] to be a reflection of a work that has
[49:19] happened on the inside of you. Are you
[49:21] with me tonight? Amen. So, so everything
[49:23] we do, whether we preach and and Paul
[49:25] would say, if I preach, I preach in the
[49:27] spirit. If I if I sing, I sing in the
[49:29] spirit. Amen. All these things that we
[49:31] do must be a reflection of Jesus Christ.
[49:36] Can you say amen? Amen. So, brother
[49:37] Brand would go on like this. He said,
[49:38] "When you see the moonlight, it's not
[49:40] the moonlight. It's the reflection of
[49:42] the sunlight." Amen. So, when you see a
[49:45] brother or sister and you say, "Amen,
[49:46] that's that's the life of Christ that
[49:48] you can see in them." Amen. That it's
[49:50] not brother Herald that you see. Amen.
[49:52] But it is Christ expressed through a son
[49:54] of God. Amen. That has been born again.
[49:57] Come on church. Amen. When you can
[49:59] actually express the living God through
[50:01] you, it is not an expression of you.
[50:04] Amen. David White. It is not an
[50:06] expression of David White. Amen. But it
[50:08] is an expression of Christ revealed by
[50:11] the Holy Ghost. Can the church say amen?
[50:13] Amen. So we go just a little farther
[50:14] here. He said it's a reflection of the
[50:16] sunlight. And Christ ascended up. He
[50:18] said, is that right? and shines his
[50:20] light on the church to reflect his light
[50:23] and power to the world in his absence.
[50:25] He said, "You see what I mean?" Amen.
[50:27] That's why we are the body of Christ in
[50:29] the absence of the literal body of Jesus
[50:32] Christ. A prophet would teach us that.
[50:34] He said, "Now," he said, "Now we in his
[50:35] absence, we are the only we only we are
[50:38] the only body that there is of Christ."
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the only voice that there
[50:41] is of Christ. We are the only being of
[50:44] Christ on the earth today. It is a many
[50:46] membered body projecting the very life
[50:49] that Christ had when he was here on
[50:51] earth. And so, brother Brandon would go
[50:53] on like this and he he tells a story. He
[50:55] said some even some of the evenings when
[50:57] the children are asleep. He said, "Mrs.
[50:59] Brandham," and I slip into the room and
[51:00] look at little Joseph and I look at him
[51:02] and he's laying there sleeping and I
[51:03] say, "Mama, you know he's got big eyes
[51:05] just like yours." And he and she said,
[51:07] "Yes, he's got your he's got lips like
[51:09] yours." And he said, "It's the features
[51:11] of both of us that's represented in that
[51:14] child." He said, "Oh, that God wants to
[51:17] see the reflection of himself and his
[51:20] church reflecting the power and the
[51:22] glory to the world." Amen. How are we
[51:24] going to reflect anything to a dark age
[51:26] that we're living in, unless it be by
[51:28] the living word and the the living
[51:30] Christ that is here, amen, restored to
[51:32] us in this hour. Amen. That's why a
[51:35] Christian can call themselves a
[51:36] Christian and and they can mess up and
[51:38] make mistakes and we all do that. Amen.
[51:40] But what but when you call yourself a
[51:42] Christian and you never pray and you
[51:44] never go to church and and you never
[51:46] live for God and you you don't have any
[51:48] actions that Christ had. Amen. Then
[51:50] you're not reflecting what Christ was.
[51:52] Amen. So people will they look at your
[51:54] testimony and and they may say, "Well, I
[51:56] I just don't see Christ in you." Listen,
[51:59] you are the only Bible this world some
[52:01] of them will ever read. Amen. We've got
[52:03] to reflect what God has done in us. And
[52:06] so brother Brandon went like this. He
[52:08] said, "Now in the Old Testament when the
[52:09] beers was beating gold," he said, "When
[52:11] you get gold that's full of pyite," and
[52:12] I love how brother Brandham tells us how
[52:14] to become a reflection of Jesus Christ.
[52:16] And he said, he said, "When you get," he
[52:18] said, "that gold that's full of pyite,
[52:20] fool's gold." He said, "It really shines
[52:22] better than the real gold, but it's got
[52:23] sludge and everything in it." But the
[52:25] beater used to beat the gold, real gold.
[52:27] And he said he knowed, he had all the
[52:29] dirt out of it, and he seen the
[52:30] reflection of himself in it like a
[52:32] polished mirror. And man, it was beat
[52:34] and and he beat it until he seen his own
[52:36] reflection. And I do wonder sometimes if
[52:38] we go through a trial and we're
[52:40] complaining about the trial, but it's
[52:42] the master reflecting himself in us.
[52:45] Amen. We can look and say, "I I don't
[52:47] think I can make it or I don't think I
[52:48] can overcome this trial." Amen. But it's
[52:50] God letting you go through something so
[52:52] that he can be revealed in the midst of
[52:54] the trial.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he looks at you, Amen. How
[52:57] many believe you're the gold of God here
[52:59] tonight? Amen. You are you you are the
[53:01] very gold. Listen. Listen, you are the
[53:03] you're the cream of the crop. You're the
[53:05] You're the greatest thing that there is
[53:06] on the earth. You're the You're the only
[53:08] thing keeping the rapture or or the
[53:09] world being blown up. You're you are the
[53:12] bride. You are the ones that God has
[53:13] chosen to put his name in. That ought to
[53:15] make somebody happy here on a Wednesday
[53:17] night. Amen. Because you have been
[53:19] chosen and elected and forained to be in
[53:22] the position that you're in. But I want
[53:23] you to know you're going to go through a
[53:25] trial because he wants to see himself in
[53:27] you.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And so when when you go through
[53:30] something, remember, amen, it's a trial.
[53:33] Amen. every every son and every daughter
[53:35] that would come to God must be first be
[53:38] tested and tried. Why? Because when he's
[53:40] looking at you, he wants to see himself,
[53:43] Sister Janie. He wants to see himself in
[53:45] you. Amen. It's Christ in you, but he
[53:47] wants to be able to see the reflection
[53:50] coming back to him. And so, Brother
[53:52] Brandon would go on like this. He said,
[53:53] "That's what the Holy Spirit is trying
[53:55] to do to the church." He said, "Is to
[53:58] beat it and turn it over and beat it
[54:00] until Christ reflects in the church to
[54:02] the people." It wasn't to reflect to the
[54:05] necessarily just everybody, but to the
[54:07] people that need to see Christ, you are
[54:10] the reflection of Jesus Christ. And and
[54:12] so brother going like this. He said he
[54:14] said Christ reflects the church to the
[54:16] people proving his resurrection. So
[54:18] without without a reflection, then there
[54:22] there's no proof of a resurrection.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; So if there was no if there's no living
[54:28] God today, then how can we prove that he
[54:30] ever raised 2,000 years ago? Amen. But
[54:32] we know he lives. Why? Because he lives
[54:35] in me and he lives in you. Amen. And so
[54:38] even when you're cold on God, if you've
[54:40] ever received the baptism of the Holy
[54:42] Ghost, you are sealed until the day of
[54:44] your redemption. And there'll be
[54:45] something on the inside of you. Amen. If
[54:48] you backslide on God or you get cold on
[54:50] God, amen, and you are one of God's.
[54:52] Amen. You might go through you might go
[54:54] through all kinds of troubles. And that
[54:55] don't mean you're lost. Amen. That's not
[54:57] even a sign of God's disapproval. Amen.
[54:59] But he knows you're his and he wants to
[55:01] make sure he can bring you back. Amen.
[55:03] As a reflection of him. Can the church
[55:05] say amen? Amen. He's trying to get the
[55:07] people. He wants to beat the world out
[55:09] of them. And the devil's pouring it in.
[55:10] And the Holy Spirit, if you'll just
[55:12] stand still and let him, he will beat
[55:14] your life until the loving peace of
[55:16] Christ reflects into your life. I say,
[55:18] "Amen." And let me be the loving peace
[55:21] that Christ reflects. Amen. I don't want
[55:23] to be Listen, you know, we all carry a
[55:25] nature and we're we're a three-fold
[55:27] being. and and every one of us, you've
[55:29] got a sticky nature. And then you've got
[55:30] a you've got a soul that that's where
[55:32] the spirit of Christ would live if
[55:33] you've received the Holy Ghost. And and
[55:35] many times your spirit that you carry I
[55:38] is subject to whatever whatever diet
[55:41] you're on. Amen. So your spirit many
[55:43] times if you're not careful, Amen. If
[55:45] you get to if you get to feeding the
[55:47] outward man more and more, then that's
[55:49] what you become and your spirit and and
[55:52] things becomes like that man, like the
[55:54] sticky nature. Amen. But if you'll feed
[55:56] on the word of God and you'll give God
[55:58] the time of day, amen, then God can
[56:00] raise up a spirit in you, amen, that can
[56:02] fight every devil that comes against
[56:04] you. Can the church say amen? And
[56:06] brother Brandon would go on like this.
[56:07] He said in that day Jesus said when the
[56:09] son of man is being revealed, not men,
[56:11] the son of man, not an organization, the
[56:13] son of man, the word living itself again
[56:16] among the people. He said the word
[56:18] itself is made flesh in you. You are a
[56:21] reflection of this hour, the message. So
[56:24] if the message has come into you, you
[56:26] are going to reflect the message that
[56:28] you've heard.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You say, "Well, I I'm
[56:32] not where I want to be." No, none of us
[56:33] are where we want to be. But aren't you
[56:35] thankful for what the message has done
[56:36] to us so far? Amen. And he that began a
[56:39] good work in you'll finish what he
[56:41] started. You say, "Well, well, I fall
[56:43] every day." Yeah, you're going to fall
[56:45] some more. Amen. Don't be looking at
[56:46] your failings. Don't be looking at at
[56:48] your backslidings. But I want you to
[56:49] look at Calvary and look at what he did.
[56:51] Because when he died, it wasn't just a
[56:53] man that died. Amen. It wasn't just a
[56:55] man that went into the ground. Amen. But
[56:57] it was the very spirit of God in that
[56:59] man. Amen. And when he ascended up on
[57:00] high, he gave that spirit to you. Amen.
[57:03] So that you could be a reflection of the
[57:06] very same body that was here on earth.
[57:08] Let the church say amen. Amen. What we
[57:10] need to know tonight, it's it's not our
[57:12] per it's not our perfection. It's it's
[57:14] not my body. It's not it's not you. It's
[57:17] not that mortality that you live in.
[57:19] Amen. But what you have is a spirit that
[57:21] is an eternal being on the inside of
[57:24] you. Amen. That's why death don't scare
[57:25] us. Amen. That's why that's why
[57:28] principalities and e evil spirits and
[57:30] and demons that would come around. None
[57:31] of these things really scare the bride
[57:33] of Christ because we know who we have
[57:35] believed in. Amen. He is more than able
[57:38] to raise up a bride in this last day.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; He's more than able. Amen. He's not
[57:42] going to let his bride fall in the end
[57:44] time. Can you say amen? How many
[57:47] believes your bride here tonight? Amen.
[57:48] You are the elected. You are the called.
[57:50] Then you cannot fall. You're going to
[57:53] reflect the image of Christ. Can we go a
[57:56] little bit farther here tonight? Brother
[57:58] Brandon, we're going like this. He said,
[57:59] he said, "You got it?" He said, "Enoch
[58:01] was God's perfect reflector in type."
[58:04] And when God was through with him, he
[58:06] just translated him and took him up. And
[58:08] I want you to notice there Enoch was a
[58:10] perfect he was a perfect type. He was a
[58:12] a reflector type. Amen. And he was and
[58:14] God was in him and and he walked so
[58:16] perfectly before God. Amen. that God
[58:18] actually would take him and translate
[58:20] him where he would not taste death. But
[58:22] I want you to notice something that that
[58:24] it wasn't Enoch's flesh that saved
[58:26] Enoch. And I want you to notice now that
[58:29] if you're a type of Enoch in this day
[58:31] and you don't taste death, it's not
[58:32] because of how good brother Matthew was.
[58:34] And it wasn't because of how good so and
[58:37] so in the church is. Amen. But it's got
[58:39] to be a life on the inside. Amen. That
[58:41] brings about a resurrection, brings
[58:43] about a body change. Amen. You say,
[58:45] "Well, if I could just walk like Enoch,
[58:47] you can in the eyes of God."
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't do it on your own, but
[58:51] you can with the spirit of God on the
[58:54] inside of you. Amen. So, he said, I love
[58:56] this part here. He said when God was
[58:58] through him, he just translated and took
[58:59] him up. He said the mechanics that he
[59:01] had reflected and became dynamics with
[59:04] the spirit and took him up. Amen. So, he
[59:06] had the word on the inside of him. Amen.
[59:09] And then it was the spirit that came in
[59:10] there. And anytime you get the spirit
[59:12] and the word together, amen, good things
[59:14] are going to happen. I believe this is
[59:16] an anointed word. How many believes
[59:18] that? Amen. I don't believe this message
[59:20] is a dead letter. I don't believe there
[59:21] is any any deadness about this message.
[59:23] I believe it is an anointed word given
[59:25] to an anointed bride that was ordained
[59:27] to overcome in this hour. Amen. But if
[59:29] you're not careful, you let the devil
[59:31] tell you, "Well, I don't want to hear
[59:32] the tapes because they're they're dead."
[59:33] And no, there's nothing dead about the
[59:35] tapes. There's nothing dead about this
[59:37] message. Amen. What the devil's done to
[59:39] you is he's made it common to you so you
[59:41] don't want to listen to it no more.
[59:43] Amen. You don't want to you don't want
[59:44] to hear the message anymore. But I want
[59:46] you to know that if you can get the
[59:47] mechanics of the message and you can get
[59:49] the word on the inside. Amen. And then
[59:51] get the spirit on the inside. Amen. That
[59:53] will that will bring about the dynamics
[59:55] of the word to you. Amen. Then it will
[59:57] give you quickening power. Amen. It's
[59:59] not just a power that raised Jesus, but
[1:00:01] it's the same power that will take this
[1:00:04] bride in a rapture.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, Amen. And I believe
[1:00:07] this is the stuff. When I get to listen
[1:00:09] to these things, I I I think of it like
[1:00:10] this. Amen. There's no way I can make
[1:00:12] this rapture on my own, Brother David.
[1:00:14] Amen. There's no way, brother Bill, you
[1:00:15] can make this rapture on your own. Amen.
[1:00:17] But there's got to be something on the
[1:00:18] inside of you that is calling come up
[1:00:20] higher. Amen. It's not you saying that
[1:00:22] I'm going to make it. I'm going to make
[1:00:23] it. No, that's faith speaking from the
[1:00:25] heart. Amen. That's faith speaking that
[1:00:27] I I'm not going down with Leodysia. Are
[1:00:29] you hearing me here tonight? I'm not
[1:00:31] going down in the tribulation. I'm not
[1:00:33] going to be here when the when the bombs
[1:00:34] are flying and the ashes are all around
[1:00:36] me. No, I'm not going to be here. Amen.
[1:00:38] But I will be changed in the moment, in
[1:00:40] the twinkling of an eye. Amen. We will
[1:00:42] be caught up to meet our Lord on the air
[1:00:44] because it's not about your goodness and
[1:00:45] it's not about who you are, but it is a
[1:00:48] reflection of Christ in you. Amen. And
[1:00:50] Christ in you is the hope of glory.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Is it? Are you still with me here
[1:00:55] tonight? Amen. Brother Random would say
[1:00:57] it like this. And he said now he said
[1:00:59] that he said uh he said even Elijah he
[1:01:01] said he had that he said he had that
[1:01:02] even to his bones were were the
[1:01:04] reflection of God in his body being made
[1:01:06] manifest the word of God they laid a
[1:01:08] dead man on it and he sparked it to life
[1:01:09] again. I I want you to notice that the
[1:01:11] power of God is not a strange thing to
[1:01:14] us but it is a strange thing to the
[1:01:16] world because when the power of God
[1:01:18] moves upon somebody it can take somebody
[1:01:20] who's been dead in t sin and trespasses
[1:01:22] and it can raise them to the newness of
[1:01:25] life. How many's experienced the grace
[1:01:27] of God? Amen. When the power of God
[1:01:28] comes in the room and it's changed your
[1:01:30] soul. Amen. Come on, church. You know
[1:01:32] the same power that has made you a
[1:01:34] Christian is the same power that's going
[1:01:36] to take you out of here. Amen. It's the
[1:01:38] same power, Brother Danny. The same
[1:01:40] power that's held you in this message
[1:01:42] for 50 or 60 years is the same power
[1:01:45] that's going to take you in a rapture.
[1:01:47] You say, "Well, where is the power?" I
[1:01:49] mean, the power is already in you. Amen.
[1:01:51] And it's going it is reflecting itself
[1:01:54] by the very fact that you're here
[1:01:55] tonight.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And it is a powerful it is a powerful
[1:02:00] thing that a person can live as a
[1:02:02] Christian in this hour. It is a powerful
[1:02:04] thing that you can overcome Leodysia.
[1:02:06] It's a powerful thing. Amen. That the
[1:02:08] spirit of the age and the and the
[1:02:10] coldness of this age and and the
[1:02:12] lukewarmness of this age, it is a
[1:02:14] powerful thing that it has not taken you
[1:02:16] out. Amen. The fact that you're here
[1:02:18] tells me that Christ is being reflected
[1:02:21] in a body of believers here tonight. You
[1:02:23] say, "Well, Brother Joel, what about
[1:02:25] when I fall? What about when I when I
[1:02:27] feel like I don't even want to serve God
[1:02:28] anymore?" I tell you what you do if
[1:02:30] you're a good man. You get right back up
[1:02:32] and keep trying. Amen. And I I tell you
[1:02:34] what, it don't matter how many times you
[1:02:35] get cold on God. It don't matter how
[1:02:37] many times you say you drag yourself to
[1:02:39] church. And it don't matter how many
[1:02:41] times you you think you're you just
[1:02:43] think you're lost. But I want you to put
[1:02:44] that thing out of your mind and keep a
[1:02:46] positive testimony. Amen. Because I
[1:02:48] believe that you are the ones that were
[1:02:50] called to be the elected of this hour.
[1:02:53] Amen. Why I'm about to throw these like
[1:02:56] window. They keep falling out. I'm going
[1:02:58] to tell you something. What we what we
[1:03:00] need tonight, Amen, is to realize who we
[1:03:02] are.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And if the power is in you, Amen. Why do
[1:03:06] we fear anything? Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:03:09] the power raised Jesus. We can testify
[1:03:11] to it." Amen. But what where is that
[1:03:12] power today? Amen. It is it is in the
[1:03:16] mystical body of Jesus Christ. Amen. It
[1:03:19] is in you, the bride of Jesus Christ. I
[1:03:22] I hope you're still with me here
[1:03:23] tonight. Brother Brandon would say it
[1:03:24] like this. He said Jesus Christ was the
[1:03:26] person. He said he was man and God. He
[1:03:28] said he was the manifestation of God. He
[1:03:31] was God in a body form to reflect the
[1:03:33] word of God for that age to make that
[1:03:36] age see God's promise for that age. And
[1:03:38] so the Holy Ghost is the same thing
[1:03:40] today. He said, "It's the spirit of God
[1:03:42] upon the written word trying to find
[1:03:44] somebody to reflect itself to in this
[1:03:47] age."
[1:03:49] I hope you heard me on that here
[1:03:50] tonight. Amen. Do you realize what he's
[1:03:52] saying? That the same power that was on
[1:03:55] Christ is on you today. Amen. To reflect
[1:03:58] itself again in this age.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That ought to make somebody say, "Amen."
[1:04:03] Amen. In St. John 14:12, he said, "The
[1:04:05] works that I do shall you also." Now,
[1:04:07] you cannot do those on your own, but you
[1:04:10] can do those by his power.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Amen. He said, he
[1:04:15] he said, now notice, he said, then you
[1:04:17] are a son of God in the house of God.
[1:04:20] You are a part of God's economy. Amen.
[1:04:22] And then in Romans 8:1, he said, then
[1:04:24] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:04:26] to them which are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:04:28] For brother Brandon would pick that up
[1:04:30] and he said, for for they are dead to
[1:04:32] the world, but they are alive in him.
[1:04:34] How many's alive in him here tonight?
[1:04:36] and living in this present day, making
[1:04:38] the word that God has used them or for
[1:04:41] ordained them to, placing their names in
[1:04:44] this bride book, and when the waters
[1:04:46] come upon that seed that's in the heart,
[1:04:48] it raises it up to the bride of Christ.
[1:04:50] He said, "Oh my, just as perfect as it
[1:04:52] can be in every age, it's been that
[1:04:54] way." Lutheran's under justification,
[1:04:56] the feet raised it like that. Wesley
[1:04:58] under sanctification, the Pentecostals
[1:05:00] under the arms and the works and the
[1:05:01] deeds and so forth. Had to be legalist,
[1:05:03] he said. But now we come to the head,
[1:05:05] the capstone. And the headstone is
[1:05:07] crying what? Grace. Grace. It's passed
[1:05:10] from death and create into the living
[1:05:11] word of the living God. Amen. Somebody
[1:05:13] say amen. He said God's only provided
[1:05:16] plan for his age. His sons in the word
[1:05:18] age, quickened by the spirit like a
[1:05:20] spark that's lit off of something to
[1:05:22] make it alive. And he said, "Seated now
[1:05:25] in heavenly places." We've heard about
[1:05:26] that recently. Where are we now? We're
[1:05:28] seated in heavenly places. We're not
[1:05:30] We're not going to be, but we are now.
[1:05:32] We are now sons and daughters of God. If
[1:05:34] you ever were, then you always were.
[1:05:36] Listen, if you ever if God thought you
[1:05:38] were a son of God in the beginning, you
[1:05:39] were in the mind of God, then you've
[1:05:41] always been a son or daughter of God.
[1:05:43] Amen. You might have went through all
[1:05:44] kinds of things to get here. Amen. But
[1:05:46] God knew who you were and he knew where
[1:05:48] you'd be here tonight. Can you say amen,
[1:05:51] brother? Go on like this. He said,
[1:05:52] "Now," he said, "then what does that do?
[1:05:54] You being a part of God's gene, a part
[1:05:56] of the word, other men a part of God's
[1:05:58] word seated together manifest the entire
[1:06:01] body of Christ because there's no leaven
[1:06:04] among you.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Brother Joel, how can we
[1:06:08] be in that in that in that place? And
[1:06:10] how can we how can we have no levan
[1:06:11] among us and we can't even agree on
[1:06:13] nothing?" Well, I tell you what it is.
[1:06:14] Amen. But it's not because it's not
[1:06:16] about the human thinking. Amen. I want
[1:06:18] you to notice what we read there in the
[1:06:20] beginning. We have to put off this mind.
[1:06:22] Amen. We we we we actually we actually
[1:06:24] do away we we lose our mind that we have
[1:06:27] because this mind this this the mental
[1:06:29] capacity that we have as a human being I
[1:06:31] mean is enmity with God. I mean it will
[1:06:33] never think right do right unless there
[1:06:35] is a a control tower called the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost on the inside of you and that will
[1:06:40] change the way you think. Are you still
[1:06:42] with me? Amen. So so in your own mind
[1:06:45] then you're never going to make it. In
[1:06:47] your own flesh you're never going to
[1:06:49] make it. In your own self you're never
[1:06:51] going to make it. Amen. That's surely a
[1:06:53] a gloomy place to live. Amen. But in
[1:06:55] Christ, all the promises are in Christ.
[1:06:58] Amen. All the all the word that Christ
[1:07:00] brought. Amen. That is calling us to
[1:07:02] live higher. Amen. Not because we can
[1:07:05] live higher, but because he lives, I can
[1:07:08] live also.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of what he did then that
[1:07:12] then I know that what he did, it was a
[1:07:14] finished work at Calvary. Are you still
[1:07:16] with me here tonight? Amen. We we can't
[1:07:18] be lost and we we can't go down because
[1:07:20] just as sure as he went down and came up
[1:07:22] then if you go oh come on somebody. If
[1:07:25] you go by way of the grave then you're
[1:07:26] sure to come up. Amen. In the
[1:07:28] resurrection. Why? Because the
[1:07:30] quickening power is on the inside of
[1:07:32] you. Amen. It don't matter if death
[1:07:34] takes you out. Amen. It don't matter if
[1:07:35] a if if a car wreck took you or a plane
[1:07:37] took you. It don't matter if a bullet
[1:07:39] took you. It don't matter what takes you
[1:07:41] off of this earth. But you will come up.
[1:07:43] Why? Because the gene seed of God is on
[1:07:45] the inside. And when the light struck
[1:07:47] the seed, amen, it reflected the very
[1:07:49] power of Jesus Christ. Again, I hope
[1:07:53] you're still with me. When I when I was
[1:07:54] listening to this sermons here and I was
[1:07:56] studying on this and it excited me to
[1:07:59] know that I can't make it on my own
[1:08:01] marriage, but he wasn't looking at me.
[1:08:03] Amen. When he put the blood over me, I
[1:08:05] mean, he wasn't looking at my sins and
[1:08:06] my past mistakes. He wasn't looking at
[1:08:08] the fact that that I made up like Joel
[1:08:10] Puit and and the sticky nature is there.
[1:08:13] But he was looking past all those things
[1:08:15] because he saw a gene seed of God in me.
[1:08:18] Amen. I It don't matter what your last
[1:08:20] name is. It don't matter what family you
[1:08:22] came from. Amen. I don't care if you're
[1:08:23] from the best family in the church or
[1:08:25] the worst family in the church. Or maybe
[1:08:27] you've got a a family with an ill
[1:08:29] reputation. But I want to tell you here
[1:08:30] tonight, amen, the blood of Jesus puts
[1:08:32] every one of us on the same level. Amen.
[1:08:35] I don't care how talented you are. I
[1:08:37] don't care how how big you think you are
[1:08:39] or how little you think you are. Amen.
[1:08:41] God has put every one of us under the
[1:08:42] same blood. Amen. With the same power.
[1:08:45] Well, can you say amen? Amen. God didn't
[1:08:47] take a person that's a gifted person and
[1:08:49] elevate them above and put them in
[1:08:51] another power range. Amen. He didn't put
[1:08:53] somebody up here and say, "I've given
[1:08:55] them power." No. To them, he gave the
[1:08:57] power to you. He gave the power. Amen.
[1:09:01] To to the sons and daughters of God,
[1:09:03] amen, that are reflecting Christ on the
[1:09:05] earth now. To you, he has given power
[1:09:08] and authority.
[1:09:10] Can you say amen? Amen. Our authority
[1:09:12] does not come but what by what we want
[1:09:15] but our authority comes from the power
[1:09:17] that is within us.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:09:20] He said he said no leaven among you.
[1:09:21] Just the word only seated in heavenly
[1:09:23] places in the door where he put his name
[1:09:26] Christ Jesus. No leaven among you. That
[1:09:28] brings the entire fullness of the
[1:09:30] godhead bodily among you. Couldn't do it
[1:09:32] in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in
[1:09:33] Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the
[1:09:34] Pentecostal age. But in the day when the
[1:09:37] son of man will be manifested, revealed,
[1:09:39] brought back the church together with
[1:09:41] the entire deity of God amongst his
[1:09:44] people. I want to just go ahead and say
[1:09:46] this. When people try to put deity in a
[1:09:48] prophet, Amen. I'll go with you there,
[1:09:49] but go ahead and put the same deity in
[1:09:51] the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. I'll go
[1:09:54] with you and say God was in that man,
[1:09:55] but go ahead and don't just leave it in
[1:09:57] a prophet, but put it in the bride.
[1:09:59] Amen. Because I know God was in the man.
[1:10:01] Amen. I know he was filled with the Holy
[1:10:03] Ghost and and he stood there and
[1:10:05] submitted himself to God. Amen. But what
[1:10:07] about you and me tonight? What about us?
[1:10:09] Amen. Just because you failed don't mean
[1:10:11] you're not part of God. Amen. Just
[1:10:12] because you came from a bad background
[1:10:14] does not mean you're not part of God.
[1:10:16] Can you say amen? Amen. God has called
[1:10:18] you from the path that you came from for
[1:10:21] a specific purpose. Mean you had to come
[1:10:24] through that trial in order to see the
[1:10:27] reflection of God, brother Gabe, in your
[1:10:29] life. Amen. So every trial you've been
[1:10:31] through was just another hammer beating
[1:10:33] that gold and it was just to to reflect
[1:10:35] Christ in you. Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:10:37] well, when's it going to be done beating
[1:10:39] me?" Well, let me go and tell you
[1:10:40] something. A lot of us still have a lot
[1:10:42] of work to be done. Amen. So, if you're
[1:10:44] going through a trial tomorrow, you say,
[1:10:45] "Brother Joel, why am I going through a
[1:10:47] trial? I feel like I'm filled with the
[1:10:48] Holy Ghost." That's when he begins to
[1:10:50] work on you.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; He ain't working on those who have never
[1:10:53] accepted him. Amen. Maybe they're going
[1:10:55] through trials and he's allowing things
[1:10:57] to happen to bring them to him. But I
[1:10:58] want you to know that a Christian that
[1:11:00] comes to him, that's when you're first
[1:11:02] tested and tried.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why did it get harder
[1:11:06] when I became a Christian?" Because it
[1:11:08] does. Because you're no longer just
[1:11:10] living willy-nilly for the world, but
[1:11:13] you're actually living w with something
[1:11:16] changing you. And there's a force on the
[1:11:19] inside that is fighting with the force
[1:11:21] of the world. So, you're in a battle.
[1:11:23] And the battle is not yours, but the
[1:11:25] Lord. So, I want you to notice. Amen.
[1:11:27] But when you receive the Holy Ghost, you
[1:11:29] immediately go into action in a war. And
[1:11:32] it is a war on the inside. And and I'm
[1:11:34] not going to get too deep into this
[1:11:36] because last time I did, I said
[1:11:37] something that was very famous. And so
[1:11:39] so I'll stay away from it. And I said it
[1:11:41] just all wrong. And so some of you know
[1:11:43] where I'm at, but I I'll stay off of
[1:11:45] that part of the quote. But whatever you
[1:11:47] do, so if you're if you're sitting there
[1:11:49] and you're constantly going and you're
[1:11:51] feeding after the television and you're
[1:11:54] always watching the TV and and maybe
[1:11:56] you're watching the news and you say,
[1:11:57] "Well, there's nothing wrong with it."
[1:11:58] I'm not saying there's anything wrong
[1:11:59] with it. But what I'm saying is, are you
[1:12:01] giving God his time in order for that
[1:12:04] spirit to have to to be fed enough to
[1:12:06] fight and overcome the spirit of the
[1:12:09] world that you're living in? Listen, I
[1:12:11] if you're giving the world 40 hours a
[1:12:13] week, that's fine because you have to do
[1:12:15] it to work and live. Amen. If you're
[1:12:16] giving the world, Amen. all your time
[1:12:18] and your sports and all these things.
[1:12:20] Amen. That's that's okay. Amen. But
[1:12:22] don't forget to give God his time
[1:12:24] because there's a spirit on there that
[1:12:26] is going to war for you. Can you say
[1:12:28] amen? And we need to fight with
[1:12:30] everything we've got because there's
[1:12:31] this is an end time. This is a place
[1:12:33] where where God has chosen you. Amen. To
[1:12:36] rise up in this time and recognize who
[1:12:39] you are. know the power that's within
[1:12:41] you. Amen. You can't be lost. But why
[1:12:43] would I want to be a quitter in the army
[1:12:45] of God, but I want to go down fighting
[1:12:47] every tooth and nail. Amen. To know that
[1:12:49] God has given me the power. If God has
[1:12:51] given me the power to fight, amen, then
[1:12:53] don't let no devil from hell try to take
[1:12:55] me out of this army. Come on, church.
[1:12:57] Listen. What I want to tell you tonight,
[1:12:59] amen, you were ordained for this army.
[1:13:01] You were ordained for this fight. Amen.
[1:13:03] You're reflecting the very image of
[1:13:05] Christ. I want you to know this tonight.
[1:13:07] Amen. that every time the devil looks at
[1:13:09] you and he realizes that you're a son
[1:13:11] and daughter of God. Amen. He knows you
[1:13:13] can't be lost, but it is his job to go
[1:13:16] after you and try to make you make every
[1:13:18] decision you can that's wrong. Amen.
[1:13:20] He's after your children. He's after
[1:13:21] your families. He's after your
[1:13:23] marriages. Come on, somebody. Amen. He's
[1:13:25] after everything that God has given you.
[1:13:28] Amen. Because he knows he can't get you,
[1:13:30] but he wants to be a stumbling block
[1:13:32] along the way. Amen. But the one thing
[1:13:34] he wants you to do is when you stumble,
[1:13:36] he wants you to stay down. Amen. But I
[1:13:38] believe there's a group of people here
[1:13:39] tonight. Amen. You fell down, but you
[1:13:42] didn't stay down. Amen. You You backed
[1:13:44] down a little bit one time. Amen. But
[1:13:46] you realized who you were. And there was
[1:13:47] something on the inside of you. Amen.
[1:13:49] That rose up and said, "I am more than
[1:13:52] able to overcome in the hour that I live
[1:13:54] in." I want you to know tonight. Amen. I
[1:13:56] don't care what kind of a gloomy
[1:13:58] spirit's on you on a Wednesday night.
[1:14:00] Greater is he that is in you. Greater is
[1:14:03] the reflection on you. Amen. Than every
[1:14:05] cloud that would try to black the Come
[1:14:06] on, church. Amen. When you see the moon
[1:14:08] and the clouds are are going over the
[1:14:10] moon, I want you to know the moon is
[1:14:12] still there because the sun is shining
[1:14:14] somewhere. And if the sun is shining,
[1:14:17] there's a reflection somewhere to shine
[1:14:19] back to him. I I wish somebody preached
[1:14:21] with me here tonight. Amen. I feel good
[1:14:23] in the house of God because if you Amen.
[1:14:26] If you are the moon and if if the if the
[1:14:28] sun is shining, listen, the sun doesn't
[1:14:30] quit shining just because it's dark
[1:14:31] outside. It's shining somewhere. Amen.
[1:14:34] Just because the dark of night, brother
[1:14:36] Danny, in the in the middle of the
[1:14:37] night, there's still a sun up somewhere.
[1:14:39] Amen. I I tell you, you travel around
[1:14:41] the world, you'll see that sometimes you
[1:14:42] can travel with the sun and it's just
[1:14:44] always light. But I want you to notice
[1:14:46] in the darkest of times, there is a moon
[1:14:49] that is reflecting the very life of
[1:14:50] Jesus Christ. Amen. So, so if the sun is
[1:14:54] there and the moon is there, don't let
[1:14:56] the gloomy clouds of life get in your
[1:14:59] way. Amen. Because on the other side of
[1:15:01] the cloud, there is a light that's still
[1:15:03] shining. On the other side of the trial,
[1:15:06] there's still a moon giving light. Come
[1:15:08] on, somebody. Amen. I tell you, if
[1:15:10] you'll ever get yourself to see, Amen.
[1:15:13] All we see in front of us from an
[1:15:14] earthly view, I mean, we see the clouds
[1:15:16] and say there's not a star in the sky.
[1:15:18] Amen. We say there's there's not a moon
[1:15:20] to give life. But the truth is, there's
[1:15:22] still a moon there giving light. And
[1:15:24] there's still every star that was ever
[1:15:25] there. And there's still the sun that
[1:15:27] was there in the first thing in the
[1:15:28] morning. The same sun that came up and
[1:15:30] and set in the west is the same son
[1:15:33] that's still given light here tonight.
[1:15:34] And the very same son that walked the
[1:15:37] shores of Galilee and gave light for 33
[1:15:39] years on the earth is the same one that
[1:15:42] is in the bride here tonight. I want you
[1:15:44] to know something here tonight. Amen.
[1:15:45] We've got enough gloom and doom
[1:15:47] preaching going on. I want you to know
[1:15:48] who you are and you were called for a
[1:15:50] purpose. And so when you make a mistake,
[1:15:52] don't look at the mistake, but look at
[1:15:54] the light that's shining through you.
[1:15:55] Brother Bill, I know in your life you
[1:15:57] can look back and say, "I wish I'd have
[1:15:58] done this and I wish I'd have done
[1:16:00] that." Amen. But you're still here and
[1:16:01] you're still fighting the greatest
[1:16:03] battle that's ever been fought. Come on,
[1:16:04] church. You say, "Well, the mind battles
[1:16:06] will leave when I'm an old person." No,
[1:16:08] they don't leave because of your age.
[1:16:09] And no doubt, when I've talked to the
[1:16:11] elders before, I mean, the devil's
[1:16:13] fighting them over something. You
[1:16:14] realize you're going to fight that devil
[1:16:15] till the day you die, but you might as
[1:16:17] well go ahead and say, "Devil, I know
[1:16:19] who you're fighting. You're fighting the
[1:16:21] You're fighting this flesh man, and
[1:16:22] you're trying to make me fall. And you
[1:16:24] might even get me down once in a while.
[1:16:26] You might make me feel blue once in a
[1:16:28] while, but I will rise up because the
[1:16:30] sun is coming up in the morning. And
[1:16:33] when the sun comes up, it will wipe away
[1:16:35] every tear." Come on, church. Amen. He
[1:16:37] will wipe all the tears away from your
[1:16:40] eyes. Amen. There. Listen, church. You
[1:16:42] know, you can weep for the night, but
[1:16:44] joy comes in the morning. Amen. The sun
[1:16:46] is still going to come up. Are you with
[1:16:48] me? You realize where we're talking
[1:16:50] about here tonight. We're not just
[1:16:51] talking about the natural. Amen. But
[1:16:53] when you go through a valley of the
[1:16:55] shadow of death, I want you to notice
[1:16:56] what a prophet would say. He said, "It
[1:16:58] wasn't death. It was just a shadow of
[1:17:00] death." Amen. So, when you go through
[1:17:02] that valley of the shadow of death, you
[1:17:04] don't fear any evil because you know the
[1:17:07] sunlight was there all the time. Are you
[1:17:10] still with me tonight? Amen. God didn't
[1:17:12] put you in the valley. Amen. Just so he
[1:17:14] could put you in the valley. But he
[1:17:16] allowed you to walk through that valley
[1:17:17] just so you knew when you came out on
[1:17:19] the other side that you've never walked
[1:17:21] alone. Amen. You'll never be alone. He
[1:17:23] said, "I will never leave you. I will
[1:17:25] never forsake you. I believe the
[1:17:26] comforter has come here tonight." Amen.
[1:17:28] If you've received the comforter in your
[1:17:30] heart, the Holy Ghost is here. Amen. And
[1:17:32] if you're in a gloomy place in your life
[1:17:34] or if the devil's tried to get you down,
[1:17:36] I say break out of those chains here on
[1:17:38] a Wednesday night and say, "God, I'm
[1:17:39] going to give victory in the house of
[1:17:41] God." Amen. I'm going to get my children
[1:17:43] back in the house of God. I'm going to
[1:17:45] claim everything that the devil has
[1:17:47] stole from me. Why? Because the devil
[1:17:49] has got no legal right on you. Amen.
[1:17:51] Because I am a reflection of the very
[1:17:53] son that is going to come up tomorrow. I
[1:17:55] want you to know that when God called
[1:17:57] you, Amen. He didn't call you to lose
[1:17:59] you. Can you say, "Amen." I love the
[1:18:01] song. He didn't teach you to swim to let
[1:18:02] you drown. Amen. He didn't talk. Come
[1:18:04] on, church. He didn't build a home for
[1:18:06] you just to lose you. Amen. But he's
[1:18:08] built a home prepared for you.
[1:18:10] Especially, Brother Bill. It's got your
[1:18:11] last name on the mailbox. And he's
[1:18:13] called you for that home in the sky. And
[1:18:15] he didn't build it just to take it away
[1:18:17] from you and say, "Look what you might
[1:18:19] get." No, he he sent a prophet there,
[1:18:21] Brother Bill. Amen. With a preview. And
[1:18:24] no doubt he saw, Amen. every one of them
[1:18:26] there, many of them people too, they
[1:18:28] said, "We're resting on the fact that
[1:18:30] you're teaching what Paul taught." And I
[1:18:32] want you to know that I'm resting on the
[1:18:34] same fact that he taught what Paul
[1:18:36] taught. And I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:18:37] that the message that is in the bride
[1:18:39] has woke this bride up. You're not
[1:18:41] looking for a new revival. You are the
[1:18:44] revival.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; You are the revival. Are you still with
[1:18:47] me here tonight? Amen. God didn't call
[1:18:50] you, Amen, to be a gloomy people. He
[1:18:52] called you to be an overcoming people.
[1:18:54] Yes. Yes, you're going to get down, but
[1:18:56] you don't have to stay there. Yes,
[1:18:58] you're going to have the Monday blues,
[1:19:00] but you don't have to live in Monday
[1:19:01] forever.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Yes, you're going
[1:19:06] to get sick.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, you're going to get sick, but we
[1:19:09] have a healer. Yes, you're going to go
[1:19:11] through trials in your marriage. Amen.
[1:19:13] But we have somebody who takes the the
[1:19:15] the the the things that are so messed
[1:19:17] up, and he takes the broken things and
[1:19:19] puts them back together again. He takes
[1:19:21] the families that have crumbled and he
[1:19:23] sees your faith and he brings the
[1:19:25] children back again. I tell you, we
[1:19:26] serve a mighty God. The church ought to
[1:19:28] say, "Man, we serve a great big God."
[1:19:31] Amen. He is not the God of of confusion.
[1:19:33] Amen. He's not the author of confusion.
[1:19:36] But when he put this when the sun came
[1:19:37] up, there was a moon to reflect it. And
[1:19:39] when the sun went down on the earth and
[1:19:41] came back up, amen, there was a bride
[1:19:43] that would reflect that same God. I want
[1:19:45] you to know here tonight, if Jesus is
[1:19:47] real, then there is someone reflecting
[1:19:49] his spirit. And I believe it's the bride
[1:19:51] of Jesus Christ, amen, that has ate the
[1:19:54] book and what is on the inside of you,
[1:19:56] amen, is reflecting what Christ is and
[1:20:00] he is the word.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say like this. He
[1:20:04] said, he said, "Now the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:05] here on earth looking at those
[1:20:07] individuals." Are you still with me here
[1:20:08] tonight? And I don't have a lot of time
[1:20:10] left, but let me finish this. And before
[1:20:12] we go, he said, "Now the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:13] here on earth looking out those
[1:20:14] individuals that God has ordained to
[1:20:16] life in this age. And as soon as it
[1:20:18] finds it, it does just like it did on
[1:20:20] Jesus Christ, the great super son of God
[1:20:22] who redeemed us all. It comes down and
[1:20:24] takes its place of abode into the human
[1:20:26] life." He said, "Now notice, it brought
[1:20:27] the quickening power." Now, the
[1:20:29] quickening power that come upon Jesus
[1:20:30] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:20:32] of the word of that day. He said, "So
[1:20:35] does the Holy Spirit that come upon us
[1:20:37] in this day." It's not a mockery, Holy
[1:20:39] Spirit. If it's not the devil mocking
[1:20:41] the Holy Spirit, but is the real true
[1:20:43] Holy Spirit, it'll manifest the promise
[1:20:46] of this hour.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the word's going to
[1:20:51] man someone's going to manifest the word
[1:20:53] of this hour?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Then I believe it's going to be us.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Because in this day, we have seen the
[1:20:58] revealing of the son of man again. We
[1:21:01] have seen what Christ did in the
[1:21:03] beginning. And if he did it then and he
[1:21:05] did it again in our day, amen, that just
[1:21:08] as the disciples would go into all the
[1:21:10] world and preach the gospel and lay
[1:21:11] hands on the sick, amen, so can we by
[1:21:14] the same power and the same authority. I
[1:21:17] want you to notice something. This is
[1:21:18] where the denominations have missed it
[1:21:20] so greatly is they taken the they'll
[1:21:22] take Jesus and say, "Yeah, some of them
[1:21:24] will say, "Yeah, he's God and and his
[1:21:26] spirit went down. You know, his spirit
[1:21:27] came back on the day of Pentecost and
[1:21:29] and his disciples would go and do all
[1:21:31] the great works and all the greater
[1:21:32] works and things and they'll put
[1:21:33] everything in the disciples. But what
[1:21:35] they failed to see is it wasn't just
[1:21:37] limited to 12 men. Amen. But it was li
[1:21:40] but it was actually given to every son
[1:21:42] or daughter of God. Amen. So you're not
[1:21:44] just a I don't know how to say this any
[1:21:46] better. Amen. Brother David, you're not
[1:21:48] just a you're not just a a molecule.
[1:21:49] You're not just a you're not just dirt
[1:21:51] and ash. That's that's that's what the
[1:21:53] body is. That's what that's what the
[1:21:54] that's what the human being is. is he's
[1:21:56] just a he's just part of the the dust of
[1:21:58] the earth and and you'll go back to
[1:22:00] that. The body is going to go back to
[1:22:01] that. Your great hair and everything is
[1:22:02] going to go right back to that. Amen.
[1:22:04] But on the other side, there is a body
[1:22:06] that is waiting for you that was already
[1:22:08] prepared by God. And that body, come on,
[1:22:11] somebody. Amen. When he put the spirit
[1:22:13] of Christ in you, he already had your
[1:22:15] name. Well, I wish somebody preached
[1:22:16] with me here tonight. I mean, he saw
[1:22:18] your name on the book. He chose to put
[1:22:19] his spirit in you. Amen. And and I want
[1:22:22] you to know this in closing here
[1:22:24] tonight. Amen. When God placed his
[1:22:26] spirit in you, he didn't put it in you
[1:22:28] just to take it away. Amen. But but what
[1:22:30] he told us was his in his word was
[1:22:32] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you
[1:22:34] are sealed until the day of your
[1:22:36] redemption. Amen. So I would say in this
[1:22:38] day the challenge is don't grieve the
[1:22:40] spirit of God when he's in the room.
[1:22:42] Amen. I know you're going to fall. Amen.
[1:22:44] But get right back up and say, "Lord,
[1:22:46] prepare me to be at the sanctuary."
[1:22:47] Amen. Put your life back on the inside
[1:22:49] of me. Amen. I am not going to go down
[1:22:52] because I've grieved you one time, but
[1:22:54] I'll come back into fellowship with God.
[1:22:56] Amen. I'll repent of my sins and come
[1:22:58] back and say, Lord, renew the Holy
[1:23:00] Spirit within me. Amen. Give me a
[1:23:02] refilling after refilling of the Holy
[1:23:04] Ghost. Come on, church. One filling is
[1:23:07] good, but that's not enough.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Where'd you where you going
[1:23:11] with this?" I want to get to this before
[1:23:13] I close. I want I want you to know this.
[1:23:15] I mean, you can be filled with the Holy
[1:23:16] Ghost. Amen. But you've got to have
[1:23:18] refilling after refilling. Amen. because
[1:23:20] the Holy Ghost will come on a man. Amen.
[1:23:22] And sure enough, you're going to go
[1:23:23] through all kinds of battles and you're
[1:23:25] going to go through the war and you're
[1:23:26] going to get beat up and po and tore
[1:23:28] down and you're going to get so tired in
[1:23:30] the heat of the battle. Amen. But all
[1:23:32] you got to do is come back to the
[1:23:33] fountain. Amen. The fountain that is
[1:23:35] always flowing. Amen. The fountain
[1:23:37] that's always given forth life. Amen. It
[1:23:39] will come upon you, Brother Bill. And it
[1:23:40] has it has watered you all these years
[1:23:43] over and over. And when sometimes on a
[1:23:45] Wednesday night, he can bring his
[1:23:47] presence in and he can raise you back up
[1:23:49] and say, "You know what? I came here
[1:23:51] gloomy, but I'm leaving rejoicing. I
[1:23:53] came here with the devil on my trail."
[1:23:56] Amen. But God has given me the victory
[1:23:58] here in the service tonight. I wish
[1:24:00] somebody had testify with me. Anybody
[1:24:02] had a bad day this week? Amen. Anybody
[1:24:04] had a bad day this year? I want you to
[1:24:06] know you don't have to keep having bad
[1:24:07] day after bad day. Amen. Because you are
[1:24:09] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ. You are an overcomer. You are
[1:24:14] more than enough. Because it's not you.
[1:24:17] When you look in the mirror, you say,
[1:24:18] "Are you enough?" No, he's not enough.
[1:24:20] But the God that's in you that is
[1:24:22] reflecting in you, he is enough.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the very Holy Ghost that's
[1:24:27] on the inside of you. Brother Brandon
[1:24:28] would say this and and then then and I
[1:24:31] will close at some point here. He said,
[1:24:33] "And so is the new birth." Go right here
[1:24:36] and start this one. He said, "This is a
[1:24:37] mixed audience, but I'm going to say
[1:24:38] something really. What is a birth?" Are
[1:24:40] you still with me here tonight? He said,
[1:24:42] 'I'm going to say something. What is a
[1:24:43] birth? If a birth happens on a a straw
[1:24:45] tick or if it happens on the floor in a
[1:24:46] hospital that the rooms are decorated in
[1:24:48] pink silk, he said, ' It's a mess any
[1:24:51] way you take it. That's right. He said,
[1:24:52] and so is the new birth. It's a mess any
[1:24:54] way you take it, but it produces life.
[1:24:57] So, if you're wanting the life of Christ
[1:24:58] on the inside of you to help you
[1:25:00] overcome, then I would say get the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost. Amen. I I I I believe in teaching
[1:25:04] and I believe all these other things,
[1:25:06] but I do believe that the biggest thing
[1:25:07] missing in among our ranks is the Holy
[1:25:09] Ghost and the people.
[1:25:13] And many people I say probably have it,
[1:25:15] but I think you need a refilling of it.
[1:25:18] And that goes for me, too. I I don't
[1:25:19] want to point just the fingers at you.
[1:25:21] Amen. But I need a refilling of the Holy
[1:25:22] Ghost. Every one of us need a refilling
[1:25:24] of the Holy Ghost. You say, "Well, how
[1:25:27] do I know who I am?" I I want you to
[1:25:28] know something. When you get a new
[1:25:30] birth, then you start taking on
[1:25:31] characteristics of your father. Amen.
[1:25:34] When brother Brandham could look at
[1:25:35] Joseph and say, "You know what? He's got
[1:25:37] he's got your he's got mama's eyes." and
[1:25:39] and and and Ma would say, "Well, he's
[1:25:41] got your lips." And and there was
[1:25:42] features of Brother Joseph that look
[1:25:44] like the parents, but I want you to know
[1:25:46] tonight. Amen. I'm not trying to look
[1:25:47] like my natural daddy, but I'm trying to
[1:25:49] look like my spiritual daddy. Amen. I
[1:25:51] believe that he has called me. Amen.
[1:25:53] When he put his spirit in me, Amen.
[1:25:55] There may be some rough edges he's still
[1:25:56] beating off of me. There may be some
[1:25:58] rough edges he's still beating off of
[1:26:00] you. But I do know that if you've been
[1:26:02] called and chosen to be the bride of
[1:26:04] Jesus Christ, then none of these things
[1:26:06] are going to take you out. Amen. No
[1:26:08] trial is going to take you out, but it
[1:26:09] is for your good.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Brother Ram would say
[1:26:13] like this. He said, he said, "It
[1:26:14] produces life." What kind of life?
[1:26:15] Servant life. To humble yourself, to
[1:26:18] deny yourself. That's the kind of life.
[1:26:20] Oh, you say, "But I' I've seen them cry
[1:26:22] and boo around the altar and carry on."
[1:26:23] Sure, they're being born. It's a mess. I
[1:26:26] don't care where you go. You young
[1:26:27] people, I hope you hear this tonight.
[1:26:28] Amen. It ain't wrong to be at an altar
[1:26:30] boohooing and crying because that mess
[1:26:32] right there may be where you're born
[1:26:33] again. And a Come on, somebody. Amen.
[1:26:36] You may go down. You may go down and
[1:26:38] your daddy might be a duckworth. Your
[1:26:40] your daddy might be a sartan. Amen. But
[1:26:41] you might get up and you realize you're
[1:26:43] a son or a daughter of God. Amen. You're
[1:26:45] no longer just a just the brother
[1:26:47] Brandon would say it like this. I I
[1:26:48] realized I was no longer just the son of
[1:26:50] Charles and Ella Brandom. Amen. But he
[1:26:52] knew he was a son of God. Why? Because
[1:26:54] the Holy Ghost changes your identity and
[1:26:56] makes you reflect differently.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Amen. You can
[1:27:00] look you can look at somebody and I I
[1:27:02] got to quit picking on people. There's
[1:27:03] not enough of you here. But I I start
[1:27:05] picking on the wrong person. And I'll
[1:27:06] get run out of here before I'm over. But
[1:27:08] I want you to know something tonight.
[1:27:10] Amen. You can look in the mirror and you
[1:27:11] can see reflection. You can see types of
[1:27:13] of your daddy and you can see types
[1:27:15] reflections of your mama in you. Amen.
[1:27:17] But what I want you to know tonight is
[1:27:19] when you look in the mirror, look beyond
[1:27:20] the veil of dust. Look beyond the veil
[1:27:23] of flesh and say, "That man right
[1:27:24] there's been fighting me for years, but
[1:27:26] there's a spirit on the inside of me,
[1:27:28] and he's rising up in me to make me an
[1:27:31] overcomer in this hour." Are you still
[1:27:32] with me? He said, "It makes you a
[1:27:34] servant. It takes the starch out of you.
[1:27:36] It makes it takes it makes image molding
[1:27:38] a new life, new creation. You may be all
[1:27:40] messed up when you get up, but you're
[1:27:42] born again. How many in here tonight is
[1:27:45] born again, but you need a refilling?
[1:27:46] Amen. I say tonight, if you're born
[1:27:48] again and you need a refilling, then I
[1:27:50] think you just need to go ahead and get
[1:27:51] your refilling here tonight. Amen. You
[1:27:53] don't have to leave here the same person
[1:27:55] that you came. You don't have to leave
[1:27:57] here in a gloomy in a gloomy place. And
[1:27:59] you don't have to leave here wondering
[1:28:01] who am I? No, you are a son and a
[1:28:04] daughter of the most high God. And God
[1:28:06] did not call you to lose you. Somebody
[1:28:08] ought to say, "Amen." He said, "You may
[1:28:09] be all messed up when you get up, but
[1:28:11] you're born again. No matter where you
[1:28:12] are, it makes a new life. It brings a
[1:28:15] new He said image life." I love that in
[1:28:17] images of Christ. He preaches that. And
[1:28:19] he said, "It brings a new image life."
[1:28:21] He said, "It makes a servant out of you.
[1:28:23] You want to serve." Then Jesus wanted us
[1:28:25] to serve one another. I want you to know
[1:28:27] when Jesus came, brother Brandon would
[1:28:29] say like this. He didn't come, he said
[1:28:30] he didn't come to be ministered to, but
[1:28:32] he came to minister to the people. I
[1:28:34] want you to know that when you get the
[1:28:35] Holy Ghost, it'll make you stop, it'll
[1:28:38] make you stop wanting everything that
[1:28:39] that that God's got so much, but it'll
[1:28:41] be it'll make you want to give praises
[1:28:42] back to God. Amen. It'll be it'll make
[1:28:44] you want to go love your brother and and
[1:28:46] win them back to the kingdom of God.
[1:28:48] What can you say? Amen. Amen. The life
[1:28:50] of Christ comes into you. Amen. It's a
[1:28:52] servant life. It's a humble life. And
[1:28:54] what we need tonight, I would say this.
[1:28:56] If you've come in a place, amen, where
[1:28:58] the devil has held you back and it looks
[1:29:00] like it's all cloudy here tonight and
[1:29:02] you can't see the reflection of the sun
[1:29:04] no more, then I would say raise up your
[1:29:05] hands and give God praise because when
[1:29:08] you raise up your hands, it's a sign
[1:29:09] that you are surrendering that gloomy
[1:29:11] spirit of God that that the devil has
[1:29:13] put on you and you are taking on the
[1:29:16] spirit of Christ here tonight. I wonder
[1:29:17] if we could stand to our feet. I want
[1:29:19] you to know something tonight. You don't
[1:29:21] have to leave here in a poor condition.
[1:29:23] You don't have to leave here in a sick
[1:29:25] condition. Come on, church. You don't
[1:29:27] have to leave here the way you came. The
[1:29:29] prophet said you would leave better or
[1:29:31] you would leave worse. But I say let's
[1:29:33] leave better here tonight. Amen. You You
[1:29:34] say, "Brother Joel, if we'd have had the
[1:29:36] right preacher, I'm going to go and tell
[1:29:37] you something. The preacher can only be
[1:29:39] a servant." Amen. But the word of God is
[1:29:41] more powerful. Amen. And he can even
[1:29:42] discern the secrets of your heart here
[1:29:44] tonight. Amen. And so if the word is
[1:29:46] going forth and the power of God is in
[1:29:48] the word, then I believe here tonight,
[1:29:50] every one of you can be born again and
[1:29:53] renewed in your spirits here tonight, I
[1:29:55] say it's time to raise your hands and
[1:29:57] say, "Satan, you have no business on
[1:29:59] God's property.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; You ain't got no right over here. You
[1:30:03] ain't got no right to hold my hands down
[1:30:05] no more. You ain't got no right to come
[1:30:07] over here and give me depression.
[1:30:09] Depression don't have to stay on you.
[1:30:12] Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The devil don't have to stay on you.
[1:30:16] How many believes greater is he? If
[1:30:18] greater is he, then why are you letting
[1:30:19] that devil have dominion over your life?
[1:30:24] Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You're letting the devil have so much.
[1:30:26] We're glorifying the devil. You Oh, I've
[1:30:28] got I've got depression. No, that's the
[1:30:30] devil's depression. Give it back to him.
[1:30:32] I I I've got sickness in my body. That's
[1:30:34] the devil's sickness. Give it back to
[1:30:35] him. I I feel gloomy. I feel out of
[1:30:38] place. Give that gloomy spirit back to
[1:30:40] the devil that gave it to you. And raise
[1:30:42] up your holy hands in the sanctuary and
[1:30:44] say, "Lord, I'm going to praise you
[1:30:46] more. I'm going to love you more. I'm
[1:30:48] going to give you everything I've got in
[1:30:49] my life." Why? Because he has given me
[1:30:51] the Holy Ghost. Amen. To have a servant
[1:30:53] life and a humble life. Oh, I wish
[1:30:56] somebody would just reach out and praise
[1:30:58] him here tonight. And you say, "Are you
[1:30:59] trying to work the people up? Do you
[1:31:01] believe he's worthy? Do you believe he's
[1:31:02] worthy of it here tonight? Do you
[1:31:04] believe that he can express himself
[1:31:06] through you? I don't care how low down
[1:31:07] you are. I want you to know this in
[1:31:09] closing. I'll say this. When Jesus went
[1:31:12] to the woman at the well, he didn't go
[1:31:13] to the biggest named person in the city.
[1:31:15] He didn't go to the ones that looked
[1:31:17] like they had it all together. But he
[1:31:18] went to somebody who was messed up and
[1:31:20] had made a bunch of bad decisions in
[1:31:22] life. But I want you to know what
[1:31:24] happened when he spoke to her and the
[1:31:26] word ignited her heart. She didn't sit
[1:31:29] there and say, "That was a pretty good
[1:31:30] show." No, it ignited something on the
[1:31:32] inside. And she said, "Come see a man
[1:31:35] who has told me all the things that I've
[1:31:36] ever done. I wonder if you can break
[1:31:38] free from that spirit that's holding you
[1:31:40] back tonight. You can tell your
[1:31:41] relatives on in the morning. Say, I I'm
[1:31:43] free from the depression I've been
[1:31:45] fighting. I'm free from the demons I've
[1:31:47] been carrying around. I'm free. Thank
[1:31:49] the Lord, I'm free." Somebody ought to
[1:31:51] give God praise in the building here
[1:31:52] tonight. If you're free, then let God
[1:31:55] know you're free. Let every devil know
[1:31:57] that I am an overcomer. Let the devil
[1:32:00] know you can't hold me here. He ain't
[1:32:02] got no chains on me. He ain't got no
[1:32:04] right to you.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Are you free here tonight?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Are you free?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; You see, I don't feel no life in me. In
[1:32:20] John 5:12, he says it like this, "He
[1:32:22] that hath the Son hath life."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And he that hath not the Son of God hath
[1:32:28] not life. So, if you don't feel like you
[1:32:30] have the life of God in you tonight,
[1:32:32] then it's time that you do what a
[1:32:34] prophet said and find you an altar. And
[1:32:36] it may be a mess because a birth is a
[1:32:39] mess.
[1:32:41] But if you don't have that life in you
[1:32:43] tonight, you don't have to I hope I'm
[1:32:45] chosen. No. All you got to do is if
[1:32:47] there's a desire there, accept the life
[1:32:50] of Jesus Christ. Oh, I want the power of
[1:32:52] God in my life. Accept the life of Jesus
[1:32:54] Christ. There's more power than you've
[1:32:56] ever dreamed of in it. there. There's
[1:32:58] more power. There's more authority in
[1:33:00] this word than you could ever even
[1:33:01] imagine. Are you still with me here
[1:33:03] tonight? I I I want to just talk to you
[1:33:05] for a moment as we close. Every head
[1:33:07] bowed, every eye closed. I I'm not going
[1:33:09] to You don't have to come to the altar,
[1:33:10] but if you want to, you can. But I want
[1:33:12] to say this here tonight. God does not
[1:33:14] want you to leave this place gloomy and
[1:33:18] down and depressed.
[1:33:20] Those spirits are not of God.
[1:33:25] But he said, "Be of good cheer,
[1:33:27] for I have come to overcome the world."
[1:33:31] So if the world got you down, guess
[1:33:33] what? God has come to overcome that
[1:33:36] thing that got you down. If the world
[1:33:38] has tried to take away your joy, I would
[1:33:40] say like David, restore unto me the joy
[1:33:43] of my salvation. He never said you was
[1:33:45] lost. He never said you wasn't saved,
[1:33:47] but he said, "Restore the joy of my
[1:33:50] salvation. I want to reflect the sun
[1:33:52] again. remove the clouds of doubt and
[1:33:55] let me be a reflection that the sun is
[1:33:57] shining somewhere
[1:34:00] with every head bowed. If you every eye
[1:34:02] closed, if you if you want to just raise
[1:34:04] your hand up to him and say, "Lord, I I
[1:34:06] need more of you here tonight. I need a
[1:34:08] refilling of the Holy Ghost. Lord, my
[1:34:10] hands up to you tonight. I need a
[1:34:12] refilling of the Holy Ghost here
[1:34:14] tonight. Lord, take the rough edges off
[1:34:17] of me. If it requires you to put me
[1:34:19] through a trial, if it requires you to
[1:34:21] put me through a test, Lord, let me know
[1:34:23] that it's you working all things for my
[1:34:25] good, it's you creating the very image
[1:34:27] of yourself in me. Oh, I wonder if we
[1:34:30] could just pray like that. Pray in your
[1:34:31] own special way right there tonight.
[1:34:34] Oh, that all
[1:34:36] all that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:34:46] Hallelujah.
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:51] And I know it's not much, but I've
[1:34:55] nothing else fit for a king
[1:35:01] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[1:35:11] Hallelujah.
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:18] Let's sing this now.
[1:35:22] All my words fall short.
[1:35:28] I've got nothing new.
[1:35:34] How could I express
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:40] all my gratitude?
[1:35:47] I could sing these songs
[1:35:53] as I often do.
[1:35:59] But every song must change.
[1:36:04] Oh, and you never do with all your
[1:36:08] hearts now. Oh, so I throw up my hands.
[1:36:15] Praise you again and again.

[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:37:01] Who's got a response here tonight?
[1:37:05] I've got one response.
[1:37:11] I've got just one move.
[1:37:17] With my arms stretched wide.
[1:37:22] Oh, I will worship you with all your
[1:37:26] hearts now. Oh, so I'll throw up my
[1:37:31] hands and praise you again and again.

[1:38:11] Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] So come on my soul.
[1:38:17] Oh sing with all your hearts now.
[1:38:21] Oh.

[1:38:36] lungs. So get up and praise. Can anybody
