bypass on brother Robert but um he's in Rec or he was in recovery they actually went in and talked to him uh they said the recovery would take roughly a week at the hospital then six to eight weeks at

if all goes well they'll start walking him tomorrow so we just believe in the Lord will thank the Lord for Success on the surgery and and um my it's I'm glad for medical science but I know that we

evening have you come to Worship the Lord amen if you have your Bibles we'll just get right into the word tonight uh Matthew 24 and 24 I like to say it's an honor to be here this evening I enjoy the the message this morning I I trust you was blessed by it this morning God was blessed here hearing your pastor this morning and so amen I uh makes a guy a little nervous got to come behind that Minister tonight but I pray something can be said to be a blessing it's good to see all of our friends good to see the shamal it's been a little while so it's good to see y'all again God bless you it's good to have my wife with me uh wherever she's out she's right back there we got a two-month old baby and so we we've been on the road for about six weeks and so we've we've had a a good time so I know the Lord has many blessings for her but being yeah it's wonderful thank you being an evangelist wife she has to make a lot of sacrifices so I want thank the Lord for her tonight but Matthew 24 and 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and I just like how he puts that if it were possible behold I have told you before when wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together amen can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to come into your house Lord God as we we heard your word this morning God I was blessed by it father I trust each one of us can Lord take it to our our our places our homes Lord and apply it father but Lord this is a new service a new opportunity God I ask that you would come in a special way tonight I know we're all tired and weary and body Lord but Lord may we push it aside tonight Lord and receive what you have for us tonight father Lord may we never take for granted God the times that we have to come into your presence father we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and if I had a subject tonight it would be attracted by the voice and brother Brandon he preaches on The Voice and I was listening to it this morning and he was he was talking about there's many different voices there politics have a voice he says your spouse could have a voice he says Hollywood has a voice there's many different voices you might not hear uh uh the literal voice but they're influences there's many influences that can come and attract your attention but the Bible is letting us know we're not going to listen to any voice but it's got to be a scripture voice we're not just following anything but where the carcass is there the Eagles are going to be gathered together in other words it's going to be Eagle food that's going to attract you not any voice will do it but the devil is going to try to do anything he can to get you away from the carcass brother Brandon would say Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he cannot make you serpent seed he can't make you a foolish virgin but what he will do he says this so he does all that he can do to destroy the confidence in the word and so he can't make you serpent seed but what he would do is get different voices to influence you away from the attraction and we know what brother the brandom continues on to say but when the church dis believes Satan and believes the spirits of revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her so he painted the dark picture that Satan's going to come after you to get you away from the word but at the same time he gave you a promise that if you will get away from the influences of the world and the voices of the world and receive the Revelation that the spirit has brought in this generation the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you and I believe that was a prophecy for your life and that prophecy has got to come to pass there will be somebody that's embracing the voice in this generation and you will have an overcoming power but I believe we're living in a day of convenience we have every option out there you go to buy a car and you have a red car a blue car a purple car a pink car you have different models different shapes a van a truck a car there's many different options out there you go to a restaurant you have a menu with different options it's a day of convenience but the same thing is happening in the Supernatural if you don't like what's being preached today you can go down the road and go to another church or go to a Baptist Church in a Pentecostal Church there's many options out there and what the only way we can determine what is the right one is by the word of God I believe we've got a guide book in this generation the Bible we every belief system that we have today can go right back to the Bible so no matter what organization we come from or come out of there's something that we can agree upon that's the word of God if not we're in the wrong voice but if we're following the right voice it will always go right back to scripture but the brandom says this and the reason that the church is in the condition that it is in is because there are so many voices out there so many other the voices to attract the church from the voice of God so not only not the voice of God Is Not the Only attraction there's many other attractions out there but what are you attracted to but I believe that we're not just here hoping to find something but there's something on the inside that is looking for the supernatural we're not just guessing and hoping we're going to make a Rapture but there's an attraction on the inside that has looked up the voice and says this right here is a rapturing faith this right here is my way out of here we're living in Gloom we're living in chaos we're living the the world's falling apart but there's a hope for the bride of Christ that's inside of the voice in this generation oh my we look at the world there's gays there's lesbians we can look what's going on in Israel there's riots in America about what's going on in Israel people's taking up for what's going on over there for taking up for Hamas and these things we can look and think my the world is hopeless but at the same time there's an assurance in the bride of Christ that the gates of hell is is not going to Prevail and I think we can look at Israel but no matter who turns against Israel Israel's going to win that war it's been prophesied that Israel is going to win if that's the natural people of God what about the Supernatural come on now what about his bride if they cannot be defeated what about you you can't be defeated no matter what comes against you what Spirit what nothing that comes out of the gates of hell is going to Prevail against you because you've been promised to overcome but brother Brandon continues on to say that it tell it's very doubtful that many people would hear the voice of God though would spoke in their midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day so he's telling us that the voice ain't is not going to speak but it's going to speak but because of the other attra actions it will be a foreign thing to us oh my but I believe there's somebody that is focused on the right thing you see what the Brandon would say and the voice of God in the last days and it become that way again today that the voice of God there are so many other voices then if God promised that he would give us that and if other voices contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of the enemy to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke spoke and so that's that that that's the booby trap of the devil is to bring confusion the message didn't come to bring confusion it come to bring It come to bring the answers and I believe that we've been called out but we're not just called out but we're placed into our inheritance you see but we got to make sure we're following the right thing the Bible would tell us in Colossians 2 and8 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit and after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ he's letting you know they can have a Ministry they could have an anointing but if it's not pointing you to the right thing you better not follow it come on now we got to make sure we're following the right thing but you see it's a pressure of the day to push you away from the voice of God you see the word pressure means uh the the persuasion and influence and intimidation to make someone do something so we can see the pressures of leard deia is that gets you to get away from the word of God like I said earlier that our belief system must come back to the Bible and it's pressure that comes and gets you away from the doctrines of the Bible and if somebody's leading you away from the Bible it's the false voice but the message of Malachi 4 has brought us back to the Bible oh Hallelujah you see the Bible with tell us that it will be a dark dismal day but at the same time I promised that there will be light in this generation but it shall come one day which shall be known to the Lord not day not night but it shall come the past that in the evening time it shall be light and I believe we're living in the light of God's word in Psalms 119 and 105 Thy word is a lamp under my feet and a l unto my path and I just like how David is putting that he's making and a personal it's a light unto my path it might not be their light or their light but I'm making it a personal revelation to me and I believe that can be your conviction tonight it's my light it's my Revelation though this one Falls away that one Falls away this one backslides this message is my Revelation this message is my ti poost hey you see wow I started studying on these things and many people I hope this is okay brother the being have a problem with headship but they don't realize that headship has two parts it's a meeting yourself too but at the same time the responsibility for your well-being goes on to who you're submitting yourself to you can take a marriage like we just hearing something this morning when before me and my wife was married she had to work she had to buy her own clothes she had to provide her own way but when she submitted to my headship her responsibilities become my responsibilities no longer is she having to to work she's not having to pay for her own clothes her own food but now I'm providing the way for her well-being oh that's the same way it is with the message of the hour many people don't like to submit to it because it's an absolute but at the same time it's a Ty poost oh my your responsibility becomes its responsibility then the pressure is off you're not trying to make a Rapture in your own ability but now it's the message of the hour putting you in a position oh Hallelujah you're not trying to make the body change in your own ability but now it's the responsibility has become the word of God's responsibility oh that should make somebody happy that we're not having to do this in our own ability but what we're following is leading Us in the right direction oh Hallelujah I don't care what the world is doing but this is my direction brother brandom says in everything give the word test how do you know you got the Holy Ghost he says give the word test in every situation he says give the word test and if it don't line up with the word it's the wrong voice you know I was in Montreal this last year I believe at an airport and I started to talk to some Mormons and I never knew what Mormons believed you know I I I just never never talked to them but I my my plane got delayed oh actually they they lost my luggage so I had to stay overnight there at the airport and I was just tired out and I got there at 4:00 in the morning getting through customs and I there there was three Mormons that come up to me and started to talk to me and I didn't really want to argue with them so I was just listening to what they got to say and they said you know after Christ was crucified and he went back to Heaven he come to America and he preached here in America and I thought my like I said I was tired I didn't want to argue with him and I just said where's the scripture for it they says no there's no scripture for it but I think it was Joseph Smith I think who their leader was said well it was Joseph Smith had a vision and in this Vision there was a cave and in this cave was the book of the Mormons and inside of that book gave us the revelation of what happened and I thought my but where's the scripture this says we don't got no scripture for it but in the book of the Mormons it says it here and I said well I think I'll stick with the Bible and they says well we understand the Bible a whole lot better now because of the book of the Mormons we understand Christ a whole lot more because of the book of the Mormons but then I ask where is the scripture they have their voice but it wasn't a scripture voice so you got to make sure who you're following is a scripture voice because there's no power in is something like that but with the scripture with the scripture you will be led to the King of Kings oh you can look at the wise men it was the wise men that seen the star and brother brandham says one of them says hey check the Scrolls and sees what the Scrolls says about a star and they open the scroll to numbers and it says out of je show arise a star out of Jacob and you know what they done but the brandom says they left the fire but they were sitting around and followed the star they didn't need a man-made light anymore they found a supernatural star that was backed up by scripture oh my what did that star do the Bible says they followed that star and it l them to Jesus Christ Christ and led them to the anointed but what I love about that story is the Bible says they rejoiced when they seen the star and I thought my how come they rejoiced because out of all of the astrologers out of all of the stargazers they were the only one to realize this is the star and what's the bible say that in the right hand of God was Seven Stars and those stars were angels and Messengers to each of the seven Church ages and they were to bring a message oh my what was this message to do in this generation lead you to the Supernatural come on now we're not just following some some vain philosophy but we're following something that has led us to the supernatural we can believe that God heals the sick we can believe that God still delivers and sets free of the voice that we're following has led us to the king oh my what's the Bible say whenever they went into the city they started to they the started to yell out where is he the king of the Jews for we have seen his star and have come to worship him they wanted to be led to the king what is what what is a king it is somebody with Dominion it is somebody with an authority so they knew if they could just follow the star to the king they could find the power of the Supernatural and oh my if we can just follow the star it's going to lead us to the king and we can see the supernatural we can see God Mighty in battle oh my if we can just stick with the voice any voice that you follow has got to come back to scripture brother brandom says and God has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we are living in and after he promised it we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need he says that's the confidence that we have in our maker that he is going to meet the need and he says what's going to meet the need the voice oh my the voice is going to meet the need Hallelujah and W brother brandom says this and there was a question asked here in the scripture and this morning after I left off speaking on the word of expectation to expect now I trust that you took it home with you and searched it through the the scriptures to find out what to expect God's word tells us what we can expect if we receive this word without any doubt mixed into it we will receive what we come for so he's letting us know our expectation has to be a scriptural expectation hope y hope this is making sense this evening where where the where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together so before the Eagles can be gathered by the carcass the has to be an appetite there has to be something attracted to the carcass and brother brandom is letting us know your expectation has to be a scriptural expectation to meet the scriptural need so before the need can be met there's got to be somebody with an expectation come on for the voice to come to you see before there was a speaker there was a need for the speaker before there ever was a microphone there was a need for the mic microphone somebody didn't just come up with a microphone and say wow what are we going to use this for but before they created it there was somebody in need of it oh and before this message over come to your life there was a scriptural expectation there was an attraction saying I need something I need something to pull me out of doubts I need something to pull me out of confusion and whenever the message come by your way it was the Deep calleth to the Deep brother the brandom says whenever Mama Eagle went by the chicken pin and there was the baby we know the story whenever the baby was there inside of the chicken pen he says he there was something that responded that that little Eagle come from Mama and since he come from Mama there was an attraction that went to Mama and he says you come from the word and whenever the word come by your path there was an attraction to it oh that's why you can't disbelieve this message you can't turn away from it because you come from it it's your identity it's who you are it's your inheritance it's your promised land it's what is guiding you you can't turn away from it oh Hallelujah there's a scriptural expectation that is waiting for something to come and I believe we're no longer waiting but her expectation has been met you see the Bible would say in 1 Corinthians 9:26 therefore so I therefore so run not as certainly so I fight not as one that beateth the air and that scripture just stood out to me he's letting you know that I'm not just one beating the air but I got a direction I'm F fighting for a cause and I believe that is our our attitude we're not just one beating the air but we got something that we're pressing to obtain and brother brandom says that's what the attraction is the predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it he said says that means more than life to us to our lives but you don't take it you don't take that what is the attraction God usual fulfilling his word he says what's the attraction God fulfilling his word is the attraction you know you can look at the natural the bar only attracts somebody who drinks the the the the casinos only attract somebody that that that that gambles and so the word is only going to attract somebody that has a scriptural expect you remember the Brandon he was walking at one of his meetings and he's seen all the license plates and him and his wife and he says what's the attraction and then he said that's where he got the the inspiration for what's the attraction on the mount he says it's the word that is the attraction and I think my we're not gathered together tonight just to hear some Bible story but we've been attracted by something that is the word of God oh my but you see it's a two-way street not only is the word coming for somebody but the word is looking for something brother the brandom talks about the woman who licked radium that were you that was used for watches and he says the woman was making watches and she licked the radium and she later on died and he said and then there was people doing some tests on her skulls and they got an instrument and put it by her skull and that instrument started to work he says it was because they got an instrument that was compatible with radium not any instrument could work with radium but with something that was compatible with that radium that that that an instrument come to life and I thought my not anything could bring the bride to life but once the word there something that was compatible with the bride of Christ the bride's Revival started to get into action and I think my this bride ain't dead but the move is on for the bride we are the Invincible Army there was something that come by your way and attracted us it says we're not meant to be in the chicken yard we're meant to be in the Heights our position is in is in the Heights with Christ Jesus Oh Hallelujah but it was something that we could recognize it was an attraction you see brother brandom says this he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes the real eego recognizes the call of God's word why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle and he says the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour yeah oh he says the word predestinated that you and the word written for the hour is word to the word it's an attraction oh my the once the two comes together it produces life it produces the Revelation for this generation hey you see I don't believe that the the the prophet was the only one with the ministry but the brides got a Ministry in this generation if you can sing sing if you can preach preach if you can play instruments play instruments you need get beyond the pressures of the world and left the an anointing come on your life and fulfill the ministry that God has given you hey you know brother brandham says the first Divine healer was David he says whenever he would play and sing songs that would drive their spirit away from Saul the first Divine healer wasn't a preacher and I thought my there's some young ladies that get complexes on them that they can't sing like that one they can't sing like that one and the devil's trying to your ministry but if you can sing push past those complexes I'm preaching now if you can play some music push past those complexes you've got to Ministry hey you look at Jehoshaphat whenever Jehoshaphat was surrounded by the by the neighboring countries and he was praying to God and the Lord spoke to him and says this battle is not yours it is mind and what did he tell Jehoshaphat to do he didn't tell him go get some Spears go get some swords go get some armor but what he did tell him to do was go get some singers come on now those singers had a Ministry that was going to defeat the enemies that was coming against him and I say this evening you don't got to be a preacher to have a Ministry if God has called you fulfill that Ministry this message has anointed you hey brother the brandom says what is the what is the bride's Ministry it's the message of the hour he says our ministry is the same as the Grooms we're speaking the same things what's the Bible say the the spirit and the bride say come the same spirit that anointed Malachi 4 is the same spirit that has come on the bride of Christ we're preaching the same things we're singing the same things we're playing with the same anointing what is it brother Josh we've been attracted to the anointed word oh my that has brought on an anointing you see if you can only recognize the anointed word for your generation you can see the anointing for that generation you know the but the brandom talks about the the the the prostitute whenever she seen Jesus at Simon's house we all know the story when she seen Jesus and she had to crawl her way to get to Jesus with the alabaster box we all know the story brother the brandom says her recognizing the anointed released to her her forgiveness and I thought wow that's powerful her recognizing the anointed freed her to fulfill her Ministry oh my many people can't fulfill their Ministry because they haven't recognized the anointed if you can just recognize the anointed that is in your midst not a man not not a prophet necessarily but the voice the message the anointed word and if that can just attract you and break off the the the bounds of psychology break off man's ideas and man's Creeds and that will give you the ability to fulfill the ministry that God has given you oh my brother brandom says this and the eagle of God eats the word of God and that alone hope this is okay this evening the eagle of God eats the word of God and that alone he says he he can't stomach that old thing of the world that's right he won't digest it he couldn't stand it anyhow he wants fresh meat he wants the freshness of the Holy Spirit the meat of God right out of the Bible right out of the Bible oh Hallelujah and so that's the what that's what the word has come to is the scriptural expectation brother brandom says then we got the Revelation in the last days the message of the hour or the message of the Lord God together the bride together no age has it ever been promised it's promised in this age oh my you you can look at Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished the mystery of God should be finished so whenever we recognize the voice the mystery it's no longer in a mysterious form but we've got the revelation of it you know my pastor brother wendle he took this scripture the other day and he said something I thought was wonderful he says when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and he says how come the Bible didn't say it would be finished he says because it's only finished to a special class of people it's still a mysterious form to everybody else it should be finished but not everybody can see the mystery but if you can see the mystery the mystery is finished and I thank God I'm so grateful that you chose me to see the mystery hey you remember there in the in the Bible the the the disciples asked Jesus how come you speak in a parable and he says it is because the mystery is not given to them to know the mystery but to you it has been given not anybody is attracted to the voice but if you're attracted to it you should give God thanks you should give God glory and say I'm thankful that you have given me something to be attracted with oh Hallelujah we've been given something that that that has brought brought us out of confusion and is gathering us together you see what what what happened whenever Elijah we all know the story of Elijah whenever he says there's not going to be no rain nor duw till I call for it there was judgment upon that Nation but the same voice that brought forth judgment was the same voice that brought forth life to the the widow woman we all we all know the story the Bible says that Ahab sent out his servants to find water for his cattle to find Green Pastures for his cattle but at the same time this is going on he's at a widow woman's house that was about to eat her last meal and die but the same voice that brought judgment to one generation was bringing life to another group to another to another to another woman we see brother brandom says whenever he went and grabbed a handful of meal out of the pot he says he didn't destroy the pot but he took a handful of meal and he threw it inside of the pot of death he says he replaced the death with the life and I thought my that's that's wonderful he didn't destroy our lives but he took out the death and given us the life oh my we're marching on our way to a Rapture I believe there's nothing that can keep us from from being EarthBound any longer there's been a separation that has taken place the Bible would tell us that in Revelations 18:4 and the heard of The Voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of plagues what is the voice it's a message and so now there's two classes of people there's two attractions one's being attracted to the plagues and the other one's being attracted to the voice and but the brain says that is the last Angel's message is coming to the predestinated he said it's coming to the predestinated to call them out he says watch it we are in a calling out come out of Babylon my people said the Angel's voice out of what out of confusion it's this this is the Methodist right or the Baptist or the Catholic come out of it God is right he says how do you know let every man's word be a lie and M the truth come out of it so not only are we attracted to something but the voice is calling us out right hope this is okay this evening you know before you can go into something you got to come out of it many people want to go into the into the Rapture but they haven't been fully called out yet remember before the children of Israel could get into the promised land they had to come out of Egypt you may say well they come out of Egypt not a lot of them didn't how come they get they didn't go into the promised land they wanted to go back to Egypt the physical body come out of Egypt but their heart was still in Egypt but only the ones that was fully C out of Egypt went into the promised land it was a Joshua and it was a Caleb they are the ones that went into the promised land well all of the other ones we all know the story it's Bible that said let us get a captain let us get a captain and return back to Egypt the body was called out of Egypt but up their Spirit their soul their heart was still back there in Egypt but I believe we're not partaking of the things of the world our heart is not in the things of the world but our heart is in this message and that is what's placing us in our inheritance oh come on somebody I'm preaching the message now you see the Bible says in Exodus in Exodus 3 and8 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out into a good land and to a large land flowing with milk and honey so it wasn't just bringing them out it was taking them in so this message isn't just bringing us out of leor sea it's taking us into our inheritance oh Hallelujah the Rapture is right around the corner the body change is right around the corner if you stick with the voice oh Hallelujah the same voice that called you out of confusion is the same voice that is taken you all the way to a Rapture it's the same voice oh Hallelujah is there's an attraction to the voice oh my but it's coming a way where only you can respond Remember The Story of Lazarus I'll bring this down to a close here in a few minutes Remember The Story of Lazarus whenever Lazarus had died the Bible says Jesus come to the tomb and says Lazarus come forth but the brandom says how come he didn't say come forth he says because the whole Cemetery would have come forth but he said Lazarus and so that voice spoken away where only Lazarus could respond oh come on now it's spoken away where only Lazarus could respond and this message has spoken away where only the bride could respond there's a deep calling to the Deep the seed on the inside is a part of the word oh my we look at the scripture in joural 11:39 and Jesus said take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead and I want you to notice something here he is identifying Lazarus as Dead He's identifying him as as one among the dead and Jesus said unto her take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead you come down to the 41st verse and then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead laid then then the then the voice the scripture says in the 43rd verse and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth so his identity changed from dead to this identity that he had before that state oh what is this message done is given you the identity that you had in the mind of God you was a blasphemer here you was a sinner here you you you you was in pornography you was a gambler you was a drunk you had an identity of the tombs but once the voice cried and come by your way he did not call you by your your Earthly identity he gave the identity that you had in the mind of God oh my he took on your identity as a sinner and giving you his identity as a mage Jesus Christ oh my what's the Bible say in John 11 1144 the next verse and he that was dead come forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and so now it's a past tense his identity is no longer dead but it was dead and now his identity is Lazarus oh and I say you once was in Creeds you was in Traditions you was in dogmas you once was in a denominational tomb but once The Voice come by your way and spoke in a way that you couldn't help but respond you left it behind and got your original identity you are bone of his Bat life of his life power of his power you are him the same Authority that he had this bride of Christ has hey I think it's time we quit living below our means and rise to the occasion and put every Spirit under our feet every torment and devil that comes against your mind comes against your family comes against your homes you've got the authority to put it behind you may say brother Josh I don't think so the story ain't over with Lazarus the story still goes on the Bible says John 11:44 he that was dead come forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go oh yeah think about that now he was brought to life the voice called him give him his identity but he still had some things of the Grave yeah come on now he still had some ideas from the grave he still had some opinions from the grave and he had to let those go but you notice how he left those go it wasn't Jesus coming and loosen him but he commissioned a five-fold Ministry come on now it was the same voice that spoke life to Lazarus was the same voice that told them to loose them and let them go come on now so now whenever the people would come up to last Lazarus they have the same Authority that Jesus had to loose Lazarus and I so I'm so thankful for a Fone Ministry that is sticking with the Voice of Truth every time your pastor gets up and preaches and you're agreeing with the word so more grave clothes are falling off he gets up and preaches you agree with the word so more grave Clothes Fall Off what is it it's the five-fold ministry that is perfecting the Saints in scripture now what is it he's not getting up and preaching his own ideas but he's taking the voice and he's preaching the voice and that is liberating you it's the voice that is taken off the grave clothes oh my how come many people can't worship and praise God because they still got grave clothes on hey I'm leaving tomorrow it's okay many people can't praise God they can't worship they can't lift their hands because they're in grave cloth still I think it's time that a Revival comes in the house of God and we can get out of those great FES and worship God lift up those hands sing praises to God it's okay to sing praises to God it's okay to lift up your hands you're letting your neighbor know you're not dead if you're alive your body's going to move and if the bride of Christ is alive you got a little bit of action you can't help but praise your hands you can't help but say Amen what is it you've been liberated from the tomb and I believe this bride has been liberated from the denominational tombs and has been given her identity the grave clothes are off oh the grave clothes are off and you can't help but Worship the Lord hallelujah it's the word amen it's the word that has brought forth a Liberation as the musicians come this evening oh my the Bible would say in John 1837 pilot therefore said unto him are thou the king then Jesus answered thou say that I am a king to this to this end was I born and to this cause I come into the world that I should not bear witness that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice and I'm so glad I'm a part of that truth I've seen the voice I've recognized the voice and now I'm following the voice amen can me back bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for the voice that you've given us in this generation father not a voice of a man Lord not a voice from a Kian but it's the scriptural voice Lord Lord we're not even interested in hearing the literal voice of the Prophet father but we're
