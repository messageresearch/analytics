shine on let the light from the [Music] lighthouse is that your desire tonight let him shine on you glow through you and let's bow our heads for a moment if you could if you have a need on your heart tonight wonder if you can just make it known by the uplifting of your hand heavenly father as we come before you tonight Lord and to bring the word to your people Lord I ask that you would get me out of the way Lord help me to not speak words that that I would want to say but Lord help me to say something that that you would have me say tonight to these people to bring life life to them Lord I pray each one of the people sitting here today would receive what they have need of and Lord as your word Goes Forth I pray you would anoint your word anoint the hearers and be with us through the remainder of this service we ask in Jesus name amen amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen if you could turn to Matthew chapter 12 and verse 38 Matthew 12 and 38 man then certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee and he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here the queen of the South shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here you believe that tonight amen you can be seated Jesus is talking to these here the scribes the Pharisees and he he's talking to a group of people who were actually in his presence and didn't recognize that he was there they knew it was a man named Jesus but they didn't know who Jesus was I wonder if many times we're in the presence of God but we don't know that we're in the presence of God well come on somebody we know he's here but we don't recognize it as being his presence sometimes because the service doesn't go how he want it to the presence of God didn't show up no we've got to recognize it as the presence of God and so brother bandam said here and and it's important to be in the presence of God how many knows that brother brand says so many get the same opportunity today to stand in his presence as they did then and still because of popular opinion they turn it down standing in the presence of God so it is possible that you could stand in the presence of God and not recognize his presence it's possible you could stand in the presence of God and turn down the presence of God it is possible that you could actually be standing in the same room as Jesus and not know Jesus was there what can you say Amen it is very possible that you could even invite him into a service and not know that he showed up why is it it's because we don't always recognize how he comes he doesn't come by the way you may want him to come he may not come by the way we think he should come but he promised to always show up so we know his presence is always here now you could grieve his presence from you you could you could say things you could do things that would grieve his presence but brother brandom said he doesn't go far away but maybe he'll just fly off like a little Dove would fly away but you've got to recognize that if you'll just invite him back his presence can be right there again so we understand that recognize there there's got to be something in you to recognize the presence of God and the word recognize in the English is it is to identify from having encountered it them before and to know again so it's something you have been in in contact with and so you know what it feels like and when it comes back around again it it just feels right it feels like the presence of God but at one time in your life or another you have had to come in contact with the presence of God or you'll never know how it feels when he comes I remember a story from Brother Billy Paul he said that when he when he was in the room there in Illinois with brother Brandon and the angel of the Lord came in the room how many's heard the story you know what he you know what he said there and he and and the angel of the Lord come in the room and he said he never he he never forgot the presence of that being that was in the room room and that's the way it is today we may not see a literal being in the room we may not see an actual light in the room but the presence of God can still be here and I believe the presence of God is many times in our services but it goes unrecognized because it didn't come how we wanted it but I think we need to let go and let God have his way let go and let God show up any way he wants to let God come on the scene however he wishes to come on the scene let the presence of God have the preeminence in our services again let the presence of God change lives it may not come how you want him to but if he comes entertain him while he's here yeah he said now when he is not recognized then his power is not always revealed when he is not recognize no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it that's all so you can invite him here but if you don't believe he showed up he can't do you no good well I invited him to church but I didn't get what I wanted well you didn't believe believe that when you ask him to come he would actually come but see what he does he always keeps his appointments he has never failed to show up when he's called on the scene if you have need of him he can be there and and if you'll just call him up one time and say Lord I need your presence in my life then believe that he's going to come according to his word but see we call him on the scene Jesus we need your help and then we don't believe that he actually is going to come so that's why brother Brandon would say he is not recog when he's not recognized then his power is not revealed brother Brandon could stand there and and tell the people who they were what their names was but had brother brandham not recognized he was in the presence of the discerner then he could have never done that but you'll hear him stand at the pull pit and he'll say things like he's here now he recognized the presence came then he didn't have to worry about getting a name wrong or an address wrong the presence of God was there and that's the way it is today I don't have have to worry about what I'm preaching to you today if I feel the presence of God here and I know that he's here to vindicate his word it's not vindicating me and there's not any Vindication for any other preacher today V God Vindicated his man for the age but what we're standing here today we recognize the presence of God is here and when we move ourselves out of the way then God can show up and speak to your heart and your situation and whatever you have need of he is not going to leave you comfortless but he sent the Holy Spirit through the men of God to speak directly to your situation amen but what we've done is we've removed the presence of God and we've put it on a a mechanical device or we put it on something that that that is not in the word and if God's presence shows up it will always be according to his word can you say amen God is not going to come in another way outside of his word he didn't come and say well we're going to we're going to have church a certain way because we feel like it well outside the word of God God cannot vindicate the way you're doing it God will only vindicate the word of God by bringing it to pass and so when God shows up when his presence comes down now you can have an anointing you can feel God you could be in the Assembly of God church or you could be in this church or that church and I don't have a I don't say they don't feel the presence of God come by their way but what it is an anointing on the flesh but when there's no obedience to the word there right but when you come in obedience to the word then God can actually reveal his power through you by his presence and his word you can't take the two and separate them when Jesus was standing there he was the word and when Jesus was standing there he had the power in him see the word and the spirit were in the same place in the same body and so is it today if you are the body of Christ how many are today if you the body of Christ then the spirit and the word are in you and you can speak whatever you have need of so you got to believe it he said God Is Standing present you've got to believe it that's all the presence of God cannot be revealed to you if you don't believe it now we'll see here that in Matthew 16 and Matthew chapter 16:15 Peter believed and he had a revelation of who Jesus Christ was now some say you're this some say you're that but he had to have a revelation of who was actually standing there he had to know who the man was this was not just a man but this was this was Christ this was this was the man that God had spoken in the Old Testament to come and now he had come the prophecy had been fulfilled and he said in verse 15 he said said unto them who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now if you'll see there it took Revelation to know who Jesus was he had to recognize who Jesus was in order to be blessed by Jesus blessed art thou Peter blessed art thou why because he recognized who God was and if you'll just recognize his presence one time recognize his word that has come by and changed your life then God is going to say I'm going to bless you because you're the Seed of Abraham I want to pour my blessings out on you I want to pour my spirit out well come on somebody I want to pour my spirit on you you are a blessed people and a blessed generation why because you've recognized who you've come in contact with it's one thing to know there's something different in the room it's another thing to know what that different is it's another thing know Jesus actually showed up he came on time he came when he was called why because you've recognized him as more than just a fanatic spirit in the room you've you've you've realized that it's not just a feeling anymore it's not just an emotion that shows up but it is a lifechanging God that has come into the room and has changed your life Peter was in the same presence that the Pharisees and the Sadducees were in there was unbelievers and Believers that stood there every congregation can be a believer a make believer if you're sitting at home by yourself that's a hard one to swallow every congregation but that'd be Body Soul and Spirit right so we could be that way I guess I guess if you were just one person in the middle of the World by yourself you could still fulfill that quote but he said that's why we have people who can sit and brother brand goes on here let me let me skip down just a little bit half my time's gone God doesn't always move in that way he said the presence of God can uh can cause you to do this he said and and once in the presence of God you get quieted so the presence of God is not always in the same way if you see what he's saying here this is in a hidden life in Christ he said once in the presence of God you get quieted you're not tossed about by everything you know where you're standing there's something that happens you know that you're a real Christian you know know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you yeah Somebody Loves You somebody answers your prayers somebody told you you're going to make it somebody said you're mine and I won't lose one of them well did you hear what the pastor said this morning if you were elected of God you have a choice to make but the choice you make will be for God why because he knew the choice that you would make so we don't have to worry about it from God's point of view he don't even worry that you're going to be lost because he already knew the choices you would make thank you Lord now they they notice here when you're in the presence of Jesus something changes and something there is a power that is given you by the presence of Jesus brother brand says here in God's chosen place of worship he said look at Peter and John when they was questioned about healing a man at the gate beautiful he said they they perceived those priests did that they were both ignorant and unlearned men but they had taken notice that they had been with Jesus when you're in the presence of the Lord something changes even the countenance on your face could change you ever seen somebody get down at the altar and they went down there with an arrogant spirit and they get up they don't look so arrogant no more why because they've been crying they humbled themselves down at an altar somewhere they humbled themselves and I tell you humility will do us all some good because when you when you really humble yourself it'll change the very countenance on your face he said but they had taken notice they had been with Jesus because that they were doing the things that he did and if you're in contact with Jesus you will do what he does well come on somebody you will say what he said you will believe what he taught you to believe and you will not just say it with your lips but you will believe it with your heart and he said he said and he must be about the father's business they they knew that who they were because they were doing things that he did and he must be about the father's business and today it must be the same we must be about our father's business we must be doing what Jesus did we must he's saying what Jesus said well come on church God did not put you here just to be another person or just to be another church member but he put you here to do the same works that he did because why you are his body you are his hands you are his feet he has no hands but yours he has no feet but yours he has no mouth but yours but you are the body of Christ on the earth now and you are actually revealing Jesus Christ to the world you are the only presence of God some people ever feel why because you create a presence around you did you know that you are actually a little creator that that the room you walk into can change because of who you are because when you walk in somewhere you are not just another Christian but you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you have come in contact with the word of God you have come in contact with a lifechanging God and he has moved you from just another person just another church member to an eternal being come on somebody and there is actually a presence about you that is like the presence of God well how do we know that they knew they had been with Jesus because they did the works of Jesus so if you're doing the works of Jesus won't they look at you and say you've been with Jesus you're going to church like Jesus said you're you're doing everything he said to do well you say well Jesus didn't say it well the word is Christ and I we just go on down that road right there if Christ is his word and his word said go to church you're actually doing what Christ said by S here tonight you're actually doing what he said when you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but I want to take you back to the beginning for a minute and realize you've got to believe when you do it that it actually works or there's no reason to do it in the first place there's no reason to invite his presence in to a prayer line meeting and say we're going to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well there's no reason to do it if you don't believe he's going to show up and heal the people there's no reason to do it if you don't believe he's going to show up and vindicate his word to the people why it's not vindicating you it's not vindicating me but it is vindicating his word that was already spoken and you are the ones to vindicate his word you are prophecy fulfilled there's going to come a bride that won't fall and you are she brother B said you you know in the Old Testament to enter behind the skin was death to stay from behind it was death then to enter into his glory was death and now to stay away from his glory is death and and now listen to this he said now that happened of course at the Ring of the veil at Calvary when the veil was rent the old Veil now to stay out of his presence is death do we need his presence if you stay out of his presence it's death but to get into his presence I say there's life there's not just a little bit of life but there's eternal life there's fullness of joy there's there I'll tell you what there's a move of the spirit where Jesus is you say well how do we know Jesus is here did you invite him then believe he's here and we know he's going to show up because he keeps all of his appointments and he's always on time and he is a God not of yesterday not a god of history but he's a god of right now he's a god at 4:00 in the afternoon in Hardy Arkansas why because God has promised to show up why is there two or three here that believe he's coming is there two or three believe he's coming then he's got to be here well I don't feel him yet well he's already here but sometimes you got to reach out and say thank you for showing up on my behalf thank you for coming where you've been invited thank you for coming by my way because I needed healing here tonight thank you for coming by my way why just go ahead and start telling it thank you for coming even if you don't feel him here amen well I don't feel him in this service if you invited him believe he's coming and go ahead and worship him anyway because he promised to show up but you got to recognize his presence and you you may invite him and he may show up and you still don't know he showed up and what that is is that's the fact you're not in tune with the spirit of Christ and so we think it's got to be and I'm not against emotion you know that if you've heard me preach I I I I think I wish everybody here was running but that's not always the way his presence moves and it's okay it's okay to have a service where there's people sitting there and they're crying and there's tears running down their face and there's a a quiet Spirit on the audience that's okay if that's how he chooses to come we say thank you for showing up if he comes and it's just a a maybe a man standing here and maybe he's teaching the word to you did you know that's one way of him showing up because he is the word if the word's being preached how could he be away from his word if he is the word we're trying to take the spirit and the word and divide them divide them like stepchildren and we're trying to make one over here and one over here but let me tell you this God is always with his word if the true word is being preached across this Pulpit then God will stand here to back it up he will always accompany his message is that what he said now he said the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always in a time of decision thank you Lord now if we want life we know we've got to come into the presence of God how many know that to be true he said it's death to stay out of his presence so the opposite of death would be life so to stay away from his presence tonight is nothing but death oh so let us just for a few moments if I can I'm going to try to bring this down to a close but I want you to recognize tonight that whatever your situation is on life is in the building oh yeah whatever you feel tonight life is in the building however bad you feel life is is in the building do you need a touch from God life is in the building well come on somebody you've just got to believe it put your faith to work tonight and believe that he is and he will show up just like he said he would brother R said no man can be the same nothing can be the same when it once meets God you'll never be the same how many's met God here tonight then don't tell me that you can't make it you'll never be the same as what you were you may fall you may backslide you may go a million miles from the truth but that million miles is not too far for him to bring you back because he he's not going to lose you and you and I'll say this if you do go the presence of God will let you go so far and bring you right back why because the presence of God you've already been in contact with it and one time you may be out there sitting on a bar stool and the presence of God starts tugging at your heart and what happens then you recognize the presence of God because you've been in it before and and what was the definition of it it is something you've actually felt before it is recognizing it is like I know that I felt this before and you know it's something different from what the world offers well come on somebody you ever heard this rock concerts there's nothing about the presence of God in them there's nothing about the presence of God in country music out here today but when you've ever heard a song sang under the anointing power of God there is a presence of God that goes with that song and with that singer why because God is showing up to vindicate his own word he said God has always it's been that way and every time he come when Jesus was here the first time he said you whiten you garnish the walls and the tombs of the prophets and you put them in there he said see something happens and it passes by and God hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveals it to babes such as we learn and Jesus thanked the father for doing such that's in Luke 10:21 it goes right by the people and they don't know it come on somebody the presence of God unrecognized come on it's the presence of God that can be walking right down your aisle to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out demons and you don't realize he's there but if you just recognize it and believe it you don't have to have fear no more you don't have to have worry no more you don't have to have complexes no more because Jesus has walk down your [Music] Pew it goes right by the people and they don't know it for instance he said the Catholic people they took Jonah Arc in France and and and and and she had led a revolutionary in France but she was really a servant of Christ and he said what did your church do to her burn her at the stake as a witch because she had seen visions and was spiritual and the Catholic Church burner as a witch and he said a few years afterwards they found out that that woman was a saint so of course what they did was they dug up the priest's body who had burned her and they burnt them and so and they done great penants and and things like that he said they thrown him into the river of course and and done great penants for that for digging up the priest's body he said now in the days of the prophets that what happened they did the same thing they didn't recognize them till they had already done uh come and done the ministry and had finished and took out that elected and then after they were gone they recognized that there had been a prophet among them but it was too late and so what it is today many times you'll sit in a service on a Sunday afternoon or a Sunday morning morning or Wednesday night and Jesus comes by to heal you Jesus comes by to save you Jesus comes by to give forgiveness to your heart and make you repent but what do you do you don't recognize him until Monday morning and then you look back and say hey the presence of God was there and I failed to move and react to the presence of God but I'm I don't want you to miss the opportunity of reacting to the presence of God this afternoon if God has put a desire in your heart for an alter call you go to the altar there don't have to be man standing here saying you come to the Altar and beg you and pull you but if God has placed that desire that is the presence of God reaching out to you and bringing you forward God doesn't have to make you come up here and stand here for healing he don't have to push you to do it he don't pull you to do it through through me or any other man but there's something on the inside of you that knows you need to make a move for God but the reason you don't do it you don't really believe that the presence of God is what's working in your life but if you really believe that that is the presence of God that is tugging at your heart strings then what you need to do is react to that promise it's recognizing and then acting upon what you recognize to be the truth well come on somebody you felt that you've set in services and God has moved on your heart and said you need to be at the altar somewhere and you didn't do it did you know that every time you don't follow the leading of the Lord that voice gets quieter and quieter and quieter and every time that you actually heed to that voice then it actually re rejuvenates you and starts making you more in tune with that voice and then it makes you when you might be at the altar two services in a row well that ain't going to hurt nobody we're here to serve you we're here to help you we're here to let Sinners come back to Christ we're here to preach conviction to the hearts of the people we're here to let you know there is a living God in a living body and he's here today to do what he said to do he said I will be among you if there's two or three ga he's here but you just got to call him one time and say Lord your word's there I know you're here let me recognize your presence so I would say that many times we invite him and he's already here and and that's good he goes where he's invited but I want you to recognize many times all we have to do is just recognize he's already showed up you didn't have to invite Jesus if you were standing next to him and and invite Jesus say Jesus I need you to come and and do this and do that no you were standing there just ask what you will and it can and will be done why because you're already in the presence of Jesus brother said look at the priest when they see him Express themselves exactly in the word what he was saying they said it's a be elah what was it it was there there was no seed on the inside to respond to the word that was standing there and yet they had they had read the scroll they had read the prophecy here's the one to come and yet they don't want to actually come under subjection to the presence of God why because they couldn't be the same way anymore if they'd actually come under his presence you can't be the same person when you come under his presence I I want to get rid of this bitterness I want to get rid of this hate I say come in the presence of God and in the presence of God there is Joy there is peace there is healing well come on somebody there is everything you have need of in his presence am yes sir brother B said he said uh he said there was a prostitute woman there that he had met at the gate and told her expressed this this is the woman at the well he said and he told her what she had done and said she said well sir I perceive that you are a prophet now there's a difference right there one had come in contact with the presence of God and recognized the presence of God and the others had come in contact with God although more religious and may have been living a better life but they come in Pre in in contact with the presence of God and said fanaticism we don't need such a thing in our church we don't need a little shou and spell in church well come on somebody we don't need the spirit of God moving in our church no more what is it it is one that does not recognize that is the presence of God and another one is saying Lord I I perceive you're here I know you're here to do what you promis to do and that's when you can have healing that's when you can go testify to your neighbor that's when you can go back into the City and say come see what God is doing in Hardy Arkansas we're not trying to work something up we're trying not trying to make you do something or make you go here make you go there but I want to tell you this you need to get into the presence of God and let your life come under subjection to the word of God and let All Things become new in your life Let Your Attitude Change let your spirit change well come on somebody let your nature change it'll make you when you're when you're barking at somebody and growling at somebody it'll start make you it'll make you act like a dove it'll make you act like like you like somebody when you really don't why because your Nature has changed you're no longer going after somebody trying to hurt them but you're going after somebody trying to help them and bring them back because Jesus never went out and going into all the land and doing all manner of bad things but he went into the land and did all manner of good things he went to heal the sick and rais the dead and so will you do the same works that he did if you have his presence with you that's like saying Jesus can be here and not do the same Works no if he's here and in his body he will do the same works and he is here in his body that he has chosen to be in today Jesus said Jesus excuse me Jesus turned and said I am he that speaks with you there was no such an expression as be's above from this woman that's right she left her water pot ran into the City and said come see a man who told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah she recognized God showed up and did you know it was exactly according to the word of God the way he came it it was exactly according to the word of God and she recognized it to be the word of God revealing himself to her well come on somebody we have had the same Ministry a revealing of the son of man in this hour we don't have to wonder if it's right or wonder if it's wrong but if the spirit of Jesus Christ is in you it will it will back up the word of God that has come by the prophet of Malachi 4 with a great big amen why because it is thus sayith the the Lord it is a message that was sent to you you say well I don't believe it well let me go and tell you something if you'll read the scriptures the scriptures testify one to come amen if the scriptures testified of Jesus and the ones that turned him down had no seed and had no life in there to respond to him but there has to be a seed on the inside to believe what is being said to you if that woman would have been sitting there and he would have told her those things she would have said well you're a fortune teller you're a devil you come to tell me things that that that I already know I don't need to know that no but the attitude Changed by that woman she didn't no longer say I don't I don't I don't associate with you know she was one of them after that she was a woman chosen by God why because the seed was already there the belief was already on the inside but it had to be resurrected to Life by the word of God and the presence of Jesus so I say today you need the presence of God in your services again we do we need the presence of God back in the services and I believe if the word is being preached which we believe it is if the word is being preached then the presence of God will accompany the message so let's not come to church saying well I hope he shows up if the word's being preached say thank you Lord for coming by my way thank you for coming and Discerning my thought today and the word will discern your thought the word is the deserter of every situation in your life and he is here tonight to do whatever you need him to do you say well maybe if brother Brandon was here to say it no it's in you you are the bride that Jesus spoke of you are the ones that were called out by a prophet to say what a prophet said what did a prophet tell us he said in you would he said in her under your messenger in her would be the final voice to the final age and if you're speaking the same word that the prophet spoke then the same spirit that stood there and Vindicated his word will vindicate IND at your word if you're saying what he's saying I don't believe in putting your own interpretation to the message I don't believe in saying it how you want to say it I believe in saying it like a prophet said it and I'll tell you what I I believe God will honor that word and back it up with his presence every time amen sir brother said you know something another he said you know what I'm thinking friends I'm I'm not scolding the people I'll say the same I'm not scolding you he said but I want you to know one thing we got too much television in our lives well we'll let that sink in for a second we want entertainment yeah you know the television wasn't the problem so much as it made people want more entertainment right you want more entertainment I I watch you know some people don't have a TV and then they watch 10 movies a day I mean you know it's the same thing right and you got your phone out I don't watch TV but I got the app on my phone you know anyway I'm not preaching against TVs what I'm telling you is you're it's a distraction to get you away from the presence of God I don't care if it's the Sanctified Fox News it is still a distraction to get you away from the word of God I don't care if you're just watching a trump rally it is a distraction to get you away from the presence of God for all my Republican friends God bless you and CNN is the pits of hell but he said there's too much televisions we want entertainment God is not showing these things to entertain you God is not here to entertain you with his presence come on somebody God didn't come just to entertain the church you entertain God when he comes he don't entertain you that's the difference we want entertainment but what do you think he deserves entertain him say Lord come by my way I'll wash your feet with my tears I'll dry your feet with my hair oh come on somebody I'll do whatever you want me to do I will entertain you you don't have to entertain me with a good service you don't have to show up and make me speak in tongues you don't have to show up and make me jump all over the church well that be good yes that's good but let me tell you this God doesn't have to do nothing to prove that he already loves you God is all he's got to do is send you his word and all you have to do is respond by saying thank you for coming by my way thank thank you for showing up on a Sunday afternoon when I didn't deserve you but thank you for coming anyway how do we enter into the presence of God how do we approach the presence of God Psalms 100 verse1 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all you lands serve the Lord with gladness how many's glad today come before his presence with singing when you come in the presence of God sing with all your heart well come on somebody Make a Joyful Noise when you come before his presence and you know he's here see now you I don't feel him you know he's here because you brought him with you Jesus Is In Me Jesus is living in my heart little bitty kids will tell you that you adults know that right Jesus is in my heart well if you brought him to church with you recognize that you brought him and then worship him with all your heart serve the Lord with gladness come into His presence with singing and in and in verse four enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name we're entering into his courts we're coming into his Temple we're coming under oh come on somebody I feel like preaching to you for a moment God has showed up and all you got to do is give praises to Him and and bless the name of the Lord why because I don't feel like praising him let me raise my hand and praise him anyway I don't feel like shouting but let me shout anyway I don't feel like preaching a lot of time but let me preach until God shows up and vindicates his word is being preached Psalms 95:2 let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms you see how we're supposed to approach the presence of God we don't come gloomy we don't come halfway we don't come into His presence and sing with sadness we serve the Lord with what gladness we come before his presence with a sad face come on we're singing We Sing you know some people don't participate that's okay but whatever way it is that you want to enter into his presence do whatever it is that you can do whatever it is if it's just raising a hand you say well I I can't sing well do something to enter into his presence and do what he wants you to do entertain him why because we recognize if we're here then he's here amen that's as simple as it is that's good if you're sitting in this building with one or two other people and you're a Believer and you believe they're Believers and I think we've got at least three Believers in here me and my brother are two of them no and my wife yes and so we enter in here if you believe there's two other believers with you you know he's here so why would you come and say well I'm not sure he'll show up tonight have you ever went to a service and and I've said this I I'll say it well I just didn't really you know it just felt like there was a bad atmosphere tonight well maybe I created that bad atmosphere you are the creator of the atmosphere you bring to church come on somebody you are the creator of the atmosphere in your home you are the creator of the way the service goes because all it takes is one person to really in get in tune with the presence of God and recognize he's here I I've heard some people in this church that just let loose sometimes and Shout a little bit and it makes me feel better well I know we don't go by feeling but I like to feel him while he's here I like to know that the presence of the Lord is here but even if I don't feel it he's still here he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble he's always near you whenever you have need of him call him up and tell him what you want call his name on the scene Jesus and he's always there speak his word and he is in his word there he is brother said we want to be so big and wear some kind of big turned around colar and some kind of clothes you know that makes us look so holy and Reverend there is no Holiness with us we can't be holy Holiness is of God he said certainly it ain't a holy church come on somebody my church and your church have got the same problems even those of us to go to the same church you didn't know that that's right why because sin is always trying to creep its way in how many knows that Satan is always trying to come to church we reserve a seat for him on the front corner he's the most most faithful member you've got come on he never misses a service that's right Satan is always there but you realize how we put him under our feet is by recognizing that greater is he that is with us and in us than he that comes in and tries to defeat US during our services we don't have to give in to the bluff of the devil we don't have well come on somebody let me preach for a minute before I get out of here we don't have to give in and be a defeated people when we are supposed to come before his presence with gladness with singing with joy why because we know he will show up just exactly at 10:30 on Sunday morning on we don't have to change our times to see if he'll show up at another time why God is an everpresent help he's always on time he's always here he doesn't wait for you you he's he listen he doesn't have to wait for you to to come in here and say let's bring the presence of the go of God down now I know sometimes we don't feel him like we should but if you want to feel him all you have to do is recognize he's already here it don't go by feeling he's here anyway but if but you can feel him I want to get that to you tonight you don't have to sit here miserable you can feel the presence of God brother the same you can feel him when you're driving to church on Sunday morning morning you can feel him sitting on a 3:00 service and you've ate too much but the presence of God can still come on the scene and show up brother JT you can sit there not feeling good on a Sunday afternoon what why would you sit there and do that why because you're expecting the presence of God to meet with his people so you come to church anyway brother Bill said he may not feel like getting here on a Sunday morning but he comes anyway why because God promised to be where the people of God are and where the well come on somebody we might as well come to church and have a good time because if you set it home there's a there's you and the devil and you're sitting there and you're thinking well then bunch of Fanatics down there I heard somebody shout and scream out well it'll do you some good one time to scream out and say you know what I'm just going to let loose and let God have his way why because it doesn't matter how you felt when you come it doesn't matter how you feel when you leave God showed up recognizing while he's here come on it's God in the people it's not a holy church it's not a Holy Mountain it's God in the people can you say Amen Peter referred to the Mount Transfiguration the holy Mount he said it meant the holy God was on the mountain he said look at it he said it was a holy God there the presence of God what made it holy it's the presence of God in our midst now that brings Holiness oh yeah do we need Holiness yes the presence of God will bring it he said not my Holiness sir it's a prophet who I was would say lived a really really good life lived a life above reproach lived a life worthy of the Gospel he said it's not my presence he said it's not my presence that brings Holiness it's the presence of God he said it's not yours but it's his Holiness his presence what is what brings the Holiness oh I wish I could stand I I really do I wish I could stand in the presence of brother brandham and shake his hand and talk to him but that wouldn't do you any more good than the presence that's here right now woo well I'd like to be in the presence of the literal Corporal body of Jesus that wouldn't do you no more good than the presence that's here right now I'd like to be in the presence of Paul that won't do you any more good why because a commission was sent to this brother and this brother and this brother and you sisters he didn't say who he said go lay hands on the sick and they shall recover when you got a kid at home sick you mothers that's you you know that's your congregation you can put your hand on them and pray for that child and they can be healed why because it's the spirit of God in you just like it is in the preacher just like it is in the pastor just like it is in any man that's ever come that's been Vindicated they've had to come with the word of God and they have come to show you that God still lives brother Ram didn't come to to to reveal his own Ministry he come to reveal the son of man was was here and it wasn't the son of man but it was a son of man revealing the son of man why but it was the same God doing the same Works through a man to show that he can still do them through you do you know that brother random didn't come in vain I'm about done give me just I have two or three more minutes you know go brother Ram didn't come in vain he didn't come to show a gift and show that God still lived and go off the scene and leave us with nothing no he left us with the word that was to restore us back to the original church that went through the land doing the same works that Jesus did Brother R didn't come to point us to a future future type of church or a future type of come on somebody he didn't come and say we're going to change everything no he's going to restore us back to the way the church was at the beginning that's right amen so you want to know how we should act let's go back and look at how Jesus was and let's look at the first church and say how should we approach God the same way they did and God will move for you the same way that he did then why because it's the same presence of God in the same way working among his people sometimes I think we just get so down and so depressed because we don't realize who's in our midst we don't always have to call him on the scene he'll show up what brother Allan say I didn't pray he said I didn't didn't didn't have time to pray well Jesus is there anyway you know I I don't believe the disciples necessarily had to go wake him up he was in the boat they knew he was there so they could go talk to him but did you know he was in the boat so nothing could harm the boat if he's here in word form nothing can harm you if he's living in you it's not a closed book it's not a sealed up mystery anymore it is an opening of the word that is revealed that Christ is in you and his word is Christ Living in his people I I'm glad we don't serve a god of a sealed book anymore but we actually know what the word says we know what he said and we know what he does this stuff is falling everywhere we know who he is we know he's going to be here and we know he's here right now let me get on down here and Skip and I'll try to let you out he said the Wise Men followed no Observatory he said the Wise Men followed a star and no Observatory knows anything about it no one else saw it at all but those wise men because it was for them to see it they saw it it was real to them and he said when the light the pillar of fire smoke Paul down on the road to Damascus he recognized that he was in the presence of God now that Hebrew would never have called any other Spirit Lord but but but the but it was the same Pillar of Fire that had led his people out of the Wilderness he recognized it I've heard about that I recognize that's the same life that was with Moses you realize there's a group of people on the earth now that recognizes the same light came to a prophet that's Paul would have recognized this messenger you're put here for a purpose to recognize the messenger that came with a message to restore you back so you can recognize who you are he said and he said Paul he recognized that he was in the presence of God he said now that he would have never never would have known that had it not been the same one that was with Moses he said who are you and he said Saul why persecutest thou me and he said I am Jesus and Jesus said I come from God and I return to God and he was at that fire that was in the burning bush that led Moses and he said he returned back to that he said now here he was on the road down to Damascus and was stricken down and all the men that were with him they never saw that Pillar of Fire and it was so real that Paul it put his eyes out and he had to be led down the street called straight in Damascus he was blind he had to be led why this light this God himself come down and put his eyes out and it was it was Jesus in the in the light form and he said he went and laid he said and and he went and laid hands on him and and uh ananas a prophet down there saw in a vision went and laid hands on him and he received the Holy Ghost and the scales fell from his eyes and he could see again he said it was so real to him till it put his eyes out and yet none of the rest of them recognized it was there Oh my he said so it is tonight there is somebody sitting right here that can bring God on the scene when the brother will know and and the other brother will know nothing about it it's recognizing God God could be there to heal one and a person sitting next to him could not even feel the heal healing power of God in the building why you've got to recognize him when he comes it's important to know when he shows up it's important to reach out and touch him when you have need of him it's important to say you know what it's not by my might it's not by my power but it's by his Spirit sayith the lord it's whatever you say it's your word that can walk down the aisles it's your word that's in my heart it's your word that can change me from just a listener of the word to a doer of the same word why because God revealing himself through you as a Believer if the musicians would come I want to finish with this quote he said I know he is here it's him he promised him sir he is here in our midst he said oh how I love him he is wonderful how many feels that way tonight if you know he's in the midst can you say I love him you're wonderful he said it makes you feel good to know that we don't have to guess about it amen well come on somebody we don't go by feelings but the prophet said it makes you feel good when you don't have to guess about it we don't have to guess that that he might be here we don't have to feel that he's here but we can feel like he's here because we know he's here he said here he is identifying himself right in the word like he always has making it him not some Creed not some mythical something but the Living God himself how did he make himself known not down in Sodom but to Abraham and now to Abraham's seed how many Abraham seed are here he's not just making himself known to Abraham anymore but it's to you he's making himself known if you need healing he's here if you need deliverance from an addiction come on somebody if you needed a deliverance from just being to where you don't know if if God's even in your presence anymore if you need delivered from a dead spirit I say he's here tonight to deliver you from a dead Spirit he said how did he make himself known not down to Sodom but to Abraham and now to Abraham's seed and after him and it shows where Abraham seed he said oh my I feel really good right now thank let's stand to our feet how many loves the Lord tonight how many believes he's here and if you have a need tonight you know he's here all you got to do is reach out and say Lord I believe you're here come by my way if you just play something how do you know that why didn't we recognize do you know that song you know see if you can play that play that if you've got a need tonight I won't I won't hold you I don't want to make you stay any longer than we have to but I want to just give you an opportunity now if you have a need tonight and you need to come to the altar tonight or if you need somebody to lay hands on you we don't even have to pray for you if you need hands laid on you tonight could be your night amen if you recognize he's here it's important to recognize when all else fails Give Me Jesus we don't want to be like the men that were walking with him and didn't know it was him let's recognize him when he's there he was speaking words of life to him he was speaking words that that sounded familiar but they didn't know it was Jesus and yet here tonight we have the word that told us he will always show up and brother Brandon would come and say Jesus keeps all his appointments did you have an appointment with Jesus tonight then he's here to meet your need oh yeah but you got to recognize it I say like this why didn't we recognize when he showed up in our services why don't go tomorrow and say Lord why didn't I recognize you came by my way yesterday why didn't I Just Surrender my heart to you then I'm going to battle you for another week no let the battle be done with and let the Lord take control in your life [Music] today if you got a need on your heart with your heads bowed your eyes closed let's just pray to him right now if you have a need you're welcome to come or you can right where you're sitting you're more than welcome to put your hand up to him or you don't have to leave defeated I want you to know that tonight if you really believe he's here it's not my presence it's not your pastor's presence it's not anybody else in this building it's not brother Stewart or any brother that would preach here in the building but what it is is the presence of God and I say we need to recognize him while he's here church let us be changed while he shows up let's not let any service pass by without saying Lord I want to feel you more I want to know you more I want to love you more oh I say why didn't we recognize Lord Jesus you see this Congregation of people here tonight and Lord I pray you would send a special blessing upon them now Lord Lord they believe that you're here they believe you're able to do the work in their lives Lord God I pray I pray you would come in a special way Lord and anoint every person that's sitting here Lord Lord don't let them leave and Lord being defeated and don't let them say Lord I wish you to come by my way Lord you're here walking up and down every aisle Lord may they reach out right now and find out that you are God and you change not you're the same yesterday today and forever and if you healed one you're still healing if you saved one you can still save if you delivered a bitter Spirit you can deliver a bitter Spirit here tonight Lord I pray you would come by the way of these people Lord Lord come by my way and Lord if there's something in my life Lord I pray you would take it away from me Lord every one of us here
