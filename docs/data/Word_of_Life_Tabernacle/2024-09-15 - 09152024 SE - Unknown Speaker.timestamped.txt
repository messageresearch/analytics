[1:23:35] for you if you take his word he said
[1:23:39] there's one thing I
[1:23:42] know I'm circumcised I'm an Israelite he
[1:23:46] is an uncircumcised Philistine I know
[1:23:50] that I'm
[1:23:52] right and that no so gave him the
[1:23:55] strength or the

[1:24:03] outnumbered I know he's got he's bigger

[1:25:12] faith when you use that faith on him
[1:25:15] Satan will have to back up Hallelujah
[1:25:20] and we see that's exactly what shamgar
[1:25:23] did
[1:25:25] he wasn't a
[1:25:28] warrior he didn't go get training all he
[1:25:31] said there's one thing I know I'm
[1:25:35] circumcised I'm an Israelite and then
[1:25:38] this promise belongs to me this grain
[1:25:41] belongs to me these promises belong to
[1:25:46] me can we have a sham guard tonight
[1:25:50] regardless of your feelings regardless
[1:25:52] of circumstances
[1:25:54] shamgar begin to think shamgar begin to
[1:25:58] think maybe sitting in a church service
[1:26:00] just like this shamgar begin to
[1:26:02] think this is for me and he could hear
[1:26:05] the footsteps of the enemy coming in
[1:26:09] just like sometimes that you do and I do
[1:26:12] the enemy's coming in like a flood but
[1:26:15] there's one thing I know when the enemy
[1:26:18] comes in like a flood my Lord Jesus
[1:26:22] lifts a standard against him
[1:26:25] and Sham go said there's one thing I
[1:26:28] know maybe the preacher was preaching
[1:26:31] about the same thing and he was telling
[1:26:33] about David and how David said a
[1:26:36] thousand can come this side and fall to
[1:26:38] this side 10,000 at this
[1:26:42] hand but it cannot come nigh unto thee
[1:26:46] and maybe he was rehearsing those words
[1:26:47] brother Mike in his head have you ever
[1:26:49] done that how many's been going through
[1:26:51] a trial and all of a sudden a song Dr
[1:26:54] drops in your heart or a message drops
[1:26:56] in your heart you go begin to put you
[1:26:59] you begin to find that message on your
[1:27:01] phone or your tablet or your computer
[1:27:03] and you begin to say oh man thank the
[1:27:05] Lord let's let's begin to listen things
[1:27:07] that are to be and you begin to push
[1:27:09] play and all of a sudden he might have
[1:27:11] preached that message 40 50 years ago
[1:27:14] but our God In His Infinite mind before
[1:27:17] the foundation of the world was
[1:27:19] orchestrating that message just for you
[1:27:22] and your trial and then your
[1:27:24] circumstances come on somebody that's
[1:27:27] one thing I know God works in your past
[1:27:30] lives in your your present working in
[1:27:33] your future he's got all things in his
[1:27:39] control and maybe that's what shamgar
[1:27:41] did he be to listen and all of a sudden
[1:27:45] something his righteous indonation begin
[1:27:47] to build up he began to get so mad at
[1:27:51] that demon that keeps tormenting his
[1:27:53] home taking his food tormenting his
[1:27:56] children taking clothes off his
[1:27:59] children's back am been taking
[1:28:01] everything from his sweetheart his wife
[1:28:03] there was something begin to build up
[1:28:05] not today devil not today devil oh if we
[1:28:09] could have that same attitude tonight
[1:28:11] amen not today devil you're not taking
[1:28:14] my joy today devil you're not taking my
[1:28:16] praise today devil and something began
[1:28:20] it wasn't a fairy tale when these these
[1:28:22] Bible stories is not fair fairy tales
[1:28:24] the reality they men of God that took
[1:28:29] God at his
[1:28:32] word and all shamgar had I'm not a
[1:28:36] warrior I had no training but this one
[1:28:39] thing I know I'm
[1:28:43] circumcised my name is in the book Oh
[1:28:48] Glory there's one thing I know
[1:28:50] tonight I've been notified
[1:28:55] the the the
[1:28:57] wheel the Seal's been broken off the
[1:29:01] wheel and the executive the Holy Spirit
[1:29:05] has come in this hour to notify me this
[1:29:09] one thing I
[1:29:12] know I might be a failure here I might
[1:29:16] be a failure in my spirit but down
[1:29:18] inside my soul amen is's a seal of
[1:29:22] Promise the world world didn't give it
[1:29:24] and the world can't take it away I know
[1:29:27] I'm sealed to the day of my
[1:29:32] Redemption and maybe brother Harvey he
[1:29:34] kept fighting the battle he kept
[1:29:36] fighting and Waring against his flesh
[1:29:39] his flesh was saying there's no need to
[1:29:40] go down there they're going to take your
[1:29:42] meal you can need allow them to do it
[1:29:44] now or go down there and get whipped
[1:29:46] like a a wet puppy amen go down there
[1:29:48] and get whipped and crawling back to
[1:29:50] your
[1:29:51] family but there was something down in
[1:29:53] his soul was burning and speaking a
[1:29:56] different story hallelujah amen that
[1:30:00] story was telling him go to the enemy's
[1:30:02] Camp take back what belongs to you you

[1:30:21] hit in his name it can never
[1:30:26] fa and I can see shamgar
[1:30:31] bubbling maybe like brother Ram would
[1:30:33] say about Caleb that hooknose Jew
[1:30:36] bouncing up and down getting excited
[1:30:38] about what the Lord is doing getting
[1:30:41] excited about the move of God and man no
[1:30:43] doubt brother Harold maybe shamgar begin
[1:30:47] to see it not by natural eyes but by
[1:30:51] faith and that Faith brought a substance
[1:30:54] and he begin to see it it became a
[1:30:57] reality to him and he brother Stuart he
[1:31:00] be to see soldiers laying everywhere
[1:31:02] dead
[1:31:04] destroyed cuz hope wasn't talking any
[1:31:06] longer Fai was on the inside looking out
[1:31:09] and declaring to shamard your battle is
[1:31:13] already over the victory has been
[1:31:18] won Hallelujah and here come the enemy
[1:31:22] in like a flood
[1:31:26] they had big
[1:31:27] helmets they had big shields they had
[1:31:31] big sh swords maybe they had big horses
[1:31:35] maybe they had big names maybe they was
[1:31:38] Presidents maybe they was great warriors
[1:31:41] it didn't matter who they were it didn't
[1:31:43] matter what artillery they had it didn't
[1:31:46] matter one thing cuz brother Bown said
[1:31:49] when Moses struck with that Rod it
[1:31:52] wasn't Moses striking it was God
[1:31:54] striking why cuz he wasn't going on his
[1:31:57] own ability his own thinking he was
[1:31:59] going on a
[1:32:00] noo God told him to do it and Moses done
[1:32:03] it and God backed it
[1:32:06] up and
[1:32:08] shamgar had a Pentecostal
[1:32:11] Jubilee and a Revival came to his house
[1:32:14] and no doubt his wife said shamgar
[1:32:16] you're losing your
[1:32:17] mind you ain't got no gun you ain't got
[1:32:21] no sword he said but I got an ox
[1:32:24] goat what are you going to do with that
[1:32:26] Ox goat I don't know but something
[1:32:29] inside of me says go down to the enemy's
[1:32:32] Camp go down and start swinging and the
[1:32:35] spirit of God said I'm going to do the
[1:32:37] West Church I'm here to declare to you
[1:32:41] when shamgar jumped out of that window
[1:32:43] and ran down to the enemy amen they
[1:32:45] thought the game was over amen they
[1:32:48] probably begin to think who's coming in
[1:32:50] it probably sounded like a rushing
[1:32:52] Mighty Wind Maybe sounded like when
[1:32:54] Gideon and his few hundred men was taken
[1:32:57] over down there that
[1:33:00] day and all of a
[1:33:03] sudden maybe it's just like some of
[1:33:05] these young people tend to take what
[1:33:07] they had in their hand it doesn't take
[1:33:11] much it doesn't take much all it takes
[1:33:14] is a mighty hand of God behind the swing
[1:33:17] and every time shamgar
[1:33:20] swung God swung with him and begin to
[1:33:24] hit every enemy that he struck he was
[1:33:28] destroying I'm here to tell you sham
[1:33:31] guard defeated hundreds and hundreds
[1:33:35] upon hundreds of well trained well
[1:33:40] equipped Army a
[1:33:43] Onan Invasion oh I'm here to tell you
[1:33:46] tonight that we're the Life Tabernacle
[1:33:48] amen one person tonight can stir a
[1:33:51] Revival in the camp if you can take what
[1:33:54] you got in your hand say I'm a housewife
[1:33:57] it doesn't matter amen take what you got
[1:34:00] and begin to beat their heads in in the
[1:34:03] name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in
[1:34:07] the name of Jesus have you ever tried it
[1:34:09] I know one thing there's power in the
[1:34:12] name of
[1:34:16] Jesus Hallelujah don't you love the
[1:34:20] Lord and he says
[1:34:25] they claim claim your god-given
[1:34:27] privilege and beat their heads in get
[1:34:30] out of the way Satan kick him out of the
[1:34:34] way kick him out of the
[1:34:36] way I'm the guy that's taking over now

[1:34:42] enough but I'm coming with an ox go

[1:34:46] situation in my home I come in Jesus
