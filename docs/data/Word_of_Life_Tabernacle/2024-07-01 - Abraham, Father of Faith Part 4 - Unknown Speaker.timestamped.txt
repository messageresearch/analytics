[46:09] the people Lord with that his Blessing
[46:11] to the word you may be seated I want to
[46:14] speak to you
[46:15] tonight on saving
[46:18] pennies saving
[46:21] pennies brother Harvey's favorite
[46:25] subject you know
[46:28] Abraham was given a promise that he
[46:32] would be a possessor of all things all
[46:36] things mzc identified him as a possessor
[46:41] of all things and I think that's good
[46:43] enough Genesis 14:18 look at this mzc
[46:46] king of Salem brought forth Bread and
[46:49] Wine and he was the high priest of the
[46:51] most high God and he blessed him and
[46:53] said Blessed Be Abram of the most high
[46:56] God possessor of Heaven and Earth
[47:00] possessor of Heaven and Earth listen if
[47:04] he identified him as a possessor then we
[47:07] know that Abram was no matter whether he
[47:10] looked like he was or not it looked like
[47:13] he was a nomad he was living in a in a
[47:15] tent he was traveling from one place to
[47:18] another but he didn't go by by sight he
[47:21] went by faith and by faith Abraham
[47:24] possessed all things someone say all
[47:27] things tonight all things Abraham
[47:29] possessed all things and ozdic
[47:32] identified him as that listen just
[47:34] because you have trials in your life
[47:36] just because you have tests in your life
[47:38] just because your journey is not linear
[47:41] it doesn't just go in One Direction Just
[47:43] because you failed or you've Fallen
[47:45] doesn't mean that you're not a possessor
[47:47] of all things it just means you need to
[47:49] walk more into it you need to step up
[47:51] higher you need to start doing what's
[47:53] right you say well I've done what's
[47:54] wrong start today start doing what's
[47:56] right
[47:57] you don't know how your life might be
[48:00] changed just because you have trials and
[48:03] tests does not mean you're not a
[48:04] possessor listen to Paul in 2
[48:06] Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 7 he
[48:08] said by the word of Truth by the power
[48:10] of God by the armor of righteousness on
[48:12] the right hand and on the left he said
[48:14] by Honor and dishonor by evil report and
[48:17] good report as deceivers and yet true as
[48:20] unknown and yet well known as dying and
[48:23] behold we live as chastened and not
[48:26] killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[48:30] as poor yet making many rich as having
[48:33] nothing and yet possessing all things
[48:36] Paul says even when I got nothing I
[48:38] still got him and I'm a possessor of all
[48:41] things I think every one of us can say
[48:42] Amen to that
[48:45] tonight amen lot has been taken captive
[48:48] by enemies of
[48:50] Sodom and there was a lack of Separation
[48:54] in his life because if he had if he had
[48:57] been like Abraham had he been a a True
[49:00] Believer who stayed away from that thing
[49:03] it would have his life would have never
[49:04] went to captivity like it did and yet he
[49:07] had a place in the economy of God and so
[49:09] it was a lack of Separation that led to
[49:11] that captivity in Genesis 1411 they took
[49:14] all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah all
[49:17] their victuals and went their way and
[49:19] they took lot Abram's brother's son who
[49:22] dwelt in Sodom in his goods and departed
[49:26] the brand said oh what what a horrible
[49:27] thing the wages of sin is death lot
[49:31] realized on doubt walking around there
[49:33] maybe with a rope or a chain around his
[49:35] neck it must have really must have
[49:37] really affected him here he is he once
[49:39] he had his freedom once he was up there
[49:41] with Abraham once he once he had become
[49:43] a very wealthy man with Abraham he he
[49:46] was somebody who who uh traveled with
[49:49] him and now even in Sodom he become the
[49:51] mayor of the city but now he had a rope
[49:53] around his
[49:54] neck sin always leads to that it always
[49:58] leads to that the wages of sin is death
[50:01] lot realized no doubt walking around
[50:03] there maybe with a Roper chain around
[50:04] his neck as a slave his children young
[50:06] girls to be ravished his wife and
[50:08] everything probably die at any time if
[50:10] he disobeyed one order maybe going into
[50:12] another kingdom somewhere to be a slave
[50:14] the rest of his days but Abraham I love
[50:17] this you see we can't go into Savory
[50:21] with lot we got to deliver lot from
[50:25] Savory right place is on the mountain
[50:28] our place is in the message of the hour
[50:31] our position is in Heavenly places we
[50:33] don't go into slavery with lot but what
[50:36] do we do we deliver lot from slavery by
[50:40] staying with the word by staying with
[50:42] the son of man Ministry by staying with
[50:44] the prophet that's how we deliver them
[50:46] from slavery now now watch Abraham when
[50:49] he found out that lot had been taken
[50:51] that was part of Abraham's
[50:54] possession and oh God he said and
[50:57] Abraham might have said this God you
[51:00] told me if I would obey you and walk in
[51:02] here in this land you would give this to
[51:04] me it belongs to me and lot's part of
[51:07] this and I'm going after him glory he
[51:10] said this is part of my possession he
[51:12] may not believe like I he may not be
[51:14] what I am but it's part of what is
[51:16] mine so I'm going after
[51:19] him now as the elect of God what should
[51:24] our mindset be towards those who are in
[51:26] cap activity of sin or even the
[51:29] backslider who even even let's say that
[51:32] they're not the elect we don't know who
[51:34] is and who isn't what should our mindset
[51:37] be toward those people now we you church
[51:43] we we've got to understand that the
[51:44] Bible is written for a reason and
[51:47] there's things that were told for a
[51:48] reason because there are those who are
[51:51] in captivity but they love their
[51:53] captivity right and that's why Jude says
[51:56] there some you can have compassion on
[51:58] and make a difference and others you
[52:01] save by fear he's not saying that you
[52:02] use fear to save them he's saying that
[52:05] you you don't you you be careful that
[52:07] you're not partaker of their sin right
[52:09] right you don't want to become a
[52:10] partaker of that and you realize that
[52:12] that in that condition they could hurt
[52:14] you listen when Saul was in a condition
[52:18] uh uh before he got met the pillar of
[52:20] fire any Christian come by his path
[52:23] didn't do him any good but what did it
[52:25] do to him it it actually caused him to
[52:27] be more of a persecutor he threw him in
[52:30] prison he met lots of Christians he
[52:31] threw him in prison he killed him he he
[52:33] did all kinds of stuff to him so you
[52:36] couldn't help Saul in that condition he
[52:38] needed to meet God he had to be called
[52:40] by God just like you were and yet after
[52:44] he had been called by God it was ananas
[52:47] who went down had a vision you remember
[52:49] and he told him to go down there and
[52:50] meet Paul he said won't he throw me in
[52:52] prison hasn't he done all these things
[52:53] he said but I've called him to be my
[52:55] Prophet yes sir
[52:57] right so there's there's a time and a
[52:59] place for those things there are those
[53:00] who are in captivity but they love it
[53:01] and I'll say this if you want to be
[53:03] saved you can be saved if you want to
[53:07] but you got to want to and you got to be
[53:10] willing to do what it takes right John
[53:12] said bring forth fruits meat for
[53:14] repentance what does that mean it
[53:15] doesn't mean you can save yourself it
[53:17] means that you'll you'll take the action
[53:20] necessary to
[53:22] surrender right you'll take the
[53:23] necessary action to surrender if you
[53:26] don't ever raiseed the White Flag you
[53:28] can't help it if the if the battle
[53:30] continues but if you'll raise the the
[53:32] white flag and walk forward and say I'm
[53:35] giving up this is it then God can do
[53:37] something in your
[53:39] life brother Bram talked about a man in
[53:42] Portland that wanted to bring harm to
[53:45] him and he come out of he was uh the the
[53:48] manic he called him in Portland and come
[53:51] out of insane asylum and he wanted to do
[53:53] harm to him and he he was threatening
[53:55] God's people in God's prophet and they
[53:58] asked him they said is he healed and he
[54:01] said this I said no sir he worships that
[54:04] Spirit no way of helping him at all
[54:07] until he gets that out of his head I
[54:09] said but I wish you would roll him off
[54:11] my feet so I can
[54:13] move and who did that the policeman did
[54:16] that right that were there to protect
[54:18] the meeting but he said what was it did
[54:20] I hate that man I loved him a poor
[54:22] mortal in that condition that wasn't
[54:24] that man speaking it was the devil he
[54:26] was possessed of the devil and the devil
[54:28] made the challenge and the Holy Spirit
[54:30] challenged him
[54:31] back right but see that type of person
[54:34] you couldn't help but look at the
[54:35] difference in that man and the maniac of
[54:37] gadera in Mark 5 and verse one it says
[54:41] they came over onto the other side of
[54:42] the sea into the country of the gines
[54:44] and when he was come out of the ship
[54:46] immediately there met him out of the
[54:47] tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who
[54:50] had his dwelling among the tombs and no
[54:52] man could bind him no not with change
[54:54] this man is is is is completely given
[54:57] over Bound by enemies but he doesn't
[54:59] want to
[55:00] be are you with me now he doesn't want
[55:03] to be he he's got a thousand demons but
[55:06] he doesn't want those
[55:08] Devils so he can be
[55:10] delivered glory to God look at him he
[55:13] he's dwelling among the tombs no man
[55:15] could bind him because that he'd been
[55:17] often bound with feathers and chains and
[55:19] the chains have been plucked a thunder
[55:20] by him and the feathers broken in pieces
[55:22] neither could any man tame him always
[55:24] night and day he was in the mountains
[55:25] and the tombs crying cutting himself
[55:27] with stones but when he saw Jesus a far
[55:30] off he ran and worshiped him when he saw
[55:33] Jesus AAR off he didn't come and and say
[55:36] I'm going to knock you down or I'm going
[55:38] to hit you or something but he said I
[55:39] run and worshiped him and he cried with
[55:41] a loud voice and said what have I to do
[55:44] with thee Jesus thou son of the most
[55:45] high God I adure Thee by God that thou
[55:48] torment me not for he said unto him come
[55:50] out of the man thou unclean spirit and
[55:52] he asked him what is thy name and he
[55:54] answered my name is Legion for are many
[55:57] but you know what he got his
[55:59] Deliverance they found him clothed in
[56:01] his right mind and the demons went off
[56:04] in the swine ran off and jumped in
[56:06] jumped off the cliff right but look the
[56:08] man wanted to be well but demons had
[56:11] control of his body listen if you want
[56:13] to be well there's no demon that can
[56:15] stand in the way of the power of
[56:18] God yes sir but you don't know what I've
[56:21] done no I don't but he
[56:24] does and if he's called calling you
[56:26] answer that call 1 Peter 5:7 casting all
[56:31] your care upon him for he careth for you
[56:33] brother Brown picks that up and he takes
[56:35] the the question he asks the question he
[56:37] cares do you care yeah listen what
[56:40] brother Brandon says about Legion he
[56:41] said he cared when the neurotic called
[56:43] Legion cared enough under opposition to
[56:47] wiggle out from under those tombstones
[56:49] of devils and go out to meet Jesus and
[56:52] throw himself prostrate when Legion them
[56:55] Devils would have never come if Legion
[56:56] hadn't have pushed his way out there to
[56:58] meet him and when he cared enough to
[57:00] make that effort that stand in his
[57:02] belief Jesus cared enough to cast out
[57:05] this Legion of devils from him and his
[57:07] neurotic condition was gone he cared he
[57:09] said when you care oh I'm so glad I'm so
[57:13] glad when we make an effort to reach to
[57:15] him he he cares and why do we make that
[57:17] effort because there's something inside
[57:18] of us to do
[57:20] that that's lot was just a penny but he
[57:23] was Abraham's
[57:24] Penny hard to part with your
[57:27] pennies and Abraham was a spiritually
[57:29] Frugal
[57:31] man he didn't want to give up his
[57:33] Penny are you with me now brother
[57:36] Brandon said he was just a penny in in
[57:38] economy of God see our our sons and
[57:40] daughters belong to us
[57:44] right it belong to us I don't mean that
[57:46] in the sense that they were they're some
[57:48] kind of slaves or something like that
[57:49] although my children may feel like that
[57:51] sometimes but they belong to us I'm not
[57:55] going to let them go go I'm not going to
[57:58] let him not be saved that ain't it's not
[58:00] going to happen brother man how can you
[58:02] say that well because I believe that the
[58:05] God was that was big enough to save me
[58:07] is big enough to save my children big
[58:09] enough to save the the the back Sider
[58:12] that belongs to us the backslider that
[58:14] used to sit in the house of God he's big
[58:16] enough to save that person it may be by
[58:19] us having compassion it may be by by him
[58:22] knocking him off of his high horse but
[58:25] somehow somehow God will reach
[58:27] out those children who were raised in
[58:30] church but no longer serve God they
[58:32] belong to us we don't have that attitude
[58:35] and we've seen so many begin to come
[58:37] back and begin to make steps and and I
[58:39] was asked they said they said I don't
[58:41] even know what to do or or what first
[58:43] step to make is said just keep doing
[58:45] what you're doing come to the house of
[58:46] God sit under the atmosphere of God
[58:48] start doing what's right and and pretty
[58:50] soon you begin to see your life change
[58:53] just sit under the preaching of the word
[58:55] it'll wash you if you'll sit under it
[58:58] yes sir let the Holy Ghost begin to call
[59:02] you to repentance and to the baptism of
[59:04] the Holy
[59:05] Ghost look they belong to us we
[59:09] shouldn't give up on them easily Moses
[59:11] in Egypt when after all the plagues and
[59:14] things that happened and and and
[59:16] Pharaoh's down there just just he just
[59:19] hates to give up you know he's a very
[59:20] very stubborn man and Pharaoh just hates
[59:23] to give up and and God hardened his
[59:25] heart
[59:27] and we find that Moses and Aaron in
[59:28] Exodus 108 were brought again to Pharaoh
[59:30] he said un them go serve the Lord your
[59:32] God but who are they that shall go and
[59:34] Moses said we will go with our young and
[59:38] with our
[59:40] old oh if we can make this kind of a
[59:42] commitment towards the Rapture of the
[59:44] church we will go with our young and
[59:48] with our old amen we're not going to
[59:50] leave out the youngest person sitting
[59:51] here we're not going to leave out our
[59:53] elders sitting in the back we're not
[59:54] going to leave out nobody yes sir we
[59:57] will go with our young and with our old
[59:59] with our sons and with our daughters
[1:00:01] with our flocks and with our herds we
[1:00:04] will go for we must hold a feast of the
[1:00:06] Lord we're taking all of them we're not
[1:00:07] leaving Joy behind we're not leaving
[1:00:09] happiness behind we're not going to give
[1:00:11] one inch to the devil if God said we can
[1:00:13] have church in in in a certain way we're
[1:00:15] going to have church in that way if God
[1:00:17] said we can enjoy the house of God we're
[1:00:19] going to enjoy the house of God we're
[1:00:20] not going to let one devil get between
[1:00:22] us and the power of
[1:00:24] God we're going to take what belongs to
[1:00:27] us and what belongs to us everything we
[1:00:30] can
[1:00:31] see praise God hallelujah now look we're
[1:00:36] taking all them Exodus 10:24 and Pharaoh
[1:00:38] called to Moses and said go ye serve the
[1:00:41] Lord only let your flocks and your herds
[1:00:44] be stayed let your little ones also go
[1:00:47] with you he said you have your kids just
[1:00:48] leave your flocks and herds
[1:00:50] behind huh but see he knew that they
[1:00:53] couldn't last long in the desert without
[1:00:54] their flocks and herds
[1:00:57] right he wanted to give them something
[1:00:57] to come back to and Moses said thou must
[1:01:01] give us also sacrifices and burnt
[1:01:03] offerings that we may sacrifice to the
[1:01:05] Lord Our God our cattle also shall go
[1:01:07] with us there shall not a hoof be left
[1:01:10] behind Heen not a hoof be left thereof
[1:01:14] must we take to serve the Lord Our God
[1:01:16] and we know not with what we must serve
[1:01:18] the Lord until we come there they said
[1:01:20] we're going to take all of it but the B
[1:01:23] said what do he want to do leave
[1:01:24] something back there so they knew that
[1:01:26] they'd come back for it he said that's
[1:01:27] what Pharaoh the devil's still saying to
[1:01:29] the children leave something behind so
[1:01:32] you got something to go back to I say
[1:01:34] God calls for a total separation he
[1:01:36] calls for a complete
[1:01:38] deliverance don't leave something back
[1:01:40] there to go back to we're we're going
[1:01:43] we're going in we're taking everything
[1:01:44] with
[1:01:45] us he wasn't ashamed of the Gospel he
[1:01:49] believed the gospel was for the children
[1:01:52] too right am some of y'all can say
[1:01:56] amen the gospel's for the children too
[1:02:00] you believe that is that not a is that a
[1:02:01] true
[1:02:02] statement right now gospel for the
[1:02:04] children too Moses walked up before
[1:02:05] Pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell him
[1:02:07] that they would not compromise and take
[1:02:10] his so many days out in the wilderness
[1:02:11] he said some of the women stay by your
[1:02:13] children said we'll all go not even one
[1:02:15] hoof will be left behind we'll take our
[1:02:17] cattle and all he wasn't ashamed why he
[1:02:19] had come in the light of
[1:02:21] Deliverance he said that's the reason a
[1:02:23] man or a woman sick or anything once
[1:02:24] comes to the presence of God and knows
[1:02:26] that God has healed him you're stepping
[1:02:28] into the light of
[1:02:30] Deliverance amen you don't compromise on
[1:02:33] anything right you're never going to be
[1:02:35] able to serve God halfway you might as
[1:02:37] well just give in and serve him all the
[1:02:39] way you might as well you be happier
[1:02:42] anyhow you so I just I'm afraid I won't
[1:02:44] be happy living like a Christian if
[1:02:46] you're a seed of God you won't ever be
[1:02:47] happy living like the devil you won't
[1:02:49] ever be happy living halfway between the
[1:02:51] church and the world you might as well
[1:02:53] come on in where the blessings of God
[1:02:55] are
[1:02:56] might as well step on into the to the
[1:02:59] presence of
[1:03:00] God Amen he said you're stepping into
[1:03:03] the light of Deliverance you don't
[1:03:04] compromise on anything Deliverance was
[1:03:06] in his heart for he had met The God Who
[1:03:07] said I'm the god of Abraham who give
[1:03:09] Abraham the promise and the time time of
[1:03:12] Deliverance is at hand I'm sending you

[1:03:55] apologize about that Pharaoh could have
[1:03:57] killed him he was just a man he was a
[1:03:59] slave he could have killed him but he
[1:04:01] wasn't ashamed of that word he didn't
[1:04:03] come down get on his knees and beg to
[1:04:04] Pharaoh for nothing he said I come to
[1:04:06] take them Pharaoh said well you can't
[1:04:08] take them he said all right then there
[1:04:09] will be fleas on the earth till you Wade
[1:04:11] through
[1:04:13] them amen amen there's what happened
[1:04:17] said oh Moses take them away he said all
[1:04:18] right he said now do you repent said
[1:04:20] well you can go so many days in the
[1:04:21] wilderness he said them flies will come
[1:04:24] and said Darkness will come it was so so
[1:04:25] dark he said you couldn't see one place
[1:04:27] to the other and finally death come from
[1:04:30] pharaoh to the servant it was death for
[1:04:31] the oldest child in the family listen
[1:04:34] brother B said didn't have no apology to
[1:04:36] nobody he was a son of Abraham born in
[1:04:39] the spirit of God given commission by
[1:04:41] God the message of God to go down and
[1:04:43] take those people out sir listen he said
[1:04:45] well can't God call the same thing in
[1:04:47] this hour to take out of the church a
[1:04:49] bride I believe he called a prophet in
[1:04:51] this hour that wasn't ashamed of the
[1:04:53] message and he's called men of God to
[1:04:55] standing the P but that's not ashamed of
[1:04:57] it
[1:04:58] either Hallelujah not ashamed of the
[1:05:01] gospel because the gospel is
[1:05:03] effective it
[1:05:06] works can I just can I just be honest
[1:05:10] with you it
[1:05:11] works you say well it didn't work for so
[1:05:13] and so I know it worked they didn't work
[1:05:17] but it
[1:05:18] worked it works every time it's tried
[1:05:21] you said well brother so- and so failed
[1:05:23] it didn't work for him or sister so and
[1:05:24] so failed it didn't work for her well it
[1:05:26] worked when they
[1:05:30] repented that's a bigger that that
[1:05:32] that's a bigger evidence to me that the
[1:05:34] gospel works and when a person always
[1:05:36] does right and always does the right
[1:05:37] things when a person falls and then they
[1:05:39] repent and they're able to come all the
[1:05:41] way back don't you realize that's
[1:05:42] evidence it
[1:05:45] works the gospel is effective Romans
[1:05:48] 1:14 Paul says I'm dead both to the
[1:05:51] Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the
[1:05:53] wise and to the unwise so as much is in
[1:05:56] me is I'm ready to preach the gospel to
[1:05:58] you that are roome also he said I'll
[1:06:00] preach no matter if they want to hear me
[1:06:01] or not I'll preach no matter if it's a
[1:06:03] biggest city in the world or not I'll
[1:06:05] preach in front of the emperor if that's
[1:06:06] what it takes you realize Paul basically
[1:06:10] gave up his life his freedom to preach
[1:06:13] to
[1:06:15] Nero and Nero was he his enjoyment at
[1:06:18] that time was burning Christians at the
[1:06:20] stake but Paul said I'll preach to him
[1:06:22] anyway now Nero never repented but he
[1:06:24] got to hear the gospel right are you
[1:06:27] with me now he got to hear the gospel
[1:06:30] and and we realize he said I'm not
[1:06:31] ashamed of the Gospel if he had repented
[1:06:34] he would have been okay he didn't repent
[1:06:36] now look said it's the power of God unto
[1:06:40] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:06:42] the Jew first also to the Greek not
[1:06:44] everyone is elect but everyone who wants
[1:06:46] to be saved can be
[1:06:49] saved how can you say that well even
[1:06:51] Cain had no excuse
[1:06:55] Genesis 4:6 the Lord said to Cain why
[1:06:57] artart thou wroth why is thy countenance
[1:06:59] Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not
[1:07:01] be
[1:07:02] accepted if thou doest not well sin lith
[1:07:04] at the door unto thee shall be his
[1:07:05] desire Thou shalt rule over him you say
[1:07:07] well that's just a penny but he needs
[1:07:09] pennies
[1:07:10] too right right but we just need to get
[1:07:12] our own hands off of and let God do the
[1:07:14] work let him call us to do the work
[1:07:17] right now maybe but some of them are
[1:07:19] silver dollars you just don't know it
[1:07:21] yet and and so we we we call we call
[1:07:24] everyone to come Revelation 2 17 the
[1:07:26] spirit and the bride say come let him
[1:07:28] that Hearth say come let him that is a
[1:07:30] thirst come and whosoever will let him
[1:07:32] take the Water of Life freely brother BR
[1:07:34] said the whosoever will he said that's
[1:07:36] the ones that goes through the
[1:07:37] tribulation I'm paraphrasing but the
[1:07:38] bride is the elected of God acts 10:34
[1:07:41] Peter opened his mouth and said of a
[1:07:43] truth I perceive that God is no
[1:07:45] respector of persons but in every nation
[1:07:47] he that fearth him and worketh
[1:07:49] righteousness is accepted with him
[1:07:51] listen brother BR said though you be in
[1:07:52] error yet in the righteousness of the
[1:07:54] projective of your heart that you desire
[1:07:56] to serve God God will honor that so
[1:07:59] therefore denominations has no lines
[1:08:01] that they can set that will stop God to
[1:08:03] any certain Creed because God will look
[1:08:04] upon the motives of the human heart I'm
[1:08:07] pre preaching to as hard as I can I want
[1:08:09] us to understand God wants to save The
[1:08:12] Sinner but you got to want to be saved
[1:08:14] but he wants to save those that want to
[1:08:16] be
[1:08:17] saved sir amen he said God will look
[1:08:20] upon the motives of the human heart and
[1:08:22] there he will work from that spot
[1:08:26] if you have a desire to serve God that
[1:08:28] desire came from somewhere obey God and
[1:08:32] if you got something in your heart for
[1:08:33] god brother B said you won't express it
[1:08:35] and so forth just keep putting it off
[1:08:37] later on later on that little desire you
[1:08:38] once had to serve God will be taken away
[1:08:40] from you you might as well serve him the
[1:08:42] Bible says today the day of salvation
[1:08:45] now is the accepted time you might as
[1:08:48] well serve him now he said the devil
[1:08:50] will come in steal that away and then
[1:08:51] you won't have any desire to serve him
[1:08:53] if you just even if you just want to be
[1:08:55] in church Church Now's the Time to do
[1:08:58] it Romans 10:8 it says but what sayith
[1:09:01] that the word is not the even in thy
[1:09:03] mouth in thy heart that is the word of
[1:09:04] faith which we preach that if Thou shalt
[1:09:07] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:09:09] and Shall Believe in thine heart that
[1:09:10] God ha raised him from the dead Thou
[1:09:12] shalt be
[1:09:14] saved Oh Glory to God what a promise
[1:09:17] that is for with the heart man believeth
[1:09:19] under righteousness but with the mouth
[1:09:21] confession is made to Salvation for the
[1:09:23] scripture says whosoever believeth on
[1:09:25] him shall not be ashamed but there is no
[1:09:27] difference between the Jew and the Greek
[1:09:29] for the same Lord over all is Rich unto
[1:09:31] all that call upon him for whosoever
[1:09:34] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:09:35] shall be saved got to have the right
[1:09:38] attitude coming the right way God can
[1:09:40] save
[1:09:42] anybody that's that's why the worst
[1:09:45] Spirit you can have is a religious
[1:09:46] spirit the worst thing you think you
[1:09:48] know everything that's the worst Spirit
[1:09:51] you can have on you worse than a drunker
[1:09:53] worse than a prostitute why because you
[1:09:55] think you're okay and you think you know
[1:10:00] everything but whosoever shall call upon
[1:10:02] the name of the Lord would be saved
[1:10:04] whoever simple enough just say Lord I
[1:10:06] need saving yeah and I believe you're a
[1:10:09] savior Hallelujah you want to be saved
[1:10:12] cry out to him believe on him Hallelujah
[1:10:17] second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack
[1:10:19] concerning his promises some men count
[1:10:20] slackness but as longsuffering to us
[1:10:23] we're not willing that any should pay
[1:10:25] perish but that all should come to
[1:10:28] repentance what should our attitude be
[1:10:29] towards the sinner what kind of people
[1:10:31] brother BR said ought we to be to
[1:10:33] realize that this day maybe the last day
[1:10:35] will ever be mortal tomorrow we may be
[1:10:37] immortal this is the only day we may
[1:10:40] ever have in our life the last meeting
[1:10:42] will ever set together and work for the
[1:10:44] kingdom of God how ought this meeting to
[1:10:49] be conducted tonight then we talked
[1:10:52] about this Wednesday night how ought
[1:10:54] this meeting to be conducted
[1:10:56] every one of us is a generator is a
[1:10:58] Dynamo we
[1:11:00] matter right our attitude matters and so
[1:11:03] brother BR said how about this meeting
[1:11:04] to be conducted with the very highest of
[1:11:06] reverence the truth is you don't know
[1:11:08] everything and there may be somebody
[1:11:10] sitting there that desperately needs
[1:11:12] help and your attitude matters towards
[1:11:16] that and he says how about this meeting
[1:11:18] with to be conduct with the very highest
[1:11:20] of reverence so with all of our hearts
[1:11:21] we're leaning to the Lord Jesus to give
[1:11:23] us every soul that's here that isn't
[1:11:25] converted to help do something that'll
[1:11:27] cause the unbeliever and the lukewarm to
[1:11:29] look on and receive the Lord Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ it'd be a selfish thing if a
[1:11:33] man's heart isn't out to save his
[1:11:35] brother there's something wrong with his
[1:11:37] heart no matter what condition if his
[1:11:38] brother hates him if his brother's
[1:11:40] against him if his brother's tried
[1:11:41] everything he can to tear him down yet
[1:11:42] that man's heart pulls for his brother
[1:11:44] he can't help it there's something in
[1:11:45] there that just calls out oh my brother
[1:11:47] you're wrong but I want you to be
[1:11:50] saved and therefore you try with
[1:11:52] everything that's in you to get your
[1:11:53] brother to believe with all his heart
[1:11:54] and come into the the kingdom of God
[1:11:56] brother B that's the kind of meeting we
[1:11:58] want to have every
[1:12:00] time every time we want to have that
[1:12:02] kind of a meeting he said I preached
[1:12:04] hundreds of thousand I preached just
[1:12:05] four or five but I wouldn't be any more
[1:12:07] sincere with 500,000 than I would be
[1:12:10] with five people because one soul is
[1:12:12] valued to God as
[1:12:14] 10,000
[1:12:18] worlds I hope you're hearing me
[1:12:21] tonight listen brother brandham told a
[1:12:24] story
[1:12:25] about Ed he was with Ed bisc on a trip
[1:12:28] and they were they were with Bud
[1:12:30] Southwick you probably heard his name on
[1:12:31] the tapes he's with Bud Southwick and
[1:12:34] he's uh he is actually Bud's brother has
[1:12:38] epilepsy and Bud's just comeing
[1:12:41] beginning to believe and understanding
[1:12:42] brother Rand is a prophet and things and
[1:12:45] and his brother has Epsy his brother's
[1:12:47] not a Believer but he his wife is a
[1:12:50] Pentecostal lady but the BR said she's
[1:12:51] filled with the Holy
[1:12:53] Ghost and uh Bud's wife was a
[1:12:56] Pentecostal lady filled with the Holy
[1:12:57] Ghost but Bud was just now kind of
[1:12:59] becoming a
[1:13:00] Believer and Bud's brother had epilepsy
[1:13:03] well brother brandom uh Bud's telling
[1:13:05] him he said I wish my brother could get
[1:13:07] in the meetings brother Bram said well
[1:13:09] bring him down here and so he he didn't
[1:13:12] he brought him to Bud brought him to his
[1:13:13] house it's some 700 miles away goes and
[1:13:16] gets him and when he would have this
[1:13:18] epileptic fit everybody there would be
[1:13:20] afraid they'd just get really scared
[1:13:22] because this man had a problem and and
[1:13:24] he would get very angry and start
[1:13:26] tearing stuff up and you just having a
[1:13:28] fit and and so uh usually if that
[1:13:31] happened uh Mrs Southwick would grab her
[1:13:34] children run out the house but brother
[1:13:36] brandham told him something strange you
[1:13:38] know there's so much of the Gospel is
[1:13:40] just
[1:13:41] obedience just simply obeying the word
[1:13:44] and that proves Faith that's true right
[1:13:46] when we just obey God that's true you
[1:13:48] don't have to figure it out just do what
[1:13:50] God says right and and and this was just
[1:13:53] brother brand telling brother South he
[1:13:55] said next time it happens he said par
[1:13:57] his shirt off of him it don't make any
[1:13:59] sense throw it in the fire right and he
[1:14:03] and he'll that epilepsy will leave
[1:14:05] him right but that's what a prophet told
[1:14:07] him to do well you know that bud
[1:14:10] actually went out of the house and went
[1:14:12] on a a guiding trip to guide he was a
[1:14:13] guide in the wilderness and here's his
[1:14:16] his brother at home with his wife and
[1:14:18] and their children and it happened he
[1:14:21] had an epileptic fit and brother BR said
[1:14:23] instead of running out the door like she
[1:14:24] usually did what she did is she grabbed
[1:14:26] his shirt he said she jumped up on him
[1:14:28] like this and she grabbed that shirt and
[1:14:30] ripped it off of him and threw it in the
[1:14:32] fire and when she did what happened is
[1:14:35] the epilepsy left him why because oh
[1:14:40] Church what was it a man cared enough
[1:14:42] about his brother to bring him in the
[1:14:44] presence of a prophet to talk about him
[1:14:46] with a prophet and the prophet said this
[1:14:48] is what you got to do and when they did
[1:14:50] what the prophet said the epilepsy left
[1:14:52] listen to me church we have the words of
[1:14:54] a prophet today we have the words of God
[1:14:56] the god Prophet we've got the words of
[1:14:58] Christ if we'll just do what he says sir
[1:15:01] if we'll just follow what he says I
[1:15:04] believe our family can be
[1:15:07] saved let's do what he
[1:15:09] says but they had to care enough to do
[1:15:12] that well that won't work what do you
[1:15:14] mean tear his shirt off of him well you
[1:15:16] don't know if it'll work until you try
[1:15:19] it right and that's if if the if the
[1:15:23] holy spirit said to do it that's what to
[1:15:25] do now make sure it's God right you go
[1:15:29] tearing people's shirts off
[1:15:33] but oh church but we have a more sure
[1:15:36] word of Prophecy brother BR said we have
[1:15:38] something greater than the vision we
[1:15:39] have the word of God
[1:15:41] itself the faith in the word of God now
[1:15:44] look brother Brandon said we are in the
[1:15:46] battle now we're after our fallen
[1:15:48] brother that God before the foundation
[1:15:49] of the world saw and predestinated unto
[1:15:52] eternal life and the things of the
[1:15:54] world's him caught up in a whirlwind
[1:15:56] he's out into societies and classes him
[1:15:58] and his wife walking up and down the
[1:15:59] street smoking and drinking and
[1:16:01] carousing trying to find peace and the
[1:16:04] spirit of Christ in us as it would be in
[1:16:06] Abraham we're going after him with all
[1:16:08] the armors of God the angels of God
[1:16:10] encamped about we're going to bring back
[1:16:11] our fallen brother again he said watch
[1:16:14] Abraham in the 14th chapter the Blessed
[1:16:16] Spirit of Christ came upon him he went
[1:16:18] after his Fallen brother the spirit of
[1:16:19] Christ on Abraham went out back after
[1:16:21] his Fallen brother and brought him back
[1:16:23] Abraham the preacher of righteousness
[1:16:24] went after after his Fallen brother the
[1:16:26] denominational brother and brought him
[1:16:27] back brought him back so he'd have
[1:16:29] another chance after Satan had took him
[1:16:31] out brought him back to have Fellowship
[1:16:33] again what great regards did lot give to
[1:16:36] it did he go out with Abraham saying
[1:16:38] Father Abraham I've been wrong I know
[1:16:40] now I've mixed I missed the blessings I
[1:16:42] got carried away out there went out into
[1:16:43] the world now watch lot never did come
[1:16:47] back with
[1:16:48] Abraham he never did do it but Abraham
[1:16:51] still did what he was called to do and
[1:16:54] went down and and and got him but look
[1:16:57] he never did come all the way back he
[1:16:59] said he didn't say I know you brought me
[1:17:01] back I appreciate it I'll go and take
[1:17:02] the way with the Lord's sup few why he
[1:17:04] was just a
[1:17:05] penny but he couldn't even be a penny in
[1:17:07] the hands of the
[1:17:10] enemy real we pray for people that are
[1:17:12] not elect and believe God will heal them
[1:17:15] we don't know who is and who isn't but
[1:17:16] we pray for people that are pray for
[1:17:18] Sinners and believe God will heal them
[1:17:20] why do we do that why do we do that
[1:17:22] because we believe God's a savior he's a
[1:17:24] Healer
[1:17:25] right if they can have faith God can
[1:17:27] heal them we pray for our loved ones we
[1:17:29] pray for those that uh maybe seem like
[1:17:31] they've send away we pray for all of
[1:17:33] them right we we we're going out after
[1:17:36] them and we're going to treat them right
[1:17:38] we're going to treat them right but but
[1:17:41] by the same token we've got to
[1:17:43] understand that they're not going to
[1:17:44] necessarily be what we
[1:17:46] are right and you can't make somebody
[1:17:48] elected no amount of effort or
[1:17:51] forethought is going to make somebody
[1:17:52] want to serve God if they don't don't
[1:17:54] want to serve God let him go let him go
[1:17:56] be a
[1:17:58] lot right but if you try to make take
[1:18:00] lot and try to make him Abraham you'll
[1:18:02] have
[1:18:03] Strife right but now watch he said now
[1:18:07] he said I know you brought me back I
[1:18:09] appreciate I'll go and take the way of
[1:18:10] Lord SP you no he went right back down
[1:18:12] in Sodom again and there polluted into
[1:18:13] Sodom but watch Abraham what a beautiful
[1:18:16] thing it was when Abraham returned from
[1:18:18] the slaughter of the Kings watch what
[1:18:19] happened mzc come out to meet him mzc
[1:18:23] which was the king of Salem the king of
[1:18:24] peace the king of righteousness listen
[1:18:27] Genesis 14:17 the king of Sodom went out
[1:18:29] to meet meet
[1:18:30] him after his return from the slaughter
[1:18:32] of cheder and of the kings were with him
[1:18:35] the valley of shave which is the King's
[1:18:37] Dale and MDC king of Salem brought forth
[1:18:40] Bread and Wine he was the priest of the
[1:18:41] most high God and he blessed him and
[1:18:44] said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high
[1:18:46] god possessor of heavens and earth and
[1:18:49] blessed be the most high God which ha
[1:18:50] delivered thine enemies into thy hand
[1:18:52] and he gave him tithes of all
[1:18:55] now I'm take a note on on this tithe not
[1:18:58] about the tithe but about how things
[1:19:01] carry down through family
[1:19:03] Generations the Bible says that Levi
[1:19:06] paid tithes in the loins of Abraham and
[1:19:09] brother Brandon picks that up and he
[1:19:10] said you mothers don't realize he said
[1:19:12] what you're doing with your daughters
[1:19:14] said one generation will be this way and
[1:19:17] the next generation will be that much
[1:19:18] worse and the next generation will be
[1:19:20] that much worse I'd commit them to God
[1:19:21] and let God take over their lives let
[1:19:24] God have them because just if they're
[1:19:26] just going to be a worse version of you
[1:19:28] otherwise because every generation goes
[1:19:30] down but here it worked the other way he
[1:19:33] paid tithes in the loins of Abraham and
[1:19:35] because he paid tithes in the loins of
[1:19:37] Abraham it was counted to his
[1:19:39] great-grandson are you with me now
[1:19:42] Abraham had what what was it it was it
[1:19:45] was mzc coming to to show that Abraham
[1:19:48] had the right motives and holding the
[1:19:50] meeting and fighting the battle if we
[1:19:52] can say it that way we want to have the
[1:19:54] right motives don't we we don't want to
[1:19:56] have church or have meetings just to
[1:19:58] have meetings we want to have church and
[1:20:00] have meetings for the right reasons
[1:20:01] Abraham fought the Battle for the right
[1:20:04] reasons Genesis
[1:20:06] 14:23 we know that because he he refused
[1:20:08] to become rich over it he said I will
[1:20:10] not take from a thread even to a shoe
[1:20:12] latchet I will not take anything that is
[1:20:14] Zine L thou should have say I have made
[1:20:16] Abram rich but now look after the battle
[1:20:19] is over we have a
[1:20:22] promise yeah what is it a meeting with
[1:20:27] MDC oh church as soon as the battle was
[1:20:31] over what did he bring out Bread and

[1:21:57] right God's coming to get you
[1:22:02] yes oh
[1:22:04] Church look when he separated himself
[1:22:07] then God told Abraham stand up look to
[1:22:09] the east to the west to the north to the
[1:22:11] South said every bit of it belongs to
[1:22:13] you he said that was good
[1:22:15] enough it's all yours walk through it
[1:22:18] said I like that walk through it he said
[1:22:20] that's supposed to matter with the
[1:22:21] church today when a man is Born Again of
[1:22:22] the spirit of God every divine blessing
[1:22:24] in this Bible belongs to
[1:22:27] you said like a man buying a house he
[1:22:29] said if I bought a house I'd want to
[1:22:30] know what was in it if you bought a
[1:22:32] house it was furnished wouldn't you want
[1:22:33] to know what the furniture
[1:22:35] was this house is furnished he said when
[1:22:38] I got saved brother I took this old
[1:22:40] Treasure Book of God and look through it
[1:22:42] to see what I possessed I find out that
[1:22:45] every blessing someone say every
[1:22:47] blessing every blessing that's in that
[1:22:49] Bible belongs to me and it belongs to
[1:22:53] every believer oh I love that not just
[1:22:55] to a prophet but to every believer you
[1:22:58] say brother Ben it seems so Out Of Reach
[1:23:00] right now I'm not going to hold you much
[1:23:02] longer you say it's so Out Of Reach
[1:23:04] right now but don't you realize that
[1:23:07] brother B said when you're walking out
[1:23:08] there he said if it seems like to be a
[1:23:10] little out of my reach I'll pray till I
[1:23:12] get
[1:23:13] it Glory he said I I'll get a stool I'll
[1:23:16] stand up on something what what is I'll
[1:23:17] pray till I get it it might be Out Of
[1:23:19] Reach right now but now's not the time
[1:23:21] to give up pray till you get it
[1:23:25] Hallelujah every promise in the book is
[1:23:27] yours pray till you get it get up on the
[1:23:30] on the shelf and and find out what's
[1:23:32] yours and if you can't reach it keep
[1:23:34] believing God I say let's save our
[1:23:38] pennies yes sir let's be spiritually
[1:23:42] Frugal we're not walking around we're
[1:23:45] not walking around just throwing things
[1:23:49] away well let's save her pennies you
[1:23:51] never know might not even be a penny
[1:23:54] what do you do when you drop change on
[1:23:56] the ground what's the first thing I know
[1:23:57] what I do because me bending over the
[1:24:00] Penny's hardly worth it
[1:24:03] right so what do you do you first you
[1:24:05] look down and see what what it is what
[1:24:07] denomination it is
[1:24:11] right and if it's a penny you might just
[1:24:13] leave it there but if it's a silver
[1:24:16] dollar you don't but listen to me we
[1:24:17] don't know who's
[1:24:19] who right so we don't care what
[1:24:22] denomination it looks like that's true
[1:24:24] or what it's in what condition it's in
[1:24:26] we want to bend over and re reach down
[1:24:28] and pick it up if we can and some have
[1:24:31] compassion make a difference and others
[1:24:34] let God do God's
[1:24:36] work and our work is to pray let's not
[1:24:40] leave a hoof behind can we do that can
[1:24:44] we can we commit to that not one hoof
[1:24:47] behind I'm not
[1:24:51] content I'm not content to leave one
[1:24:53] behind
[1:24:56] we've had young people in this church
[1:24:57] from years ago that that have left went
[1:25:00] out in the world I'm not content to
[1:25:01] leave them
[1:25:04] behind let's see that they come back to
[1:25:06] the Lord mean you got
[1:25:08] children let's not be content Let's Get
[1:25:10] Down On Our Knees and begin to really
[1:25:12] pray amen we've seen God do it he's
[1:25:15] starting to do it let's just keep doing
[1:25:16] let's keep ping let's keep
[1:25:19] calling I'm not content that one to be
[1:25:21] left behind the people that I preach to
[1:25:22] I don't just not just for this church I
[1:25:24] want every Church to reclaim those that
[1:25:27] that that have been lost over the years
[1:25:29] sometimes a person's got to go out far
[1:25:30] enough in sin they realize they're a
[1:25:31] sinner so they can be saved say God let
[1:25:34] them
[1:25:35] come the spirit and the bride say come
[1:25:39] let them come be saved they won't be
[1:25:41] saved if they're fighting it but if
[1:25:43] God's got a hold of them in any in some
[1:25:45] way to tell them to pull them to call
[1:25:48] them they need to they need to come and
[1:25:51] they need to be saved let's bow our
[1:25:53] heads together
[1:25:58] maybe you don't feel worthy
[1:26:00] of of salvation but you are or he
[1:26:03] wouldn't call
[1:26:04] you in fact he he opened that up to
[1:26:10] everybody he has a right to have a
[1:26:12] family he has his elect but he opened up
[1:26:15] the opportunity for salvation even to
[1:26:20] Cain he opens it up to everybody
