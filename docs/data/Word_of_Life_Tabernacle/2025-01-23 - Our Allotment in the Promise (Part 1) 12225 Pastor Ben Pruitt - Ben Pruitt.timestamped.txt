[46:53] faithful brother Bill I seen sister
[46:55] Karen look at you you know

[47:11] a lot of attention on our young folks so
[47:12] we're going to try to do something for

[47:16] be praying for that and and uh if you
[47:18] want to help with that we'd sure be glad
[47:20] to have your help uh Genesis 49
[47:24] And1 it worked when I took it off Sunday
[47:27] night now it's
[47:29] ringing it says and Jacob called unto
[47:32] his
[47:33] sons and said Gather yourselves together
[47:36] that I may tell you that which shall
[47:38] befall you in the last days I may tell
[47:42] you that which shall befall you in the
[47:44] last days I want to speak on our
[47:45] allotment in the promise I pray Lord
[47:47] would that His blessings to the word you
[47:49] may be
[47:51] seated an allotment represents a
[47:54] specific amount or allocation of
[47:58] resources I want you to think uh with me
[48:00] tonight deeply as we go into this uh
[48:04] it's a specific amount of money or time
[48:06] or land given to an individual or a
[48:10] group for a particular purpose so that
[48:14] is an allotment it's what you've been
[48:15] given for a particular purpose this
[48:19] begin as I begin to think about these
[48:21] things and it begin to be quickened to
[48:22] me this week I begin to think of how
[48:25] different the 12 sons of Jacob were from
[48:28] each other they were very very different
[48:31] young men and yet God they were all the
[48:34] uh sons of Jacob they all came from the
[48:37] same father but each one had his own
[48:39] experience in life each one had his own
[48:41] family each one had his own allotment in
[48:44] the promised land and yet each one was
[48:47] born to live on the land allotted to him
[48:51] and and we find that and if you go and
[48:53] listen to uh message brother Brandon
[48:56] preaches a series of message called
[48:57] adoption I think it's adoption 1-4 I'm
[49:01] in the middle of listening to that again
[49:03] myself and brother brandom when he
[49:05] preaches the adoption series he begins
[49:08] to uh tell us that these people they
[49:11] didn't just happen to get a certain
[49:13] piece of property you know if you
[49:15] inherited something and it didn't quite
[49:17] fit you uh it might be something say uh
[49:21] your grandmother played the piano and
[49:22] you got her piano well if you don't play
[49:25] you might treasure that as a piece of
[49:26] Furniture but it's not really something
[49:28] you can do anything with it might be an
[49:31] inheritance but it's not an allotment
[49:33] for a specific purpose so if you were
[49:35] someone uh who were giving who was
[49:38] giving stuff away to your grandchildren
[49:40] or something like that you might put in
[49:42] the wheel a certain person would get the
[49:44] piano why because they play the piano
[49:47] right because they have that skill to be
[49:49] able to that gift to be able to do that
[49:53] well God not only did that but being he
[49:55] is God and he's a able to do what he
[49:57] wants to do and set things up how he
[49:59] wants to do it he not not only gave the
[50:02] children that could do it but he put in
[50:05] them the the kind of nature that they
[50:08] would do it does that make sense so he
[50:10] allotted them to a piece of land piece
[50:12] of ground that they would find in them
[50:16] the ability to fulfill and to to
[50:19] possess that portion of the promise and
[50:23] he's done the same thing for us
[50:25] spiritually that he put within us the
[50:28] ability if you're a mother if you're a a
[50:31] preacher if you're a a deacon whatever
[50:34] it is that God called you to do he's put
[50:37] within you that particular allotment
[50:40] that ability to fill that uh that that
[50:43] particular part of the promise and you
[50:45] do have the ability to do that you may
[50:48] not always feel able or even qualified
[50:51] but I'm so glad that God put that in you
[50:53] and gifts and callings are without
[50:55] repentance he actually did that before
[50:57] the foundation of the world he put give
[50:59] you an ability to do what he called you
[51:01] to do so he doesn't just call you to do
[51:03] something and then and then not give you
[51:05] the ability to do it but who he calls he
[51:07] equips and he equipped you not when you
[51:10] were not even when you were born but
[51:12] before the foundation of the world you
[51:14] were already equipped to be what you are
[51:16] if you're a Christian today you were
[51:18] equipped to do that before the
[51:20] foundation of the world you don't have
[51:22] to stress about or worry about it and
[51:25] think well you know how will I ever make
[51:26] it how am I ever going to make it in
[51:28] leosia he chose you for this particular
[51:31] time and this particular place are you
[51:33] hearing me church he chose you for that
[51:36] he allotted that to you before the
[51:39] foundation of the world I know that's
[51:41] deep and you got to think deep but I
[51:43] think we all should understand that that
[51:45] that God chose us for a particular time
[51:47] and a particular place not just the
[51:49] preachers but each and every
[51:53] Christian we would have different roles
[51:56] right and they would be way different
[51:58] from each other but all would benefit
[52:01] the kingdom of
[52:02] God so the 12 sons of Jacob being very
[52:06] different men that were chosen for a
[52:10] particular piece of the promised land
[52:13] when Jesus chose his disciples they were
[52:17] very different now I'll give you kind of
[52:20] a clue where we're headed maybe in in
[52:21] the weeks to come if the Lord allows me
[52:24] to do it I want to go into each one of
[52:26] those those sons and talk about some of
[52:29] those differences and what they were and
[52:31] how that would apply to us but now these
[52:35] these these men were different and when
[52:37] Jesus chose his disciples he chose 12
[52:40] disciples 12 very different men that
[52:44] filled 12 very different roles in fact
[52:47] one of them was even a
[52:48] devil right they were all predestined to
[52:51] something right right and and 11 of them
[52:54] were predestined to life and one of them
[52:56] was was a devil and yet they made their
[52:58] own choices they had their own faults
[53:01] and failures and different things but
[53:03] but yet God uh predestined them for a
[53:06] particular place in a particular job
[53:08] brother brand said I believe that God is
[53:10] a god of variety he said the world
[53:13] proves that he's got big mountains and
[53:16] little mountains he's got Plains he's
[53:19] got deserts he's got different things
[53:23] because now look he made it the way he
[53:27] wanted
[53:28] it I love that line he's got different
[53:31] things because he made it the way he
[53:35] wanted it how boring would it be if we
[53:38] were like brother brandham said a
[53:39] serious and robu Harmony House if we
[53:42] were all you know in a church if
[53:44] everything was just set the way we
[53:46] wanted it we had all the different
[53:48] people you know if you got to choose the
[53:50] church members if if you got to choose
[53:52] the people in The Bride what kind of
[53:54] people would they be well I'll say
[53:55] somebody did choose the people in The
[53:58] Bride somebody did choose the people in
[54:00] this church but it wasn't us it was God
[54:03] and so many times it don't it looks
[54:05] strange to us as as colors in a pallet
[54:07] would be it might look strange to uh to
[54:10] the what to certain colors to that that
[54:13] are so different from other colors and
[54:15] here's one that's boring but it serves
[54:17] to complement that Vivid color and that
[54:20] Vivid color without this boring color
[54:22] come on Church wouldn't look very good
[54:26] right but the two together they come
[54:28] together and make something beautiful
[54:30] each piece of the Ark may not make much
[54:32] sense each Rose in the garden may not
[54:34] make much sense but but together it
[54:37] produces something that God wants it
[54:39] produces a picture that God wants to
[54:41] have so he said he made the season
[54:44] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[54:47] seasons it shows he's a god of variety
[54:51] and even variety within the seasons in
[54:53] different parts of the
[54:55] world right
[54:57] he made you in a variety some men are
[55:00] real
[55:02] blusterous and some are real
[55:04] dogmatic and others are fine others are
[55:09] kind now think about this for a minute
[55:13] you might if you're a fine person or a
[55:17] kind person that's a very different
[55:19] personality type from
[55:22] blusterous or
[55:24] dogmatic but God made them both
[55:28] both right and if you're a fine person
[55:31] you might look at a blusterous person
[55:33] and think surely that can't be God
[55:37] working in that manner and yet God
[55:39] needed if you're a fine person maybe
[55:41] there's some things you wouldn't say
[55:43] that God needed
[55:45] said right that a blusterous person
[55:47] might say as long as he does it within
[55:49] the boundaries of the word right and
[55:52] maybe uh maybe a person Brother Band
[55:55] talked about how humble brother Neville
[55:57] was what a wonderful man he was he said
[55:58] but you can't be too humble because he
[56:01] said you got to be able to say the
[56:03] things that need to be said that's right
[56:05] right so he he made us in a variety some
[56:08] men real blusterous some are real
[56:10] dogmatic others are fine others are kind
[56:13] and you just find all different kinds of
[56:15] people in his kingdom I I don't want to
[56:18] pick on any of us tonight but I guess I
[56:20] could pick on my own family we're we're
[56:22] very different there was eight of us
[56:24] children every one of us very very
[56:26] different one from the other you know me
[56:28] and Joel and we're just about Polar
[56:30] Opposites but we work together right we
[56:33] love each other but we're polar opposite
[56:36] we got different people and some and
[56:37] what you'll find is you fit in better
[56:39] with some people but they may not be the
[56:41] ones you
[56:43] need right in life they may not be the
[56:46] ones that can help you even though you
[56:48] fit in better with them but maybe
[56:50] they're not what can help you because
[56:52] iron sharpens iron so if you only hang
[56:55] out with people who are like like you
[56:57] right who who think like you do yeah you
[57:00] life becomes a whole lot easier you cut
[57:02] everybody else off it becomes a whole
[57:04] lot easier but you don't grow that's
[57:06] right right because you got to be able
[57:08] to well if somebody else maybe the next
[57:10] door neighbor say had a little bit
[57:12] different idea of how to do things but
[57:14] maybe that helps you to learn some
[57:16] things so so that's the way these these
[57:18] were in the Old Testament and the New
[57:20] Testament the 12 sons of Jacob and then
[57:22] the 12 disciples but Brandon said look
[57:24] at St Peter judge him by Andrew he said
[57:28] see Andrew is that prayer Warrior just
[57:30] stayed on his knees all the time the
[57:33] Apostle Peter was one of those fire
[57:34] brands that preach and so forth and so
[57:39] and Paul was more scholarly like more
[57:41] like a prophet or something to set back
[57:43] and maybe those people who who were
[57:45] attracted to Peter's Ministry wouldn't
[57:48] have really been attracted to Paul's but
[57:50] they needed both of them right and some
[57:53] that were attracted to to Paul's
[57:55] Ministry wouldn't have been really
[57:56] attracted to Andrew's Ministry but they
[57:59] needed both of
[58:00] them so you look at Paul and Peter that
[58:03] that's a great example of of a real
[58:05] Clash of characters Galatians Chapter 2
[58:08] and verse 11 when Peter was come to
[58:11] Antioch he said I was stood him to the
[58:13] face because he was to be blamed right
[58:16] now that's pretty that's pretty uh harsh
[58:19] is it pretty Brash you just you just
[58:21] Paul just comes out and says I withstood
[58:23] him and Peter saying you didn't have to
[58:25] use my name there you know
[58:28] yeah wrote it in a
[58:30] letter he said for before that certain
[58:33] came from James he did eat with the
[58:35] Gentiles but when they were come he
[58:37] withdrew and separated himself fearing
[58:40] them which were of the
[58:42] circumcision now but look this
[58:45] difference between them did not cause a
[58:49] permanent
[58:51] split now here's where we got to grow up
[58:54] right right just because have a
[58:56] difference of opinion with somebody
[58:58] doesn't mean you got to leave the church
[59:00] come on now just because you think
[59:02] differently from somebody maybe they
[59:03] might sit beside you see you could be
[59:05] right come on but you could be wrong
[59:08] right and sometimes it's just a
[59:10] difference for JT and our personalities
[59:12] and dealing with that and we make
[59:14] personality the gospel and it's not the
[59:16] gospel the gospel is what's written in
[59:18] the
[59:18] book right that's not the the
[59:21] personality is just the way that we do
[59:23] things right and many people get used to
[59:25] a certain personality say well we want
[59:27] everybody to be like brother Ben I know
[59:28] wouldn't the world be a wonderful place
[59:30] if everybody was like me but it wouldn't
[59:31] be a wonderful place because it would
[59:33] devolve into
[59:35] something terrible why because it would
[59:38] not be what God wanted it to be God
[59:41] wanted some blusterous men some fine men
[59:44] some some men that were good and kind
[59:47] and all in
[59:48] between so they didn't allow the
[59:51] difference to cause a permanent
[59:54] split and we know that because second
[59:56] Peter 3:14 this is amazing to
[59:59] me he said wherefore beloved seeing that
[1:00:01] you look for such things be diligent
[1:00:04] that you may be found of him in peace
[1:00:07] without spot and blameless and account
[1:00:10] that the longsuffering of Our Lord is
[1:00:12] salvation even now he's going to
[1:00:15] quote the scriptures quote
[1:00:19] Paul who called him
[1:00:23] out in writing and said he was to
[1:00:27] blame he said our beloved brother
[1:00:31] Paul look at this our and Peter wasn't
[1:00:34] known for not saying what he thought he
[1:00:36] said what he thought right but he didn't
[1:00:39] let this you know see Peter and Paul
[1:00:41] realized there was something bigger than
[1:00:42] themselves that they were working for
[1:00:46] Peter was wrong in this instance Paul
[1:00:47] was right we talked about another
[1:00:49] situation where it seemed like Barnabas
[1:00:51] was had a better idea than Paul did
[1:00:53] maybe he did right but they went
[1:00:55] different direction but if it hadn't
[1:00:56] been for they going in different
[1:00:57] directions Timothy would have never come
[1:00:59] along right so there's a there's always
[1:01:02] a reason why things happen the way that
[1:01:04] they do but now we find Peter
[1:01:07] acknowledging that what Paul wrote was
[1:01:09] scripture even what he wrote about
[1:01:12] him think about
[1:01:14] that you talk about being the bigger man
[1:01:17] look he said brother Paul our beloved
[1:01:20] brother Paul also according to the
[1:01:22] wisdom given un him hath written unto
[1:01:23] you as also in all his Epistles yeah
[1:01:27] including the one where he said Peter
[1:01:29] was to
[1:01:31] blame right speaking in them of those
[1:01:34] thing these things he said in which are
[1:01:36] some things hard to be
[1:01:38] understood which they that are unlearned
[1:01:40] and unstable rest they wrestle with them
[1:01:43] as they do also the other scriptures so
[1:01:45] he called them scripture he said unto
[1:01:47] their own
[1:01:49] destruction see Peter and Paul
[1:01:51] understood something that we lose sight
[1:01:53] of sometimes that a man could be a man
[1:01:55] of God and dis agree with me
[1:01:57] yes right a man can be called by God and
[1:02:00] disagree come on Church your your wife's
[1:02:03] not always going to agree with her
[1:02:05] sometimes she's got a point sometimes
[1:02:06] she doesn't but you're not always going
[1:02:08] to agree with her and she's not always
[1:02:10] going to agree with you but that don't
[1:02:11] mean you put your differences aside and
[1:02:13] you move on right you don't just let
[1:02:15] that destroy your marriage the
[1:02:18] difference is listen to me Church the
[1:02:20] difference I had somebody tell me in
[1:02:21] counseling one time they said well you
[1:02:23] don't understand because your marriage
[1:02:24] has always been perfect and I said boy I
[1:02:26] wish you
[1:02:29] knew that's not how it
[1:02:32] works no but I said I said some of the
[1:02:35] situations you've had is the same things
[1:02:37] we've had we've had money problems we've
[1:02:40] had situations with children we've had
[1:02:42] trouble in our home we've had I've got a
[1:02:44] a personality that's hard to live with
[1:02:47] sometimes huh if you don't think so
[1:02:50] could meet me on the first day of a
[1:02:53] diet right
[1:02:57] that's not every
[1:02:59] day deal with me the day after I preach
[1:03:01] deal with brother Joel the day after he
[1:03:04] preaches right right we we're hard to
[1:03:07] live with sometimes but yet God called
[1:03:10] all of us right and we got a goal we got
[1:03:12] a purpose and so what I I told him I
[1:03:13] said you know me and my wife just didn't
[1:03:15] let that take us down well yes we had a
[1:03:18] difference but we were committed we're
[1:03:19] going to stay together we're going to
[1:03:21] love each other we're going to do what's
[1:03:22] right we're at the end of the day when
[1:03:24] when night time comes we're not going to
[1:03:26] fight about it we're going to move on
[1:03:27] we've had many
[1:03:31] struggles that don't mean that we give
[1:03:33] up come on Church think about it in a
[1:03:35] church setting we don't give up because
[1:03:37] we struggle or because we think well
[1:03:39] this person they're not as nice to me as
[1:03:40] they should be or somebody else now
[1:03:42] we're always going to have little things
[1:03:44] like that maybe we were called for
[1:03:46] different things for different purposes
[1:03:48] you be you and let them be them and look
[1:03:51] for an opportunity to come
[1:03:54] together are you with me so
[1:03:56] far he said now Paul preaching he said I
[1:04:00] beseech you Brethren by the name of our
[1:04:01] Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the
[1:04:03] same thing yes there be no divisions
[1:04:06] among you but that you be perfectly
[1:04:07] joined together in the same mind in the
[1:04:09] same judgment he said for itth been
[1:04:12] declared unto me of you my brethren by
[1:04:13] them which are the house of Khloe there
[1:04:15] are contentions among you he said now
[1:04:19] this I say that every one of you saith I
[1:04:21] a Paul I have Aus and I have sephus and
[1:04:25] and I of Christ so there was one Church
[1:04:28] in in Corinth you know and in that time
[1:04:30] you didn't have uh the first church of
[1:04:33] Corinth and the second Church of Corinth
[1:04:35] it was just the church at
[1:04:36] Corinth right but they had their
[1:04:38] differences and so it began to split up
[1:04:40] into faction and so you had certain
[1:04:43] parts of the Church of Corinth were
[1:04:44] saying well I like what Paul
[1:04:47] says right and some of them say I like
[1:04:49] what Apollos says I like what Peter says
[1:04:54] right and every one of them wrong
[1:04:56] because they needed all of those men to
[1:04:59] be able to come to a maturity that they
[1:05:01] needed to come to and they remain babies
[1:05:03] and Paul deals with that we're not going
[1:05:04] to stay in Corinthians but Paul deals
[1:05:06] with that how that they remain babies
[1:05:08] because they couldn't they couldn't come
[1:05:10] to understanding like the Ephesians did
[1:05:12] because of this factionalism he said you
[1:05:14] say I'm a Paul I'm of Apollos I'm a
[1:05:16] sephus that's Peter I'm of Christ is
[1:05:18] Christ divided was Paul crucified for
[1:05:22] you oh come on Church your pastor wasn't
[1:05:25] crucified for you that's not I'm not the
[1:05:28] reason that you're saved right this
[1:05:30] church is not the reason that you were
[1:05:32] saved you were saved by the blood of
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ there's one thing there's
[1:05:36] one wheel as brother Joel said here
[1:05:38] recently in the middle of the
[1:05:39] wheel that we all all the all the wheel
[1:05:42] whole wheel has to turn around that we
[1:05:45] don't get to just do our own thing I was
[1:05:47] not baptized I was not crucified for you
[1:05:50] you weren't baptized in my name he says
[1:05:52] I didn't die for you he said I'm just
[1:05:54] part of God's Great
[1:05:56] program and Paul was a great part maybe
[1:05:58] the greatest part until the messenger of
[1:06:00] the end time because he was a prophet
[1:06:03] that had to every messenger even brother
[1:06:05] brandom had to follow that pattern that
[1:06:07] Paul had and yet he recognized that he
[1:06:10] was just fulfilling his part in the
[1:06:11] kingdom of God he understood that the
[1:06:15] message was the important
[1:06:18] thing right not the messenger in the
[1:06:20] sense of not me the the Flesh of me but
[1:06:24] the message itself remember there was no
[1:06:26] certain leader at the head of the brid
[1:06:29] group remember we talked about Sunday
[1:06:30] morning did that did that strike you Jo
[1:06:33] that struck me here comes the bride here
[1:06:36] comes the church they had a witch
[1:06:38] leading them yeah but when the bride
[1:06:41] came by they they weren't separated by
[1:06:43] National Group and there was there was
[1:06:45] no one at the head they were marching
[1:06:48] together but they were watching the
[1:06:51] message right the voice standing there
[1:06:54] with the messenger
[1:06:56] and oh my cuz they had confidence that
[1:06:59] God sent a prophet are you with me now
[1:07:01] and that he would speak the words of the
[1:07:02] Lord and that it would call them back
[1:07:04] into the step that they needed to be in
[1:07:08] oh Church we're not watching even the
[1:07:10] Flesh of the messenger today we're
[1:07:12] watching we're watching I'm going to get
[1:07:14] into that maybe as we get close to the
[1:07:15] end but we're watching the word we're
[1:07:17] watching the message we're watching for
[1:07:20] or hear listening for a voice we're not
[1:07:23] following a certain leader right but
[1:07:25] we're looking for that listening for
[1:07:27] that voice so now if you take all these
[1:07:31] different
[1:07:32] people you know very different so say
[1:07:36] and I'm trying to get it where even the
[1:07:37] kids can get it you know you look at our
[1:07:39] kids they're very different so Peter's
[1:07:42] very different from
[1:07:44] trip and trip is very different from
[1:07:48] Landon right they're all about the same
[1:07:50] age but they're very
[1:07:51] different right and that's good yes it's
[1:07:54] not a bad thing
[1:07:56] they're very different right and maybe
[1:07:58] there'd be some say well I wish this one
[1:08:00] was more like that one but they're very
[1:08:02] very different good Christian young men
[1:08:05] I believe Holy Ghost filled young men
[1:08:07] right but they're very very different
[1:08:09] right and if you took 12 of us you took
[1:08:11] a sampling of 12 of us Jaden and maty
[1:08:13] are different they're friends but
[1:08:14] they're different from each other not
[1:08:17] just different in general
[1:08:20] but and then then you have a Chase
[1:08:28] and Wyatt they're very where is Wyatt
[1:08:32] very different there he is coming in the
[1:08:36] back everybody watch W as he comes down
[1:08:38] the
[1:08:41] aisle very different sorry
[1:08:44] W you know some like attention some
[1:08:47] don't like attention right right these
[1:08:49] girls are very different one from
[1:08:51] another but God made you that way you
[1:08:54] see you've got a particular part of the
[1:08:56] promise that you're going to fulfill
[1:08:58] some of you might be preachers Preachers
[1:09:00] Wives preachers uh uh helpers deacons
[1:09:04] deacons wives you might be somebody who
[1:09:07] just works somebody who's tuned to
[1:09:09] business who's able to make a good
[1:09:11] living so you can help out in the church
[1:09:13] we need some of those too right you're
[1:09:16] tuned differently the problem is when we
[1:09:19] start trying to make everybody the same
[1:09:22] God didn't make you all the same but now
[1:09:25] think about it now 12 like if we could
[1:09:27] call these the 12 sons of Jacob there's
[1:09:29] not 12 of them but these boys just
[1:09:31] appear these the if you look at the
[1:09:33] differences in them and say that they
[1:09:35] were all sons of Jacob and they're all
[1:09:38] sons of Abraham sons of God but if they
[1:09:41] were all sons of Jacob how different
[1:09:43] that they would be and what they would
[1:09:45] choose to do and their gifts that they
[1:09:47] would have and yet the trick is how do
[1:09:50] you get those different people together
[1:09:53] all working together doing the same
[1:09:56] thing for the same reason you got to
[1:09:58] have something in common what do you
[1:09:59] have in common you have one savior
[1:10:02] you've been baptized into one body by
[1:10:05] one Spirit are you baptized into one
[1:10:07] body and that's how you enter brother B
[1:10:09] teaches us that in adoption that's how
[1:10:11] you get in the land right first of all
[1:10:14] and he said we're only preaching to
[1:10:15] those who are in the land so if you're
[1:10:17] not in the land you need to get in the
[1:10:18] land how do you get in the land by the
[1:10:20] baptism of the holy spirit so the
[1:10:23] adoption series was preached to those
[1:10:24] who are in the land but but being in the
[1:10:27] land that's what gives you the ability
[1:10:29] to work
[1:10:31] together come on Church you have
[1:10:33] something in
[1:10:35] common something that you're striving to
[1:10:39] do every one of our musicians wants I'm
[1:10:42] not preaching from notes I'm just
[1:10:44] talking to you every one of our
[1:10:45] musicians wants to have the same thing
[1:10:48] this presence of God in our
[1:10:50] services right but you got to play
[1:10:52] something different and feel a part to
[1:10:55] do that right you got to be willing to
[1:10:58] fill your part to play your part because
[1:11:01] if everybody tries to be the main thing
[1:11:03] you got a
[1:11:04] problem right and sometimes and music is
[1:11:06] a great analogy for it because sometimes
[1:11:08] a certain instrument leads and sometimes
[1:11:10] they back off and let somebody else lead
[1:11:12] depending on the song Oh church we only
[1:11:16] learn to do that spiritually sometimes
[1:11:18] we could recognize this person has a
[1:11:20] gift for this let's let them lead in
[1:11:22] that area and then let somebody else
[1:11:24] lead in a different area the pastor
[1:11:26] don't have all the
[1:11:28] gifts right and I'm thankful for all of
[1:11:30] you leaders you people that do things
[1:11:32] but Pastor don't have all the gifts but
[1:11:33] then again then again sometimes your
[1:11:36] area that you're working in it seems
[1:11:38] like well nobody notices nobody sees it
[1:11:40] but if you weren't working in that area
[1:11:42] no one would be come on and somebody
[1:11:45] needs to be a prayer Warrior somebody
[1:11:47] needs to be a worker in the field
[1:11:49] somebody needs to go to work every day
[1:11:51] and it seems like they're not doing
[1:11:52] nothing but they pray over their lunch
[1:11:54] and they pray and in the evening and
[1:11:56] they come back home and they're raising
[1:11:57] up a mighty warrior in their house
[1:11:59] they're raising up a young lady in their
[1:12:01] house that's going to go going to make a
[1:12:03] difference a young man in their house
[1:12:04] don't underestimate what God's going to
[1:12:06] do in your
[1:12:08] life you look it over at your plot that
[1:12:10] you're working and your allotment think
[1:12:12] well there's not much to that but there
[1:12:14] is more than you
[1:12:16] think and every one of us has a part to
[1:12:19] play how do you get all these tribes
[1:12:23] together well in the during the
[1:12:25] Wilderness
[1:12:26] Journey all the tribes were camped
[1:12:30] out around one thing yeah what was it
[1:12:34] the
[1:12:35] Tabernacle yeah they were gathered
[1:12:37] around the shakina that anointed the
[1:12:41] word the table of testimony they were
[1:12:43] gathered around all church that's what
[1:12:46] we have to do we put aside all our
[1:12:48] differences and we gather around the
[1:12:51] shakina we gather around the manifested
[1:12:53] word of the hour
[1:12:55] and and he is our Center Christ is our
[1:12:58] Center in 1 John 1:7 says if we walk in
[1:13:01] the light if he is the center of our of
[1:13:04] our life if we walk in the light as he
[1:13:06] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[1:13:08] with another why because though we're
[1:13:11] different yet the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:13] his son cleanseth us from all sin yes
[1:13:18] now they all come from one father but
[1:13:20] that didn't mean they'd all think the
[1:13:22] same right and don't you wish your
[1:13:25] pastor always thought like you
[1:13:27] did but if I thought like everybody else
[1:13:30] I it wouldn't do me much good would it
[1:13:33] you wouldn't need a
[1:13:35] pastor you know if your wife always
[1:13:37] agreed with you you wouldn't need
[1:13:44] her if if a deacon always agrees with
[1:13:46] you you probably don't need a
[1:13:49] deacon right so we're going to do we're
[1:13:51] going to have our our discussions and do
[1:13:53] things differently
[1:13:55] but when it comes to the main thing
[1:13:57] where what what are we here for church
[1:13:59] we're here to see God move we're here to
[1:14:01] see the presence of God Among Us we're
[1:14:03] here to see see Souls Born Into the
[1:14:05] kingdom of God we want to see more come
[1:14:07] into the land we want to see everyone
[1:14:10] that God's called till the last one
[1:14:11] comes in and one day we go home that's
[1:14:14] right so there might be one person that
[1:14:15] travel overseas and nobody else does it
[1:14:17] but God fit that one person equip them
[1:14:20] to be able to do that and another person
[1:14:22] just stay home day after day year after
[1:14:24] year but we need both of them where it
[1:14:26] won't
[1:14:29] work so each one of these young men and
[1:14:32] each one of these tribes were born to do
[1:14:34] and to be a certain thing but the
[1:14:37] problem came when one tribe become
[1:14:39] jealous or discontented and tried to
[1:14:42] either separate themselves or take maybe
[1:14:45] something that wasn't theirs a
[1:14:48] possession that they that that didn't
[1:14:49] belong to them to do something they
[1:14:51] weren't called to do now we know brother
[1:14:53] random taught us and we'll get more born
[1:14:55] to this later but each one was born
[1:14:56] under a certain sign and given a certain
[1:14:59] name right and not even knowing it
[1:15:01] brother said Joshua didn't even know but
[1:15:04] he he allotted them a land that would go
[1:15:07] with their name even though he didn't
[1:15:08] realize it he did it under the
[1:15:10] inspiration of the holy
[1:15:12] spirit so some of the tribes were
[1:15:14] similar to others yeah and even worked
[1:15:18] together and got along well some of the
[1:15:21] tribes were even split into halves cuz
[1:15:23] they couldn't even get along with
[1:15:24] themselves
[1:15:28] it's
[1:15:29] true but they were each
[1:15:32] unique I I we think of and I've preached
[1:15:35] to you about Benjamin and we'll get
[1:15:36] maybe we'll go through that but that's
[1:15:38] my name so I notice things about
[1:15:40] Benjamin in the Bible and Benjamin had a
[1:15:44] whole crew of left-handed sling throwers
[1:15:48] is that what it is sling thrower Slinger
[1:15:50] I'm not
[1:15:51] sure what you call that slingshot guys
[1:15:58] slingshots left-handed that's
[1:16:01] inexplicable like why in the world would
[1:16:03] One Tribe be filled with left-handed
[1:16:06] right why would one family be full of
[1:16:08] preachers and another family be full of
[1:16:11] musicians and another family be full of
[1:16:14] of people that can make money right and
[1:16:17] maybe part of a family can make money in
[1:16:19] part
[1:16:20] can't just don't have a gift for
[1:16:23] it right we identify with that part to
[1:16:26] can't make money can't we aren we I I
[1:16:29] mean I I do but you know people and you
[1:16:31] look at other people think everything
[1:16:32] they do turns to Gold but they're gifted
[1:16:36] for that and there's a great listen
[1:16:38] Church there's a great uh piece when you
[1:16:41] find what you were meant to do and you
[1:16:44] begin to do it and it begins to work for
[1:16:47] you and you begin to realize this is
[1:16:49] what I was to be and I may never be
[1:16:51] flashy I may never be great I may never
[1:16:53] make a lot of money but God called me
[1:16:55] for this and let me do this and not try
[1:16:58] to do everything else on amen God called
[1:17:02] you for a certain thing each one was
[1:17:04] born under a certain sign given a
[1:17:05] certain name and and fought a particular
[1:17:08] battle predestined to a certain place
[1:17:12] they had to fight for that place and
[1:17:13] stay in that
[1:17:15] place now we are predestined to our
[1:17:18] place in Christ Ephesians 1:5 having
[1:17:21] predestinated us unto the adop opon of
[1:17:25] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:17:28] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:17:30] will verse 11 says in whom that's Christ
[1:17:33] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:17:36] being
[1:17:38] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:17:40] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:17:44] counsel of his own will and again that's
[1:17:47] a hard thing to swallow election
[1:17:49] predestination is difficult for us to
[1:17:51] swallow no matter how much I would
[1:17:53] explain that to you is it's got to be
[1:17:55] something at some point you have to come
[1:17:56] to terms with an all powerful God who
[1:17:59] doesn't think like we do on right he
[1:18:03] just doesn't think like we do at all we
[1:18:05] can't think like that he said my
[1:18:07] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[1:18:09] my ways are higher than your ways at
[1:18:11] some point you have to come to peace
[1:18:12] with that and say Lord you do what
[1:18:13] you're going to do right let me do my
[1:18:16] part I want to do the best I can being
[1:18:18] predestined don't mean I don't fight it
[1:18:20] don't mean I don't struggle it don't
[1:18:21] mean I don't I don't get under
[1:18:22] desperation do the best I can do but in
[1:18:25] the end it's ultimately up to
[1:18:27] him he's who put the fight in me if I
[1:18:30] have a fight in me he put the fight
[1:18:33] there that gives me peace to know that
[1:18:35] it's going to work out in the end so
[1:18:39] Joshua placed Israel in a natural land
[1:18:42] we have been placed in a spiritual land
[1:18:43] of
[1:18:45] promises but they're individual promises
[1:18:47] to individual people and maybe in your
[1:18:49] life you've dealt with a lot of sickness
[1:18:51] so maybe God wanted to heal
[1:18:53] you think about this for a
[1:18:56] minute the man who was blind remember
[1:18:58] the man who was born blind and the
[1:19:00] disciples got real legalistic you know
[1:19:02] and pharc and they stood there and said
[1:19:05] now did he sin or did his parents sin it
[1:19:08] had been pretty hard for him to sin get
[1:19:10] punished for it he was born
[1:19:12] blind they said did he sin or did his
[1:19:14] parents sin and Jesus said no that the
[1:19:16] works of God might be manifest in his
[1:19:19] life he was born to be healed
[1:19:24] church he was born with a purpose and
[1:19:28] that purpose was to wait 30
[1:19:30] years and then be healed I wonder church
[1:19:34] we we don't realize sometimes the things
[1:19:35] that we deal with is for a purpose that
[1:19:38] maybe we were born for the purpose that
[1:19:41] that that God the glory of God one day
[1:19:42] would be shown in us at the right time
[1:19:44] he said when will that time be by the B
[1:19:46] I don't know I don't know how long it'll
[1:19:48] take I don't know what the journey is
[1:19:50] going to look like I don't know how hard
[1:19:52] the mountain might be and how high it
[1:19:53] might be but I know you climbing because
[1:19:55] you were born for that purpose that's
[1:19:58] your
[1:19:59] allotment we wonder sometimes why a
[1:20:02] person think about the the little
[1:20:04] Mexican baby that passed away in brother
[1:20:06] R's meeting died in the morning but she
[1:20:10] was born into a family with a mother who
[1:20:13] had a I guess an extra dose of faith and
[1:20:16] perseverance that little woman wouldn't
[1:20:18] take no for an answer and when when the
[1:20:21] when the crowds she wouldn't let the
[1:20:23] crowds get in way but she crawled under
[1:20:24] people and over people trustees tried to
[1:20:27] stop her and couldn't or ushers tried to
[1:20:29] stop her and couldn't stop her and
[1:20:31] everybody tried to stop her and couldn't
[1:20:32] stop her and so brother BR said finally
[1:20:35] you go pray for her he told Brother
[1:20:36] jackmore you go pray for her he said she
[1:20:38] won't know the difference so he goes
[1:20:40] down to pray for and all of a sudden
[1:20:41] brother man sees a vision of that baby
[1:20:44] being well that dead baby laying in a
[1:20:46] blanket been laying there dead all day
[1:20:48] why was that baby born why was that
[1:20:50] mother born so that you could hear that
[1:20:52] story so that we could take take courage
[1:20:55] and know that God still raises the dead
[1:20:57] he was born for the glory of God and you
[1:20:59] were born for the come on Church you
[1:21:01] were born for the glory of God to
[1:21:03] exhibit God in your
[1:21:05] life yes maybe you've gone through some
[1:21:09] hardship but remember it all work toward
[1:21:11] the glory God all things someone say it
[1:21:14] with me all things work together for
[1:21:17] good to them that love God and are the
[1:21:18] called according to his purpose yes
[1:21:23] sir sometime you got to quit blaming God
[1:21:25] I I said something Sunday night when it
[1:21:28] come to our marriages and getting
[1:21:31] married and you got to believe that
[1:21:32] God's Not The Village
[1:21:36] Idiot sometimes we treat him as if he
[1:21:39] is we treat him as this because of our
[1:21:41] past we want to whine about that and we
[1:21:43] want to carry on about what our past has
[1:21:44] been all the things we've been through
[1:21:46] and I understand I don't mean to be
[1:21:47] harsh with you but I do it too how hard
[1:21:50] the road's been not recognize God let us
[1:21:53] go through that
[1:21:55] job had a revelation in the mean times
[1:21:56] we don't have job said if I got a
[1:21:58] problem it's with God right if there's
[1:22:01] an issue with way things have gone it's
[1:22:03] not with my friends it's not with my
[1:22:05] wife it's not with somebody else he said
[1:22:07] I want to talk to God because if I could
[1:22:08] talk to God God would explain to me why
[1:22:11] I've been through what I've been through
[1:22:12] see that's what's going to hold you
[1:22:13] Church there got to be an Abiding Faith
[1:22:15] in an everlasting God a faith in a good
[1:22:18] god a God who will not who will keep his
[1:22:20] word who will not reneg on his promises
[1:22:23] who will not give up on you you
[1:22:25] right yes you got to believe in that
[1:22:28] kind of a God Amen good job had to say
[1:22:32] God if I get talked to you and finally
[1:22:33] had a conversation with god maybe it
[1:22:35] wasn't what he expected to hear job
[1:22:37] expected to be able to complain and God
[1:22:39] basically told him to shut up read the
[1:22:42] book of Job he said listen to me for a
[1:22:44] while where were
[1:22:47] you where were you job why he knew where
[1:22:50] he was in the mind of God the sons of
[1:22:54] God sh together for joy and so he never
[1:22:56] did tell him why he took away his family
[1:22:58] never did tell him why he just restored
[1:22:59] it to him what so we could hear the
[1:23:01] story so we can read it as part of the
[1:23:04] scripture job was just God's God's
[1:23:07] guinea pig if you can say it that way to
[1:23:09] show that the inoculation of Faith Works
[1:23:13] and every one of us are going to prove
[1:23:15] to the devil that it still works today
[1:23:17] that this message works that there will
[1:23:19] be a people come out of Leo to see you
[1:23:21] there will be a bride without spot or
[1:23:22] wrinkle you're going to prove that to
[1:23:24] the devil before you get out of here
[1:23:28] right excuse me for yelling at you
[1:23:31] tonight but you are you are predestined
[1:23:35] to a
[1:23:37] place I'm not getting very far but we
[1:23:39] can pick it up later brother Brandon
[1:23:41] says but now to the
[1:23:43] place he said how are you in other words
[1:23:46] how are you put there you are first born
[1:23:48] into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost he
[1:23:51] said the next you are predestined unto
[1:23:53] what adoption what is it you're
[1:23:55] predestinated unto
[1:23:57] placing and he explained that there
[1:23:59] there was a Doctrine then that Jesus was
[1:24:00] there in a physical body and he was
[1:24:02] wandering around the earth and if you
[1:24:03] happen to meet up with him you could be
[1:24:04] healed brother BR said that wasn't true
[1:24:06] he said his holy spirit's here and he's
[1:24:09] trying to place his church to get his
[1:24:11] church in order place it in the promised
[1:24:14] land so they can enter so that all the
[1:24:16] enemies can be drove out brother Bon
[1:24:19] begin to explain we'll just take the
[1:24:21] next few minutes and deal with this how
[1:24:23] that how that the people not
[1:24:26] understanding their place affected the
[1:24:29] Pentecostals and affected his own
[1:24:32] Ministry he said Manasses can't take his
[1:24:35] land right he said I can't have a
[1:24:37] healing service he said when have go out
[1:24:40] there and preach the baptism in the name
[1:24:41] of Jesus Christ and the trinitarian
[1:24:43] brother say oh he's old Jesus
[1:24:45] only now I'm just going to get real with
[1:24:48] you it's about that bad today we label
[1:24:51] preachers without even looking to see
[1:24:52] what they're actually preaching come on
[1:24:54] now well they come from this or this is
[1:24:57] what they are look at what they're
[1:24:58] preaching is it the word if it's not
[1:25:00] rejected but if it is
[1:25:03] accepted right but we look at
[1:25:05] associations and who they preach for and
[1:25:07] where they come from that could be a
[1:25:09] wolf and sheep's
[1:25:10] clothing right look at what they're
[1:25:13] preaching see if it's if it goes with
[1:25:15] the word or not and he said I can't go
[1:25:18] over here and have Divine Healing when
[1:25:19] half of them says Divine Healing is all
[1:25:20] right he said a lot of them enjoy the
[1:25:22] Miracles of the Lord and say well I
[1:25:24] believe brother BR is a prophet let me
[1:25:26] tell you something as long as the
[1:25:27] spirit's on him he's Discerning he's the
[1:25:29] Lord's servant but his teaching is
[1:25:30] rotten it's no good he said whoever
[1:25:32] heard of such Tommy R it's either of God
[1:25:34] or it isn't of God see if he's a false
[1:25:38] teacher what that would make him if if
[1:25:40] his teaching was false and he had signs
[1:25:43] it'd make him somebody you need to run
[1:25:45] from right it don't make him somebody to
[1:25:48] celebrate that's how the modern
[1:25:50] Pentecostal World tries to make it fit
[1:25:52] with brother BR because they realize he
[1:25:53] was a prophet and they realized he was a
[1:25:56] great man of God who did things no one
[1:25:57] else had done in the last 2,000 years we
[1:26:00] hadn't seen that kind of
[1:26:01] ministry right but then they realized
[1:26:04] that that happened so they tried to say
[1:26:05] well he was a good man and a prophet but
[1:26:07] you can't believe his Doctrine right
[1:26:09] well then that kind of man that's a
[1:26:11] false teacher you need to run from him
[1:26:12] an
[1:26:13] antichrist right some of the said don't
[1:26:15] work like that e either the sign is of
[1:26:19] God and the word is of God or he's false
[1:26:22] completely right and it could be a false
[1:26:24] anointed one but you don't listen to a
[1:26:26] false anointed one you run from him
[1:26:28] right right so it's either all God or
[1:26:31] none God he said that's the way it is
[1:26:33] but how you going to have he said
[1:26:34] Manasses won't keep his ground Ephraim
[1:26:36] won't keep his ground Gad won't keep his
[1:26:38] ground Benjamin won't keep his ground
[1:26:40] they're all running out here with the
[1:26:42] Philistines and all mixed up see we
[1:26:44] don't belong out with the Philistines
[1:26:46] right we belong together come on but in
[1:26:49] many places you know it's gotten to
[1:26:50] where it's hard it's easier to get
[1:26:51] fellowship with denomination than it is
[1:26:53] with the message that that shouldn't be
[1:26:55] that way church right we should be
[1:26:57] fellowshipping with one another we don't
[1:26:59] belong with the Philistines come on let
[1:27:01] them feel their part they got a part too
[1:27:03] but that's not our part
[1:27:07] right there's good people out there just
[1:27:09] and there's bad people around the
[1:27:11] message but we belong here
[1:27:14] yes this is where we belong sure there's
[1:27:17] people that don't live it there's people
[1:27:19] there'll be if you go to church very
[1:27:20] long you don't have to go very long to
[1:27:22] find out there's people that don't live
[1:27:23] the gospel they claim to
[1:27:25] believe claim a whole lot more than what
[1:27:27] they live and and I hate that I don't
[1:27:29] want to be one of those people but I
[1:27:31] recognize this I belong here in the
[1:27:33] message of the hour there might be
[1:27:35] Hypocrites but there's good godly people
[1:27:37] as well there might be people doing it
[1:27:39] wrong but there's somebody doing it
[1:27:40] right and this is where you can be
[1:27:42] Washed by the Water of the word this is
[1:27:44] where a hypocrite can turn his life
[1:27:46] around and become a child of God yes
[1:27:49] huh we're not we're not going to just go
[1:27:52] out and fellow and and start fellowship
[1:27:54] with the Philistines cuz the can't get
[1:27:56] along with each othero I know that's
[1:27:58] that's tough but how are we going to get
[1:28:01] placed brother said we have been born by
[1:28:03] the Holy Ghost all of us what are we
[1:28:05] born to predestinated after we're born
[1:28:07] we're predestinated unto the adoption to
[1:28:09] be placed in the body of Christ what is
[1:28:12] the body of Christ some are Apostles
[1:28:14] some are prophets some are teachers some
[1:28:16] are evangelists some are pastors is that
[1:28:18] right he said we're called to others has
[1:28:21] Gifts of tongues interpretation of
[1:28:22] tongues wisdom knowledge miracle Ires
[1:28:25] working of Miracles all these different
[1:28:26] gifts and now what they do he said they
[1:28:28] practiced that a little bit so the
[1:28:31] Pentecost had enough Faith to believe
[1:28:32] that God kept his word right so they
[1:28:35] believe that the gifts were for
[1:28:37] today but what happened is they all
[1:28:39] started wanting the same one yeah right
[1:28:42] and that was tongues everybody wanted to
[1:28:45] speak in tongues they made it the the
[1:28:48] the evidence of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:28:49] obviously not according to the scripture
[1:28:51] amen but they made the tongues the
[1:28:53] evidence of the Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost and and what they would do is and
[1:28:57] some of you that come from Pentecost can
[1:28:58] amen that they preacher start preaching
[1:29:00] they interrupt the preacher interrupt
[1:29:02] the service there's no order and brother
[1:29:05] Brandon said they would call the
[1:29:06] preacher a backslider if he continued
[1:29:08] with his message because they believed
[1:29:09] God had spoken well wasn't God speaking
[1:29:11] through the preacher wasn't God speaking
[1:29:14] through the
[1:29:15] word right but they didn't want the word
[1:29:17] they wanted something
[1:29:18] Sensational and so uh and so he said
[1:29:21] they got out of their place and so so he
[1:29:24] said the Bible said the spirit of the
[1:29:25] prophets is subject to the prophet God
[1:29:27] is no author of confusion right he said
[1:29:29] when I'm standing here a minister under
[1:29:30] the anointing of God he said no matter
[1:29:32] how much you want to speak with tongues
[1:29:34] he said you hold your peace till God's
[1:29:35] finished here right he said then if you
[1:29:38] speak with tongues it can't be just some
[1:29:39] repeating of scripture because God said
[1:29:41] don't use vain repetition but it's a
[1:29:43] message directly into to somebody and if
[1:29:45] you go read this the brandom deals with
[1:29:47] this very specifically and talks about
[1:29:49] what what it ought to be and and he said
[1:29:52] it's not just something generic he said
[1:29:54] we are predestinated unto the adoption
[1:29:56] of sons adoption we're born into the
[1:29:59] spirit of God sure receive the Holy
[1:30:01] Ghost and cry Abba Father Hallelujah
[1:30:03] glory to God he said we're that's right
[1:30:05] we're children he said but we can't get
[1:30:08] nowhere right we can't whip the
[1:30:10] Philistine right every one of us got a
[1:30:12] Philistine we need to whoop come on are
[1:30:15] you with me now every one of us got some
[1:30:18] Amorite or hiide or deite or website has
[1:30:21] been said many times something that we
[1:30:22] need to we need to beat
[1:30:24] yeah right every one of us got
[1:30:27] depression or or anxiety or or sickness
[1:30:31] or something that we need to we need to
[1:30:33] space head
[1:30:34] on every one of us do it may be
[1:30:38] different different people maybe the
[1:30:39] person that doesn't deal with depression
[1:30:41] doesn't understand a person that's got
[1:30:42] it person that doesn't deal with anxiety
[1:30:44] doesn't understand a person that's
[1:30:46] anxious but yet you know they weren't
[1:30:48] called to your battle you're called to
[1:30:49] your battle you got to fight your battle
[1:30:54] deal with that that Philistine and the
[1:30:55] reason many times we can't get nowhere
[1:30:57] we can't whip the Philistine is because
[1:30:59] we're too busy looking at each other
[1:31:01] fighting with one another not
[1:31:03] everybody's going to understand you
[1:31:04] that's okay move
[1:31:06] on look forward and fight the enemy with
[1:31:09] all that you got and help your brother
[1:31:11] all that you can brother BR talked about
[1:31:14] Billy Graham and the Muslim and how he
[1:31:16] was challenged he couldn't meet the
[1:31:17] challenge he talked about Joe Lewis who
[1:31:20] was an atheist a boxer and a Church of
[1:31:23] Christ Minister who who got up with Joe
[1:31:24] Lewis and condemning Jack Co I guess
[1:31:28] they had some kind of press conference
[1:31:29] or something condemning Jack
[1:31:31] Co and he said he talked about a church
[1:31:35] that calls himself Church of Christ
[1:31:36] shaking hands with him with Joe Lewis
[1:31:38] taking sides against brother Jack Cole
[1:31:40] he said how are we going to do anything
[1:31:42] and the Pentecostals many of them
[1:31:44] against him when every preacher in our
[1:31:45] land ought to stand toe-to-toe with him
[1:31:47] and say God send down your power see
[1:31:49] there we are where it can't be placed so
[1:31:51] if we see God anointing a special
[1:31:53] Ministry we ought to all be willing to
[1:31:55] stand there and say God we want to fight
[1:31:57] for him and if we see it get off the
[1:31:59] word call it
[1:32:01] out right but as long as it stays on the
[1:32:03] word support it no matter what church it
[1:32:06] comes from come on church it's hard for
[1:32:08] even me to do but it's true no matter
[1:32:10] what church they come from no matter
[1:32:11] what their background is no matter but
[1:32:13] if it's a man of God living the word and
[1:32:15] he's preaching the word and God's using
[1:32:17] that let me get behind it because it
[1:32:19] might be something that'll help my
[1:32:20] children might be something that'll help
[1:32:21] the church
[1:32:24] huh good we we don't want to move with
[1:32:26] political mindedness right we want
[1:32:29] something that'll help he said God send
[1:32:32] down your power see there's where we it
[1:32:34] can't be placed he said Ephraim don't
[1:32:35] want to stay them go over here we find
[1:32:37] Manasses gets over here said oh my lords
[1:32:40] give me a good corn field he said then
[1:32:42] Here Comes Gad said well now wait a
[1:32:44] minute I'm supposed to raise oats but
[1:32:46] I'm gonna get some corn too
[1:32:50] Hallelujah you can just see that what a
[1:32:52] great picture you know they're both on
[1:32:54] their little corner you know and he's
[1:32:55] over here raising oats and and that corn
[1:32:58] looks so good his oats maybe mature at a
[1:33:01] different
[1:33:03] time so they don't look so good right
[1:33:06] now so he's watching that corn field man
[1:33:09] if I could only be like Andrew Glover I
[1:33:10] mean the cornfields you
[1:33:12] know right I could preach like that and
[1:33:15] maybe I'll try to mimic
[1:33:17] him try to raise some corn that's not
[1:33:19] what we can do right we got to be
[1:33:21] ourselves well if I could just be
[1:33:24] brother Joel you know I thought that you
[1:33:26] know if I could be just like Joel you
[1:33:27] know and and but that wouldn't
[1:33:30] work it wouldn't be me it's not my
[1:33:32] pasture it's not my corn field right or
[1:33:35] my oats
[1:33:37] field he said see you ain't got nothing
[1:33:40] to do with corn get
[1:33:41] oats oats is your part to
[1:33:44] raise see you got to find that brother
[1:33:46] Peter that's the challenge when you're
[1:33:48] young when you're when you're just
[1:33:50] starting out especially is finding where
[1:33:52] you fit what you should be doing you're
[1:33:54] not called to do everything find
[1:33:57] something and do
[1:33:58] it are you with me now sometime we want
[1:34:01] to specialize in everything and really
[1:34:03] we end up specializing in nothing find
[1:34:06] something God called you to do find
[1:34:08] something you can do find something
[1:34:09] God's anointing you to do and stay there
[1:34:12] in it work that field if it's opening
[1:34:14] the door if it's shaking hands with
[1:34:16] people if it's helping out in the
[1:34:17] kitchen whatever it is find it and do it
[1:34:19] yes good good find what you're good you
[1:34:23] say well if I'm not if I can't do what
[1:34:24] they do I'll just sit down and do
[1:34:25] nothing don't ever get like that amen
[1:34:28] God help us never to get that way that
[1:34:30] temptation's there man sometimes I just
[1:34:32] want to quit I hear preachers and I just
[1:34:35] want to quit or I want to get up here
[1:34:38] and say something like this why don't
[1:34:39] y'all back me like you do
[1:34:46] them y'all running the aisles and
[1:34:50] jumping over pews
[1:34:52] and huh I want to stand up here and say
[1:34:54] well what about me I don't have that
[1:34:57] type of ministry and I know it yeah it's
[1:35:00] good but sometimes God will use me you
[1:35:01] know I went over to Oklahoma and brother
[1:35:03] trip watched the service he said he said
[1:35:05] You Preach over there like you wanted to
[1:35:06] be there I said well they amen that way
[1:35:08] you
[1:35:14] know but God made us different for
[1:35:16] different times it's okay to have a a
[1:35:18] sermon sometimes where we just lay the
[1:35:20] word in that's all right right it's all
[1:35:22] right to have church sometimes maybe
[1:35:24] we're not here all night but yet we felt
[1:35:26] uh the presence of God so real while we
[1:35:28] were that's okay to have a one hour
[1:35:30] service or a two-hour service whatever
[1:35:32] God wants us to have right this isn't a
[1:35:35] cookie cutter thing God calls all kinds
[1:35:37] of different men all kinds of different
[1:35:39] people all kinds of different musicians
[1:35:41] all kinds of let's just Place let's get
[1:35:43] in the field God called us to and stay
[1:35:45] there and work there come on
[1:35:49] Amen we always want to do somebody
[1:35:51] else's job well if if I could do that I
[1:35:54] you feel like you're not doing anything
[1:35:56] you end up in a position you don't need
[1:35:57] to be in that's why in some Churches
[1:35:59] everybody's a preacher not everybody's
[1:36:01] called to
[1:36:04] preach and you don't want to do that if
[1:36:07] you're not called to it trust
[1:36:12] me he said Hallelujah he said he said
[1:36:16] you can't tell them a thing about it no
[1:36:18] no they still got that
[1:36:19] nature he said but but but but but
[1:36:22] quoting the prophet
[1:36:24] but but but but but but but he said see
[1:36:27] you can't tell them that's right said no
[1:36:29] isn't that true and you can't place the
[1:36:31] church see he said the church is
[1:36:33] supposed to be predestinated unto the
[1:36:35] adoption of children just think about
[1:36:38] one man said you need to bring those to
[1:36:39] the altar your goat nature the church is
[1:36:43] supposed to be predestinated unto the
[1:36:44] adoption of children where a man God can
[1:36:47] take a man and adopt him into the family
[1:36:49] give him something he said first try
[1:36:52] that and see if it's right
[1:36:54] so when you get something don't go
[1:36:55] looking for something else say well I'm
[1:36:56] spiritual now try what you've gotten and
[1:36:58] see if it's right the Bible said try the
[1:37:00] spirit this man claims a certain thing
[1:37:02] try it and see if it's right if it say
[1:37:05] right move right with it and say Lord
[1:37:07] send us something else keep moving see
[1:37:09] just keep moving till every fellow takes
[1:37:12] his place and you're going to see the
[1:37:13] Church of God begin to take it its place
[1:37:16] he said then when the Philistines will
[1:37:17] go to back and up the shorts will go off
[1:37:20] hair will grow down faces will be washed
[1:37:22] cigars will be missing
[1:37:24] he said that's right when the church
[1:37:25] begins to get into its Mighty power when
[1:37:27] we have an anasis of fire and a few of
[1:37:29] them he said you'll see when that Holy
[1:37:31] Ghost Church that Holy Church stands
[1:37:33] together in his power positionally
[1:37:34] placed as sons of God adopted into the
[1:37:37] family of God a powerful Church standing
[1:37:39] there in his glory oh that's what he's
[1:37:41] coming for that's what I believe he has
[1:37:43] today a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:37:45] but we just need to find our place yes
[1:37:48] that's
[1:37:48] good and I'm so glad in this age we have
[1:37:51] a message that come to put us in our
[1:37:54] place a message to come to positionally
[1:37:57] place us that's the hour that we're
[1:37:58] living in the age of adoption if we
[1:38:00] could say it that way we can go to our
[1:38:03] place see we don't get to choose our
[1:38:06] gifts or callings they're without
[1:38:09] repentance I would choose a different
[1:38:11] one if I could but we don't get to
[1:38:13] choose but God gave Joshua the job of
[1:38:16] dividing or allotting the land to each
[1:38:18] individual tribe he told him he said be
[1:38:20] strong and of good courage for unto this
[1:38:24] people shalt thou divide for an
[1:38:25] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:38:27] their fathers to give them be strong and
[1:38:30] of good courage I think we all need to
[1:38:32] hear that brother wendle was here
[1:38:34] preaching and and I'll tell you
[1:38:37] something he told me he didn't tell us
[1:38:38] he was here preaching and brother wle
[1:38:41] has a certain way of putting things and
[1:38:42] maybe I wouldn't put things the same way
[1:38:44] brother wle does that's why God called
[1:38:46] different men but but you know and and
[1:38:49] we can all you know we all have to stay
[1:38:51] within our boundaries in that brother
[1:38:53] window said he was praying for somebody
[1:38:55] and and all of a sudden in the middle of
[1:38:57] the night he said he come to him go tell
[1:39:00] Ben PR to be strong and very courageous
[1:39:02] I took that as a personal you know I
[1:39:04] don't that don't have to be anything
[1:39:05] great but I think that was something
[1:39:06] that God wanted me to know be strong and
[1:39:09] very I think God wants you to know that
[1:39:11] or he wouldn't have put it in the
[1:39:11] scripture be strong and very courageous
[1:39:13] be strong and of good courage you're
[1:39:15] going to need courage to make it unto
[1:39:17] this people shalt thou divide for an
[1:39:19] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:39:21] their fathers to give them
[1:39:24] amen oh my be strong and of good courage
[1:39:28] now why would he need to be of good
[1:39:30] courage because he's going to tell some
[1:39:31] people what their land is they're not
[1:39:33] going to like
[1:39:34] it but they were born to do it yeah good
[1:39:38] yes yet they don't always mean you like
[1:39:40] to do it I'm I'm almost out of
[1:39:42] time look it's the holy ghost that does
[1:39:46] that for us it makes the word a reality
[1:39:50] I'm going to skip down we'll come back
[1:39:51] to my goodness what was I
[1:39:58] doing spent way too long on
[1:40:01] that brother brand talked about how
[1:40:03] Joshua fulfilled we know Joshua fulfills
[1:40:05] three types let me get this before we go
[1:40:09] he fulfills the type of Christ that's
[1:40:10] the main type of Joshua he's Jehovah
[1:40:12] savior right right he's the hly the Holy
[1:40:15] Ghost he's type of the Holy Ghost same
[1:40:17] thing he's the type of the end time
[1:40:19] Messenger right who carries a message
[1:40:22] which is Christ but he is a type of the
[1:40:24] end time Messenger as well it's all the
[1:40:26] work of the Holy Spirit and a body of
[1:40:28] Flesh you got to watch types because we
[1:40:30] get mixed up in types because we think
[1:40:31] if he's this type he can't be that and
[1:40:33] that's not the way it works because a
[1:40:35] type is just a shadow right it's not the
[1:40:37] real thing so Joshua Joshua was a type
[1:40:42] now brother brand said let us stand like
[1:40:45] Joshua and Caleb he said our promised
[1:40:47] land is coming in sight how many believe
[1:40:49] that tonight even as theirs did I'm way
[1:40:53] down there brother Robert I'm
[1:40:55] sorry in the pergan church age he said
[1:40:57] now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he
[1:41:00] represents the end time leader that will
[1:41:02] come to the church even as Paul came as
[1:41:05] the original leader Caleb represents
[1:41:08] those that stayed true with Joshua so
[1:41:10] there's a type here where Joshua is end
[1:41:13] time leader and Caleb represents those
[1:41:15] who stayed true with Joshua and we stay
[1:41:18] true to the messenger and the message we
[1:41:20] stay true to Christ not to his
[1:41:23] personality not to him some kind of a
[1:41:25] deity but to the message that he brought
[1:41:29] are you with me now because the message
[1:41:31] is
[1:41:31] Christ said we're not coming together to
[1:41:34] talk about the message we're coming
[1:41:35] together to get in the message and the
[1:41:37] message is Christ is the word we're to
[1:41:39] get into it get beneath it brother's
[1:41:41] whole point is that it's not say I
[1:41:43] believe the message or I believe the
[1:41:44] messenger you got to be in the message
[1:41:46] you got to be in
[1:41:48] Christ and again we we saw the preview
[1:41:50] of the Bride which each one of those
[1:41:51] young women kept their eyes on the you
[1:41:53] stand except for a few at the back
[1:41:56] remember who who had begun watching the
[1:41:59] American group and when they watched
[1:42:02] they got out of step and brother BR says
[1:42:05] this and and and someone actually sent
[1:42:06] me this quote and it just fit right in
[1:42:08] here it said keep in step with Joshua
[1:42:11] keep in step with Joshua that's right
[1:42:14] get the new grapes and the new
[1:42:16] Pentecostal wine how many want some new
[1:42:18] grapes and new Pentecost where is it
[1:42:20] it's in step with Joshua it's in the
[1:42:22] Promised Land
[1:42:24] he said get drunk on it brother he said
[1:42:26] you won't even have to look to the world
[1:42:27] anymore something will happen to you oh
[1:42:30] my he said oh let let us go
[1:42:34] forward amen following amen let us go
[1:42:38] forward following the steps of our great
[1:42:40] leader and conqueror he said remember
[1:42:42] God told Joshua every place The Souls of
[1:42:44] your footsteps that's possession brother
[1:42:46] he said them footsteps mean possession
[1:42:48] he said let's just keep walking into the
[1:42:50] promised land Not Looking Back to see
[1:42:52] what will happen back there what
[1:42:53] somebody else is doing is here using the
[1:42:56] type of Joshua as Christ he said keep
[1:42:59] your eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader
[1:43:03] keep moving on deeper depths and higher
[1:43:05] Heights oh I wonder if we could do that
[1:43:07] tonight until you possess everything
[1:43:09] someone say everything everything that
[1:43:12] God promised you in his word he said all
[1:43:15] men cannot receive this listen we
[1:43:17] shouldn't look down on people who can't
[1:43:19] receive it all men cannot receive it
[1:43:21] this is hid to the eyes of the world and
[1:43:22] fol to them but those who are born and
[1:43:25] elected to eternal life believe it
[1:43:27] there's something in you you were born
[1:43:28] to till this ground you were born for
[1:43:31] this message that's why you love to hear
[1:43:32] it that's why you love to hear it preach
[1:43:34] that's why you stay even though many
[1:43:36] others have left you were born for this
[1:43:38] piece of real estate called the message
[1:43:41] of the hour there's something about it
[1:43:42] you were born to it you might have been
[1:43:44] through all kinds of struggles seen
[1:43:46] false teachers and everything else rise
[1:43:47] up but you are born to till this piece
[1:43:49] of ground so you come back and fill your
[1:43:52] seat day after day year after year
[1:43:54] brother Herald decade after decade why
[1:43:56] you were born for this you were born to
[1:43:59] hear the message of the hour you were
[1:44:01] born to manifest it
[1:44:04] good
[1:44:08] Hallelujah BR said all men can receive
[1:44:10] it but we see the hour we liveing let's
[1:44:12] go forward let's go forward remembering
[1:44:16] it he said there's someone behind us all
[1:44:18] power on Heaven and Earth is given to
[1:44:21] him to the son to Christ
[1:44:23] what do we do we stay in the
[1:44:25] land when someone tries to push us off
[1:44:27] of it we say Joshua gave me this land
[1:44:30] yeah was spoken by a prophet revealed to
[1:44:34] me by the Holy Spirit right I'm keeping
[1:44:36] my eyes on Joshua oh yes oh I got so
[1:44:38] much more than we could say tonight and
[1:44:40] I had Skip by a whole bunch of this
[1:44:42] tonight we'll get to it maybe next
[1:44:43] Wednesday but let's be like Caleb let's
[1:44:46] be like Caleb who reminded Joshua the
[1:44:49] promise musicians go ahead and come
[1:44:51] reminded Joshua of the promise and said
[1:44:53] give me my
[1:44:55] Mountain give me my Mountain what did he
[1:44:57] say he said I'm I'm 80 years old today
[1:45:00] he said but I was strong strong as I was
[1:45:01] the first day that we came into the land
[1:45:05] the day we I got the promise he said you
[1:45:07] remember what Moses promised me I just
[1:45:09] love that he he didn't wait for Joshua
[1:45:12] to come to him he come to Joshua and he
[1:45:14] said you remember he said now I've been
[1:45:16] helping other people get their land I've
[1:45:18] been helping other people get their
[1:45:19] blessing but you remember we had a
[1:45:21] special deal you said that if I would
[1:45:23] wholly follow the lord God that I would
[1:45:25] have a certain piece of real estate and
[1:45:28] remember Caleb had went down there and
[1:45:29] spied it out he went into the land SPI
[1:45:32] it out when he did he saw a piece of
[1:45:34] real estate with the biggest Giants and
[1:45:37] the biggest walls and the toughest place
[1:45:40] in the country to take is probably the
[1:45:43] very place that the other spies looked
[1:45:44] at and said there's no way we can take
[1:45:47] it did you see Hebron did you see what
[1:45:49] it looked like did you see that hill
[1:45:51] where the anakites are they said that's
[1:45:53] the biggest of the bunch the ones with
[1:45:54] the longest necks the tallest ones big
[1:45:57] strong men
[1:45:59] yes and Caleb said that's my
[1:46:03] Mountain oh that God would give us a
[1:46:06] faith like that that's my Mountain yeah
[1:46:09] it's been a little bit difficult yeah
[1:46:11] there's been some things that have been
[1:46:12] tough but I was born to take that
[1:46:14] mountain that's my hill to climb that's
[1:46:17] the place I'm going to overcome in
[1:46:19] listen we all face Leo deia we Face a
[1:46:21] time when it's hard to be a young lady
[1:46:22] Lady it's hard to be a young man it's
[1:46:25] difficult to be a good Godly mother or
[1:46:27] Godly father but remember you were born
[1:46:29] for this land why don't you go to Joshua
[1:46:31] the Holy Spirit and say give me my
[1:46:33] Mountain don't remove the difficulty but
[1:46:35] give me strength to overcome it give me
[1:46:37] strength to comeing come on church can
[1:46:39] we not be stirred by the preaching of
[1:46:41] the word to say give me my
[1:46:43] Mountain give me what's mine in the
[1:46:45] message of the hour
[1:46:48] good and he obtained that promise the
[1:46:50] Bible says because he wholly followed
[1:46:53] the Lord God I want you I want you to
[1:46:56] know that we're sold out for the
[1:47:00] promise we burn our bridges like
[1:47:02] Alexander did his
[1:47:05] ships Alexander the Great crossed over
[1:47:08] the boss for straight he he he burned
[1:47:11] his shifts behind him he said we got a
[1:47:13] smaller Army than them he said but we're
[1:47:15] professional
[1:47:17] soldiers but the Bible tells us there's
[1:47:20] more with us than be with them
[1:47:23] may look like just you and Jesus but you
[1:47:25] and Jesus are a
[1:47:28] majority wholly follow the lord God be
[1:47:32] sold out to the promise I don't want
[1:47:35] somebody else's land I don't want their
[1:47:37] promise let me be sold out to
[1:47:40] mine I don't listen church I'm not a
[1:47:44] compromiser I I hope I don't come across
[1:47:46] like that I I believe in this word but I
[1:47:49] refuse to spend all my time looking over
[1:47:51] the fence what somebody else is doing
[1:47:55] what kind of a crop they're
[1:47:56] growing God help me I don't want to
[1:47:59] spend all my time looking at the other
[1:48:01] and preaching to them God gave me a
[1:48:03] piece of land let me till it until the
[1:48:06] young people come up in it and the old
[1:48:08] people come up in it and the people get

[1:48:27] will again at some point but I believe
[1:48:29] God is with me and God is with you and
[1:48:31] and he said Joshua looked at Moses he
[1:48:33] said I will be with you as I was with
[1:48:34] Moses and he said he knew God had been
[1:48:36] with Moses in his mistakes and he knew
