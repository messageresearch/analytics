[Applause] [Music] our heads together for a word of prayer maybe you'd have a special need you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand i believe his presence is here today and he promised he'd be here and we know his word is here and so we're going to ask him and believe that he'll meet every need heavenly father you see the raised hands lord and you see the need behind every one of them i pray god that you would just meet those needs today the lord is as we know you're here we don't have to feel you to know that you're here because you promised to be here but lord i'm so thankful that we can feel you i'm so thankful that you can still warm our hearts lord through all the trials and the tests of life and through time sometimes we can become a little hardened lord we we know today that you have warmed our hearts and we thank you for that just warm lord where we can receive the word we thank you for all that you've done thank you for meeting every one of these needs today lord perhaps while the preaching is going on or the word is is coming lord there be needs maybe we didn't even know about things that we didn't know that would you reveal that to us lord things that we need to do things that we should have said or maybe shouldn't have said i pray you'd grant it lord god i pray you'd heal every sick person lord thank you for your goodness the lord is beyond anything that we could ever imagine could have ever thought would be we thank you for that today lord we thank you for all you do and we ask you to bless this service now and take me out of the way and speak to your people we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you you love him this morning amen i know you do that's why you're here uh turn with me if you would we'll read from ephesians chapter two and verse one to begin today we'll have a lot of scriptures today ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1. we're going to have a baptism immediately after the service today my two girls wanted to be baptized today and um i can't tell you how that makes me feel as a father some of you have experienced that and you know you worry about your kids especially in the age that we live in now you know as they they're still young but as they get older there's less and less control that you have over things and and you wish you could they could still be young again you want them to be that baby where you care for them and they can't always be that but i'm so grateful that god has touched our hearts and i apologize maybe too much for being sentimental about things like that but you know if we can't be touched by the presence of god what can we be touched by by people uh you know there's there's joy in the presence of the angels when a sinner repents and every one of these children i'd like to see them come to christ before they get to that place and just really get solid in christ jason was baptized last week and joel's little boy and he began to testify to melody and she wanted to be baptized and and uh but he told her when he he said when i come up out of the water he said it was like he said i thought i was walking up to heaven i thought that's what every one of us are doing that's what we're doing we're walking up to heaven you just keep walking keep walking god will lead you and we're so grateful for that today and we know that god will add to the church the ones that need to be here but i'm so thankful for these little ones and i pray that god would just set a revival fire among our children and maybe they can teach us a few things about the grace of god and amen ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1. isn't god good to us today it says in you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins well that's enough to shout about right there isn't it he's made you alive he didn't stop with raising from the dead but he made you alive wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation our our manner of life in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who was rich in mercy for his great love were with theeth loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship cr aided in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we know that god is has unlimited ability his his ability whatever he would want to do he would be able to do right but if god had a budget and then we think about that like if you have a budget you have a certain amount of income a certain amount of money coming in and and that's what you're going to have and so you maybe you have so much for groceries so much for rent so much for uh for the mortgage and as you budget that out then you realize that maybe you need a little more and so you take some money off the grocery budget or you take some money off the budget for going out to eat because you got to have that budget's got to be right or if god had a budget it wouldn't be like ours because it would be unlimited in its income if you we can't even imagine that we can't even imagine that but in you know in this nation there's some people that are so rich that money is almost meaningless and we we live in a very wealthy nation but to god you know how would what kind of budget would he have if he had one it wouldn't be limited by resources but it would be limited because he limits the display of his attributes to a particular person place and time so there is a budget if we could say it that way a certain amount a certain time for mercy a certain time for for grace to be shown in your life and you can see that because you were called out when others weren't and you heard the message when others didn't even among the non-elect there's a different levels of mercy you think about it people in this nation have heard the gospel and there's some nations where they went hundreds of years before they ever even knew about christ and and they'll be judged based on their actions towards even the their own conscience and paul tells us that in romans chapter 1 that they'll the world the whole world was guilty before god right even those that are not heard but yet there was a certain amount of mercy that was given to them but so much more to us because we have heard because we do know and then you bring that down into the message of the hour and think there's so many people sam that don't know or haven't heard but i heard and you heard and maybe you were born in a message family maybe maybe you were born in an area where there were people maybe you heard about it in africa or wherever that you were where you were working you heard about the message of the hour and and it was mercy to you and to your life and but someone else didn't receive that mercy it comes to a particular person place and time and so we should never when we have the opportunity to so that he's given me opportunity and he's given you opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to hear from him i we should approach every service that way it's such a blessing to be able just to receive the mercy of god david tells us about the riches of god in psalms 104 and 1. he says bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great our clothed with honor and majesty who covers thyself with light as with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain it's just a curtain in his house amen who layeth the beams of his chambers in the water you know how proud you'd be if you built your own house with your own hands some of you are probably able to do that i built that with my hands how proud you would be that you were able to do that god laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed forever thou covered it with the deepest of the garment the waters stood above the mountains that thy rebuke they fled the voice of thy thunder they hasted away and he goes on now and you can read that maybe this week when you get home psalms chapter 104 in truth a wealthy god verse psalm 103 8 the lord is merciful and gracious so to anger and plenty is rich in mercy aren't you glad he is well he didn't have to be for me i beg to differ he had to be for me he said but you don't realize i was religious when i got saved that's the worst kind of a sinner this is a religious one the worst sinner in simon's house simon the pharisee's house was simon he was the worst sinner in the whole place but god rich in mercy extended mercy but he didn't accept it but a little prostitute down on the wrong side of the tracks god rich in mercy come at simon's invitation to sit right there among the people and they didn't wash his feet they didn't take care of him but god rich in mercy man there was a little a little prostitute down the street and she saw what was going on and she saw how mistreated he was and she sat there in the corner and got rich in mercy sitting in the corner with unwashed feet and she said i'll praise him i'll wash his feet i may not be worthy but i'll get down and worship him somebody's got to do it she saw a need that he had and god rich in mercy forgave her of her sins and set her on the right path god rich in mercy rich in mercy wealthy able to reach out even even with the ability to reach out to simon who he knew hated him had him there for the wrong reasons but he still showed up and he got that predestinated seed amen hallelujah the lord is merciful and gracious so to anger plenteous and mercy amen he says he will not always shine neither will he keep his anger forever i love the way he says this he says he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him so now he's giving us an understanding that god is great in mercy but he's it's the greatness of his mercy is reserved for those that fear him now and it doesn't mean that because they did everything wrong but they had respect to that god they had a fear for that god that was rich in mercy now and again he knew he would they would by foreknowledge but look there is i want to deal with this and you forgive me i'm trying to i've got so much on the on a plate today and i'm not going to hold you forever but i just want to try to get this as the lord revealed it to me but god is is so rich in his mercy and yet at times he will he don't deal with us according to our sins but he will extend mercy to those that fear him in other words those that will repent those that will acknowledge when his mercy is extended they get more mercy and that's why we should never sit and and and say well god's been good to me but then sit back on that and and not if something is revealed to us we need to repent quickly because if we hold on to that that that richness of that mercy is extended more to those who fear him those who respect him those who will acknowledge their need of mercy get more mercy and you can look at the example of david and saul and i don't have time to go into it today but those who will repent more mercy almost an unbelievable amount of mercy amen hallelujah now he says as far as the east is from the west so far hath you removed our transgressions from us he says like as a father pitteth his children so the lord pitteth them that fear him i feel that there are many dads here today you understand that you get that because you love your kids as a father loves his children pities his children has compassion on his children so the lord pitteth them that fear him for he knoweth our frame amen in other words he knows i'm human he remembers that we are dust hallelujah we don't remember that sometimes but god does god knows that we're dust god knows that we're not made up of much it just brother daryl said maybe five dollars worth of worth of materials god knows who we are he remembers that we're dust as for man his days are as grass as the flower of the field so he flourisheth and the wind passes over it and it is gone and the place there shall know it no more but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him amen and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his covenant to those that remember his commandments to do them now i want us to look this morning at god's mercy that he had for jacob in particular and you look at jacob and you think he didn't do a lot to deserve that why didn't god put up with jacob because he loved him same reason you put up with your kids you put up with your own children a lot more and you put up with somebody else you you may not have much mercy for somebody else but when it's your kids huh right it means something to be to be family it means something to be children of god and jacob was his son that was the one he loved that was the one he chose he loved jacob psalms 47 and 1 and i'm going to go through some things and talk to you about how god loved israel and loves israel today in fact he even says if you if you bless them i'll bless you if you curse them i'll curse you and you can even see that in nations today when they turn against israel god turns against them even today because he loved his jacob so much and so psalms 47 1 oh clap your hands all you people shout out to god with the voice of triumph for the lord most highest terrible he's a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet why us in other words why israel why jacob he said he shall choose our inheritance for us amen the excellency of jacob whom he loved he chooses the inheritance of jacob he put the reason there they exist today and they're in their land because god loves them and they they told him even in the old testament they said how have you loved us he said i love jacob and i hated esau and his love brother said they didn't understand his love was elected love now elective love now how have you loved us and we have to see that today he extends his mercy as not because they know more or can do more but because they're his family amen amen so now in romans 9 13 paul picks it up he says as it is written jacob have a love but he saw have a hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy there in the budget these others weren't in the budget they didn't get budgeted for and so when they may got one chance amen but this one got chance after chance after chance you realize esau the bible says he saw a place of repentance with tears one chance that's all he got but jacob had angels appeared to him and he saw visions and dreams and god corrected him and brought him to and worked all of his life until finally when he's 70 years old he's done everything wrong all his life and he finally comes and wrestles with the angel amen god appears oh my inner theophany form to those who he loves amen don't you realize he still appears today to those that he loves he appeared to us in this age in the message of the hour to those who he loved amen now so he says i'll have compassion on whom i have compassion and he says so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but god that showeth mercy was in the budget amen you were in the budget you didn't have to add an extra line later amen hallelujah amen now in the first temple when they and i'm just showing you how god had mercy to israel and how they understood that they recognized during the times and you look at it israel didn't serve god much if you look at the thousands of years of jewish history they serve probably other gods more than they serve god at different points in their history they never did they never were completely surrendered to god the way that they should have been but now they recognize during those moments when they would praise god and worship him for the mercy he extended to them they would recognize this that his mercy endures it wasn't a one-time thing or a one-time opportunity because when the first temple was built in second chronicles 7 6 it says the priests waited on their offices the levites also with instruments of music of the lord which david the king had made to praise the lord because his why because his mercy endureth forever amen so david made instruments for the purpose of worshiping the lord because his mercy endures forever and he said when david praised by their ministry david praised by their ministry and that's why we believe in music david would worship through the music and the musicians the songs that he'd written the musical instruments that he made was a worship to god and so when we play an instrument when you play an instrument you do that with all of your heart because it's a worship to god it's worship and and david praised by their ministry and we even will find ourselves we praised by the ministry of the musicians that's true and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood in the second temple in ezra chapter 3 and verse 10 it says when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with symbols so there you go they had i guess part of the drums said anyway they had symbols to praise the lord can you imagine that that levite and i don't want to get too far off on this but that levite standing there with his symbols his only job maybe was to clash those symbols once a day but his whole life was trained for that everything about him was trained just to clash just to play that instrument one time a day it had to be just so right and so perfect why because that was his ministry amen amen now he said after the ordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord so this one would sing and then this one would sing and and so there's it's right to have an order they had an order but it was worship to god right and so they sang together by course see you don't have to sing badly to worship god now you can sing badly and still worship god right but you don't have to sing badly to worship god you can sing good and worship god thank the lord play it good brother david and they sang together by course in praise and giving thanks to the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward israel they could look back at that first temple and say look what we've come through from then till now look what he's brought us to brother glenn you can look back when you got saved and you could say you were good then but your mercy endures forever look how much much mercy was budgeted toward israel that they denied him they turned their back on and go read the prophets how that they turned away from god and when they completely turned away from god god give them another temple amen amen another opportunity and they sang together and they worshipped god and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid see they could count on god's mercy even when they didn't deserve it listen to isaiah chapter 54 and 4 fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker he said is thy husband the lord of hosts is his name and the redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall be called shall he be called now watch he said for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit a wife of youth when thou hast refused saith thy god for a small moment have i forsaken thee that's why they can see his mercy endures forever for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee and even his forsaking them was a part of his mercy now look he said i've done that for a small moment now in a little wrath i hid my face from me for a moment i said so expressive in making this contrast for a small moment with a little wrath but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer he said for this is as the waters of noah unto me as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wrath with thee nor rebuke thee for the mountain shall depart and the hills will be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee no weapon he goes on to say in verse 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against the unjudgment thou shalt condemn he said this is the heritage of the servants of the lord what did we read earlier where do they get that heritage their inheritance comes from god he will make our inheritance for us because he loves us this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord he said well how much mercy would they use how would he ever know how much of his character how much to apportion to israel of mercy well he knew how much they would need and the budget for mercy to israel was as much as they needed now you understand that god gives you what you need now look in hosea chapter one let's look at this real quick look at the mercies of god i wonder today and thinking about mercy and just we have mercy god has mercy on us we have mercy to others i wonder what our budget for mercy is towards others boy it's quiet right i wonder how limited our budget for mercy is i'll go this far peter says peter's trying to make his budget you know how often should i forgive my brother seven times people thought he was being so generous you know no 70 times seven he said peter just blew peter's budget all out of the water what's our budget for mercy well if it resembles be like if we're like god if we're to be like christ it ought to be huge it shouldn't be small it shouldn't be an afterthought look at how the tender hand of jehovah worked to israel and he he magnifies this or he he shows this manifested in the life of the prophet jose it says the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go taken to be a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departed departing from the lord so he tells a prophet and and you say brother ben can you explain all this no i can't he tells a prophet to go marry a woman who he knew had an adulterous spirit he said go and marry her now again you would never do that i'd never advise someone to do that because the person that's done it once would do it again but god's showing look he's showing his mercy now he goes on he does deal with them harshly and and the proof that we are gods is that he deals with us as children right you know most of the time if you see somebody spanking a kid that's probably a parent maybe a grandparent but most of the time that's a parent right you just don't go up to random kids as much as you might want to take a belt to them and you know but but you do that to your own kids say well why would i treat my own kids worse than all these others you're not treating them worse you love them and the fact that you love them displays itself in your your level of correction toward them and so in jose two and four and you again you can go read this to later at home but he's she he tells jose he says i will not have mercy upon her children speaking of this woman maybe the children of whoredoms their mother has played the harlot she that conceived them have done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers they give me my bread and my water my wall and my flax my oil and my drink in other words they did things that would make them successful in the natural instead of leaning on god who would provide for them he said therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths now here's a straying wife and jehovah says i'm going to make it where everywhere she goes she runs into trouble because she's looking for other lovers how many times have we been corrected like this we're looking for you get your mind off of god you get a little backslid and things begin to start happening and god begins to bring correction into your life why is he doing that because he loves you she shall not find her past and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now now look they were punished for straying but god doesn't take revenge i hope you you get this today god doesn't take revenge he doesn't come out and and bring retribution on you because you did this i'm going to do this to you neither should we do that to our children god doesn't bring revenge what does he bring amen he comes with correction even his harshness towards her is the tender hand of jehovah and in jose 2 11 he says i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her new moons her sabbath he said and the he said and her solemn feasts and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees wherever she has said these are my rewards that my lovers have given me and i will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them and i will visit upon her the day so bailum when she burned infants to them and she decked herself with earrings and she went after her lovers and for forgot me saith the lord so he said i'm going to deal harshly with her. but look at the next verse therefore behold i will allure her it's a beautiful picture church i'm going to win her back even though she left me and it was all her in the wrong i'm going to win her back look at the heart of jehovah towards israel remember he's dealing with israel now i'm going to win her back even though she's the one who left me i know i'm taking my time but i'm i'm going to stop if we get beyond time so you just hang with me he says i will win her back i will allure her i'm going to flirt with her huh that's what he's saying i'm going to treat her like we were just getting married again amen i'm going to treat her like that i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her she don't deserve it no but that's what i'm going to do i will give her her vineyards from then from the valley of acor for a door of hope now you remember acor is where aiken was judged acor that is a place of judgment but it's also the entrance to canaan because remember they went to take jericho and they couldn't take it because of the sin and they went to take ai and they so many were ai rather and so it was after jericho but they went to take ai and and they couldn't take it because of aiken sin and so the valley of acre there was stones piled up there showing the judgment that had come on aiken but in the place where aiken was judged he said i'll make that a door of hope i'll make the valley of judgment a place of opportunity and she shall sing there is in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt verse 16 and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call me is she and she'll call me no more bailey my husband shall call me you're my husband not my lord verse 19 we're skipping through this at the same time he said i will betroth thee unto me forever yeah i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and mercies i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the lord he says i'm going to be so good to you that you'll be faithful can you imagine a god like that this morning church a god that would be so good to you it should be faithful that's what he did with israel now look he wanted her back so badly that in jose 3-1 didn't say it the lord unto me go yet imagine the heart of god he's telling jose to do this but in his own heart he's doing this for his own children go yet love a woman beloved of her friend her husband loves her but yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel who looked to other gods and loved flagons of wine so i bought her to me for 15 pieces of silver for a home or a barley a half homer barley is half the price of a slave she wasn't worth much to the world but he said i love her i said unto her thou shall abide for me many days i shall not play the heart thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee but you know there came a time when mercy was suspended for israel as a nation i want us to think about this for a moment because even though there would be mercy for them in the future there came a time when the door of mercy to israel as a nation closed though his mercy endures forever though all these things were true mercy towards israel because remember his budget is for a certain time at a certain place and a certain people amen and so paul says not all israel is israel right a certain time a certain people a certain place now in in jesus time he wept over jerusalem and he cried out he said oh jerusalem how often i have hovered over but you would not and and they opposed their own mercy and they cried out in in such a a fashion as to say his blood be on us and on our children what a thing to say his blood be on us and on our children now look in luke 23 33 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him brother branham takes those those words there there they crucified him four words he said it's for the greatest words in jerusalem the most holy city in the world the most holy people they the most holy people in the world crucified the most brutal death in the world him the most important person in the world and they offended against their own mercy god even even god in flesh wept over jerusalem and they said no we don't want it and so brother brown said it was the only true religion in the world think about that the only true religion in the world standing there crucifying the very god that their bible said would come now when god closes the door he opens another one when god closed the door of mercy to the jews he opened it to the gentiles and the jews didn't understand that and it was shown that it was shown in the story of the woman who was caught in the act of adultery they they condemned her they said that's all the mercy god has there's no mercy for this woman god said there's mercy because when she come before jesus he said who condemns you and she said no man lord and jesus said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more it didn't make sense to the jews that he would have mercy on her and sometimes you look at something and you look at somebody you say why are you even being nice to them well because we're supposed to be nice to everybody why even bother with them because i don't know they may be a seed of god why even bother why even bother with that person why be nice why be why be friendly amen he was friendly to us see the gentiles have been left for thousands of years in darkness but god was going to have a bride a people who he would extend his mercy towards amen that would not praise him and worship him just because of what he did but they would love him and they would not stray even though the denomination is time and time against straight but he said i'll have a bride who will not stray and that's us now look he says in romans it didn't make sense to the jews romans 9 and 30. what shall we say then the gentiles which follow not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore he said because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law they stumbled at that stumbling stone they didn't understand how could god have mercy on people who don't deserve it they stumbled at that stumbling stone and as it is written behold i lay inside a stumbling stone in a rock of a fence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed now look at this mercy extended down through seven church ages now he extended it from generation to generation and he extended mercy even to the non-elect because he said whosoever will may come so there's even a group of people that can be saved or can come to christ and come under that atonement because his budget for mercy but he budgeted especially for you [Music] but now we're coming down to the mercy for his bride now look god's mercy doesn't leave you in your condition amen it redeems you back what are you saying you have to be quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins amen brother branham and god rich and mercy and i'm i'm quoting some of this running through it without showing some of the quotes because it's just too much and you forgive me this morning but he says you were dead and many of you can look back and know that you were dead but you aren't dead tonight he said that was god rich and mercy amen amen you were a sinner but god who is rich in mercy and even talked about how when you were a child things were different and you felt that pull that tug on your heart why god rich in mercy amen amen and he talked about a duck born in a chicken house and how the duck would was born as a chicken and like was like the other chickens and one day he went out by the barn and he caught a smell of water and the day he caught that smell of water he immediately ran to the point because he was born to swim amen and so he says you have to be quick and it's like that duck that was in him already and it was quickened to life for the smell of water oh you know that's all we have to do that's all we have to do let's just get the smell of water in the air let's get the atmosphere right and children can be born ducks will run to it amen and some of the brandon picks that up and i will read this he said that's the same thing the believer is there's something in him that when he meets god face to face he comes to himself that seed is in him and it's quick and he said my that's right and he flies away from the things of the world they become dead to him he doesn't stay like that they become dead to him he said my i remember we all had our life in the past and those things of the world we all did every one of us did we had our life in the past of those things of the world none of us can say that we come to this message pure none of us can even if we were born in a message home even if we were raised on a church pew none of us come in pure every one of us was we were all found in sin born in sin shaping in iniquity amen but something quickened us and brother member says once we got a hold of the real thing something that quickened us a little seed to come to life and all the things of the world rotted right there we had no more desire of it amen he said he that's born of god does not commit sin the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin no more desire to sin the sin question is over yes you make mistakes yes you mess up but there's no more desire there to do it you don't want to go against god you don't want to run through the roadblocks you want to come towards god the sin question is over either it's not a question should i do it or should i not you know you shouldn't do it and you don't do it when you when you buy when you make a mistake you you repent quickly you can make a great mistake but you'll repent quickly now he says he says to the sin question is over you become a part of god in christ christ died to redeem you and just think and but the random talks about that in this sermon just think of all we would have been if it hadn't been for god but god in his rich mercy how he redeemed us out and where would we be if it hadn't been for that rich mercy amen but you know that's why god sent us a message this message was more than just do's and don'ts it was mercy it was mercy i don't want to reject mercy i don't want to live a holiness lifestyle even in dress and actions things like that just because just because well that's just what we do it's our tradition no we do it because we love god and we we don't have any desire to not do it anymore and the problem is the desire has to change the desire has to say there's got to be something in you you don't want well you don't have to tell a person with no desire you take a woman with no desire to attract the eye of a man you don't have to tell her to dress right huh she's got no desire she don't have a lust fail anymore she got a the veil of the holy spirit on her life amen and god sent us an end time message and told us those things even those little things about how we dress how we live things like that we think why would he tell us that because it's his mercy this mercy that can hold a family together this mercy that can bring you that can redeem you from a horrible background drugs alcohol whatever that is redeem you and bring you up to a full-fledged child of god let me tell you this this morning no matter what you've done where you've been you don't become a lesser child of god because of what you've done or what you might have struggled with and i know there's people i know that some of you have confessed things that and you talk to me about things and and you think well this is what i used to be and you struggle with that sometimes for years i know people sometimes struggle with different things in their life sometimes minor things but see it's no difference to god but but he'll make you a lesser son of god or lester daughter of god because of the way you were you're a full son of god or you're not at all his mercy endures for you or you're not elect at all does that make sense and we've talked about that before who's qualified to be the elect well you weren't if you want to take it by what you did why because the gentiles who followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness amen amen and yet that mercy on the gentiles will not last forever it's limited in fact it's almost empty think about that the the age of mercy to the gentiles there's a limit on it and it's almost up that ought to make us want to reach out to every person don't you realize it's almost up and yet we live in such an age of hardness people can't be touched but here while there's still mercy the gentiles account is we know that it is because the age we live in we've been talking on wednesday night about we started last wednesday night about the breach and as we get into that you realize this is the time of transition this is it during the seventh angel sounding this is when the lamb leaves the mercy seat this is it somehow during this time you say you know every in and out every day and everything like this no but i know this he has mercy on me he'll have mercy on you but not unlimited in time there will come a day when it's over listen what paul tells the gentiles he said if god spared not the natural branches stay he lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them that fail severity towards the jews god was severe but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou shalt be cut off the true understanding of election predestination and mercy doesn't make you sin more it doesn't make you make it easy for you to sin it makes it horrible it makes it hard because you realize what great love that's been shown toward you you see we shouldn't be arrogant because there is a limit of god's mercy to this age hebrews 6 and 4 it says it speaks of a limit of mercy even on a personal level he said for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and you know when they taste it they recognize it's the word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance it's impossible seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh put him to an open shame we could say it like this to jacob god gave opportunity after opportunity after opportunity the gentiles get seven church ages that's it it won't the door won't close and open back up again i know it's a sobering thought but that's why you don't speak against the holy ghost in this age right it's all you don't blaspheme because when you do you you get to where you say well how would i know well you wouldn't want to you wouldn't want to come back have no desire that's what's scary i'm not worried about those who struggle want to come back i want to come want to do right you worry about those who don't want to no more i don't want to no more i worked with two young people in a church not long ago and i worked with two young men and i watched those two young men's life and i've watched them over the years and the one young man was in the same family one of them was was just did some horrible things he was always messing up but there's something about his life that there's something about him i believe god's gonna working in his life and you can see that up and down in and out but god's working i saw another young man that was a good young man he just had no desire and as soon as he was old enough to quit church he just stopped coming to church didn't stop coming around and and fellowship and all those things just no desire that's a scary thing falling is not the problem it's when they don't get back up and again there won't be a second gentile age it's not like you get an opportunity and then god gives you another and then you get in this secret band of people who an airline pilot and a few other people in the movie and you know and and left behind and all these things that's not how god does things huh once it's over it's over but the member said i'd like to stop here on noah's witness and let you know this that there will come a time when men and women the church will be going right ahead preaching and believing they're getting saved and the door will be closed just like it was then he said if you're not in you get in now when would have been now he said brother ben you're preaching to the choir but every one of us needs to have an urgency in our lives now today is the day of salvation if i'm ever going to worship him now's the time if i'm ever going to get my kids and testify to my kids if i'm ever going to live a life today is today amen and so he says if you're not in getting now and so with the random goes on to talk about how elijah they said elias must first come and he said one day you realize what you're looking for has already passed and he said one of these days men and women will cry out it'll be too far be too late the door will be closed jesus said it would be that way the virgins come and knocked on the door and said let us in they wanted to get some of the oil but they ought to have got the oil got oil when oil was being given out mexico they ought to have got oil and oil was being given out they knocked on the door it said they were cast into outer darkness where they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth look at romans chapter 11 verse 25 look at this for just a moment before we close he said for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits the blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in the fullness the last one and so all israel should be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and he shall turn away ungodliness from jacob but this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel their enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes think about that statement people could be enemies to you for the gospel's sake i'm still elected it's true because that's the way the jews were he said for the gifts and callings of god are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all amen when does this happen when that last one comes in brother branham talks about how we believe in the coming of the lord we're looking forward to that but we don't know the day or the hour and he says this when the last one is saved there will not be one extra it'll be just so many and when that last one is brought in the body of christ is completed the rapture will come you say when will that be i don't know no one else knows could be today i might come out of the water and walk up to heaven we don't know none of us no i hope it's not because i've got other loved ones i want to see in the bride you understand i want to see them saved i know god will take care of my claim to them but i've got other loved ones i want to see saved but one day it will be the last one and none extra that's the budget that's it amen he came to redeem to bring back redeemers to bring back he says and when he brings the last one in he said at the right hand of god tonight doing his mediatorial work amen and when that last soul is saved that was redeemed and seen and known by god before the foundation of the world when the last soul is saved that closes the book it's over paul's thinking about these things in romans 11 and it begins to crowd like this he said all the depth of the riches amen both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments his way is past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord who hath been his counselor who gives him advice who is first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again he'll never owe you anything who's first given to him and it shall be recommended unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever you see there is enough mercy in the bank for every seed to be quickened and then the account is closed if you're in the budget you can't have not have enough mercy amen to make it in the rapture it's just impossible you understand it's just impossible so quit worrying well i've done too much no there's not that that's that's not even a thing even the whosoever will however many will can come how much more to the bride they knew you exactly where you would be what you would be and everything about your life and he says i've got so much grace for ben pruitt i did it and i said well i made stupid mistakes he said but i've got enough mercy enough grace to fill out that budget when i draw my last breath whether it's by way of the rapture or whether i go home by way of death when i draw that last breath the budget is complete with a zero balance you'll never run out before then if your gods how much is left you see the amount of mercy budgeted to your life is the amount you would need how about ought to make you want to cry like david worship with david but he said your mercy endures forever musicians go ahead and come there was a woman by the name of annie johnson flint she was a songwriter writer poems poetry and she got to a point where she couldn't write hardly anymore she had arthritis i watched people that suffer with that is such a horrible disease she got to the point where she was disabled she was unable to hardly do anything but she would still write her poetry and she wrote this song he giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater she knew something about that how much mercy would there be extended for annie johnson flint as much as she needed he sendeth more strength when the labors increase added afflictions he added his mercy to multiplied trials is multiplied peace you just keep going back to the atm of mercy and it's still there amen amen the course says his love has no limits his grace has no measure it's power no boundary known unto men for out of his infinite riches in jesus he giveth and giveth and giveth again and she went on to write when we have exhausted our store of endurance when our strength has failed when the day is half done when we reach the end of our hoarded resources our father's full giving has only begun fear not that thy need shall exceed his provision or god ever yearns his resources to share lean hard on the arm everlasting availing the father both be in that load will up bear would you bow your heads with me for just a moment he giveth the more grace when the burdens go greater [Music] more mercy you say when brother ben when the mercy is needed but there will come a day when there's no more mercy and you don't know you don't know listen church i believe i'm the elect of god but if i'm not i want to be whosoever [Music] lord let me focus on your grace and your mercy [Music] whatever part you would have for me to play i'd do it lord it won't be because i neglected to come it won't be because i neglected when you dealt with me you see if esau had been dealt with had come when he was dealt with the first time had not given up his birthright for a mess of pottage he could have had something some part but god knew that he wouldn't he said how do you know that because he told cain he said if you would do well take your brother's revelation and do what your brother does [Music] you didn't have it for yourself but even cain he gave a choice but cain wouldn't do it because the seed that was in him every one of us have an opportunity have an opportunity for mercy today god rich in mercy you think about that don't think your kids have sinned past the point of them being right don't think that your family has gone past maybe somebody in your family well they've gone past the point they couldn't be bribed maybe there'd be something else don't think that because you don't know how much mercy god has for his elect you don't know what the budget is if that's the elect of god it'll be however much they need amen jacob had however much you needed david had however much you needed amen god help me today [Music] he'll take you if you take advantage of that mercy he'll take you and seal you with the holy ghost amen so you can be sealed to your destination you won't ever want to go past his mercy again just talk to him a moment while we pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your mercy today i'm so grateful lord this service has gone differently than i thought it would but lord i'm so grateful for your mercy sometimes in these different moments you've got a reason for why things happen the way that they do i know i wish i could be like other preachers lord but i'm just myself i have to be myself and lord come before these people with my heart that's all i can bring i can't do any great thing but lord if i can just get out of the way enough to allow your mercy to flow oh god would you just do that in every one of us lord until we come in this last age and realize that mercy isn't for maybe for everybody but even for the bride the mercy flows from the bride oh god may we never get a spirit of harshness about us the time will be over soon enough lord while mercy is flowing would you help us lord to be merciful to be merciful to those around us lord to love those around us to treat them correctly and to respond quickly oh god it ought to be such an urgency in our hearts but the age is such a drag on us it's such a it causes us to become lethargic in our response like a person who's very sick and when your presence comes and things happen we just sit and not respond and lord if something happened like that we think that person is very sick and we see a world very sick today not responding to your mercy but lord when your mercy is shown may we be like even if we're like that prostitute woman lord that said i see that simon didn't wash his feet let me be the one let me be the one who worships you if no one else does i'm going to come to church i'm going to live for god i'm going to work i'm going to put my all into the service because i believe your mercy endures forever i know it endured for me i believe it will endure for others for you granted lord we're living even past the time we look merciest shut up to the denominations they've crucified you afresh lord maybe there's some people in there still that could have mercy you could have mercy on i pray you'd grant it today i pray you'd move lord in our midst lord as you're calling maybe you'll use this church to call that last one maybe some other church somewhere lord one day it'll happen lord and when that moment comes we'll go home we want that lord we want that but not till that last one comes in lord we pray you would help us mold our hearts and our minds to think like you to walk like you to to consider others the way you consider others i pray you'd grant it lord we thank you for it thank you for all that you've done for us in jesus name amen don't you love him today let's just sing him let's stand in worship sing this to him now worship him for a moment mercy thank you lord i'm so glad your mercy hallelujah oh god we worship you today we thank you for your mercy lord thank you for your mercy oh i should have fallen in my soul hallelujah oh mercy [Music] sing it again with all your heart now i'm so glad that mercy hallelujah glad that mercy [Music] mercy aren't you glad it did hey man brother david is sister sarah okay saw them leave and everything's okay amen well i i you know we we pray for all of our elderly folks that everything would be okay and each one you want to see anybody leave the service but i believe god is able to keep us all don't you aren't you glad he has you look back down in your life and say every time you stumble god lifted you up and every time you something might have happened and you just you could have destroyed your life and god brought you out maybe you did destroy your life and god didn't he just brought you back anyway how wonderful he is his mercy endures forever david i can see them clashing the symbols and worshiping god that is mercy endures forever we had a temple and we didn't serve god we didn't live for god we didn't do what was right and so the temple was burned down but now we got another temple amen hallelujah can you imagine how they'll feel on that day of atonement when those jews realize what they've done he said they realized that we crucified him he said where'd you get those scars in the house of my friends you imagine what that'll be like for the job of the steward to just when they stand there and realize what they've done and how they rejected him all these years with that 144 000 you think there won't be some worship going on you think there won't be some rejoicing going on the jews know how to worship they know how to dance before the lord and i believe they'll be doing it why because his mercy endures forever from generation to generation through a holy ghost through all these things all this persecution his mercy into us forever how much more does he love you because he even cut them off to come get you amen then it ought to be the cry of our heart lord i worship you because your mercy endures forever amen i should have fallen oh my soul hallelujah cast down all his mercy heroes and we're gonna we're going to baptize these two girls immediately after the service so if you just head over there we'll do that if you want to stay for that and then we can fellowship or whatever we'll do that but i want you to worship just for a minute isn't he worthy of our praise joel's going to come and let's just worship a moment and then we'll just go right straight over and do that and so you can those of you that want to stay for that can do that amen amen aren't you glad for his mercy today amen brother joel come lead us in worship [Music] amen mercy that rerolled my life [Music] my life jesus we just want to thank you for being so good jesus we just want to thank you for jesus we just want to thank you jesus we just want to thank you [Music] oh thank you for being so good

i'm amazed that you love me if you would you just missed to go next door to the baptism oh i'm amazed that you [Music] they're all washed away all my sins are washed [Music] [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] so sorry
