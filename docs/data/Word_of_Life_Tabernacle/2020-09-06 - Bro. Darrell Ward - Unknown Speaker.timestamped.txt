[36:19] thinking
[36:20] how young i was the first time i came
[36:22] into
[36:23] to arkansas to preach the gospel just a
[36:25] young
[36:26] fellow in my 20s and here we are i'll be
[36:28] 61 year old this month and
[36:30] you think where does time go you know
[36:32] just
[36:33] but here we have no continuing city
[36:37] but notice what paul said he didn't say
[36:39] there was a city that didn't continue
[36:41] that's not what he said paul just said
[36:43] that city's not here
[36:45] i'm so glad i've changed citizenships
[36:47] aren't you that we're citizens of the
[36:49] city that has no end
[36:51] praise god i was thinking as you were
[36:54] singing that song
[36:55] in moments like these it reminded me of
[36:58] when
[36:58] many years ago when my daughter was hurt
[37:00] so bad and been
[37:01] struck by the train and the two of my
[37:05] family was dead and
[37:07] was in the hospital with her and she had
[37:09] all these tubes running out of her
[37:11] everywhere they was in her neck they was
[37:13] in her stomach
[37:15] and i used to get her had a little
[37:18] rocking chair there in the room and i'd
[37:20] get her up out of the bed and get all
[37:22] those tubes where i could
[37:23] put her up in my arms and i would sit
[37:25] there and i would sing that song
[37:27] in moments like these i sing out a song
[37:32] then the day that the lord touched her
[37:34] was able to bring her home from the
[37:35] hospital and
[37:36] got home and 67 days of being in the
[37:39] hospital and
[37:40] all the people that come to welcome
[37:42] jessica home and after everybody left
[37:44] and it got quiet that evening
[37:46] i sat down and put her in my arms sang
[37:49] that same song
[37:50] in moments like these and i'm so glad
[37:52] that in the good moments
[37:53] and in the bad moments it does not
[37:56] change who he is amen
[37:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:59] forever may the lord richly bless you if
[38:01] you have your bibles this morning

[38:11] bless you

[38:16] certainly grateful to be over the coved
[38:21] virus i seen the other day i'm still the
[38:23] brother being there someone that said
[38:24] that cobit was nothing but a myth and i
[38:26] thought man if it's that bad as a myth i
[38:28] certainly don't want it to be a reality
[38:31] it's certainly not a myth it's real but
[38:33] we serve a real god

[42:25] you know it always amazes me
[42:28] that we serve a god that's so great
[42:33] we serve a god that's so awesome
[42:37] that he created not only a universe
[42:40] but he created universes and he created
[42:44] billions upon billions of stars
[42:48] and our god who created billions upon
[42:51] billions of stars i can't count that far
[42:54] i don't even have enough toes to count
[42:55] that far
[42:56] but billions of billions of stars and
[42:59] the bible says that the god we
[43:01] serve knows every star by name
[43:05] he knows all things he even knows the
[43:09] prophet said
[43:10] that every time that a gnat backs its
[43:13] eye i'm 60 year old i can't even see in
[43:17] that
[43:18] and yet god is so great that he knows
[43:22] every time that a gnat bats its eye
[43:26] the prophet of god says he knows every b
[43:29] think about this for a minute he knows
[43:31] every bee
[43:32] and where that bee goes in the comb to
[43:35] get its honey
[43:37] he knows every b and where every bee
[43:40] goes what part of the honeycomb
[43:42] that that bee goes to get the honey god
[43:45] knows that this morning
[43:46] lord that ought to make you shout
[43:50] he knows every sparrow that's in the
[43:52] tree he knows
[43:53] every sparrow that falls to the ground
[43:56] and he's mindful of it this morning
[43:59] he knows every thought that's in your
[44:01] mind today
[44:03] a god so great a god so knowing
[44:06] a god so awesome as i stood the other
[44:09] morning out in the field and was
[44:11] watching that comet
[44:12] that was passing through the area the
[44:14] first time and they said
[44:15] six thousand years santa said the last
[44:19] people
[44:19] on the earth to see this comet was adam
[44:23] and eve
[44:25] and to stand there and watch that in the
[44:27] sky as i took my camera
[44:29] and caught a picture of it about 4 50 in
[44:31] the morning
[44:32] and i stood there and i raised my hands
[44:35] and i said how great thou
[44:37] art god
[44:40] a god so great a god so knowing
[44:44] a god so awesome and yet
[44:47] he's a god who cares a god so great a
[44:51] god so awesome
[44:52] and yet a god so caring
[44:55] that he cares about the littlest aspects
[44:59] of our lives brother branham said that
[45:02] the
[45:02] god raised up that little bluegill on
[45:05] dale
[45:06] hollow lake to show us that god
[45:10] cares for the little things
[45:14] god's so great and yet he cares about
[45:16] something
[45:17] so little that he even cares about the
[45:21] aspects the littlest aspects of our life
[45:23] he even cares about our sleep
[45:30] think about this this morning for he
[45:33] said in his word
[45:34] when thou liest down to sleep
[45:37] be not afraid when thou liest down to
[45:42] sleep
[45:42] god said thy sleep shall be sweet
[45:47] you see god has given us a promise in
[45:49] his word
[45:50] that we can have a good night's sleep
[45:55] come on he wants you
[45:59] he wants your sleep to be restful
[46:02] he wants your sleep to be peaceful he
[46:05] wants your sleep
[46:07] to be sweet pleasant
[46:10] a god so great that he even cares
[46:14] about your sleep now listen to this in
[46:18] discernment the prophet in discernment
[46:20] he said a little lady sitting back there
[46:22] with a little white jacket or thing on
[46:24] you can't sleep at night do you believe
[46:27] the lord jesus is going to give you
[46:28] sleep from now on
[46:31] that you might know i was this prophet
[46:32] or a servant that's your husband sitting
[46:34] by you you believe god can heal him
[46:36] if god would reveal to me what his
[46:38] trouble is will you believe it
[46:40] then the arthritis will go from you sir
[46:42] you can go home now
[46:43] and be well and be a happy family
[46:46] because the man is healed of arthritis
[46:49] and his wife's going to get a good
[46:50] night's sleep he didn't call out cancer
[46:57] he didn't call out tuberculosis he
[46:59] called out a woman
[47:00] who was having trouble sleeping why
[47:04] you can go home and be a happy family
[47:08] because he cares
[47:11] you see brother branham mentioned can't
[47:13] sleep he put those two words together
[47:15] as i searched it through the message 38
[47:18] times
[47:19] did brother brandon mention those two
[47:21] words together
[47:22] can't sleep and out of those 38 times
[47:27] 15 different times was in discernment
[47:31] and while in discernment he mentioned
[47:34] that sleeplessness the inability to
[47:37] sleep
[47:38] 15 different times he mentioned it was
[47:42] caused
[47:43] by nervousness
[47:47] let me show you what i mean all right
[47:49] you believe now
[47:50] i see you're having some you you keep
[47:53] sitting up in bed you just keep sitting
[47:55] oh
[47:55] it's you you can't sleep
[47:59] it's your nerves isn't that right a
[48:02] nervous condition
[48:03] you just can't sleep at night
[48:07] here's another one this man is going
[48:08] from me years ago your trouble started
[48:11] you probably look 15 years or more
[48:13] younger than you are right now
[48:15] it's a nervous condition it has bothered
[48:18] you with
[48:18] nerve trouble i see you can't sleep
[48:21] you're patient around restless
[48:22] it's a nerve it's caused it's a nerve
[48:25] cause
[48:26] you don't know what it is the doctors
[48:28] can't locate what it is
[48:30] they don't know what it is but i'm
[48:33] telling you under
[48:34] discernment it's your nerves
[48:38] it's a nervous condition
[48:41] you had a you had a feeling move over
[48:43] you that's the angel
[48:46] of the lord oh i wonder sometimes you
[48:49] ever been in service and just that real
[48:51] sweet warm feeling come over you and you
[48:53] just want to raise your hands
[48:55] and you just want to praise the lord and
[48:57] a tear just runs down your face
[48:59] i wonder could it be the angel of the
[49:01] lord
[49:04] you had a feeling move over you that's
[49:06] the angel of the lord
[49:08] it is right here between us right now
[49:12] see see here now the lady's moving away
[49:15] from me
[49:16] she's very much distressed i see her in
[49:19] a bedroom
[49:20] she can't sleep she's walking up and
[49:22] down the floor
[49:23] she goes into another room she comes
[49:25] back she goes into another room
[49:27] she goes into a little place and gets
[49:29] some kind of something it's a little
[49:31] powder
[49:33] to take to go to sleep
[49:36] she's trying her condition her condition
[49:41] is a nervous condition and she's taking
[49:45] powders
[49:46] to keep asleep sleeping pills
[49:49] sleeping powders she's taking them to
[49:52] get
[49:53] some sleep and she's taking so many
[49:58] of the powders till they've just about
[50:00] got the best of her
[50:02] she's just about ready to go into a
[50:04] nervous breakdown and be finished
[50:07] that's thus saith the lord woman
[50:12] suffering with nervous condition taken
[50:14] so many powders
[50:16] to try to get some rest that the prophet
[50:18] said it's broken down to the point
[50:21] she's just about finished
[50:24] but the root of the whole thing it
[50:26] wasn't the mattress
[50:28] it wasn't the pillar it wasn't the air
[50:29] conditioning the problem was it was
[50:32] nerves it's to bind people with sickness
[50:35] and with fear and a lot of times people
[50:40] end up sick because in their spiritual
[50:43] realm
[50:43] they have this nervous problem or
[50:45] something is happening
[50:47] and it reflects over into the physical
[50:49] realm
[50:50] and many times because of nerves people
[50:53] get sick with their stomach
[50:54] they get ulcers they get headaches and
[50:56] it's nothing more than their nerves
[51:01] because satan uses that avenue you'll
[51:04] notice sometimes if you've ever been in
[51:05] a meeting when a demon manifests itself
[51:08] many times if it's a woman they'll speak
[51:10] as a man why
[51:11] because satan's trying to bring fear
[51:15] he feeds off fear
[51:20] amen one of his tactics is to bind us
[51:24] with fear to the place it makes us
[51:26] physically
[51:27] sick i'm just too nervous to go to
[51:30] church
[51:34] and now father you're moving showing
[51:36] signs and wonders
[51:38] the great atomic age is here nation
[51:40] against nation
[51:42] kingdom against kingdom the people are
[51:44] nervous
[51:46] you said it would be fear upon the
[51:47] people perplexity of time the stress
[51:50] between
[51:51] nations men's hearts failing for
[51:54] fear oh what a day we are
[51:57] living in this is not something that's
[52:00] going to be
[52:01] this is something that's here now we are
[52:03] in the atomic age
[52:05] the age of destruction
[52:09] amen men's hearts failing for fear
[52:12] perplex of time
[52:14] there's distress between nations the
[52:16] earth is getting so
[52:18] nervous until it's bursting forth
[52:21] earthquakes

[52:26] i was telling brother ben and him i was
[52:28] coming out of tennessee into missouri

[54:16] sometimes it is astounding
[54:21] how many earthquakes are happening
[54:23] around the world
[54:24] and the prophet said what is it it's the
[54:26] earth she's so
[54:29] nervous she's bursting forth earthquakes
[54:31] everywhere
[54:32] jesus said it would be that way there'll

[54:39] doomed and she's nervous the world's

[56:45] i could not even control my body my wife
[56:48] got me in the shower and packed me an
[56:49] ice trying to get the fever down and i

[57:37] the bride is secured in a time
[57:41] of trouble in the hour of gross
[57:44] darkness when gross darkness covers the
[57:47] earth
[57:48] and gross darkness covers the people
[57:51] is that where we're at absolutely the
[57:54] children of the world
[57:55] walk in darkness they walk at night time
[57:59] huh you ever seen them burning cities or
[58:01] burning
[58:02] buildings down in the daytime no way
[58:04] they wait tonight
[58:06] the riders come out at night wearing
[58:08] come on somebody
[58:09] they come out at night wearing black in
[58:11] the night time
[58:12] in the nighttime that's when the
[58:14] cockroaches come out that's when all
[58:16] those creatures come out
[58:17] why the darkness hallelujah they love
[58:20] the darkness more than they
[58:22] love light
[58:25] the bible said me and the people love
[58:27] darkness more than they do light
[58:29] because the light would manifest their
[58:31] deeds
[58:34] and when spiritual darkness gets upon
[58:36] the earth
[58:37] when the darkness is that dark when it's
[58:39] so gross upon the people
[58:41] and upon the earth it's that time that
[58:44] the enemy
[58:45] attacks we're at that hour
[58:49] of gross darkness
[58:52] my wife showed me a video clip the other
[58:54] day of a river that was out of its banks
[58:56] a raging river and there was a house
[58:58] there beside the river and as the water
[59:00] came out of its banks it began to come
[59:02] upon this house
[59:03] and the house began to move a little bit
[59:05] and right there before our eyes the
[59:06] house collapsed
[59:08] and was washed away in a moment of time
[59:10] it was standing there
[59:12] at the next moment you could never tell
[59:14] it had ever been there
[59:15] because the flood had carried it away
[59:19] amen it destroyed the house it broke it
[59:21] up it washed it away
[59:23] and the spiritual darkness upon the
[59:25] earth has opened up the floodgates
[59:27] of hell hallelujah to allow the god of
[59:30] this
[59:30] evil age to unleash his destruction
[59:35] to unleash it upon our communities upon
[59:37] our government
[59:38] upon our homes upon our families satan
[59:41] is like a flood
[59:42] the bible said he's like a roaring lion
[59:45] he's not a lion but he acts like a lion
[59:49] a raging river of water destroying
[59:52] anything
[59:53] in its path the world around us today
[59:56] is under a spirit of destruction
[1:00:00] and the prophet of god said before they
[1:00:03] can ever be destroyed
[1:00:05] they must first come under the spirit of
[1:00:08] destruction
[1:00:10] is that where they're at you can't
[1:00:13] hardly find anybody anymore that's not
[1:00:14] tattooed all up one side and down the
[1:00:16] other
[1:00:17] destroying their bodies putting all this
[1:00:20] they can't even go out in a lightning
[1:00:21] storm they got so much metal in their
[1:00:22] mouth and their ears and their nose
[1:00:25] destroying their bodies
[1:00:28] huh i saw the other day up there in
[1:00:30] kinslow wisconsin where they just had
[1:00:32] the right
[1:00:33] in two days 50 million dollars
[1:00:36] worth of destruction please tell me
[1:00:42] please tell me what burning a car
[1:00:46] dealership to the ground
[1:00:48] has to do with equal rights
[1:00:51] it's a spirit that's on the people
[1:00:54] to destroy what they don't agree with
[1:00:59] the council culture if you don't agree
[1:01:01] with them they will cancel you out
[1:01:04] priest brother thank you believe it will

[1:04:58] who ever thought that a virus would shut
[1:05:02] down churches around the world
[1:05:07] but you see things may not happen the
[1:05:09] way we think they'll happen

[1:05:15] look god didn't say ah i didn't know
[1:05:17] that was going to happen i tell you boy
[1:05:19] satan pulled one over on me that time
[1:05:21] i got to figure out how to no sir he
[1:05:23] knew it was going to happen
[1:05:27] amen what does it do it reminds me of
[1:05:30] the time
[1:05:30] that god was bringing israel to the
[1:05:33] promised land
[1:05:35] had a prophet they had a pillar of fire
[1:05:40] they were coming out of bondage they had
[1:05:43] a message
[1:05:44] they were in an exodus sound familiar
[1:05:48] a prophet with a pillar of fire with a
[1:05:51] message
[1:05:51] coming out of exodus in an exodus
[1:05:56] sound familiar and they come to cadence
[1:06:00] barnea
[1:06:01] a junction point a junction of time
[1:06:06] and god told them send spies into the
[1:06:09] land
[1:06:09] that i've already given you
[1:06:15] and they go in and search out the land
[1:06:19] and coming back was two of them it's
[1:06:21] packing grapes
[1:06:22] and they're just sweating and grunting
[1:06:24] and groaning
[1:06:31] they said my god did you bring the whole
[1:06:33] vineyard i said van you're nothing
[1:06:35] that's just one bunch
[1:06:43] and they said before the people it's
[1:06:46] just the way
[1:06:48] god said it
[1:06:51] god don't lie his promise is true
[1:06:54] it is a land filled with milk and honey
[1:06:58] but
[1:07:01] oh my you see goat's butt
[1:07:04] sheep say amen
[1:07:08] but they are giants in the land
[1:07:11] they are walled cities
[1:07:16] and we in their eyes look like
[1:07:20] glasshoppers
[1:07:25] and we just can't do it we've come this
[1:07:28] far
[1:07:29] first pool second pool we've come this
[1:07:31] far but we've reached the point
[1:07:34] we just can't do it we didn't know about
[1:07:38] these giants we didn't know about these
[1:07:39] walled cities
[1:07:42] oh it's a good land but
[1:07:47] think about it ten against two
[1:07:51] there was two there you know the story
[1:07:53] caleb and joshua
[1:07:54] an 80 year old man steered up he calmed
[1:07:57] the people down
[1:07:58] said everybody calm down give me my
[1:08:02] mountain
[1:08:06] but ten against two
[1:08:09] and they said we saw josh the son of
[1:08:11] enoch which come of the giants
[1:08:13] and we were in our own side as
[1:08:14] grasshoppers and so we were in
[1:08:15] versailles
[1:08:16] but the men that went up with him said
[1:08:17] we be not able to go up against the
[1:08:19] people for they are stronger than we
[1:08:21] and they brought up an evil report of
[1:08:23] the land which they had searched unto
[1:08:24] the children of israel saying the land
[1:08:26] for which we have gone to search out is
[1:08:28] a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:08:30] thereof
[1:08:30] and all the people that we saw in it are
[1:08:32] men of great stature
[1:08:36] and all the bible says in numbers 14 1
[1:08:39] oh the congregation lifted up their
[1:08:42] voice and cried and the people
[1:08:46] wept that night
[1:08:50] there was no sleep in the camp
[1:08:54] because of their fear fear had gripped
[1:08:58] him to the point
[1:09:00] that they took the report of the spies
[1:09:02] over the report of the god who gave the
[1:09:04] promise
[1:09:06] think about that and here they were
[1:09:09] ain't it something
[1:09:10] that 10 people in one night's time
[1:09:14] spread that negative report through
[1:09:16] almost 2
[1:09:18] million people had to be facebook
[1:09:24] two million people
[1:09:29] the bible said the whole congregate they
[1:09:32] lifted up their voice
[1:09:33] and cried to the lord
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:47] and every time they went to get a deep
[1:09:48] breath to let out another cry
[1:09:51] they heard
[1:10:01] what in the world is that we're trying
[1:10:03] to cry we're trying to be in distress
[1:10:05] we're trying to be nervous we're trying
[1:10:07] to what in the world is that and they
[1:10:09] peeped over into the next ten you know
[1:10:11] who it was
[1:10:12] it was caleb he was just having him a
[1:10:14] good night's sleep because the bible
[1:10:16] said
[1:10:17] when thou liest down be not afraid
[1:10:20] do not be afraid and your sleep
[1:10:23] shall be sweet
[1:10:26] they were wailing and crying and caleb
[1:10:29] got him a good eight hour sleep
[1:10:33] oh amen there was no sleep in the camp
[1:10:38] because the report caused them to lose
[1:10:40] confidence
[1:10:41] in the god who gave the promise
[1:10:47] but that don't take away from the real
[1:10:48] thing that'll take away from the word i
[1:10:50] don't care if everybody quits and walks
[1:10:51] away i don't care if this preacher quits
[1:10:53] and walks away
[1:10:54] i don't care what i shall not be moved
[1:10:57] like a tree
[1:10:58] planted by the water i shall not be
[1:11:01] moved it does not change the promise
[1:11:03] plagues pandemics
[1:11:05] riots it does not change the promise of
[1:11:08] god's word
[1:11:09] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:18] what made caleb so sure of it when the
[1:11:21] opposition was so great
[1:11:24] it's according to what you're looking at
[1:11:28] caleb was looking at the promise of god
[1:11:30] his confidence
[1:11:32] was in god the other 10 was looking at
[1:11:35] the circumstances
[1:11:36] you see if you look at the circumstances
[1:11:38] or you look at what's around you
[1:11:40] you will surely fail you must never
[1:11:44] look at what's around you you must never
[1:11:46] look with the eyes of your head
[1:11:48] we must look with the eyes of our heart
[1:11:56] eve made her mistake when satan come
[1:12:00] along with this theology
[1:12:01] his theology and she mixed it and gave
[1:12:03] it to adam
[1:12:04] and it caused the hybrid faith and the
[1:12:07] prophet said that's what the church
[1:12:09] has got today the so-called church has a
[1:12:12] hybrid
[1:12:13] faith you believe oh i believe
[1:12:16] believe god heals i believe
[1:12:20] but you see when faith the prophet said
[1:12:24] is mixed with fear doubts
[1:12:27] frustrations then it becomes a hybrid
[1:12:32] faith well i believe but
[1:12:36] i'm scared to death brother they say
[1:12:39] this cancer is the worst one they've
[1:12:40] ever seen
[1:12:41] that's a hybrid faith well yeah
[1:12:44] god heals cancer but i don't know if he
[1:12:46] can heal me or not
[1:12:47] that's a hybrid faith i believe god
[1:12:50] delivers
[1:12:50] but i can't just get over this habit
[1:12:53] that's a hybrid
[1:12:54] faith you're mixing your faith with fear
[1:12:57] and doubt
[1:12:57] and frustration and you're sure to fail
[1:13:00] but
[1:13:01] genuine faith does not move
[1:13:06] god says anything it'll be that way i
[1:13:09] don't care what happens
[1:13:10] i don't care how bad it looks if god
[1:13:12] said there'll be a bride
[1:13:14] and god said there'll be a rapture they
[1:13:16] will be a bride
[1:13:17] and they will be a rapture
[1:13:21] but satan he turned it together and
[1:13:24] mixed it up
[1:13:25] and gave it to eve and what did it
[1:13:27] produce
[1:13:30] death
[1:13:32] you see satan wants you to see the
[1:13:34] problem
[1:13:35] but not the answer he wants you to see
[1:13:38] the symptom
[1:13:40] but not the healing the chaos
[1:13:44] but not the calm he wants you to see the
[1:13:46] storm
[1:13:48] but not the rainbow he wants you to see
[1:13:50] the darkness
[1:13:52] but not the light it's a nervous age the
[1:13:55] prophet said what is it
[1:13:56] the church is in a neurotic state every
[1:13:59] church is proselyting and pulling and
[1:14:00] fussing and stewing
[1:14:02] it's a neurotic age the world is in
[1:14:04] chaos
[1:14:06] but the prophet said the world is in
[1:14:08] chaos but i
[1:14:09] say stand still
[1:14:12] that's the message god is calling his
[1:14:15] church to a halt
[1:14:16] stand still don't be jumping and running
[1:14:19] not knowing what you're doing
[1:14:20] not knowing where you're going come back
[1:14:22] to the word
[1:14:23] come back to christ come back to the
[1:14:26] promise amen
[1:14:27] and stand upon the word for faith must
[1:14:30] have something to anchor on
[1:14:32] let it anchor it will not anchor all
[1:14:34] sensation it will not anchor on emotion
[1:14:36] but the word of god faith in the word of
[1:14:39] god that's the faith's anchor point
[1:14:41] is the word of god be confident
[1:14:45] in the one who gave the promise
[1:14:48] brother baby said i give a solemn
[1:14:50] warning to the church stand still
[1:14:52] god always commands to stand still
[1:14:55] before he
[1:14:57] does anything
[1:15:00] well brother i don't think it's going to
[1:15:01] be this way i guess this message is
[1:15:03] wrong it don't change the message honey
[1:15:06] come on it'll be exactly the way god
[1:15:09] said it would be
[1:15:10] i don't care how it looks well so and so
[1:15:12] left the message
[1:15:13] they went out from us because they were
[1:15:15] not a part of us
[1:15:17] amen preached thank you believe a will
[1:15:19] come on
[1:15:20] stand still and see the promises of god
[1:15:23] you see god
[1:15:24] doesn't make a promise that he can't
[1:15:26] keep
[1:15:27] the prophet said god will bankrupt
[1:15:30] heaven before he will let one promise
[1:15:34] he made fail
[1:15:38] we have a word from the lord he told us
[1:15:42] these things would come he told us
[1:15:45] these times would come did he not
[1:15:48] but he said when these things begin to
[1:15:51] come to pass
[1:15:52] he didn't say quit church have less
[1:15:54] church
[1:15:56] he said when these things come to pass
[1:15:58] then lift
[1:15:59] up your head your redemption draweth now
[1:16:03] assemble yourselves together even more
[1:16:06] so not less
[1:16:08] as you see the day approaching
[1:16:14] let's do what he said amen
[1:16:18] he told us what to look for he said when
[1:16:20] we see these things come to pass
[1:16:23] that's my message to the church the
[1:16:24] prophet said stand still
[1:16:26] and look to his promise that's my
[1:16:29] message to you church
[1:16:30] stand still and look to this
[1:16:33] listen think about this a minute we
[1:16:36] serve a god
[1:16:38] who turns water to wine
[1:16:44] that's pretty good well brother daryl he
[1:16:47] only did that one time
[1:16:49] well how many times do you have to do it
[1:16:50] before you believe it
[1:16:56] he showed us he could and the guy
[1:17:00] at the wedding whatever they call the
[1:17:02] guy he got up and said hey
[1:17:04] everybody be still i got something i
[1:17:06] want to say
[1:17:07] usually you go to weddings they serve
[1:17:09] the good wine first and then when
[1:17:11] everybody gets drunk they bring out the
[1:17:12] cheap one
[1:17:13] but this man here he has saved the best
[1:17:16] wine for last
[1:17:17] i have never tasted wine like this
[1:17:21] i'll tell you why because they never
[1:17:22] been wine made like that
[1:17:27] oh we served a god who turned
[1:17:31] just thinking oh my that just makes my
[1:17:33] heart swell
[1:17:34] i'm talking about my daddy
[1:17:38] he turned water into wine rain
[1:17:42] into sunshine fear into peace
[1:17:45] death into life sickness into health
[1:17:49] darkness into light sorrow into joy
[1:17:52] sinners in the saints
[1:17:56] that's my god then when we lay down at
[1:18:00] night
[1:18:01] to sleep our sleep can be
[1:18:04] sweet because our confidence
[1:18:07] is not an appeal it's not in a pillow
[1:18:10] it's not in that soft music that you
[1:18:12] turn on beside the bed
[1:18:16] but our sleep can be sweet because our
[1:18:18] confidence
[1:18:19] is in the god who promised to keep us
[1:18:26] he has given us his word and that word
[1:18:30] will not fail because god can't fail
[1:18:34] and god is his word i saw a video the
[1:18:37] other day
[1:18:38] and then i saw another news article just
[1:18:40] the other day of a church up in west
[1:18:41] virginia
[1:18:42] that burnt to the ground it was so hot
[1:18:45] the firemen couldn't even get near it to
[1:18:47] put it out they had to pull back and let
[1:18:49] it burn
[1:18:50] and when the church burnt to the ground
[1:18:52] and it cooled down they went in
[1:18:54] everything in the church was destroyed
[1:18:56] but the bible's
[1:19:02] i saw a video of a man he went off the
[1:19:04] road hit a telephone pole his car
[1:19:06] bursted into flames and burned to the
[1:19:08] point the tires blew out
[1:19:11] and when they finally got the car out on
[1:19:13] the dash of the car
[1:19:15] was the bible and the man picked it up
[1:19:17] it was just singed on the outside
[1:19:18] and he opened it up and that was the
[1:19:20] pages
[1:19:25] feeling religious right now that word
[1:19:28] that word can
[1:19:29] not fail he give us the confidence in
[1:19:32] his word amen
[1:19:33] and that word cannot fail
[1:19:36] when you go through the water it shall
[1:19:38] overtake thee i believe the bible said
[1:19:39] when you pass through the fire it shall
[1:19:41] the smoke won't even come upon you
[1:19:43] what is he saying why because that word
[1:19:46] that word that can withstand a car car
[1:19:48] fire that word that can withstand the
[1:19:50] church fire
[1:19:51] that word is in me
[1:19:57] he gives us this confidence in his word
[1:20:00] peace
[1:20:01] peace i leave with you my peace give
[1:20:04] unto you
[1:20:06] my peace give i unto you not as the
[1:20:09] world giveth give i unto you
[1:20:10] let not your hearts be troubled neither
[1:20:12] let it be afraid
[1:20:14] isaiah 41 13 for i the lord thy
[1:20:17] god will hold thy right hand
[1:20:20] saying unto thee fear not for i will
[1:20:23] help thee
[1:20:24] thank you i will help thee you remember
[1:20:28] talking about billy paul he wanted some
[1:20:30] water and he said son i'm so tired just
[1:20:32] get up and go get you some water and he
[1:20:33] said the angel said go with your son and
[1:20:36] he said i got up out of bed and went
[1:20:37] over to where billy paul was and took
[1:20:39] him by the hand
[1:20:39] said we had took a few steps but he
[1:20:41] stepped on that rug going into the
[1:20:42] kitchen
[1:20:43] and his feet slid up from under him and
[1:20:46] he said if i hadn't been there he would
[1:20:47] have failed but the angel of the lord
[1:20:49] told me to go to my son
[1:20:50] and he was holding the little boy in his
[1:20:52] right hand oh hallelujah i'm so glad
[1:20:55] i'm so glad that daddy has got a hold of
[1:20:58] my right hand
[1:20:59] and he said i will be your help
[1:21:03] in a slippery time in a slippery slopely
[1:21:06] time
[1:21:06] don't worry son i've got a hold of you
[1:21:12] running
[1:21:15] without passes through the water i will
[1:21:17] be with thee and through the rivers i
[1:21:19] shall not overflow thee and when thou
[1:21:20] walk us through the fire
[1:21:22] thou shall not be burned
[1:21:25] neither shall the flames kindle upon
[1:21:26] thee isaiah 41 10 fear
[1:21:29] thou not for i am with thee be not
[1:21:32] dismayed
[1:21:33] for i am thy god i will strengthen thee
[1:21:36] yea i will help thee yea i will uphold
[1:21:39] thee
[1:21:40] with the right hand of my righteousness

[1:25:42] well brother now what do you reckon is
[1:25:43] going to happen i don't know
[1:25:45] i don't know what tomorrow holds i don't
[1:25:47] know about the election
[1:25:50] i'm not worried about the election
[1:25:53] i just know who holds tomorrow
[1:26:01] when i was looking at these scriptures
[1:26:03] what's more that come to my mind about
[1:26:05] jesus on the boat
[1:26:07] think about this for a minute i got to
[1:26:09] thinking about it again and i was
[1:26:10] jotting these notes down
[1:26:11] about the great storm you know jesus i
[1:26:13] think i preached it the last time i was
[1:26:15] here
[1:26:15] he's in the ship and he come down there
[1:26:19] just think about this
[1:26:20] he knew the storm was coming
[1:26:23] he knew it would be a category five
[1:26:27] whatever a great storm we say category
[1:26:29] five just to try to understand it
[1:26:31] a major storm a major hurricane
[1:26:34] he knew the sails would be tore he knew
[1:26:37] the boat would fill with water
[1:26:39] he knew the oars would break he knew
[1:26:41] peter
[1:26:42] would not be able to handle the storm he
[1:26:44] knew the disciples will be frantic and
[1:26:46] running around
[1:26:49] he knew every bit of that and the bible
[1:26:52] says he found a place on the boat
[1:27:00] to go to sleep
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:08] i wonder how many of you if the spring
[1:27:10] river was to come out of its banks this
[1:27:12] afternoon and a major flood comes
[1:27:14] striking through this
[1:27:15] how many of you would go home and take a
[1:27:17] nap
[1:27:23] come on think about it
[1:27:26] he laid down oh but brother daryl he was
[1:27:29] the word
[1:27:30] well who are you
[1:27:35] that was god in flesh well if you've got
[1:27:37] the holy ghost who are you
[1:27:41] don't live beneath your privileged
[1:27:42] friends it's time we realize who we are
[1:27:45] it's time we recognize not just who's
[1:27:47] with us
[1:27:48] but who's in us
[1:27:52] he lays down and he goes to sleep
[1:27:54] because he knew
[1:27:55] the word of god will not fail when thou
[1:27:58] liest down to sleep
[1:28:00] be not afraid
[1:28:03] and your sleep shall be sweet
[1:28:08] for the lord shall be thy confidence and
[1:28:11] shall keep
[1:28:12] thy foot from being taken
[1:28:16] there's a lot of people being washed
[1:28:17] away right now a lot of people have been
[1:28:19] caught up in this madness right now
[1:28:21] a lot of people walking away from the
[1:28:22] message people we never thought would
[1:28:24] have ever left come on somebody
[1:28:27] but just remember he promised you thy
[1:28:30] foot
[1:28:31] shall not be taken
[1:28:35] you will not lose your foothold because
[1:28:38] we're not standing on sink and saying
[1:28:41] hallelujah we're standing we're feasting
[1:28:44] we're eating upon the unfailing word
[1:28:47] body
[1:28:47] of the son of man and you are what you

[1:29:09] the lord shall be thy confidence
[1:29:12] though a host and camp against me my
[1:29:15] heart
[1:29:15] shall not fear the war shall rise
[1:29:18] against me
[1:29:19] in this will i be confident one thing
[1:29:22] have i desired of the lord
[1:29:23] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[1:29:26] in the house
[1:29:27] of the lord all the days of my life to
[1:29:30] behold the beauty of the lord
[1:29:31] and to inquire of his temple
[1:29:35] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:29:39] me
[1:29:40] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:29:43] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:29:46] hide me
[1:29:46] he shall set me upon a rock
[1:29:52] being confident of this very
[1:29:55] thing that he which begun a good work in
[1:29:59] you
[1:30:00] will perform it until the day
[1:30:03] of jesus christ he never brought us this
[1:30:07] far to leave us
[1:30:08] he never built a home in us to move away
[1:30:11] he never lifted us up to let us down
[1:30:14] he never taught us to swim to let us
[1:30:18] drowned
[1:30:24] he has started this work in me
[1:30:28] nothing will stop him from finishing
[1:30:32] his masterpiece because you see my
[1:30:35] brother my sister
[1:30:36] god don't make no junk
[1:30:40] all right come on like ruth resting i'm
[1:30:44] closing
[1:30:45] like roof resting we're waiting on our
[1:30:47] lord
[1:30:48] he finished the work in calvary when he
[1:30:51] said
[1:30:52] it is finished now we can have
[1:30:55] confidence
[1:30:56] that the work has been done our
[1:30:58] redemption
[1:30:59] has been secured but like ruth we're
[1:31:03] resting we're resting we're waiting
[1:31:05] on our lord we're waiting on our lord
[1:31:09] before he comes to take us home what did
[1:31:11] he do
[1:31:12] he went to prepare a place for us
[1:31:16] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:31:19] i will come again
[1:31:21] and receive you unto myself that where i
[1:31:23] am
[1:31:27] shall you be also
[1:31:32] let not your hearts be troubled if you
[1:31:34] believe in god believe also in me
[1:31:36] in my father's house or many mansions if
[1:31:38] it wasn't so i would have told you
[1:31:39] but i'll go and prepare a place for you
[1:31:44] where i am how should you be also
[1:31:48] listen just just let me look at this and
[1:31:49] we'll close there's no peace
[1:31:52] to a troubled heart
[1:31:55] there's no peace to a sinful heart
[1:31:58] there cannot be peace if a man longs to
[1:32:02] drink
[1:32:03] he calls that life he thinks he's having
[1:32:06] a big time
[1:32:07] but it actually shows he's empty
[1:32:13] he's empty like the women that was
[1:32:16] coming down there in canada coming down
[1:32:18] the hotel room brother madam said they
[1:32:19] was in there underneath garments and
[1:32:21] they were drinking and one of them
[1:32:22] kicked up their leg and said whoopee
[1:32:24] this is life and he said i stepped out
[1:32:26] and said no
[1:32:27] that's death
[1:32:31] they work to get a million it doesn't
[1:32:34] satisfy
[1:32:35] they try to get two million they might
[1:32:40] have a million dollars in his hand dead
[1:32:44] million in his hand and he lays down at
[1:32:46] night
[1:32:47] with a drunken stew on him and he wakes
[1:32:49] up the next morning
[1:32:50] haunted with nightmares and a troubled
[1:32:52] mind
[1:32:54] and you call that peace because they
[1:32:57] think their peace comes
[1:32:58] from wealth and fame and a nice home if
[1:33:01] you've got a nice home thank god for it
[1:33:02] you got a nice car thank god for it but
[1:33:04] my peace
[1:33:05] my security does not come from my house
[1:33:08] nor my car people strive so hard
[1:33:12] they work so hard to have that people
[1:33:15] women will defile their bodies and
[1:33:16] everything else to get a position
[1:33:18] in hollywood to be in movies trying to
[1:33:21] be rich
[1:33:21] trying to be famous come on somebody you
[1:33:23] know it's the truth trying to be rich
[1:33:25] trying to be famous
[1:33:26] they think that brings peace they think
[1:33:29] that brings security
[1:33:30] if it does why do they hang their self
[1:33:32] in hotel rooms
[1:33:37] because it doesn't bring anything but
[1:33:39] emptiness
[1:33:44] amen you don't have to worry about
[1:33:46] losing a million dollars in the stock
[1:33:47] market if you ain't got a million
[1:33:48] dollars in it
[1:33:53] i don't have to check the stock market
[1:33:55] come
[1:34:03] they on it peace that's not peace
[1:34:07] it isn't empty but a man
[1:34:11] may not even have a pillar to press his
[1:34:12] head to he may not even own a decent
[1:34:15] pair of shoes
[1:34:16] or be able to have a decent meal in this
[1:34:18] house
[1:34:19] but if god raised in his heart he goes
[1:34:21] to bed happy and wakes up happy
[1:34:24] it's a lasting peace it's something that
[1:34:27] god
[1:34:28] does because our confidence
[1:34:31] is in the lord
[1:34:35] think about it the bible said jesus
[1:34:37] didn't have a place to lay his head
[1:34:40] all right the foxes have burrows the
[1:34:42] birds have nests
[1:34:43] but i the son of man have no place
[1:34:47] to lay my head and yet he was had such
[1:34:50] peace confidence in knowing he was the
