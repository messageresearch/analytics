home and i trust the lord will be a blessing to you today the word will be a blessing to you sister tracy good to have you back with us today god bless you all way back from the philippines and i'm brother paul is recovering from missing you i'm sure so so he had a hard time there without you you got to have somebody take care of you don't you that's man we don't we don't do well by ourselves especially if we've been married for a while so we appreciate you guys being back and each and every one of you today and i just pray the lord will just really bless you today i'm going to take both services our three o'clock service as well today and just kind of dwell on this same subject so i won't complete it this morning but i want to talk about two different aspects of it and i want to talk to you about god's great symphony this morning and deal with the composer matthew chapter 6 verse 24 matthew chapter 6 verse 24. we'll read all the way down to verse 34. just a minute to turn matthew 6 24 says no man can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon therefore now in your bible that may be separated but the 24th verse goes with the 25th verse because he says therefore you can't serve two masters you can't serve god and anxiety yes you can't serve god and worry yeah right one or the other if you believe in a providential all-knowing caring god yeah yes yes and i've got to remind myself of this sometimes yes then you just can't spend your life worrying about things yes you can't serve one in the other therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat and if you go back in the in the original let's take no anxious thought so it's not that you never think about it but you don't worry about it take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body then raiment behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature in other words if you put all of your effort and your worry and everything in it you could never be any taller than you are yeah all right brother david never be any taller than you are just by taking thought all right so why worry about it yeah sure right and and so he says you can't add one cubit to your stature by thought why take your thought for raiment why worry about what you're going to wear consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god that's why you're here this morning isn't it to seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's bow our heads together maybe you have a special unspoken request today you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand god sees each and every one of those hands this morning heavenly father we approach your throne today and thank you for your grace that you poured out on us we thank you lord because we could not do it on our own lord we could not add one one foot to our stature lord one inch lord but you have brought us the way that you brought us and and you've given us food and clothing and the natural things and the spiritual things as well we're so thankful for that today i pray that you to help us lord i know these needs that are represented are real needs that or the by evidence of the raised hand lord i pray that you would meet every need lord that you you are the only one that can do that and i i pray that you would today i know it's your desire to do that and you're waiting lord to be called on and i pray lord that we would call on you now to meet each and every one of these needs lord and we and we know that you will i pray you'd bless these people move me out of the way speak directly to every situation that needs to be spoken to today we pray in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated life as we know it is either controlled by a supernatural god or it's completely random yeah one of two things one of those two things is true you can't have both it either is god or it is random and it either either god cares or he doesn't care either he uh either he is god and deserves to be worshipped as such and and his word deserves to be followed as such or or there is no god and people can do whatever they want to do i will say this you don't want to you don't want to see the ramifications of that thought if you begin to think there is no god and you begin to dwell on that and realize then there's no purpose and if there's no purpose then there's nothing that nothing good and nothing bad and there's no wrong and there's no right and eventually you reach a place where you can go like the young man that the other day and went into the supermarket and shot 10 people but what was the point you know there's no point in existence you might as well just just take what's yours and and fight in that way but we don't fight natural battles like that because we believe in a god we believe that god takes care of us we believe that the complexity of life itself proves that there is a god just the fact that your dna there's something coated inside of you that actually is information information has to come from intelligence it doesn't come from randomness right you can take your watch and take it off if you have an old-fashioned watch that's got parts in it you can take it off in pieces and put it in a bag and shake it for a million years it would never tell time again why because it took intelligence to put the pieces together in order for it to work like your body works like the world works it takes a god to be able to do that and so if there's god like that if there is a god like that and we believe that there is then that god must care for you he must have things in his control and so the bible tells us this that not only not only are the big things controlled by god because that's where sometimes people leave it they're kind of agnostic in that way they think well there's a god but he doesn't really care about the minute details of my life but if you begin to look at it and realize that god if he is god if he is all-knowing if he is everywhere if he does know everything and and have everything in his in his grasp then every detail of life is controlled by his action or inaction because of who he is and so luke 12 and 6 tells us this are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god just think of that the magnitude of that thought there are billions of birds on the earth today billions of them and billions upon billions and perhaps trillions of birds have been have been on the earth in the last 6 000 years think about it all of those birds have been counted yes and their entire life has been seen by god yes right right not one of them is forgotten that's right he knows every bird and if you had time he could tell you the details of its birth and how it flew and what was what happened to it he knew it he knew when it was born everything about it and all the way to the end you say the birds that's what the bible says he has not forgotten one of them right every little sparrow that you see out here he knows every every life every every form of life that there is he knows everything about it not one of them has forgotten before god he said but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered right remember jt for some of us that's easier than for others but even the ones that we've lost yes where are they at there have to be somewhere he knows where they are yeah right he knows where they are he he counts them he knows how many you have on your head right now how many you had five years ago 20 years ago he he counts the hairs of your head yes and it doesn't bother him a bit amen right you think about it you try to make a calculation you know somebody who's very good at math can make a calculation and they can go into that and i look at my kids math sometimes they bring home from school and i can't hardly handle that you know i i look at it i never did go that far in math and they're doing algebra and esther is finished uh six in her class in in algebra i think it was out of a hundred and something students and i look at that i couldn't do what she did three years ago i can't i can't do it and i begin to look at that and and think well but but to her it makes sense and she can keep track of it but think how much more if you look at what we know compared to what god knows our knowledge is limited but a person who's good at that they can just rattle it off they know they have a knowledge they have a gift to be able to do that and so god has the knowledge he has all knowledge he knows things that we can't even comprehend we don't think like he does and so we just have to trust him so we know then that according to the scriptures we are not in control of our lives we're simply acting on our part so brother branham likened that to a great symphony orchestra or an orchestra that was playing a symphony like particular in particular peter and the wolf if you've ever seen that as the children's symphony peter and the wolf and it's amazing that how it's acted out by the instruments and by the music so that there's no words but yet when you're listening to it and you and you know it you know what's going to happen next because you can feel it through the music itself and life is like that that we're all acting out apart and god is the composer of life he's the composer of this great symphony so brother branham says it this way talking about in a new year's sermon he said the new year i don't know what it holds but i know he holds it can we say amen to that today he said that's the hopes of new year i have if he comes amen if he doesn't come i'll still be working if he spares me i just trust the future to him i don't know what it is he said i just trusted to him he said you've seen him vindicate his word so you know it's going to be done his work yeah you say brother branham how do you get that well let me give some thought here just a minute do you know what a symphony is it's a music it's a drama acted out and he gives the example of peter in the wok he said now do you adults the scripture is god's symphony only the composer knows what it really means yes right the composer knows yes i'm not born with the knowledge or with the brain power to know what it really means but the composer knows he wrote the music yes and he knows why he wrote it and why the chord progressions are the way that they are and why why it's in the key that it's him he knows why he did what he did yeah right and so we don't understand that but he'll reveal that to us only the composer knows what it really means he reveals it to those who are listening now watch that's the key who are interested in knowing what the drama is yes so if you're interested in that today if you want to know what god wants known by his word you wouldn't necessarily go to a scholar somewhere but you go to the composer himself and you'd find out how do you want me to interpret the word right how do you want it played how do you want it live because the word is more than just a something that we read and something that it's a good thought that we have but when we read about he said take no thought for tomorrow we say lord how do you want that lived out right you want that lived out in in my life how do you want it lived out well you wouldn't go to me necessarily or to another person to find out you would go to the composer yeah right and find out how he wants it played now and and so he writes the music in the book or on the sheet music but now he's got a certain idea of how he wants it played he said but you'd have to know about a symphony first he said it's not just something you see it's the changing the junctions of the word of the music and you know that symphonies are written in different parks right there'll be a a part and then the music will sew down maybe it'll stop and then it'll go into another part and today in popular music today we have verses and of course but it's it's leading to something and and it's telling a story as you go through it that song that brother joel saying earlier it was telling a story about the resurrection of the dead dead girl if you think about that as telling that and so the song is getting to the plot to the part where it says i was like that little girl and and so it's applying it then so there's a historical verse and then an application verse and and so it's doing something but it's a change there's a difference in in the historical verse in the application verse and then the course to bring it all together now he said it's not just something you see it's the changing the junctions of the music he said it throws sometimes it's going this way for a while a certain beat after a while it changes all around what is it you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it or not interested in it it's just a racket it's a fuss right and that's what the preaching of the word now the preaching of the word and i know it's hard sometimes to understand why we preach and what we preach and and try to follow a preacher who's speaking fast and spinning all over the place it's hard to understand but the bible tells us that the preaching of the cross would be foolishness to the world right and a stumbling block to the jews but he said but through the foolishness of preaching god chose to save those who would believe not through foolish preaching but through the foolishness of preaching the very act of preaching itself but you who are interested if you're interested in knowing what god says then you would you would hear a preacher not everything the preacher says is correct but when that preacher lines up with the word then you know that god is interpreting his word to you yes sir right now now watch now he said it's a fuss to some people it don't make any sense but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming so we have these times of symphonies the symphony of god's word that the whole drama changes he said you who are interested listen for that change oh my you know it's getting close he said you hear the way the drums are beating he said you want something to happen no this is a change right the drums are beating and remember god's not just in control of you and me but he's in control of the whole world he allows everything to happen the way that it does and so the entire thing whenever you walk out in nature when you go out among the people and you see the way the people are and the bible tells you what the people would be like in the last days you can look at it and see that the symphony was meant to be a certain way and when you look around you you can see what time do we live in well the drums are beating a certain way and you can feel it moving up towards an end point moving up to a crescendo and you're finally getting up to that place and finally you get to a place where you realize hey hey there's a there's going to be a change here you anticipate it because one key or one chord and one one note leads to another yeah right and we'll talk maybe a little bit about that tonight but but you realize in music that one note calls for another note and that's why it sounds wrong when you play the wrong one right how does it sound wrong because there's something in your brain that a creator put there to appreciate music and so when if a piano player was playing and they would hit a wrong note or play a chord that doesn't go after another chord you hear it hurt it it'd make you cringe why most people anyway why would it do that it would do that because there's something in your brain that's wired to expect something to happen oh god if we can just realize that the word is that way as well that there's when we when we see god interpreting his word by bringing it to pass right and we see that some things have happened the prophet has come and the people are a certain way and the world is a certain way and the churches are a certain way and we look all around us and see we're living in the days of sodom and we see jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so we look at that we begin to realize there's something going to change right there's a change coming well what change are we looking for now we're looking for the rapture of the church right we're looking for a body change because that's the change you see the drum beat the crescendo it's building up to that and even people in the world can see it where it's it's a it's a crazy hour the world's gone nuts why why do people live like they do why is there so much people that don't care why is there so much of sin on the earth today well the bible tells us it'll increase and increase until the end but when the end when the end is about to come you feel the pulsation of it the beat of it and you look into the word you can see something's going to happen yes oh my i believe we're living in those times he said you hear the way the drums are beating want something to happen you know this is a change it's going to break out in a burst in a few minutes and you're watching for it you can tell the way the drums are timing he said if you can hear the drums of the finish now if you can hear the echo oh how many of you can hear the drums of the finish this morning you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word seeing itself out and it shall come to pass in the last days the symphony of god's great drama that he's playing now notice he says it changes him because he's the main actor yes sir i think about it well again we'll talk more about that tonight but he changes from glory to glory christ was god with a different mask on if we could put it like that right it was god robed in flesh he did appear as a pillar of fire he did appear as jehovah god in the old testament now but now christ is god with a mask on he's a great actor in the symphony he's acting out in the drama or in the play according in the music he's playing and the people are doing what they're doing but he come right at the time that he was supposed to come when the world was falling apart in that time he came and he'll come this time the second time in the time when he was supposed to come yes amen so now he says he knows all about it and and he says that the symphony of god's great drama that he's playing it changes him his symphony at the junction the composer and those who are interested listen for the change he said that's what all this stuff is to us we're listening we're watching every time he appears something happens we see the time getting close he said remember the composer knows the end from the beginning right yeah we don't because we haven't heard the song before right we've got the music the sheet music yeah but we've never heard it i hope you're listening to me now he said you begin to listen to the music and you know what it is you know just about here's where certain certain things are taking place now it's got to change now anybody else that don't know nothing about just walked in and sat down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music drummed out with the notes it's trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung on the harp it's played with the violin it's beat on the bass it's sounded by the trumpets the speed on the drums the whole thing's together in rhythm and it makes the drama to you can close your eyes and live in it all right now who is the composer the composer is the creator of the music let's go to isaiah chapter 40. if you have your bibles isaiah chapter 40 and verse 12 the composer is the creator of the music he says i love this chapter and i couldn't just read a couple of verses i i think we need to comprehend what the prophet is saying here the prophet isaiah he says who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span measured the universe and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure as if god was assigned scientists in a lab right right and he's got the waters in his hand and he's got the dust in a in a measuring jar a measuring cup and he's weighed the mountains on scales about the alps with the rocky mountains some great mountain range god's got him on his scales and the heels in a balance who has directed the spirit of the lord you ever told god what to do you won't you may try but god laughs when we tell him our plans can't tell god what to do so god you and i've seen that sometimes in pentecostal realms and then and we're a little pentecostal ourselves i guess but i've seen it where people demand god you've god you must do this god we demand that you do this you don't demand god you come and remind god of his word god you said right you said you would do it yeah you said you would do it and so and so but we want to demand god he said who has directed the spirit of the lord you didn't tell him what to do huh you don't even you can't even know what tomorrow holds you don't know what even what to the rest of the day holds but he knows or being his counselor has taught him in other words who who sit there now god you don't know everything so i'm going to tell you now isn't that ridiculous on our part wouldn't that be ridiculous to sit there and say god you don't know everything so i'm going to tell you i'm going to just pull it out of my own mind that's not what we do with god we trust him he said with whom took he counsel who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding he said behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket yeah and are counted as the small dust of the balance in other words what's left over after you've weighed something the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing the continents lebanon is not sufficient to burn he said you're going to make a sacrifice to god that god will be pleased with and you're just going to make it up lebanon is not sufficient to burn the famous cedars of lebanon was a great forested country there lebanon is not sufficient to burn or the beast thereof sufficient for a burnt offering you don't get to make those things up you do what he asks yes right all nations before him or is nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity to whom then were you liking god or what likeness were you comparing to him so you're going to you're going to make god something no god reveals himself yes oh my what were you liking god too he said the melted this was back in the days of idolatry when they would have an image then they said that's god the workmen melted the graven image and the goldsmith spreaded it over with gold and catched a silver chains it says he that is so impoverished that he has no oblation in other words he don't even have money for an offering but yet being poor and when you see this in poor countries many times they're overtaken by churches and religions that make them perform all of these things and give all their money to the church or to the religion and it's very sad either so impoverished yet no ablation chooses a tree that will not rot he seeks unto him a cunning workman he spends all his money and his time to find somebody to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved he wants something solid he tries to set it up in his house he said have you not known have you not heard has it not been told you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth now watch they didn't know scientists in that day in fact for several thousand years they didn't know the earth was round yeah but isaiah said he sat on the circle of the earth oh my and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in he said have you not heard of him you want to set up an idol try to make him into the image of what you want him to be and that's what so many people do today is try to take this great composer and say now i want you to play the music this way i want you to i want you to apply it this way i want you to interpret it this way we don't get to do that he's the composer he's the creator right and so we don't get to tell him what to do and how to do it right god is sovereign right what that means is no one tells him what to do right we don't get to tell him what to do but he has every right to tell us what to do everybody said well i'm a sovereign citizen that may be true in a nation but it's not true when it comes to god you got you have to work with god yeah yes sure you don't get to work live life apart from him if you think you do it's just that much more sad in the end because every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that he is god he is lord now watch he sits on the circle of the earth and he have inhabitants there's grasshoppers and he stretches the heavens as a curtain and spreads him out as a tent to dwell in he brings the princess to nothing he makes the judges of the earth as vanity he got control over the presidents and the and the hierarchies and the bishops and all the things of the earth right yea they shall not be planted yes they shall not be stone sown yet their stock shall not take root in the earth he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither the whirlwind shall take them away a stubble imagine the king of that day would stand up and say i'm going to have a king i'm going to be a king like saul as we've been studying saul on wednesday night that that he would stand up there and say i'm going to have a line of people that's and my kids are going to rule israel forever my kids are going to rule this nation i'm going to have a dynasty god rules events can take place so that every one of them you may not need you're not promised you may not have any children the ones that you have may be taken away you don't know god controls those things he says now to whom were you lacking me or or shall i be equal saith the holy one i love the way he says that shall he didn't say shall i be equal to what shall i be equal to anything lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things yes look up from your drudgery look up from the everyday life that you go through i know life is hard i know you go through things i know you suffer at your work many times you suffer in your bodies you suffer with persecution and people that don't understand why you do the way that you do and live the way that you live why you would go to church people don't understand i know people suffer with that but yet at the same time look above that today lift your eyes above the suffering lift your eyes above the pain lift your eyes above what you're going through the tiredness of your body lift your eyes above that lift your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their hosts by number that he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth oh my not one faileth who invented the law of gravity and why is it only on the earth and not in the not in the heavens think about it who made earth hospitable for life i know i'm talking big picture today but i wish we would think big picture sometimes we'd get so caught up in the minute details of every little thing and get so angry over how things well this isn't right and this isn't right lift up your eyes [Music] think about the big picture for a minute we serve a great god behold who hath created these things that brings out their hosts by number calls them by names every star and there's billions upon billions of stars they've never found the end of the solar system or or the uh the uh universe they've never found an end to it system after system after system and yet they've also never found life on another place i don't say that there couldn't be life somewhere else but this is the only planet that they've ever founded on wine in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth lift up your eyes on high not one phaleth why say a sell jacob and speaker so israel now he's going to bring it down to the level of his children he said my way is hid from the lord why do you say that my judgment is passed over from my god has though not known has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding well i love this he gives power to the faint are you faint this morning do you feel weak the composer gives power to the faith he knows when to bring the right amount of instruction the right amount of encouragement into your life to make you to where you're able to make it one more day he gives power to the faint and to them that has no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait yes think about it they that way they that are patient they that serve god they that they that follow his instruction they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary that's a promise of god they shall walk and not faint yes right listen who who is he he's the creator yes who is this composer he's also the conductor yeah think about it for a moment he's a creator he also conducts the music many times in history great composers have also been great conductors bach and beethoven and the different the different uh great the great musicians and great composers of the days gone by they've also been great conductors today i think it's john williams that conducts his own orchestra different ones great musicians great composers conduct their own orchestra and if you ever watch one you go on youtube and watch a conductor who also composed the music there's something different about it he does it the way he wants it done he does it exactly in the way that it ought to be done now a conductor serves as a messenger for the composer it's their responsibility to understand the music and convey it through gesture that's why he's up there doing this i know i'm not doing that right but right he's got the baton so the single baton you know and he'll stand on a box or a little stool if he's not tall enough he'll get up there and just do like this well what's he doing he's conducting and he'll go sometimes he'll go real slow and at times he'll speed it up and at times he'll go real fast yeah right and what's he doing he's he's conducting not only the beat of the music but the mood and the feeling of the music are you still with me this morning just bear with me don't i if if you if you get tired get up and get a drink move around a little bit i'm not going to hold you that long we got tonight to finish it but i just want to get this part of this thought out now look it's it's the conductor's responsibility understanding me to convey it through gesture so transparently that the musicians in the orchestra understand it perfectly and then those musicians can transmit a unified vision of the music to the audience now notice he is the conductor what did god do when he needed a conductor who's he going to find because moses was a great prophet but he could not perfectly conduct god's people are you with me now isaiah was a great prophet jeremiah was a great prophet ezekiel was a great prophet but he could not perfectly conduct the music none of them were without sin right and sin is missing the mark it's getting off of the music right and so each one of them had made a mistake every one of them made mistakes so god came down it was his purpose that the music would be lived that it would be manifested in such a real way that it would be conducted in such a real way that he came down and and showed it to us played it for us yes all right come on sure he come down in a body of flesh and a woman called mary a virgin girl and he come down into that body the great truth of god coming down and condescending down into the body of a woman and he comes down on our level and he conducts the music from the earth every move that he made was perfect oh if we could say it like this the father looked down and said there are my son conducting it's god in flesh right but he separates god can separate himself without diminishing himself right yes sir because he's it's because he's not a limited number see if we separate ourselves there there'd be a diminished thing right right but god separates himself there's no diminishment because he's limitless to begin with right that's why he can make the fish and the loaves he separates the fish and there's just more fish yeah right he's god yeah and so he looks i said this is my beloved son right who plays the music perfectly right who conducts it perfectly yes and the disciples followed him because they recognize here is a conductor that can conduct the music in such a way that will make us able to live it make us put a reality in it that'll heal the sick that'll raise the dead a conductor that can bring us right exactly where we want him to be but jesus began to tell him he said he said i gotta go away it's expedient for you that i go away and he tells them this in john 14 18 he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you i will not leave you comfortless that word is dorphanos i'm not going to leave you without a conductor oh god he said i will come to you these things have i spoken unto you verse 25 being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your members now remember what he just said he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come yes and now he speaks as if it's another another person another event he said the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid the conductor is here so i don't know what i'm going to do tomorrow i'm frozen playing the violin i'm frozen at the drums i don't know what tomorrow holds but the conductor is here he said i'm not going to leave you without a conductor hallelujah and he said peace i'll leave with you i'm going to leave peace with you my peace i've given to you he said i'm not going to leave you without this peace i'm not going to leave you without my person being with you john chapter 16 and verse 7. he said nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but see listen remember the disciples could not play the music perfectly even though they had the perfect conductor but he said now i want to do something different oh god he said i'm going to do something different if i go not away the comforter will not come to you but if i depart i'll send him unto you when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment again in john 16 12 i've yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you he's going to be perfectly in tune with the composer all things that the father hath her mind therefore said i that he shall take a mind and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me because i go to the father now what is that what conductor what what happened the holy ghost fell amen said i'll not leave you comfortless i'm going to send the comforter i'm going to send the holy holy ghost brother bran i'm liking that to the mainspring in a famous watch and an old-fashioned watch that would that would that you'd have to wind up at a mainspring in it and the mainspring sits in the middle of the watch and controls every movement of the watch he said in the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit the wash spring makes all the rest of the movements just kick just exactly to place keeping perfect time so before pentecost the disciples could not even fulfill the command of jesus to go into all the world and preach the gospel in every nation they could not fulfill that command these signs shall follow them that believe they couldn't do it but at pentecost something happened there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the houses they were sitting and tons of fire separated a pillar of fire sat down on each one of them and when that pillar of fire that that god that holy ghost come down on the inside of them all of a sudden they could go by the gate beautiful and when the lame man was sitting there they said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give why they could play the music the way god wanted it to be played because of the holy ghost now again like into the watch it's the mainspring that does it it's the holy spirit that does it it isn't your church that does it it isn't your pastor that doesn't it isn't your shouting that doesn't it isn't your speaking with tongues it doesn't it isn't your healing service that doesn't it's the holy spirit that does it god's holy spirit in the middle of your new spirit it makes the whole church operate just exactly one big bundle of love oh what a wonderful way to describe a church amen i don't always feel like that well that's that's what we're striving for yeah it's the holy spirit that does it yes now what what are this conductor's responsibility see number one and the composer again is the conductor he come down he said i'll come to you he's also the conductor what are his responsibilities he chooses the time and the place he even chooses the venue the house that the music is going to be played in he wants it to represent who he is we've touched on it recently but galatians 1 15 paul said when it pleased god when it pleased god he separated me from my mother's womb but when it pleased him he called me by his grace right when it pleased god we don't have any say in when we're saved it's true right he said well i i sought god you did only because he sought you right if you had a desire to be in church this morning that didn't come from you come from god the composer and you ought to be thankful for that right because that that that's something that god puts in you not everybody has that desire to seek god and to be in the house of god but that's that's something he he's called you when it pleased god so that's his his responsibility to choose the time and the place listen you're a gene of your father you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you he was in there but you knew it not and he didn't know it but jesus manifested that he might have fellowship with you you being born again you're born of eternal life how many believe that today you're born again you're born of eternal life that's the holy spirit that dwells inside of you the only form of there's only one form of eternal life that's god's life zoe it's the greek word for it zoe only one form of eternal life he said then if you're a son of god or a daughter of god you were in god all the time right but he knew what bed and time you'd be planted see the difference in god in me is i didn't know i didn't have any control when i was a young man i had no control i didn't know when i'd get married i didn't know anything about it i finally come to find a wife that i loved and she loved me and she she was uh suitable for marriage and i was suitable i guess at the time for marriage and and so we got married and and we got married and had children but we really we tried to plan the best we could for our children and and playing our family and things but we didn't know those things we we had no control no real control you don't realize how little control you have to you stand in a delivery room and you can't make the baby live all right you realize that you can't make the baby live the baby has to live the baby has to grab that breath of life right you can't make that happen no control over that and so but you're a son or daughter of god but god knew what bed and time speaking of like a like a seed bed like a a garden bed right he knew what bed and time you'd be planted in right and so now he said you made a creature a son of god manifest the son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour so he knew what bed and he planned what bed and he knew what garden you would grow in and what what the time would be like and what the people would be like and what the earth would be like at that time and he made you for this time you say brother ben i can't do it i can't live as a christian the pressure's too hard it's too much no he made you for this time if you're a son or daughter of god that has his genes in other words his and his genes are his thoughts you understand his his uh his his seed is his thought that he expressed in you when he expressed his thought in you he thought of you and he said you're going to be in laodicea you're going to be at a certain time you're going to live in 2022. you're going to live and you're going to go to church at a certain place and you're going to come up in a certain area god knew that you would be here not only knew but planned for you to be here and when he planned for you to be here he was choosing the time and the place that the music would be played hey man listen to vindicate to meet the challenge of this hour you say but this part of the music is harder but he planned to have musicians listen to me that could play that part yes you choose certain musicians because you know it's not too hard they can do it oh and i'm here to tell you today if you're here sitting here in the house of god you can do it it's not too hard to be a christian it's not too hard to follow god because he chose you to be here he chooses the instruments and the musicians you know you're expressed after his word is coming you to light up this age you're to light up the age not darken it light it up you're the expressing god's life in you because you're a son or daughter of god you are now made you're sitting in this church today because your duty is to express god to this nation or this people this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you have to be if you ever if you've got eternal life it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here we know the bible teaches that he said i don't hardly understand how that we could think that a god that could prepare all these good things for us we could not put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come hallelujah eternal things and the bible tells us in john 14 2 and my father's house are many mansions if we're not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you for you listen for you individually he wasn't just saying that for as a general thing for a church for you individually he said therefore the bride and the rapture will come forth there was all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knew every man every place who would set all about it it's all free plan god knew it would be here and he made it that way so when we get there he's gone to prepare a place for us and when we get there we'll all be prepared just even like this night or this day is prepared like this hour is prepared and so the bible tells us in psalm 75 and i'm hurrying now to get to the end this morning of this part of this he said lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the east or from the west nor from the south but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another christians are not revolutionaries right we don't go out and join militia groups to try to bring down the nation not according to scripture romans 13 1 says let every soul be subject to the higher powers for there is no power but of god right what a way to look at the world yes the powers that be are ordained of god it doesn't mean they're godly by the way but they're ordained of god right god needed that power in that place at that time to produce this world that we live in so the music would be right you don't think he's got control of every moment of the symphony of every tone of every tune of every note how does he conduct he conducts by the written music which is the word of god psalms 119 105. that word is a lamp into my feet lighted to my past so the first thing he does is he puts the music on on the written form and he puts it down in front of you now you've got to trust that yes right if you don't trust that then you'll never be able to play the music you got to trust the written music the sheet music you put it down in front of you and and so if you find a person get up and say well now that was for the apostolic age so if there's something written in the music that we're supposed to do and they say well it was for the apostolic age that would make you pause wait a minute but you got a wrong conductor yeah right you're listening to the wrong conductor he said now right quick if you've received the holy spirit you've been endowed with that since it sets it off there's something wrong there they try to explain it away this for another day you really don't need those things today but jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe see there's a little something sets off in you a little buzzer knowing that that's wrong and that's the way of death the conductor gets off his little buzzer why you've got the sheep music right he said because jesus said if we add one word to this or take one word from it our part is taken out of the book of life see not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and god watches over his word all of this god watches over his word to perform it the same way that the conductor would watch over the the orchestra to perform the music god watches over his word to perform and we know that it's got to be just right so therefore no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of god you become part of the bible god told ezekiel the prophet take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll become part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the holy spirit the holy spirit wrote the bible and the spirit of god is the word of god hallelujah hey man now he's conducting yeah how does he conduct conducts by his presence and movement i want to hit this now before we go the composer conductor is present in the room he doesn't give him the sheet music and then leave come on but he walks up in front of him right yes and he takes the same music right oh god no no that's not me right i know i'm standing in front of you today and this is like an orchestra like laid out like this but no i'm not the composer conductor right it's the holy spirit yes that's right but he's in the room yes now notice what jesus said in matthew 18 20 he said for where two or three we got that today right are gathered together in my name now i misquote this sometimes sometimes i misquote this i say i will be right christ will be in the midst that's not what he said there am i now that's different i will be speaks of him being there in the future so we're looking for him to come right that's not what he said he said when two or three are gathered together there am i means he's here right now right yeah i'm not waiting on him to come yes and you've got to believe that and if you can't believe that yes he is here what did brother brian do what was the purpose of brother brandon's ministry it was to show the people that he was there that's why he could tell a person's name and their address where they come from and discern those fear have those visions it wasn't to show brother brahanna it was to show that he was there oh god there am i in the midst of him pentecost was the first time that they ever felt his presence after he left right here they were standing there in the upper room and all of a sudden they feel the presence and brother random told us this i'm closing in just a moment but told us this if you feel his presence yes sir go to him if you feel his presence if you know that he's there and you see him there in the word he said the word of the word is the spirit the spirit is the word if you see him in his word and you know he's there then go to him how do i go to him you touch by faith to him of his garment if you feel his presence go to him oh god blind bartimaeus went to him by his faith by crying out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me the woman with an issue of blood went to him by running and jumping and going under all the things see there's different ways you may have to do to get to him but if you feel his presence go to him and she ran and jumped and crawled under people and everything else to press her way the bible says through the crowd to touch the hymn of his garment which he'd have never felt in the flesh but he felt it amen he felt it because it was it was something when she touched him he felt her faith oh god he could feel that same faith today he's still here he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you the conductor is here right and when you feel his presence watch what he's doing you sense his movement if you feel his presence go to him a man that believes in god how many believers do we have today if you believe in god then you can see the presence of god feel the presence of god sense the presence of god and know he's here sometimes that'll make you shout and run but many times when you feel his presence it makes you say like i say oh woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips i live among a people of unclean lips and it took before he could go out and do what god told him to do he was willing he said here am i send me and the cherubim took a coal of fire off the altar and put it on his lips he was in the presence of god he's here a man can that can feel can see the presence of god can feel the presence of god since the presence of god no he's here he's here to answer everything that he made promise for in this day brother random again he said oh the greatest pleasure i know of is to pray until i can realize i'm in the presence of god and recognize it yes how many can do that i wonder how many of us really pray until we can feel the presence of god until we can recognize it oh god feel his presence recognize it and he said he said i think that that ought to be the thrill of the church yes not that some fantastic speaker come not that some not that some a great song was played it was played so some so eloquently and played so well that's not what it's about but it's god being present with us and when we pray until we can feel his presence and we recognize it he said that ought to be the thrill of the church it's the presence of the holy spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word see it vindicated enough to give faith to make cripples walk blind see deaf here dumb speak amen do you believe it today do you believe it today if you believe it if you say well i know he's here because his word said where two or three are gathered in my name there am i there am i in the midst of him if you believe that and you believe he's here today then you believe the conductor is standing in front of you today not me but the holy spirit is here today if you believe that what do you have need of yes i'm challenging you this morning what do you have because the lord lord ask me to do this today and i i just have to do what he tells me to do i'm challenging you today do you believe it do you believe it if you believe it he's kept his word he is here today then all things are possible do you believe that today church what do you have need of what is there in your life what do you have what are you anxious about what is their coming tomorrow that you're worried about what are you worried about at school what are you worried about at work what are you worried about he said take no thought for tomorrow because the sufficient to the day is the evil thereof what is it that's weighing you down today he is here and if he is here you can have it yes yes all right i don't think we realize it i don't think we recognize it if you could just we reached the spot with a joel you were there we were at a camp meeting and and there wasn't going to be a prayer line that night but there was impromptu end up being three we were at a camping intent with about 400 young people who were sitting there and they reached the spot in that meeting of brother andrew glover was preaching you know reached a spot in that meeting right at the end of the service where if the people would just receive they could have it and i watched some that did but i watch others that way because they think well i've got to wait for the prayer line i've got to wait for this to happen i've got to wait for that and and i told i talked to brother wendell afterwards the pastor there i talked to him i said the window if they would have just received it right then that'd been it he was there but he's here today yes oh my well you have neither musicians would you come what do you have need of i want you to really think about that brother ben i've been told that before you didn't believe it like you should because if we really believed in the presence of the lord jesus that he was here we'd never walk out with what we came in with we'd never walk out with what we came in with all of our burdens and our fears and our worry and our cares he said well i came in sick and i didn't feel anything but he's here he didn't say did you feel it but do you believe it yeah amen if you believe it you can walk away oh if you believe it i'm not going to call a prayer line or have a healing service this morning i want you to believe that he's here and if he's here all things are possible yes sir oh my g can we sing there's power in the name of jesus to break every chain amen let's just believe that would you stand with me for a moment and i want you to i want you to believe it i want you to believe it the way he struck my heart at three o'clock in the morning the other day and i got up and i began to type these things and i've said it many times before but it just really struck me in a in a supernatural way if you're here lord you can do it if you're here all things are possible i'm very conscious of my own littleness very conscious of the fact that i don't have the natural abilities that it would take maybe to be a great pastor or a great preacher i'm very conscious of that but i do know that if he is here and if i can ever break into the realm of his presence all things are possible [Music] if i can ever by prayer reach out and grab ahold by faith of that he is here then i'm not limited to my abilities or disabilities he is here then i can reach out and touch him do you need salvation today would you raise your hand and just touch him do you need healing raise your hands and touch him today there's power in the name of jesus to break every chain whatever it is that you're struggling with today he's here the conductor is here and the conductor by the spirit of the word is calling you sin raise your hands to me believe me and i'll give it to you amen amen there is power in the name of jesus oh there is power oh in the name of jesus do you believe it today oh there is power in the name of jesus why don't you believe you believe it if you can sense his presence if you believe it today why don't you worship him why don't you worship him for what he's done he's already done it he's here let's just worship him for it lord i believe i believe today i believe you've done it i believe you're
