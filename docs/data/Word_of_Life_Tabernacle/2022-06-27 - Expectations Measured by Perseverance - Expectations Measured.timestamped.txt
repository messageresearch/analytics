[29:59] morning
[30:00] you know i read a passage just the other
[30:02] day
[30:03] i was looking through on my phone and i
[30:05] seen someone say
[30:06] you know jesus didn't go to the well
[30:08] because he was thirsty he went for the
[30:09] woman that was coming and so you know
[30:11] it's pretty amazing to me you know that
[30:13] jesus went there specifically for her
[30:15] but we'll go ahead and have the ushers
[30:16] come at this time but we enjoyed that
[30:18] service this morning
[30:19] amen just looking forward to what god
[30:21] has in store for us
[30:23] amen we have a prayer request just
[30:24] remember the one from this morning
[30:26] for the family member there and then
[30:28] this one's for brother bill says he's
[30:30] been out working on the working out on
[30:32] the farm and i think he's hurt himself
[30:34] or just needing some help in his neck
[30:35] and shoulders and hips
[30:37] uh and rain and all cabs so we
[30:39] definitely want to pray for our farmers
[30:40] right now and then that god would just
[30:42] send them send them some rain and
[30:45] i know the only one reason i wanted is
[30:46] for my yard to grow and my air
[30:48] conditioning to turn off but i know
[30:50] there's some farmers out there that
[30:51] really need the rain so
[30:53] i believe if we pray and ask god
[30:55] anything in his name he'll give it to us

[30:59] you've got an unspoken request if you
[31:00] want to just make it known by the

[52:08] amen let's turn to
[52:10] second kings chapter 13 and verse 14
[52:12] second kings
[52:14] 13 and 14.
[52:17] but joel if you can give me any more
[52:18] monitor up here i'm not wearing that ear
[52:20] monitor
[52:24] you'll have to have them hot anyway for
[52:26] brother wendell
[52:30] second kings 13-14
[52:33] now elisha was fallen sick of his
[52:35] sickness whereof he died
[52:38] and joash the king of israel
[52:40] came down unto him and wept over his
[52:42] face
[52:44] and said oh my father my father
[52:46] the chariot of israel
[52:49] and the horsemen
[52:50] thereof
[52:52] and elisha said unto him take bow and
[52:54] arrows and he took unto him bow and
[52:56] arrows
[52:57] and he said to the king of israel put
[52:59] thine hand upon the bow
[53:01] and he put his hand upon it and elisha
[53:03] put his hands upon the king's hands
[53:06] and he said open the window eastward and
[53:08] he opened it and then elisha said shoot
[53:11] and he shot
[53:13] and he said the arrow of the lord's
[53:15] deliverance
[53:16] and the arrow of deliverance from syria
[53:19] for thou shalt smite the syrians in
[53:21] effect till thou
[53:23] have consumed them
[53:24] and he said take the arrows and he took
[53:27] them and he said unto the king of israel
[53:28] smite upon the ground
[53:30] and he smote thrice and stayed
[53:33] and the man of god was
[53:35] wroth with him and said
[53:37] thou should have smitten five or six
[53:39] times
[53:40] then has thou smitten syria until thou
[53:42] hast consumed it
[53:44] whereas now thou shalt smite syria but
[53:46] thrice
[53:48] and jehoiash the son of we're skipping
[53:50] down to verse 25
[53:52] jehoiash the son of jehoiaz took again
[53:54] out of the hand of ben added the son of
[53:56] hazel the cities which he had taken out
[53:58] of the hand of jehoiaz's father by war
[54:02] three times
[54:03] did joash beat him
[54:06] and recovered the cities of israel
[54:09] oh what could he have done
[54:11] if he just keep striking
[54:14] amen
[54:15] pray the lord let his blessing to the
[54:16] word you may be
[54:18] seated
[54:21] kind of continuing on a theme that we've
[54:23] had the last couple sunday nights and
[54:26] i
[54:29] it must have been a a strange thing to
[54:31] joash to hear the prophet's rebuke
[54:34] he's standing there he thought he did
[54:36] good
[54:39] he thought he was doing everything the
[54:40] prophet asked him to do
[54:43] and he said i'm a good church member
[54:45] if you go back into joash's history it's
[54:47] a tragic story because he turned away
[54:49] from the lord
[54:50] he wasn't meant to have been that way
[54:53] and
[54:54] he was installed in the office by god
[54:58] and in a revival in a move of god
[55:01] and yet
[55:02] at this time
[55:04] he had backslidden in his purpose
[55:06] but yet he was still uh what we would
[55:08] call say a christian today or a believer
[55:11] he he thought he was doing pretty good
[55:14] and he thought he was doing all the
[55:15] prophet ask him to do that's the problem
[55:18] with legalism it's never enough
[55:21] it's never enough that's why you need
[55:23] the inspiration as to even the kids
[55:26] saying it needs to go from your head to
[55:27] your heart it needs to be go beyond
[55:30] something that you figured out and
[55:32] become something that you know
[55:34] become a reality become this become a a
[55:37] real thing in your life that's what we
[55:39] want something real
[55:42] and so it must have been a strange thing
[55:44] to him he must have thought my what what
[55:46] why couldn't i do i can't do anything
[55:48] right why couldn't i have received a
[55:52] approbation why couldn't i have received
[55:54] a word of
[55:56] encouragement from the prophet at this
[55:58] time because i've done what i've been
[56:00] asked to do but yet what he needed to do
[56:03] was to keep striking and to keep doing
[56:06] until he was told to stop now brother
[56:09] branham said the same things happened
[56:10] tonight in the christian church
[56:13] he said we obstruct the arrow of god's
[56:16] deliverance
[56:17] he said it was now i'm going to go
[56:18] somewhere maybe a little bit different
[56:20] than what you think but i want to lay
[56:22] this in as a background here
[56:24] tonight and i want to i want to talk to
[56:26] you about expectations measured by
[56:30] perseverance
[56:31] expectations measured by perseverance so
[56:34] brother madam said this same thing the
[56:37] arrow of god's deliverance has come
[56:39] but we've done the same thing with it he
[56:41] said we've struck the arrow of god's
[56:43] deliverance he said it was god sent past
[56:46] tense the arrow of deliverance to us how
[56:49] many know that tonight
[56:51] god sent the arrow of deliverance to us
[56:53] the arrow of deliverance is the holy
[56:56] spirit that's been sent shot from the
[56:59] bow
[57:00] of god's love
[57:01] he said when the eternity to eternity
[57:04] was pulled together by the court of love
[57:06] god shot the arrow of deliverance into
[57:09] the church
[57:10] on the day of pentecost you're going to
[57:13] preach with me tonight
[57:14] well i feel good tonight i feel like the
[57:16] lord is is doing something among us
[57:19] now he said god shot the arrow of
[57:21] deliverance into the church on the day
[57:22] of pentecost and the church
[57:24] was given in her hands
[57:27] amen
[57:28] he said god shot the arrow of
[57:30] deliverance and the church was given
[57:32] into her hand the arrow of god's
[57:34] deliverance
[57:36] and listen what he says the holy spirit
[57:39] will deliver the church
[57:42] out of any kind of a chaos
[57:44] it could get into
[57:48] glory
[57:49] you get into a chaos he said the holy
[57:51] spirit will deliver a church out of any
[57:54] kind of a chaos
[57:56] it can get oh that's what we need it's
[57:58] the holy spirit
[58:00] right we need to worship him in spirit
[58:02] and in truth now
[58:03] he said that he said to deliver out of
[58:05] any kind of a chaos he could get into
[58:07] but what does it do with it
[58:09] it being the church
[58:11] what do they do with it they picked up
[58:13] the arrow
[58:14] and they struck three times
[58:17] that's a backslidden
[58:20] king god
[58:22] they struck the arrow once
[58:24] and said well we'll build a church
[58:26] that's all right aren't you glad for a
[58:28] nice building
[58:30] we'll teach theology that's all right
[58:33] we need doctrine
[58:35] right
[58:36] we'll teach psychology
[58:38] and have an organization he said that's
[58:40] just about as far as you struck
[58:43] they struck short of many
[58:46] blessings
[58:48] and the church tonight he said hear me
[58:50] the church tonight is still striking
[58:52] short
[58:54] the church has struck short of the
[58:56] baptism of the holy ghost
[58:57] it struck short of deliverance from sin
[59:00] it's struck short but listen they don't
[59:02] have to be you tonight you can keep
[59:04] striking
[59:06] the church struck short he said oh you
[59:08] say i belong to church brother when you
[59:10] got that baptism of the holy ghost it
[59:12] takes that old temper out of you
[59:16] keep striking he said well that's still
[59:17] there brother ben keep striking
[59:20] you haven't you struck short
[59:23] he said it takes that old temper out of
[59:24] you puts you on a dress makes you act
[59:26] like a lady
[59:28] if you are one
[59:30] of
[59:30] course it'll make you quit your smoking
[59:34] you're drinking you're lying
[59:37] stealing and everything
[59:39] brother when you've got the baptism the
[59:40] holy ghost it separates you do we still
[59:43] believe that church
[59:45] amen it separates you delivers you from
[59:47] the things of the world it makes you
[59:49] love god
[59:51] oh now we're going to turn around on the
[59:52] positive side it don't only save you
[59:54] from drinking and smoking and lying but
[59:56] it makes you love god
[59:58] it makes you go to church
[1:00:02] i think that some people strike short
[1:00:04] he said it makes you go to church
[1:00:06] whether the pastors say or not whether
[1:00:08] your favorite preacher is there or not
[1:00:09] it makes you go to church it makes you
[1:00:11] worship
[1:00:12] him amen
[1:00:14] it makes you worship him it makes you
[1:00:16] tell your neighbor about it
[1:00:19] it makes you live
[1:00:21] above
[1:00:22] sin
[1:00:24] but the modern church has struck short
[1:00:26] of it
[1:00:26] and again i'm laying a background here
[1:00:28] for what we want to say this evening and
[1:00:30] then i'll quickly be done he said say we
[1:00:32] got a church we got a good teacher we
[1:00:34] got theology that is about as much as
[1:00:37] you know about
[1:00:38] he said every promise in the book is
[1:00:41] mine
[1:00:42] every chapter every verse every line
[1:00:44] reminds me of the tribes the two tribes
[1:00:47] that stayed on the other side
[1:00:49] oh god they stayed there oh it's a good
[1:00:52] place they could raise cattle but how
[1:00:54] much more could they have gotten if they
[1:00:55] went in
[1:00:57] and you find out that they paid for it
[1:00:58] later because you find out in the time
[1:01:01] of jesus that it was a place where there
[1:01:03] was just a bunch of hog farmers
[1:01:05] so they actually
[1:01:07] they actually struck short of the
[1:01:09] fullness of god let's not stop at the
[1:01:11] first poll of the second pope let's go
[1:01:13] on into the third poll where the
[1:01:15] promises say
[1:01:16] let's go in there
[1:01:18] where we can defeat bind the worst is
[1:01:20] that what we've been preaching where we
[1:01:22] can bind the worst or anything let's not
[1:01:24] stop at that knowing the word let's not
[1:01:27] stop at just understanding god sent a
[1:01:29] prophet but let's go on in today i mean
[1:01:31] want to go on in
[1:01:33] he said that about as much as you know
[1:01:34] about it but every promise in the book
[1:01:36] is mine do we believe that tonight
[1:01:38] we're in the land where the promises lay
[1:01:41] we're we're under a third the third poll
[1:01:43] we're living in that time we're not
[1:01:45] waiting on it expecting something else
[1:01:46] to come this is that
[1:01:50] hallelujah
[1:01:51] he said
[1:01:53] i hope you're awake this afternoon
[1:01:55] he said the modern church has struck
[1:01:57] short of it
[1:01:58] but every promise in the book is mine
[1:01:59] god sent the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:01] and put it into the hands
[1:02:03] of the church
[1:02:04] so whose hands is it in
[1:02:06] our hands
[1:02:08] he said to deliver the arrow of god's
[1:02:11] deliverance to deliver from sickness
[1:02:14] from sin
[1:02:16] from worry
[1:02:18] you believe god can do that for you
[1:02:20] from worry he said brother man i don't
[1:02:22] know what's coming neither do i but the
[1:02:24] arrow of god's deliverance if you'll
[1:02:26] keep striking it will deliver you from
[1:02:28] worry
[1:02:29] it'll deliver you from trouble
[1:02:32] from worldliness from everything else
[1:02:34] he said but we struck short of it
[1:02:37] now the bible
[1:02:38] speaks i want to turn a corner here and
[1:02:40] then kind of try to attempt to bring it
[1:02:43] back together in psalm 62 and 5 it says
[1:02:46] my soul wake thou only upon god for my
[1:02:48] expectation is from him now
[1:02:51] expectation in the old testament is hope
[1:02:53] in the new testament that's the word
[1:02:55] that's used as hope most often in the
[1:02:57] new testament it speaks of something
[1:02:59] different than our hope today and we'll
[1:03:00] explain that but in the old testament
[1:03:03] it's the hebrew word tikwa which is uh
[1:03:05] hope expectation
[1:03:07] it's the object for which one hopes or
[1:03:09] the basis of which one hopes so it's not
[1:03:12] a groundless hope or a wish
[1:03:15] but it's a it's a real
[1:03:17] expectation
[1:03:18] based on something
[1:03:21] it also meant to wait
[1:03:24] to wait
[1:03:25] believing in a future possibility
[1:03:28] oh my and so it refers to the object for
[1:03:32] which one hopes
[1:03:33] and this is the word in the old
[1:03:34] testament jeremiah 29 11. for i know the
[1:03:37] thoughts that i think towards you saith
[1:03:39] the lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:03:40] evil to give you
[1:03:42] an expected in who's doing the expecting
[1:03:45] all right
[1:03:46] have you ever thought about that verse
[1:03:48] someone give you an expected end who's
[1:03:50] doing the expecting yes sir
[1:03:53] you are
[1:03:56] think about it you're doing the
[1:03:57] expecting
[1:03:59] god's still god already knows
[1:04:03] god don't live in time you live in time
[1:04:05] but you're doing the expecting to give
[1:04:07] you an end that you expect why because
[1:04:10] you believe that the word is true
[1:04:12] you hear me today
[1:04:15] now so that new testament word for
[1:04:16] expectation is whole again it's not the
[1:04:19] same as our modern word for hope which
[1:04:20] is like well i hope it rains
[1:04:23] we could all say that i hope it rains
[1:04:24] but you don't really expect it to
[1:04:28] right
[1:04:29] boy you're quiet
[1:04:33] now you you expect god you you expect
[1:04:36] there to be rain when there's a cloud
[1:04:39] right but how much of a cloud do you
[1:04:40] have to see
[1:04:42] you see it's a little white clouds but
[1:04:43] remember
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] elijah had something more he saw a cloud
[1:04:48] the size of a man's hand
[1:04:50] he said i hear the sound
[1:04:52] of an abundance of rain
[1:04:55] that's the way we ought to be with god
[1:04:57] right he saw just a little bit he said
[1:04:59] that gives me a hope and expectation
[1:05:02] it's going to rain
[1:05:04] so it's not well i hope it rains i wish
[1:05:06] it rains
[1:05:07] brother branham speaks of that kind of
[1:05:09] hope and he said hope what a beautiful
[1:05:10] thing hope is it's a little timid hope
[1:05:13] lovely and sweet
[1:05:14] as she is he said yes she's the greatest
[1:05:16] enemy faith has
[1:05:18] he said that's right the greatest thing
[1:05:20] we face god is hope because a person
[1:05:21] becomes so hopeful so they leave away
[1:05:23] from faith
[1:05:24] he said now hope will agree with the
[1:05:26] bible hope will say it's true now he's
[1:05:27] talking again about our modern word hope
[1:05:30] which is a wishful thinking
[1:05:32] he said i believe every bit of it i
[1:05:33] believe that's the word of god i believe
[1:05:34] that god will keep his promise hope
[1:05:35] believes all of that but hope then says
[1:05:38] now i believe that god will heal
[1:05:40] but look at my condition
[1:05:44] faith don't look at that
[1:05:46] faith comes around says i don't care
[1:05:47] nothing about conditions god said so and
[1:05:49] it's mine how many say amen to that this
[1:05:52] afternoon god said so in its mind
[1:05:55] he said you see faith burly as i once
[1:05:57] said faith has hair on his chest
[1:06:00] when it stands up and pulls its big
[1:06:01] muscles out everything else vanishes
[1:06:03] away
[1:06:04] flees away when faith really takes a
[1:06:06] hold nothing else stands
[1:06:08] so we have a hope not not in a hope of
[1:06:11] the modern word that is a wish but we
[1:06:14] have an expectation
[1:06:16] for god to keep his word and this is the
[1:06:17] new testament oh romans 4 18 who against
[1:06:20] hope believed in hope speaking of
[1:06:21] abraham
[1:06:23] he against any right to expect anything
[1:06:25] good he expected good anyway
[1:06:28] that he might become the father of many
[1:06:30] nations according to that which was
[1:06:31] spoken
[1:06:32] so shall thy seed be romans 5 2 which we
[1:06:34] read last week by whom also we have
[1:06:36] access by faith into this grace wherein
[1:06:38] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[1:06:40] glory of god
[1:06:41] romans 8 20 for the creature was made
[1:06:43] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:06:45] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:06:48] in hope and expectation because the
[1:06:51] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:06:53] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:06:55] glorious liberty of the children of god
[1:06:57] for we know that the whole creation
[1:06:59] growneth and travaileth in pain together
[1:07:01] until now not only they but ourselves
[1:07:03] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:07:04] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:07:07] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:07:09] with the redemption of our body
[1:07:12] now watch what he says we are saved by
[1:07:14] hope
[1:07:15] now that's not this hope brother random
[1:07:17] is talking about that's just wishful
[1:07:18] thinking
[1:07:19] that's not just hope that's not burly
[1:07:21] but this is expectation
[1:07:23] we are saved by expectation
[1:07:26] but hope that is seen as not hope for
[1:07:28] what a man seeth what if he had hoped
[1:07:29] for but if we hope that's why i said
[1:07:32] you're doing the expecting god already
[1:07:34] sees it
[1:07:35] you're doing the expecting he said but
[1:07:37] if we hope for that we see not
[1:07:39] then do we with patience wait for it yes
[1:07:42] sir
[1:07:43] now
[1:07:44] brother branham takes expectation
[1:07:47] so i've been going through some of these
[1:07:48] older sermons and and kind of putting it
[1:07:51] together in my mind as far as like here
[1:07:53] is here is
[1:07:54] the arrow of god's deliverance which
[1:07:56] brother branham preached
[1:07:57] he talks about how they didn't strike
[1:07:59] long enough
[1:08:00] and here now is expectation which he
[1:08:02] preached and he took simeon in the bible
[1:08:05] in luke 2 25 there was a man in
[1:08:06] jerusalem his name was simeon the same
[1:08:08] man was justin devout waiting
[1:08:10] now there's that hope and expectation
[1:08:13] waiting for the constellation of israel
[1:08:15] and the holy ghost was upon him
[1:08:18] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[1:08:20] ghost
[1:08:21] that he should not see death
[1:08:23] before he had seen
[1:08:25] the lord's christ now notice he expected
[1:08:28] something
[1:08:29] that had been revealed to him to happen
[1:08:32] that's when
[1:08:33] expectation takes hold
[1:08:36] is when something's been revealed to you
[1:08:38] it's one thing to hear the preacher
[1:08:40] preach it it's one thing to sing it it's
[1:08:42] one thing to say it but when it's
[1:08:43] revealed to you that it's already done
[1:08:46] when it's revealed to you that your
[1:08:47] healing was included in the finished
[1:08:49] work at calvary when it's revealed to
[1:08:51] you that's something else entirely when
[1:08:53] it's revealed you wait with it you wait
[1:08:55] for it with patience with hope with
[1:08:56] expectation because it's revealed to you
[1:09:00] this was revealed to him
[1:09:02] now brother brown said expectancy that's
[1:09:04] a great thing to expect something you
[1:09:06] should get what you expect
[1:09:08] well we get a whole lot more out of
[1:09:09] church we'd expect more wouldn't we
[1:09:12] see our expectations change by the name
[1:09:14] of the person that's going to be
[1:09:15] preaching but god's expectations don't
[1:09:17] change
[1:09:19] you realize god's expectation don't
[1:09:21] change based on the man that has been
[1:09:23] preaching because he already knows the
[1:09:24] end from the beginning he knows what the
[1:09:26] service is going to be like
[1:09:28] but our expectations change you say well
[1:09:30] you usually get what you expect some
[1:09:32] people come to the meeting and say well
[1:09:33] i didn't expect to get anything out of
[1:09:35] it well they won't
[1:09:37] but those who expect to get something
[1:09:39] for the game
[1:09:41] oh we're expecting something to happen
[1:09:43] those who expect to get something god
[1:09:45] will give them their expectations
[1:09:48] oh god i believe the same god that gave
[1:09:50] your wife last year at the meeting can
[1:09:53] give you give your expectation this year
[1:09:56] what are we expecting
[1:09:58] remember what i said last week expect
[1:10:00] big things
[1:10:03] quit thinking small like you say well i
[1:10:05] i guess god won't you know it's just too
[1:10:07] big it's just too much no expect god
[1:10:10] oh while the presence of god is here
[1:10:11] when the angel the lord is moving in the
[1:10:13] services expect him to move expect him
[1:10:16] to heal expect him to deliver
[1:10:19] expect your children to come home
[1:10:21] am i preaching radical is this only for
[1:10:23] certain churches or is this for us
[1:10:25] tonight
[1:10:28] is it only for a big church is it for us
[1:10:30] i say it's for us tonight
[1:10:32] i says for us to believe
[1:10:35] that god's word is true
[1:10:37] amen that regardless of the circumstance
[1:10:39] the time of the place he's still jehovah
[1:10:41] jireh he still provides a lamb where
[1:10:43] there's no lamb
[1:10:45] no earthly expectation of a lamb being
[1:10:47] there but he provided it anyway
[1:10:49] oh do you believe that tonight church
[1:10:52] those who expect to get something god
[1:10:54] will give them their expectations if
[1:10:56] they're doing it reverently and in the
[1:10:58] fear of god
[1:10:59] he said now always to find out something
[1:11:02] first is to find out whether it's the
[1:11:03] will of god or not and then if it's the
[1:11:04] will of god then you're objective to it
[1:11:06] and your motive in doing it if it's the
[1:11:08] will of god your objective is right and
[1:11:10] your motive is right it's got to happen
[1:11:12] there's just no way to keep it from
[1:11:14] happening
[1:11:16] are you with me tonight
[1:11:18] oh we're going somewhere now brother
[1:11:19] brown said every man that ever believed
[1:11:21] in god
[1:11:22] or heard god's voice
[1:11:24] expected him to do something
[1:11:27] have you heard his voice
[1:11:29] i'm not talking about the literal voice
[1:11:30] of a man i'm talking about the voice of
[1:11:32] god
[1:11:34] through the message of the hour through
[1:11:35] the scriptures through the holy ghost
[1:11:37] speaking to your heart
[1:11:39] the voice of god
[1:11:41] if you heard it
[1:11:43] he said now if you can sit right where
[1:11:44] you are now
[1:11:47] i wonder what our expectation is tonight
[1:11:50] i expected to get hot
[1:11:52] so i took off my jacket
[1:11:54] see when you expect to do something
[1:11:55] there's always a corresponding action
[1:12:00] that's right you expect it to get hot
[1:12:02] you're going to start preparing for the
[1:12:03] heat
[1:12:04] you expect it to be cold you prepare for
[1:12:06] the cold the same thing's true in the
[1:12:08] spiritual
[1:12:09] when you expect something to happen you
[1:12:11] begin to prepare for that thing to
[1:12:12] happen
[1:12:13] he said if you can set right where you
[1:12:14] are now and so consecrate yourself to
[1:12:16] god and expect god to do something hear
[1:12:19] the voice of god whisper down in your
[1:12:21] heart
[1:12:22] you don't have to wait for a prayer card
[1:12:24] tomorrow night this is the time i'm
[1:12:26] gonna heal you that's all it's settled
[1:12:28] there'd be nothing else able to shake
[1:12:29] you from that
[1:12:31] if you never received the holy spirit
[1:12:33] oh i wonder if there's someone here that
[1:12:34] needs the holy spirit tonight that if
[1:12:36] you never receive the holy spirit and
[1:12:38] you say lord i sought the holy spirit
[1:12:39] for years but i just heard a voice tell
[1:12:41] me i'm gonna get it right tonight that
[1:12:43] settles it
[1:12:45] that's it you'll be so expecting and
[1:12:46] it'll have to happen
[1:12:48] you need to get yourself in condition to
[1:12:50] hear his voice yes
[1:12:53] he said dig those ditches out
[1:12:55] that's that's expectation
[1:12:58] how do we know that noah expected it to
[1:13:00] rain now i'm bringing it around
[1:13:02] how do we know that he expected it to
[1:13:05] rain
[1:13:06] well he built the ark
[1:13:09] and they come and laughed at him made
[1:13:11] fun of him it didn't happen when he
[1:13:12] thought it would
[1:13:14] and he still built the boat
[1:13:16] he still picked up the pitch and the tar
[1:13:18] he's still he's still
[1:13:20] he still encouraged his family he still
[1:13:22] preached the gospel he still kept doing
[1:13:24] it why because he expected it to happen
[1:13:26] i wonder do we expect a rapture do we
[1:13:28] expect a body change
[1:13:30] if we expect it we'll begin to get ready
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] how do we know that abraham expected a
[1:13:37] child
[1:13:38] how do we know what can we measure his
[1:13:40] expectation by
[1:13:43] now think about it
[1:13:44] he said well i expect god to do great
[1:13:46] things so how am i going to know that
[1:13:47] that's true
[1:13:49] by your perseverance
[1:13:53] by perseverance in building the boat
[1:13:56] noah proved to us
[1:14:00] that he expected god
[1:14:02] to move
[1:14:05] by his perseverance
[1:14:07] in expecting a child
[1:14:09] abraham persevered through all obstacles
[1:14:13] oh my for 25 years he persevered through
[1:14:16] every obstacle what was it for it proved
[1:14:19] to us
[1:14:21] what his expectation was that he really
[1:14:23] believed it
[1:14:25] now brother brother said perseverance to
[1:14:27] be persistent now i've tied those three
[1:14:29] together you go listen to that he said
[1:14:31] the arrow of god's deliverance thought
[1:14:33] from a bowl
[1:14:34] expectations which he preached several
[1:14:36] times and perseverance which he preached
[1:14:38] many times as well he said now
[1:14:39] perseverance to be persistent is to try
[1:14:41] to make a goal he said trying to you've
[1:14:43] got your mind set on something and
[1:14:45] you're persistent in it because you
[1:14:47] believe it's the thing that you want
[1:14:49] and you believe you can get it
[1:14:52] that's two things it's the thing that
[1:14:54] you want and you believe that you can
[1:14:56] get it
[1:14:57] so you expect it to take place and you
[1:14:59] persevere
[1:15:00] because of your expectation matthew 15
[1:15:03] and 21 says then jesus went thence and
[1:15:05] departed into the coast of tyre and
[1:15:07] sidon
[1:15:08] and behold a woman of canaan came out of
[1:15:11] the same coast and cried unto him saying
[1:15:13] have mercy on me o lord thou son of
[1:15:15] david my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:15:17] with a devil
[1:15:19] but he answered her not
[1:15:21] a word
[1:15:23] now look she comes out and she cries out
[1:15:25] to him thou son of david now she had no
[1:15:29] hold on him as son of david
[1:15:32] so when she spoke to him as son of david
[1:15:34] she's not a jew
[1:15:36] so to her he could not she could not
[1:15:38] access the blessings of god under that
[1:15:41] under that title
[1:15:43] right son of david she that she was a
[1:15:46] jew
[1:15:47] he said my daughter listen we're that's
[1:15:49] why we can speak the name of jesus yes
[1:15:53] why we're we're
[1:15:55] we are the gentiles
[1:15:57] right we come under the name of jesus
[1:15:59] and expect under that name
[1:16:04] that every blessing that he promised
[1:16:06] will come to us
[1:16:08] because that's his name to us
[1:16:10] you understand and now it to others to
[1:16:13] them he's son of david
[1:16:15] but to us he's jesus christ our lord
[1:16:17] jesus christ he's the son of god and son
[1:16:20] of man now
[1:16:22] he revealed himself the son of man at
[1:16:23] the end time now he said have mercy on
[1:16:25] me oh lord thou son of david my daughter
[1:16:27] is grievously vexed with the devil he
[1:16:29] answered are not a word his disciples
[1:16:31] came in beside him saying send her away
[1:16:35] you can imagine it's like the deacons
[1:16:37] come and say brother ben we got to deal
[1:16:38] with this
[1:16:40] this person shows up at every service
[1:16:46] and comes down to the altar and just
[1:16:48] cries and cries and cries
[1:16:51] she disrupts the service
[1:16:53] it reminds me of that woman that her
[1:16:55] baby died in mexico you remember the
[1:16:57] story
[1:16:58] her baby died and she was she was just
[1:17:00] uh
[1:17:01] she was so perseverant to get where she
[1:17:04] needed to go where she knew she expected
[1:17:06] that baby to be raised from the dead i
[1:17:08] don't know what give her that she maybe
[1:17:09] never heard the gospel the way we've
[1:17:11] heard it but there was something inside
[1:17:12] of her she believed that if she could
[1:17:14] just get in the presence of a prophet
[1:17:16] she'd seen the blind eyes healed the
[1:17:18] night before and so she expected that
[1:17:19] god could heal blind eyes he can heal my
[1:17:21] baby
[1:17:23] he can raise my baby from the dead
[1:17:25] and so she goes and what does she do she
[1:17:27] gets in trouble with the deacons
[1:17:29] she gets in trouble with the ushers and
[1:17:31] she said he said there she was climbing
[1:17:33] under him going over the top of them and
[1:17:35] we'd say well that lady wasn't in order
[1:17:37] but let me tell you what god wanted to
[1:17:39] do
[1:17:40] god wanted to get him just out of it out
[1:17:41] of order enough to be saved
[1:17:44] that's what brother brandon said
[1:17:46] and she had that expectation something
[1:17:48] was going to happen
[1:17:50] so what does she do she begins to crawl
[1:17:52] under and over and everything else and
[1:17:54] she finally reaches them and he was
[1:17:55] going to have brother moore go pray for
[1:17:57] her brother random is going to happen
[1:17:58] with the mortgages that she won't know
[1:17:59] the difference just to keep her quiet
[1:18:02] remember the word that we used was
[1:18:04] importunity i think the batteries are
[1:18:06] going dead on this one
[1:18:12] boo devil
[1:18:13] doesn't sound better anyway
[1:18:16] she expected something to happen
[1:18:21] she expected
[1:18:22] she expected there to be
[1:18:25] this needs turned down a little bit
[1:18:27] she expected there to be a healing so
[1:18:30] what does she do she goes up there
[1:18:31] brother man who's going to have to more
[1:18:32] pray for her and she begins to climb
[1:18:34] over everything and what happens the
[1:18:35] very next time
[1:18:37] here she comes and he sees a vision and
[1:18:40] god began to meet her expectation
[1:18:43] why now how do we know she expected it
[1:18:45] because her perseverance
[1:18:47] showed us that the expectation she had
[1:18:50] was right
[1:18:51] oh i hope you're hearing me today how do
[1:18:53] you say well i believe god can heal but
[1:18:55] are you knocking at the door
[1:18:57] i believe god can save my family are you
[1:19:00] talking to your family
[1:19:02] i believe god can give me the holy ghost
[1:19:03] are you praying for the holy ghost
[1:19:06] hallelujah expectation
[1:19:09] measured by perseverance
[1:19:12] oh god
[1:19:13] be like a preacher saying well i believe
[1:19:15] god's going to move in the sunday
[1:19:16] morning and then not studying at all
[1:19:21] well i believe god's going to move in
[1:19:22] the service but you don't prepare
[1:19:24] yourself for it
[1:19:25] if you really believe god's going to
[1:19:27] move you get yourself ready
[1:19:29] put aside everything else and say lord i
[1:19:32] believe that you're going to do what you
[1:19:33] promised you would do
[1:19:35] and he answered and said i'm not sent
[1:19:38] and the disciples came and said send her
[1:19:40] away she cries after us just go lay
[1:19:42] hands on her and let her go
[1:19:44] and he answered and said i'm not sent
[1:19:45] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:19:47] israel
[1:19:48] then came she she finally got through
[1:19:50] the deacons and got through everything
[1:19:51] else and she came and worshiped him
[1:19:53] saying lord
[1:19:54] help me
[1:19:56] but he answered and said
[1:19:59] it is not meat
[1:20:01] it's not it's not comely it's not
[1:20:03] appropriate
[1:20:05] for me to take the children's bread
[1:20:07] and to cast it to dogs
[1:20:10] and she said that's true lord
[1:20:14] you talk about saying amen brother dale
[1:20:17] in the worst circumstance preacher
[1:20:19] frieza says
[1:20:20] your race is a bunch of dogs
[1:20:23] amen lord
[1:20:25] like i said this morning but the brown
[1:20:26] said the white man was a real murderer
[1:20:31] amen lord
[1:20:34] but even the dogs
[1:20:36] and i love the way she says it
[1:20:39] said yet the dogs it's true lord
[1:20:41] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs if you go
[1:20:43] back in the original that's the little
[1:20:44] dogs
[1:20:46] the little puppies even
[1:20:48] that master has enough mercy on them
[1:20:50] to eat the crumbs which fall from their
[1:20:52] master's table
[1:20:54] oh i know esther is going to make hay
[1:20:56] with this scripture
[1:20:58] she found she she we managed to get two
[1:20:59] dogs because she found a scripture said
[1:21:01] two are better than one
[1:21:05] now she's gonna want to expect them to
[1:21:06] be fed from the table
[1:21:10] that's a misappropriation of scripture
[1:21:12] see i caught that spirit
[1:21:16] the dogs eat the crumbs the little dogs
[1:21:19] i may be a little dog she said but even
[1:21:22] the little dogs get some crumbs of mercy
[1:21:24] i may not be worthy of all the things
[1:21:27] i'm not worthy but i know this
[1:21:30] even the littlest part of god's economy
[1:21:32] think about it he said well i may not be
[1:21:34] the elect i mean no even the smallest
[1:21:36] part of god's economy receives blessings
[1:21:38] from god
[1:21:40] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:21:41] unjust don't let that get in your head
[1:21:43] well i've done some bad things i've done
[1:21:45] some things that are unworthy i've been
[1:21:47] a bad person don't you let that keep you
[1:21:49] from coming to god and persevering
[1:21:51] because if you expect him to do
[1:21:52] something for you you can come and
[1:21:54] persevere until he does
[1:21:58] amen
[1:21:59] the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[1:22:00] their master's table jesus answered and
[1:22:02] said it here oh woman great is thy faith
[1:22:05] be it unto thee even as thou wilt and
[1:22:07] her daughter was made whole from that
[1:22:10] very hour well no matter if she was a
[1:22:12] greek but the brandon said she was still
[1:22:14] persistent she had perseverance he said
[1:22:17] then somebody might have come up with
[1:22:18] this old proverb they still have it
[1:22:19] today the days of miracles has passed
[1:22:21] there's no such thing but no matter how
[1:22:23] many hollered at her the days of
[1:22:25] miracles has passed she still was
[1:22:27] persistent that might have been
[1:22:30] for them that believed it
[1:22:32] when they say the days of miracles
[1:22:33] passed just say for you they are
[1:22:36] because you don't believe it but not for
[1:22:38] her
[1:22:39] something had already happened inside
[1:22:42] that let her know that it wasn't past
[1:22:44] and listen the prophet said until you
[1:22:46] get past that barrier you'll never do no
[1:22:48] good
[1:22:49] you've got to come to a past that
[1:22:51] barrier god was but isn't now
[1:22:53] he's still god if he ever was god if he
[1:22:56] isn't the same god do we believe that
[1:22:57] tonight if he isn't the same god today
[1:23:00] he never was god see that's it it's man
[1:23:02] lost his faith not god lost his power
[1:23:04] god went back on his promise its man
[1:23:06] went back on the promise to believe
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:11] she was still persevering if the days of
[1:23:12] miracles was passed for all of them
[1:23:15] it wasn't for her
[1:23:17] see brother ben's mercy mercy's over not
[1:23:19] for me
[1:23:23] because i can't make it without his
[1:23:25] mercy
[1:23:27] healing's over not for me
[1:23:30] brother man you can't shout in the
[1:23:31] church anymore you can't have joy in the
[1:23:33] holy ghost not for me
[1:23:34] speak for yourself i still need it
[1:23:37] maybe you're revelating to the point
[1:23:39] where you don't need it but i still need
[1:23:40] to feel the move of god i still need to
[1:23:42] know what it's like to be drunk in the
[1:23:44] spirit of god i still need to know what
[1:23:46] it's like to hear the word and it not be
[1:23:48] just a dead letter but an inspiration
[1:23:50] that strikes my heart
[1:23:52] i still need to know what that's like
[1:23:54] oh and i want to stand for that for my
[1:23:56] children and if the lord carries my
[1:23:58] children's children
[1:24:00] amen he made me the not be the same god
[1:24:03] for you but he is for me
[1:24:05] if he isn't the same god today he never
[1:24:07] was god see that's it
[1:24:09] and she was still persevering if days of
[1:24:10] miracles were passed for all of them it
[1:24:12] wasn't for her
[1:24:13] why she struck past that sound barrier
[1:24:15] she got a hold of something
[1:24:17] something had struck her
[1:24:20] so when she worshipped him
[1:24:22] i love this
[1:24:24] i said lord help me
[1:24:26] jesus said but you know it's not me for
[1:24:28] me to take the children's bread and cast
[1:24:29] it to you dogs oh my that'd have been a
[1:24:31] modern pentecostal she had turned that
[1:24:33] little nose up
[1:24:35] i said i'll never go to a meeting like
[1:24:36] that again
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:40] oh he said why they don't
[1:24:43] why would they turn their nose up why
[1:24:44] would they quit church
[1:24:48] they don't have the hope that she had
[1:24:52] that's right she had the hope
[1:24:54] now what hope is he talking about here
[1:24:56] the expectation
[1:24:58] she had the hope she had heard and faith
[1:25:00] had caught it
[1:25:01] she had a reason she had a need and she
[1:25:03] wasn't just wasn't going to turn loose
[1:25:07] hallelujah
[1:25:08] now her perseverance showed her
[1:25:10] expectation
[1:25:11] it measured it
[1:25:13] she had a hope that they didn't have
[1:25:16] king joash in our story he didn't have
[1:25:18] that kind of hope
[1:25:20] so he took the arrow of god's
[1:25:21] deliverance
[1:25:23] oh god
[1:25:25] because he looked at the circumstances
[1:25:26] perhaps and said well
[1:25:28] the syrians will just keep coming back
[1:25:30] till they beat us
[1:25:31] the cancer it'll keep coming around one
[1:25:33] day it'll get me
[1:25:35] the the diabetes one day it's going to
[1:25:36] take my life
[1:25:38] the blood pressure one of these days i'm
[1:25:39] going to have a heart attack we're going
[1:25:41] to have a stroke
[1:25:44] oh it just happens 100 times out of 100
[1:25:46] it's just it's just
[1:25:47] the nature that's just the way it is
[1:25:50] but see you need to have hope in the
[1:25:51] lord
[1:25:53] david said hope in the lord
[1:25:55] expect from the lord
[1:25:57] see king joaz he thought well given the
[1:25:59] situation
[1:26:00] well he didn't want to ask for too much
[1:26:02] because chances are he might be ashamed
[1:26:05] but see how could you ask too much from
[1:26:08] a god
[1:26:09] who knows all things
[1:26:12] how could you ask too much from a god
[1:26:14] who believe who sees all things
[1:26:17] how could you ask too much brother
[1:26:18] brandon said it's like going into the
[1:26:20] ocean and taking out a thimbleful out of
[1:26:22] the ocean and coming out and saying well
[1:26:23] i better leave the rest there there may
[1:26:25] not be enough
[1:26:27] there's always going to be enough
[1:26:30] oh i hope you see it tonight church
[1:26:32] there's always going to be enough and
[1:26:34] the way you what you expect to happen
[1:26:36] that's what your perseverance will be
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:42] so now
[1:26:43] here was the here was the the bow of
[1:26:45] god's love
[1:26:47] that's what brother brandon said
[1:26:49] shot the arrow of god's deliverance
[1:26:52] which is the holy ghost
[1:26:54] into the church
[1:26:56] now it's in the hands of the church
[1:27:01] it was struck
[1:27:02] once we'll build a church
[1:27:06] and you see where i was going now i'm
[1:27:07] almost done
[1:27:10] you can keep from falling asleep for the
[1:27:12] next five minutes
[1:27:16] struck it once
[1:27:17] built a church
[1:27:20] struck it twice got the doctrine
[1:27:24] struck it a third time
[1:27:26] oh now there's theology creeping in
[1:27:28] organization
[1:27:30] what are you gonna do keep striking
[1:27:36] maybe you've got a situation that seems
[1:27:38] like it just can't
[1:27:39] it's never going to change
[1:27:41] you don't know that
[1:27:46] i know this if you don't keep asking
[1:27:48] it's not going to change
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:50] if the sour phoenician woman walks away
[1:27:52] when jesus said it's not meat for me to
[1:27:54] take the children's bread and give it to
[1:27:55] dogs and she said okay jesus said it
[1:27:58] i'll just have to go
[1:28:00] i i find it strange how easily people
[1:28:02] have accepted well there's no more
[1:28:03] preachers no more
[1:28:06] no more holy ghost
[1:28:07] we just got accepted it's just the age
[1:28:09] that we live in wait a minute
[1:28:12] maybe you don't have any
[1:28:14] because you haven't struck
[1:28:16] you only struck to build a church
[1:28:19] you only struck to get a group together
[1:28:20] you only struck to say i believe a
[1:28:22] prophet but there's more
[1:28:24] you struck for the first pole in the
[1:28:26] second pole but there's a third pole out
[1:28:28] there
[1:28:29] there's an opening of the word there's a
[1:28:31] an endless supply of god's blessings
[1:28:33] that you don't stop at the third time
[1:28:34] say we don't even stop at the third pole
[1:28:36] of brother madam's ministry we keep
[1:28:37] going because it's an endless word it's
[1:28:40] an open book it's not closed anymore we
[1:28:42] keep going into the blessings of god it
[1:28:45] don't mean we preached something
[1:28:46] different than brother branham preached
[1:28:47] we preached the same gospel
[1:28:49] that paul preached the same gospel that
[1:28:51] brother brandon preached but it's now
[1:28:53] it's coming to a place where we know
[1:28:55] that that we're striking until the
[1:28:57] rapture
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:01] what do you expect
[1:29:04] i wonder
[1:29:05] if our rapture expectation could be
[1:29:07] measured by our perseverance and getting
[1:29:09] ready for it
[1:29:13] oh god
[1:29:15] let me turn this around a little bit i
[1:29:16] wonder if our rapture expectations could
[1:29:18] be measured by how we tell others about
[1:29:21] it
[1:29:24] he said go into all the world preach the
[1:29:26] gospel to every creature
[1:29:27] these are things i thought about myself
[1:29:30] does our rapture have we given up on the
[1:29:32] message you said well i
[1:29:34] you know
[1:29:35] everybody's fighting about it you know
[1:29:36] it just
[1:29:37] it is what it is
[1:29:38] they fought in the new testament they
[1:29:40] fought in the old testament people are
[1:29:42] people
[1:29:44] but there's a word here that can change
[1:29:45] your life
[1:29:49] oh god
[1:29:51] do you believe you see but
[1:29:53] the jesus said from the days of john the
[1:29:55] baptist
[1:29:56] until now the kingdom of heaven suffered
[1:29:58] violence now you remember he said on the
[1:30:00] violent take up by force you remember in
[1:30:01] the old testament to a certain group you
[1:30:03] know how you knew how would you measure
[1:30:05] what your expectation or what your
[1:30:06] potential could be in the old testament
[1:30:08] well if you were a jew
[1:30:11] right if you were a jew you could you
[1:30:13] could take you were abraham's seed
[1:30:15] right you could take the gate of your
[1:30:17] enemy
[1:30:18] right that you promised that
[1:30:20] but now you don't have a natural way if
[1:30:22] you were circumcised there was a natural
[1:30:24] way to see it
[1:30:26] but now look at it there's
[1:30:28] i can't look at you and say you can't
[1:30:30] show me you don't have a card in your
[1:30:31] pocket says i'm bride
[1:30:38] how do we know who the bride was in the
[1:30:39] vision h
[1:30:40] how do we know who the bride was in the
[1:30:42] in all these ages
[1:30:44] how do we know
[1:30:45] the kingdom of heaven from the days of
[1:30:46] john the baptist from the end of the old
[1:30:48] testament until now it suffers violence
[1:30:52] amen
[1:30:53] and the violence the ones who are
[1:30:55] willing to step out in faith
[1:30:57] the ones who are willing to walk on the
[1:30:59] promises of god the ones who are willing
[1:31:01] to take the land is that you tonight
[1:31:04] is that me tonight we need to be willing
[1:31:06] to walk out and take the land the
[1:31:08] violent take it by force
[1:31:10] amen how do you know who god's elect is
[1:31:13] it won't be by natural circumcision it
[1:31:15] won't be by race
[1:31:17] it won't be because you have a lot of
[1:31:19] money
[1:31:21] but do you take the kingdom of heaven do
[1:31:22] you take the promises of god that are
[1:31:24] revealed to you
[1:31:25] and persevere until you become that
[1:31:27] promise
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:30] that's the challenge tonight
[1:31:33] i hear
[1:31:35] you say well brother brother ben i just
[1:31:36] don't feel like it well of course you
[1:31:37] don't
[1:31:41] we're waiting on a change of this vile
[1:31:42] body let me tell you when you'll feel
[1:31:44] like it
[1:31:45] when you get a body change
[1:31:48] that's when you'll feel like being in
[1:31:49] church on a sunday afternoon the first
[1:31:51] time
[1:31:54] when you get a body change and that's
[1:31:57] why sometimes as a pastor and sometimes
[1:31:59] as as ministers we have to kind of push
[1:32:01] and prod a little bit it's not because
[1:32:02] we believe you're not alex because we
[1:32:04] believe we you are
[1:32:06] you are the elect and because you are
[1:32:07] the elect you have potentials others
[1:32:09] don't have
[1:32:10] and so we tend to prod we tend to push
[1:32:12] we tend to do that a little bit because
[1:32:14] we want you to recognize your potential
[1:32:16] we want you to know that there's an
[1:32:17] expectation that you should have and
[1:32:19] that expectation should be measured by
[1:32:21] your perseverance
[1:32:23] how else are we going to know whether
[1:32:24] you believe you're the bride if you
[1:32:26] believe he said well i'm the bride but
[1:32:27] you never show up at church
[1:32:29] oh i'm the restored bride by restored by
[1:32:31] malachi 4 i've had people tell me i've
[1:32:33] been restored by malachi foreign
[1:32:35] the elijah couple restored all things
[1:32:37] well they'll fight with you about that
[1:32:39] they believe that
[1:32:40] what happened to you then
[1:32:43] you can't go to church you got your
[1:32:44] feelings hurt everywhere you've ever
[1:32:45] been
[1:32:48] you got nobody you got any trust or
[1:32:50] confidence in you don't believe in the
[1:32:51] ministry no more you don't believe in
[1:32:52] anything anymore
[1:32:54] you're hoping that brother branham comes
[1:32:55] back so you can finally get a revival
[1:32:59] but that's not what the bride's waiting
[1:33:00] on
[1:33:01] oh my you'll be known by your
[1:33:03] perseverance
[1:33:05] you'll be known because you go to church
[1:33:06] and don't feel like it you'll be known
[1:33:08] because you do things that are hard to
[1:33:09] do but you do it anyway
[1:33:12] why because you're the bride
[1:33:14] i may be one of the gentiles but i know
[1:33:17] that if i can storm the gates of heaven
[1:33:19] there's a there's a victory waiting for
[1:33:21] me hey man i believe if there's a desire
[1:33:24] in me there if there's a deep calling
[1:33:25] there's a deep to respond if i have a
[1:33:28] healing if there's sickness in my body
[1:33:29] there's healing somewhere for me let me
[1:33:31] go till i find it
[1:33:34] let me let me storm the gates of heaven
[1:33:37] let me knock at the door until i find it
[1:33:40] hallelujah oh if this was the last
[1:33:42] sermon that ever preached to you let me
[1:33:44] let me tell you this with all of my
[1:33:46] heart if you storm the gates of heaven
[1:33:48] there will be an answer
[1:33:51] if you if you knock it'll be open to you
[1:33:53] if you ask
[1:33:55] you shall receive
[1:34:00] and if you don't
[1:34:02] you won't
[1:34:07] there's a little bride waiting
[1:34:11] you remember the story she'd been told
[1:34:14] here comes the man from
[1:34:15] the great armor corporation he come out
[1:34:17] there she'd been told that
[1:34:20] he was coming
[1:34:21] to take her as his bride
[1:34:23] he wasn't looking for something flashy
[1:34:25] he was looking for somebody who took the
[1:34:27] dish water out
[1:34:28] perseverance
[1:34:32] i come to pull my sleeves up to give me
[1:34:34] part to be able to be a part that's the
[1:34:36] kind of christians we want
[1:34:38] people are willing to work people don't
[1:34:39] get their feelings hurt every little
[1:34:41] thing
[1:34:42] i'm coming to i'm coming to work
[1:34:45] i'm coming to believe i'm coming
[1:34:46] trusting god i'm coming rugged ready to
[1:34:49] and so she was a worker
[1:34:51] he looked at her and he said there's
[1:34:52] character in you i don't find in the
[1:34:54] others
[1:34:55] and so he says i'm going to come at a
[1:34:56] certain time
[1:34:58] and and here she was what did she do she
[1:35:00] didn't wait till the last minute
[1:35:02] but she during that time while she had
[1:35:04] expectations of him coming she didn't
[1:35:06] sit down and say well he's got me now
[1:35:08] i'm the elect
[1:35:10] he said he would be here so no he
[1:35:12] wouldn't have come for somebody like
[1:35:14] that
[1:35:15] i'm the elect everything's gonna be okay
[1:35:16] i'll just lay here and wait on to come
[1:35:19] sit here in the sauna sit here in the
[1:35:21] spa and just wait on him
[1:35:23] he comes back and she's not dressed
[1:35:25] you come back and she's not ready her
[1:35:27] hair's not combed or you hear me tonight
[1:35:29] he's not coming for a bride like that
[1:35:31] but he saw in her a character that would
[1:35:34] not just look at it and say well he
[1:35:35] called me so i must be okay but he
[1:35:37] founded her a character that said if
[1:35:39] someone that worthy called me who was
[1:35:41] unworthy then there must be a place i
[1:35:44] can go to there must be a reality that i
[1:35:46] can come to that i must be able to do
[1:35:49] what he wants me to do
[1:35:51] hey man he told to be ready what does
[1:35:53] the scripture say the bride has made
[1:35:55] herself ready
[1:35:57] oh it would wash in the robes of his
[1:35:59] righteousness we couldn't make our own
[1:36:00] righteousness we can't work enough to be
[1:36:02] righteous
[1:36:03] but if he gives us the rope the least we
[1:36:05] could do is put it on
[1:36:08] let me just let me your perseverance
[1:36:12] in dressing
[1:36:14] oh are you hearing me tonight
[1:36:17] your perseverance and getting dressed
[1:36:18] for the event
[1:36:20] tells how much you expect
[1:36:23] out of the event
[1:36:26] we live in a day when it doesn't matter
[1:36:27] and everybody just wear whatever they
[1:36:28] want to church
[1:36:33] but your perseverance is getting ready
[1:36:35] and i'm talking spiritually
[1:36:37] as the bride
[1:36:41] is a measure
[1:36:42] of your expectation
[1:36:45] i'm going to be there
[1:36:46] what are we seeing at the beginning i'm
[1:36:48] going to make it
[1:36:49] it's already
[1:36:50] done hallelujah
[1:36:53] i know it's been simple tonight
[1:36:56] why don't we just take a moment as the
[1:36:57] musicians would come remember
[1:37:01] i want to take a little bit let's
[1:37:02] worship together
[1:37:07] i uh
[1:37:08] you remember the pawn lily
[1:37:11] and the story brother branham told you
[1:37:13] know what pawn lily
[1:37:15] was a seed at one time it got dropped
[1:37:18] and as it was dropped it it went through
[1:37:20] the light and down through the darker
[1:37:22] waters and down through the muck and the
[1:37:24] mire and finally it reached hard ground
[1:37:27] and it reached it laid there all winter
[1:37:31] and it lays there in the cold and the
[1:37:33] darkness entombed in in clay and mud
[1:37:37] it lays at the bottom
[1:37:41] at springtime see the sun that comes
[1:37:43] down see the sun reaches more than what
[1:37:45] you can see it reaching
[1:37:49] the seed may be too low for the sun for
[1:37:51] the ray of the sun to actually change
[1:37:53] the appearance of the water
[1:37:56] but what does it do it warms the
[1:37:57] temperature of it
[1:38:00] and it warms the temperature when the
[1:38:01] water temperature is warm it warms the
[1:38:03] temperature of the mud
[1:38:05] until it reaches a certain atmosphere
[1:38:09] oh my i was talking about that in the
[1:38:11] office earlier things don't just happen
[1:38:12] overnight
[1:38:13] god takes time
[1:38:15] he's building something good
[1:38:17] he's doing something good
[1:38:19] and so when the water when the
[1:38:20] temperature gets right the lily will
[1:38:22] begin to come up
[1:38:23] and then as it begins to come up it'll
[1:38:25] come it'll push through the muck and the
[1:38:27] mire and the clay
[1:38:28] as it comes up it begins to work its way
[1:38:31] towards the sun
[1:38:32] it's never even it's never even been on
[1:38:35] top before but it's working its way to
[1:38:38] the top
[1:38:39] and it can have that expectation because
[1:38:42] expectation is potential
[1:38:44] because inside of the seed
[1:38:47] oh god
[1:38:48] inside there's a dna coated into that
[1:38:50] seed that says i'm upon lily yes sir
[1:38:54] or you hear me today i'm upon lily see
[1:38:56] you can know it with your head but is
[1:38:58] there something inside the seed you
[1:39:00] can't keep that down
[1:39:02] there's a dna coated in to the inside of
[1:39:05] that seed and it begins to express
[1:39:06] itself and it pushes through the muck
[1:39:09] and pushes through the mire pushes
[1:39:10] through the circumstances of life pushes
[1:39:12] through the tiredness pushes through the
[1:39:14] the hardness pushes through all the
[1:39:16] things of life until it finally it
[1:39:18] begins to poke its head up and finally
[1:39:20] it reaches a place
[1:39:21] where it can become what it's supposed
[1:39:23] to be what is it a giver
[1:39:26] oh god
[1:39:27] it reaches a place where it becomes
[1:39:29] reverend mr lily where it begins to just
[1:39:31] give
[1:39:32] constantly
[1:39:33] until another seed drops down
[1:39:36] and the whole process begins
[1:39:38] all over again
[1:39:40] you see it's hard-coded in that it
[1:39:42] there's something inside of you this
[1:39:43] potential
[1:39:45] it creates expectation
[1:39:47] and then we see that the expectation is
[1:39:49] there by your perseverance
[1:39:51] or you might fail
[1:39:53] but your dad don't stop you
[1:39:56] you might mess up
[1:39:58] that don't stop you push your way
[1:40:00] you get up to higher ground
