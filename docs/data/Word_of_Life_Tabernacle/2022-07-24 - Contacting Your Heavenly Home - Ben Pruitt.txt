believe that you know we can we can serve fear or we can have faith this morning that god is still the healer as far as the testimonies go sister karen said that her knee had been bothering her and after saturday night she'd go to walmart and brother bill would walk and she would have to ride a scooter around walmart said she went to walmart and walked all the way around walmart i guess at least one time and had no knee pain no soreness or anything thank the lord for that said she was healed during the meetings her grandson also was dealing with headaches and came through the prayer line

every need this morning you believe that amen as the word goes forth just pull on the gift of god and i believe god is here to reward your faith for being here this morning those that are listening in just enter into the service and just trust the lord maybe maybe you just be healed right there where you're sitting today amen fill my cup lord and let's just sing with all our hearts as we worship as a pastor comes [Music] i lift it up this thirsting up my soul and bread of heaven [Music] and make me whole sing like this here's my cup lord [Music] is [Music] more [Music] heavenly father we come before you today with thankful hearts and grateful hearts lord and know that you're the god who created the universe lord that you come down here with us to be among us to be one of us we're so grateful for that today god that you would come down in this service and speak directly to these people and and to me lord i i pray that you would do that today move me out of the way the words that are spoken be only your words lord as we talk about these important things today i pray god that you'd help us give us faith to believe lord lord and may we may we recognize it as your word in order to go forward and move on and recognize not only your word but recognize the devil at every one of his trips and be able to overcome those things we pray i pray for each one that is sick this morning lord many maybe most that are watching on the stream today i pray you'd bless them maybe have church lord in their living room or in the car wherever they're at this morning i pray lord that you would bless them may your presence be there with them lord until we can gather together lord as a body again i pray you grant it now we thank you for all these things in jesus name amen amen do you love the lord this morning amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. we'll read down through verse 3. it's good to be back with you it's been a while since i've stood here in the pulpit but we believe the lord has been here with us and so thankful for all those that took my place while we were gone and also the meetings that we had wasn't that wonderful i feel the presence of the lord but that same god is still here today and so we believe that he's able and willing to do what we have need of today hebrews 11 and 1. i want to speak uh this morning on how to contact your heavenly home how to contact your heavenly home peter you're gonna have to restart that slide computer to get that to fix those slides man we love technology don't we how do we contact our heavenly home not by technology i can promise you that amen hebrews 11 and 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god what are we worried about this morning the worlds were framed he didn't just say the earth but the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning i heard a story of a man who was visiting america he's visiting all the churches and he goes to a great cathedral in new york city and he finds in that cathedral that they had a golden telephone and it said a call to heaven ten thousand dollars and he said my goodness they said well it's long distance you know so it costs a little bit of money and so he goes to state by state and goes to america and he finds in each state they have churches that have phones in them and finally makes his way to arkansas and he gets to arkansas and he gets down a little church here in the hills somewhere he says he saw a golden telephone there but when he looked at that telephone he noticed it said call to heaven 45 cents and he said why is it called to heaven 45 cents from here can you really reach heaven from arkansas he said oh yes he said but it's a local call all right now but you know if we could have a telephone to heaven wouldn't that be wonderful just pick up the phone call and and we have prayer and we thank god for that but i want to uh go a little bit deeper this morning and realizing that prayer alone does not contact god that's right it's just words unless there's faith behind the prayer there's got to be something deeper there's got to be faith and so paul tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and brother branham whenever he would quote that he would say not seen not heard not felt not touched right he'd go through the five senses and say that faith is not contacted or it's the evidence of things that we can't contact with our five senses now when we look at the five senses the five senses are are sight or seeing taste feeling touch smell and hearing now those are senses by which we contact our earthly home without those senses our contact would be dulled if you couldn't see you couldn't contact your the earth in that way if you couldn't feel then you would lose a contact that you have with the earth each one of those causes you to contact the earth in a certain way and brother branham taught us that there's also five senses of the spirit realm so now and i'm just going to do a little teaching this morning and kind of just lay this in here and if you're watching stir your conscience this morning and and then poke your husband or your wife and tell them watch the service this morning because i believe this is important especially being through what we've been through because we've just come through a great spiritual time and it's spiritual in two ways we come through a mighty meeting a revival a word of god was preached and and the presence of god was here but then satan attacks right that's also in the spiritual realm and so satan and god both have access to these ten senses the five of the flesh and the five of the spirit which are imagination conscience memory reason and affections so brother branham taught us he said there's three people of you the outside is the body you've got five senses that you contact your earthly home with that the inside is the spirit there's five senses there love and conscience and so forth you contact but the inside of that is the soul so now you find him teaching that now he said now i believe then that a man is saved when he believes on the lord jesus christ now listen he's saved when he believes in the lord jesus christ with all of his heart and from his heart not from his outside conscience now he said see you're a dual person three people in one soul body and spirit he said when you're awake in other words you're operated by five senses see taste feel smell and hear he said them were only given to you to contact your earthly home and they were not given to you to contact your heavenly home oh my he said there's actually six senses in a human body yeah oh my because he is number six in the bible the man is he said he was created on the sixth day he is number six a man is he's got seed taste filled smell here in faith his faith sets his destination he said brother ben where am i going what is your faith yes sir that sets your destination what's my life going to be like tomorrow what am i going to have to deal with in the weeks ahead what am i going to have am i going to be a real christian or am i going to be a halfway backslid huh come on church what am i going to be what's your faith that sets your destination am i going to heaven what's your faith this morning do you believe that you're going to heaven do you believe you're a child of god do you believe you're a son or daughter of of the king what's your expectation what's your faith and then that will your faith then we'll call what the window was talking about sunday morning how we welcome him in we invite him in we welcome him into our presence we entertain him when he comes your faith will cause you to do that the woman that touched the hem of his garment she had the faith to believe and to reach out and touch him of his karma what'd she touch him by by the sixth sense she didn't she didn't touch him by physical touch she touched him by the sixth sense by faith so now he said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you do not see tastes feel smell or hear but by faith when he catches the word oh my he's talking about a man now human being by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension oh my that makes it so real to him see unless you believe it it don't do you any good all the words you could listen to all the tapes you could listen to you can listen to all the preachers you could come and listen you could hear about healing over and over again you could heal about hear about salvation over and over and over again but unless you believe it it's never going to do you any good but if you ever believe it not with the outside man but from the inside if there's something there that can be contacted by faith and faith reaches out and what does it do you catch the word and it sends you into another dimension he said it makes it so real to him till it's he's just as good as god in his hands he knows it's going to happen right so of course satan's going to battle that through reason and affection and emotion right and so we had the question you know why sometimes when you come to the prayer line you feel good and other times you come to a prayer line you feel bad yeah sure i stood in prayer lines with a headache myself praying for people i stood in prayer lines so where you can't hardly stand up and not just from praying for people because you're so sick yet you're praying for people you say how is that possible well jesus did that yeah brother branham said he sat by the side of the road with a headache because he was human like we are sitting on the side of the road with a headache and he said that the widows came by and her son had passed away and the funeral procession was going by he gets up goes and raises the dead yeah goes back with the same headache and sits down on the side of the road right now because he was human right and so but what happens is many times we think well these other things are present so there must i know it's your faith that that context god it's not whether you feel good or bad it's not how loud you shout although many times faith will cause you to shout right faith will cause you to to reach out and do those things but faith itself is the substance of things hoped for it's not any of these other feelings or or any other uh any other contact that you have but yet god uses that and i'm gonna show you that in a moment now so now he said he knows it's gonna happen now you know some people might say well brother ben i think we'll just forget about these meetings we'll just forget about having good services we'll forget about atmosphere we'll forget about all these things because it's faith anyway and faith and we don't contact god by our earthly by our earthly uh senses and that's true and someone told with ron spencer said he said well i'm afraid i'll get in the flesh he said what else you gonna get in you're in the flesh right but you know you you think that way sometimes i said well you know i went to the meeting and and i was prayed for and i come right across the prayer line and and i felt good but then i got home and i felt bad so i must not have done anything i went to the prayer line i got prayed for and ended up with coping i come through and and maybe i felt worse when i left well of course you would the devil's going to fight you right because it took faith to come to the prayer line right and so now you say well i get what i'll do is i'll just i'll just have faith alone i won't have any of these other other things i'll just believe and then i'll just sit quietly and i won't go to church i won't i won't try to get into the atmosphere of the spirit because it doesn't do any good but now watch god does use those things remember those are they're not good or bad emotions are not good or bad they can be good or bad depending on depending on where it's coming from where that influence is coming from the same you can have an emotion of love that's a good thing you can have an emotion of hatred that's a bad thing what satan brings one god brings the other yes well brother ben how will i know the difference stay with the word if it agrees with the word you accept it yes if it disagrees with the word you reject it right that's why you might come like i said there might be a even in the prayer line sometimes even with the angel the lord will come and you'll feel a dread you'll feel a strange feeling and sometimes it's the angel of the lord sometimes it's the devil trying to fight you sometimes it's a spirit left over because remember when spirits are cast out they look for someone else to go into that's right and they're looking for people with doubt remember that but just because you feel it don't mean you have to accept it are you hearing me this morning just because you feel bad don't mean you have to be sick just because you feel like well i i feel this way i better not go to church you know don't you realize that's just what the devil wants you to do oh my but we want to overcome don't we now so you say well i'll just forsake the senses of the flesh and of the spirit and go straight to faith okay let's read romans 10 17 because then you'd need to know how would we get faith how would we get faith if you're going to forsake what you hear and what you see i just won't listen to nothing i won't hear nothing i won't get involved in none of the meetings come on i won't get involved in none of that i'll just sit here won't say man i'll just wait on faith faith comes by now i thought that was one of the five senses do you ever think about that we actually get faith by hearing and hearing by the word of god now god uses our hearing he's doing it right now he uses our hearing have you ever listened to a a tape of the prophet listen to a message of brother branham saying you and your faith just begins to build and begin to build i noticed in the meetings when we played the tape before saturday night servants of faith just began to build begin to build maybe you listen to some other preacher or you listen to one of our services your faith just begins to build why faith comes by hearing faith comes by hearing god uses that sense and what you don't realize is god uses all of these senses to get to you sometimes you have a feeling there's a touch there's a whatever that it is god can use that to contact you and and i'll prove that to you because he did use that when he come to earth we handled god humanity touched god humanity smelled god he did he eats them up just like any other man humanity humanity was able to see god oh my but they could only know who he was by faith who am i and now so each one of these five senses of the body and the five senses of the spirit bringing good and evil to the mind remember that's where the battleground is romans 7 14 let's look at this this morning again i'm just just want to bring this teaching so that we many times the devil try to beat you up after you come through a meeting and and we've seen him do it haven't we and but it's not just here but he'll make you think that well it's just here but it's everywhere right now it's everywhere but but that's just satan i've seen it over and over and over again somebody get a real blessing from god somebody's family get a real blessing from god and satan will come right in and begin to attack the church attack the family attack the pastor attack the people why do they do that why does he do that and see if we recognize that we begin to fight yes if we don't recognize it we just give in well i guess i didn't get my healing and many people left brother branham's prayer line and had cancer and the spirit of the lord spoke to them and said if you believe it you can be healed told them what it was and they went home but the bill and felt worse they felt worse than what they felt before well i guess i didn't get it i guess there's no use going to church but see if they understood and brother brown would take time to explain it to him he said if you understand he said that cancer dies in the body he said when that spirit leaves it it becomes just a lump of flesh and has to purge itself out of the body you actually feel worse and if you and if you begin to doubt it'll come back seven times worse oh my and so we don't want to do that today we need to understand these things romans 7 and 14 paul says we know the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin now this is this is an important thing to understand this body's carnal yes amen sure it is carnal you got to protect yourself from yourself amen well i'm predestined brother ben i'll be oh no you've got to work paul said i keep under my body bring it under subjection list at any time i would be disapproved right i'm carnal verse 17 romans 7 15 for that which i do i allow not so in other words i'm not going to get sick i'm not going to get sick i'm going to believe i'm going to work i'm going to do the thing i'm going to be at church i'm going to live for god he finds yourself circumstances get in your way sicknesses get in the way say well there must be something wrong with me well that's just you you're human right that which i do i allow not not gonna get this well we had a lot of brave people when coveted first hits you know that's god the bride can't get it until they got it and then that changed well that quote where brother branham talks about it or whether in the scripture says i'll bring none of these diseases that strike the egyptians everybody's like praise god it's not going to hit me well i appreciate your faith but you know then it the story changed once people started getting it but the body's carnal you can get any cold including the coronavirus that's right and the cold is a coronavirus a certain type and so as far if i understand that correctly which my medical knowledge is very limited so i try not to give medical advice but what i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i now we're not talking now about going out in some kind of major sin we're talking about just everyday life paul's talking here as a christian not as an unbeliever as a christian i've got to overcome my body oh my he said now he said if then i do that which i would not i consent to the law that it is good so god's god's word is right he said now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh i love the way he qualifies that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not now again this doesn't give you an excuse and we'll go on and see where paul tells us we can overcome right we can live with god we can walk with god but but we can only do that by faith in the word now watch he said for the good that i would would i do not he said but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me so he said this is this is a law in other words it's always true any time you do good evil is present job is living his best life now yes to use a common phrase he's out there man health wealth and prosperity and doing so well and god has blessed him and and his family is doing good everybody's doing so well and and he's a believer he's a perfect man the bible says a perfect man and satan was still able to come before god and accuse job oh my why because evil is present it's the law it's where we live it's why we're here yes i'm gonna show you that in a moment in the message the lord helps me this morning to get through this now he said i find then a law when i would do good evil as present with me he said for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members he said oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death so he wasn't okay with it he wasn't making excuses he said who shall deliver me how can i overcome how can i do that we don't just use it as an excuse well my flesh you know commits adultery my flesh my flesh goes out and smokes cigarettes but it's not me i don't want to he said who shall deliver me there is a deliverance amen there is a control tower there is something that can take over and rule your life as you yield to it right so he said now o wretched man that i am but he said i thank god oh how many are thankful for jesus christ today i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind remember the random tells us that that mind he said it's the it's just it's the heart yes and if you go back to the original greek or that paul is writing in he's not talking about just thinking but the will my will my my heart my mind i serve the law of god that's the way a real christian is with my will you can tell where a person's will is at where their heart is that many of you that are watching this morning but your heart is to be in the house of god your heart is to do right but now with the flesh you serve the law of sin you get sick you have problems it's there oh my but the brandon has asked actually two different times what this means and in the first time the first time he's asked that that's when he explains about the mind i believe that's in 1959 and questions and answers but the one i'm going to read is from 1964. he's asked the same question what does this mean he's talking about paul he said in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other he said one right one wants me to do wrong the other one wants me to do and every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many times every time we all ought to be able to understand that right so you have a good meeting guess what's going to happen right we should just expect that you your son or daughter gets saved gets baptized guess what's going to happen the devil's going to do everything he can to keep you out of church because when you started coming to church god began to bless you and so what's the devil going to do he's going to try keeping you out that's what he does and again i'm not condemning you this morning but just to to help us understand this is the devil but god is greater than the devil he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world brother branham illustrates it in 1959 when in questions and answers when they talk he talks to him he says i didn't feel like coming to church today my throat was scratchy i was tired i was sick he said but then he said i said well i'll just let brother neville preach he said but he said i realized that was my flesh talking he said so i come here with my heart was to be with you people so he said i come here to my post of duty and he talked about how he had to hold on to the pulpit to preach but it was his supposed duty he was standing and why he was overcoming yes right and that's what you're doing this morning you're overcoming some of you're overcoming just by listening just by staying awake you're overcoming but praise god for that in whatever area you can overcome and do that beat that devil back defeat that devil come on of course he's going to fight you you got the different uniform on what do you expect you go out there with a different uniform you're going to get shot if you go out there in a war in the middle of a war zone you go out there with a ukrainian uniform and the russians see they're going to shoot you you go out there with an american uniform or a blue uniform in the civil war and the gray sees you they're going to shoot you wait what you should expect that you got a uniform on you've been baptized with the holy ghost you've been saved by the power of god when you're walking in this uniform he's going to take shots at you but you serve a greater god you got bigger weapons amen you've got god on your side you and god is the majority do we believe that today amen don't give in to him hallelujah so now you you know that you families know that every time you try to come to church one of the kids will get sick one of them will get hurt every time they're coming to church but jeremy knows what i'm talking about you start coming to church and every time if you're ever going to get aggravated at people for being late it's going to be sunday morning right well my wife and i take two separate vehicles and she's never late but she ain't as early as i am but you see that satan's gonna do that that's why you start preparing on saturday night i'm going to church tomorrow but it's just it's helping you to overcome but see it's faith that causes you to overcome now brother branham says this he says every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me he said you're an outward man which is controlled by six senses now he calls it six here it's it's five he's including faith this is the sixth senses he said you're an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and this faith disagrees with all six senses that the sixth sense doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other as long as the sixth sense is agree with the faith wonderful but when the sixth sense disagrees with faith leave the six senses alone right those body senses i had a chart somewhere i preached right past it i think but there's a you know there's the outside body there's there's five senses of that when it agrees with the word yeah that's all right sometimes we feel embarrassed say well yeah i felt too good about that must just be getting in the flesh was it the word i can't believe that person had shouted like that i can't believe they they danced in the spirit was it the word was it because of healing was it because of salvation see what was it about if they danced because somebody touched them there it is that's because a certain preacher touched them that's something different come on yes they danced because of the music that's something different we heard about that this weekend well we're not dancing over the music we're dancing because of the word the word is present so i think brother ron malevo my friend in the philippines for this this thing he brought this one up and i thought it was good but inside of inside there's a soul that soul is is only ruled by faith or doubt yeah right that that's your will you have the you have the ability to accept or reject anything that comes in your senses anything on the outside is all the things of the world all the things you hear all the things you smell all the things you see all the things you feel all the things you taste yeah you say well what does smell have to do with that and take the smallest one probably the most inconsequential one have you ever smelled something and it reminded you right because she smells sometimes works on your memory and your memory can work on your affection right you smelled something then you remember something you think oh god i wish i could forget that but it stays in your mind then maybe satan will arrange it so that you meet a certain person or you do a certain thing what's he trying to do but if it's not the word reject it yes that's why we don't you know it's possible in this outer realm to hear and to feel that you're in love with somebody who's not your wife or your husband it's possible even on that inner realm it's possible to have affection oh i'm in love what does the soul say what does the inner man say what does the word say right you don't go you don't stay married because of these two outer realms not as christians and that's why sometimes we we try to manage things we're managing the well i'm way off my notes this morning but we're we're managing the effects of an inner problem psychology works in this middle realm right it works in here and all it can do is affect that but that satan can use that anyway changing that inner realm it's not going to make you a believer right changing that in a realm it's not going to make you know it's got to be the soul there's got to be and there's got to be representation on the very inside of the inside that agrees with the word and when it does there's something inside of you that fights for the word amen and when that seed is awakened by the water of the holy spirit yes it begins to grow in your life and begins to take over it's dominant the seed is not oh god it does not lay back it's not a servant to the outer realm but the seed when it's watered by the holy spirit is dominant if you don't feel that in your life if you don't have that in your life you need to come back and get get washed again you need to come back and get filled refilled with the holy spirit because when you are yielding to the holy spirit that is dominant in your life you can't you can't think of anything or you can't do anything else it just controls you yes these other things come but you just can't make that decision what keeps you from doing that there but by the grace of god would i would go but the grace of god poured the holy ghost out on your soul to produce a dominant force a control tower in your life when that dominant force is not operating in our lives we need the holy ghost can we say amen to that this morning well how you saying boy i wish brother wendell was back this morning brother wendell preaches like it's in his church so i don't know about brother andrew but how don't you did you love the ministry this weekend i know i did i sat down here man i enjoyed that i enjoyed that thoroughly i what a blessing now brother brandon said that's the same thing he said the inside for instance he said jesus made a statement if you can find me again i'm sorry he said for instance now for instance here jesus made a statement oh you found it quick a promise he said the inside man says that that's true if jesus said something that's true he said the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you oh my he said then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man hallelujah he said now that's the same thing that paul is speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same he said that's the reason we have the troubles we do oh listen church why did i have to go through what i did because of those outer realms i'm married four or five times he said this that all kinds of sin and adulteries everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish you realize that can't even go to heaven you got to have a body change for you to go to heaven you wouldn't be you wouldn't be acceptable in heaven the way you are i wouldn't be acceptable in heaven the way i am i must have a body change but i'm so grateful there's one already waiting i'm not the sum of my mistakes i'm not the son of my outside man i'm not i'm not a reflection of what my what i've been through in the past but i'm a reflection of a word that was in god's mind a thought that was in his mind to become a word body and one day i'm going back to pick up that body yes sir good glory i'm never going to get through all this but i'll i'll quit when it's time to quit whenever that is he gonna let me know all right praise god for brother joel brother brown said we are carnal and that part must perish must perish but then inside we are a spirit man soul inside he said and that's faith in god's word now if you go back and you get greatest battle ever fought brother branham talks about the spirit being the inside man but random it just changes the terminology it doesn't change the teaching but it changes the terminology that's what most denominations teach this is the spirit is the inside man then the soul and the body but now brother branham in 1963 changes that and he changes it over to uh to body spirit and soul with the soul being on the inside now he said he said then we bring our outside body he said soul inside that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said he said how can i take a cockle burn make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it you're never going to make a grain of wheat out of the flesh yes sir the only way it can be wait he said well it's impossible but wait oh my it can have the life of the wheat yes or until like i said it's dominated by the holy ghost the only way it can be is because inside that cockapoo has been transmitted from a cocklebur wheat a cockapoor to a germ called wheat life he said then you bury that cocoa bear and it'll produce a grain of wheat glory because the shell is not what the life is glory all the shell shows is that one day there was another life but if you trans take the life out and put another life in it there's a new life and it's going to produce a new shell that ought to make some of you old people feel good my mom turned old this week and i won't say how old but that'll make her feel good i think she's left the building when you turn old it ought to make you feel good to know there's another body waiting amen that old cockleburst shell is rotting away but there's another body waiting he said and the life of the cocklebur has been taken out but the nature of the cocker bird is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed glory out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more huckleberry but wheat but while it's here on earth and a cockapoo it's still sticky that's why if you stay with one person long enough you're going to get sticky is that right brother joel you go on a trip with somebody sleep on some airport floors we're going to show that to you tonight and hopefully everybody be able to watch at least but but we uh we slept on some airport floors we didn't get to take a shower and we ended up ended up in egypt and in a place where we didn't realize there was no no air conditioning where we were going and it's quite hot and and you get two or three people actually there's four of us brothers that were there plus brother mcgalley and brother george the interpreter so six of us all kind of staying together we were just hanging out every day together i i won't deny that there was some stickiness you need to go on a mission trip sometimes there's some stickiness why is there stickiness because we're human i was so blessed to see all the different pastors saturday night in the meetings wasn't that wonderful see all the different pastors in the media so blessed to see that almost all the pastors in the area the ones that didn't come contacted me personally and said we wish we could have been there and all of them here in the meeting i was so blessed by that but you know why you know it gets sticky sometimes in the back rooms you get all the preachers i just love to put them all together but they're stickiness you see them on preachers yes why it's coco bear the outside of a preacher is still sticky sorry to disappoint you but it's true but on the on the inside there's a nature of a wheat if we could ever learn to look past the outside we could ever learn to get past this sickness and let the the power of the holy spirit so dominate our lives until we could begin to get along with one another oh my gosh he said now he said he said as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live he said but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has got from you now i'm going to get on something sticky here for a minute this is an important i gotta i wanted to read all of it but i won't brother brown talks about the indians and he talks about a black dog and a white dog and during that time it's very important brother joel to understand this properly there's a there's a i've even got a picture praise god i told my daughter i'm going to have a picture of dogs where's that she is back there i see after i got a picture dog in there fighting that looks like our two dogs our two dogs can't stand each other they got that woof nature still in them we got two dogs that do not get along and they're both just so sweet act so sweet when they're but as soon as food comes out they start attacking each other it's like preachers over a pulpit you know just just going at each other so the the black dog and the white dog can't get along right now brother branham said they asked the chief said chief which one of them wins the fight which one wins the fight said that depends on which one chief feeds the most he gets big and strong maybe we ought to try that i want him dogs take over the other dog he gets big and strong yeah the one you feed the most see if you feed the black dog hollywood all week and then you come sit in the church bless me preacher why is the preacher able to get under the anointing and sometimes the people aren't yeah well it's because the preacher knows or he should know he's got a responsibility to get a get out of those things and come under the holy spirit and so he spends part of but what kind of a church could we have if people would understand if i just quit feeding the black dog if i quit feeding my prejudices if i quit feeding my my my crisis if i could quit feeding my worries and my fears and my unforgiveness if i just let it go what would that do to the white dog he'd begin to grow he began to get bigger and be able to overcome he said it depends on which one he feeds the most amen amen he said so i think that's a good answer here there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you think about the warring of the body that's in you depends on which one you feed how you respond to that prayer line think about it yeah now you go from there but you've been fed under the atmosphere and you felt good but now you're going next week oh i'm sick i feel bad feel worse oh it must have been a mistake no you need to start feeding that white dog again you fed him during the meetings feed him at home feed him when you wake up in the morning feed him when you go to bed at night think on these things amen feed him he wants to be fed i told you it's dangerous territory feeling amen now this is not for the unconverted wish i could pound that down because many times unconverted people even our children they'll try to take this and when they really haven't had an experience with god they'll try to take to say well by psychology i'll come in and i'll just reject all these things that are wrong by the word you can't do it without the holy spirit because that dominating force hasn't been awakened and you will fail a hundred times out of a hundred unless you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you've got to have the baptism of the holy ghost in your life or you will fail in in doing these things but it's for the converted man how do we know that romans 8 and 1. just the next verse he said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right now in order to be born again are you still with me this morning i got just a few more minutes and we'll we'll close now he said there is therefore now no condemnation now in order to be born again you must have representation in heaven representation how do you contact heaven now remember there there were many priests in jesus time that could not contact heaven they could not accept that he was god in flesh they couldn't see it so they come up with all kinds of theories they said he's beelzebub he's a good man he's a teacher whatever it is that they come up with but they could not see who he really was but there was a woman in a city of samaria called psychar she was down there by herself she didn't have any advantages at all but she heard the word one time on the side of a well yes and what did she do she said shirley you must be a prophet and she said when messiah comes oh my how did she get that revelation because inside of her brother random explains it in future home he said inside of her there was representation the priest didn't have that but she had representation oh my now look now there's representation that has to be there in second corinthians 5 and 1 he said we know that if our earthly house our our cuckleber be dissolved if our earthly house of this tabernacle this tent or dissolved well that's the kind of tent doctrine i believe in this tent's gonna be done away with yes oh my i'm gonna take off the old coat put on anew he said if this tent were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens if this tent is dissolved this temporary dwelling is dissolved we have an eternal dwelling a permanent dwelling on the other side think about it look at the language he uses if this tent is dissolved we have a building very bad a house not made with hands now brother branham calls this a word body or a theophany that's what's waiting in the heavens and we we're then now with the resurrection we're given another kind of body glorified body at the rapture and resurrection so we can live here and reign with the on earth for a thousand years now now paul talks about that body he said the first man is of the earth earthy of the earth earthy that's who we are it's no wonder we don't feel good yeah right the earth is cursed but divine healing what is divine healing it's just an earnest of permanent health you will get healed you could get healed and get sick five minutes later but it's just in earnest amen there is a body waiting in the heavens glory aren't you glad for that today oh if you lost your loved ones if you if you're in pain or worried because of the things that have happened you say well so many have gone on but remember they've just taken on their new body oh god they were earthy now they're heavenly he said such are they also that are heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly yes verse 50 he said now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot someone say cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed what is it to take on this new house yes what did paul say we have one already waiting not going to be any you know they used to say they used to say an old hole in this church said well i don't want my mansion to go empty they built it for me all these years and then i backslide all these empty mansions god don't do things like that well i guess they'll use my material on somebody else's mansion now he's talking about tabernacles whether branham explained that to us and things that are to be tabernacles we have many tabernacles he has many tabernacles he's built them he's prepared them for us and in those tabernacles those tabernacles are is our bodies that we go to dwell in he has many kinds of bodies that we go to dwell in so i believe what you what you represent here you'll represent there i'm sorry for some of us but you know that don't look as good as some others but but there is a tabernacle that god wanted us for some reason to be this way amen praise god now look he said he he said we will be changed now everyone that has ears can hear the word right you hear it but brother ben you said faith comes by hearing that's how i contact heaven at home so if i hear a tape if i hear a preacher i should be able to have faith then and go home everyone that has ears natural ears can hear the word but it takes spiritual ears yes to hear from your theophany that's right everyone who has a spirit consents the emotions of his presence that's right yes sir yeah sometimes you can look at me and watch me preach or watch brother joel or watch these other ministers brother stewart or allen and we get under the anointing and we when we get under that our our emotions change you get very emotional sometimes under under the anointing of god and you'll see that and you see that emotion and you you partake in that you can partake in that and not be a child of god i've seen many people partaking that emotion and worship sometimes you'll see people come and they'll worship among us oh it's so wonderful and you look at their life and say how could could they possibly keep living like they do after being after being in his presence like that well it's just they've never there's not been anything ever strike that seed if there is one right but in you there's been a seed stroke so you're not just getting in the emotion of the preacher but yes you can sense it you can feel it and i don't care who you are when a preacher really gets under the anointing you say amen better i think sometimes we need to quit hollering at the people and start hollering at the preachers it's not the people's fault for not saying amen most time it's our fault because we don't show that we we that it matters to us that's true of singers by the way as well sometimes we don't show you know we ought to run that through our brain say i'm saved bless god brother ben i'm saved i don't even know how to do a deadpan really bless god i'm saved well that's wonderful but do you really believe it see if i was really worried about my child yeah oh god and they were going over the cliff going down the river and i knew there was a waterfall out in front of them and they were going over and i and there was my child i was concerned about them i wouldn't waste i would take all of my effort all of my strength all my emotion everything that i had to go get them to scream at them there's a there's a fall there's cataracts up ahead people say well it's just emotion sure it is but god is using that emotion yes sir oh god to be the voice of many waters calling you to christ oh he can't do that why can't he hearing's by the word of god god uses hearing god uses emotion but you got to watch because every emotion is not from god sure everyone who has a spirit can sense the emotions of his presence why are they not all born again now jesus was the son of god but he came first as a theophany let's get into that for just a moment before we leave he said now the different difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and in morphy body he came in and lived in that in the person of melchizedek there should be no question about who melchizedek is after brother brown gets done preaching who is this melchizedek he was jesus christ he said then later we never heard no more melchizedek because he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypassed that because in that form he knew all things and you have never been able to know that yet right oh praise god that gives me comfort brother danny none of us have ever been able to know all things right not even peter peter you don't know all things i got a quote for it the other quote he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet we ought to get off our high horse shouldn't we you come like adam like me oh my he wasn't jesus christ he was a man brother branham was a man jesus was god in flesh but the branham tabernacled god in flesh just like we do but jesus was the fullness of the godhead he said you come like adam like me like you can't become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted to be tempted this week is why you're here are you hearing me now the the meetings are wonderful it's a taste it's an earnest of heaven but this week is why you're here you came to be tempted oh god if we just recognize that he said well if god was better to me if he treated my family better if i could feel that emotion all the time if i if i could sense his presence all the time listen you came to be tempted there's going to be times he withdraws his presence from you there's going to be times he'll make you work for it there's gonna be times he wants to hear you cry but you don't quit crying you keep crying you keep believing you don't quit believing you keep believing when the going gets tough hey man the tough get going do you believe it this morning hey man he said to be tempted but when this life is finished here oh my this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word he said then we can look back and see what we've done he said now we don't understand it i wish we could brother ben i have to understand it we don't understand it because we were not born in a word body first come on now but the man explained it to me to my satisfaction i can't do that but you got to have faith we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but look clearly it makes it clear he said you'll never be the word i love this unless you was a thought at the beginning sometimes you say i speak without thinking that's actually impossible you thought about you might have thought about a long time ago you might come out and said you jerk oh i didn't think before i said that you thought about it at some point oh i'm going to get myself in trouble i'm sorry honey i didn't mean to say that i just wasn't thinking about it well at some point he was because it's literally impossible for a word to be expressed without a thought behind it but what a powerful thought that that is you had to be in the thinking oh my that's how you existed by the way brother branham taught us that those those souls that we existed we shouted for joy in god's mind but the random said we we did that in his mind right we existed that's the we don't believe in the pre-existence of souls like mormons we shouted in god's mind right we had to be a thought before we could become a word right glory amen you can't be the word and i don't know again because i don't know all things i wasn't in that fee off anybody i don't know what i've done or where i've been but i know this i came to earth and one day oh my i heard from something from the past are you hearing me now i heard the thought that had been expressed in a body see when jesus thought about you he didn't quit just thinking about you you were a thought then you were a word yeah think about it you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking he said but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand oh my i love that if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me if you stand the temptation if you stand the trial and you will if you're a seed of god right yes sir if you stand all the fathers give me will come to me and i'll raise him up at the last days see you had to be first yes glory you had to exist in your current body first in order to be tempted he said and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on the lamb's book of life he said then from that he became the word the theophany that could appear disappear then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition you realize jesus already has his glorified body yes he's a he's an intercessor for you and i he's a real person today yes sir oh my he already has his glorified body he resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin he said and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of god that's what quickens at church that's what we can't do without when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god hallelujah he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot sin in romans 8 and 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking if i cou he said just get in christ it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's it's not some kind of psychology it's the seed being awakened by the spirit it's the only way the seed can be awakened is by the spirit of the word watch it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism you are a new creation in christ your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life he said like you women claiming you've got the holy ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of god in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly it can't be it's not a filthy spirit he's a holy spirit i know that maybe some of the folks in egypt are watching some of those that understand english or can translate and i want you to understand this morning that you can't have the holy spirit and go against the word because he is the spirit of the word oh my he is the spirit of the lord and that's something we had to deal with while we were there because the people were baptized as babies into the church and they felt that the filth the holy spirit on their emotions they felt a real holy spirit and i explained to one sister i said yes that that's what you feel that's real yeah but it doesn't mean you've been sealed away there's more for you there's some there's a time you can come to in the holy spirit the token seals your life yes you felt the holy spirit in justification and sanctification but now he wants to fill you with his holy spirit amen he wants to wake up that seed he wants to make it lit come live in you now watch it throws your whole being subject to the spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world what is the spirit am i boring you this morning i hope not i'll quit before i bore people i'm getting close aren't i that spirit what is the spirit of god i'm just teaching this morning so you just hang with me but brother and i said i'm gonna have a sunday school lesson three hours later you know he said the spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifester quickened the spirit is you can't separate them well i'm gonna have the word not the spirit you can't do it right it's true if you get the real word you'll have the spirit that's right you can't separate those two that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quick and made alive oh my oh my and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because oh god it's already started glory it was once subject to sin a mire and corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture glory what do you tell that man said i went down here and they told me the child went down here and they told me to speak in tongues he said but one day you were walking this way one day you turned around began walking this way he said you've already got it what is it that thing that made you turn what made you turn you got the earnest it turned heavenly hey man keep feeding that keep building that amen keep believing that hallelujah hey man i'm going to skip past ephesians 2. you can go read that later ephesians 2 1-7 oh my he's raised us up together he's quickened us now brother branham tells this eagle story y'all remember the eagle story maybe the kids don't don't haven't heard it but it's a story where he tells about a farmer that took a an eagle an egg from an eagle's nest from my mama eagle we had to do that when the mama was gone didn't he she was going to get some food and he come in and stole the nest stole the egg he comes in and while the egg's still warm he puts it under a chicken and under that atmosphere it hatches now the eagle is an odd eagle let's say oh duck but that's not don't fit he's an odd bird because he's bigger than the rest of them he probably trips and falls more than they do because they're little denominational chickens you know they're able to just go and fill this committee and do this and you know they just they just love it you know they're doing their little works that's what they were born to do nothing wrong with that let them do their works but this one was an eagle he wasn't born to run around scratch around the barnyard he wasn't born to go around joining this committee in that committee he was born to worship the lord designed of the heavenlies he was born to receive the word of the hour and so he's there and he begins to grow and he's just eating food with the rest of them he don't know no different but one day mama eagle knows she had another egg because she counted every one of them and she knew that she left them somewhere and so she begins to fly over the barnyard and she begins to scream because she knows that faith comes by hearing and if her little eagle is anywhere there on the ground or behind he may have been born he may be there as an eagle but he don't know he's an eagle but as soon as he hears the scream faith comes to him yes and he begins to realize that's me right amen i've heard from something i i i recognize something now listen the little eagle maybe it's too young to scream like that he's never heard anybody scream like that he doesn't know anything about that he he can't do it himself but the potentials are in him to do it hallelujah and so he because he has those potentials he recognizes a scream that he's never screamed but yet he recognizes that something more i'm different yes oh my oh my she screams she comes over he says mama what shall i do she said just jump up on that fence post boy you need to get in the meeting and hear the word of god you need to get in church you may not be flying yet but you just need to sit under the word for a while listen to the scream jump up on the post get the faith together then begin to flap your wings you begin to exercise your faith you begin to get rid of all the things of the world and begin to begin to walk with god begin to exercise after a while the same wings that are carrying her is going to carry you all right why because you were an eagle to begin with brother brown said his grandpa and grandma were eagles he was the eagle all the way back eagle don't mix with other things he's not a hybrid at all he's an eagle then after you recognize the very word of god with eagle food you left the other thing you have been been formed into the living image of the living god listen you heard from your theophany hallelujah i recognize that you've made contact by faith with your heavenly home yes listen we don't ignore our senses that would be foolish right all right it'll be foolish if you could ignore your senses you you get burned you get hurt you don't ignore your senses god gave those to you but if they're against the word you ignore them he said he said if you're in christ now listen we don't reject emotion we only reject that emotion which produces a life contrary to the word if you're in christ there's not a word written in here he said but what you believe it i don't care what anybody else said right and then god makes that thing manifested he said because when he pours the spirit upon the word what happens just like putting water on any other seed it'll live it'll bring forth of its kind when he pours the spirit it'll bring forth of its kind don't you feed the spirit in a meeting oh god i wish i could explain this to you the spirit in a prayer line will bring seeds good seed out of where that good seed is it'll bring bad seed out of where the bat the same spirit will will also make the tares grow he said brother ben we don't want tears let's stop the rain go look and see how that's working for the farmers they want rain everyone texts me this morning we need the rain we need the rain oh oh church if we could only recognize i'm i'm going to close i'm just going to stop and close but if you only could recognize we need the rain we need the rain oh my we need it you say i got the baptism the holy ghost he says that i don't mean you're saved not by the long ways see because it's what the rain falls on you're a trying being he explains that you got five senses go to the next quote and you've got five senses he said he said they don't contact the rest of it you've got five senses of the spirit he said but in here is where you live that's what you are didn't jesus say the rain falls on the just and the unjust put a cocker bear out here and wheat out there pour water on them keep them under fertilized and things like that won't they both live by the same water sure well what is it one of them will bear kuckleberg because that's all he is don't get discouraged by that church don't get discouraged by those who don't live it don't get discouraged by those who have emotions but never for have a christian life but be encouraged by the power of god working in your life what is it he said one of them will bear a coca bread that's all he is the cluckleberry will raise his hands and shout just the same as the wheat but if you have no grip no rain you have no growth not of the cockaburr and not of the weed you talk you talked about having an anointing calf has had an anointing balaam had an anointing i don't have anything to do with the inside he said unless that was god's seed is gene from the beginning you're finished i don't care how much you shout speak with tongues and run has nothing to do with it cocober can count just as much as any of the rest of them i've seen heathens raise and shout speaking tongues drink blood out of a human skull he said so you don't any of them sensations and things forget it it's your heart in that word yes oh god that's christ bring in there watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself laodicea i'm here amen it declares itself for the age it's living in amen brother brad was teaching this as he goes down to the end of his ministry as i'm coming down at the end of this sermon musicians go ahead and come should say musician go ahead and come you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell what's he driving home it's not the rain that makes you what you are you're a seed of god whether you feel the rain or not you're a seed of god oh i hope that sinks down deep in your heart he said look here you're an outside person you have five senses contact your body that god gave you not to contact him your earthly home you have a spirit on the inside of it it has five outlets you contact the spirit world you said your physical context is physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that gene that comes from god like a baby formed in his mother's womb when the baby comes into the mother's womb by the little germ it crawls into the egg it doesn't form one cell a human the next the dog the next cat and the next the horse it's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell and when a man has been born again by the word of god predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be word of god on top of word amen let me believe that this morning amen the word preached did not profit many in the old testament why because it was not mixed with faith listen only the thought of god in you can respond to the thought of god expressed in the word you ever thought about that it's the thought of god in you that responds to the thought of god expressed in the word listen bethlehem was full of people go ahead and start playing something i got more notes but we're gonna quit bethlehem was full of people when jesus was born full of people tax collectors jews gentiles romans all kinds an innkeeper was there who actually physically saw them there may have been others there may have been many they were stable which was probably a cave like on the hillside there may have been people who heard god cry think about it for the first time in human flesh they heard god in human flesh cry say god can't do that you underestimate god they heard jehovah crying in the manger all right oh god they said it ain't him it ain't him they didn't think nothing about it how does god reveal himself to you now look he has to reach us by our five senses sometimes that's why it's so important that we entertain him what brother wendell said on sunday morning why do we come early to church why do we set a certain atmosphere in the services why do we want the spirit of god always moving in our midst we don't want nothing to hinder that and i appreciate you all for for keeping that atmosphere right i appreciate it so much we have deacons and things and and people and trustees in the church just to keep that burden off of me to where where i can think about heavenly things most of the time and i'm so thankful for that why do we work so hard for that because we want to entertain him when he comes we want to we'll make him feel welcome when he's here his brother window preached sunday morning now they did not entertain him the innkeeper didn't entertain him the other people in the city didn't entertain him but there were some shepherds on a hillside amen they kept their flocks by night the lowliest of the low oh that gives me hope today the lowliest of the law were on the hillside but they had been foreordained by god to to come and worship at the feet of jesus now think about it they were predestined to do that how was he going to reach them so if they were the word they'd just know that's not how he did it think about it he sent messengers and a light shone round about them have you never heard the christmas story think about it light shone around about them they were in the fields and he used sight he used sound the angel singing they heard the words that they were singing and they heard the commandment of the angel what did he do he used the five senses don't reject that if it comes from god but the word was inside of him he said brother ben how will i know if it's the truth because the word is inside of you the word is not just on printed page the word is inside of you the thoughts of god this has been translated you say oh but i can't trust it because it's been translated why can you trust it because the word is not just here the word is here they knew it was true not because they were the greatest students in the land and they said glory to god in the highest and the angels come and they felt they had a wonderful meeting they said that's god he's fulfilling his word let's take the journey down to bethlehem let's go down into town we don't care what people think about us we want to entertain him we want to make him feel welcome brother brandon said a man that believes in god can see the presence of god feel the presence of god over brother branham those are five senses a man that believes that sick sins has been activated can see the presence of god feel the presence of god sense the presence of god and no he's here he is here do you believe that this morning to answer everything that he made promise for in this day then cry till you get it yes don't give up church i see some i watch people in services and they'll sip in and then you lose them and they slip in and then you lose them and sometimes you get to a part that they really need and as a pastor and your your senses are heightened when you preach i can't explain that but it just is you tighten and you begin to watch people sip in and they slip out and you watch that sometimes because we preach too long but when that happens you watch that and i think satan's trying to keep you you're bringing that tired spirit through your senses maybe there's kids interrupting you not meeting this morning but maybe at home satan's using them five cents much harder to stream than it is to come to church because when you're streaming it's harder to get anything out of it because you've got all these other distractions and you're sitting there on facebook right now listening to me but not watching typing something huh you about it man i can't believe he knew that well it's just the way we are human senses oh god but if you just activate that faith stay with it cry until you get it don't stop at a meeting don't say well we had our good meeting that does it for the year let's just over go on vacation now and and it's wonderful you can go on vacation i go on vacation everybody does but listen we got to keep working we got to keep moving we got to keep our shoulders to the wheel keep our swords in the battle while we're being shot at we might as well shoot back the devil's firing his fiery darts you might as well take the word the sword of the spirit and fight back against him amen do you believe it today brother branham told the story about the little boy he said a little boy asked his mother said can a man see god he said i don't know go ask your pastor he goes ask the pastor or the sunday school teacher first he went to her did a man see god he said i don't know ask the pastor can a man see god the pastor began to explain it in some intellectual way the little boy just wasn't satisfied one morning he went fishing early in the morning probably as early as we did the other morning brother isaac went fishing went out early in the morning they got out just out by the by the ocean where they were fishing right by the edge of it and they watched the sun begin to come up and tears began to stream down the old fisherman's face and a little boy just was moved to ask the question again he said can a man see god he said for 70 years all i've seen is god why his five senses were tuned to the sixth sense oh god i wish i had time to explain it today but i believe you get it i believe you're the word you can receive the word entertain his presence recognize him when he shows himself tune your five senses to be able to see and to hear and to feel and to smell and to taste the presence of god heavenly father we welcome you today we thank you for being with us lord i know it was a long sermon but i just had so much on my heart after the meetings and the wonderful job the brothers did preaching and i saw the people receive many things but the devil's fighting today he's fighting this little church fighting other churches doing everything he can to try to keep us out of where we ought to be lord we reject that today in the name of the lord we believe lord that you are able to come and fill us so with the holy spirit we can we can rejoice in you even when the times are rough we can claim victory over sickness and over disease lord even those that are in their homes this morning i pray or there would be a special blessing on them maybe they're fighting fever something the devil's trying to tell them something about it and lord you are the god that heals all of our diseases today we're so thankful for that the same god that was in the prayer line is here right now it's in their living room right now able to touch them to heal them by the spoken word of god we believe it today we trust you and we thank you for all that you do what you're doing every day in our midst thank you for this church lord thank you for these people who work so hard to make others comfortable lord during the meetings i i pray a special blessing on them lord and a special courage and an assurance sort of faith that they would know that you're with them we pray they feel your presence and know you and sense that you're here we pray in jesus name amen amen the lord will come in this way holy spirit thou art welcome oh could you stand and raise your hands today just entertain him welcome him when he goes the holy spirit will
