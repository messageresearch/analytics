[1:04:13] Faith Lord we thank you Father

[1:04:19] something about each Lord that you've
[1:04:21] called us Lord oh yes and Lord You've
[1:04:24] appointed This Time Lord that we don't
[1:04:27] believe anybody is here by accident Lord
[1:04:30] but we believe it's a predestinated Time
[1:04:33] father that Lord before the foundation
[1:04:35] of the world you saw us you knew the day
[1:04:37] we'd be living in you knew the hour we'd
[1:04:39] be living in you knew the conditions of

[1:04:42] have us all here this morning to worship

[1:04:48] would bless each one in the divine
[1:04:51] presence this morning I ask you oh God

[1:04:55] we just pray you would bless our hearts
[1:04:57] to receive it father and our ears to
[1:05:00] hear it and Lord God that you would
[1:05:02] watch over this service I pray you'd
[1:05:04] bind my lips before I'd speak anything
[1:05:06] unpleasing to you and we'll commit it
[1:05:08] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[1:05:14] God bless you all and I want to take a
[1:05:16] text this morning or a title of
[1:05:18] everything in the land belongs to
[1:05:21] you everything in the land belongs to
[1:05:25] you now I'm going to read you this quote
[1:05:26] here before we get going brother
[1:05:27] brandham said in the way of a true
[1:05:29] prophet of God he said when as I said
[1:05:32] Abraham he was in the promised land God
[1:05:36] gave it to him lot was taken by some
[1:05:38] Renegade Outlaws took away that was his
[1:05:41] nephew all right and everything was in
[1:05:44] that land belonged to Abraham so he
[1:05:47] wasn't a warrior he never did fight he
[1:05:50] didn't have any warriors with him he had
[1:05:53] some servants but when he seen that
[1:05:55] something the devil had come and robbed
[1:05:58] him of something that was promised to
[1:06:00] him he armed his servants and he took an
[1:06:02] arm himself and he didn't know how he
[1:06:05] was going to overcome this whole company
[1:06:06] of Kings just a handful of servants but
[1:06:10] God told him how to do it and he divided
[1:06:12] himself and slaughtered the Kings and
[1:06:14] came back triumphant why he laid his
[1:06:17] faith upon God's promise that everything
[1:06:20] that was in the land belonged to
[1:06:22] him right everything that was in the
[1:06:25] land was his and lot was a part of it
[1:06:28] that's right that was a part of the land
[1:06:30] oh my and here he met mezic after the
[1:06:33] battle was over could you just see
[1:06:35] Abraham coming up the road he didn't
[1:06:37] know he was a warrior but he knew he was
[1:06:40] then and yes sir and he met the one who
[1:06:42] gave the promise MDC so Saints we find
[1:06:46] here that the prophet of God said that
[1:06:48] Abraham was minding his own business on
[1:06:50] the plains of mamry he was minding his
[1:06:53] own business to sending to his sheep and
[1:06:55] then the enemy came in and he took lot
[1:06:57] out of Sodom and that's where he messed
[1:06:59] up right there because lot was a part of
[1:07:02] Abraham and everything that was in that
[1:07:04] land belonged to Abraham can you say
[1:07:06] Amen this morning and so those kings
[1:07:09] came in and they took lot away captive
[1:07:11] now I'll tell you Saints looking at it
[1:07:13] from a carnal standpoint lot probably
[1:07:16] deserved everything that he was getting
[1:07:19] right he probably deserved it all
[1:07:21] because look he'd been down there in
[1:07:23] Sodom he went down took the easy way and
[1:07:25] he' been held captive down there and we
[1:07:27] find that he was in a bad situation now
[1:07:29] what brother brandham goes on he says in
[1:07:31] the world God's word calls for a total
[1:07:33] separation for unbelief he said all
[1:07:36] these Believers we could go on for hours
[1:07:38] all these were like a bunch of change
[1:07:41] out of your pocket in God's hands he
[1:07:43] says you pull out a bunch of change and
[1:07:45] there's pennies and nickels and dimes
[1:07:48] and quarters and half dollars and
[1:07:50] dollars all in coins he said now that's
[1:07:52] what the world is in in God's hand and
[1:07:55] there's some people that can just have a
[1:07:57] Penny's worth of it and God can only use
[1:08:00] them in a penny way now listen to what
[1:08:03] the prophet says he said that's all they
[1:08:05] can buy don't reject them brother Bram
[1:08:09] said there some of them is pennies don't
[1:08:11] reject them God can only use them in a
[1:08:13] penny way and he said if they can't
[1:08:15] believe the real truth don't turn them
[1:08:18] down don't kick them out and say they're
[1:08:21] not in it because God uses pennies
[1:08:25] sometimes and lot was just a penny and
[1:08:28] Abraham was a silver dollar so it took a
[1:08:30] hundred lots to make an Abraham and so
[1:08:33] will it take a hundred carnal Believers
[1:08:36] listen to this chains 100 carnal
[1:08:38] Believers will never stand in the
[1:08:41] presence of a genuine Christian that's
[1:08:44] separated from the carnal things of the
[1:08:46] world living in Christ Jesus were on the
[1:08:49] word where the word can flow through
[1:08:52] them All Saints it's got to be our goal
[1:08:56] this morning it's not our goal to be a
[1:08:59] lot today it's not our goal to be a
[1:09:01] carnal believer today it's got to be our
[1:09:04] goal to be an Abraham and to be
[1:09:07] separated from the carnal things of the
[1:09:09] world so that the word of God can flow
[1:09:12] through US Saints and in order for the
[1:09:14] word to flow through us we got to be
[1:09:17] separated from the carnal things of the
[1:09:20] world now that's got to be our prayer
[1:09:22] Saints Lord Jesus separate me from the
[1:09:26] carnal things of this world Amen now see
[1:09:30] carnal don't always mean sinful caral
[1:09:33] can be just worldly ISM Saints and I'll
[1:09:35] tell you it's it I'm I'm not just
[1:09:38] standing for me today I'm standing for
[1:09:41] my family and I'm standing for my church
[1:09:44] and I'm standing for my brothers and
[1:09:45] sisters and I'm standing for this
[1:09:48] message I'm standing today Saints I'm
[1:09:52] standing I'm standing standing for my
[1:09:54] children I'm standing for my loved ones
[1:09:56] I'm standing not just for
[1:09:58] myself amen so I've got to be separated
[1:10:02] from the carnal things of the world so

[1:12:32] the things of this world Saints this
[1:12:34] ain't no time to let the world creep
[1:12:37] into our home it ain't no time to let
[1:12:40] the world creep into our churches or let
[1:12:42] the world creep into our lives Saints
[1:12:45] it's a time to separates it ain't no
[1:12:48] time to have one foot in the world and
[1:12:50] another foot in the
[1:12:51] church it's a Time to separate choose
[1:12:55] this day who you will
[1:12:57] serve oh it's hard preaching this
[1:12:59] morning
[1:13:01] Sint but Saints listen we got no time
[1:13:05] now I'm not talking about separating
[1:13:07] from Brotherhood we got we got too much
[1:13:08] of that right on I'm not talking about
[1:13:11] separating from fellowship we don't need
[1:13:12] none of that right I'm talking about
[1:13:15] separation from the things of the world
[1:13:18] Amen and it feels like sometimes that we
[1:13:22] are losing this back battle against
[1:13:24] worldism in this
[1:13:27] message now now I I now look I believe
[1:13:30] in com as you are but I don't believe in
[1:13:32] staying as you
[1:13:34] are I believe everybody is welcome to
[1:13:36] the house of the Lord I mean I don't
[1:13:39] believe any child is born knowing how to
[1:13:41] walk you got to learn how to walk amen
[1:13:44] you're not born knowing amen and you
[1:13:46] can't punish a child for falling down
[1:13:49] when he's trying to learn to
[1:13:50] walk amen but if he is 20 years old and
[1:13:54] they still don't know how to
[1:13:55] walk something's wrong is that right
[1:13:59] Saints amen so so I don't believe in and
[1:14:02] staying like you are I believe we all
[1:14:04] should be getting better I believe every
[1:14:07] church every service I should draw a
[1:14:09] little closer to
[1:14:10] God I believe I should be a better man
[1:14:13] tomorrow than I am today I believe I
[1:14:16] should be a better Christian tomorrow
[1:14:17] than I am do you believe that today
[1:14:19] Saints I want to be getting better I
[1:14:22] don't want to stay the same I don't want
[1:14:23] to backslide I want to get
[1:14:28] better
[1:14:30] amen and it's no time to be joined with
[1:14:34] the things of the world but it seems
[1:14:36] like we've let off of crying out against
[1:14:39] it
[1:14:40] anymore but the message cries out
[1:14:43] against it the message doesn't tolerate
[1:14:46] it so neither should we
[1:14:48] Saints amen we should stand for
[1:14:51] something this message is a
[1:14:54] standard sir amen but it seems like in
[1:14:59] the message the clothes keep getting
[1:15:02] Tighter and the dress keeps getting more
[1:15:05] immodest and the paint keeps getting
[1:15:08] thicker and it seems like the men not
[1:15:11] just in the message but in the world
[1:15:13] today especially in America keep getting
[1:15:16] more and more
[1:15:20] feminine now there's an image that the
[1:15:22] world has of what a man should be right
[1:15:25] and that's a
[1:15:28] jellyfish but that's not the image that
[1:15:30] God's word has that a man should
[1:15:34] be see a man should stand for something
[1:15:37] Saints a man should stand for his family
[1:15:41] A man should be able to do the right
[1:15:42] thing whether he wants to do it or
[1:15:45] not amen a man should be able to handle
[1:15:48] a tough decision and not put it off on
[1:15:50] his wife to make it amen on now that I'm
[1:15:53] just telling you this ain't popular but
[1:15:55] the world they don't want to hear this
[1:15:57] but we're not in the world Saints and
[1:16:00] men should be men brother BR said give
[1:16:02] me a backbone like a
[1:16:06] solo
[1:16:08] amen but men today have gotten soft to
[1:16:11] the point they can't control their own
[1:16:13] flesh with their own desires and just
[1:16:16] anything goes Saints and they want to
[1:16:19] cow down and and stay at home and send
[1:16:22] their wife to work
[1:16:25] oh
[1:16:30] God but Saints men should be men yes sir
[1:16:34] amen and I I don't care what the world
[1:16:35] thinks I should be I want to be what God
[1:16:37] thinks I should be amen I'll tell you sa
[1:16:40] sister Brandy SI Sister Moore don't want
[1:16:43] me to sit around talking to her about my
[1:16:44] feelings all the
[1:16:47] time come on she don't want to hear all
[1:16:50] that she wants me to deal with it and
[1:16:54] provide amen that's come
[1:16:58] on oh my come on but the message cries
[1:17:02] out against these things of the world so
[1:17:05] we should cry out against them too amen
[1:17:08] Saints I'll tell you it ain't no time in
[1:17:11] this day and time to let a ball game or
[1:17:13] a TV program or some worldly
[1:17:15] entertainment keep aside of the house of
[1:17:17] the
[1:17:19] Lord when a ball game gets to be more
[1:17:22] important and comeing of the house of
[1:17:23] the Lord there's a problem somewhere
[1:17:25] Saints amen when a program you're too
[1:17:28] tired to come on Wednesday but you're
[1:17:30] not too tired to watch something on the
[1:17:34] TV God's word calls for separation from
[1:17:37] those things amen now unconditional
[1:17:41] Covenant brother Brown said God wants
[1:17:42] separators separate yourself that's
[1:17:45] right God always calls for separation
[1:17:48] separate from your Associates separate
[1:17:51] from your habits separate from from
[1:17:53] everything and come out and stand alone
[1:17:55] for God Amen that's where the first man
[1:17:58] was called by election that's where the
[1:18:00] last man's been called to do the same
[1:18:02] thing separate yourself from your
[1:18:04] Associates the things of the world come
[1:18:06] out from among them and be ye separate
[1:18:08] now how many of you in here say I want a
[1:18:13] blessing he
[1:18:15] said he said be be ye separate he said
[1:18:18] then I'll bless you if you want a
[1:18:21] blessing separate yourself from the
[1:18:24] things of the world now that's a direct
[1:18:26] quote yes sir amen now he said he said
[1:18:30] these things and we find people many
[1:18:32] times that that we we look at it and
[1:18:34] think well maybe there's a problem in
[1:18:35] the message Saints there's no problem
[1:18:38] with the
[1:18:39] message the message is right the message
[1:18:42] is God's word amen the message isn't the
[1:18:46] problem what we we don't have a message
[1:18:48] problem we got a we got a perfect
[1:18:50] message we don't have a message problem
[1:18:52] what we got is a the Holy Ghost problem
[1:18:54] yeah right see somewhere along the line
[1:18:57] somebody got the idea that you just
[1:18:59] believe the message and you got it well
[1:19:02] believing the message ain't the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost Saints see I believe the message
[1:19:07] before I got the Holy
[1:19:09] Ghost amen but sometime you find people
[1:19:12] that'll be seeking the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:14] somebody's talking to them saying well
[1:19:15] well don't you believe the
[1:19:18] message now that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:19:23] now brother Bram said this at Valley
[1:19:24] full of ditches he said that's what's
[1:19:26] the matter with the Pentecostal church
[1:19:28] tonight now you say well I'm not
[1:19:30] Pentecostal s I'll tell you you better
[1:19:32] be
[1:19:33] Pentecostal amen now I'm not talking
[1:19:35] about Pentecostal by denomination I'm
[1:19:37] talking about Pentecostal like I got an
[1:19:39] experience like I was there when
[1:19:42] something changed in my life like I was
[1:19:44] there when God filled
[1:19:46] me not Pentecostal by denomination
[1:19:49] Pentecostal by experience and he said
[1:19:52] that's what's the matter with the
[1:19:53] Pentecostal Church they got out on the
[1:19:55] wrong ground just like lot
[1:19:59] did and he said that's a reason the
[1:20:01] church tonight people used to think it's
[1:20:03] wrong to do certain things now it's not
[1:20:05] wrong and they do it
[1:20:07] anyhow is that right
[1:20:09] Saints he says you got out on the wrong
[1:20:12] grounds you got on with the wrong crowd
[1:20:14] he said show me your company and I tell
[1:20:17] you who you are let me walk in your
[1:20:19] house and let me see what's laying open
[1:20:21] on the table let me see how that how
[1:20:24] that Bible's marked up now Saints you
[1:20:27] you can't just take your Bible and Mark
[1:20:29] it up to be
[1:20:31] religious you you got to read it amen
[1:20:35] you can mark the Bible up that doesn't
[1:20:37] change anything but if you read what's
[1:20:39] in
[1:20:41] it he said it tell you who you are and
[1:20:45] he said let me see where it's these old
[1:20:46] true stories uh let me listen to what
[1:20:49] kind of music you're bringing on the
[1:20:51] radio let me see what kind of pictures
[1:20:54] you got in your house let me add let me
[1:20:56] see what kind of pictures you got on
[1:20:58] your
[1:20:59] phone and I'll tell you what you made
[1:21:02] out of yes sir that's your what your
[1:21:04] soul is feeding on regardless of what
[1:21:08] your testimony is your fruits prove what
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] are he said oh it's a truth your soul is
[1:21:15] feeding on something and whatever
[1:21:17] characteristic of your soul is it'll
[1:21:19] show forth that's the reason Jesus said
[1:21:21] by their fruit you shall know them
[1:21:25] that's right he said you took a lot of
[1:21:26] advantage of saying I spoke in tongues I
[1:21:28] got the Holy Ghost if your life doesn't
[1:21:31] type up with it you didn't do it you
[1:21:33] either got the devil or the
[1:21:38] flesh
[1:21:41] amen and we see people in churches
[1:21:45] sometimes and and and we we notice that
[1:21:48] you know it doesn't seem like they ever
[1:21:50] sell out all the way it doesn't seem
[1:21:53] like they ever fully surrender it seems
[1:21:55] like they always got maybe a foot out in
[1:21:57] the world or or maybe they got some
[1:21:59] worldly entertainments or something or
[1:22:01] some kind of worldly things in their
[1:22:02] life and and maybe they maybe they come
[1:22:04] to church but it doesn't seem like
[1:22:06] they're as consecrated as they need to
[1:22:08] be and those type things and so we see
[1:22:10] those things and you wonder sometimes
[1:22:13] what do these people really
[1:22:15] see but Saints I'm not interested today
[1:22:19] in trying to classify what type type of
[1:22:23] believer everybody is that's not my job
[1:22:27] that's not your
[1:22:29] job I'm not really interested in putting
[1:22:32] everybody in one group or the other and
[1:22:36] I'm not really interested in looking
[1:22:37] around and saying pennies nickels dimes
[1:22:39] quarters half dollar Sil oh that brother
[1:22:42] there he's about 4 cents that brother
[1:22:44] over there he's about 27 that's not my
[1:22:46] job Saints because I've been wrong too
[1:22:48] many times I've seen people that would
[1:22:52] go long a certain way for years and then
[1:22:55] something set fire to their soul and
[1:22:58] they changed and they live
[1:23:00] differently I've seen it happen
[1:23:03] sometimes 15 20 years of coasting along
[1:23:06] but then God come on the scene one day
[1:23:09] maybe in a service like this right here
[1:23:11] God come on the scene and change their
[1:23:14] life right I've been wrong too many
[1:23:17] times I've seen people and I said
[1:23:19] they're a real believer and they ain't
[1:23:21] around no more yeah right and I've seen
[1:23:23] people said they ain't going to make it
[1:23:26] and they doing good today because God
[1:23:29] come on the scene sir it's not my job to
[1:23:32] classify everybody I'm not sitting
[1:23:34] around trying to figure out who's
[1:23:35] foolish virgin and who's wise virgin and
[1:23:38] and who's make believer and who's
[1:23:40] unbeliever that's God's job I'm here to
[1:23:42] preach the gospel
[1:23:44] today can you say Amen today Saints amen
[1:23:48] I don't know how anybody is going to end
[1:23:51] up so I'm not giving up on
[1:23:57] nobody I can't give up on nobody that's
[1:24:01] in God's hands I Won't Give Up on
[1:24:05] nobody it ain't how you start Saints
[1:24:07] it's how you
[1:24:09] finish all
[1:24:11] right some of us might not start out
[1:24:13] very good but we can finish this race
[1:24:16] Saint
[1:24:18] amen good you never know when
[1:24:22] something's going to click with somebody
[1:24:24] that's right you never know what hour
[1:24:26] God's going to come on the scene for
[1:24:28] somebody so we don't give up see lot was
[1:24:31] a carnal believer brother brand said but
[1:24:33] he was still a Believer
[1:24:36] right he wasn't an unbeliever he wasn't
[1:24:39] a make believer he was still a
[1:24:41] Believer now that's second Peter 2:7 if
[1:24:44] you want to read that the Bible said
[1:24:46] that the sins of Sodom vexed his
[1:24:48] righteous Soul
[1:24:50] daily is that right yeah he wasn't an
[1:24:53] unbeliever but he was hanging around
[1:24:56] with the wrong crowd Saints and I don't
[1:24:59] care who you are today if you hang
[1:25:02] around with the wrong crowd it will have
[1:25:04] an effect on
[1:25:06] you it it you can't stay around the
[1:25:10] world and not get
[1:25:13] worldly that's right that's good on the
[1:25:17] flip side you can't hang around Holy
[1:25:20] Ghost believers and not live closer to
[1:25:24] God that's why we assemble oursel
[1:25:27] together I got to come get some of it
[1:25:29] Saints I got to come get around some
[1:25:32] Believers you might leave this church
[1:25:35] and never come across another believer
[1:25:37] until you come back to this church so
[1:25:40] it's critical that we assemble oursel
[1:25:43] together we oh it's critical
[1:25:48] Saints yeah we got to have each other
[1:25:51] today amen amen I got to be around you
[1:25:53] so I can be
[1:25:56] better come on somebody you got to have
[1:25:59] that brother or sister sitting next to
[1:26:02] you you got to have them saints amen I
[1:26:06] tell you I can't sit at home and be a
[1:26:08] goodest Christian as I ever
[1:26:10] was come on I got to come to the house
[1:26:14] of the
[1:26:15] Lord amen good or bad whoever you're
[1:26:19] around will have an effect on you right
[1:26:23] amen and lot had went off into Sodom and
[1:26:27] he had taken the easy way out and he'd
[1:26:29] went off into Sodom and he backslid and
[1:26:31] his children were engaged to sodomites
[1:26:34] and his wife was engaged in all the
[1:26:37] social activities of
[1:26:39] Sodom brother Bram said lot had wife
[1:26:43] trouble on said this where it gets quiet
[1:26:47] ain't
[1:26:49] it Saints there's no decision
[1:26:52] that you'll ever make outside of serving
[1:26:55] the lord Jesus Christ that'll have more
[1:26:58] of an impact on the quality of your life
[1:27:01] than who you're going to spend it with
[1:27:03] young people that's a decision that's
[1:27:05] got to be done under prayer and
[1:27:08] searching and seeking because it's the
[1:27:11] number one determining outcome of how
[1:27:14] your life is is who you spend it with
[1:27:18] right now brother Brown said the sins of
[1:27:20] Sodom Vex lot's soul only his wife
[1:27:23] wouldn't permit him to do anything about
[1:27:25] it and I'll tell you Saints if you got a
[1:27:28] good wife or you got a good husband
[1:27:31] you're blessed today you're blessed
[1:27:34] today cuz it's hard to be five cents
[1:27:37] worth of husband married to 50 cents
[1:27:39] worth of
[1:27:43] wife it's a hard life for that wife it's
[1:27:47] hard to be a dollar's worth of husband
[1:27:49] and have a dime's worth it's hard for
[1:27:51] that husband it's hard to be unequally
[1:27:54] yolked amen it's the most important
[1:27:57] decision so lot had gotten himself into
[1:28:00] quite a predicament he was in quite a
[1:28:04] situation but it didn't matter because
[1:28:07] he was a part of Abraham and everything
[1:28:11] that was in that land belonged to
[1:28:13] Abraham and and and you might have some
[1:28:16] family today that's gotten themselves
[1:28:18] into a similar situation maybe they're
[1:28:21] in a bad situation maybe they're not
[1:28:23] doing very well today but it doesn't
[1:28:25] matter because they're a part of you and
[1:28:28] everything that was in that land belongs
[1:28:30] to you
[1:28:31] today the Bible said you're the Seed of
[1:28:35] Abraham and you HS with him according to
[1:28:38] the
[1:28:39] promise come on
[1:28:41] somebody everything is in this land
[1:28:44] right here belongs to you now the
[1:28:47] prodical son is a great example and and
[1:28:50] you know you all know the story in I'm
[1:28:52] GNA say Luke 15 but the man had two sons
[1:28:55] and one of the sons came to him and he
[1:28:57] wanted his inheritance and then he took
[1:29:00] his inheritance and he spent it all on
[1:29:02] riotous living the Bible said and the
[1:29:05] Bible said that he got in a then a a
[1:29:08] drought came through the land one like
[1:29:10] not like what we got going on here in
[1:29:12] Hardy but a drought came through the
[1:29:15] land and and said that he he got in a
[1:29:17] bad situation he spent all of his money
[1:29:20] and there was a drought in the land and
[1:29:22] he found himself so low that he had to
[1:29:24] take a job in a foreign land feeding the
[1:29:27] Hogs yeah is that what the Bible said
[1:29:30] Saints and the Bible said he got in such
[1:29:32] a backsliding low condition that he was
[1:29:36] living off a corn
[1:29:39] husks now I don't know much about
[1:29:41] farming Saints but I know that the corn
[1:29:45] husk is the part of the tamale that you
[1:29:48] throw
[1:29:50] away come on
[1:29:56] I don't know about farming but I know a
[1:29:57] lot about tamales and I know you don't
[1:30:00] eat the corn husk and this man was in
[1:30:03] such a situation till he found himself
[1:30:05] living on corn
[1:30:08] husk in the manure pile now you say well
[1:30:11] brother George he he probably deserved
[1:30:13] it yeah he probably did but when you
[1:30:15] look into the message you find that we
[1:30:17] all deserved
[1:30:20] it right come on now now brother Brown
[1:30:23] said he said all of us deserve death
[1:30:25] because we were rebellions against God
[1:30:28] but notice we all deserve dying but God
[1:30:30] is so merciful he shouldn't never have
[1:30:32] thought of us he's so merciful till he
[1:30:35] took the sins of every one of us and
[1:30:37] struck it on his only begotten son
[1:30:40] Christ that we might not perish but have
[1:30:42] eternal life
[1:30:44] right good amen you say well brother
[1:30:47] George I've been in the message my whole
[1:30:48] life that's good but you still had to
[1:30:50] have your sin taken away
[1:30:53] you say brother George I look at all
[1:30:54] these good works I do that's good but
[1:30:56] you still had to have your sin taken
[1:30:58] away you say brother George look at all
[1:31:00] the tapes I listen to every day that's
[1:31:02] good but you still had to have your sin
[1:31:04] taken away yes sir brother George look
[1:31:07] at all I do for the church that's good
[1:31:10] but you still had to have your sin taken
[1:31:14] away brother George I've been my
[1:31:16] family's been in the message three
[1:31:17] generations that's good but you still
[1:31:20] had to have your sin
[1:31:22] away
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:26] amen so nobody can look at anybody and
[1:31:30] think they're better than
[1:31:32] somebody cuz we all had to come the same
[1:31:35] way amen you might have a little more
[1:31:38] Revelation in the next brother you might
[1:31:40] know a little bit more but you ain't no
[1:31:42] better we all had to come the same way
[1:31:45] through the same
[1:31:47] blood and the same Lord Jesus had to get
[1:31:50] me as had to get you you has had to get
[1:31:52] your
[1:31:55] children oh
[1:32:00] God good we still had to have our sin
[1:32:02] taken away see Saints we got to learn to
[1:32:06] have a little Grace for
[1:32:09] people we just never know what people go
[1:32:13] through you don't know what's going on
[1:32:16] Saints I've had a couple of calls over
[1:32:17] the past couple weeks that shocked me
[1:32:19] people that look like everything was
[1:32:21] going going good that looked like
[1:32:23] everything was was doing fine that on
[1:32:25] the outside looked like they had it all
[1:32:27] together and they're going through great
[1:32:31] trial that could be anybody in here
[1:32:33] today yeah you might look like you got
[1:32:35] it all together don't mean you do you
[1:32:37] might look like everything's going great
[1:32:39] don't mean it is you never know what
[1:32:41] people go through you never know what
[1:32:44] happened before they walked in that door
[1:32:45] back there you never know what school's
[1:32:48] like or what work's like or what home
[1:32:51] life is like like or what the marriage
[1:32:52] is like you never know Saints what
[1:32:54] people deal with and we got to have some
[1:33:00] Grace
[1:33:02] amen sometimes it seems like we scan the
[1:33:04] room looking to find something wrong
[1:33:06] with
[1:33:08] somebody you see people walk into the
[1:33:11] church and the eyes start to
[1:33:15] roll nobody that's trying to get their
[1:33:17] life
[1:33:18] together needs to have eyes rolled at
[1:33:20] them
[1:33:22] come on at least they're at church it
[1:33:25] could be anywhere at least they made it
[1:33:27] to church last thing they need some ey
[1:33:30] rolls come on somebody that's the last
[1:33:33] thing we need already taking a bad Road
[1:33:37] already down they coming here to get
[1:33:40] better
[1:33:42] amen and we got to learn to have a
[1:33:44] little Grace it's an evil deceitful age
[1:33:48] it's an age where the devil has traps on
[1:33:50] every corner
[1:33:52] it's an age where the devil sets traps
[1:33:54] for every one of us and it's hard Saints
[1:33:57] it's a deceptive age and outside of the
[1:33:59] Holy Ghost you can't live above it right
[1:34:03] and people get caught in traps and
[1:34:05] people make mistakes I'm one of
[1:34:08] them we all do and we got to have a
[1:34:12] little Grace now the Bible said blessed
[1:34:15] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[1:34:18] mercy so if we want Mercy for ourselves
[1:34:21] we got to learn how to have mercy on
[1:34:26] others amen good yes
[1:34:30] sir got to have a little
[1:34:35] Mercy Galatians
[1:34:37] 61 says Brethren if a man be overtaken
[1:34:41] in a fault ye which are spiritual that's
[1:34:44] us
[1:34:45] supposedly
[1:34:47] on if a man be overtaken in Fault ye
[1:34:50] which are spiritual restore such a one
[1:34:53] in the spirit of meekness now don't say
[1:34:56] go tell everybody in church about it
[1:34:58] on but it says considering thyself lest
[1:35:02] thou also be tempted so the spiritual
[1:35:07] can be tempted
[1:35:09] also is that what the Bible says says
[1:35:11] every one of us can be tempted every one
[1:35:14] of us can go through a Temptation none
[1:35:16] of us can get above that Amen on and
[1:35:20] I'll tell you Saints sometimes if you
[1:35:22] get too religious your temptation is
[1:35:24] coming amen if we ever get to thinking
[1:35:27] that we're above somebody else that
[1:35:29] we're better than somebody else the fall
[1:35:32] is
[1:35:34] coming blessed is the meek for they
[1:35:37] shall inherit the earth amen and brother
[1:35:41] Brown said in a message of Grace he said
[1:35:43] according to prophecy there will come a
[1:35:46] headstone and I want you to notice that
[1:35:48] when The Headstone comes the prince that
[1:35:51] that's going to cry out will cry the
[1:35:53] message of Grace
[1:35:56] Grace for it's by Grace We're saved not
[1:35:59] by works lest any man should boast and
[1:36:02] the message of Grace has been Trampled
[1:36:04] Under the feet of men until it's become
[1:36:06] a disgrace see we don't believe in
[1:36:09] anything goes we believe in hold the
[1:36:12] standards but we believe there's Grace
[1:36:14] when people make
[1:36:17] mistakes oh
[1:36:20] God and he said some of them runs out
[1:36:22] onto eternal security and some of them
[1:36:24] runs out into everything but the true
[1:36:26] message of Grace Remains the Same and
[1:36:29] that's where Satan tries to knock it out
[1:36:31] from the church but it's the grace of
[1:36:33] God that we're all saved
[1:36:36] by amen amen Give the Lord a hand clap
[1:36:40] of Praise this
[1:36:47] morning it's a message of Grace that
[1:36:50] we're all saved by than amen now we find
[1:36:54] this example of this prodical son that
[1:36:56] one day he was sitting in the manure
[1:37:00] Pile in the pig pin living off a corn
[1:37:06] husk and the Bible said that he came to
[1:37:12] his oh God Saints you got to remember
[1:37:16] the day you came to yourself you got to
[1:37:19] remember you got to remember remember
[1:37:21] the time where everything changed for
[1:37:23] you Saints don't ever lose sight of the
[1:37:26] day God come on the scene for you and if
[1:37:28] he did it for you he can do it for your
[1:37:31] brother if he did it for you he can do
[1:37:33] it for your children if he did it for
[1:37:34] you he can do it for your
[1:37:38] church thank you Lord he came to himself
[1:37:41] the Bible said and he said you know what
[1:37:44] my father has got slaves that's living
[1:37:47] better than I'm living right
[1:37:49] here God it's better be a doormat in the
[1:37:52] house of God than to dwell in the tents
[1:37:54] with the wicked yeah he said my father
[1:37:57] has got slaves that's living better than
[1:37:59] me and I'd like to go back to my father
[1:38:02] and I could just I don't want to be a
[1:38:03] son I don't deserve to be a son but if I
[1:38:06] could just be a servant in his house
[1:38:09] that'd be good enough for me at least
[1:38:11] they got something to eat sir
[1:38:15] amen amen and so he goes to his father's
[1:38:19] house I love the Bible says said that
[1:38:21] when he was yet a way off sir that his
[1:38:25] father saw
[1:38:27] him
[1:38:28] GL and ran to him and had compassion on
[1:38:34] him and he said I've sinned against you
[1:38:37] I've sinned against God and his father
[1:38:39] said bring the bring the best
[1:38:42] robe bring the ring bring some shoes and
[1:38:45] put on his feet bring the fatty
[1:38:49] calf all right thank you Lord Jesus
[1:38:54] yes he said my son who was lost is found
[1:38:58] he was dead and now he's alive again
[1:39:01] than Lord and He welcomed him back with
[1:39:03] open arms

[1:39:08] him about all the wrong he'
[1:39:12] done he didn't tell him how he messed
[1:39:15] up he didn't tell him all the mistakes
[1:39:17] he made he already knew the mistakes he
[1:39:20] made

[1:39:27] place as a son oh

[1:41:19] know but it's still my family it still
[1:41:22] belongs to me and everything that's in
[1:41:24] this land belongs to
[1:41:27] me and I might be fighting with somebody
[1:41:30] in the backyard but if we ever get
[1:41:32] around to the front yard I got you
[1:41:36] back I don't agree with everything I see
[1:41:39] I don't agree with everything every
[1:41:40] Church does but it's still my family and
[1:41:44] if they need my help I'm going to be
[1:41:49] there man I don't want to just worry
[1:41:52] about one church I'm worried about
[1:41:58] people we're in this to help
[1:42:05] people that's got to be our heart to
[1:42:07] help people amen now brother Bram said
[1:42:10] there was 10 of them Brams and he said
[1:42:13] they might fight like cats and dogs in
[1:42:15] the backyard but if they went around to
[1:42:17] the front yard and you started messing
[1:42:20] with one of them he said you got all 10
[1:42:22] of them brandom on
[1:42:24] you that's right and he said that's the
[1:42:27] way it is with the Church of God Saints
[1:42:31] there's so much going on in the message
[1:42:33] there's churches in Tucson that that
[1:42:36] people are putting up fraudulent
[1:42:37] websites with their name on it that
[1:42:39] slander that church and slander those
[1:42:41] people and slander those pastors and and
[1:42:44] look I I don't agree with everything
[1:42:46] some of those churches has done but I
[1:42:48] don't want to see that that's right oh
[1:42:51] come on because you know what it might
[1:42:53] be my church next it might be your
[1:42:55] church next amen Saints we got to have
[1:42:58] each other's backs in
[1:43:01] this
[1:43:04] amen and I'll tell you Saints
[1:43:07] Abraham was given the task to go get
[1:43:12] lot what I like about it so much is that
[1:43:15] we don't read in the Bible of any time
[1:43:17] where God came down and spoke to AB
[1:43:20] Abraham in this instance and told him to
[1:43:22] go get lot that's right we don't see in
[1:43:25] the Bible where he ever had a vision or
[1:43:28] or or God ever met him in a physical
[1:43:30] body and said go get
[1:43:32] lot that's right but what he
[1:43:36] had was the
[1:43:38] word that promised that everything that
[1:43:42] was in that land belonged to him right
[1:43:45] and I'll tell you Sint sometimes we go
[1:43:47] through trials and we're praying about
[1:43:48] it we're we're asking about it we're
[1:43:50] seeking God God on it and we're looking
[1:43:51] for some kind of sign or wonder or
[1:43:54] Miracle or something like that to happen
[1:43:56] when we've already got the original word
[1:43:59] that tells us what to do all
[1:44:00] right Amen in the midst of trial Saints
[1:44:04] we we don't always have to have a
[1:44:05] supernatural sign we don't always have
[1:44:07] to dream a dream we don't always have to
[1:44:10] have an audible voice we can take God's
[1:44:12] word and go
[1:44:14] forward now brother Brown said there's
[1:44:16] no place to retreat in God he said go
[1:44:20] forward if the doctor says it's cancer
[1:44:22] go forward he said if he says it's TB go
[1:44:25] forward if the devil says you can't give
[1:44:28] this up go forward he said if your home
[1:44:30] says that you're going to be a fanatic
[1:44:32] go
[1:44:33] forward if the church turns you out go
[1:44:37] forward he said there's no retreating
[1:44:39] back go forward speak the word and go
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] forward thank you Lord so when you see
[1:44:50] these trials come against you Saints you
[1:44:52] see these test in your family yeah speak
[1:44:56] the
[1:44:57] word and go forward Saints amen you know
[1:45:01] what the word says so you can tell the
[1:45:03] devil give it back that's my family and
[1:45:05] I claim them in Jesus name you say devil
[1:45:09] give me back my health in Jesus name go
[1:45:13] by his stripes I'm
[1:45:15] Healed speak the word and go forward he
[1:45:19] said thank you Lord because everything
[1:45:23] in this land belongs to you everything
[1:45:26] in the promised land belongs to you now
[1:45:29] to us that's the Holy Ghost everything
[1:45:32] that's in this word belongs to you I'm
[1:45:35] going to read you this quote Saints
[1:45:36] it'll change
[1:45:37] everything restoration of brid tree he
[1:45:40] says then we have the privilege to
[1:45:44] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:45:48] gives
[1:45:49] us for God has a law and his law is his
[1:45:53] word and God in his word made certain
[1:45:57] claims to the church therefore we have
[1:46:00] the right to enforce these claims upon
[1:46:04] Satan and say give it
[1:46:08] back and he has to do it because we take
[1:46:11] God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right
[1:46:15] down on our knees and say it's thus
[1:46:18] saith the Lord
[1:46:22] and he's got to give it up that's all
[1:46:25] cuz the holy spirit is there to make him
[1:46:27] do
[1:46:29] it oh my the law of the spirit of God is
[1:46:33] to force Satan to give up that which he
[1:46:36] has unrightfully deceitfully taken from
[1:46:39] God Souls of men he took from God Souls
[1:46:42] of women children sickness of the body
[1:46:44] he placed upon people where God Made
[1:46:47] Them In His Image to be like him and the
[1:46:49] church is given the rightful legal right
[1:46:52] by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and
[1:46:55] force this upon
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:59] him oh my so we just believe God's word
[1:47:03] and go forward we believe what he said
[1:47:06] and go forward we tell Satan to give it
[1:47:09] back yes oh come on Amen now Four Kings
[1:47:14] brought their armies and took Sodom and
[1:47:17] they' already beat five Kings in their
[1:47:19] armies and they took lot and where they
[1:47:21] messed up is when they took lot because
[1:47:24] everything that was in that land
[1:47:25] belonged to Abraham and and and brother
[1:47:28] Brown said Abraham didn't have a bunch
[1:47:30] of military men he had some servants he
[1:47:34] said but God told him how to do it he
[1:47:35] showed him how to do it he said and he
[1:47:37] said he divided his servants and he and
[1:47:39] he went and took back everything that
[1:47:42] the enemy had taken from him yeah now
[1:47:46] brother Brown said he wasn't a warrior
[1:47:49] yeah that's right
[1:47:51] it amen but he knew that everything in
[1:47:54] the land belonged to
[1:47:56] him I'll tell you Saints David wasn't a
[1:47:59] Warrior when he smoked Goliath he was
[1:48:01] just a kid yeah shamgar wasn't a Warrior
[1:48:04] when he picked up at Ox
[1:48:07] gold is that
[1:48:09] right now I grew up
[1:48:12] rough and I grew up
[1:48:14] fighting and I fought all my life and I
[1:48:17] got kicked out of school every year for
[1:48:19] fighting with somebody
[1:48:23] and Mom got tired of picking me up from
[1:48:25] school all the time that's how I grew up
[1:48:28] I grew up rough I had a brother and it
[1:48:30] was rough we were just rough Saints and
[1:48:32] I've been fighting my whole life and it
[1:48:35] served me well in the message brother
[1:48:40] Ben but that might not be your
[1:48:43] testimony your testimony may be that you
[1:48:46] was born in the message and you've been
[1:48:48] raised in the message and you gave your
[1:48:51] heart to the Lord in the message and
[1:48:53] you've lived for the Lord every day of
[1:48:55] your life I pray that is your testimony
[1:48:58] that's what I want for my children
[1:49:00] that's what I want for my grandchildren
[1:49:01] that's what I want that's the greatest
[1:49:04] testimony there
[1:49:06] is don't ever let nobody tell you oh if
[1:49:08] you go out in the world you come back
[1:49:09] you got a testimony that's foolishness
[1:49:11] Saints stay right with it it's a
[1:49:14] greatest testimony I know is to live for
[1:49:16] the Lord every day of your
[1:49:19] life
[1:49:20] that's the best testimony there is
[1:49:23] that's the best now you might have a
[1:49:25] testimony where you was in a gang you've
[1:49:27] been shot four times you did drugs and
[1:49:29] and and and did all kinds of that's fine
[1:49:31] too Saints we appreciate that testimony
[1:49:34] because it just shows that God can save
[1:49:41] anybody but it doesn't matter what your
[1:49:43] testimony is don't be ashamed of it
[1:49:46] right and you might not feel like today
[1:49:48] you got an earth shattering testimony
[1:49:51] you might not feel like you got a
[1:49:52] testimony like some of the others but
[1:49:54] that don't mean you're not a
[1:49:57] warrior that don't mean you don't know
[1:49:59] how to fight you might not grown up
[1:50:01] fighting like me that don't mean you
[1:50:02] don't know how to fight I'll tell you
[1:50:04] the devil don't want to go to battle
[1:50:06] against a mama fighting for her
[1:50:09] children the devil don't want to go to
[1:50:11] battle against a mama that's shielding
[1:50:13] her children he don't want to go to
[1:50:15] battle against a housewife that's
[1:50:17] fighting for her marriage he don't want
[1:50:19] to go to battle against a child that's
[1:50:21] praying for a wayward parent the devil
[1:50:24] don't want none of
[1:50:25] that the devil don't want to go to
[1:50:27] battle against a grandparent that's
[1:50:29] putting a hedge of protection around
[1:50:31] their grandchildren the devil don't want
[1:50:32] to go battle against a daddy fighting
[1:50:35] for his little girls the devil don't
[1:50:36] want to go to battle against these
[1:50:38] believer
[1:50:39] Saints that's fighting for their family
[1:50:42] it ain't the size of the dog in the
[1:50:44] fight it's a size of the fight and the
[1:50:48] dog because every everything is in the
[1:50:51] land belongs to
[1:50:53] you now Abraham was forced into battle
[1:50:56] he didn't go looking for trouble but he
[1:50:58] wasn't running from it
[1:51:00] either he was minding his own business
[1:51:03] in the plains of mamry when the devil
[1:51:04] came to him but he wasn't backing down
[1:51:07] once he was presented with a
[1:51:09] fight I like that verse that says if I
[1:51:11] must fight then I must Reign if I'm
[1:51:14] going to have to fight anyways I might
[1:51:16] as well win
[1:51:18] Saints
[1:51:21] if I got to lace my boots up the devil's
[1:51:23] got to go down
[1:51:25] somewhere if I got to fight I got to
[1:51:28] reain if I got to fight I got to win if
[1:51:32] you got to fight you might as well win
[1:51:34] Saints now you're going to have to fight
[1:51:36] every day of your life you might as well
[1:51:40] win this is for those who overcome it's
[1:51:44] for Victorious People
[1:51:46] things amen and I like that little story
[1:51:50] brother told about brother Bram told
[1:51:51] about Peter cartright and he said he
[1:51:53] went into that town and he was going to
[1:51:55] hold a Revival and when he went back
[1:51:58] there he said the town bully saw him
[1:52:00] washing windows and he said what are you
[1:52:02] doing here he said I came to hold a
[1:52:06] Revival he said there ain't going to be
[1:52:08] no Revival in this town he said I got to
[1:52:11] the Lord told me to is that right Saints
[1:52:14] the Lord told me to hold this revival he
[1:52:17] said well you'll have to whip me first
[1:52:18] he said well I'll just do that next
[1:52:23] then yes said he got done washing
[1:52:25] windows he jumped up on top of him and
[1:52:27] he said if I must fight then I must
[1:52:29] reain beat the tar out of him he said he
[1:52:32] got saved that night in the
[1:52:37] service because everything that was in
[1:52:39] that town belonged to Peter
[1:52:43] cartright amen so if you got to get the
[1:52:46] sword of the spirit out Saints the
[1:52:48] devil's got to go down
[1:52:50] somewhere if you got to polish up the
[1:52:53] shield of Faith there's got to be a pain
[1:52:55] train coming for the devil
[1:52:57] somewhere yes amen if you got to clip on
[1:53:00] the Buckle of Truth The Devils have got
[1:53:02] to go flying
[1:53:06] somewhere if the helmet of salvation
[1:53:09] goes on the gloves got to come off if we
[1:53:12] going to fight why don't we
[1:53:15] win right
[1:53:18] amen and it's time that the bride
[1:53:21] recognizes who she is it's time that she
[1:53:26] recognizes now brother Brown said if
[1:53:28] there wasn't a law to that he said Sons
[1:53:30] and Daughters of God could create them a
[1:53:33] world out here and go live a private
[1:53:35] life on
[1:53:37] it right number that's a direct
[1:53:40] quote he said you have the power in you
[1:53:44] to do it if you've got a shadow of the
[1:53:47] power of God in you you've got the the
[1:53:50] power to do it God's omnipotence see
[1:53:52] what I mean the power that's in you will
[1:53:55] make you could speak a world into
[1:53:57] existence and go live on it Hallelujah
[1:54:00] there you are that's what power is in
[1:54:02] the church
[1:54:05] now that's what power is in the church
[1:54:10] right now he said right not tomorrow not
[1:54:15] next week not next month not when
[1:54:17] something else happens yeah right right
[1:54:24] now he said but it's controlled by a law
[1:54:28] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:54:31] Commandments it's a law of
[1:54:33] Faith Jesus said all things are possible
[1:54:36] to them that
[1:54:40] believe that is if you can believe it
[1:54:43] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:54:45] believe
[1:54:46] oh whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:54:51] believe that is yours every place that
[1:54:54] the soul of your foot can set upon by
[1:54:56] faith God gives it to you amen it's
[1:55:00] yours you possess it if you can find the
[1:55:03] key to this law of faith that opens it
[1:55:05] to you you see what I mean that power is
[1:55:08] he said that power is controlled by if
[1:55:11] you are a son of God you are a daughter
[1:55:13] of God that never leaves
[1:55:16] you it's with you all the time
[1:55:20] he said but your faith gets away from it
[1:55:24] oh my can the musicians
[1:55:27] come oh my just one more
[1:55:30] quote recognizing your day and its
[1:55:32] message he said the spirit of
[1:55:36] God which is the word of God my spirit
[1:55:39] my word is spirit and life he said the
[1:55:41] spirit of God will put the bride in her
[1:55:45] place yes because she'll recognize her
[1:55:49] position
[1:55:50] in the
[1:55:52] word then she's in Christ we'll put her
[1:55:56] in her place no National Force will do
[1:55:59] it but National Force did Drive Israel
[1:56:02] into the Homeland watch what's happening
[1:56:05] now and National forces of the Council
[1:56:07] of churches will drive every
[1:56:10] organization into it but the power of
[1:56:14] God will raise the bride into
[1:56:18] Glory oh hallelujah oh God just play
[1:56:23] Something There Brother
[1:56:27] s so Abraham took God at his
[1:56:32] word and he went on the word of God on
[1:56:36] the strength of the word on the power of

[1:57:32] stole from us we take it back by the
[1:57:35] power of the word of God and if he's
[1:57:37] made us sick in our body we take it back
[1:57:39] yeah and if he's messing with our mind
[1:57:42] we take it back and if he makes us think
[1:57:45] we're not good enough we take it back by
[1:57:47] the blood of Jesus Christ we are perfect
