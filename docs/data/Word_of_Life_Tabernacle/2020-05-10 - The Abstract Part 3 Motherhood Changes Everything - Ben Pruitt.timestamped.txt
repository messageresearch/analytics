[38:31] 3 verses 14 and 15 it's so good to see
[38:35] so many of you this morning and but a
[38:38] Steve good that you drop by this morning
[38:40] thank you for doing that
[38:41] and all of you that are here some of you
[38:44] haven't made it yet since since we've
[38:48] opened the church up and just a second
[38:50] weekend and so it's good to see you I
[38:51] haven't seen some of you guys by the
[38:53] bill in about six or seven weeks so it's
[38:56] good to see your faces this morning and
[38:58] all of you that were able to come and
[38:59] see brother Glen back this morning his
[39:01] wife and different ones and and if I
[39:04] missed you we're glad that you're here
[39:05] and just it's always a blessing to see
[39:08] the people of God in the house of God
[39:10] and we may have to put up with a few
[39:12] restrictions right now but we're going
[39:14] to a place for the bill where there's no
[39:16] restrictions on our fellowship we're so
[39:19] grateful for that amen amen Genesis
[39:21] chapter 3 and verse 14 I also want to
[39:27] tell you while I'm thinking about it
[39:29] before I get to preach in that as but
[39:32] the David already said as Peters
[39:34] birthday
[39:34] Stuart and Allison's birthday they must
[39:36] have been meant for each other we had
[39:38] the same birthday
[39:39] but as Peters birthday as well so it
[39:41] must be a good day to be born and he's
[39:43] back there in on the video and I wanted
[39:45] to say happy Mother's Day to all of you
[39:46] mothers so my mother who's listening
[39:48] today and we're going down there to see
[39:50] her after the service and I'll be gone
[39:53] for a couple of days but if you need me
[39:55] you can call me and then I'll be back
[39:57] Wednesday but but Allen's gonna preach
[39:59] for us on Wednesday night so I'm looking
[40:00] forward to that Genesis chapter 3 and
[40:03] verse 14 the Lord God said unto the
[40:06] serpent because thou hast done this thou
[40:09] art cursed above all cattle and above
[40:12] every beast of the field and upon thy
[40:14] belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou
[40:17] eat all the days of thy life I will put
[40:21] enmity between thee and the woman
[40:22] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[40:26] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[40:29] his heel I'm so grateful that even in in
[40:34] cursing the serpent there's a great
[40:36] promise
[40:37] for a demo for the Lord without his
[40:39] blessing to the word you may be seated I
[40:42] want to continue in the vein of the
[40:46] abstract but kind of turn down a side
[40:49] road today if you will and and speak to
[40:52] you on motherhood changes everything
[40:56] motherhood changes everything
[41:00] one thing that we can say about every
[41:03] human being that's ever been born no
[41:07] matter how on where he is or I looked at
[41:10] brother JT when I said that but I don't
[41:11] mean that bad towards you brother JT and
[41:14] brother Steve or whoever's on this side
[41:16] but matter how ornery that you are you
[41:19] had a mother that's true of all of us
[41:22] that means that's a simple statement but
[41:24] that's true we can agree on that this
[41:26] morning that we all had a mother
[41:30] motherhood has always had a special
[41:32] status in our culture and and we elevate
[41:36] mothers to a place even today but it
[41:38] seems like that in this age it the
[41:40] meaning of it has been cheapened and and
[41:42] it's been taken from what it was and I
[41:46] hate to see that and I'm sure you do too
[41:49] that motherhood is cheaping to the point
[41:52] where it's seen as a hindrance to a
[41:56] woman to become a mother when actually
[41:59] it's the fulfillment of every woman of
[42:02] the dream that she would have to be a
[42:04] mother that's her dream and even an
[42:07] animal sometimes will adapt we'll adopt
[42:10] a baby when they can't have one
[42:12] themselves and and we find that with
[42:15] mothers they want to mother something
[42:16] and even little girls have that built
[42:19] into their DNA it's just who they are
[42:21] what's this what makes them special
[42:23] because a man no matter what the culture
[42:26] tells you today a man can never be a
[42:28] mother and that seems like a simple
[42:32] statement two boys do it but it's it's
[42:34] hard to for people today to get past the
[42:36] ABCs that men are men and women are
[42:38] women and a man just can't be a mother
[42:41] he can't do it and because it's a
[42:45] special status that was given to the
[42:47] woman to be able to bear children
[42:50] when you blur that distinction between
[42:53] the sexes when you make a man a woman
[42:54] and a woman a man and there's no
[42:57] distinction or there's no difference you
[42:59] also devalue the things that make that
[43:02] person unique and that motherhood makes
[43:06] a woman unique a man can't do that now
[43:10] we looked over the last couple of weeks
[43:12] at an abstract and how that the title
[43:16] deed to the earth was lost Adam lost
[43:18] said the original owner was God and then
[43:22] Adam loses the title deed to the earth
[43:24] and so now he has to go through a
[43:28] process and and come to a place of
[43:30] redemption and so the next thing we
[43:33] found was that they began to advertise
[43:35] for a redeemer there began to be a cry
[43:38] God who was worthy to open the book and
[43:41] to loose the seals thereof and they
[43:43] looked all over and they found no man
[43:45] worthy to do that but yet one of the
[43:49] qualifications if you look at that
[43:51] advertisement and in your abstract for a
[43:53] redeemer one of the qualifications was
[43:55] to be a kinsman it had to be a kinsman
[44:00] now to be a kinsman would mean that he
[44:02] would be born of a woman this is the
[44:04] qualification to be a human being job's
[44:06] job 14 and one man that is born of a
[44:09] woman he's a few days and full of
[44:11] trouble so it's a it's a it's a
[44:13] qualification or what makes you human
[44:15] you have a mother you're born of a woman
[44:20] this binds us all together as I said no
[44:23] matter how ornery we might be or
[44:25] whatever it might be there's a mother
[44:27] somewhere and so as time went on and and
[44:32] each Hebrew mother would realize that
[44:35] this promise had been made that the seed
[44:37] of the woman would bruised the the head
[44:40] of the serpent and so they each one
[44:43] would would longed to have this seed
[44:45] they would want to be able to to be the
[44:47] one who would be would birth this child
[44:50] who would be the Messiah but then in
[44:53] Isaiah 7:14 the revelation become
[44:55] clearer he says therefore the Lord
[44:57] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[45:00] virgin shall conceive so he said it
[45:02] won't be
[45:03] yeah it won't be a just any warm and it
[45:07] won't be a married woman it won't be by
[45:09] the by the a man doing something but
[45:12] it'll be a virgin that'll conceive so
[45:16] it'll be God creating himself in the
[45:20] womb of the mother hey man so and he
[45:25] said he should be call his name Emmanuel
[45:27] it says he'll be God with us right now
[45:31] the second person or a third person but
[45:32] God with us she'll call his name
[45:35] Emmanuel now a woman's identity is tied
[45:41] up in what she is and and in the stages
[45:45] of her life she coach to a point where
[45:46] she's identified originally as a virgin
[45:49] or an unmarried woman and then she comes
[45:52] to a place of marriage she's no longer
[45:56] identified with what she was but now she
[45:59] is a married woman she's identified
[46:01] differently and then she's gonna go to
[46:04] another place and and you know some
[46:07] women if their husband would put them
[46:09] away or it would be a divorce
[46:10] today you have a divorced woman and then
[46:14] you might have a situation where a man
[46:15] would would would die and his wife
[46:19] becomes a widow it's a different
[46:21] identity than she had as a married woman
[46:24] you find that some women get remarried
[46:27] and so if she's been widowed baby she'll
[46:30] get remarried
[46:31] been waiting for my mom on that for many
[46:33] years now that passed away a number of
[46:37] years ago and we teased her about that
[46:39] and I'll find out if she's listening
[46:40] this morning but you know that changed
[46:46] is your status the change is what you
[46:48] care about you know right now my mom
[46:49] gives all of her attention to her
[46:52] grandkids but if she got married she
[46:55] would have someone else to care for it
[46:58] changes who she cares for and then
[47:01] another thing is the birth of a child
[47:02] that would change who the woman is it
[47:05] changes her to a mother and so she has
[47:10] that already in her and even a woman
[47:12] maybe that would be unable to have
[47:13] children she still has that inner but
[47:16] now a woman
[47:16] how's the child becomes a mother and so
[47:19] she goes to these changes in Romans
[47:21] seven and two and this is kind of an odd
[47:22] place to take this but I want to build a
[47:25] background for what we're gonna say
[47:26] today that in Romans 72 says the woman
[47:30] will chasten husband is bound by the law
[47:31] to her husband so long as he lives but
[47:34] if the husband is dead she is loosed
[47:36] from the law of her husband now he's
[47:37] speaking of the law in Christ right the
[47:41] law is the old husband he said you can't
[47:42] be married to the wall and come to
[47:45] Christ you have to the law has to be
[47:49] dead to you for you to come to Christ so
[47:53] he says if the husband be dead she is
[47:55] loosed from the law of her husband so
[47:56] then if while her husband liveth she be
[47:58] married to another man she should be
[48:00] called an adulteress but if her husband
[48:02] be dead she is free from that law so
[48:05] that she is no adulteress though she be
[48:06] married to another man so now her status
[48:10] has changed and it says what she has
[48:13] become as a widow but what he says is
[48:17] the reason why your old husband has to
[48:19] be dead it's not so you can live alone
[48:22] and be a widow but so that you can be
[48:24] remarried right that would be a nut nut
[48:29] and not speaking of in the natural now
[48:31] but thinks spiritually that the husband
[48:34] is dead the old husband the law is dead
[48:36] the old husband the denomination is dead
[48:38] the old husband that the world is dead
[48:42] so what does that make it makes a
[48:44] situation where now we have to be
[48:47] married to Christ right the old husband
[48:51] is dead so once he's dead then we're a
[48:53] widow but we don't remain a widow we
[48:56] don't want to stay in that in that state
[48:58] of spiritual widowhood where we find
[49:02] ourself drifting back and forth from
[49:05] pillar to post and place the place and
[49:07] not know where we stand and not know who
[49:09] we are not know if we're born again or
[49:11] not but we have to come to a place where
[49:13] we're married to Christ the word so we
[49:19] don't want to stay in that place as a
[49:20] widow now in Luke chapter 18 there's a
[49:24] story of an unjust judge and a widow
[49:29] and he kind of hangs the key at the door
[49:31] this parable he says he's faking parable
[49:33] unto them to this end that for this
[49:35] purpose it meant not always to pray and
[49:37] not to faint so he says don't quit
[49:39] praying so that's that's what the
[49:41] parable says but he said saying there
[49:44] was in a city a judge which feared not
[49:46] God neither regarded man and there was a
[49:48] widow in that city
[49:50] she came unto him saying avenge me of my
[49:53] adversary and what she's saying that
[49:55] word avenge us to do justice do justice
[49:59] of my own my adversary so she's in a
[50:03] court of law and you'll find that word
[50:04] adversary in other places the Bible says
[50:06] agree with your adversary quickly
[50:08] speaking of an adversary at law so it
[50:11] would be someone who would come against
[50:13] you in a legal case and so here comes a
[50:16] widow and she's got something against
[50:18] her someone has come against her for
[50:21] what hurts her property whatever that
[50:23] property is something that belongs to
[50:25] her and someone has come and put a claim
[50:27] on it and so she comes to the unjust
[50:30] judge and she cries to him and she says
[50:32] give me back what's mine something
[50:35] belongs to me
[50:36] well I think we ought to learn as we
[50:39] talked to Wednesday night about touching
[50:40] Christ I think we ought to learn how to
[50:42] cry how to call out to God and say Lord
[50:45] I need something from you I need
[50:49] something from you I need to be saved I
[50:53] need to be healed I need to whatever it
[50:55] is in our life we have to ask God for
[50:57] those things there's no better way than
[50:59] to cry for it that just seems simple but
[51:02] there's just no other way sister first
[51:03] that God ever gave us then to cry out to
[51:06] work for what God what we did he'd say
[51:08] what God already knows what you need
[51:10] before you ask but he wants you to ask
[51:12] so you cry out for what you have need of
[51:15] and and so she said avenge me of my
[51:18] adversary and he would not for a while
[51:21] but afterward he said within himself
[51:23] though I fear not God no regard man yet
[51:27] because this Widow trouble with me I
[51:30] will avenge her I'll make it right lest
[51:33] by her continual coming she weary me and
[51:38] the unjust judge is a man in a position
[51:40] of power does the right
[51:42] for the wrong reasons he will not be
[51:46] moved by the seriousness of the
[51:47] situation or how well she puts the case
[51:49] before him she he won't be moved by that
[51:52] he just he's just sitting there he won't
[51:54] do it because he only moves when someone
[51:56] gives him a little money you don't fear
[51:58] God he don't care about mahan right he's
[52:02] an extreme example and what a contrast
[52:05] that Jesus draws from our Heavenly
[52:07] Father who knows what we have need oven
[52:10] yet when we come to him and ask him he
[52:12] wants to give us good things so the
[52:18] widow then is a woman that is in this
[52:22] place where she's lost her husband she's
[52:24] lost something she wants it back her cry
[52:28] is a cry for restoration what was mine
[52:34] she finds herself in a situation where
[52:37] she lost possession of something she had
[52:39] and I want us to look at numbers chapter
[52:41] 27 numbers chapter 27 and verse 8
[52:46] brother David put a reminder on his
[52:48] phone for 11:45 he was being optimistic
[52:53] it wasn't for me it was for him but was
[52:56] tease me about it being a little bit
[52:57] optimistic but we maybe will have you
[53:00] out by that time I need a big clock
[53:01] right there in the back you love the
[53:06] Lord this morning numbers twenty seven
[53:09] and eight is the intestate succession
[53:11] laws of the Old Testament so and first
[53:15] and this was assumed in the law that it
[53:17] first goes to a son specifically the
[53:20] first son would get a double portion of
[53:22] his father's estate and then to the
[53:24] other sons equally but now in numbers 27
[53:29] and 8 it says that's what speaking of
[53:31] the children of Israel and this is
[53:33] occasion because some some daughters
[53:35] come to Moses and they said hey our
[53:37] father died and left no sons and said we
[53:40] deserve a right to inherit and so they
[53:45] the daughters come and then he says
[53:47] that's what Moses goes to God and prays
[53:49] about and said that's what speaking to
[53:50] the children of Israel saying if a man
[53:51] died have no son you should cause his
[53:54] inheritance to pass to his daughter so
[53:56] those two sons and daughters if you have
[53:59] no daughter than you should give his
[54:00] inheritance to his brethren brothers
[54:03] have no brother he shall give his
[54:05] inheritance to his father's brethren his
[54:08] uncles if his father have no brother and
[54:11] you shall give his inheritance under his
[54:13] kinsmen that is next to him of his
[54:16] family he shall possess it it shall be
[54:19] into the children of Israel a statute of
[54:21] judgment as the LORD commanded Moses now
[54:23] there's something missing there's
[54:26] something missing if you looked at our
[54:28] intestate succession laws today would be
[54:30] different because they've made a place
[54:34] for your wife right and back then there
[54:38] was there was no succession by the wife
[54:42] but yet the wife had to live she had to
[54:45] do something you just have widows
[54:46] floating out there so there was
[54:47] understood that the wife would be able
[54:50] to possess her husband's property but
[54:53] she didn't have a legal right for it she
[54:55] was a like we would call today a trustee
[54:57] or a caretaker or what we would call a
[54:59] life estate as long as she was alive she
[55:01] was able to live there some states so
[55:03] have a version of that it's called our
[55:05] dower rights why for courtesy rights for
[55:09] the man so there's certain rights that
[55:11] she asks but today a wife would inherit
[55:15] a portion of the estate either half in
[55:17] some states or or a child's portion and
[55:20] some states she inherits all so the wife
[55:23] is not given a place now again as I said
[55:27] it's evident that in Bible times she
[55:29] would have a life of state because the
[55:30] story of Ruth tells us that and we'll go
[55:32] to that maybe after a while she could
[55:34] live on it she could use it but she
[55:37] might lose it and then she'd have to go
[55:40] cry to get it back why because she's a
[55:44] will and she'd have to depend on the
[55:47] judge or the King to be able to get it
[55:50] to her give it back to her she was
[55:54] crying for possession of what was hers
[55:56] now this Widow and Jesus story was
[55:59] crying for this and the judge gives in
[56:02] on the merits of the case but because
[56:05] she kept coming back over and over again
[56:07] and I want you to see
[56:10] today that there's different stages or
[56:12] different levels of widowhood because
[56:15] there are some that are widows that
[56:17] don't have the potential to be remarried
[56:20] and there's others that under the
[56:23] levirate law there's widows that would
[56:25] have the ability to be married to their
[56:28] husband's brother or there's widows that
[56:31] could be redeemed right or have their
[56:34] property redeemed and the difference
[56:37] would be if the widow was of an age
[56:39] where she could have children if she
[56:40] could become a mother now this is such a
[56:45] great thing and I know it's it's I'm
[56:47] trying to walk you through slowly so
[56:49] that you get it this morning I don't
[56:50] want to leave you behind because it
[56:52] takes a while to kind of wrap your mind
[56:54] around some of this but she kept coming
[56:57] back this Widow did but now she didn't
[57:00] have the potential maybe and we'll look
[57:02] at a couple of other widows that had
[57:04] more potential than she did but she
[57:07] didn't have the potential of others but
[57:09] she just wanted the benefits of her
[57:12] property she wanted to be able to use it
[57:15] and I'll tell you this morning that
[57:18] there's people in the world today that
[57:20] want to be able to use the blessings of
[57:22] God and so they go to God and ask him
[57:24] and he gives it to him
[57:27] sure he does he's a good god he goes to
[57:30] the rain to fall even on the just and
[57:32] the unjust he's not an unjust judge he's
[57:35] a good God and so he gives to each one
[57:38] as they asked and many times a person
[57:40] with faith will come and be prayed for
[57:42] and be healed even though they're not
[57:43] saved and it's hard to even understand
[57:46] but there'll be a person but they have
[57:48] faith to believe and they'll come and be
[57:50] prayed for him they'll be healed and you
[57:51] feel healed maybe you've cancer
[57:53] something else see another Sain of God
[57:55] they're struggling and having to work
[57:56] through problems in their body say well
[57:58] why can't they be healed well it works
[58:00] me comes off of faith and then there's
[58:03] things that that come in our lives to
[58:05] test us but but here you find a woman
[58:09] who gets what she wants but we've got to
[58:13] be careful what we want there's got to
[58:17] be a desire within us I hope you hear me
[58:20] this morning Church to be more than just
[58:22] beggars
[58:24] to be more than just have a right to
[58:26] live on the land but we want to come
[58:29] back into inheritance again we want to
[58:32] come back in the line where we can have
[58:34] we can actually have our name on the
[58:36] deed well look at another widow second
[58:42] Kings chapter 8 and verse 1 Elijah is
[58:48] speaking to the woman whose son had he
[58:51] had restored to life now this is the
[58:53] woman who had had she'd had an husband
[58:55] and evidently her husband has died in
[58:58] the meantime and now she's been through
[59:03] a lot you remember it's the same woman
[59:05] whose son had been given to her and then
[59:09] the son had been restored to life and
[59:11] now now the husband is dead
[59:14] and so he tells her he says the rising
[59:17] going that down that household insta
[59:19] journey
[59:20] wheresoever thou canst adjourn the LORD
[59:23] hath called for a famine and they should
[59:25] also come upon the land seven years now
[59:27] notice this woman is different because
[59:30] she has a son she has a son now
[59:35] we don't there's nothing that speaks of
[59:37] remarriage with her but she already has
[59:39] a son by her first husband so she can
[59:42] and she can has more of a claim on the
[59:44] land than the first widow did it was
[59:47] only coming and crying but this woman
[59:49] has a son she's a mother and so it
[59:51] should come upon the land 7 years and so
[59:53] the woman arose and did after the saying
[59:55] of the man of God this woman believed in
[59:57] a prophet and when the Prophet spoke she
[1:00:01] did what he said that's right she did
[1:00:04] what he said but I want you to notice it
[1:00:07] as it deepens here in and her meaning or
[1:00:10] her status of widowhood and she wind
[1:00:12] with her households to during the land
[1:00:14] of the Philistines 7 years and come to
[1:00:17] pass at the seven years in the woman
[1:00:19] returned out of the land of the
[1:00:20] Philistines
[1:00:21] she went forth to crying to the king for
[1:00:25] her house and for her land and I believe
[1:00:28] we've seen that in this age that there
[1:00:30] come a time when the people of God began
[1:00:32] to cry out we see in the Bible that he
[1:00:36] was the healer of artists
[1:00:38] Jesus we see in the Bible that they will
[1:00:40] speak with new tongues and take up
[1:00:42] serpents and we see mark 16 and we don't
[1:00:45] see that happening in the church and so
[1:00:48] the people begin to cry out for
[1:00:50] something at the end of the seven years
[1:00:52] they begin to cry out for something from
[1:00:55] the king she wants more than just the
[1:00:59] benefit she wants her house in her land
[1:01:02] and verse four and the King talked with
[1:01:05] gage to the servant of the man of God
[1:01:06] saying tell me I praise thee all the
[1:01:08] great things that Elijah has done isn't
[1:01:10] it wonderful how God worked this out the
[1:01:12] key happened to be talking with the
[1:01:14] servant of the prophet and saying tell
[1:01:16] me what happened in his ministry and it
[1:01:19] come to pass as he was telling the King
[1:01:20] how he had restored a dead body to life
[1:01:22] and behold the woman whose son he'd
[1:01:25] restored to life cried to the King for
[1:01:27] her house and for her land and gaze I
[1:01:29] said my lord o king this is the woman
[1:01:32] and this is her son whom Elijah restored
[1:01:35] to life and when the King asked the
[1:01:37] woman she told him so the King appointed
[1:01:40] unto her a certain officer saying
[1:01:44] restore hall that was hers all the
[1:01:47] fruits of the field since the day she
[1:01:48] left the land even until now so he's
[1:01:52] saying that he appointed to her an
[1:01:53] officer and brother Branham types an
[1:01:55] officer of the law to the Holy Ghost you
[1:01:58] go look it up in connection with the
[1:01:59] abstract he talks about how that the
[1:02:01] Holy Ghost was an officer that we could
[1:02:03] call to enforce our claims to healing to
[1:02:06] enforce our claims to salvation to
[1:02:08] enforce the claim that we had on the
[1:02:10] land on the Lessing's of God so he says
[1:02:15] restore all that was hers from the day
[1:02:19] she left the land even until now and so
[1:02:24] there would come a restoration again
[1:02:27] this woman has a son
[1:02:28] the first widow did not the second widow
[1:02:31] has a son but this presents a problem he
[1:02:35] can inherit but if she remarries he
[1:02:37] won't inherit the new husband's property
[1:02:41] because he's only an heir of his father
[1:02:45] right so she has more potential than the
[1:02:49] first widow but not
[1:02:51] potential of motherhood and so now she
[1:02:57] cannot inherit by herself but she has a
[1:03:01] son and he can't inherit from a new
[1:03:03] husband so in order for the land to be
[1:03:07] held by a widow in order for it to be
[1:03:10] redeemed in order for there to be a
[1:03:14] lineage pass on she would need to move
[1:03:17] from her status as a widow into marriage
[1:03:20] now look in order for what Adam lost see
[1:03:25] that's what we wanted back is what Adam
[1:03:26] lost it's one thing to go back to all
[1:03:30] that the church lost one thing to go
[1:03:33] back even to Pentecost we want all that
[1:03:36] Adam lost right so there comes a cry in
[1:03:41] the nominal church for blessings from
[1:03:43] God there comes a cry in the Pentecostal
[1:03:46] church for restoration of the gifts but
[1:03:50] among the bride there's a different cry
[1:03:54] hey Ben what is that Christ I cry to be
[1:03:57] married it's a cry for full redemption
[1:04:03] hey Ben
[1:04:05] and so in Ruth chapter 1 and verse 3 it
[1:04:12] talks about the story of Ruth here's
[1:04:14] another Widow and Lemelin Naomi's
[1:04:17] husband died she was left her two cents
[1:04:19] naomi is a widow they took them wives to
[1:04:22] the women of Moab the name of the one
[1:04:24] was Orpah the name of the other Ruth
[1:04:26] they dwelled there about 10 years Malin
[1:04:29] and chilly undyed also both of them the
[1:04:32] woman was left of her two sons and her
[1:04:33] husband now here's three widows
[1:04:37] here's Orpha who could get remarried but
[1:04:42] she has no desire to bear a child in
[1:04:45] Israel or to become a part of the plan
[1:04:48] of God
[1:04:50] here's Ruth who had the potential to
[1:04:54] bear children here is Naomi who could
[1:04:56] get married but not to bear children
[1:04:59] she's of an age where she can't do that
[1:05:03] it is Ruth who the responsibility falls
[1:05:06] - oh my because she has more potential
[1:05:12] than just the right to live on the land
[1:05:15] her potentials and her ability to be a
[1:05:18] mother
[1:05:19] because she's going to end up in the
[1:05:21] very line of Jesus Christ you see why
[1:05:25] motherhood is elevated to such a status
[1:05:28] and today sexual promiscuity and all
[1:05:31] those things devalue it to the point
[1:05:33] where it doesn't mean anything but in
[1:05:36] order to be in that seed line a mother
[1:05:37] would have to be someone who would be
[1:05:40] married to one of the tribe of juda and
[1:05:43] she could then become a mother and she
[1:05:48] was one who didn't have any children by
[1:05:51] her old husband but now she could
[1:05:54] produce something her potential was not
[1:05:56] in the past but her potential is in the
[1:05:59] producing a son I hope you hear me today
[1:06:03] our potentials the Bride of Christ it's
[1:06:06] not in the past but our potential is in
[1:06:09] the coming of the Lord our potentials in
[1:06:13] the future potential is in birthing that
[1:06:16] that word that's coming in this hour
[1:06:17] we'll talk about that in a moment but
[1:06:20] her potentials and her ability to bear
[1:06:22] children
[1:06:22] oh my so this is for redemption for
[1:06:27] restoration could only come when she was
[1:06:30] a widow no longer now I found out some
[1:06:35] couple few years ago as I was something
[1:06:37] hit me when I was researching land
[1:06:40] records I realized that if you take
[1:06:42] title as a widow we assume you're single
[1:06:46] because it's understood that no one
[1:06:49] would put widow after their name if they
[1:06:51] were married so when you take title or
[1:06:55] you convey title and you put on their
[1:07:01] Jane Jones that make up a name to make
[1:07:04] up a name and my brain don't work too
[1:07:07] good but Jane Jones conveys to Jim Smith
[1:07:13] and Jane Jones that says a single person
[1:07:17] so you know that there's no husband that
[1:07:19] you have to worry about his rights
[1:07:20] getting conveyed so Jane Jones a single
[1:07:24] person but if it said Jane Jones a widow
[1:07:27] Jane Jones widow and then you would know
[1:07:32] automatically she's a single person it's
[1:07:35] written in the law you can assume that
[1:07:37] because she wouldn't identify herself as
[1:07:40] a widow if she was remarried and so many
[1:07:44] times in in the way we come to God we
[1:07:46] identify ourselves like a widow we
[1:07:49] identify ourselves like someone who
[1:07:51] doesn't have any rights we identify
[1:07:54] ourselves if someone who's just going to
[1:07:55] get by on the skin of our teeth and bill
[1:07:58] assert and just make it barely but he
[1:08:01] don't want us to identify like that he
[1:08:03] wants us to when we write a check he
[1:08:05] wants us to say mrs. Jesus Christ now
[1:08:12] when Ruth comes to boys we find out that
[1:08:17] her cry is different then the cry that
[1:08:21] the woman had when she come to the
[1:08:24] unjust judge or even the woman who come
[1:08:27] to the king but she comes to her future
[1:08:31] husband and she doesn't say what she
[1:08:36] wants but she comes to him and she lays
[1:08:41] down by his feet and Ruth 3 and 9 he
[1:08:46] said who art thou
[1:08:48] yesterday em Ruth on handmade spread
[1:08:52] therefore thy skirt over that handmaid
[1:08:54] for thou art a near kinsman she's saying
[1:08:59] this is my only request be a husband to
[1:09:03] me if you go look at this what that
[1:09:06] means be a husband to me me a husband I
[1:09:10] want you to perform the duties of a
[1:09:12] husband to me she's not satisfied with
[1:09:16] just living off his benevolence she
[1:09:18] already has that she's already been
[1:09:21] cleaning in the field
[1:09:23] she'd been gleaning in and she's been
[1:09:26] he's been good to her and I think we can
[1:09:28] all say God's been good to us
[1:09:31] God's been good at all of our life we
[1:09:33] can look back when we were children to
[1:09:35] see what God did and how God moved and
[1:09:37] what God what God meant to our life but
[1:09:39] brother Steve that's not enough we've
[1:09:42] got to move beyond that to a place where
[1:09:44] we know we're not just living off the
[1:09:46] gifts but we're moving to a place where
[1:09:48] we had the gifts but we had the giver
[1:09:50] not just the gifts not just the
[1:09:55] benevolence not just the trappings of
[1:09:59] borås she didn't want his house although
[1:10:04] she would get it she wasn't looking for
[1:10:07] his land although she would get it she
[1:10:12] wanted him
[1:10:13] and at some point our cries the Bride of
[1:10:17] Christ has to become mature to the point
[1:10:21] where we're crying not just for the
[1:10:23] things that we need though we'll always
[1:10:24] do that there will always be a place for
[1:10:27] that but we're not just crying for the
[1:10:29] things we need but we're writing a check
[1:10:32] for those things right we're not just
[1:10:35] crying for it but we're actually believe
[1:10:38] we have the ability to have it so we
[1:10:41] don't cry or cry it's not in this age
[1:10:45] just for things just forgets just for
[1:10:48] blessings but it's for a person Jesus I
[1:10:54] want you I want you in the fullness of
[1:10:58] your word I don't want just a gift I
[1:11:01] don't want just something for that
[1:11:03] yesterday had my potential it's nothing
[1:11:06] just a gift my potential is not it just
[1:11:08] being one of your handmaids they're just
[1:11:10] one of your people my potential is being
[1:11:12] your wife instead of asking for things
[1:11:17] she asked for him wonder when was the
[1:11:20] last time that you went to God you said
[1:11:22] Lord let me have you I want you in my
[1:11:26] life it's not so much about being healed
[1:11:29] it's not so much about all the things
[1:11:31] feeling good I want those things my lord
[1:11:33] I need you if I have you I can make it
[1:11:37] through any trial if I have you I can
[1:11:39] make it through any trouble if I have
[1:11:40] you crawler virus puzzle scare
[1:11:42] the world doesn't scare me no matter
[1:11:46] what would happen in the world that I
[1:11:47] live in if I have him that'll be enough
[1:11:52] take me to be your wife well I said you
[1:11:58] rest until I performed all that I need
[1:12:03] to perform now you remember the kinsman
[1:12:04] had to make a public testimony so he
[1:12:08] goes and we went through that how he
[1:12:09] went through how he went to the nearer
[1:12:12] kinsman and he couldn't do it cuz it
[1:12:14] hinder his inheritance but he comes now
[1:12:17] he couldn't fall into the dirty hands of
[1:12:19] Satan this how brother branham put it
[1:12:21] but now Boaz and Ruth four and nine said
[1:12:24] to the elders and unto all the people he
[1:12:27] said you're witnesses this day that I
[1:12:30] have bought all that was the Himalayas
[1:12:32] oh there was chilly horns and melons of
[1:12:35] the hand of Naomi
[1:12:36] moreover ruth the moabite us the wife of
[1:12:39] Mahlon have i purchased to be my wife
[1:12:43] why there's a purpose there's a purpose
[1:12:49] I have purchased her to raise up the
[1:12:52] name of the Dead upon his inheritance
[1:12:55] not to give her something new a new
[1:12:58] inheritance but to give her what Adam
[1:13:00] lost or he with me now I wanted to give
[1:13:05] her something new but to give her what
[1:13:07] Adam lost hey man I had purchased her to
[1:13:11] be my wife to raise up the name of the
[1:13:13] dead upon his inheritance that the name
[1:13:14] of the Dead be not cut off from among
[1:13:16] his brethren from the gates of Gators in
[1:13:18] his place he said your witnesses this
[1:13:21] state and all the people that were in
[1:13:23] the gate and the elders said we are
[1:13:24] witnesses the Lord make the woman notice
[1:13:26] that has come into thine house notice
[1:13:29] what they they had wisdom they spoke to
[1:13:31] him and they said now we're gonna we're
[1:13:33] going to put a blessing on you the Lord
[1:13:35] make the woman that is coming to thine
[1:13:36] house like Rachel like Leah which too to
[1:13:39] build the house of Israel how by
[1:13:41] becoming mothers which to did build the
[1:13:44] house of Israel and do that worthily in
[1:13:46] effort to be famous and best to him and
[1:13:49] let the house be like the house of faris
[1:13:52] whom tame are born did married to Judah
[1:13:56] of the seed which the Lord shall give
[1:13:58] thee of this young woman oh my now I'm
[1:14:03] trying to stay focused here because we
[1:14:05] could go a bunch of different directions
[1:14:06] now but I want you to notice this maybe
[1:14:10] we'll get done before 11:45 marriage is
[1:14:15] not the end result but the purpose is to
[1:14:19] bear children
[1:14:21] people forget that in the day and age
[1:14:24] that we live in and but this was the
[1:14:26] purpose and especially in those times it
[1:14:28] would have been a blessing to be able to
[1:14:30] have children but this was more than
[1:14:33] just a blessing but it was imperative it
[1:14:35] was absolutely necessary for this seed
[1:14:39] line to continue hey men and boys took
[1:14:45] Ruth and Ruth for 13 boys took Ruth she
[1:14:49] was his life and when he went in unto
[1:14:51] her the Lord gave her conception and she
[1:14:53] bare a son and the woman the women said
[1:14:56] it to Naomi this should be the Lord
[1:14:59] which had not left thee this day without
[1:15:01] a kinsman that his name may be famous in
[1:15:05] Israel and I want you to notice that the
[1:15:07] story doesn't stop when Boaz does the
[1:15:10] act of redemption and takes Ruth but the
[1:15:13] story
[1:15:13] stops only when Ruth bears a child are
[1:15:19] you with me now
[1:15:20] many times we leave off the last part of
[1:15:22] that Ruth has to have a child if Ruth is
[1:15:25] childless there can be no there's still
[1:15:27] no redemption
[1:15:28] oh my Naomi took the child and and
[1:15:35] reread verse 15 he shall be into the
[1:15:37] arrest or of thy life
[1:15:38] and the nurse sure of that old age for
[1:15:40] that daughter-in-law which loveth see
[1:15:42] which is better than even seven sons has
[1:15:44] borne him and the helmy took the child
[1:15:46] later than her bosom and become nurse
[1:15:47] son to it and the women her neighbors
[1:15:50] gave it a name saying there's not a
[1:15:51] there's a son born to Naomi they called
[1:15:54] his name Obed he is the father of Jesse
[1:15:56] the father of David he puts him right in
[1:16:03] the line the natural lineage of Christ
[1:16:06] now watch
[1:16:08] brother branham when he reads the story
[1:16:11] of the unjust judge in the widow he does
[1:16:13] this in a message called The Anointed
[1:16:15] once at the end time but he reads from
[1:16:17] Luke chapter 18 and verse 6 he reads the
[1:16:20] whole story including this part that we
[1:16:23] didn't read in verse 6 and the Lord said
[1:16:24] hear what the unjust judge saith shall
[1:16:28] not God avenge his own elect which cry
[1:16:31] day and night unto him though he bear
[1:16:33] long with them he said I tell you he
[1:16:36] will avenge them speedily nevertheless
[1:16:39] when the Son of man cometh shall he find
[1:16:42] faith on the earth will there be anyone
[1:16:48] crying for the right things now hang
[1:16:54] with me here because there were many
[1:16:56] crying for a revival there was people
[1:16:59] all over crime for a revival I said we
[1:17:01] need a prophet to return and they didn't
[1:17:03] recognize one stood right among them a
[1:17:05] prophet of God stood there and people
[1:17:07] look at that said if we could only have
[1:17:09] what Pentecost asked I don't want just
[1:17:10] for Pentecost hat I don't want just what
[1:17:13] Azusa Street had that was wonderful I
[1:17:15] want that but I want more than that
[1:17:17] because my promise is more than that my
[1:17:20] potential is more than that I don't want
[1:17:24] to be just like the church down the road
[1:17:26] that has the music in the scene the one
[1:17:27] that's wonderful I want that I want the
[1:17:30] blessings of God I want the gifts of God
[1:17:31] to follow on every one of them but I
[1:17:33] want to give her more than that I want
[1:17:37] to give her and so he says he says shall
[1:17:41] he find faith now brother Branham says
[1:17:44] so that's the question he said here is
[1:17:46] where I wanted to get you in revelations
[1:17:48] 10 we'll get to it in a few minutes and
[1:17:50] another scripture verse he said in the
[1:17:51] days of the message of the seventh angel
[1:17:53] the mystery of God ought to be finished
[1:17:55] he said here is the question if you
[1:17:58] follow in that line in this hour will it
[1:18:01] be finished will I find the faith will
[1:18:05] Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time he's
[1:18:08] challenging the people well I find faith
[1:18:11] well Malachi 4 be fulfilled hey Ben well
[1:18:15] I find faith for the faith of the
[1:18:17] children back restore the face to
[1:18:19] children back to the face of the
[1:18:20] father's the
[1:18:21] the word now we can say yes we can look
[1:18:29] back and say God did send Elijah God did
[1:18:33] what he promised he would do we lose
[1:18:36] sight of that sometimes say well I don't
[1:18:38] see God keeping any promises he kept a
[1:18:40] promise and he keeps promises to you
[1:18:42] every day but he kept a promise that he
[1:18:45] would send a prophet but that wasn't the
[1:18:47] end of the promise hey man
[1:18:50] but he promised he said they will not
[1:18:52] all sleep but will all be changed in a
[1:18:56] moment in the twinkling of an eye hey
[1:18:57] man there's coming a time when our faith
[1:19:00] will become sight there's coming a time
[1:19:03] of the JC when what we believe for
[1:19:05] become reality we believe in a rapture
[1:19:09] we believe in something that'll change
[1:19:10] our bodies we believe in a in a heaven
[1:19:13] that's a place we can go to we believe
[1:19:14] in a literal millennial reign we believe
[1:19:16] in a heaven in a Christ a literal Christ
[1:19:18] will sit on the throne for the better
[1:19:21] that's what believers believe so our
[1:19:24] faith is faith now but we're looking for
[1:19:26] that we're looking for that coming if
[1:19:28] there's still something coming so today
[1:19:31] what are we crying for we're not crying
[1:19:34] just for the the he didn't say will will
[1:19:38] the gifts be restored but will the faith
[1:19:41] be restored hey Beth will the faith be
[1:19:46] restored wills us and nothing again the
[1:19:48] gifts had to be restored but there had
[1:19:50] to come something further than that
[1:19:51] there had to come the original word amen
[1:19:55] so we can say yes that's been fulfilled
[1:19:58] but what are we crying for today number
[1:20:01] the Branham in marriage and divorce he
[1:20:03] said so it is with the church that
[1:20:05] refused us to become pregnant in this
[1:20:07] age that we now live in to bring four
[1:20:09] children of this age now today is
[1:20:12] Mother's Day and the church refuses to
[1:20:16] be a mother to the word if we could put
[1:20:18] it that way
[1:20:19] they refuse to bear the word in their
[1:20:22] lives the church nominal refuses oh my
[1:20:28] what does a person do and they walk away
[1:20:30] from the message they just refuse to
[1:20:32] bear the word
[1:20:34] I don't want that that makes me ashamed
[1:20:39] it changes me too much I don't want to
[1:20:42] go through those things in my body I
[1:20:44] don't want to have to deal with those
[1:20:46] problems so they walk away and all of a
[1:20:49] sudden their weekends are free all of a
[1:20:52] sudden they don't have to plate eyes no
[1:20:53] more feels pretty good at first you walk
[1:20:56] away there's pleasure and sin for a
[1:20:58] season all of a sudden you get to do
[1:21:00] whatever you want to do you can leave
[1:21:03] any way you want to but you'll find out
[1:21:05] there's consequences for that because
[1:21:07] God's Word is there for a reason
[1:21:10] hey man and the Christian is the
[1:21:12] happiest person on the face of the earth
[1:21:14] if they really know Jesus if they really
[1:21:17] have him if they're really married to
[1:21:19] Christ the word and they've given up
[1:21:20] everything to them just like a woman
[1:21:22] who's married to her husband and
[1:21:24] submissive in a godly way she's so
[1:21:27] happiest person on the face of the earth
[1:21:29] husband doesn't beat her e doesn't use
[1:21:31] her as a doormat he doesn't think only
[1:21:33] of himself but what is it they're one
[1:21:35] they become or she completes him she's a
[1:21:39] part of him that he couldn't be oh my if
[1:21:42] you could only recognize that's you in
[1:21:44] Christ but you dabble in the world we
[1:21:47] dabble in things of the world because
[1:21:49] we're just not happy with what we have
[1:21:51] remember we're called to bring for
[1:21:54] children of this age
[1:21:56] we're not Lutheran's we're not Wesley's
[1:21:58] with events that neither are we
[1:22:00] Pentecostals we've got to be the
[1:22:03] children of this age through the
[1:22:04] pregnancy of the Word of God to bring
[1:22:06] forth a child of this age the seed child
[1:22:09] are you with me this morning
[1:22:11] I appreciate the freedom to preach this
[1:22:13] morning it's been wonderful seems like
[1:22:15] the last couple of weeks maybe I just
[1:22:16] needed to preach without people for a
[1:22:18] while or without many people some of you
[1:22:20] all had to come to run the sound and and
[1:22:22] do the music and things but without many
[1:22:25] people it seemed like and then when you
[1:22:26] come back it seems different maybe God
[1:22:28] needed to teach me a lesson
[1:22:29] wouldn't take that for granted again and
[1:22:33] one day we'll all be able to get
[1:22:34] together and take the ropes off these
[1:22:35] pews and shake each other's hands and do
[1:22:38] all that but in the meantime this is
[1:22:39] good and so I appreciate the freedom to
[1:22:43] preach I thank you for that now he says
[1:22:45] we're not Wesley's we're not
[1:22:46] Pentecostals we got to be the children
[1:22:48] this age to bring forth the child of
[1:22:50] this age so he says again in a message
[1:22:54] called the choosing of a variety so we
[1:22:55] find today that the modern church a
[1:22:58] modern church world the modern world
[1:23:00] Church and also that the spiritual
[1:23:02] church are both pregnant to give birth
[1:23:05] to sons they've both been impregnated
[1:23:08] they both received seed to give birth to
[1:23:10] sons one of them a denominational birth
[1:23:14] that's going to listen to the one of
[1:23:17] these days at the World Council of
[1:23:18] Churches will produce to the world the
[1:23:20] Antichrist there's a great sermon there
[1:23:25] one of you preachers that can really
[1:23:26] preach how to take that because it's the
[1:23:28] incarnation as a result of the seed they
[1:23:31] received will be the Incarnate devil
[1:23:34] then what would be the results of the
[1:23:36] seed of the birth the bride receives the
[1:23:39] Incarnate Word oh look here the result
[1:23:47] of that see this Antichrist have
[1:23:49] produced to the world the Antichrist or
[1:23:50] a denomination he said I may not live to
[1:23:53] see it I believe I will but you young
[1:23:54] people will remember you heard a
[1:23:55] minister say that that'll finally wind
[1:23:57] up he said that is the mark of the beast
[1:23:59] when she forms that World Council of
[1:24:01] Churches she'll give birth to her son
[1:24:03] the Antichrist the other is pregnant by
[1:24:06] the word of God and will bring forth the
[1:24:11] body the finish body of Jesus Christ
[1:24:17] which is the bride
[1:24:20] hey Beth lay bet you imagine Ruth Boaz
[1:24:26] marries her you know he's rich he's got
[1:24:29] lots of land lots of things she could
[1:24:31] sit back there in the house said I got
[1:24:33] it all now I got it all now man I was
[1:24:37] down there in Moab I was down there
[1:24:38] Naomi sounds we didn't have nothing just
[1:24:40] gleaming in the field I got it all now
[1:24:42] you don't have to glean the more just
[1:24:43] sitting here in the house sitting pretty
[1:24:45] but she found out she had a job to do
[1:24:49] there was something she had to become
[1:24:52] what did she have to do first and
[1:24:55] foremost it wasn't cleaning the house
[1:24:57] and keep up the servants and do all the
[1:24:59] same shoes but no that's part of it
[1:25:01] but what did she have to do before she
[1:25:03] did anything else love her husband that
[1:25:08] was her first ad Oh church we forget
[1:25:12] that sometimes we forget that sometimes
[1:25:14] that our first duty to God is to love
[1:25:17] him our first duty is to love Christ and
[1:25:21] so here she was she had to begin to love
[1:25:23] him and when she loved him things begin
[1:25:25] to change and when that things begin to
[1:25:28] change she began to get a room ready she
[1:25:30] began to work she began to feel
[1:25:31] different things begin to happen until
[1:25:33] one day a child was born why she'd
[1:25:38] become his they'd become one and now she
[1:25:40] would have his child listen so it
[1:25:45] produces it brings forth the finished
[1:25:47] body of Jesus Christ brother man tells
[1:25:49] us when the last one comes in we'll go
[1:25:51] home that'll be the finished body of
[1:25:54] Jesus Christ you say exactly how it will
[1:25:57] that happen I don't know but that's our
[1:26:00] job she will bring forth the finished
[1:26:06] body of Jesus Christ you are
[1:26:08] predestinated yes to bring forth the
[1:26:11] finished body of Jesus Christ you
[1:26:14] pretest said it for a reason he's called
[1:26:17] he's justified he justified he's
[1:26:18] glorified
[1:26:19] he's glorified and so all these things
[1:26:21] come on after the other he didn't called
[1:26:23] you because he knew you would be willing
[1:26:24] to receive it and he put that willing to
[1:26:27] see you it was nothing of your home but
[1:26:31] it was just something that you were
[1:26:32] willing to do now watch
[1:26:36] brother Barron speaking of the natural
[1:26:38] Church in the invisible union of the
[1:26:39] Bride of Christ he said so you see she's
[1:26:42] pregnant with something because she's
[1:26:44] bringing forth members all the time but
[1:26:46] she don't want none of them screaming
[1:26:48] hollering blabbering acts 2:38 miserable
[1:26:50] creatures that she thinks they are I
[1:26:52] know this gets abused sometimes this
[1:26:54] quote but but brother Brennan said it he
[1:26:58] actually said it that she don't want
[1:27:00] none of those kind miserable creatures
[1:27:03] that she thinks they are maybe she looks
[1:27:05] at them and has pity on them well you
[1:27:07] know they that's all just all they can
[1:27:09] be
[1:27:09] you know that's they're just religious
[1:27:11] folk the world today looks at us and
[1:27:13] says well it's just just about
[1:27:15] Pentecostals or whatever they might
[1:27:16] group us in with huh that's not what I
[1:27:19] am I'm a child of the word hey Betts and
[1:27:23] as a child of the word they bet as the
[1:27:25] wife of Christ I have a right to the
[1:27:27] gifts have a right to speaking in
[1:27:29] tongues I have a right to the things of
[1:27:30] God I have a right to be that screaming
[1:27:32] hollering why I'm a child of the word so
[1:27:37] when she brings forth she doesn't just
[1:27:39] bring forth members but she brings forth
[1:27:40] acts 2:38 members
[1:27:44] he said she don't want those kind it
[1:27:46] would certainly embarrass her it would
[1:27:48] ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:27:50] student scientific society church that
[1:27:53] she belong to here they would throw her
[1:27:55] out at the next council she can't have
[1:27:57] it so she don't want to be pregnant with
[1:28:00] the word because that's the only kind
[1:28:02] that the word can bring forth she don't
[1:28:07] want that kind she don't want the church
[1:28:10] the word in his fullness so she stays
[1:28:12] away from her husband and she finds
[1:28:16] other lovers that'll produce other kinds
[1:28:20] of children I'm closing in just a moment
[1:28:27] women who never have children enjoy the
[1:28:30] equivalent of an extra three months a
[1:28:32] year and leisure time and I don't say
[1:28:35] this to make you feel bad if you don't
[1:28:36] have children haven't been able to have
[1:28:38] children or there's some that God allows
[1:28:41] that to be in their life just committed
[1:28:43] fully to him that's a wonderful thing
[1:28:45] but for a woman that has children she
[1:28:48] has extra duties and so they say that
[1:28:51] it's three months a year that a woman
[1:28:53] who doesn't have children some of you
[1:28:55] who recently had your if you had your
[1:28:56] first child you understand that or
[1:28:57] you're about to understand that there's
[1:29:01] a lot to do I was amazed with my wife we
[1:29:06] started having kids and it wasn't that
[1:29:08] different for me it was a little
[1:29:10] different but she woke me up every night
[1:29:11] I didn't get up but she woke me up but
[1:29:17] no I you know it was different for me
[1:29:19] but not that different I still went to
[1:29:22] work every day but for my wife things
[1:29:25] were different
[1:29:26] things were different she was a mother
[1:29:30] and she wanted to be a mother to those
[1:29:32] children and I've always thought it was
[1:29:34] amazing because there's something in my
[1:29:35] life that she wanted to be home with
[1:29:36] them she just wanted to be near him and
[1:29:38] I realized everybody can't be in the age
[1:29:40] that we live in Pharaoh's got people
[1:29:42] making bricks without straw so it's an
[1:29:44] age of slavery almost to have the
[1:29:47] financial status that you need but my
[1:29:48] wife wanted to be a mother and and
[1:29:50] through the grace of God we've lived
[1:29:51] simply and and and people would call us
[1:29:54] poor but yet we she's always been able
[1:29:56] to be at home and I worked in so she was
[1:29:59] able to be a mother to those children I
[1:30:00] see how she wanted to always be with
[1:30:02] them she wanted to be a part of their
[1:30:04] lives and she wanted to be a mother to
[1:30:06] them it was to what she does I watched
[1:30:09] my mother today
[1:30:10] I teased her so I'll say something nice
[1:30:12] about her but she my mother is still a
[1:30:15] mother and she still treats me as her
[1:30:17] baby in some ways and all of her eight
[1:30:20] children she still treats them that way
[1:30:23] and and so she'll give advice even when
[1:30:26] we don't want it but you know it's good
[1:30:30] advice many times but she does she does
[1:30:32] that she'll treat you to come to the
[1:30:34] house and she wants to cook and she
[1:30:36] wants to do things in the kitchen and do
[1:30:38] things around the house because it's
[1:30:39] just what she does she's a mother and
[1:30:43] and it takes time and so you see it it
[1:30:47] takes in some women today look down on
[1:30:50] that
[1:30:51] say well there's nothing worse that
[1:30:54] could happen to you than to become
[1:30:55] pregnant like it just something
[1:30:57] accidentally happened and then I mean
[1:30:58] you have to go out and have an abortion
[1:31:00] get rid of it or you can't live your
[1:31:01] life what a horrible thing why they just
[1:31:08] don't want to deal with it they say that
[1:31:12] a mother spends about three and a half
[1:31:15] hours a week just on housework
[1:31:17] additional housework on a child and
[1:31:19] about 11 hours a week on child related
[1:31:22] activities it adds up to about 754 hours
[1:31:26] of work a year and I think of some
[1:31:30] mothers who also work and I don't know
[1:31:32] how they do that I don't even know how
[1:31:34] it's possible but my hats off to you if
[1:31:36] you have to do both because it's very
[1:31:38] complicated it's very hard and again a
[1:31:43] Satan that that does that even in our
[1:31:45] culture that makes it where it has to be
[1:31:46] that way but looks you take that and you
[1:31:51] think wouldn't it be easier if I didn't
[1:31:54] have any children but you wouldn't be
[1:31:56] who you are
[1:31:58] Beth and now we could take that in turn
[1:32:01] into a spiritual sense wouldn't it be
[1:32:03] easier if I wasn't a Christian wouldn't
[1:32:08] life be easier if I didn't have to go to
[1:32:09] church more specifically if I did wasn't
[1:32:13] a message believer wouldn't it be so
[1:32:16] much easier if I didn't have to do the
[1:32:18] things that believers have to do and and
[1:32:22] wear the clothes and the things and the
[1:32:24] god I've been asked to do by the
[1:32:25] scripture and it'd be easier if I could
[1:32:28] watch Esther this morning getting her
[1:32:31] hair and helped her get her hairbrush
[1:32:32] out it'd be easier just to cut it surely
[1:32:37] but she'd been asked not to do that but
[1:32:44] she could never you can never become
[1:32:46] you'd never be what you are you lose who
[1:32:49] you are and it's so much more important
[1:32:53] than what you the work that you have to
[1:32:56] do you realize your mothers do the most
[1:32:59] important job in the world you have the
[1:33:02] most important job in the world you
[1:33:04] realize that's the Bride of Christ you
[1:33:06] have the most important job in the world
[1:33:10] and it seems like your work is never
[1:33:12] done
[1:33:13] but remember there's something that
[1:33:15] you're molding something that you're
[1:33:16] forming it doesn't stop when the baby
[1:33:18] leaves the womb but when the baby is
[1:33:20] young and as it continues to grow you're
[1:33:22] a mother seems like your work has never
[1:33:25] done but remember there's something
[1:33:28] that's being completed someone has said
[1:33:33] I took a piece of living clay and gently
[1:33:35] formed it day by day molded with my
[1:33:38] power and our two young child soft and
[1:33:40] yielding heart I came again when days
[1:33:42] were gone it was a man I looked upon
[1:33:45] he's still that early impressed bore and
[1:33:48] I could change it Nevermore
[1:33:51] why you have an opportunity to form the
[1:33:53] clay work do it it's worth it now let's
[1:34:00] look when a additional mother was Mary
[1:34:05] she was a virgin and she wasn't
[1:34:09] expecting anything she was just believed
[1:34:12] in God's Word and one day angel come to
[1:34:17] her and said blessed art thou among
[1:34:19] women because you're being given the
[1:34:23] opportunity to be what Isaiah talked
[1:34:28] about to become a mother
[1:34:32] and it won't be by any of your own
[1:34:35] instrumentality it won't be anything you
[1:34:38] do or anything you feel but it'll be by
[1:34:42] the work of the Holy Spirit now what
[1:34:46] does she do she could have stopped it
[1:34:49] said man look at the ridicule what will
[1:34:53] Joseph think what was what was the
[1:34:56] people think what will what kind of how
[1:35:00] will my life change how am i she never
[1:35:04] got an opportunity to be married to
[1:35:06] Joseph without having children sometimes
[1:35:07] it's good to wait a little while so that
[1:35:09] you can become one and get your
[1:35:10] household together before you have a
[1:35:12] child she didn't have that opportunity
[1:35:14] so she maybe thought what things are
[1:35:16] things are different things are gonna be
[1:35:18] different but what does she say be done
[1:35:21] to me according to thy word be done to
[1:35:26] me according to thy word why because she
[1:35:30] was becoming a mother and she was
[1:35:35] willing to go through what she had to go
[1:35:37] through to see the word formed in her
[1:35:40] life and to produce that child and then
[1:35:43] to nurture that child but look at it
[1:35:45] from the other direction look God chose
[1:35:47] Mary to do that because he knew Mary
[1:35:50] would be willing to nurture that child
[1:35:52] somebody had to feed that child somebody
[1:35:56] had to care for it it was just a
[1:35:58] helpless little baby it couldn't feed
[1:36:01] itself it couldn't take care of herself
[1:36:02] somebody had to change its diapers
[1:36:04] somebody had to take care of it somebody
[1:36:06] had to give it a bath somebody had to
[1:36:08] train it somebody had to teach it to
[1:36:10] walk and all the things that a mother
[1:36:11] does somebody had to take Christ and
[1:36:15] make him form him in the flesh man into
[1:36:20] being a man
[1:36:21] look we've been given a great word in
[1:36:24] this hour but as a bride we have a
[1:36:28] responsibility to take that word and let
[1:36:33] it become what's in it in its fullness
[1:36:37] since the mother you don't take your
[1:36:39] child and try to and just change it to
[1:36:40] what you want it to be some mothers do
[1:36:43] you don't do that you don't change it
[1:36:46] said I want you to be this border you do
[1:36:47] you watch what's in it you watch what
[1:36:50] the child already has in it it has a
[1:36:52] seed in it from his father it's got
[1:36:54] something in it that's growing his
[1:36:55] father and mother's DNA and it's growing
[1:36:57] into something you watch that child
[1:36:58] maybe this one's an artist this one's a
[1:37:00] singer this one this is good with math
[1:37:02] and so you look at them and they're
[1:37:04] different but you're able to take that a
[1:37:05] real mother will take that in and grow
[1:37:08] what's inside of that child already
[1:37:10] don't you see we have to do that what's
[1:37:12] the word don't get discouraged you come
[1:37:14] to church there may be a deacon has to
[1:37:16] come to church and didn't get much out
[1:37:17] of the service because all he's doing is
[1:37:19] watching people and trying to make sure
[1:37:20] everyone's comfortable and thanks for
[1:37:22] getting none but what's he doing he's
[1:37:23] taking care of the word maybe a young
[1:37:29] woman comes to church and and she don't
[1:37:31] understand she comes and don't get
[1:37:33] anything out of service because the kids
[1:37:34] and sometimes the dad's dog anything out
[1:37:36] of service because of the kids but what
[1:37:39] are you doing you're nurturing you're
[1:37:40] forming the word hey man keep doing it
[1:37:45] that's my encouragement to you today on
[1:37:48] Mother's Day keep taking care of the
[1:37:50] word keep taking care of your children
[1:37:52] ever Parkes you have to play in the body
[1:37:53] of Christ keep doing it keep walking
[1:37:55] because one of these days you're gonna
[1:37:57] walk with God and you're gonna be not
[1:38:00] hey bad you're gonna walk with God and
[1:38:03] you're just gonna you're gonna change in
[1:38:05] a moment I'm physically ill and I why
[1:38:07] because you've been working the whole
[1:38:08] time being what God has placed in your
[1:38:11] heart God gave you a word God gave us
[1:38:13] the fullness of the word in this hour
[1:38:15] let's let's mold it let's
[1:38:17] let's be as protective as we can be of
[1:38:20] it mother just don't let it run out in
[1:38:22] everything every situation and play
[1:38:24] games with their kids a mother
[1:38:25] don't let her kids run out in front of
[1:38:27] that what do we do we take the word
[1:38:28] that's in our lives and we mold it to be
[1:38:31] in the image of the father God gave it
[1:38:34] to us for a reason that the body of
[1:38:37] Christ could be complete you love him
[1:38:42] this morning
[1:38:43] let's bow our heads motherhood changes
[1:38:53] everything
[1:38:55] receiving the word changes everything
[1:38:58] you say you're a message believer that's
[1:39:01] more than just identifying with a
[1:39:03] prophet but it's saying Lord be it unto
[1:39:08] me according to that word be it unto me
[1:39:11] let me become the word let me change
[1:39:15] however I need to change to take care of
[1:39:19] the word would you just make that your
[1:39:24] prayer today maybe on Mother's Day
[1:39:27] you've never given your heart to Christ
[1:39:29] I want to give you that opportunity I
[1:39:34] think we neglect to do that sometimes in
[1:39:36] a church because we assume everybody is
[1:39:38] saved but you may all be this morning
[1:39:41] but I want to give you the opportunity
[1:39:43] to give you heart to Christ today it's
[1:39:46] Mother's Day not just because your
[1:39:48] mother would want you to though I'm sure
[1:39:49] she would be the greatest honor that you
[1:39:52] could give her but that's not just
[1:39:54] because of that because you feel the
[1:39:58] desire in your heart that word is
[1:40:01] preached you today you feel the desire
[1:40:03] Lord be it unto me according to that
[1:40:06] word
[1:40:08] she just talked to him for a moment Lord
[1:40:10] Lord help me I want to be saved maybe
[1:40:15] you're a Christian today and you kind of
[1:40:19] gotten away you you you get to a place
[1:40:21] where you're frustrated by motherhood if
[1:40:23] we could put it that way you're kind of
[1:40:26] tired of taking care of the word but God
[1:40:30] helped us never to be that way
[1:40:31] and it gets old you know what you need
[1:40:36] to do go back and find Jesus I said
[1:40:40] nothing to my mother and my wife it's so
[1:40:42] tired I'm dealing with kids all day long
[1:40:44] and I could bring her home things and do
[1:40:48] things for that's wonderful but she
[1:40:50] wants to be with me she wants to spend
[1:40:52] time with me and the best thing that I
[1:40:54] could do if I remember to do it is to
[1:40:56] spend time with her if you're frustrated
[1:40:59] by taking care of the church taking care
[1:41:02] of the word and doing things and maybe
[1:41:03] it's just not what you intended for it
[1:41:05] to be it's maybe the church is
[1:41:07] disappointed you people have
[1:41:08] disappointed you why don't you go back
[1:41:11] into a room with Jesus shut the door but
[1:41:16] the veil behind the Holy of Holies
[1:41:18] fallen say lord help me to learn to love
[1:41:22] you like I did it the first if you're a
[1:41:25] Christian today let me love you like I
[1:41:27] did at the beginning let me never become
[1:41:30] jaded people may have treated me wrong
[1:41:32] people may have done things that were
[1:41:33] wrong but let me never become jaded let
[1:41:36] me ever become frustrated and and just
[1:41:38] where I don't care anymore let me care
[1:41:42] for the word in my life
[1:41:44] heavenly father or God we pray I pray
[1:41:49] that way Lord sometimes in the busyness
[1:41:52] of making sure that everything is done
[1:41:54] we forget just to spend time with you
[1:41:57] what Ruth needed to do and she married
[1:42:00] boys
[1:42:02] was immediately begin to spend time with
[1:42:04] him be a wife to it so that she could
[1:42:08] receive the word herself and she could
[1:42:10] become that word oh god we can we can
[1:42:14] give up everything else but we don't
[1:42:15] want to give you up Lord we could give
[1:42:18] up our our time on everything else but
[1:42:21] we don't want to give up our time with
[1:42:24] you we have these precious moments when
[1:42:27] you come in the services we're gathered
[1:42:29] together and it just feels like your
[1:42:31] presence is nearest we have those
[1:42:34] moments in our homes when we get down on
[1:42:35] our knees maybe in our study or in our
[1:42:38] prayer and our devotions maybe in the
[1:42:40] car on the way to work we have just two
[1:42:42] moments when we see all we knows that
[1:42:45] your presence is there everything's
[1:42:47] gonna be okay
[1:42:49] help us to maximize those times or to
[1:42:53] give up everything else but not to give
[1:42:54] you up as this age makes the church an
[1:42:57] essential makes makes meeting with you
[1:43:00] just something that people do an extra
[1:43:05] thing oh come and we realize the
[1:43:07] essential value that we have of coming
[1:43:10] into your chamber closing the door just
[1:43:14] beginning to worship begin to love you
[1:43:17] lord
[1:43:18] that's all our part is we can't change
[1:43:22] ourselves only the seed can do that we
[1:43:26] can't make ourselves to be what you want
[1:43:28] us to be only the seed can do that but
[1:43:30] we can become your word by loving you I
[1:43:33] pray you granted today I pray Lord if
[1:43:38] there's one stuck in that will mentality
[1:43:40] feeling like they're lost all the time
[1:43:42] not knowing if they're saved Oh God help
[1:43:44] them to be married to Christ the word to
[1:43:46] come fully to surrender everything until
[1:43:49] they come right to your presence I pray
[1:43:51] you'd grant it now in Jesus name
[1:43:54] [Music]
