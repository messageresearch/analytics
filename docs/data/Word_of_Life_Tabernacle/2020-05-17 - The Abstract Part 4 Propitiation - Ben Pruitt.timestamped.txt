[38:28] and I understand but you know we believe
[38:32] that no matter what happens we're in
[38:34] God's hands and so we're thankful for

[38:51] like we should you know when we get to
[38:52] heaven we're going to spend a lot of
[38:54] time around each other I think there'll
[38:56] be something special with a mic about
[38:58] those that we knew those who we've spent
[39:01] time with while we were here we saw each
[39:03] other struggles we knew what each what
[39:07] we went through and I came through
[39:09] Laodicean you come through Laodicea
[39:11] there'll be something special about that
[39:13] will be raised even with our own
[39:16] generation with those people that we've
[39:18] known when we see our loved ones we'll
[39:20] see somebody we knew and that's so
[39:22] grateful I'm so grateful for that that
[39:25] I'll be there with you and I'm thankful
[39:28] for that today so we ought to feel like
[39:29] family here and when we come together in
[39:31] the house of the Lord it's so wonderful
[39:33] god bless you turn with me if you would
[39:35] to revelations chapter 5 verse 6 we'll
[39:40] go ahead and read this morning
[39:42] [Music]
[39:43] revelations five and six will also read
[39:47] from first John chapter two and verse
[39:49] two thank you for the music this morning
[39:52] I appreciated sister Alison's song this
[39:55] morning little by little and that song
[39:57] means a lot to me I we should not get
[40:00] discouraged we should remember the
[40:03] miracles it's easy as you're going
[40:05] through the wilderness to be sidetracked
[40:06] by the the Baroness of the place and and
[40:10] and the struggles that you go through
[40:12] just to get water and you know like the
[40:14] children of Israel but they begin to
[40:16] murmur and complain but they had an
[40:17] atonement they had a brass serpent
[40:19] brother Allen spoke so wonderfully on
[40:22] that Wednesday night and if you can get
[40:24] a chance to hear that sermon go back and
[40:26] listen to it it's it's it's wonderful to
[40:29] know that we have a God who's real and
[40:31] and provided an atonement it goes right
[40:33] with what we're going to talk about this
[40:35] morning and so don't be discouraged
[40:37] God's doing things and we've seem doing
[40:40] things in spite of the difficulty he's
[40:42] still moving he's still living he's
[40:44] still the same yesterday today and
[40:46] forever that's not conditioned on how we
[40:47] act or how everybody else acts or the
[40:50] condition of the world it's him he's the
[40:52] same and he if he's the same he can meet
[40:55] our needs this morning and I believe
[40:57] that he will continue to keep in mind
[41:02] that the meetings coming up this weekend
[41:03] about the IV's I'm gonna go and except
[41:05] for Sunday morning we'll have our
[41:06] regular service here but brother Andrew
[41:09] Glover will be there and by the Windell
[41:10] Martin so if you get a chance to go I'm
[41:12] sure they would appreciate it and and it
[41:15] would be a good meeting and get to hear
[41:17] the word of the Lord revelations five
[41:19] and six and I beheld in the midst of the
[41:22] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[41:24] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[41:27] had been slain having seven horns and
[41:31] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[41:33] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[41:37] then first John - and - and he is he is
[41:44] say that with me this morning he is the
[41:48] propitiation for our sins not for ours
[41:53] only but also for the sins
[41:56] of the whole world let's bow our heads
[41:58] together for a word of Prayer if you
[42:01] have a need you'd like to make known but
[42:02] wave uplifted hand this morning I'm sure
[42:04] God sees those needs Heavenly Father as
[42:08] we come and many have raised their hands
[42:10] Lord with needs today I pray God that
[42:13] you would just move on every heart
[42:14] whatever they thought that they had when
[42:16] they raised that hand
[42:18] father there's something that they need
[42:20] from you I pray God that you would meet
[42:21] that need today father we know that
[42:24] you're a healer we know that you're a
[42:25] miracle worker we know that you're the
[42:27] same yesterday today and forever and so
[42:29] we ask you Lord to come and just meet
[42:32] all of our needs and bind us closer
[42:34] together as a family of God Lord may we
[42:37] recognize that each one of us is
[42:39] important in the house of the Lord I
[42:41] pray that you would just move as we
[42:44] settle into the word now it may you
[42:46] cause it to come forth and clarity Lord
[42:49] and without without the ideas of a man
[42:51] but maybe your word today maybe we
[42:53] understand these things though it may
[42:55] seem like we're repeating ourselves over
[42:57] and over but we just want to drive it
[42:59] home Lord how much that you mean to us
[43:01] and what our salvation is and what
[43:04] redemption is and so I pray that you
[43:06] just meet us here today and meet every
[43:09] one of these needs and we'll give you
[43:10] the glory and the honor for it in Jesus
[43:13] name Amen amen god bless you you could
[43:16] be seated this morning
[43:26] we found out that God was the original
[43:31] owner of the title deed to the earth
[43:33] which also is the title deed to our
[43:37] Redemption so it's personal to us the
[43:41] book is a book that we have an interest
[43:44] in and our name is there and so we found
[43:49] out that he was the original owner and
[43:51] that means that if we came from God we
[43:54] can go back to God we could say that a
[43:57] little more clearly if we came from God
[43:59] we will go back to God and we found out
[44:03] that Adam forfeited the title deed to
[44:06] the earth when he walked out with his
[44:08] wife with Eve and so they thought that
[44:11] couple when they left it was a
[44:12] forfeiture and so we looked through and
[44:15] like an abstract that as we turned the
[44:17] page we found that there was loss of
[44:19] title and but yet it couldn't go back to
[44:22] Satan but it had to go back into the
[44:23] hands of the original owner and so God
[44:26] had it in his hand and then so we found
[44:30] out that that meant that it was
[44:31] redeemable and we also found out that it
[44:35] was to come through the line of
[44:36] motherhood that that was to produce a
[44:39] redeemer as we continue this morning
[44:42] examining this abstract we find that a
[44:45] price must be paid to redeem what Adam
[44:49] lost so one of the things that had to be
[44:54] one of the requirements for redeemer is
[44:56] he had to be able to pay the price
[44:59] he had to be able to do it not only just
[45:02] worthy but he had to be able to meet
[45:04] whatever the requirement was and so what
[45:08] Adam lost had to be redeemed and what
[45:11] Adam lost was his position he lost his
[45:14] position also his fellowship he also
[45:18] lost his right to eternal life so these
[45:21] things needed to be restored to us and
[45:24] in the Bible the concept of the price
[45:28] that needed to be paid to appease the
[45:31] wrath of God is called propitiation
[45:35] propitiation it is
[45:37] an old English word that comes from a
[45:40] Greek word alas tree on which means
[45:42] sacrifice of atonement it speaks a
[45:45] propitiation and the idea of sin being
[45:48] done away with
[45:49] it's called expiation I know there's a
[45:51] lot of big words but I had to look them
[45:52] up too so but expiation of sin being
[45:56] cleared away being done away with but
[45:58] propitiation is more than that it's also
[46:00] the removal of God's wrath towards the
[46:03] sinner that God was was angry if we
[46:07] could put it in human terms like God
[46:09] maybe he doesn't get angry like we do
[46:11] but he was he was anger as sin and so he
[46:15] crossed God we God was we could call him
[46:18] the offended party and this is a legal
[46:20] term that propitiation is satisfying the
[46:23] demands of the party that's been
[46:26] offended right and so someone had to
[46:29] make those demands and that was God and
[46:32] this word also speaks of the Hebrew word
[46:34] for mercy seat that that was the
[46:36] profession in the Old Testament so it's
[46:39] the price paid to appease the anger of
[46:41] God but not only that to bring us back
[46:44] in fellowship with God so it's not just
[46:47] to make it where he's okay but to
[46:50] actually bring back that relationship
[46:52] with him again
[46:53] like Adam had in the garden and that's
[46:57] what we want we don't want just our sins
[46:59] covered or well our our sins have been
[47:01] forgiven but we want to please God
[47:04] right we want to please God if we want
[47:06] to please God why do we want to please
[47:08] God because we're his family right we're
[47:11] his family we want to please him we want
[47:13] to be able for the j.t to be near him
[47:15] and and him have the right attitude
[47:17] towards us and and in order to do that
[47:21] we would have to satisfy this terrible
[47:24] gulf this thing that had happened with
[47:26] Adams race now if you were driving in a
[47:31] car you had a passenger in the backseat
[47:33] and you were driving dangerously and you
[47:36] hit a tree and you damaged that person
[47:40] and you would not only hurt that person
[47:43] but you would perhaps hurt that
[47:44] relationship because if you were if you
[47:49] hit a tree and
[47:50] and then that person said well why were
[47:52] you driving that way why did you do that
[47:55] you knew better than to do that you did
[47:58] it anyway so there's been a loss of of
[48:01] your status with them so there's
[48:03] physical damages that would need to be
[48:05] paid but also in order to gain back that
[48:08] relationship you would need to satisfy
[48:11] the John everything they required and it
[48:15] wouldn't be up to you and be up to them
[48:17] right and so it wouldn't be me saying
[48:20] well I'll tell you what I'll give you
[48:21] $100 and you go on no you need to
[48:24] satisfy them somehow they need to be
[48:28] satisfied that it's okay that you made
[48:31] up for this oh my we couldn't do that on
[48:35] our own and if there's anything I want
[48:38] to get to you through these series of
[48:39] messages that said we could not appease
[48:43] God's wrath we couldn't meet God where
[48:45] he was but only about a blood of Jesus
[48:48] Christ and so you can't do it by
[48:52] legalism or by by thinking that well
[48:55] I'll do enough work so I'll be a message
[48:57] person or born in a message family or be
[49:00] a message believer and that will appease
[49:01] God it does not if he's gone but it's
[49:04] only by his sacrifice now so the
[49:11] perpetuation would be the amount paid to
[49:13] satisfy the amount they were required to
[49:15] satisfy the anger of the offended party
[49:19] and restore the relationship so if you
[49:23] take it back to the Old Testament it'd
[49:24] be like the Avenger of blood as they
[49:26] would come out if you'd accidentally
[49:28] killed someone or just by your
[49:30] negligence you'd killed someone a member
[49:32] of their family would be coming after
[49:34] you because it was eye for an eye a
[49:36] tooth for a tooth so they would be
[49:38] coming after you and they'd walk but in
[49:40] return and so what you would need is
[49:43] something that would satisfy them that
[49:46] would make it where they did not require
[49:48] that what would it take and and see God
[49:51] being just once he has required
[49:53] something he can't just lower the
[49:55] requirement right because if he if he
[49:58] did that then the requirement wasn't
[50:00] right in the first place see if I lower
[50:03] the penalty for
[50:04] crime it means that the penalty was too
[50:06] strict to begin with right but now he
[50:11] can't lower the penalty what does he do
[50:13] but he meets the payment he makes the
[50:16] payment so I want you to understand this
[50:20] morning that he who has offended sets
[50:23] the terms for the propitiation now that
[50:25] would help us a lot in our friendships
[50:27] and getting along with people by the way
[50:30] that if you do something to someone then
[50:33] you can't just sit there and say well
[50:34] now I'll make the terms of getting us
[50:36] getting back together No you've got to
[50:38] accept that you to be a friend you've
[50:40] got to be friendly right and so you've
[50:43] got to kind of accept their whatever
[50:45] they're willing to take if that makes
[50:46] sense within reason right but but yet
[50:50] there's there's part of you if you
[50:52] really want to be their friend and
[50:53] that's true of marriage is wealth you
[50:55] really want to stay together there's
[50:57] times you're gonna have to move a long
[50:58] ways from where you are to do that
[51:01] you've got to make a lot of sacrifices
[51:02] because you've got to satisfy the
[51:04] offended party it's not not up to you
[51:08] it's when they're satisfied of Genesis
[51:12] 2:16 says the Lord God commanded the man
[51:14] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[51:16] mayest freely eat but of the tree of the
[51:17] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[51:19] not eat of it from the day that thou
[51:21] eatest serve thou so surely died so he's
[51:23] saying that here he's saying here's what
[51:26] you could do to offend me here's what
[51:30] you could do to break the contract
[51:32] here's the only thing that you could do
[51:35] I'm giving you a perfect place I'm
[51:38] putting a perfect way before you but
[51:40] here the Joe's the only thing you could
[51:42] do to mess it up and guess what we did
[51:44] it and then that the way it usually goes
[51:49] with our lives that it seems like that
[51:51] if there's one thing that we can do to
[51:53] mess it up we do that and so they did
[51:58] that and it was an offense to God and if
[52:03] we could put it again in human terms
[52:04] realizing that God does it doesn't think
[52:07] like we do but but if we could put it in
[52:09] humans terms it's human terms that says
[52:11] this God has offended and so it's
[52:15] attitude towards mankind
[52:17] to change because you cannot let them
[52:21] inherit eternal life anymore you cannot
[52:24] let them stay in the Garden of Eden and
[52:27] so we find that we become offensive to
[52:30] God in that way because of sin and as
[52:34] human beings and I'm not talking about
[52:36] you as a predestinated seed of God but
[52:38] I'm talking about you as a human being
[52:40] as a human being you're born offensive
[52:42] to God and David realizes that because
[52:47] when he said and did what he did he said
[52:49] a gift see and the only have I sent now
[52:53] when we think in natural relationships
[52:54] brother Brown said you need to apologize
[52:56] to her
[52:56] because it's her you you did the wrong
[52:58] against but but in this case David
[53:01] realizes that ultimately to restore his
[53:04] fellowship with God he's got to make it
[53:06] right with God and in ultimately you
[53:14] know people can say what they want to
[53:15] and people will say what they want to
[53:17] and people will talk I don't understand
[53:20] that I don't understand I was speaking
[53:22] with someone here Friday and I don't
[53:24] understand people that don't want to see
[53:26] the best in someone
[53:28] I just don't can't comprehend people
[53:31] that don't want to see good in somebody
[53:33] I don't want to hope that they'll get
[53:35] better why would you ever want to throw
[53:39] somebody down on the pit and keep
[53:40] knocking him back down it doesn't make
[53:44] sense and it's not the Spirit of Christ
[53:46] but David realizes in order to be right
[53:50] he said it gives seeing the only have I
[53:52] sinned he sinned against your eyes
[53:54] sinned against bad she big sinned
[53:56] against the nation but he said against
[53:58] seeing the only have I sinned and done
[54:00] this evil in that sight that that might
[54:02] has to be justified when thou speakest
[54:03] and be clear when the judges he said
[54:05] Lord it's me I'm not going to make a
[54:08] defense I'm not gonna say it's me and I
[54:11] end but he goes even further he said
[54:13] behold I was shapen in iniquity so it's
[54:16] not just that I did what I did but I
[54:18] come into the world speaking rise in sin
[54:21] did my mother conceive me so God you are
[54:24] offended with me before time McGee but
[54:27] when I was born at the moment that I was
[54:30] born you were offended
[54:31] because you were offended with what Adam
[54:33] did what Eve did and I was identified
[54:37] with that you see we begin to sin before
[54:41] we even know how a child who has the
[54:46] Ricci age of accountability might may
[54:48] not be accountable for their actions but
[54:49] they're still sinners and the fact that
[54:52] they go to heaven as the baby for baby
[54:54] dies it goes to heaven but the round
[54:55] taught us that but it's the fact that if
[54:57] it does it goes to heaven is because of
[54:59] the blood of Jesus Christ it's because
[55:04] if it's more than just born in this
[55:05] world it's a sinner they're still
[55:08] sinners they need a propitiation they
[55:11] need somebody to meet that that debt but
[55:16] the random talks about a he said some
[55:18] time ago a chaplain told me he found a
[55:20] man laying on the field an officer and
[55:21] he'd been machine gun across his chest
[55:23] he was dying he said captain you're
[55:26] dying and through the struggles he said
[55:29] I know I am he said do you know God he
[55:32] said I used to he said well go back to
[55:34] where you left him go back to where you
[55:38] left him and there you'll find him again
[55:39] that'd be something for us wouldn't it
[55:42] you've got to go back where you left him
[55:44] so many people can't come back to God
[55:46] because they don't want to go back that
[55:48] far he said go back to where you left
[55:53] him and there you'll find him again and
[55:55] the captain dying said I just can't
[55:57] think right now
[55:57] the chaplain said you better think for
[56:00] your lungs were fastly filling with your
[56:01] own blood and you're dying captain they
[56:04] begin to try to think after a while a
[56:06] smile come over his face he said old
[56:09] chaplain
[56:10] I remember now where I left him I
[56:14] remember now where I left him he said
[56:17] start from right there captain he said
[56:20] all right chaplain he raised his highest
[56:22] or heaven he started like this now I lay
[56:25] me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul
[56:29] to keep
[56:29] and if I should die before I wake I pray
[56:32] the Lord my soul to take and he died
[56:34] where did he leave him at the cradle
[56:38] that's where he found him at the cradle
[56:43] he hadn't even thought of God in between
[56:46] the time but he had to go back where he
[56:47] left him so wherever you leave him
[56:51] that's where you'll find him listen to
[56:54] this he will never walk in sin with you
[56:59] he will never walk in sin with you you
[57:03] might be a good American or a good
[57:05] church member but God will never walk in
[57:08] sin with any person or any nation people
[57:14] ready for this nation to come back and
[57:16] be prosperous and be great again
[57:17] God will never walk in sin with any
[57:21] nation or any Church he cannot tolerate
[57:25] sin it's an evil horrible stink in his
[57:28] nostrils he will not do it and no amount
[57:32] of personal holiness that you could do
[57:34] no amount of I'm living around doing I'm
[57:36] doing everything just the way I'm
[57:37] supposed to I got my long sleeves from
[57:39] along here and everything's just right
[57:40] no amount of that but a gypsy could ever
[57:42] redeem you and bring you back to where
[57:45] you can have these rights to this title
[57:47] again but it takes a man it takes a
[57:52] profession that God makes Genesis 3:23
[57:58] says therefore the Lord God sent him
[58:02] forth from the Garden of Eden to till
[58:04] the ground from whence he was taken so
[58:07] he drove out the man the same man that
[58:11] he went to sought out that God sought
[58:15] out in the cool of the evening the same
[58:19] one who he looked for brother Joe to
[58:21] have fellowship with him he looked for
[58:24] him he said I want to I want to be with
[58:25] you I want to I want to spend time with
[58:28] you in the cool of evening that same God
[58:31] now after the chasm has been breached
[58:35] after the sin has been committed
[58:37] he drives him from the garden he placed
[58:41] at the east of the Garden of the Eden
[58:43] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[58:46] turned every way to keep the way of the
[58:50] Tree of Life
[58:52] but the RAM said that tree of life in
[58:54] the Garden of Eden which could not be
[58:56] approached
[58:56] - because of the fall of Adam I love
[59:00] this is now given to the overcomer 3bet
[59:05] he said to the overcomer in the
[59:07] efficient church age I'll give the Tree
[59:09] of Life amen and so they sound given to
[59:13] the overcomer
[59:14] he said the flaming sword of the
[59:16] guarding cherubim has been sheathed but
[59:19] it was not sheath Eric's blood was
[59:21] bloody its blade was bloody with the
[59:24] blood of the Lamb and so we have a world
[59:30] today that's relying the church world
[59:33] today is relying upon the death of
[59:35] Christ as we are but not recognizing
[59:39] you're realizing that you've got to come
[59:41] under that blood you've got to come in
[59:44] to that word you've got to come in to
[59:46] that that body because if you don't
[59:50] you'll find yourself actually rejecting
[59:52] the very sacrifice that you need and so
[59:56] the world relies on that it's as well
[59:58] God loves me or he wouldn't have died
[1:00:01] for me and it's true but it's only those
[1:00:04] who accept him see you've got to accept
[1:00:09] what he did and walk in him and that
[1:00:14] sounds pretty simple and but you see so
[1:00:16] many people today and I think in message
[1:00:18] circles we don't understand like we
[1:00:20] should because so many people come to
[1:00:22] God like I'm a beggar and and I realized
[1:00:25] that we should come to God desperately
[1:00:27] but desperate for what purpose desperate
[1:00:30] to do away with this desperate for the
[1:00:33] flesh to be killed
[1:00:35] that's what waved the way we come to God
[1:00:37] we don't come to God desperate for God
[1:00:40] to move because he is moving he is
[1:00:44] moving he's the atonements already been
[1:00:46] made healing is already ours what are we
[1:00:50] just before it's not to pull God down as
[1:00:52] a Pentecostal Church would to try to
[1:00:54] work something up until God would come
[1:00:56] down but it's actually to meet God where
[1:01:00] he has already come to we're meeting God
[1:01:04] in that place where he already is
[1:01:06] Oh church and he's sitting there waiting
[1:01:09] for you this morning if you left him
[1:01:11] come back where you left him you can't
[1:01:17] come back to what people want you to be
[1:01:20] or want you to do you come back to his
[1:01:22] requirements so they left the garden
[1:01:27] with the propitiation of the lambs blood
[1:01:30] he he saw them leaving in the heart of
[1:01:33] God but the brendham talks about that
[1:01:35] how that the heart of God wouldn't let
[1:01:36] him stay that way so he had to make a
[1:01:40] provision and God's anger would be
[1:01:44] satisfied for a season by the blood of
[1:01:48] the Lamb but it could not restore
[1:01:50] seller's now but God did not just
[1:01:56] leave it like that but he said there
[1:01:57] will be one who had bruised the head of
[1:01:59] the serpent who would satisfy the wrath
[1:02:02] of God and this is the propitiation in
[1:02:06] Hebrews 11 and 4 it says my faith Abel
[1:02:10] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:02:11] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[1:02:14] witness that he was righteous God
[1:02:16] testifying of his gifts and we have no
[1:02:19] record that Abel and Cain lived any
[1:02:21] differently before that other than that
[1:02:24] one kept the garden and one kept the
[1:02:27] Sheep right and so other than that we
[1:02:31] have no record that they were almost in
[1:02:33] sin and the other one wasn't one went
[1:02:36] out and party to say I came went out to
[1:02:38] the bar and on Saturday night and then
[1:02:39] come to church Cain was religious he was
[1:02:43] religious he'd come to church this i
[1:02:44] cabled it he acted just like Abel did he
[1:02:47] had all the fundamentals just like Abel
[1:02:49] did but Abel by revelation it was just
[1:02:52] something in him that knew that God
[1:02:54] required something more than just good
[1:02:57] works he required something more than
[1:03:00] flowers he required something more than
[1:03:02] fruit he required something more he
[1:03:04] required blood because it was the blood
[1:03:06] that got messed up and so he required
[1:03:08] blood now you acquired the life now it
[1:03:13] says that God testifying of his gifts so
[1:03:16] hey boy what your brain satisfies me
[1:03:20] it pleases me and the Bible says that
[1:03:24] God accepted his offering and he
[1:03:27] rejected Cain's and Cain understood he
[1:03:32] was close enough to under two God to
[1:03:34] understand that he was rejected and many
[1:03:39] people aren't even aren't even able to
[1:03:41] do that today they don't understand they
[1:03:44] come and offering their deceit but Cain
[1:03:46] knew that there was a difference between
[1:03:49] him and Abel he knew that the sacrifices
[1:03:52] were different and it made him angry
[1:03:54] changed his countenance why because God
[1:03:56] was not pleased with him now but the
[1:04:00] Bible says seeing that the two boys
[1:04:02] trying to find favor with God to come
[1:04:05] back and that's what we want this
[1:04:07] morning we won't favor with God that's
[1:04:09] why we all come but there could be two
[1:04:12] people come both of them won't favor
[1:04:14] with God but one of them comes under the
[1:04:16] blood one does not who finds favor with
[1:04:18] God only the one who comes under the
[1:04:20] blood you know I can't come under my own
[1:04:23] merits I've got to come under the blood
[1:04:27] so now he said the two boys trying to
[1:04:29] find favor with God to come back because
[1:04:31] they knew they were just as fresh just
[1:04:33] fresh from the garden of life and they
[1:04:35] had fell on the other side by the
[1:04:36] transgression of their parents and made
[1:04:38] them subject to death just like we all
[1:04:40] stand this morning subjects to death and
[1:04:43] they wanted to know how to get back into
[1:04:45] that place where they could find life
[1:04:48] again and in doing so they were trying
[1:04:52] to find favor with God and Cain offered
[1:04:56] a beautiful sacrifice the flowers and
[1:04:59] the fruits of the field or whatever it
[1:05:00] was he put on the altar but Abel by
[1:05:03] spiritual revelation revealed to him
[1:05:05] that it was not the fruit of the field
[1:05:07] that caused the death it was blood that
[1:05:09] caused the death so he offered back
[1:05:11] blood of an innocent substitute and God
[1:05:14] accepted it and that has been God's
[1:05:17] propitiation for our sins
[1:05:19] ever since that very day no other way
[1:05:23] because if he had accepted on any other
[1:05:25] basis then we'd have had to come to that
[1:05:28] basis to find favor with god but God
[1:05:31] accepted only the innocent blood
[1:05:33] of an innocent subject I like this he
[1:05:37] said therefore if the beauty and the big
[1:05:38] places would have been God's acceptance
[1:05:40] today we'd have wondered would he come
[1:05:43] back on the backside of the desert to
[1:05:45] this little home sitting here by the
[1:05:46] railroad track we could put ourselves in
[1:05:48] there if it had been big places that God
[1:05:50] accepted what do you have come to Hardy
[1:05:52] Arkansas would he have come to this
[1:05:54] little church would Eve come to us who
[1:05:56] were lost in sins and trespasses would
[1:05:58] he have come to us who had no education
[1:06:00] or nothing that the world could speak of
[1:06:02] what do you come to us on the backside
[1:06:04] of the desert will he come back here and
[1:06:06] meet with us but if it had been a great
[1:06:08] Cathedral or the beauty that Cain
[1:06:10] offered why we'd find we've just been
[1:06:12] talking to ourselves and to the air but
[1:06:16] God came on the basis of the shed blood
[1:06:19] so no matter today how small we are how
[1:06:23] poor we are how much we would like to be
[1:06:25] offered a God a greater place but God
[1:06:28] wouldn't accept it no more than he will
[1:06:29] right now because we're coming on the
[1:06:31] basis of the shed blood of an innocent
[1:06:34] substitute with just Christ dying for us
[1:06:37] sinners hey man you can't get the gospel
[1:06:41] much clearer than that Romans 3:23 for
[1:06:46] all have sinned
[1:06:48] it doesn't say all will sin all have
[1:06:53] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] he said that's Baptist theology no
[1:06:59] that's the Bible right it's not bad
[1:07:02] discuss the Bible being justified freely
[1:07:06] by His grace through the redemption that
[1:07:08] is in Christ Jesus
[1:07:10] God has set forth to be a propitiation
[1:07:14] through faith in his blood to declare
[1:07:18] his righteousness for the remission of
[1:07:22] sins that are past through the
[1:07:24] forbearance of God so it was just the
[1:07:27] forbearance of God that was working in
[1:07:29] the Old Testament the forbearance of God
[1:07:31] still works today it still works with
[1:07:33] those who are not saved it worked with
[1:07:36] us before we were saved the forbearance
[1:07:38] of God God didn't judge us like we were
[1:07:40] aren't you glad he didn't but he saw
[1:07:43] there was something else he knew there
[1:07:45] was something else on the inside too by
[1:07:46] his for now
[1:07:47] he predestinated us and and so we were
[1:07:49] the seed of God but you could say even
[1:07:51] the world benefits from the forbearance
[1:07:53] of God and God is long-suffering and
[1:07:57] today people don't want to think about
[1:07:59] God being angry with them they don't
[1:08:02] want to think about God actually
[1:08:04] actually having a an attitude towards
[1:08:07] them that sin is wrong but yet you don't
[1:08:12] understand that without it if God is
[1:08:15] only a God of love I read something the
[1:08:17] other day where I said my God is not
[1:08:18] like your God my God is all love
[1:08:20] well my God is all love too but he's
[1:08:23] also a God of justice and so to be God
[1:08:27] at all he has to be a righteous God he
[1:08:31] got to be perfect to be God right and so
[1:08:34] in order to be a righteous God it means
[1:08:37] that he still has wrath if we could put
[1:08:39] it again in human terms
[1:08:41] he still has anger and we find that the
[1:08:44] vials of Revelation is worse we find
[1:08:47] that that's the wrath of God poured out
[1:08:48] on the earth now look all that time he
[1:08:51] stores it up he waits he for bears and
[1:08:54] he lets people live unless people go
[1:08:57] about their business and people think
[1:08:59] that because I'm ok well I went out and
[1:09:02] many times young people make that
[1:09:03] mistake they leave church and they go
[1:09:05] out for a while and they begin to ask
[1:09:07] the more they do they realize well God's
[1:09:09] okay with that I haven't been judged and
[1:09:11] so maybe I'll start doing something I
[1:09:13] didn't used to do and they go a little
[1:09:15] further and they go a little further and
[1:09:16] pretty soon they get into something that
[1:09:18] well God forgives me God loves me I can
[1:09:20] still go to church but you don't realize
[1:09:23] that it's the forbearance of God it's
[1:09:25] because God loves you then he doesn't
[1:09:27] strike you but he won't strike you
[1:09:29] because there come there's coming a day
[1:09:31] for judgment there's coming a day when
[1:09:33] the forbearance of God will be lifted
[1:09:37] there's coming a day for those things to
[1:09:40] take place you know people can wish
[1:09:42] something bad on somebody who did
[1:09:43] something evil to them I don't ever wish
[1:09:45] that because if you're evil to me I want
[1:09:49] you to be saved I want you to be changed
[1:09:53] because there's not a person on this
[1:09:55] earth that I want to go through the
[1:09:57] tribulation period and people if you
[1:09:59] think we're already in the
[1:10:00] period people don't understand it's a
[1:10:03] whole lot worse than this we see how the
[1:10:07] world was disrupted by one virus think
[1:10:11] about what's gonna happen when the wrath
[1:10:12] of God is poured out we see what
[1:10:15] happened in the first world war in the
[1:10:16] Second World War in the tragedy that
[1:10:17] happened during that time think what's
[1:10:19] going to happen beyond mercy this is
[1:10:22] during mercy this is during the
[1:10:25] forbearance of God when in the first
[1:10:28] world war even instructed the Angels
[1:10:29] hold back the winds don't destroy the
[1:10:34] earth at this time with those chemical
[1:10:36] gases and things that they end up
[1:10:37] science that unleashed on the earth
[1:10:39] don't destroy the Earth's at this time
[1:10:41] what was it ghost forbearance but he's
[1:10:44] made a propitiation a way to satisfy his
[1:10:47] wrath its judgment but they're coming
[1:10:49] today when the propitiation will be
[1:10:51] pulled back there'll be no more offering
[1:10:53] for sin there'll be no more sacrifices
[1:10:55] of mercy to become brass and then all
[1:10:57] the sudden it becomes a judgement seat
[1:10:58] and when it does there's no more mercy
[1:11:01] and we'll have to be gone because we
[1:11:06] need mercy are you with me now to
[1:11:15] declare his righteousness and
[1:11:17] righteousness for the remission of sins
[1:11:18] that are past through the forbearance of
[1:11:20] God to declare us at this time his
[1:11:22] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:11:25] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:11:27] Jesus where is boasting then it is
[1:11:32] excluded it is excluded well you don't
[1:11:39] understand the family I belong to it is
[1:11:41] excluded you don't understand what my
[1:11:45] church and how how many generations
[1:11:46] we've been in the message and how long
[1:11:48] we've known about these things it is
[1:11:49] excluded where is boasting every one of
[1:11:53] us has to come into the same shed blood
[1:11:55] many times I've seen our brother in
[1:11:57] Africa that they begin to think well I
[1:11:59] need to find some brother in America
[1:12:00] that I can be like it and be like them
[1:12:02] and make our church like theirs and then
[1:12:04] we can we can sit under them and it's
[1:12:06] fine to have examples to go by but many
[1:12:09] times they and I found myself preaching
[1:12:10] over and over to them you're under the
[1:12:12] same blood that I'm
[1:12:13] you share the same Redemption that I
[1:12:15] share there's no difference the message
[1:12:19] come in my language but you can receive
[1:12:21] the same Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:12:24] didn't come in my language but the
[1:12:28] message come in my language and then saw
[1:12:30] I think we ought to be a help anytime we
[1:12:31] can but the Holy Ghost come and it made
[1:12:34] them speaking they're here in their own
[1:12:36] language hey Ben amen
[1:12:40] so where is boasting boasting is
[1:12:42] excluded it's excluded I know I'm kind
[1:12:47] of bearing down on that this morning but
[1:12:48] I just feel that that we need to
[1:12:50] understand that I'm not just us but just
[1:12:52] and how we deal with people boasting is
[1:12:54] excluded well I've been able to live
[1:12:57] this way all of my life and do these
[1:12:59] things boasting is excluded if you've
[1:13:02] been able to live that way it's because
[1:13:03] God let you live that way God maybe give
[1:13:06] you good parents and gave you a good
[1:13:08] life and a good home to grow up in thank
[1:13:11] God for that
[1:13:12] boasting is excluded by what law of
[1:13:16] works name but by the law of faith
[1:13:20] therefore he says we conclude that a man
[1:13:24] is justified by faith without the deeds
[1:13:28] of the law now brother Branham says this
[1:13:34] and I've seen this so many times and
[1:13:37] sometimes it it's me as well that begin
[1:13:40] to pray in a way that it says if God you
[1:13:43] need to heal me God I need to be
[1:13:46] forgiven I had someone come one time and
[1:13:48] a young person in a prayer line and tell
[1:13:51] me that she said I just want God to
[1:13:53] forgive me and instead of praying for
[1:13:56] immediately I said you know God has
[1:13:58] forgiven you
[1:14:00] he made a way you just have to come to
[1:14:02] it and so it seemed people to pray and
[1:14:06] pray and pray for God to forgive them
[1:14:08] but God has forgiven he has made away
[1:14:11] he's made a propitiation that's what
[1:14:13] perpetuation is all about I just have to
[1:14:16] accept it at his terms right he's the
[1:14:20] one that signed the letter he saw on
[1:14:22] that that made the deal have you ever
[1:14:25] been involved in the legal
[1:14:26] system he's the one he's the one that
[1:14:28] made the deal he said you can go Frank
[1:14:31] he said you can be justified he said
[1:14:35] it'll be as though you never did it in
[1:14:36] the first place but you've got to
[1:14:38] brother Caleb accept that deal and when
[1:14:43] you accept it you abide by the terms of
[1:14:45] it Oh hope you're with me now
[1:14:48] when you accept it you abide by the
[1:14:50] terms out what is that repent and be
[1:14:51] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:14:53] Jesus Christ and you shall receive
[1:14:55] the Holy Ghost now look he said it
[1:14:59] remember those people goes around saying
[1:15:01] I got power to heal you that guy is
[1:15:02] telling you a lie he has no power to
[1:15:05] heal you Christ has already done it he
[1:15:08] said oh by confession of sins and so
[1:15:10] forth some priests being Minister
[1:15:12] forgiving your sins no sir your sins are
[1:15:14] already forgiven when Christ died on the
[1:15:17] cross he said it is finished what the
[1:15:19] complete plan everything Christ get it
[1:15:22] at the cross he said you're already
[1:15:24] saved every sinner saved I think about
[1:15:28] potentially every sinner saved if
[1:15:30] they'll accept it but there's got to be
[1:15:32] something in you to accept it every
[1:15:35] sinner saved but it'll never do you any
[1:15:37] good until you accept it he said you get
[1:15:40] down there at the altar and scream and
[1:15:42] cried you get gray-headed and your hairs
[1:15:43] fall out that's already happened to me
[1:15:46] so crying - you get great headed and
[1:15:49] your hair's fine it'll never do any good
[1:15:51] until you believe it's not the length of
[1:15:55] time you spend at the altar and people
[1:15:56] misunderstand I've said this before but
[1:15:58] that you don't come to the altar for
[1:16:00] that reason to get anything you come to
[1:16:02] the altar to give something you come to
[1:16:04] the altar to give up yourself you come
[1:16:06] to the altar I believe in an altar call
[1:16:08] I believe in God moving in that way but
[1:16:10] you come to the altar for that purpose
[1:16:11] to give up yourself
[1:16:12] even when you have a little hands laid
[1:16:14] on you you wouldn't have to have that to
[1:16:15] be healed but the reason you come is
[1:16:18] because you're coming in obedience to
[1:16:19] God's Word they lay hands on the sick
[1:16:22] and they shall recover
[1:16:23] so in all you're surrendering yourself
[1:16:25] to the Word of God and you're just
[1:16:26] coming and letting allowing yourself to
[1:16:28] come in that path and God heals you I
[1:16:32] read an article today and that's not
[1:16:34] just limited to message believers I read
[1:16:37] an article this morning about how the
[1:16:39] science has
[1:16:40] and peer-reviewed medical study said if
[1:16:42] the hands are laid on someone in the
[1:16:43] name of Jesus Christ that healing takes
[1:16:45] place they prove that it's true if we
[1:16:51] could just believe that today people
[1:16:54] just come according to according to
[1:16:55] God's Word not even message believers or
[1:16:58] anything that I know I but they come
[1:16:59] that way and they did a study in Africa
[1:17:01] if those people went hands were later on
[1:17:03] deaf and dumb people actually begin to
[1:17:05] receive their begin to receive the
[1:17:07] ability to talk and the ability to hear
[1:17:09] after hands were later on my it's faith
[1:17:11] they believe what God said so it's not
[1:17:17] just limited to us but if we can believe
[1:17:19] that today we could believe I'm coming
[1:17:21] God according to your word I'm not just
[1:17:23] coming as because it's something that I
[1:17:25] can do but I'm coming because I'm
[1:17:27] surrendering myself to you I'm not
[1:17:30] coming necessary to get but to give to
[1:17:32] give myself away so that I can be you
[1:17:35] can move through my life see he said
[1:17:38] it'll never do any good to you except in
[1:17:40] you you can get down there at the altar
[1:17:41] and scream Christ you get gray-headed
[1:17:43] and your hairs fall out it'll never do
[1:17:44] it any good until you believe believe
[1:17:46] that Christ died in your step and he
[1:17:48] died a propitiation for your sins
[1:17:51] when you accept him as your Savior then
[1:17:54] salvation comes to you same thing by
[1:17:59] healing he was wounded for our
[1:18:00] transgressions with His stripes we are
[1:18:04] healed
[1:18:06] now when you come and you accept that
[1:18:08] propitiation there's some effects go
[1:18:11] with that there's an effective
[1:18:13] propitiation so it's not it doesn't
[1:18:16] happen in a vacuum right if you accepted
[1:18:20] that legal document that legal term this
[1:18:23] is what God's requiring for Proficient
[1:18:26] to bring me back into fellowship then
[1:18:28] then I'm bound to that and as a
[1:18:33] Christian we become a low slave to
[1:18:35] Christ and that means that we accept all
[1:18:39] of the work and that's how you know if
[1:18:42] someone's truly come to Christ and
[1:18:43] accepted the perpetuation because
[1:18:46] they'll follow all of the work that make
[1:18:49] a mistake they'll come right back and
[1:18:50] follow the work now when you accept the
[1:18:54] appreciation it does not simply expiate
[1:18:57] as we said you're saying or do away with
[1:18:58] it
[1:18:58] but it brings you back in fellowship
[1:19:00] that's in effect a propitiation and
[1:19:04] brother branham explained it this way
[1:19:05] said now the sale of the spirit life
[1:19:07] lays in the blood and when the blood
[1:19:09] cell of a lamb or an animal was broken
[1:19:11] the life that was in that cell could not
[1:19:13] come back upon the worshipper because it
[1:19:14] was an animal and we are a human being
[1:19:16] we are different the animal doesn't have
[1:19:19] a soul it's hard to tell some people
[1:19:21] that you know my kids love animals it's
[1:19:25] a good thing the mammals don't have a
[1:19:26] soul all them fish they play with while
[1:19:28] I'm fishing and kill that did be in
[1:19:30] trouble for that but the human being has
[1:19:35] a soul the spirit could not come back on
[1:19:38] the animal
[1:19:39] God's Spirit could not come back that
[1:19:41] turtle is never gonna be saved Esther
[1:19:44] the animal doesn't have a soul the
[1:19:46] spirit could not come back on him after
[1:19:48] he made his offering but yet he made it
[1:19:49] now he's talking in the Old Testament
[1:19:51] the worshiper would come and kill the
[1:19:53] animal and the life of the animal could
[1:19:55] not come back on the worshiper he made
[1:19:58] his offering he said and sincerely
[1:20:00] speaking with faith that he believed
[1:20:01] that perfect offering was coming but
[1:20:04] when the blood cell was broken Jesus
[1:20:06] Christ God was released well however you
[1:20:11] can't put it much simpler than that can
[1:20:13] you
[1:20:13] when the blood cell was broken in Jesus
[1:20:17] Christ God was released see he was
[1:20:20] caught that blood wasn't Jewish
[1:20:23] that blood wasn't Gentile that was a
[1:20:25] creative blood cell God himself
[1:20:28] hey man it's amazing that people could
[1:20:32] teach otherwise teaching the message
[1:20:34] because it's amazing to me because
[1:20:36] brother Branham deals with this I'm not
[1:20:38] purposely dealing with the Godhead but
[1:20:40] you deal with it almost every week you
[1:20:43] just have to read a few quotes you're
[1:20:45] gonna find what brother Branham talks
[1:20:46] about God Jesus being God it doesn't
[1:20:49] take long right he said God was really
[1:20:52] see he was gone that blood wasn't Jewish
[1:20:54] that blood wasn't Gentiles created blood
[1:20:56] so God himself he said announcer that
[1:20:58] blood making a propitiation for our sins
[1:21:00] cleanse us the believer takes all of his
[1:21:04] sins away from him as if he had never
[1:21:06] sent
[1:21:07] hey bad well I'm so grateful for that
[1:21:10] God puts him in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:21:13] now someone said he put a sign up and
[1:21:16] said no fishing no fishing in the sea of
[1:21:19] forgetfulness you're not allowed to go
[1:21:22] back and bring it up Bible says it this
[1:21:25] way who shall lay anything to the charge
[1:21:26] of God's elect it is God that justifies
[1:21:30] we're not allowed to go back and bring
[1:21:32] it up God God puts it in the sea of
[1:21:34] forgetfulness
[1:21:35] hey bad God lets him to see if
[1:21:38] forgetfulness and the same God that was
[1:21:43] upon Jesus Christ continues in the
[1:21:45] believer doing the same works that he
[1:21:47] did here for it's the same spirit so now
[1:21:52] this is the effect of propitiation it's
[1:21:54] not just doesn't just happen in a vacuum
[1:21:55] it's not just well I come and accepted
[1:21:57] Christ and now I'm able to live any way
[1:21:59] I want to but it's his spirit comes back
[1:22:01] on me when I am saved then I become a
[1:22:06] part of God in the sense that his Spirit
[1:22:09] comes on me I have a measure of the same
[1:22:12] God that he is in his fullness God puts
[1:22:15] my sins and the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:22:17] in the same God that was upon Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ continues in the believer doing
[1:22:21] the same works that he did here it's the
[1:22:23] same spirit but I want to tell you
[1:22:27] Church and just to kind of kind of walk
[1:22:31] through this for a moment and we're
[1:22:34] plenty early and we have some time but I
[1:22:37] want to tell you that a lot of times we
[1:22:40] look for big things and and just
[1:22:44] speaking from experience that I have and
[1:22:46] some of you have much more experience
[1:22:47] than I do but many times it's not the
[1:22:49] people who have the greatest experiences
[1:22:52] with God that lasts but it's people who
[1:22:57] come to God sanely and realizing what
[1:22:59] they're doing they come to God and give
[1:23:02] themselves to Christ and and maybe you
[1:23:04] never really see anything other than
[1:23:06] their life changed and I've told you
[1:23:10] before but one of the greatest
[1:23:11] testimonies I ever heard of by the JT's
[1:23:13] stepson that that told me that he said
[1:23:16] he said you know he said I was there he
[1:23:19] said when Dad
[1:23:20] I'm a Christian this is many years ago
[1:23:22] now and he was helping me move up here
[1:23:24] in West Plains and he's told me I said I
[1:23:26] haven't seen you at church lately and I
[1:23:28] was hoping that you'd come back and he
[1:23:30] said well you know he said I don't want
[1:23:31] to be a I'd only be fake
[1:23:33] he said don't want to be a hypocrite and
[1:23:35] I said brother we all are at some point
[1:23:37] we've got to come in an atmosphere we
[1:23:39] can come back to God and Steve said but
[1:23:42] but brother JT is he said when he called
[1:23:45] him dad he said when dad when dad got
[1:23:48] saved he said I knew it he said he quit
[1:23:51] drinking he quit doing what he was doing
[1:23:54] he was a different person what a
[1:23:57] testimony for a young person to bring we
[1:24:00] got saved something changes and now
[1:24:05] that's the struggle for some of us
[1:24:06] because the JT some of us were born in
[1:24:08] the message dad didn't let me drink I
[1:24:13] wasn't allowed to smoke and and I was
[1:24:17] raised very strict and so I wasn't I
[1:24:20] didn't go out and do those things I
[1:24:21] never developed a taste for those things
[1:24:22] I still needed to be saved I still
[1:24:25] needed an experience with God but
[1:24:27] sometimes we don't have that clarity of
[1:24:29] one and it becomes a mental battle that
[1:24:31] Satan uses against you because you just
[1:24:33] you don't have that or maybe been a
[1:24:34] Christian for a long time and you just
[1:24:36] seems like you're plotting you're just
[1:24:37] going along and see well I remember one
[1:24:39] time I was saved I was changed but now I
[1:24:40] just don't seem like anything's
[1:24:42] happening but what God does he does and
[1:24:44] ways many times we don't even understand
[1:24:46] and we find ourselves changed years
[1:24:49] later and look back and say I'm not the
[1:24:51] husband that I was not the father that I
[1:24:54] was I'm not the Christian that I was
[1:24:56] I've moved on
[1:24:58] God has grown me into what I am today
[1:25:01] and so that's another reason why we give
[1:25:04] everybody grace because you look at
[1:25:05] somebody say well they've never really
[1:25:07] had an experience with God like we have
[1:25:08] but give them grace that they can move
[1:25:10] on because there's still time left for
[1:25:12] them but I would tell you if you're
[1:25:14] purposely delaying coming to Christ
[1:25:16] don't wait because we're at the end but
[1:25:21] many times we can't tell him sister
[1:25:23] Bruce had an interview with brother
[1:25:24] Branham and she I'm glad that they kept
[1:25:28] this where we could read it because it's
[1:25:30] important that we understand that it's
[1:25:32] not always the big things
[1:25:34] and she says well I make so many
[1:25:35] mistakes and brother Branham says that's
[1:25:37] why Christ had to die so that you with
[1:25:40] your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you
[1:25:41] he took your mistakes your desire and
[1:25:45] your hardest to serve him I don't know
[1:25:49] if I have as much faith brother Perry
[1:25:50] green he used to say that he would God
[1:25:52] would never allow him to meet a person
[1:25:53] that wasn't predestinated he said
[1:25:55] because God doesn't waste Peregrine's
[1:25:57] time well I'm not sure I have that much
[1:26:00] faith but the RAM talks about three
[1:26:02] kinds of believers but you know what
[1:26:04] there is the truth to the fact that God
[1:26:06] allows you to meet the people that you
[1:26:07] do for a reason there's a reason for
[1:26:12] that I don't want to believe that
[1:26:13] anybody is a seed of the devil I don't
[1:26:16] want to believe that you're going to
[1:26:17] hell I wanna believe you're going to
[1:26:18] heaven but I know to get there you've
[1:26:20] got to come God's provided way he said
[1:26:26] your your mistakes are not allowed to
[1:26:27] you he is your profession see he is your
[1:26:31] sin offering your sins are not known hey
[1:26:33] man you're not a sinner before God
[1:26:35] Christ took your sins and became you
[1:26:38] because your desire is to serve Him and
[1:26:42] sister bruce says but I've never had an
[1:26:44] experience that I've been filled with
[1:26:45] the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot
[1:26:47] on he said all right notice this
[1:26:49] ordinarily a human being is born in sin
[1:26:52] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:26:53] speaking lies that's the nature of a
[1:26:55] human being he said she said yes he said
[1:26:59] that was your nature it changed once
[1:27:01] what changed he says Christ there you
[1:27:05] are sister that's it
[1:27:08] I'm glad we had a prophet in this day I
[1:27:12] don't have to jump through hoops to do
[1:27:14] it I don't have to join a certain man's
[1:27:16] church to do it you don't have to come
[1:27:19] to this church to be saved that make God
[1:27:22] pretty small you don't have to come you
[1:27:27] don't have to live in Hardy to be a
[1:27:28] messege believer you you don't have to
[1:27:31] go anywhere else in the world to be a
[1:27:34] believer you don't have to go people say
[1:27:36] well come here this is where God is
[1:27:38] moving God can move where you are I
[1:27:39] believe we ought to have a home church
[1:27:41] and be where God is I think we ought to
[1:27:42] make every effort to be in church but
[1:27:45] that's not our relationship with God
[1:27:47] what changed us what were you what are
[1:27:51] you now see where I can look back and I
[1:27:55] see myself I start to come to the house
[1:27:56] of garden I don't I just don't want the
[1:27:58] things I used to want there you are
[1:28:01] keep walking don't stop don't stop there
[1:28:05] keep coming keep walking
[1:28:07] come closely well I just don't feel
[1:28:08] comfortable yet around God's people just
[1:28:09] keep coming come to church come to the
[1:28:11] house of God meet we'll come closer and
[1:28:13] closer until you can finally be saved
[1:28:15] until you can finally know it was an
[1:28:17] assurance that sometimes gotta let you
[1:28:19] have that experience that you'll know
[1:28:22] but keep coming don't walk back because
[1:28:27] of what you feel it's not about what you
[1:28:29] feel Romans 8:1 says there is therefore
[1:28:33] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:28:37] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:28:40] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:28:44] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:28:45] has made me free from the law of sin and
[1:28:47] death for what the law could not do and
[1:28:49] then it was weak through the flesh God
[1:28:51] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:28:53] sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in
[1:28:55] the flesh so he's saying the flesh was
[1:28:57] the problem the law wasn't the problem
[1:28:59] the flesh was the problem right and Paul
[1:29:02] makes that very clear the law cannot
[1:29:04] save you and Paul says if you're married
[1:29:07] to the law you've got to the whole
[1:29:08] husband has to die before you can
[1:29:10] receive Christ Paul even said for those
[1:29:14] that were uncircumcised in Galatians for
[1:29:16] them to be circumcised to become a part
[1:29:18] of the body of Christ he said what's to
[1:29:20] do despite to grace it was it was to
[1:29:22] reject grace because the law cannot make
[1:29:27] you a Christian the law is good but it's
[1:29:31] good in the in the in its completeness
[1:29:34] and the Bible tells us clearly that no
[1:29:37] one no one except Christ as ever lived
[1:29:42] the law and if you're guilty of one
[1:29:45] letter of the law you're guilty of all
[1:29:48] of it and that's what makes no sense so
[1:29:49] I'm gonna keep part of the law well
[1:29:51] where's your sacrifice are you gonna go
[1:29:55] back under bulls and goats because if
[1:29:58] you come over into Christ then you
[1:30:00] sacrificing you're not under the law
[1:30:02] anymore but if you're gonna stay under
[1:30:05] the law you've got to have a sacrifice
[1:30:06] somewhere and what you're doing is
[1:30:08] trying to live alone without a sacrifice
[1:30:10] which makes it even harder a law which
[1:30:12] nobody lived anyway oh my now look what
[1:30:16] he says and it soaks on the likeness of
[1:30:19] sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in
[1:30:21] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[1:30:23] law now this for purposes the effects of
[1:30:25] propitiation that the righteousness of
[1:30:28] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:30:30] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:30:32] spirit say well I want to know how to be
[1:30:35] a good Christian I want to know how to
[1:30:36] live for God walk in the spirit and
[1:30:39] that's not something mystical but that's
[1:30:42] something the Spirit will lead you to
[1:30:43] the word will lead you in the word
[1:30:46] Romans 8 and for that the righteousness
[1:30:48] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:30:50] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:30:51] spirit for they that are after the flesh
[1:30:54] do mind the things of the flesh but but
[1:30:57] they that are after the spirit the
[1:30:58] things of the Spirit so it's very simple
[1:30:59] brother Brennan says by your desire you
[1:31:02] can tell who is on the throne room of
[1:31:03] your heart by your desire thank god
[1:31:09] there's a longing to come to the house
[1:31:10] of God thank God there's something in
[1:31:13] you that wants to be saved
[1:31:14] thank God there's something in you that
[1:31:16] wants to be healed there's something in
[1:31:18] you that a desire there I was talking to
[1:31:20] someone the other day brother Stewart in
[1:31:21] there she said that they wanted to be
[1:31:23] prayed for I said that's good because I
[1:31:25] remember one time stopping on the way
[1:31:26] somewhere and people didn't even want to
[1:31:28] be prayed for it there was an accident
[1:31:30] in the man was bleeding I said can I
[1:31:31] pray for you he said you can if you want
[1:31:33] to didn't even have a desire to be pray
[1:31:36] for him I prayed for him anyway but he
[1:31:38] just he took it us as an offense someone
[1:31:41] said I would pray for it thought Oh God
[1:31:43] but if someone wants to be prayed for at
[1:31:45] least said something but the man that
[1:31:47] makes the statement if you like gospel
[1:31:49] music good Christian music that's
[1:31:53] something what moved from there go
[1:31:57] forward there's got to be something a
[1:31:59] thirst in you that calls out for God hey
[1:32:02] man he said for to be carnally minded is
[1:32:05] death but to be spiritually minded his
[1:32:07] life in peace because the carnal mind is
[1:32:10] enmity against God is not subject to law
[1:32:13] neither indeed can be so then things
[1:32:15] that are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:32:17] and this is important because this is
[1:32:20] what this is what propitiation is is
[1:32:23] coming to a place where you can please
[1:32:25] God and they that are in the flesh
[1:32:27] cannot please God he said but you are
[1:32:30] not in the flesh but in the spirit if so
[1:32:33] be that the Spirit of God dwell in you
[1:32:35] now if any man have not the Spirit of
[1:32:37] Christ he is none of his hey Ben amen
[1:32:41] and in Christ being you the body is dead
[1:32:44] because of sin but the Spirit is life
[1:32:46] because of righteousness but if the
[1:32:47] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:32:49] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:32:51] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:32:53] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:32:55] dwelleth in you now he said therefore
[1:33:00] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[1:33:01] to live after the flesh now remember
[1:33:03] Romans 8 comes after Romans 7 that's the
[1:33:05] most important thing you'll hear all day
[1:33:08] Romans 8 comes after Romans 7 coz if you
[1:33:12] go back and read Romans 7 he talks about
[1:33:13] the flesh about this war that's going on
[1:33:17] but there's a way to walk in the spirit
[1:33:21] aren't you glad he made away the effects
[1:33:23] of the privation
[1:33:24] it's that fellowship with God again so
[1:33:26] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:33:28] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:33:30] you live after the flesh you shall die
[1:33:31] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[1:33:33] the deeds of the body you shall his word
[1:33:38] if I means to kill dead Oh holiness
[1:33:43] folks you know I thought would preach
[1:33:45] heavy on that side and not so much on
[1:33:46] the grace of God but but they preached
[1:33:48] on the dying and they talked about how
[1:33:50] they've never seen a dead man steal
[1:33:52] watermelons and it's it's a simple
[1:33:57] illustration but you know there's
[1:33:58] there's a point you that old man has to
[1:34:00] die you've got to keep under your body
[1:34:02] as Paul said bring it under subjection
[1:34:04] so that control tower brother Brennan
[1:34:06] talked about kids control your body and
[1:34:09] you can walk in the spirit so he says as
[1:34:11] many as are led by the Spirit of God
[1:34:13] they are the sons of God he didn't say
[1:34:17] as many as went to word of life
[1:34:18] Tabernacle he didn't say as many has
[1:34:20] heard a certain preacher he didn't say
[1:34:23] it's me as did this out of the other as
[1:34:24] many as there
[1:34:25] that for the spirit of god that maybe
[1:34:26] going to word of life's tabernacle that
[1:34:28] maybe where you go to church and what
[1:34:30] you doing all those things but it's also
[1:34:31] led by the spirit they're the sons of
[1:34:35] God for you have not received the spirit
[1:34:37] of bondage again to fear you've not
[1:34:41] given another law you've been not men
[1:34:43] made to walk back and go back under that
[1:34:45] law but you've been given receive the
[1:34:48] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:34:51] Father
[1:34:53] hey bad brother better says how does it
[1:34:58] do it some about the scripture he said
[1:35:01] you say glory to God hallelujah don't
[1:35:02] bother me I'm a child of God and go out
[1:35:04] and do the things you do he said the
[1:35:06] Spirit of God will do the works of God
[1:35:08] what is that the effects of propitiation
[1:35:12] he said the Spirit of God will do the
[1:35:15] works of God Jesus said neither believe
[1:35:16] it's on me the works that I do shall he
[1:35:18] do also and yet we see something more
[1:35:23] even than just living a life for God but
[1:35:27] we're going back into full Redemption so
[1:35:30] there had to be something come here at
[1:35:32] the end time and we'll talk more about
[1:35:33] that where he claims those names were in
[1:35:36] the book where there's a fullness of the
[1:35:38] word in this age that hasn't been
[1:35:40] another ancients because this is the age
[1:35:42] of for redemption this is the age of
[1:35:46] adoption if we can put it that way this
[1:35:47] is the age of the manifestation of the
[1:35:50] sons of God Romans 8 and 16 the spirit
[1:35:52] itself bears witness with our spirit
[1:35:53] that we are the children of God and if
[1:35:56] children then were heirs heirs of God
[1:35:58] joint heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:36:00] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:36:02] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:36:05] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:36:06] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:36:07] which shall be revealed in us I'm sorry
[1:36:09] there's so much reading but I I couldn't
[1:36:11] put this any better than Paul did so he
[1:36:14] said for the earnest expectation of the
[1:36:16] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:36:18] of the sons of God amen
[1:36:21] for the creature was made subject to
[1:36:23] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:36:26] him who subjected the same in hope
[1:36:28] because the creature itself also shall
[1:36:30] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:36:32] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:36:34] the children of God for we know that the
[1:36:36] whole creation groaneth
[1:36:38] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:36:39] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:36:42] have the first fruits of the spirit he
[1:36:44] goes in another place the earnest of our
[1:36:47] inheritance we who have the firstfruits
[1:36:49] of the Spirit wait groan within
[1:36:51] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:36:54] wit the redemption of our body
[1:36:58] you can argue the first about where
[1:37:01] we're at in that process and what's all
[1:37:02] been done but listen we have the ability
[1:37:05] now to go all the way back we have the
[1:37:07] word to do that but look I'm not fully
[1:37:10] redeemed yet is this body still here and
[1:37:14] this isn't the condition I'm gonna be in
[1:37:16] I bet some of you ought to shout about
[1:37:19] that this is not the condition and I'm
[1:37:23] stuck it very bad I mean there may be
[1:37:27] something happen in your body but think
[1:37:29] you had a stroke some of y'all had
[1:37:30] different things physical problems in
[1:37:32] your body and there's been things that
[1:37:34] affects you maybe you can get over it
[1:37:36] and you can become get better but it's
[1:37:37] still there's something that hinders you
[1:37:39] it's an evil and your flesh old ages
[1:37:41] that it's as you get older you just
[1:37:43] begins to hinder you more and more but
[1:37:45] you're not stuck there amen because we
[1:37:49] won't all sleep but we'll all be changed
[1:37:51] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:37:54] at the last Trump look he said Branson
[1:37:58] what's everything waiting on what's the
[1:38:00] whole creation waiting for the
[1:38:03] manifestation of the sons of God it's
[1:38:06] waiting for the church to become into
[1:38:08] its position who is the son of God when
[1:38:10] had him he said where was his domain the
[1:38:12] earth he had domain over the earth we
[1:38:16] live in Earth it's what these bodies are
[1:38:20] people want to be able to speak
[1:38:22] something I know that's been said before
[1:38:23] but they won't be able to speak things
[1:38:24] into existence I want to speak peace be
[1:38:27] still and let my mind stop and be able
[1:38:30] to sleep are you with me now I want to
[1:38:34] be able to speak to my own body and let
[1:38:36] things happen to where where you know
[1:38:38] what sometimes you worry about things
[1:38:40] and the more that you become responsible
[1:38:42] for the more you worry about that's just
[1:38:45] true you get when you're young you're
[1:38:46] pretty carefree and I see young people
[1:38:48] they stressed out I think just wait till
[1:38:50] you get a family
[1:38:53] but you have that third kid
[1:38:55] you know there that fourth one then you
[1:39:01] go to stress then you have a right - but
[1:39:05] see those are things that I want to be
[1:39:06] able to speak to that and say and
[1:39:09] realize that it doesn't mean no good and
[1:39:11] so I can speak to that I can have domain
[1:39:14] over that I can take every thought that
[1:39:17] exalts itself against Christ and bring
[1:39:19] it into captivity are you with me now I
[1:39:23] know we worry I worry but it doesn't
[1:39:27] mean I have to sometimes I get sick it
[1:39:30] doesn't mean I have to stay sick I can
[1:39:32] be healed because healing is already
[1:39:34] taking place I can be safe I can come
[1:39:36] back because we have a word today by
[1:39:38] which we can come and say Satan I have
[1:39:40] dominion over this earth you don't have
[1:39:43] a right to be on here we'll talk more
[1:39:44] about that squatter how Satan is a
[1:39:46] squatter on our land we'll talk more

[1:42:27] redeemed now we have dominion we have
[1:42:29] the ability to create an atmosphere even
[1:42:32] in our spirit realm in our flesh round
[1:42:34] that God could live within us look here
[1:42:37] man had dominion over the earth the
[1:42:40] whole creation is waiting for the sons
[1:42:41] of God to be manifested Jean encapsulate
[1:42:48] this and I'm skipping some of this just
[1:42:49] a little bit of it just to save time but
[1:42:52] first John 2 and 1 this is our text this
[1:42:56] is what I kept reading over and over
[1:42:57] again just read this then we'll go maybe
[1:43:05] not immediately but we'll go he said my
[1:43:09] little children these things write I
[1:43:12] unto you that you sin not
[1:43:13] I love the way he puts it my little
[1:43:16] children
[1:43:17] that you said not and if any man sin we
[1:43:21] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[1:43:23] Christ the righteous
[1:43:26] and he is the propitiation for our sins
[1:43:32] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:43:37] sins of the whole world and hereby we do
[1:43:41] know that we know him if we keep his
[1:43:44] Commandments he sayeth I know him and
[1:43:48] keepeth not his Commandments is a liar
[1:43:50] and the truth is done in him not want us
[1:43:52] to think about this in the effects of
[1:43:53] propitiation here he is the propitiation
[1:43:55] of our sin if we know him for our sin if
[1:43:59] we know him we keep his Commandments if
[1:44:01] we don't keep his Commandments were a
[1:44:02] liar if we say we're in him but we don't
[1:44:05] keep our Commandments if we say we know
[1:44:07] him but we don't keep his Commandments
[1:44:09] he said but whoso keepeth his word in
[1:44:12] him verily is the love of God perfected
[1:44:17] now you hear a lot about people that say
[1:44:21] well I keep the word every word of it
[1:44:23] brother Ben every word of it Matt I
[1:44:26] always always been right on that word is
[1:44:30] the love of God perfected in you because
[1:44:35] if you keep the word well notice what
[1:44:38] he's talking about he's saying if you do
[1:44:40] you keep his Commandments what is his
[1:44:42] commandment he loved one another loved
[1:44:47] one another he said as I have loved you
[1:44:48] he said the greatest commandment was to
[1:44:50] love God
[1:44:51] he said and then love one another whoso
[1:44:56] keepeth his word in him verily is the
[1:44:59] love of God perfected perfected you keep
[1:45:03] the Word of God
[1:45:04] samer out on the word we've heard it for
[1:45:06] years well you gonna stay right on the
[1:45:07] word that's right but it's the love of
[1:45:09] God perfected in you sometimes being
[1:45:13] right on the word means not saying
[1:45:15] everything you know sometimes being
[1:45:18] right on the word means you say Father
[1:45:20] forgive them they don't know what
[1:45:21] they're talking about
[1:45:23] why because to be right on the word is
[1:45:25] to have love perfected there
[1:45:29] and we don't we don't change the Word of
[1:45:33] God we we don't dare add to or take away
[1:45:35] from the word we want to stay right with
[1:45:38] what the word says this is the Word of
[1:45:40] God the Bible is the Word of God and
[1:45:43] today we have the revealed Word of God
[1:45:45] which is God's commentary on the Bible
[1:45:48] if we can say it that way
[1:45:49] the divine commentary in the Bible so we
[1:45:52] know that these line up what a prophet
[1:45:54] of God said what the word says it lines
[1:45:56] up we don't take the message and try to
[1:45:58] line the Word of God up with it we take
[1:46:00] the Word of God and we line up what our
[1:46:01] understanding of the message with that
[1:46:03] right because it will line up because
[1:46:05] he's a prophet but if we have the word
[1:46:08] and we keep the word the love of God
[1:46:11] will be perfected in us and if not
[1:46:14] there's something that we've left off of
[1:46:15] the word maybe like the Pharisees we've
[1:46:18] ties our pepper in the cloth in the
[1:46:22] cabinet oh god help us today but left
[1:46:28] off the way to your matters of the law
[1:46:30] love and mercy faith if we keep his
[1:46:36] Commandments but whoso keepeth this word
[1:46:38] in him verily is the love of God
[1:46:40] perfected that's what I want don't you
[1:46:43] want that today I want the love of God
[1:46:45] to be perfected in my life that's what
[1:46:47] we need as much believers more of that
[1:46:49] or the love of God perfection of my
[1:46:52] heart hereby know that we are in him he
[1:46:55] to say if he abideth in him ought
[1:46:57] himself also so to walk even as he
[1:47:01] walked you can go read in 2nd Peter
[1:47:05] chapter 3 I believe it is where he says
[1:47:07] if when he was reviled he reviled not
[1:47:09] again when he was persecuted he
[1:47:11] threatened not let me be like that
[1:47:15] let me follow that example a perfect
[1:47:19] love
[1:47:21] but the bantam says this the Holy Spirit
[1:47:24] brooded his own body to live in Jesus
[1:47:26] Christ when he overshadowed Mary and
[1:47:29] created a brood of the blood cell in the
[1:47:31] womb
[1:47:31] there's the Godhead again he said that
[1:47:34] brought forth the son Christ Jesus were
[1:47:36] God Himself tabernacled on earth for
[1:47:38] thirty three and a half years and was
[1:47:41] the propitiation for our sins to redeem
[1:47:44] us and to bring reconciliation between
[1:47:48] lost men and a holy God I love this
[1:47:52] could kiss them and reconcile them
[1:47:54] together then in the cool of the evening
[1:47:58] remember that's what Adam lost was God
[1:48:03] wanting to meet with him in the cool of
[1:48:06] the evening God never did in God sought
[1:48:11] men out for salvation but he didn't seek
[1:48:14] Adam out for fellowship after he sent
[1:48:17] until there was a propitiation made he
[1:48:21] sought him out - to cry out Adam what
[1:48:24] have you done
[1:48:24] where are you but he want we want God to
[1:48:28] seek us out for fellowship not just so
[1:48:32] we can get something from him but so we
[1:48:35] can just sit there in the cool of
[1:48:36] evening and said Lord I love you I was
[1:48:38] so glad you came by for fellowship today
[1:48:41] isn't that wonderful when someone comes
[1:48:43] by for fellowship that's what we want
[1:48:45] with God we want that restored whether
[1:48:47] someone comes by and it's the Holy Ghost
[1:48:49] comes by and he comes by for fellowship
[1:48:52] and here he is to bring a reconciliation
[1:48:54] to kiss him and reconcile them together
[1:48:56] and in the cool of the evening when the
[1:48:58] Sun is setting over our brow he said
[1:49:00] when my life's journey is run and my
[1:49:02] race is finished I want him to kiss me
[1:49:05] to sleep as he did Steven when he was
[1:49:09] baffled from hand to hand he said I see
[1:49:12] the heavens open
[1:49:14] can you imagine what did he say lay not
[1:49:17] this sin to their charge rock hits him
[1:49:20] on one side he said I see heavens open
[1:49:24] that's the way how long he'll have to be
[1:49:26] let the storm scab people may throw
[1:49:29] stones or baby rocks come in my
[1:49:30] direction but let me be able to stay
[1:49:33] there and see a vision of Christ you say
[1:49:36] Lord I'm coming home I see the heavens
[1:49:38] open and Jesus standing at the right
[1:49:40] hand of God he said I want him to kiss
[1:49:43] me to sleep what does that speak of
[1:49:44] God's attitude toward Stephen God's
[1:49:48] attitude toward Stephen was such that he
[1:49:51] opened up the heavens
[1:49:53] in his time of persecution that's what I
[1:49:56] want I want God attitude not to be one
[1:49:59] of anger not to be one you say well it
[1:50:02] can't be that sister cross it can be if
[1:50:04] I haven't accepted it
[1:50:05] he still has wrath but if I come God's
[1:50:09] provided way his attitude towards me has
[1:50:12] changed his attitude towards me it's not
[1:50:17] one of judgment it's not one of fear but
[1:50:21] it's one of grace mercy and love he
[1:50:25] kisses me to sleep he did Stephen when
[1:50:28] he was baffled from hand to hand
[1:50:32] musicians go ahead and come I read an
[1:50:37] interesting article some time ago
[1:50:39] there's a song called in Christ alone
[1:50:43] it's a good song it's a modern him you
[1:50:46] might say it's kind of written in that
[1:50:47] formatted and but it was really recently
[1:50:51] written and was written by mr. Getty
[1:50:56] Keith Kenney and when he wrote it they
[1:51:01] were going to put it the Presbyterian
[1:51:03] Church was going to put that in their
[1:51:04] new hymnal and they have a committee
[1:51:06] that searches out songs to put this song
[1:51:09] in their new hymnal but there was a
[1:51:11] problem they called and asked him if
[1:51:15] they could use an alternative lyric
[1:51:17] because the song contained in it the
[1:51:19] phrase till on that cross as Jesus died
[1:51:22] the wrath of God was satisfied
[1:51:27] that's perpetuation if there's no wrath
[1:51:31] there's no satisfaction
[1:51:34] it had to be wrath that there's no
[1:51:36] reason for redemption he said well the
[1:51:39] crosses is only love though the cross
[1:51:41] was the wrath of God but God did it
[1:51:45] because he loved us and so the
[1:51:49] presbyterian church said we don't want
[1:51:50] that in our hymnal to say killing that
[1:51:54] cross was Jesus died the wrath of God
[1:51:56] was satisfied and so much of Christian
[1:52:00] music today they sanitize the lyrics
[1:52:02] officially though what gets on the radio
[1:52:03] because they don't want to offend people
[1:52:05] by saying God was angry
[1:52:06] but if you don't recognize God was angry
[1:52:08] you can't recognize that there there's a
[1:52:11] blood for you very bad so he said still
[1:52:16] on the cross that Jesus died the wrath
[1:52:18] of God was satisfied and so they they
[1:52:20] wanted to change that to the love of God
[1:52:23] was magnified but how could the love of
[1:52:26] God be back defined unless his wrath was
[1:52:28] satisfied and they rejected it I
[1:52:31] appreciate the songwriter rejecting the
[1:52:33] request and they did not include it in
[1:52:35] their hymnal because they didn't want to
[1:52:38] be identified with the wrath of God but
[1:52:42] I'm so grateful that I've gone beyond
[1:52:44] his wrath to have his mercy on me aren't
[1:52:48] you aren't you grateful that you have
[1:52:51] his mercy today and you can see on that
[1:52:54] cross the wrath of God was satisfied
[1:52:56] listen to the words it says in Christ
[1:52:58] alone who took on flesh fullness of God
[1:53:01] and helpless babe this gift of love and
[1:53:03] righteousness scorned by the ones he
[1:53:05] came to safe till on the cross as Jesus
[1:53:08] died the wrath of God was satisfied for
[1:53:11] every sin on him was laid here in the
[1:53:14] death of Christ I live hey man and the
[1:53:18] last verse there's no guilt in life no
[1:53:20] fear in death this is the power of
[1:53:22] Christ in me from life's first cry to
[1:53:24] final breath Jesus commands my destiny
[1:53:27] no power of hell no scheme a man can
[1:53:29] ever pluck me from his hand till he
[1:53:31] returns or calls me home here in the
[1:53:33] power of Christ
[1:53:34] I'll stand let's stand together by our
[1:53:37] hips
[1:53:38] I want the wrath of God to be satisfied
[1:53:45] I need a propitiation there was one made
[1:53:51] for me I beg you today
[1:53:57] I don't know what your life has been
[1:54:00] like but we need if there's anything we
[1:54:05] need in the church today it's a revival
[1:54:06] of the sense of God's presence when we
[1:54:11] don't live like we preach or live what
[1:54:14] we say we deny the omniscience of God
[1:54:19] God knows everything that we've done god
[1:54:24] help us today it was all about us He
[1:54:27] loves us anyway but he loves us because
[1:54:30] of the death of Christ on the cross
[1:54:33] that came to bring us back to him
[1:54:36] changed the attitude of God towards
[1:54:39] those who would receive it God be angry
[1:54:43] with this election could God got angry
[1:54:47] with Moses and tried to find him to kill
[1:54:49] him but his life grabbed us a sharpen
[1:54:54] our rocking and did what God commanded
[1:54:58] and it was blood God was satisfied
[1:55:03] Oh God we can just realize that today we
[1:55:06] need a revival of the sense of God of
[1:55:10] the majesty of God in our myths that we
[1:55:12] can know he's here he's nearest he knows
[1:55:15] everything that we do we don't need to
[1:55:17] hide from him there's no reason died
[1:55:19] we don't just feel bad when you go to
[1:55:21] church as well I just don't live right
[1:55:23] but then when I leave I'm okay we
[1:55:25] realize God is everywhere he knows well
[1:55:28] you don't have to feel bad you don't
[1:55:29] have to be convicted you can come to God
[1:55:31] and come to Christ you can make it right
[1:55:34] even as Christians we we fail so much
[1:55:37] but God we were as a Christian he said
[1:55:39] he don't look at your mistakes but the
[1:55:42] brand even said that he hears your voice
[1:55:43] but he doesn't see you receipts the
[1:55:45] blood hey man so grateful for that today
[1:55:49] let's just ponder these things as if you
[1:55:51] need to come to Christ today and we'll
[1:55:53] give you that opportunity right where
[1:55:55] you sit today did you just open your
[1:55:58] heart up to him and surrender yourself
[1:55:59] fully to his word let that propitiation
[1:56:02] become effective in your life if you're
[1:56:05] a Christian today maybe you've been
[1:56:06] struggling and I felt the Holy Spirit
[1:56:08] this morning reaching out to those that
[1:56:09] were struggling with fear and anxiety
[1:56:11] and things like that and if you struggle
[1:56:15] with that today I'll admit I do
[1:56:17] sometimes as well
[1:56:20] would you just lay that on him and
[1:56:23] justjust take up your right as a
[1:56:25] Christian and save this abstract

[1:56:30] property I have a right to peace I have

[1:56:45] believe he's the same yesterday today
[1:56:47] and forever could you just reach out to
[1:56:49] him that way you've struggled with that
[1:56:50] I know many of us doing this our Satan
[1:56:53] is fighting our minds trying to make us
[1:56:55] think he'll try to make it you think
[1:56:56] that I don't love you that people around
