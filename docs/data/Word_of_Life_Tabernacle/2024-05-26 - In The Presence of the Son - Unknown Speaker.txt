that were unable to come but we're glad you're here and we're thankful for the presence of the Lord with us he never fails to meet us when we come in the right expectation the right attitude he's always there to meet us we thank him for that today Joel chapter 2 verse 23- 26 it's a very uh common scripture for us is also a very important scripture uh for us at the end time Joel 2:23 through 26 I want to say uh to preface this this morning you're just going to have to bear with me and and let me work my way through this I we got one service today I'm not going to preach all day I don't do that but I am going to take my time a little more maybe than I normally would as we try to work through this it's important to me it's important for me to understand and so I maybe you'll receive something from it as well and so I want to preach in the presence of the Sun in the presence of the Sun the o n son Joel 223 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God how many can Rejoice this morning in the Lord he said for Heath given you the former Reign moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month the flo should be full of wheat the fat shall overflow with wine and oil I love that I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people are you his people this morning my people shall never be ashamed the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning one of the Bible's simplest and yet most important types is the grain of wheat grain of wheat and to understand the type of the grain of wheat I think we have to understand it in a Biblical mindset as they would have understood it when Jesus first spoke it to them and as they would have understood it in the land of Israel brother brandom says this about that he said as a boy preacher I used to try to wonder what these Parables meant he said I never could understand it just right until once I visited the Eastern countries he said the Bible is a Eastern book and we're trying to understand it by a western understanding he said when you go east it becomes a different book to you because it's wrote in the light of Eastern knowledge and so we have to understand it in that light now Israel has an interesting climate because crofs are actually grown in Israel in the winter and harvested in the spring so it's much like our wheat today our winter wheat that we have that would actually be planted in November or December and then come up in May and June and that's the way their wheat crop would be and also their barley crop barley takes a little less time to grow so barley would be harvested around the time of Passover and that would be the very beginning of the wheat Harvest as well and then the wheat Harvest wouldn't end until right after Pentecost and so th those were uh it's a different uh mindset than what we would have like we would think about Harvest being a time in the fall when the air is crisp and and people are drinking apple cider and we're having fall festivals and things like that but that's actually not the time when uh when they would Harvest something they would Harvest this is important this morning they would harvest in the very hottest part of the year as the sun was reaching its full strength that was when they would Harvest their crops now there's three things are you are we all awake this morning the storms didn't keep you up all night all right there's three things that are required to have a crop of wheat that's the seed right the rain all right and the sun those three things are required in order to have a crop of Wheat and we know that the seed has got to be planted in the ground and so Jesus tells us that in John 12:2 for verily verily I say un you except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abides alone but if it dies it bringeth forth much fruit so it's meant to produce more uh more in number but exactly the same in characteristic as it was when it was planted so the seed was planted with him in burial raised with him with Christ on the third day and then displayed in its maturity on the day of Pentecost right so it was displayed in its maturity in Christ as a as a first fruits and then it was displayed in Pentecost as Bread on his table and so that bride at Pentecost was a mature bride all right yet it was not the end state that he desired because there had to be a gentile bride and we know that the 120 were Jews right so there had to be a gentile bride you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and I'm so glad to hear that today I'm so glad to know that it gives me great comfort and Assurance I don't just say that to make you feel good we say that because the Bible says that because a prophet taught us that so the seed then had to be planted in burial raised on the third day displayed in maturity so the bride at Pentecost was not the end state that he desired but you are the end state if we can say it that way of what he desired you and I are what he wanted to see the whole time now we know that that had to be buried it was meant to be buried brother B said it was buried in a Roman Cathedral it was buried during the Dark Ages during we could say the winter time it was planted and it began to sprout in Luther's time 500 years ago God takes his time right so this is a long-term crop right we get in a hurry but God don't get in a hurry sir right God has a longterm Vision he's got a longterm you're looking at tomorrow you're looking at your bank account you're looking at what's happening you're looking at at this the the job that you need you're looking at this side or the other but God's taking a Long View he's been growing this crop for a long time but the allien is not going to fail right there's not going to be a crop failure in this age there there may have been crop failures in other ages there may have been life that passed on through but this is the end State this is the very end of what he wanted at the beginning so now it had to begin to sprout and and We Know by where W time it looked like a wheat plant you can go out there and say we got a crop of wheat but you didn't really have any Wheat at all you had a stalk you had a you had a sprout but you didn't have wheat and then it be to sprout but yet there was life there that would become wheat but now by by West's time it become a wheat plant the time of the Pentecostal Revival of 1906 it had formed a husk that looked like a wheat seed that went into the ground I want to ask you a question I posed this question before but what would the church at the end time look the most like of all of the preceding churches all right it think about it there's a stalk there's a tossle there's a husk what is the church going to look the most like a Pentecostal church right right cuz the church that went in the ground had to Die the shuck looks like that it's not the week right but it looks like the wheat and conversely the wheat looks like it yeah so the bride will not look like a babtist denomination right come on right you you wouldn't be deceived by that right no one would be deceived by that but what was the deception coming Pentecost because it was almost like the real right because they shouted and you shout and they have they worship and you worship and and and they have gifts and you have gifts but that's the deception that comes so you say well let's just go back and be Lutheran again no I want the real thing on I want the gifts I want them in order but I want the gifts I I want the worship I want in order but I want the worship I don't want to ever lose my worship I don't want to ever lose the powerful preaching of the word I don't want to ever lose the power of the Holy Ghost that can come down and change your life instantly yes sir we're not Baptist right we're not methodists we're not Pentecostals right but we've we but we look more like a Pentecostal church right right because that's the age we're living in is the time of the grain now everybody understand that right you can argue with me about it later now so H it formed a husk looked like a grain of wheat but it was not but then what has to happen now that's the seed but in order for that all to take place in order for it to become the wheat there had to be rain all right right right so the first part there had to be a seed right you're the seed of God but to order to make you what God wants you to be order for you to manifest the the the thing that the code that God has put in your life the DNA that he's put down on the inside you know there's DNA inside of you that come from your parents you look like a Shamel or you look like a prud God help us you know you look you look like that it's just DNA that's coated down on the inside of you but you realize that in the seat of God there's actual DNA coded in there that's that spiritual DNA that actually makes you look like Christ and as it matures and as it grows out it actually makes you look like Jesus did look like a Christian so so now we find that it takes rain to do that to bring that out of your life and rain falls on the just and the unjust and it's the same rain right rain is the holy spirit falling on the Earth yesen amen I'm glad for the rain we need the rain right and we've had a rain in our day I want to talk about that for a moment deal with that because I have to in order to get where I want to go this morning I appreciate you being patient with me in Joel chapter 2 we haven't started preaching yet in Joel chapter 2 verse 23 he said be glad then you Children Of Z rejoice in the Lord your God he has given you the former Reign moderately that doesn't mean in measure it means Faithfully he's given you the former Reign Faithfully as he said he would and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month right so he said you're going to have an extra blessing you've had a former Reign but here at the end time you're going to have the former reain and the latter rain together right brother the brandom taught us that the former rain brother brandham brought it out he said that's the Greek or the Hebrew word Mor which is or Mora which is teacher or teaching rain the teaching rain as they would call it it's the rain that began when that when that first began to sprout it needed a rain on it so it didn't die immediately just like when you plant a flower you need to water it right you need rain on it when they would plant their crops they needed that beginning rain because the sun would would would cause it to wither and die so they needed a rain and it's a teaching rain because it happens during the infancy of the plant everybody with me so far so the teaching rain is what brought it up what brought it up it's a rain of the Holy Spirit but it's in teaching yeah so the promise uh and and the latter rain and the former rain coming together that word that latter rain is actually a word that it's for strengthening and maturing crops and it's opposed it's opposite the spring rain latter rain is literally a type of the king's favor I like that it's a type of the king's favor that there would be a lad rain and especially a former Reign and a latter Reign together at the end time so the promise was that both Reigns would fall all together in the harvest season producing a bumper crop and people can say what they want to but if the word of God is right you're a bumper crop you're not a halfway crop you're not somebody that's stuck in the past somewhere and unable you're not somebody we have to beat constantly to try to get you to obey but you're a bumper crop if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ something's happening in your life so so it's a it produces a bumper crop now now brother B says if you want a church start with the word of God oh Lord help us today he said if you want a life of God start with the word of God you young people you want a life of God you want a life that you where you'll walk with God where you won't be deceived by the devil what do you do start with the word of God if you want a life of God start with the word of God accept the word of God in its fullness all right every measure of it except the word of God oh my except all that the word is in its fullness every measure of it he said and if that is the fullness of God in you I like that he said then the rain that's falling sir will produce exactly what's in your garden right so if you're a wheat seed The rain that's falling will produce a wheat seed if you're a tear the rain that's falling will produce a tear but oh my if you're the genuine wheat it'll produce the Life of Christ to the people around you and they won't have to wonder but they'll look at your life and they say they've been with Jesus they love like Jesus they they talk like Jesus they walk like Jesus they the the signs follow them they believe they they're they're they're Jesus on the Earth are you with me now if it's the fullness of God in you it'll bring out it'll produce exact what's in your garden now I'm just hitting the highlights to this you can go study it yourself if you study the former and the latter rain but I got to explain this before we can go any further brother brandom says that he tells us that the Billy Graham and the Pentecostals and the word were all sown in the world so the the intellectual Faith was sown the Pentecostal Faith was sown that seed was swn and he said the word was sown amen right now he said what's the matter now he talking about the world she's now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits and the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denomination wants more members that's what they're going to get he said that's what they've gotten the Pentecostal wants more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get right but the word oh this gives me great confidence see I don't have to produce the Life of Christ in you all I have to do is preach the word because when the word is preached under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it'll produce the word in you because it's already in you to become that the Pentecostals want more Pentecostals but the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God he said that's coming too oh we seing the fruit of denominationalism we've seen what it's become but we've also seen the fruit of the word are you with me so far so brother R talks about the latter rain movement how many have ever heard of the latter rain movement in Pentecost I I I'll speak to the resue some of you Elders raise your hand but you don't see them much anymore the latter rain Amy simple mcferson was latter rain and so believe she was four square but she was part of that movement all the it was a movement that began it began in Van in Vancouver at brother brandom's meeting when he had it in 19 47 some people I believe from Edmonton or somewhere came to Vancouver and they saw uh the the power of brother Brand's meeting at that time this is even before we had tapes and they saw the power of God the rain that was falling on that meeting and they looked at that and said well praise God you know it's time so what they did is they went and started a denomination went and found a group of people and they all got together started praying and asking for gifts and things and they got them yeah but but brother Brandon said it wasn't the right thing at the right time what it actually did is produced another organization but brother said it fizzled out and died because it wasn't the hour for organization it was the hour for the word but it was produced out of brother bram's meetings they produced brother Bram said it was the right rain on the wrong seed the right rain on on the wrong seat brother man said the two denominational kinds you understand the two denominational kinds will unite together and go to Sodom that's the Billy Graham and the Oral Roberts he said but the word will stay with the elected the Royal seat right he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so brother Randon refers to his ministry and he talks about the latter rain move they didn't they didn't comprehend that God was doing something but he was doing something through a prophet it wasn't just making somebody a prophet it wasn't just gift falling the congregation but God was doing something in a prophet and through a prophet and so brother BR refers to his ministry as the former latter Reigns in uh in 1960 in discernment of spirit he said the former Reign running first the first rain we've had here comes the latter rain coming over the former rain coming over the latter rain East and West meeting together both Reigns falling together he said Divine Healing plus the angel of God revealing the secrets of the hearts and bringing everything to pass oh he said it looks like trueborn children of God would see that so watch you had a Divine Healing you had you had the angel revealing the secrets of the hearts the first and second poles and it it was the rain falling together he said you it looks like trueborn children of God would see that yeah but now they missed it now look the teaching rign came and the the latter rain came in the same season right right but they missed the teaching rain and wanted the latter rain right right they they didn't get the teaching rign and really it was both together and it comes in this message just just just to tell you where I'm going this message fulfilled that scripture of the former and latter Reign I've got to quote on that after a while now both Reigns falling together now the B said in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the Harvest rain he said you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop growing just before it matures there comes another crop that's what they call the Harvest rain you said we know when it is the spring rains and then the rains about June it makes your crop that's Harvest Time so what would happen is that the seed would be planted in the winter and it would come up and it would actually reach a place a time of harvest and when it reached a time of harvest in the spring in the late spring would actually be another rain and what was the purpose of that rain if they didn't get the the ladder rain the Harvest rain that the crop would actually never become a bumper crop right it would just be another crop right right but in order for it to be a bumper crop the rain had to fall together right so if you got extra rain oh my extra rain in the harvest season would produce a bumper crop because what it would do is those those wheat seeds would then soak up that moisture right and have enough moisture oh Church to make it through the dry time all right because the heat of the sun was fixing to come over the sun was about to be revealed in its fullness and for that time there needed to be a former and a latter rain so oh my so that during the hot time during the dry time the the the seed would still be in Revival if you can crack it open it's still growing it's still has moisture it still has life why sir it had the former and the latter rain right are you with me now amen now he said about June said makes your crop he said and and now the rain we find out was the spirit and now we left off he said where I gave my thoughts of what a whole thing will be so that is I believe the rain has been brought the rain the reason we're quietening down the grounds SED over you can't find anywhere hardly but what's been seed went out through radio television tape word everything it seed the country down it planted seeds now what seeds was planted he said you cannot get nothing else from it but what seeds that was planted listen if you don't lay in the word you're not going to become the word you can't get nothing from it but what seeds was planted he see can you understand now it'll be the seeds that's planted he said now the spirit will fall but it'll bring a harvest of the seed that it falls on he said now again he said now we said this is spoken word of the Original Seed he said we said in the last days Joel told us the other part of the scriptures listen close now there would be a former and latter rain in the same season he goes through all that and in fact brother BR said there was a communist Reign a Roman Reign a Roman Revival A Reign is a Revival a communist Revival a Roman Revival he said there's a revival going on what is it a sewing you said you don't hear very much of Billy Graham no more what about Ora what about the rest of them you know the great Revival fire not burning what is it it's the end time seed sign words say been swn what is it denomination will reap denomination makes some Confederate themselves together this parts from the end time sign seed he said but the word of God has been sewed also and when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people come on oh that's my prayer today I pray Lord won't you live in my life amen he said and that false bride that's committed adultery out there brought herself into Creeds and sold out her birth rights will reap what a confederation of church is to be B bound and burned like the thorns and thistles but where the word of God has been sewed into the people's heart oh I pray this would be a place where the word of God would be sowed into the hearts of people he said where the word of God has been swn in the people's heart it will reap a bride for Christ as certain as I'm standing here my brother random tells us that 1906 Pentecost was not the final quickening was not the latter rign because they never had a teaching rign right right so it couldn't be the latter rank because they were both falling the same season he said this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know there must have necessity of necessity the return of dynamic power yeah right see demons have power and people acknowledge it right right the devil's got power and people acknowledge it well the bride also has power right to overcome the power of the enemy it's got to it must of necessity be a returned because there's never been more power of the devil and God did not leave you powerless yes sir right without a word to to produce power in your life so the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God because they recognize the age they were living in they were begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first Cent what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain and again this is true also in your life what we do for the children when we teach them the word of God is Not unimportant right there's got to be a teaching a sewing you Sunday school teachers you're sewing yeah right as a pastor I'm sewing in the hearts of young young people what are we doing we're sewing because there's going to be a harvest in that life and there's got to be because of the age we live in there's got to be I believe there could be a sewing rain and immediately a lad rain quickening to the Holy Ghost but there's got to be a sewing a teaching or growing up but they had not received the teaching Reign now uh and he said how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign did not come so now again brother bam taught us he remember he said that was a teaching Reign for the denomination Billy Graham or Roberts but not for us right we were taught by the message of the hour so he talked about the Judas and Jesus and the mixture that was there he said but what about the true seed it will happen just as we've said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of this age in her now do we really believe we're her we say that that way in this age I know that sounds strange but we are her yeah right we are the bride yeah we are either are or we aren't right can you believe that you are I believe the bride has the capacity to know who she is can you believe that you are in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning he said that is thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah he quotes the scripture that we read about the former latter Reign now he said it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore rest the church it started a Reformation the Western age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word he said this is not the resurrection of the church it's the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost to the beginning he talked about why it needed to be restored because of the caterpillar and because of the the worms that that come up and eaten away at its joy and eating away at all these things that he talked about he said that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he said he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith oh my church do you realize where we're at we've had a teaching rain we've also had a harvest rain we're living in it what is it you see what can it be what's rapturing Faith the B will take the seven Thunders to wake her up and see people try to separate the word from the spirit you can't do it right it's the same thing the spirit lives in the word hallelujah when Jesus come on the earth the spirit indwelt him the spirit is living in the word today come on and it's just one and the same and so the rains fall together to you are you with me now this is a harvest rain this is rapturing Faith yes sir right I said well I'm waiting on that to come well then you can't you can't be ready then our brother sang this morning signs of the times are everywhere could it happen today do you really believe that today your body could be what about in the morning could it happen in the morning could it happen tomorrow could it happen to the next day absolutely it could happen what a Memorial Day that would be you'd forget all about the hamburgers and the hot dogs and whatever it is you're going to have for Memorial Day if you found out oh my if you found out this would be the day when your body would be changed you walk out of this old body into a new body again yes sir oh church I'm looking forward to that day none of us are getting any younger I'm not an old man but I'm nearing 40 and I feel every bit of it I know that surprised you you thought I was way older than that I've just been around a long time I got you know you don't have to agree with it I need a deacon sitting next to this guy what's happening what's happening it could happen any minute right how are you ready for it by the message of the hour by the word that fell and with the word came a restoration of Power with a restor oh Church we're not waiting on it to happen we're not waiting on a Revival not waiting on the bride to get awakened we've seen The Awakening of the Bride we we didn't miss it we're we're right there oh that ought to make us happy it ought to make us joyful why did he say rejoice in you children of God God will restore and he has restored hallelujah hallelujah if they could Rejoice at a promise of restoration how much more are we to be able to Rejoice at the Fulfillment of restoration yes sir hallelujah hallelujah you can tell me all you know you can dwell on the bad if you want to you can sit and criticize the church criticize one another call each other names all you want to I I I just refuse to believe that God didn't do what he promised he would do and I I'll say this if you speak that in your children's life they'll become that if you speak that in your Church's life it'll become that if you speak that into the lives of the people around you you'll become that Hallelujah this is the hour for that Hallelujah this is rapturing Faith remember they fall in the same season yes what is the latter rain well brother BR explains this someone asked him the question because we were all mixed up on it do you know how many questions in questions and answers if you go listen to those tapes 1 2 3 and four 1964 if you go listen to questions and answers how many of those questions could be solved would have been if they had understood the opening of the word right right they just didn't understand right and I'll be honest with you some of the questions that got asked they like boy I'd like to ask a question can we just take but he you know little things do matter to people it does matter in our lives it's all the opening of the word but but yet you know there were some questions there that that that they just didn't understand and this is one of them you said will the bride before Jesus comes will she have all the power of the Holy Ghost to perform Miracles rais dead and so on is in the latter rain or is this latter rain for the 144,000 Jews he said they said well ministers have this or are we just waiting for the coming brother brand explains he's a typologist he says this he said and this is a long answer so you'll have to go read it for yourself he said I believe you're seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the Rapture he said that's exactly I believe it the Reign is over where are we at church think about it I don't want you to take that wrong you say well no more Holy Ghost okay I can just go out and do what I want to do that's that's not what he's saying but the rain's coming the reain is over and so where are we at and so brother BR talked about how the last sign was Luke 17:30 right he talked about how he was not allowed to preach the trumpets because that was to the Jews he said the things that the people's been looking for the Pentecost was for miracles he said that's where that'll take place under them he said that's Elijah and Moses now I believe in miracles but what they were doing is they were following Miracles following signs we don't follow signs signs follow us We Don't Preach signs signs happen when we preach the word right and that's part of the word but it's not all the word right right so the we just preach the word whatever we have in our heart and God brings it to pass so now watch what's happening he said the things that the people's been looking for the Pentecost is for miracles that'll take place under them as Elijah and Moses he explains what the two prophets do he said we're just to wait on the coming of the Lord just wait keep your Lambs trimmed all filled full of oil pray up every every hour all right he said not every day every hour just keep ready be ready now watch what he says you want to sign you want you want to know what you're supposed to be doing brother man am I supposed to be speaking in tongues am I you may am I supposed to be running the aisles I hope you do yeah we can use a little more aisle running around here all right brother Ben you're crazy I'd like to see people happy in the Lord I'd be honest with you but that's not what we're seeking right what's not we pre we preach the word then if people get happy enough to run the hours God bless them as long as they're happy about the word and the promise of the word being fulfilled in their life praise God for it yeah right but brother bam explains all of this and and he said pray up every hour not every day every hour just keep ready be ready be sweet well we miss that didn't we in all our Readiness we just kind of cut that out all right come on Church be sweet what's the prophet trying to tell us there's something coming the Danny I think some people caught this part of the message and and some people just never caught it because they forgot to be sweet they forgot to treat their neighbor right and that was part of what would take place brother Brandon said you don't he said you don't because if you he said if you if you begin to promote gifts and push people to have gifts he said you'll have you'll have false gifts show up he said but what you do is get a church so in unity and so in love with another and so much in the power of the spirit he said gifts can't help but flow in a church like that that's true be sweet and watching and he quotes our Lord is coming back to Earth again I love that old song he said that's it that's the hope of the church yes sir this hour brother Ben that doesn't fit with my theology well you know if the message doesn't fit with our theology we need to change our theology brother brandom almost always prefaces his teaching on the wheat with the fact that this revival that had been going on in his ministry had lasted a number of years without forming an organization and he contrast it with the latter rign organization we talked about a minute ago and so the things I'm going to read to you are on that as we continue to talk about this rain then we'll get to the sun now he said why he said it's the weed age friends so he's explaining why did the shck have to pull away some of you wonder why did your friends have to disbelieve the message and for for some of you that woke you up why did they why did why did they fall to a website why did they go I thought they were a good Christian I thought they believed in a prophet and one day you wake up and they're living like the world again and they're out there in the world you think what happened to them well what happened to them it's the time that we're living in yeah and I will say this some of those people may come back but it just proved it wasn't in them yet yet is a good word it hasn't happened yet Paul said I did it in ignorance he knew who Jesus was but he said I did it in ignorance why he never been born again yet so it just hadn't come yet not saying it couldn't come not saying you couldn't be be born again it just hadn't happened yet if you denied the message of the hour right right it hasn't happened yet but now he he said it lasted a number of years he said why do they have to pull away why it's the weat age friends it's the weat there's a Ministry on the earth it's just like the one that went to the ground back Y at the beginning a real Pentecostal experience Hallelujah the next week brother Brandon preaches Harvest time later on he preaches the seed is not air with the shut anointed ones at the end time and you go and listen to those sermons he's explaining how the rain falls on everybody it's not a different rain but it only brings out what it is so he's explaining the rains for everyone only the wheat respond as wheat and he talks about how the he was standing there at the national park and he was talking about how they were about to pour down the the fire out of over the waterfall I believe they still do it today they did it for years but they would pour it down you could see it and he talked about that and he said that his family was standing there looking up he said all of a sudden a man cried out and said and said all things are ready yeah he said and a man standing beside him said Let the Fire Fall and brother random took something from that and he tells that story he said all these promises he talked about the promise of Malachi 4 the former latter reign in the same season all these promises through the scriptures been given we're looking upward right watch he said at the true bride Across the Nation this hour looking up Church he's coming one of these days just to sure as he come the first time he's coming again get everything ready separate yourself from Shu lay before the sun keep looking up be under expectation what do you expect God to do oh my come on Church you're expecting something now or nothing if you come expecting nothing that's expecting right if you come expecting a bad day you come expecting ill from your neighbor you come expecting well that preacher is going to preach at me again it probably happen that's just the truth but if you expect to say Lord I'm expecting the fire to fall all right I'm expecting to become more like Jesus Christ that's exactly what you'll get brother Bron in the day he said that God has poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day right he said this is the he said when the former and latter Reign are falling together right yeah and we know that there's supposed to be great signs and wonders he said which in many great denominations this is turned down right but I'm very thankful he said for these open doors oh God let me keep my doors open to the to the power of this message this I want I'm very thankful for open doors that I've had to go into and the inspiration is given to young men like your pastor has caus him he said as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord oh church I believe there's a generation now those young men become old men but there's still young men that are sweeping on the message yes sir hallelujah hallelujah he said he said to sweep it to the coming Lord that's he said that's the former the lad rain fell in the same season and these young men are to take that message and sweep it to the coming of the Lord now again without the latter rain you can't be ready for a Rapture so we know that the latter Reign has come now brother Rand says it's such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come then the latter rain will come a mount carel Showdown so po part of this latter rain is the Harvest right it's just right there it's the Harvest it produces the Harvest it will come a Mount Carmel Showdown he said watch John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former rign was rejected by the organization of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will SE for the latter rain so John in his Showdown he he was rejected by the organizations of his day and what did he do he sowed a teaching Reign for the ministry of Christ right and brother Brandon typ said he to the Divine Healing was a teaching Reign for the coming of the son of man ministry right so there's a teaching Reign and a harvest rain so Jesus had a mount Transfiguration Showdown so there had this message didn't just bring to us John the Baptist all right the Forerunner but also brought Christ oh Church if you just we just receive it today it also brought Christ and we know Christ will come in a Corporal body how many believ that today well that's how many Believers we have right he said Believers believe that you'll come in a Corporal body but we've had a word coming of Christ an appearing of Christ where he's come and he showed us who he is and he's come in his power in the word to produce a word bride at the end time yes sir we've been married to him now look we all know these things now he said Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds he said for you will come to back up his word take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion amen aren't you glad we're at that Showdown today that's where we are right there the shouts already come we're living in the time of the Rapture now look the former and latter rain fell together produced rapturing Faith what does this mean we're living in the final stage after the last sign and the latter rain now here's my message this morning boy you got quiet I didn't say my message would be long no more rain doesn't mean no more Revival all right because when the latter rain fell it was so much rain falling together oh sister Fritz gets it she it's so much rain falling together that it just Stills up the seed with moisture so the the shut gets dry it's got to so the rain from Heaven has to quit falling on the general population and so the shut dries up the stalk dries up oh my the husk dries up but the wheat seed is maturing it's maturing the sun does not burn it up because the moisture of the lter rain is inside the sea oh Church listen it don't matter how dead they get it don't matter you say well we got to go the world's dead we might as well be dead too no this bride will'll be in Revival we've been in Revival why the former and the latter rain fell together church so much rain in this message so much power in this me so much spirit in this messag glory to God it just filled us up come on all the life went out of the stock went out of the husk went out of the tossel goes right down that little bitty grain it's forming into what he wanted it to be right oh my now see the sun has to come out all right we've had the former rain the latter rain the former and the latter ran together now the sun is the word and it's got to come in its strength at this time of year if we can say it that way it had to come in its strength cu the harvest season if you look outside be just about this time of year what happens it may storm today we might have a rain tomorrow it's going to be hot it's just that time of year you the Heat and the humidity are going to come why because it's that time of year and it was this time of year when the seed would be harvested because it received this final spring rain and then in June if you look at a precipitation map now brother Joel was in Egypt and Joel being Joel he just assumed things work over there like they do here and remember the something was outside or I think they well they had bread out on tables and brother Joel said well what if it rains and our interpreter told us it don't rain you're in Egypt you're in the Sahara Desert he said oh it rains once a year and you can predict it once a year it rains and then when it rains that's all the rain you get and the rest of the rain every day the sun comes up every day it goes down here comes the sun again well that's way it feel sometimes isn't it it's every day you're baking you're baking but if you're the bride the the the oh my the wheat has the ability to retain so much moisture that it's still growing during the Harvest time it's still growing In the Heat of that sun yes sir oh church now look everything else has to die but the wheat just becomes more what it is and when the when the word comes in its strength the the shut can't take it it pulls back the the stalk begins to begins to crumble and begins to fall apart there's no rain in Bethlehem go look it up no rain in Bethlehem in June bethlehem's the wheat basket but the crops are maturing under the direct heat brother B so we know that this weed has come to the same process every nature works the same he said now Lord when we see the Shu now pulling away from the grain going worldly oh God he said grant that those grains he said the Shu has to pull away so the grain can get in the presence of the Sun the presence the son has a presence the word has a presence the word has a has a has an atmosphere the word has does something in your life it's not just a word letter but it's a reality of God the word the sun has to has to begin to bake you has to begin to make you to what you want to be what he wants you to be so the Shu has to pull away he said so the grain can get in the presence of the sun I hear the coming of the combine Lord it won't be long and then the great elevator will take up his bride into glory in the presence of God you see our last sign was Luke 17:30 do you know that he said brother I want to see another sign the last sign that the Gentile world will receive according to the message of the hour is the sign of the son of man don't mean there won't be no more miracles don't mean there won't be any more prophecy don't mean won't be but what it means is that's your last sign better get ready right huh yeah there's a last sign before you get to hearty says Hardy 10 miles or Hardy two miles whatever it is next thing you're in a Hardy they don't give you another warning maybe they should next thing you know you're in a Hardy oh Church don't you realize we've received our last sign and we're headed down the road and the next thing you know the bodies begin to change yes sir that's good Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people the word itself made flesh in you in who brother Wyatt in you oh come on Church in you in me the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it see you I love this everybody's looking for brother brandom to come back or so you know I wish things were like they used to be look look what Resurrection needs to take place see you live again yeah glory to God you were dead in trespasses and in creat you were dead in sin he said you live again live the life that was in Jesus Christ your in the presence of the son Hallelujah say you might be you will be you're in the presence of the son you find brother R did not preach this until the end of his ministry and then he begin to tell them you're in the presence of the sun yes listen you aren't waiting on the rain you're not looking for outside something to come cheer you up come on Church Christ is here he proves his word it's the truth the weed is here it's maturing now it's laying in the presence of the sun he said not in any man May touch it it's all pulling away well have nothing to do with it you have to do that oh brother get in the wheat let your life that's in you come out into the wheat to believe God oh brother get in the wheat let your life that's in you come into the wheat will you believe God what did it pull away for so that it would bring the Grain in the presence of the sun to ripen the grain to a golden ripen for the master all right he said why is it pulled away it caused heartaches tears sure it does you don't want to see the shuck pull away it was comforting right to have the numbers it was comforting when they all went to church with you and everything was good but the Shu began to pull away what did it pull away for oh my it causes heartaches and tears they don't they don't lay that they don't lay before the Su in but the S so n to be rip into the true Full Gospel to manifest everything say everything that Jesus Christ promised in the Bible that's all of it he said there is raising up a body today among the people GL to God again he said what is it the husk for away from the wheat now the wheat must be that way again to lay in the presence of the sun to turn to a Full Gospel golden grain for the master won't you believe it again he said who is this anyhow who is it could it be a man could it be a church could it be a denomination it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said Do you believe him what is it it's the grain becoming grain in the presence of the sun again he said but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen and that's what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here till it becomes so ripe to Christ it becomes Bread on his table oh church I want to be in your house I don't want to be Bread on your table Lord ought to be our desire we he when he sits down to eat he don't want a table full of full of bugs and worms and and and and if you sit down the and the bread's full of mold he wants fresh bread he wants bread from wheat that was ripe yeah oh Church stay in the presence of the son do you become Bread on his table said Satan will do anything he can to get you out of that look he said we're living when there has been stalk tossle shuck almost like the wheat but the wheat is inside the shook the Shu has just supported the wheat kept the hot sun from burning it all right and now the denomination is pulling away from it so it can lay in the presence of the Sun to get right he said so we're in there won't be no more organizations rise up this is the end of it I know you've thought about this you know in your mind you know you maybe not but you think like this the thing what's what's the thing that's the matter with the message today and I know when I lean over the pulpit that's when I really begin to preach come on but we know actually it's because because I'm fat and I need a place to lean on but we know I don't even know what we know now you know I know there's people that say what's the matter with the message today brother Brandon says it you probably read ahead of me anyway he said the thing that's the matter with the message today and I know people say well I know what it is they got drums in the church and that's what's the matter with the message all right come on now thing that's the matter with the message today is there just too many people having too many kids you know it's just I'm just trying to make you laugh the things matter with the message today is them men wearing beards I mean that's just they'd be clean shaving like a prophet said you know all right not preaching that but I've heard it preached the thing that's the matter with the message today is we don't measure the skirts to the girls when they come in no that's not what the prophet said what did he say he said the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the son to get ripened right Hallelujah you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you making matured Christians see what I mean he said God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians for him to receive the wheat has got to get right he said so what does it have to do now what does the wheat have to do after the shuck is pulled away what does the wheat have to do lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about we've talked about it for years it's time to live it we talk about Fellowship for years let's do it yeah all right we've talked about loving one another for years let's do it all right we talked about stopping our gossip for years let's do it are you with me now let's let the greenness get out of us don't try to hammer what some Churches doing down the road let's let's let's get the greenness baked out of us live what we're talking about Pentecost for the BRS that only sheltered the message give it an open door until it gets scattered then the shuck will pull away and the wheat will lay in the presence of the sun to ripen he said there won't be another denomination he said always it pulls away from it it can't be no more it's a wheat now but we're plenty green some of you live through that time and you know I see our elders saying amen because they knew we were they were plenty green could I go out here and say today some of us because we're younger maybe we haven't had the time and seasoning we're plenty green right maybe there's an elder here with just a little bit of greenness left in them plenty green we're still here aren't we then we must be a little bit green plenty green he said we haven't got Oh my he said that's right I have to lay in the presence of the sun now watch what for so we can become word Fighters look at your enemy tell them I love you you know heard that the other night look so we could oh so we could so we' really arm ourself with the word that's not what he said to be mellowed up all right you know you're always looking at that person say one day they'll mellow out and then they never do you know he's 80 years old he still hasn't mellowed well we all do that don't we say well he'll mellow out someday but look we're plenty green but it takes the presence of the sun to Mellow us up to be mellowed up what does that mean it means to fight less not more fight the devil but not fight each other you said brother Ben why you preach on that so much because brother brandom did and I read a lot of quotes all right all right how do we know it's plenty green brother brandom how will we know if we're green is it is a lack of signs in the church lack of gifts left of Miracles I might be part of it but look he we're plenty green we haven't got the sincerity oh I think every one of us had to repent right now from the pulpit to the PE we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God moving in his word and showing us the things yes yet he said but brother Ben I wasn't there during the former noat rain I missed the rain how can I be but you didn't miss the rain the Revival's still ongoing there's still a Revival for you you didn't miss the rain there's still water for you during this time the message is still the latter rain it'll still produce the rain come on every other part dried up and dead but not you I preached it to you many times but I think of the time when Caleb's daughter he gave her a Southland he gave her a part of the ne desert she's part of that desert where there's nothing can grow and she's like she didn't sit there and complain and say well my father gave me land I can't even produce a crop on but she went to her father and she said you've given me a desert land she said give me also Springs of water give me water and I'll make crops grow give me water and I'll produce oh that we could be like that we live in a harvest time we live in a dry time but give me water and I'll produce a crop for you Lord give me also Springs of water good brother brandom says this he said God at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation May the waters May the waters from under the altar of God now look this isn't rain falling on the general population but Waters from the altar of God he still has water for you gush out this morning upon your church water it Lord For The Season's just about to be finished give it life the Waters of life that it might be able to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened for your great Garner you say well that's all past the rain is coming gone but don't you realize that does not give you an excuse there is no excuse for a dead Church there's no excuse for people that don't amen God's word no excuse for people that don't believe in the signs and wonders of God there's no excuse for people that don't preach no more come on I'm tired of the excuses let's live the word let the waters come under the altar of life flow out into the presence of the sun Hallelujah let the water from the altar of God gush out this morning upon your church water it Lord The Season's about to be finished give it life the Waters of life that it might be able to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened for your great Garner he said father I pray for them but the stalk must dry so I cannot pray for it it must die so it is dead but I oh God what part are you today you say well we're dead were're supposed to be dead he said the stalk is dead I can't pray for it it must die but I pray for the wheat Lord that's forming into the body of Christ Grant Lord that the fresh waters of God will keep its cheeks bathed with tears of joy and understanding until the combine comes to take it home oh grant that in our church Lord grant that in every Church of the message at the tears of understanding and Joy would keep our keep our cheeks bathed watered Hallelujah until the combine comes to take it home he said I believe the church is beginning to hear the message I just got a few more minutes and we'll close and begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible it's there oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till what till it gets so hard everything just bounces off of it till it becomes like the stalk where it's dry and it falls apart till it tenders up what what a paradox sir that during the Harvest Time the driest time the lay of c and age the wheat becomes more tender Hallelujah tenderness is associated with rain and water not with sun but the heat of the Sun the open word actually produces a tenderness because the latter rain has come and lives in the bride he said his presence till it tenders up you know he said and get sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down how many how long has it been see you just pray Lord make me sweet made me so sweet that my husband won't have to lie about it made me so sweet my wife won't have to lie about it may me so sweet that the church will know there's something inside of me yes I'll fight when the time comes to fight I'll fight the enemy but make me sweet Lord make it to where I'm so tender that people who say things about me and it'll just bounce off and I can still minister to those people yes God help me today that's a challenge church but every one of us know people you say but but you know what you do if you cut them off if you treat them badly you can't minister to them no more no matter who was right and who was wrong right that person's worth ministering to even if they don't like you sometimes in speaking the message brother the B said you get harsh have to break it in like that because you you got to clinch a nail to make it hold but when the church once gets it all right I recognize we haven't all got it yet sometimes we still have to clinch that nail but when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God brother R just told the story of going beyond the curtain of time he said nothing but perfect love will enter there how many remembers the story I'm closing you remember the story nothing but perfect love L her there and he saw them all with in perfect love and he touched said Lord he said whatever you do lay down everything and get perfect love and he's told that story again and he said I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes its Rapture believe it's time for that perfect love to come in the church believe it's here we just need to Tender up it's sweet brother in now Church we're teaching now but remember when you leave here start moving out out of the Shu he said you're going to the grain but lay in the presence of the son don't add what I've said don't take away what I've said because I speak the truth as far as I know it as the father has given to me don't add to it just say what I said amen the thing of it is just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus and then you yourselves lay right in his presence just make love to him what are we supposed to be doing not dead and dry but in this harvest season make love to him that's worship oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love of the world and let me live holy in this present world before you you see how he repeats it over and I'm doing this for reason he said tender me up sweeten me up he didn't say we need more knowledge more this more that tender me up let me lay in the presence of the message not in so much the word of it the letter of it but the presence of it amen so that word bakes out of me every bit of every bit of malice and bitterness Strife Hallelujah he said take away all the filth and the love of the world let me live holy in this present world before you tender My Heart Lord he said laying out now it's got to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen into the Glorious grain like the one that went in the first real Church went down he said that went down first to come right back musicians go ahead and come coming right back up to the stalk to come out another church when the combine comes to pick it up the life that went down in Luther the life that went down in Methodist the life that went down in the Pentecostal will come into the grain it'll all go right into the Grain and go out forming the perfect body of Jesus Christ but again he said in one of the last sermons he ever preached modern events are made clear by prophecy I've went through these in chronological order in the last two years of his life he said but what's the matter with the wheat now you can't it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up I know sometimes we think well I'm laying in the presence of sun I listen to tapes that's part of it but that's not all of it got to lay in the presence of it you got to get in the spirit of it the atmosphere of it how do you know wheat is ripe you go out here on a wheat fi somewhere how do you know is it when it stands up straight and well I'm wheat now looks good don't it when it's up I cat you know look around I'm wheat now that's not when it's ripe that doesn't tell you it's ripe how you know wheat is ripe it gets so heavy because of the former rain that's com and the latter rain that's come and the sun that's on it the fullness of the word it becomes so so heavy and so humble that it actually bows itself to the Earth and when you see the wheat the head of that wheat bowing over humbling itself that's when you know there's no greenness left in it because it's gotten more and more like the the maturity of what went into the ground and as it becomes more like him it takes on his nature and it begins to Bow itself oh church he said he said know you what I've done to you he said do this to one another wash one another's feet that's more than just going back here in the room and washing our brother our sister's feet but it's actually treating one another like the body and the Bride of Jesus Christ like you actually were the bride of Christ because you are as we see the seed become so heavy let it bow itself what is it doing it's worshiping we preach on that last week it's worshiping it's prostrating itself before the father that's when you know it begins to Worship in spite of its difficulties in spite of its trouble in spite of what's went on through the week in spite of what somebody did to it it worships anyway oh church if we can ever get that heavy with the moisture of the latter rain the former rain and the sun that's come on we could get that heavy and that humble and we could begin to worship god with everything that we have you say well I didn't come to church today to worship I come to receive you have received he give you salvation he give you your health he give you everything you have have now worship him it's time for the seed to Bow itself this is King lamb worship time if there ever was a time to worship at the end of a service after the word has been preached today that day because now is the time when the wheed is ripe begins to worship could we stand together would you bow your heads with me Hallelujah this is when God deals with hearts I hate to see it Church where it's just a burden on my heart I know here and every we're ready to go we're ready to do something else but this is when God begins to work on your heart begins to Tender you up won't you just let the word soak in for a minute Lord tender me up let me lay in your presence oh God in the presence of the so n the Son of God let me lay there and become ripe maybe you with no one looking around maybe you could say Ben I'd like you to pray for me today I know there's greenness in my life I know there's I know there's greenness I I see some things in my life I needed to be baked out God bless those hands God bless all of those hands I know many of us feel that way oh I've got that greenness in my life I want it to be baked out of me I say Lord by your word and by your spirit by the former and the latter Rain by The Coming of the son of man by the coming of Let It Be baked out of my life let me lay in the the presence of God until I begin to reproduce your life in my life oh granny Lord Heavenly Father Lord I'm raising my hands too Lord I see greenness sometimes in my life and I I need you Lord I need that heat of the sun let me stand in the fullness of the word let me be Washed by the Water of the word by the water that gushes out from under the altar let me be bathed down in sweetness and gentleness and kindness oh God I pray you granted today Lord where I wouldn't be one that would hold a grudge Lord or or hold something CU it only hinders me Lord I pray that you'd help me today I pray you'd help these people those that raise
