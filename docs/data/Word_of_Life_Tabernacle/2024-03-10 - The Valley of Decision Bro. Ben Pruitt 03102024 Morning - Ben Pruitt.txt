over how he did his daily life and there was one Hut and he said this is my home and he said they said well what's this other Hut over here and they said well that was my church that's where I would go to worship and and you know this is where I would you know kind of get away from my house and go and worship and they said well what's this other hood and he said that was my old church I couldn't get along with anyone there you know so many times it's us that's the actual problem that gets in our own way and I thought that was pretty a pretty good story but you love the Lord this morning I was

hallelujah Joel chapter 3 and verse 9 Joel 39 we'll read down through verse 14 seems like when the kids are gone and brother Stuart's preaching in Salem this morning and so he's doing doing the work of the Lord up there and and but seems like when those folks are gone and and Joel's gone the kids are gone seems like man all my workers are gone you know so we're grateful for all that they do but I'll say this while you're turning to Joel chapter 3 I hey those kids I think it's going to surprise you the way they come back from camp and I don't say that lightly you know people can go to Camp it's not camp that does anything anything but I watched those kids just open up and really receive from the Lord and uh some of them I never thought I'd I'd never see them get a move out of them in church you know and just the presence of the Lord fell on them and the Word was preached and and some things that needed to be preached needed to be said and and they received it and I was so grateful to see that and you know you got to come up to a point in your life where you decide uh what who you're going to serve I want to talk about that this morning morning as well I want to talk to us adults this morning about that about the valley of decision but the kids have to have to receive that too and I I just see them I see them making that choice I I'm going to serve the Lord I I'm going to believe the message I I I'm going to do what's right and I I love to see that I want to see all of us do that I think it'd help our youth if some of us would do that make that choice I'm want I'm going to I'm going to be a real believer I'm not just going to go to church and sit there I I'm going to be a resp I'm going to resp respond to the word and brother Brenham tells us that not only do we respond to the word he said the word responds to you right when you pull on the word the word responds to that pull I'm so grateful for that today Joel chapter 3 and ver9 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let all the men of War draw near let them come up beat your plow shares into swords your pruning hooks into Spears let the weak say I'm strong assemble yourselves and come all you Heathen gather yourself together round about thither cause thy Mighty ones to come down oh Lord let the Heathen be wakened come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the Heathen round about put you in the sickle for the Harvest is ripe come get you down for the Press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is is great you've heard about the cup of the iniquity of the amorites he's saying it's full it's full time to come down to the valley of Jehoshaphat multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we've been talking about how God builds us as individuals and how he calls Us and how that began before the world ever began that that we are predestined to be what we are and and we there's a seed down inside of us and and and it's something that that God placed there that allows us to uh to be what we are we can't be what we are you can't make yourself elect you can't be what you are and live as a Christian in this day unless there's something there you you can't even desire God andless God Pricks your heart and there's something there that wants God oh aren't you glad aren't you glad there's something in you that wants God today but but that that has to be there there's got to be a a desire there and God deals with you as an individual in that way but there's got to come a time in your life where you come to a fork in the road if I could say it that way or you come to a a a way a place where two ways meet and and you got to go either one way or the other if you ever come to a tea in the road you realize that you either got to go right or left if you as long if you're going forward you got to go one way or the other you you you can't you can't back up you can't uh you you can't just sit there in the road you got to move and you got to go one way or the other and and and when uh Joel is talking speaking in Prophecy he's seeing a place that the world came to that the Gentile World brother the Jason would come to a place where they were actually had reached a place that they they had made their decision and they were in the valley of decision and they' made their decision and they they they' wandered into this Valley and here they were and he said come to the he said and now he said it's multitudes in the valley of decision he's speaking of a gentile age that's made their decision and then he said now God's going to decide what to do with them right they've made their decision and I think if we look around us today we we we'd realize that that America's made a decision they they've turned down the gospel they they did that 1956 they turned down the gospel and the world the Gentile world has made a decision they've turned down the gospel aren't you glad that you made a decision to be the Bride of Jesus Christ you said I couldn't make myself that no but the bride will choose to follow him the bride will choose to believe the message the bride will choose to follow the word so you have to come to that fork in the road and the world has come to a place oh if I could just I come home this weekend because I wanted to preach this to you and I hope I I can get it to you the way it is in my heart the world is reached a place where they they they've reached this tea in the road and and and they realize they can't go anywhere else they can't go any further and so they've reached this place they've made their decision and and and they've made a decision that they're not going to serve the Lord and so it's time for God to decide what to do with them and and and the only way they can go is the way they've decided to go which is the path to hell and and the path to the tribulation period And so when they step this way they're gone one step the wrong direction and they're gone and it's the only way they can go because as a whole I'm talking as a group now we believe there's still elect out there there's people out there that want to serve the Lord but as a whole the group is headed down the wrong direction and all it's just one step away one breath away away one one day away one hour away from the tribulation period the world sitting there at that place this morning oh if I can only get you to realize what what this hour is only get you to recognize what what time it is in in the times of God in the end times now the day of the Lord is at hand in the valley of decision Joel 3:15 says the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the Stars shall withdraw their shining the Lord Lord also shall Roar out of Zion what does that mean he's changed from a lamb to a lion right the Lord will Roar out of Zion utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the Earth shall Shake but the Lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel amen Joel is saying the day of the Lord is at hand you're standing in the valley of judgment or decision the Lord is going to decide what to do with the Gentiles this is the day of the Lord to close of the end times the end of the Gentile age listen Isaiah speaks of it in Isaiah 13:9 behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it for the stars of Heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened and is going forth the moon shall not cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity I will cause the arrogancy of The Proud to cease and will lay low the hotess of the terrible those who were too arogant those who are too proud to come to an altar those who are too proud to come and believe the message of the hour those who are too proud to dress like a Christian act like a Christian that and that day he's going to destroy the pride will lay low the Hess of the terrible he said therefore I will shake the heavens and the Earth shall remove out of her place in the Wrath of the Lord of hosts in the day of his Fierce anger oh I'm so glad that I don't you see but what makes it where you don't have to live in that you stood at that Crossroad and you went on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost you went on in to be the bride of Christ you went on into the message of the hour you went on into the ark amen oh my now look Malachi puts it this way for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven we're right there church one step one step all it is just turn this way walk this step I want you to think about that as as a generation they just it's got the last 10 years have been nuts the last 20 years some of you have lived the last 50 years what what in the world's going on but the Kevin has just gone crazy and why is the world gone crazy why is the devil fighting the people of God like he is why does he fight the message of the hour like he is today I'll say this we shouldn't fight one another the devil's doing a good job of it we just leave that alone but why is the devil fighting the message like he is why does he why does he come in your mind and fight you like he does the day is coming that's right he don't have he don't have very long he knows he don't have very long we're living in that time the day cometh that shall burn us an oven and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up say the Lord of host it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but to you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings brother bam says with healing campaigns healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calvs of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SES of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of host Remember You The Law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him an hore for all Israel with the statutes and judgments now watch what he's saying there's going to be a day when mercy lifts off of the Earth when the Holy Spirit is lifted from the Earth he that now leth will let until the man of sin comes and when he does that the iniquity iniquity is full and the spirit is lifted and then the law comes back into effect and who can live the law oh I thank God for Grace today I thank God there's still Grace I thank God that I made my decision I made my choice I've taken the right route trust you have as well oh that ought to make us this message not a message of of of of hardship or a message of that keeps you down or a message of legalism is a message of Grace Grace we either believe these things or we don't and I want you to look at this he says Remember You The Law of Moses behold I will send you who's he talking to who's he talking talking to you you young people I was listening to young people at camp and these are even younger but some of them will be going maybe next year if we if it Lord carries we this camp in Oklahoma's close enough we can support it and I've tried to do that and I have confidence brother wle and the people there that are running it but as brother Andrew Glover was preaching this weekend preaching preaching about the opening of the word and things to the young people but but they're the ones that have to receive it you've got to come to a place that he sent you Elijah the prophet and this message is for you and and it belongs to you and you can accept it you may not understand every little piece of it but you believe it it's for you now look behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet he sent him to me this message was not sent to just everybody it was sent to me personally it came that's why I can't leave it that's why I can't doubt it that's why I can't turn away from it it came to me that's why I preach it I know people don't like me using quotes all the time reading quotes I do that because because it's it's who I am him this message God was speaking to me sir before the coming now watch Elijah comes before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn I like I love that it'll be his ministry that does it he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse we're living in that time and we know John the Baptist didn't fulfill that scripture because he he the day of the Lord was not at hand at that time but now the day of the Lord is at hand right what was at hand then was the age of Grace but now what's at hand is the end of the age of Grace I want you to listen to me this morning I don't want to make you uncomfortable but it shouldn't make us uncomfortable if we're Believers but if we're not Believers if we're standing at that place where we don't know whether we're going to go stay in church or not we don't know whether it's right or not we don't know whether we should dress like he taught us to and act like he taught us to and live like he taught us to and treat people like he taught we don't know whether it's really right or wrong if you're standing in that place this morning you should be uncomfortable because that's where the world is in the valley of decision you got to move you got to move into the message of the hour or move into the tribulation period a one of the two even the saved Baptist Methodist people like that they're good saved people out there that's right that that believe on Jesus but they can't see the message of the hour they go through the tribulation period it's one or the other you don't it's either Rapture or tribulation one or the other we're living in that time I want you to understand that the message of the hour came as it was God's Arc it was God's Deliverance it was a message of Deliverance to bring bring us away from those things and I want to ask you this morning have you decided or are you standing at the crossroads do you know what who you believe do you know do you know why you go to church do you know why you come to the house of God you know why you even listen to tapes you may listen but do you know why you listen have you decided have you made your choice to stand there if your family doesn't see it if nobody else sees it if if the world doesn't see it no matter how they treat you you're going to stand for the message of the hour not because anybody's standing with you but because it's right entire Gentile World standing in limbo you know what limbo is the Greeks come up with limbo it was kind of the idea of purgatory to the Catholics you know it's just it's neither Heaven Nor Hell we don't believe in purgatory but the world is standing in limbo right what that what that means is they they don't know what they believe they don't know where they stand they don't know what's coming and fears on them but the I Bible says men's Hearts will fail for fear at the end time and we're seeing that time entire Gentile World standing in limbo waiting to see what judgment will come from the Lord because they passed mercy and so they wait to see what judgment but you and I are not waiting to see judgment we're waiting to see a body change we're not waiting for we're not waiting for for a time when when for of tribulation we're not prepping for tribulation we're prepping to get out of here are you with me this morning so they're waiting to see what judgment will come from the Lord now and you look at that sometimes and I know you got to make your decision and it's hard because sometimes you look at the world say well they they live better than I do and and they have more fun than I do or at least it looks that way on Facebook and and it looks like they're just enjoying life and here I've always had this conviction ition and I I want to serve the Lord and yet I see people in the world living like they do well you know David went through that or actually I think this was a Psalm of ASAP but he was standing there and he was looking and and he went through a place where uh where he thought well the world's going that way maybe I maybe I just go that way he didn't understand it and so he said this in Psalm 73 he said truly God is good to Israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone now some of youall I know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've been filled you've been sealed to the day of your Redemption and yet you stand in a place sometimes where you begin to wonder I wonder what's going on I wonder what's going to happen I wonder what's next I wonder I wonder if we're going to make it I wonder if if if if the message you'll Satan will introduce that to your mind and he has a right to your mind that's no man's land but he don't have a right to stay there because you're a born again believer so you can kick him out of your mind and and and Paul says whatever exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ kick it out tear down every stronghold of something that would be against the word amen but you stand there like like Asaf here in this Psalm and he's standing there and he's saying my feet were almost gone my steps had well not slipped for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked they can be happy and their families are happy and everything's just fine and you look at other the people today you look at people they can they can be they can commit unspeakable acts and be rich right and increase with goods and it seems like the worst they are the more better off they are God don't deal with you that way and there's a reason why he don't because you're the elect of God and every time you mess up something happens and you're checked and and some what is it the mercy of God you're corrected and and God doesn't judge you but he corrects you now now look he said that's for me my feet were almost gone was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm in other words it seem like they seem like they just die they don't they don't worry about it they're not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore Pride compasses them about as a chain violence covers them as a garment jump down to verse 12 he said behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verely he said I've cleansed my heart in vain washed my hands in innocency no let's just be honest we've all felt that way sometimes it seem like the world just do whatever they want to and here we are as Christians struggling striving trying to do what's right and it seems like everything's against us and and the world just turned towards them and not towards us but remember what I told you if you believe the word that the the fix is in but it's not against you it's for you the the actually the whole creation is rigged for you but but it it's not it's for your good it's not for what you think you might want right so so he says these are the ungodly he said I've cleansed my heart he said all the day long I've been plagued and chastened every morning if I say I will speak thus behold now look he's saying I I have these things in my heart but if I talk about it now and this is important he said I should offend against the generation of thy children so in other words if I sit here and complain right the kids are going to suffer from it if I have a bad attitude my my youth are going to suffer from it if if I'm not sure where I'm at you need to make sure you know cuz your kids know if you can't make up your mind your kids see that sir if you don't know whether you say well you know it seems like maybe we ought to just cut Corners here and we don't really have to live the message over here we can just do this or do that your kids see that they know whether you're cutting Corners they know what you're doing I'm so glad for I believe there will be a generation that'll sell out to the Lord I trust that's us this morning well sell out to this message might as well believe it right might as well believe it you know when you say something is true and you don't follow it people don't believe you well it's true but I just you know not for you know it's not real important ah truth is important truth is important if it's true it's important God said it there was a reason why he said it he said if I say it it'll offend the generation of the children yeah he was struggling in his heart I say this preachers have to watch that because sometimes we're our hearts are open when we're preaching and we just say whatever we whatever comes out and we got to be careful with that as we offend the children now look when I thought to know this it was too painful for me until I love this all right all right until I went to church brother westes yes I went into the sanctuary of God and it seemed like everything was going against me and it seemed like they just live any way they want to and prosper and I try to live a Christian Life and I get struggle after struggle after struggle but when I went to church when I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I there end he said I understood there's something coming for them surely he said thou did set them in Slippery places that's right they may they may be running down the road just as fast as they can go but there's ice on the road and they can't see it they don't know it they're going to fall and yet you walk down the road softly and carefully and it seems like you everything you do you're watching trying to live right trying to do what's right and they're just going full speed ahead but there's coming a place where it's slippery they're in Slippery places in fact if they if they passed in that sin brother BR talked about preaching the total lost and I don't want to get too far into that this morning but the world there are people who have passed Beyond even help and and they get to a place where it's just and I'm not talking about you this morning but people that don't want to be God anymore if you want God there's hope for you if you have a desire for God there's hope for you but but but these people that don't even desire anymore and they're just going as fast as they can and everything's going fine for them look at politics today look at the world today look at the church today do anything they want in the church and it just goes on nobody says anything but it's slippery places slippery places you can do what you want but it's a slippery Place go outside the word I'm not preaching at you this morning I'm not trying to hurt you I just I have a responsibility to declare the word of God I have a responsibility for myself to make sure that I follow word of God now look surely thou did set them in Slippery places thou castest them down into destruction how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with Terrors as a dream when one awaketh so oh Lord when thou awakes Thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved he said I was pricked in my Reigns there's that word again I was pricked by the Holy Spirit he said because I was foolish so foolish was I and ignorant he said I was as a beast before thee nevertheless I love this he said even when I questioned even when I didn't understand even when I when I was about to go the wrong road you saved me from it aren't you glad for that today even when I went down even when I tried to do the things that were wrong you saved me you brought me back to the house of God why he said nevertheless I am continually with thee thou has Holden me by my right hand Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to Glory whom have I in heaven but thee there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee Oh that ought be the Cry of our heart today we may not always understand why things are going like they're going we may not always understand what the world is going through and we may look out there and say well looks like they're doing pretty good maybe I should be more like them maybe I need more psychology maybe I need more of this that or the other maybe I need more maybe I need more what the world has maybe I need more fun maybe I need more alcohol maybe I need no no if you just look back and see that we depend upon the Lord whom have I in heaven but thee who there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever they're slippery places Leo to is in the valley of decision not deciding whether to serve God they've already done that but God deciding what to do with them oh my Revelation 3:14 to the angel of the Church of the L is right these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy Works Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire but th mayest be rich white rainment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with IA that thou mayest see he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock now look the age has rejected him but he stands at your door this morning and he knocks because there's a hope for you there's a chance for you you're still in a in a place where you can make a decision even though the world as a whole has gone down but you're in a place where you can make a decision you can turn right go you can go into the tribulation period you can turn left and go or whichever direction that it is and go right into the presence of God one choice one one instant one moment can make all the difference that's right I tell you what I do because of the times that we stand in because of the slippery place that the world is in I'd make a choice for God this morning I'd choose to follow him I choose to raise my family in the fear and admonition of the Lord I choose to believe the message I choose to do what a prophet said why because I don't want to stand in Slippery places I want to stand under the anointing of a prophet of the age want to stand under the word under an open book been released in our day an anointing to stand put his feet on the land and the sea oh my oh my that's that's the anointing that's been released in our age Christ put his feet on the land in the sea shows he had dominion over everything amen look many folks Get Fooled I'm just talking to you this morning as a pastor are you with me this morning many folks are fooled because they have material things they don't realize they stand in the valley of decision material things is not the answer if you're not careful those material things keep you out of church and you say Well church doesn't save me that's true that's true but when I went into the sanctuary I got my perspective back when I went into the sanctuary all week long the world poured their uh their nonsense on me all week long the devil breathed his unbelief on me but when I went into the sanctuary I felt I knew that God was God again I knew that the presence of God was real I could feel him I saw my brothers and sisters they could live like I'm living listen if you have a struggle in your life an addiction you ought to be at the house of God every time the doors are open even if you're not you ought to be at the house of God brother if the love of God is in your heart you ought to be at the house of God every time the doors are open why because it's the hour we're living in it'll take you from a place of unbelief to a place of Faith are you hearing me today sir people don't realize they stand in the valley of decision make decisions every day the end of the world is upon us right when I think of this I think of Samson as he was standing there and and and every time remember he lied to Delilah but you can only play with Delilah so long right you'll give away your secret you just can't lie and theila is the type of the world you just can't wait in the place of decision for that long you got to decide to give up Delilah and walk with the Lord but Samson gave the Lord his strength he gave him his muscles but he didn't give him his heart he gave Delilah his heart and he stood in that place and in such a place that he felt like that he was invincible in such a place he felt like well I'm the elected and he was sir I'm the Nazarite and he was I'm the one and I've done all these things and he had he' shouted in church he he he trusted God he believed he' been to the all he he' done all the things that believers do on now but he also played around with the world what did he do he finally gave her his secet SEC and she cut his hair off his hair was a sign of his Nazarite vow she cut his hair off when she did he he woke out of his sleep and he said well I'll you know I've been backslid but I'll go to church today and I'll come back and I'll feel the presence of God like I always did I'll be able to go listen it won't always happen that way well I know all week I've lived for the devil but now I'm I I'll correct it this morning I'll do it TR this morning it don't always happen that way she he gave away his secret and so he he said now he said I'm going to go out as at other times before I'm going to go Worship the Lord I'm going to go lift my hands but he gets in church and he realized he has no power to overcome the devil anymore he don't even have the power to want to go to church anymore he don't want to have the power to even want to be a Christian anymore he wish not that the Lord was departed from him he was so backslid laying in the lap of Delilah that he didn't even know he was backslid I want you to know this morning he's he said brother Ben well I'm waiting on that persecution to come down on the church and then I'll I'll make things right if you're waiting on a physical persecution to make your decision it'll never happen until it's too late you know there's a squeeze on today there's a squeeze but but it's like the famine that's on today right right he said it's not for bread and water it's not for material things it's for the hearing of the word of the Lord there's a squeeze on today brother brandom explains it in and we got time this morning we just got one service y'all bear with me I saw some of y'all's kids sitting out there last night but brother Joel sent me a picture of them sitting there after four hours of church still worshiping God most everybody else had left but they're still worshiping God I think we could worship him for an hour this morning anyway don't you think I believe his presence is here I believe his word is here do you love him this morning did you bring him with you I believe he's here amen now look he said there's a squeeze but it's not it's not what you think it is look brother randam always talked about a squeeze how they the doors they lock the doors and things like that but in Feast of the trumpets now remember up to this time brother brandom brother brandom thought that the trumpets would be something that that he could preach and would be applicable in some way to the church when he preaches Feast to the trumpets he said it's to the Jews yes right but there is a there's a side of it now the same thing that happens under the trumpets to the Jews happens under the seals to the bride right so so now in but it's in a spiritual form right so what's released under the seventh trumpet say the Jews released under the seventh seal to the bride so he types that now he says this he said what does that thing stand for he's talking about the Ecom iCal influence let me back up I I skipped down he said notice the loosening of this ecclesiastical Spirit what is ecclesiastical or he uses the word ecclesiastical or ecumenical what does that mean it's the worldwide influence of the church it's it's it's we're all we're all the same we'll all come together and and do that now brother BR is not preaching about Fellowship he's not preaching against fellowship with message people what he's preaching against is The ecumenical worldwide move that's on right now now look he said said notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years later after that war we see the loosing he said what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the Jew he said look at the Moon darkening out he said see it drawn out the son of man being drove from the church oh God what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical Bunch The ecumenical move with the World Council of churches he said has drove Every Man Has drove yes now watch he said what does that thing stand for why you have to surrender all your Evangelical teachings and things how can two walk together L they be agreed they can't Jesus said they can't and how can a church the Methodist and Baptist walk together how can the Church of Christ walk with the Presbyterians how can the Catholic walk with the Protestant how can Protestant walk with Protestant see they're all different denominations they've all got different ideas he said but the bride can walk with the word if you walk with the word I can walk with you the bride can walk with the word which is Christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word he said you have to agree with the the word to walk with the word Jesus said so that makes it right he said notice there she is now she's loosed now the same Devils remember in the Book of Revelation there were 200 million I think it is Riders horse riders there's not that many horses maybe in all the world but but but there Spirits a horse is a power right a beast is a power they're spirits and they were released in the natural sense under the trumpets under the beginning of that to under Hitler and nightman right and they'll be released in a much greater way during the tribulation period but now watch the 200 million released under Hitler to Hitler and nightman but they were also released under the seventh seal so the seventh seal is not open yet well you have a problem CU brother BR said they were released under the seventh seal right but they were released under the seventh seal on the bride he said no now there she is that's what he's talking about here he said now she's loosed all those demons that were sealed to the held to the end time amen that's why you see gay marriage legal today oh right that's why you see uh uh they won't stay with just being homosexual or lesbian they become a transgender and all of these things and they just keep on it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse it's been loosed but not just on the world on the bride but what's it been loosed on to call all these little Loose Ends what did a prophet do a prophet came in our age to teach us that the Loose Ends matter and tie them up now I've given you that example before but if you look at loose ends that that it's a colloquial expression what does it mean it means that you tied the knots on the ship right when before a sailor could leave the ship he had to tie up the Loose Ends because otherwise the captain walks back on the ship and gets hit in the face by a rope right you get down you get down in the or you get in a storm you got to tie up the Lo ends before you go through the storm oh God if we can just realize we need to this is the hour we need to tie everything down everything that can be shaken will be shaken we're going through a storm and so the these were loosed in the ecclesiastical realm to say all those little Loose Ends those little things you don't think is important in the message of the hour oh well doesn't make any difference anyhow I'm not talking about opinions about the message I'm about the message itself we've added lots of opinions we become Pharisees with that right but we're talking about the message itself doesn't make any we're talking about the scriptures we're talking about things that matter because the message goes back to the Bible now look doesn't make any difference it's all right he said surely God is a good god he loves us all he said he doesn't that's hard to swallow yeah but see they rejected his love they rejected his mercy and they stand in the valley of decision God's deciding what to do with them oh god oh look he said he loves us all he don't you hear so much about being a good god he's a good God but being good he has to be just there's no goodness without Justice there's no justice without no law without punishment penalty so we're in that hour that we're living that's where we were in 1964 and that's where we're at today that he's been loose to call all these little loose ends that they don't mean nothing oh it's time to tighten up church we don't we don't live uh lacad isical about these things we don't live haphazardly we don't we don't just say well I'll go to church and and the grace of God will cover me no now's the hour to button up now's the hour to tie down the hatches now's the hour to raise our families right now is the hour to kick out the things that are wrong and do what's right in our homes again this is the time you say well well you know I I got some things things I know you know bothers me but but I'm a Christian I'm saved yes you are I believe that I'm not taking that away from you but if it bothers you why don't you just get rid of it it won't bother you no more if you feel conviction but you have a question about it don't do it so if you have to hide it from everybody and you know right just let Let It Go you won't have to worry about it no more you can come to a place like the old song says do you know how it feels lay your head on the pillow at night and know that your sins have been forgiven know that you believe the message of the hour listen you won't walk you won't do everything right that's what Grace is for you won't that's what the blood is for you'll make mistakes but you don't do it deliberately you don't go down and sit at the bar and sit there and say well God I'm waiting on you to keep me from drinking get out of the bar are you with me now you sit at home and and and every Wednesday night you sit down you you you you get to ready to go to church you well you know uh there's a good show on tonight well we'll just stay home and watch at this time and we'll be all right we're we're elected yeah you're you're elected you're you're children of God but if you keep doing that it's going to make a difference in your family and it won't be a good difference it'll be a wrong difference it's time to we're we're living in too late of an hour to do the it's time to step up it's time to stand there and take the right Road I mean to yell at you but the scriptures we waiting on a physical squeeze say well there'll come a time they'll close the church doors now look we're getting into uh Christ as a mystery we did that years ago at brother iy and it meant so much to me personally I'm doing it here Christ is the mystery of God revealed on Wednesday nights and with the Brandon in there he'll tell you about locking the church doors an article that he read but then at the end he said before they can close us up we go up so I'm not prepping to be closed up I'm prepping to get out of here that's why I know Co was not the tribulation period cuz I'm still here right and maybe there was some things there that we can see how they would do it but but that's that wasn't a tribulation period it's going to be so much worse than that I tell you what you saw how much power the government had then amen scared some people look there's no said there's no without law now look it may happen in isolation you say well you know we're waiting on a physical squeeze to come well in Nigeria and Chad and where uh Brother Wilson's in Africa I think right now and in some part of Africa and some of those countries he goes to that they uh you know they have a a physical squeeze it does happen we're not the only ones that believe the message in America right it does happen but but brother B taught us that America would be would it's it's the fullness of Lea it's without it's rich and increased in Goods I even noticed in Africa when I went back this time to Togo it's so backwards like it's it's beyond backwards but when I went this time I noticed there's more cars more affluence and they're Fallen when I first went there I noticed that they' had gone through Co and everything and where they used to be on fire and it was real quiet you say well that doesn't matter it does matter and it's not because the noise itself doesn't mean anything mean noise at a ball game it's not the noise it's whether or not people are on fire for God you can be on fire for god without making a lot of noise but most of you will make a little bit of noise at least right you get hit with a hammer see if you make noise right you get sick get a real good real bad cold see if some of us guys will make noise we'll make noise oh honey I'm dying get the man flu one time see if you make noise absolutely you make noise but sometimes in church we we just need to get stirred up but I watch those people they they they just weren't like they used to be and then as we had church as they went into the house of the Lord they begin to feel better and by the time I left it was just like it always was but when I first went there because usually you don't have to preach Africans into uh into anything they're already there they come church that way you almost had to tone it down but but they weren't there when I first went back this last time and it it really struck my heart Leo deia is even even across the seas it's getting two people as they get better jobs and better things and there's nothing against that I want you to have good jobs trust me I want you to have good jobs but as you have better jobs and as you have more money don't forget what got you there don't forget to be don't be like the pig sitting under the apple tree that never looks up to see God has blessed you there must be a reason don't forget God now majority of this age will be rich and increased in Goods I know you're sitting there thinking I wish that happened to me but if you'd recognize I I heard a historian the other day they said the the poorest person in the world today lives better than Kings did in the 16th century that'll that'll bring you a little perspective I I heard someone say that John Rockefeller lived in the 30s your middle class average American he was the richest man that's ever lived I think he today his worth would be hundreds of billions of dollars that man if he lived today he would it lived the lifestyle he did then with all that money every one of you lived better than he did you may not believe it's the truth and I know it's getting harder and inflation's coming on and things are happening oh church if you could just see as a pastor I understand the worst challenge the the church has is not poverty the wor worst challenge is saying I'm rich and increased in Goods not recognizing what what what hour that you're in because the world stands in a siery place listen brother BR said National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride you believe that today he said the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the in her place it won't be me it won't be you it'll be the spirit of God who put the bride in her place amen cuz she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place when she realizes who she is and that's what the message does it shows you who he is and that shows you who you are she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the church into Glory out of it do you believe that this morning aren't you glad for that and yet multitudes today stand in the valley of judgment waiting on the tribulation period Revelation 19 17 he said I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fouls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourself together into the supper of the great God that you may eat of the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains the Flesh of Mighty Men the Flesh of horses them that set on them the Flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and the Beast was taken with him the false prophet verse 20 that wrought Miracles before him with which he deceived them they received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His Image and these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with Brimstone the day of the Lord is at hand I say make your decision now we're right here look at Revelation chapter 6 that's the Sixth Seal the tribulation seal that I beheld when he'd opened the Sixth Seal Lo there was a great earthquake the sun became black as tackle of hair do you see a pattern here the sun being dark here in about a month we're going to have an eclipse it's going to go completely dark here where we live hundreds of people thousands of people they told me West Plains is expecting 300,000 people there's no way 300,000 people going to fit in West Plains but but they're expecting people to come unless it rains you talk about dashed expectations but they expecting all these people to come was what for to watch the oh God to watch the sun become black but even in an eclipse there's a little bit of sun it's behind there somewhere and it only lasts for a moment but during this time it blacks out completely completely Moon becomes his blood the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind the heaven departed as a stroll and strolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the child the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond man man and every free man hid themselves in the dens in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us there come a suicidal Spirit on the age you realize we're I told you you're the most affluent society that's ever been and also the most suicidal amen think about it for a minute oh church we don't want that we don't want that to get on us we don't want that to get on us make the right decision walk with God there was an hour to walk with God today the hour to walk with God they said to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne from the Wrath of the Lamb the great day of his wrath has come who shall be able to stand yet people sit and squabble with one another over Petty things the day of the Lord is at hand make yourself ready you don't want to believe like I believe you want to do something a little bit different in your church go ahead the day of the Lord is at hand we just got to follow the word as closely as we can follow it make things right get the hour to make things right brother the brandom tells us said just watch stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister of the Gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're R in Christ because that's the only thing he said because we're in the most deceiving age we ever lived in it would deceive the very elected if it was possible I'm glad it's not possible he said because they have anointing they can do anything like the rest of them he said clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said now he said I mean not like your house rent and stuff he said he said you got to do it he said get all your things off your hands now what's he saying there you pay your debts don't owe anybody anything if you owe somebody an apology make it right sit there with condemnation in your heart because you swindled somebody out of something or pulled a shady business deal make it right clean up your lives I've seen so many people I've never seen and can I just preach for a minute I've never seen a place as you know whatever I around and I've been around this area for many many years I'm not criticizing you I believe you're real Christians but I watched some of the elders in the area and they were they were they were men who claim to believe this message and have Ministries and gifts and boy they if you if you cross them way they believe one little bit boy they'd fight with you but they couldn't pay their debts what I mean by that is not that they were poor and had got foreclosed on I mean they wouldn't do what was right they'd Swindle people in business deals take advantage of people come on come on church that's not what a prophet taught us get everything right pay your debts make [Music] ready how you sit there with something in your heart against somebody and try to preach the gospel you realize what a dangerous thing that is you can't do that let it go it's too late of an hour pay your debts owe no man anything not even an apology get all your things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen look the valley of decision could be a good place if you make the right decision BR says everybody wants a Hilltop experience they never want to take the valley said everybody the Pentecostal Church too every night if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues running around over the floor or something other you didn't have any kind of a meeting you said well you know it's all right to be on the mountain top that's good right if you're never on the mountain top you never get to experience the joy of the Lord right that's the truth that's just the truth but you can't stay up there God didn't design you to stay up there because when the cold spell comes your fruits will freeze up there at night and you lose all your fruit so that's what's happened now we put too much on mountaintop experiences dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of all night prayer meetings look I was so proud of our kids this weekend I I'll say this I won don't want to embarrass them when they're here maybe we'll get some testimonies I was so proud of them you you wouldn't have even known them I was so proud of them because they they stayed together as a group and they treated one another right and everything I could see that they treated one another right and everything was was going good and y'all may have heard the horror stories of the bunks and all that but you know Camp is a hard place sometimes we need to be a little hard on the flesh but they treated one another right but we had those Mountaintop experiences people shouting dancing enjoying the presence of the Lord but we also had that Valley experience and we got to have that in church I seen them kids get get down on their knees and on their faces spending some time with the Lord making sure they knew what they believed and what they stood for I think there ought to be more of that in the house of God not just Mountaintop experiences we love that we need some of them Valley experiences and the valley of decision where you have to come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place said we've grow fruits up there but the freeze kills it every time it comes a little cool spell you got nothing to rest upon he said when the emotion dies down the Shadows all gone the noise ceases he said where you at the Temptation comes along you can't take it what we need is to get down to that grinding place down there in the valley dig out that's exactly right it's where the church needs to be he's talking about when they went and dug the valley full of ditches because the rain's coming that's the way we ought to do that's the way every every one of our church services ought to be a digging time get ready because the spirit of God's coming you won't see wind you won't see a cloud but the rain's coming there's water coming the presence of God's going to be there that's where the church needs to be tonight Ruth and orpa want to get to this before I close they we're in the valley of decision now I want you to understand that if you were going to go from Moab to Israel you had to pass through the valley now think about this with me for just a moment just like we got to go through leoa to get to the Rapture we're not of leoa We're the bride this is the bride time the bride age but we passed through leoa right and so I don't know how well you can see that but that's a map I can't hardly see it without my glasses but it's a map of Ruth's journey and what she did is she was a moabitas right she had no claims on God she was a gentile that's us right no claims on God but she had married a Jewish boy who was backslid because one that a you know God and and sometimes God God he's in control of Our Lives we just got to trust him sometimes we make wrong decisions but he still we got to trust him he knows what's best right but but but she shouldn't have you know he shouldn't have ever married her right they should have never went down there but they did and God used it I'm so glad God takes the broken places he takes the scars as I preached here not long ago and pours gold into them and it becomes the place the scars become the value of of the of the dish the scars become the valuable part because we've overcome and but she come up out of Moab and Moab is a land doesn't believe in God don't believe in anything but it's in the valley and if you if you looked at a topographical map of of of the land of Palestine of Israel there's a there's a great valley on the other side of the river Jordan in the Dead Sea and that Valley is where the the mobites are down to the South and over to the right now some of that was given to the children of Israel but up on top you see it's called The Plains of Moab and so they Journey the Bible tells us that even lot you know when when Abraham gave him his choice he's he's standing there at the middle and he's looking down he said in the plane the Bible calls it the well-watered plane it's not today God judged it but it was the well-watered plane and he looked down there and he saw that and he he recognized that that was that's the way he wanted to go because he was thinking with a carnal mind Abraham gave him his choice but Abraham went up to the mountain amen and there he met God and God changed his his body back amen amen I don't have time to go into all that but look that's where lot went it's down in the valley it's where Israel went after refusing to go in at Kadesh barnea Kadesh barnea is down at the bottom when they didn't go in kades Baria they went up the wrong side of the Dead Sea and they go up towards the River Jordan but they stayed in the plains of Moab they could they didn't go over they didn't cross on over into the land oh my oh Church you could just see it they didn't stay in they didn't stay in the land and so in Deuteronomy 348 it says the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab that's where a lot of people still are in the plains of Moab but God didn't leave us without without the Holy Ghost brother Brandon being a type of both Moses and Joshua this message didn't only leave us out didn't only lead us out it brought us in amen but you got to go into it you got to follow it in and so so we find that Naomi and Ruth and Naomi's sister-in-law orpa were on their way Way to Bethlehem and there was a last exit to the plains of Moab kind of like driving if you drive to Oklahoma you get to Joplin it's his last free exit if you leave any later place going to cost you oh my last pre-exit so here the roads diverged here was the crossroads and they could go one way and I could see it in my mind as they they come to this place and to the left is the mountains to the right is the plain of Moab we can either stay in familiar territory or go up into into Heavenly places right so they're here in the plane of Moab and they're sitting there and they're just what what do we do and so the Bible tells us in R 1:7 speaking of Naomi Naomi is a type of the word said wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was also a type of the Jewish Church went forth out of the place where she was her two daughters and in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah they went on their way and they made it through justification and sanctification they made it to a place where to go any further they would be in see Judas made it to that place one more step one more step but he was still just a step away from The Plains of Moab that's right right that's where so many people live live they come to church they're one step away oh God they've left what they used to do they've let some things get cleaned up in their life they well things are pretty good but but you've One Step from doing what you did again and being who you were you got to cross over into the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you don't do it you're going to be like that man that was delivered that that of of of a devil but he swept the house and garnish it but then seven other Devils come and live there that devil come back and seven more with him what was it he didn't have no Goodman of the house there was nobody there listen the King has to take up residence on the inside you stand there and you come to church and I appreciate that I listen you say well I failed this week come back to the house of God I messed up come back keep coming back don't quit don't quit you're still in the valley of decision don't go the wrong way don't go down to the in the moam just go back to what you were stay there but you can't stay there forever understand you got to go this way you got to go up in the mountain I hope I'm not boring you this morning listen she went forth out of the place where she was and her daughters inlaw with her they went on the way to return to the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her two daughter-in-law go return each to her mother's house they come in conflict with the word where it would be easier to just go to the plane of Moab because the word told them look Naomi told them go return each to your mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me go and just be regular people go and just live like leoda they must have stood there at the edge of the valley One Step from the Hill Country where all the promises lay they both wanted to stay with her Bible tells us that they said unto her surely we will return with thee un thy people and she said I can't have any more children all I can promises hardship the valley of Moab is waiting nothing bad ever happens there you can go down there and and live like you always lived oh but I'm so glad that I made that decision with the bill to walk up the mountain I'm so glad I didn't stay in the valley of decision but I went forward and they lifted up their voice they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpa kissed her mother-in-law oh God Judas kissed Jesus he tried to what was it they lived just good enough to satisfy their conscience oh we can't live there church you'll betray him you'll betray him when the when push comes to shove it's going to get hard there's going to be tough times you'll turn him down but you got to go on even Peter betrayed him but he had to go on because he was a seat of God God there was forgiveness for him there was a place of repentance and he went down and got the Holy Ghost and he never denied him again he went up in the mountain but Judas went down in the valley and hung himself that you can go down there you can have a life without the word dress any way you want to live any way you want to not feel condemnation but I'm here to tell you that if you get it right what I mean by that is you get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no condemnation up here either the condemnation is because you're down here in the valley of decision that's what that's why you that's why you have a hard time worshiping you just remain down in that Valley but if you could ever get up on a mountain the message would mean something to you then because it it's what brought you there look Ruth clav to the word and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back into her people under her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee whether thou goest I will go where thou lodgest I will Lodge th people shall be my people sir and thy God my God where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if I ought but death part thee and me I believe we had some young people this weekend that made that decision and say I'm going to go with this message I'm going to believe it I'm going to live it I believe some of you right there make that decision this morning walk forward with God go forward into the mountains of God go into the promised land yes there'll be hard times yes there'll be struggles yes yes there'll be time but Boaz is waiting there there's a place for you there there's a uniting with the word in the promised land Hallelujah she said the Lord so do do so to me and more also ought but death part the in me she made her decision the valley of decision brother BR said oh how I like that little Ruth she had to make a decision I had to make a decision you've got to make a decision never walk out of these doors this morning without some kind of a decision you'll not leave this room today with either being a better man or woman or a worse man or woman to reject it you'll be worse it'll be harder next time for you to get it oh and you feel that pole that tug follow it follow it amen you Christians even some of you filled with the Holy Ghost you're good you you've lived this much longer than I have decades but when you feel that tug follow it amen that's the word responding to your cry as the spirit of God coming down to anoint the word that you've heard and the word that dwells in you follow it you say well I'm I'm born again I'm a Believer follow the word follow the the inclination of the word follow the pull of the word it's leading you to the Rapture listen this isn't we're not at the end of it we're not our full adoption we we believe we're adopted by the message of the hour but our full adopted adoption is a new body we're not going to live like this all of our lives with the JT there's going to come a day when you'll be just as strong as I am and I may a lot stronger than I am right now there's coming a time when the hair is going to come back and the hair is going to turn back oh my church if you just recogniz we're right there if the world is standing in the multitude standing in the valley of decision waiting One Step takes them in the tribulation period Do You Realize where you're at church do you realize where you're at you're you're one step away from the Rapture and we told you here long ago job said he counts my steps he Oh Glory to God he knows exactly how many steps I have left it might be the next moment it might be the next day it might be 10 years from now but you're just a step away Right From Another Dimension go to the land where all the promises l b said come and Showdown in her life it comes a showdown in everybody's life Ruth had to make a decision so the Bible said her mother-in-law told her go back to your Gods like your sister did go back like the lukewarm did why don't you go back he said the gospel preacher if you want to go go on oh God the real truthful preacher that'll put it before class of people you make your decision you stand on your feet lukewarm wishy washy in and out won't say that but a real servant of God will lay it on your lap make your decision Ru said I'll go where you you go your people will be my people your God will be my God where you live I'll live where you die I'll die where you're buried I'll be buried there's the real decision Lord I'll take you as my savior if the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that I'll do if the Bible said I must receive the holy ghost that I'll do if the Bible tells me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that I'll believe I'll take the Bible in God for what he's wrote and what he is no matter what anybody else said there's the real Ruth she made her decision she either had to go back or go forward we stand on the same grounds this morning let's go he said don't don't never go back Church let's go forward you may not be where you want to be this morning but don't ever go back you you you you receive something from the Lord but Kevin you don't don't go back go forward there's only one way to go is forward you say well I'm not maybe you make mistakes all of us do we make mistakes and you say well now I made a mistake I might as well down in the valley of Moab no go forward go forward you're going to make your mistakes you're going to have your struggle but go forward press the battle we're good we're right there we're at the end time it's too late to mess around go forward don't never go back let's go forward musicians come this morning want bow your heads with me and close your eyes you can't you can only stand so long in the valley you know what was in the valley Jericho was in the valley the brand said that's why the man the Good Samaritan did he picked up the man the man was backslid he was going the wrong direction going towards Jericho Oh my he was going down from Jerusalem you can only stay so long in that Valley without falling among Thieves go up go forward though I've already made my decision for Christ well maybe maybe you just maybe you've let depression come in and obscure the sunlight of God's love in your life maybe maybe you've let trials and that joy that you had it's just not there like it was you can't keep living like that go forward press toward the mountain of the High Calling of God press forward what what is your decision this morning you get to make it I can't make it for you you can only stand so long in the valley you want your family to be on fire for God don't make us wait until your kids get older and then try to get them on fire for God to revive you you let your home be be a place where the presence of God could dwell while they're [Music] little your grandparents you make a difference in your grandkids lives say well I can't control my children but your grandkids are around you all the time why don't you why don't you just make your home a place where the token is on display what's your decision today you can't stand in the valley of decision cuz it's a slippery place you make the wrong decision but if there's something inside of you a seat of God it got turned like Ruth did see Jericho has already been cursed they said ' don't rebuild the city walls Ahab rebuilt it you see what happened to Ahab don't rebuild Jericho don't go back where you were in the valley go up in the mountains with Abraham make the right decision follow the word quit quit quibbling with the message
