appreciate everybody that's here and this is just won't take but a few minutes and it's a few things that uh just you know we're humans and we have to be reminded occasionally of a few things that we should not be doing or maybe we hadn't thought about but uh get this here uh we got a few things that uh this was uh brought to from from several different people I mean this just didn't come from me so I'm just here like the postmaster I'm bringing some stuff that you may like and some of it you may think's not yours and few things that you just don't care about but remember one just I just ask that you remember one thing that deacons here this church love you people yes we're here to to serve you and uh excuse me I I get broke up when I try to do something like this but just pray for me that I can bring this in a way that you can understand what we're trying to tell you and know that we're not taking it out none of this stuff are we taking out on anybody in particular it's just a few things we'll start with uh the list that was made and uh this is concerning the the younger kids or the older kids either whoever whoever it may concern or you you'll know who you are uh we have we have a lot of small children we don't have as many as we had before because a lot of them have M moved past the coloring books and everything else and they're up here on the front row and we're proud of them yes the other thing is we got some when people we got I know some of you got your favorite chair and your favorite blanket because sometimes it's not so warm in here and sometimes you get a little uncomfortable so if you got those things in here that's fine only thing we asked that and the there's some uh younger kids have to have their coloring books and stuff like that we just ask that you try to reverence the house of God and be quiet and at the end of the service if you would there's a book case in the in the nursery back there if you would take your stuff that you leave here try to leave here uh back there so it's not in the church CU it makes it it makes it a lot easier on the people that try to clean the church if the stuff is not everywhere and we just ask you to put it in a place if you got blankets fold them up if you want to leave them in your chair except on a special occasion if you want to leave them fold them up neatly and put them in your seat that's fine too or your Bibles or stuff just leave them in a neat fashion and because what happens is when we have people we got we have usually several visitors every service and they come in here and they see people stuff in the seats and everywhere else they then they get to wondering where they're going to sit and if someone's not re right by to help them then that's a problem but it it don't it's not a problem it's just something we need to watch and uh the children after Services uh there's some running in and out uh and we just ask you to uh reverence the sanctuary of God brother brandom told us about those things that how we could run the service for the next few times by a kid running in and out of the church or something and and uh I I was raised back in the day when brother Brown said first said these things and some of them was maybe taken over a little over seriously or whatever but when when I was a young kid if you if you moved into church you better have a good reason for it if you wasn't sitting still so and we're not telling you that you can't come in here and and move or I'm not saying that I'm just saying things have changed over the years we've growed up spiritually and naturally also so uh one thing we had we had some people people get into the sanctuary even over in the fellowship hall and kids we've had some kids almost just run them down not not meaning to but they bump into them and when you get a little old your balance is not as good as it used to be we've had a few we've had incident with some people just fell around here but not to do with the kids but we're just asking you to watch your children and don't let them run in and out especially in the sanctuary we ask you when the service is over here at uh when we dismiss leave quietly and get from the sanctuary out to the foyer and if you can just move move on out of that forer what we have is everybody that forer is not real big and everybody gets right in the door and then the people that's left in here can't get out of the service and sometimes we've got people that's in here after the service the musicians are still playing and there's people worshiping just sitting in their seats worshiping we'd like for you to just go on out so we can shut those doors and keep the racket down from there to hear and and watch how loud you get back there until you make it outside and then we don't care how loud you are want you get out the doors but but just try to watch that a little bit uh you know if Deacon makes say if you got a if we got a kid here that runs in and out all the time we may ask him if you you know talk to him and see if we can help him to cut his trip down a little bit but we're not not here to ball anybody out and we're not here to hurt anybody's feelings for sure and we just got these things that we got to take care of over in the fellowship hall uh especially around the drink table at lunch when we have lunch over there if you will help us watch your children and other grown-ups can watch other children too we got a lot of the kids like to play with those cups and straws and coffee filters but or not coffee filters coffee stirs and stuff but uh we've had the kids like to use them for toys and they they cost quite a bit of money to go buy that stuff so and we're not asking you not to use the coffee stirs but just let's just be careful watch your children let's try not to waste stuff and after we leave out of that out of there and after a service if you would just each and one every one do your part let's try to pick up the trash and don't leave it for somebody else to do when you're it's not real bad but sometimes it becomes a a trashy looking stuff somebody has to pick all that stuff up so we like to keep it looking nice so and some of you bigger some of your bigger children some of you professional Rock throwers we have a little bit of a problem around here the other day before the Fall Festival we got to cleaning up in the church yard out here is full of those big old rocks and I don't know if we was trying to see who could throw the biggest one the furthest but the guy that does the lawn mour is not real proud of you when he comes out here to mow the grass so we like i' like to ask you to please if you got to throw rocks wait till you get home or somewhere don't don't be doing it here because it causes a problem out there and a after the service is over and people get ready to go home ask you to this is for everybody watch your watch the kids out here somebody if somebody's leaving the church kind of watch watch for them too cuz this is a small area out there and we don't want anybody getting run over and it it can happen we've had it we've seen it happen before and heard incidents that didn't turn luckily I've never been around one it was a serious problem but I've seen some kids have some close calls because if you're backing out of there when you get a little older your neck don't turn just quite as far as it used to and you start backing out of there and know some of these kids don't stick up high enough you can't see them so let's just everybody work together on that and then another thing is this intersection out here where you pull out on this road I ask you when you're coming to church or when you're leaving church be be very very careful out there cuz there's been some close calls there a time or two so that's a that's a bad place because you can't see it for a long ways from any direction and we do have people there's a place right up here the road that people some of them people coming out of there just can't drive real good because of the shape they're in when they leave there so watch out for them you I know that uh I've had I've had a close call out there myself real close the guy came around that curve behind and I was looking in my rearview mirror and I was just about ready to see if I couldn't just go on down the road and he finally got almost off in the ditch and kept from hitting me but just keep these things in your mind I know that that's not we didn't come to church to hear this stuff this morning but uh uh I think that pretty much covers the bulk of it the main thing I want you to know that little kids and big kids the deacons here this church love you and we're here we're here to serve you if you ever need anything that we can do for you to help you please don't hesitate to let us know what it is if you got any questions about anything that's going on here that's fine too just ask us if we can't answer it we'll find someone that can for you that's that's about takes care of [Applause] that gosh and sister Letta come up let's sing that song fill my way with love you you can stand for moment if you want to as they're getting ready to come and sing and and uh we appreciate our deacons around here don't we amen we sure do we love them love them a lot and and uh they're just doing their job and they're doing it just as as as

the word of the Lord this morning amen do you come expecting something from God Amen I believe that if you expect it you can have it this morning right here in this service you don't have to wait for a meeting you can have it right here this morning amen amen let's sing this one oh papa God you save me from my old life you forgave me oh you cleansed and made me whole you changed my heart you Chang

meet every one of these needs that were made known by way of uplifted hand we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you this morning isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen I I just want to say how much I appreciated the uh word from Brother Danny this morning the things that he said I uh I appreciate the deacons doing their job and whether it's my family or myself I I know I need to be reminded every now and then of what to do and and how to act in the house of the Lord but I what I appreciate is so much was how he reiterated his love and the love that the deacons have for the people here in the church and you need to hear that sometimes and our families need to hear that from us we love you and you need to hear that from your pastor you need to hear that from the deacons we love you that's why we do what we do our deacons aren't paid they don't get any kind of a financial uh benefit from doing what they do but they've given their lives to the gospel I appreciate that you appreciate our deacons let's give them a hand this morning I really appreciate that it makes my job that much easier to preach to you and and talk to you this morning Matthew 11:28 we appreciate the spirit of the Lord Brother joshu is going to preach for us this afternoon so we're looking forward to that 3 o00 Matthew 11:28 come unto me all all ye that labor and are heavy laden I will give you rest take my yoke upon you he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me but for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light now I want to also turn to 2 Corinthians 6:14 2 Corinthians 6:14 be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness what Concord hath Christ with bile what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people I pray Lord would add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning the word yoke it's y ke we had a little error this morning on the stream it said y l k so I'm not preaching about eggs this morning the word yoke can denote a type of wooden device uh used to in different parts of the world to harness animals that have been bred and trained to pull heavy loads no known as draft animals and uh the a draft animal or uh maybe an ox would be maybe the the thing that they would use the most actually pulls the strongest or the hardest load and Ox would be something that uh you use to break ground with to pull a very a very heavy load with and a yoke would look something like this and so a yoke is something that uh you you put you when you have a Yol when you're yolked with something means you're pulling the same direction it means that uh you're moving you're doing the same thing you you can't get out of a yoke it it is what it is you're you're stuck there with whatever uh other uh type of animal that they would be yolked with now uh being yolked with someone means that when you move they move when uh when they move you move you you do nothing outside of of each other and and so it was very important that yolked animals were of a a similar size a similar strength and even similar temperament right because you don't want an animal that's going to be real flighty and jump real quickly to be put there with an ox you wouldn't want a a thoroughbred horse to be yed up with an ox because they've got completely different temperaments so they even even they'll raise animals together and they'll actually bring them up as uh as pears they'll get two little milk cows and and they'll make ears out of them and they'll bring them up together they'll raise them together and actually they don't make cow tears out of the cows I know Joel I you all know what I'm talking about they take two Cals and they make steers out of the calvs and they raise them together and when they're raised together what happens is aren't you glad to enjoy the house of the Lord this morning what happens is they get to where they move together right and they live together and they eat together and everything that they do is together together well I think that's the way we ought to be in the house of God I think that's the way we ought to be with one another it's the way especially in our marriages and different things that we do we ought to do things together and most of all we should do things with Christ yes sir so you find that yolked animals so they've got to be raised together and and even if you have yolked animals that pull together a pair of ox and say that pull together for a long time when one of them dies they don't put another Ox with the other one they actually retire him and the reason is because he's learned to pull with that particular animal it' be very difficult for him to learn a different kind of animal right and in the Old Testament uh it was actually Moses told the people he said don't he said don't yoke a donkey and and an ox together now that's an odd pairing isn't it you know some things you you shouldn't even have to say it but but they did say it nanny it's good to see you back there this morning God bless you my uh my wife's great grandmother's here this morning good to see you this morning let's give her a hand it's been a while since I've seen her but when you when you yoke if you take a donkey and yoke that with a with a ox what would happen is you'd have a little donkey that's flighty and scared and weak and the ox is going to be pulling the load plus the donkey right right see you don't want so to be yolked if you're a person that has the temperament of an ox you don't want to be yolked with the temperament of a donkey that's right right because you're going to be doing two completely different things now the donkey has his purpose and the Yoke has his purpose but you don't want to yoke them or or the the ox has their purpose but you don't want to yoke them together right now I'm going to take the most obvious application of this this morning which is in marriage and then we're going to move on to uh uh maybe some something spiritual because this isn't the point of the sermon this morning is not a uh marriage counseling or anything like that but I guess if the shoe fits we have to wear it but it would be as I said very difficult to plow with animals of different kinds it's very difficult for people of different Natures especially a Believer and an unbeliever to be married right right because when you're married you're more tightly yolked with someone than in any other relationship in your life you can even get away from your kids when they get older I promise you there'll be come a day brother Spirit you'll be able to get away from your children there is that that's coming but you won't ever get to that place with your wife I think brother Joel told me that one guy said he'd found the uh the secret to a happy life he said he and his wife he said they they go out on dates twice a week he goes out on Wednesday and she goes out on Thursday but but it's not really possible to do that it's not really how it works because you're yolked together for for richer or poor how many said that when you got married for richer or poorer in sickness and in health for good or for bad and whatever happens till death do us part so that's the promise that we make now in Matthew 193 Jesus the Pharisees come to Jesus and they begin to talk to him and they tempted him and said to him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause in other words just whenever he wants to yeah verse four and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let not man put a if God has joined you and your wife together it is not possible for man to put that aunder oh I think we ought to believe marriage is for life when you're unequally yolked in marriage it causes both parties to suffer now just like the ox with the donkey the ox would rather not have to drag the donkey along right and the donkey would rather not have to be dragged Along by the ox and so there's constant uh ition in the home that's right because there's an unequal yoke right so we and and no matter what we do it doesn't just apply to marriage it applies to business relationships it applies to churches you you can't be unequally yolked you need to go to church where there's something you can believe in there something you can have confidence in something a place where you can worship freely you need to go to that kind of a church and I'll say this if that's not here you need to find someplace where you can go to the house of God and worship God the way that the the way that God moves through you and and to do that and and so you need to find a place where you can be yolked together and you can work together for the same thing amen so we don't want to make other people suffer so I will say this to our our young people and children you want to marry a Christian because you don't want to make your spouse your future spouse suffer and it will actually be a point of suffering with your future spouse if they are an unbeliever and you're a believer there will be a a a suffering there because they don't want to do what you're what you want to do there there's no agreement when it comes to the most important thing which is Christ now brother brand talks about that he said you know there's still a good thing young man to think about or young woman now I'm going to add a little bit here and not not adding to what brother brandom said but just to what I would say about this this doesn't stop when you're young yeah just because you're older doesn't give you license to just go date or marry whoever you want to that's right because you're a widow or a widower and I know we have several here and I know none of you are looking and none of you are going to get married but just in case you were it it doesn't give you a license to go marry somebody outside of the faith just because you have some years on you brother BR says marry someone who is a Christian don't marry unbelievers yoke yourself not up among unbelievers Paul said for us not to do that the scriptures all through forbid us to yoke ourselves with unbelievers but I like this he said but if you're already yoked up with an unbeliever and he's willing to live with you or she in peace don't leave them just remain and live a Christian life that you might win your companion to Christ and I'll say if you're in that situation you might find yourself having to drag them to church sometimes or but but be careful with that you've got to work within the limitations of that person because they're not they don't have the same nature that you do and so you got to work within their limitations you can't just get angry with them you married them that way yeah right right so you have to work within if if they've got the nature right now of the world you got to not that you would be worldly yourself or be sinful yourself but you got to recognize that right let them be who they are but you be who you are be a real Christian be somebody who can be a light to everybody else around youl be somebody that can that can project such an overwhelming love that there's nothing they could do but love you if you're going to be a preacher be a preacher that everybody can see there's a real Christian they they may not be able to preach their way out of a wet paper bag but there's a real Christian if you're going to be a deacon be a deacon that people can say yes he's a deacon I don't always agree with what he says but there's a man of God there's somebody who lives it aren't you glad for that I could I could put names on that today if you're going to be a deacon be a Danny Ward be a harvey Savage be a be a Caleb San if you're going to be a preacher be a Joel prud or or if you're going to be a preacher be a Josh Martin if you're going to be a preacher be a steuart Duckworth be a man I believe these men live for what they preach be a man that'll live What You Preach be a a spouse that they can say there's a real Christian somewhere amen oh do you believe that today amen I might say this morning and I I'm going to get off marriage after a little bit I promise but let me just say this you say brother Ben my circumstances are different I know people carry a lot of baggage and all of our all of us have made mistakes yes even in the most important things in life doesn't mean you're going to hell I'll say this do you still love Jesus brother brand said if you still love Jesus you haven't gone too far yeah wonder you s something in your heart that reaches out for God just wants to you haven't gone too far you can still you can if you still have something in your heart that desires the things of God grab a hold of that just do do you said well I can't take that full step today take the partial step do what you can let God do the rest because when the the prodigal son was on his way home when he was a far off the Bible says brother the georan said last week when he was yet a far off the the father sees him a far off and he runs to him and he finds that he was not just a servant he would not be just a servant but he'd be given a robe and a and a ring and and get and the fatted calf would be killed for him because he was a son he was always a son he never stopped being a son are you with me so far this morning he said my circumstances are different brother BR said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances that always marry Believers yeah but it's not just marriage brother brandom talks about making a mistake we let our children play with little Oswald he calls him he said I don't mean to be a different now and starchy but some kind of fanatic he said but you be sure who your daughter goes out with at night time I don't want to embarrass my daughter tonight but I'm told I pick on Peter more than I do Esther I don't want to embarrass Esther this morning but uh you know when she was in when they were in public public school I I had to deal with a little situation where a boy was uh was working on trying to uh get into her life and and become a part of her life and I I was watching that relationship closely and uh we don't allow our children to date marry talk we allow them to talk but I mean I mean seriously as as a boyfriend or girlfriend with anyone that's not a Christian and you said what do you mean you don't allow them to I don't allow them go to bars either I don't allow them to drink I don't allow them to do drugs there some there just some standards you have to make and I'll say this it's not because we hate you it's because we love you we those boundaries are there because we love you what brother Danny was talking about this morning the reason we have these boundaries and these things we should do is because we love people not because we I hate people want to pick at them it's because we love you we want to see you I don't want to see one child in this church grow up and have to go out in the world and spend I I thank God for the testimonies we have of people that have been in the world and come back but I want something different for my children I want my children to not have the scars that I did I want them to be raised in the fear and admonition of the Lord you said but I haven't done right so far today the day to do right now's the time to make a decision I'm going to change my family history Hallelujah from this time and forever more I'm not going to let it be like it always was I'm not going to make the mistakes my parents made or my grandparents made I'm going to live differently sir because my kids deserve that the Next Generation if there is one deserves that yes amen right Hallelujah if you're not careful her life will come up ruin you don't know what he is and then he'll marry you and look where your kids are your grandchildren be careful God wants the people to be separated I was talking about my daughter watching that situation as a dad sometimes you have to just step in and we sometimes we we want our kids to be able to make the right decisions but our kids are also kids sometimes you just got to step in and say no that's not appropriate and she didn't do anything wrong in that situation but I was watching Satan trying to come in at an early age and over and I'm being honest about that and telling you about that today because don't you realize that Satan's working all the time he's working constantly try to come in and attack these children I've publicly said we're not going to lose one of them what do you think the devil's going to do about that you've had prayer at night you prayed you said Lord protect my children I'm going to make sure my children stay in church what do you think the devil's going to do immediately he's going to try to attack your family he's going to try to keep them out of the house of God but don't you realize that's when a a man of God a woman of God got to stand up and say not my family you don't have a right to my family yes sir amen amen hallelujah and but we do realize people make mistakes I'm glad this message is a message of Grace when it comes to marriage and divorce I know there people hate to hear that sermon but I I'm so grateful that it's a message of Grace amen because brother BR goes through all of that hard teaching about about the woman and the man and how what God intended and how Satan moved in and how it fell but then he goes to the very end of that he said so under the modern conditions he said I command you to go to your home with your wife now if you're happy with her live with her raise your children in the admonition of God what's brother randam concerned about not the past but the future and I think that's what we ought to be concerned about as a church I I we've all had a past we've all had something that we were but let's be concerned about the future he said if you're happy with or live with or raise your children in the admonition of God he said but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again now look he said you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God he said and now that you are as you are let us go now at the late evening hour that we're living in and press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ how many can say Amen to that today I want to press on my past is my past I'm moving on am good where all things will be possible I believe that's where we live today I want to turn from Marriage for a moment and think spiritually now how could Christ now think deeply with me for just a moment how could Christ talk to me let's make it personal and say come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you now he's not saying that he's going to be the farmer and you're going to be the yolked servant and he's putting a yoke on you what's he saying come be yolked with me yes oh my come be yolked with me come take my yoke upon you verse 29 and learn of me so in other words we're going to walk this in we're going to plow together we're going to do life together we're going to walk through uh the things and the discouragements and the valleys aren't you glad to have somebody that's bigger than you and stronger than you that's able to walk with you through those times yes amen he said I want you to take my yoke upon you learn of me because I'm going to be walking beside you and I'm bigger than you are I'm a different nature than what you were born with so he said I want to teach you I want you to walk beside me I want to be right there with you for I am meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest unto your souls I think the problem many times is not being yolked to Christ that we're too little but that we're too big we are too big and too strong in our own self we think we're sufficient we're able to make it and he said come be yolked with me not because I'm bigger not because I'm stronger but because amen not because I'm some great thing but because I'm meek and lowly and heart yes come be yolked with me and you shall find rest unto your souls now again I want to ask us I know it's different this morning and it's quiet let's just think about these things now how will we sinful creatures be yolked with Christ the sinless one would not that be an unequal yoke what now think about it for a minute if he said take my yoke upon you and we were to walk up there an old donkey in our nature yeah and here's this great here's this here's Christ the altogether Lovely One the Bible says he's altogether lovely never did no sin never never did anything that was wrong how are we going to be yoked up to Christ oh my well he provided a way yes yeah now we we are called the bride of Christ we believe that today in Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come his wife ha made herself ready we are his wife yeah and this is who he is look at this pairing today if you would with me for just a few moments we are paired with him we have been chosen by him yes and we are paired with him and if you look at this pairing it looks like an odd pairing because he chose Benjamin puit who did everything wrong to be married to Christ the word who did no sin hallelujah oh my this is who he is in 1 Peter 2:22 he did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth yeah this is who we are in Psalms 51:5 behold I was shapen in iniquity in sin did my mother conceive me how are you going to get an equal yoke out of that yeah oh my come on listen brother BR says this he said God has come into man and God does nothing I'll think about this for a minute just say that with me God does nothing he does nothing apart from man yeah so everything that he does come on Oh my he Yoles himself come on with man amen so it's Jesus every time he want to work in the church on now amen he wants to yoke himself up with the pastor he wants to yoke himself up with the song leader he wants to yoke himself up with the musicians he wants to yoke himself up with the Sunday School teachers that's his purpose yeah is to be equally yoked with us amen you ever feel like you're getting dragged Along come on just think about it we can be honest today and take off our Halos as we heard last week and just real realize realiz that we are sinners we have been some of you were raised in church I know brother Josh was raised in church and I was raised in church brother Josh we were still Sinners maybe the worst kind because we were raised in church right under the message of the hour and so we had a religious spirit come on and so we we reached the point where we needed to be saved right because this yoke was this marriage was never going to work come on as long as we were who we were but God partners with man he made man his partner how could I be worthy of him how could I be his partner and watch brother brand said this is who he's looking for he's looking for character he said the character of Christ yeah he said that now just a moment now he said that's it he chooses a bride to reflect his character to which the modern churches of today certainly miss his program here A Million Miles cuz they deny this to be the truth they deny the Bible to be the truth he said how could it be he said now he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed Hebrews they may not deny the Bible in the state that it's in right here but they deny the Bible in the light of the word of the hour yeah right he said we're looking he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed Hebrews 13:8 he said just exactly like it was like he was it's got to be his same flesh the same B B Same Spirit same everything just exactly built up and them two become one right so we are actually to become one with Christ and then he said until the church becomes that they're not one the character of him the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is now again you look at that and realize how unequal that pairing would be something has to happen with us and to us to translate us from what we were to be somebody who could walk with Christ amen are you with me so far amen something has to take place yes now Christ has the ability to do something that we cannot do in our natural relationships you know why I it it's so hard when you marry an unbeliever because in your mind you think I can change that person right and the truth is you can't right and some of you that even marry a believer in Church you're like I don't like this but he won't do that after we get married some of you married people say oh no you know what happens in relationships is once you get married those proclivities usually get worse not better the things that a person does that annoy you are going going to get worse he's not going to get he's not going to snore less he's not going to be he's not going to you know if he's a if he's a guy that likes to tell jokes and you're a real serious person and you just can't handle the way you tell but I'm going to change him sorry you're just not going to it's actually going to get maybe get worse once he gets more comfortable because you're seeing the best side of him now right right he right now he always wears deodorant right now everything everything's wonderful right but you fixing to see some things once you get married so there's coming a time that you can't say well I'm going to change this person the same thing works spiritually you say well I know he he's really a Baptist right now but once we get married I I'll convince him that the message is right you'll never be able to do that because God has to change that person and I don't even believe we should try to do that just live the life don't argue the doctrine live the life anybody can argue Doctrine that's a cold formal powerless Church only weapon is argument our weapon is not argument we're not going to argue the world into believing that we're Christians but we got to live a life that the world will say there's a Christian there's a Christian there's somebody who really loves people there's somebody who really lives the message of the hour somebody's got to do that so we we can't argue them into into change yeah right but Christ is different from us because he can change us see there's two things that you can't do with your spouse you cannot Forno the choices that they will make and you cannot change who they are and what the results of those choices are you cannot Forno that and so marriage is by faith you you have to be married on you watch their character you do everything you can to say and it's still by faith right because you don't really know that person until you're married so I know some people are so scared of marriage because well I'll never find the right one I tell you what every one of us has got faults right and if you look hard enough that all of your all the people in your life you're going to find faults right right you might you might want to open yourself up a little bit not to somebody outside the word but you ought to open yourself up a little bit and say God maybe the thing that you have for me is different than what I thought yeah come on so but now we have we know that we can't change the choices that they we can't Forno those things but he does both right before we ever sinned he knew what we would what sin we would do he knew all about it yeah amen and he chose us before we ever sinned oh aren't you glad for that today he chose us in eternity before we ever sin Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him yes before when did he do it before before I ever sinned before I ever made a mistake before I ever transgressed his law before I ever willfully went out and did things that were wrong oh that I ought to make a Baptist shout this morning before I was ever an unbeliever before I ever messed up he chose me when did he choose me before before the foundation of the earth yes before sin could be thought of Amen before the world could ever be thought of you say but I stole a truck just throw that out there I don't know if anybody here stole a truck but if you stole a truck before the truck was ever made he chose you come on before the law that said it was wrong to steal the truck was ever spoken he chose you before the materials that make up the truck the steel and and the and the computer and everything in the truck are made out of something before those minerals were ever in the Earth yeah Hallelujah if you are the bride of Christ today he chose you before all of those things before anytime the devil tries to come after you and tell you well I'm not worthy I can't be a Christian I've done too many bad things before the foundation of the world he chose me but what did he choose me for that we should be holy yeah and Without Blame before him in love he does something that we cannot do he changes us right oh God he chose us as he wanted us and then when we come and we don't fit that thought we drop down into time he chooses us he's already chosen us and so he actually brings us back redeems us that's what Redemption means to be brought back he redeems us back to the the image that he had in his mind to begin with I hope you know where I'm going this morning see it's not just about marriage it's not just about but Jesus said take my yoke be like me Oh my he has chosen us that we should be holy and Without Blame having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved like the farmer that takes oh my the yolk and you know they always have two a pair of two ox and but the one that he can the the way the farmer sits behind the with with the plow with a single plow the farmer has a near oxin and a far oxin and the near oxin is the one he keeps his eye on and that's the most experienced one that's the one who makes the least mistakes it's near ox and and that one will actually correct the behavior of the other ox and listen when we're yoked up to Christ what does he do he's the one that walks with us he didn't just say do it he said I'm going to do it and you do it with me I'm going to do it and you do you be I'll be a part of what you do yeah he Yoles himself up he Partners himself up yeah with us amen so that we always amen have someone with us that does it right you say but brother Ben I have a hard time getting it right I have a hard time live in the message but we always by the baptism of the Holy Ghost have somebody with us who does it right amen hallelujah listen you cannot escape the fact that you have been chosen I wonder if we understand that today you can run but you can't hide if there's something in your heart that pulls you to the message of the hour you may go so far that you think there's no way you could come back but you cannot hide from the grace of God Amen if he chose you before the foundation of the world you cannot Escape that you might as well give in and let him have his way he will patiently wait until the right time the right season he'll have somebody in place at the right time that'll speak truth into your heart that'll he'll be partnering with somebody at that time that'll help you because that's how he do does it is through men I hope you hear me this morning he he will partner himself for the man in such a way that before the foundation of the world he chose you and you will not be able to escape it he will patiently wait he will set up governments and move Kings he said how do I know he does that you remember when we was preaching about Jonah and how that Jonah didn't understand why he was going to Nineveh but then the ninevites came in and invaded Israel after they were saved under Jonah's message they turned from God invaded Israel and they made Samaritans they brought a group in there there was half Jew and half Gentile those were the Samaritans those were a direct result of Jonah going to Nineveh oh my and there was one of those Samaritans that was a predestined elected child of God and she was a woman at the well who' had five husbands had made many mistakes come on oh my but she's sitting on the side she comes up to the well there's a man sitting on the side of the well he said I have a need to go by Samaria he moved kingdoms moved a prophet for hundreds of years he orchest straight of that until you could finally get to a place where the woman at the well could be saved he will wait come on amen he doesn't get discouraged that don't make us happy today yeah he doesn't lose his sense of purpose yeah come on he doesn't lose his Focus right the image that he has of you does not get decayed righten listen you may have been in sin so long that you don't even remember what it was like to be a Christian but he never lost what you were you may have back so far you can't remember what it was like to feel the presence of God you can't remember what it was like to be able to raise your hands in church but he can restore you to that place yes he knows what you were before you were ever in sin so he's able to change you and make you to be the right kind of an equal yoke with him yeah so we can plow together and do the things we need to do in life now watch the Bible says we know that all things someone say all things brother Ben I get so tired of hearing this I don't CU there's some things in life I don't understand right I don't understand I told brother Robert you know I don't understand why he had to have a heart a heart surgery at 52 years old I don't understand that but I know that oh heart surgery is covered under all you said brother B I don't understand why I had to be out in the world for as long as I did it's covered under all on I don't understand why I have to drive so far to church all I don't understand why every time I try to do something for God the devil tries to attack me all things all things work together yeah even the devil's attack only strengthens your defense all right even the winds that go up against a tree that's planted by the rivers of water only strengthen the roots of the tree yeah on Hallelujah we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose the good and the bad are yolked together to work together for our good and somehow bring about a balance in our life verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate this is important who he knew he didn't just leave them but he predestinated them to be conformed to the image of his son because he had a I hate comparing us to donkeys but that's kind of what we were he had a little knock kned you remember the story in the Old Testament where the little knock KN donkey little crosseyed donkey's born and a lamb dies for his sins a lamb is oh my because if you had a donkey born that way you had to kill it but if a lamb would take his place he could live and an innocent lamb died for that little donkey don't you realize that us little little little people that we were us sinners that we were we triy to yoke us up to Christ we tried we tried to live it we tried to do all the legalistic things that we could do to try to make it happen but don't you realize he's got lamb had to die for you to make you be able to be yoked up to him yes sir amen he's going to form you into an equal partner how's he going to do that he's going to do that by his Spirit look Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also oh glorified I don't know how we feel sometimes we feel like well I was I was predestinated but I just never got called he said he also called right I I I was called but I was never Justified he also Justified I I was justified but I don't think I'll ever be glorified come on he also glorified hallelujah what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us yeah amen I want to challenge you with that see I can't come to church people look down on me who can be against us I I can't live for God I I I I'll be the outcast at school I'll be an outcast at work who can be against us if God be for us if he wanted to chose us to yoke us up correctly yoke us up equally in life who can be against us whatever happens is for our good he's making us equally yolked with him it was not enough for him to save us but he translated us into his kingdom he didn't just saved me but he made me flesh of his flesh bone of his bonej brother said he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest oh brother steart that gives me courage today it can only manifest I will be an equal partner to him I will be yoked up with him amen hallelujah he didn't just become an heir he made us join heirs he didn't come to be just by himself but he become the firstborn of many Brethren amen good amen he be in the groom the bride has to come forth it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride cuz she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life yes sir where he moves we move where he goes brother said the bride would have thus sayth the Lord or keep still what is it you're moving you're under a yoke with him he said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest I'll put you under the Yoke it's a strange metaphor to be under the Yoke and yet have rest but because he's the one who's leading because he's the one who's working it's not us it's him Hallelujah that's good hallelujah hallelujah yeah come on he said as man and woman are one woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the fine Spirit from him the flesh from his side side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife yeah the spirit of him and the Flesh of him put it together made mechanics and Dynamics until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics what's that the gasoline and the fire right until the church you put gasoline near fire something's going to happen there going to be an explosion that's what he said the church would be the gasoline and the fire the the mechanics and the Dynamics amen he said in the spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride I've told you before I love that he said 16 cylinders there and not four come on cuz I've had some four-cylinder vehicles that I hated I sold my last one to to my sister and she's got my little four-cylinder car I said that ain't enough power for me it takes a lot to move this big boy I want something with at least eight or six turbochargers maybe but there's just something about having more cylinders that makes you feel good when you have to go up the mountain this bride is not on four cylinders it's not even on8 cylinders he said it's moving on 16 cylinders it's got enough power to go up every Mountain enough power to make it through Le deia enough power to heal the sick enough power to raise the dead enough power to live for God every day do you believe that today amen he has made us equal partners with him he has yoked us up with him if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the the bride he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me amen he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he said I'll give him a charge of my mechanics and his mechanics the world will not be able to withstand it I'll raise him up again at the last day yes amen diet starts Monday somebody help me this is a cry for help up here from your pastor I need help losing weight I can't preach like this brother Josh don't even understand how that goes you will one day brother BR said I'll give him a charge he won't be able to withstand it amen amen the world won't be able to withstand it I'm so glad for that today he said you would possess every gate of your enemy these signs shall follow them that believe amen they shall my name they shall cast out Devils come on he's saying how this yolked team would operate all right amen this is how we plow the field this is how the church is run it's not run according to a Creed it's not run according to a membership role but it's run by the spirit of God by the spirit of Christ these signs shall follow them that believe this is the way they plow the field in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them Hallelujah not that we go pick up snakes we don't tempt to God but if we had to if we were in the line of duty and we got bit by a snake we have a god who's a Healer Heen they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it didn't say they'd recover overnight but they shall recover see he wants a bride with the same character that he has yes CU as he's plowing this Leo toan field that's right as he's reaping the Harvest yes BL to see he doesn't want a little church like a little donkey being dragged Along by a big Ox see that's Grace that becomes disgrace that's not what God wants he's not just going to drag you through brother he's not going to push you through a pipe pull you out the other end thereof and say blessed is he that overcometh he's not going to do that what does he do he he walks with you he trains you he teaches you he builds you up he puts his spirit in you so that you can plow like he plows you can work like he works you can you can be humble like he was humble you can love people like he loves people what is it he wants a bride with the same character that he has the same nature cuz we're going to we're going to work together with him at the end time we can only be that bride by the Holy Ghost we don't get there by knowledge we don't get there by being taught into it can I get just a few more minutes and we'll close we can only be that bride by the Holy Ghost we have been predestined to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I want you to understand that if you are a Christian today today he said well I've been baptized and here I am I'm waiting on the Holy Ghost you've been predestined to receive it amen you need to move on in Christ you need to believe it you need to you need to you need to accept it and you need to move on in Christ you need to you need to enter into it it's it's there brother B he wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it amen you need to just move into it you need to surrender to it Romans 6:1 what shall we say then he said shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound say well this old this this great beautiful Ox he'll pull me through life and I'll just be turning my legs like this on the other side of the ox just oh man just remain a calf praise God they'll feed me once a week we don't want to be like that do we we want to be yolked with him yeah I'm not making fun of you this morning sometimes I feel like I'm getting pulled along but what does he want to make us he wants to make us full partners with him amen shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us as were baptized how many of you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've been baptized I I know some of you didn't raise your hand I've been baptized but but maybe you've been baptized and you feel need to be re-baptized that's fine but you only have to be baptized one time when you're baptized you're baptized into the death of Christ right into the death of Christ you young people listen up up you've been baptized recently you baptized into the death of Christ means you go down into a watery grave well it feels like a grave doesn't it Melody does it feel like a grave feels like you're feels like you're being laid as cold isn't it laid under there trying to get your attention Melody just in case you didn't know you ra you're lowered down under the water and then you come back up yeah what is that you were buried with Christ amen but Jesus didn't stay in the grave right amen we don't leave you under the water I know some of y'all feel like I left you under the water a long time but we didn't we I want just want to make sure you got good and washed but some of us but Danny we had to stay under a long time but we're buried so we could be resurrected we're not buried to stay dead we're buried to be resurrected so we're lifted up out of the water to be resurrected like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life so we must be born again of the water blood and spirit and John 3 and5 Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God yeah right he cannot be yolked with Christ unless he's born of water and of the spirit 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand no man speaking by the spirit of God call it Jesus a cursed and that no man can say Jesus is Lord is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost the BR said you don't know nothing about it till you've received the Holy Ghost you say I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed if you don't you can't even call him the Lord because he's not Lord he's a historical being that you by faith have accepted but when he's come into you by the Holy Ghost he is your lord no man can call Jesus Lord only by the Holy Ghost until you're born of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost is in you he said then if you are you're born into this Kingdom you're part of the Church of the called out ones then he told talked about corn he said life can't come out of a corn unless there's life in it unless it's gerti he can't live again it may make good cornbread it may make good Corn Flakes it may look like a Christian act like a Christian but unless it has life in it it'll never raise again amen he said a man that's a good man could be just as good a church member as a Christian a man that's a good man could be just as good a citizen as a Christian a good man a moral man but when he dies that's it unless he's born again of the spirit of God because everything that had a beginning has an end God is the only thing that's Eternal therefore we're a part of God by receiving his life Jesus said I give unto them eternal life the Greek word there is Zoey means God's own life and the only way that you can ever live again is to have eternal life which is God's life because your life will perish but his life will be raised up again because God is eternal you've got eternal life and can no more die than God can die he that believeth on me has eternal life I'll raise him up at the last day raise him up again the eternal life that's in him will raise him up amen now brother Brandon said you can't get into heaven without being in the church well how do I get in the church you can't be in the church without the Holy Ghost right none of you have ever signed anything to be in not in this church anyway you don't sign nothing come on but we're not going to make you say well when you start paying ties when you start doing this that or the other that's not what it's about you do those things because you love Jesus not because you signed a contract never going to come to you and inspect your house and say well you know your house is okay you can come to church that's nonsense we want people that love Jesus I'll say whatever state that you're in you come to church you love God with all of your heart but as you love Jesus you begin to you begin to let go of things of the world because there'll just be something in your heart to do that you you can't get into heaven without being in the church that don't mean being in this building it means being a part of the of the Church of Jesus Christ the bride you can't go to Heaven till you're born again if you're born again you're in the church so you can't go to Heaven till you're a member this church you can't be a member till you're born into it he said now let me smother you a little you can't be a member unless God has called you to be a member right how happy you ought to be for that because you were predestinated before the foundation of the world how many believe that today very quickly how do I receive the Holy Ghost Peter in Acts 238 s unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you said but how do I know that I have it 1 John 51 let's turn there before we close first John John 51 whosoever whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat that's the father loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God he's been talking about loving the children of God loving one another he said when we love God and keep his commandments so we can express it like this the love of God in our heart causes us to love one another and causes us to live a life that's according to the word of God go study it when when you get home 1 John 5 by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments verse three for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous what' he tell us my yoke is easy my burden is light he didn't give us a list of rules he didn't tell us this is how long your dresses are going to be this is how long your hair is going to be this is all no he didn't tell us those things he said love me with all of your heart with all your soul with all your mind he said and you'll you'll live for me how can you love him like that only by the Holy Ghost you cannot call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost no man can come to God except the father brand said when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world that muck of mud he said as I talked about this morning God came to us God s you you never saw God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God come down in that muck what you were what I was and sought you out and brought you out he said brother Ben why do you have hope for even the worst sinner because I was the worst sinner you realize the worst sinner in Simon's house was Jesus so-called disciple J Judas and Pharisee who invited him it was the ones who seemed to be living it yeah the worst sinner was not the woman who washed his feet the worst sinner were those who would not respond to the word I was the worst sinner in the city but he saved me he changed me he brought me out yes sir hallelu he caught me when I was nothing so what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love would create a confidence in his word he loved me he said he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you was unlovable but he changed you that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up it gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took besides you right but he took you aren't you glad for that today am no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you he said then won't Your Love reach right back to him there's a love affair no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed listen to me Church you said but you don't understand my situation but no matter what the situation is it's circumstances think of the situation that you're in think of the wrong that you've done think of all those things that's there you can't forget it yeah yeah it's there but there's something about you if you're a Christian it's been washed by the blood of the Lamb no matter what this oh my I'm so thankful for this today no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates Faith amen that God loves you and you love God and you love one another yes and that brings the faith yes that it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised that's good it would do Hallelujah we bow our heads together for a moment musicians come I don't know about you when I got married naturally I I'm married up I think a lot of us feel that way especially as husbands I'm married up did not deserve the wife that God gave me but he gave her to me anyway I want to ask for a show of hands but I'm sure many of you feel the same way when I come to Christ I'm married up I'm so glad I did I didn't try to take the seed of God that He gave me and and and downgrade that try to make oh I tried but he he caught me we don't need to live in sin and in the world that's not what we were made to to be it's not what we were made to do we were not worthy all of us spiritually married up and we as we watch our partner our our husband our groom as we watch him work we think how could we ever work like that how could we ever how could we ever do that well he said I know you can't but I'll put my spirit in in you I'll change your nature where you won't be like a a a horse that would jump forward and run but you'll be just like him a nature like is to love people like he loves people to care like he cares oh God you wonder how do you become a Danny Ward how do you become a Lonnie Medlin some of these men ever all of my life I've watched these men live for God how do you become that how do you become sister Fritz how do you do that how do you become some of our elders can call names all day how do you how do you become so strong how do you live for God that long through disappointments and failure and fear and everything else how do you do that only by being yolked up to him I think every one of these that I've mentioned and all the others that know they've lived for God all these years they could never have done it on their own they could not have live the word but by the power of the Holy Spirit they were made to be an equal partner and equally yolked partner with him by his Spirit we have been baptized into the body don't get discouraged Just Surrender to him let him lead you let him guide you into all truth I want to ask you this morning and challenge you if you've never received the
